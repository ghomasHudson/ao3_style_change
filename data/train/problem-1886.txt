Sherlock threw his head back in pleasure and quickened the pace. John didn't know how they could go any faster, and while one side of him didn't want this to end, he was enjoying the brisk pace.
Once there John lay down on his side of the bed, Sherlock quickly following him, but instead of laying on his own side he decided instead to lay on top of John. He had removed his dressing gown which made movement much easier. He started kissing John with a passion that was unknown to him before. Each kiss was a declaration of love, of need, getting deeper and more passionate. He kissed John's lips, his neck, his chest, his stomach. He kissed every part of John he could get to until he reached John's pyjama trousers, at which point he kissed his way back up to John's lips again. It may not have been what John had in mind but it was clearly taking Sherlock's mind off whatever had been bothering him. When Sherlock reached his lips again John put his hands on the back of the detective's neck and deepened the kiss. His own tongue slipped into Sherlock's and he heard the detective moan in pleasure. The kisses became more forceful, both fighting for dominance over them, until they were both gasping in need of oxygen.
After taking the tablets John supported Sherlock as they got back into bed. He lay him down carefully, cushioned his head on the pillow until he was comfortable and then settled down beside him. “How does that feel?”
Now as he sat here waiting for absolute confirmation that John was okay and could go home he thought back to all the times he had ended up in the hospital and John had to sit there waiting for him to wake up or waiting for him to be patched up, always worried about what might have been and how Sherlock would come out of it.
Sherlock did so and was rewarded with yet more pain across his ribs. "I thought this was supposed to get better with time," he winced.
Since John and Sherlock had started living together he had grown accustomed to the detective's every disposition, and each disposition had a different manner of handling. Sometimes it was best to leave him alone, sometimes it was best to distract him and sometimes all that could be done was to keep an eye on him. John didn't like any of Sherlock's darker moods, but his danger nights scared him the most. He'd first had a glimpse at Sherlock's mysterious past on the day Lestrade had carried out his pretend drugs bust and not long after the events at the pool Mycroft had spoken to John and explained everything. Well, everything he deemed necessary, which really wasn't much at all, but it did give John an understanding of how important it was to watch out for Sherlock.
Sherlock came over and stood behind him. He brought his hands up to John's back and started rubbing, trying to reach the spot that seemed to be troubling John. After finishing preparing the tea John dropped his head back against Sherlock's chest and relaxed into the touch. "A little lower," he said.
“You’re welcome,” John replied earnestly. “Was there anything else?” he added, noticing Sherlock fidgeting nervously.
Sherlock helped him sit up slowly, his hand positioned on John’s back for support. John’s hands grasped Sherlock’s free arm, trying to hold on to something as a wave of vertigo washed over him. Once he was finally sitting up he took a deep breath and looked at the detective.
Sherlock could do nothing but look back at him. He didn’t want to do anything to disrupt this moment. He was trying to deduce what John was thinking, worried that he was suddenly regretting everything they’d done so far and was trying to find a way to stop without hurting Sherlock’s feelings. It had been too good to be true, after all.
Sherlock looked slightly startled at the thought. Clearly it wasn't his original idea, but he didn't seem to mind. "I believe it is," he said as he extended his hand out to John who took it with no hesitation.
A few hours later he woke up and set about his morning routine. It was strange not having John around. He's been so used to waking up next to him every day that he felt strangely alone now. Nevertheless he had something to plan that John couldn't know about, so he was glad to have some time to do it while John was away.
"They had him sedated for a while, but they say he's just sleeping now. His body's trying to recover."
She dismissed his apology with a wave of her hand and turned a worried eye upon him. "What's happened, John?"
It was even worse than before. When Sherlock had jumped he knew that he was dead, or so he thought. There had been no desperation for salvation, just the realization that he had lost his best friend. Now, however, he had so much more to lose. And he was desperate to help Sherlock, to be in there taking care of him, even if just holding his hand, but he knew he couldn’t. And it killed him.
That single word sent a rush through Sherlock. He could barely make out all the emotions that were going through him right now, but the most prominent ones seemed to be relief and sheer happiness.
The second time had been after shouting at John when he’d tried to get Sherlock to talk about his nightmares. It had always been something Sherlock had found difficult to talk about, even when he was younger, and he had felt suffocated. He's run off into the night and done the most stupid thing he could think of, something he thought would help, and something John had explicitly asked him not to do. When he returned home he felt guilty not only for his actions but so very regretful of the pain it had clearly caused John; John who, regardless of his anger, had chosen to help Sherlock struggle through the effects nonetheless.
He had been in the middle of a meeting when he received the news and had left as soon as he could. He always meant it when he said he worried about Sherlock. No matter how difficult or unique their relationship may be Sherlock was his brother, and he loved him. They were both rather uncomfortable with any show of sentiment, but deep down they both knew the truth, but they kept up the guise of disgruntled brothers. Mycroft was starting to think that John could see right through it, regardless of how many times he questioned Sherlock on their sibling rivalry.
Mycroft shifted slightly, though whether he was taken by surprise at the abruptness of the question or the question itself John couldn't tell. "I'm afraid you'll have to be more specific."
John closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. He took a deep breath before opening them again. He walked over to Sherlock’s chair and kneeled down between the detective’s legs. “I’m not going to tell you how worried that makes me. And I’m not going to tell you how much of an idiot you are for ignoring your body’s needs. What I will tell you though, is that next time I find out you haven’t eaten at the very least one proper meal in the day, and let me assure you I will know, you will sleep, alone, on that sofa for a whole week.”
"I do, on occasion, but I think it disintegrated when it realised it looked like you were going to do the dishes."
John could see Lestrade trying hard not to laugh at Sherlock’s annoyance. “Like I said, I was just wondering how your special day had been so far.”
John didn't want to give in so quickly, Sherlock really had scared him, but he couldn't help the grin that spread across his face at Sherlock's declaration. He took his plate from the tray and looked at Sherlock who had not yet made a move towards his own breakfast.
He shook his head attempting to clear those thoughts from his mind and stood up, momentarily forgetting his hangover, and swayed slightly. Sitting back down on the sofa he took a minute to steady himself. He put his head down against his chest and tried to control his breathing. It was at this point that he spotted something made out of blue material lying on the floor and he reached out his hand to grab it. Just as he realized what it was memories from last night assaulted him and a single thought reverberated in his mind. Sherlock was alive!
Sherlock's head snapped up. John was looking down at him with a curious expression. Had John been saying something? Sherlock had been so deep in his own thoughts that it was likely he had missed it. "I'm sorry, did you say something?"
John went over to the kitchen where he had been preparing breakfast before their little escapade and finished up. When he brought the food and tea back to the living room Sherlock had finally sat up on the sofa properly and seemed more coherent.
“Sherlock, please!” John pleaded. He hated seeing Sherlock in pain, especially when there was something he could do about it. “At least to alleviate the first symptoms.”
"I like the sound of that," John said with a smile. He was just about ready to get out of the shower but there was still Sherlock to consider. "I'll help you get ready then."
John did as he was told, crawling over Sherlock’s body once again. He went straight to the detective’s lips where he lay a surprisingly gentle kiss, his hand coming up to cup Sherlock’s face. “Are we really doing this?” he asked.
"Don't make jokes, Mycroft. John's at work, you know that perfectly well," Sherlock replied, annoyed at the amount of security his brother had on both himself and John, though admittedly it could be helpful sometimes. "I need your help."
"The wife," Sherlock replied, as he ran his hands through his now wet hair. As he did so John started roaming his hands over Sherlock's chest and moving ever closer to the detective.
It was starting to worry him. He knew his mind needed to be occupied, but there was very little that could do that. John usually managed to distract him, but he had work and was only home late in the afternoon, cases seemed like an impossible thing now and the third option was a bit not good. He could see that John was also starting to worry, so much so that he seemed to avoid bringing up the lack of cases and was more lenient with some of the things Sherlock should do, but chose not to even though he was completely unoccupied.
"I think I will," John said as he unraveled Sherlock's dressing gown which immediately fell open displaying Sherlock fully to him. John's hand snaked down from Sherlock's chest all the way to the elastic band of his pants. "It's more than you wore at Buckingham Palace," he noted.
Reluctantly Sherlock got up, ready to leave. He put on his coat and scarf as John opened the door and started walking downstairs, his own coat already on. Sherlock quickly caught up and managed to call a taxi while John was still locking the door.
In true Sherlock Holmes fashion he stalked out of the room with a swish of his dressing gown leaving a giggling John Watson behind.
They each wrapped a towel around their waist, though it was clear they were going to be discarded soon enough, and exited the bathroom. As soon as they reached their room John pushed Sherlock against the wall, effectively closing it, and attacked Sherlock's lips with ferocity. Sherlock returned the kiss with equal fervour and soon they were once again fighting for dominance over their kisses.
It was one thing to see it happening, it was another to realize the extent of what it did to Sherlock. Nevertheless he was going to be fine, which was what John needed to concentrate on.
Sherlock was awoken once again by a warm presence behind him. He shifted so that he was laying on his back to find John looming over him.
“If you’re sure,” John said, though it was clear he was still concerned. “I’m making dinner now if you want to help out.”
He walked in to find Sherlock in just his dressing gown curled up against the bathtub, knees drawn up to his chest and arms crossed over them supporting his head. It wasn’t the first time he had come to find Sherlock like this. Whenever the pain got too bad and he couldn’t sleep he always retreated somewhere so that John could still sleep. But John preferred to be awake and help Sherlock through it, even if it meant staying up all night.
Sherlock’s eyes widened in surprise and he scoffed. “You’re asking me if I’m alright? I’m not the one who got smacked in the head with a baseball bat, John.”
When they were alone once again John looked at Sherlock to find the detective gaping at the place where their landlady had been standing a moment before.
John started telling him stories about Afghanistan. He told Sherlock about all the people he'd met and all the places he'd seen. He described the heat of the desert, the hours of watching, waiting for anything to happen, and then the adrenaline rush of battle. He painted a picture with his words and Sherlock found himself captivated. Concentrating on John's voice and his gentle touch he slowly slipped into unconsciousness.
"And you shall rest more before you're allowed to leave, Sherlock. Do try not to be difficult," said Mycroft.
John could tell that Lestrade felt the same way, even after years of working with Sherlock. John remembered how pleased Lestrade looked at the first crime scene John and Sherlock had worked together, urging Sherlock to tell them his process by implying that Sherlock was making it up. He knew it wasn't true, of course, Sherlock didn't need to make any of it up to impress people, but Sherlock had felt the need to explain himself, huffed out his deductions as he moved fluidly across the room, pointing out little bits of information all the dull minds had missed.
John smirked from his position and decided to put Sherlock out of his misery. He stood up straight and started moving his hands all over Sherlock's arse and looking the detective straight in the eye. "And you love it."
Sherlock scoffed. "I don't need physiotherapy. I know all the exercises and I have a doctor at home, what else do I need?"
John reached across the table to kiss Sherlock, their hands entwined under the table. Once John became conscious of where they were he broke the kiss apart and sat back looking slightly flushed. Sherlock just looked amused.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Because you have a traumatic brain injury which affects brain function and can have negative cognitive effects as well as-”
John obliged but then suddenly stopped as he realised what they were about to do. “We really shouldn’t, Sherlock. You should be resting, your head-”
Before Sherlock could reply with his own greeting John softly cupped the detective's face, his eyes never leaving Sherlock's in an intense gaze that spoke more than words. He gently lowered himself until their lips met in a deep passionate kiss. If this was what Sherlock would wake up to every morning he would be more than happy to adapt his sleeping habits accordingly. As his brain clicked back into gear, having been momentarily stunned by the intensity of John's gaze, he returned the kiss with equal fervour; the all-consuming kiss becoming more pleasurable by the second. Sherlock's hands moved of their own accord and roamed his partner's body until they settled on his hips. After what seemed like forever they broke apart- Sherlock had never thought breathing was so dull- and he rolled them both over so that he was positioned over John; an ideal spot for what he was about to do. Before John could protest, which he seemed more than ready to do, Sherlock brought his lips down on John's exposed neck.
The moan that came out of Sherlock's mouth was exquisite, and John didn't think he'd ever heard such a beautiful sound. He was trying to control his breathing as he pushed slowly in and out of Sherlock, wanting to be gentle and take his time.
And so John and Lestrade were off to the pub where a few more of John’s friends were waiting. Sherlock figured it would be best for John to spend some time with his friends on his birthday instead of just spending the whole day around the flat. No matter how much he loved having John to himself he recognised that John needed to spend time with his other friends as well, and this was the perfect opportunity; especially because Sherlock needed time to plan for the next day.
"I'm not in pain, John, stop worrying," Sherlock said when he finally opened his eyes and noticed John's frown as he looked over him.
John had planned on staying. They had barely spoken about the time Sherlock had spent away and he wanted to know the specifics of what he had been doing, but once he realized how hard it really was to listen to it he rethought his decision.
“I know, Sherlock, “John said, a note of understanding in his voice, “but you know how bad your migraines can get, and this will help. They should be over in a day or two, you won’t have to take them for long.”
"I missed you. The bed's cold without you." John leaned forward and kissed Sherlock on the lips. It was clear that something had upset Sherlock, but John didn't want to pressure him right now, he just wanted him to come back to bed. "Come to bed with me, I'll help you sleep."
Lauren continuously took Sherlock’s respiratory rate, noting the lengthening gap between each breath and watching for the moment when the next one wouldn’t come at all.
"Good, good. I'm glad you're alright," she said as she smiled at him. Sherlock always wondered how someone who had such a grim and sometimes lonely job could be so happy all the time, but perhaps that was exactly why. She worked with the dead, so she knew to appreciate the living. He felt he was starting to understand a little bit better now, something he never thought he would aim to do, but was glad for it nonetheless.
John frowned, thinking back to the last time he had seen Sherlock eating. He didn’t actually remember when that was. “Sherlock, when was the last time you ate?”
He watched as Sherlock tried to roll his hips and match John’s thrusts, but John wasn’t making it easy for him. Every time Sherlock tried to meet his thrust John pulled back just slightly. Sherlock’s frustration was only turning him on even more.
“I’m not used to people enjoying my company, much less for such a prolonged amount of time,” he finally admitted. “You’re still a mystery to me, John Watson.”
He was snapped out of his reverie by the warm pressure of John's lips on his neck and a slight nudge. Sherlock took the hint quickly enough and maneuver himself within reach of John's mouth. He then pulled John down for a long languid kiss. They stayed like that for a long time; Sherlock embraced by John, their mouths moving together as one in a comfortable cadence. Sherlock had cupped John's face with his left hand and John was rubbing soothing circles on Sherlock's back. After a while they broke apart, once again interrupted by their bodies' tedious need of oxygen. Sherlock lay his head gently back down on John's chest and felt the oscillation created when he spoke.
It was then that a man frantically ran into the room, breathing heavily and looking panicked when he saw the scene in front of him. “Jesus, Sherlock,” he breathed, dismayed.
Sherlock shook his head quickly, not wanting to worry John. “Nothing’s wrong,” he said, and watched as John visibly relaxed. “I just thought you should know, before we start, that I’ve never done this before.”
If he was honest with himself he knew that sooner or later Sherlock would end up in the hospital. Whether because of an injury he'd sustain while chasing a criminal, or the drugs or just simply exhaustion, but he never thought Sherlock would end up here because he saved someone else.
He put his hand out and John gave him the tablets along with the glass of water. After taking them, instead of handing the glass back to John as he usually did, Sherlock got up and took it to the kitchen himself. It was clear that he was upset, but John didn’t intend to let him sulk for long. This was one of those things they absolutely needed to talk about.
"You're out of practice," Sherlock mocked, though he did run his hand gently up and down John's back.
"Hey, Sherlock, look at me," John said and moved his hand under Sherlock's chin, forcing him to look up. And Sherlock was surprised, so very surprised, when he didn't see pity there. He knew. Just like he’d predicted, John knew that Sherlock couldn’t stand the pity or the disapproval or the judgement. And Sherlock knew now, looking John in the eye, that he wasn’t disappointed, he was worried. Worried about Sherlock because he cared, because he loved him. And Sherlock was so grateful that he buried his face in John’s shoulder and wrapped his arms tightly around him.
Something was pulled over his face and he was ready to protest when suddenly he could breathe. The relief was so immense that he instantly felt all his muscles relax. There were a blissful few moments when the heat was gone, the noise was muffled and the pain was slowly fading from his body but he still felt anxious. There was something missing, though he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. He just knew that he
The detective did so and John slid in behind him and put a pillow between them so that Sherlock would be elevated which would be more comfortable for his ribs. He wrapped the towel and around the ice pack and gingerly placed it on Sherlock's ribs.
When they finally arrived Sherlock jumped out of the taxi, leaving John to pay, and walked over to Lestrade. "What do we have?"
Sherlock rubbed the substance over John's skin and then started rubbing his hands up and down John's back, taking special care when he got to the pulled muscle. John hissed in pain, but made no other complaints. He knew it was going to hurt, he was just glad that Sherlock was making it better.
The next three days were the same. Sherlock still hadn't slept and had barely eaten but he finally seemed closer to solving the case. John had done all he could to help and seeing as he didn't have work this week he went to the pub with some old friends.
Suddenly the two started shouting at one another. The boy started backing away from his mother, clearly overwhelmed with the argument and all the strangers surrounding the house.
Sherlock hand reached out to John's arse and squeezed. John yelped slightly and bucked his hips forward, which seemed to please Sherlock. He grinned widely at John.
John huffed in annoyance at Sherlock’s stubbornness but soon gave in and sat down on the sofa. As soon as he did Sherlock lay his head down on his lap and closed his eyes again. John started running his hands through Sherlock’s curls distractedly while he watched telly.
"I love kissing you so much," John said as he continued to lick his way down Sherlock's neck. The detective only grunted in reply, not being able to form proper sentences through the haze of pleasure. John's hands roamed Sherlock's body once again, resting on his hips. Sherlock's own hands were moving all over John, unable to stay in one place for very long. John started biting Sherlock's neck and he felt him thrust his hips forward, effectively putting pressure in all the right places.
It was still early in the morning when John woke up in his husband’s arms. Husband. The word brought a swell of happiness along with it every time. For so long he had wanted Sherlock, longed for him, his company, his attention, his love, and now he had it. He had all of him, forever.
He still worked as a sounding board for Sherlock who always needed someone to talk to about the development of the case. The excitement in Sherlock's eyes was evident whenever he moved one step closer to solving the case. It was refreshing to see the old Sherlock back again, not the withdrawn, tired and dejected Sherlock that John had witnessed the days before.
"No," John replied after preparing the two mugs of tea and handing one to Sherlock before sipping from his own and joining the detective on the sofa.
“Sherlock, we’re taking you downstairs now,” Lauren explained, “You’re strapped up nice and tight but I need you to stay still while we move you so no one gets hurt. Don’t try to reach out with your hands, we’ve got you.”
"My pleasure," John replied and his hand finally moved underneath Sherlock's pants. For the next few minutes all that could be heard in the flat were Sherlock's breathless moans muffled by John's mouth on his. They'd both missed this. The pleasure. The intimacy. The intensity. It wasn't long before Sherlock was writhing and moaning until John finally pushed him over the edge with one final firm stroke.
The detective's eyelids fluttered slightly and after a few seconds he finally opened his eyes. They roamed around the room for a short time before finally settling on John, who had a huge smile on his face.
John tried to pull Sherlock off, but it only served to assist in the removal of his pyjama top when he lifted his arms. His pants soon followed suit as Sherlock's hands travelled lower and lower, as did his lips, and John couldn't help a yelp of surprise at their current placement. John tried once again to control the cacophony of lustful sounds from escaping but an especially well placed kiss by Sherlock ensured that all his self-control went out the window and John gasped in pleasure.
He reached his hand out to John's and interlaced their fingers, giving John's hand a brief squeeze of reassurance. John was finally here with him and everything was going to be fine. He had his reputation to build back up, he owed a lot of explanations, but right now all he could think about was John. Everything else, all the worries and all the pain and all the memories of the last few months fell away now that he was here. He closed his eyes, engulfing himself in John's presence. As he mused on how comfortable and at home he felt like this he wondered if John felt the same way. He hadn't pushed away yet but would he be uncomfortable with their current predicament? He felt John hold him closer, his arm now wrapped firmly around Sherlock in an embrace, answering the detective's unspoken question.
“Mrs Hudson,” she replied. She looked down at Sherlock, a warm expression in her eyes. “My boy is a fighter, please tell me he’ll be alright.”
“Who said anything about fair?” Sherlock asked as he moved his hips along with John’s, intensifying every sensation coursing through their bodies.
John narrowed his eyes at Sherlock, who was now pulling John towards the stairs. "You hid your experiments in there, didn't you?"
John had sounded hopeful for a few moments. His eyes bore into Sherlock and he'd swallowed nervously after he asked why Sherlock was concerned about marriage. Could he have been thinking the same as him? It was then Sherlock realized that, short of mind reading or outright asking, there would be no way of knowing, so he moved forward with his plan.
"Sherlock," John breathed, "careful with your arm." It was trapped between their chests and John was worried that Sherlock would hurt himself in the process. He wasn't exactly being mellow, though John wasn't complaining.
"I understand, John," he said smugly, "some people can only handle so much excitement. Though I was rather hoping you would have a higher threshold of endurance. I have a lot of ideas about what we could do."
They both moaned in pleasure and John closed his eyes and buried his head in Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock started thrusting slowly in and out, John meeting his thrusts with his hips.
She watched him like a hawk, noting the slight blue twinge to his lips and the fact that he could barely keep his eyes open. The hand that before had been clutching at the older woman now lay limp in her hand. His breathing was becoming increasingly ragged, and much too fast for her liking.
The next day was spent between Scotland Yard, the crime scene and Bart's. Sherlock and John had shown up like Lestrade had asked and it was obvious how relieved the detective inspector was. It wasn't an exceptionally difficult case but Lestrade was working on several cases at once and needed Sherlock's help, which Sherlock was more than happy to supply.
John's smile lit up at Sherlock's confession. It wasn't often that they had these conversations, but when they did he was always taken aback by Sherlock's admissions.
Sherlock sauntered into the living room and sat down on his chair with an exaggerated sigh. John laughed at his reaction, knowing that Sherlock’s lack of prowess in the kitchen was a sore subject for the detective.
After dinner they walked back to Baker Street, once again hand-in-hand, something that they could both easily get used to. It seemed so natural, that they should close the distance between them; a statement that nothing could tear them apart.
Sherlock fidgeted with the hem of John’s pyjama top, avoiding looking at John and avoiding the question. He wasn’t even sure why he’d brought up the subject, but somehow it felt strange to hide anything at all from John, even if there was nothing to do be done about it anymore.
Mycroft was getting worried at the state Sherlock was in. It wasn't often he allowed others to see how agitated he was, much less Mycroft, and he was starting to wonder if his problem was more serious than he had first thought. Before he could even ask what was wrong Sherlock stopped pacing and blurted it out.
Sherlock couldn’t help the resonating moan that left his mouth. He had spent so long dreaming about this moment, wondering what John would be like in bed, thinking about every touch and caress they would share. “John,” he groaned quietly, not even knowing what he wanted to say.
“I thought we’d discussed this before. Whenever you feel a migraine coming on, you should tell me.” John got up from the sofa and dropped Sherlock down gently, careful not to aggravate his head further.
Sherlock might be dead, for all he knew. Dead all over again, and this time it would take all of John with him.
“Calm down, alright?” John said, though he completely understood why Sherlock was getting impatient. He thought for a second before finally remembering. “I think we left it in the bathroom last night.”
The paramedics had just returned to their ambulance after leaving their latest patient at the hospital when their radios went off for their next call. They quickly turned on the lights and sirens and started making their way through the streets of London. They weaved past cars stuck in the incessant traffic, and the careless pedestrians crossing busy roads. Even with a bright yellow truck with shrieking sirens and flashing lights, it was difficult to drive in the heart of the city without a near miss or two.
John was glad when he woke up the next morning and saw that Sherlock was still asleep. It was clear from the previous night that something had been bothering him, and it was even clearer that he didn't want to talk about it but John had to get to the bottom of it. He was worried about Sherlock, not only because the detective had never had trouble sleeping before, but also because of how he reacted. John had come downstairs to find him drinking and smoking, both unusual behaviours for Sherlock, especially since he was adamant he had quit smoking altogether. Sherlock's addictive personality and his inability to accept help were a recipe for disaster, and it was up to John to prevent anything terrible from happening.
The soft brush of lips was short but reassuring for both of them and they broke apart after Lestrade cleared his throat uncomfortably from his chair. "I'm right here, you know."
He grabbed Sherlock's wrists and pinned them to his side and the detective started fighting instantly, but John quickly pressed his lips against Sherlock's, hoping that the familiar sensation would help bring him out of the nightmare. After a few short seconds Sherlock stilled under him and finally managed to come back to himself. When John felt Sherlock return the pressure he let go of his wrists and slowly pulled away.
"How good you are to me." Sherlock kissed his lips. "How you always know what I need." His jaw. "How you always get me what I need." His neck. "How you never ask for anything in return." His collarbone. "And just how much I love you."
John grabbed his phone from the bedside table and checked the time before replying. "About 10 hours, how are you feeling?"
Sherlock reacted purely out of instinct. He raced forwards towards the boy, seeing as he seemed to be the only one close enough to stand a chance of pushing him out of the way. The driver, however, seemed utterly oblivious to the situation and continued down the road.
Sherlock blinked a couple of times before looking around, no doubt trying to reassure himself he was safe in their room. "I'm fine."
“What-” he started to ask, but cut himself short as soon as he saw the look on Sherlock’s face. He looked mortified.
Sherlock tucked his head under John’s chin and held his hand beneath the covers. He was starting to feel sleepy, no doubt a combination of great sex and a cosy warm bed with John Watson in it. “It’s perfect,” he replied, and moments later fell asleep in John’s arms.
Sherlock couldn’t contain the whimper that came out of his mouth at John’s words. He gripped him by the back of the head and crushed their lips together. John barely had time to process what was happening before Sherlock was jumping out of the sofa and dragging John along with him.
He was so helpless, so useless. He couldn't stop Harry from drinking. He couldn't stop Sherlock from dying. And now he couldn't stop himself from falling apart.
Mycroft eyed the cigarette in his brother's hand critically, not wanting to say anything that might start an argument but wanting to make his displeasure known all the same. "I have a case for you, brother. Thought you might be interested."
Gently, they pried the boy out of Sherlock’s arms and lay him across his mother. John took a few moments to assess the boy’s condition and confident that he only had a few scrapes, seeing as Sherlock had wrapped himself around the boy so completely that he had barely suffered any damage, he left the boy with his mum and both he and Lestrade turned their attention towards the detective.
He shook his head clear of such thoughts and hung his jacket up before making his way to the bathroom. He took off his clothes, his muscles protesting at the movement, and turned the shower on nice and hot. He looked at himself in the mirror and wondered how Lestrade hadn't sent him home before. His eyes looked tired and sunken in, his skin a shade paler than was usual and his hair was a mess from the sleepless nights by Sherlock's bedside.
He remembered meeting Sherlock for the first time at St. Bart's. He remembered dinner at Angelo's and his poor attempt at concealing his interest for the detective. He remembered running after a cab, his psychosomatic limp long forgotten, and he remembered laughing like he hadn't laughed in a very long time.
Suddenly Sherlock let go of John's hand and pushed himself off, trying to regain control of his breathing. John was in much the same condition but recovered more quickly. "Feeling better now?" he asked.
Not a minute later Sherlock walked back into the living room with his nose buried in a case file. There was another stack under his arm. Not surprisingly Lestrade followed behind and shot John an amused look.
Darting one last look in Sherlock's direction, noticing he had closed his eyes and seemed to already be asleep, John closed the door quietly behind him and left.
They both watched anxiously as Mrs Hudson shut the door to her flat and adjusted the big bag on her shoulder. “Don’t mind me, boys,” she said casually. “I’m just off to my sister’s for the weekend. As you were,” she said with a mock solute, winking at John. Before she shut the door to Baker Street she smiled at her boys.
It came as a surprise to him to realize how nervous he felt whenever he thought about it. He didn't know what he was going to do, and he had no idea whether or not John would agree; maybe it wasn't something he wanted in his life. He decided to bring it up to try to discern John's feelings on the subject. He took the chance about two weeks later when the case they had just solved involved a wife who had killed her husband when she found out he was cheating. Dull. Boring. Predictable. But very convenient for Sherlock at the moment.
When Sherlock finally emerged from the bedroom John noted that he wasn't wearing any trousers. When he moved closer and moved the dressing gown aside he noticed that Sherlock wasn't wearing a pyjama top either. Conclusion, he was whether naked under the dressing gown or had only put on his pants.
Sherlock was now completely incoherent. The only thing he could do was moan, louder and louder, as John continued, and he tried to meet the doctor's every thrust with one of his own, which were now becoming more and more discontinuous as he lost control of his body.
The image brought memories from their wedding day back to the forefront of his mind. The jitters, the anxiety, the swell of expectation and finally the moment when he saw Sherlock, elegantly dressed in a suit, tailored to curve around his long, lean body, smiling expectantly up at him. Everything felt just right in that moment. He and Sherlock were about to promise to spend the rest of their lives together. It was something that John had been looking for throughout his whole life, no matter how much he tried to deny it, and now he had the perfect man right in front of him, just as eager and expectant of what lay ahead for them.
"You never ask anything for no reason." John was growing more and more suspicious of Sherlock's odd behavior and questions, and he couldn't pretend not to notice it anymore. "Are you planning on doing some weird experiment, Sherlock?"
John gave a little shiver when Sherlock started doing exactly what he’d just described. He manoeuvred them so that John was once again on top of him with his head on his chest and his arms around him. “How’s this?”
"No," Sherlock replied, none too convincingly. He knew that John was becoming suspicious but he preferred John to think he was doing strange experiments, that way he wouldn't over think Sherlock's behaviour and possibly figure out what he had planned.
"Let me guess," John said, "Lestrade called you in and you forgot to eat or take any food with you and even when you started feeling like crap you stayed because you were bored of just sitting around the flat."
John watched it all unfold in amazement. Sherlock had never looked so beautiful to him as he did now, completely stripped of the mask he wore on a daily basis. The look on his face was of pure and unabashed pleasure. And as he watched, he felt his own release building up until he could no longer hold back, and he came as well.
It was as though he was reliving that day all over again. He remembered all the sights and smells of the small town, all the people he spoke to, all the places he visited, but most of all he remembered the boy, the flash of silver and the pain.
John moaned in response but managed to sit up slightly on the sofa. Sherlock was left to do most of the work. He propped John up against a few pillows and took off his jacket which he folded over the chair on top of his own. He also checked over John’s head quickly and then pecked him on the lips which seemed to finally bring John back to consciousness.
John had always been fascinated to see Sherlock working but it felt so refreshing now. He had watched Sherlock at the crime scene, intently, gaze never lifting from him. Sherlock's eyes darted around the room, taking in every scrap of information, making sense of it all, storing it away for later use, and in the end it all made sense to him. Even if John had seen it done over and over again Sherlock's deductions still baffled him. How he took a single piece of what could be considered trivial information and took it apart, made sense of it, and blurted it all out at top speed whilst still gathering more from the room, from the body, from everything.
. Sherlock was looking strangely uncertain but John wrapped his arms around the detective anyway, capturing him in a long overdue hug, and soon he felt him return the pressure. He had no idea how much time had passed but he didn't care. Neither one of them was willing to let go now that they were together again. John felt his chest fill up with joy. In the warmth of the embrace he started to feel the alcohol tugging him into unconsciousness. He felt himself drifting off in the arms of the detective, and he thought he heard Sherlock whisper something, just three little words, but in his haze he couldn't make out what they were.
It was a routine they had both gotten into, and regardless of how nice it was that Sherlock had started doing things for him John was just glad that he was now able to convince the detective to eat regularly- breakfast at least. He always worried about how little Sherlock ate and slept, especially when he was working a case, and now he had one less thing to worry about.
John’s hand was still tangled in Sherlock’s hair and the detective thought only for a brief second before bringing their lips together in a deep kiss. It felt different somehow, than the last time they had kissed. Not because anything had changed between them, but because something had changed in Sherlock.
Lestrade felt slightly useless just hanging around, looming over their sleeping forms, but he didn't know what else to do. Sherlock had been treated for hours; a chest tube was applied, his concussion evaluated, his broken arm cast, his dislocated shoulder set, his bruises and broken ribs iced and a wide array of medication provided. There was nothing anyone could do for him right now, he just had to wake up. And Lestrade hoped it would be very soon, for John's sake.
Sherlock gave an exasperated sigh; clearly he was expecting a bit more, but he didn't want to give his own wanton desire away. "I suppose if there's nothing else you want to do," he shrugged, trying to sound nonchalant.
Sherlock was also painfully aware that Lestrade wanted to speak to him in private and was feeling slightly uneasy. He knew that what he'd said to John was a bit not good, but he just wanted to go home and spend time with John without having to worry about being surrounded by strangers asking probing questions about how he was feeling.
He closed his eyes without even realising as John reciprocated, bringing their lips together again. When they finally separated they both sat very still, foreheads touching, simply looking into one another’s eyes.
As if on cue Anderson showed up, having clearly heard that small revelation Sherlock was trying to avoid. He sauntered over to where Sherlock, John and Lestrade were and addressed himself to John.
John sat down at the table while Sherlock went over to the oven and opened it. He paused as he realized that he needed John's help.
“We cornered him, he hit John and then he got what he deserved,” Sherlock replied quickly, slowly walking towards the road where he could get a cab.
John climbed onto the bed and placed his knees on either side of Sherlock. He smiled down at the detective who returned the gesture enthusiastically. John then leaned down and stared licking Sherlock's neck slowly. He worked his way from one side to the other, taking special care with the detective's pulse point. Sherlock was already writhing beneath him and John had barely gotten started.
He ran to Sherlock, trying to assess his injuries, only to realize that he would have to move the boy out of the way first.
"Yes?" John prompted, trying to quell his rising panic. Sherlock was getting worse by the second. He was becoming more confused and his breathing was too shallow, even considering his probably broken ribs. He needed to get to the hospital now.
Lestrade replied on the other hand, sounding confused. It was only then that John realised it was Sherlock’s phone that had been ringing, and not his own.
When John returned home all traces had been wiped. The kitchen was clean, Mrs Hudson was back in her flat and Sherlock was working away on his laptop.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at John and the doctor chuckled in amusement. He sat up on the bed and gave Sherlock a long lingering kiss. “Happy anniversary.”
"Fine." Sherlock sighed, "I promise I'll try to pay more attentions to the demands of my transport, no matter how utterly dull they may be."
John complied, confident that Sherlock wouldn't do anything that he didn't want him to. He settled his arms along his torso and closed his eyes again. He didn't know what Sherlock had planned, but he was definitely curious. When he felt something cold and liquid on his back he started to get the picture.
A state that Lestrade found himself in now as well, seeing as Sherlock had been stirring for the last couple of hours, showing small signs of waking up. His hands would twitch every so often and his eyes would move under his eyelids. Lestrade had called the nurse already and she had smiled before telling Lestrade not to worry, that it was simply Sherlock slowly waking up.
He was perched on the ledge, his dressing gown slowly slipping off his shoulders, cigarette held between his fingers. For the next fifteen minutes he managed to burn his way through another three cigarettes until he heard a quiet creaking on the stairs. John was awake. He didn't bother trying to hide the cigarette he was currently smoking or the packet that was still in the pocket of his dressing gown. No doubt the scent in the room would inform John as to what he was doing.
Relief flooded through John at those words. It was always difficult to see Sherlock like this, even though he knew it would eventually go away. But pain never seemed like it would, in the moment it always seemed never-ending.
Anderson walked away without another word, no doubt to tell everyone else what he had just discovered. As soon as he left Lestrade started laughing again and John couldn’t help but join in.
“You can call John, if you’d like, to let him know what’s going on. We’ll look after Sherlock,” Matt reassured her. It was always good to keep distressed relatives busy and out of the way. Besides, John might be in a better state to tell them about Sherlock’s health than Mrs Hudson was right now.
They both smiled at the recollection of a former conversation and Sherlock finally opened his eyes. John was staring intently at him, his hand still resting on Sherlock’s cheek. If the perfect moment was ever going to arise Sherlock doubted it would be better than this.
"Good morning." said John, with a teasing smile on his face. Clearly he'd gotten Sherlock's message.
"I do, don't I?” John said, looking down at the detective fondly. He lowered himself so that he could kiss Sherlock. It was one of his favourite things to do, along with cuddling up to Sherlock, tea and chasing criminals through the streets of London. Quite an odd list, but then he always thought normal was overrated.
John gave in, Sherlock’s breathy pleas and quiet moans working at his resolve, and lined himself up before slowly slipping inside Sherlock.
John lifted himself off of Sherlock and went to the bathroom to fetch a wet flannel. By the time he came back into the room Sherlock was completely naked, sitting on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands.
He decided to start his morning routine seeing as nothing would be sorted until Sherlock was up and they could talk. He took his clothes out of the wardrobe and carried them down to the bathroom. After his shower he immediately got dressed and made himself some breakfast. After a quick tidy up around the flat he made two cups of tea.
John trudged up the steps of 221 Baker Street until he reached the door to his room. He walked across to the bed where he promptly collapsed after taking off his coat and shoes. Today had been an extremely long day at the surgery and he was beyond tired. It was days like these when he thought back to the time when he used to run around London with Sherlock- after Sherlock- who was always running off to carry out an experiment or to follow a lead or, most likely, going after the suspect. It was one of the many reasons why John always insisted on going with him. He always followed Sherlock, but now he had gone somewhere where no one could follow.
"Love you too," Sherlock replied, his words slurring slightly and his eyes closing as he fell asleep. He was bone tired, which was annoying seeing as he had spent the last two days essentially sleeping. John, on the other hand, kept his eyes open and chose instead to watch Sherlock sleeping peacefully in his arms.
The wait had been hell. Waiting to reach the hospital, waiting to hear from the doctor, and now waiting for Sherlock to wake up. He'd been sat by his bedside as soon as he'd been allowed in, courtesy of Mycroft, and had barely strayed from the bed, lest Sherlock woke up by himself.
But once he reached the bedroom he realized how tired he really was. He'd managed to catch an hour or two of sleep between now and the time Lestrade had kicked him out of the hospital, but never much more because he'd been worried Sherlock would wake up and John wouldn't hear him, even though he knew how unlikely that was. He decided to sleep for an hour or so before going back to the hospital, Lestrade was with Sherlock and he would call John if he was needed, he might as well take advantage of the situation.
John’s memory took him back a year, remembering coming home and drinking himself into a stupor and seeing Sherlock, wondering whether or not he had really been there. He had no doubts now.
After Lestrade left John turned around to find that Sherlock had finished his dinner. John went upstairs quickly and when he came back he had his medical kit with him.
Sherlock lowered himself into the tub and John followed, resting his back on the detective’s chest once they were both seated. Sherlock was carefully collecting water in his own hands and letting it run down John’s shoulders and arms while John rubbed small circles on Sherlock’s thighs.
Sherlock looked down at his hands, unable to accept John's reasoning. "I want to believe you, John, I truly do. I want to stop hearing that boy's screams, I want to stop seeing his face every time I close my eyes but I can't get him out of my head." Sherlock said desperately.
"What were you thinking about?" John asked. He had always been curious to explore Sherlock's mind, and it was times like these when the detective was calm that he liked to try and gain an insight.
After showering, getting dressed and having breakfast, after John text him reminding him to do so, he went downstairs and knocked on Mrs Hudson's door. She came to the door almost immediately. "What's the matter, Sherlock?"
Having disposed of all his clothes Sherlock pulled the curtain back and looked at John, eyes roaming all over the doctor's body before he finally replied. "Of course I did, John. I did tell you."
Their kisses were needy and sloppy as they made their way up to their room seeing as it was the only room in the house that wasn't littered with evidence. Their clothes slipped off somewhere on their journey upstairs and they fell in bed together.
She fumbled nervously with her bag for a minute before sitting down on one of the chairs. "I heard about what happened, about the accident. I just wanted to make sure you were okay."
John continued kissing him, moving up to the back of Sherlock's neck just to tease him. "Are you complaining?" he countered.
But Sherlock didn’t have time to finish, though John had a pretty good idea what he was about to say when the detective leaned over the toilet and started vomiting.
"Hello to you too, Sherlock." Sherlock rolled his eyes, he was here to work the case, not exchange pleasantries. "Sylvia Jensen, as you know," Lestrade continued, "has been receiving threatening messages for the past three weeks. Today she got a package with no return address. She figured it was from the same person so she called us in."
“Would you like some tea?” Sherlock asked, looking down at John. He had been enraged when John had been taken down, but now that he knew he was going to be okay Sherlock went into his caring mode. It wasn’t often it was required, but there had been a time or two when John had needed him,.
John was still slightly dizzy so Sherlock helped him out of the car and into the flat, faintly calling out a thank you to Lestrade before he drove away.
He went upstairs to get dressed. He pulled his trousers and his shirt on, not bothering to put on his suit jacket. After putting on his shoes he waked down the stairs only to meet John who was blocking his way.
John didn't open his eyes but he heard Sherlock getting changed and then felt the mattress dip slightly when Sherlock got on top of it. He straddled John's hips from behind and started pulling his shirt over his arms.
He spent most of the day seeing patients and only had a small break at lunch where he barely had time to eat. He contemplated texting Sherlock to ask how the case was going but he had been so fixated on it that John doubted Sherlock would even hear his phone. He hadn't seen Sherlock this enthralled in a case for a while and while he was glad that he was busy, he was worried that the detective would once again start ignoring his body's needs.
They ate sitting at their respective desks, both reading the paper. Sherlock was quiet as he read the newspaper, no doubt trying to take in any and all information that might be useful to him and storing it away.
But what he'd felt about the accident was different, more extreme. He'd acted completely out of instinct when he ran forwards and pulled the boy into his arms and out of the way. He didn't even consider the fact that he might himself come to harm, but the sudden realization had hit him when he saw John leaning over him, panic clear in his features. He'd tried to keep his calm and collected manner, his so-called 'doctor mode' but Sherlock saw right through it all. He saw right through it because he knew John, but most of all because he felt the exact same way. He wasn't sure he was going to make it and the thought of leaving John once again was unbearable. He didn't want to think of what John would be like if he died, and he didn't want to leave John. He loved John, and John loved him. It didn't make sense that they should be apart.
He walked in to the living room to see Sherlock staring at him. It was clear he’d heard the question and was simply refusing to answer it. “Sherlock,” John warned.
John collapsed on top of Sherlock trying to bring his breathing back to normal and wanting nothing more than to cuddle up to the man he loved for the rest of the night.
While Mycroft pondered Sherlock's mind, John pondered Sherlock's body. The injuries it had sustained, the ones he'd seen and the ones he couldn't. The ones that would heal and the ones that wouldn't.
"Maybe I wanted it to be true," Sherlock said without hesitation. He had always found John fascinating, but over the months they had spent living together, working together and getting to know each other he had grown very fond of the doctor. John was like no one else Sherlock knew. He was more intelligent than most, he accepted Sherlock for who he was and he awakened something in Sherlock that he thought long buried. A need for praise and company. Now the thought of not having John with him at all times seemed completely unacceptable.
"That reminds me," John continued, "it's time for your medication. Do you want some ice for your ribs as well?"
Sherlock closed his eyes. If John hadn’t seen him in his mind palace several times he might have suspected Sherlock had fallen asleep.
"I don't know where Sherlock is. I've looked for him everywhere. He's not in his room, not in the bathroom or the waiting room or anywhere."
John was so deep in thought that he didn't notice Sherlock had come into his room. He crouched down and took John's hand in his own and turned a worried look upon him. "Are you alright?"
After signing all the papers and collecting Sherlock's medication John draped Sherlock's coat over his shoulders and they got into the car that Mycroft had sent for them.
The detective quickly slipped out of them, along with his pants, and dropped them over the side of the bed. “Your turn.”
"Of course. Thanks so much, Greg," John replied, earnestly. He always knew he could count on Lestrade, and was glad to have a friend by his side.
Hiding the cigarettes from Sherlock. Playing Cluedo to distract him. Calculating strategies with Mycroft. Searching Sherlock's room for drugs.
"He's upstairs," John replied before realizing that his state of near nakedness and the fact that he had clearly just left his room coupled with the divulgence of Sherlock's current location was rather suggestible. He wasn't ashamed of what they'd been doing, and he certainly wasn't ashamed of being with Sherlock, but he had rather hoped to have found a different way to tell Lestrade, who seemed to catch on rather quickly.
Lestrade and Sherlock came back ten minutes afterwards and John jumped up when he saw that Sherlock was leaning heavily on the detective inspector. He walked over to them and helped get Sherlock back into bed before he unleashed his full fury at the consulting detective. "What the fuck were you thinking, Sherlock?" he shouted angrily, "You don't tell the nurses where you're going, you don't tell me where you're going, and you end up on the fucking roof? What the hell were you doing there?"
The address they were going to was right in the centre of London, luckily not far from where they had just come. Baker Street was soon in sight, and they were quickly able to locate the apartment where one Sherlock Holmes needed urgent medical attention. They parked the truck as well as they could, trying to avoid a barrage of angry drivers, and made their way to the back to grab all the equipment they might need. They lugged the numerous bags up the seventeen steps to 221B, the door having been left open for them, and soon located their patient.
It wasn’t long before neither of them could contain their pleasured moans so they kissed, and they kissed, mouths suppressing the noises that they couldn’t until finally they were both quiet, heaving messes on the sheets.
John then turned to Lestrade who was standing by the door looking amused at how quiet Sherlock was. John was probably the only one who could shut him up, and even that only happened occasionally.
This meant that he started his blog up again. When he first logged on since Sherlock's supposed death he had to work his way through a number of messages. He hadn't replied to many but had made a point to post something publicly about how much he appreciated the support.
"Me too, John. Me too," he replied as he snuggled closer to the doctor and wrapped his arms even more tightly around him.
“Today you’re just going to have to put up with it because you’re not finding out anything until you get to the crime scene.”
They hadn't brought that up again, or anything relating to Sherlock's absence, since, but Sherlock knew that John had questions. There were times when they were in bed together that John noticed scars that Sherlock never had before. It was clear by the look in his eyes that he wanted to ask about them, but something held him back every time.
Sherlock waited a few seconds before replying, knowing that John needed some time to reign his feelings in. He felt John's breathing slow down after his slight outburst and continued his explanation. He explained everything that happened that day; the fake phone call to lead John away, what happened on the rooftop with Moriarty, how hard lying on that final phone call had been and finally how he managed to jump from that rooftop without harming himself too much. He kept telling John that he had to make it believable, otherwise Moriarty's men would know he was alive and they would come after John, they would come after everyone.
John woke up relatively early the next morning. During the night, he and Sherlock had become even more entangled with one another and John was trying to carefully extricate himself without waking him up. Finally free, he slipped one of Sherlock's dressing gowns over his pyjamas and walked over to the kitchen and put the kettle on. He searched the fridge for something edible and luckily found some sausages, eggs and bacon, ignoring the wide array of experiments that littered the bottom shelves. Not long after that he heard quiet creaking sounds coming from their room; Sherlock must have woken up and gone to the bathroom. John quickly prepared their breakfast and laid the food out in plates which he then placed on a tray along with the two mugs of tea and made his way back.
He hated seeing Sherlock in pain but he was glad that he was home so John could take care of him. He was so very grateful that Sherlock hadn't tried to hide his pain and had actually allowed John to help him. Sherlock had a tendency of hiding his pain, whether physical or otherwise, in hopes that it would go away by itself but he knew how much pain it caused John not to be able to help, and so he had allowed John to see him stripped bare of any disguise.
Lauren grabbed the bag valve mask and then kneeled behind Sherlock, tilting his head back while Matt administered the adrenaline. She removed the oxygen mask, and after adding more medication covered Sherlock’s mouth with the new one. She deflated the bag, watching carefully as Sherlock’s chest rose and fell with the delivery.
John was listening intently to Sherlock's story, relieved that he had finally given in but worried about what he would learn.
John took his time, kissing and licking and sucking slowly and fervidly, bringing Sherlock to the edge and then pulling him back again, only to prolong the pleasure. It felt good seeing Sherlock so undone; the hitching in his breath, the shifting of his hips, all courtesy of John Watson. Sherlock was always so controlled, but John had finally found a way to make him let go. There was no thinking now, no cases, no deductions, just pure and unabashed pleasure flowing through the two of them.
John smiled, happy to see Sherlock so excited about something. He'd been back for nearly six weeks and so much had happened. John felt like he needed a month's rest from the excitement, just spending some time solving cases with Sherlock with nothing extraordinary happening, but he knew that was too much to ask for.
"Feels good not to have to correct people anymore," said John. There had been countless times where they had been mistaken for a couple and he'd always felt the need to correct people, not that they ever believed him.
"I love you," John said, as Sherlock planted a final soft kiss on his lips and returned to his spot on John's shoulder, utterly content.
John wasn't entirely convinced but didn't question him further. However, the strange evasions continued the next day.
But Sherlock had been cut off from everyone else. He had traveled the world, by himself, going after Moriarty's network. Hiding and running and worrying about John. After living with someone for so long the solitude must have affected him, especially when he was carrying out such a difficult task, and John's heart clenched in sympathy. It would have been easier for both of them if he could have joined Sherlock, but he'd be putting both their lives at risk in doing so.
John was lying in exactly the same position, right in the middle of the bed, so Sherlock slowly nudged him over to his side. He then wrapped the heat pack around the towel to ensure that it didn't burn John's skin and settled it over his back. After turning the lights off he lay on his side of the bed and pulled the sheets up, making sure they covered John completely.
John took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. It was difficult enough as it was to stop himself from just thrusting right into Sherlock, and he was certainly not helping. “I’m not going to rush this and hurt you, I don’t care how much you complain.”
"C'mon, let’s go to bed. We could both use some sleep." John led him upstairs and over to their bed.
Sherlock spent the short taxi ride to the crime scene recalling what little he knew about the case to John. He was itching to get to the crime scene and finally learn all he could about the case and get his mind working again. Lestrade had told him very little, just that a woman named Sylvia Jensen, recently divorced and mother of one, had been receiving threatening messages through the post. Lestrade had called Sherlock in after they cleared all the suspects off their list and the case came to a standstill.
He got up as soon as he heard John close the door and got ready. He had a shower, got dressed and started organizing his case files, even calling Lestrade to collect the ones he had already solved. He cleaned up the living room, which mostly meant piling things up in the corner and removed his experiments from the kitchen- the more mild ones John had allowed- into his old bedroom. When he was satisfied with the state of the living room he started working on the kitchen. His phone went off just as he was about to tackle the body parts in the fridge.
John had heard Sherlock play a number of different melodies on the violin over the time they had lived together, some even that Sherlock had composed himself, but he had never heard this one before, and he’d certainly never seen Sherlock play like this. His eyes were closed and his body was swaying in time with the delicate music being played. Even behind closed eyes John could tell that Sherlock was concentrated solely on the violin and nothing else. It was as though there was nothing and no one else in the room, nothing else in his mind, just the melody.
"Sherlock," he whispered, sounding haggard. "How about we do this later, you need to eat. I brought you breakfast."
Sherlock’s violin had been kept in its old case in the back of his closet during his absence, and John thought it was time for a new one.
Sherlock only managed a slight nod this time, and used what little strength he had left to hold his shirt out of the way. Every time he tried to speak he felt as though there wasn’t enough air in his lungs to get the words out. He wanted to talk to the paramedics and tell them that he’d been sleeping when everything had started, that an annoying cough had awoken him and that Mrs Hudson’s delivery of tea and biscuits may very well have saved his life, because there was no way he would have been able to call for help. But he just couldn’t get the words out. His body was barely getting enough oxygen for him to stay conscious, let alone to hold an intelligent conversation.
"Oh." he was slightly taken aback. He wasn't expecting that answer at all. Perhaps something about murder or strange experiments that fascinated Sherlock, but definitely not him. John was about to ask him what about him when he felt Sherlock shift. The detective was now laying on his front, still draped half over John, and was staring intently into his eyes.
Over the years he had come to learn most of Sherlock’s quirks and his tells, especially when he was ill or in pain and didn’t want John to notice, which of course was impossible, he was a doctor after all. So when John felt Sherlock’s already tense body tense up even more he knew there was something wrong.
When they finally reached the bedroom John threw Sherlock down on the bed and straddled his hips. He covered Sherlock with his own body, careful not to put too much pressure on him, and kissed him. Sherlock grabbed the back on John's neck and deepened the kiss. He felt John moaning against his lips and let go of his neck to bring his hand down to John's trousers where he finally managed to unzip them and started working them down John's hips.
The next couple of days were spent in much the same way. John would make breakfast, which Sherlock would eat without complaint, and they would spend the rest of the day watching telly or on their laptops. After dinner they would cuddle up on the sofa or in bed, not doing much of anything, just spending time together.
John settled down on the sofa watching telly, too wired to sleep, but too tired to do anything else. Sherlock would be spending the rest of the night on his experiments, but unlike before he was perfectly aware of John's presence. Whenever John got up to get his laptop or a book or even just to go to the bathroom he could see Sherlock lift his eyes slightly off the microscope and follow him around the room until he returned to his seat on the sofa.
Sherlock spared them only a quick glance before going back to looking at the woman. He was clearly in distress, one hand clutching at his unbuttoned shirt and the other at the woman’s hand. But she soon moved behind Sherlock, giving the paramedics enough space to spread out their equipment and do what they needed to do.
"No, Sherlock," John said firmly, "I'm sorry, but we're doing this now. I won't stand by and watch you fall apart."
It was at that point that both parents seemed to realize that their child was not where they thought, and they started sweeping the scene in search of him. Sherlock was stopped by a brief second when he saw the mother's eyes widen. He quickly turned around and saw that the boy was walking towards the road where a car was coming at a considerable speed.
For a brief second John looked over at Sherlock. The detective was standing in front of the thief, his legs parted slightly allowing for greater balance and the ability to lunge at the man should the opportunity arise. Clearly he was thinking the same thing as John.
“You’ll see in a minute,” Sherlock replied. He then realised that John was leaning on his chair with one of his hands behind his back. “What are you hiding?”
Sherlock covered John’s hand with his own, lightly rubbing it with his thumb, until finally he grabbed it and placed it over the back of his neck.
John smirked. He’d been wondering exactly how long it would take until Sherlock asked about details of the case. He might have been reluctant to get out of bed but he was definitely interested in the case. “It’s a surprise.”
"I just woke up, and there's nothing to do here. If you wish to stay I would not be opposed," he continued. He really could use some company. Between the pain and the haze of the medication he had nothing to do, especially since John wasn't here. Even though he wanted John with him he was glad the doctor was getting some much needed rest.
