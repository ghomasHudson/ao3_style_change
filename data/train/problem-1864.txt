“Maybe I could even use girls’ names.”
“Maybe because you keep crying, love.”
“I know that all of this—,” John began, moving impossibly closer, “this vulnerability, this intimacy—can’t be easy for you, letting down your guard like this. After all that’s happened between us and the things I’ve done, your past with Alex and everything, you are still willing to let go of your fears, to open up to me, to let me try and love you. And I think that’s remarkably… brave.”
After struggling with the buttons for a minute, John carefully peeled the shirt from his shoulders and let it, too, drop to the floor. Easing Sherlock’s nerves with a few tender kisses, he brought their bare chests closer until skin melted into skin and their body warmth amalgamated. Letting his hand trail down Sherlock’s spine to relax him before unbuttoning his trousers next, both suddenly froze as John’s fingertips ran over ridges and bumps on their otherwise smooth path.
And eventually, his curiosity gets the best of him.
“How. Often. Sherlock,” John stressed every word, his voice now bearing the authority of his former rang as captain. This normally worked only on ordinary people but Sherlock’s defences wore thin tonight.
But you can’t.
Maybe it’s just ordinary, boring hunger.
“Have you any funny stories about John?” Sherlock asks, genuine concern edged into his voice.
Whatever’s led Sherlock to write this letter—and apparently smuggle it into his pocket—it must be important if it can’t be spoken or texted. Maybe Baker Street is under observation again and this is the only safe means of communication.
And if he froze to death somewhere on these all too familiar streets it wouldn’t matter much, would it? He knew enough silent corners where no one would find him until his suffering was over. Or at least, where no one would stumble over his half-frozen body by accident. If someone actually made an effort to find him, there were people who could. But no one cared enough to go looking for him on a bleak January night, not anymore. Glorious images rose in front of his mind’s eye: a desperate John spotting him in an empty alley just in time, tending to his pale, cool figure with tears of regret in his eyes; John reviving him with his own body warmth, kissing life into lips blue from hypothermia. Sherlock wiped them off with a guttural howl that made two passers-by jump back with alarmed faces.
He feels nauseous. And he prays that after today, Sherlock sticks to something as harmless as a cigarette.
“If anything… Just call, will you?” Mycroft fixated Sherlock, words thick with worry, and, to John’s astonishment, Sherlock simply nodded and gave his brother a sad little smile instead of a snarky remark. John’s insides coiled into a tight knot. If the Holmes brothers didn’t even squabble anymore… This was bad. This was wrong. Why had Mycroft been here in the first place? What had his presence prevented from happening?
“It’s Greg, he might have a case for us.”
There’s nothing in his inbox.
“Let me get this straight: If some random guy hadn’t stopped you, I would be planning another one of your funerals right now?” John said, his voice enhanced by the wave of belated panic that swept through him and mixed with the fury—equally directed at Sherlock and himself.
Her husband put his arm around her shaking shoulders and continued the story: “She called for me. You could definitely see a body sitting behind the shed, so we went outside together. We thought that maybe a homeless person had tried to find shelter from the snow in our garden or… but it was Jason.”
John tries to shake off the thought and digs his hands deep into his pockets against the cold. Rosie’s little winter hat tickles his chin. Naturally, she has long fallen asleep—unimpressed by all of John’s endeavours to keep her awake in hope to get her to sleep through the night.
Now, that he’s sitting in a pub with a Sherlock he hardly recognizes, all but bursting into song about John’s strength, compassion, and overall perfection, something begins to dawn on Greg.
“Like kissing their best man?” Sherlock asks caustically.
John opens his mouth after a few tense seconds but now the emergency protocol in Sherlock’s brain finally gains traction. “Listen, John,” he says, before John can form words, “I didn’t mean for you to see it, not like this. I don’t know what Lestrade was thinking but I can assure you I had nothing to do with it. He was absolutely right when he told me not to do it. I would never want to get between you and Mary.”
Filled with a sudden wave of fearlessness, Sherlock asked: “Can I try?”
How should he know?
The plane lifts off the ground and John leans back in his seat. It’s a wonder they’re able to take off with all the extra weight of his thoughts pulling on him. He tries to shove them up into the luggage compartment but as soon as he loosens his grip they fall back onto his head.
John stares at Greg, then at the envelope in his hand.
In hindsight, it seems so obvious and John finds he’s annoyed with himself for not having taken the first step, for lacking the courage Sherlock has displayed with this confession.
“It’s alright,” he says, gently running his thumb over the soft skin just below John’s hairline. “It’s okay.”
Sherlock’s proximity and his manic energy when working cases had proved helpful in overcoming depression once before, so John fell back into tried and tested patterns. Sherlock didn’t tire of assuring him how welcomed he was and John assured him of his gratefulness in return. Eventually, life found a way to restore some form of normality.
“But I do.”
“But I don’t.” The three little syllables hung in the air between the two men and glistened with hope. John’s heart nearly stumbled over them and made him hold his breath for a second.
Rosie’s little hands fisted in his shirt and John turned his head to place gentle kisses on her forehead until her cries slowly ebbed away.
His face must have adumbrated at least a part of his thoughts, going by Mrs. Hudson’s sympathetic grin. “Don’t worry, Sherlock dear, we won’t stay long. You boys have the flat to yourselves again in no time. Now, I’m gladder than ever that I’ve got those noise-cancelling headphones,” she said with a giggle and let Molly top off her glass. Mycroft sent Sherlock another of his taunting looks. “Otherwise I probably wouldn’t be getting a wink of sleep tonight. I remember how things were when Frank and I got engaged. It was such a rush, we couldn’t stop—”
Then, Rosie grabbed her plushie and shoved it against John’s chest. “Jawm,” she repeated assertively. She looked at them both, clearly urging them to stop their nauseating display of affection and instead continue entertaining her. John gave in to her wishes. How could he not?
“The snow, the rain, don’t you see? The suspect couldn’t stand the idea of Jason lying out in the cold, being slowly snowed up. So, they struggled to get him over to the shed, the only place in the garden that could provide some shelter. Their efforts were in vain since the wind turned but still… Look. They sat him up here like he was still alive. That is textbook remorse, don’t you think?”
But any resolution to try and be a good husband John has made previously is now being drowned out by the constant, lingering presence of Sherlock’s mystery message.
“Did you hear me?” John asks at length as Sherlock still doesn’t move, and he makes a few tentative steps towards him. “I love you, Sherlock.”
“Promise you won’t take it the wrong way?”
He had not attended his father’s funeral. He had lain under the burning Afghan sun, covered in dust and sweat and fear, while Geoff Watson had become part of the earth again. His superiors had offered him special leave but John had declined.
Sherlock giggled. “You’re free to make up for any missed opportunities as soon as you’re fully recovered. We could keep a tab if you want.”
He should’ve kept this shut out, locked up in a vault deep down in the cellar of his mind palace.
On the other hand, John relied heavily on him after Sherlock’s fake suicide. He trusted him. He called Greg up, usually late at night, drunk and crying. Greg didn’t know how to handle that either and now he feels that he definitely failed the test.
Sherlock’s head jerked back as if John had just slapped him across the face. He turned back around and looked at the older man, aware that every inch of his body was now radiating the hurt and heartbreak this last blow had caused him. John’s eyes met his with stony inexpressiveness. This was it. Without another word, Sherlock grabbed his coat from the hook and left the flat.
He sat up a little and rubbed his face.
He is just approaching the bar to get beers for him and Eileen when John, obviously a few pints ahead of him, comes shoving through the dancing crowd.
As he unlocks the front door and steps into the familiar hall, John can already hear the music floating down the staircase from their flat. He tries to remember the last time it has been quiet when he came home. Will there still be music in their new flat? Will the songs still sound the same without Sherlock?
Sherlock clung to him as if John and the incandescent future he had just offered him would vanish into thin air as soon as he loosened his grip. An apparently inexhaustible stream of happy tears rolling down his cheeks, he covered every inch of John he could reach with wet kisses until John pulled back his head from Sherlock’s shoulder and met his lips. It was messy—laughter exchanged through open mouths, tongues exploring the environment changed by their life-altering promise, their salty tears seasoning the unique taste they created together—but it was the best kiss yet.
“What note?”
Yes, what if—what if
As painful as the confrontation had been, with Sherlock throwing all his sharp, crimson secrets at John—how he had suffered, how John constantly hurt him with his pursuit of women—John was incredibly thankful that Sherlock’s walls had cracked at last. Who knew if John himself would ever have worked up the courage to tell his friend and roommate how he really felt? Without Sherlock’s violent outburst, he might have never been able to confront himself and his family with his bisexuality. But all the baggage he and Sherlock both carried had been unpacked and was now safely stored in an attic where it hopefully wouldn’t stand in the way of their relationship, their future.
As the couple straightened up, he shot Sherlock a look, asking for his approval. Behind their sofa, Greg slowly paced up and down, his nervous energy itching on the back of Sherlock’s neck like a persistent bug crawling up the length of his spine. Having his superior sitting here obviously took its toll on him.
He heaved a heavy breath. “I… I could’ve lost you today. Just because I let my judgement be clouded. Ever since you and Rosie have been at Baker Street—I—I just find it hard to keep sentiment out of the equation.”
The next second, a deafening bang slit the room in half.
There aren’t that many possible messages this video can contain and, yet, John doesn’t want to imagine a single one.
John picks it up, smooths it out as best he can and finally reads it.
“John, thank God,” she said, hands raised in a worried gesture. At her words, his heartbeat sped up another notch.
The two of them, years ago—deducing John from his phone—their first cab ride—explaining his thought processes, convinced to reap disdain—instead John’s praise:
Sherlock gave her a bright, toothy smile. “Thanks, Sally. I’d like to sniff and dig around a bit first, you know, like a good boy.”
He woke with a start, knowing that the bed beside him was empty before even opening his eyes. Milky thorns of sunlight crept through the curtains, illuminating sleep- and sex-muddled sheets but just one body underneath them. John rubbed his eyes. When opening them again, nothing about the room had changed. The second pillow next to him remained vacant.
“You got what?!”
Mrs. Beaumont snivelled and finally removed the handkerchief from her face. “I… I came down the next morning—”
“Of course, I meant it. Every word,” Sherlock rasped out. Why was his heart pounding so fast? When John gave him a doubtful smile, he added: “John, you are amazing, how do you not know that? You’re an amazing doctor and a great father. You’re irreplaceable as an assistant and a friend. You’re talented and smart and funny and understanding and basically every good thing I could never manage to be. I never dreamed that someone like you would even consider putting up with someone like me. And yet, after all we’ve been through, you are still here and you are still as amazing as ever.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t want to terminate our friendship,” John says with the tiniest shake of his head. He sets his tea down and rubs his forehead. “I just wish you would’ve told me sooner.”
If it were anyone else Greg would have joined in everyone’s teasing. But this is Sherlock. He doesn’t work that way, being too far evolved to listen to his carnal nature or to give in to what he so lovingly calls
s and ‘
“Honey?”
“So, you knew then?”
“Mary found me when I had nothing else to hold on to,” he continues, “and she was kind and funny and good to me. I didn’t know you’d come back. I’ve begged every force in the universe to bring you back to me but I had no hope left that you’d return. Mary helped me move on. She understood even if I never told her what I felt for you. She understood and she was okay with it. She didn’t give up on me and I wanted to make her happy in return, to do the right thing. When you showed up at that restaurant I was sure I was just imagining your face, the way I had done a thousand times before. And when I realised that it was you, really you, I got so angry because I had you back the second I knew I had missed my chance. I was engaged and Mary was so happy and I wanted to believe I was, too. I couldn’t let myself feel about you this way again, not after everything that happened. But I knew… deep down I knew I was being a coward, making the wrong decision. And now there’s a child tangled up in all of his and I—I… I’m so bloody scared, I can’t think straight. I’ve always tried to do the right thing, the proper thing but… I don’t want this anymore. I can’t do this anymore.”
“How would you feel about…,” John began hesitantly, “about having another baby?”
“What makes you think that?”
. “You don’t mean that, love.”
Our boys are moving back together, hurray!
“’Course I do,” said John, barely conscious. A minute later his breaths were already so deep and steady that Sherlock was sure he had fallen asleep. His own transport, however, didn’t allow him to drift off that easily. John’s words still rang in his head, demanding a revaluation of the evening’s development; Compliments were useful to display affection and appreciation after all. Sherlock would just have to apply them regularly so John knew he was being serious. That wasn’t that hard. There were thousands and thousands of little positive things Sherlock noticed about John and just never found the necessity—or the nerves—to utter.
Greg came barging in on their domestic bliss a couple of hours later, accompanied by Molly. The traces of last night’s troubles had been washed away by sleep and good news.
Sherlock grinned. “A thing or two.”
“Anything else? Any clues where to look for this mystery boy? Or why he fled the scene when Jason collapsed?”
Sherlock was clean but set on a hardly less destructive path, taking case after case, barely sleeping, eating only every few days. He looked thinner and more worn-out by the minute and John didn’t say anything. He fought his own demons.
“Your John? That is more than good enough for me.” John’s voice, as soft as the thickening snowfall, echoed in Sherlock’s ears, the only sound still audible, the only one that mattered. “Do you know… I’ve always hated my name except when you say it… the way you pronounce it—it always makes it sound so special.”
“I haven’t done this in a while, talk to someone’s grave I mean,” he began, eyes fixed on the ground. His voice, as small as it was, still resounded from the trees sheltering them from the world outside of this bitterest of family reunions. This small piece of graveyard, tinged with the pink of the rising sun, existed in a different reality, John was sure. He turned to the grave on the right, to the frozen solid earth where his father’s remains lay, still claiming authority over him. John cleared his throat and adopted the defensive stance impending danger called for, shoulders broad, feet securely rooted on the footpath.
“Oh, ok.” John simply smiled and risked a glance at Sherlock’s throbbing erection next to his own. “Well, if you want me to… I could try to take care of you.”
, he sometimes even missed his damn experiments. Sharing a flat with Sherlock was always challenging, sometimes nerve-racking, but never quiet, never boring. Now, when Rosie had gone to sleep, John often found his own home to be unbearably… peaceful.
“So I can put my number in,” Kristen said while typing digits with swift fingers and smirking confidently. “Give me a call when you want someone to accompany you and Rosie on your next stroll.”
In the bathroom, water is running, and Sherlock hurries back to his armchair before John opens the door again.
Still, he decides to make use of the agreeable weather and walk. It’s quite a significant distance he has to cover, at least an hour on foot, but it’s not like he’s got anywhere else to be.
“Then why not aim for the hedge, roll him under the bushes? His mother found the body the very next morning. Look at the outline of the body—You must’ve been able to see his leg sticking out from the terrace there.”
Crap telly. He can’t believe he’s stooping so low without being forced.
A flash of panic—or excitement—struck Sherlock’s brain at the sudden realization that people usually kissed the second the new year began. But John wouldn’t, would he? Would he turn around and kiss Stella? And what was Sherlock supposed to do? Before he could calculate the chances for either scenario, everyone started counting down from ten.
John took the hint and answered with the same voice he had used on the new recruits when the harsh reality of war threatened to overwhelm them. “Cal, my name is Dr. John Watson, and this is Sherlock Holmes. We’re not gonna harm you but you have to put down the gun now, okay?”
I hope all of you who ship Mystrade won't rip my head off :D As much as I love that ship, I just couldn't resist a little Mollstrade in this setting, just because I can't get Lestrade's reaction to Molly's glorious Christmas outfit in ASIB out of my head--I mean, his eyes literally popped out! :D
Sherlock stayed where he was, a bit lost surrounded by all those strangers, until Stella Hopkins approached him together with a red-haired man at about Sherlock’s height she introduced as her friend Marcus. His remarkably symmetric features paired with a strong jawline and bright brown eyes would probably be considered attractive, Sherlock thought. What gained his attention, however, was the odd mixture of amusement and nonchalant boredom that Marcus radiated. And he just laughed at one of the deductions that slipped Sherlock’s nervous lips.
Sherlock opened the note and stared down at John’s scribbled handwriting:
It is also one where listening to the song provided is firmly recommended (if you're not into electro at all, just skip it. The lyrics are included and really say everything you need to know).
But without proper resistance the engines overheat and compose a cacophony of screeches and hisses.
“No, just waiting for someone, thank you,” John said, reciprocating her smile politely.
Unfortunately, the freezer yields nothing but a few left-over toes and a bag of peas, so Sherlock rummages through the cupboards instead until he finds a box of expensive pralines, undoubtedly from some grateful client or other.
He likes sex, always has. And with Mary, it’s easy, uncomplicated.
John felt Sherlock relax on the sofa next to him as the movie progressed. From time to time, he would tilt his head in thought or fidget a little but, overall, he seemed quite content. John fought a grin creeping up on his lips at Sherlock’s fruitless attempts to look cool and disinterested.
“You’re not done yet,” came his disappointed voice and his lips pursed into a pout that John quickly kissed away.
Sherlock has mulled over these words, has stretched and turned and compressed them until he had wrung the last bit of meaning from them.
Every night from then on, they closed the distance a little further, one inch, one bit of skin at a time. Sherlock’s fingers crept up John’s arm, barely moving a millimeter per minute, found their way around his waist the next night, onto his back, until the two of them were finally tightly aligned in an unfamiliar hug. They no longer left before dawn now but untangled their bodies with the first rays of early morning light breaking through the curtains, still not a word about last night leaving their lips.
Sherlock, of course, was intrigued by the tricky case (he would have taken positively any distraction that day, pondered John) and, before he knew it, they put their suitcases in the trunk of the small rental car Sherlock had organized and off they were to the coast. Sherlock spent the three-hour ride almost completely in silence, already contemplating theories, John guessed, while he was stuck with nothing to do but stare out the window.
Justin Nozuka, After Tonight.
A warm hand was placed on his shoulder, squeezing lightly, giving all the reassurance Sherlock needed.
Now, he was sitting on his armchair, his eyes closed in concentration, contemplating his further course of action. John would certainly want to talk about all of this eventually and he needed to be prepared. “Gather data and derive the logical solution,” said a voice in his head that annoyingly resembled Mycroft’s. Sherlock shook his head to get rid of it, yet, followed the instruction.
“What names would you like to call me?” John replied with a mischievous grin and a sparkle in his eyes that made Sherlock’s knees a little wobbly. He quickly raised his gaze to the thickening clouds overhead.
“You wouldn’t go and find someone else, would you?” John whispered and halted his movements for a second.
Mumford and Sons, Holland Road.
“Dr. Watson,” Mycroft replied, raising his eyebrows at John in what seemed to be genuine surprise. Something about him was off, although John couldn’t quite put his finger on it. “What brings you here?”
“Yeah, he was barefoot. Seems pretty weird in the freezing cold out.”
He was roused from this most peculiar feeling by Sherlock that hurried him to get rid of their suitcases so they could finally start working. John rolled his eyes at him but obeyed his orders with the smallest of grins on his lips as soon as the other man had turned around again. Sherlock’s manic energy when there was a mystery to unravel was still as intoxicating as the day John had first met him.
“I’m glad you could make it,” John said as Harry reached his table and pulled him into an awkward hug. Even her thick winter coat couldn’t hide how much her wing bones stuck out beneath John’s fingers. Harry had always been thin, bordering on anorexic, and John hadn’t expected anything to have changed. Year after year, he had tried to address this subject and it had only estranged them further. At one point, he had decided to stop nagging her about her weight, just as he didn’t comment on her drinking anymore. She was an adult and capable of her own decisions, even if she still radiated the relentless energy and spite of a snotty teenager. Harry never played by anyone else’s rules and John had to accept that. Yet, he sucked in the air as she doffed her coat and revealed the frame beneath. She looked so fragile with her ash blonde waves bouncing around a prominent collar bone and hollow cheeks. Her waist was so tiny that John thought he’d be able to wind both hands around it with his fingers still touching each other.
John and Sherlock looked at each other in open and unapologetic adoration. “Well, that we are,” Sherlock said and bend down a little to kiss John again, a heavenly confirmation. John’s eyes fell shut as Sherlock’s lips met his, endorphins running in his bloodstream like a stampede of tiny elephants. The world around him drowned out again, all his senses fixed on Sherlock.
“I won’t say no to that. But what did you mean with trust?”
It’s quintessential Sherlock to have left the wedding, without saying goodbye, without a sign of life. He had gotten it over with and vanished at the very first opportunity.
?! I haven’t dated that many. And those relationships didn’t really last that long… So, even though I always wanted to try I just… never dared to ask, to be honest.”
“And that’s why you fought?” Molly broke the silence, with the most tender tinge of concern in her voice.
“Sure, we do,” John objects. “We used to hang out all the time, before…when—”
“Listen,” John began again, “I know you are nervous because you don’t usually do this. That’s fine, really. I haven’t gone out with a man before either, especially not with a man I’ve been madly in love with for years without having the courage to do something about it. This is all new for me, too, okay? We can figure this out together.”
“I didn’t see it. I knew I missed something but I just… didn’t see it.” Sherlock raised his head to meet Lestrade’s impenetrable gaze. The DI hadn’t said a thing since Sherlock had started talking, not even to interrupt his retelling of the caresses in the alley. All tired eyes and unshaven chin, he still looked at Sherlock now, waiting for him to continue.
He will never touch alcohol again, John solemnly promises himself. What was he thinking to drink this much? He isn’t twenty anymore. Nights like these basically qualify as a suicide attempt.
“Dramatic?
“Nope,” Sherlock says, popping the p.
I wanted to thank you all for accompanying me thus far, making this journey such an amazing experience for me--as a writer and as a person. You all have a very special place in my heart <3
“No watching?” John instantly asked, his hand continuing to console Sherlock’s burning skin.
That John was the one driving them back from Norfolk was nothing short of extraordinary. But the last two days had been nothing if not extraordinary. Usually, he would refrain from even discussing the matter with Sherlock and simply hop on the passenger’s seat since the alternatives were far less pleasurable: Either they would have a row over whose turn it was and fighting with Sherlock was seldom worth the outcome; or John would stand up to him and then would have to endure a car ride with a pouty Sherlock that constantly criticized every single aspect of his driving style. His friend was certainly a man with a multitude of incredible talents but riding shotgun was not one of them.
The DVD itself isn’t labelled either. Just a silver circle, reflecting the light in rainbow-coloured beams.
A sad smile flickered over Harry’s face. “At least for some people.” Her voice carried the usual air of confident truculence but John didn’t miss the undertones of bitterness that tinged her demeanour now.
There are a few ‘experimental’ pieces Mrs Hudson has forbidden him to play (
“That’s lovely, Sherlock,” John’s voice sounded softly as Sherlock paused for a second, guiding Sherlock out of his own head, filled with odes to John, John, John.
“I didn’t—,” Greg protests but Sherlock nearly trips over the umbrella stand and Greg grudgingly decides that carrying Sherlock upstairs is preferable to taking him to the hospital with a broken leg. “Fine.”
He’s been such a horrible friend to Sherlock lately.
“Are you two stranded?” she asked kindly and stopped, panting slightly.
Something Sherlock meant to give him?
. He’s as close to being a computer as humanly possible, as he’s always eager to tell anyone who’s willing to listen.
His fingers freeze around the remote they’ve been playing with.
No decent person would be this terrified, John thinks remorsefully and tries to swallow. His mouth is as dry as a desert and his skin feels hot and decidedly too tight.
The thought astonishes John. It’s the last thing he thought he’d ever worry about. It has never been an issue before.
“John?!” Sherlock blurted out in surprise, his brain too weighed down by vodka to stop him. Molly and Greg exchanged a half-concerned, half-amused look.
Gentle but persistent hands led Sherlock into the kitchen. The cosiness of the flat engulfed him with an unfamiliar intensity as if his body had already forgotten what warmth felt like. He collapsed on one of the chairs around the dining table and buried his face in his palms. The motion felt like a déjà vu. Over six years ago, he had sat in this exact spot, in the same position, with a similar weight pressing the air out of his lungs. Over six years ago, he had sat at Molly Hooper’s dining table and mourned his own death—the fall that had ripped him from John’s side, maybe forever. Back then, he had left John to ensure his safety. There had been no other way. Now, John had cast him out. Because Sherlock had finally disclosed the nature of his deep affection for him. And because he didn’t feel the same for Sherlock.
John has never looked more handsome—or happier. Sherlock’s heart flutters.
“I’m just planning a little surprise is all.” John grins. “Oh, and would you mind watching Rosie today?”
“What makes you think that?” How could such a beautiful, brilliant man deem himself unlovable?
Mrs. Hudson’s face lit up in a knowing and somewhat relieved grin. “Oh, my two idiot boys. Finally! I thought we’d never get here.”
“Yes.” John’s arm around Sherlock’s waist tightens. “After reading your letter… all these wonderful things you said. I should’ve done that. Earlier, I mean. Years ago. I should’ve told you.”
Although she had thought it so loudly that it shouldn’t count as being quiet, Sherlock remembers and his nose curls in aversion.
“Okay,” John smiled and settled on the floor to his feet, “and you chose this one because it’s Christmas?”
John stares at him, a sinking feeling in his stomach, before the sight fully enters his brain.
The three of them shared a pretty messy snack—Rosie insisted on feeding John and Sherlock some of her whole grain cereal with clumsy little hands—and were just setting up a little playground for the toddler on the sitting room floor, consisting of some of those educational and sensory stimulating toys Sherlock had insisted on getting her, when John’s phone buzzed. It was still in the pocket of his jacket, haphazardly draped over the little side table by the door. Sherlock’s greatcoat piled next to it on the floor, evidence of the passion that had found its way into 221B last night.
Sherlock picks up another praline, one of those with a salted honey caramel filling, and feels the aching behind his sternum subdue a little as the flavour blossoms in his mouth.
“I can’t believe Rosie’s already talking,” Sherlock mumbled against John’s neck, already half-way off to sleep. “She’s growing up so fast.”
Now that his eyes adapted to the semi-darkness, John could see the drops of sweat pearling above Cal’s mouth.
Sherlock is hanging over his shoulder like a sack of cement as Greg drags him up the stairs. He decides to skip his football training session tonight. This is enough exercise for one day.
If he only had a case he could work on. He picked up his laptop from the desk and searched through his inbox. Over twenty new messages from potential clients seeking his help and advice popped up. Sherlock skimmed them quickly; simple and rudely obvious cases of adultery, a few burglaries, a missing person or two. Boring, boring,
“She told me last Christmas at my parents’ before you arrived,” Sherlock continued. “I thought it would be a nice way to… I don’t know… honour her, maybe. Let her be part of this. Remind Rosie of her mother.”
John’s eyes kept springing back and forth between Sherlock and the tiny, golden ring. “Okay, makes sense but… why a ring?”
At last, Greg pulls a square envelope out of his jacket pocket. “I’ve got something for you. From Sherlock. He wanted to give it to you the night before the wedding but I told him not to. I thought it best if you don’t see it but after what you’ve said at the wedding…”
“You don’t?” he susurrated, his voice having lost all strength in his confession.
Sherlock’s knees almost give out at the sound of these words he never thought to hear like this but, now that they hang in the air between them, there can be no doubt about their truthfulness.
Sherlock steps further into the room and lets his gaze roam over this extraordinary display. On the kitchen table, among another dozen candles, stands a cooler with a bottle of champagne next to two glasses. Sherlock is also sure he has spotted a gigantic box of pralines from his favourite chocolaterie.
“Mycroft let a Doctor take care of it the next day when I was back in London but the tissue was too damaged.”
he thought before he drifted off.
John pounced on him, arms spread out, begging his body to bridge the gap to the boy who suddenly seemed miles and miles away.
Sherlock halts and listens carefully.
Shouting and cheering filled the flat at his words. “You’re engaged, oh my God, you’re engaged! Congratulations!”
John now stood so close that Sherlock’s relieved breath ghosted over his skin. Ever so cautiously, he let his fingers close around Sherlock’s and felt him tense minutely under his touch. John looked up and saw something in those iridescent eyes short-circuiting. Before he could do or say anything else, Sherlock collapsed into his arms, his exhaustion finally overwhelming him, dragging him into unconsciousness. John’s knees almost gave out as the unexpected weight of Sherlock’s body hit him but he managed to lower both of them carefully to the floor, steadying Sherlock's head with one hand on the back of his neck.
John could only wonder when Sherlock had had the time to organise all that. He had never told him where he had been on rehab, if it was indeed the same place he had gotten Cal into, but John suspected that the clinic came as close to a spa retreat as one could imagine—at least for someone like Cal.
The dreams usually followed a simple structure: Sherlock regained consciousness in a dark and oddly featureless room, chained to the back wall. Mere feet away from him, yet too far to touch, lay John, chained up as well. He gave Sherlock a frightened look before a dark figure entered the room and approached John. Then, the worst part began. Sherlock had to sit there on the floor while John was being methodically tortured before his eyes. Sometimes it was Moriarty, sometimes Mary, sometimes the latest murderer they had caught together. Completely immobilized, Sherlock had to watch his friend bleed and suffer. And it was
“How?”
“Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, thank you for coming. Please, make yourselves comfortable,” he said, gesturing to the sofa opposite. “I had hoped to make your acquaintance some time sooner… and under less painful circumstances. DI Lestrade speaks very highly of you and, of course, your success rate is unparalleled. I’m aware that my predecessor didn’t exactly... make you feel welcome on the force—but let me assure you that your assistance is very much appreciated, especially now that we’re personally relying on your combined genius to disclose how our son…”
It’s obvious why her policy has changed so suddenly.
“Oh, I’m alright, better than alright. I am great.”
Sherlock raised his head, his piercing eyes almost affronted. “He was dangerous! Look what he did to you. It was pure luck that he didn’t hit any vital organs or…” He swallowed heavily. “It was me who pushed him to this extreme in the first place, with the whole nocturnal chase. Because I was so sure that Cal had stolen from his boyfriend and let him die to not get caught. I saw the pictures of Jason lying in the snow and all I could think of was Rosie. If someone had treated her the same way, pretended to love her just to let her down like this… I was so eager to catch the one responsible myself. And then, when we visited the Rowleys, I saw the abuse springing out from every corner and, again, everything inside my head screamed about Rosie, about how someone had to protect these kids, how I had to protect them.”
He placed a tender kiss on Sherlock’s forehead—
Greg doesn’t dare look at Sherlock.
John didn’t move or make a sound. There was too much unspoken pain for words to salve. He could put two and two together why Sherlock was so deeply affected by this case but he would never dare to address the topic if Sherlock didn’t broach it first. He would just hold him, comfort him, be there for him. Always.
Sherlock just shook his head. He wouldn’t ruin this. And maybe the game would reveal other interesting facts about John. That alone was reason enough to stay.
Sherlock examined her closely; the way her cheaply coloured hair framed her turgid, starkly rouged cheeks; the company-issued t-shirt that clung to her sinewy body; the nicotine-stained fingernails. His voice dropped to menacing depths as he cocked his head and said: „Did you seriously just try to shame him for buying formula for his child?”
“Sherlock, please, slow,” Mycroft pled in a voice Sherlock only recognized from his darkest memories. “You’re hyperventilating. Deep breaths now. Follow me: In. Out. In. Out.”
The thought is feather-edged and cumbersome to handle.
As much fun as they had had, John regretted every single drop of alcohol he had consumed the next morning. His thumping head and dried out mouth reminded him all the more why he didn’t usually go out like this anymore. And his tolerance must’ve declined considerably since his partying days; he could hardly remember anything at all. There were just shreds of conversation, images, and sensations scattered about his brain—some of them so absurd that he was sure he must’ve dreamed them. John tried to piece them back together but they just frazzled at the seams and slipped from his grasp. The mental effort made him nauseous.
Sherlock furrowed his brow at the sudden change of mood, his eyes trailing off, looking for the step he had just missed. Hesitatingly, he said: “Yesterday, when you went out. The internet offers quite a few insightful sources on all kinds of matters and I thought this—”
Sherlock’s brain, however, had shut off somewhere along the way, overwhelmed by the myriad of impressions. Its ever-present flow of deductions, observations, calculations had been reduced to a low humming, barely more than white noise. Sherlock gripped it tightly at the edges and pulled it back into focus. He couldn’t just let this experience wash over him in half-delirium. He needed to take all of it in, consciously, attentively, had to soak up every last bit of critical information and lock it away in his skull forever. He needed to add the images of John’s golden skin to the walls of his mind palace, needed to store the sound of his moans, the feeling of his lips, his musky scent engulfing him.
John and Sherlock share a quick look.
Laney kept crying and Donovan gestured for the three men to leave them alone for the time being.
For a second, he hesitates, reliving the torment of cold turkey. It had been the right decision to quit, back then. Is this worth a relapse, ruining all his progress and starting anew? Is it worth going through the same ordeal again?
John’s lips twitched before he could help it.
She pursed her lips into a tight smile. Her voice thinly masking her condescension, she said: “Someone’s a little fussy, I see, being out this late. You know that breastfeeding is actually much better for your child, don’t you? For their immune system and—”
But wasn’t there another sound? Something beeping? Hurried steps on the stairs? A door banging open? Someone shrieking?
“It was the easiest beverage to calculate,” Sherlock said. “And it’s… what men drink on such occasions, isn’t it?”
Still, he is definitely not ready to face John like this, unprepared and vulnerable. He needs to get him to leave, to come back when his thoughts aren’t a tangled mess anymore.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice had an unsettling quality to it.
John’s stomach curls in on itself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Aren’t you supposed to wait three days to contact a woman after she’s given you her number?” Sherlock was tempted to smirk in sight of John’s obvious uneasiness but somehow the smile got stuck behind his lips. Instead, the stupid sting in his chest returned, now just as vigorous as at the park.
! John is sure he has heard it right this time. The syllable rings in his ears, echoes in his chest, lets every sinew in his body vibrate with alarming anticipation. He can’t move. Glued to the spot, he just keeps watching the two most important people in his life, both completely immersed in their little show. Rosie giggles satisfied as Sherlock kneels down in front of the sofa in an overly dramatic fashion, clutching his heart with one hand.
The rest of the evening was spent in relative quietude while both men dwelled on their own thoughts. At half past ten, John got up and made his way to the bath- and then the bedroom. Sherlock gave him the usual ten-minute head start before he followed suit. As he entered the bedroom,
“Oh.” John pulled at the fabric, a little embarrassed to have overstepped like this. He hadn’t even noticed. By now, all of their clothes smelled the same.
“Never have I ever send nudes,” said Tara and this time Sherlock hesitantly raised his cup again. Somehow the lemonade tasted at lot bitterer this time as his vodka-bathed brain tried to fight back hurtful memories. John glanced at him again, though Sherlock wasn’t sure if out of curiosity or because he sensed his discomfort.
“What do you mean?” This sudden change of demeanour alarmed John more than the accusations. What did he miss here?
Something seems to click into place in Sherlock’s head. His whole body deflates, air leaving his lungs in a painfully understanding “Oh.”
It seemed ages ago that he had truly believed in this mindset.
Mary comes out of the bathroom, putting on her earrings and giving him a pointed look at his naked feet. “Still not dressed, are you? You better hurry then.”
“Sherlock, what are you doing here?” Molly asked, eyes clouded with sleep. Her mussed hair lay on her shoulder in a loose braid and her arms tightly wrapped a dressing gown around her figure, the thin fabric with little ladybirds on it a futile barrier against the freezing cold leaking in.
Their eyes, still locked on each other, widened in synchronized overwhelming sensation. Inch after inch John let himself sink into Sherlock, the tightness absolutely world-shattering. Sherlock’s hot skin beneath his fingers seemed to vibrate with the effort to stay relaxed, to take John in, all of him. An anxious hand felt for John’s and held on to it in an almost painful grasp.
Sherlock’s eyes darken. “Is it—that bad?”
“It sure does. And what details suggest that he wasn’t alone when he died?”
“It’s vodka with a bit of lemon juice and raspberry lemonade,” John replied with a hint of insecurity but Sherlock smiled shyly.
Greg washes down the chuckle quivering on his tongue with the rest of his second pint. His fingers trace the curve of the empty glass. As Sherlock’s hand flies over the paper, he feels warmth bloom on his insides the alcohol can hardly account for.
“I spent half of last night spilling my guts to Molly and Greg,” Sherlock explained with an embarrassed grin.
“There is a good chance my mental capacities are hereditary. Look at Mycroft and Eurus. What if a child I father would be… just like me?”
“Once. When I did my master’s. I ran into him on campus. He didn’t even recognize me. I had been clean for three years but that day…” Sherlock lowered his head again, his stumbling breaths ghosting over John’s neck.
“I’ll go get it,” Sherlock said before John could ask. He weaved past the other people in the queue behind them. “I’ll be fast.”
There it is.
A case maybe? An accidentally uncovered mystery?
Sherlock already had a response prickling on his tongue when John stepped between them: “Now, boys, maybe you could both calm down or—”
John gave Sherlock a stern look before soothing Mrs. Hudson. “It only grazed me. I’m fine.”
“Of course, I do,” Sherlock sniveled through a bright smile, unable to hold back the tears any longer. “I love you so much.”
“John,” he says, pleased to find that his voice is completely neutral.
Sherlock’s eyes fell shut as he met John in a tender kiss. It was barely more than a brush, just as soft as the landing snowflakes on his shoulders. Yet, the contact sent a tidal wave of pure, unadulterated bliss through his buzzing mind, washing away every single rational thought until just one word remained, one glorious syllable, chanted by every cell to the rhythm of his heartbeat.
“I’m not leaving,” he said, unwaveringly.
Sherlock’s face settles into a sobered expression, sadness occasionally wafting over his features like November fog. “I know.”
“Still, the next couple of hours won’t be fun,” John replied with a weary smile. “You don’t need to see that or lose sleep over me.”
The anger bleeds from Sherlock as fast as it came.
What's left to say? Smut ahead! :)
The tea had apparently rehydrated him enough to allow his body to spare some fluids for tears again. With quiet steadiness, they dropped from his chin. Molly and Greg both remained perfectly silent while Sherlock cried, freely and unashamedly, but the looks they shared whispered of compassion and… understanding. They both had lived through their share of unrequited love, too, Sherlock realized. At least this once, his inner workings didn’t estrange him from the rest of the world but made him belong. He was able to love—even if no one would ever love him back. What kind of monstrosity could he possibly be if he was capable of such sentiment?
For a second, he knows his thoughts are written all over his face, all his doubts and fears, every unpleasant, unacceptable truth.
He has endured hardships straight out of other people’s nightmares, has a body full of scars to show for it. And yet, this is worse.
When he has put the kettle on and returns to the sitting room, John is still standing near the door. His shoulders have slumped. “I just thought you would call if anything interesting came up,” he says and the disappointment in his voice crushes Sherlock.
Then a thought hits the back of John’s head and his jaw drops in anxious anticipation.
Most of his considerable mental energy he invests in examining their conversation that day.
So, please don't hate me for making my two favourite idiots fight :D The reconciliation will be worth all the angst and hurt, I promise!
“I’ll never get that picture out of my head again!” Sherlock roared with laughter, only spurred on by John’s embarrassment. His amusement, however, didn’t deter him from memorizing every single detail about the body on the screen, wondering if John looked anything like him. From that moment on, he followed the film with much more enthusiasm.
“By the way, I’m still not gay, Mrs. Hudson. I’m bisexual,” John objected. Technically, he had never lied to anyone.
If he’s honest, he is now more scared than ever. He doesn’t want things to change.
"Alright, I'll blow out the candles as long as you don't sing that horrible birthday song," he said and John nodded with a defeated chuckle.
John and Sherlock are out on their first case as a couple.
“We should take shelter somewhere,” was the only thing that came out.
“I just asked you to marry me. Of course, I want to tell people,” he said softly and the weight dampening Sherlock’s enthusiasm lightened a little. “Besides, I bet they have some kind of wager going on at the Yard and if we march in there, holding hands, kissing... Doesn’t exactly take much to figure it out, even if it weren’t a room full of detectives.”
Maybe this time he just won’t quit.
Sherlock took another deep breath, drawing in the smell of John. His chest ached in unfulfilled desire as he made them dance, again and again, unable to disengage from the agonizingly beautiful picture of John’s face shining down on him. His mind gradually overwrote parts of the memory with images and sensations from New Year’s Eve—the way John had looked at him on the dancefloor, eyes filled with fiery determination, his body pressed against Sherlock’s—until the illusion was so perfect Sherlock could almost taste it on his tongue. He had quite a bit of experience in this area, by now: distorting his own memories into daydreams, molding them into something sweeter.
“Then let me add the obvious pro that you would indeed have more time for snogging me.”
“I’m alive and well, as you can see. That’s what you wanted to check, isn't it?” Sherlock said, baring his teeth in what anyone else could have mistaken for a smile.
Light lashes fluttered and a pair of tired blue eyes appeared. With a startle, the girl sat up and eyed them suspiciously.
“Or,” Greg interrupts him, elongating the syllable with a suggestive nod, “choose something to show how helpful John always is. This is about him, after all.”
Still trembling, he keeps reading:
“Of course, brother dear. You know how I worry about you,” Mycroft replied, absorbing Sherlock’s grin with his exaggeratedly benevolent expression.
There it is again.
“John, please,” Sherlock’s voice came hoarse and pleading.
John moved closer, this unidentifiable thing floating in his eyes again, right beneath the surface. “So, you meant it?”
A bright grin splits John’s face before he even opens his eyes. Stretching and yawning, his hands brush over the sheets. The thought that he might never have to spend another night in this bed makes something bright and bubbly tickle in his belly, not unlike the surge of excitement at the first drop on a rollercoaster.
“Don’t act so shocked,” Sherlock said in a slightly huffy tone. His eyes glistened in the dark and, for a few seconds, he remained silent. John was just about to wish him a good night, when Sherlock’s voice, now earnest and small, floated up to him again: “He was right when he yelled at me. What I did was reckless and disrespectful and unnecessarily dangerous. It’s just… I’ve always handled the work like this because the officials I worked with were mostly idiots who didn’t trust my methods. It was more efficiently to do as much of their work as possible, unhindered by their bureaucracy and whatnot. And it was more fun this way, I admit. Running after criminals, putting myself in the line of fire. There was nothing at risk but my own safety. But now… Greg was absolutely right. I thought I was guided by my worry about Rosie, about you. But if I had been I had tried to stay out of harm’s way, for your sake. I’m in this unfamiliar position now of having people in my life who’d be actually affected if I got hurt.”
“Choice, yeah.” John’s attention drifts off again.
“Worked out perfectly,” Greg snorts and takes another sip of his pint.
“What did you talk about with Greg by the way?” he asked, stifling a yawn. “If you don’t mind me asking. You’re still entitled to private conversation, you know.” He grinned into Sherlock’s hair, followed by a kiss. Sherlock snuggled closer.
It’s a few fun hours of dancing with Mrs Hudson, Molly, and Eileen, one of Mary’s nurse friends, before Greg questions his judgement again.
Now that his head has calmed down enough to allow coherent thoughts, the aftershock of last night’s news shakes the very foundation of his identity again.
“Love.”
“You—you watched it?” Sherlock asks again, the rattling and screeching in his thought factory growing louder by the second. He can’t think with all this noise.
An amazed smile broke John’s lips before his tongue slipped out to wet them. “Very good. Very, very good, Sherlock. I told you: You are a natural.”
“It’s a nice diversion from the usual ‘git’, ‘twat’ or ‘cock’,” Sherlock said, bathing in the radiance of John’s laughter his words evoked. This sound, this gorgeous sound—he would never tire of hearing it.
He’ll get over it eventually, Greg tells himself as he heads to the dancefloor. Heartaches can’t last forever, as much as you always believe they will.
Chances are Sherlock will play a song, for him.
Sherlock has always had a sweet tooth, resorting preferably to sugary treats whenever he is absolutely forced to eat. If it were socially acceptable he’d have his coffee with five or six sugar lumps but he’s learned quite early that two is the maximum people won’t frown at. Being frowned at is not something Sherlock usually concerns himself with but on some occasions it’s better to keep up the appearance of a proper English gentleman instead of looking like a child set loose in a sweet shop.
“She was so upset and so tired. I told her she could sleep on the sofa in the break room,” Rutherford admitted sheepishly. “She’s only a child. And I didn’t want her to stay in children’s services’ custody all by herself.”
As they get closer to 221B, Sherlock’s feet seem to grow heavier with each step. He stumbles more than once, his long limbs too much to coordinate in his drunken state. Finally, he gives in and leans on Greg’s shoulder who wraps an arm around his waist in the least intrusive way he can think of. He doesn’t want to start another lecture on manhandling.
He’s almost tempted to call Mycroft for a round of Operation.
This time, Sherlock halted their motion. He raised John’s arms to rest around his neck and nudged his nose in an affectionate gesture that made John’s chest clench with an almost painful surge of adoration. “John, you were spectacular. I’ve had an honestly mind-shattering orgasm and I haven’t slept this well since I can’t remember when. Not a single nightmare.”
Greg gives him a pitying smile. “I’m afraid you have to. But, still… If you don’t usually say that kind of stuff to each other, it’s a little weird—”
Normal human coping mechanisms usually amuse him (
They strolled on, only the random syllables Rosie strung together filling the air.
“What did you say, then?”
He gives Mary one last pat before he gets up and snatches one of the fluffy bathrobes from its hook.
Sherlock straightens his shoulders.
He clears his throat. “It’s from Sherlock?”
The fervency he lays into the lyrics makes John’s insides tingle. He has heard Sherlock sing to Rosie before but nothing has come close to this level of… honesty? The words drip from his tongue as fresh and true as spring water and make John hold his breath almost devoutly, a clandestine listener to a secret symphony.
They made their way to the mortuary where Ethan Nichols was laid out. John clenched his brows and fists sombrely at the sight of the lifeless body in front of him. He was only a kid, a boy that would never become a man. His face framed by ash blond hair would forever be stuck between the soft features of a child and the emerging markers of adulthood. Smooth white skin stretched tightly over lean muscles that clearly indicated a lot of physical activity. After all, John thought, he had gone out for a swim every day in the break of dawn. Now, the pale flesh was blemished by angry red lines drawn all over the torso up to his throat in a mazy pattern that resembled lightning.
“Excuse me?” the cashier asked, her disapproval still written all over her face.
Great.
Sherlock diligently studies the chips before picking one up. “I’d rather not,” he says and begins to munch on the fried food.
“Yeah. Fine. I’m fine,” Sherlock managed to reply.
. Of all the things that had happened between them, this one came back to haunt him now. Of all the things he had done to him… He could have lost him last night. For real and forever. The sharp pain of that thought constricted his lungs. It would’ve been his fault. He had driven him to this.
John can’t help himself and scans through the words again, not quite believing he’s not still dreaming. He pinches himself, just to be sure.
“Understood,” John and Sherlock growled in unison.
But then the treacherous thing had remained—agonisingly/amicably—silent for days and days until the carefully construed alarm system seemed rather silly.
A quiet smile flickered over John’s lips, making Sherlock question the rationality of his thought process since John obviously found it amusing. Was there anything funny about him trying to not tank Greg’s career?
Unfortunately, the admittedly huge box empties faster than anticipated. After another hour of mindless telly, the chocolate is gone and its soothing effect vanishes shortly after. Sherlock tries to hold on to the sugar high but, by now, he can pinpoint every nerve ending on his left forearm where his right hand has worried the skin in a nervous attempt to distract his brain from its own stupidity.
He knows Mrs Hudson wouldn’t approve but the alternative sees her finding the flat burned to ruins upon her return. Even without a gun in the house to shoot the wall, Sherlock will surely find other destructive habits that could do similar damage.
But it’s the same way you’d deal with a glitching computer, any defective device really: set it back to the last software version it still functioned on. This is just returning to a working system, fixing the bug, eliminating the problem at its root.
The pain, carefully kept at bay, hits him with full force. Sherlock’s stomach turns and he desperately wishes he hadn’t indulged on Mrs Hudson’s lasagne.
“Cab’s here,” Mary shouts from downstairs and John closes the drawer resolutely.
The thought adds a dash of sadness to the concoction in John’s stomach.
, John,” he bellowed, his frustration and desperation finally breaking through the surface. “I’ve dismantled an internationally operating criminal network for you. Two years of my life I spent away from home, always on the run, never resting, never catching my breath. You might be a soldier but not even you can imagine the horrors I put myself through—
“Yes. Piano, guitar, violin, cello, clarinet. I even had a drum set as a kid—although that was mostly to annoy Mycroft and my parents.” Sherlock grins stupidly while his younger self on the screen plays a few shy cords.
And now Mary is pregnant. The decision has been made for him.
“How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” Sherlock said and showed him the book’s cover. Upon John’s questioning glance, he added: “We went out and bought it when you were at work.”
“About what?”
John is drowning, drowning in Sherlock’s voice, in his words, in every passionate chord he plays.
He propped himself back up on one arm to lock his lips on Sherlock’s again. John needed to shut him up before these obscene and oh so ambrosial moans made him lose every last bit of authority over his limbs. Between kisses, Sherlock’s movements accelerated further, his body shaking in untameable jerks, until he finally flung his eyes open, grasped John’s shoulder with one hand and forced out fragments, gasping for air: “John, I— I need— I want—”
“About you?” Sherlock knitted his brows. How he hated stating the obvious. “Because it’s true. You are the best person I know, by far.”
John tried to uphold the connection.
of the Advent Calendar Challenge.
“I caused him so much pain, Harry,” John said, unable to stop his voice from trembling, “not only emotionally.” He lay down the events that had led to what John could only regard his darkest moment. “I punched him, really punched him. Kicked him, too. Hard. I really meant it, I wanted him to suffer. And it wasn’t even the first time. When he came back from the dead I gave him a bloody nose because… I was just so angry.”
This was not okay. Had he learned nothing over the years? Hadn’t he caused enough pain already? If there was even the slightest chance that someone he cared for would have to suffer because of his weakness, then Sherlock had to stay strong. Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, Molly, his parents, even Mycroft—
Sherlock bashfully wiped his face and shot John a glance who confidently said: “I just asked Sherlock to marry me.” Mrs. Hudson almost dropped the cake.
Being with Sherlock is like roaming the streets of London with storm incarnate; he’s roaring thunder and driving rain. You have to learn when to confront, when to seek shelter, when to bend as not to break. But when you know your way, he’ll pull you along in an unprecedented rush, carry you to unimaginable heights, make you feel as if you can fly.
He hasn’t heard this sound for almost three weeks, not since the very night he’s installed this special notification.
“And then?”
“Of course, dear,” she said at once, taking the toddler in her arms. “I can keep her at my flat for the night so you boys can talk.”
But, no, they didn’t plan for this.
John’s lips hurt a little as he smiles melancholically. Yes, they have had five good years. But even good things have to end sooner or later. Probably, Sherlock will even be glad to finally have his flat back, to experiment in the kitchen again and play the violin at all times of the night.
This chapter was inspired by:
This time Sherlock didn’t flinch although John nearly shouted now.
Instead, Sherlock draws in a deep breath. “I want to show you something,” he mumbles and loosens the grip on Greg’s jacket. He rises clumsily and dives into the mess of unsorted correspondence and leftover seating charts on his desk. Greg watches with brows arched while Sherlock is frantically rummaging through the papers until he finds what he’s looking for.
Sherlock doesn’t know how long they stand there, clasping each other like holding on is the only thing keeping them alive. The summer night outside drifts by and still John is crying, a thunderstorm washing the past years’ dust and dirt away.
“Nothing at all. I just would’ve liked to treat you to it.”
“You need data?”
“Well, yes… I mean, we were just about to go to bed when John received a text from that woman and tried to shrug it off. And when I told him what an awful person she obviously was and that texting her was a mistake and that he was hurting me he just ran the whole
John hugged her tightly to his chest and sat down in the armchair in the corner, murmuring the same phrases over and over again like an incantation. He had to believe them, hold onto them with all his power. Sherlock would come back and then John would fix things between them. Rosie’s tired eyes fell closed and she nestled her head in the crook of John’s arm.
“You’re a genius with extensive knowledge of the human body. I’m sure you can manage.”
“Of course, dear,” she replies unsurely. “What’s this about then?”
. For a few painful heartbeats, he craned his neck, trying to spot a black hoody in the masses. John bumped into him as he caught up and surveyed the situation.
Against his will, his thoughts immediately hurry to the one person he knows to show up at his doorstep at the most unexpected times.
“I was worried about you, brother mine. One of my employees—”
Mary doesn’t openly oppose John’s new busy schedule, just gives him pointed looks and caustic comments. John isn’t sure if she’d be this quiet if he had announced to go working cases with Sherlock.
“There wasn’t any time but he knows that she’s safe. Cal confirmed that they were supposed to meet. He told her to pack some clothes and wait for him in the hide-out after school.”
“Remind me once again why I have to go to this party,” Sherlock said as he emerged from the bedroom and buttoned up his aubergine shirt. “We’ve already spent Christmas with those people.”
Had someone just said his name? Sherlock emerged from the depths of his insecurities and concentrated on his surroundings again. Bemusedly, he noticed that both Angelo and John had turned to him. Apparently, they expected him to comment on something he hadn’t paid attention to. “Hm?”
“God, John,” Sherlock’s pained voice cut through the haze of savage lust and made John release his flesh in sudden clarity. Shocked by his own loss of control, he stared at Sherlock’s neck. A bright purple bruise emblazoned the snowy skin, framed by the imprints of his teeth. What kind of randy teenage-nonsense was he doing here? He was usually a very considerate lover; enjoying himself but in a disciplined, measured way, more intent on pleasing his lovers than himself. These carnal instincts had been a part of him, well-guarded and never fully explored, but nothing had ever kicked them into such a high gear as the detective trembling under his touch. How could he let them take over like this, especially with a partner as inexperienced and vulnerable as Sherlock? Why did he always have to hurt him? Shame prickled in John’s veins as he watched Sherlock bring up one hand to his neck, brushing over the sore spot with an incredulous look.
“What’s on there?”
Sherlock raised his gaze and gestured at John to be extra quiet before he followed him out of the room again. “She was pretty fussy all evening. Took me ages to make her fall asleep,” he whispered after carefully closing the bedroom door behind him. John smiled at him apologetically and descended back into the sitting room. He could feel Sherlock’s deducing stare on his wet hair and rain-drenched clothes as he entered the kitchen to turn on the kettle.
___________________________________
“Fuck.”
“No.” John quickly perked up the corner of his mouth as the worried expression in his sister’s eyes deepened; only to be replaced by the light of an epiphany the next second.
Greg quirks his brows. “Why not? Too embarrassed by how plastered you both were? The great Sherlock Holmes, unable to hold his drink?” He grins.
But then again, lasagne does sound great.
Sherlock listened to the song three more times, still not quite sure if he was to believe his ears. When the cabbie finally pulled up in front of 221B with an indignant comment about music, Sherlock handed him a few pound notes, apparently giving a more than generous tip going by the sudden change in the cabbie’s demeanour. Twenty pounds or two thousand—Sherlock couldn’t care less.
Big, pearly tears disentangle themselves from John’s lashes and drop down his cheek. His voice breaks. “I just want to be with you,” he chokes out. “I just want to come home. I just want to come home. Please.”
What an unsettling thought that his body responds to something as base as food with such an intense feeling of relief.
“Greg? What are you doing here?”
How did it go?
“I don’t know,” Greg returns. The thought that Sherlock has fled the scene is mortifying him beyond reason. “Maybe he’s outside,” he tries to assure himself and John alike.
Sherlock’s phone beeped in his coat pocket and, without much thought, John reached over and got it.
They are both sitting in their chairs, a fire happily crackling beside them, filling the flat with dancing, golden light. Rosie is perched on John’s lap, her little fingers reaching for his face and teacup. John dodges them expertly and bounces the leg she’s on. At the movement, Rosie lets out a high-pitched giggle, her mouth opening in rapture and revealing soft, pink gums. John chuckles and settles his arm more firmly around her, tugging the little girl closely to his chest.
Molly, who has come by every couple of days to bring him a few severed toes or the odd spleen, hasn’t said anything about the wedding either, has she? And anyway, Sherlock ponders, hasn’t she always vehemently refused to personally abstract anything from her workplace, even if he had used the facial technique others call 'puppy eyes'?
No, nothing in his face proclaims that he is married now. Or that he is only months away from becoming a father.
What a night. What a catastrophic night. And yet, things could’ve have gone that much worse. For one, no one had died. Who would’ve thought that he’d count that as a win when they had taken the case.
“Don’t mind if I do, love,” John said without a beat and intertwined their fingers in one smooth motion. With every additional time they touched, Sherlock’s body changed its reaction. The surges of tingling electricity didn’t lose their intensity but shifted into something warm and all the more addictive. Sherlock doubted he’d ever get accustomed to this intoxicating sensation of John’s hot skin against his own. He had always been a man of many vices but none of them had ever caused such a pleasant and positively nurturing reaction as touching John Watson. And for once, he couldn’t think of anything to keep him from happily succumbing to it.
Although their existence was logically eliminated, checking for monsters under the bed and in the closet had been a crucial part of his night time routine. Mycroft had teased him about it every day as long as Sherlock could remember until he had finally stopped. But what did Mycroft know about the horrors that Sherlock’s imagination fabricated for him? It was foolish, Sherlock knew that, but he longed to get up and turn on the light just to see that nothing was lurking in the corners.
“That is a convincing point, I admit,” John grinned but the way Sherlock’s eyes twinkled with mischief and lust made it ebb away rather quickly.
As promised: Your next dosage of suffering! :)
The next morning, they woke to a pale sun stretching her fingers over the room and John almost jumped out of bed. His body had recovered and craved even the smallest amount of natural light. A grin spread across his face. Finally, they could go out, get some fresh air and rid their shoulders of the dust that had settled on them. Next to him, Sherlock watched him with half-closed eyes, a small smile caressing his lips. John would never get used to the sheer beauty of a sleepy Sherlock Holmes. He quickly diverted his gaze and escaped to the bathroom.
Giving his lungs time to recover, John shifted his focus to Sherlock’s chin and neck, trailing hot open-mouthed kisses down to his collarbone. Long, slender fingers fisted in the fabric of John’s button-down in a desperate attempt to pull him closer. Sherlock’s head fell back, exposing even more creamy white flesh for John to attend to, and small sounds escaped his chest again, somewhere between a sob, a moan, and a gasp. At the noise, John’s already rock-hard cock, pressing against Sherlock’s arse, gave an almost painful twitch, rebelling against the layers of fabric constricting it, a wild famished animal rattling at its cage. With a groan in response, John sank his teeth into Sherlock’s pale skin in ferocious urgency, too lightly to draw blood but certainly with enough force to leave a mark. Indulging in the taste and the string of whimpers that vibrated in the throat right beneath his mouth, John replaced his bite with hungry suction as if he could transfuse a fraction of Sherlock’s being into his own.
“I’ve died for
“You mentioned it, back when we were planning…” John’s voice peters out.
He turns back to John, his mouth slightly agape. In his head, a thought manifests, too hopeful and too ridiculous to exist.
“I know, killing a kid just like—,” John began but Sherlock interrupted him.
John finally returns to Baker Street to reconcile with Sherlock.
