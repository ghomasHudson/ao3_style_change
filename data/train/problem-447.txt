That’s what girlfriends were, they came and replaced your friends no matter how close you were before-hand to either party, because romantic relationships seemed to tower over platonic ones in the hierarchy of association.
For a laugh he was tempted to post it. His therapist wouldn’t be able to say anything about him not using it. If not for his abuse of the keyboard.
“Sure, if you want. And don’t try to distract me, Myc. I’m not having two conversations at once.” The Gryffindor spoke softly, squeezing Mycroft’s hand.
“If it will help reassure you that I haven’t been torn apart by a hippogriff, then sure.” He moved over slightly so there was pace on his bed, it was quite nice considering he rarely used it. “Feel free to lie down.” He added.
“Pretty good, I think my exams went well.”
Greg closed his fist around the golden ball as he met it in mid-air. The broom kept travelling though, as he lost his grip with only one hand, and fell back.
Their parents had a specific image in mind for the both of them, and neither Holmes boy wanted to adhere to it. Mycroft was so lucky he was finally moved out.
“So, both the Holmes’ have been involved in a casualty now.” Madame Promfrey spoke idly as they got Molly onto a stretcher to wheel her to the hospital wing.
“Very well then, go ahead.”
If Mycroft did this all without help, so could he.
“Too right,” Greg laughed, taking a nervous step around the greenhouse. “I think he’s made it a game never to call me by my actual name.”
“Well I for one, could call you handsome, or gorgeous if you prefer.”
“It was, Mycroft, it was
Rosie was first to reply before him. “Yep! He learned specially, isn’t it pretty?” John simply shrugged in response.
“Because I know they know Mycroft would have them in Azkaban if Sherlock so much as scratches himself unsupervised.” Greg laughed, and John managed a watery smile. “It’s alright if you want to take a break from practice.”
He could hear his heart pounding in his head and breathed out again, his excitement had been reignited.
It was a wise choice, but considerably out of his comfort zone as far as clothing went. He enjoyed the layers that masked his lanky, gaunt frame. Though he knew that age would come and stretch his fast metabolism into weight, that time had not come yet, so he needn’t worry about it.
The taller man let out a satisfied hum. "You're so easy." He murmured, feeling John pant into his neck as he used quick lateral strokes, feeling John press into his hand, desperate for more friction.
“Of course.”
Anything after that was black, and he fell against the ground with a thud.
He knew something was up, he knew there was something that Greg wasn’t telling him, and he wasn’t hurt or upset about it. Greg was allowed to have secrets, he was allowed to live his own life without sharing every little detail with him.  He wasn’t upset, he was
He wasn’t very familiar with muggle children’s tales.
Now Sherlock’s interest was grabbed, he closed the book, setting it on the table and clasping his hands. “When and where?”
“Not just her, you might not understand what I mean.”
His solution was to avoid people in general, and the interaction wouldn’t have any opportunity to take place.
“As long as you promise not to make a big deal out of it.” Mycroft rolled his eyes and nodded. “Sally Donovan. She called me the Silver Surfer, he’s a comic book character, few of the other guys laughed with her. I tried my best to act like it didn’t phase me but I dunno. Shit like that gets under your skin after a bit.”
She spluttered, unsure of what to say, mortified that she’d been caught out. It didn’t take a deduction to work that out. “Wha- I- You-“
Sherlock stood up, wiping his nose on his sleeve and Mycroft rolled his eyes at the twelve-year-old, watching him go before continuing to walk down the carriage when a knock on of the glass doors startled him, he physically recoiled in shock, before relaxing, realising what it was.
He ignored the compliment, unsure how to react, before his thoughts kicked in again. “Can I see your phone? Muggleborn aren’t you?”
“Greg.”
Not to make excuses (but to make excuses lmao) I had exams and I've been either working or sleeping all summer so yikes
“Why did you do that?” Sherlock muttered, as they walked in the direction of the Ravenclaw commons. Neither boy was in the mood nor mindset to go back to studying.
“Well my Father pays for it whilst I move up in the ministry, he wants me to be at his level before he’ll allow me to take over that responsibility.”
Almost instantly he felt ill, regretting his decision thoroughly, and threw his phone to his bed, not baring to look at it while he went to take a shower. It was around ten in the morning, Rosie wouldn’t be up for another hour. They’d had a movie night in and stayed up long past her usual bed-time, so she’d stir later than normal. He’d planned to take her to the park today, to feed the ducks.
“He’s still not good with people.” John replied, that was also fairly obvious.
He came every week, sometimes twice a week, until he could stay on the broom, and then until he could stand on the broom, until he could hang upside down and still regain his balance.
“Well yes, anyone could see that.”
He was… Scared.
Sherlock dropped his arms from around John, walking away from him like this was perfectly normal. Like they hadn’t just exchanged Christmas gifts, like he hadn’t just changed John’s life, like they hadn’t just shared their first kiss.
He’d been doing so when a muddy figure on a broom touched down to land, the snitch in hand, and he shoved it back into the box with the other balls.
“No- I’ve been at school- I-“
“What do you mean?”
John was careful in bringing Greg down do the ground, once they were safe they celebrated with the manly bro-hug that always seemed to be given in public spaces, and Greg held up the snitch in his fist for everyone to see as his teammates touched down to celebrate with them.
Sherlock had asked him to tell him a story from it. And John did.
“Right.” He rubbed his eyes, restraining a groan as he realised he couldn’t put it on one handed either. Before he could open his mouth to speak Sherlock knew what he was going to ask.
“The seeker, duh.”
Greg rolled his eyes, dropped his broom and grabbed Mycroft by the lapels, pulling him down and pressing their lips together. Mycroft had expected it, but the feeling of it was a shock enough for him to drop his umbrella. His hand found the side of Greg’s face and the other his lower back, pulling him in closer deepening the kiss and inviting more ferocity into it. Greg led, and for once Mycroft followed, allowing himself to be directed. It was warm, comforting, Mycroft's heart was racing, this time he understood it and the feeling in the pit of his stomach was enjoyable.
“Thank you Mr Holmes, Mr Watson.” She nodded at them.
It was apparent that Greg was now nervous, as he bit his lip before asking. “Uh, this might sound gay or whatever, but would you come to the match? I know you don’t like them much but I uh… It’d mean a lot to me if you did.” A soft blush came over his face as he spoke, and he turned his attention to his cards again, as if that would stop the other boy from noticing.
Greg laughed, well breathed out a giggle would be a more accurate description, it was filled with nerves. “I mean like more than a friend.”
“Unpleasant disposition allows less human interaction, you are aware of such things, clearly.”
John cringed, god he was so stupid, was it even possible to misgender yourself? Would Sherlock think he’s faking it? It’d been this way for five years he really hoped he wasn’t. “Oh, yeah, thanks- sorry I-I-“ He breathed out a sigh, clenching his fists. “Force of habit, I'm sorry.”
“It- It hurts. I-I can’t- I c-can’t think g-get John.” He choked out, refusing to look up, his arms wrapping around his legs, fingers gripping tight enough that his knuckles turned white.
notice the next day, when he came to tell Sherlock to pack, the train would be leaving in a few hours and Flitwick had instructed him to tell the younger boy,
“What?”
Could they do that? There had to be rules against it.
Sherlock hummed in amusement, before taking a breath. “About what she said, your sister, I-“
“I have time.”
“I don’t, I’m just good at persuasion. If anyone asks, you had a nightmare.” Sherlock mumbled, his voice low and hitting John in all the right places. “Yes, I am a mind reader, no I wasn’t asleep, no you didn’t wake me.”
“I'm sorry about that. Well this makes my job considerably harder.” He offered a sheepish smile, to which Mycroft replied a gentle smirk, pleased to know that they were on good terms again.
John simply allowed himself to be dragged along by the taller boy. Well, he was following him, just as Sherlock knew he would be.
He wasn’t guilty and everybody knew it.
Mycroft noticed it before he did, but he was quick on the draw and soared quickly toward the snitch, flittering near the enemy goal.
“To me, yes.”
But that wasn’t what caught his attention.
“No.” He replied, and he could practically hear John’s eyeroll from the doorway.
“Can I help you?” He asked, trying his best not to seem intimidated or rude, but he would much prefer to keep the way ink spat from his nip every time he tried to write, to himself.
Mycroft let out a breath of relief after what felt like an eternity and pushed through the crowd before they all began to leave, rushing down the stands to find the Gryffindor ones.
He didn’t sleep anymore if he could help it.
“She said it was you.” John cut him off, he looked upset, annoyed, disappointed, his tone of voice was filled with frustration. “She said you cornered her, and you cast the spell. You did say that it would have been somebody your height.”
“I know, I
get panic-attacks.” Maybe he was too insistent, he thought, as the knowing smirk crept onto Sherlock’s face.
was he acting like a foreign language Sherlock couldn’t understand?
“So, you are coming over this summer then?” Mycroft replied after a moment of thought, deciding against asking the more awkward questions that had been rattling around his skull for months at this point. Even though he’d done his best to lock them in a box and store them away in the very back crevices of his mind, they did still linger.
He suspected John had tried to find him to say goodbye once they got to Kings Cross, but once he noticed the Gryffindor looking for somebody, he melted into the crowd to avoid him.
“Nothing I can’t fix.” He replied, with a nod, even though she wasn’t looking at him.
Almost immediately he lost his balance, his grip tightened, and he was hanging upside down as it held him in the air. He couldn’t help but scowl as his grip loosened and he fell to the forest floor with a thud and a rustle.
“I don’t understand.”
John still had Rosie in his lap, hands wrapped around her, holding her close as they read from the story book, it was a Winnie The Pooh entry, that she adored. They were nearing the end of the familiar story and she was getting tired.
“John.” Sherlocks voice was calm, it wasn’t cold, it was inviting. The Gryffindor opened his eyes to see Sherlock sitting differently, the book discarded on top of his back. “Come here.”
His mother knew he was a wizard, it didn’t help that she was the only one to know now she was gone. John wasn’t entirely sure how she knew either, he supposed maybe it was from the time he’d made the kettle boil when it wasn’t turned on, or from the time he melted the slide at the park when nobody would let him play. She’d managed by negotiation to exchange some of her savings, so he’d have enough to get what he needed when the time came for him to get a proper wizarding education.
The letter was filled with some sappy poem about how green his eyes were, and he rolled his eyes, folding it up and making a note to stick it in the fireplace later. He had no use for her flattery, considering he’d shot down all her advances prior.
“Suffice it to say you did have a panic-attack, then?”
“Toilet roll with have to do for the moment. Get back into bed, I’m going to the shops.” Sherlock spoke, shedding his dressing gown as he walked out of the bathroom briskly, going for his coat.
"Shut up before I make you." Sherlock replied, turning to glance at the doctor, his eyes piercing him. He moved his hand up John's leg slightly, the doctors breath hitched. He smirked as he looked the other way. "Christ, I should have accounted for traffic." He cursed himself, feeling John staring at him.
“Shut it Adler, I need to talk to her.” Mycroft managed to reply, glaring at her with more ferocity than Anthea.
Mycroft couldn’t ask that of him, for fear of losing him altogether. So, he’d take what he could get and suffer through the nights.
Sherlock watched in confusion, as John knocked the wall twice before drawing a circle with his finger against the bricks. Nothing happened for a moment, and Sherlock was about to go back to the commons where it was warm, comfortable, and he could escape to his mind palace, then something happened.
He’s had trouble sleeping ever since the nightmare’s had gotten worse, a subconscious fear making it’s way into his conscious and preventing the very idea of sleep itself.
. She- She’s dancing, mum is. Dad’s smiling up at her and- a-and she’s pulling him up to join her.” The more he spoke the more his voice began to tremble. “They’re happy, laughing- He’s holding her and-“ He broke off his sentence, as tears began to fall, he put his head in his hand.
The castle was filled with people, obviously it was, he didn’t know why he thought it would be a better place to go than the pitch. People were staring at him as he ran through the halls in his quidditch robes with a bloody nose dripping onto the floor, a stitch was tearing into his side and a sickness was rising in his throat, threatening to spill out over the edge if he didn’t get out of there soon. He felt like he was suffocating.
John rolled his eyes, before taking off after him. He winced but pushed forward anyway. He’d had P.E as his last lesson the day before and everything ached, not to mention the constraints on his chest causing him some
Mycroft laughed abruptly, covering his mouth to silence the unexpected outburst, before clearing his throat. “You might need a moment or two to adjust, but you don’t need rehabilitation.”
“Oh, how helpful. I'm
“You know it, babe.” He smirked, almost enjoying the disgust that most certainly appeared in John’s mind, if not on his face. “Okay, down to business, tell Sherlock I want to talk to him.”
“And you don’t think that it warrants anything else?” Sherlock furrowed his own brow, he could read John like a book; why
He’d told sherlock his theory about a metamorphagus, Sherlock, despite being rather impressed with Sarah for knowing what a metamorphagus is (John hit him for that) explained that it wouldn’t hold up unless they could prove it.
Once he got to his bedroom, he did the usual pokes and prods, twists and turns and finger waggling to work out why the hell it was hurting.
“Sherlock don’t.” John held up a hand, he could do this himself, he
Though he supposed he’d inevitably get bored of it after enough matches, things like this could only be exciting for so long.
It was as if their roles were switched, now Sherlock was staring at John, studying him, more than usual, watching him in lessons, at lunch, in the hallways.
“He stupefied Hooper didn’t he?” She asked, and Mycroft rolled his eyes, sick of hearing that phrase. Sherlock did
“I-“ He choked out a breath, trying to force himself to breathe properly, to no avail, he could feel the blood trickling from his nose down his face. “I-I’m fine, Greg. I just- I need to go. I can’t be h-here.” He stammered in response, pushing his broom into Greg’s chest, for him to take it.
He knew Sarah would try and convince him that he was wrong, that Sherlock was guilty.
“Well if you were as smart as you say, you’d’ve known I’d be fine.” He laughed, but he wasn’t letting go.
Mycroft smiled at him, quite pleased. “Took me twenty-three attempts, two of them ended up tasting like vomit.” He remarked, taking a leaf for himself before grabbing Greg’s hand, pulling him toward the back.
John swallowed nervously as everyone looked at him expectantly and if it were possible he felt more out of place. Sherlocks mother was sat opposite him, Mycroft beside her. Sherlock sat beside him, and his father sat at the head of the table.
“I said what I saw.”
"You know?"
She smirked and wiped her tears away. “I have more friends than you, gay-boy, why don’t you run back to your psycho boyfriend?”
John fumbled with the buttons on Sherlock's shirt, his hands were shaking, unable to focus as Sherlock rubbed at him through his trousers. "Y-You aren't playing fair." The doctor choked out, resisting the urge to push against him, desperate for more.
It was something he hadn’t expected, and something he could have never predicted.
“Well maybe if you opened your book instead of checking if your boyband meme page had any new followers, you’d know. Surds, anyone heard of them?” The class was silent, twenty-seven pairs of eyes trained to him as he paced the classroom. The desks were organised in a U shape so he, and the board were always clear. Twenty-six, now a particularly anxious boy had decided to look down at his book.
Sherlock pushed himself off the floor, walking over to inspect the machine just as John was. He was never really one to involve himself with muggle technology. He wanted to, yes, but he was scared of it, just a little (not that he’d ever admit it). So since his father had brought it home from work and set it up, he hadn't really bothered with it. Nor did he know how it worked. “Yes, is that of significance?”
Mycroft locked the door with a silent spell, casted only with a wave of his hand, and John swallowed realising that he may actually have something to be afraid of. The library was quite big, not as big as the one in school, but from floor to ceiling the walls were bookshelves. It was quite a magnificent sight.
John took a breath. “Love you too.”
He’d woken up from yet another nightmare about his mum, this time it had been a mandrake of all things that killed her.
John had told him about a story book his mother used to read to him all the time. How it had been cremated with her. How he could still remember all the words to each one.
“Meet me at the green, I’ll try to sneak out.”
“You have a cook? Scratch that of course you do. When will I be meeting Jeeves, head of the household?” John asked, trying to distract himself from his nerves.
John caught him staring, once he’d shouldered the hockey bag he kept his broom in. “Oh, uhm, Rugby, no big shakes.”
“Why must it always be this? You and me, in a locked room, to discuss something I probably don’t want to?” John asked once the door was locked and they were trapped, a sense of de ja vu rushing through the room, as john did his best to keep his expression neutral and his body language minimal.
It ended up a routinely thing, Greg working himself up over the Gryffindor Seeker legacy to the point he would cram in all his free time with extra practice, and Mycroft coming to walk him back into the castle. His calm tone could untense a frustrated Lestrade in minutes, maybe even coax a laugh out of him with each crude deduction that fell from his lips as they walked through the halls.
Mycroft furrowed his brow, why were things now becoming difficult for him, to his knowledge he hadn't ingested any poison or drug that could slow him down, things weren’t visualising how they normally would and his heart rate had elevated considerably. He could feel the heat rising to his cheeks with no explanation. “I'm not following, you already pronounced me your best friend.”
“Obvious, yeah, everything is obvious isn’t it?” The Gryffindor shoved his hands into his pockets, he didn’t like when Sherlock said it, but he tolerated it. Somehow Mycroft saying it made his urge to punch him very real.
I kinda like this chapter, shits gonna go down soon
“Huh, indeed.” Sherlock responded. “So, no hands there, noted.”
Biting his lip to silence his protests, he took a breath in order to keep his cool. “He was with me in the library, Sarah, how could he have done it?”
Sherlock rubbed his back in gentle circles, deciding it would be best to let him get it out of his system.
Mycroft gazed at him somewhat pointedly, taking a break from reading. He couldn’t understand how Greg could be so calm, when their exams began in a couple days. Yes, they weren’t the final grades, those would come next year with buckets more stress, but these ones were still important.
"John, I'm starting to question your intellect if that's a question you have to ask." Sherlock smirked.
He didn’t really know why he’d done it, but something flared up inside his head that made the thought of speaking to John in that moment seem sickening, anxiety inducing maybe, so he’d chosen to avoid the feeling.
John pulled off his cock, licking the tip of it before changing back to using his hand. "Who's bedroom?" He asked.
“’Course I did. Where else would I get a scarf that plays Danse Macabre from the tassels? Why? Are you impressed with me, Holmes?”
“And the amortentia.” Sherlock finished, nodding to nobody but himself.
As he thought he didn’t even realised John shifting closer and before he knew it John’s hands were on his cheeks. His eyes went wide and John pressed their lips together.
“Just talk John, tell me whats happening.”
Mycroft should probably have been concerned about that, but he was usually quite lenient on rule breaking so long as nobody was harmed. Besides it wasn’t as if they could prove he knew if they ended up catching the fourth year. “I don’t know, I may be biased.”
John Watson was a terrible liar.
“Gregory, please,
wanted to?”
That was another miscalculation, so was the delay in his dodge that allowed Andersons fist to crack against his cheek, an ache spreading down into his jaw. Fortunately, he was still able to find his momentum, slamming the heel of his palm into the celiac plexus, sending the older boy staggering back.
life is a fuckin wild ride.
It was just him, and John. They were standing the same way, except for their hands. They were interlocked in the reflection, Sherlock looked down at his own hand, feeling uncomfortably empty now he’d seen it, he clenched it and looked back up.
“You’re also a pompous prick, y’know that?”
He could practically feel his nerves crawling through his blood, sickness dragged in his every thought and each was worse than the last.
Greg nodded. “Oh.”
Taking in a soft breath he knelt in front of his brother. “Sherlock, what’s the matter?” He asked, knowing fine rightly what it was but he’d rather Sherlock told him. Sherlock had been irritable from the moment he’d woken Mycroft up that morning.
“Why are you crying? Don’t you like it? I can-“
Sherlock grinned into the doctor’s skin. “Bearing in mind you saved my life today, I’ll spare yours for now.”
Mycroft knew all about mockery for features you could not control, his hair for one, his nose another, but he decided to focus on the relevant topic. “I am well aware, try being ginger.”
John took it from him, taking a sip. “How did you find me?”
“Gareth.”
“Of course.” John gave another hum, which meant that he had something to ask but didn’t know how to phrase it just yet, and Sherlock ran through the list of things he could want to ask about. “So, your tattoo is on your finger, under the ring?”
Sherlock was odd. John knew that. But he was acting a different kind of odd tonight, and John couldn't tell what the reasoning behind it was. Sherlock opened the cab door for him, and he slid over to the other side.  "Baker street, please." He told the cab driver, who nodded.
Mycroft and Greg walked into Hogwarts for their last year, both with shiny new badges pinned to their robes.
It was better than John had ever thought.
, John, you know I hate repeating myself.”
Sherlock had his gaze trained to John, who was taking his place in front of the goal hoops. Unsurprisingly, John initiated the greeting, raising a hand in a calm wave, but to Mycroft’s disbelief Sherlock nodded back at him, smiling softly.
“I like the idea of being a healer, but I don’t think I’ll ever be at the right casting level. When I was little I liked the idea of joining the army, so I might do that.”
A few days after that conversation, Greg found himself in Mycroft's apartment, it was similar in size to his but it appeared bigger due to the barren walls, and considerable lack of… Well anything homely.
“Yeah, of course it was, it was fantastic.”
The halls were filled with jump-scares and japes. The fifth-floor corridor was enchanted to look like a gaping chasm with a river below it, despite the fact that you could still walk on it perfectly fine.
“Painful to recall, I tend to shut those events out.”
“This is the worst.”
“That’s not how you hold a quill.”
“Are you asking me to have a flat-share with you?”
John could get used to this.
He was just tired and aching, and angry at the world.
The coma was a result of the head injury, well it wasn’t a coma per say. Greg had definitely clicked back into consciousness a few times over the course of the past few days. He just seemed to squint before deciding against waking up properly and going back to sleep, whether it was voluntary or not, was indecipherable.
And so, for the next six months that was how it was. They maintained a fairly regular sleep pattern, aside from late night cases and the rare unresolved arguments. When John turned his back to Sherlock, removing his hoodie, Sherlock knew that John wanted it on.
“What’s the damage?”
“I do have ears John.”
“You practically live here, Myc.” He laughed nervously. “Why would you pay for a flat you barely live in when I’d much rather have you here all the time.” Mycroft continued to stare, like he didn’t quite grasp the situation.
“Thanks. I think I woke up a couple times, even just a little bit. I was scared, ‘was still numb, but I knew you were there.” Another moment of silence game, Mycroft waited, knowing he had more to say than that. “It helped.”
That was the first time.
“The horror.” Mycroft gasped dramatically, and the Gryffindor laughed.
“Oh my god.” John shook his head, smiling in disbelief.
enjoy!
Compared to Mycroft's own Dad, Greg’s dad must have seemed like a gift.
“Jolly good, back in a jiffy.” Sherlock spoke with a grin, and John couldn’t help but smile as he watched him go.
“Yes.” He cut Greg off before he could finish, the Gryffindor paused and looked up at him, eyes widened in disbelief and apprehension.
“Yeah, of course I know.” He frowned, it wasn’t exactly a secret that Sherlock didn’t have any friends, he shrugged of or scoffed at most other people, except maybe Greg, and he hadn't been too mean to Sarah the only time he’d spoken to her, he’d even gone so far as to tell her what glasses would suit her best.
“Don’t apologise for this, John. It’s not your fault, its hers, she did this to you and nobody else. So just try to calm down, you shouldn’t be letting it get to you this much.” This wouldn’t effect him this much, Greg knew John, maybe he wasn’t a Holmes, maybe he couldn’t read minds, but he knew his friend. John was calm, he was a happy person, it took a lot to make him like this, so it couldn’t just be Sarah, if it was just Sarah he would have broke up with her and tried to get over it.
John laughed again. “Not really.”
It was gentle, and warm and nothing like he’d imagined it would happen, if ever.
“What happened to Mycroft?” John asked, and Sherlock managed to hide his gratitude, he hated having to show that he cared about his brother.
John had sat up by this point, heels of his hands pressed into his eyes, he gave Sherlock a look of gratitude when he looked up, taking the mug of tea in his hands, and pressing the hot water bottle to his stomach. Sherlock sat beside him on the edge of his bed, slightly unsure if this was alright, but John didn’t seem phased, taking two of the painkillers dry.
“Oh, was I supposed to
“Oh, thank you. Should I open it now?” His birthday had been a little while ago, but he didn’t want to give John any indication of it, most things about him, the older boy could work out if he observed, the date Sherlock was born, was a secret he’d like to keep.
He was angry, it wasn’t difficult to tell, he knew hiding it would be futile, Sherlock always knew when he was lying, knew when he was hiding, knew when everything was fake. He could lie by omission maybe (most likely not) but anything else didn’t fly.
“You made it?”
He wasn’t aware it was commonplace to be on a first-name-basis, but he didn’t question it further. “Yeah, John Watson, Rosamund’s father.”
What if Sherlock had another meltdown when they were gone. When nobody was there to help him?
Mycroft froze, he hadn't heard that nickname in a long time, not since he left for Hogwarts and everything changed. Biting his lip, he breathed out a sigh, he wasn’t about to cry as well, he had to be the strong older brother. He ran a gentle hand through Sherlock’s hair, pushing his fringe from his eyes, and seafoam green met ice blue. Sherlock gripped his hand as it made contact with his face, locking their fingers like he used to, smearing dark black over the elders fingers. “Please.” His voice was barely a whisper now.
this is kinda shitty, im just stressed and dysphoric, writing is hard, but I get off school for two weeks on Friday, so I hope to get at least one chapter written during that time.
The head boy and girl held up the cup, and a roar went up from the table of blue, alongside him, and to his surprise, John Watson. It was unexpected given the Gryffindor’s quidditch born sense of house loyalty. Maybe he wasn’t as much of an idiot as Mycroft had thought.
Is that why it was hitting so hard?
“What?”
Greg’s shoulders slumped and confusion wrote itself onto his face. “You lost me.”
Sherlock didn’t speak a word, his expression was left unchanging as he walked down off the steps, taking a seat at the Ravenclaw table.
"For what? Having doubt? Stop it." Sherlock ran his slender fingers down John's back, tracing gentle patterns against his skin, feeling the doctors breath slow down as he began to lose consciousness. "John?"
“You.” The Slytherin deadpanned. Mycroft didn’t know anybody else with grey hair at their age, but that’s what made it so captivating. He couldn’t really understand why anybody would patronise him for it.
“I don’t doubt it. I just want to be able to help people.” John replied, shrugging, it was nice to have a civil conversation with someone, he hadn't had anyone to talk to other than Harry when she came round.
“Get your stethoscope.” Sherlock ordered, he knew John usually carried it with him, just because, before getting up and running out of the library, turning the corner of which the scream had sounded, before stopping in his tracks.
“Unless you’d like Mrs Hudson to.”
“Not what you’ve done, but what you need to do. Sherlock is having a meltdown, overloaded I think, he requested you.” Overload, John had read about that, he paused for a minute to think about what the best for it would be. “Hurry up!” Mycroft barked, and John glared at him before his expression softened and he worked out what he needed to do.
Mycroft sighed and walked to his own room on the other side of the house, Greg was laid on his bed, reading. The sight of Greg in his glasses made him smile and he flopped himself on the bed next to the other, pressing a kiss to the hair returned to grey.
maybe not Hufflepuff.” He added a little laugh, but it was clear compulsion forced him to speak in such detail rather than his own conscious, because his face glowed redder, if that was possible.
Strangely, John didn’t look offended, instead he looked curious, leaning forward but not in a threatening manor like others had done. “How did you know all that then?”
“Indeed.” As he looked back, he could feel John standing somewhat awkwardly, staring at him, unsure of what type of affection would be acceptable, but desperate to show it. “John if you want to hug me I wouldn’t be opposed.”
“I presume you’ll join us at dessert?” Sherlock’s father asked. “Do play him something nice, despite your constant effort to show off, I'm not sure he’d enjoy Paganini Caprice number one.”
“You’re my soulmate.” He breathed, eyes flickering from his hand to John’s shoulder, to his chest as the tattoo seemed to spread out over it. The doctor’s eyes were still shut tight, but he wasn’t grimacing anymore. “John?”
Mycroft ran a hand over his eyes, like he was talking to the biggest dunce on the planet. “I don’t mean physically, you idiot. You know you didn’t say goodbye to him before we departed for summer?”
came off his tongue like it tasted bad. “Really John you can’t expect to have entertained me for much longer, give yourself
Greg shook his head. “Sherlock found it weird.”
ughghgh I'm so tired, somebody help me
“You are not up righting a stupefied body to prove a point.” John’s tone was filled with warning, and Sherlock rolled his eyes at him. “Also, don’t say
“I’ve seen you cry, and you’ve seen me, embarrassment is a construct and by now should be long gone.”
“Well believe me, I’m less entertaining.”
Sherlock looked at him, his features were soft, but his eyes were cold, and John knew he was upset about it, yet he felt better now he’d said it aloud. “Fantastic, I hate her even more now. How do you even stand to be in the same building as her? If I were you and I knew she was walking around the same halls as me I wouldn’t be able to handle it.”
“Your breathing.”
Greg laughed and Mycroft scowled at the floor, the Gryffindor squeezed the other boy’s hand a little, the warmth of his calloused hand, stark against Mycroft's cold fingertips. “You’re practically in the foetal position, I know when things are wrong.”
“Deal.”
“Thank you.” He muttered softly after a few moments of silence.
This time he hugged Greg before the Gryffindor had to meet his dad outside the station for the drive to their Croydon flat.
“Whats going on?” Greg raised an eyebrow; this wasn’t really like Mycroft.
His focused returned to John, who was now tapping his hands against the sides of his legs, his shoulders had tensed and his smiles weren't real anymore. He was uncomfortable, normally Sherlock would enjoy watching the shorter man squirm and stammer, eventually giving up and huffing out an exasperated breath. But he didn't like this, probably because it was other people doing it to his doctor. So swiftly, Sherlock picked up two champagne flutes from a passing member of staff. He handed one to John as he approached, the doctor took it with a soft smile.
Greg scowled at him, if he was paying more attention he would have noticed that the annoyance was legitimate. “You were flirting.” He replied.
John Watson? That was his name wasn’t it?
“So?” Greg asked, blocking the sun from his eyes, he looked up at Mycroft concerned.
“Yes- of course- more than okay.” John replied, unsure of what answer would be the best to give, instead choosing to give them all. “More than okay.” He settled for, and Sherlock smirked at the habit.
“I know it was stupid, but because you’re
“He’s not my boyfriend Harry.” John grumbled, turning to the door. “I’ll see you later, yeah?” He replied, smiling softly at his sister.
totally didn't let that effect this writing whattt nooooooooo
“John, are you not gonna call your parents?” The elder Gryffindor asked, looking back to the window, as the train began to move. Mycroft had since put his head in his hands, resting his elbows on his knees.
“Unicorns are generally more predisposed to liking women.”
Greg’s face reddened considerably as he replied, and John couldn’t help but smile. “I said
be legal.”
“I do. However, you are the boyfriend of said pompous prick. What does that make you?”
The doctor walked toward him, his stomach twisting delightfully as Sherlock's hands found his shoulders, and he licked his lips. "Can I kiss you?"
“Because he didn’t show any signs of shock or attraction toward me when I told him my name.”
Sherlock’s hand found Johns arm, as the doctor cupped his face, fingers just weaving their way into his curls.
Did he just not care anymore?
wouldn’t trust the judgement of a man who can’t brew a Polyjuice potion on his own. There are first years who can do that.” Sherlock replied, changing his tone entirely, each word filled him with regret but he shoved it back into the box it belonged it and focused at the task at hand.
“I'm sorry for kissing you.”
“I wouldn’t, I’ve been told he doesn’t appreciate it.” He replied, the expression fading from his face into neutral, with hints of amusement.
“No, you berk, I love it.” He sniffed, still smiling as he put it round his neck, staring into his lap as he fidgeted with the bell. “It’s just, I dunno, my mum.”
“That just shows how little you understand the educational system, Phillip. They would never allow a psychopath to teach, a high functioning sociopath, however? Well, here I am.”
After about four weeks of tutoring, and Sherlock moving seats to sit beside him in potions, John figured it safe to say that they were friends. Well, Sherlock was John’s friend, he wasn’t sure if it was the same the other way around, but he didn’t really care either.
The beep of a car cut john from his thoughts and he looked up to see his sister in her battered old Mini, he smiled at her, despite the tears in his eyes from the ache of his arm, it was genuine. He dropped his trunk and his backpack at his feet, and turned to face her. She was staring at him with a frown on her face.
you, so you thought your only option was to make me?”
. And you know what? If they don’t like me back then I wont drug them and take a year of their
“Off we go.”
He swore he could’ve felt it.
“Thanks Myc.”
“Mhm.”
“Afghanistan- Sorry, how do you know I was in Afghanistan?” John replied, his hands closing around the hot mug of tea, grounding him.
After an almost gross amount of kissing that Sherlock tried his best to ignore, John parted with Sarah and stole him from the festivities, the dirty looks he’d been getting and the looks of remorse and guilt from Molly, to the clearing in the forest, for one last flying lesson before the summer had commenced.
She wasn’t… No- She couldn’t- He was being ridiculous. She was only fourth year, she didn’t have the resources.
bedroom.
He was left with a white fabric in his hands, unfolding it, his breath hitched. “You
John was frowning as he read over it again to make sure he understood it correctly through the haze of exhaustion. “They… They want to keep him in isolation, because he’s not guilty but they don’t have another explanation. I can be his only classmate if I want, but that means that all my classes are gonna be with him and only him.”
It was a new look for him, and Greg wasn’t so certain he liked it.
“He’s a psycho John. You saw what he did to Molly Hooper.” He found that statement ridiculous, she didn’t care a bit about Molly Hooper, so the fact that she was pretending to be emotional about it (Sherlock had told him the differences a while ago) didn’t really help her cause of persuading him. Neither did her calling Sherlock a psychopath.
“It’s called sensory overload, if I’m diagnosing you right. I got it once over the summer.” John replied gently. “I have something that might help if you can sit on your own.” Reluctantly, John removed his arms from around the taller boy, who retracted himself as well, opening his eyes and blinking rapidly before squeezing them tight again with a soft groan.
“Maybe.”
opposed?”
Mycroft lifted his hands, pressing his fingertips together in a particularly evil look fashion, and John struggled to contain a smile or laugh. He looked like a Bond villain. “Yes. He’s struggling, much to his chagrin, unfortunately he’d rather throw himself to the depths of the forbidden forest than have to be moved down. I hate to ask on his behalf but he’s stubborn, would you help him?”
angry, his entire essence was anger, no other thoughts. It was a good trait and a bad one. Sherlock hated himself for taking advantage of it. Which was a knew feeling. “
Oh god he didn’t like it. John had screwed up, practically starved himself, and sherlock didn’t even like the bloody present.
“It’s Mycroft isn’t it?”
Had he just hit it off with Rosie’s teacher?
“Do you want to go back to the hall?”
It wasn’t until his two knights and his queen had their weapons raised at his king did he admit defeat, he couldn’t help but mimic the gleeful grin on John’s face.
"You-"
“Okay, go for it.”
“It goes underground for a bit, then comes up in a clearing in the forest.”
“That easy?”
Though somehow it felt to him that those boundaries had changed, and he simply hadn’t realised until now.
But he was awake properly now, thumb tracing over the back of Mycroft’s hand in gentle circles.
So, if the younger were to ask for much at all, he was usually shooed or shouted at.
There was no escape.
, it was unbelievable.
“I don’t know, maybe because she’s nice, and she clearly likes you.” Lip-lick, page turn, glance up. Sherlock didn’t even have to look to know.
“Oh, bollocks it’s a muggle thing then. I didn’t even think, sorry Myc!” Greg laughed. “It’s this thing muggles use to change their hair colour. You mix these chemicals and like it absorbs into your hair and dyes it.”
John shook his head, indignant. “No, I’m fine Greg, I'm alright, really.”
It was awkward, most definitely, but eventually they got it, and with some fiddling and a swear or two, the binder lay limp in Sherlock’s hand, John’s torso now bare as he slipped his bad arm into his hoodie, before pulling it over his shoulders. Sherlock set the binder on John’s dresser.
He gave up after that, letting out a pained sigh, sinking down against the door.
Sherlock had been kind enough to invite him to sit, so he could avoid the Gryffindor table as long as possible. “She will most likely try to find you, once she realises what you’ve done.”
Mycroft never went to the quidditch matches, he liked the quiet he could get in the commons when everyone was gone. So he generally heard the outcome from whispers around the school or from Gregory himself.
If I get shit wrong, please be nice.
“I mean yeah, but it’s justified, right?” John replied, running his hands through his hair.
The corners of Mycroft's mouth quirked up into a smile. “Snape would be the last person who would, Dumbledore would be far less discreet.”
That was when John snapped back into himself, and straightaway scrambled to help, taking Sherlocks hands from his hair and holding them. “Whoah, take a deep breath, darling.” John spoke calmly. “What’s going on, what happened?”
“I am unaware of any fondness he might have for me, though I doubt it will help in the matter, besides I think he marks Slytherin’s more harshly.”
“What’s got you so riled up then? You haven’t moaned to me about this in a while.”
“Oh right. Christ Greg I'm so sorry.”
John laughed, shaking his head. “You talk a load of bollocks, Holmes.”
Irene raised an eyebrow at her. “Boss hm? You could’ve told me that’s what you liked, Annie.” Anthea glared at her for the nickname and for the comment.
“John.” He spoke, shaking the shorter man from his sleep.
“Fine. Thank you by the way…” He looked at her, gesturing for her to finish.
He set down the plastic bag on the floor, rushing to the side of John’s bed, and placing a gentle hand on John’s shoulder. The soldier didn’t open his eyes but made a grunt of acknowledgement to let Sherlock know he wasn’t dying.
Despite the oddities he seemed to possess, the muttering to himself as he monitored the tarmac, or the weird gestures he did with his hands when he stood, John wanted to go up and thank him. Rosie had never been more excited to go to school than when she was in his class.
“Not disgust, merely surprise.” He muttered to Greg, noticing him tense up, his grip on the prefect’s hand tightening. “She looked slightly pleased.” He added, with an air of confusion in his tone, the deduction was sure, but he couldn’t for the life of him work out why McGonagall of all people would be pleased by him and Greg holding hands.
"Fine."
He breathed out, loosened his grip, and focused.
Right now, he didn’t want to think about that. He didn’t want to think about Jim Moriarty. He didn’t want to think about anything.
“Of course.”
Sherlock didn’t look up, knowing who it was. “What if I'm not a Slytherin?” He asked, his voice muffled from his robes.
He found it unfair that Mycroft was offered a rat or a toad and didn’t take it, but when he wanted something as simple as an owl he wasn’t allowed.
John’s shoulders dropped, how had he forgotten something so simple. People made apologies all the time but he doubted that anybody had ever properly apologised to Sherlock. “That’s a really good idea. Thank you so much.”
Yet again he’d underestimated just how much these things could hurt.
“Right, sorry.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, placing his own hand on John’s shoulder. “It is. Put your hand on my back, just below my shoulder. Now we’re gonna do a box so back, left, forward, right.” He wasn’t ordering, put instructing as they went, and a soft smile of triumph came onto John’s face as they completed the step. “Now repeat, and make it fluid, there you go.” Sherlock laughed, smiling proud as they kept going to the rhythm, a waltz step probably wasn’t the best for the music, but it was the easiest.
“How so?”
“You were with Sarah weren’t you?”
“Okay, whats going on? Is she breaking up with me?” He asked, trying to keep the relief out of his tone, but the girl just rolled her eyes and shrugged.
This was different. So much different.
“Greg told me yesterday about your quidditch heroics.” Sherlock’s father, Conrad as he’d been instructed to call him, said, as they ate.
They sat like that for a while. John giggling into his paper as Sherlock argued with the telly. Mrs Hudson popped up to say hello and take her paper back. John found a hand in a zip-lock bag on the top shelf of the fridge.
The words echoed in John’s head before he could truly register what exactly they meant. “How? I haven’t laid a hand on him I swear, I would never. He fell off my broom once but there wasn’t really much I could do about that.”
Now he’d fought fire with fire, he thought it best to extinguish the mess, in the hopes that John wouldn’t bring it up to him the next time they spoke, though considering the inexplicable ache in Sherlock’s chest he doubted that would be soon. “Ah, seemingly the glasses are a secret, I wouldn’t, you squint too much for it to be a secret. Get a pair that’s somewhat stylish and you should be fine, round features, I’d say a rounded rectangle frame would do. Retro is coming into style though. I’ll see you next week then John. Enjoy your afternoon.”
“She’s decorating the hall with Adler.” A fourth year with an accent replied, glancing up at him like he was crazy, before rolling his eyes and going back to his book.
The doctor was standing, his hands clasped behind his back as he listened, or tried to, to Anderson and Donavon talk about whatever nonsense they decided was interesting in that moment. Truthfully he should have been worried that spending too much time engaging with those idiots would reduce John's intellect, but he was too busy staring at the doctor to care.
“Your heart beat faster because you were nervous, you like him back, you have for ages. You just never listened to me.” She dropped off the table and took his hands in hers, forcing him to look her in the eye. “Say yes or so help me Mycroft I will kill you before Sherlock gets the chance.”
“And yours is Myc, I know your little arrangement, that’s secret number one used.” Mycroft frowned, as his little brother sauntered from the greenhouse as though he’d just earned a Nobel Prize.
“The very one. She’s been putting it in your food for the last year and a half.”
Since the altercation of last year John had been abrasive to the idea of Sherlock tutoring him again. This bothered Sherlock slightly, but he decided it wasn’t a matter worth pressing. And thus, Sherlock hadn’t brought up the idea of flying lessons, he half hoped John had forgotten about it, but he knew it was idiotic to think John would forget anything.
She shot up like a light, nearly too quickly for him to tie the end of the braid and turned round excitedly. “The ducks! We have to go quickly daddy, or they’ll already have been fed!” She squealed, dashing from her room to find that tin of sweetcorn.
John smiled, still staring at his books. “Yeah we’re good.”
“Here.” Sherlock replied, and suddenly he was brought back into the reality of the situation.
“I told you I knew.” Sherlock replied, pressing a kiss to John’s temple, grabbing one of his coats from the back of his door. “I have to give Mrs Hudson the rent, meet you downstairs.”
Needless to say, Sherlock couldn't care less.
“The fight- and I- I couldn’t get out- and I- I missed the train- I was going to be- be stuck for two months in this fucking prison- because we fought.” Sherlock was stammering, his eyes were glossy.
Most of the other boys pulled their curtains around their bed, as they decided to succumb to sleep. He scoffed at them silently, staring up at his ceiling until he heard the prefects go up to bed.
The conversation had ranged from praise of Greg and John for normalising their sons, both of which had scowled at them as they did so. To talk of what acid killed off exotic primrose the quickest and Mycroft glaring at Sherlock so harshly John suspected he was plotting murder in his mind.
“Deduced? I’d hardly call it that. Would you like to tell me, John? I can smile and nod, pretend I care if that helps.” He spat, he hadn’t intended it to come out so harsh, but the words fell from his lips with more poison than he could help.
When Sherlock met him, he had been in a deep depressive state, hiding it but not well enough. Sherlock fixed that, John was grateful, though he really had no reason.
Sherlock took this as his cue to get up, waving a finger in her direction, and pacing delicately around John as he spoke. “Oh, he forgot to mention how you payed Jim to stupefy Molly, clever thinking to use a metamorphagus. And it’s
There had been days where John would flinch like he’d been burned if Sherlock touched him, days where he hated his own skin to the point he would curl into the covers. Sherlock knew just to leave him, save to bring him a cup of tea or something to eat so he wasn’t damaging himself.
“You changed the dosage of testosterone you’re using.” Sherlock noted, as he pushed the plunger down slowly and John drew in a breath
And suddenly this was more than just a person crying, Sherlock had been able to watch any tom, dick or harry cry and not feel a thing. This was his best friend crying, this was John.
“Is.” Sherlock corrected, already knowing what John was getting at.
They weren’t talking, given Mycroft’s distaste for idle chatter, but walked in silence save for the crunch of their shoes against the ground. Greg was pressed against his side as they shared his umbrella.
“John I may be good, but I’m not that good.”
He told it immaculately, with no falter in his voice, giving a personality to the characters he spoke as, and Sherlock sat mesmerised as he watched and listened.
Greg was wearing shorts and a dark grey vest top. Needless to say, he was quite the distraction.
The hat muttered to itself, muttered to Sherlock, who paid it no mind, still staring straight ahead.
Being a muggle-born, in a household that was just shy of abusive, it was a surprise, to say the least, when a giant man knocked on his door and dragged him through the streets of London and into a place he’d never seen or heard of before.
“Don’t make out with him the whole way home.” She offered him a wink and a grin before ushering him out of the hall.
“I don’t think my crush would appreciate it.”
“Bored with what?”
“One of the only people then.”
John was turning him into a sap.
Something must really be wrong then.
Mycroft blinked breaking their unannounced staring contest, directing his focus to his cards, clearing his throat. “I’ll go after John, if you go after Sherlock. I propose we set up a study date, and if things don’t go well, then Sherlock will stop staring like a lovesick schoolgirl.”
She glared at him through her tears. “But we- we have so much in common- and- I-“
John smiled at the teenager for taking the bait. “Oh, poor sod went running, slipped and cracked the back of his head, thought he might have a concussion.”
It became a bit clearer that this whole thing would’ve been very apparent to Sherlock and Mycroft, they would have known from the get-go that something was off, yet nobody thought to correct him, or let him know that whatever semblance of love he thought he was feeling was fake.
“Good to know.” John replied. “You know I don’t care if we have sex right? I'm seventeen, it’s not like I’m a stranger.” He wasn’t sure if the noise Sherlock made in response was of questioning or distaste. “When I pretended to be Abby I had people after me, and I went with more than I probably should have. I thought I was supposed to, it helped me forget I guess. I suppose I could’ve achieved the same effect from skydiving or something like that. I’m glad to be myself and be away from that. So, if you don’t want to, now, later, ever. It doesn’t matter.” His voice was tired and he turned to his side a bit more, leaning to press a kiss to Sherlocks forehead.
If Greg was here he would’ve noticed, would’ve cornered him and badgered it out of him until he broke. He always felt better after but he needed the initial few kicks to speak up.
" He moaned.
“’S fair.” Greg replied, sitting up, draining the rest of his pint. His eyes were red around the edges from crying, and there was a hint of bloodshot from the alcohol now coursing through his veins.
“Shut. Up.” He spoke with exasperation in his tone, trying to ignore the embarrassment on his face.
Greg locked eyes with him in a matter of seconds, and he offered a gentle wave to the seeker who smiled in response. Mycroft could see from miles away that he was tense, scared, nervous. He felt under pressure. But Mycroft knew just as well that he would notice the snitch and go for it with his all.
“Can we daddy?” She asked, having forgotten that John had said they were supposed to be meeting somebody specifically.
The sloppiness of his dishonesty annoyed Sherlock than the act itself.
Three times makes a habit. John didn’t acknowledge that he
“Mycroft Holmes? Afraid?”
Mycroft could only hum in response to that, his left hand was beginning to feel weirdly empty.
He had one of Sherlock’s hands in his own, for a reason he hadn't figured out yet.
Sherlock never really minded being alone. Solitude kept him safe.
Sherlock had been there every morning and every night when John put a binder on, and took it off again, his back turned to the detective.
“That’s a small price to pay for you to love yourself as much as I do.”
“You know what? I think it bothers you.” John grinned, taking Sherlock’s hand in one of his, and his broom in the other pulling him off and the broom out from under him, so he handed on his feet with a thud. “That I’m better than you at something.”
.” He repeated.
"You smartass. I-I'm fuck-" He jolted forward, his face pressed against Sherlocks collar bone as he moaned into the taller man's porcelain skin. His moans were deep and guttural, they went straight to Sherlock's cock. "I'm so c-close." He spoke, softly enough that he thought Sherlock wouldn't hear it.
“What the
However, the moment he sat down at the table he almost regretted not choosing Gryffindor, as a fair haired second-year boy across the tables, caught his eye. He was muttering something to the person beside him, and Sherlock cursed his inability to read lips, but he could’ve sworn the boy said something about his name.
It was the last day of school. Sherlock hadn't slept since they’d let him out for the night of celebration which was kind of them, he supposed.
“You coming to the commons?”
He knew John didn’t want him to see his chest in its current state.
Sarah!?” He shouted just loud enough for the table over to take notice, and soon silence but a whisper cascaded over the hall, the teachers seemed to take no notice. He stood up, face riddled with fake anger, Sherlock said it would fly fine so long as she was blinded by her own rage.
“You’re uncomfortable” Sherlock pointed out and turned his head, lifting it up to rest on John’s shoulder, but John didn’t want to look at him.
“I mean were you planning to?” John asked, letting out a quiet giggle at the notion, Sherlock smirked with an eyeroll.
He curved his fingers under the tougher fabric at the front, the fabric that didn’t stretch. With efficiency and as little contact as he could manage, he got it over John’s chest, and John visibly relaxed. He was slightly unsure if it would be too far but considering John couldn’t do it to its full extent, he completed John’s flattening ritual.
He had it done by the time the car arrived at their home.
His reflexes were sluggish, his vision was blurring, and his head kept drooping as he struggled to keep it up and pay attention. This time he didn’t get hit in the face, he didn’t panic, he was just worse than usual.
“Somehow, I now think you’ll be the one with dissatisfaction.” Sherlock replied, following suit and pushing himself to his feet, coming so close John had to tilt his head back to make eye contact with him. “Now if you want to stop your whining and kiss me, I wouldn’t be opposed.”
“A controlling bitch, yeah.” John corrected, not censoring the venom that filled his tone.
It wasn’t until Sherlock placed on of his hands at John’s waistband did he jolt, hard, forward and away from Sherlock. His eyes were wide, and he squeezed his eyes shut, he hated that feeling.
Ignoring the glare given to him by the prefect, he walked practically silent up to the dormitories before falling into the sheets of his bed, fresh, clean, barely used.
Breaking from his thoughts he braced himself for the shot. Just as Sherlock was about to push the plunger down a pang of guilt hit John in the chest.
He hadn't been focusing, reliving the nightmare he’d woken up from, and suddenly there it was, a whole lot of pain straight into his face. Apparently they’d begun doing penalties and he hadn't realised.
Anthea gave a soft hum, the buttons of her blackberry clicking in the otherwise silent room, the screen casting a whiter light onto her face than the candle. “Theories then?”
Sherlock frowned, furrowing his eyebrows. “For what?”
He let out a deep breath, smiling gently as Sherlock copied him, his own breath coming out shaky and finished with a hiccup, but it was better than the hyperventilated cries he’d been making earlier.
“What?”
Nobody else was up, it was late, and he was trying desperately to get better, despite the shakiness in his hands from the cold of the room. He had a written test for Charms in the morning, and Flitwick, despite his cheery nature, was starting to get sick of him tearing through his paper with the pen nib.
Greg sighed, glancing up from the table, stirring his fork through his curry. “Do you know Sarah Sawyer?” He asked, and Mycroft eyebrow quirked up, as he swallowed a forkful of his own meal.
“I'm doing adequately, thank you.”
“A sprain, like I told them an hour and a half ago.” John grumbled as they walked out of the hospital. “Why would they trust a bloody doctor? It’s not like I trained in this ruddy hospital for Christ sake.” He spoke angrily, and Sherlock kept his head up, barely able to conceal a smile as he hailed a cab.
Mycroft Holmes sighed, straightening his robes as he patrolled the carriages.
“My sister is a lesbian, I think if I cared I’d be quite the asshole, don’t you?”
John smiled up at him once she closed the book, he took his mug from Sherlock with a grateful nod, and he handed Rosie her cup, she looked at it in disgust. “It’s tea, I don’t like tea.” She frowned, and John gave him a look of
“You’re Sherlock aren’t you?” He asked, taking a seat opposite the first-year, who looked at him quizzically. “Myc’s little brother yeah?”
to get hung up on things like that. “You’ve already apologised and I’ve already forgiven you, I didn’t think there was anything else to discuss.”
John sighed in frustration and turned on his heel to follow Mycroft, casting a wave back to Sherlock’s parents before turning quickly so he wouldn’t lose the Head Boy in their wild goose chase.
They could be here for days.
Then it was the train home, and more mindless supervision until he could sit beside his friends. This time he sat beside Greg, rather than across. He ignored Anthea’s eyebrow raise in favour of staring out the window when Greg took his hand, leaning against the prefect as he began to fall asleep. He found it rather difficult to keep his somewhat dignified composure when there was a very attractive Gryffindor pressed against him and breathing onto his neck. By some miracle, he managed, and Anthea didn’t speak a word.
“You remember when we went to Diagon Alley? And I said about Sarah?” He replied, tracing patterns into the table, ignoring Greg’s stare, avoiding it even, which was even more concerning.
He froze, glancing over at the taller man, who was staring out the window at the streets as they drove past.
"That you're transgender? Like I said, why would I? I have no reason not to like it, as I thought I clearly demonstrated moments ago. The number of people I'd be willing do do that with is limited to one."
“Yes, Angus, all the maths I teach you is indeed applicable to life. Except for one topic, the topic I’m about to teach you. I wouldn’t if I didn’t have to, but unfortunately they refuse to take it off the course no matter how much I protested to them.” He took a breath, and a quick glance over the classroom to make sure everyone was attentive, a young girl was currently checking her twitter notifications behind her pencil case, of course, they never learn. He snapped his fingers in her direction. “Sally, any idea what this topic might be?”
“Well me, and whoever comes round, Stamford, Sholto. I'm fairly unattached for the most part, but war’ll do that to you.”
Then again, he was the man that managed to persuade the DI of Scotland Yard to look into a case of child abuse.
“If you want to leave your broom in the shed you can, though I'm sure my parents wouldn’t be opposed to looking at what you use.” The prefect spoke, grabbing Greg’s trunk before he could, and heading inside.
never pick GCSE art.
"That I'm not- That I don't have..." John sighed, he couldn't work out how to phrase it.
He ignored how his face began to heat up, saved by the door opening and the two teenagers emerging. Sherlock trunk in hand, John with the same frustrated expression on his face, the confused expression that Mycroft imagined mirrored his thoughts most of the time.
well then. “I don’t need your help.”
“If you say so.” Harry replied with a laugh, John missed that. “How was school?”
“I don’t follow.”
That changed quickly.
“You look dead.” He deadpanned. Sherlock thought that was a bit dramatic on John’s part, he was pale and skinny, in no way was he dead, unless bewitched, dead bodies didn’t normally move. “What the hell are you playing at?” John seemed upset and Sherlock frowned, he hadn't expected that reaction. “Are you trying to kill yourself? What the hell is this?”
“You said it yesterday and I’d like to hear it again sometime before my next class. Besides, I bought that bread you like on my lunch break. ”
“You have a question. Whats bothering you?” Greg asked, breaking the comfortable silence that had been established since they’d begun the walk. All the necessary small talk had been taken care of over dinner in the great hall, and now they were alone, Greg had seemingly decided to appease his curiosity of what was irritating the taller boy.
what he called him. “Myc?” He asked, smirking as a blush formed on the older boys cheeks.
“I should’ve worked it out. I'm glad I didn’t.” Greg offered him a look of question. “I think I needed you to ask to jumpstart everything. I had to ask Anthea to know what was happening.”
“You need to be when you’re supervising twenty-seven six-year-olds.” Sherlock replied, a small smile finding his features as John laughed. “I do side work for the Police, that’s how I get favours from Gavin when he owes me. The Norton case wasn’t even his division. Though, my brother insisted I get a sustainable income, so here I am.”
“No? Was I meant to? I thought he was with-“
Conrad hummed. “Deductions?”
He hadn't been able to sleep, nightmares kept plaguing every inch of unconsciousness he was able to find. Not his mum this time, which honestly should’ve been a relief. But it wasn’t, because it was Sherlock getting hurt this time.
“What’s he like, personality wise?” Mycroft asked, enjoying the annoyed hum that fell from Greg’s lips as he was forced to pick up two cards.
Sherlock watched. His head hurt.
“We got in a scrap, poor thing got her nose broke.” She spoke, holding her hand up and clenching her fist as if she was examining it. “Threatened to use her blackmail on me out me to the whole school but I told her I didn’t give two shits. She’s a controlling bitch.” She shrugged again, making a face as if to say
Sitting up, he glanced around the dorm. There were a few cages set atop dressers, ranging from rats to cats, though he’d advised the owners of said animals, to pick beds on opposite sides of the room.
John wore his binders almost religiously at this point. Sherlock had watched him put them on and take them on countless times. The doctor had a total of three. A white one, a black one, and a camouflage green one, all of which just reached his waist, leaving his midriff exposed, which was left often bruised by Sherlocks mouth.
He couldn’t breathe.
The game progressed swiftly from there.
“How?”
John’s ears went red, and he laughed a little. “Thanks, Sherlock.” He paused for a second. “Do you want to exchange gifts now?”
This left his head at a convenient position. He went with his hand first, licking his fingers before stroking over John's clitoris, enlarged as a result of testosterone. He heard John gasp, and took it as a sign to continue. He pressed gentle kisses up Johns thigh, his hand still going at a steady pace, before his mouth took over.
Sherlock smiled at him, and his stomach flipped at the genuine looking beam on his features. “I smile dotingly in response, then what?”
“You know I will.” He held the box, tilting it gently, listening, before bringing it to his face, sniffing. When he sat it in his lap again, he looked up at John. “It smells like you, you’ve kept it in a clothes drawer or wardrobe to hide it or keep it safe. It’s valuable, or sellable at the very least. Size of the box says jewellery, not a ring, nor earrings, so wrist or neckwear. You know I don’t wear necklaces as they interfere with my scarf, so wristwear it is. Weight reads as two things, a charm-bracelet or watch, whilst I’d wear it regardless, I doubt you’d get me a charm-bracelet. So, watch.”
Slipped off might have been a bit of romanticising, it was rather Mycroft glaring at John and mouthing Library, before walking out of the room like nothing had happened.
“O-Okay.” His voice was broken, quiet, weaker than John had ever heard it and he swallowed down the anxiety that threatened to build.
Sherlock took his other hand gently, locking their fingers as a gesture of comfort. “I’m sorry.” He spoke quietly, his voice a deep rumble in his throat.
John Watson was quite surprised when a lanky ginger prefect decided to loom over him in the Gryffindor common room. He was minding his own business, trying to get better at using the stupid feather quill that had been on his list, and that every teacher insisted he used. It felt stupid when he had a biro in pocket, but they refused to let him use it.
“You’re nervous.” The elder stated, raising an eyebrow and Greg shrugged in defence, picking up one of Mycroft's umbrellas, handing it to him in an attempt to suggest they needed to go.
“Two, sir.”
“Yeah, uhm, thanks.” John replied awkwardly, pulling away, and Sherlock smiled softly.
Mycroft took Greg’s hand sensing his anxiety. “Into battle?” He offered and Greg smiled gently, squeezing Mycroft's hand.
