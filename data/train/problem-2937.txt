That question had been sitting on their shoulders for days now, making itself known as a relentless twist in their stomachs, an ache in their ribs that pulled and gutted.
But this hug wasn’t like the ones they shared before diving into the fire, uncertain whether they’d ever see each other again. It wasn’t all pressure and warmth, reluctant to pull away, determined to leave an impression; but rather gentle in a way that proved to be unraveling Dean faster than anything.
“We know Chuck could pull angel’s out of the Empty, but there’s no guarantee that Jack can do the same. We don’t know the extent of his powers, and without a sample of Cas’s blood there would be no way to summon him.”
“I’m here, Sam,” He said in greeting, and Sam whipped around to find the kid smiling at him, his hand held up in a subdued little wave. “I never left. I told you, I’ll be watching over you all until Cas heals from the connection. That way, the plan won't... 'screw us in the ass' as Dean put it.”
As if the guy wasn’t unbearable enough fully clothed. Now Dean had to deal with him when his shirt was rucked up, pants unbuckled and pulled down just enough for Dean to see sharp hip bones and a happy trail that made his gut lurch.
It’s an attest to just how well Dean really knows his little brother that when Sam looked at him next, nothing but a sigh leaving his lungs and a slight heat stirring at the corners of his mouth, Dean already knew he’d made a wrong turn.
“You know what I mean. A different different,” He tossed Sam the water without looking, and the two of them swapped places, fluent and familiar with the way in which they brushed past each other. Dean sprawled himself across the bench, ignoring the sudden twinge in his back as he continued, “Like… a bigger different. Super different.”
Sam was the first to reach the door, bursting inside with his gun already drawn, but Dean was practically running him over from behind, heart pounding through his blood, searching and searching until—
“Out getting food to take back to the motel. We didn’t bring much to eat, none of us figured we’d be here long.”
“But…” Cas made a vague gesture, lips turning downward. He looked almost guilty for a moment, eyes impossibly caring despite not knowing a single thing about the men standing in front of him. “I— I’m hurt. I’m not sure I should leave here.”
“I am,” Cas said, abrupt enough to make Dean's heart drop. Cas gave a mangled little smile, and told him, “You make me sad.”
“Whew! You boys just don’t stop do you?” He exclaimed, face splitting upwards with a teetering grin. “And here I was thinkin’ that I’d let you live. I’ve got no business with you, no hard feelings— though I probably ought to, knowing your history with my kind.”
“Cas,” Dean stopped short of Sam’s room, suddenly worried. He willed his pulse to calm down, voice lowering, “I’m begging you— for once, look out for yourself. No more helping angels. Until we figure out what the hell is going on, trust nobody.”
And he sounded like a child, but for the first time Dean didn’t care. His brain was on fire and his heart was hurting, and in that moment Dean didn’t have the filter to keep all his usual crap tucked neatly away.
“Listen, I can’t imagine what you’re feeling right now, man. But all I can say is that it gets better. It does. It’s just gonna take some time, that’s all.” Dean said, somehow managing to actually look Cas in the eye as he spoke.
It made Dean miss the days when he thought he didn’t deserve something more. Something like what Sam and Eileen had, because at least then he didn’t risk having his joy for them swallowed by a selfish need to have the same thing.
Or at least Dean couldn’t allow himself to think so. He wasn’t sure there was a way out if he went down that path, the spindling thought of Cas and humanity and the choice to abandon it all— abandon everything he’d been just to look at Dean from level ground, just to breathe the same air and drag through time with his feet firmly planted. Dean didn’t want to think about it; what he’d
He was just… standing there. Strong and ever unbreakable even as the wind tore at the lapels of his coat, sent his hair spirling into wild tufts that circled his head, tickled his ears.
In a half desperate attempt at getting somewhere, Sam began chanting Latin with a sharp tongue, forcing the syllables out fast and precise. It was a long shot and they both knew it, but Dean still couldn’t stop himself from crying out, “Sam!” when he saw his brother go flying backward into the wall, gun clattering to the ground as he gulped for air.
“It varies depending on the person. Castiel’s been avoiding his memories for almost two months at this point. He was resisting me, but I managed to slip into his subconscious. It won’t be as painful for him now.”
Not by anyone, but especially not by someone like Cas whose eagerness to get closer to Dean actually mattered. And so Dean, having never even thought about his favorite color since he was still waddling around on a fresh lawn in Lawrence, Kansas, wiped two palm fulls of grease down his jeans and rolled his way out from underneath Baby to show Cas that he was smiling.
Denying it felt useless. Dean had spent half his life denying it; ignoring just how much he craved normalcy and a good night's rest without feeling the dig of a gun buried under his pillow. But he couldn’t just say yes either. With yes came a mountain of other shit Dean didn’t think he could say aloud. It meant saying
Dean’s conflicting feelings with Sam and Eileen is something I went back and forth on for a while, but with Dean knowing he could have had something similar that is now out of reach, ultimately I decided that jealousy would be the only accurate response.
Vaguely, Dean could hear music playing through the dashboard, a cassette tape still lodged into the deck. The volume was low, barely there. So quiet in fact that Dean couldn’t even tell what was playing, but he clung to it anyway. Let it wash some sense of normalcy over him while he caught his breath.
It’s Sam who moved first, throwing away month's worth of bitterness and heartache to pull Jack in by the neck, embracing him under the warm mist and haloed circle of a street lamp waning in the dark. Sam had done this plenty of times before, seeking touch to tether himself to reality, needing to know he was seeing the truth, but never had he felt someone hold him back with the same intensity.
It was overwhelming. Too much and not enough at the same time, and Dean felt like it wasn’t something he could face head on.
“No, sir,” Sam said, recovering with a short cough. “We’re just here looking into the…” He hesitated, lips twitching downward. He glanced at Dean nervously. “Strange blue light?”
Until it wasn’t. Until the symbol behind it became one of betrayal rather than loyalty. Until the world turned dark and the Apocalypse reared high and Dean couldn’t even wear it without it burning a hole straight through his chest.
By the time Castiel woke up, his throat torn raw and his body aching all over, Jack was gone, and Dean was forced to do what he always did: lie.
Then, almost tactical, Cas let out a breath, and the warmth of it fanned out across Dean's lips, leaving the skin warm and buzzing, his heart stuttering in place.
“Jody’s a friend,” Dean explained, fingers fidgeting against the wheel. “She was working a case just a few states over when I called her to check up on you.”
Dean was on autopilot then, rushing to throw on a jacket and tuck his phone into his pocket so he could get the hell out of there. He hadn’t left the bunker since Cas had been back. More like refused to, afraid of… anything, really. He was scared that the moment he left things would start falling apart around him, slowly but surely. It wouldn’t be the first time.
“Make things right?” Sam asked, and his face was already beginning to whiten, beads of sweat pressing in hot at his hairline as his shoulder screamed in agony.
“His face!” Cas yelled through a gasping breath, struggling in the man’s arms. “There’s something wrong with—”
Something told Dean that Cas wouldn’t have felt guilty about stealing a few days ago. He would’ve known it was wrong. Dean had taught him that much about humanity. But it wouldn’t have given Cas the same grief that it was now, newly human and inexplicably lost.
With a wave of the demon’s wrist, the door behind Dean flew back on its hinges and slammed closed, rattling a painting clean off the wall where it shattered across the linoleum. The click of the lock echoed in the stillness.
Sam stared back, gaze heavy where he lingered on the exhaustion blooming beneath Dean’s eyes in dark purple streaks. There was a tremor buzzing in his hand. His eyes wavered in their struggle to focus.
“I mean you’re family,” Sam heaved. And he always had been, through the lies and hurt and countless misunderstandings— Jack had never stopped being family, but Jack didn’t know that. Sam wasn’t sure he’d ever really known. “I mean we missed you.
Dean looked at him questionably, wanting to ask, but it dawned on him quickly that the state of Cas’s face probably made it hard for him to do anything, let alone smile.
Dean felt something pierce his heart and unravel inside him, making itself at home, burrowing there deep.
“There’s not a whole lot I can tell you right now,” Dean said, thumb brushing over the jut of bone on the outside of Cas’s ankle. “We don’t know what this is or how to deal with it, but we will figure it out. It’s what we do. For the meantime, the bad news is, telling you anything about the past could do some real damage, and I’m not lookin’ to have you getting hurt again, understand?’
“You’re fine,” Dean eventually whispered, and neither of them mentioned the gravel in his throat. Neither of them brought up how clear of a lie it really was. “Everything’s fine, it’s— it’s not even that bad, really. It’s not even that bad. Nothing a little ice won’t fix.”
When Dean turned around, it was Cas standing in the archway, his hands raised to his stomach, brows pinched weakly. He stared at them, features broken up and dismayed.
“Man, I must be losing my mind, cause I know you’re not still thinking about it,” Dean dragged his eyes up to Sam’s. “I was talking about Jack, Sam. What’s the word on Jack?”
“I did not fall out of your car,” He muttered, looking down at his shoes. “I… struggled to exit the vehicle.”
“It’s fine, Cas. Really, I just… I don’t know,” Dean couldn’t quite look at Cas once he’d gotten his coffee and slid into the seat across from him. There was a pressure building behind his ribs, and he felt as if he was bursting when he finally said, “I’m worried about you.”
” Sam groaned, snapping his head back towards Eileen who was laughing sporadically now, a hand drawn over her mouth.
“I remember the deal you made to save your brother,” Cas answered, effectively stealing the words from Dean’s mouth and turning his shock into panic. Cas gave him a pleading look, head shaking. “Don’t look at me like that. Please don’t look scared.”
When Dean finally reached the door, something like fire burning beneath his skin, Miracle was already there pawing at the frame. His fur was damp from a recent bath, and he had a patch of suds clinging to his shoulder where someone hadn’t dried him off well enough.
Cas fell asleep without much trouble, his body collapsing in on itself, but Dean couldn’t follow. His eyes found solace in their study over the ceiling above him, and his pulse seemed to be stuck on a steady rise and fall that made sleeping sound nauseating, just the thought of it making Dean’s eyes water.
“God goes dark side, shit hits the fan, but none of that matters because Jack brought Eileen back. Jack brought everyone back, good as new— so why is Cas the fucking exception, huh? Why do I feel like getting him back this time was just a worse way of losing him?”
But the urge was unusually strong this time, pounding away in his ears. Dean’s eyes softened when they landed on Castiel’s lips, watching his breath fan out over pink skin, studying the flash of tongue and teeth when he wetted them.
There was a crack of thunder outside, near enough to shake the earth and rattle silverware against pinched napkins. The lights flickered briefly, a distorted glitch, and when Dean’s eyes adjusted he looked up at the waitress to find her watching him intently, waiting for a better reply.
That one word sent Dean straightening up in his chair, swallowing a wave of choking relief. “Cas? S’ that you?”
“Cas would have come out the other side coughing his lungs out, Dean. Angels ripping each other’s graces out used to be a form of treason, it’s different than angels doing it themselves— different from
That was the dream. That was the only ‘more’ Dean had ever been able to imagine, and by now he knew it well. He just wasn’t sure it was something he could have with his family ripped apart.
” Cas admitted softly, searching, finding a feeling in his chest and latching on even if he didn’t understand it.
He needed him back. Dean needed Cas to come back, and it was more than just an ever-glowing thought, a never ending mantra of
The rest of the week carried on in a similar fashion, Dean retreating to the shadows every time he was reminded that it wasn’t really Cas taking up the bedroom down the hall. It wasn’t really Cas walking around in pajama pants and eating pizza like it was just your average Sunday, and it was because of this that he didn’t understand Dean’s hovering, didn’t catch on to the jokes Dean made on the regular and had grouchily explained to him years ago.
“Sam! Sammy!” Dean let out a weakened shout, teeth gritting. He could barely see through the halls he was passing, tears and adrenaline making for a mesh of color and rigid shapes. “Please, god— don’t do this, Cas. Don’t do this to me again, you bastard—”
He couldn’t remember loving it, or knowing it, but when he awoke there was a beacon missing from the sky and an ache in Castiel’s bones and he knew that whatever it was— he wished for it desperately.
At first glance, it was hard for Dean to tell where the bruises ended and the skin began. Castiel’s back was nothing but two jagged lines of darkened rot, the color that had once been warm faded to a mesh of black and blue right where the memory of wings used to reside. These bruises were fresh, the first evidence of pain that had been there all along, and Dean didn’t know what to think.
Dean turned his back before he could see the shift in Cas’s demeanor, autopilot sending him straight towards the coffee machine. The sound of Cas dropping his spoon and shifting in his seat was loud. It pressed for Dean’s attention like a tap on the shoulder, a persistent itch at the base of his skull.
“Uh huh,” Dean shook his head. “Look, I don’t know what’s giving you cold feet, but if there’s symptoms of something bigger here, we need to get a jump on whatever it is and get you help. Sam can—”
Dean reached for the wrinkled paper in Castiel’s hands, and his breath stilled when their fingers brushed, the barest contact enough to pull his heart back down from his throat. Cas didn’t say anything as Dean smoothed the paper out across his thigh, looking at the list of ingredients, but his eyes trailed him wordlessly.
“Have you even slept at all yet?” Dean stripped his jacket off and threw it over the nearest chair, trying to act like his hands weren’t buzzing to reach out.
Dean shouldn’t have to think about these things anymore. He shouldn’t have to answer the kind of questions he’d expect to hear from a stranger passing through a bar, not from his best friend of twelve years who Dean had lived and bled and ached for since what felt like forever, since what
His voice rang against the silence, and Dean felt eyes flock towards him from all directions. He could hear Jody heave a disappointed sigh right in his ear, muffled and wrong, but it was a different voice that had him crumbling completely, eyes bursting with heat.
“What place do you love the most?” Cas mumbled around a mouthful of Skittles, glancing up from their kitchen poker game to admire the way Dean looked at him through long eyelashes, barely even blinking.
There was something in his voice that had Dean raising his head almost shyly, looking at Cas from over the roof of the Impala.
Leaving Sam meant failing him, failing everything, and Dean couldn’t. In every sense of the word, Dean couldn’t.
There was never a time where he hadn’t. And then, because Dean was already falling, already fumbling for Cas’s hand— he breathed in deep and said, “I fucking
By the time Sam finally made it out of the shower, Dean’s head was dressed and bandaged. His headache was fading thanks to a handful of medicine that he hadn’t looked too closely at before forcing down, but Dean liked to think that the kiss Eileen pressed to his head after patching him up was his real savior.
“Sammy tell you that?” Dean scoffed, grinning ear to ear as he settled at a register and started pulling items from his basket onto the conveyor belt.
Dean didn’t answer. He frowned as he typed out a response and pressed send, leaning back in his seat.
Dean shook on the inside, some black waste of space behind his ribcage splitting open to fill up and ache with light. Flare with hope and goodness and
“You’re human now, Cas. At least for the time being. Which means it’s my job to teach you a few things,” He maneuvered Cas out of the way with a hand on his hip, reaching for the razor by the sink. He held it up with a smile, “First up. Shaving.”
Dean snatched up the Impala's keys before he could come up with much of a plan. He waved them in front of the group, smiling like he meant it, and soon they were all piling into the car with Dean leading the way. Dean knew heading to the nearest bar wasn’t much of an idea, but he was eager for a drink and lying was always easier without the drone of silence.
“But you want my memories back too. I can see it. Every time you look at me I can see it— like you expect more from me,” Cas heaved, on the verge of something desperate, something buried deep and clawing free, and all Dean could do was stare back and watch the pieces scatter.
He was making out with Cas in the bathroom in the middle of the night, both of them stinking of booze and leather with Cas freshly shaved and Dean high off adrenaline, floating— for what felt like the first time, painlessly.
Close. Dean knew he was close, but in the end it was Cas who found Dean, calling from some payphone in the middle of nowhere.
It wasn’t uncommon for Cas to leave out of nowhere. No explanation, no warning just- gone. But having Cas disappear on him right then, in that moment, when he’d been teetering on the edge of something dangerous, had Dean taking every single one of his feelings and guarding them back towards his chest.
“Nothing’s wrong,” Dean said. Cas didn’t move his gaze, brow dipping with what Dean could still recognize as worry. Dean hurriedly fumbled with the radio, speaking over a sudden onslaught of music when he asked, “Were you sleeping when I called?”
“Jack?” Dean stared at his hands as he spoke, waiting for the smallest flicker, the most minute sign.
“What’s that saying again? What doesn’t kill you…” Dean slowly stepped to the left, and reached behind Sam to take his beer back. He stared at Sam as he drained the rest of it, scratching that urge just behind the swell of his teeth that he knew would only come back stronger, and his heart remained a heavy, broken thing that batted against his sternum. “I’m fine, Sam. Hell, I’ve got beer and bacon in the fridge— I’m friggin’ fantastic. Let it go.”
“Family are the ones who are able to hurt you the most,” Dean told him, and there was a wave that followed. An ache filled with Jack’s mistakes and Mary’s lies and Sam’s secrets. Of Cas leaving and failing and
The bunker got quiet shockingly fast and Dean started packing his duffel bag before he could talk himself out of it. Sam had found a possible Ghoul case in Texas, a ten-hour drive at the least if Dean really pushed it, and the two of them and Eileen were out on the road by sunrise the next day.
“Is it really you?” Dean couldn’t keep from asking, his hope too fragile, everything important hanging in the balance. He stepped closer to the bed, painfully slow, and gripped the metal frame at the foot of it. “You’re alive. I mean, you’re— you’re really...
They sped out of the parking lot just as the first blare of sires started off in the distance, the sight of red and blue in the rear view mirror making Dean laugh while Cas looked past the back seat nervously, bottom lip wringing between his teeth.
This was the type of serenity Dean used to feel guilty for. The kind of thoughtless happiness that was all floating worries and sharp snaps of reality and thinking
It always started with the shoes and ended with the shirt, both of them undressing in the kind of silence Dean thought should be uncomfortable. The rustling of clothes and the clink of a sliding belt should be awkward, but mostly Dean just felt warm, his skin buzzing all over, his senses blown to life.
“Let me make something clear here,” Cas lifted his head to look at Dean, eyes shining. “I can’t lose you. I won’t.”
Eileen turned to him, eyebrows raising. “And that means double for you,” She snapped, forcing Dean to straighten, his voice dropping with certainty.
“Of course not,” Cas said thickly, voice drawled with horror. Just the absurdity in his words made Dean smile, his heart settling back where it belonged. “I, along with the rest of Heaven have no aversion towards homosexuality. God intended for there to be all forms of love.”
A train blared in the distance, a stream of light cutting through the trees and heading North. Dean looked up through squinted eyes, trying to find the warehouse he knew was somewhere nearby; at the very least, he could still remember that.
“Come on, man, let me see. Shirt off,” Dean said, trying to sound encouraging, but his own ears heard nothing but blatant excitement, and Dean dropped his gaze against a rush of crimson red, his face burning with it.
And Dean didn’t know what he’d expected; two years was a long time after all. But when he took a step back, forcing himself to really look at Claire for the first time, he knew that whatever the hell it was he’d been expecting, this wasn’t it.
It wasn’t until Dean had his hand on the front door that Cas finally caught up to him, his presence a gentle curl of fingers at the bottom of Dean’s jacket. Dean looked down at Cas’s hand and made his way up, eyebrows raised.
“Dude,” Dean grabbed two menus from the corner of the table and chunked one at Cas. “You think they got pie? You need some pie.”
He even says Dean’s name the same way. Gentle and overbearing all at once, pushing through the mesh of it like it’s the single most important word in the universe, the only thing that comes out of his mouth with a piece of his being still attached.
"Wait, you think...?” He searched Cas’s eyes, sadness punching him right in the chest. He let out a tearful breath. “Fuck, Cas, you got it all wrong, I’m not uncomfortable. With this, or- or with you. Not at all.” Dean assured quickly, eyes wide and hurt, watching Cas’s vulnerability tilt on a balance beam of uncertainty.
“All we can do is wait. Jack will get back to us eventually, but for now, we’ve got nothing, Dean,” Sam sighed, laying his palms flat over the lid of his laptop. “Until then, we’ll keep looking for answers— of course we will. But I just figured, I don’t know. Why sit here when we could be out doing our job?”
Cas went eerily still, his face a blur of red and purple that simmered over his skin and made the striking vein running down the center of his forehead pulse like a lifeline waiting to give out.
It was only early afternoon and yet Dean got out of the Impala to find the air much crisper than it had been that morning, the chill of it making his neck prick up.
“Then what did you mean?” Cas asked gently, replacing that anger with confusion, masking that pain with the effort to understand, and Dean decided it was too much.
And then, because Dean wasn’t thinking about anything but wiping that look off Cas’s face, he shrugged and said, “I think it looks good.”
In the moment, Dean was too flustered to care all that much about what Cas was doing, why he had almost made Dean crash into a damn traffic barrier for no apparent reason. But once a few minutes passed just like that, Cas standing outside, motionless, Dean in the Impala, dazed and confused, Dean’s desire to
“It’s not like you’d remember even if you had, Einstein,” Dean mumbled. Cas squinted at him, clearly wanting to ask who the fuck Einstein was, but Dean just waved him off with a roll of his eyes and helped him to his feet, the two of them staggering towards the exit of the garage in a discombobulated shuffle.
Cas was accompanying Dean as he waxed his car and took out the trash and cleaned the fucking kitchen, attached to his hip like a homeless puppy, and Dean quickly learned that normal life with Cas was strange. Whether it was a good strange or not— Dean couldn’t decide. Maybe it would have been better if it was actually real. If seeing Cas in his most genuine form didn’t remind Dean that it wasn't really Cas at all.
Castiel met Dean’s eyes once he was finally standing on solid ground, confusion making his features tighten adorably when he asked, in complete seriousness, “Does that not sound the least bit outlandish to you?”
Sam knew what he feared, even when he saw what he wanted, but he needed to be sure. He needed to know— to ask, because this could go one of two ways, and Sam hadn’t had the privilege of seeing both. He’d picked his path, made his choice, and that had gotten him hitchhiking to California with nothing more than the clothes on his back and ten dollars worth of change.
tactical, everything Dean had lost a grip on sometime between driving to Colorado and grabbing Cas’s hand, and Dean had all the intentions in the world to agree.
Dean stopped mid stride, phone propped up with his shoulder, hands filled with laptops and beer. He started walking again just a second later, setting his things down in the map room, but his face was set with a permanent frown now.
“Then text him, Dean,” Sam frowned. “You can talk to him and still save the big stuff until you’re ready, but he misses you. This Cas isn't used to living without you.”
“Even I know that’s not true,” Cas said, and it’s the same voice, the same mindlessly comforting tone that surfaced as a feeling in Dean’s chest rather than a rumble in his ears, and he flinched against the weight of it.
and Dean felt that light in his chest sizzle and gasp, bending around air, still burning on against all odds.
Dean hadn’t known Eileen planned to come with them, not until he saw her standing at the passenger side mirror pulling her hair into a ponytail, but he found himself accepting it rather easily. He patted her on the back as he passed, giving her a small smile that seemed to surprise her, and she returned it with double the effort.
“Miracle!” Dean called suddenly, letting out a whistle that echoed throughout the entire bunker, hands clapping in front of him. “Here boy, daddy’s home!”
“Jack?” The silence became impossibly tighter, Dean’s voice only highlighting the vastness of it. He dropped his head, eyebrows pinching. “Kid, if there was ever a chance for you to fix things— and I mean
Dean took an awkward step forward, smiling through the falter. “Three cheeseburgers to-go, please. Oh— and one with extra onions. Thanks, sweetheart.”
In one confident swing of his arm, Cas forced the piece of glass he’d been hiding towards the demon’s face, aiming for an eye and
going to take pictures. Dean had even given Cas a copy, failing to mention how he’d also kept one for himself.
Dean didn’t know how he knew. It was nothing but an instinct, a theory built off of a tethered feeling he couldn’t even describe. Just above his sternum, lodged somewhere deep, was this undeniable sense that there was something off about the whole thing. How Cas survived, how he escaped. This time coming back more damaged, his memory that spanned for millions of years erased.
Either way, Dean was laughing by the time he was out of the car and jogging across the parking lot to the front door.
It was his own voice that rang back to him, and with it came a drilling silence that made the bruise at Dean’s temple pulse with pain. Wetness seeped into his eyes, clumping in his lashes and sliding past his nose where it bubbled at his lips, gurgled in his throat. Dean blinked through it and brushed the sensation away with a shaky palm.
Cas was falling. Dean could see that now, all of that confidence from before, all of that forced serenity and understanding was dripping away like wet paint, a false mask. He was just as afraid as Dean, troubled by where they stood; this strange inbetween of friendship and love that neither of them knew how to navigate, and for Dean that was all he needed to reach up and take Cas’s hand.
If he had just a handful of seconds against Dean’s years. If he could still recall what a nervous mess Dean had been as he’d slid the tape over to Cas in the middle of a diner in Ohio. How Dean’s gaze had never left the table top, and his hands had reached self consciously for the salt shakers even before Cas could take it and blink up at him with a silent question of
“This guy, where is he now? What’d you do with him?” Dean asked heatedly, much more urgent than he’d been before.
“Yeah?” Dean laughed. “You used to scarf those things down by the handful, man. Or, that’s what you told me anyway.”
And the confusion didn’t startle Sam this time. It wasn’t fueled from ignorance or disbelief, but rather from loving bewilderment, an incredulous
Cas didn’t say anything when Dean finally pulled into a motel. Dean just turned off the ignition, dragged his duffel from the back seat to the front, and Cas was already getting out of the car without a word.
He sent it with a panicked tap, and promptly dropped his phone to the backseat floorboard, his face burning alive. Sam snickered from the driver’s seat, hardly deterred when Dean swatted at his hair.
There was judgment in her voice, glaring and shrillful for a woman who sacrificed herself for the greater good. For
” Sam dove forward and snatched the Impala’s keys from Dean’s pocket, succeeding before Dean’s vision could even try to catch up. He held them up in the air triumphantly, smirking, “—is that I’m driving.”
Dean barely had the chance to be disappointed; Castiel drew in again after only seconds apart, slotting his leg between Dean’s, inching impossibly closer. Dean held his breath and willed his heart to slow, aching with a lifetime's worth of fear that seemed to be ripped from him the second he felt lips skim over the colored bruise at his temple.
Sam was quiet for a long moment, and Dean was suddenly grateful that the sunglasses hid the way his eyes grew wide with panic.
It’s a testament of how much Dean’s really changed when he answered, not even flinching, “He died on the job.”
“I thought I told you to hitch a ride home, kid,” He snapped. “There’s no sense in seeing Cas like that if you don’t have to.”
And the thing about fear was that Dean had a history with it. He knew where it started— deep in his chest, hot in his throat, and he knew where it ended— people leaving, people hurting, people dying. It ended with bodies in graves and bathtubs and hospital beds. It ended bloody and bad, and Dean knew this better than anyone.
Patience opened her eyes slowly, breathing hard, and all the tension in Castiel’s limbs was released back into the bedding. His eyes slipped closed.
that’s not it,” Sam argued, frustrated enough to finally start glaring. “I’m talking about hunting. Ever since we found out Chuck’s been running the show you’ve been different. Angrier. Not just because we were being controlled, but because you knew that if we didn’t defeat Chuck, you would never get a chance at what you’ve always wanted.”
Dean heaved a sigh, but his eyes were pinched in amusement, cheeks a light shade of pink as he stepped closer. The closest he’d ever gotten to Cas really, hand rising to the side of his neck as he carefully slid the razor across Cas’s jawline.
The two collided in the darkness, a spray of glass and blood that blew into the night and sent Castiel sliding across pavement, crying out in pain.
“Oh, yes, well,” Cas blew through a laugh, awkward as usual, dry with the delivery, but fuck if it didn’t make Dean smile. “I uh, I think it would be quite handy if I had a... lover to cut it for me.” Cas explained thoughtfully, head tilting to the side like a puppy, giving Dean a look that asked
Dean looked down at the pale blur of his own hand in the darkness. Remembered how it had felt to reach for Cas for what he thought would be one last time, fingers curling into the thick of his sleeve with a ragged gasp as Cas cupped his face.
“Cas?” His hands grappled through darkness, reaching for anything, desperate to touch. “Cas! Hey— talk to me, look at me,” Dean found the bulk of a shoulder, the heavy rise and fall of a thrashing heart. His hands slid up to Castiel’s face, fingers slipping through hair, palms scratching over stubble and warm skin. Dean faltered when he felt tears brush his thumbs, and his next words came out mangled and soft. “Just look at me, please— I’m sorry. Cas, I’m sorry.”
A match was tossed into the mix, a roar of fire that made them both startle back, and the two of them watched as the spell flickered and sparked before dying out in a flare of purple and red.
There was a moment, brief and concealed, where Sam seemed to consider Dean’s words. A quiet sort of awe passed through his eyes, the barest hint of a smile making the apples of his cheeks rise. All of it was gone far too soon.
Dean got out of the car with his expression wiped clean, gaze steady even when his heartbeat said otherwise. He was careful as he walked over the light layer of snow that had made its way to the ground over the last few minutes, moving across the Impala to stand by his friend.
“I can’t imagine how,” Cas grimaced, effectively pushing Dean back a peg, his spirits falling once more.
“That’s not happening,” He snapped, and this time there’s no smile that accompanied him. There was nothing but Dean and the shake in his voice when he said, “I’ll tell him everything myself before I let him stay fucking brain dead, got it?”
“Sammy,” He said, and his brother’s eyes flocked to him without a second thought. “When you and Eileen finally tie the knot one of these days, don’t forget to let me and Cas wave you two off, alright?”
Either way, the look on Cas’s face still made Dean fall forward with laughter, their foreheads brushing tentatively.
Cas couldn’t remember a day that stuck out to Dean like a floodlight, bearing down on him every now and then to remind him how it had felt getting Cas back and embracing him outside that church. Almost like his soul had been shoved back into his body, the very thing that kept him going, made living bearable.
And habit had Dean readying himself for rejection, shoulders tensing beneath his dampened jacket, cheeks cold and pink. He was ready for Cas to slip again, for his smile to melt without warning and his mood to turn brittle and evasive, not wanting to be touched. But all Castiel did was make this sound at the top of his throat, a contented little noise that shot straight through Dean’s spine.
“It adds up, Dean,” Sam almost looked scared of Dean at that moment, staggering around him with an outstretched hand as if that would somehow soften the incoming blow. “The buried memories, the demon at the hospital. Cas could still see his true face, just like Anna,” Sam swallowed. “Cas chose to fall, to become human. He knew the consequences—”
“Being able to see your soul,” Castiel answered easily, squinting even harder when Dean let out a breath of relief. “I thought your feelings for me might run deeper because everytime you looked at me, your soul became brighter. Different then when you looked at Sam.”
“I met one of the angels who fell. She seemed like she needed guidance and I… I wanted to help her— I
Patience breathed in, the rise of her shoulders moving with Dean’s hand. “Ready,” She smiled. Then, a little unsure, she took a seat at the edge of Cas’s bed and said, “You might want to step out for this.”
“Moving on? What part of the last few months has looked like moving on to you?” Sam demanded, voice cracking with disbelief, his heart sinking all the more. “We couldn’t move on, Jack. Not even a little. Not with Cas gone and— and then
He’d make two cups of coffee without a word and carry it to Dean with focused eyes and a wobbly stature that nearly had Dean going, “thanks, sweetheart” every time he took the mug from his hands.
Dean was half way through a smile of his own when he felt the car teeter beneath him, the passenger door squeaking harshly as Cas collapsed into it with a grunt of pain.
Castiel looked down at his pants, pinching them between two fingers. “I think they’re cute, and I’m sure the old me shared the same sentiment.”
Dean straightened as if caught, his arms stilling for the briefest moment before regaining their speed. Up down, up down— pain ease, pain ease. The point wasn't to make it hurt. The point was to feel the ache just enough to make Cas’s distance feel like a thumb prick in comparison; to make everything else seem irrelevant. But Dean had let his mind wander, and his mouth run, and Cas had managed to find his way back to Dean just like he always did.
“I should be punching you right now, you know,” Claire mumbled, unable to speak any louder without the shake in her voice getting noticed, and Dean nodded. He knew.
Cas accepted the wallet gingerly, shifting it between both hands. He frowned, head tilting when he caught sight of the picture tucked in right beside one of Sam as a kid, both of them pinned over a picture of Mary that had been folded and refolded more times than Dean could count.
“Not a chance. You see, at first I figured I’d wait him out. See if he was strong enough to take me on, but if you two are here— well,” The demon shrugged, face twisting up in this humiliating mix of jest and pity. He clicked his tongue, pressing the gun harder into Cas’s skin. “Castiel must be in a bunch. Cat got your wings, angel?”
Dean grabbed a vicious hold of his wrist, head dropping to his arm, and he willed his soul not to shake apart.
cereal boxes, pulling Cas’s attention back to him. “Does this look like handling it to you? What’s with the cereal?”
Dean jerked up at the sound of Sam’s voice, eyes wide and guilt ridden. As discreetly as possible, Dean wrenched his arm back behind him, hiding the spoonful of peanut butter he’d been feeding to the vibrating Miracle at his feet.
He sniffled into his brother’s shoulder, eyes wet and unfocused at a spot across the room. His voice trembled when he dared to force it awake, “I can’t accept that.”
The angel blinked at him, blue eyes wide and blank in that stupidly oblivious way of his that made Dean irritated faster than anything else. It was like pulling teeth trying to get Castiel to understand human etiquette, common sense- even now, years after the Apocalypse. But that look on Cas’s face, that mixture of confusion and twinkling innocence often thrown in with a soft head tilt always made Dean a little helpless too.
Cas didn’t need much guidance. Dean barely even had a grip on him before Cas was letting himself get pulled in by the arm, eyes trained on Miracle like he was seeing some sort of illusion. Castiel had never gotten the chance to interact with a dog. Dean was certain of it, and it was clear now just how much they intrigued Cas, every sweep of Miracle’s tail making Cas’s eyes melt even further.
” She was angry, that much Dean could tell, but the way her voice broke apart at the end was harsher than any scream. His fingers tightened around the wheel, mouth hanging open— “
“What are you boys chasing?” He asked slowly, finger tracing over his holster in a way that had Dean eyeing him silently.
“What about you?” Castiel nodded, pushing over a tower of red chips and watching them scatter. “You never answered what—”
Dean leveled Sam with a heavy look, ready to lay it on thick, but getting asked that after days of being B listed by the very person he wanted to be around more than anything hit him unexpectedly hard. This time, it wasn’t something he could just take in stride. Emotion choked him fast and quick, the layered ache in Dean’s bones tightening up just at the sight of Sam’s worried gaze.
He stepped forward and pulled out a ratty old bandana before he could talk himself out of it, leaning far enough into Castiel’s space to have the other looking up at him, gaze heavy as Dean took his arm.
“He did. We hurt each other,” Sam smiled, sad and careful, every word coming out bruised and sunken with hurt. “He didn’t mean to, and we— we didn’t mean to, but, sometimes that doesn’t matter. Sometimes bad things just happen.”
Dean walked back over to Castiel with as much supplies as he could carry. He dumped it all across the bed carelessly and acted surprised when the bottle of whiskey spilled over with a loud sloshing noise, the nozzle bumping against Castiel’s thigh.
“Dean,” Sam said, and it wasn’t a plea. It wasn’t useless begging. It was a quiet understanding, an acceptance that this would take time, and for a paralyzing moment, Dean couldn’t breathe. “If you ever need anything, you know that I’m—”
Standing there, half-naked and swaying on his feet as he waited for the coffee machine to boil, was Cas. He was resting his head against the overhead cabinets, still blinking sleep from his eyes and rolling his shoulders.
“You think I don’t know that?” It’s a visceral response somewhere deep in his system, sharp in his head. Anger struck him first and his voice raised to a violent degree, “You think I haven’t wrapped my head around the storm of shit we’ve found ourselves in?”
He’d been doing that more and more lately, gradually, like he wasn’t sure he was allowed, still so used to having an open wound on his face that would stretch and tear if he let the slightest inch of happiness slip through. But as Castiel’s face healed, it seemed that the rest of him followed, something human and tangible starting to pour out of him in the places where he’d once been unreachable, drawn tight within his own body, and it was when he laughed that Dean reveled in it the most; hoped and believed that maybe he could actually live like this.
Cas gave the tiniest smile at that, just the impression of it tapping at the corners of his mouth before it was gone, leaving with the briefest wince.
“Hold on,” Dean told Cas, barely giving the other a glance before making his way to the back of the car to unlock the trunk. He was rifling through his duffel bag when Cas came around to stand next to him, head tilted to the side.
She slipped the money into her blouse, beaming gratefully, and Dean rushed out of the diner with a smile of his own. He wanted this over with. He needed this ghoul dead and to be tearing pavement back to Kansas by yesterday. Dean climbed into the Impala without even trying to spare the seats from the rain, slamming the door shut behind him.
but Dean Winchester, for the life of him, still couldn’t tell the difference between being left and being abandoned.
He wanted the messy Cas. The grouchy Cas. The Cas who grumbled as he drove and scolded Dean without hesitation. The Cas who had bled and burned and ached just to keep Dean safe for all these years, and had become so beautifully human because of it. Dean had never wanted anything more or different or better than Cas— just Cas was more than enough, it was everything.
Castiel stared up at the sky boldly, unblinking even when the snowflakes reached the skin of his face, touching down on tanned wrinkles and dark stubble. The blue of his eyes was brighter than Dean had ever seen, different from how it looked powered with grace, ripped apart with light. This blue was all emotion. No pain, no anger, the color framed with long lashes sprinkled with ice.
This was all Dean wanted. This was all he had ever wanted, Cas beside him in the passenger seat, content with simply being with Dean without the fate of the world forcing them together. Laughing, smiling, being so unapologetically human.
Small specs of white stood out against his dark hair like stars, his touch consuming and eyes electric when they noticed Dean’s stare, met it willingly.
“Was it?” Castiel asked, endearingly interested, blue eyes softened and mid-day sweet, worn down at the corners.
“What?” Dean asked sharply, suddenly all too willing to look Sam straight in the eye. “What are you—” He let out a scoff, licking his lips. “You’re not seriously thinking about us taking on a case right now.”
Agonizing in every nerve, every shredded inch as he ripped himself apart just to come out the other side alive and breathing. Not swimming, not drowning in a sea of black but really, truly, breathing. He inhaled once, choked and desperate, and felt the air around him bend in motion, rippling as if pushed.
Dean glared at Sam as he lifted the weight back onto the rack, effortless as anything. “What’s the point in me even standing here if you’re just gonna lift these things like they’re cotton swabs?”
“You can be quite over enthusiastic about certain things,” Castiel mumbled through a mouthful, looking up at Dean to find the man staring incredulously. Cas stifled a smile. “I was almost certain pie was one of them.”
He stopped and he thought about Claire back at the bunker waiting for him, and Kaia in Sioux Falls waiting for her.
“Baby’s first burp! Well—” Dean twisted his head to the side, mouth pulled into a sideways grin that seemed to draw Cas’s eye. “This day just keeps gettin’ better.”
“Is there something wrong?” Castiel asked. He must have seen the way Dean’s mouth twitched in response, because he quickly added, “other than the obvious I mean.”
Gentle and warm, doe eyed and sweet. Decidedly human enough for Dean, but just a little more badass. Perfect.
that had hope brewing in even the lowest places, Sam’s heart pounding against the swell in his throat— because this was
Dean didn’t stop, but his footsteps got heavier, arms dragging behind him as he marched down the small flight of stairs into the war room.
He stirred when he felt a presence by his feet, his instinct being to kick blindly, but his body sank with relief once he looked down. One by one, Eileen made careful work of unlacing Dean’s muddy boots and sliding them off his feet. She gathered them up without a word and walked over to the kitchenette, placing them on the counter.
He listened for that familiar hum in the air. The same prickle in his skin that appeared every time Cas would fly in out of nowhere, filling the room with static and a flutter of wings.
“Dean—” Sam rushed towards him in a panic, throwing an arm out to catch Dean by the shoulder, but the effort didn’t matter. Once he was standing in front of Jack with his jaw set and his eyes alight, Dean stopped all on his own.
He sounded genuine, terribly kind in that way he’d always been able to, and Dean felt something inside of him deflate. His hand tightened around the phone, a painful sort of terror making his fingers curl.
“There’s more. There’s so much more, but— everything else is distorted. Blackened around the edges like my mind doesn’t want itself to see,” Castiel said.
Dean felt a patter in his chest, a distant roar that rolled in his blood. Human. It was all so easy to see now, to pinpoint without feeling guilty of having false hope. The flush in Cas’s cheeks, the bashful flicker of his eyes and wobble of his lips, finger’s folding into his palms.
“No, no you don’t. You said it yourself, you’ve been different. Not just on this last hunt, not with what’s been going on with Cas, but this entire year.”
” Dean snapped at him, finally getting the boy to raise his eyes long enough to fix him with an ugly glare, jaw set hard. “Anybody ever told you it’s rude to stare?”
some idiotic plan that gets you killed instead of me, I will throw this fucking bowl in your face,” He growled, pinching the damned thing between two fingers and slamming it down onto the table. Cas didn’t even react to the milk that spilled out over his wrist. His eyes never left Dean’s. “No suicide missions, no demon deals. We find a safe solution, or there is no solution.
“I can’t,” Jack spun around to face Dean, serving him this crushing look that had Dean struggling to breathe. “Chuck was never meant to be able to enter the Empty. That’s what was written, that was the truth. But he rewrote the rules, he— he changed the story to
“Or a kid that’s been given too much responsibility,” She countered, and Dean hadn’t noticed it before, but when he turned to finally look at her, it was sadness that registered first, glaring off of her in shimmering waves.
For what it’s worth, Sam did his best to act normal when he saw Dean finally make his way out of his bedroom for the first time in two days.
Jack had already taken care of Dean’s concussion just before vanishing, relieving the throbbing ache at the base of Dean’s skull with a sweep of his hand, but Cas couldn’t know that. Which meant Dean was going to have to lie and
Cas had been fighting this for months now. Standing in the quiet, squinting through the hazy, and now there were pieces. There wasn’t a map, or a picture to copy, but there were fragments of before splayed out in front of him, waiting to be picked.
“Drink,” Dean pressed the whiskey bottle back into Cas’s hand, ignoring the other man’s frown as he crouched down at the side of the bed. “You’re gonna need it. Your feet are fucked.”
Castiel plucked the towel between two fingers and snatched it quickly, wringing his hands. He gave Dean a small smile, this fleeting little thing that was the kind of pretty that made Dean blink stupidly in response, unable to give anything but a nod in return before Cas was turning and walking out of the room.
“You’ve got no idea the kind of shit your boy here is in,” Lundy’s grip on Castiel tightened, fingers curling just enough around his windpipe to have Cas clawing weakly at his wrist. “Escaping the Empty? Returning to Earth not once, but twice? Now, that’s somethin’ that don’t just happen every Sunday,” He nodded at Castiel smugly. “Every demon and angel in the country has got their eyes peeled for this one. Hoping to make things right.”
“Dude, they’re good,” Sam insisted, tonguing the straw of his smoothie back into his mouth in a way that made Dean start to fake gag. Sam groaned, “Jesus— you’re in your fucking forties, Dean.”
“There’s something you’re not telling me,” He said thinly, trying not to sound as hurt as he felt, but then it occurred to him, slowly, draining into his stomach. Dean stared at him. “You know what it is, don't you? What’s wrong with you.”
Dean forced the thought away, sobering up immediately at Cas’s words. He started the trek to his room, pushing past his door stoically to grab for the duffle under his bed.
but then he’d remember a stirring behind his stomach and a stone in his throat that had been there for much longer, rising and rising with every look and touch and whispered, “
Sam gave him a crumbled look, eyes soft and worried. He looked sad, Dean realized, and he quickly straightened up, clearing his throat to try and get the air back in his lungs.
Cas had rewritten everything, jumbled all the pieces, and in the process left Dean behind with nothing.
“Oh,” Cas said, softer than anything, and Dean couldn’t pinpoint it exactly, but the expression on his face was a provoking one.
“Sammy?” Dean called out to him, panic clear in his voice. He didn’t breathe until he saw Sam finally sit up with a thundering groan, the angle of his shoulder mangled and wrong, the bone veering dangerously to the left. Dean sucked in a breath, “Sam—”
Sam was hugging him before he could pull away, loose and casual, trying not to make a big deal out of it, but Dean didn’t miss the severity behind it. They never hugged unless a Winchester death was waiting around the corner. That’s just the way it was, the way it had always been.
He knew it was the beginning, his surroundings unfamiliar, and yet he was aware that something was different. He was aware that this was Earth, and he was human, and that that, in itself, was a miracle.
It meant Dean finally admitting that he needed more than just Sam to be content now, and there had never been (or ever would be) anything more terrifying.
“What was that all about?” He gestured back to where Eileen had just disappeared, and sat on the bed across from Dean. His hair was still wet, sticking to the sides of his face like a dog.
It’s not— I can’t even—” He looked towards the mirror and lost his voice, the corners of his mouth dipping. Cas tried to recover quickly, shaking his head through a wave of emotion, but he sounded anything but casual as he said, “I’ve lost all feeling in the left side of my face.”
Cas’s smile was gone now, and his eyes were closed, everything in him softened and powered down. The air around him was still, and the truth pierced like a sword. Dean reached out and touched him, cupping his face for what felt to be the last time. Dean's fingers met scar tissue.
Dean didn’t know what he’d do if he ever saw Jack again. He didn’t know what emotion would win over the others.
“Good, now,” Dean moved to help him off the bed. “How about you let Eileen take a quick look at you. Make sure you’re not gonna keel over.”
“It’s raining pretty bad here. Possible tornado rolling in from the East,” He looked out the diner’s front window distractedly, wincing at the storm clouds gathering overhead. Over the line, Castiel inhaled sharply, fear curling in his ribs, and Dean rushed to say, “Hey— we’re fine though, really. It’s just putting us a little behind schedule. Even ghoul’s don’t wanna risk goin’ full
“Cut out?” Sam asked, and Dean could imagine he’d sound just as incredulous if he was able to get his breath back fast enough to speak. Sam turned to Dean. “What, like Anna?”
“Are you trying to divert my attention from you?” Cas asked blankly, so serious it was downright painful, Dean’s stomach aching with amusement that went straight to the skin around his eyes.
Chief Lundy turned Castiel to face him, palm clamped around his jaw, teeth scraping as he grinned. His eyes flashed black and the race in Dean’s eardrums grew faster, a headless stampede that made him reach for the demon knife tucked into his inside pocket.
Dean gently closed the door behind them, and just like every night, his chest tightened the moment they were alone.
“What do you want with Cas?” Sam asked impatiently, glaring as he stood up with a hand cupping his arm, teeth gritted.
and Dean still didn’t get to have the person he wanted. He still didn’t get to have the same things Sam had; and it was childish and wrong and Dean hated it more than anything— wanted to scream at himself that he was being selfish again, he was being the man Cas told him he wasn’t— but what he felt was anger.
Castiel's eyes softened with understanding, frown deepening. “I’ve never been a regular angel, Dean. But especially not since I met you.”
He let go of Cas's hand to take a tuft of his dark hair between two fingers, watching the strands curl around his skin when the wind took control again.
Dean felt a familiar tug in his heart the moment he realized he was staring, and he cleared his throat absentmindedly, face flushing despite the cold.
Dean figured out pretty quickly that Cas was probably finding these questions online somewhere, every one of them cheesy enough to make Dean’s eyes roll back, but something about them made him feel warm too. These types of questions, the silly ones, the
“Uncalled for my ass,” Dean huffed, circling his way around the car. “That guy was giving you the fucking stink eye, and for what? Because you're hurt? If he wasn’t some kid I would’ve clocked him in the fucking—”
Sam bristled in his seat. “Dude, this isn’t Fight Club. The three of us can talk about it, I just think with Cas we really shouldn’t—”
And Dean just looked at him, and looked at him, half a second away from a heart attack with his brain fried and his soul rocket launched into outer space. He couldn’t even fucking breathe, too shocked to form a single thought, but when it registered it
Yes, he’d heard his prayers. Of course he had. “Metatron— he—” There was a weariness in his tone that set Dean in unease, stomach tensing. “He took my grace.”
It was instinct. It was survival. That’s the way it had been for years, and Dean still had to remind himself it didn’t have to be that way anymore.
Dean raised his head from Eileen’s shoulder, squinting at Sam through one eye. “I don’t get a shower?”
“You did fine, kiddo. Really,” He said. “There’s nothing to apologize for. Now finish your ice cream before it melts.”
Without another word, Patience joined the others. But it wasn’t until Jack’s eyes turned a crimson gold that Dean himself drew any closer, his heart nothing but a ceaseless drum as Jack pressed a hand to Castiel’s chest and drew in a labored breath, power pooling in the coat of his eyes.
I'm officially balancing work and college at the moment, so just like this chapter, the last update might take a little longer. I put every free moment I have into writing this fic so please be patient with me, and tell me what you think so far! The next chapter will be the final showdown in the Empty, which I'm super excited for, so do please come and scream at me in the comments!
And it’s sick, and it’s horrible, and it’s been nearly fifteen years, Dean should be past the pain of it, but it’s in that moment that he thought about John. His grief hollowed face staring back at Dean over a dog— a dog he would’ve hated, would’ve thrown out onto the side of the road the second he caught sight of it— rather than the puppy eyes of his brother, and Dean could feel himself flare up with anxiety, straighten as if called to attention by a commander, not a father.
“Then what are you, Jack?” Dean took a daring step forward. “Because the last time I checked, you sure left us like God.”
There was snow trapped between his toes, slicing through his skin, but it was the sudden appearance of lights from a distance that drew Castiel’s attention. He stopped in the middle of the road and turned, facing straight ahead at what looked like sunlight, felt like fear.
“I want to remember, Dean. You have no idea how badly— because it’s important, I know it’s important— I can feel it. I keep seeing these moments, brief glimpses. One minute I feel like I’m standing alone on the side of a road in the middle of nowhere, and the next I’m sitting on a park bench. Or in an empty bar, or the backseat of the—
” Cas asked, helplessly interested, and Dean couldn’t get over just how shy he sounded, as if calling Dean had taken the kind of courage to make him breathless.
“There’s nothing wrong with being afraid of having something,” Cas said gently. “It’s usually not the having that people fear, but the losing. For some it’s not worth it to even try.”
It took a great deal of effort for Dean to reach forward and start the car with a turn of his hand, the machine rattling to life around them.
Dean padded into the kitchen, looking to find Sam, and he nearly collided with the doorway as a result, hands reaching out to steady himself against the frame.
The corner of Dean’s mouth twitched upward, chasing that sudden light he felt flood around his eyes.
know. Dean had figured out two days ago where he wanted to be, and it wasn’t chasing some nightmare in the-middle-of-nowhere Texas.
Dean wanted a lot even when he asked for nothing, and if he tried hard enough, accepting the pain that came with it, Dean could even imagine that he and Cas were together. That they were happy and content and bickering in the middle of a grocery store over what to make for dinner, and that was it. That was their lives.
“I— I didn’t—” He gulped hard and looked back over at Cas unintentionally, eyes delving right for the mesh of battered skin on the left side of Castiel’s face.
“You’re wrong,” Castiel whispered, and Dean swore he could hear the stretch of a smile in his voice. “You have been the only thing that’s made me feel alive in the months I’ve been in pain. In the only months I can even remember.”
It’s all he managed to get out, and even that came out garbled to hell, the emotion in it strong enough to make Dean stagger back just at the sound of it, eyes blinking rapidly.
Dean didn’t know how many hours he spent sitting there, hunched over the bunker’s tables with his back in knots and computer screens sprouting dots of color in his vision.
“With Cas,” Sam persisted. “You’ve told me almost nothing about what happened with you two when Billie cornered you. All I know is that—”
“It’s kind of like a kid playing dress up ain’t it?” Dean asked, watching through vacant eyes as Eileen rushed to Cas as well, her hand finding its way to Sam’s lower back.
Sam raised his eyebrows wordlessly, unconvinced. “Clearly,” At Dean’s wrathful expression, Sam rolled his eyes and said, “Look, I know you don’t want to talk about it—”
Because Dean’s always wondered this himself, and he could never seem to grapple with time long enough to get an answer. It all just blurred together, in the worst way, in the
It wasn’t that Sam didn’t fear failure. He simply just refused it. While Dean evaded and broke ranks just to avoid slipping up, a habit undoubtedly brought on by John, Sam soared beneath the dawn of his mistakes. He’d risen above the impossible, surged back from the claws of demon blood and the tailing of Lucifer, redeeming himself from the seemingly unredeemable, and unlike Dean, Sam wasn’t above asking others for help.
“Yeah, I know,” Sam scoffed, rolling his eyes. He brushed past Dean to step up to the woman at the front desk, nose pinched between his thumb and forefinger as he smiled grimly. “Hi, do you happen to have—”
“I wouldn’t know. We’re not supposed to talk about it, remember?” He threw Sam a pointed look from over his shoulder, the entire left side of his face glowing as he peered inside the fridge.
The ghost of Lundy’s fingers were already embedded into the whitened skin of Cas’s throat, and the freedom of air was brief, rupturing into something much darker when the demon took Cas by the chin and turned his head to face him.
Sam staggered back as Dean passed through the door in one forceful push, turning the handle at the same time his shoulder powered him into the doorway. It was a loud entrance, Dean’s desperation clear as day, but Dean found that he didn’t care all that much once he was standing still and meeting eyes with Cas from across the room.
“I don’t recall a code,” He said petulantly, and suddenly, without warning, Dean felt a slow grin curl up the sides of his face. He nudged Cas with his knee, affectionate.
Castiel didn’t respond. He read it, his message bubble appearing and disappearing enough times to make Dean feel sick to his fucking stomach, but nothing ever came. Dean drew in a tight breath, fighting equal parts worry and humiliation. Did this count as being desperate? This felt like it counted as being desperate.
” Sam froze where he stood, hands hovering around the rim of the bowl. His pulse rose steady to the back of his throat. And then, softer than anything, Rowena said, “
“Look, Dean, I don’t know much about angels, but I do feel energies, and when I looked inside of him—” Patience leveled Castiel with a heavy look, eyes tracking over his sleeping figure. “His insides are charred. His soul is shredded,” Her face softened. “I’m sorry.”
“Eileen?” He rasped, and there was a pain in his chest that just kept building, an emotion that churned and boiled at his very center.
“Your alcohol tolerance is exceptional. It shouldn’t be difficult for you to—” Cas stopped when he saw the look on Dean’s face, lips parting with slow understanding. He shifted nervously. “Oh. Right. I won’t insist if it makes you uncomfortable.”
Okay, so a little too normal for Dean’s standards, but it had been three days since he’d heard Cas’s voice and he was grateful for anything, so long as they weren’t talking about the miles between them and the missing years dangling over both of their heads.
” Sam said, making a face as he balled up his bloody tissue and stuffed it away. “It could just be any other angel out there.”
Dean raised his fork high in the air like he planned to stab Sam, and Sam stumbled out of his chair as if his ass was on fire, wood scraping against wood in a tipping avalanche that had Sam cutting off his own laughter just to slap two hands over his ears, hair flopping every which way.
” She sighed back, effortless and serene as if she was merely fiddling with her nails. Over the line, Sam heard her close a book with heavy finality, the image of orange hair and golden dust flashing in his mind as she said, “
Dean watched him wordlessly, lips parting in awe at Cas's expression. It wasn’t everyday that Dean, now almost thirty-four years old, got to witness someone experience something as mundane as snow for the first time. And as someone who already struggled with keeping their eyes off of Cas, this was just downright humiliating, but Dean was almost at the point of not caring anymore.
“Does it bother you that she’s…” Dean could hardly recognize his own voice with the ringing in his ears, blood suddenly running thick and hot through the pulse in his neck. “That she’s gay?”
Dean wondered if they should be talking about it. How weird things had become ever since Dean patched Cas up and yelled at him for simply doing what Sam had told him to do. They had barely even talked, only exchanging brief glances in the hallways at times when Cas didn't get to the bathroom fast enough to avoid them.
The light vanished, soaking back into his skin, and Jack leaned into Sam gratefully, the pain on his face never wavering. Castiel didn’t move; Dean had to ask anyway.
“I don’t know,” Dean muttered. “Fuck, I don’t know. I’m— I don’t know what I’m saying. You, uh, you should get back to Eileen.”
“Is he getting any better? I mean, memory-wise?” Sam asked, trying to sound like he wasn’t peering over at Dean anxiously, still in the middle of chewing on a burnt piece of toast that he hadn’t even let Dean put butter on for fucks sake.
Dean faltered where he stood, his smile dropping fast and sudden enough for even Cas to notice. Dean awkwardly set his bag down on the map table, and Sam brushed past both of them to get to Eileen, the two of them letting out a simultaneous breath of relief as they embraced in the library archway.
and it’s… it’s something I’ll never understand. But I think it’s safe to say our life expectancy has gone up, man. At least for the time being, and the last thing I want is something like a cracked liver getting the jump on Dean Winchester.”
“I’ve always thought I had the ability to feel the way human’s felt, but now I realize that was far from the truth. Everything is so much more. Brighter, grander, but… it’s sadder too, overwhelming in a way I hadn’t been able to understand before. Even the good it’s—” His eyes lingered on Dean for a beat too long, wavering as he glanced away. “It’s all so much to handle.”
“Ah ha! I knew I packed it,” Dean grinned. He closed the trunk and turned to Cas expectantly, the simple white cloth folded in his hands. He waited a beat, struck with a wave of sudden shyness that he forced away by throwing the scarf around Cas’s neck. “Here, man. This’ll keep you warm.”
There was just something about having to drag a drunken father into bed at that age that made you unforgiving.
The sky melted around him, gentle flurries of snow dancing across Dean’s shoulders and down his cheeks. He didn't want to get back in the car without Cas there, but Dean never had it in him to ask the angel to endure road trips when they both knew Cas could just fly. Still though, similar to tonight where Cas had appeared beside Dean without warning, sometimes Dean didn’t have to ask. Cas just went with him anyway, somehow always aware of when Dean was alone and wishing for company.
“Nothing happened, man. I’m sorry to say we rolled snake eyes on this one, but we’ve still got time. I don’t want you worrying about it, alright?” It’s sad just how easy it really is. The words run smooth and Cas’s eyes soften instantly, his concern ebbing away at the certainty in Dean’s voice.
Dean would never be sure whether he imagined it or not. His heart was beating too fast for coherent thought and his vision was swimming, but at the edge of his mind, barely, he could have sworn he felt Cas’s hand tighten, his fingers curling in a desperate attempt to make sure Dean stayed.
When Castiel finally turned to face Dean fully, his hands were already on a spiral, fumbling frantically with the buttons of his flannel. His brow was drawn down with concentration, bottom lip trapped between his teeth, but all of it was pointless with Cas’s hands shaking the way they were, and Dean all but ripped himself out of a standstill.
“He’s in Colorado dealing with some angel crap. I gotta go get him before he gets himself killed, so,” Dean lifted his duffel bag as explanation, shrugging. “You good staying here by yourself?”
Dean raised his head with softened eyes, instinct having him poised and worried even before Eileen could get her words out.
Castiel jerked away almost violently. “You think I don’t know that?” His eyes were frantic in their move to take Dean in, staggering without direction. They stilled and lingered desperately at Dean’s hands. “You care more than anyone I’ve ever met, Dean. And I know that doesn’t mean much, given who I am, but it’s true. You’re—”
Dean didn't let himself think about what that meant, what Jody was implying. He breathed in tight and slow, steadying.
“I don’t know what you expect him to do. I mean, you said it yourself, Cas was taken by the Empty. A place we happen to know nothing about, and a place Jack can’t even enter.”
“Here,” Sam reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a bandana. “Let me get a look at your head.”
The first thing Cas did was reach for the ketchup bottle at the end of the table, the same thing he’d seen Dean do probably a million times at god only knows how many diners. He even ate the same way Dean did; obnoxious and open mouthed, cheeks puffed in a way that had Dean choking on an onion ring and reaching for his coffee.
“I’m not leaving you,” Is what inevitably came out, the only truth he’d ever known, the only good thing Dean had ever been taught, because without that there was nothing.
“Call me if you need anything.” He said, attempting to pull the blankets back over Sam who slapped his hands away.
He heard more than he saw it clink gently with Cas’s own drink. Dean raised his eyes to him, somehow already knowing, feeling it like a grip to the throat— but his breath still faltered when he found Cas staring at him, watching Dean move and smile and live like it was all he’d been built for, and Dean’s heart still knew nothing of reason.
them living. If Dean looked close enough, he could still see the distant stains of blood he’d never been able to fully wipe from the metal. He could still feel the odd split in the woven cording where a shifter had ripped the necklace clean off of him in its struggle to aim for Dean’s throat.
“I love you more than anything,” Castiel sighed, almost like it was a drag, the biggest nuisance in the world, but his eyes said differently. Dean knew differently. “Does that suffice?”
It had been a while since Dean had balanced so close to honesty. It was dreadful and refreshing all in the same breath, and Dean didn’t know how to manage.
“You like nuts in your pie?” Castiel asked slowly, painfully innocent, and too many things had happened at once— Dean could barely keep up with it all.
He wondered if Cas could feel the difference in that smile the way Dean could see it. Like night and day, angel and human. This was
He didn’t know if he could do this without Sam. He’d never even tried to. All Dean knew was that it felt like Sam was trying to leave him all over again, and someone should be screaming, Dean thought. Someone should be breaking shit or throwing punches, but maybe things really
“Get in the car,” Castiel laughed, and this was a rarity even before, a breathy rasp of joy that Dean never got to hear enough, but now it was like blinking through a sudden breach of wind, staring into the warmth of the sun.
Most people would think Dean would have gotten used to this overtime; Cas’s general lack of understanding when it came to giving Dean his personal space, but that was just it. It only seemed to happen with Dean.
And there’s no time to unravel the full weight of it. There’s no time for Dean to realize he practically served his feelings on a silver platter and batted it straight home. The look Sam gave him was downright miserable, breaking something in Dean that made him feel seconds away from collapsing, and he finally picked at the wound he’d been holding towards his chest since the moment Cas died.
They all turned to look at him, their lips sealed but their eyes burdened, and Dean rushed to move past it.
The bite in his voice echoed sharply in the walls of the garage. Cas didn’t flinch, but Dean thought he saw something crack in his features, guilt slithering in. Dean tried not to think about just how familiar that expression looked on him.
“It’s been weeks, Dean. What the hell do you think I’ve been doing?” Sam demanded, pained that Dean thought so little of him, frustrated that after everything, Dean didn’t see that he was trying to get his best friend back too. “While you were hiding out in your room, drinking yourself away— don’t you think I want Cas back as much as you do?”
The woman gave Dean an odd look, unconvinced, but she nodded anyway. “Mmh, alright then,” She shrugged, and Dean watched as she disappeared back into the kitchen with a swing of her hips, whistling as she went.
“That’s a load of crap,” Dean gritted. “You can’t sit here and tell me Jack doesn’t know Cas is back. He would’ve felt it. He might have even been the one to do it, who knows!”
Dean almost commented on it. Torn between insulting him or teasing him or mentioning how Sam looked younger in that moment than he had in years. But his mouth never opened, and suddenly Dean was thrown back in time.
“I don’t know what to tell you, Dean,” Patience withered, looking sympathetic. “You said he was in a place called the Empty?” Dean could barely find the strength to nod, and her next words ran a course down his spine. “Maybe this, forgetting... was better than any alternative.”
“These are good.” Castiel said after a while of silence, the two of them eating quietly with their eyes ahead.
Dean heard more than he saw Eileen rise up on her toes and kiss Sam’s cheek. Sam melted into her gratefully, his free hand cupping the back of her elbow to hold her there for a moment longer, and Dean looked up at the ceiling, his mind bursting with colors.
“There’s something wrong with him,” Dean said, only now realizing how breathless he was. “I mean he… his head is fried. His memories are screwed to hell,” Dean glanced towards the door again, drifting where he stood. His head wouldn’t stop pounding. “He doesn’t remember me, Sammy.”
“Cas,” He gasped out, choking on nothing, and the silence finally fell around him. Dean opened his eyes, fear freezing in his lungs. “Cas?”
Slowly, Dean circled his arms around Castiel’s waist, pressing his forehead to the back of his hair, and he felt Cas shutter around him. There was a heartbeat pounding away against Dean’s palm, right at the center of Cas’s abdomen, and when Cas reached down to cover Dean’s hand with his own, sliding their fingers together, it was Dean’s turn to flush and burst apart, emotion rendering him useless.
“I thought you said you liked it.” He murmured, staring at the side of Dean’s face while Dean gaped at the two of them in the mirror.
“Oh,” He said, blinking in quick little ripples like a bird flapping its wings, his awareness zeroing in on his own eyes and the color within them. “That’s very kind of you, Dean.”
Dean didn’t even have the chance to ask before Cas was opening the device and showing Dean the tape inside, his finger dragging over the lettering as if he was proud that he’d finally been able to decode something on his own.
There’s a lingering pause, long enough to make Dean bristle with shame for even asking. But Jody spared him soon enough— a punch of what sounded like a breathless laugh crackling through the speaker.
Cas looked confused all while leading Dean inside and pointing out a singular washing machine in the far corner, but he didn’t choose to speak up about it until he saw Dean hurriedly opening up the machine to drag his clothes out.
what he was doing, how crazy this all was and how there wasn’t a chance in the world that Dean would deny him anything.
can’t even leave your bed without getting nauseous. You’re staying, tough guy,” Dean smirked. He grabbed the glass of water he’d set on Sam’s bedside earlier that day, handing it over. “Deal with it.”
Soon enough, dizziness cloaked Dean’s vision, and arguing became more of a hassle than anything. He was asleep within the second hour, and by the sixth he was standing beside a gas pump in Oklahoma while the sun did its best to boil him from a distance, the burn of it at the back of his neck jarring his head with whiteness.
Dean shrugged. “You don’t see me complaining,” His voice faded as he tipped his drink back, draining it with a dramatic gasp. Dean came back smiling from it, the heat outside making his skin shine red, and he slid the empty glass to the far side of the table.
” Rowena purred from the other end, sounding just as displeased as she always had, but there was no mistaking it; Sam could hear the relief in her bright lipped smile. “
Castiel slowly slid off the plastic wrapped seat, his face a blatant mix of pain and embarrassment. His body looked like it was mangled to hell with the way Cas was standing; back hunched over, arms curled into his chest like he’d just been assaulted.
Dean reluctantly tore his eyes away from Sam, forcing strength into his limbs and desire in his bones, the weight lifting with a choked-out grunt. Dean forced the bar up and exhaled, tightening at the elbows and straining at the thighs.
Miracle rose from his spot on the floor, tempted to follow, but with a brief scuffle and a whip of his tail, he was slumping onto the cool kitchen tile again, sprawling out lazily.
“Thank you,” Cas said, the words shaping into a whisper. Cas’s grip on Dean tightened, trembling with sincerity. “For the scarf but— but for everything else too. For coming after me and being with me while I’m… like this. You didn’t have to. You and Sam don’t owe me anything and yet you’re here. Thank you.”
“Yeah, well,” Dean’s smile was mangled. The sound of stretch tape pierced the air as Dean secured the wrappings, making sure to stay clear of his eye and hairline. “You
Dean woke slowly, forced to crawl through a layer of ache and warmth before finally finding the strength to pry his eyes open.
“Tell me what you remember,” Dean interrupted, searching his eyes desperately, wanting to hear how close he was to losing it all.
Instinctively, Dean looked over towards Sam for help, but Sam was already staring back at him with the same rattled eyes, his lips pressed thin. Even Eileen seemed to be at a loss, her eyes moving over Castiel with apprehension.
He didn’t bring it up again, didn’t want to pry if something really was wrong, but when Cas finished making his coffee and walked right back out the door without even looking at Dean, Dean was left picking at the table with a fingernail he no longer had and a pit the size of the Pacific Ocean worming its way into his chest.
"You see that in a movie once, too?" Dean asked dazedly, grinning like a mad man with tears in his eyes, and Cas leaned in once more.
Dean parked the car away from anyone else, not looking to risk some drunk bastard getting so much as a fingerprint on her, and turned at the waist to look at Cas.
Dean couldn’t help it. He knew he was grinning ear to ear. He raised a hand and brushed a finger over Cas’s stubbly cheek like he’d done in Purgatory, eyebrows raising in surprise at how much had grown in just a few days.
“Kaia?” Dean scowled. Claire’s grin only widened, her expression laced with a mischievous glint that instantly made Dean go bug eyed. “I mean, uh, as long as everything’s consensual, you know. I don’t judge.”
Dean’s breathing turned harsh, eyes fogging over with panic. He could feel himself slipping, quicker than usual, hope making everything crumble twice as fast, and it’s an embrace that pulled him back. A brush of stubbly lips against his cheek that made Dean’s eyes rush up out of amazement rather than fear.
“You know,” Dean repeated, disbelief forcing a sharpened smile to pull at the side of his face. “Well, news flash, kid. The phone works both ways! While you were out of commission doing fuck all, we were here.
Dean waited patiently for more; sat there with a hunched back and flitting eyes, needing Cas to give him
He expected Cas to at least ask more questions, but all he did was tap at the picture with his fingernail, expression oddly taken aback.
The trench coat was one of those pieces. And it hurt Dean more than anything to have to tell him the truth.
Dean didn’t really know what he was expecting to see as he pulled up to the only laundromat in Longmont, but finding Cas barreling it out with some old lady just outside the entrance definitely wasn’t something he’d been prepared for.
“Sam, how could you even begin to—” Dean swallowed. Then, softer, infusing more pain than Dean could have ever imagined, he looked at Sam and said, “You got Eileen back, didn’t you?”
"Yes, I believe that would be best." Cas gave a small smile, but when Dean tried to smile back, his mouth pulled into a grimace that left Castiel frowning. Cas pulled his hands back when Dean began to lay down, eyes widening with sudden doubt. "Dean, I-"
Cas stared at Dean owlishly, features flickering between confused and flattered before tightening altogether, a deep rooted blush flooding to his cheeks. It was hard to see with the facial hair blocking the way, but Dean could see it rise up the bridge of Cas’s nose anyway, slithering towards his ears.
He looked like he wanted to say something. Dean thought he could see Cas working through his own head, trying to come up with the right words, but he eventually left the silence as it was and stepped out of Dean’s way to carry on down the hall, footsteps lingering awkwardly.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I had a senior citizen for a little brother. You maybe wanna turn the music up for the people who wanna live a little?”
Dean had still been deciding whether he was going to piss or shave first when he reached the bathroom to find Cas already inside. He’d left the door open a crack, just enough for Dean to be able to peer in and see Cas staring begrudgingly at himself in the mirror, half of his face drenched in so much shaving cream it was beginning to drip off into the sink.
Dean slapped a five dollar bill into Cas’s hand, the sound of it crumbling loud in the quietness. He turned back around to finish folding up Cas’s clothes before the other could respond, missing the way Cas stared down at the money in slight offense, mouth opening in shock.
“Funny,” Sam scoffed. “You must have misplaced that phone number. Again. Cause’ I still don’t have it.”
A few people trailed in behind them, forcing Dean out of the way and closer to Cas, their chests brushing. It should have been scary. It should have been Dean’s knee jerk reaction to move away and apologize, but instead he stayed still and breathed in, head tilting downwards just to watch the way Cas stiffened nervously, gaze dropping to the ground.
He looked gorgeous, hair still ruffled from what Dean imagined to be sleep, and his gut lurched with guilt at the thought that he might’ve woken Cas up for something this stupid.
Castiel pulled the tape back towards himself, brows furrowed. He read the label again, and then once more, lips moving with it, head spinning right along side it, and Dean— much like the first time he’d given Cas his gift, felt ripped apart from his heart entirely, the very thing beating in Cas’s hands as he pulled the cassette free and raised it against the low lamp light.
“We’re just wondering if there was anything found left at the scene. Anything that could explain what those people saw.”
“If you’re scared of my judgement, I can assure you there is none. Not for anyone, but especially not you.”
disappoint you. Not again,” He inhaled slow and heavily. “I’m sorry, Dean. For everything. For so many things, but I couldn’t come back here until I had good news.”
And somehow, they had found their way back. Like some sadistic loop, a torturous curse. Cas was dying because of him,
Cas, the ever living expert on anything Dean Winchester, caught on quickly. His eyes softened at Dean’s tone, eyebrows pinching together in a way that made Dean immediately start reeling himself back in.
“I don’t want to risk, um, how do you humans put it? ‘Killing the mood’?” Cas made quotations with his fingers and everything, the sarcasm in it forcing a smile out of Dean. Adorable. Cas was fucking adorable. “But, I’m very curious why it was now of all times that you decided to pursue me.”
“I apologize for being distrusting, but I believe it’s my nature to be a little suspicious of you all, even now,” Dean didn’t deserve it, but it still seemed like Cas felt guilty for even having to say it. He frowned at Dean. “I’m sorry.”
Only this had nothing to do with Chuck and everything to do with Dean, and it was enough of a change to have Dean opening his mouth before he could even think of another solution.
“A little, but it mostly just feels sensitive,” Cas’s shoulders gave a little jump. “It’s not like I’m having to go over the worst of it. I won’t have to worry about hair growing there anymore.”
It would tell him all about his beginning, and why it felt like this was the thousandth one. It would tell him about the voices, and the pain, and the green eyes of a man who even as a stranger to his mind meant more to Castiel than his own life.
Dean had tried not to notice them before, but with Cas grimacing in pain beside him, it was becoming increasingly difficult.
It didn’t matter because Sam was gone. Sam was missing, Dean didn’t know where he was, and Eileen— where was Eileen? Was she still with Sam or had she gone off on her own?
“She doesn’t need to see him. Not like this,” Dean insisted, and it felt like a losing battle, almost like he was trying to tell his mother what to do, and the thought made him wince, ears flushing with shame.
“I’m pissed at him too, alright,” Sam relented, suddenly poised and flushed in the face, jaw set angrily. “But he’s... Dean, he’s
The world was managing without them, taking its own steps, and Dean didn’t feel guilty for wishing he could have this. Not anymore.
Cas had been staring so long and so earnestly at that one spot on the library table, it only seemed inevitable that he asked, “Who is Jack?”
“It is,” Dean rasped, emotion wrapping itself around his torso, squeezing relentlessly. “And it was my fault then just like it’s my fault now.”
Overall, it was a fairly easy spell to gather. Once the bunker was quiet and Dean had finally gone to bed with his breath reeking of whiskey, Sam had been able to collect the ingredients and recite the Latin without even glancing at Rowena’s spellbook; Sam had nearly memorized it by now, and somehow, he knew Rowena would have preened at the sight of him.
They both climbed their way into the car, Cas much slower than usual, weary of his gauze covered tattoo. It was obvious he was still in a little pain, though Dean figured it probably had something to do with the scrape on his cheekbone and the gash on his arm rather than the tattoo.
“They’ve been torturing it,” He said, heavy as anything, and Dean nearly couldn’t bare it; his world veered sideways, and he threw out his hands to grip the edge of the infirmary bed. “The angels and demons, all of them. That’s why Cas is dying. He’s being ripped apart piece by piece. There’s no way to know what would happen if I used my powers to pull it out. It could explode, it— it could rupture. The power of unobtained grace is unfathomable.”
Showing Cas to his own room in the bunker held a weight to it that Dean hadn’t been expecting, an odd sense of normalcy that made it hard to breathe as him and Cas walked shoulder to shoulder through the hallway.
“Metatron tricked me,” Cas said, regret already making his voice shake. “I’m sorry, Dean. It wasn’t angel trials, it was a spell. I wanted you to know that—”
Cas’s skin flared beneath his hand, warm and dampened soft, blue eyes flocking to Dean’s with purpose.
“It got the jump on me back at the cemetery. You believe that? Old age is gettin’ to be a bitch,” Dean joked, because if he didn’t he thought he might cry instead, and Sam already looked miserable enough as it was.
“I’ll be home as soon as I can,” He said, a promise of his own, and he tried not to imagine a life where saying this to Cas was normal and ‘home’ was something that they shared. “I’ll keep you updated.”
Dean didn’t know how it happened, but Claire ended up being first in line for welcoming hugs, and he was almost knocked back into the map table from the sheer force of her colliding against his chest. Dean groaned on impact, withering against her, but Claire’s arms wounded tight around the back of his neck, forcing him still, and Dean smiled through the sweetened pang in his chest.
“Dean,” Cas said after a stalled moment of nothing, Dean breathing shallowly on the other end. “I’ll be okay. I promise.”
"I've witnessed it, yes. From Heaven when observing the humans but… to feel it," He explained peacefully, his mouth quirking into the beginnings of a rare smile that made Dean want to grin right back. "This is exceptionally pleasing." He remarked, and suddenly he was moving, his body shifting towards Dean naturally.
“I’d never done anything like that before. That man and the… the glass,” Castiel stared dazedly at the bottle in his hand. It took him a few seconds too long to notice Dean had stopped moving entirely, hands growing still at his ankles. Cas looked down at him, voice wavering, “Or have I?”
you,” Cas laughed, drunk off the wonderment of it, the bliss of certainty, all of it rushing in too fast to monitor. “You’re the man with the green eyes. The one I keep seeing, the one I dream about, it’s you—” His smile flattened, gaze dripping, “and you won’t stop crying.”
“What the hell? Are you drunk?” Sam demanded, stepping into Dean’s space to glare through the row of empty bottles at Dean’s back.
“What if there’s not a way this time?” When Dean dared to lift his head, he found Sam’s eyes blurry and red rimmed, just at the edge of something that made Dean’s heart ache. “What if we’ve finally reached our luck, Sam? You know ever since we found out Chuck’s been the one pulling the strings, I just can’t help but think maybe we weren’t even meant to make it this far.”
Dean forced his hands into the pockets of his jacket, his flipped up collar barely concealing him from the cold.
He looked otherworldly, paying no mind to the chaos around him, and it was times like these that it was almost impossible for Dean to get his mind around the fact that this was his
“We will figure things out with Cas,” Sam said. “We won’t stop until we find a way to help him. You know that, Dean.”
“Oh hell— okay. Bad idea,” Dean said, an embarrassed laugh bubbling out of him. He knew what this meant. “Uh, alright. I’m gonna take the reins on this one, buddy, but you make sure and watch me.”
Jack fell to his knees beside Cas, hands flocking to his face, and Dean fought through an aching chest to ask, “Can you fix him?”
Dean stilled the second he noticed, hands stopping in their fumble to search through his wallet for cash. A quiet fury rose in him, starting from his feet right up to his temples, white hot and fast brewing like a summer storm.
Dean stared openly through the darkness, throat working. His fingers curled around the amulet, and his chest suddenly felt too tight to live in. There was no guarantee that this would work. Jack might not even be able to contact the amulet the same way Chuck could, but it gnawed at something in Dean anyway. Ate away at him like deception and greed and ignorance, all of it mangling into a storm of emotion that settled right at the base of his throat.
fix things, now is the time. No more house calls, no more gatekeeping Heaven and warming the bench— we need you
“A demon?” There was more confusion than fear in his voice, his reactions oddly controlled. Cas’s eyebrows rose curiously, lips parting
“I’ll be right back,” Sam insisted hastily, and just like that he was staggering away, making a direct beeline across the bar. He disappeared out the back door, the shadow of him swinging with the hinges.
“I know you didn’t,” Dean told him quickly, desperate to wipe that look off Sam’s face. “Truth is, ever since Eileen came back I’ve been different around her. I mean I’ve cleared the air, but I’ve been different around you too, and you don’t deserve that. You two just... you’ve got it good, don’t you?” He breathed, wistful, and he forced out a laugh that ripped through the yearning.
And it pulled at something in Sam’s winded chest, ripping at bone and muscle and broken strings. Rowena stilled for a moment, her breath even, and Sam could all but hear the way she was searching for him in the silence, wanting a sign that he was okay before she continued, “
Castiel stared at it, unblinking, and Dean would have been embarrassed if it wasn’t so obvious that Cas couldn’t remember a damn thing about the picture in Dean’s wallet, eyes going all squinty, nose wrinkling in a way that had warmth stirring in Dean’s rib cage.
But none of Dean’s questions were for this Cas. This Cas couldn’t give him the answers he needed, because this Cas didn’t feel the way Dean needed either. It wasn’t hard to figure out.
“I have a lot to say to the guy,” Dean fumbled with the receipt, his focus zeroed in on the crinkling paper as opposed to the way his voice came out shaking. “Shit that shouldn’t be dropped on someone during a phone call and I— I think if I call him, I think if I hear his voice I’ll fucking lose it and I need to just…
and a single thought occurred to Dean like a match striking to life, flickering in front of his eyes tauntingly.
It’s Sam who stirred first, bolting up in shock before turning to Dean in question. He lifted his eyebrows, panicking behind kind eyes.
“Almost finished.” The woman mumbled, slowly tracing over the Enochian lettering etched right above Cas’s hipbone.
“So much,” Cas said eventually. He couldn’t even look at Dean; his words dove straight for Dean’s throat, choking him. “You’re just so much.”
Dean thought he understood well enough. Although to Dean, it was hard to think of anything worse than forgetting his family.
Dean clenched his fist and thought hard, needing something other than the answer he wanted to give. He scrambled for it, grabbing at the first thing he could think of, and even that tore a path through his heart that he hadn’t visited in years.
“I’m aware,” Castiel smiled, and it was amusement that poured from him then, subtle but heart-kiltering, Dean’s body erupting in flames. Cas didn’t even seem to care about the pain in that moment; he was smiling wide and uninhibited.
Dean didn’t even have time to think before he was scrambling forward on shaky knees, choking back tears. He picked up the overshirt with trembling hands. His thumb brushed over the patch of dry blood at the shoulder, the color distorted with age now, cemented into the stitching of the fabric almost like a brand.
This hurt was never going to go away. Not while Cas was still gone, not while Dean still had so much left to say.
With a smile of his own, Dean continued. “I would’ve knocked his teeth in. Maybe spanked him and sent his ass home to his mom— dude, I have a
even when you don’t know how. Even when you—” He took a breath, slow and shaky. His heart was pounding through his skin, right at the swell of his throat, and he said, “Sometimes I just forget that when you leave me, it’s not your choice.”
“Patience, sweetheart. The build up is important.” Dean teased, even going as far as winking at Cas with a charm he knew would be met with annoyance rather than infinite swooning.
Distantly, Dean could feel his body moving. Hunter instinct sent him ducking out of the way and throwing his arms up over his head, shielding himself from broken glass. But all he could hear was Cas’s breathing; pulsated and fast as if every gulp of air was being punched out of him, forced from his lungs. There was electricity prickling somewhere above his head, glass cracking beneath his heel, but through a haze of light and shadows— all Dean could see was Cas.
He smiled at Dean then, a wide gummy smile that wrinkled the corners of his eyes and showed off white teeth. He seemed to lose himself somewhere in that smile. Seemed to forget about the sheer power held just at the breach of his fingertips, and instead relaxed into this version of Castiel that Dean thinks he likes the most.
“Really,” She smiled, and it was warm and genuine, pouring straight from her skin. Moonlight bent over her cheekbone, turning her lashes into delicate shadows. “You don’t have to apologize, because there’s nothing to apologize for. I like to think I’m pretty attuned to all thing’s Winchester at this point.”
Dean cleared his throat and stumbled further inside. Immediately, Cas moved to make room on the bed for him, stretching every which way and reiterating the fact that he was only wearing boxers and a t-shirt. Dean’s stomach dropped swiftly.
Dean jerked his head up towards the older woman leaning over the bar, notebook in hand. She was looking at Dean with her eyebrows raised over the rim of her glasses, bright yellow nails clicking at her pen.
One glance upward revealed he hadn’t. Cas was staring at Dean with no problem, brows furrowed in confusion, gleaming with innocent curiosity. Oblivious to any and all anal references.
He just knew that Cas, somehow, was also his name, and that the universe carried it towards him with a voice he didn’t recognize and a jaded pair of green eyes that looked strangely close to tears.
“Yeah, you’re probably right,” Dean let out a slow breath, his relief barely making it half mast before Sam added, “guess that makes two of you.”
Sam sighed, face twisting up awkwardly as he scratched at his jaw. He marked his page and closed the lore book he was currently nose deep in, something about angel omens and sigils it looked like, but even when squinting Dean couldn’t be sure.
Castiel sat up in his hospital bed with a start, their arrival just violent enough to startle him. His fingers clutched at the bedding nervously, gaze uncertain as he gingerly pulled the comforter up to his chin.
He tapped at the same spot over his own eyebrow, lowering his voice, “Whoever did that to you better be six feet under.”
There was a great deal of relief that ended up showing on his face anyway, despite the effort. But he kept with it, barely even raising his voice to let out a clipped, “Morning.”
There was a cassette playing somewhere in the background, an arrangement of guitars that Dean suddenly had no interest in as he glanced at Cas in the passenger seat, his face a haloed glow of passing headlights.
“It’s him,” Sam smiled through a rush of awe, lips twitching as he blinked back tears. He turned to Dean, breath catching. “Holy shit, Dean. It’s actually—”
Watching the two of them navigate this thing after nearly losing it entirely had been the only thing holding Dean together for the longest time. It had given him something to hope for, to look upon and think,
And Cas didn’t react much apart from a subtle shift in breath, a nervous flutter of eyes quickly moving from Dean back down to his own lap. His guilt was something that glared right off of him, hands fumbling together as a beat of silence passed.
But somehow, even with the Cas he had now, losing him still cut deeper than Dean thought possible. With this Cas, he’d be there with Dean one second, domestic and warm and too good to be true, and then the next he was gone, sneaking off to his room with exhaustion pulling him sideways, his silence lasting for days.
Dean couldn’t say he was surprised by the presence that followed, but he still whipped around to glare at Sam when he heard footsteps enter the hallway. Sam didn’t let it faze him; he simply gave Dean that soft mannered look, eyes big and comforting, and asked, “You alright?”
“Cas, I— I would’ve done something the second you got back from Purgatory if it wasn’t for Kevin and the friggin’ demon tablet. Benny and his—” Dean couldn’t say it. Not now, this wasn’t the time. Benny was gone, and Dean breathed through the pang in his chest. “That’s what I’d been hoping for. That we’d get out, we’d be alive and— and
“What’s your favorite color?” Cas asked while Dean was working under the Impala, his voice somewhere close to Dean’s feet where he was twisting awkwardly just to look at Dean from underneath the car.
Dean knew better than to question when Cas slowly started putting his shirt back on, arms shaking through the effort. Cas hadn’t worn a shirt to sleep during any of the nights they’d spent together, and when Dean finally slid into bed next to him, his body aching all over, the difference was jarring.
“Well, fuck you, first of all.” Dean shrugged, yanking his plate back over with a scowl and shoveling a forkful of pie into his mouth carelessly.
The demon faltered for only a second, body contorting wildly before his eyes cemented black and he grabbed Castiel by the throat, jolting back with the force of his laughter.
The man at the front desk gave the two of them odd looks as they signed in, and if Dean hadn’t thought they both looked like microwaved crap then he probably would have said something about it. Instead he just checked them in under some fake name, slapped down a handful of cash, and winked at the man as he left with a hand on Cas’s shoulder, leading him away.
Cas looked back down at the table with his hands folded gently in front of him, relaxed in a way Dean had come to recognize. Cas almost never wore his bandages anymore; his face was dark and patchy with facial hair, unruly around his bright scarring, but the lack of care didn’t bother Dean in the slightest. As long as he could still see Cas’s smile, he was content.
“It hurts,” He breathed, and Dean swallowed thickly when he felt fingers brush over the front of his throat, a thumb catching against the bolt of his jaw. He wondered if Cas could feel his heart trembling. “Dean— it hurts.”
He had done it all by himself. No begging or praying for it to all go away, because praying meant there was hope. Praying meant Dean believed there was someone out there who gave a damn about how much he hurt, and he couldn’t bear to be let down by another father.
“I’m gonna get him back, Jody,” Dean said, and there’s no anger this time, just a quiet insistence that would have felt like a promise if Dean was brave enough to call it that. “He’s not staying like this, I’m not—” He shook his head, glaring out the window. “I’m not giving up any time soon, alright?”
Castiel tilted his head towards the carved lettering, thoughtful, and Dean felt it like a punch to the gut. He hoped Cas had enough sense not to mention the other name on that table he didn't recognize, but ultimately it didn’t really matter either way.
“Cas is a big boy, Sam. He was able to get it up when he needed to, alright? Are we done?” Dean didn’t let Sam respond before he was clicking his tongue and rounding on his heel, “Awesome. I need a beer.”
“Okay, easy there champ,” Dean rolled his eyes fondly, taking the bottle back as Cas continued to cough his way through it. “And to think, you used to have quite the tolerance for this crap.”
Dean held his stomach desperately, trying to compose himself through gulps of air, but it was Cas reaching forward and carefully running his fingers through his hair that finally made Dean stop. It was almost funny how his laughter turned into dead silence, the situation much less amusing now that Cas was actually putting his words to use, touching Dean in a way that was unmistakably intimate.
“Listen, Dean. I know how this looks, okay? I do. But, Cas, he—” Sam turned his head to look back through the room’s window, expression falling.
Dean dropped his head back against the seat with a heavy breath, heart pounding. “What the fuck was that?”
“My decision to come with you two is becoming increasingly worrisome. First you tell me monsters are real, and now you… you live in a secret dungeon?” He mumbled as he made his way down into the war room, Sam following close behind.
“I wanted to apologize for earlier,” Patience started suddenly, ripping Dean’s pulse from his ears. She stirred her ice cream idly, shoulders lifting, “
is your life, and it blows on a good day, but pal—” He raised his shoulders, smiling bitterly. “There are worse places to be.”
” Dean shook through the outburst, eyes moving rapidly around the room. “I’m angry, alright? I am, I’m pissed. But all of that can go away if you— if you could just—” He let the silence resurface, coating him thinly. Dean looked down at the shirt clutched between his tear soaked hands, “
In all fairness, Dean started out teaching Cas how to shave just fine. He went in with a pair of scissors first, cutting off unruly clumps of hair that would be a bitch to get with just a razor, and the entire thing went over just fine. Dean barely even touched the guy.
Dean didn’t react for a moment. His face stuck in this breath between nonchalance and anger, unsure of which one to let take over.
His entire body softened, lungs giving in, and he squeezed the angel’s hand. Castiel lit up at Dean's acceptance, cheeks flushing red, and Dean smiled fondly as he was helped up and onto the car, the lingering warmth of Cas’s hands suddenly more exciting than terrifying.
He’d discover that he’d somehow imagined the whole thing; created the burn in his fingertips as he’d stitched Cas up, was plagued by nothing but his own mind as he watched Cas sit up in a hospital bed and stare right through him.
He wasn’t used to this; the soft touches, the wonderment within them. A sort of heart-wrenching reverence that would have made Dean fall fast and mindless if he wasn’t so gone already. He wasn’t used to getting that kind of love from anyone, let alone from someone like Cas. And Dean knew Cas didn’t have his grace anymore, but with every kiss, Dean’s insides spiraled and his soul quivered regardless, shining a brilliant incandescent blue that pooled and poured past his eyelids.
Every direction felt like the wrong one. Say this or that and Cas would be ripped from him again. He wouldn’t trust Dean, and he wouldn’t love Dean, and it was only a matter of time before everything fell apart anyway because it was
And then, every few days, the shift would come. Cas would be back, fresh and inviting, smiling as if he’d been by Dean’s side the whole time. It was excruciating.
It was when Cas finally got a sense of his own hands again and reached up to grip Dean’s hair that Dean finally let out a breathy moan, body contorting with a shiver that was so ridiculous he ended up pulling away laughing.
Dean stopped. Heart falling still in his chest, jaw tensing as he pressed his lips closed. Right. Dean was going to have to get better at this whole honesty thing wasn’t he?
“Hello,” He said, gruff and proper, his voice even deeper with disuse, and all Dean could think was that he looked just fine.
Sam pulled the front door closed and checked the lock, duffel bag bumping against his hip as he moved. He came up behind Cas with an amused smile, clapping a hand on his shoulder to get him to start making his way down.
Alright, wow yeah- this chapter was a big one! A lot of changes happened, good and bad, and I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments! Not only was Cas's situation finally explained a little, and Dean came to terms with some heavy shit, but Dean and Eileen worked through things, which is something I'd been wanting to address for so long.
Castiel visibly melted, relief turning him limbless. The way he looked at Dean was similar to the way Dean would imagine he’d look at a thunderstorm; terrified and enthralled all at once.
Dean could imagine that in any other state of mind, he would’ve melted at the way Cas seemed to lean into his touch, following him blindly in the dark. But now it just made him want to hold on tighter, touch him deeper so that Cas didn’t feel the need to reach out for something Dean had been trying to give him for years.
Human Cas was a sore subject. It used to be that way for both of them, neither of them ever wanting to talk about it. But with the way Cas was now, he had no problem with looking over at Dean and diving head first into the tension that had surfaced there, head tilting gently as the skin around Dean’s eyes grew tight and thin, any warmth in his face retreating back inside of him like a skittering animal.
Dean didn’t pay Sam any mind as he rounded the kitchen island. He could feel the disappointment already gathering in his brother’s face, his eyes worried-soft and flickering every which way, but Dean’s head was just fuzzy enough for him not to care all that much when he felt his skin begin to itch from the scrutiny. His ears burned and his stomach sank, but there was a swirling warmth flooding in from the back of his ribs— and that’s all Dean needed to feel blissfully numb.
it appeared. “Dean, I— I shouldn’t have called you. This isn’t your war and I dragged you in it. I got you involved in matters that don’t involve you
by, that it stole the air right out of him, his insides splintering beneath a ceaseless weight. Back when Dean was still bright eyed and soft edged, blowing through towns just as fast as he’d breeze through women, and he’d believed that Sam leaving him for Stanford was the worst betrayal there was. That family was blood bound and you couldn’t escape it or change it or wish for anything more.
“Let’s hear it then,” He said, and Jack released a heavy breath, the height of his shoulders melting into something much more fragile.
“Good thing I showed up when I did then, huh?” Dean pushed himself up onto the counter beside the sink, swearing inelegantly when he knocked his ankle against the bottom. His feet started swinging before he could help it, a subtle left and right that had him bumping against Cas’s thigh. “I see you finally got your hands on the bumblebee bottoms,” He noticed innocently, before lowering his voice to say, “I knew I should’ve burned those things.”
There were bandages down his arms, some sort of compress he was holding to his cheek, but other than that he was very much alive. Very much okay, and Dean didn’t know whether to be worried or relieved, his emotions threatening to string him up right there.
There was that honesty again, the same chest woven pain from last night that Dean had been forced to squint at in the darkness.
The gas pump clicked, and Dean let out a terse sigh, pulling himself up from where he was leaning against the back end. Sam stayed quiet as Dean unlatched the pump behind the license plate and ripped his receipt from the machine.
And Dean wanted to tell him. God— he’s wanted to tell Sam for years. Not just about Cas, but about the truth that lies just beyond that. How long had Dean spent carrying half-finished speeches in his head?
“So this is Baby,” Cas said pointlessly, trying for conversation. The effort made Dean smile sadly, nodding. “How long have you had her?”
It took Cas approximately five seconds to respond, all of which Dean spent feeling like his ass was hanging out in the open, his heart pounding through his skin.
” Jody murmured, and Dean knew he didn’t deserve the comfort in her voice, but he clung to it anyway. Thought about how badly he wanted to be better because of people like her. “
After that’s put away, Dean was left with an odd sort of brewing in his gut. This hint of annoyance that stung no matter how hard Dean tried to wash it away, ignore it completely.
“If Jack could be here he would,” Sam said quietly, hardly even a whisper that Dean stamped out with a wave of his hand.
Dean could feel the eyes as they turned to him. The spell had been broken now, the peace obliterated, and Cas sighed heavily, the irritability in it finally getting Dean’s head to swivel. It took all of two seconds for Dean to recognize the look on Cas’s face, everything inside of him pinched tight, locked in, and suddenly all reservation was tossed to the side, and Dean was crossing the room without a second thought.
“You already know everything about me,” Dean shrugged, fighting just to breathe. “Everything that I am you… you
She left his shoes on the counter and drew closer, sinking down to sit at the edge of his bed. Her eyes were worried, already, instinctively, and Dean sat up with a flaming headache, wanting to reach out for her but unsure how to.
And maybe Dean would have listened to Sam if it wasn’t for Cas. He would have had a chance at basic function if it wasn’t for the way Cas was writhing and heaving through gritted teeth, thrashing in pain. But Dean couldn’t breathe through what he saw or think past what he knew, and what he knew was that if he had to watch Cas die in front of him again, this time, it wouldn’t be long before he followed.
Castiel was already shaking his head before Dean could even finish, inhaling sharp and tight against Dean’s ear.
It wasn’t until Miracle finally broke free and started licking at the wound on Cas’s face that Dean stepped in. He pushed Miracle to the side with a light scold and patted at his backside until he eventually trotted over to Sam and Eileen, his tail never falling still.
“I used to have nightmares about you. About losing you,” Dean said weakly. “You disappearing into a lake or… or just flat out disappearing, leaving us. I never told him that.”
“You know ASL?” Dean asked, staring at Cas with what felt like a glimmer of hope. “You— you can remember something like that?”
Dean could see the question in Castiel’s gaze, heavy and overbearing, almost angry. But apparently, it wasn’t important enough to voice; he nodded once and pulled away, withdrawing back into the sheets. Dean did his best not to think too hard about the way Cas hastily covered himself back up, pulling the blankets up to his chin.
“Cas is scared, Dean. He might trust us, but he doesn’t know us, and if nothing changes, if things don’t go the way we planned...” Dean could see the words forming before they were even out. “We might just have to start over with Cas.”
When Dean fell asleep, his stomach grumbling and his skin still heavy with the scent of smoke and dust, it was with Castiel curled up tight in his arms.
He kissed Cas’s cheek because he wanted to. Watched the way it made the angel smile all handsome and gummy because
want that. His gut twisted at the thought, hands clambering for comfort over the fur behind Miracle’s ears. Over a month without hunting and he was already growing soft, wishing he could admit how badly he wanted out, how content he was with simply
“Are you sure?” Sam asked, leaning in to make sure Eileen could see him speak. Or maybe just leaning in to lean in, pressing closer. “You got him?”
“It doesn’t hurt, right. Well, humor me then,” Dean didn’t wait for an answer. He reached for the sterile bandages tossed across the bed and took the seat next to Cas, blatantly ignoring the other man’s defeated sigh. Dean placed a great distance between them, no part of him touching Cas; he intended to keep it that way.
“Yeah?” Dean repeated. “Then march in there yourself and tell Sam what the hell’s going on with you.”
“Patience struck out,” Dean told him, flashing an easy smile. “We didn’t figure out much but, how are you feelin’? You took one hell of a nap.”
“No, I’m good,” He said, and Dean nodded, turning to leave. Sam continued just a second later, a grin in his voice, “Maybe you should let Cas tag along?”
There was a certain rhythm to the way they did this now; habits had been made, a ritual established, but Dean’s heart still pounded all the same when Cas started kicking off his shoes, his steps familiar, the sound of him breathing all too comforting.
with Cas, exist in his realm, orbit his planet, because who knew how much longer he’d have this. Who knew if this would be the last time.
I know this didn’t turn out the way you wanted, and as far as last chances go I definitely dropped the ball—”
“We’ve gone in on less haven’t we?” Dean shrugged, turning a half-assed glare at Sam from the driver’s seat, silently warning him to drop it.
Dean almost never came down here. He’d rather be doing pretty much anything than sweating his ass off throwing around dumbbells and risking his life using seventy-year old equipment, but there were only so many places Dean could go where he wouldn’t risk running into Cas, and at this point he was desperate; agreeing to spot Sam was an all new low.
“Alright, okay, we can do that just—” Sam sighed deeply, exhausted. Dean didn’t say anything. “Let us get back and pack, and while we’re there Eileen and I can take showers before we head out.”
And so the lying began, and Dean didn’t even manage to last an hour before he was itching to get away.
“Don’t worry about that,” Dean said, sounding sincere, almost certain. He smiled at Cas and patted him lightly on the leg, not expecting the way his heart immediately settled at the touch. “We’ll figure it out, alright? Find some angel to patch you up, you’ll be good as new.”
changed, because what inevitably came was an embrace that Dean didn’t think either of them had been ready for.
Dean staggered sideways, suddenly staring through anger so prominent he could feel it at the back of his throat, flaring behind his nostrils. There was panic too, mangled and distorted somewhere in the mix. That familiar wave of fear that had been following him around for days now, reminding Dean of everything Cas had forgotten, the feelings that had been ripped clean from him before Dean could even speak his own.
more than he’s ever wanted anything, but Cas pulled away before Dean could think to make anything of the moment.
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean said smugly, eyes filling with mirth when he caught Cas smiling behind his menu. “I’m taking your pie virginity, I get to be ridiculous.”
“It’s different,” Sam sighed, straining just to comprehend it all. He was gripping Eileen’s hand desperately now, fingers blooming with color. “When Anna fell from Heaven, her grace fell with her. But when Cas became human, the Empty couldn’t have a hold on him anymore. It did what it was meant to do; it let humanity free, and kept the rest locked away.”
It wasn’t the first time Dean had mentioned Charlie, but her existence always seemed to shock something in Cas. Alert him to a realization he couldn’t quite get a grip on yet. Dean usually never asked him about it, but now, parked together somewhere at the edge of Colorado with only headlights leading the way back home, Dean felt oddly brave.
“I’ll watch him,” Eileen said, and Dean felt the soothing hand at his elbow before he even saw her appear beside him. Dean turned to her with wide eyes, fear creeping in fast.
Dean was too enamored to notice right away that the bedroom door had opened. It took Sam awkwardly clearing his throat from the doorway for Dean to spring up with about a million excuses on the frontline of his tongue.
“Just do it,” Cas grimaced, his sudden vice-like grip on the whiskey bottle making the edges of his knuckles seep white.
There were people already pouring in the doors by the time they arrived at the bar, heavy groups of drunk friends and nervous teenagers lingering in the smoke-hazed gravel lot. The sun hadn’t gone down quite yet, but the sky had already started to break apart, streaks of orange light fading into the surrounding trees. Dean had been to this place plenty of times before, and never had he seen it quite like this.
Castiel shifted in his seat, eyes growing more and more worried as they rolled through the parking lot. “Is this really a wise decision given your concussion, Dean?”
“Take care of my dog, alright?” He tried for lighthearted, anything to stop the ache in his chest from spreading, but Cas was quiet. “Bye, Cas.”
Dean turned to walk back to the driver’s side, fully intending to haul ass back to the bunker and drink a few too many beers to fall asleep, but stopped dead when he heard the Impala groan painfully under a sudden weight. With a jerk of his head, Cas came back into view, his body outstretched across the hood and the front windshield in a manner that would have been sexy had it been demonstrated on
his expression just screaming to be spread out and held to attention, and Dean didn’t think it was possible to miss someone who was right there in front of you, but
Humiliated and drunk off white hot pain, Dean ended up getting cornered into his own backseat. He crawled over the leather with a pout on his face, dried blood making his face itch, and he honest to god whined when Eileen slid into the seat beside him and Sam took off down the road without even trying to be mindful of the new break line.
“What the hell’s happening?!” Dean screamed, and when he moved, he might as well have been wading through water. He could barely put one foot in front of the other, the weight of him teetering left and right as he stumbled towards Cas’s bedside.
“I want to see you,” Dean swallowed, truly pushing himself here and getting nothing in return but Castiel's dumbfounded expression. Dean sighed, moving his face forward to catch Cas’s eye. “Cas?”
“Cas!” He sat up and touched Cas on the shoulder. Dean wasn’t able to see his face, but his heart still dropped all the same when Castiel flinched violently, withdrawing.
“It should be perfectly capable of holding our weight. I’ve seen you and Sam do the same,” He insisted, and then, giving Dean an adorably reassuring smile and an outreached hand, he said, “I saw this in a movie once."
” Claire demanded, with all the same exaggerated sass and bullshit temper that made Dean want to equal parts laugh and roll his eyes till sundown; he could imagine the frustrated pinch of her eyebrows, the defiant way she’d clench her jaw when she got too close to breaking out into a smile.
missed you, and you finally came back only to take off again the second we turned our backs because you don’t know how to look us in the eyes anymore.”
Although, if Dean was honest with himself, it’s something that’s followed him for years. For forever. Like a quiet torch, sometimes barely glowing, other times roaring towards the sky. A part of him that had always wondered how Sam managed to do all the things he couldn’t, how it was so easy for him to want things and have things and talk about the way he felt without wanting to scream at everyone around him.
was the one who had let that happen. Somehow, someway, and instead of getting pissed at himself it was easier to just get pissed in general.
Dean sunk to the ground in a watered down haze, eyes glowing red and white, heart splitting open. He pressed a hand over his mouth, forcing himself quiet as he leaned back against the edge of his bed.
“I mean I—” Cas faltered, frustration brimming in his eyes. “I get memories, Dean. But they’re more feelings than memories really, recollections without context. Flashes of before that— that come and go, sometimes so fast I don’t even realize it. But it’s all so hard to comprehend and I don’t understand it.”
Vaguely, he could recall never feeling this way before. Cold, freezing from the outside in, crippling, and he didn’t know what to make of it except that he was afraid.
” She smiled, softening up. Dean could imagine she’d punch him affectionately in the arm if he was there. “
“S—sorry, I didn’t even…” He trailed off, eyes stuck somewhere past Dean’s shoulder. He brushed a hand down his arm, the movement bristling with quiet nervousness.
The kiss wasn’t what Dean had always imagined it would be. It wasn’t dirty and rough, wielded together by desperation and demanding hands that pulled at clothes and searched for skin. This kiss was even better, their lips meeting in slow perfection of nervous breaths and gentle touches that made Dean miss it gravely once it was over.
But with Cas it had almost become a comfort. Just as easy as breathing, as instinctual as popping in with a shitty joke that Cas would belittle him for the next time he saw him, as simple as closing his eyes and asking,
“But I’ve already chosen,” Jack said, easy as a summer’s breeze, lacking all the same misery Sam could still feel like an old sore. Jack smiled then, soft and well-mannered, sporting the kind of certainty Sam didn’t think he’d felt until his mid-twenties, and asked, “Why would I want to be anywhere else but home?”
“Right,” Sam stammered, shaking his head with a dazed smile. He breezed his way across the room and towards the door with a whip of his hair, movements awkward.
” Cas repeated, incredulous if not downright panicked, and Dean tensed up violently, eyes widening as Cas continued, uncertain, “
Dean didn’t know why he said it. Even Cas didn’t seem to understand the emotion in his own voice, how one word could be both a thousand questions and a million understandings, but the way he looked at Dean once he finally brushed past and joined him in the hallway— quiet and soft and profound as if just looking at Dean made him feel the most impossible things— that was something even Dean didn’t think could be a coincidence.
Dean tried to voice this, all of it and then some. Thought about a suspension in time where he’d fallen to his knees in a land of monsters, his fists curled and his voice finally breaking with tears, giving with honesty that he wished he could navigate now.
And yet none of that compared to the ache of loneliness that had lived in Dean during those four years without his brother.
It pained Dean to no end to watch Castiel’s hand hover in the air between them. It was clear he wanted to touch, his fingers stretched towards Dean’s chest, right where Dean’s heart bled through his skin, but Cas didn’t. The moment passed, his hand dropped, and he didn’t.
“I found it!” Jack exclaimed. Just the elation in his voice and the tilt of his smile was enough to make Dean’s heart lurch, his feet stuttering forward to get a better look. “I see his grace, I see…”
is why I didn’t want to tell Sam that something was wrong. He’d do anything to help you, including risking his own life to fix me and that’s— I can’t—” Cas’s face contorted miserably, and everything inside of him seemed to be crumbling as he said, “Nothing is worth losing either one of you.”
There was a Gas N’ Sip just five miles West of the bunker that was always Dean’s first pick for supply runs, but the thought of going there now reminded him of human Cas in Idaho, nuking taquitos and going on dates in that stupid sweater vest.
“Just fine, thanks,” Dean smiled, feeling a little bad, but then the boy finally looked up and his eyes widened horrifically upon landing on Castiel.
other than that, but the bubble retreated for the last time, and Dean slowly slid his phone back into his pocket.
but Castiel having no memory of not just Dean, but everything they’ve ever fought for had never even crossed his mind.
“You were actually more of a dick if I’m honest,” Dean said without thinking. He immediately continued when he saw the shock on Cas’s face, a timid laugh spilling out of Dean without his permission. “But you were strong too. You’d been through a lot, and if you said some shit you didn’t really mean I knew it. I never held it against you.”
“You’re… I don’t know— you’re you,” Dean finished lamely before shaking his head, shoulders dropping. He didn’t know what he was saying. “You haven’t changed much. I thought maybe with all that happened with Metatron, with the angels… being human. I figured you’d be different.”
“Don’t do anything stupid, Sam,” She said when she pulled away, more stern than anything, and Dean couldn’t help the quiet smile that bloomed across his face.
It took a second, only one, and suddenly Dean was back in the bunker’s dungeon with the threat of death wading in his lungs like water. Looking at a Cas with too many tears in his eyes, too much emotion clogging his throat— emotion that shouldn’t even be there, and Dean was scared. Scared of pushing Cas back into himself, scared of refusing the
“What if I just never leave you?” He asked, vibrating in his own body. Even in the dark, the shift in Castiel’s eyes was distinct, and Dean all but caved into his own skin when he felt Cas’s thumb brush over the corner of his mouth. “If I don’t go, you don’t go, right? If you stay with me, then there’s no pain. There’s no relapse, you can’t— you can’t
A slow tick started in Dean’s temple, rolling down to his jaw. It felt like a warning. The same way dread would creep in on a dead end hunt, or fear would blare wildly in Dean’s chest when he’d catch himself staring at some handsome stranger basked in bar light for just a beat too long.
It hurt just to look at him, even now. Alive and present but terse and doubtful, his essence oozing power while his body drowned in clothing. Jack had become something unfathomable, a child whose blood could send the Earth quaking, whose mind and body and soul didn’t align, and Sam didn’t know how to talk to him. How to look at him without instantly wanting to break apart.
Castiel hummed distractedly, burying his nose into the front of his scarf as he read through the menu. “
Somehow, it only made sense that this hunk of rusted metal was one of the most important objects in the universe. Dean figured that if anything was going to be the telephone between God and the Winchester’s, it would be the amulet.
For a second, the only movement was Lundy’s mouth, his upper lip curling into this repulsive division of a snarl and a seething smile. A picture of pure evil that Dean knew Cas— this Cas, had never faced, and yet was now staring at head-on with an unwavering intensity that only came from a being who knew exactly what was coming next.
Black and blue swirled in his vision once he was upright again, and he blinked at Sam blearily, wiping his mouth.
“Alright, how bout’ we find the nearest diner and go to town on those new taste buds of yours, huh? How does that sound?” Dean asked, grinning over his shoulder as he started the car and turned back to check for traffic, hand gripping the top of the seat.
Despite his words, Castiel still flinched upon incision, jolting just abrupt enough to make Dean hiss out a curse through his teeth. Struggling to tighten his grip on him, Dean choked out, “Jesus— you gonna be a man about it or not?” and Cas reluctantly forced himself to relax. He stuck to glaring at the top of Dean’s head instead.
because hope was the only thing keeping him from drifting away, uprooting his entire sanity. Hope, or stupidity, whatever you wanted to call it— was what had always gotten Cas back to him. That was the secret, the never-changing variable.
Dean dropped his head immediately, a curse spilling out of him. She did exactly what he would’ve done; she didn’t listen to a damn word he said.
“Come on, man,” He groaned, dragging a hand over his sleep-desperate eyes. “You’re tellin’ me you still haven’t seen that movie?
"If you don't want to… you shouldn't feel obligated to, Dean." Cas tried to remain distant, unaffected, but his voice came out broken and weak, his biggest fear unfolding right in front of him. Dean stiffened with confusion, heart leaping when he caught Cas's eyes and saw barely concealed tears. "I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. I just thought..."
that Dean realized what was actually happening. He stopped dead in his tracks, hand moving to the gun at his hip just as the woman threw her head back and screamed.
“Fuck, I’m sorry,” Dean rasped. Sam was eying him warily, but he stayed silent, patient as ever. “You keep asking me all these questions and I— I don’t
Jack stepped up to them, apprehension clear in his eyes as he raised two fingers to each of their foreheads.
“Fuck’s sake…” Dean grumbled, squinting through the front windshield to stare at Cas who, unsurprisingly, remained unmoved.
Dean nodded, his eyes no longer dry. He wiped clumsily at the tears before they could fall, dragging a hand back through his hair to try and hide them, but his ears were red and Cas could hear him sniffling and
Cas immediately raised his head, rippled by another thought that seemed to surge right out of him, “I remember flying.”
Sam snorted into the rim of his beer and curled back in his seat, laughing in that way he almost never did, indecent and boyish and loud, head tilted back and beer dripping down his chin. He leaned towards Dean while Eileen moved for Cas, her smile infectious enough to make Cas turn to her with a smile of his own when she touched his arm, even if he had no idea why Dean was suddenly glaring down at the table with his jaw set, blushing furiously.
Cas gave Dean a sobering look, finally composing himself long enough to finish a tricky part at the corner of his mouth where scar webbing began to stretch. He ran his razor under hot water and wiped at his face with a towel, mouth twisting.
“That’s not what I’m saying, man. It’s not,” Dean said dejectedly, feeling all the weight tip to his shoulders. “I just… I’m not sure I know what ‘more’ is supposed to look like.”
“I had my suspicions,” Cas said carefully, uncertain as to what Dean wanted to hear. He looked at Dean thoughtfully, the shadow of a smile breaching his eyes. “It’s only been a few days but, you want to know the thing I miss most about being an angel?”
“Sure you have,” Dean pushed his cards down and away over the kitchen table, voice suddenly serious, close to frustrated. “You just can’t remember.”
It had started gradually, nothing but odd mood swings and a distance in his eyes that Dean couldn’t place. Almost like he was a million miles in the direction of nowhere even when speaking to Dean directly, his mouth moving without diction. But soon the switch became jarring, an illusion of night and day, and Dean could hardly look at Cas without trying to gauge what move he’d make next.
He couldn’t help it. Cas was looking at him with parted lips, bated breath, eyes shaky and nervous like he wasn’t sure what parts of Dean’s face he was allowed to look at, and Dean couldn’t fucking help it.
The lie tasted vile on Dean’s tongue. It surfaced as a pounding in his head and a stone in his ribcage, a pressure that refused to let Dean forget about the quiet corner he’d learned to drift towards when the going got too tough, or the alcohol worked too well. The place in Dean’s mind where retirement was inevitable and the guilt of leaving the life wasn’t enough to stop him. The place where Dean got to sleep in and kick back and kiss Cas and
Unlike Dean, Sam didn’t let something like failure chip away at him until he was stilted dust. It wasn’t part of his wiring, his brain worked much differently, and Sam already had a plan whirring behind the panes of his eyes before the smoke from the failed spell could even reach the rafters.
Doubt was beginning to weigh on him now, the powerless impairment of it sinking into his bones, wringing him dry. Dean didn’t know what to expect. He could walk through that door and find Cas limbless and shaking, blinded and touch-dead, his face torn open and his mouth sealed shut. Cas could be
Dean knew he sounded frantic, maybe even a little unhinged. But when it came to this— Cas by himself, human and targeted by every angel on Earth, there was too much at stake. Human Cas meant no powers, no healing, no special mojo that never seemed to stop Dean from shielding Cas anyway, stepping in front of raised guns that they both knew did nothing to him.
Dean didn’t even try to wait for an answer, and nobody seemed all that tempted to stop him. His legs moved him forward and his heart led the way, pulling him down the hallway towards Cas’s room.
Color rose in Castiel’s face, deep and honey-warm, and when Dean finally found the sense to drop his hand, it felt as though every knuckle weighed a thousand pounds. Dean curled his hand by his side, fingers creaking.
When Sam didn’t say anything else, Dean finally turned to face him fully, eyes drawn with suspicion. He straightened his shoulders and stuffed a hand in his pocket, suddenly serious.
The heat fled back to Dean’s face in a senseless swarm, no amount of relief capable of stamping down the immediate swell of shock he felt course through him, blood pumping with it.
Sam visibly deflated in the silence, and when he spoke next, his voice came out trembling, “I didn’t mean to make it seem like what’s going on with Cas isn’t—”
But then Cas’s questions got harder; revealing, forcing Dean to actually think and press into his own skin just to rip out answers.
“I’m missing someone,” Cas murmured, fumbling with his spoon. “I can't remember them, but I miss them, and this helps. I don’t know why.”
Dean walked up to the frozen meat section with a grin split halfway up his face. He threw a package of bacon into the basket— the regular kind, not any of that turkey crap Sam was always begging him to get— and turned to gawk at Cas, uncertain whether to be amused or offended.
Dean’s breath trembled through his next inhale, and Cas stopped to look at him, his expression painfully honest. In that moment, Dean could see everything; the grief and the guilt and the confusion of feeling everything but knowing nothing, and the love was there too. Blinding as anything, pouring from his skin and bounding from his eyes, and Dean didn’t know what was more terrifying; the thought of this ending, or the promise of it finally beginning.
“I didn’t say anything,” Sam laughed, and he tried to bat Sam’s hands away, but his brother was a strong little fucker and he grabbed a fistful of the back of Dean’s jacket, helping him towards their motel room.
It wasn’t intentional. It wasn’t planned. Dean had been doing his damndest to not even think about the kid. But after waking up trembling in a mask of his own sweat, the sight of black tar and charred Earth still running havoc down the skin of his eyelids, Dean didn't even need hope to pull himself out of bed and stagger towards his nightstand.
Like most things, Dean said it and regretted it all in the same breath. His teeth clenched and his lips curled at the silence that followed, and he wanted to take it back. He wanted to tell Cas it was okay, and he was okay, and it didn’t matter if Cas didn’t love him anymore because he was used to never getting what he wanted, but he couldn’t.
“It’s Cas, right?” Sam said without warning, leaving him to witness Dean’s expression soften unbearably, gaze wavering. His throat bobbed around a heavy swallow, lips parting to speak— but Sam beat him to it. “You think that somehow, this has something to do with Cas.”
“Just… different,” Cas frowned down at the bedding, his voice nothing but a low rumble. His hair was dripping over his forehead now, flared out over the shell of his ears, and Dean fought against the glaring urge to fix it.
Then, softer, “I think you should try anyway. Think of something even the old me didn’t know about you.”
He didn’t go look in Cas’s room straight away. If he was really gone, Dean would figure it out a different way. Any way was more preferable than seeing Cas’s bed neatly made and untouched, dust gathering over his books and odd little trinkets he’d collected over the years.
“Like you said,” Cas fixed him with a knowing look. “There are some people who wouldn’t see Charlie like you do. They would view her as something less, something not meant to exist. But not you.” He shook his head and averted his eyes, quickly. It was disappointing at first, but Dean soon became thankful that Cas wasn’t looking right at him when he said, “you have this ability to make people feel loved, Dean. It’s rather extraordinary.”
“Is it that obvious?” Cas looked down at himself, frowning a little as he brushed a hand through his hair. “I’m sorry, I should have cleaned up a bit more.”
managing to be late to every party. But this time was different. It wasn’t like anything Dean was used to; having to be so restricted around Cas, so unlike himself.
The door closed again, and Dean was on his feet in an instant, surprised by the lack of fear he felt. His ears were burning something awful, sure, and his stomach was in knots, but he wasn’t scared about what this looked like. Not as much as he would’ve been just over a year ago. Dean wasn’t sure what that meant about him, but he couldn’t help but think it was a good thing.
Dean stuffed the pistol he kept under his pillow into the back of his jeans and zipped up his duffle. He pulled his door closed on the way out.
“She’s a psychic,” Dean started to explain, slowly untangling himself from the table. He ignored the pop in his knees, straining as he moved. “She lives with Jody and Claire, and she's driving a long way to come take a look at you, so behave.”
Something inside of Dean broke entirely at the sound of his voice, bursting apart with reckless abandon.
It’s obvious Cas was lost to Dean’s voice, his fingers curled vehemently into the bedding, but there wasn’t much else he could do but nod painfully and say, “Yes, I understand.”
“What do you mean you can’t?” Dean demanded, the panic in his limbs forcing heat into his voice, a misplaced anger he couldn’t control. “Haven't you heard my prayers? I’ve been praying to you all night.”
Cas’s lips peaked with the hint of a smile. No teeth, that was too painful with the reddened scarring on his face, but Dean liked to think the smile was a good one anyway, reaching Cas’s eyes warmly.
He only raised his head when he heard the crackling of distant music, the rift of a guitar solo that made his chest kick with confusion and excitement all at once. Dean looked at Cas from across the room, hand hovering over the door knob.
But in reality, Dean too was still fighting for air. He was trying to find happiness in anything he could, whatever that might mean, but his soul was battered and his worth was gone and god— they had won, hadn't they? Things should be
“Uh, like— like markings in the ground, or some sort of energy… thing,” He made a gesture with his hands, ears turning red. Finally, he coughed out, “Blood? Was there blood?”
Dean sighed, head dropping. Things hadn’t exactly been kosher since Dean had yelled at Cas in the dungeon, leaving them in an odd sort of standstill with Dean unable to explain.
But Cas didn’t turn, and he didn’t see, and Dean was left staring at his retreating back as the angel opened the car door and stepped outside without a word.
It shouldn’t be normal. It shouldn’t be okay. But Castiel turned to him as if it was, lips parted in surprise before creasing at the sight of Dean. His hands were still skimming over the shelves without direction, and he barely spared Dean a glance before looking the other way.
He watched Cas walk away from him then, limping past, and to Dean he might as well have already been a ghost.
“He hurt you,” Cas filled the silence, startling them both. He looked from Dean to Sam and back, assessing. “Both of you.”
His body shook and rippled beneath skin, vibrating with pain, breath coming fast and labored before stopping just as quickly. Cas straightened and stilled, hand slipping off the door. He turned back to look at Dean with blatant shock.
He didn’t have a shirt on, and the dark sweatpants he’d managed to dig out from somewhere in his room were resting low on his hips, not quite as fitting as they used to be.
It made him want to teach Cas. Guide him through whatever it is he needed, whatever he didn’t understand. It’s a weakness Dean’s always had, a need to pull Cas around by the hand and show him humanity in the form of shitty motel swimming pools and homemade onion rings. Anything, really. Anything that would make sure Cas knew that there’s more to life than Heaven and Hell and all the fire trapped somewhere in the middle.
“We’re looking for someone,” Sam explained, and if he noticed the way Dean turned to stare at him gratefully, he didn’t show it.
“Don’t,” He gasped, face hot. “It’s fine. You’re fine— everybody’s—” He wasn’t crying, not yet, but he was close. His shoulder was on fire and his throat felt like road dust, everything blurring into meaningless colors. “You’ll be normal again in no time.”
Castiel threw him a grateful look, shoulders brushing as they stopped in front of an aisle. They moved quickly, Dean leading the way.
It calmed his nerves a little, to smile so genuinely. But the way Cas looked at him, watching carefully as lines formed in Dean’s cheeks, eyes wrinkling around the corners, had heat crawling up Dean’s ears.
He had given enough. All three of them had, and all Dean wanted in return was this; Cas by his side, safe and content just down the hall from him where all Dean had to do was call his name, and he’d be there. Trench coat or not, human or angel— Dean didn’t care so long as it was Cas telling him good morning, Cas smiling at him over coffee, Cas looking at Dean like he’d rebel and fall all over again if it meant he got to have the very same thing.
Dean traced a path over Castiel’s cheekbone, adoration sinking into his pores. He knew Cas couldn’t feel his touch, but god did his heart still ache for it anyway.
Sam’s giggling quieted down immediately, drawling into more of a whine as he rubbed the sole of his boot across the floor and muttered about chair marks, but the bunker didn’t have the chance to fall silent. Slowly, almost like a computer blinking to life, starting with a shudder of air and a churn of heat, Castiel began to laugh.
Jack’s gaze never wavered. He was a kid with the world dancing in his fingertips, peeling in his palms, and he should have cracked under Dean’s harshness. But there was something simmering in his features, an inexplicable sense of calm that threw Dean completely.
However possible, Cas’s gaze seemed to grow even softer, the focus in his eyes turning slow and warm as he looked at Dean.
“What?” Dean laughed, because it was instinct and the dip his stomach gave wasn’t a good one. He squinted at Sam, and his voice came out incredulous, “Since when haven’t you been game for becoming Mr. Rogers?”
Cas, for the first time, was just as vulnerable as the Winchester’s. Just as likely to bite it early, and Dean couldn’t stand to stay in the bunker a minute longer.
“You obviously know who I am,” Cas spoke quietly, brows furrowed as he watched Dean tie the cloth around his wrist. “Probably more than I know myself. But how do I know you’re not lying to me? You— you know I don’t remember anything, you could very well easily—”
Dean didn’t say anything as he stepped into the kitchen and took a seat at the table. Mornings for them were usually quiet anyway, this didn’t have to mean anything.
Sam rounded the hospital room door with suspicion, features pulled down in a way that told Dean he was trying very hard not to show what he was thinking. He peered through the tiny window at the top of the door, determined not to react, but it was impossible to miss the way his face bloomed with relief, eyes widening just a fraction.
