sorry. Oh fuck, I know you don’t like that, that’s why I didn't want you to see. We don't have to talk about it! It’s fine! I don’t need it or anything, or-or at least, I don't expect it from you. You have to know that Steve, I would never ask you for something you didn't want, something that makes you uncomfortable. Please, I’ll make sure you never see me like that again, just don't leave me, please.”
Tony bites his lip and blushes even more. He shakes his head.
” is grunted out from beneath him and Tony whines into Bucky’s mouth as he's kissed again, “I will never get tired of seein’ that.”
When he pulls back, Tony catches his hand, pouring a good puddle of lubricant into his palm before lying back and wriggling a pillow beneath his hips. His legs splay even wider than before, and the angle reveals more of him to Steve's gaze, letting Steve see all of him, and he fights back a growl as his fingers finally slip over Tony’s furled hole.
Well. He's definitely thinking about it now.
“Steve, please!” Tony eventually whines, grabbing at him with uncoordinated movements, desperation edging in his voice. “I want you to fuck me- yes, yes- Please! I'm ready, I-I'm so ready. I need it, need you...please!"
It feels like there's a short between Tony's brain and his nervous system. Steve's mouth is hot and open, kissing at the damage he's wrought and lapping it up with groans of ecstasy.
He pins Tony to the bed as he rides him one night, refusing to go any faster even though Tony shivers and shakes and pleads underneath him, and he thinks of how he really,
Steve thinks.
But Tony bulldozes over him, and Steve hates the look on his face; panic laced with fear and humiliation.
“You're damn right I am.”
. I went about this all wrong. I just felt like you deserved to know I saw you that night. And I know you would never ask me to do something I was uncomfortable with. Of course I know that, you are the most generous and kind partner I could ask for, that’s not what this is about at all.”
And when Steve crawls up his body, worship in his eyes and mouth, care in his hands and touches as he cleans Tony up and lays him back in a clean bed, Tony smiles at him, and says,
Not always, not every time, but enough that Tony was filled with a buzz of anticipation as soon as the invitation were made.
"You're beautiful, come on baby, this time, I wanna feel you squeeze me when I fill you up. Wanna watch you make a mess everywhere, yeah? Let me fuck the come outta you, just like I said? You gonna give it up to me? Huh sweetheart?"
"That so?" Steve murmured, his eyes narrowing at where Tony is propped up on their bed. "Everyone's type, huh? You included in that, too?"
And what a sight Tony made.
Violence is what happens when someone dares to take him from them.
Fury has it razed to the ground after three seasoned shield agents run out to empty their stomachs from the sights that greeted them upon entry. He's seen some shit, but what was inside there will haunt even his dreams.
But Tony's not quite ready yet, and honestly, Steve's not quite done exploring this himself. He hooks his fingers, purposeful and searching. He finds that bundle of nerves even alpha's have here, hidden in such an intimate place, and when he plays with it Tony makes one of those noises Steve has only heard that night he unwittingly spied on him.
"Anything," he slurs out, meaning it with all the pieces of himself that Steve already owns.
Bucky is staring at him, so close, so close. Looking at him, like he's never seen him before, like he's the thing he's been searching for his entire life.
That startled a chuckle out of Steve, and with a shaking sigh he crumpled forward, smooshing Tony into the mattress.  Tony wrapped him in his arms. “If you changed your mind about this, that’s okay. It doesn’t have to be tonight, it doesn’t ever have to happen if you don’t want to.”
A sharp pop of flesh on flesh, followed by the ripple as Tony’s rump jiggles from the impact. The pain follows, minor really, but stinging and prickling as it settles in, spreading a soft heat that reaches much farther than just the abused flesh to which Steve has applied his hand.
Bucky is panting into his neck and Steve is staring up at him like he's a vision from the heavens, sweat beading on his forehead and glistening on his pink flushed chest.
During Steve's workout, Bruce, Tony, and Clint come into the gym and take up positions in front of the mirrors for yoga. They go through several poses, and Tony is beautiful and steady through them all, his muscles flexing with the power he uses to fly his suit, the grace he shows in the air flowing through him from one pose to the next.
“No, no Tony, I’m not leaving you!” Steve moves towards Tony slowly, taking his hand when he gets close enough and drawing him into his arms. Tony is shaking. “That’s not what this is about.
"You don't know all the things I want from you...
Even with Steve not actively trying to get Tony off, Tony's own pleasure is a bed of coals, stoked slowly hotter, slow to warm but sure to be all the more blistering in its heat because of it.
“And here I thought you said you suck at speeches.”
"Sir, yes sir," he quips, before doing exactly what Steve asked.
Steve laughs in his ear, low and dark, nipping at his earlobe for just a second before he leans back, hands sliding into the crooks of Tony’s hips so he can tug him wherever he wants.
It's not violence when Clint works Tony over with a crop made just for him. When his aim is, as always, unerring as it leaves a latticework of precision welts across a finely muscled back that shivers and arches towards the carefully measured and meted out blows.
“Sweetheart?,” Steve gasps, reaching to wipe his face again, “baby, is it so good you're crying?” Tony just nods, gasping a sob for real now. “Yeah, baby, go on, cry if you need to...
Tony flexes his shoulders, rolling out tension from a long day, and Steve matches it to the way Tony threw back his head as he grasped his own ankles.
And Tony is engulfed in him, surrounded and shielded as Steve huffs soft words right in his ear. "I told you to take it, to take me, but you really just can't stop giving can you? You're so sweet to me. Sweet for me."
Full...
The sound registers first.
"Mmhm," Steve hummed, noncommittal, as he stood next to the bed and poked around in his nightstand. Tony watched him from the corner of his eye, not sure what his lover was doing exactly. And then Steve said, "The movies were okay, but after we drank, we wrestled a bit, I think Thor misses having his friends to do that with."
, Steve-,” Tony could hear it, the desperation in his voice even from where his lovers had sent him soaring.
“Easy tiger, I’ve got a heart condition.”
Steve presses a kiss to smiling lips before pulling back and carefully slipping his softening cock from Tony’s body. He can’t resist the urge to watch the way the rosy skin pulses a little, heat crawling up his spine when he watches a dribble of his own slick and come leak out. Gently, he catches it on his finger and pushes it back in, enraptured by how soft Tony feels here now, knowing only moments ago he had been there, nestled inside him, and even now there is evidence of his claim.
It's a little muffled even for his enhanced hearing, but the sounds of Tony’s short little moans are unmistakable even through the walls of the penthouse. The tone of them though…
Title: Size Him Up, Take Him Down
Damn. “Well, love-birds, I'm off,” he says and pushes off the counter, taking his coffee cup with him. It'll give him something to do with his hands. He hates fidgeters and he hates that he turns into one when he's out of his depth. “A piece of advice,” Tony says to the two wistful men still holding the other's hand. “Sex solves a lot. Like, a
“Tony!” Steve calls after him, voice scratchy, but Tony just runs.
” He lifts Mjølnir and crashes it down against the floor in time with music. “
” Tony sings, and the part of him that's still
'Cause you know the score,” and he's not glancing over at Steve, he's not, “
“Very well, sir,” JARVIS replies and is too damn polite to point out how Tony's voice is trembling. Tony hears the tell-tale clicks that lets him know that he's alone here now, nobody can get in, none except JARVIS, and that's okay because JARVIS is different.
“If you do not plan to go back to sleep, might I suggest you pay a visit to Sir's workshop?” JARVIS's voice is muted and doesn't wake up Clint.
Steve swallows and tries to block Tony's slack-jawed, terrified face from his mind. “Tony needs – he just needs a little space right now. I talked to him earlier, and we reached a tentative conclusion on who might be the cause of this.” Steve tells them the reasons he and Tony discussed – why Loki simply seems the most likely candidate. Clint and Natasha nod in perfect synchronization, something that was eerie and common long before this musical curse, and Bruce's eyes darken but he doesn't interrupt. Not even Thor says anything, and when Steve finishes, the demi-god actually nods.
“Affirmative. Stark's assembling.”
Natasha's eyebrows barely move, but they do draw in a fraction. “Something's wrong. Clint roams the streets or hides; that's how he reacts when he needs space. But he doesn't leave. Not without letting anyone know.”
Bruce sighs and pipes up, glancing out and at Iron Man's shape against the night sky. “
All the little things,” Tony sings and feels his cheeks heat up; maybe it's just as well he's about to keel over, now that his team knows he's a fucking closet romantic.
“Sir has always been extremely adept at robotics,” JARVIS murmurs, his blue-light eyes flashing towards Tony.
“I live to serve,” Clint snipes, and regrets the words as soon as he says them. Just a quip, it's just a quip, but
Steve's eyes are shiny and his face red; Tony turns to face the podium again, Loki avidly watching him. “
As my ally!,” and he touches Clint's cheek briefly, a shock of pure ice to his system. “
“Thank you very much, Captain,” JARVIS replies and smiles. That seems to reassure Steve of – well, something.
He looks down at their two bodies, nearly touching, and sees Phil in his mind; with a coffee cup, courtesy of Clint, with tired eyes and a smile after paper-working through the night. Such a common sight. Clint loved those nights when he'd camp out in Phil's office and listen to him do paperwork, and finally be able to catch some Zs. Feel safe.
Another sigh. “I didn't know, Romanoff.”
A terrible thought strikes Tony, but Steve's too fast for him: “Clint?”
,” Clint says, and that's when Phil speaks – sings – up, the two of them singing together, but not with each other; over each other, like a sung argument.
“Of course not,” Steve says, and hey, there's humor there somewhere, Tony's sure of it. “But you – you didn't know. About my v... That wasn't why you were making all those jokes.”
of what Clint and Natasha could do to him, and that Fury well deserves it.
“Yeah, about that,” Tony says and tells her about Clint's weird phone signal.
,” Steve sings, “
“I have not experienced any sudden urges to cantillate, Sir,” JARVIS says.
“In our underwear, about things we aren't telling each other,” Bruce says. “It was... mortifying.”
Phil's eyes are shiny, his pale features even starker with the blotches of red high on his cheeks, and he reaches out. “Clint...”
doesn't understand how the hell that happened – them – but it's clearly working for them both (even Hulk's taken to cuddling Thor post-battle instead of beating the shit out of him), and Tony's going to be so pissed if this damned curse splits them up. Contrary to common belief, Tony likes seeing his friends happy, even if the thought of Thor and Bruce having sex makes his brain boil.
“My systems are being overridden, sir,” JARVIS says, and sounds like he wants to swear. “I apologize in advance.”
” Clint snipes, “

(Link to my artist's cover of the songs is found by clicking the first words of the song! )
“Aw, shucks, J.” He lets the piece of wire fall to the ground.
Yet I see there's someone very near,” Tony sings cheerfully as his stomach churns. “
Be any good...” the music reaches a disgustingly self-pitying minor chord, and Tony sucks in a shuddering breath. Clint stares at him, and it warms a little that there's no humor, no glee in Clint's eyes. The archer doesn't find this funny on any fucking level, because he knows how mortifying it feels to be in Tony's shoes. It's small, as comforts go, but Tony will take what he gets.
“I'd go a step further, even,” Tony says and thinks about his friends upstairs. “It almost seems like the more secrets we have, at least in regards to a person or, I don't know, several – the more likely it is that the music starts and makes us spill to that person.”
Phil Coulson is awake. He doesn't look good; his face is pasty and drawn, there are dark rings beneath his eyes and his hair is cropped short. He's wearing a hospital gown, but it's shifted enough that Clint can see the edge of a bandage above the collar, one Clint knows must extend across most of his chest with a similar patch on the back.
“Or that.” Clint picks at the seat of his chair and listens to Phil's calm breathing. He can see Tony stare at him out of the corner of his eye, but knows that the genius isn't really looking. Not at him, anyway. More staring with empty eyes at Clint and wondering where Captain Ameriboy is hiding.
...don't say it if you don't mean it. Don't tell me 'anything' if I can't have it."
Title: Size Him Up, Take Him Down
“Mmm. I just want you,” Steve said as he pulled off of Tony's cock, lapping at the head as he did. He reached for the supplies on the nightstand, finding what he needed before turning his attention back to his lover.
Steve grips the headboard on either side of where Tony's head rests against it, leaning back to stare down at the alpha's face. Tony stares back, mouth slightly open, pleasure written across his features, but there is something else there, too. His dark eyes have an odd look to them and it's enough to catch Steve's attention.
. Tony can feel it, the pull of Steve's mouth, can picture it taking from his body what Steve had put there.
When he climbs that last crest, urged on by the perfect way Steve fucks him, Tony comes in waves, crashing, breaking ones. They sweep him up and out and he distantly registers Steve coming once more as well. Tony twitches and spasms, his body completely out of control. If Steve weren't holding him so tightly, he's pretty sure he would arch right out of his arms.
, on repeat. He thinks no one could blame him if all he manages is a wavering, high pitched moan.
Tony makes a low rumble and Steve looks up the glorious, ruined mess of him, noting the come streaking the arc reactor and the knot that still hasn’t gone down. He’s a mess himself, slick on his own thighs and Tony’s come striping him from navel to chin.
Date night starts with homemade lasagna - Tony’s grandmother’s recipe no less - progressed happily through dessert, and finally into the bedroom where other appetites are begging to be satisfied.
It's not violence when Bucky licks him open for an hour, denying him release even as he revels in the way Tony whimpers and begs. Not when Steve spanks him with his bare hand in between Bucky eating Tony out, turning golden skin red and hot before he takes Tony's mouth after Bruce, thrusting careful but deep while whispering filthy worship and promising more to follow until Bucky finally relents and slides in. Not when the two work him over in his bonds until finally, they take pity and Tony comes, taking all they have to offer with tears of relief standing on his lashes.
“I wanna’ see his face Stevie, I wanna-wanna see him cryin’ cause it's too good.”
Tony looks at him, fork full of salad halfway to his mouth, clearly confused.
In answer, Tony just locks his legs around Steve’s waist, his own hips rising up, thrusting his body on Steve’s cock. Steve pulls back farther, sitting up and trading his grip on Tony’s hands for a grip on his hips. He lifts him, angling him until Tony starts making those high sounds Steve has wanted to hear for weeks. He looks down at his alpha’s cock, baring his own teeth at what he sees. That hadn’t happened even when Steve had watched Tony come on his toy.
Tony rolls his eyes, but there's a gentle smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. He has no problem letting Steve carry him into the bathroom and run them a nice hot bath.
go on darlin’ show Bucky, show ‘im how good you feel…”
“Tony, Tony, can you turn your head? Yeah, good boy, I know-
Right now though, Tony is just enjoying the feeling of being used as he listens to the sounds Steve makes as he fucks Tony’s ass, his groans changing to the timbre that lets Tony know his lover is getting close. Sure enough, a few more thrusts and Steve shoves against him, his cock pulsing and throbbing inside as he comes. Tony can feel it, the way Steve’s cock twitches, the heavy fullness as he pushes as deep as he can go, the fat base of him plugging Tony up with what he has promised is just the first of several more offerings.
All sorts of images flashed through Tony's mind. Straining bodies, bulging muscles, hot, sweaty men pinning each other to the mats in the gym…He might be dating a gorgeous specimen of a human, but he wasn't blind to the appeal of his other teammates.
And Tony felt hot, not from the pleasure of the cock and fingers still in his ass, but from pleasure somewhere even deeper, even more intimate, at Steve's words and Bucky’s murmured agreement, pressed right against his throat. Because Tony wanted to give, he loved to give, and he was so glad his Doms weren't disappointed, weren't unhappy with him. Even though he was the lucky one, having so many, being loved by so many. Did that make him greedy?
Rating: Chapter 3 is Teen and Up
Oh, there’s a thought. He wants Tony on his tongue.
Tony thinks he's sweating, watching drops fall down as his head lolls forward on a new, deeper thrust. Until they stop moving, until Tony looks to see why and Steve is staring at him, mouth open.
"Steve!" Tony wails, feeling come finally starting to drip down, his body no longer able to contain it all. He's still not there, though he is definitely on the way, and now Steve is fucking up into him with purpose angling him just so, fucking him just right. This is Steve on a mission.
His pumping hips must draw Steve's attention, because he's manhandled once more when Steve reaches beneath him, grabbing his cock and repositioning it so it drapes down the back side of the wedge, making any stimulation from his grinding much less.
Tony’s cock twitches and Steve can scent the slick slipping down his own legs. Tony looks half drugged, his eyes fluttering when Steve rubs his fingers on the alpha's prostate, testing and coaxing, cataloging what makes Tony twitch and shiver, what makes him flex and groan. Steve’s usual desire to be filled is completely absent, and suddenly all he can focus on is how Tony will look wrapped around his cock. How his soft little hole will spread wide open for Steve, engulf him, how it will feel that have this newly coveted piece of Tony all for himself.
So, Tony was nervous as well. Of course he was. This was something people who had supposedly cared about Tony had mocked and belittled him for, had told him something was wrong with him for wanting. The fact that Tony had been hurt badly, but was still willing to share this with Steve, even after Steve had watched Tony without his knowledge...
“So gorgeous, damn,” Steve rumbled. “Look at this pretty little hole, sucking up my fingers like that. Like you just can’t wait for my cock. I'm always sure it'll never fit, and I'm always amazed when it does. I love how you get all soft, so soft...stretch out so good for me. I love to watch it gobble up my dick...such a greedy little hole.”
Tony drops his head, hiding his heating face in his pillow until only one eye peeks back.
"Yep," Tony answered, matter of fact, not noticing the danger in the air.  Oblivious, he teased Steve further. "If Sparky hadn't already been taken by Jane and Darcy, who knows what might have happened. The man really seems to know how to handle his…" Tony trailed off, careful to keep his face completely straight before he finished with an innuendo laden "
There's a breath of hot, humid air over Tony's dripping hole and he makes some kind of questioning noise, since words are beyond his reach right now.
"So come on gorgeous, take me. Take me, and give it up to me, too."
So, Steve had not thought anything about
Steve buries his nose in Tony's hair, blinking back tears.
In fact, it feels like he can't think about anything else.
Tony tries to turn around, to look back at where Steve is sliding in and out, lighting up pleasure where they are connected, but they both know Tony won’t be able to come like this, not for a very long time. A slight flicker of trepidation is gathering in Tony’s mind, but before he can get a good look at Steve, one of those hot, huge palms presses down between his shoulders, pinning him in place as Steve picks up the pace and leans to growl hot and possessive in his ear, “Think I don't know you were trying to rile me up? Make me jealous? Well, mission accomplished. Now, I'm gonna...what was it?
At least not until he comes home early one night from a glad-handing mission that gets cut short. He heads home, thoughts full of surprising Tony, but when he gets there his enhanced hearing picks up the unmistakable sounds of passion.
He pulls his fingers away, searching for the bottle of lubricant so he can prepare his cock as well, but he can't see where it went. Tony is whining, making desperate little begging sounds, and Steve doesn’t want to make him wait while he searches for the bottle, so he slips his hand down, gathering plenty of his own slick and uses it instead. He presses the head of his cock to Tony’s entrance, and Tony makes a wounded little noise. Steve looks up worried something is wrong, but Tony is just staring at him, mouth open, fangs on full display.
It still takes him a moment to understand.
Steve was nervous. He and Tony had talked a lot about tonight, and Steve had done quite a lot of his own research so he knew what to expect. The internet was an amazing source of information, or it had been after he had enlisted JARVIS to help filter actual useful information when he had searched ‘topping an alpha’ the first time. Not that he was against pornography, it was just he needed actual information, not the unrealistic versions of sex offered in most things he had dabbled in watching. Besides, none of them had been nearly as hot as what he had seen that night accidentally anyway, so skipping them was no big loss.
"I just thought you might want to try topping. Because I'd be willing. If you wanted to."
It's driving him insane, but he can’t seem to find the right time to bring it up, can’t figure out how to even start.
Tony feels the pattern of the thrusts change, and his breath is driven from him as his lover synch again, this time driving inside together.
Tony felt a sob wrack him, but he whined against Steve's throat and tried to hide there.
A word; it's not nearly enough, but it's all Tony can muster up right now.
“What?” Tony whimpers, trying to gather his thoughts at Steve’s threat. “Steve! What's that mean?!"
He fumbled the lube, hand shaking so bad suddenly that he felt like his body had forgotten how to communicate with his extremities. His his heart was beating like a hammer in his chest.
“Of course you do, gorgeous." Steve kisses him, sloppy and perfect. Pulling back just far enough to watch as Tony cries out and squeezes around him. He's a vision, a perfect partner, and just for Steve. "Look at you, made to take it. Better than any omega I've had, not even in the same galaxy.“
When he goes down to the lab to bring Tony a snack and finds him deeply focused on soldering, his pink tongue licking at his bottom lip, Steve sees his mouth open in an expression of ecstasy, the shine of his lips lit up with blue light.
“Yeah?” Steve purrs, pushing forward steadily, watching Tony tremble when the head of his cock pops in. Nothing could have prepared him for this, and he feels a growl rumble through him, watching in fascination as he sinks further and further into Tony’s ass, his entrance softer from all the work Steve had done and almost sucking him in. It’s nothing like being with an omega, tighter and hotter, and somehow so much more fulfilling with the scent of his alpha in his nose and on his tongue.
"Well I haven't," Steve sighed. "And there's one right there, ready to break through, and I didn't even realize!"
and felt too much and hurt about everything.
"Yes please!" he cheered. "And...and candy?"
good hot chocolate at Christmas," Peter defended, swinging his legs off the side of the bed.
on the naughty list,"
"He did," Tony grinned. "They did too,"
"Papa likes blueberries too," Tony told his son, pulling out his phone to take a photo of the boy covered in berry juice. "Especially cleaning them out of clothes. How about we send him a photo to show him what he's missing?"
"You need to drink or you'll end up feeling worse,"
"Peeeeter," Tony cooed, gentling shaking his son's arm.
"Did you feel kind of...kind of weird when you married pops?"
"Uh huh, I would daddy!"
Tony shook his head, looking over to his husband with a nod.
"Pete, do you think we
"The tackiest present ever," Steve laughed.
"All the way up to space and back again," Tony explained.
Tony tipped the empty cup of coffee up to his lips, hoping there would be more inside. He needed more energy. He was completely drained. The sun was going down and so was Tony's motivation. They had been here all day and had gone on all the rides they could - with Peter, at least -  and the little boy refused to give in to his own exhaustion.
Then the little boy just couldn't control himself. As soon as he started laughing, cookie went
Peter was in a clean diaper, had finished off a bottle, was freshly bathed and dressed in a snuggly onesie. He couldn't have been more ready to go to bed, but the six month old baby just wouldn't calm down. Steve reached out and cupped Peter's face, running his thumb over his cheeks softly. But that only made Peter cry harder, shaking his head.
"I'm lucky my kiddos aren't here, they would be making fun of me more than you guys,"
But from the elevator door to the hall near Peter's room, he had a good three seconds to dart across the room without being seen. He was a quick kid, but just not quick enough.
"No, not today," Tony shook his head. "We're all yours, Pete."
Tony pulled a face, but didn't say a word.
"Peter, giva papa the cookie,"
"I'll only give him one, but it can't control everyone else," Tony defended, picking Peter up to cuddle in his arms. "It's Halloween Steve, let the bunny have some candy,"
"Do you think they'll like it?" Peter asked, nervous.
"Oh!" Steve gasped, almost ready to walk away from his son. "Your inhaler!"
"I don't want glasses," Peter whined. "I'll look funny,"
Screaming turned into sobs which eventually died down to whimpers as Peter began mouthing at the washcloth, soothing his sore little gums. Steve would get some more and store them in the fridge for him, keeping them as cool as possible.
Steve looked to Tony with a shake of his head, grin pulling at his lips.
"Your dad and pops love your handmade stuff, so imagine how much they're gonna love this," she grinned. "This is way better than their stinky old suits, trust me,"
"And then some more," Steve smiled, leaning forward to press a kiss to his cheek.
Peter almost passed out right there and then with excitement.
as bad as we think," Tony cut him off. "I'll get you some ice,"
"I forget how loud I am at times," Thor apologised. "Peter, I'm sorry,"
"Surprise!" Tony shouted, dressed in his vampire costume, fake blood smeared all over his face.
Peter continued licking at his candy, lazily kicking his legs about in Tony's lap as he lounged into his father's chest, not paying attention to the conversation they were all having. He looked over to the other kids at the party, falling asleep in their parent's arms or running around with a new burst of candy-energy.
Peter nodded, pointing back toward the kitchen. Tony lifted the boy into his arms and carried him back, wanting to figure out why the toddler was getting 'dirt' and 'carrot' so muddled up. But, as it turned out, there was logic in Peter's words.
Peter nodded.
Steve didn't think anyone would be able to deny that Peter was Tony's son. The little boy had taken on all of his father's attitude, snark and sass. But it was one of the reasons it was so hard to be mad at him. Peter just loved making people laugh. He loved being goofy and not taking things seriously. And as far as Steve and Tony were concerned, he should be
"I know," Tony laughed. "Do you feel better?"
Each year, Halloween became more exciting with Peter. The little boy
"The crowd's actually not too bad," Bruce admit. "I just keep looking at Peter, it's not so bad then,"
"Alright, I'll meet you guys down in the garage in twenty?"
"I d-don't like it when you guys g-get hurt," Peter hiccuped, sobbing onto Tony's shoulder.
"Papa, is mine," he insisted. "P'ees?"
"Yeah, I did," he nodded. "It's not nerves, exactly, is it? I know what you mean. It's a weird feeling. It's a big thing, marriage. But when you think about it, it's really small. It's just a piece of paper telling you exactly what you both already know. That you love each other and you'll be there for one another for as long as you both can. What's big is the wedding, especially for someone who doesn't like attention,"
"I never agreed to unlimited hot chocolate, buddy," Steve laughed. "Let's go have a cup and take a look at what Santa left for us,"
Tony looked away with a shake of his head as Steve let out a defeated sigh.
"How many times do we tell you not to watch that when we're out there?" Tony sighed. "You don't need to see that, Peter. You'll just get yourself worked up,"
better now,"
Tony gasped.
"You're bleeding papa," he pointed out, turning to Tony. "And so are you!"
"But they weren't grown up yet!"
Really, Captain Sass?"
Peter whined a little, rubbing his eyes and smearing his clown makeup. Tony reached down to pull the boy into his arms, and then Clint took a photo in retaliation. A sleepy clown curled up in the arms of Captain Hook, getting kisses from a fireman.
Peter sighed, leaning back further into the couch.
"But I wanna go one more time!" he whined, turning to Steve. "Papa come?"
prefered it to be, so he had never really entertained the thought of asking for anything like that.
He's just along for the ride. And what a ride it is. The heat from them, the wet sensation of all the lube and come inside, slipping down, slicking him open and soft. It’s almost an overload of sensation, the feeling as they thrust in counterpoint, the sounds of obscene squelching as Tony is fucked by two cocks at the same time, the gasping, the moaning, the sounds escaping them all that seem to be edged right next to somewhere that is only reachable when they are all worked to such levels of desperation.
“Tony, I’m sorry I brought this up this way, I had all these plans for talking to you about what I saw. Apparently I’m not so good with speeches when it comes to stuff like this.”
“Yeah?” Steve asked between more soft kisses, hearing how low his voice had gone. “Hope you didn’t get too ready. I was really looking forward to opening you up myself. You said you’d let me, can I still do it?”
So he pushed at Tony’s middle until he was in the right position, then thrust into him in one hard, smooth stroke, pushing all the way in and then just that little bit further.
“Get Bucky to the exit!” he yelled. “Sam, south, we’ll meet at the car.”
He had forgotten how bright the bathroom in the facility was. They hadn’t been here often in those last weeks. Ever since Ian was born, the two of them had stepped down from Avengers business mostly, only joining the team for meeting or more urgent missions. And that meant they more often than not slept in the Tower.
Tony huffed. “No, I’m just… he’ll be tired soon, and I know Nat knows his night routine, but…”
how he felt, and they only had about half a week before freshman orientation would begin. The only thing he knew for sure was that it was a wonderfully warm feeling to be around Tony. That the cold he had experienced in their weeks of separation was something he could never have again. He desperately wanted warmth again. It was unlike anything else—more powerful than anything else.
"Just… If this happens again, keep some distance, okay?" He wasn't sure how to better keep Tony out of harm's way. "I don't want to hurt you."
He knew this was slowly destroying him, but there was fuck all he could do about it.
Tony opened his mouth to speak, closed it again to think, then said, “I said I wouldn’t, didn’t I?”
After another good few days, however, Tony seemingly dropped his resolution to keep Steve at a safe distance. A little, at least. He seemed more relaxed around him, and at dinner, he even went so far and shared a few stories as well. He told Steve about his past years, about taking over Stark Industries when he was only twenty-one, how he both admired and feared Obadiah and that he still had trouble believing that he could’ve betrayed him like that. He told Steve about how he’d always known that those parties, the many girls, the booze and other narcotics, were slowly wearing him down. That the need to find some kind of meaning for his life had always been there, but he’d never found the purpose to really change his ways.
It was well into the night, and Tony was sitting alone in his new workshop. Pepper had given him a short tour, but it was already way past working hours, so Tony had sent her home. A workshop was a workshop was a workshop, and though this one was distinctively fancier than Bruce’s lab at MIT, he could figure out the details by himself.
Pain swarmed behind Steve’s eyes; pain and bone-deep guilt. He knew it well enough to identify it anywhere. It was then he noticed Steve was trembling.
Tony nodded and pressed a gentle kiss against the intact side of Steve’s face. Then, he made to stand up. He knocked on the door once, not waiting for a reply since he knew there wouldn’t be one, and unlocked it via Extremis. Then, he pushed it open a fraction.
“It goes both ways,” Tony said, irritated now. “Nothing’s fixed. Do you think anything about this was easy for me?”
“So this is where you’re having your sordid affair with Howard’s boy?” Bucky asked after a minute of silence.
That had Steve move his hands away entirely. “
Great. Of course Pepper would’ve told Natasha.
There was an uncomfortable pause. Tony’s body went completely rigid, and he avoided Steve’s gaze. “Sorry, I… I really need to stop saying these things.”
“Oh, Jesus Christ,” Tony groaned, shaking his head, as he pulled the suit back into his bones. “I’m too old for this. And. It. Never. Fucking. Ends.”
Steve, did he? He surely hadn’t
Steve huffed. “Tony weighs… what, 120 pounds? He couldn’t
“Good night, Cap!” Lila intoned, giggling.
Sam tried for a smile as he stepped up to them. There was a thin dribble of blood leaking from his hairline. “At least no one got killed. That’s something to be thankful for.”
“I wouldn’t know.” Tony heaved a great breath. “Look… I got sent back to make sure the team remained a team. That we would be a strong, united force once the Day of Doom arrives. If I tell you all the reasons you and I eventually ended up wanting to kill each other, I’m not sure it’ll all work out. You could start to hate me again.”
Steve broke off a green twig, frayed one end and handed it to him. “Toothbrush. Sorry, no toothpaste, not even salt. That was what we used to do during the war when the rations ran out. Dip a frayed twig in salt to brush our teeth.”
something?”
“Understood,” Steve said, moaning when Tony finally freed him of his pants as well and they made first contact. “See? We’ve already solved one of the problems. How hard can it be?”
Tony smiled. “Yeah.”
The memory brought grins to all of their faces. Steve frowned. “Who’s Dummy?”
The thought was gone before Steve could get a hold on it. The next second, the shooter flung the shield back at him with so much force that it threw him right off his feet. He was pushed backwards, immediately forcing himself to stand up again, but the man was already gone.
Now though, sitting in front of Peggy’s coffin, Steve’s hands wouldn’t stop shaking. Clamming and sweating, fidgeting and fumbling because he was just so darn unsettled. Because there was sad eyes and sniffling and grief everywhere and Steve had always had a habit of taking everything in around him and feeling it all tenfold.
“Together,” Steve confirmed.
Easy, but definitely not without consequences.
"Only if you want."
When he’d reached his goal, Steve groaned when he realized that Tony had already pushed three fingers into himself, rocking back against the movement in steady thrusts.
Steve swallowed hard, and now that he finally faced him—the
Steve lifted Ian from the bathtub and held him as Tony wrapped a towel around his small body. He carried him into their bedroom and laid him on their bed, drying him thoroughly.
“Yeah. Sounds ridiculous if you say it like that.” He smiled and leaned in to push his forehead against Tony’s. “And I suppose I’m completely wrong about that. You’ve always been so linear when it comes to your emotions.”
Steve waited in Tony's room. He noticed that, despite the fact that he was still prone to get a flashback at any minute, the tension was gone. Even if he got one, Tony would be there and it would be alright. Besides, he didn't have much longer to wait, did he?
He realized that Tony had let him go at some point and was now walking in the direction of the stairway. Steve only leaned heavily on the island and stared after him.
Sorry for the long wait!
Steve grinned. “Oh, trust me, I’m

He had always wanted this, to feel someone smile against his lips out of pure joy, and never in his life would he have expected this person to be Tony, but… in this moment he felt blind for not seeing it earlier.
They certainly were past the point of foreplay. While Steve would’ve never admitted as much to Tony, he’d had thought about this about a hundred times already. How it’d be to have sex with Tony.
“You wouldn’t,” Steve said, smiling. “But yeah, I will. I always do. We have to stop Rumlow from wreaking any more havoc. It’s the best lead we’ve had on Rumlow in six months, and he won’t stop. I figure I have the best chance of stopping him. I know how he operates.”
Tony bit his lower lip, followed by a good, hard stare at the floor. “Which one?”
“Tony?” Steve called, whirling around in horror. Tony was nowhere to be seen. And the woman, and the guy with black hair were gone as well. “Tony!”
The stars above them fanned out in waves, brilliant against the complete darkness. It was impossible to know where earth and space began or end. It was one fantastic stretch of dark and light, glowing blues and greens.
“Bring you in,” both Steve and Clint said.
Tony moaned, thrusting up slightly. His hands wrapped around Steve’s arms, pushing him down until he was pressed against the bed sheet, with Tony lying halfway across his body, his hard flesh resting heavy on Steve’s thigh. Tony blazed a hot, moist path down Steve’s arched neck to his chest.

“Because you could,” Steve said softly. “Because you needed to tell somebody. And because we lo—”
[Vision] [chat_server:46958]
“Yes,” Natasha said. Then she leaned in close and brushed her warm lips against his own. And for the first time in decades, he felt something like peace washing over him. He never thought it possible. It felt like Natasha had been with him for years. That generations had passed since the time he thought of her as his adversary.
Steve during his military service wouldn't have hesitated a second to just go for this. Even now a part of him was lamenting his own cowardice, but his
And time travel was tricky business. It was so easy to change what had been—and what would be. If someone travels back in time, anything that someone did would serve to create the future he lives in. Or it may create a different future altogether.
"What? Tony…" he heard himself say, groaning internally at his inability to keep quiet about this. "You're too drunk to walk, how are you going to work like this?" It was a real struggle not to mention underage drinking at this point. Tony's eyes had that watery quality to them which meant he was ready to either pass out or fall asleep and that couldn't be safe for anyone, let alone someone headed to a laboratory.
“Stop,” Tony said softly, squeezing Steve’s hand. There was no true reprimand in his voice–more a gentle coaxing to reassure him that all was well.
Sam blinked as though it was surprising. As though he hadn’t just risked his life at their side, fighting a fight that had nothing to do with him. Sam had definitely earned himself a spot on the team.
“I…” He didn’t know what to say. So he decided to just outright ask. “Do you know?”
That got a laugh from Steve, and he finally nipped at the hot chocolate, nodding. “I’ll try to keep my hands to myself.”
That brought a small smile to her lips. “Yes, I can imagine.”
know I can’t choose for whom I—”
More secrets, it seemed.
“Yeah,” Tony confirmed, as if it was nothing, then pressed a button on the glasses. He walked into the middle of the room, and a second later, there was a… couch, and a table, and a piano. Silhouettes turned to life, a whole room appeared next, the style slightly outdated but everything seemed to be high quality and… weirdly familiar.
Undoubtedly, all roads led to Hopkinsville that day. Steve had known the eclipse hype had become really big in those last weeks. The eclipse-sunglasses had been sold-out more times than he could count, there had been numerous specials on TV, interviews, discussions, t-shirts, books—the eclipse had been everywhere.
The bulb’s leaves were now mostly brown, only a few speckles of green remaining. It didn’t matter. Worst thing that could happen was that it didn’t have an effect on him at all. Or so Tony kept repeating to himself.
The other part, however, was already hopping up and down excitedly, not understanding his reservations in the slightest.
Steve blinked. Tony was singing, low and quiet. Something from the eighties from the sound of it.
Steve snorted. He hadn’t exactly expected Tony to go through with it, but Tony was almost as bad as Steve when it came to losing a game. With a last sigh, Tony pushed down his jeans, mindful not to reveal too much.
“Rhodey, he’s… well, the best friend I’ve had in as many years.” Tony took a long sip of wine. “We studied together, and he’s worked for the company for some time before he made a career of his own in the military. He’s eager to make your acquaintance. Everyone is.”
That, Tony realized, might just be the most peaceful conversation they’d had since… well, quite frankly, since they’d met.
Steve shook his head. “You know we can’t do that.”
“It is. Definitely is. It’s just… I must’ve morning breath.”
Tony left Steve’s cock with a parting kiss, and was in his arms the next second, their mouths once more ravaging each other. Steve’s tongue had a mind to conquer, and Tony was hopeless to offer anything but complete surrender.
Steve nodded. “Exactly. I’ll take the South carrier myself, Thor and Clint will take of the other two together.”
It took Bruce and Tony another good hour to get preparations on the way. In the meantime, Thor had finally returned to the tower. The troubled look on his face was gone, replaced by determination. And against all of Steve’s expectations, Thor seemed to agree with Tony’s plan. When he had looked down at the cradle, something close to relief had washed over his face.
And then...Well, Steve starts fucking him for real. Hard grinds that bottom out and light up every nerve in Tony's stretched rim. And for Tony, it's like an awakening is happening, a whole new side of Steve that he's never seen is bursting into life right here and now, the image burning into him, centered by streaks of light like the rays of dawn climbing the horizon.
The sounds are nothing short of obscene, and Tony prickles and burns with that odd shame, but lights with livewires of tender pleasure at the same time.
Behind him, Steve is going to town, completely chasing his own orgasm without any regard to Tony, and Tony feels himself going to a place he never expected to go again. And it’s not like he has missed it, this soft, fuzzy space where he can let go and just be, because Steve and Tony’s sex life is great, it is in fact excellent. It’s just that until now, Tony had no idea Steve would be interested in this kind of play at all.
“Yeah, that’s right,” Steve croons, pushing in as deep as he can, giving Tony what he wanted, what he begged for. “Come on, sweetheart, give your Omega that pretty knot, I want it. Want to watch you pop that beautiful knot while I fuck you like you need.”
surprising is the realization the device is currently fucking a large toy into Tony's ass.
“Honey, you’re not going to do that,” Tony said, voice so full of confidence it humbled Steve. With a little smile he added, “I’ll bet you did so much reconnaissance, you probably know more about me bottoming than I do.”
“Hmm?” the alpha hums.
Oh god, he couldn’t even get the lube open.
Ship/Main Pairing: Steve Rogers/Tony Stark
"What?" Steve finally turned his full attention on Tony. "No. It's not a euphemism. Sam and Buck are like my brothers. And Thor's not really my type if you know what I mean."
The rhythm is faster now, more insistent, and Tony can only sob and shiver as sensation builds past the point he thought was able. Every drag against his rim sends fire racing to his cock, and every thrust is aimed right where he needs it, right where he wants it.
It's not violence when Bruce grips Tony's hair. When the tangled curls are wrapped around his fingers tight enough to pull a few strands free as he guides his cock into the wet, open, and eager mouth currently whining in need.
Tony calls after him when he spots him in SHIELD’s hallway, running to catch up to him, and Steve hears how Tony begged before he came, invoking Steve's name, unaware Steve was watching.
A while later Steve throbs within him again, "Oh fuck, sweetheart. Taking it so good."
So sue him. You would lose anyway. All he would need to do was line up the Avengers and present them to the judge.
And then…
He's gasping and trembling, whining high pitched and So. Fucking. Desperate.
Tony wondered.
And it was all his, all for him. His to have, his to take. Something Tony had stopped asking anyone for probably a decade ago.
Steve invites Tony over for dinner for their third date. Tony gets more proof that Steve did indeed deserve another chance.
"Steve!" he whines, only to be ignored. But when he feels Steve slip down the waist of his pants to pull out his own hard cock, Tony changes his mind and instead drops his head back down as Steve slowly works his way inside, adding more lube as he goes.
Collaborator Name: Romancebyfaye
Tony mumbles something that sounds suspiciously like, “Man with the plan my ass.”
“Shh, baby, shh. We got you,” Bucky says, breathless against Tony skin as his arms hold Tony tightly to Bucky’s chest, his mouth sucking bruises into his shoulder as Steve is shifting beneath them, wriggling a little as he's also telling Tony, “I know what you need sweetheart, I know. Easy, easy, holy
His excellent memory whispers in Tony’s voice, “Do you ever want me to
Steve felt himself turning pink, and not in the sexy way. “Sorry,” he muttered, “I’m just scared I’ll fuck this up.”
Tony whimpers, feeling too open, too empty, “please, I-I need-”
"I should be thanking you," Steve says. And that's not enough, not near enough to encompass what Tony has given him. "For your trust in me, to let me share this part of you."
him. And suddenly, there is a tiny grain of doubt about Tony letting Steve do this to him while Steve isn't fully sober. Those doubts, no matter how tiny, are erased when Steve finally looks up to meet Tony’s eyes, the shock and worry written so clearly there Tony knows immediately that only one word would stop this whole wild night.
“Fuck, Steve. Yeah, yeah, whatever you want.”
Tony only manages a few garble consonants that make no sense, completely gobsmacked at the turn the evening is taken. Gobsmacked, but totally on board. Steve should drink more.
Tony thought nothing of it, not until Steve wandered back out a bit later wearing only soft sleep pants and a flush that was definitely from something more than a steamy shower. Tony hid his grin.
Steve tilts his head to the side, confused. They have done that quite a lot, so he's not sure why Tony is acting so strangely about it right now.
Card Number: 3092
He quickly, but quietly, leaves the penthouse, heading to the gym to get some space and work off the anxious energy pouring in his veins.
He smiles at them both, still a little floaty, but not so much that he can't put a husky tone in his voice when he says, “We are so doing that again.”
Card Number: 3092
It's quite funny for some reason and Tony starts to giggle. Steve and Bucky don't mind, they never do, and Bucky absolutely beams at him before he gently scoops him into his lap as Steve brings over a tray absolutely packed with food.
It’s the surprise of it that really caused Tony to cry out, and the same which has him whipping his head around to stare at Steve, still buried inside him.
Steve can't stop watching the way Tony's ass opens up around his fingers, how he can feel the pulse of him here, in this delicate, secret place. And sure, there's nothing wrong with an alpha wanting this, but it still feels electric in his skin. Like some guarded thing has been offered up just to him.
Tony swims in the fluffy molten feelings churning within him, thinking
Tony takes a careful bite of his salad, watching Steve with a bewildered expression.
, slow and heavy. His cock ached in the best way, pulsing dollops of clear fluid with each perfect thrust of Bucky’s thick cock, the fingers still there, still inside, holding Tony open and vulnerable in the best way possible.
Tony blinks up at them, but words are still far off, so he smiles and nods moving to sit up. It seems his arms are still far off, too, because they flail a bit, but do nothing to propel him forward.
Time gets fuzzy for a bit, and by the time Steve comes back, he realizes he’s squashed Tony into the mattress again. He tries to shift up, but Tony is clinging like a limpet.
His alpha is bad about getting something in his head and torturing himself with it until he spills out what's really bothering him. Because of this tendency, Steve has to be careful that Tony isn't just going along with whatever in an effort to make the people he loves happy. They've had a few conversations about it since they started dating several months ago and it's still something they need to work on. Even so, Steve loves how generous his alpha is when he knows Tony is offering this to him, even through his own discomfort.
He rubs and teases, pressing in one slick fingertip and then the other, alternating and nudging just a little deeper each time he switches. Tony is making encouraging noises, one hand digging into the sheets, and the other gripping right above Steve's knee.

“Well, I was going to see about cleaning us up, but you’ll have to let me go for that.”
So this is another piece in this Dom/Sub AU. It's not in any particular order or anything, and this time just happens to be Stuckony. Because I felt like writing Stuckony porn...so...you're welcome.
Next thing Tony knows, slick fingers are parting his cheeks, slipping over his opening. Is that what Steve had been doing in his nightstand? He moans as Steve presses one finger in all the way, one big hand holding his cheeks apart as he sets about stretching  Tony open.
"Please? Tony? Can I have this too?"
good, but there's an edge of something new tonight, something that Tony didn’t think Steve would ever really want, and he’s praying it’s not just because Steve is a bit intoxicated. Tony feels heavy and hot, a little fuzzy, as his lover carves out a place for himself inside Tony’s body, still spewing filth as he settles in.
Tony's not sure what Steve's asking, not really, not from this heavenly place Steve has lifted him up to, so he just digs deep enough to find something to give back to Steve.
He can’t resist pulling Tony into his lap in the water once they are all clean, rutting against his ass and massaging and squeezing his knot, teasing at his sensitive nipples until Tony comes again, Steve following shortly after. After another quick rinse to clean off the cleaning off, Steve carries Tony to bed.
“Can I Tony? I want to feel you,” Steve whispered in between kisses. Tony's arms went around him, fingers tangling in his hair as Steve nipped lower, sucking and tugging on his hardening nipples until Tony whimpered, kissing around the casing of the reactor as he moved between them, tugging slightly with his teeth to hear the way his alpha's breath hitched.
“Whrrugonn,” his lover grumbles.
Then Steve is there, tracing a thumb over Tony's brow as he stares down at him in wonder. “How do you feel? Think you can eat something for us, sweetheart?”
greedy, not for accepting us all, for giving us all the best thing ever.”
Maybe he can surprise Tony in a different way than he was originally planning. Steve slips through the rooms silently, approaching the slightly ajar bedroom door where he draws up short. For a moment he's not sure exactly what he's seeing.
But it's nothing to the rapturous look of agreement on their faces when, in a completely innocent tone, Tony says, “Maybe next time we can invite the others to watch.”
Steve has never heard Tony make those sounds.
- but it's certainly not unwelcome. Neither is the way Steve grinds his growing erection against Tony's ass before he shifts back and strips off Tony's pants, underwear, and socks in one swoop, following up by removing Tony's tank top with just as much efficiency.
He pulls Bucky and Steve each in for a long kiss, the faint taste of fruit and chocolate shared between them.
Sure, it's unexpected - and Tony's heart gives a few frenzied

!” He leans forward and presses the palm of his hand against Tony's cheek, which is how Tony notices that his own mouth's slack-jawed. “
They both turn their heads in his direction, and Thor sighs. Bruce just shifts the grip on his tea cup and looks wistful. He's not even wearing his glasses, and for some reason, that's the weirdest part of this morning so far.
Thor lumbers over to cup Bruce's jaw, leaning down to press their lips together. Chaste, for him. Gentle, like Bruce is as fragile as he looks. “I am sure we shall be fierce warriors still, even whilst carolling.” His eyes twinkle with mirth.
“Right. Anyone heard from HQ yet?” Tony asks, and the others shake their heads.
” Clint sings, and curses the fact that this is yet another secret that Loki's making him spill; the fear he can quash down but not put out entirely, “
” Fury and the five agents sing in strong, clear voices louder than their background trumpets, “
“I'm pretty certain it wouldn't be,” Bruce says, but he can't quite stop smiling at the mental image of the Other Guy in a white suit and top hat, gargling 'Singin' In the Rain'. A quiet, but insistent rumble in the back of his mind lets him know that the Other Guy doesn't appreciate that thought at all. Bruce chuckles.
Steve frowns.
“Hm?”
Which was just not on.
“Has anyone tried to get into my workshop?”
“Aye,” Thor says, and looks torn between relief and fury. Natasha nods jerkily, her mouth a pinched line.
Phil pulls on a robe; doesn't bother to pull on proper clothes. It's past four in the morning, which is Tony's prime-time for new, ridiculous inventions. He's become better at sleeping after Steve began spending the nights in his apartment, but Phil knows Tony still spends most nights tinkering in his workshop.
Clint swallows convulsively, and forces his body to stay still and not lean away. He won't give the bastard the satisfaction. In the privacy of his mind, Clint wonders almost desperately whether Loki knows that Phil is alive or not.
” And then the guitar
” Bruce acquiesces.
And an arm sliding around his waist and a second hand on his shoulder, holding him and Tony can't breathe, can't stay upright, can't open his eyes, can't

about it.
” Phil mumbles to his own face in the rear view mirror.
“You believe my hair is luscious?” Thor asks, smiling, but Tony just goes down to his workshop with a bottle of cognac under his arm.
“Love song,” Clint says and looks sour. “For my bow.” He glares when Tony starts laughing. “What about you, Tasha?”
“I'm fine, just need some rocket fuel,” Clint says.
“Get off me, you wretched-” Loki snarls, and then Hulk's pounding him down into the floor again, growling.
to sing and dance, to reveal our secrets to each other, but we do.” Steve looks down at his hands, curls them, before they relax again.
“I death-tap-danced,” Tony says. “In front of the entire team.”
“We got tired of waiting and singing, sir,” Steve says, letting the bite in his tone show. He's just let a perfectly good – if a little hurtful and unhealthy – friendship go down the drain, and he'd like to find Loki and make him pay
“Singing,” Clint had gritted out, and she'd only nodded at that.
Natasha purses her lips.
“Foul play, then?” He's a little worried, but not too much – it's Clint, after all. Even without superpowers, the archer is one of the most capable and scary guys Tony knows. Still, it's not like they'll leave him to his own devices. “Rally up the team?”
'Cause no one will stay
” he continues, just as Clint sings “
Tony takes another deep breath, torn between second-hand guilt for JARVIS (who seems to have existential issues now, poor guy), his own guilt for Cap (because that's not going anywhere any time soon), and good old-fashioned gratitude in the knowledge that his AI loves him as much as he does. Even if JARVIS can't help it, Tony being his creator and all... it still warms him to the bone, that JARVIS wishes he could be here for Tony in a more corporeal fashion.
” Steve sings, bouncing to his feet, before he sees Bruce's lips purse and Thor's face fall. Only then does he falter and add, still with the music, “
“I sang a glorious ode to Anthony's toaster machine and Bruce's posterior!” Thor says. Bruce hides his face.
So Tony lived with the Avengers and participated in all the team-building exercises without too much nagging. He played Fury's lapdog and saved the world a few times, with and without back-up. He poked fun at Bruce and taught the Big Guy how to high-five someone without knocking them senseless; he tried (and failed) to pick up Mjølnir; he started a prank war with Clint; he didn't try to ask Natasha out a single time
“We're not taking Tony with us?” Bruce asks, brows furrowed with worry.
” and he displays one of them to Natasha now, who indulges him with a smile. Her eyes are worried, though, and she folds her arms and listens. Clint knows what's coming; knows what secret he's spilling, but he can't help the name from crossing his lips and when he does, he closes his eyes so he can't see his best friend's expression.
” Tony sings, even his voice trembling with fatigue now, and he keeps messing up his steps, stumbling over his feet, barely keeping upright, and still fucking

, but he still recognizes the smell of Old Spice and leather and slightly bitter sweat and
“So I can't help wondering,” Clint says, going for nonchalant even though he's strapped to a chair that he can't worm his way out of and Loki's giving him the mind-reading look again. “I mean, dancing and singing? Cute and a first, at least for me, so points for originality. But it seems a little lame for you. Or did you just decide to downgrade? Plan A, destroy the human population with an alien army; Plan B, create your own Disney movie?”
” JARVIS sings. “
“If you wanna smother me with a pillow, Barton, I'm not gonna call for a nurse,” Tony continues, his voice a low mutter now. Against the pallid shade of his face, his reddening cheeks are even more pronounced, and Clint chuckles.
“As I thought,” Loki says, almost soft, and shifts his attention to the team. Tony wants to shoot forward and blast the demi-god with his propulsors, but he can't. He just – can't move. There's no music, but it's still there, the curse, tapping into his energy reserve and using it against him, using it to keep Tony still. Looking to his side, Tony recognizes the same frustrated, constipated look on the faces of his team mates.
“... Yeah. Maybe.”
” Steve murmurs and Tony knows the team is here, Loki's here, but it still feels like it's just the two of them; just Tony slumped against Steve's unyielding, warm frame, feeling steady breathing against him and trying to draw in air himself.
Of course, there was that whole thing between Cap and him, but that wasn't annoying as much as it was... sexually frustrating? Tony had stayed up many nights discussing this dilemma with his right hand; namely, what to do with the naturally-bottle-blonde, honka-dory 80-something-year old superhero he had such a massive, crumpling crush on.
A low whir, and DUM-E's coming over, peering up at him and moving his robot arm in a gesture that somehow, Tony knows means
… Yeah. Clint doesn't have a ready answer for that one. They lapse into an uneasy silence, two heart monitors beeping out of sync and Clint watching his handler's chest fall and rise.
And Tony hugs DUM-E close, pathetically grateful that his kid can't sing back at him, at least, and DUM-E clings right back and provides back-up bleeps while Tony's greatest creation sings to him.
Everyone stares. Even the music halts. Thor's smile cracks into an almost petulant mask, and he looks over at Bruce for back-up.
” Bruce points out, and the whole song ends on a strangely... wistful note.
” Loki sings, his smile broadening as the music crawls to a slow crescendo. Clint doesn't answer.
), made with the virgin jokes, with the leers, made with the shit-eating grins and borderline-asshole comments there was nothing borderline about at all.
Steve stares at JARVIS again. JARVIS calmly looks back. “He looks... you look amazing, Jarv,” he says after a moment and smiles uncertainly.
Chapter warnings: There are some non-consensual vibes going on here between Clint and his captor, although nothing explicitly sexual.
had to sing 'I love you' before you realised that your sad little crush on him isn't unrequited?” Clint's sniping is harsher than he originally intended.
And I'm in need of a well-trained assistant
Loki's lips curl into a semblance of a smile, though his eyes flash coldly.
“We're here, gentlemen,” Natasha says, and even she sounds winded.
“You know, J,” Tony says. “I don't know about the body-and-face parts, although I can fix you up with a body, buddy, don't even worry about that – but far as we know, only humans are affected by this goddamn spell. So that's... that's something, I think. Don't you?”
. The wound immediately seals up and heals, as if it were never there in the first place.
“Don't underestimate him, Romanoff,” Coulson warns.
” he sings, and can see Phil's eyes light up in understanding. “
Clint doesn't know when exactly this conversation turned into Projection Lane, but the urge to grab Phil's hand is stronger than ever. He swallows and pointedly folds his arms across his chest. “He still loves you, though.”
“If you beg my pardon, Sir,” JARVIS says, “but while I find Captain Rogers a perfectly pleasant man, he is not my creator. You are.”
Steve's eyes go wide. “
Clint huffs. “We're not on the clock, Phil. Unless you want me to call you sir?”
that he's barely half-way through the song.
“Come on, guys,” Steve sighs and turns around. “Let's go find Agent Coulson.”
“I am serious. Since when am I not serious?” Tony asks, because he's serious. He's totally serious. Seriously. “I'm always serious.”
“You look great, J,” Tony murmurs, and his greatest creation smiles. He seems startled that he does – two fingers come up to touch the metal lips, and his face looks strange for a moment as JARVIS goes through the array of human grimaces he knows in the span of seconds. Then he settles on a smile again.
“JARVIS, close off the workshop.”
She doesn't answer.
stare at her boobs or ass; he made fun of Cap. Because really, what else could he do with the super-soldier? They were from two different worlds, almost-literally, and while Steve seemed to settle into the 21st century just fine, he was still so...
“As long as the Other Guy doesn't start crooning,” Bruce smiles back. “No,” he adds when Thor looks intrigued by that suggestion. “Believe me. None of us want that.”
“You know I don't come up here to meet people, Nat. Why are you here?”
“That bad, huh?” Tony stands by the espresso machine as it works. “Did you sing?”
.” And he finally pushes off, finally backs away, and sings his refrain again, but Tony's barely listening anymore. He's half-hard, to his own mortification, from Steve's words – and just about ready to hurl at the real meaning of them, at the misery exuding from the kid.
“HULK NO SING,” Hulk growls and pounds his fist against the floor again for emphasis, the whole place rattling with the force of it. Phil and the team stumble at the mini-earthquake. “HULK HATE SINGING.”
,” Natasha says, in the exact same way she talks about torture, and the pieces fly together in Clint's mind to make a terrible picture.
“You think he's the one behind this?” Fury says, but doesn't sound surprised. Then again, Fury never does.
“Aye, it is,” Thor says with a nod, “but I do not appreciate being made to expose my innermost doubts in a manner that clearly hurts the one I love.” He glances at Bruce with a dejected look.
“No,” Steve says. “But SHIELD might.”
“My friends!” Loki greets them when they barge inside, a wide grin splitting his face. There's nothing in his tone that suggests he's anything but delighted to see them, which Tony knows is probably the worst reaction they could have hoped for.
, she doesn't say, and Tony nods.
Thor's moving more fluently than Tony thought he could, a complicated set of dance movements that must be Asgardian. Tony notices Loki watching his brother with a faint look of derisiveness. Bruce and Steve are dancing together, of all things: a jazzy waltz, which, Tony doesn't even know how that works, but it does. Steve even smiles, twirling Bruce, and though Tony knows it's all the curse and the music – confusing, fast-paced, neither crescendoing nor rescinding – it still makes his stomach tumble in a way that's both painful and soothing, seeing Steve smile like that.
“I feel like shit,” Clint mutters and steals one of Tony's expensive bottles of vodka. He shares it with Natasha, who nods with him. The rest of them fall into disturbed, increasingly drunken silence after that – even Thor.
That I would come to be your closest friend
~*~*~*~*~
,” and man, is that the creepiest fucking sentence so far, “
.” He's inching closer, still dancing with far more grace than Clint would have thought, even though the guy's smooth as glass when he moves anyway. (
A dramatic sigh answers him.
Beneath him, Tony moved, his eyes now full of worry instead of his own nerves. Calloused, capable hands covered Steve’s own as Tony reached for him.
“Absolutely. I’m already yours anyways.”
"I love you like that, too. You  don't have to be afraid, sweetheart."
Square Filled: R5 "Cheesy"
Steve makes a punched, wounded sort of noise before he folds down over Tony, his body a weight and a cover as he slips his arms around his smaller lover.
“That's it,” Steve continued, smiling up at him as he gently wiped at Tony's cheeks. “So good, aren't you sweetheart? So good for us, letting us have you like this. You don't even know how much we wanted, how much we dreamed about this. Me and Buck, imagining our Sub, gorgeous and gracious, who’d let us have them like this, who’d give themselves so perfect like this.”
, Tony. I
He laughs when he's pushed back into the now clean bed, his beautiful Doms showering him with kisses and snuggles as they show him how much they agree.
Steve stands as well, hands out in placation, “I’m sorry, sweetheart, it was an accident! I just didn’t know how to tell you. I just wanted to talk to you about it-”
The back of his hand was pressed to his mouth, head canted slightly to the side, eyes shining and half lidded. His legs were splayed wide around Steve's hips, showing off the long lines of his body. Steve took a moment just to look at him, letting his gaze wander from the soft waves that he loved to run his fingers through, down over Tony’s face, where he looked back, uncharacteristically shy. His gaze wandered over his chest, where scars surrounded the marvel that protected Tony’s heart, past the gentle ripple of abs, to follow the trail of dark hair past his belly button, where his cock sat plump and full, surrounded by neatly trimmed curls.
"Hey, your uncle Bruce wears glasses all the time," Steve pointed out. "And isn't he the smartest guy you know?"
Peter rushed over, throwing himself into Steve's embrace and burying into his chest. He didn't really like the feeling of the Captain America suit beneath his hands. It never felt like real Papa hugs. It made him even sadder this time to feel it torn in spots and see the patches of red soaking through. Peter reached his hands out to Tony next, letting Steve lift him and place him in his husband's lap.
"Fine!" Steve threw his hands up. "But your dad's right, we're not sending you a bar of soap or socks if you forget them. You gotta learn to pack for yourself,"
Steve continued staring at his son, standing up to move just in front of him.

"They're growing?"
"See? I
"I love MJ," Peter continued. "I want this. I
But as he approached, he could see Peter's face twisted in disgust and pain.
Tony lifted Peter, letting Thor reach down and take him into his arms. The toddler immediately put his hands up to Thor's face, getting his full attention.
"Costume's hanging up in the bathroom," Steve reminded. "We're going to gather up the others. Pete wants to show them his costume before we get there,"
Peter pouted, rubbing his eyes again.
liked whiskey?"
Steve and Tony looked to their son, growing older every day, and felt a lump rising in their throats. Peter was growing, that was a good thing. Every parent wanted their child to grow up and be happy and have a good life. But they still saw their baby.
Steve watched on, full of love.
Steve raised his eyebrows, taking a moment before nodding. He wished Tony lucky getting into his costume - hair and makeup - in twenty minutes, and then they were off.
"Hey! I see you little man!" Steve called out, looking at the curly mess of hair on the other side of the kitchen bench. "I remember saying
"He's back out like a light," Tony smiled. "Just like his papa should be,"

"Pete, you're gonna fall over!"
Their baby who was tall and lanky and snarky and smart and thoughtful and selfless and so, so loving.
It was no party. But it was something, and Peter
Tony smiled down at him, letting himself soak in the added warmth. With the television muted, Tony fell asleep listening to the sound of bells and carols echoing from the streets below. There was no other way he wanted to spend this day, and he knew that every Christmas from now on would be spent
