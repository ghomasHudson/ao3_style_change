"Sherlock. I am serious. So please be serious too. Stop playing. Life isn't a game. That's just a myth for stupid people – ordinary people. But you know better. You've seen it, haven't you? The void. A game has rules; there may be partners, opponents; stakes; a goal to achieve in order to win. But that isn't life. You can make it look like that, of course. Many people enjoy living their lives like games. Society helps you a lot with it. It isn't so bad, I suppose. But us... You, Moriarty... We'd get bored.
The detective blinked, and to dispel the embarrassment John's gaze was causing him, turned and lay flat on his stomach on the sheet and duvet.
, John amended, a smile spreading on his face as he caressed the smooth skin of his lover's cheek, invisible under the abounding black curls. Sherlock shivered and almost recoiled. John snuggled up closer and slipped a hand behind his head, cupping the nape of his neck, delicately massaging the base of his scalp while his thumb stroked his ear and played with the earlobe in a tender, soothing way.
He took the gem out of his pocket and instead of showing it to Sherlock, he put it on the table so the tiger would be lured back closer to him to look at it. Sherlock did come back, and John went back to petting him casually, a wide smile spreading on his face when Sherlock, too engrossed in studying the gem, did not rebuff him. John was ridiculously happy, obviously a silly response when he should have been annoyed with his infuriating flatmate who'd decided to turn into a bloody tiger on Christmas day and ruin his romantic weekend in the countryside. Still, all he felt was an immense sense of relief and a great deal of fondness.
to someone who had become his utmost weakness, one his nemesis certainly didn't have, and never would. He had beaten Sherlock at his own game,
They sat, and Irene spent the next hour doing her report. It was just like Sherlock had guessed - "I don't guess," he pointed out grumpily, and Irene was so happy to see some of the old Sherlock back she almost kissed him on the spot.
"You were strapped to a wheel and Moriarty whipped you. Repeatedly. He strangled you with the whip, too, until you wheezed. Then he cut the skin of your torso to shreds with a scalpel."
When he heard the first beat, his face broke into a childlike smile. Closing his eyes, he allowed sleep to come and get him, lulled and sheltered by the regular beating of John's heart.
"Leave it. I'm too angry with you right now to discuss things properly. We'll talk when I come back."
Sherlock deepened the kiss. His luscious lips were soft at first but then turned gluttonous and utterly began to devour him. John moaned as they moved on to his cheek, his chin and his throat, swabbing, nibbling,
"Are you saying..." You swallow, feeling a terrible sense of dread filling your chest. And hatred, too. "Are you saying Moriarty is still alive?"
He bent to the side, took the collar and the leash under Sherlock's puzzled gaze, and put them on himself.

"Don't be, dear. You've had a difficult day yesterday, and I'm afraid you haven't seen the end of it yet. How is Sherlock?"
He looked truly worried, and John thought he must love his wife dearly; but Sherlock did not seem to care much, for he replied coldly:
. He has felt guilt, too, and still does, although he knows that if Sherlock wanted to hide something from him, really hide it, there was no way he'd be able to see through him. Not that he'd be able to test this theory, now.
that was boosting his brain and expanding his mind palace in ways he would never have thought of alone, was now making his body quiver with unrestrainable anticipation.
At first, he told himself off and resisted the urge to go and check on his partner. He had put his own clothes back on after the shower, so roaming around the hospital wearing that horrible gown wasn't the issue: but he did not want John to think that he could panick so easily, even though almost a week had passed since the traumatizing event. Admittedly, John, being a doctor and having served in the army, was well aware that trauma did not last just one week. Sherlock, however, wanted to do nothing that could remind his friend of what he himself considered to be an unbearably stupid frailty, and so waited a good twenty minutes before finally snapping and leaving his room to look for his flatmate.
John scoffed and walked to Sherlock's bedroom instead. The consulting detective smiled. Perhaps it was a good sign if John chose the bed over the sofa without any incentive. Then again, he seemed to have been rather traumatized by the whole dropping-on-the-floor-covering-himself-with-a-pill ow experience.
God, I can't believe the guy actually dared hit on me when he... Never mind. You probably don't need to know that. I should cross it out.
"I suppose this is a yes, then. If not, you would have been theatrically hissing and snarling and mewling or whatever you do to throw a tantrum when you want to deny something."
OK, so he hadn't done the grocery shopping himself, he'd asked Mrs. Hudson as she was on her way to the supermarket but he was the one who had written a shopping list just for John's sake. He'd done research too, and had even contacted zoos to be certain. Even if he would never admit it, he'd had the scare of his life when he'd found the poor cat throwing up in the bathroom. Admittedly, John as a man was exposed to mad consulting criminals, and so to a certain amount of risks; but one couldn't say the ex-soldier was weak or fragile. As a manul, however, it was quite different. He was just a cat. A big, stout, fluffy cat, but a cat nonetheless. Sherlock found it adorable, and he couldn't explain why: he certainly wasn't one to ooh and aah over pets – or anything else at all that could be considered within the realm of "cute".
Suddenly standing up, he signified to the weird guy that he wanted to pass to go to the toilets, thrusting his chin forward contemptuously. The man blinked, looked up at him, and smiled. Then he closed his eyes and leant back in his seat as if he were in the deepest slumber.
"I'll have an expert look at it," the D.I. said. "Maybe the murderer only imitated his handwriting."
"Turn back, turn back..." John was murmuring like a mantra, oblivious to his friend's depressing thoughts. "God, why isn't it working? Turn back,
She wasn't sure whether he or Moran was leading the game and watching the other dance. She wasn't even sure any of them had the upper hand in the matter. To her, they both looked like pawns, graceful, clever little pawns – but pawns nonetheless. It was funny how Moriarty had managed to turn all these geniuses, or at least smart men in the case of Moran, into lost, struggling puppets. By dying, he had wrecked havoc, and it was as if Sherlock, the Iceman, and Moran were mere billiard balls that he had sent flying all over the place after their collision. There was something, something that escaped them all. They all had power to some extent, they all had their say in the way this great play was enfolding. Yet it seemed none of them could completely control the situation. Each of them missed something, something crucial: and in the end, even Sherlock, who was the one at the very heart of this mad game between the three men had clearly no idea how or when he was going to be tried.
"You shouldn't meddle with things you do not quite grasp, Miss Hooper. Sherlock would be devastated if something were to happen to you while he was away."
A hand came to rest on the crook of his back, another on his right buttock. Resting there, with the assurance of an owner.
Only silence answered. In the darkness Moran could not see Sherlock's face, but had he seen it still it would have been unreadable. Moran just didn't realize that in his sentence, there were too many words Sherlock just could no longer understand. They simply did not make sense. Not applied to his situation. Never applied to him.
cheating on you, moron! And we did not kill her, rather we were almost killed trying to find out who her murderer was!"
"This was painted long before the current legislations about tiger hunting, of course. But it is quite a work of art, isn't it?"
He was cut off as the chunky cat started rubbing its forehead gingerly on Sherlock's leg, so softly he only sensed the fur stroking him through the fabric.
"I'm not going anywhere," John replies soothingly, rubbing his thumb against Sherlock's palm. Sherlock shivers. He meant
It's funny, the first time you met him, he didn't strike you as especially gentle. He didn't strike you as especially kind. You found him honest and a little father-like in the way he handled Sherlock, but not in a bad way. Not in a patronizing way. Still, he turned out to be a much greater friend than you ever imagined.
"...Right. Look, it doesn't matter! I'm sure she wasn't even serious about it. You met in a gay bar, y'know? She was never looking for a bloke to begin with! Really, I'm telling you, she was just joking around trying to get rid of you."
Sherlock groaned and stopped picking at the contents of his plate. He took a reluctant mouthful, then another.
that would allow him to jump on the handle and open the door. But there was nothing in the room to make this plan even remotely feasible.
"The power over life and death you talked about the other time..." he began. Sebastian's eyes widened at the softness of his tone. He sounded like a child. "...how did you put it, again? 'That edge where you stand and know that with one little gesture you will put an absolute, irreversible end to everything that a person once was and is and could be'... Do you think that John knows this feeling too?"
When John had woken this morning, he'd known something was wrong straight away. For one, his pillow didn't feel right. It seemed excessively large, and, on second thought, so did his bed. Then there was the fact that he felt like he was wearing a night gown, or might have been wrapped in a sleeping bag, perhaps. Finally he saw a paw on the white sheet before him, and groaned in desperation.
He sighed. It had been the first time he faced Sherlock since his impromptu confession. Waking up as a manul the previous day had been a pain, but at least it had spared him the awkward exchange that had just happened in the bedroom.
She got up and came back with a blue gem. John's eyes widened. It truly did look precious and snapped him out of his musing about Sherlock... though not for long.
Warmth. The hand on the nape of your neck is so warm. Holding you. Preventing you from falling. It's just a hand. It shouldn't really matter.
It was a little arduous typing this way at first, but John was starting to get it and was faster than his flatmate. He did, however, greatly enjoy the feeling of the huge paws guiding him along the keys, and for once he felt
"Of course not! Shall we meet down here in an hour then? Will that be enough for you to have breakfast and to get prepared?" she eyed Sherlock's skin tight lilac shirt and John almost hit his head on the table.
Sherlock didn't have time to gasp, but in his surprise, he almost pushed John back. Then he thought it really would be a pity, and instead he let the other kiss him, sighing in contentment as they parted. Kissing wasn't as fun as murder. But it did send similar sparks of excitement throughout his body, Sherlock noticed idly.
The meaning of Sherlock's pedantic rambling started to dawn on John, who wriggled all the more frantically, trying to worm his way out of his partner's grasp without actually hurting him – whether his feelings or his body.
The only thing Sherlock was presently realizing, though, was that John had no idea of what he was doing. Or rather, he had all the elements and was well aware of the situation, but still acted stupidly. It did not make any sense.
None the less, he did not seem unhappy. A smile twinkled in his eyes. Though I feared I had lost our intimacy for the night, I was sure I could get it back. A gentle hand on his thigh brought him back to me.
I was not expecting for Holmes to smile at that. He took the tub from me, lay it next to my shoulder and lowered himself down so that he could kiss me again. He rested his forehead on my own and looked into my eyes through his lashes.
If I had said he had any interest at all of this nature, I would not have said it was men he was particularly fond of. I could scarcely convince myself that he had any affection for women, but Irene Adler had such a damning effect on him, I assumed if he was in some way inclined, it would be that way. But I could not see him having any sexual preference at all, so I found it as fascinating as I did arousing to see him looking at me, with a curious, wild look in his eyes. It was loving and tender, and base and filthy all at once. I could not look at myself in that moment. I looked at him instead. He brought me so much comfort when the world could provide nothing else and the expression on his handsome face then comforted me that I had nothing to worry about. Not with myself, I mean. I was not being judged or scrutinised or studied.
The pleasurable abuse to his cock continued on for a few agonizing minutes, every so often feeling so close to the edge before Sherlock would pull away and press kisses to the inside of his thighs and everywhere else except where he needed it most.
“Okay, no need to get smart with me.” He looked down to give him a smile and was met with the gentle tilt of Sherlock’s head so their lips just barely brushed against each other.
He was too distracted by the possibility of a large fish that circled underneath him, that he hardly noticed the man that suddenly appeared beneath the dock, and clung to the pole as he stared up to John.
It was rather difficult for John to manage the task of covertly covering his mouth in order to hide the distinct
John hardly had a moment to breathe before Mycroft was already ahead of him and on his way to the dock with that blanket and bag. John stayed close behind, and watched from behind him as Sherlock dragged himself up with strained movement and set a similar bag of books on the dock before he laid down in an exhausted heap.
John did as requested, starting up his pace again to both their delight as a low groan escaped his throat. His head soon coming to rest in the crook Sherlock’s neck and nibble on the salty tasting skin, he quickly let out a small groan as the action caused Holmes’ hand to grip hair and pull. John’s hand moved much quicker after that.
It was with relief that John was finally able to follow Sherlock into his room and take a seat beside him. Both seemed content to stay where they were and to never move again.
He was pulled from his thoughts when the familiar sound of a cane hitting the dock drew him away. The obvious tension he had built up in his shoulders seemingly melted away as he heard
He never did have much of an appetite, perhaps that was just the case here. He soon turned back to John and gave him another smile as he set down the barely touched sandwich.
The delicately made sandwiches and fruits were almost artful and seemed not to be made to be eaten. It rather reminded them both of the almost idealistic paintings of food one would find in a renaissance master’s art.
I will try to update this story at least once every week, yet due to the upcoming holiday I won't post a chapter next week. Don't worry though, I will update the story as soon as I have access to my computer once again :)
It was nothing exceptional, and would be considered rather plain to most people who would stay in this hotel, but it was perfectly alright to John as it held all the required amenities. He made his way over to the pedestal sink where he collected a wet flannel to clean himself with. It was there he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror, a perfectly ordinary thing to see on any other day, but when he looked over his sweat stained brow, his flushed face, and the slightly dozy eyed stare he gave to himself, he began to feel… ashamed.
Sherlock’s tail was somewhat of an anomaly within its self as far as John could understand. Unlike the other, more animal like tails such as John’s own which was fairly goat-like in appearance, Sherlock’s was… Well, it was fairly interesting. It resembled more of the shape that a 17
John couldn’t help but feel like a puppet as he was maneuvered throughout the room, his body felt weightless underneath the man’s gentle caresses and breathy kisses until he found himself sitting on the side of the bed with Sherlock’s head between his legs.
He swiftly averted his gaze from him and attempted to calm the wash of red that had overtaken his face. The man didn’t seem to be in immediate danger, so he took a moment to collect himself before he turned back to him, and he was gone.
He returned a soft smile to him until it was driven away by the sound of someone who began to call out to him. John turned towards the voice to see the jovial and familiar face of Mike Stamford that came close to barreling towards him.
He took a moment to let his eyes adjust to the dim setting before he followed the torches down a staircase, a grimace passed over his face when his back was pressed against the wall as whatever was there was never going to come out of the fabric.
He only seemed to gain consciousness again when Lestrade stood by him and touched his shoulder, which almost caused him to jump out of his skin.
Sherlock starts to talk of the “what ifs” in the event he is permanently disabled. How he can’t face living in a care home, how he can’t live without the work etc. John can’t promise him he won’t be disabled. But he does promise him that whatever happens John will take him home eventually and that he won’t leave him; they are in it together and John will help him get his life back.
“Mm, a little of this, a little of that. Don’t worry John, it is completely controlled so there’s nothing to worry about.”
He then turned his attention to John, the sheer resolved look he held on his features only added to the need for him to get him on the damn boat.
What he was able to do was roll over to face the small cave opening that sat beside his bed, which at least gave him more of a view.
He cautioned a glance over to Greg, the utter shock on his face clear as day, especially after their earlier conversation. He let out a small sigh as he shook his head, and turned back to look at the rest of his crew.
Sherlock turned back towards his ship in a feeble attempt to see John one last time, just to catch a glimpse of his gentle eyes and soft wheat coloured hair. He didn’t look forward to seeing a look of utter betrayal that met his eyes and made them sting and his throat burn.
It was now John’s turn to look confused at such a bold and brash statement that he could be so certain of. He took this quite obvious bait and leaned forward just slightly to listen to him. “And how would you know that?”
Sherlock placed the small bag in his hand and watched as it disappeared within one of the pockets of his coat, likely to be properly thrown away later with Molly as an assistant. Wonderful, that was the last thing he needed.
“Stop it Sherlock, whatever the hell you are doing, just stop it. Why are you on this again? I thought you went clean a long time ago!”
The Captain took a pause as he allowed himself to take a drink as he pondered his words, and soon cleared his throat before he stood. The entirety of the room silenced to turn their gaze towards him.
“Alright miss, it’s time to get to bed. We can’t stay up too late now.” He lifted her up from her place on the carpet and turned the television off. He couldn’t help a small smile as she rubbed her tired eyes and rested her head down on his shoulder.
“That isn’t the point! My point is that he’s different from the other ‘pathetic people’ that you group him in with. He cares about me, and… And I care about him.”
The agonizingly slow ride from the hotel to the dock was only made worse by the constant bout of silence he received from Mycroft that began to make him nauseous from some form of anxiety, so John could not be more relieved when the carriage stopped and he made a hasty exit to get some air.
He went to work attaching one side of his rope securely to the leg of the bed, a rough pull on it was enough to tighten the rope further and he moved to the window to drop the line down. It was just long enough to land around five feet above the ground.
No, he was being ridiculous. John would either be there or not. If not, he would just come back tomorrow, yet there still remained a nervous pit in his stomach at the thought of losing the chance to see him again.
The desperate twinge in his voice was enough to pull at his heart strings and he gave him another kiss and nod, then Sherlock was gone. A quick splash of water hit the deck and John watched his tail dive underneath the murky waves.
“His trial is on Thursday, Sherlock. Significant evidence has been placed against him, and will likely seal his sentence for hanging.” He then continued on his path back down to the street.
Sherlock let out a small sigh before he winced at the icy touch of the pack pressed against his already sore cheek.
Mycroft stopped him again before he had the opportunity to become too loud. His hand slipped down from the table, into his coat pocket to pull out a small black leather book that he skimmed through.
The question was : why did John Openshaw come to the police in London ? Because he was not believed in Horsham. The killer must have thought there was some danger for him, since he didn't wait for John's return and followed him to London to get rid of the threat. Elias was killed because he was to give the killer some papers which he burnt in challenge. Joseph was killed because he was explicitly asked to give those papers back, but obviously couldn't since they had been destroyed. John was merely the next on the list, with the same impossibility to comply. Fortunately for him, Sherlock thought, he didn't have any children. Well, 'fortunately'...
She first met him at the National Opera and Ballet Theatre in Odessa. It was summer and the evening was warm. Unperturbed by the clammy weather, Eliska was wearing a crimson sheath dress, her ethereal, aristocratic beauty enhanced by the contrast of her pure white skin with the fabric of her gown and the redness of her lips. She was supposed to meet a man there, a "lover", but he had never come; instead, it was Jim Moriarty she had found sitting next to her as they watched Swan Lake. She had never quite forgotten.
She nodded cautiously. "Yes. But not like that. You know..." She trailed off. Perhaps she couldn't find the words, or her voice failed her. He looked her in the eye.
You wonder absent-mindedly if he'd think the same of you. Of course he noticed when you weren't in the room, so you couldn't be sure. But wasn't that why he had refused to go back to the flat in the first place? You really hadn't understood why in the world he'd want to move out just because you were dead: obviously, Mrs. Hudson would lower the rent for him, and it was a blessed opportunity to live in central London at his ease in a flat big enough for two. Having a spare room could even be useful if he wanted to have his first child there.
He let his gaze slide over her, taking in all the details. It might have still been hard to read her, had she not been pretending to be someone else. But she was, and reading that fake identity was enough for Sherlock to deduce what she was doing here.
There is glass and water and shards tinged in red – flowers or blood, you can't be sure. And always the feel of his skin against yours. "Goodbye, John." Something is falling. A red apple from a tree.
Sherlock eyes you suspiciously, not even trying to hide a doubtful frown. Your eyes instantly fall to his lips. You look away.
Sherlock blinked, nonplussed by his flatmate's incoherence and by how annoyingly cute he found that damn tuft on his groggy head.
"I was just curious, John. Your reaction is nothing to be ashamed of. You're a cat: it is only natural that you would react like a cat to some things."
However, when Sherlock's slender hand brushed against his scar, he let out a little gasp and closed his eyes.
Mr. Fielding is saying he believes to be innocent. John keeps writing, the sound his fingers make on the keys filling the room. The Collector is now accusing Mr. Fielding of having insulted Mr. Heaslop. Ronny is almost crying. John stops typing a second, as if groping for the right words, then resumes his activity. Now Mr. Fielding is looking at Marabar Hills. He's feeling miserable. He feels he's failed his life; Mary is wondering what happened at Marabar Hills. John is typing. What's that case about, again? Oh yes. Something about a riddle and the disappearance of a live-in help and a household manager. Something about the sun and the shadow. And John is still typing. Mr. Fielding is thinking he ought to have been working at something else all this time. Something about an oak, and an elm, perhaps. Mary wonders whether Adela truly was assaulted and by whom. John keeps typing.
. He retched and squirmed helplessly as a hand came to rest on his stomach and another on his mouth, choking him, silencing his upcoming shriek.
Perhaps three years wasn't such a long time. But it felt like centuries. Like another life, one that had been his, but not quite his – something that no longer belonged to him, but to a dead man. At the beginning, he had wondered why the Woman kept calling him Mr. Holmes, always, as if to taunt him. Perhaps it wasn't taunting after all. Perhaps it was just to remind him of his name.
John couldn’t help his smile as he scooted closer to the edge, his shoes were swiftly removed and set beside him. His socks were helplessly soaked through even with Sherlock attempting to cover him.
Hopefully I could do justice to your idea, it truly was an interesting concept and I hope I accomplished fleshing it out
Thank you again to Shadowsoul_954 for suggesting I should continue this story as I now have so many new ideas for the future of it
John felt familiar shivers run through him at the conflicting heat of his cock in Sherlock’s hand against the cool temperature of the room, instinctively moving his hips closer to his lover’s warmth and letting a strangled groan escape his throat.
He was too distracted by the possibility of a large fish that circled underneath him, that he hardly noticed the man that suddenly appeared beneath the dock, and clung to the pole as he stared up to John.
No one managed to make it to anything resembling a bedroom in any sense of the word. A sitting room became the next best option, as that is where they were found by the staff that began to carry the soaking books inside to dry off. Mycroft was sat within a reading chair, his head resting against the back of it, with a decanter and half full glass sitting beside him on a side table.
“Yes, the war burdened doctor falls in love with the little merman and believes the world to right itself within love’s eternal wake. Did you truly expect nothing to come to a head? This isn’t a fairytale Doctor Watson.”
Finally, after an excruciating minute of silence between them, Mycroft made the smallest of gestures. One that if you blinked, you would miss it. A miniscule nod in the direction of their ship; an authorization that he could leave and he would not be followed.
cabin, on his way to the infirmary. He pulled open the door, one last glassy gaze was shared between them, before John lowered his gaze to the floor and shut the infirmary door behind him.
In my head, Sherlock never does tell John that he wanted children as it was something that was no longer a necessity in their relationship. If you do want to write an alternate scene where this does happen, I would be more than happy to see it
Holmes’ face feigned to a disheartened pout as his eyebrows scrunched and his lips shook. It almost made John feel a small pang of guilt as it was not as though this was his proudest work and he was paid well, he simply did not prefer the idea of being aboard something possibly more abysmal than what he had already experienced.
Sherlock lugged the guard onto his bed as fast as he could and covered him with a blanket to give himself some spare time before he left the cell and locked it behind him.
“Your smile. You look like you’re about to fall in love.” -S.Z. // Excerpt from a book I’ll never write
Sherlock was on his feet in a moment’s notice, his steps were swift and steady to where he wondered how he hadn’t fallen yet. John was so close to him, just another turn around this corner and he would be in his arms again-
The small cave went quiet for a moment, but Victor could have claimed it sounded as though something had just shattered behind him from the sudden painful ringing his ears had taken on. Victor’s hand dropped away from Sherlock’s in order to hold himself upright on the bed as he thought he would fall over.
He had just stood to dust himself off and began to walk away, when he heard the maddening sound of that damned hotel door creak open. John turned back to see Mycroft joined to two men on either side of him, that same cruel and gleaming smile kept John in his place on the pavement as he approached.
John quickly sniffled and did his best to sound much more infuriated than devastated. He did not do a very convincing job. “G… Go away Lestrade! I am not in the mood for another one of your ‘conversations’.”
John needed to take in a breath at his explanation. They had only known one other one or two days, yet they had likely shown one another more intimacy than many married couples in London had. It hardly seemed to matter how intimate this new action was.
He merely received another muted, pained cry that seemed to come from the very depths of Sherlock’s being. If he knew one thing about his little brother, it was that he hardly strayed from his dramatics long enough to bluff, especially when it came to something that seemed to matter to him so deeply.
Before either of them managed another shaken breath, John was up from his seat and wrapped around the bed laden man. It would have been comforting if Sherlock could really feel it.
John soon came to the realisation that it was not the cold as the warmth of the cab was nearly suffocating, but rather he could see that desperate need that built itself in his eyes. That followed by the rapid movement of his fingers against his thigh, the shaking worsened, and his attitude became rapidly agitated as the drive continued.
He wiped sweat from his brow, and moved to open one of the small portholes that produced the smallest sliver light for the room. Fresh air rushed in when the breeze grazed against the side of the ship, providing him some relief as he went to the task of organizing his tools. John eventually leaned back in the old wooden chair as he inhaled the fresh air, feeling the smell replenish his nose after hours in the musk of rotting wood.
The absolute variety among the population in London was more than John ever truly expected. With a mixture of straight, low-hanging tails, coiled tails, to short and bushy tails and much more. It was likely a larger diversification among people than he’d probably seen in his life.
“Wait, wait a minute. I may have not known you for very long, and so far, that relationship has been strained at best. Why, why now have you just given him the chance to change his life for me?”
“I certainly hope you don’t plan to publish this; I would not mind reading it, but I cannot imagine what the general public would think.”
All too quickly, and much to John’s tremor, he felt the pace of his hand on his cock hasten and drove him to his swift end that approached with full force. The last metaphor he thought of as being set on fire seemed to come to pass when just one particular touch against his member easily set him alight.
I was initially hesitant on starting such a project, as I already have a lot of ideas in mind for the future, but I would like to try my hand at your suggestions as there has not been one of these for quite some time if I recall
As well as different AUs, I always thought the idea of different universes the two actors have been in Ex.) The Office(UK), Doctor Strange, The Imitation Game, The Hobbit, and Fortysomething. These are just suggestions of the ones I can remember, and you do not have to suggest them, it's just an option if someone would like to
“So… You really did it. Just… Why did you do it, Sherlock? You never seemed to want something like this before.”
He took pity on him, as he knew this was something very different to his understanding of intimacy. He pressed a gentle kiss to his lips, and held it for a moment until John relaxed enough to continue. He moved his kisses down his face, pushed away the collar of John’s shirt and nuzzled his nose into the crook of John’s neck.
Thankfully, it was enough to sate him in one way, although not in another. After days of frustrated arousal and reckless, albeit unintentional teasing on Sherlock’s part that had plagued John to no end, so it was not too much of a jump when a simple kiss quickly became impassioned.
He turned back to look towards the guard with the bloody finger. Mycroft’s men wouldn’t hold him much longer; despite his injuries, he maintained enough strength to fight them off. The question was, who would he aim for? It was the obvious answer that Sherlock would fall to face the barrel of his pistol, yet deranged men had a tendency to aim at the first thing they saw as a threat; John then was in his line of sight.
He didn’t bother to notify Sherlock, as this was a very tender moment and he did not wish to interrupt him, so he continued to stare. Slightly red hair, pale skin, and scales that shone against the rock’s surface similar to Sherlock’s own peered over the rock with little subtlety. They were being watched and not well.
John is surprised Sherlock didn’t realise John considered them to be life partners by now (maybe this is post season 4, or maybe earlier and Mary never happened; up to you). Anyway John has for a long time considered Sherlock to be his “person”, even though they don’t share a bed. John just assumed Sherlock knew and didn’t want a more intimate relationship with John. Whereas Sherlock was oblivious to John’s feelings and was keeping his distance out of respect for John’s boundaries.
John’s gaze locked to his bed as his fingers fiddled with a stray thread. “Nothing, I was just… exercising my muscles. They were sore.”
John let out a light, nervous laugh as he had never even thought of what colour he wanted. He wanted something distinctive about Sherlock, and the one thing that stuck in his mind was his eyes. The piercing, almost indescribable blue that seemed to dim every other thing around them and could capture your gaze within a second.
His grip upon the dock soon loosened, and he fell into the murky depths. His eyes took a moment to adjust, and the lack of light hardly helped him. What he did see was the slim figure of Sherlock as he swam around him, similar to the way many people have described dolphins circle them when they have fallen overboard.
Calmly, he said, “I am glad to have you as my doctor. But I am sure you have heard of this before. Surely you can assume the same as me, that if it were not so enjoyable, people would not risk ruination for it. If done correctly, which I trust you will assist me with, I will be in no danger. You will help me, will you not, Watson?”
“Watson,” His voice was barely above a whisper. I could not bring myself to take my eyes off his hands. They had moved lower, lower peeling away at my shirt and the white undershirt beneath it, leaving my chest and stomach exposed. They now sat at the waistband of my trousers, the tips of his fingers feathering my stomach. “I ask you again if this is what you desire.”
Carefully avoiding the lips for fear of wanting more, John leant in and kissed Sherlock's nose, which wrinkled comically under the touch. Chuckling quietly, John repeated the gesture, this time eliciting an adorable frown from his lover, and he was doomed. It was too late. Now he wanted to see the pout and the scowl, to hear the groan and the whine, and to stifle the protest that was sure to come under a shower of kisses.
When I met Greg the first time, that's what he said about you. That you were a great man, and that he hoped, one day, you would even become a good one.
With a huge, silly grin, Moran waved eggplants with a hole in them in front of Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock stared.
"Too bad it wasn't in the shoulder, we could've had matching scars; but I would never get a psychosomatic limp." He gave a silly giggle, and John had to hold him back onto the pillow so he wouldn't roll down to the floor.
They held each other's gazes, their burning pupils having a brief staring contest, before the tension melted in a reciprocal, knowing smile.
"Johnny boy!" the hateful lilting voice chimed. "I am so glad that you've accepted my invitation! I've missed you, you know."
"Fill me in as we go to the crime scene," he told Lestrade, taking his coat as he walked out of the flat.
"Sherlock!" he protested once the detective finally let go of him, red in the face and panting. His cheeks were glowing and his frown only made him more endearing. Sherlock smiled wolfishly. "I thought you said no kiss today!"
"It's still early. You don't have to sleep now," he said quietly, because the silence was too much to bear.
can give you so much pleasure... Subduing you and pleasuring you has proved much more thrilling than I ever thought it would be."
"... didn't like it," he concluded with a frown, and if John had seen his face he couldn't have resisted kissing him because it was positively adorable.
Mrs. Hudson came up and prepared breakfast for her two troublesome renters. She put the kettle to boil and made toast with whichever spread and jam the two wanted, remarking every once in a while: "Not your housekeeper!"
He stared at her blankly. This wasn't right. She didn't understand. No, he had to talk to someone else. Someone who would understand.
It took John a few seconds to remember the discussion. "I'll be honest with you. I hate to think about Harry or Donovan or Anderson knowing about it. I'm just... not ready for that. And there's something else, Sherlock. Public image. You have one now. You're not exactly famous, but in any case, you have a reputation of sorts. This is not something I should ever put on my blog, and I need you to understand why."
, John!" Sherlock replied angrily, shaking John's hands off and turning away. Was this all it took? "What can I do to make you believe me?"
Everything here talks of Sherlock. He's incredibly glad Mrs. Hudson (and, he must admit, Mycroft) didn't follow his advice when he wrote that note and said they should just get rid of everything. If they had, he would've had nowhere to go.
Lestrade laughed, and John stared. Greg shifted awkwardly under his nonplussed gaze. On second thought, it did look like John was a little disconnected from reality. He seemed so confused Greg stopped laughing at once.
"Before I told you what I had found about your father, I knew. I knew how you'd react. I told you anyway."
, Sherlock thought. The asymmetry. John had accepted a sexual relationship when what he had wanted was surely a romantic one. But he had known. He had known Sherlock couldn't give that to him. And he had still gone along with it all.
As John was speaking, Sherlock's eyes widened. First of all, because he hadn't expected that kind of apology. Secondly, because he'd heard the top steps creak, and knew Maggie was standing just behind the door. He smirked.
Soon his right knee was accompanying the rhythm from his left foot, and along with the knee came the hip beating time with little upwards thrusts. His right hand stroked his throat and circled the nape of his neck. His body shuddered with a pang of shame at reacting to his own hand. He ran his fingers through his short hair and thought of Sherlock's curly locks and how different it would feel against his palm. His left arm crept up his thigh and snaked under his jumper alongside his belt until it reached his pelvis, which he began to buck as well, then crawled down his right leg, gripping the fabric of his jeans.
Ella Thompson never got mad at her patients. Sometimes, she just considered some of them a lost cause. John Watson definitely was one.
"My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky. It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by; for every night at teatime and before you take your seat, with lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street."
Yet the fact remained. Mary Morstan had been targeted. More importantly, John Watson had been targeted. Miss Morstan – no, Mrs. Watson – was only of interest because of her new name and status. Because she had become John's wife.
"And what did your expertise tell you about these letters, sir?" Helena inquired before he left the room. Sherlock turned back to her.
"I... As I said, I observed you these past few days," he says. "I had to put your flat under surveillance. Now, you know this is not my area, but it doesn't look like... like..."

"You're scared because for once your deducing skills cannot tell you for sure that I won't leave. In fact, statistically speaking, you are right to say that very few couples remain as such until the end of their life. You're scared because you cannot be certain, nor can you just believe me blindly: you're not one for faith, or even for trust. So you did the only thing that seemed rationally, scientifically likely to ensure I stayed with you for as long as possible. Chemistry, was it?"
Whether he'd been aware of it before the Basement, now John definitely knew. But he hadn't been patronizing, and he hadn't taken advantage of it to destroy him even further. John wasn't a genius and so didn't react like geniuses who always love humiliating their peers to push themselves to the fore. He'd reacted like the infatuated friend that he was, like the soldier and the doctor: he'd given him everything. And Sherlock had no idea how to pay him back.
When he was sure John was out of earshot, Sherlock dropped his act and put the instrument back into its case, giving in to his sulk. Now he knew how serious the matter truly was. If John considered him a threat to his sexuality and manliness or God knows what, he'd marry the first woman he'd meet – Maggie, perhaps – and leave 221B for good. Sherlock ignored the pang in his chest and frowned. He couldn't permit it.
Minutely, the tiger shook his head. John nodded, and walked back to the kitchen. He made himself some tea, some toast, although he had rather lost his apetite.
Your eyes meet and you can't help but laugh again, quietly. The conversations you have with Seb are barely conversations at all. Yet it feels comfortable. When he's not being annoying, his presence is actually quite pleasant. Lately he comes rather often to your flat, but he isn't much of a bother. In fact, if you don't pay attention to him you hardly notice him at all. You never had that kind of relationship with Harry, even though she's your sister. But you think that it might be similar to what brotherhood feels like, not minding the presence of the other. Well. When he's not being a chatter-box, that is. Seb is such a fickle character, he changes mood so easily... But he must have been feeling down; recently he's rarely been irritating.
The torn out page of a book attached to a name card with a paper clip. On the back of the name card, a note. "It will all end as it begun..." Ominous. Wishing to sound ominous, at any rate.
"So you can chat her up? No, thank you. But I'm glad you came – I mean, you didn't help at all, but still I could talk to someone."
"Why someone would go to such an extent to make the police look like fools. I think I've never seen Lestrade so much out of his depth." Sherlock chuckled.
"That's all I do," Sherlock growled with annoyance, very much pining for blissful unconsciousness right now. "John, I really want to look at you, but... I'm really dizzy... Think I'm going to pass out..."
He suddenly felt giddy and had to hold onto the counter. Yes, the flannel one would be great, thank you. Harry didn't look at him like he was mad and throwing his money away. When they came out of the department store, she asked him if he wanted to murder his ex-flatmate in the room he was renting or somewhere else (the people walking past them in the street had exchanged puzzled and even worried glances, and John thought it would be quite amusing if they were to call Lestrade about it). He understood his sister was implying that using the gun in his new room wasn't a very good idea, unless he wished to move out right away ("
"How are you alive?" John insisted, not entirely sure he was still awake. Perhaps he was dreaming. Hadn't he lied down for a bit earlier? Yes, he was probably sleeping. That was the most logical explanation.
"Well, then, I guess you should go and get him. I wouldn't hurt him, but there is a murderer roaming around after all. We wouldn't want poor John to come to any harm, would we?"
"Come on, take it." His voice is tinged with impatience; regardless of what he claims, you know he too is exhausted.
"No, John," he answers, taking one of the two pills out of the bottle. "I haven't been talking to Greg." He takes out of his pocket another identical bottle, and puts the pill in it. "Actually, this is how it looked exactly. Two pills. Two bottles. The other victims only got one bottle, but Sherlock was special, you see."
Since it didn't look like Sherlock would answer any time soon, lost in thought as he was, John nodded. The woman brought her hand to her mouth and shook her head.
Victor blinked at him. There was surprise there, of course, but also a trace of the old pain. Every time he looked at Sherlock, he seemed... hurt. Regretful, perhaps, or melancholy. Sherlock hoped he did not wear his feelings on his sleeve like that for everyone to see.
"Shh. This time you're the one who has to relax," Sherlock cut in, his tone firm. Then in a small voice, he added tentatively: "I know I've upset you a lot today. Please don't be angry."
Bewildered, Sherlock tried to look everywhere but at John, which was rather complicated since the doctor was standing right between his legs.
You start breathing again. This is absurd. You can't get apnoea the moment your eyes aren't fixed on him.
He gives you a look. "What the hell, John? I'm Seb. My name's really Sebastian Moran, if that's your question. And I never lied to you, by the way."
She realizes too late that she's used the present tense, but it doesn't seem to bother John – in fact, he doesn't even seem to notice. Molly feels a pang in her chest. John is learning to live with a ghost, even though Sherlock is still alive somewhere.
They glared at each other for a moment, until John got tired of it and looked away. Sherlock repressed a smile of satisfaction, but his relief was short-lived.
"Why do you have a sniper rifle under your bed, Seb?" His tone was disbelieving, but Moran could already hear the accusatory edge to it.
At this moment Chris saw Harry walking up to them with a Cheshire cat-like grin on her face, and smirked. Bursting in on them without saying a word, she ran to her fiancée and kissed her passionately. Chris kissed back, chuckling into the embrace.
This time it was Mary's turn to look at Mycroft strangely. He gave her a sweet smile that made her frown a little.
Mycroft smiled, and John wondered if it was a Holmes thing to compete for the most irritating smirk. "I meant since this morning."
"Oh God," you murmur, as if realizing only now what is happening. You squeeze his hand in yours, desperately, elatedly. Sherlock is alive.
"No you're not," Jim retorted in his sing-song voice, his tone assured. Then to John: "We could reverse the roles, if you'd like. We could see how you dance with a man's cock up your arse, and Sherlock can enjoy the show just like you could enjoy his little strip dance last time. So what do you say? It's only fair, don't you think?"
"You see, I think I might have found someone who wouldn't mind taking the flat of a psychopath if it were in Lond..."
"Sorry if I can't exactly believe your words when you seem to worry so much about your target's well-being."
She stops dead in her track and looks at the sea. The moon has risen above it. John is standing on the beach, his laptop under his arm.
"He might even be the one who put Elsie in contact with a rich bachelor heir in Great Britain. In any case, he's the reason Abby and Elsie started using their code so obviously – he surely asked Mrs. Cubitt to let her husband see it, and act horrified."
John seems lost. No, more than that, Sherlock realizes. In shock. He looks at Sebastian, then at Sherlock, with confusion.
," John asserted with a small nod, kissing Sherlock's cheek chastely. "But in any case, if you do have something – which I highly doubt – I'm already contaminated, so there's no point in fussing now."
The next moment she is hugging him, sobbing on his shoulder, and he is so lost he even forgets to stiffen.
"It was the murderer we'd been looking for for ages. He just managed to identify his patterns so well that he found him, and handed him to us on a platter."
"I'm sorry, John, but we don't have all night – you must have some time to sleep, it's the whole point after all."
In any case, Sherlock had been troubled for sure, but not by the things he should've been most worried about according to John. So he did have something else on his mind the whole time, and although John thought back then that it was just him being his brilliant self and figuring things out, he realizes now that perhaps there's a whole dimension of the sordid affair that
Enjoying every shiver it sent down his lover's spine, John stroked the black mop of hair and massaged the scalp. He slowly made his way to the neck, which he undertook to relax with an earnest, precise touch, spreading lavender oil and massaging with his thumbs. Sherlock was concentrating on breathing deeply and regularly, intent on completely relaxing his body to show John that he trusted and wanted him. But he was so anxious about it that it only strained his muscles more. Hence his focusing on his breathing so his body would stop being so difficult and
Did Sherlock still feel anything about John, at all? It was likely that distance had exacerbated his feelings – that's what normally happens, but then this was
"What do I want from you?" You feel stupid for asking. But if you don't, you'll just be speaking at cross purposes.
Sherlock seemed about to remark on the redundancy of his statement, but appeared to think better of it, and nodded instead.
"Don't try too hard. You're doing fine," you tell him quietly. Then you tiptoe, lean in, and press your lips to his lightly, the touch chaste and unalloyed. It lasts but a second. "I'll get your pyjamas."
This time he gapes, but seeing Chris's frown tries to get a grip and nods, straightening his military stance.
Every time she passed the milk in the supermarket, she was reminded of John's frequent visits, his apologetic smile –
Mary nods. "I've never been close to a dead person. I mean, someone who died. But it feels right to go visit them sometimes, don't you think? Not that Sherlock isn't always there with us, but..."
Yi Ling was hurrying down the crowded streets of Venice, hands full with shopping bags from different tailors and shoemakers. Her mistress was at the SPA this morning and so she had been sent to get her orders throughout the city. Yi Ling loved Miss Salome – as she insisted that she called her. It had felt a bit awkward at first – calling her mistress by her first name – but now the young maid was used to it. She had been so happy to be noticed by this beautiful foreign lady while walking down the street in Singapore (where she'd come, hoping to find a job), and then Miss Salome had brought her along in Kuwait where her husband – a billionaire of Greek descent who was born in Singapore - had some business. And now, she was even in Venice... Yi Ling had never dreamt of such a life for herself. But she also knew that whatever happened to her mistress, and wherever she went, even to the darkest corner of the poorest village on the surface of the earth, she would follow, ever adoring and faithful.

Slowly, he walked around the naked man and rested his hands on his shoulders, after he'd given Sherlock the shower for him to wash his crotch himself. For some reason, John was very happy that they could be so intimate without sex being involved in any way. He felt truly priviledged to be be allowed such intimacy. Concentrating on the contracted muscles of his partner, he started to knead firmly, intent on making Sherlock relax.
At last, she stood and dressed into a black evening gown, and grabbed her purse. Without even one last look at her husband — or at the illegal new pet he’d acquired — she left. The manul let out a very loud sigh of relief.
Fear and an indefinable anguish flickered in the clear pupils, which blurred – but Sherlock did not avert his gaze. He forced himself to look into the depths of John's irises, to really look, even though their intensity was blinding, their determination dazzling.
Victor smiled thinly, and the sight of it was so painful Sherlock almost regretted his comment. Almost.
Sherlock shifted a bit and grumbled something in his sleep, scowling. Amused, John smiled and smoothed the adorable frown away. Really, what was he doing? Wasn't he being horrible to both Maggie and Sherlock? But neither of them wanted the same thing from him.
"Goodbye," he murmured, staring back up at the fires. Then, in a louder voice that made the couple next to them jump: "Cheers!" He drank his cup down in one go.
John's didn't. His first scream ripped through the oppressive air of the bedroom and through you very soul.
thought John as he circled the sacrum with a soothing fondle, massaging the buttocks and middle back, spreading outwards from the spine. His movements were becoming more frantic by the second, more desperate than gentle, too. Sherlock growled and was torn between arching his back and snuggling closer. Instead, he responded by darting his tongue onto John's shoulder, licking the scar and wound, remembering that his previous reaction to it had been more than satisfying. He found he loved the taste of blood – of
from both Lestrade and Sebastian. He blushes. "I mean, consulting detective in the world. You know. He invented the job after all, and since he's even dead now, there really can't be any other..." As he's fumbling with words, he goes for the silly grin, but that doesn't seem to work either, and the
He was given his old job back all right, with different underlings, and he made it a point to regally ignore Anderson and Donovan. This was one of the promises he'd made with himself when he had moved back: act as if they did not exist. Otherwise, he knew he would snap. He did not allow himself one glance, one word towards them. He had the satisfaction to know they would go down once he'd proved Sherlock's innocence to the world – and he knew he could, for he had the dedication, and Big Brother's unofficial support, which granted him power and access to everything he needed.
John looks at his phone, then groans. "Sorry about that. She probably thought I didn't want to come to her flat."
Sherlock let out a low groan as this conversation felt so beneath him. Why would John find this an issue? He could not think of one time of hearing John express his annoyance… Or was there a time and he just wasn’t listening?
Sherlock respectfully remained in his seat while John went off to get an icepack and some disinfectant. John returned slightly out of breath and flushed, possibly from the walk but most likely because of guilt as he sat down beside sherlock and placed the icepack to his head.
Sherlock had moved his attention to the difficult process of undoing the buttons of John’s vest and shirt, the tie and collar was swiftly pushed aside to allow his lips to travel over each inch of him that he could manage to find. It often meant that he found his way to multiple scars, which he lightly brushed over to give a soft kiss to each one he managed to find.
The bedroom door was firmly shut when John practically pinned the taller man to it when he wouldn’t even attempt to face him.
John had barely noticed that his hands moved to cup Sherlock’s face, their met for just a moment too long for John to see tears in Sherlock’s crystal blue eyes. A sudden instinct came over him to wipe away the ones that fell onto his cheek.
A flat palm to Sherlock’s face reverberated through the small cab just as the sting ran through John’s hand and Sherlock’s cheek. It went quiet for a moment again, John easily thought that they were about to be thrown out of the cab but it soon stopped in front of Baker Street. John swiftly paid and pushed them both out of the cab and towards home.
It seemed to be a perfectly delightful day beside the beach. Men and women promenaded along the seaside, and the mothers hid underneath their parasols while their children abandoned shoes and books to dip their toes into the foaming ocean spray.
The two received a smile in return of confirmation of the other and swiftly made their way to each other. Their arms enveloped one another in a joyous reunion after so many years, neither one could help the way they embraced and caused them to almost spiral out of position as bubbles were created and floated away around the two.
Sherlock only responded with a similar motion in kind, his feet soon allowed him to move from his place and begin to walk with John and Lestrade back to their ship. Their sanctuary.
“Good morning to you too, John…” John watched from over his shoulder as Sherlock sat down at the kitchen table and laid his head down on the cold wood.
“Damn it.” Sherlock took a deep breath as he ran to the side of the ship, pulling out a small telescope he kept in his pocket, and looked through it to the ship. A small growl escaping his throat when he saw unmistakably plump and tall figure of his brother.
The attempt to play along was slowly waning as he felt his finger move in concentric circles over his throat, his hand slowly trailed up to his face and his thumb rested at the corner of his mouth.
Sherlock swiftly left the room after that. A loud slam from his door signaled that he didn’t want to hear from John for the rest of the day, let alone the rest of the week. John let out a small sigh as he set his paper down and rested his head on a hand.
Sherlock managed to get a few others ready before he pulled john’s hand away from his face. Blood quickly oozed from the small gash he managed to open a few inches away from his mouth, and he began the somewhat painful process of having to listen to John wince every time he pressed disinfectant into the wound.
The clerk seemed to notice the newly formed grimace that appeared on his face and quickly stepped in to protect his sale.
He felt his body go rigid and his testicles tighten as his climax overtook him, he was faintly aware that one hand had ripped away the sheets from the corners of bed and the other had found its way between his teeth. His back arched itself from the mattress beneath him as he relished in the unbridled ecstasy of his orgasm till, he fell boneless back onto the rumpled sheets of his bed.
“I can’t even lift my hand, John! How, how am I supposed to do anything like this? I’m useless, worthless, I have no purpose without my work-“
He opened the box to find the delicate bracelet sat inside, in place of the rather dull and blackened stone that used to sit within the fingers, sat a lovely pale blue gem cut in a pleasing circle with so many edges that no matter which way you turned it, it would glitter when the sun hit it.
He looked up to Sherlock to see those piercing eyes peer into his own, holding his gaze and most likely expecting a retort to his comment, but he was not going to receive one. Instead, he felt the slight movement of his shirt slipping from his shoulder as Sherlock only gazed at it closer, a quiet hum of dissatisfaction escaped his throat as he turned his attention back to his companion.
Mycroft was already making himself comfortable in his desk chair when Sherlock turned back to him, the slight creak the object made practically impending its breakage. “So, what is this time, brother? 12… no, 15 pounds?”
A small shiver of repulsion ran through Sherlock at the reminder that he lived away from the rest of their pod. He knew Mycroft had a very similar situation to his, but he seemed to constantly draw attention to the fact that Sherlock was especially alone.
The movement was subtle, and many others would have claimed that there was nothing there, but the many years of trying to avoid being shot at made him keenly paranoid of even slight movements.
“Then perhaps you should lead me out of bed more often…” Sherlock let out a small chuckle as he leaned down to press a kiss to John’s lips, to which the man beneath him pulled him closer and allowed for his hands to push away the robe from his shoulders to give his hands more access as they trailed down his chest and swiftly undid the belt that was doing its best to protect the man’s dignity.
“Damn!” The curse slipped from the man’s lips in an exasperated gasp as he pulled his hand up. He looked to his quickly bloodied palm with small and large glass shards protruding from his skin, with the tension of his muscles only continuing to draw more of the vital fluid from his body.
So, with all that in mind, I’d love a fic where Sherlock and John are on a case and Sherlock takes a bad fall. John witnesses it and realises the potential for serious injury. There is a fear Sherlock has broken his neck and when John reaches him Sherlock can’t move or properly feel his body (it is not uncommon for spinal injuries to produce swelling that temporarily cause paralysis and numbness). And I would like that to be the case here. No permanent injury on this one. But the important thing is that neither Sherlock nor John know, at the beginning, that the injury is not permanent. There is no way to tell. Sherlock has to undergo a scan and then just wait and see if feeling comes back. And it’s several hours (ambulance ride and then hospital) before Sherlock has had tests and starts to get some feeling and movement back. All this time he’s totally immobilised, on a stretcher, and John is with him reassuring him.
Sherlock eventually managed to pull away from John’s shoulder enough to rub his eyes. The sudden intensity of light to his sight drew him back to John and he couldn’t help but hold him close again.
He made the effort to swim after him around the cave but Sherlock never managed to sit still for even a moment. It was just when Sherlock began to swim out of the cave again with another bag full of books that Victor had enough of playing follow the leader, and lightly gripped onto his wrist to sit him down.
It was moments later when John had found himself awoken by a gentle touch to his moustache that moved to run fingers through his hair.
“John, what happened?” He moved to sit down beside him, and attempted to push away John’s hand that only remained firmly planted.
After they had made it to land, he was quickly placed in the nearest prison one could find in the southern part of Cornwall. A transfer was likely the next step as Mycroft was adamant that he was to be held in London.
He must have looked completely out of his element, as a young man from behind the counter came up to his side.
He was forcefully gripped by his arms and thrown back into his chair before he could even get close to Mycroft, a scowl swiftly grew on his face as he scrunched in his chair and waited for him to open his mouth again.
If that wasn’t enough to contemplate, the fact that while many other’s tails are controlled subconsciously, while Sherlock learned how to control it for his own unnecessary use, simply because he could.
He didn’t linger on it for long though, as with a sweep of his coat he turned back to his men while his words slipped from his tongue with practiced ease. “You know what to do.”
John brushed along Sherlock’s cheekbone as he watched the man beneath let out a soft chuckle. Just to see that smile again, the way his face seemed to glow whenever he managed to pull a laugh from him, was enough to draw him in once again to lightly brushed their lips together.
“See? It’s already swelling. I’ll get something for it later, it’ll help with the swelling and pain…”
“See you tomorrow.” Sherlock pulled him for one last hug for the night, never paying attention to the pain that ran through his left arm as he had John in them after so long without it, and he was not about to complain.
It was just then Sherlock exited his bedroom and shut the door behind him with a loud thud, nearly sending both Miss Stoner and John up and out of their seats.
He took a deep breath and locked his eyes with him, a small smirk grew on his face as he slightly opened his mouth and took the man’s thumb inside. The man’s grip only grew when they were pressed chest to chest.
The texture against Sherlock’s palm was fluffy and warm from how close it was pressed to John’s body. It was rather comforting to just hold for a few moments to keep that warmth, before he flipped open the lid to see polished gold that was shaped into delicate hands with the thumb and index fingers clasped around a shimmering light blue stone, intricately cut, that seemed nearly blinding due to the last few rays of the dying sun that still peeked over the horizon beside him.
Sherlock let out a small huff and walked away, after a while John really began to think he just left him on the floor to hold his wound until coagulated, until Sherlock reemerged with an emergency kit while looking like he’s just had a fight with multiple cabinet doors.
He wished he never needed to know why when he looked to see a tall, lithe man in an expensive ebony coat make his way to the ship over the haphasard bridge they had made. His face was hidden under his equally dark hat until he lifted his head. A piercing gaze of ice blue eyes locked onto John before they moved to other men of his crew. His voice a silky baritone that held the attention of everyone who heard it.
John only received stares from both of them as his fingers moved up to Sherlock’s curls once again. I was likely to become a nervous habit if he wasn’t careful, but the way Mycroft looked incredulously at him was enough to let his fingers move.
“Damn!” He closed the telescope with little forgiveness to the unpleasantness it revealed to him. He made his way back to Lestrade, ignoring the slightly hopeful look in his eyes as he handed him the telescope.
The relief dissipated as he watched the criminal turn from where he was when he saw Sherlock catch the ledge of the building, and quickly made his way back over to him. All John could see was how the man loomed over Sherlock like a messenger of death, what he didn’t see was how the man raised a foot to stamp down on Sherlock’s fingers, and wrenched an agonizing cry from his throat.
A cold sweat broke out on his skin as the many stories he’d heard over the years of a pirate’s cruelty ran rampant through his head. He stood up; doing his best to makes his way away from the door and to find something,
This story has been somewhat of a lifesaver over the last weeks as its always given me something to look forward to. Now, I have exams to deal with but I swear to you, after the horrors of exams are over, I feel like I want to start a request fill during the months I have off. I'm not sure If that interests you, but It is something different that I'd like to take part in. Maybe I will see some of you making requests, only time will tell. Thank you again for your wonderful support throughout this story, I could never imagine it would receive as much support as it has.
John remained silent as he continued to stare up at him. What was the point of this? What was his goal here?
He took to the stairs two steps at a time before he stood in front of john once again, and watched as John’s hand extended towards him, patiently waiting.
I absolutely loved this idea and may have overdone it just a bit. I truly hope I captured what you had in mind as it is such an interesting concept to delve into
Also, completely off topic but also on topic mention, but did you know Sherlock was leaving Netflix on May 14th? I do not know how many of you knew it was on there, but it was certainly upsetting when I first learned of it.
“I also observed a minor tremor in your hand as you sutured up mine, now I have a theory about this. Would you mind if I?..” He placed his hand gently on the man’s forearm, looking to John as he wasn’t going to continue until he gave his permission.
Mycroft still did not move, and instead only softened his expression in an attempt to appeal to his younger brother.
John could not shut his door fast enough behind him after he looked away from Sherlock, his tears threatening to fall any second, but he would not let them. He made quick work of a few with his sleeves, and laid down on the small cot in the corner. Even with so little room, the bed felt so empty without
“For god’s sake Sherlock, I’m not as incompetent as you think to need one of your friends as a spy. I found out through my own means, and since I’m afraid I am too late to ask you to cease your relationship with him before it went too far, I again have taken the situation into my own hands.”
The snide remark he was about to receive was spared when Lestrade made himself known. Both of them seemingly have forgotten he was even there until he cleared his throat. “If I may be so bold as to interrupt this little lover’s tryst, we have to get going before anyone knows Sherlock is missing.”
It was certainly a calculated risk to take, but something about him seemed… trustworthy to say the least. That was already something to John as there were no longer many people that he was able to trust.
The crowd of men that lined the ship’s floors stared at them in silence as they made their way to the cross board connecting the two vessels. Sherlock made a quick stop when he caught Lestrade’s eye and nodded him towards his cabin, he wouldn’t move until he received a nod in return.
“… Slightly. I just need you to understand that you can’t put yourself in that situation again. I know you have little regard for your safety when it comes to cases, but promise me you won’t do something like that.”
The supple touch of his lips against John’s was enough to leave John boneless, it led him to lean into their silk like texture that seemed to meld the two of them together and made John never want to leave.
He did his best to dig his heels into the stone building and drag the line back up to him, praying that she didn’t look up to see him and alert everyone within a two-block radius; he let out most of the air in his lungs as she walked right past him and turned the corner.
By 8 pm his head began to hang low and his eyes stayed stuck to the rippling water, his only movement came down to the slight twitch his tail gave when a curious fish came too close to it.
He sat on the cave’s floor in front of a cracked mirror that he begrudgingly dragged to sit where it was, and fiddled with a few curls that never seemed to stay where he liked. He soon became fed up and swam away from the mirror, it was not as if his hair would stay the way he wanted out of the water when he spoke to John.
A warm hand cupped John’s cheek and finally closed the few last inches that separated them. Small drops of water fell from the merman's hand and ran down the side of John’s face, likely to leave the stain of salt in its trail. The breath the two began to share almost began to burn until John ultimately sealed their lips with one another’s.
“I suppose… I suppose you would like to understand why I was in Captain Holmes’ bed this morning. I can explain everything- “
Dr. John Watson could only a stand afar from the merriment as he hobbled along the boardwalk to avoid the unstable sand beneath his cane. He would have enjoyed the gentle spray of water on his face, but he had to contend with the salty smell of the sea from where he was.
The ride home on the tube wasn’t necessarily a bad experience per-se, John just wasn’t a fan of having to carry the groceries with him due to the only stores open at this time were miles away. He didn’t give it much thought however, as the outing gave him the opportunity to explore the surroundings and people.
He watched as this merman turned his head just slightly, as if he was confused by his response to this new discovery. This marvel of a creature was openly sitting in the public, when it could so easily be taken by someone with a less savory intent.
Well, I just live off of the angst here don't I? But do not worry, this story will have a happy ending! As much as I love bitter sweet endings, I could never do that to all of you
“Oh I wouldn’t know if we did, I’ve never seen one. I mainly try to read books that I find, they do help quite a bit.” He drew his attention back to the book that rested beside him and handed it to John. It was still soaked in water, but the sun had already dried a few parts of it off.
“I would never think to publish this, It’s merely for my private writings. What are you doing up so early? Usually, you aren’t up till midday.”
It did its intended job however, as Sherlock was soon snapped out of his drug induced haze to turn his attention to John.
Sherlock let out a small sigh as he crossed his arms over his chest. He couldn’t stand anymore of the lying, especially if it was done as terribly as John was managing.
John braced himself on the desk and pulled his body up from the floor, feeling as if his legs became two useless masses as he narrowed his eyes to give an illusion of confidence that he did not have. “Not really, why do you ask?”
“Ah, alright.” He happily took the sandwich John had offered him and took a bite. It took only a moment of his chewing for him to realise this was not something he wanted to swallow. He gave John a small smile as the man waited for his reaction to it, and soon had to spit it out into the water when John turned away from him.
have been, he instead found a very similar jar that contained rapidly coagulating blood; If he was a little less aware of his being that morning, he would have likely made that mistake.
Hopefully I managed to capture your idea. This was a little difficult, but I like to think I did the best I could
John took longer than normal to catch his breath, his gaze moved from Sherlock every so often before he felt stable enough to turn to him. “You… If MI6 knew about that, you’d be weaponized for sure...”
Sherlock he out a small sigh and stood up to stretch his back, his hand subconsciously remaining on his chair as he watched Mycroft rise from his chair. His grip only growing tighter when he watched his brother make his way to the door and pushed it open. “ready to go, brother?”
Sherlock broke the limp hold Lestrade kept on his forearm, and felt his feet begin to move. The guard held his pistol in his sprint to them and with sloppy accuracy, pulled the trigger.
Where his legs should have been, a long fish tail reached down to the water with shimmering scales that seemed to shift from a navy blue, to black, to an almost aubergine colour when the light hit them, sat in place of his lower appendages.
“I wouldn’t step closer, Mycroft. I’m sure you can understand that I enjoy my personal space.” He gave him a slight smirk as he stood up, the movement made Mycroft need to take a step back to keep himself just on the edge of the sword.
John turned his gaze back to the young merman that sat beside him, eagerly waiting to see his reaction, and a reaction he did receive.
John and his crew mates stared on in silent awe as they saw the distress flag lower from the image of a square with a ball above it, to an ink black flag with a skull and bones flying proudly over the ship’s white sails. They were all soon pried from their astonishment by the broken scream of one of their fellow men that caused the lot of them all began imitating the rats.
“John, I’ve regressed. That’s fairly obvious. I don’t want to discuss why I did it, but I did… Can you, can you do me a favour John?”
“My… you are a very brave man, Watson. How you survived this... You have a will of iron.” His hand lingered over the scar for a while longer, the feel of how Sherlock’s fingers slowly warmed against his skin caused John’s heart beat in his throat.
He could not seem to help the smile that appeared on his face as he made his way along the sea-stained wood, and sat down beside him.
Of course, the man wouldn’t tell him, why would he trap him in here to divulge actual useful information? God, this entire ship must rehearse their dramas daily for practice.
John was suddenly gripped by the lapel of his jacket and was forcefully grabbed to be just a breath away from Sherlock’s face.
He finally turned his attention back to his phone when he heard the unceremonious screams of Greg on the other end.
“Your loyalty will be the death of you, Watson. I’m only here to give you fair warning of that.” He had just made his way out the door, and John went to close it with a sharp thud when Lestrade’s boot stopped it.
The slightest hint of a smile graced Sherlock’s features as his hand moved to rest along his shoulder. Light brushes of his fingers against the dark marks on his skin, and the swift return of the feeling just a moment later gave him some relief that John was still alright.
His men made a collective cheer and wished him the same. Sherlock began to make his way out, but not before signaling for John to join him.
John was quick to rush over to the injured man; placing a cautionary hand on his shoulder should he faint, while leading him to the cot along with the chair in his free hand. He soon took Holmes’ shaking fingers into his own, looking over the injury with scrutiny as he managed to pick out a few of the larger pieces with his fingers. It only became more difficult when he reached for his spectacles and tweezers and began the strenuous process of picking out the leftovers and avoiding the sensitive skin.
The light brush of calloused fingers across his scalp stirred Sherlock from an exhausted slumber as he looked up to see the heavenly glow of sunlight that surrounded the face that he had unconsciously memorized down to the last miniscule detail. His hand moved to reach up and rested a gentle palm against John’s cheek, which he instantly leaned into. The delicate movement of his fingers traced over the gentle outline of his jaw while unintentionally he drew John closer, and John hardly objected.
“Yes, I guess that’s what I’m attempting to say,” He finally had to take a seat beside the bed as he took another glance at Sherlock to see if he was opposed to the idea or not.
“that is where you are wrong, Dr. Watson. I have been Holmes’ partner longer than you; I have seen more than I have cared to in the many days I’ve accompanied that man and I can tell you that you have no clue what you are getting into.”
The only reason Sherlock had offered to get the groceries was due to the strange way John acted that morning; Over breakfast, there was hardly a word exchanged between them while John cooked. That was relatively normal, except when he placed the plates down and began eating, Sherlock looked up often to find John looking at him with a saddened expression that he never dropped until Sherlock grew uncomfortable enough to offer to get groceries, just to see John smile a little.
He endeavored to sit up and slid his hand beneath the blanket that protected his modesty, and allowed his fingers to brush against his now abundantly alive length that gave the impression that he had just touched a burning ember, and he swiftly withdrew his hand. Never in all his days had he held such a potent reaction without a significant cause to it.
“Oh, shut up” He let a smile show up as he gave a pat to Sherlock’s closest hand. He looked down for a moment to watch as Sherlock’s fingers twitched only slightly at the touch.
He moved to sit down in the living room, and momentarily muted the television, much to Rosie’s displeasure.
Victor lifted his head just slightly for Sherlock to see the slightly dazed look that one usually received during a tremendously intimate act, and many tended to become violent if such a process was interrupted, but not Victor. It was another reason he felt so terrible.
He dared not to keep his touches more than a slow and light stroke of the hand against his aching cock, as whatever caused this sudden need that rumbled deep within him wanted it out as quickly as possible, and that was not what he needed quite at the moment.
John simply grinned and pressed another quick kiss to his lips. “I hardly think it’s trouble to see you smile.”
His movements were swift and elegant, seeming to float rather than walk as he stood in front of the shorter man and looked him over. Paying no mind to the screams around them. “Join my crew.”
While that would have been an unusually pleasant experience to see a familiar face in the wilderness of London, now was not the best of times to see the man.
Mycroft expectantly turned his attention back to Sherlock to explain the strange, short man that had just escaped from his cabin, but Sherlock cut him to the chase. “He’s... He’s a doctor we took prisoner, from a ship we raided a few days ago.”
“Sherlock, I didn’t… you can’t just… Ugh, just forget it.” He stood up from his chair and scraped the rest of his forgotten breakfast into the bin before he walked upstairs to get dressed for the day.
Sherlock let out a small huff and crossed his arms once again, his body finally acclimating into its normal contorted position of really only his torso left in the chair. “Not really, but it was nice to have confirmation of my deductions… Must we do this now?”
John made his way into the kitchen and slammed the refrigerator door closed before Sherlock could grab the milk.
John looked around to see the men do their best to run and hide from what was surely to come, while he only stood in his place, frozen as he watched the ships be pulled towards one another. The strenuous sound of pulling ropes and scraping wood against wood only deepened the pit that had found its way within his stomach.
John hardly believed he could take another of his deductions, yet he appealed his request. He soon turned to face the man once again and looked into those eyes of striking blue, which drew him in every chance they could. Holding his attention with care as Sherlock placed his hand on his shoulder once more.
“Damn it, Lestrade! If you had just listened to me about the likelihood of him running, this wouldn’t have happened!”
A cruel grin grew on the man’s lips when he watched as the wheels begin to spin out of control in John’s head.
Sherlock was peacefully asleep in bed with his body pressed to John’s in search of warmth under the thin blanket. His leg intertwined over John’s to keep them together with his restful face pressed into the crook of John’s neck. The definition of heavenly in John’s eyes.
The two curled up together underneath the covers as John ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and Sherlock ran his thumb over the smooth skin of John’s arm.
Sherlock merely let out a hum as his fingers ran across the glands of John’s penis. The shockingly cool touch from his fingers ripped a gasp from his throat and caused his hips to buck into his hand. His face grew red from embarrassment at how sensitive he was just from his touch.
“John, I really am fine… Thank you.” He wiped away a dried tear from his face with the back of his hand before he rested his forehead on John’s shoulder.
John let out a pained groan as he let his body fall from using the weight of his arms to hold himself up. The struggle to decide whether he wanted to hold Sherlock’s head down to keep him from moving away was almost overpowering before Sherlock finally gave him what he wanted and took him all the way down to the base.
“Oh? And what was this conversation about?” Sherlock soon sat up and rested on his elbow, his free hand kept its place with John’s on his hip.
Victor took a moment to look down at their intertwined hands as he began to take in his words. A slight trembling overcame his hands that Sherlock must have noticed in an instant, but did not bother to comment on. He only sat and waited patiently for Victor to calm himself, which took awhile longer than either expected.
A lack of air drew them away from one another until they rested their foreheads against one another.
Sherlock quickly ran over to the edge and looked to see the man had grabbed onto the ledge of the next building and pulled himself up from the edge. Sherlock felt a shiver run down his neck as he watched him run away.
Victor just had to snort at that, it was quite unusual for merfolk to have any type of facial hair and it often caused many snide jokes towards humans for their centuries of strange evolutions just of the growth of unnecessary hair on their face.
In one languid motion, he raised his sword before he plunged the long thin blade into the peeling floorboards, the sharp sound of cracking wood caused Captain Holmes’ crew to transform from fairly civilised individuals, to blood-thirsty savages as they plundered their way through the ship. Throughout this, John's eyes never left the captain as the man pulled his sword from the wood, turning his back to the chaos to have his eyes lock with John’s once again.
“If you would listen to me, you would have found that out.” He let out a sigh as he lowered the sword and let go of John’s wrist.
“Sherlock, you cannot seriously believe it’s not true. Your life is already far too dangerous as it is, and now you are bringing this man into your life with no knowledge of what he is getting himself into! I could not sit idly by without giving the man some warning out of human decency.”
“Don’t talk about yourself like that! You’ve accomplished more in your life than many others could only ever dream of, and that makes you anything except worthless. This injury doesn’t make you any less of the man you were, especially to the people who care about you.”
Sherlock let out a small sigh and took care to hold onto the icepack that was on his head. He leaned back into his chair as John followed him and continued to dab away the blood that attempted to run down his face.
“I can’t… I can’t work like this, John. There’s no way for me accomplish anything I used to do like this… I don’t, what am I supposed to do now?”
“I… I really didn’t know, John. You always said you weren’t interested in a relationship with men, so I just left it alone.”
John was hauled through the street and back in through the hotel door where he was crudely dropped into one of the many chairs in the foyer. He would have noticed the complete lack of other people that normally lingered within the room, if it were not for being surrounded by Mycroft and his men.
John hesitantly sat across from him on the cot, and momentarily questioned whether Greg chose this seating arrangement prior to John coming in based on how much taller Greg seemed compared to him now.
He had just tucked the book under his arm and swam out of his cave when he was greeted with possibly the most displeasing sight of the day, Mycroft.
The man’s head tilted at the question and let out a low sound that John had to guess was a chuckle. He then received his own question to answer in turn, one that he neither enjoyed, nor wished was said out loud.
“Miss Helen Stoner, yes I know. I see you didn’t get much sleep on the overnight train; would you care for some coffee or tea? I’m sure Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t mind making you one.”
He eventually had to stand up on a chair and wrap his arms around Sherlock to pull him down, he squirmed for a moment, and then went practically catatonic in his arms. As a doctor, he should have been more concerned about that, but he was about to tip the chair over so it didn’t seem prevalent at the moment.
John let down the rope once again and made his way down the rest of the way. The swift drop to the ground was no help to his ankles, but at least he had safely made it to the ground without too much trouble.
“Jesus…” He dropped his bag on the floor, and was somewhat thankful by the loud thud it created when it made contact with the already abused wooden floor.
Again, there was no response from him. The only movement that showed he was still cognitive and not off to his mind palace was that he got the kettle boiling and went to grab a cup and milk.
Sherlock couldn’t help but chuckle before he turned his head to him with a completely blank expression. “Which one are you?”
His head was whipped back to see what had stopped him, he only needed to follow Sherlock’s gaze to see that a group of men had gathered at the front of the prison, with Mycroft at its focal point.
The tingle seemed unnatural for him, possibly even worrying, yet he could not help the instinct that caused him to run his fingers over the soft skin. It made a small smile grow on his face, even if he was not entirely sure of why he had such a reaction.
Sherlock turned his back to the table with John’s arms still around him, and he pushed the two of them back until John fell back onto the settee.
him. Past tense. I'm still living with him because I love him. Present tense. You may attend some of my classes if you wish, Mycroft. I'll be happy to teach you conjugation."
You step back, your chest tightening. The warmth in the bathroom is stifling. Deliberately, Sherlock starts unbuttoning his shirt.
Listen, what happened to me in the lab? - Do you want some sauce with that? - I mean, I hadn't been to the Hollow, so how come I heard those things in there? Fear and stimulus, you said. - You must have been dosed with it elsewhere, when you went to the lab, maybe. You saw those pipes – pretty ancient, leaky as a sieve; and they were carrying the gas, so ... Um, ketchup, was it, or brown? - Hang on: you thought it was in the sugar. You were
You feel like reading Sherlock's notebook again, even though by now you know it by heart – even the random elements, if one can call them random. The chemistry references, the old physics books... You're just reconstructing a man who never existed from scraps and you know it, but still you cannot stop yourself. This is why you try not to give too much unity to what you write. Just blog posts, or your own journal. You cannot give a full portrait of Sherlock, cannot unravel his whole psyche for everyone to read and understand. You don't understand it yourself. Not everything. Not much, in fact. Just scraps.
"Seb... John said I should tell you he's ready to bring you on a tour any time you want. You know, if you want to retrace–"
Silence fell over them, and Victor did nothing to break it. He must have been more nervous than Sherlock had deduced at first. He was stalling. His hand kept twitching towards his phone, never reaching it. Finally, he looked away, staring absently at the window.
You know what the problem is: you are still limp under John's hand. You suppose this would turn off anyone. But John leans in against you, his whole body brushing against yours, his warmth spreading to you everywhere his skin touches yours; his lips hover above your cheek before falling to your mouth. His kiss is soft and deep. It feels like his face is melting into yours, which is a rather strange sensation. You reaffirm your grip on his hand, refusing to let go. John stops trying to get away and instead wraps his fingers around you. His hand is warm. So very warm. He breaks the kiss gently but rests his brow against yours, staying close.
Once the tall, dark-haired man arrived in his room and the door was closed behind him, he went to sit at the large, 18th century wooden desk, and broke the seal with an antique paper knife. The letter opened up before his eyes.
The taller man did not answer. His eyes were blazing, reflecting the fires. Mirrors. Sebastian lit up a cigarette and dragged on it.
His thoughts are clear as he showers, takes a sleeping pill, and gets dressed. He doesn't put his pyjamas on, just jeans and one of his jumpers. One he believes Sherlock liked – or rather, the only one he didn't overtly criticize. As he walks past the dresser, he grabs a notepad and a pen. His handgun is put away in one of the drawers, and John hasn't opened it in weeks. He never intends to open it again – unless Mycroft gets the very bad idea to pay him a surprise visit.
She sat at the table and took off her kerchief and apron. She was wearing a dress the colour of her lips. Her face was painted in the same way it had been that night she had believed to have beaten Sherlock Holmes.
"I won't be of any help if I'm being interrogated and kept under surveillance, Sherlock! Can you imagine the type of questions I would be asked? How do you expect me to answer them, huh?"
"I am sorry you've had to go through all this," Mycroft said as he stood up, signifying the end of the conversation.
After fifteen minutes of roaming in the living-room and trying to understand, he got bored. After 30 minutes, he felt ill at ease. After an hour, he panicked.
Sherlock opened his eyes. The first thing he felt was the wetness on his cheeks. He brought a hand to his face and sighed.
"What do you find so funny?" Sherlock protested. Then, in a quieter voice: "Am I really that laughable?"
Trembling slightly from the passion that was still vibrating throughout his body, Sherlock turned toward the kitchen and caught sight of John. His eyes widened and locked with his partner's. He opened his mouth, and...
As you finished your umpteenth cigarette, you went back to the warmer areas and remembered you were supposed to eat. Your phone vibrated as you headed for the dining car.
John jumped and held his towel into place as he turned to meet eyes with a complete stranger, who'd just entered their flat unannounced. The man was tall and ruddy, his eyes clear, his complexion sanguine. He looked as embarrassed as the doctor felt.
"Good, Sherlock, it's good... breathe more deeply," he murmured while stroking soothing circles with his thumb on the back of the long, white hand that was clutching his.
"Ooh, you changed the setting! I liked the room and the chains, but nice touch, this. The pool, where little Carl died. I stopped him. I can stop John Watson, too. Stop his heart. Would you like that, now, Sherlock?"
Sherlock pouted and then remembered why they had come here. He swallowed with difficulty. John was already more than half naked. He on the other hand was fully clothed. The exact same clothes he had been wearing in the basement, except for the shirt, which he had left there. The one he was now wearing was new. He hadn't even paid attention when he had bought it, and the colour (dark green) didn't fit him at all. Not that he cared much now.
On Tuesdays you and Mary always arrive home around the same time after work. You usually meet her at the door downstairs, or just as she is about to enter the living-room. Today it is the latter and you're surprised to find her looking gleefully at a basket full of appetizing red apples. In fact, she is about to bite into one happily when a sudden sense of dread dawns on you and you cry out:
His heart clenched. Picturing Sherlock gathering his last remaining belongings around the flat, believing that he was leaving him... How must he have felt? It must have been so painful...
"I wonder how attached he was to him if he thought the best idea was to throw himself from the roof of a building in front of his very eyes."
But I was talking about Seb. What I really wanted to say about him... You'll make fun of me for using ellipses in a journal, I know. But if I just cross out the sentence you'll read it anyway, so I don't see the point.
"What?" John asked dumbly. "Of course not! Sherlock, I..." He swallowed, groping for words and finding Sherlock's hands. He laced their fingers unwittingly. "Last night was one of the most intense and the most beautiful experiences of my life." He caught Sherlock's slight pout and added with the trace of a smile: "The others were probably all with you, too."
Hence his surprise and emotion when he had heard Sherlock play it in the middle of the night out of the blue, waking him up from a nightmare. At first he had thought he was still dreaming. Then he had remembered he was living with a madman who played the violin at three in the morning on a regular basis. And for once, he had been terribly grateful to him for disrupting his hellish sleep. Since then, he had taken up the habit of replaying the piece mentally each time he woke up from a nightmare. It soothed him and lulled him back to sleep. He rarely got to the 3rd movement, and even when he did, the frenzied tempo still appeased him, because it was so familiar, like an old friend knocking on your door, and ever since Sherlock had played it, John could almost say it felt like home. A home he hadn't had since his childhood.
Sherlock clicked his tongue in frustration. So what was he supposed to do with his body now? John believed him to be asexual, and Sherlock wasn't sure. He really didn't care. Things were good as they were, except for the fact that John would surely get tired of an empty sex life. So it was easy: Sherlock just had to provide the sex too. It shouldn't be too much trouble. After all, he'd been surprised to enjoy cuddling, so why not sex?
He turned the telly off and got up from the couch. Sherlock sent him a forlorn, pitiful look, and for a second he thought John would give in: he seemed very sorry – and very tempted.
At this very moment John was drowning, and he came back to reality with a start. Right. The dance. This wasn't about wriggling his hips and looking ridiculous and lecherous enough to turn his friend on. This was about giving. Sherlock had felt despoiled of everything when dancing in the palm of Moriarty's hand willingly to save John's life. That dance had been an oversubtle form of rape. And so he couldn't just give his sexiest lap dance – not that he thought he could actually manage one that would prompt arousal and not laughter. It had to be more than that.
"Why are you being so aggressive? I just came to have a little chat," he protested. He was quite good at mimicking his master, John thought gloomily. "And to invite you over," Sebastian added with a smile that did not bode well.
sorry," she replied icily. But there was no venom in her voice. She was going through the top drawer of her dresser, obviously looking for something, and Seb could tell she was only half listening to him.
"No. I didn't. I didn't understand him, or what he had in mind, before our conversation on the rooftop."
? Oh what had he done? John rolled on the bed to get a better look at Sherlock's face. He was breathless and blushing, his brow wet with perspiration, basking in the afterglow of... wait.
"Believe me now? This is my fiancée, Harry Watson. Harry, this is Mr. I-flirt-with-all-and-never-give-up, Sebastian Moran."
"Yes, if you'd like," John interrupted. Then in a louder voice than necessary: "This is a date if you'd like." And to hammer his point in, he took Sherlock's hand in his. His partner glared.
on a case that went wrong. He's worried, just like Lestrade was worried when he came with a case, just like he is probably worried now. People bloody care about you, Sherlock, and it's high time you got used to it!"
Mrs. Hudson frowned slightly as she finished making herself a cuppa. 'There is nothing better than a cuppa to cheer someone up', she thought decidedly.
He hadn't heard from him in months – hell, he'd barely heard from him after he was sent back. They knew they weren't part of the same world anymore. But to think he would be killed less than two years after they had gone their separate ways... Nothing could have prepared him for that.
"You want me to just barge in and kill him? I can't do that. He must have given orders, were he to die in such a way."
Was it true? John had been surprisingly casual about it. Tried to, anyway. He must have been terrified at the time that he'd say the wrong thing and make it worse for Sherlock. Well. He had made better in the end. Much better. But this was still such a mess.
"No you don't," Sherlock cut in, grabbing him by the arm and pulling him back forcefully, pinning him against the wall. "It was just a dream, John."
John spent the day reading the newspaper, mewling every time he wanted Sherlock to turn the page or to fold it, watching TV and drinking tea as Sherlock conducted experiments (John didn't know he'd managed to pluck a few of his hairs and was in fact analysing
John glowered, but reckoned that he did not have much choice. He put the cup down on the dustbin that was next to the vending machine, purposefully not putting it in, and nodded curtly. He truly hoped Sherlock would get the message that he would return, and that the detective would not come after him. The last thing John wanted was for his friend to be in the presence of that maniac again.
It is so dark she wonders where the moon has gone. Still the voice is singing and the violin ripping the silence of the night.
"Thought it'd be fun to play the 'Who's who?' game. That's not very hard, is it? The king who sold his own son to the giant, and the giant playing games with the little prince... The daughter is a harder one. Here's a hint: who cried and cried and cried saying 'Waken, waken, and speak to me!'? Uhm? Perhaps someone who could now say 'Nothing happened to me'.
"Do you have to be so rude?" she dared to protest. Wasn't she the one being rude, barging in like this? "It's not very convincing when you're looking so... old."
As you start drowsing off in your armchair, the grinning skull on the mantelpiece transforms. It is the proud flag of a pirate ship sailing on raging waters among hidden islands that emerge from the mist. At the prow, imperious, stands a little boy with a three-cornered hat and rebellious black curls. All of a sudden cannon fire fill the air and soon the sea is full of flames that dance in the wind. Explosions set the ocean alight, merging the sky and the sea together. As everything is swept away by a gigantic whirl of foam and blaze, you catch the little boy in your arms – and together, you fall.
. He didn't understand why John was suddenly making such a fuss. He didn't understand why it triggered a bitter taste in his mouth, when he should have been glad that John was being so tolerant and open-minded. He didn't understand, didn't understand... And the loss of sense was making his mind spiral right back into a chasm of self-deprecation.
Lestrade wanted to say something but his throat was dry and his teeth, clenched. He met her eyes. His were burning.
John feels rather awkward for having burst in on her like this. He would like very much to hear some more of her conversation, because in all likelihood, she is talking to... But he shouldn't. So he calls out again, playing oblivious.
"You didn't expect me to have extended knowledge on such a subject, did you? And of course I knew you would be having nightmares – come on, John, even you must have known."
He walks off, still ranting, until he's sure John can no longer hear him. Until he's sure nobody is watching him.
Sherlock looked away. He hated this. He hated John for making him feel so inadequate, and not doing anything about it.
John chuckled brokenly, and regretted it straight away, for it increased the nausea about tenfold. Somewhere in the recesses of his mind, he remembered that this was a very common side effect of heroin.
was most interested in. Interested enough to sell him to Moriarty anyway. Sherlock didn't bear him a grudge for it. Moriarty would always have found a way, even if it hadn't involved his own brother giving his archenemy the tools to dig Sherlock's grave.
"Dr. Watson, this is of utmost importance to me. I'm sure Sherlock would understand. Even if he comes back very late, I would like to talk with him as soon as possible. If he is still half the man I knew, he will be more than happy to get a case, even if it is the middle of the night."
Sherlock was so startled he didn't push John away. He felt a tongue tracing the line of his mouth, first the bottom lip, then the upper one, before it ran between both, parting them delicately. A shiver ran down his spine and when John's tongue stroked his, it sent a jolt straight to his groin. Sherlock gasped in surprise, unintentionally allowing John to penetrate further and ravage his mouth. His eyelids fluttered and his legs wobbled under him, but John circled his waist with his free arm before he even had the time to formulate the thought
John smirked, and slowly pushed him back towards the chair, dancing and keeping their bodies just inches apart.
It was with some dread that he watched Ferdinand come out of the shower and down his glass of whisky, exchanging a few words of affection and apology with his wife. It was with more dread though that he watched the man come into the bed and lie down, his head on the pillow right next to the manul, facing him, back to his wife.
John remained silent. He wanted to ask more, wanted to know why he had come back now, what could possibly be worth facing his old demons again. But this was not the venue for this. John almost regretted having asked. Even if Victor had kept his voice down, he felt like they had shared something intimate, and doing so in such a busy, public place, felt wrong.
So he ended up falling asleep in a kitchen chair, his head and crossed arms resting on the wooden table. That's how John found him when he came running up the stairs and burst into their living-room.
"Please make yourself at home," Mary said sarcastically, eliciting a smirk from Irene. "Can I offer you something to drink, perhaps?"
What the... John's hands tightened into fists. Damn Mycroft. Just... Damn him. John got into the car without another word. What if he asked him about the tiger? What could he say? He had probably tried to reach his brother and Sherlock had ignored him. So now he was going to grill John. God, why had he got into this car? What could he possibly tell Mycroft if he asked him to explain the bloody tiger? Make up a case? Tell him it was classified? John snorted. Classified. Right. Nothing was classified for Holmes the elder. What, then?
John stirred and Sherlock froze. He wasn't ready to face him yet. He hadn't found anything to give him. Panicked, he withdrew his hand from the invaluable chest and shrank back, holding his breath. John didn't wake up and Sherlock took the chance to sneak out of the bed and leave the room. He was still stark naked but didn't dare move around his room to get some clothes, for fear of rousing his partner. Looking down at his glistening body still smelling of lavender, he wondered how John could possibly find it attractive. His skin was too white, almost hairless, giving him an androgynous appearance. His limbs were long and awkward, and overall his whole body was rather lanky. His shapes could never be mistaken for a woman's, and John was straight to begin with. Sherlock didn't understand how he could kiss those lips too full and too big for his thin face, how he could look in his eerily clear pupils and still want to hold him.
"For a while," Mary says. "What we wanted to tell you, though, is that we plan on getting a divorce."
Yet this pain is also proof that Sherlock once lived. You close your eyes and let the pain and the inexhaustible, choking affection crush and swallow you.
This time, when the man reached out again towards the manul's fluffy form on his mattress, his gesture seemed more confident, and John quivered when he felt the hand on his back.
"Good." Mycroft interrupted again. So he had. Maybe that would be a good incentive to bring Sherlock back – to remind him of who he was, and to make him hurry and be done with this whole IOU mess and come back to 221B. Come back to John.
Ha ha, the doctor was a funny one! Maybe they'd get along better than he'd thought at first, Jim mused, an avid smile playing on his lips, his face eerily illuminated by the screen light only. But then his face darkened. Well, hopefully the doctor was putting on a show there. He couldn't possibly be stupid enough not to have realized already – even before the Pool – that Sherlock had been stupid and
"Here," Sherlock said, handing her a tissue. "I understand how hard it must be. We had no idea your brother had been arrested today."
Sebastian just glared, then turned away from Jim and went back to the body of the man who'd served as a shield.
Sliding his hand down John's torso and between his legs, Sherlock rested his hand on his hard-on and locked eyes with him.
"Right, forget that. Here." You hand the cash for your drink to the waitress who stands confused for a second before taking it.
"Just let him change the subject," Mary interrupts before your sister can express her disapproval, "so as I was saying, that crib..."
he could hear, not the calm beat that he had heard and felt sometimes as he had fallen asleep on his chest, not even a fluttering heart beat, and thank God because if Sherlock's heart had
, John realized, but he was too engrossed in his lover to stop his ministrations. Sherlock, under the guise of his usual cockiness, was bringing John exactly where he wanted him, evidently hoping he would get carried away and take him on the spur of the moment. Well, that wouldn't happen, John mused with a smile, kissing the hip reverently.
They all laugh at his theatrical outrage, and the rest of the evening is spent in good humour and cheerfulness.
want to draw blood – dear Jim's, but most of all, his own. He wondered absent-mindedly if he was going to live through this. He never thought shame could be so unbearable – he always considered it as something he was absolutely immune to. That is, until he met John. When the doctor's eyes held reproach or, even worse, disappointment, Sherlock started to feel this tingling sensation in the pit of his stomach and the urge to make it all better. But nothing like what he was presently suffering – a burning sensation he wished would
"What the hell?" he shouted as Sherlock rummaged through one of his drawers. Finally he turned, brandishing two leather belts as if they were prizes he'd won by the sweat of his brow. John froze.
Now night had clearly fallen and John was becoming frantic. That bloody car following him was getting on his nerves as well – he'd snapped at one of the women and told her he didn't give a damn about what Mycroft had to say if he didn't help him find his brother first. He'd never follow until he'd found Sherlock.
Just as he thought this, as if it had all been calculated, the doorbell rang. John's breath caught in his throat and he pricked his ears. Above him, the man groaned something and relieved the mattress from his weight.
"I've been looking all morning for something good, but I just don't trust sites and forums, and none of my friends had any recommendations to make. I'm looking for something simple, you know how Harry is. I was surprised she even mentionned going to a restaurant, because she never seemed inclined to go when I asked her out – she said spending money on food you can make yourself is a waste. Of course if I'd known she liked Italian food I would've cooked it for her more often, but.. Anyway, I think a small neighborhood restaurant with regular clients and a cosy atmosphere would be the best... "
"But you would know, wouldn't you?" Sherlock suddenly cut in, eyeing Elsie. "That he isn't especially gay friendly."
in his room. John cursed under his breath. His mobile phone was in his room, too. Yup, with the tiger. Great, just great. Maybe he could try to break into Mrs. Hudson's flat (she was away at her sister's for a few days) and call Sherlock – or Mycroft, because Sherlock never answered his phone anyway, and especially not when he'd just disappeared without prior notice.
Ah. Here comes his cab already. You close your eyes for a second, preparing yourself for this. Then you dial his number. John, dear John, always rushing to your side... but not this time.
Then you must believe me when I tell you this too: there is much that I cannot give you, but all that is left can be yours. It doesn't matter if you live with another man, or woman. It doesn't matter what life you lead. I want you to remember this. Remember that I will always be there for you, and..." You sigh. "I'm not good at this, am I?" She chuckles. A soft smile spreads across your face and you go on, your voice assured: "Mary. Even if you are no longer my wife, and even if you marry someone else... I love you with all the love I can give you."
"Oh, I'm terribly sorry miss, I wasn't paying attention and I'm so late you see, please do accept my apologies."
It had taken Sherlock less than an hour to read the documents and deduce that Mortimer Tregennis had used Leon Sterndale's poison to murder his own sister. Since his deduction, Sherlock had been pacing the room, feeling like it had turned suddenly into the worst possible cage.
But Sherlock Holmes was a child, and a virgin. She wasn't so sure about the "child" part, now, and definitely wished she could put an end to the "virgin" one. But Sherlock was also a genius. A very, very lonely genius, who had apparently been completely impervious to anyone's kindness or love before he'd met John Watson. From what Moriarty had told Irene, the landlady, the D.I., and the silly mortuary worker had not especially changed when John had burst into Sherlock's life. But the consulting detective's perception of them had started to change.
That was a little sharp. Well, it's a good thing, though. Naturally. It is much better that way. Desire is messy and irrational anyway. Not your area. Relationships are dull.
"If he had been charged with the murder of Jim Moriarty and every other deed the consulting criminal managed to blame him for, would you have stood up for him and remained by his side until the end?"
Sherlock played the violin, but he never sang. Probably never would have. Still, you wonder how his voice would have sounded if he had sung. Not necessarily while playing, but...
John was completely knocked out and wondered if all orgasms would be that good with Sherlock – they seemed to be getting better and better, more intense every time – and as of now, he'd been taken by surprise. He noticed after a while that they had fallen to the floor, and that they'd made a mess, ejaculating all over the few clothes they were wearing. He smiled, burying his face in black curls and a black coat smelling of lavender and both their most intimate scents mingled. Sherlock held him tight, and John hugged back, wondering if the detective's great after-sex remark today would be about getting his coat to the cleaners. But...
"What are you so upset about? You got in successfully, you did not come to harm, neither did I, and we managed to get some precious information."
"I am. I thought I wouldn't be that impatient to have something screaming and crying and drooling and pooping in the flat, but I've grown rather tired of the kicking and now I'm really looking forward to having it out of my belly."
Silence. John says nothing, but he doesn't lie down either. For a second you think he might leave the room.
"... was his accomplice in this crime. They must have planned it together, in fact. It was stupid of the police not to think that a plumber would have no idea where the jewellery was hidden: he would've had to rummage through the whole room in order to find it, but only the bureau had been forced open."
fell to Sherlock's hipbone, while he wrapped an arm around his waist. Sherlock moaned softly and arched his back as John pressed his fingers into the sensitive spot in the crook of it.
Since John was obviously sulking already, Sherlock thought he couldn't do much more harm if he were to jump onto the bed and curl up around the smaller cat in an attempt at spooning. So he did. John jolted and mewled protestingly. They rolled on the mattress, fighting – the manul answering the tiger's playful touch with teeth and claws, then suddenly realizing it and recoiling in remorseful fright.
"I... I am being blackmailed," she whispered, looking around as if someone could have been listening.
"I said no prohibited area. And nipple-teasing is pleasurable. I just don't like it because... I just don't like it."
"We believe that the inculpation of the plumber John Horner was a mistake," Sherlock replied evenly. John blinked in confusion.
. Would it, conversely, annoy John as well, if he were to let Mrs. Hudson pamper him? It was worth a try. Observing his flatmate from the corner of his eyes, he smiled up sweetly at his landlady and purred.
John turned crimson but was too happy to feel embarrassed or offended. Sherlock took his hand gingerly (or maybe, rather groggily).
Eyes closed, Sherlock was so intensely engaged in his playing that he didn't hear his friend coming. As he drew the last notes of the
Now he's paying attention. "I imagine it is better for the crib to be on the first floor, near the bathroom and toilet and kitchen."
"For... being curt," John finished lamely. He swore if Sherlock's look became any more intense, he'd–
"You didn't ask me if I was fine," John remarked, more to himself than to his partner. Sherlock arched an eyebrow.
"It was just a suggestion, John, considering you are more used to this than me. Well, not this specifically, obviously, but..."
"Well, you didn't keep it up for long," Sherlock commented as he sneaked a hand under the pillow and took out his scarf. John gaped.
"And then the girl screams her head off when she sees him – a man she has never seen before ... unless she had seen him before."
He averted his gaze in annoyance, and seeing the light pink tinge spreading across his cheekbones, John had to resist the urge to smother him with kisses.
Dreaming about Sherlock the previous night must have set her on edge. She didn't dream about him that often – actually, she didn't dream very often. Yet it had all felt so real. She could almost hear his voice, even now.
Mycroft again. If he intends to meddle so much, why can't he ensure that the people he talks to don't feel murderous and betrayed after he has talked to them?
Sherlock shivered and pressed John closer to him, unintentionally rubbing their erections against each other. They gasped in unison.
Moriarty turned and he locked eyes with him. Strip dancing it would be, then. He swallowed with difficulty. And then got on with it.
"I wish I could hear you," John whispered, and he slipped his hand under Sherlock's shirt to rest it on his abdomen. Sherlock tensed abruptly, reminded of his nemesis's touch, but John's hand drew soothing circles on his belly. His skin was rough, not smooth at all, and yet the caress was so soft it almost made Sherlock cry.
Eliska glared. Irene considered her for a second, her gaze clearly evaluating. She wasn't pretty, but certainly had the quaint charm of ancient queens – imposing, self-assured and contemptuous. Her blond hair and translucent skin should have been too soft and given her a rather faded aspect, but she painted her face most skilfully. A true artist, defining her traits in a mercilessly stunning manner, like the first movie actresses who looked as if they had completely designed their own faces. Yet, Irene could not shake the impression of an irreducible weakness pervading her whole person, negating her finely constructed façade.
John leant in and rested his head on Sherlock's shoulder – he stiffened and his grip tensed a little, but he didn't protest. Breathing in the tousled black curls, John stroked his friend's hand soothingly, running circles with his thumb.
The Golem was running to you. At the last moment you fired and shot him in the right eye. A tearing howl ripped the night.
he pondered, not wanting his partner to make it an excuse to act even more like a jerk on a daily basis. He could picture it so well:
"Me, thinking you were depressed and pining after your ex-girlfriend, calling her over to make things right, and having you reject her again and confess your feelings to me," Sherlock added in a matter-of-fact tone to dispel John's confusion. The hair on John's cheeks bristled and Sherlock had the sudden urge to smother his fluffy face with kisses. He blinked.
"Is this the eating problem again? Look, I told you: this is for your health. You're perfect. You don't need to put on weight aesthetically speaking, I'm just..."
John stared at his screen for a second before he broke into a grin. The man would be the death of him.
Speechless, Sherlock didn't quite know whether he should chase and grill him. When John suddenly popped his head around the door, he started.
"Seb, this is Gregory Lestrade, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard. Greg, this is Sebastian Moran, ex-colonel in the army, who was actually in Afghanistan but whom I had never met before, and who's rich enough to have a private income anyway so who's basically an idler who does what he wants with his time."
Satisfied with his clear choice of wording, Sherlock sat back at the kitchen table under John's nonplussed gaze.
Slowly, John walked up to him. Very gently, he wrapped his arms around him and kissed his chest because he couldn't reach much higher without going on tip-toe. Sherlock's throat tightened even more.
He didn't realize cats did in fact lie on their backs too, when they wanted to play. John just goggled.
"So where are we going?" John asked as they got out of the cab somewhere in Helena's neighbourdhood.
"You know," he murmurs, "I've been wanting to apologize to you. For not having seen through it all that day when you called me from the roof."
You're not. You never were. I don't know if you bugged your grave, so I'll write it again here in case you never heard: you are the best human being I ever met. The most human. I do not only admire your brain, but your heart too. Because no matter what you or Mycroft say on the matter, you do have one. You're a great man, Sherlock.
"I wasn't on duty," Sherlock replied smoothly, and it wasn't exactly a lie, if by duty you understood
"Well... Yeah. Maybe not newlyweds, it doesn't feel new like that. It's comfy. Like you've been living together for quite a while already. And yeah, I can tell you're expecting a baby, with that knitting lying around and those magazines and–"
"Thank you, Hilton," John said, since Sherlock seemed deep in thought, and unlikely to answer at all. Their host smiled meekly, and went back into the house too. John filled his cup with tea, and Sherlock's with coffee.
By now, you are used to it. You close your eyes in resignation as your hands start to feel the sheet again. You're not drowsy enough to transmute it into another, dearer sheet, into another dream...
The hand around his neck starts stroking the throat, then squeezing, until John is compelled to tilt his head back and lift his chin – he desperately wishes he could feel Sherlock's mouth on him, and the insane idea of having recourse to heroine again crosses his mind.
