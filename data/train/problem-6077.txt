"This is going to work Steve" Nat says with determination
“You aren’t fooling anyone Stark, also, there’s a 100% of probability that that Maya friend of yours is involved, either as a victim, a hostage or willingly, and if you are going to do stupid things, you should do stupid things with all the possible intel”
So yeah, she practically had accepted the mission as soon as the name Barton was involved.
“I’m glad I found someone who also speaks my English” she grins at Bruce who flushes slightly, he's definitely not used to the adoration and admiration look that he is receiving from the kid
’ “Oh my god... what am I going to do?”
’ she thinks
please don't mind me, I haven't slept :D so I hope that the mistakes I made aren't too terrible
“Not according to public record, Miss” Tasha climbs up her desk
“How did we ended up with this shift?” Ponytail express asks his partner
“J-just find the cube” he says before walking out of the lab. His blush doesn’t vanish until he is on the other side of the carrier
“Toni! We are losing altitude!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Leave him alone” she sisses
“NATASHA!!!! “ he screams in horror
“Another Asgardian?” Romanov sounds an equal measure of pissed and surprised
“Then suit up”
He looks down the bridge he is currently in and sees the people who try to flee from the hostile alien army
“Oh I see, so you were trying to save her even after she threatened us?”
"Hey, Steve, ever heard of that river in Egypt? DE-Nile?"
“Like you?” he absently-mind asks
"Have a safe trip Bruce"
“Sure, might as well” Unfortunately they don’t answer, Rhodey in the middle of a military assault and Pepper in the plane, watching in shock the destruction in New York.
“Unintelligible” the woman in her arms replies at the same time, laughing
“Thirteen, miss”
“Is that so? Where are we going, Ms. Stark? Where are you taking me?” the woman aks amused by the genius' mischievous behavior
“Guys, none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we don’t close that portal” Nat sounds breathless
"Don't sweat it point break, you didn't break anything, also... I'm not a kid!!" -Tasha Stark at some point
“Right, like what he did in Stuttengard” The mischief god could've fought them in any other place, or just kill innocents for the sake of it without so much show-making, but he didn't
“In that case, we obviously have to save the Super Soldier” Rhodey
“It predates any known Mandarin attack, the incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide. The heat signature is remarkably similar, 3,000 degree Celsius” the report shows a man in the US army
“Oh my god” he says closing the back door “I knew you were still alive! Oh, wow, Can I just say, Miss, if it’s not too much trouble... I’m your and Iron Man’s biggest fan”
“Fucking hot ass zombies!” Rhodey adds repulsing another, he can’t take the President by himself, that's how critical the situation is, even the Hulk has trouble keeping up with the soldiers, his problem being the extreme temperatures they can reach, burning him greatly. Clint gets an idea and grabs an armor that’s flying near, by its feet, he climbs to it’s back with great effort and talks into the AI's comms
"That was classified" Clint practically vaporizes his fellow spy with his eyes
“Okay, so I was poisoned?”
“Of couse sweetheart, I leave tomorrow morning, see ya my beautiful bride” she hangs up right there so she can keep having the last word, it’s a game they have since MIT, Nat looks at her with an amused smile
If you suffer anxiety and/or depression and/or panic attacks like me, I want you to know that you are not alone, and it's okay, find help, don't push your own limits unless you want to and breath deeply when you feel like that. But mostly, my recommendation is to talk to a specialist (psychologist or psychiatrist) who can help you get better at handle it.
Tasha raises an eyebrow a smug expression in her features, Steve looks at her sheepishly, he's definitely not used to fame
"Is just... I don’t trust this guy, see? He’s got another guy with him, and he’s shifty” Tasha rolls her eyes
“Sure..” she says a little hesitant
And all the stars were shining bright
When she comes back, she is tied to what at some point was a bed, her hands are on each side of her head and the world spins a little before focusing on one known person
’ expression showing, the woman sighs, stands and walks to her “Look, a lot has happened Tash, but I’m close... EXTREMIS is practically stabilized just...”
“I hit him really hard in the head” she deadpans and Tasha snorts
Also, I uploaded a prequel for Not a kid, if you guys are interested and I’ll continue this fic as soon as I finish writing chapter 10 :D
And then I kissed her
That man was Clint Barton, also known as Hawkeye. Tasha helped him of course and even gave him new arrows in exchange for an explanation of why and how he managed to get inside the house.
“Fine, see that red lever? It’ll slow the rotors down enough for me to get out, just trust me and wait for my word” she says while entering the turbine. Steve jumps next to the lever and waits
Tasha turns to her friends before she can say something though, she is hug-tackled by Steve
“Is that-?”
“Six people died right?” Harley nods, Tasha keeps looking at the walls “Including Chad Davis” the kid makes an affirmative noise again “That doesn’t make sense” she sits next to him “Think about it, six dead, only five shadows”
"I said I have a plan, not a miracle"
“So... Thor is inside the containment cell somewhere down there, Bruce jumped of the Hellicarrier trying to play catch with a jet, I lost my chance to see the Hulk...” she pouts quietly “Loki escaped and Coulson...” her voice almost breaks at the last one
“The house party protocol, miss?”
“You know I can help” she exclaims as quietly as possibly “Just ask, I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile suit, I...I got a bomb disposal, it even catches explosions mid-air”
“How about...losers invite dinner?” she grins
“Of course you don’t remember, you were drunk, so drunk in fact you flirted with him, and he was all over you, it was creepy, let me tell you. Anyway with Pepper, first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it’s like, getting weird, he’s showing her.... his big brain” Tasha almost chokes at that
“The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig’s reports on the Tesseract. But it’s gonna take weeks to process” Bruce low-key whines
“Barely, we are going to the main house, catch us as fast as you can! You are not going to believe this”
“Guys... please stay focus” is all Steve adds noticing the increasing amount of bantering in the middle of the battle. He heads to a couple of police officers and jumps in the car front of them “I need men in these buildings, there are people inside that can run into the line of fire, you take them through the basement or through the subway. You keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39
“Yeah, it’s gonna be fun”
Soon enough a man appears and starts shooting at him and throwing him grenades, Steve jumps back to the other railing down with Loki’s goons. He starts taking them down, even going as far as to throw one of them off, but with one down, more men enter the room firing, he grabs a gun and starts shooting back at them. In the comms, he can hear Fury considerable shaken
“Hey I experience the downside of mass destruction first-handed, I have the right to say whatever fuck I want” she protests at the same time that Steve’s defends her
“That’s not the point Tash...” he starts but stops once he sees her eyes grow sharp
“Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town, we learned that not only we are not alone but that we are hopelessly, hilariously outgunned” Thor looks like he wants to protest but Fury isn’t done “and Asgardians are not the only one out there right? You’re not the only threat either, the world’s filling with people who can’t be controlled”
“Yeah sure, if Richard here, doesn’t mind.... are you fine with this Dick?” she makes a point of seeing Rhodey dead in the eye, he just smiles awkwardly and agrees, he just knows in how much trouble he is in with the genius “What’s your name princess?”
“I get that you are super in love with this guy and all but couldn’t you call more often? I really need your help here” Happy all but whines
In that year and a half, Clint kept visiting her sometimes when he wasn’t very busy since most of his missions were happening in New York anyway, he just took a suit in one floor of the tower, and Tasha was really fine with that, she liked the company. She went as far as to give him new arrows and upgrades on his bow, which he paid back with tips in security matters and even a bit of self-defense lessons. Soon enough, Barton looked at her like he would look a little sister (or a little pet in his own words), he told her a few missions stories when she couldn't sleep due to nightmares, sharing alcohol or just hot chocolate, on one memorable occasion, he told her when Nat scolded him for letting her drink, Tasha really laughed at that imagining the intimidating Romanov scowling at Clint just for let a 19-year-old drink her own alcohol, it was hilarious. They became close enough that Tasha knew about Laura and the kids and even if she hadn't met them personally, she sent them 5 years worth of Christmas and birthdays presents that month.
“And you are pretty swell for a brat” that prompts a delighted laugh from Tasha
“They aren’t?”
“Um... Switzerland” she says barely stopping the sadness from spilling in her voice, it was the same conference Yinsen told her they met before, the remainder of the old man clutching her heart
“Happy, Happy, you don’t want my help to woo Pepper okay? You can do that on your own, remember how I tried? And failed? Miserably at that? Yeah, you can do that alone” she makes a pause, then “A giant brain really?"
“Trust me, I’ve thinking about it as well, but for the time being, she is a civilian, and apparently, she is also Tasha’s friend, she asked me to protect her before, and I don’t want to disappoint her” Steve says in his best Captain’s voice “It would be a good time to question her motives you know? Give her a sense of security” he adds just so the agent knows that he’s prepared for anything
“Miss, I took off the arc reactor but the device is already self-sustained” JARVIS announce her, not exactly the good news she was hoping for
“That is so much better than stupid Iron Patriot” she mutters, she then takes an unexpected turn as she sees an event covered up by some local media. She enters into a news ban and she cuts the broadcast sound as an old man with ridicously big glasses cheers a model on, she moves to the computer and checks the net speed: horribly slow “Huh... well that ain’t gonna cut it” she can hear the door being open and the cameraman talking to her
“Well, now, that is an appropriate question, the ground floor, actually, of a proposal I’m putting together myself. It’s a privately funded think tank called Advance Idea Mechanics” he explains while offering two cards to the scientists
“Yeah? What? You're planning on redoing your suits?”
“He does... but what he also got is an ACME dynamite kit that it’s gonna blow up in his face and I’m gonna be there when it does” she grins and Bruce half smirks
She was laying in her bed while Natasha was idly drawing little circles in her naked back when she asked her about it "Iron man as a suit powerful so is needed in the field” the spy said while ghosting the young yet scarred skin with her lips “But you are so young котенок” when she called her kitten in Russian, the little Stark couldn't do more than blush “You didn’t tell anyone about your palladium poisoning and that’s not what a team does” Tasha shivered in pleasure at the kiss in her neck “And I do not recommend you throwing your life in any next danger” Tasha pouted but didn’t argue any forward, it was the only night she would ever get with the beautiful spy so she definitely wanted to make the most of it.
“Stark, we’re heading northeast” Black Widow’s voice sound in the comms system
“You are not going alone” Steve says looking severe yet worried
“Toni....” she makes a face at the name
’ she decides, seeing the tense atmosphere
“All the more reasons to hurry up my investigation then”
“When my parents and my butler Jarvis died I was alone, there were aunt Peggy and aunt Angie of course, but...” she pauses, taking a sip from her newly served drink, and Steve makes an acknowledgment sound “I had nothing, then I met Rhodey and with him I was able to go through, he is my honeybear, I don’t know what I’ll do without him” she admits
“Listen, the Pentagon is scared, after New York, aliens... Come on.” just hearing the words sends a shiver down her spine, she can feel her palms starting to sweat and little tremors all over her body, which is ridiculous by the way, she survived kidnapping, a shrapnel, poisoning, betrayal, she is not going to get nervous just because Rhodey mentions some aliens that she destroyed. Except that she does “They need to look strong, stopping the Mandarin is a priority, but it’s not...”
Coulson gets out of one of the tents and calls them
“Okay, first of all, I’m not super in love with Steve, okay? I just.... like him” her ex-bodyguard snorts
“Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity” Loki smugly says
"You helped as well, both of you saved those kids" he says studying his friend's expressions
“Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts”
' and when he tried to suggest he could just put his military suit on, the genius had look at him in a way that made Steve fear for his life. His hair is brushed to the side and a brand new set of cufflinks shine on his shirt (tiny versions of his shield that Tasha gave him as a late Christmas present). Nat gives a look of appreciation, Captain America blends into the crowd very well, she'll have to congratulate Tasha for that later, not only she did a great job planning the party, but the Avenger's outfits as well
“Yeah, well I’m telling you it isn’t, I’ve seen it on the street okay? People are going bang, they’re painting the walls, Maya... you’re kidding yourself” the scientist shows her an old card with the inscription ‘you know who I am’
“Natasha!” Steve yells, he makes another effort to move the tubes without engaging the building, and finally he gets free “I’m coming to get you!”
But Tasha can’t hear it, she just can’t, she is worried and she can’t sit and let down another member of her little and strange family, so she goes out of the room, feeling Steve’s eyes burning her back, so what if she lets him down too? She can’t do it, she can’t play hero when Coulson is potentially dying and Bruce is somewhere in the middle of the fucking United States. Pepper would be mad, and Rhodey as well, because she did something reckless and she is hurt, her entire body hurts. And what can she do anyway? Go alone to punch Loki? No. She’ll just end like Phil. God, he is an idiot, why did he have to take on Loki alone? Why couldn’t he wait for reinforcements? Tasha swears to any god (including Thor) that if Coulson dies, she is going to find the way to revive him just to kill him herself.
“The kid that bullies you at school, what’s his name?”
“Hmmm I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all SHIELD’s secure files” she says zooming into another hologram. The soldier blanks for a beat
“Yeah I’ve had that, sorry who is this?” she can hear the smirk on his face so she knows he just asks to tickle her off or because he really wants to assure himself that she is alive, Tasha would like to think it’s the first option
“Yeah, maybe I don’t deserve her” Steve refuses to talk about Tasha in past tense “But you are wrong, she is already perfect” he answers before tackling him and sending both of them to the abyss, in the fall, both exchange punches and a few low blows, Clint follows their trajectory perched on the Iron suit and at Rhodey’s 'NOW!' scream, he shoots his special detonator bomb at a lower point, the arrow pierce Killian’s shoulder and traps him in a container.
Don't worry, stray kudos and comments will be taken care of
“No more false faces, you guys wanted the Mandarin well... you’re looking right at him” The Avengers take fight stance “It was always me... right from the start... I am the Mandarin!” he shouts before being repulsed away, the guys turn to the side and Steve’s breath stops for a moment, because there is Natasha Stark, breathing heavily with her gauntlets and iron boots on, her hair completely down, more bruises and cuts than anyone could count and a limb on one of her legs
“No sign of cardiac anomaly or unusual brain activity” JARVIS informs her
"Kneel" Loki hisses
“Okay, okay, look, I don’t know anything about Captain America, but I do know about the plan”
Before Steve, before the Avengers, before even Iron Man or Pepper... Natasha Stark had Rhodey
“Ugh, fine” Tasha practically whines “let’s keep them occupied” she heads back to the portal to continue to take enemies down. She hears a primal roar that makes her cringe, when she looks up she immediately regrets it. From the portal, a fucking Chitauri Leviathan flies out carrying hundreds of soldiers
“No... Killian only wants to start a war, I bet he doesn’t even care” she has a displease look on her face “I mean, is it too much to ask for a villain with actual good motives?” Rhodey smiles at her and her easy going attitude
“Ventilation system” he said “you need more security in there” Natasha nodded with a raised eyebrow, quite impressed “As for the reason I’m here and not at SHIELD...” he shrugged “I’m undercover, but some thug shot me; if I go to SHIELD it could raise suspicions. Nat’s been talking high about you, which is something pretty damn amazing in itself, so I wanted to check you out and I thought that this was as a good time than ever right?” he smiled while Tasha cleaned the wound, she awkwardly smiled back
“Yeah right, I thought you stopped all the playgirl stuff, yet there's you doing the walk of shame three weeks ago still all over the news” she almost chockes with her food, the other residents look at her amused but Steve can’t stop feeling an ugly weight in his mind, he still smiles and raises an eyebrow like the others, what would the public (
“That’s the guy Howard and aunt Peggy never shut up about? Thank god they took him out of the ice” Bruce can see a faint blush along with an interested glint on the girl’s face and smiles a little
“I need paramedics in the containment cell NOW! Rogers, Stark if you copy, see me in the debrief room as soon as possible, the situation here is... delicate”
He finds her right next to a stool with a drink on her hand and a group of men surrounding her, investors most likely, and Steve is caught admiring her again, a young woman succeeding in a business dominated by men is no easy task, practically impossible back in the day. She moves a little to the side and now she is full on view so the Captain can see her, his breath suddenly stops, she is gorgeous. Tasha is using a long, red dress, with a halter neck to hide the arc reactor and long length opening that shows her pretty, styled, muscular legs, her hair is tied up in a pony-tail and her back is open until her lower back, her jewelry is gold as some of the decorations on the dress, an inside joke about her being Iron Man
“Talk to me, Harley, tell me what’s happening, give me a full report”
beware... I was half asleep when I wrote this
“Yeah right, kid, I’m gonna have to walk you through rebooting JARVIS’s speech drive, meanwhile, where is he really? Look at the screen and tell me where he is”
The next morning they are found sleeping like that, Steve hugs Tasha and Tasha clings to Steve while being right on top of him, nobody says anything to the pair until is breakfast time and they have to wake them up, Tasha having not quite the mother of hangovers, but one really close to it. Neither Nat nor Clint mentions the compromising situation they founded in, but if they took adorable pictures of a certain genius with a full-size national icon/cap-bear, well only they and Bruce know.
"Not today!" Steve answers and flips, knocking him with his leg, is in that moment when loud music overdrives the Quinjets speakers, blasting in the battlefield
If there's one downside about being a super soldier is the enhanced hearing most of the times, like the ones when he has light sleep yet he actually seeks for rest. Steve rolls in his bed, he wants to sleep, he really wants to, but his senses focus too much in other things like the sounds of the cars on the streets or of the air passing through the vents and among those sounds, he can hear the quiet sobs of someone in the tower.
every kudo, every comment, and every bookmark is treasured and used as inspiration <3
“Guys”
if you like it (or not) I would love to read your opinions! kudos and comments are deeply appreciated :3
“Well, if we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops” she says without missing a beat while looking at a diagram
“This isn’t working Toni!” Rhody screams as he tries to beat a woman that almost burns his hands
“Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem” at the sight of the girl’s eyes, Bruce looks away, he doesn’t know the full potential of that particular weapon, but he isn’t about to discover it
When she tells him, Rhodey just about dies with laughter, literally or at least that what it looks like because he can’t. Just. Stop. Laughing
\o/ --> sends virtual hugs
“Tasha...” Steve calls in an incredulous whisper
let the fluff begin \o/
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
“How are you feeling birdie?” she asks kneeling in front of him
“I can” Barton says getting out of the restroom
I love you all guys <3 <3
“I must be lookin’ real low if a kid's trying to comfort me” he jabs, but his tone is fond and grateful, she sticks her tongue at him
It's almost three o clock in the morning Tasha decides that she is drunk enough to make the question that she had always wanted to make but never dared to do to all of her uncle and aunt
"As a matter of fact, I do..."
“I got you” he whispers, she smiles, everything's momentarily forgotten
“Back from the dead honey” she hears a deep breath from her friend and smiles, he must have gotten the gossip of her house’s unnoticed demolition “Hey tell me something, you ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she’s glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?” Tasha keeps reading the file while driving
“It’s okay Tash, I got you, I got you” a tear from pain because her legs are suffering, escapes from her eye
a.k.a: the one when Tasha Stark dies, again, and still manage to spit on the alien's face
Steve runs as fast as he can and he makes an impressive jump from one side of the bridge to the center of the ship, he climbs to the platform just in time when the cargo stops, barely a few meters away, the platform creaks but Steve pays no mind to it, he climbs to the rail, Tasha streches as much as she can
The elevator stops and the people start to go down, all the other women get out and Tasha stays a little behind to talk to the awkward guy
“Aww thank you, you are so nice... wait... is this your van or someone else is going to come in?”
“I recommend to anyone who can, to take the Hulk out of there in the next minute” he deadpans as he shoots an explosive arrow to the petrol container
Steve opens his eyes, he feels weak, a light hurts him, makes his head cry in protest. He notices that he is stranded to a bed with tubes getting out of him, those tubes carry his blood... that explains the dizziness, he sees the man from before... Killian was it?
I hope you enjoyed it :3
“Take away everywhere that there’s been a Mandarin attack” a lot of points disappears, she checks one by one of the remaining ones until her gaze lands on Tennesse “That, are you sure that’s not one of his?”
“I’m trying to fix this thing, I didn’t know you and the master were gonna blow the place up”
“Last night actually, the packet, Selvig’s notes, the extraction theory papers? I read them all”
Her next stop is a huge work store, where she buys at least three carts in supplies, she has her long wavy hair down covered by a baseball cap and her eyes behind sunglasses, fortunately for her the clerk looks so tired that he doesn’t even look at her. She rents a cheap motel room and takes the matter in her own hands by building different kinds of weapons, tasers, and electric gloves, she did say that she and not Iron Man was going to get The Mandarin after all
“Huh... probably I’m too good for you, also, performance issues you know? It’s completely normal for amateur...” Angry, Loki grabs Tasha by the neck and flings her across the room and, wow that hurts “JARVIS? Anytime now if you please” her voice is strained after the hit, the god goes to her and grabs her by the throat again
“She’ll take both” Tash says cooly, she can’t have anything handed to her since Howard messed up with her trust issues by torturing her when she was three, still, no one can know about that “One to throw away and one to not call” she adds to diverge the attention from her quirks, Maya save both cards “Let me guess, AIM for short?” she says as she sees his shirt with the letters on it
A) First Marvel fic ever
“Well... I hope I’m the man for the job” he was still getting used to having people who look up to him, he didn’t want to admit it but it put a little more pressure on the job
“Actually I am” the redhead from earlier put a set of cuffs in the table and proceeds to subdue Tasha to the table
“What does it power?” Tasha turns the light on and moves aside to let the kid see her armor sitting, the USK gaps in awe “Oh my god.... that’s... is that... Iron Man?... Is Iron Man here?” the words leaves her before she can control them
“Huh... dads... who needs ‘em, I sure coulda live without mine” she bitterly adds “Hey, listen, would you like to be my little brother?”
“Loki’s manipulating you” she says ignoring Banner's question
“Natasha Antonia Stark what the hell do you think you are doing?!” Clint shirks in the comms, she winces, not her best plan, granted, probably they were expecting to only diverted it into the sea and then blow it, but this is better, this way, any stupid alien can see that the Earth is not to take lightly and to better back the fuck off
“Nat, what are you doing?” Barton perplexed voice takes her out of her musings
Up in the space, as the suit starts to freeze, Tasha looks in horror a complete armada, the black space is filled with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster, most of them hang still in the air, some, move swimmingly about; her mind seems to close on itself, all of this... should be theoretically impossible, these monsters shouldn’t exist, and even if they do, they shouldn’t be on Earth for starters. She lets go of the missile, it whistles off into the blackness as she falls back down the portal’s opening, she sees with morbidly satisfaction as the main ship implodes, causing the entire armada to burst into a supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display, Tasha closes her eyes, her suit stops responding alltogether and she’s running out of oxigen, she doesn’t want to die, not yet, not when she finally gets to have her live in order, not when she finally knows her hero, not when said hero looked at her with those perfect blue eyes and cute smile, not when she learn the joy of teasing and flirting the most handsome national icon... a little tear rolls down her cheek , ‘
“Unlike you?” Tasha raises her eyebrow “You just admited that I’m a worthy sidekick, you need me... we’re connected” he says in a total bullshit tone, Tasha snickers
“Where’s the President?” Tasha’s modulated voice sounds through the speakers
"Then lead the way Shellhead" he answers before starting his bike
“So, now you’re just gonna leave me here like my dad? What happened to the ‘be my little brother’ thing?”
) their resident genius can be
“Hey Winghead, so, the good news is that I’m alive...” after listening to Tash, he gets a new resolve, he might not be able to help right now but he still has an idea. Steve goes back to the Phil who is talking to a baby agent “Coulson, let me take Maya Hansen to her hotel” he tells him. Coulson makes a sign to shoo the other man
“A bunch of back-ups?”
“Come on Happy, relax, just secure the perimeter, tell them to go out for a drink or something and trust her good sense”
“Save it, Loki’s gonna keep this fight focused on us and that’s what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Tasha up top, she’s gonna need us...” he interrupts his strategic plan when Bruce appear in a ridiculously small motorbike, getting off, he looks around the city
“We aren’t soldiers” she makes a pause, letting the wall to carry her weight “We aren’t marching at SHIELD’s orders, and I recommend you to not doing it” she almost snarls at the last part
"You are so dramatic sometimes Katniss, I swear" she chuckles "Besides you can't have any pasta without me birdbrain, you know the rules!" she says in mock dismay, the assassins can even see the grin in her voice
Sorry 'bout the shitty summary, but I'm glad that so many people liked the story :D
Iron man climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed, suddenly flings herself through the portal cutting off all of her communications, back on Earth, everybody minus the Avengers cheers and Fury tries without success to call his, practically, niece.
“Good call Nat” Clint adds, they can even see the pout in Tasha’s face
“Not a great plan, mind you. When the others come, and they will, then we’ll come for you” she finishes the rest of her drink and pulls her brand new bracelets
“Tash, Tash, look I’m not trying to be a dic-... dictator...” he composes after seeing kids coming to their table, the girl looks at her smiling
“Hey, Stark...?”
“Erin” the girl looks excited, Rhodey gets close to her and whispers
“Language” Nat snickers, even she is impressed
“Yeah... you know what we need?”
“Are you okay?” Rhodey voice sounds so far away
“Steve?” Pep mutters trying to cheer the genius up
“Mind giving me a lift kiddo?” Clint turns to Tasha who smiles inside her helmet
“Of course not, he went to propose a business partnership, also I’m quite certain that he might be sweet on you instead, he looked very disappointed when I told him you weren’t joining us” Pepper crosses her arms “Thanks for calling by the way, we could go to the city to have breakfast you know?” Tasha winces
"And here I thought you'll be happy to see us" Clint butts into the comms, prompting a delighted laugh out of her "I'm wounded, let's go eat some pasta Nat, we are not wanted here" Tasha rolls her eyes, he's ridiculous
“Are you sure?” Steve asks worriedly
“Well... my mom already left for the dinner, and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers... I guess he won ‘cause that was six years ago” he says in a more timid voice, she crosses her arms
"Shut up Winghead" he takes a page of her book and leers
“Me?”
“Of course! Better clench up Legolas” the smirk is obvious even without seeing her face. He goes to her and passes an arm behind her neck so she can lift him with the armor
This is a mess, the Helicarrier being attacked and all of them fighting like little kids, and the only actual kid by age standards didn’t really intervene, Steve feels bad again remembering the blank expression on Stark’s face, but pushes the feeling for a while, having more urgent matters at the moment. Agent’s Hill voice sounds over the general comms
“Then help me fix it” she turns the card around and shows her a bunch of formulas with her writing
' she told him.
“Tasha!”
To all of you thank you so much, your comments are my inspiration, thank you, everyone, for your kind words, you really help me through this hard time of mine, I love you <3
. They soon arrive at a little sort of outside sanctuary, Tasha looks around “So... what’s the official story here?”
3 doritos later...
“Oh god! I thought that was just a theory” she exclaims a few minutes later in Maya's room, a little soberer up
“That’s exactly the point. That’s Loki’s point, he hit us all right where we live... why?”
“Uh... to town, on each other, probably back in your room, because I also want to see your research" she manages to complete the sentence without eating any words
“As I said, I can’t help you wooing Pepper, but I can ask her to come to dinner and I’ll talk to her about all your redeeming qualities, how about that?” she offers
"Thanks and Steve..." Cap looks at him "Take good care of her, I know Rhodey already gave you the shovel talk..." he groans, awkward was an understatement, but at least it had been better than Pepper's, her talk had been outright terrifying "But just for you to know... if you hurt her in any way well... the Hulk isn't going to be happy, he's quite fond of her you know? and... you really don't want to know how my type of science can affect you" Steve swallows, that last thing legitimately sends chills down his spine
“Stark...” Bruce starts
“Miss, I have an update from Malibu” Tasha ignores Rhodey’s comment in favor of listening to her favorite son “The cranes have finally arrived and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak”
Both spies are flying a Hunter jet, each one, and send short distance missiles to blow the bastard up
“Yeah, mind if you let me catch my breath? just be quiet for a moment” she tenses feeling as if the world closes on her as if she is back to space
“I was expecting to surprise you” Nat’s voice sounds pouty “Hey, we have a situation here”
I hope you like it and I would love to read your thoughts. I wanted to say thank you to all of you and send a special hug to the ones who commented last time.
“Yeah... yeah, I know it’s embarrassing really” she mutters
“Hey!” Tasha pouts, really, both assassins teaming up to tease her? Not cool at all
“True story about fortune cookies: they look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they’re actually an American invention, which is why they’re hollow, full of lies, and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knockoff. The Chinese theatre. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close, and don’t worry, the big one is coming, your graduation”.
“Let her go” Killian sighs
“That should be said to you, don’t hurt your little cute face” she could even see his grin
“Well.. Thor’s taking on a squadron down on 6th”
“Close it” he says quietly, biting his tongue to not call off the order, her sacrifice would be pointless if they get killed by the radiation slipping through the black portal, he knows Romanov follows it as he sees the portal close quickly, he hears a choked sound and can only imagine it comes from Clint, but in all honesty, it could come from any of them.
“Of course Hap, what are friends for? anyway, I got to cut you off, get you taser and stop that evil secretary to steal the printing ink, bye” she cuts her ex-bodyguard before he can start his everyday rant of how Pepper’s the best and is way out of his league, speaking of which... “Hey J, you order what I told you to?”
“Tash, I...” Steve had tried to tell her about the recent, more than friendly, feelings that he had been developing for his best friend, but at that moment the genius had become a death weight as her breath turned more profound, that could only mean one thing: she had fallen asleep. The next morning the youngest member of the group of heroes had the worst hangover, with no recollection of the last night... or at least that was what Steve thought until now... because if what Pepper said was true, and based on Tasha's reaction, that was likely the case, Natasha was sober... so... so... why did she kissed him? and even worst... why did she stop?
“I can’t... I can’t believe it! Rogers, Fucking Captain America is here to... babysit you?” she sends him a look that has him wheezing again, she groans
“What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?"
“Iron patriot wants to meet his brothers and sisters? Thats cute”
“What... what do you want with her?” he slurs, his head is spinning, he doesn’t know how long he has been there “She... she won’t help you”
at her “Okay fine, his mind won’t do that, but common Rhodey! be serious for a second okay? Steve Rogers interested in me? Like that? The man and the others barely see me as a little sister, it's almost a miracle that they take me seriously and that's not even mentioning they treat me like a child”
“That’s all you got?” the woman breaths heavily, Tasha disconnects the gas and it hisses as it gets out “A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?” Stark smirks
“Why?” she asks barely suppressing the chills “JARVIS. Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away from home! I gotta get Steve, I gotta tell him that I’m fine, I gotta...”
“Monkeys? I do not understand” Thor looks puzzled
Steve wishes she didn't take that quite literally
“Yeah, you know what? That’s actually a good idea, I’ll probably build one..,” she gets close to the kid and sits in front of him as she pokes his nose, she won’t admit it but he's quite adorable “So... who’s home?”
“Well... people said these shadows are like the marks of souls going to heaven, except the bomb guy, he went to hell, on account of he didn’t get a shadow and that’s why there’s only five” he makes a pause “You know what this crater reminds me off?”
“Copy that Tash”
“Manipulative? Me? Please Tash, how can I be manipulative? I certainly lack those features, obviously, I don’t have those gorgeous lashes you possess” the girl huffs, it’s not the first time someone calls her a manipulative slut, but honestly? she always does her best to at least earn those insults, not just because she stood someone up “But yes, I know he can be over the top sometimes, he is... well, he is a stage actor, they say his Lear was the toast of Croydon whatever that is, but the point here is that ever since that big dude with the hammer....”
Antonia Stark was a 3-year-old little girl when she first created a circuit board, unfortunately, Howard was unimpressed and proceed to ban her from his lab. She learned what it meant to be strong and to not to cry when weeks after that, her father submitted her to a lot of different tasks, most of them including being handed hot or sharp objects, she was a Stark so she had to be made of Iron. She was 4 when her mother showed her the power of ‘inocence'; the board members of SI didn’t even see it coming, but when she got them to agree to Toni being the youngest stockholder with only a soft voice and her eyelashes, was when the little girl understood that strength and power can have many forms.
(See the end of the chapter for
“There’s only so much I can do Miss when you give the world’s press your home address” JARVIS deadpans and Steve sends her a look, she rolls her eyes. She has a little bit of oil in her face, probably there’s also in her loose bun, her eyes have bags from all the all-nighters and nightmares and her demeanor in general is quite messy. Steve thinks she looks beautiful, her eyes fired up with determination
Her name was also Natasha, even if she went by Natalia, she was really beautiful and young Tasha became infatuated with her, she started being flirty and childish with her. In retrospect, her life was actually really nice at this point, she could deal with her PTSD with the help of JARVIS, Rhodey, Pepper and her aunt Peggy, even if she was in a retirement home, SI and Iron man kept her busy and somehow happy... and then she was dying... again
“Well then, you need to step away” Fury looks at him warningly
"No, we aren't!" Clint whines when he hears Laura's quiet laugh "Stop bullying me, don't you have a damsel in distress that needs your help?" he practically pouts and his wife brush his arm with her hand to comfort him
“Let me go!” and sees him stuggling in the unknonw orange man’s arms
“Hey!” Tasha pouts “I wouldn’t do anything to compromise the virtue of a National Icon” Steve groans at that, the fact that he is used to be trated like a hero and all, doesn’t mean he likes it, of course, Tash is only joking, he can’t help but blush at the connotation of the conversation though. Clint snorts
“Okay, you can see my research, my town though...”
“Okay then...” she whispers, aims at the CMS and fires, the energy from her boosters shatters, sending her and Selvig backward, she has to stabilize herself with her repulsors, yet the device remains unharmed
“Let’s start with that stick of his, it may be magical but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon for comfort”
"And all the information about the terrorist wasn't?" Barton makes a dismissive motion. Nat looks like she wants to say something else, but she stops when she sees the Captain approaching
“Normally I would go for that sort of thing but now... I’m kind of reserving myself” she makes a point to see Steve who isn’t looking at her as he is tossing bags and his shield from behind the couch
“As always Miss, a great pleasure watching you work” the AI deadpans
“Yeah I miss you too... but the way it used to be, now you are off with the super-friends in New York and Captain Perfect and I don’t know what’s going on with you anymore” he complains
“Ugh, you just try to keep them off the streets" she whines prompting a fond grin of the archer, it’s the first time they fight together and he is enjoying it immensely
“It’s just... see, you experience things, and then they’re over and you still can’t explain them, gods, aliens, other dimensions? I’m just a woman in a big can, SI and SHIELD keeps me busy, I’m building almost a suit each month and I could build so much more.... and in honesty, the only reason I haven’t cracked up is probably because everyone moved in, which is great because I love them, they are the best super family ever and I’m lucky of having you and them” Tasha takes her hands kindly and stares at Pepper's eyes intently “But.... I can’t sleep, if I try I get a few hours of rest before a nightmare comes rushing to wake me up in the worst posible way, I keep tinkering with things even after the others went to sleep” Tasha sighs “Nat, Clint, Bruce, Steve and Thor when he is here, they are doing their best and I appreciate that, but threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can’t live without”
“Oh my god! Natasha! You just scared the life out of me!” he caresses her hair and without thinking kisses her forehead, the genius blush is going to be denied to her death and used by Clint as one of his mocking tactics till the end of their days “ I thought... I thought you were...”
“I’ll take that as a compliment”
“I want to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative” the SHIELD director went to her one night after JARVIS allowed him access to the Malibu house and proceeded to explain
“Careful... your Stark is showing”
Steve is fully clothed in a classic black tuxedo complete with a bow and a little white handkerchief on his pocket, he wanted to wear a tie but Tasha... '
“I got over it... just as I hope you’ll get over this” he rolls three orbs and starts them, immediately the worst happens: an image appears... of Steve stranded on a bed with tubes coming of him “Now this is live, I’m not sure if you can tell, but at this moment, we are sucking the super-serum out of the super soldier... perhaps even if you don’t agreee to work with us, you Dad’s serum might be helpful in stabilizing EXTREMIS... you know how the human body has an amount of blood important to the body? Well, even if the process is slow, so we have the chance to take the serum components apart, if he stops having blood on his veins... well I don’t really think even the super body would stand that, but until that point, it’s really just a lot of pain” Tasha fights with her cuffs
“Remind me again how your fortune was made? You have no right to talk here about this” Nicks says and she, and Steve, looks outraged
“So glad to know you trust my fellow spies” she deadpans
It was, surprisingly, the first time she followed an order and she didn’t tell anyone she was Iron-Man
“Hey, doesn’t this looks like that story that you guys told me about? What was it...? ah! the one in Budapest?”
“Yep” she says before kicking a guy in the face. The Avengers also look in awe at the show, all the armors Tasha has created are flying at impressive speed, all the Iron Man suits form a line in front of everyone making a magnificent circle in the sky. Tasha talks into the comms “Merry Christmas everyone”
“Yeah I get that, you two are cute together” Tasha scrunches her nose sweetly “We are already talking so fill me in, what’s going on with Peps?”
"Ten bucks says you're wrong" Fury smirks "There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment" he adds looking at Captain America as he walks away.
“Ms. Stark!” an older and disheveled man calls to her, but she doesn’t take notice until the guy appears right in front of her and her date “Oh wow! Hey, Tasha!” he smiles at both women prompting Tasha to raise an eyebrow. Does she know him? She can’t recall, but of course, with all the booze she had it’s a surprise she can recognize her driver, bodyguard and friend, Happy “Aldrich Killian” the man slightly stutters “I’m a big fan of your work”
’ Steve scowls “You think Fury’s hiding something?”
“Shut it down, Dr. Selvig” she warns her fellow brain-washed scientist
“Excuse me, YOU were worried sick? Who was the one that fell down a fuckin-”
“Well maybe it’s not about guns” Stark knows that Romanov did something else because Steve says
“Thank you Spangles, you are my hero” she whispers drying her cheeks and the rim of her eyes, Steve smiles at her
“You’ll do that for me?” he sounds hopeful and she smiles fondly
“If it’s all the same to you... I’ll have that drink now”
Seeing as Nat has everything in control, Tasha only flies near and shoots any surrounding Chitauri riders, then she makes her way down to land next to Captain America who is fighting more soldiers, she points her hand boosters at his shield, the energy coming off and Cap using it as a reflected beam that takes down nearby Chitauri. Tasha flies again with a blossoming happiness in her chest, she never dreamt of fighting alongside her childhood hero (and new found crush) she’s a little lightheaded, hence not noticing Clint taking down any riders near her, she does notice Hulk and Thor tearing apart one of the Leviathan though.
Thor and Nat enters the lab then, with her eyes on Banner “You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment doctor?” she asks, Bruce looks pissed
“Now, which one of you is Vanessa?” one of the girls answers him “Ah... Nessie... did you know that fortune cookies aren’t even Chinese?” the phrase sounds familiar to the genius so she pokes her head behind the bed, the girl named Vanessa tries to tell him that she is back there but to no avail “They’re made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe” Natasha has enough of it and charge with her gun pointed to the man that looks like the Mandarin but it can't be him
“Stop it! You are gonna freak me out” she snaps feeling as her breath gets knock out, she’s out of oxygen, and her palms are sweaty even in the cold, she stands up and starts walking “Ah man, you did it, didn’t you? Are you happy now?” she asks without really wanting an answer, she just has to get away from that crater, that crater that resembles too much like... too much like... she makes an unhuman effort so she doesn’t run and completely looses it, she takes her jacket, panting, letting herself to finally collapse in the snow, she bends and her face feels the cold soft substance, reminding her that she is on earth, not up there, there are no aliens, she is alright
“What? No, but I do know it’s happening off the coast, something to do with a big boat... I can take you there... oh! And this next bit may include the vice president as well... Is that important?”
“Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag-”
“Bloody hell, bloody hell, look, I’m not moving, you want something? Take it... but I can assure you, that all the guns are fake, cause those wankers wouldn’t trust me with the real ones”
“We’re dead in the air up here, our communications, the location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing, lost my one good eye but I think I had that coming” Fury waits for a beat, he sighs and continues “Yes we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract, but I had a bigger bet, riskier. Tasha knows about this, it was called The Avengers Initiative. An idea of bringing together a group of remarkable people, see if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil believes in that, heroes.”
“Of a living thing” Maya says and proceeds to scowl Happy for touching her plant
“Oh thank god”
“Not fair guys”
“They say he will recover” Steve opts to say, Tasha doesn’t show any signs of listening to him other than nodding slightly “You two seem close” He adds trying to get her to open up, miraculously it works
“The mechanic” she smiles at him “Tasha” she tousles his hair and then adds “You know what keeps going through my head?... Where’s my sandwich?”
“Lets see each other, shall we? When you are back”
“Correct” she says and then speaks to the comms “Hey Widow”
“How’d you know that?”
“See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?”
’ remained untold
“Oh thank god” Steve breaths, he smiles, relief purring from every pore, relief that is cut pretty quickly when he sees that she is not flying.... she is falling, and falling and still falling down to an imminent death, he trembles, the memory of Bucky fresh enough to terrify him
“Miss, may I remind you that you have been awake for 72 hours?” Tasha woosh at the camera but promptly ignores her AI
"Phil's an idiot, are all Captain America fans like that?"
“I thought the beast had wandered off” his smile while talking like that about Bruce almost makes her snap, almost
“I got you! Tash! I got you!, let you go, I’ll catch you” she nods, but the machine moves one more time and both its load and the rail where Steve is, falls down, both of them fall to the sea of fire, in mid-air, however, Tasha sees a familiar looking armor coming to her
“Who?”
“Um... no, I’m planning to threaten you, actually” the god snorts
"Sweetheart, I was going to sleep there anyway" Tasha shoves him making him yelp, Nat only laughs quietly as they walk to their respective cars. Bruce is waiting next to a sports car with a nervous smile on his features, the genius dumps both spies and runs to him, she tilts her head to the right side and looks at him expectantly
“I’m calling it EXTREMIS” Maya tells Tasha as they leave the living room to a more intimate place “It’s for human application, dendritic revitalization, disease prevention, even limb regrowth” she explains, Tasha looks at her in awe
"What is it, agent Sitwell?" Clint asks without even looking back, he also stares at Tasha
“I just did” he says teasing her already disheveled hair “Nat is resting in the living room with Clint, I decided to check on you since JARVIS told me you have been up since 72 hours?”
“Six, high, back, all right” at that moment the shooting begins, a couple of bullets ricochet in the metal behind her and she and Rhodey take cover, luckily for them, those aren't the orange soldiers, just some guards. Tasha shoots three or four times before she takes cover next to Rhodes “See that? Nailed it”
“On it”
Pd. for future reference: Nat--> Romanov,
I'm weak for tiny tony
“Where?” Nat asks raising an eyebrow, she knew Tasha would work fast to know where Loki was but she didn’t expect it to be this fast
“A terrorist, he calls himself ‘The Mandarin’” Tasha answers before taking the call she knew it was comming right after “Hey platypus, the love of my life”
“He went for the bat actually, he should be back soon” Maya deadpans this time, Tasha shudders “No, I need your help”
“I know, but remember the plan princess, we also have to figure out this president, vice-president thing right?” Rhodey urges her, she turns to him as if acknowledging his presence for the first time
C) The first long fic/story I actually finish and I like it
“'A warm light for all mankind’ that was Loki’s jab at Fury about the cube”
Steve keeps falling until the Hulk grabs him and tosses him to the ground just as the multiple bombs explode burning the other half of the regenerating soldiers. An EXTREMIS’ user jumps and destroys the suit Clint’s on, forcing him to jump off it and shoot an arrow through his skull in mid-air, he collapses hard enough to roll a few times. Nat arrives next to them and offers a hand to Steve
“Unfortunately no, please tell me you still got yours” he sounds a bit breathless
“Yes! That’s the name of the guy, he created me” Tasha can feel a headache coming her way “His think tank thinked it up! The pathology of a serial killer, the manipulation of Western iconography” in a second the man loses his accent “Ready for another lesson? Blah blah blah” she supress a shiver “Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life”
“Huh... I’ve kinda been wondering the same thing about you” she feigns innocence
“Well you are not wrong” Iron man voice sounds amused. She tells him what he should look out for and Steve checks everything all over again
“Rogers!” Nat calls at him, the man looks appalled, they send him to look out for the genius and now... Steve thinks that they have every right to be pissed at him yet the spy only hugs him “It’s okay, we are going to find her” he nods, blinking back the tears of worry and despair
“Please tell me there’s no upset husband or boyfriend just about to murder me because that’s the last thing I need”
The next morning, Tasha writes some formulas down in a card as a suggestion to the glitch, she kisses it and lefts it with a note ‘
“Miss... it’s a call from the hospital” it’s how they learn that Happy was injured in an explosion
“So... on the bright side we have Hawkeye back and nobody died, that’s great” Natasha stands from her seat and hugs herself, deep in thought, trying to avoid the little voice in her head saying ‘
“Why were you at the house tonight?” Steve kindly asks to the scientist while driving to the hotel “What was so important that you had to speak to Tash about it?” he can hear as she takes a sharp breath
She sends her repulsors at another bunch of Chitauri soldiers and grinning she adds “Swing up Park, I’m gonna lay ‘em out for you” she swoops down the street causing an alien to crash, then she puts the ones that are following her in view of the Quinjet to let Nat shoot them with the jet’s machine gun.
“Nice... but wait, what about the suit I’m wearing?”
“Pepper, right” Steve bashfully concedes “Tasha is in her workshop if you want to call her over while I finish here”
“He said that huh? Yeah remember to strangle him when he is better” she says with a smile but the worry in her eyes is quite obvious, so obvious that the question leaves his lips before he can contain it
“If I die, Killian, what happens to your hundreds of soldiers?” Tasha has to repress a shudder... she said hundreds right? “What happens to your product? What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?” Killian stops and he sethes, his look is raged and he makes the point to look dead in the eye at Tasha and kill Maya with a gunshot. Stark inhales sharply
“Yeah right, as if I didn't know you”
”Then prove it! Put the hammer down” Natasha feels a wave of panic, (that doesn’t have to do with the feeling of that weapon in her chest, shut up) and tries to stop it
“Have care how you speak, Loki might be beyond reason, but he’s still an Asgardian and he is my brother” the god, Thor, says with a grave voice
“I prepared a flight plan, this was the location “
On the other side of the ship, Rhodey and Nat are shooting soldiers while trying to save the president, they are surrounded because no matter how many times they shoot the EXTREMIS military, the bullets holes heal immediately
“Great, what’s your name?” she asks
’ her eyes say “Hey, I remember the night, not the morning”
“It’s Coulson” she says and puts him on speaker
“What?” '
“It’s not about that Stark, and this is not up for discussion, this is something important and serious, does director Fury knows about this?”
Both the spy and the coronel hold onto one of the borders and jump when it swings next to the President before plunge and create a fire sea, with Nat on one side and Rhodey on the other he cut the cable holding the President and they swing and fall into a bridge, Nat shoots the last cable and the President falls in front of them
TRIGGER WARNING: this chapter has a description of a panic attack, so mind your own triggers.
“I’m seeing them right now honey” she tells him watching as the newly renamed Iron Patriot stands next to the President “I liked war machine by the way, oh Colonel my Colonel did you had to sell them the armor? I mean couldn’t you at least pick another colors?” she acts like she is fainting making her companions to roll their eyes
“You got a minute to live, fill it with words”
“Actually Miss, it is charging, but the power source is questionable, it may not succeed in revitalizing the MARK XLII" JARVIS soothing voice sounds over the phone
’ look to her fellow scientist and he drops it “Fair enough. When I come back though, I’ll come up with something to help you sleep better ‘kay? Your sleeping times are not healthy”
“Clint, tell me when we are close to change your sit, I need to get my weapons ready” Steve can notice the meaningful undertone in that phrase, prompting a shiver to go down his spine, and with good reason, he notices, when she turns to him and while getting her already prepared gun out, she says “So... you seem to be quite worried about our favorite genius, you know, after what happened in the lab...” Steve gulps, the surviving part of his mind prays to God that they arrive at New York soon before Nat actually finds the way to kill a super-soldier
' he thinks
“Aww you got it” The man beams at her
“Talk to me Happy” she follows her friends gaze to a pile of debris “When is a bomb not a bomb?” she finally finds what she is searching for, what her dear friend was looking at the moment of the explosion, a pair of dog tags “Any military victims?” she asks
“This is the Mandarin?” Clint asks incredulously, Rhodey has a face that Tasha can’t stop snickering at
"He's called Loki, he's not from around here, there's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know" Fury says
“Hey, Is your gun up?” from his position, Rhodey can see a lot of soldiers
“It’s a stabilizing agent” she waltz right in basking in the surprise looks “it means that the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD and it can stay open as long as Loki wants” she walks next to Thor and pats him in the arm “No hard feelings point break, you’ve got a mean swing” three pairs of wide eyes follow her walk to the crew “Uh... raise the mid-mast, ship the topsails” she says clearly having her fun. Romanov hides an amused smile “That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn’t notice but we did” the genius looks awfully pleased with herself as she covers her eye and looks around “How in hell does uncle Nick do this?”
“Okay, look, I need to be alone with you someplace not here, it’s urgent” Tasha turns around and start walking to the living room
“Like... this!” she opens her palms but nothing happens, she does it again and still nothing “Aw come on! I swear you are going to be in a puddle of your own blood on the ground in five, four, three...”
“Killian.... nope, I don’t remember that guy” she answers
Steve can’t take his eyes off from the point where Tasha vanished, is full of flames and even though his rational part screams at him, his entire being refuses to believe it. There is no way Natasha Stark could’ve survive this
“I’m teasing Steve, of course you now are going to have your own fan club” there was a glint in her eyes he couldn’t ignore “I do hope you are prepared for all the fangirls" she chuckles, he's at loss just imagining the nightmare that would be, it's not like he doesn't appreciate it, he does, but he just wants to help people, no the recognition that comes with it "I was going to look at some of the footage of the battle with a good bottle of scotch if you want to stay” her ‘
“You are Natasha Stark right? Iron Man’s boss?” Tasha smiles at the little girl, sure, for the public, Iron Man is her bodyguard, the only ones who know about her secret are her closest three friends, the Avengers and just every SHIELD employer
1.- To answer sassbrat1984 question, I made a timeline :3 also thank you so much for your comments <3
“Thanks, it's an honor to meet you as well” she beams at him, thinking how fun her next hours are going to be. Fury enters the room then interrupting Tasha’s train of thought
“I can’t help you, you know? You used to have a moral psychology, you used to have ideals, you wanted to help people and now look at you. You sold yourself. You are making people walking bombs... I mean... what happened to you, Maya?” Tasha shakes her head, she knows what is like to afront the reality of your creations, to see first hand the impact and damage one can cause without even noticing it, she doesn’t want anyone to be like that, she doesn’t want anyone to walk the same path as her “Common, lets make things right, get me out of here” Tasha thinks Maya’s about to reason when a male voice sound at the entrance
“Yeah, to make him stealth mode” Tasha thinks about it for a second
“Are you okay Ms. Stark?” the girl asks, but it also sounds muffled
“Um... nothing actually sir... I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV, you see, I’ve moved on, I found myself a new political patron... and by this time tomorrow, he’ll have your job” Killian looks at one of his henchmen “String him up”
“I don’t remember being ever that easy, this guy packs a wallop” Natasha inwardly chuckle, but her genius and strategist mind already working a mile per hour
“Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it in the first place. It’s a signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war” Thor explains remaining civil
“Thanks for the sandwich, by the way, it was fairly good, the spring was a little rusty and the rest of the materials I’ll make do” Tasha says to Harley as they walk through town “Also, when you said your sister had a watch I was kind of hoping something a little more classy and mature ya know?” the kid laughs as the mechanic sees her borrowed Dora the Explorer watch
“You mean asssitant?” she smirks feeling like herself again
“Yeah? Who might that be? I mean, I know I invited the Mandarin earlier but I didn’t expect him to come so soon” Steve scowls at that, Tasha’s actions were completely stupid and irresponsible
“It’s my pleasure to aid young ladies like yourself” he mocks a knight, going as far as to bow to her, she snorts and laughs
“When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?” Hill asked with a raised eyebrow, Tasha beamed proudly at her
“What? Do you mean like an understudy? No! Absolutely not!” she points the gun at the man “Don’t hurt the face! I’m an actor” she blinks once and then twice because she must have misheard... right? She loads the gun
' is the first thing that comes to his mind when he sees Iron man flying towards the Leviathan. He isn't going to even try to pretend that he isn't worried sick for Tasha, leveling with that thing, bad enough was that she had to go and confront Loki all by herself in the first place, especially after she even called Coulson an idiot for doing so. '
“As you wish Miss, I’ve also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore” JARVIS informs her
Tasha keeps walking on the snow 'till she finds a shelter, she enters it by kicking the door in the most badass way possible. It’s dark inside, but there are a desk and a sofa, she puts her armor on the couch and sits in front of the desk, she is barely getting comfortable when a U.S.K (unidentified small kid) points at her from the doorway, granted, she probably deserves it for trespassing, she raises her hands in mock surrender
She enters to the national security contractors network and writes Rhodey’s info, with a little bit of her hacking skills she is already seeing all the AIM’s information, including some kind of proyect where there are videos of people, she clicks the first one of Chad Davis, then the video of the woman who attacked her earlier... but that's imposible since the woman in the video only has one arm but the one who she fight with had both, the camera cuts to the man who is speaking and she recognizes him... maybe she wasn’t as drunk as everyone thought because that’s definitely Aldrich Killian, next, she watches the video named:
“You really shouldn’t try to lie to Captain America uncle Nick, it’s not nice” she sounds innocent but a smug undertone says otherwise, Fury sends her a look
Natasha Antonia Stark was 12 when Obadiah allowed her to start going to parties, she was the Stark heir so she couldn't be hidden forever. At her 13th birthday she drank alcohol for the first time, nobody was seeing her, she was curious and an older boy named Ty managed to steal some, so why not? she blushed when the other kid praised her for trying it.
(special shout-out to ameve2 (I don't know how to tag sorry :c) for commenting every chapter! thank you I love you too much! <3
Sitting in the Quinjet, Steve is holding a tablet watching the footage of his soon to be teammates, starting with the Hulk, he briefly wonders why would other people want to recreate the serum, also, why would SHIELD want to tinker with one of the most dangerous weapons in history? His musings are interrupted by Coulson’s voice.
“I’ve got him” Clint’s voice is dripping venom so she knows that he’s looking at Loki, seconds later she hears another boom nearby and a manical grin appears in her helmet covered face thinking about the explosive arrows she gave him in their last meeting.
“Are we done here?” Cap deadpans
“What, did you stop for drive-thru? Did you at least bring me something? What the hell took you so long?” she blasts another Chitauri, without even seeing it
“Uh... a little help?” she hears Nat say, she can’t see them, but she prays for them to be alright
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey! What do you think you are doing?” Steve doesn’t raise his voice but he has a firm tone
“Steve, I’m fine, the suit is a bit burnt but I’m fine, I’m fine I just...” she steps out of the armor gently, she doesn’t know if Killian did it on purpose but he did put that much heat to burn some circuits “See? I’m in one piece, all go-” that moment Killian’s cut arm melts the floor and Tasha falls down to the lower level on top of a cargo machine, she screams in pain when a broken pipe pierce her leg
“Doctor Banner... put down the scepter” Steve voice rings in his ears and he sees Tasha looking at him with concerned, Bruce notices a weight in his hands and soon realize that he is holding Loki’s scepter. The tense moment is broken by a beep coming from the computer, the Doctor puts the scepter down and walks to the screen alongside Tasha
“Oh, I’m sorry honeybear, they’re only coded to me, maybe next time yeah? But don’t worry, I got you cover” Tasha goes flying after that, she has to find Steve “Talk to me Widow, where’s Cap?”
“My work?” the girl in her arm asks playfully
“I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I can shut the portal down” Nat’s tired but determined voice reaches her, interrumpting her thoughts
“Tasha? Are you having another attack? I didn’t even mentioned the N word”
“Fine, but we don’t have a transport and I doubt that-” she interrupts herself and looks back at the actor “Hey Ringo! Didn’t you say something about a lovely speedboat?”
“What floor are you going to pal?” he asks the newcomer
“Shut up, you didn’t even were on the ‘80s” Rhodey pouts “All right, WAR MACHINE ROX, with an x, all caps” Tasha faintly hears some chuckles and she laughs as well “Yeah yeah okay”
"Funny, you didn't mention that"
“Let me guess... Killian?”
Sorry, I'm just sooo weak to all of them being friends and loving each other and being good with Tony as well, idk maybe I've just stumble with too many bashing and hateful fics lately, but I really hope you liked it
“Clint and I can look for the boat he talks about, we can take the jet” Nat says feeling the urge in her namesake's voice
Steve Rogers thought he had seen it all, he was a super soldier from the 40's after all, yet here he was, fighting a god in Germany, and why does Iron man sound so funny?
“No, not really, I... It was just... one night... seven years ago” Maya mutters and Tasha closes her eyes briefly as she prepares herself for a world of pain
“And here we are, 7 years later in a dungeon” Maya shakes her head and spin on her chair to give the genius her full attention
“I’m not a kid, old man” Tasha smiles and then assures him “We are going to get back at him, I promise, we’ll stop him”
“I’m sorry, your boss works for the Mandarin ‘
“So... what’s your name?” she asks
"Fuck it! I heard enough, you’re not him, The Mandarin, the real guy, where is he?” the man runs to a couch and sits there
When they land in the Helicarrier Steve meets Agent Romanov and Dr. Banner, for a first impression, he thinks Banner looks like a swell guy despite his initial wariness, he doesn't know what to make of Agent Romanov though, she looks like she could kill you in any way possible while being elegant about it, he is not wrong. After they get inside, the Hellicarrier starts to fly and to reflect the sky, making it invisible at sight. Reluctantly, Steve turns to Fury (who has the smuggest smile in the world) and pays up. Sitwell informs them that Loki is in Germany, not exactly hiding and Steve proceeds to suit up.
“No hard feelings at all sweetheart, in fact... all of this is to thank you, you gave me the greatest gift that anybody’s ever given me... desperation and a sense of purpose... Because, how else would I prove to you... to myself, that I’m better than all those clowns you screw around with?” Tasha rolls her eyes inwardly, so he is one of those persons ‘
“Do you know how did Iron Man got out of the wormhole?” that makes it, that sentence, no, that word makes her snap, she gasps and gets up, she is pale as a paper sheet, with her last breath she whispers
“The relays are intact, what’s our next move?” he can hear her sigh
“I... I’ll try not to let you guys down” she walks away, breaking the contact with Romanov’s hand
“Wait wait, hang on a second, how’s that supposed to be a good news?”
“You should have left your armor on for that” his smirk is frustrating and Tasha has to remind herself to remain calm, over and over again
“Our biggest guns couldn’t touch it” Steve interjects
“Well thats going to be a problem” she flies and grabs the first person “Relax, I’m going to save you... what’s your name?" she looks at her tag "Heather? Hey, listen to me, see that guy? I’m gonna swing by and you’re just gonna grab him, you got it?” the woman can barely answer when Tasha flies down again, the woman screams “Relax, I’m going to electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand, ready? Let's do this, Heather” she manages to grab the other man after two tries “Easy, right? Eleven more to go” she hovers to the next one “Remember that game called barrel of monkeys? Well that’s we’re going to do”
“Right... Army” Tasha flies up towards the portal launching miniature multiple rockets that take down several targets, something like Jericho but tinier, cuter and deadlier, yet her weapon is useless as thousands of Chitauri fly out, she then makes the call to fly down to the city. The army blast things as it goes blowing up cars and buildings causing explosions to rip out all over the city. Soon enough, the Quinjet appears and start shooting aliens
“If Stark still made weapons she would be neck deep in this, yet she isn’t!”
hope you like it, kudos and comments are deeply appreciated
sorry for being MIA, just been in a dark place lately (cofcofcollegecofcof) but I hope I can finish the story before Christmas.
“I just... there were aliens... and the wormhole.... and I couldn’t breath... and then Howard....” she immediately shuts her mouth with the little conscience she has. Steve scowls
“Do we need to worry about that?” in the news Channel there’s a live feed of Tasha’s Malibu house and a missile going straight at it, everyone turns to look at the same time it impacts in the wall, sending all of them backwards with the explosion, Tasha sees Steve flying and before she can even think about it, she sends her Iron Man armor to cover and protect him just at the same time they hit the wall. She coughs once, the air knocked out of her ‘
“There are some agents and Coulson wrapping up inside the mansion” Nat explains
Outside, the last helicopter stops shooting both survivors and retreats, Steve runs to the ruins of the house, only to see that the rest of the Malibu luxurious house isn’t there anymore
“He’s a chunky monkey, let’s get him” she flies close enough that one man can grab him, then she makes her best to decrease the speed as she lets them fall to the sea, all the passengers cheer “Nice work guys!, excellent, good team effort all around, yeah... go us!” she cheers as well “Now... lets go get Steve-” her armor gets hit by a truck and the parts separate “Fuck... that came out of nowhere” she takes her Artificial reality helmet
“That’s two” Tasha claims, her smile erases quickly seeing how it explodes inside the house, she falls helmet first in the floor and grunts, the floor vanish beneath her and she falls to her workshop level, she sees in horror how everything she owns falls to the sea, another two missiles impact the house, destroying it completely. She holds herself grabbing a column, but it’s useless because she is falling. She splashes into the water, with tons of debris collapsing on top of her. A loose cable traps her and drags her to the bottom, she is trapped, and she is drowning, fricking again, she gasps and pants, unsure of what to do, finally she gets herself free from the cable, only to be trapped again by rocks and cement
“He’s not here” he answers, he burns the armor with his hand “Ever tried the jet stream? Speaking of which, go fish” a bomb sounds in the back of the plane and screams follows, to release herself she burns him with one of her beams, she then flies to the back and opens the door just in time to see the last survivor flying through the hole in the aircraft’s wall, she flies right behind her
’? But Tasha said you’re a botanist..” Maya rolls her eyes
“S-Steve?”
"I... just wanted to give you a present back" he stammers a little and the genius' heart melts by the adorable sight Captain America presents. Steve gets a little box from his pocket and gives it to her, Natasha  opens it and is surprised by a necklace with the initials 'NS', the design is a little rough and Tasha has to look him at the idea that has occurred to her
“I’m not walking away when my people need me” is what he says instead because he knows that this neither the time or place to ask her personal questions like that
Steve gets up, done with trying to relax and exits the suit the genius gave to him earlier while the rest of the Tower is being remodeled, he follows the soft sound to the common room and finds a little silhouette in the sofa, he inhales sharply; Tasha is covering her face and if it wasn't because of his special ears, he wouldn't even notice the tiny movements in her shoulders, it's a trait that no person, especially no young person like her, should have. Steve drags his feet in the floor to the couch, aiming to cause enough noise for her to know that he's there but not too much as to startle her. He sits next to her, as close as he needs to feel her freeze for a second, he slowly puts his arms around her, hugging the little body of the genius and starts humming a melody his mother used to sing to him in the nights where his asthma was bad. They stay like that for almost an hour, yet Steve doesn't even feel the time passing until Tasha looks up to him and hugs him back, he feels his heart break just a little, he wants to take her pain away, because she is such a brave and kind person, she offered them a place to live for free for god's sake! and that's not even mentioning the whole almost dying to save the city.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Gary great! Listen I’ve gotta issue here, I’m.... I’m helping Iron Man to chase bad guys okay? And I’m trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files but I don’t have enough juice so I need you to jump on the roof right? Recalibrate the ISDN’s and pump it up by about 40%, all right? It’s a mission. You are going to help me help Iron Man so by process you are helping Iron Man himself, sounds good?” the guy looks like he is all over the moon and nods “Be quiet about it and go” Gary do as told and soon Tasha hears the bumping on the side of the van, she knocks back so he knows that she heard him and gets to work.
2007 New Year’s Eve, Bern, Switzerland - Natasha Stark 16 years old
“Tasha...” Steve makes an effort and he moves some of the cement, Killian takes one piece of iron from the ground and points to his head
“How long?” she doesn’t know if the breathless question comes from the little shock over the news or over the Chitauri bashing her
“Yeah Stark, shawarma date after” the grin Tasha sends his way is worth every bruise in his body
“What kind of situation?”
The Captain follows the trail, jumping over two bridges, he has to shake his head and stabilize himself when he gets to the other side cause he still feels a little bit dizzy, a soldier is going to attack him when an arrow goes through his skull, Hawkeye looks panicked for a minute but then his attention get held up by another AIM guard, they are endless, and with the ones barely injured healing by the minute, the fight is getting harder and harder. Steve sees over the bridge that Tasha is headed to a dangerous stop
oops, my hand slipped. Merry Christmas everyone and Happy New Year :D
“She’s not slowing down!” Thor starts swinging Mjölnir to get her when the Hulk snags Iron man out of the air, both of them crash and slide down a building, he then throws her off him. Steve and Thor run over to her, the Norse god ripping her helmet off. Her eyes are closed and she looks so still and pale that Steve starts to think the worst
"Agent Romanov, did you miss me?” a distorted but clearly excited voice sounds on the comms. Both the Captain and Loki looks up as Tash flies over in the Iron man suit and shoots Loki back to the ground before landing right in front of Steve and taking out all the weaponry. Rogers had seen the armor in the tablet's footage but seeing it up close he has to admit it is actually really impressive. “Make your move reindeer games” there's something weird in the mechanical voice that Steve can't quite put a name to it. At the sight, the mischief god raise his hands in surrender “Good move”
“What’d you see?”
“Mind if I tag along?” Tasha almost chockes again
“Hey, Ms. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy?” She turns glaring at the guy “I’m just saying”
“Can you still see straight?
“You are just a kid! A girl in a big suit of armor, take that off and you are only a little child” He snaps, but his words lose some of the severity because of the furious blush in his face, Nat looks at both of them and raise an eyebrow, Banner partially ignored
Steve rapidly goes back to his teammates to help, uses his shield to hit oncoming Chitauri soldiers, it quickly becomes too much for them though, fortunately after a few minutes a lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast, firing the electricity out of the aliens around them. They're blasted back in a massive shockwave, the Chitauri convulse to then drop dead to the ground. Thor lands right beside them
Surprisingly, Coulson and Fury were first, Steve had been flabbergasted; Clint and Nat only gave him a warning because they trusted that the dear Captain remembered the talk in the Quinjet when they were on their way to fight the alien invasion, Steve remembered; Rhodey was next, he talked like Tasha's old man, almost sobbing about how she had grown so fast; the last person to talk to him was Pepper, and while Steve had yet to find out how she learned about his feelings, the redhead woman put the fear of gods on him, with only a few words and a perfect press smile, he really thought for a second that his body was never going to be found.
“Then why don’t you just build something?” that simple answer makes a lot more sense than anything else really, because yes, she may just be a tiny woman in a can but she is Natasha Antonia Stark, she built MARK I in a cave, she can do it, she can do it everything and all her mind focus on that fact, clearing every despair thought of her head
"So... what's that I hear about our rooms in the Tower?" Clint back-hugs her, teasing her hair relentlessly, Tasha whines by all protest
"Pot, meet kettle" Nat sounds completely amused and Tasha can say with all security that she has missed this, not the battle, but spending time with her favorite spies
“How are we supposed to do this?” Black Widow breathlessly asks looking all over the half-destroyed buildings
“Yeah yeah, hilarious” she rolls her eyes “I thought you brought me here to talk about bussiness? Common, tell me about my baby, is he okay? Are you treating him right Rhodes? Why in hell would you let them change his name?”
“He is currently fighting for his life in what's left of the medical wing” Fury says while entering the room ‘
Trigger warning for mild description of a panic attack
“I’m not overly fond of what follows” Seconds after, a tall, muscular blond enters the Quinjet, grabs Loki and leaves as quickly as he appears
“I’m sorry I am late, I was stuck with some papers” she says while crossing the crystal door
“Deal” the kid whispers
“Stark I’m here” he says into their personal comms
Steve gets close to his fellow teammate and greets him with a little “Iron man” that makes Tasha feel giddy
Nat Romanov is utterly unimpressed
“Probably she is going to the tower first so she changes her suit for a fully functional one” he explains simply, no stopping his suspicious look, he even shares a glance with Nat who sits right in front of Steve, who inwardly cringes at the exchange
Lying in parties like this is easy since people want either her technology, money, body or the three of them. Her word, a fake license, and a couple of dollars is all she needs to get all the alcohol she wants plus all the company she desires, with the added bonus that when she gets wasted, her nightmares stop.
The thing is... she doesn't care, at all, 'cause right now she's getting out of the party with a beautiful woman by her side and everything is great, no one notices that she is not legal yet, nobody even cares, to be precise; she just has to use the same excuse she has been giving to everyone who asks since the year before: ‘
“Oh yeah, that’s awesome, give me a suit, okay?” Rhodey opens his arms waiting for the armor to come, Tasha mockingly pouts
“Nice timing” she says
“You become my little brother! Isn't it obvious?” now is the kid’s turn to raise an eyebrow “Okay fine, what about... salvation. What’s his name?”
In the TV pictures of people dying and screaming are shown, then a older man appears, he has his hair tied in a man bun and is using glasses, his voice is deep and cold when he speaks
I'll keep thinking about doing the other movies, in case you have more suggestions ^^
“Iron Man are you seeing this?” Cap’s voice reaches her and she briefly wonders if he looks as amazed and horrified as he sounds
“A while? Tasha, it has been 2 years since the battle of New York!” she exclaims and the inventor has to avert her gaze
“See that’s cold, but now I got a real job, I’m watching Pepper” Happy inwardly smiles
“A shame, what a pity that even with the super serum you are so proud of you couldn’t even reach her, haven’t this happen before?” Steve glares, his feelings are numb because of the shock, but that doesn’t mean he can’t understand him “Oh yeah, I’ve read all about you, the serum, Erskine, I might not look like it but I also quite enjoy science you know? Ah, the train as well... you don’t really learn from your mistakes do you?” if looks could kill, Aldrich would have been already dead “I would’ve caught her, which only proves... you didn’t deserve her... as you don’t deserve that serum” Steve clenches his fist, what’s left of his blood seems to boil in anger, he runs until he meets Killian halfway and punches him on his face, who takes him by the neck, both his hand and the place where Steve hit him glowing bright orange and tosses him off the bridge, Steve hangs from the floor and impulse himself back to the rail, kicking Killian in the process. Aldrich glows again, his body reaches higher temperatures making him a target to Tasha’s suits that shoot him multiple times, simultaneously repulsing him backwards, the super soldier takes that as an advantage and kicks him again, sending him to another part of the construction, he doesn’t has his shield, but he’ll make it work, he’s still Captain America after all.
“Spangles! When did you return?”
sorry about the small hiatus, it was a crazy week, but I'm back hopefully with a chapter every night.
“I’m talking about the Stark expo you heathen” Steve would never ever admitted it, but he's secretly relieved “Is in 6 months, and it’s important cause I managed to get a hold of two other quite important scientist” her eyes twinkles
"I'm sorry! Steve... I... sorry, I know you don't think of me like that and we are best friends an oh my god, I messed up right? now you're going to hate me, and please don't move out of the tower, I swear we don't even have to talk about this, lets just pretend like it never happened, like last year, and you didn't suppose to know about that, anywayletsjustgosoIcanburymyselfinworkandnotcomeouttillthenextcentuyand-" Steve gently takes her face and presses their lips once again, more confident that his feelings are reciprocated this time and interrupts her rambling that gets to the point of being unintelligible "Wh-what? b-but I thought..."
“You are everything else but old kid, now stop trying to bed a national icon before you make me puke” of course Clint had to decide to be an ass, so what if she did want to bed him? ‘
“No, wait!” she almost yells
Back from the dead :v (and this time I'm talking about me xD)
“Free country” the mechanic takes that as a positive answers and sits down in front of her “All right, where would you like to start?”
“Oh yeah you are the best” she says off-handed
“Of course, Rhodey would make a pretty bride, my bride” she giggles making Steve's heart melt just a little
“And he is not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us” Tasha seems to consider it for a second
Tasha gathers with the Avengers and Coulson as some agents check on the fake Mandarin
“I think... that my boss is working for the Mandarin” Steve has to prevent himself from breaking the wheel from gripping it so strongly “So if you still want to talk about it I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe first”
"Can't right now, I'm busy, you know? planning big robots and Christmas gifts" she says choosing two wines
“Yep, what do I do?”
“Alright, listen up, until we can close that portal up there, we’re gonna use containment” his strategist mind racing to lay down a functional plan in less than seconds “Hawkeye, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything, call out patterns and strays. Iron Man, you got the perimeter, anything gets more than three blocks out you turn it back or you turn it to ash”
“The armor is now at 92%” she unplugs herself from where she was charging her armor
It’s in that moment when the device goes off and the Tesseract energy beams into the sky, forming a dark vortex that opens up letting the Chitauri army to spill out in flying chariots, carrying energy rifles with bayonets on the end
Natasha freefalls down the tower, waiting until a red pod shoots out, it levels with her and laser signal the Colantotte bracelets on her wrists and begins to transform into the new MARK VII suit. It latches onto her body and flies up just before hitting the ground, she reaches the penthouse window in seconds, Loki looks up at her, clearly upset over the fact that she didn't die.
I'm... FREE!!! bye college I'll see you in a month and a half! :D *cries in spanish*
’ is what goes through her mind seeing Maya’s unconscious body a few feet from her, she looks up and sees how the ceiling starts collapsing, next thing she knows is that it falls on top her Iron Man armor, the face plate opens allowing her to see the beautiful face of Steve
If there's one thing everyone should know about Natasha Stark... is that she always raises from the fire...
' were his almost exacts words, after that, Nat had called and before she could tell JARVIS to block the call, he had answered it, the traitor, so Tasha had to listen to the shouting of both spies with the imminent threat that they were going to take the first jet to Malibu, Hulk included because Bruce had to go calm himself down, admittedly she did feel a little bad for that. After them, uncle Nick and Coulson managed to override her no phone calls order to JARVIS (or he betrayed her again) and proceed to scowl her... both of them, hell even Hill told her that that had been a stupid ass move. Tasha groans again as she can feel a spike of pain, good thing she worked a little on her armors before deciding to do her research as a little relaxation therapy. She's certain that the only reason Rhodey and Pepper haven’t call yet, is because the first one has military business to attend to and haven’t even see the news and the other's busy working SI’s way out of her mess, she has a lot more yelling in her nearby future, she sends the holographic images to the bigger projector “Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction”
“You’re supposed to be locating the Tesseract”
2.- This verse exist thanks to this video
“Open it, J” the suit opens and Tasha promptly freezes in the cold
“Nothing?” Tasha tilts her head once more, looking completely innocent as if she hadn’t risked her life just a second ago
“I thought they were your plan B” Tasha ends next to her friend after helping him get rid of the woman and tips her head to the horizon, Rhodey look in that direction and his eyes go wide
“Wait... your performance? Where people died?”
Kudos, comments, suggestions are well received :D
“What’s in for me?”
“What do you want from me?”
Tasha continuously spins the engine, giving it her all, the rotors are propelling properly and fast, making the Hellicarrier level itself and not to fall killing everyone
“Little brother! Or.. is it too fancy term for assistant?” she raises an eyebrow “I need an assistant kid, I also happen to need a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring and a tuna fish sandwich” the kid looks at her funny “What? My house was blown, I’m bleeding and I’m hungry” the boy narrows his eyes
Outside, the Hulk throws two AIM guards off the bridge he is in and one of them falls and starts a mechanism that moves the cargo machine with Tash on top of it
“What’s the story upstairs?” Steve turns to the newcomer
It’s 4:00 in the morning when a ring wakes them completely up
After Stark actually explains to Steve where they have to go, he goes to the medical room where both spies rest, in full uniform and shield now, to call them
sorry I took my sweet time updating this, don't ask me why but ao3 kept crashing on me Dx
Steve's heart is beating a mile per hour, she looks beautiful and he feels so lucky to be able to stand so close to her like this "Oh I just thought that I wanted a dance with my best friend before the new year begins, besides, you looked like you needed to get out of there" Tasha laughs delightedly, they spent so much time together he learned how to read her
“He killed eighty people in two days” beautiful Nat adds, Tasha is really glad to see her again, low key she wonders if she’s going to be impressed with her growth
The soldier looks at the Cap-bear that Tasha gave to him as a Christmas present... together with a box full of Avengers bears, Iron Bear included, and smiles inwardly, she gave them to both of them at dinner, along with a dramatic speech that had Pepper rolling her eyes and Steve almost weeping.
"They are like a vultures Spangles!" she whispers quite amused, she gets closer and Steve can smell her perfume, he blushes a light pink. When the song ends, and before some other suitor can claim a dance with her, he holds her by the hand and guides them to the balcony, is a little chilly so he gives her his coat "Is this another rescue?" Tasha wiggle her eyebrows, he can feel his face hot
“Like a mechanic? You know? If I was building Iron Man and War Machine, I would have added in, um... the retro...”
“This guys are endless!” she says into the comms as she has to protect the President until the unit from SHIELD she asked for arrives
They move again and quickly run up the stairs as someone announce that the broadcast will start shortly, they end up in a platform when Nat’s voice sounds on the comms
“Tash, you got a lot of strings sticking to your tail” Clint amused voice sounds over the others
It's really easy to bond with a person in a really short period of time, so I didn't exactly exaggerate their friendship just to get away with the time frame... at least not too much :v
“I have no idea and honestly I don’t care” she says, having the idea of what the kid wants to talk about
fluffy, fluffy, Steve's POV chapter
“Hey... I might not know a lot about science but I know that you can’t be too hard on yourself, for your intel, you gave your research to a think tank...”
“Yes I can see he is your favorite” Tasha sends her an apologetic look “He was worried about you by the way, how are you feeling, he said you were quite paled when you left”
“Yes, I’ve met them, not so much of a threat though” he smirks
“Actually, is in Miami”
“A Viking funeral huh? Dead by oil, public execution, it has to look like the motives are political” her eyes wander all over the place, making deductions and calculations
“Hey, it's not a big deal okay? Obediah gave me consent... once, and I never did anything I didn’t want to, see? Nothing illegal at all”
“And you’re all about style, aren’t you?” Steve can't stop his eyes from wandering through the petit body in front of him, he definitely doesn’t mean the flirty tone. Tasha still recognizes it and bits her lip subtly but enough to have Rogers' attention
“For real?” she makes an affirmative sound while taking out a wine bottle, maybe Steve won’t be against a little dinner with a little wine? “All right, so she’s meeting up with this scientist, rich guy, handsome, I couldn’t make his face at first right? You know I’m good with faces”
Iron Man swoops down the street, the monster following close, making a disaster of a few buildings still standing, Banner start walking to it
“Cognitive recalibration it seems” he answers with the tiniest grin on his face looking at Nat, Tasha turns to her with a raised eyebrow
"I'm surprised you didn't read it, you read every newspaper" Bruce looks at him suspiciously
“I’ll tell you on the way, can you fly one of those jets?” Steve saw her being co-pilot, but he wonders if they would need a faster jet
“Where? You rented my room” he bitterly says, a twinge of green swirling in his eyes, soon enough he is admitting his dark past “I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone at risk” he turns to Nat “You wanna know my secret to stay calm agent Romanov?! Do you?!”
“Excuse me, what’s questionable about electricity? All right? It’s my suit, and I can’t... I’m gonna... I don’t wanna....” Tasha feels as if the air is getting out of her lungs but not comming in, her palms are sweaty and she has to open the car door to sit on the ground, because it’s not posible, without her suit... without it she just can’t, she can’t and... and..
“He’s adopted” the god concedes and Tasha has to suppress a laughter
“You got me” she looks at the kid’s weapon with curiosity “Nice potato gun, the barrel’s a little long though, between that and the wide gauge it’s probably gonna diminish your FPS...” the kid fires and destroys a cup of glass “okay... point proven... but now you’re out of ammo”
“Don’t worry, I got a ride, I could use a lift though” she doesn’t have the slightest idea of what the spy is talking about
“I... I think I may be malfunctioning Miss”
Tasha start fighting with the thunder god, at some point a lightning hits her and knocks her on her back
“Yeah yeah, tell me something new alright? birdbrain says that every week” she takes a sip of her beer
“You do know I can see your insecurity from a mile away, don't you?" Tasha freezes, she does, after Rhodey, Nat is the second person that can see her and call bullshit the moment she puts her barriers up, perks of knowing someone when they are dying she guesses "You can do this котенок, we believe in you, and we are going to be with you, we'll have your back” Tasha fights back the tears at the endearment and her words of support, she has always been weak at the worry of the people she loves
“Welcome back to the land of the living” Clint greets her from his place on the couch, Nat and Bruce are in the kitchen counter eating, she slides a plate full of food to the genius
“It’s totally fine Miss, I seen to do quite well for a stretch and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry” Tasha chuckles “And Miss, you were right, once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin’s broadcast signal”
“Well, uncomplicate it! Ladies, out of the bed and into the bathroom, come on” both women do as told by the young and armed CEO, at the vision of the man trying to escape, she makes a warning gunshot to the floor, the man stands and she looks at him expectantly “Well?”
“Stalling me won’t change anything”
2014 Avenger’s Tower, New York- Natasha Stark 23 years old
“Okay first of all he was the one who taught me to never trust anyone, he said, and quote ‘never trust anyone Toni, not even the ones smaller than yourself, not even me’ so yeah, that’s a thing” she promptly ignores both of their curious glances over the Toni name “Secondly, he’s a spy, Captain, he’s The Spy, with honorifics and all, his secrets have secrets” she looks at Bruce “Are you going to tell me it doesn’t bug you that he calls us until now and not before?”
“I... uh... well it seems to run on some form of electricity” he answers dropping a little sarcasm in there, somewhat embarrassed that he doesn’t have the slightest idea of what he is looking
“Dead? Why? Because I fell 200 feet?” she separates from him a little and looks at Steve with a love-sick expression that has him blushing as well “I told you before Spangles, didn’t I? You can’t get rid of me that easily” both smile, yet the moment is interrupted by Nat’s not really subtle cough, she shows them a phone
“Wow... that’s... thank you Steve” there’s a knock in the door and the Captain checks the pep hole before opening, there’s a waiter with the food they ordered earlier, he lets him come and almost inmediately after a tall blond man breaks the poor victim’s neck, Steve throws a punch at him, hitting the man on the face, there’s a sharp pain on his neck, he takes his hand to see what is it and it’s an empty seringe, Steve feels a burning sensation on hs skin and sees in horror how the man’s hand is glowing. He goes right to his shield and beats the other with it... right until the world starts being fuzzy, the man knocks him into the floor and then takes Steve by the neck, and how is that even posible?
“No Miss” Tasha sighs and Happy’s holographic body is shown before her
“You okay there Cap?” Steve takes it feeling a little bit dizzy
“Food would be nice, and booze, lots of booze” Tasha laughed but conceded. Moments later they were very drunk and talking away every little thing. By morning it was like they were friends from centuries.
' Steve thinks but doesn't mention it
Tasha clash against the new man and both of them crash in the forest, she stands and keeps her distance from the other god
“She is not dead” Nat tells them, even if it seems that she is saying that to calm herself “She can’t be, the armor went to her so it’s almost certain that she made it out last second” she looks at her two friends “We know her, and she does that, a lot”
The suit opens mechanically for her and she stumbles inside it, JARVIS showing her the interface, she pants, and gasps as the armor closes in her, she falls to her robot knees as she tries to breathe again
“Of course not, I, unlike others, have perfect taste, thank you very much” Rhodey chuckles and Tasha smiles “But I’m gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now and I need your login”
“The one who kills more of this things wins” she answers with a childish tone
“Nope” she exclaims in pain as she injects herself “Forty-eight” she shakes her arm “Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete”
“Ugh shut up Rhodes” Tasha whines
“What?! Oh my god I assaulted a minor” Maya takes some steps back in shock
“Somewhat” Tasha concedes
“I’ll send you an agent to help you with your work then”
"You are right... I don't like it"
“Focus up ladies” she turns to her dear armors “Good evening and welcome to the birthing suite, I am pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass baby brother” she turns to Butterfingers that’s recording everything “Start tight and then go wide, stamp date and time” she whispers without noticing the newcomer watching her behind the reinforcement glass “MARK XLII. Autonomus prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence” everybody prepares itselves as she stands in the center, the man looking at her tenses in expectation “JARVIS... drop my needle if you please” she signals and starts a little dancing as christmas-like music sounds
“JARVIS, any chance you can take me next to the container on Hulk’s side?”
’ before leaving the room, not caring to at least say goodbye
“Stay on my six, cover high and don’t shoot me in the back”
“Some people call me a terrorist, I consider myself a teacher...” her scowl deepens, she can feel her family joining her in the living room “America. Ready for another lesson? In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado the US military wited until the friendly Cheyenne braves had all gone hunting, waited to attack and slaughter the families left behind and claim their land. 39 hours ago, the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked... I did that. A quaint military church filled with wives and children of course, the soldiers were out on manoevres, the braves were away, President Ellis. You continue to resist my attemps to educate you, sir, and now you’ve missed me again” another scene with men yelling while guns fire them “You know who I am, but you don’t know where I am. And you’ll never see me coming” The transmition ends and Tasha lets out a breath she didn’t know she was holding, almost inmidiately after the video, the news begins
“Nuclear deterrent. Cause that always calms everything down” Tasha rolls her eyes
See you in the final!
"You did this?" Steve shifts his weight uncomfortably, he was kind of expecting that she took more time to figure it out
in the meantime, thank you all for your support
“Thor” she replies in automatic, he makes a whatever motion and continues
Tasha/Tash/Toni (in weird occasions)-->Stark
“1,000 feet” she only misses one, she flies as fast as she can to him “400 feet, 200 feet, miss”
“I have an army” Loki proudly says
“What? Hap you called me” she laughs
It was a good thing that Steve didn’t make another bet with Fury because he would have lost miserably after seeing the damned monster that came through the portal. The thing was huge, and practically unreal, without the heavy hitters like the Hulk or Thor it would be impossible for mere humans like them to take it down (Super-serum be damned), at least they had the genius on their side. Speaking of the devil... '
“Is that what just happened?” Steve’s voice shows a little bit of amazement and delight
It's a chapter dedicated to Tony's friendship with Clint and Nat (the prompt that I miss the most since Civil War came into existence, even if I haven't actually seen the movie)
Day and night she worked hard to accomplish that, she didn’t want to sleep anyway, the nightmares about water and her new arc reactor being present almost everytime she closed her eyes. Following the change in SI, she created Mark II, everything was a blur after that. She was almost 18 when she learned about Obie’s betrayal in the worst way possible and it was purely in spite that she dragged herself to her spare arc reactor and went after him.
“Y-yeah?” he asks dreamingly
“Me and Nat if necessary, right Nat?” she turns to the Black Widow who is watching them from the doorframe
“I wanted to say that I’m very sorry about your loss” she truthfully says “But I want to know what you think happened”
“I actually think I need to sleep now, Miss” JARVIS says as the suit powers down
"Agents" he greets the heroes with a polite nod "Director Fury sends me to inform you that Special Agent Coulson is no longer in danger and he's going to be transferred to a special SHIELD hospital, the address' gonna be sent to you as soon as possible, also Director Fury asked me to tell you that you should lay low for a while, for the sake of your safety, just while the debate with the World Security Council ends" the only confirmation he receives is a general hum. But Steve can feel as a weight is lifted from all of them
But there’s no time for reunion since Killian comes back and tackles her, she lands on her back and uses the leverage to kick him to the other side with the help of her thrusters but he drags her, JARVIS capture the signature from Killian’s EXTREMIS and proceeds to shoot, but before that can happen Steve destroys the armor, one of the parts lands next to Tasha and she takes it before using one method Clint and Nat showed her to subdue an enemy, She throws Killian off her along with the device and shoots it, making an amazing explosion.
“I have unfinished business with Loki” Thor informs them
’. The MARK XVII tackles Steve to safety in a lower bridge below and he is hopeless seeing Natasha Stark fall to her doom for the second time.
“Is this Forehead of security?” she answers mocking the way Happy puts the Starkpad at his eye's level
“Hey, I’m here” Steve hugs her and pets her soft hair to get her breathing to stabilize
“Following is not really my style” Cap smirks
(See the end of the chapter for
“Slow down the suction will you?” he asks his scientists “I want him alive for a round of experiments” Alrich then turns to Cap “Look... Tasha is not... she...” he looks down as if he has a hard time choosing the words “She is special alright? And you know that better than anybody... and you should be proud because after the experiments we are going to perform on you... that serum, that perfected EXTREMIS? She is going to have it”
With the god secured in the Quinjet, all of them proceed to return to the Helicarrier, Tasha keeps her eyes on their prisoner the whole time and if she is internally bouncing for being next to her childhood hero, well only she and probably her dear Nat knows about it
“Creating a flight plan for Tennessee” the AI says for all answer, she closes the interface and hears the doorbell, Steve opens her workshop door a few seconds after
“You are wrong Tash, I’m a visionary, but I do own a maniac and he takes the stage tonight” he gets close to her again and touches her face, the CEO doesn’t flinch by pure force of will “I’d love to continue with our business, but I have some important things to do, you know? As an act of goodwill I’ll let you model and construct your own EXTREMIS, how about that? Sounds good, right? see you later love” Killian says as he finally leaves
“And how many can I carry?”
“I like you, you know? A fierce woman, you might be a good addition to the throne..." a little shiver runs down her spine at his words, it doesn't show "but before that, I can assure you, your friends won't even be having time for me, since they’ll be busy fighting you” Loki taps Tasha on her chest with his scepter, a ping sounds the moment the magic staff touches the reactor but nothing happens, Loki tries again but still the energy dissipates doing nothing. “Weird... it usually works” she smirks this time
Natasha Stark is watching Happy in his hospital bed, she had always hated hospitals since she was a kid, they used to represent "accidents" that were actually beatings that went too far; it wasn’t any different now, but for one of her bests friends, she could endure it. She had been there for almost twelve hours, she put every guard she could in the entrance. Happy had been in surgery for a good four hours while the doctors were trying to stabilize him and to stop the internal bleeding, he hadn’t been too close to the explosion... but he hadn't been that far away either. Tasha went through her messages, worried texts from Clint, Bruce, Nat, Pepper, Coulson, and even Uncle Fury. While the nurse checked on her ex-bodyguard, she makes the motion of turning off the TV, Tasha stops her before that
“I’ll be fine but thanks for the confidence vote” the little genius rolls her eyes
(See the end of the chapter for
I wanted to make a special shout out to everyone who comments the series (especially to ameve2, I love you <3 and HinaLuvLuvChan, thank you!!!)
Then I walked her home that night
“Be careful Cap, we don’t want your pretty face getting scrapped” the tone couldn’t be anything else than flirting, he blushes despite Tasha not being able to see him but he still gives as gets
“I.... did I do that?” Maya looks at her, ‘
I just wanted to say... Thank you, everyone, for your kind comments, you really make my day a hundred times better nun
“Don’t move!” she warns
If you know a person that suffers from this, listen to them, ask them how can you help when they have an attack (cause every person deals with them differently) and please, I beg you, be kind to them, is quite hard enough to suffer through this on your own, that you really don't need someone making you feel less or worse.
“Coulson arrived, he is taking care of the remaining soldiers on the other side of the ship along with his baby agents” she looks to all the sides “Where’s Tash?” Steve feels a pain in his chest too big to put it into words, but before anyone can answer, they hear metal bending noises, they turn around and Killian is walking through the flames, quite burned and glowing bright, hot orange, but very alive “You gotta be kidding me” Nat whispers
Natasha groans again
Tasha smiles inside Roger's arms and hugs him back, she also was really worried about him "Anything for you Spangles, anything for you"
She can’t think very well so she goes to the only place where she doesn’t have to after Rhodey’s side: with Nat and Clint.
“But that’s not true, you said so yourself, if you couldn’t control it you wouldn’t be here” she turns to Steve “SHIELD and everybody else should trust him more, much more than uncle Nick any case”
“Shut up, he is a good friend, the best actually, he is taking all your positions one by one since you all keep teasing me, and I’m not going to blow that up for a stupid crush”
“What? Why? No offense Cap, but I don’t really need backup in this” Steve shares a glance with Nat
“Listen, War machine was a little too aggressive, all right? This sends a better message to the community” Tasha sighs
“Loud and clear my dear spider”
Natasha was 10 when her parents and Jarvis died in a car accident. She cried, but only for her mother and her dear butler, even at that age, she understood that Howard was too much of a drunk and beating bastard to deserve her pain. She was 11 when she had to learn to be more mature, she let Obie control SI with the condition that she'd spent time there learning, so she had to divide her time between MIT, socialite life and SI, and if it wasn’t because of Rhodey, aunt Peggy and aunt Angie, she would have probably collapsed.
In my defense... I tried to do it a little bit angsty, I really tried
"... touché"
j-just... one more week x__x *dies*
Sorry I took certain liberties with our dear Captain, he'll be back I promise
“Would you be in time for our science orgy?” she looks hopeful and Bruce chuckles
“Hold on sweetheart” Tasha glares at him they both turn to see the scientist who has a weapon to her neck “Maya...”
“You think I was aiming for the bulb? Come on, you can’t hit a bulb at this distance” she says, Rhodey stands up only to shoot the lamp and shatter it, he sends her a look ”Show off” she mutters. A voice on the speaker alerts everyone about them “Ok, here’s what I’m going to do, save my spot, ready?” she says before standing to take a look and sits down immediately
“What’s that thing on your chest?” oh yeah, she forgot that the general public doesn’t know about her arc reactor, of course, nobody would know about it since nobody knows she is Iron Man
“Well, look, I gotta change it every time certain someone hacks in” the sarcasm is evident even on the phone
“Yeah, a little bit” Rhodey still looks in shock, like he can't believe he spent the last few months looking out for
“Wait... how do you know about that?” Tasha asks
“I don't doubt it and frankly, I don’t think you’ll last the week”
“We located the Tesseract” she says plainly, she looks at the coordinates and adds “I can get there faster...” she starts saying before Thor interjects arguing that the Tesseract belongs to Asgard and only an Asgardian can control it, she rolls her eyes
“It’s an electromagnet... but you should know that, seeing as you got a box of them right here”
"Yeah... both that and the drawing, it's my first time doing jewelry so I hope it's not too bad" he sheepishly admits, Tasha looks back at the box and takes out the neatly folded paper, is a drawing of her working in the armor, with the legend 'To my best friend, genius, billionaire, philanthropist and hero'
Rhodey has to take a moment to compose himself, taking deep breaths and suppressing the giggles that come every time he looks at her, Tasha remains unamused
The rest of the Avengers are flying in the Quinjet to Malibu for a 'Stark intervention' when Bruce calls them, an urgent tone to his voice
“Hey Miss Potts” Steve greets her from the dining room where he is setting the plates
“Common Tash, let’s go up stairs, eat something and then sleep” the genius pouts
“What is this I hear about an orgy? If I weren’t happily married I’ll totally participate” Clint thinks about it for a second and adds “I think I can ask Laura though” Tasha elbows him laughing
“Hi” the nurse makes a startled noise “Hey, do you mind leave that on?”
Tomorrow: Tasha vs Loki for Phil's honor
“We need another strategy” Widow whispers as their foes prepare to attack
To say that Steve Rogers is amazed by the little Stark kid would be an understatement; sure he knew that Howard Stark had a daughter, but he didn’t expect her to be a genius or Iron man, or you know... too young to be both. She claimed that she was 20, but she looks younger, way younger. Her face still holds child-like features, her hair is long and wavy, currently arranged in a messy but cute ponytail, also, she's tiny, like, 'barely reaching Steve’s chin' tiny.
“I think they all made it” she sounds satisfied
Steve chooses that moment to enter the lab and drop a HYDRA rifle on the table, he looks pissed “Phase 2 is SHIELD using the cube to make weapons” he looks over to Tasha, who is very much impressed, and shrugs “Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow to me”
if you are feeling on edge, the attack starts in the phrase "are you okay" and ends on "check the heart"
“Hey! Don’t insult Pepper’s baby” she looks at Steve trying to be severe “It’s not a nice thing to do after she worked so hard on that” she whispers, he feels horrible with himself looking at the pained expression of the girl, which's half fake by the way; sure she's defending Pepper’s 12% fault in the design, but she also knows that not everyone likes it, hell, even Rhodey had mocked her at the time. But she always liked to throw older people who look down at her like this, it seems that Captain America isn’t the exception... as much as it stings
“There’s something I need you guys to see” the agent takes them to a seclude tent, the five of them followed by Maya Hansen' eyes, once inside he talks to the heroes “We used our codes to enter to Stark’s private security... there’s a new message for you agent Romanov, but I need your access code” he pushes at her a tablet with a microphone and Nat proceeds to talk loud and clear
“While I agree with you, I truly want to believe that is actually this easy” she looks at Captain America and grins inside the helmet “Still, you are pretty spry for a capsicle” Steve raises an eyebrow, normally he would get upset over the name calling, but despite the weird and clearly amused tone, he doesn’t hear the type of bite he would expect from any other person
“Mmmm how about never? Yeah, let's go with that” she can feel little tremors that she force to perish by opening and closing her hands inside her pockets “And if you mention the Avengers again I’m so going to throw a snowball to your face” she warns the moment she sees the kid opening his mouth. Seriously, the kid just learned that Iron Man is actually a gorgeous and young female and he just wants to talk about Cap and birdbrain?
“That’s my secret, Captain. I’m always angry” Bruce’s body starts to swell, stretch, get bigger and green. The Hulk smashes the Leviathan right in the nose, managing to flip the creature over 360, letting Tasha, who’s ready with her arm and a rocket out, to shoot to a soft spot. The Leviathan is blown away. Steve raises his shield to block the debris that falls to them, protecting Nat with the same movement, Tasha lands next to them. The Avengers Assemble as more Chitauri soldiers and Leviathans fly out of the portal
“Need any help my lovely deadly spider?” Tasha’s mechanical voice asks
“Well?” Rhodey asks
"You mean, Stark, Banner, and Coulson had so much work they missed Christmas" Nat sees him dead in the eye, a mischievous twinkle in her eyes "I recall you dragging Rogers and myself to the nearest bar to join the festivities" Laura turns to look at her husband
“Yeah right, you know that’s biologically impossible Stark, the human body can’t be without sleep for more than 10 days, and last time I checked, you were still a human and not a cyborg” she rolls her eyes once again “We are concerned about you Tash, I’m concerned about you, maybe it’s a good idea Rogers came with you after all you know?” she looks at him with deep betray in her eyes
“I’m sorry, did you say...?” Steve looks taken back by that, Tasha at least seems a bit embarrassed as she smiles sheepishly
“Bruce?” her voice sounds excited even with the mechanical voice making him smile
“Shoot them in the head, they are like zombies”
“Well it does say Miami, Florida”
“Big Brain and she likes it, here, let me show you” Happy makes a show of putting the SPad in the air, trying to point to the offices, but the only thing Tasha can see is the bodyguard with a focused look, she giggles
“Edifying” Happy says
“Well you sure act like one when it comes to self-preservation” Clint smirks
“I’m sorry what? His what?” she asks containing a hysterical laughter
“I can’t believe I’m saying this, I got a nuke coming in and it’s gonna blow in less than a minute...” her heat sensors find the missile and she puts even more energy in her boots to catch it “And I know just where to put it” she can hear the sharp breath from her teammates, her family, they are thinking the same thing she is. Tasha comes at the missile from behind, it sppeeds on, but so does she, finally she grabs it from behind, gripping it tightly. With a mighty effort she wrenches the rocket off its course, steering it from behind, she accelerates quickly, flying straight up into ths sky, torwards the portal
“Hey!” she greets to whoever calls at her
“Yeah, yeah, him, ever since he fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day, you know what I mean?”
“Oh, so I’m back to be Stark now? What does uncle Nick have to do with anything anyway?”
“Thanks, Nat” she thinks for about a second before saying “Hey, do you and birdbrain want to join the party? I’m going to Mandarin location, in Florida, send you the coords and catch me there?”
