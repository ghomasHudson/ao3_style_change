“It is, but we’ll have to wait at least another twenty years to get it,” Sherlock said. There was a placard displayed prominently from the Ministry of Health, sternly warning that only omegas past childbearing age could be legally served alcohol or coffee.
The stableyard was a milling confusion of men, horses, and dogs, and John took advantage of Mr. Gregson’s red-faced distraction to grab the Earl’s horse. “Here you are, my Lord,” he said, leading him over. “Will this saddle suit?”
“Roscommon Square. Near Paxton Road,” Sherlock muttered and tapped at the computer, bringing up Google street view. He frowned at the screen, leaned back, and steepled his fingers, staring intently at nothing.
“I thought I was so clever,” Sherlock whispered. “I made a dog and I thought Eurus could never get him, because he only existed in my head. But she did. When she came back. She did take him.” The tears were running freely now and he could feel his hands clenching.
When John returned leading Hermes, Sherlock was standing in the mouth of the cave, eyes huge in his white face. He took one look at John and said, “No.
“Exactly,” Mycroft said. Mycroft had recently returned from wherever he had spent the past two years—Sherlock hadn’t bothered to remember—and was as annoying as ever. “And the more of them Sherlock spends productively occupied the better. It’s not as though he’s going to sleep in them.”
“So here’s the situation,” Lestrade said. Sherlock could tell from the pitch of his voice and the relative quiet that he was in his office, tipped back in his chair with his feet on the table. “The Detective Inspector in charge of the case is called MacDougall. She’s new, just made DI about six months ago, and this is her first high-profile case. I doubt she’s going to be keen on a consultant swooping in trying to tell her what to do. But as it happens Donovan knows her from before—they worked together a while back—and so she’s gone to have a word. Donovan thinks she’ll be more likely to listen to her than a more senior inspector
it, so hard he thought it might actually crash out of his chest. He leaned in and this time applied just the tiniest hint of pressure before pulling back. It was still chaste—plausible deniability could be maintained by all sides—but it was, definitely, a kiss. On the lips.
“Don’t bother, I’m fine. You stay and talk to your friends,” and then, as Mick opened his starstruck mouth to ask something else, disappeared into the crowd with surprising speed.
“Yes, and apparently he’s a perfect gentleman, very charming. Viv sometimes gets first-timers—so far in the closet they’ve never been with a man at all—and she says he’s always her first choice, if he’s available. So given your unique circumstances…”
“No. I can’t. Pitts’ view of our relationship is predicated on the belief that I am his possession, something that exists solely for the purpose of providing him with sexual pleasure and offspring. He can’t afford to see me as someone with thoughts and observations of my own, because that threatens his own sense of power. At best he would ignore me; at worst he would punish me.” Sherlock shrugged. “And he probably wouldn’t believe me in any case. You, on the other hand: you’ve clearly gone quite far in establishing yourself as reliable and trustworthy, and a nugget like this will make you quite the fair-haired boy. We both benefit.”
“His brother’s country house. He knows nothing of disposing of bodies so he’ll have pushed her car into the pond.”
“Oh, Christ,  Mycroft! We didn’t know he was Sherlock’s brother for ages. Gregson just called him the Umbrella Man. She had a theory that Sherlock had been genetically engineered in a government lab and escaped and that’s why Mycroft kept checking up on him. She actually once told Mycroft he should be looking after him better.” Lestrade shook his head. “He was a right mess: never cut his hair, half starved. Yeah, even worse than now,” he added, intercepting John’s look. “He’s a different person than he was back then. Getting off the drugs was most of it, but you get a lot of credit too. And Mrs. Hudson, of course.”
yet. He was close now, slick wet everywhere and every nerve ending in his pelvis tingling; usually by this point he was desperate to knot but now he was nearly out of his mind with sheer bliss. He could feel his knees touch the mattress as his body opened, the stretch alone making him shudder and spurt. He was almost there, the edge of orgasm rising in his toes and fingertips and moving inexorably inwards. John was everywhere, his scent, the weight of his body, his roar in Sherlock’s ears, the animal thrust of his hips. He could feel himself expanding, the inner ring aching to be filled, John’s huge cock somehow no longer enough, and at the same time the pleasure rushing inward mounting and mounting and…John’s bulging knot slid home and Sherlock cried out as he contracted around him and his arms and legs flew up as the
“Actually, yes,” Sherlock said quietly. “I was at school with Jim. He was known to be viciously cruel even then.”
“I am delighted and grateful to have you at all,” Lord Mycroft said. “Our family owes you an enormous debt.”
“Of course,” John said gently. As they closed the door, he saw her sit down and bury her face in her hands.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “There aren’t any monks. The abbey hasn’t been an active monastery for four hundred years. It’s a ‘retreat centre’.” His tone implied this was not much of a step up.
Matthew Lewis’ flat was in a dark, narrow building of tiny bedsits. John wondered if he would be home at this time of day during term, but Sherlock swept up the steps with complete assurance. He knocked on the door of Matthew’s flat, and the young man from the hospital opened it. He seemed wan and tired. The flat, in contrast, was covered with wildly colorful prints on every wall.
“But then I would have to remember to get it trimmed.” She took a drink of her coffee and said, “Done for the night?”
use cocaine, and a few weeks ago he was complaining about his stash running low—something happened to his dealer, apparently.”
John had filled the bucket and he led the way down the steep zigzag path down the promontory toward the dock, branching off at a fork Sherlock had not noticed in the dark and rain. They came out on a little rocky cove, the tide pools glinting in the sun.
The memories were not all bad. Sherlock liked remembering Victor: their elaborate games, Victor’s easy affection and cheerful enthusiasm. He remembered Uncle Rudi and his kind, sad eyes, the sweets he kept in his pocket. He remembered the swing in the garden. He had almost entirely discarded the false past by now: the life in which he had always lived in an ordinary house, always been alone. Only Redbeard the dog proved surprisingly resistant.
Samirelliev nodded. “Get him upstairs. As soon as we’ve done we’ll get him back to the compound. I’ll ring for the doctor.” He stepped away and Arslan came in, holding a bottle of water.
Sherlock sat processing this information. Prince William, though an alpha himself and bonded to a proper omega wife, had refused to take the Oath of Supremacy, both as a matter of principle and out of loyalty to his beta son. Prince Harry, married to another alpha, had left the country far earlier. The official story was that William had gone to France, where he was allegedly living a life of decadent exile after the manner of the Duke of Windsor. King Charles’ alpha niece Beatrice was now Princess of Wales. “The propaganda minister did an admirable job covering that up,” Sherlock said finally. “Too bad he’s not on our side.”
“I’ll probably have the materials from Australia tomorrow. I need you back here to help me track her down.”
Sherlock had the distant feeling this would have been a lot more humiliating if he’d been sober, but he felt his face burn all the same. He made his voice dismissive. “I can assure you, George…”
The shoes. Sherlock felt the knowledge like an electric jolt up his spine. James had the shoes at his house. He was going to show him. He was going to tell.
“I did two tours in Iraq. I got out before I couldn’t adjust back, although not early enough to save my marriage…this seems pretty tame after that.”
“Alberts, good night. See to the files before you leave. You’re out of excuses, Sherlock, up you get.”
Back in his room Sherlock went straight to the loose panel in the wainscoting, knowing a maid would be up any minute with his lunch tray but desperate to get his precious package hidden. The secret compartment was a good bit more crowded now; his contraband books and tablecloth road map, almost halfway finished, took up most of the space. Pushed to one side were the two remaining sovereigns, and a small bag holding twenty-eight and a half sedative tablets.
John made quick work of the rest of his clothes and then started on Sherlock’s, slowing his pace as he worked buttons through holes and gently slid the clothing off. He ran his fingers over Sherlock’s chest for the first time, marvelling at the softness of his skin, the hard muscle underneath, the way his nipples hardened and peaked under John’s fingertips. Sherlock closed his eyes and shivered, reaching up to steady himself against John.
“Oh, she doesn’t fancy him. But given the choice? She’s already low status, she’ll go to some garrison commander in Ireland and be sport for all his alphas every heat. Or she can be bonded, have her freedom—well, more or less—“
Finally there came the sound of voices and footsteps along the corridor, growing louder, and then the door opened and a small knot of people came in led by the Mother Superior.
“You were always the troublemaker,” John said. “It was your idea for me to dance through that cards party in the first place, and then you took half my tips!”
John imagined Sherlock as an adolescent, bony and awkward and cutting, and thought that was probably as close as Sherlock would come to admitting what John was sure was the truth: that he had been scared to death. Still...
John reached up with his other hand and touched Sherlock’s cheek with his fingertips. The Commander’s ring had caught Sherlock under the eye and the place stung; he could feel it beginning to swell. “Thank God. I almost tore out his throat when I saw you there on the floor.”
“Not as such,” Sherlock said in a tentative way that told John it certainly wasn’t off the table. John paused to think about that one a while. He turned it over and over in his head until he thought he had it clear: Sherlock liked a dominant partner. Sherlock almost certainly hadn’t the least idea of how to negotiate for his own needs and limits, if he even understood them himself, which was questionable. Sebastian Moran had seen this, and had abused Sherlock’s submission and his trust.
“Mmm.” Sherlock did not look up from the newspaper he was perusing. “You’ll have to take my card, I gave the last of my cash to Hobbes…where is Hobbes?”
Boffin Bill was committed to a long term psychiatric facility where his medications have finally been adjusted effectively. His letters to Sherlock have become much more sensible, and Sherlock is saving some of them to trade to Mycroft next time he needs a favor.
Sherlock bounded into his room from the shower. He was in an excellent mood. Phillipe had got two bicycles from someplace, and they were going to take a picnic and ride up into the hills today. Of course the actual reason for this was to find someplace deserted enough that they could get each other’s clothes off and have as many orgasms as possible, but they’d told their parents they were sightseeing.
John’s stomach dropped then went cold. His fingers clenched involuntarily and he felt Sherlock twitch and start to turn his head, quizzically looking up at John, who squeezed his shoulder numbly, said, “Good on you, pulling a colonel,” and quickly escaped to his chair where he huddled, feeling sick. Thank God Sherlock’s back was turned.
“You,” Gregson said to Sherlock, “are a fucking marvel. I’m glad I didn’t leave you in that holding cell, even if you were a pain in the arse most of the time.”
Sherlock piled the vases in the back of his car, put the address into his phone, and considered. It was getting late; most of the shops were beginning to close up for the night, and it would probably seem suspicious if he turned up right at tea time burbling about a commission for his dear mum. Better to go back to his inn and wait for John to call—no, he was not waiting for John to call, he was pursuing his own interests. Maybe he would have dinner at the inn. Oh, who was he kidding? He would be listening for his phone the whole time. Sherlock was so wrapped up in his own thoughts that he never noticed the small woman driving slowly down the street behind him in her little blue car, wipers going against a slight misty rain.
“Because I’ll have to make my confession and I’ll have to tell him that I want to die. And then he won’t let me go to heaven.”
Mycroft regarded John with narrowed eyes, but John had had plenty of practice at dealing with Mycroft’s stare-off technique over the years. He stared back, utterly implacable. Mycroft finally broke, twisting his mouth again, and took another sip of his drink.
Sherlock pulled the door clear and stepped through. He was on a tiny, unlit landing, with a blank wall in front of him and a door on either side. The ceiling overhead slanted steeply; evidently they were under another staircase, probably one leading to the upper storeys, between the shops.
him, every inch he could reach. Sherlock suddenly lifted his arms and shrugged off his coat and John heard it hit the floor behind him as Sherlock wrapped himself into John again.
“Whatever you like. I’m paying, I did win 86 quid at poker, even if it wasn’t enough to get me jam.”
“No idea. But it’s bad for the Colonies, what’s left of them, anyway—or bad for the Empire holding the Colonies—because they’re totally isolated now. We’ve lost sea access with the Southeast. The Northeast is theoretically still passable, but that’s effectively been under Canadian control for years. So Central region is cut off and they’re hemorrhaging people to Canada, civilians and soldiers both. It was a trickle over the winter but it’s a flood now. We can’t keep spies in the Colonies because whole units are deserting and defecting.”
“Okay, black out whatever you think might be a state secret, I don’t care about the details. I just want to know what’s going on.”
“I have been informed that a delegation from the Cabinet will be coming today to inspect our proceedings here and to meet those omegas fortunate enough to be chosen for the first covenanting. If I call your name, you will go with Abbess Hester. The rest of you will proceed to instruction as usual. Sister Mary the Virgin.”
It would be an exaggeration to say that Sherlock never forgave Mycroft for ruining his life…but not by much.
“I’m sorry! I wanted to tell you right away, but Sherlock wanted to wait. It’s early days yet—just happened whilst we were in Italy.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and it made John glad to see his usual acerbity reasserting itself. Sherlock’s mouth twitched. “Certain you don’t want to go back to the orgy?”
“The thing is, he’ll be off to boarding school in a year. We’ve simply got to get this nipped in the bud before then.”
There was at least one silver lining to Mr. Brocklehurst’s reign of terror. A few days after the gin incident, the headmaster finally began surprise inspections after lights out. The very first night he discovered Mr. Gamfield
In October Mr. Gregson came into the kitchen just before tea and said, “Post--here, John, one for you.”
Why did that question feel like a trap? “Because—I care about you, Sherlock. I don’t just want to just get off like you’re some stranger I picked up in a bar—“
Sherlock pulled off his cloak, folded it neatly, and set it in front of him on the ground. He heard the others following suit and knew they all shared the same thought: at least the pile of clothes might keep the alphas from coming too close.
“If you give the cellos a bit more voice there, it will heighten the effect of the violin,” Emily explained. “You can make it sound even more alone, or the music more sad. Cellos are great for sad. That’s the beauty of an orchestra—you have more than one voice. The violin still has the solo, but it doesn’t have to say everything by itself.”
Sherlock turned and looked directly at Mrs. Reilly for the first time, pinning her with unexpectedness of his gaze. “You fool,” he said softly, “You stupid, stupid, fool. Did you really think you could get him this way? He’s set you up and left you to take the fall, because no one will believe a beta woman’s word over his.”
John stared at his phone, mind racing but hands rock steady as he went through possible options. If this had been one of his friends from the Army he would have tried reassurance, empathy; but these were useless with Sherlock. Straight-up truth then.
“How do you know so much about baby furniture?” Sally said, raising her eyebrows. “Something you haven’t told us?’
Mrs. Hudson nodded. “We could easily persuade the commander you needed to be out of the city. It isn’t as though he enjoys your company, is it?”
“Do you have a cloth, or anything?” John asked the finely-dressed man sitting opposite. He was warming quickly in the enclosed space, so at least his teeth were no longer chattering. “He’s bleeding pretty badly.”
Tank shrugged morosely. “Stay here, I suppose. Not much else I can do. Don’t much fancy my chances of scarpering with that bastard running the place.”
“Don’t be stupid, if it weren’t for you lot I’d have never got out at all.” John said. “Are you home now then?”
Sherlock’s eyes were blazing with fury. “Marriage, wife, suburbs. And that what you’ll choose again as soon as you get the chance.”
. When Sherlock was sure John understood, he took the slate, cleaned it, and wrote a new sentence. John got this one quickly: “John likes horses,” he read triumphantly. “Now me.” He took the slate and changed only the last word so that it read, “John likes Sherlock”.
“I’ll give you a hand,” John said to Roz. He was a seasoned professional at cleaning out refrigerators, and knew it went more quickly with a second person to hold the bin liner. Roz swept out all the perishables with quick efficiency and John tied off the top of the bag and carried it out to the garage. When he came back, Sherlock had already gone through the master bedroom and was looking under the sink in the en suite; Rodriguez was watching him with open curiosity, Ryan as though reserving judgment.
“John,” Mycroft said patiently, “I know when Sherlock fills a medication, borrows a library book, or is mentioned anywhere in the press. If he had been selected for something like a memorial dedication, I would know it.”
“We were told her health was rather more precarious than had been previously known. She will not be able to resume her duties.”
“Spontaneous eye opening,” Mycroft remarked. “Very good. You’ve advanced a whole point on the Glasgow Coma Scale since I saw you last.”
“I don’t think…” Harry paused, rubbing the back of her hand against her mouth. Wanted a drink badly, Sherlock thought. “I don’t think he wants to see you just now. I’m sorry. It’s been a rough time for him…”
“According to his statement,” McGinty said, “Mr. Rhodes had been at a meeting of his local union, which was corroborated by multiple witnesses. Instead of going to a bar with his buddies afterwards he drove to Price Hill and parked around the corner from the street in question in the parking lot of a convenience store. A security camera verified that he parked there at approximately the time given. Mr. Rhodes stated that he was getting ready to leave Miss Clark’s home when they heard the gunshots, though he was unsure if he heard anyone running up the stairs. He was worried that the police would take his name and his wife would find out where he had been, so he decided to go out the back.”
He was dreaming, his favorite dream, the one where he was at the pond teaching Sherlock to swim. He felt the old joy at being back here, but something had gone wrong. The sun had dimmed and when he looked up he saw only storm clouds crowding the sky, and the water had grown cold around him. When he looked down he saw Sherlock’s eyes on him but all the color was washed out of them, leaving them the same gray as the sky.
“You know I don’t pay attention to the details of your transitory interests,” Sherlock snapped. “John, this is important, we need to—“
Sherlock’s eyes flicked to him, wide and startled, and then quickly away. Was he bashful? Nervous? Second thoughts? John was too tired to wonder. “I will,” Sherlock said. “You go on. I’ll be there in a bit.”
“Blackbeard’s got fat! How am I supposed to escape from rampaging aristocrat-hating mobs on Blackbeard?”
“You’re in love, and you had a bonding heat. You’d have kindled for sure if you didn’t use contraception.”
Jesus. John turned his face far enough to rub his cheek against Sherlock’s hair--he only just stopped himself from kissing his head--but he wasn’t even sure it registered. “Do you want another?” he whispered.
“Maybe for you. it was a little unnerving for me when the panda car pulled up and the coppers went in!”
“Well, if that’s on the table,” John said, but Sherlock flipped him on his back as neatly as John had done earlier and sat on him, pinning his thighs.
Owen interrupted him, voice dropping low and urgent. “I have to go. Somebody’s coming.” He clicked off.
His phone rang. Sherlock, who had never been so happy to see his brother’s number, snatched up the phone and said quickly, “Yes?”
“Thank you,” John said gratefully and followed his directions. John’s heart was in his throat all the way back to the meadow, a slower journey than he would have liked since he kept off the road the whole way. Sherlock was sitting in the shade of a large tree where John had left him, looking pinched and worried.
“Adverse effects in the animal subjects. It may or may not be due to the entropy, we don’t know. But I’ve had an offer from a private facility, so I might be able to carry on if Baskerville doesn’t explicitly forbid it.”
Irene rested her chin on her hand, considering. “Well, that is a hitch in the plans. Hmmm. I think I’ll set up shop in Edinburgh for a bit, then. From what I hear it’s frightfully dull, so I should be quite a sensation. And it’s also apparently the headquarters for the silent opposition--you can understand why it’s silent, opposition to Moriarty tends to be a bit unhealthy--and here I am with an introduction ready-made. I’ll leave you the address of the hotel where I’m staying and when darling Seven is recovered, write and I’ll come help you break out.”
“Look.” Tiernan flipped pages and then tapped the poem he wanted with a finger. Sherlock recognized it at once: it was one of the six that made up
“Must be. Hold the torch again.” Sherlock tried the left hand door first and the lock opened easily, but the door would not budge. Perhaps something heavy was in front of it on the other side, or a wall had been built…that was an unsettling thought. He took a deep breath and tried the other door.
Good thing he had such a limited selection of shirts, Sherlock thought, staring at himself in the mirror; as it was he’d tried them all on anyway, spending an inordinate amount of time waffling between white and black. (White.) He had arranged and rearranged what felt like every individual hair. Should he have had another drink? Should he have eaten something? What if he got light headed? Sherlock never got light headed. Wouldn’t do to start now though. Sherlock dug in the minibar, gulped down a bag of trail mix and a chocolate bar, and then his text alert chimed with a room number.
They stumbled into the last stall and Sherlock sank down fully clothed on the toilet as the man latched the door. He was certainly not going to his knees on the floor in here. He yanked at the marathoner’s flies as the man ripped a condom packet open and jerkily pulled it on. Then Sherlock leaned forward and sucked him down.
“Perhaps. But I told him I’d see you there safe, so that settled him, and he took his pills and went right off for a rest. Mind if we get a quick bit of lunch at that café? He’ll be sleeping another hour at least.”
“He never met him, as far as we knew. James Moriarty didn’t get out of prison until 1992. He didn’t exactly cut ties with the IRA, but he got into more of the organizational side of things, and after that business over there settled down he was really just a straightforward crime boss. I suppose he was pretty good at it because he was never arrested again, although from what I heard Belfast knew he was into all kinds of stuff; they just couldn’t pin it on him. Here’s where it gets interesting. Jim senior died in 2005—pancreatic cancer, sounds like it was pretty fast—but
Sherlock found a reasonably smooth rock in a pool and perched on it, splashing water over himself and hissing as the salt water first stung and then soothed his broken skin and sore arse. The thick dried alpha spunk clung like glue to his legs and abdomen. Sherlock had a brief flash of memory, of waking in his room to find his body had been washed clean by the servants as he lay unconscious, and felt a surge of fierce joy.
“The Bible says a great many things, many of them contradictory and a great deal more patently ridiculous.”
He had reached their lodging house. John was tired now, and as he turned onto the landing for the final flight of stairs leading up to his room he thought longingly of the comfort of his bed. He paused. Was that music?
“Well.” Mycroft switched to inspecting his teacup, an expression of faint disdain on his features. “Charming as it always it to visit you, Sherlock, I’m actually here for a reason. The investigation precipitated by the discovery of stolen artworks at Peter Ricoletti’s former house in Florence has proven most fruitful. Several members of the Malavita are under arrest and Interpol believes there is potential to widen the investigation even further.”
“Oh goodness, isn’t that so sweet!” She considered, biting her lip. “He usually brings the pieces round himself, so I’m not sure I have the—wait, yes I do, we had to send round something for him to sign a month or so back.”
“So I’m thinking,” Liam went on, “seeing as how Gerard says you’re to go last, I’ll go first, and then you and me can have a bit of fun whilst Miles and Gerard have a go at him. They’ll soften him up nicely for you; Gerard’s got a dick like a fucking Clydesdale—“
John grinned, his whole face crinkling into such beautiful lines. Sherlock wanted to kiss every one of them. “Will you think it’s creepy if I say that I might have fantasized about that too?”
“How do you know this one?” he finally wheezed, once it became apparent that no one was going to catch up to them.
“—and more importantly had no motive,” Sherlock said. “Even if Cooper was lying and planned to throw her over, she’d have been wiser to bide her time and sue for paternity testing after the baby was born. Now she’ll have to go after the estate and establishing paternity will be a nightmare; the baby won’t be born for months and presumably the wife will obstruct her at every step.”
“Need a hand?” Abbott asked Sherlock, who tried and failed to look haughty while flat on his back out of breath. “Up we go then.” He put his hands under Sherlock’s armpits and hauled him up. Sherlock wobbled but John got under his arm, and between the two of them they got Sherlock down the stairs and walked back to his ward whilst maintaining the illusion that he was really doing it on his own.
Sherlock nodded for the sheer pleasure of having John bring the tablets and fold them into his hand. He swallowed obediently and closed his eyes as John stroked his hair. Bliss.
“You are unbelievable.” John gulped coffee, reading the email over again wide-eyed. “Paolo Fieri is a superstar, he’s the best midfielder the game’s ever seen. He’s a
Gregson leaned back and touched his fingertips together. He was a slender man, elegant, with a thick head of silver hair and an air of vaguely professorial abstraction that masked an eye almost as sharp as Sherlock’s. “And here’s what I’ve learnt, old boy, reading history. When they want to put your name on a list, it’s time to get out.”
Magnussen, with his dead-fish eyes and his cold damp hands and the sadism creeping under the surface like larval migrans. Sherlock just managed to keep his face impassive as he lifted one eyebrow and drawled, “What an attractive prospect.”
Molly had come to visit them in Sussex to bring Sherlock a grisly set of autopsy photos. “Is that some sort of revenge for John’s mustache?”
one is all about the exhibitionism, about your teammates seeing a pretty girl spread her legs for you, watching you take her so hard she forgets her own name.”
Beside him, in contrast, Sherlock was quivering like a pointer who senses a game bird just out of sight. “She should have been here by now,” he muttered. His eyes flicked over the dance floor even faster than the strobe light, which definitely did not help John’s impending headache. “Who in their right mind would choose this music? This is intolerable.”
“Brother Peets, darling! It has been so long. You are well?” Fitzwilliams fluttered his lashes, clearly proud of his own tact in not glancing at the flat front of Sherlock’s robes. He fancied himself a sort of role model to the ancilli, and had hosted Sherlock at an interminable tea the previous autumn.
The painkillers in the loo; "These aren't dangerous, you can have custody of them," John said dryly; would they be enough if he took them all? Sherlock jerked himself upright, moved on autopilot into the kitchen, and put the kettle on. Keep moving. He checked his phone and saw that he had one voicemail and one text, both from Sally Donovan: the text said simply
”The thing is…” John had dropped his voice again, so that Sherlock had to strain to hear him. “We can’t keep doing this. Meeting in secret like this. It’s too dangerous.”
John and Sherlock had not yet advanced much past kissing, although Sherlock had made it clear he was more than amenable anytime John wished to take things further. John had been happy to move slowly--aside from anything else, he enjoyed teasing Sherlock’s impatience--but tonight the feel of that soft yielding skin of Sherlock’s throat had him feeling hot and itchy with want. He hurried through his teeth and slid gratefully into the warm bed. “Come here,” he growled.
Mrs. Hudson must have seen the sweat break out on his face, for she said, “I’m sure you’ll want to rest a bit now, so I’ll just leave you to it. I’m making your favorite dinner tonight, Sherlock, so we’ll have a little celebration, won’t we!” She fluttered off down the stairs and Sherlock closed his eyes in relief.
help him sleep. The minutes dragged, and he had absolutely no way of judging how much time had passed; he couldn’t so much as hear a clock tick. The nurse came by and took his tray and escorted him to the loo and to clean his teeth, and then he was back in bed again. There was no sound from the curtained bed farther along the ward.
“I’m going to be away at the PM’s place then. Don’t know as I hold with my handmaiden gallivanting about London whilst I’m not in town.”
“So this is how you were going to get out that first day!” John said. “I wondered how you were planning to get past the gatehouse.”
Sherlock blinked heavy eyelids, trying to focus. John looked terrible. He was haggard and unshaven, and had clearly been wearing his clothes for days. He’d been like that the last time Sherlock saw him but that had been because of the baby, and now he looked even worse, and—wait. Why was John here? Hadn’t he gone away?
Sherlock was so deep into his research that he didn’t register anyone trying to get his attention until his earbud was tugged out, leaving him with one ear full of Vivaldi and the other full of Roz.
“Not yet, we need you for something else.” John switched the phone to speaker and set it on the table. “Sherlock and I have an agreement that he’s not to bugger off and do anything that endangers his life without consulting me. If we can’t agree on how fucking stupid it is, we ask you to decide.”
Sherlock waved this off as irrelevant. “When you have the children, their clothing will pick up the cat hair. She’ll have to launder everything or suffer horribly. It’s an excellent means of revenge.”
“Oh well, if that’s how it is, I’ve changed my mind. Go sleep in your own room,” John said and, when Sherlock looked stricken, “I’m not serious! Goodness, Sherlock, I think you tired your brain out, to believe such a thing. Come on, let’s get in bed.”
OCD turned out to be an asset in physiotherapy. There were many, many times that Sherlock’s strength gave out before a set was finished, but he could no more think of stopping than he could of dancing the cha-cha. He panted a moment, gritted his teeth, and kept going.
John thought, but he couldn’t say that. Before he quite realized he was going to do it he heard himself say, “You’re beautiful.”
Sherlock made a noise a little like a sob and John said, “Shhh, shh, you’re supposed to be resting. It’s all right now. We’re safe. You’re safe. We’re safe together. But no more rivers, please? One more might be the death of me.”
“Of course I won’t,” Sherlock said, not caring if Tiernan saw him roll his eyes this time. “I’m never going to write an opera. I don’t even know if I’m going to be a composer. I don’t even know if I’m going to be a
John’s peacefully slumbering cock zinged to full alertness as though shouted awake by Minchin. “Oh God yes,” he said. He leaned up, lifted the hatch, and shouted, “Make speed, my good man, and don’t spare the horses--half a guinea if you make it in twenty minutes.”
The Commander sat back, narrowing his already narrow eyes. The Commander was a round man with thinning hair and unflattering glasses; a little like Mike Stamford, but the Commander’s face was hard and suspicious where Mike’s was friendly and open.
“Brilliant work,” Jon said, because it was, even if the whole thing had more holes than a tea strainer.
“I’m a lot tougher to take than on Ian Braithewaite,” John said. “And anyway, you can’t think I’d leave Sherlock now.”
Sherlock coughed, holding the end of the nasogastric tube at arm’s length so it wouldn’t drip on the bedclothes. “Two thousand calories a day,” he said, dropping the tube to the floor and punching at the pump to turn it off. “Pass it over.”
Sherlock turned away, the narrator once more. “They send a player. He brings back a girl.” He toed off one shoe and then the other, pushing them out of the way under the bench with his foot. “She’s excited. John Watson is her hero, he’s everyone’s hero, the star of the team, the
“There’s a Chick-Fil-A up ahead, I just saw a sign,” Roz said, perking up. “I could use a sweet tea too.”
“I do, but first we have to settle this. Sherlock, you can’t just do things that put yourself at risk without talking to me first. We work together or not at all.”
“Be still, you’re making it smaller yet,” John said. “You just only slept in mine that once since you got tall.”
The music trailed off and Sherlock abruptly went to the desk and scribbled something on a sheet of paper. “That’s
“John’s not here,” Sherlock said reflexively and then, annoyed at himself: “Of course you knew that already. Shall I take that for you?”
The abbess stared down her nose at him, looking him over for signs of sexual readiness, presumably. Sherlock sat up on his knees, grinding his arse down into his heels and arching his back involuntarily. “
The light came on—just a single overhead bulb but it hurt after hours in the dark—and he screwed his eyes up, squinting. The room was smaller than it had seemed in the dark. Besides the mattress, there was a bucket, a narrow table, and two chairs, so close he could have reached out and touched them.
“She’s young and strong, so...I hope so. Oh, Mike, wait.” As Mike turned to leave John had had a sudden flash of Sherlock sitting in the courtyard waiting, growing anxious when John did not appear. “Will you take Stephen a note?”
Sherlock only half-listened as Rhodes went through the course of events; he’d clearly retold it so many times that the story was worn smooth, no new edges to catch hold of. When he’d finished McGinty asked a few follow up questions, absolutely nothing imaginative, just as Sherlock had suspected.
“I don’t either,” Moran said. He stepped forward to open the door for Sherlock—they’d never made it farther than a few feet into the flat—and reached a possessive hand, but Sherlock was quicker and slipped past into the hall.
“That’s fantastic,” Sally said and Sherlock looked up. He’d gotten caught up in it for a bit, interested in the case, but now he was forcibly reminded that this—puzzles, admiration--was no longer his life.  “No, really, I mean it!” she said defensively, misinterpreting his expression.
“No, I don’t have anything incriminating to report on Anthea,” Mycroft said wearily when he’d picked up. “I don’t have anything new at all to report on Anthea since the last time I talked to you mere hours ago.”
“I brought a cake,” Mycroft said as calmly as though discussing the weather. “One month clean, I rather thought a bit of celebration was in order?”
John bolted the door. His mind felt like a lorry spinning its wheels uselessly in mud, unable to get traction. Green Jacket, his affable morning companion of the past several months—what was he doing here? Why? Had he been after Sherlock all along? But how—
Mary hadn’t stayed alive as long as she had by losing her head. She aimed almost without conscious thought, knowing exactly where she was going to place the bullet: right lateral thorax, no vital organs but the lung that would collapse when her bullet tore through. Sherlock would barely be able to breathe, let alone talk, but he would be in no danger. She would have time to tell him to say nothing to John until she could tell explain the whole story and he would do it, motivated as much by curiosity as anything else.  But it turned out that looking into the rain-clear eyes of someone she knew and loved and pulling the trigger was a lot harder than she would have thought. Her hand shook at the last minute, and for the first time in all of her lives, Agra missed her shot.
invested in being the only one special enough to be Sherlock’s friend? It made him consider for the first time how he would feel if A Study in Shagging Sherlock resulted in Sherlock getting…a boyfriend? Just because he couldn’t picture it didn’t mean it couldn’t happen. “She came to see you this morning,” he pointed out.
“What do you mean?” John said, surprised. He hadn’t thought Sherlock’s recent odd behavior had been noticeable to anyone but him.
The kitchen was at the back of the house, with a sliding glass patio door giving onto a back patio with an empty bird feeder. Sherlock peered intently at the table whilst they all watched. John noted the long-cold coffee cup, the open box of Christmas cards, and felt a pang of sadness, but Sherlock was frowning at something  on the table that seemed to have caught his eye. He checked the bin, sniffed over the cabinets, opened the refrigerator—which made them all back away quickly—and then gave Roz a nod and swept out.
And John wanted him. Wanted him with a hunger he wasn’t sure he had ever felt for anyone. He could still feel the softness of Sherlock’s lips, the heat of his skin. He could still see Sherlock’s pale yearning face in the instant John had broken the kiss; he thought the image might be permanently seared on his retinas. If he went to dinner with Sherlock now, he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from taking him. And he couldn’t. He was married, to a wife he loved deeply, with a baby on the way, and there was absolutely no way he was throwing all that away. Not for anything. Not even—especially not even—for Sherlock, who had already ruined John’s life once and could have made things a hell of a lot simpler if he’d twigged that he wanted this three fucking years ago.
“I’ll look the article up when I get home and put it with the photographs. Shall I message them over or do you want to just get them next week?”
“Who cares about the view, the view is boring,” Sherlock gasped.  John chuckled, hitched his long leg up a little higher, used his other hand to line them up, and pushed in. Sherlock moaned, throwing his head back, and John tugged on his thigh to bring them flush against each other as he slid all the way in.
“Camera.” John shrugged. “We’ve done it before. You don’t have to go to every crime scene. You don’t even
Sherlock frowned, not as though he were displeased but as though he were trying to remember something. “I don’t know,” he said slowly. “Show me the equations.”
“Oh that. Her mother had been a servant in a great house. Seduced by the son, discovered by the mother, cast out without a reference, found herself with child, came to the attention of my mother, established in the village as a seamstress with the polite fiction of being widowed. I assume she worried that her daughter would have difficulty making a good marriage, and so obliged her to accept the first offer that came her way.”
Sherlock was supposed to be washing lettuce for salad, but halfway through he got a familiar glaze to his eyes and wandered off to his desk with a towel draped over one arm. Just like old times, John thought fondly, as he finished the salad himself and served it onto plates with spaghetti and bread. He set Sherlock’s onto the desk next to him and carried his to the table, where he opened his own book.  He was finishing the washing-up in the kitchen when Sherlock came limping back, looking slightly disconcerted. “I was meant to be doing something…”
“Dull. Boffin Bill is an idiot. His lab notebooks are going to be incoherent ramblings and delusions of alchemy.”
“Haven’t you ever--” but of course he hadn’t. It was the pond all over again, John realized: Sherlock had probably never even shared a bedroom before, let alone a narrow bed. “Sorry. You take the bed, I’ll bunk out in the loft.”
; the same things John had been saying to him for months. “It will,” he said firmly. “Remember, Sherlock, I’ve been th—“
“We’ll talk about that later,” Patrick said. “Right now we need to be going; it’s getting close to curfew.”
John choked on a bit of potato. “It’s not like that,” he said when he’d had a drink of his beer. “We’re not together, just flatmates.”
“I’m going around to the back,” he said softly. No one was in the corridor to see him apparently talking to himself. “I never told you, Lestrade, because I thought I would get in trouble, but we used to go back there and smoke cigarettes.” The sign on the door said FIRE EXIT ONLY, ALARM WILL SOUND, but twenty years ago it had been an empty warning and apparently that, too, remained unchanged. The door stayed silent when he pushed it open.
Effie gave a quick, startled laugh, looking back up again. “Yeah. Then they started talking about the cricket, and I had to leave. I’d done about all I could with the grate.”
“Professional…” Sherlock heard the penny drop in John’s sharply indrawn breath. “You think it was him. Moriarty. You think he’s back.”
“Well,” Mr. Gregson began, and then paused, and Mrs. Gregson buried her face in her apron and sniffed.
Mr. Brocklehurst regarded him another long minute, then glanced around the table--everyone frozen like rabbits who have spotted a hawk--and then swept back up to his seat.
John also had letters to send to Mr. Brooke and to Pip, with whom—to his own surprise—he had become quite good friends; Pip was one of the few people in the world to whom John could write openly of his relationship with Sherlock, albeit circumspectly. Pip had recently graduated from Bart’s to become bookkeeper for the potato merchant, a position of which he was clearly enormously proud. Mr. Brooke was making quite a success of Bart’s now that it was actually being run as a school, and many of the boys were leaving well prepared for careers as bookkeepers or clerks. John was deeply grateful he was not one of them. Apparently Mr. Brocklehurst had gone utterly mad after John and Sherlock’s escape, egged on by the boys who continued to “haunt” him, and had thrown himself from the same window as Sherlock a few weeks before Mr. Brooke’s arrival. He was now safely locked away in an asylum someplace. Forever, John hoped.
“He means,” Ned said, barely able to speak for laughing, “now that you’ve had the real thing, Lord Sherlock’s bony little arse probably doesn’t look so good any more.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Then you hurt me. I won’t break. Maybe I’ll kick back. Maybe I’ll yell at you and wake you up and you’ll yell at me and call me a rude git for waking you up.” John still looked worried so Sherlock said, “I tried everything I could to keep you safe, and look what happened—I broke your heart, twice.”
“It’s things gone off in the fridge,” Roz said. “Sherlock, would you mind starting in the kitchen? Once you give the okay I’ll clear it out.”
“I am,” Sherlock agreed without a hint of modesty. “But you still--wait!” He pushed himself upright on the sofa, suddenly animated. “You said you didn’t spend a lot of time on the details or think about men when you were young. That implies you’ve had adult fantasies, doesn’t it?” Sherlock leaned forward, pinning John with his sharp eyes as though he were about to whirl round in another pirouette. “Tell me, John,” he said, dropping his voice to that low purring register again. “What did you think about when you were twenty-one?”
There was a long silence, during which John imagined Owen was cursing the impulse that had led him to follow John out of the bar. “I need to call my boss.”
“The Agra treasure had been hidden during the colonial period to keep it out of the hands of the British. Legend had it that a faithful servant had been trusted to take it up into the mountains and hide it, and he was never seen again. People had searched for it over the centuries of course, but it was assumed to be lost. As it turned out it had been passed down, father to son, through the generations, and now the current caretaker had had some sort of message from God that he was meant to send the treasure to aid the jihad. Of course the treasure was still in its original form, gold and jewels—“
“Oh shit,” John said and he was up and running, not a second’s hesitation. Sherlock scrambled up after him and hissed at Felix, “Close the door!” before he bolted through the outer room, eliciting a startled yelp from the sofa. The night outside was dark and moonless and he was momentarily disoriented, unable to see the direction John had taken, but he blindly followed the cacophony of screams and barking, stumbling and cursing as he went. “John!”
Sherlock felt his eyebrows go up, as much as at her tentative tone as at the words themselves. Oh God, what had he gotten himself into? “Yes,” he said in as discouraging a tone as he could muster.
John snorted and Mycroft handed him the folder. “The rest of the details. I must be going; I’ve quite a lot on my plate today and must make time for a cigarette before I go.”
Sherlock waited, patiently, as Miles looked off, turning his drink in his hands. Finally he looked back and said, “Boffin Bill.”
Collins was still smiling an hour later, dusky twilight settling over them as they bumped along the uneven road back to the prison camp. John sensed him glancing over and sighed inwardly, knowing the kid was wondering what John, an alpha and former officer, had done to land himself in the Army’s prison camp. For his part, he wondered what had possessed the kid to join the Army at all. Perhaps he was so young he didn’t remember a time when being born beta didn’t automatically consign him to a life in a permanent underclass. Or possibly, going by his accent, he would never have aspired to anything else anyway.
John managed to get the box and the package open using his right hand and his teeth, which seemed quite an accomplishment considering how much wine he’d drunk,  and rolled the condom over his throbbing cock. He pulled out his fingers and generously slicked both himself and Sherlock and then wiped his hand on the towel. Sherlock was writhing around, eyes still closed, apparently desperate for some kind of contact with John but uncertain how to get it.
In the middle of the night, John woke abruptly to the sensation that something was wrong. He knew where he was—the sofa bed in Sherlock’s rooms—and nothing
“If there are a large sum of money and a corpse,” Sherlock said, “Then there are two possibilities. Either Shah had the money and someone killed him to get it, or someone else had the money and Shah attempted to get it—“
Sherlock smiled with his eyes still closed, and John reached to smooth his tangled hair back. “You know,” he said after a minute, “I understand why you like that side of the bed, facing the stairs and all, but it seems a bit unfair. Here I’ve got this fantastic view
. He didn’t really wake up until the next day, and he revived to a pain so intense that he couldn’t understand why he’d ever been given morphine before. Why hadn’t they saved it for this?
The lieutenant was looking out at the field through binoculars. “Two more coming now…and here comes Talbert, sir.”
At the catwalk John went outside, leaving the door open, and Sherlock hoisted himself up into the light room. He heard John shout, “This view is amazing! We have to come back in the daylight!”
Sherlock was quiet a long moment. Finally he sighed and turned his head, nestling it into the hollow of John’s shoulder and shifting most of his weight off, though they were still wrapped together. “I know.”
“—or a chemist. But if you ever decide you’d like to turn to the crime thing instead, look me up. We could use your brains on the force.”
Sherlock pushed his hair up under the cap and pulled it down as far as he could to shadow his face. Barret gave him a thumbs up and they both straightened, looked at each other once, and then stepped around the side of the cottage.
“Oh Christ,” John said, “Alive, he’s alive—“ and suddenly he found himself laughing, helplessly and a little hysterically, and without thinking he reached out and hugged Mycroft hard around the neck.
“Let me then.” She looped her arms around his neck and brushed her lips softly against his, then again, then again with a little pressure, now moving a little closer so she was pressed against him, her mouth opening under his.
“Could have passed for younger,” Tank said musingly. He looked fondly at where Sherlock had scaled the brick wall and was hanging nearly upside down to look at the river. “Bless him.”
I think you know I took pictures of you. I hadn’t planned to, of you, but Moriarty wanted them. He wanted to see you like that, used and damaged. I told him he would have the pictures when he got me out. I lied. I deleted them so he would never have them. There are no copies.
“Not tonight, please,” the man posing as Paul Dockery said quickly. “Before seven. I can’t risk my wife overhearing.”
“I know. I know,” John soothed. “But you’ll be in society, go to university, be where you belong, and maybe you’ll realize I’m not what you want anymore, not in that life. You can only give this away once, Sherlock, and I don’t want you to regret--”
The robe Phillips brought him was of the thinnest possible linen, but it was still too hot. Sherlock couldn’t stand it. The fine fabric brushed over his rigid cock and he knew he was only seconds away from tearing the robe off and spreading himself over the nearest horizontal surface to get whatever relief he could from grinding into it. There were other people there now, betas, useless, and he snarled at them helplessly.
anything about the e-mails. John had flagged a few he must have considered promising and Sherlock flicked through them out of habit: No, obvious, dull, hmmm. Perhaps. Sherlock checked his voice mail. Molly:
“Oh, no need to bother the Tadpole,” Gruner began, but Sherlock was already flinging the door open and announcing, “Sir, the ship reports.”
“We should have gone to the beach. But that would have tipped him off, and I hate the beach, there would be sand in my shoes, and I’m not kissing in the rain, we’ve done that already, it was too wet, why do people like that, and besides it isn’t raining—“
. Hit me like a bloody train. Now I’m so jealous I can’t think straight. He could be getting off with, I don’t know, the Dalai Lama, and I’d want to kill him.”
“Better,” Sherlock said, relaxing again as John reached to stroke his hair. He stretched experimentally. “Good. Better than good, I think. Why, did you have something in mind?” His hand slid along John’s side.
“John’s coming first,” Sherlock called, pushing a crate over to the hatch for John to use as a step. John climbed up and stepped out. The air was cold on the river, and a few snowflakes had begun to fall; the boards under his feet rocked dangerously as he crossed over to where Irene waited to hand him down. He jumped to the deck and kissed her cheek swiftly, then turned around to help Sherlock. He was not there.
“Thanks,” John said, unsure whether to be flattered or insulted. Another thought had occurred to him. “Does that mean you don’t know about any of his other compositions?”
Sherlock blinked rapidly and for a second looked mutinous, but then he obediently unfolded himself and turned around. ”Hands behind your back,” John ordered.  He pulled the bag out from under the bed and unfolded one of the scarves, which he then looped around Sherlock’s wrists. At the brush of silk on his skin Sherlock shivered, and his soft penis gave an interested twitch. “Is this okay?”
“No, that’s—have you eaten at all today? Hang on.” John fetched some biscuits and said, “Lestrade called. He’s got a dead uni student, supposedly quite popular, but apparently nobody noticed him missing until the other kids on the floor complained about the smell.”
I know you know how to flirt, I’ve seen you do it for cases a hundred times.” He lifted his head, struck by a sudden inspiration. “Just pretend it’s a case. Only instead of trying to get information you want to…see how long it takes him to get off, or something. Maybe for an alibi.”
“Jim is dead,” Sherlock said. “There’s no doubt whatsoever about that. But Moriarty was never his real name, we knew that all along. I realized…I’ve done a great deal of research into the history of crime in London, and I was looking into a, er, a similar crime and I realized there was a pattern; there’s always been a Moriarty here, a spider at the center of the web. I believe someone’s stepped into his shoes, if you will.”
Sure enough, as they approached the gate Sherlock rummaged around in his workbag as though hunting for a pass and the guards, recognizing them, simply waved them through.
“Oh no you don’t,” Sherlock said brightly. “You promised John, remember? Not even for the Queen herself.”
Getting Sherlock out the door for a run was something like taking the cat to the vet, but then for Christmas John gave him a fancy GPS watch that automatically uploaded his mileage and speed to a ridiculously complex spreadsheet, and he was hooked. He lost another five pounds. Fortunately by this time John had lost some weight of his own, and had gotten his cholesterol levels down to the high-normal range, so he was able to persuade Sherlock to allow chicken twice a week.  The steel-cut oatmeal had turned out to be not half bad and Sherlock had gotten very good at cooking fish, but the tofu was just too much.
Sherlock had had enough. “I’m going to bed,” he said abruptly, pushing back from the table and leaving his uneaten plate of Christmas cake for someone else to clear away. Nobody took any notice of him. He filched Mycroft’s glass of whisky and slunk moodily upstairs to his room.
Sherlock worked his hands up and clutched at John’s hair as John sucked gently at his throat. “Oh,” he gasped. “Oh--John, I love you, I love you, Oh God I love you.”
“True. Last summer the Italian police started cracking down on the Malavita. I guess they got lucky and found a lot of good information in a raid on one of Ricoletti’s former houses, some stolen artwork thing…”
“Yep,” John said. “Oh, Lestrade texted me earlier. He’s going to bring dinner round for us in about an hour. He seems to think we can’t fend for ourselves.”
. “We’re going to need tea,” he told Charles. “And I’ll take a cup as soon as it’s ready, thank you.”
“Oh, don’t worry about that.” Sherlock settled himself on the footstool and wrapped one arm around John’s legs. “I’m sorry about your mother.”
“Jesus,” John said, staring. “The chief superintendent is on Moriarty’s payroll? I just thought he was an idiot!”
Sherlock was right. The banns had already been posted, amid several notices of upcoming christenings. The social hour after noonday prayer was humming with gossip and chatter but for once Sherlock could barely bring himself to care; he kept thinking of John, wondering if he’d come to the door again that night, like a tiny secret coal of warmth beneath his habit.
The nurse brought his tea. She wore white, like the novices, but with a large red cross on the front, and a stiff white headdress like the professed sisters: an ancillary like the guards and abbesses, a beta, obviously. She was much older than Sherlock, with fair hair and kind but faded blue eyes. A middle class beta family, good loyal citizens, husband and son—no, sons—lost in the wars. The world had burnt though not embittered her, but she had been happy enough to shut herself away from it. She did not carry a cattle prod.
Dr. Woodcourt shook his head. “He may have done, but no fall can account for the severity of his injuries. I operated immediately but I am afraid there is a perforation of the bowel and, as you know, there is little that can be done in such cases. I wish you to keep him comfortable, and bear him company, but if he should wake and speak…”
Everyone looked at him and Watson flushed slightly before continuing, “They should have a protocol for such things. We do here, don’t we, Mrs. Hudson?’
That got a real smile out of Mycroft, shy and almost surprised, and then Fair-Hair came up and said, “Sir.”
“Oh, I’ll be somebody’s natural son. Preferably somebody recently dead, so they can’t disown me. Educated abroad, provisions made by the father I never knew and therefore can’t answer any questions about--I’ll pretend to be older of course--it will be perfect. Whose reputation needs a little tarnishing?”
