“No, no, don’t worry. It’s just an itch, it’ll pass.”
Everything is calculated with Tony’s pleasure in mind. There’s not going to be much more of this he can take.
It’s then Steve notices the large anatomic heart hand-stitched in black thread at the bottom of the tie. Against the blood-red silk, it looks viscerally
Clearing his throat, Steve continues: “What I mean is, do you feel like yourself in that suit, or do you feel like the Tony Stark everyone else expects and wants you to be?”
That’s the plan, anyways, until Steve’s hand appears out of nowhere and shoots out to stop the elevator doors from closing.
At her little smile, Steve groans, dropping his head like a free weight. “Fine. If you have an

because it was so easy to go from best friends to romantic partners, and you had years of friendship between you to hearken back to. Plenty of moments when you thought you'd made it clear to Tony that you loved him, that you cared about him, that you admired and respected and yes, deep down (not that deep, really) were very much attracted to him.
He does care, though. That will have to be enough.
The entertainment “news” “reporter” says this footage was taken minutes ago on a bystander’s cellphone. Tony sinks into a chair in front of the widescreen TV, helpless to stare as he watches the 15 second clip repeat itself over and over as the airbrushed talking heads gush and gossip about Sam and Steve, two all-American good guys making up the hottest couple since sliced bread.

Tony is up and calling the suit before the thought can finish itself. It’s waiting for him in the lobby by the time he steps off the elevator, rushing to fill the vacancy as panic claws at his throat. “J, cross-streets.”
He doesn’t let himself linger on the feelings that elicits, even if they are bubbling right under the surface and dangerously close to what one might call
“Are—
The last test is the hardest. Steve goes down to the lobby via the elevator, carrying the scepter in one hand and the suitcase containing the space stone in the other. He’s dressed in his 2012 uniform again, and he didn’t miss the way it rides up his ass, but he’s got more important things to think about.
“Why?”
“Uh. What?”
Tony feels lightheaded; his thoughts are sluggish, and he probably looks like he just went ten rounds with an angry leaf blower, but he can’t bring himself to care. He can’t do much of anything except blink dumbly at Steve and stroke the broad planes of his back through his T-shirt, but Steve seems okay with that. He seems

, and then plunges back into Tony’s waiting body with a groan that shakes Tony to the core—and again. Tony squeezes his eyes shut to hold back tears but he can’t stop the way his body thrashes under Steve’s, the way his moans pour out of him like he’s drowning in pleasure, because that’s what he is. Drowning. Falling. Hard.
, like his pupils have just about been burned out of his skull with want, so blown out and dark Tony can see his reflection in them.
horny. “Did Jessica hit you with pheromones or something? Do I need to get Strange down here to run a blood panel on you?”
The Ancient One steps forward. “I’m sure you are,” they say. It feels dangerous, standing out here on the front steps like this, but if the Ancient One doesn’t flinch at being exposed, then neither will Steve. They hold out their hand with a beatific smile.
“Where did you go?”
that sells it. His face is why The Picture™ has been the #1 trending thing on Twitter for going on twelve hours, and why Clint whistled Wagner’s bridal chorus at him when they walked back into the tower last night.

“That’s because it did,” Steve tells him.
“What?”

He shudders to imagine what Nat would have to text the person she’s trying to set him up with if he did:
don’t look at each other like they want to throw each other down on the nearest flat surface and fuck the other person stupid.”
Obviously that’s only half of the story, but no one needs to know about how Tony spent most of those six weeks moping around in that big empty house wearing grubby shirts and eating pints of half-melted Half Baked ice cream out of the container (and then exercising himself sick to make up for it).
, but that sounds too cruel. Steve is caught somewhere between floating and crashing when Tony returns, slipping his hands under the hinges of Steve’s jaw. He must be able to feel as much as see and hear Steve’s gusting sigh of relief, because the next thing Steve knows, Tony is pressing another kiss to the knitted space between his eyebrows.
his lizard brain supplies, unhelpfully.
Tony collapses a second later, clutching his elbows in lieu of the sheets, shuddering as the last of his orgasm, the best and biggest of his life, rolls through him, making a high, broken sound as Steve follows him off that terrifying precipice with a low, soft sound, pressing inside deep, so deep Tony will never forget the feeling, and
He doesn’t hear Tony’s answer to any other questions after that, but he is acutely aware of Tony’s warm and steady [left] hand on the small of his back guiding him into the tower to safety.
Looking at his younger self is dizzying, like vertigo. Tony once mentioned having a huge crush on Jimmy Stewart when they watched that movie as a team, which is how Steve learned Tony Stark liked men, too. That was the night his world really turned upside-down.
“Tony.”
fall any more in love with him? Granted, that ship sailed eons ago, but Tony likes to think he still has some degree of restraint left in him. Maybe. After this, though, probably not. But that’s a problem for Future Tony to deal with, after Steve
He’ll deal with stocks and the PR fallout (and Pepper’s wrath) tomorrow. Right now all that matters is the way Steve whimpers when Tony nibbles and tugs at his bottom lip and keens every so quietly when he swipes the tip of his tongue suggestively against that warm pink flesh, leaving it shiny and kiss-swollen for the world to see. When Tony gently pulls away, he can’t help but chuckle: Steve’s expression, dazed and slack and flushed past the collar of his shirt, is practically a neon sign that says
“Now do you believe me?” Steve asks in a husky rumble once he’s caught his breath. Tony only has a moment to appreciate the fact that he managed to knock the wind out of Steve Rogers before he whips his head back to glare at the man’s smug face.
“What if I did?” he counters.
“What are you talking about,” Tony smirks, “I kiss everybody. If anything I thought you’d be the one to tell me I should kiss people less.” He comes to a stop between Steve and a nearby armchair, which he leans against as he drinks, all lazy legs and elbows and what Steve has come to (obsessively) suspect is a deceptively strong body.
“I didn’t,” he says, watching Tony’s face intently. He knows it so well at this point, he can tell when Tony’s smile is fake or real, when he’s wounded and won’t admit it, when he’s tired but can’t sleep. So Steve notices all too easily when the corner of Tony’s mouth dips down, a fraction of an inch of a frown, before he recovers with a laugh and claps his hands.
He expects Tony’s mouth in response, given that perfect opening, but instead Steve feels his hand come up and hold him by the shoulder. Not to push him away, but to pause. “Tony?”
but something isn't right, because even as weeks, months go by, and you move into Tony's suite and fall asleep wrapped around him almost every night (except those when he's in another country, and the bed is almost as cold as the ice, or when he's consumed by some project in the workshop and loses track of time), and you tell each other "I love you" out loud multiple times, and say it without words in a million other ways, you get the feeling that Tony. doesn't. believe you?
Tony was quick to strike a conversation with the switch, pleased to find the switch matching him topic for topic.
“It’s alright, I understand.”
“Fri, what’s Fri?”
“I’m sorry, Cap,” the robot said, voice sounding weary and sad, “We lost the war.”
“Steve,” Tony said.
“Nothing happened,” Tony said softly.
“We’ll get through this,
There was one another option. If he was truly desperate. Death was always an option.
Steve laughed, “I’m not that kind of guy, Tony.”
Tony felt all the fight slip out of him as he slumped onto the floor. He didn’t feel the nervousness, he didn’t feel pain or misery, just a numbness. He stood up, eyes dull and left the room.
“That’s not true and you know it,” Steve frowned, “if that were true, he wouldn’t be leaving for afghanistan for three months and leaving you alone here.”
, Steve begs with grasping hands on Tony’s waist, the backs of his thighs. Steve is the one with super-strength but Tony holds him in place with nothing but his hands and his mouth, as if Steve were light as a feather and twice as delicate. Which is funny, because Steve has never been harder in his life, straining and leaking against the seam of his gym shorts as Tony licks into his mouth with a hoarse moan that makes Steve’s blood sing.
“FRIDAY, where’s Tony?”
it, and he loves it even more for the fact that Steve put it on him earlier tonight, looping the ends over each other and tightening the knot just so while kissing Tony stupid between giddy smiles.
Tony waggles his eyebrows at him and says, “Promise, Cap?” with a gleam in his eye that Steve resolutely does not read into.

him, pressing him into the duvet with the full length and breadth of his body and sealing his lips over that same spot on Tony’s neck as before, purpling the bruise even deeper and darker with his hot, humid mouth while Tony gasps and moans against the bed.
Steve grumbles something that sounds vaguely like
“It’s not a win for
Bill is still talking a mile a minute behind him; Freddy sits back down on the couch and lets Steve continue his “Captain America Meet-and-Greet” but makes him promise to come back and swap stories, which Steve does, happily, even as his mind whirls. How does Tony know these people? Why are they
Instead of a kiss, Steve wraps an arm around Tony’s back and pulls him in close, mirroring the hug he’d given him before…all of that happened.
, and fuck if it’s not the hottest thing that’s happened to Tony in his entire life. Between the emotional outpouring and the manhandling and the feel of Steve’s massive length through those goddamn chinos, Tony’s about fifteen, maybe twenty seconds away from coming in his jeans like a teenager, and not a single part of him gives a shit.
. The things Tony would do for Steve Rogers if he’d let him.
“Not far,” Tony replies. Steve grunts, pulling back. “Too far—” Steve kisses the words out of his mouth as Tony says them, one hand splayed across Tony’s cheek to hold him there. It’s like burning, this—wild and instantaneous, a hot glow flaring in the fraction of an inch of space between their bodies. He wants to tear off their clothes and live skin-to-skin with this man, fuck him and taste him and know him and—
Only later will Tony be able to recall how the next few seconds unfolded: how Steve moved a hand from the deep curve of Tony’s lower back and used it to cradle his jaw; how he notched the thumb of that hand under Tony’s chin to tilt his face up mere centimeters to meet his; how Steve’s long, long lashes flashed gold in the low light as his eyes fluttered shut. Tony might even watch the Tower’s security footage to confirm that’s how it went.
It’s not the same as getting blackout drunk when the shit hits the fan, but a good 72-hour uninterrupted workshop binge should just about do the trick.

He shrugs. Smiles, easy, the way he couldn’t when he was Rogers’ age, fresh out of the ice and soul-broken, hopeless.

open, until Tony is gasping from it, the thickness, the burning heat, the wet, slick sound of Steve’s cock shifting in his ass. In the quiet room it’s the only thing Tony can hear besides their breathing. At this point he can’t even tell if it’s dark outside, what time it is, what he’s supposed to do next: all Tony can do is lie there and let Steve press inside, deep, deeper, massive, burning.

“S’long as you want,” Tony replies, warm all over, boneless and happy in Steve’s arms.
“Glad to hear it!” Tony almost shouts as he pivots back to his coffee, pressing down on the plunger too soon, but he’s so harried by being there in the kitchen with Steve on his first day back to worry about a weak brew.
“Uh-huh.” Steve sits on the arm of the sofa, legs stretched out in front of him. “And who are they really?”
,” he says in a rough, low voice, growling out the last word like a swear. Tony arches against him to hear it, feeling the way it rolls out of Steve’s chest and into Tony’s. The iron grip on the back of his neck forces him to keep still, eyes straight ahead while Steve does something with his opposite hand—the one, Tony realizes, that has been on his cock this whole time.
, Steve.” These words have been building up and building up for a week, and they’re so easy to say now—Tony can’t stop them from spilling out. He holds onto Steve for dear life, hoping for a net. “I’m reckless with myself, my things, my words, but,
“Hi.”
Tony waves the question away. “No, no. I called LifeAlert and Happy came and took care of him. All fine.” Tony can’t muster a full press smile right now, but he manages enough of one to convince himself, at least. Steve, not so much. His concerned frown deepens, eyes focused and bright with so much goddamn
The thing about being in Tony Stark’s presence is, it’s
“Why do you say that?”
Clint is already deep in conversation with the redheaded beanpole, who talks so fast it’s dizzying; Natasha is standing next to the third man, keeping her eyes forward, and together they watch Tony disappear back into his work, muttering things back and forth to each other, so quiet even Steve can’t hear.
Maybe it’s for the best Tony never kissed him like he did the others before now, Steve thinks, and that’s the last coherent thought he has before Tony steps in impossibly closer, enough that Steve can feel his belt buckle against his sternum, and runs all ten fingers through the hair on either side of Steve’s head.

“Not to you, it isn’t,” Steve counters, and there’s not much Tony can say to that. “I’ll talk to the team. They might have questions, and you shouldn’t have to answer them. Not tonight, anyways.”

Funny—ten minutes ago he was coming back from a team exercise, prepared to give Tony a friendly but firm talking-to about missing it, and instead here he is, breathless, heart racing, sitting and listening to Tony talk humbly about fixing people because he knows it’s the right thing to do. Because it’s the

“More than anything.”
“I mean it,” he says. He’s never looked so certain.

“Steve—” Tony breathes, reaching down, readying the words on his tongue:
Tony gives him a look. “I’m heavy,” he says.
Steve knows it’s going to be a long night the moment he receives a text from Natasha that simply reads:
“It’s alright, big guy. Party’s over,” Tony chuckles into his ear, nervous, patting Steve on the shoulder from under his arm in an awkward bend. “I’m fine, I promise." He does the unthinkable, then, Tony: he steps back and takes Steve’s hand and lays it flat against his chest so Steve can feel the strong thud of his heartbeat and the low, steady hum of the arc reactor at the same time. “See?” Tony says with a quicksilver smile, “alive and well.”
and we’ll see,” Tony says, smiling down at Steve’s hand wrapped up in the tie still hanging from his neck.
“Takes a lot more than that to knock the wind out of me, Cap.”

Autopilot is as useful a function in the Iron Man suit as it is in the rest of his life, especially these past six weeks—buttoning his shirt, Tony notices but doesn’t worry about how he can’t feel the fabric under his fingers, or the pinch of his dress shoes as he pulls those on; the world has been slightly out of focus ever since he and Steve broke up, and the feeling of walking through life with only half the lights on upstairs and a black hole where his viscera used to be is all too familiar.

“I heard that!” Steve calls out, emerging a moment later from the bathroom with one of Tony’s fluffy white hand towels against his face. He drops it and smiles, which would normally be enough to make Tony’s heart skip a beat—Steve really does have the most gorgeous smile, big and a little goofy, nothing at all like Tony’s plasticine fakes, thank goodness—but then it hits Tony with the force of a chest blow from the Hulk that Steve, Steve
He’s so caught up in thinking about all the ways this could backfire he doesn’t realize JARVIS has let Steve into the workshop, regardless of Tony’s feelings on the matter. The realization sets in when Steve’s voice appears close to his ear, soft and low with a frisson of urgency, like he too is slightly out of breath.

. Maybe Steve’s not as vanilla as Tony made him out to be.
“Next week, you can pick the movie,” Steve whispers conspiratorially, bumping Tony with a friendly elbow. Tony has to hold himself back from leaning into Steve in response, the way his body feels primed to do and has done for literal years, ever since—god, since
“Ah, there’s your knight in shining armor!” Piledriver cackles, squeezing his arm harder around Steve’s neck. Steve is turning purple, scratching and kicking at the body behind him to no avail. It’s hard to get a good shot in a dark, contained space like this—a bullet might ricochet and hit Steve, or Sam, and absolutely no way in hell is he firing off a bomb down here. Tony doesn’t linger on the
How he’s expected to function now that Steve is supposedly his, Tony has no idea; every desire he’s ever had has suddenly burst forth at once. Some of them are so goddamn domestic, too. But that’s the thing with Steve—what they’ve built over the years, what they’ve been to each other and what they’ve become, it’s all so fucking
He’ll deal with it later. With extreme prejudice.
“You’re so noisy in bed,” Steve says, but because Tony can’t see his face, he doesn’t see the way Steve smiles when he says it. Something small and hurt curls up in Tony’s chest; he buries his face in the sheets and mutters an apology. Steve’s answer comes in the form of a hand to Tony’s untouched cock, warm and firm, barely moving once it wraps around him. Tony shudders and whimpers, trying desperately to smother his noises so he doesn’t annoy Steve with them, but Steve once again is in his ear, rumbling deeply, “Don’t hide from me, Tony. Never from me. I earned those noises—I want to hear them.”
“Love you, Tony. I

Honestly, the intrusive thoughts he could deal with, but the fact that Tony looks this good after hours of hard labor really isn’t fair.

Steve’s blood has pretty much pooled completely south at this point, but his heart still gives a valiant pulse at Tony’s words, his expectant, eager smile.
He’ll worry about the scuff marks on his dress shoes tomorrow.
But then he’d put Tony to bed and left. So maybe Tony isn’t the only one to blame for his current inability to step foot in the living room. Maybe, if Steve had stayed that night, and if they’d talked the morning after, Tony would know where they stood now. Which would be great, because not only does Tony miss his best friend-turned-maybe-lover worse than anything, he really needs to ask Steve a favor.
That look, Tony thinks, is dangerously close to

Shifting in place, Tony notes that the pressure of Steve’s hug is forcing the outer ring of the arc reactor casing into Steve’s sternum. Just like the edge of the marble countertop, Steve probably doesn’t even register that it’s there, leaving a deep imprint in his skin that would bruise if it weren’t for his healing factor; whereas Tony is used to the constant, digging pain, the ache of it holding his chest apart. His heart is constantly exposed, yes, but that’s no reason to hurt Steve with it, even in theory. And that, he knows, is exactly what will happen if he lets this continue.

at what must be an absolutely mesmerizing sight, based on the devastated noises spilling out of Steve’s mouth with every short thrust into Tony’s loose, wet heat.
Tony seems to notice their position at that exact moment. Steve feels him blaze with heat where his hands are touching Tony’s bare skin.
Tony waves a hand at him, smiling beatifically like the words don’t make him want to drop to his knees and beg Steve’s forgiveness.
Tony has never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth. When Steve tips his head to the right and kisses Tony like one of them is dying, hot and hard and openmouthed, Tony follows suit, throwing his arms around Steve’s thick neck and his legs around Steve’s hips, surging forward to kiss back and finally,
“Uh,” Tony murmurs, breathless again already. Steve is so fucking
, Tony chides himself as Steve guides him through the doorway with a hand on the small of his back—nothing about them is normal.
Because as it turns out, Tony Stark is a coward.
“I thought you’d never ask.”
Sleep is the furthest thing from Tony’s mind now, his Hammer-induced mini panic attack from earlier so far in his memory’s rearview, it’s not even a dot on the glass. This—Steve holding him, Steve looking at him, Steve wanting him,
Tony’s mouth falls open on a trembling gasp when Steve jerks him, an opportunity Steve seizes with relish in the form of a deep, deep, shuddering kiss, because Steve is tall enough and seems to like kissing as a general rule. Tony kisses back, not frantic but not restrained, either, grabbing the back of Steve’s head and moaning as he uses this new leverage to work himself down onto Steve’s cock, slow and steady.
“Please…” he gasps, groaning at the amount of lube Steve pours out onto his hand and smooths up and down the length of his cock, smears messily against Tony’s asshole and presses inside for good measure. Even the cool touch of the gel isn’t enough to chase away how burning hot Steve is between his legs, against his cock and his empty, needy hole; Tony jerks himself absently, mostly to keep himself loose and relaxed while Steve presses against him, nudges the thick hot head of his cock against his rim with a cool wet kiss before easing it in.
“Steve...”
“You fall, I’ll catch you,” he whispers before dipping in for a proper kiss that floods Tony’s head with incandescent light. It’s chaste and measured and
“Yes, you do.”
Tony’s eyes fly open but are heavily guarded when he looks back at Steve from across the table. No take-backs, Steve tells himself.
A sound like a hammer on an anvil echoes through the basement, followed shortly by another cry. Angry, this time, not at all like Steve’s. Tony floods the place with light from the armor, both arms up and ready for action, drawing the attention of the four behemoths fighting blind all the way in the back.
Now, Steve pushes the orb back through the energy barrier, mouth pressed in a firm line. The burns will heal, in time. He has plenty of it, after all, and the pain is a cheap price compared to what he felt watching Tony die, and it’s a price he’s more than willing to pay if this works.
His woozy-weary
That post-battle adrenaline must really be doing a number on him.
But first.
Tony groans. “You don’t remember?”

It’s a choice, an easy one, that Steve’s already made.
Steve walks right over and sits down without waiting for a word from Tony. A light breeze whips at them, mussing Tony’s hair into a delightful state of chaos, so messy and lovely Steve yearns to run his fingers through it.

Tony fingers the end of it absentmindedly as he scouts the room for the man in question.

Tony huffs as he leans back against the bar. Here he was, hoping to whisk his new—

,” Steve gasps, kissing Tony’s mouth tender and open and wet, fucking it with his clever tongue like he’s fucking Tony’s ass, punishingly gentle, inescapably deep, scraping Tony’s moans off his loose tongue with his teeth and then biting his lip before kissing him again, kissing him breathless and insensate before he starts hitting that spot inside Tony again, over and over, pummeling his prostate even though he knows, they

Tony’s stomach and heart rate and knees
The words echo across the years like the worst kind of phantom pain as Steve looks and looks and
“Mornin’, Cap.” Tony sounds perky, but not in a well-rested, coffee-and-a-shower kind of way. He sounds breathless, almost manic, like Steve’s the first person to bring him up for air in hours.
“It was easier than going through with it,” he says, fingers fidgeting in his lap. It always strikes Steve as incredible, the fact that so few people know this side of Tony Stark, or know that it even exists: this is the same man who fended off an entire phalanx of reporters for Steve, a man who can charm his way through an entire room like it was a dance, a man who gives away billions faster than he can make them. And here he is now, hunched in on himself, fidgeting and quiet, breathless after just a few words. He sounds like he’s dreading whatever’s about to happen to him—to
“Nice try,” Steve says. His dark, promising smile is the last thing Tony sees before he’s being lifted and dropped down belly-first across his own California King, face landing in pure white 1,000 thread count sheets that haven’t been slept in once.
Mostly.
“They’re from the same company as the guys in the convoy I was with when I—when they—” his voice sputters out before he can say the words. Steve doesn’t push. He doesn’t say anything. He just waits for Tony to gather himself. It’s one of the hardest lessons he’s had to learn about Tony Stark—sometimes it’s better to let him get a handle on himself, rather than jump in and try to handle Tony
Right into Steve, who takes Tony’s weight like it’s nothing, but not like
The HUD is a brightly colored mess of information: live police reports from the ground, vital signs of wounded civilians, schematics of every building between 28th and the Flatiron, but all Tony needs to know is where Steve is, and if he’s okay.
He flies faster than he’s technically allowed within city limits, but the law can wait. Steve’s life can’t. Unlike the armor, Steve can’t call his uniform to himself, nor can Sam sprout wings and fly them out of there at the drop of a hat; they’re two against four heavy hitters, and as much faith as Tony has in Steve and Sam’s abilities, those are odds he’s not willing to gamble on.
on what planet, in what universe, in what timeline—alternate, parallel, or otherwise—is Tony Stark lovable? in general, and specifically in the eyes of Steve Rogers, who is dorky and sweet and earnest and honest (most of the time) and strong (except when he's not) and a bastion of moral goodness and rightness and everything Tony wishes he could be but never can because his past weighs too heavily on everything he does, always, forever.
“Ugh, fuck—” Tony hurriedly wipes his drooling mouth with the back of his hand because holy shit, when and
“O-oh, Tony,
Tony falls into it, Steve’s kiss, the hard, kneading hand on his ass; his own erection catching against the duvet is practically an afterthought. He just wants
with mutual restraint, tastes faintly of the buttered popcorn Steve ate earlier, and the only way it could be better is if it never ended.
Steve laughs softly. “Not better—and I definitely don’t look as good in stilettos.” Steve files away Tony’s visible gulp for later. “But do I think I might be better
they shouldn't even work together, as a couple, and yet, here's Tony waking up next to Steve on some random sunday morning, bed-headed and groggy because he went to sleep late, after Steve was already conked out, and it works, because really all they did was add physical and emotional intimacy and a lot—
“Breathe,” Tony smiles, reaching up and holding the back of Steve’s head like it’s something precious he wants to protect. Steve gasps, too wrapped up in what’s happening to be embarrassed; god, he’s panting like he ran a mile and Tony’s barely touched him.
,” he croaks, turning his face so he’s not being muffled, and tries to catch a glimpse of the man who just ate him out like a starving man at a buffet. He catches a hint of shine on the corner of Steve’s mouth before he’s got both of Steve’s hands grabbing and manhandling him onto his back like Tony is a featherweight. Which is impressive, because he’s not. He and Steve are pretty evenly matched when it comes to height, and while Steve’s definitely got more mass on Tony, Tony isn’t
Reducing Tony to an object just so happens to be one of those sore spots. Steve knows he’s hit a nerve when Tony’s eye twitches, his mouth thinning ever so slightly. Any moment now he’s going to turn on Steve, hit back with some smart-ass remark about
much.
, and he’s still bright red and tongue-tied when the chef personally brings out a heart-shaped chocolate soufflé drizzled with seedless raspberry sauce and dotted with gold leaf to congratulate them on their engagement. They eat it, of course, and Steve may enjoy listening to Tony’s delighted moans and gasps more than is appropriate. He certainly can’t help but reach out and wipe away a bead of raspberry sauce from the corner of Tony’s mouth when he sees it.
Steve makes that little huff-laugh sound again, softer this time. “Tony,” he says warmly, and so close: “I couldn’t ignore you if I tried. Hugging you now.”
indeed—the lady’s probably Tony’s age and here’s Steve,
Thor is running interference on the suits, pushing and holding them back, Mjolnir in hand. He clears a space for Steve to walk through with a nod. Steve nods back, but his eyes are elsewhere.
In the moment, the only thing Tony knows is Steve, and Steve’s kiss. It’s soft at first, warm and dry and chaste, their lips only slightly parted, but the hand on Tony’s jaw is firm, molding around its shape and holding him in place while Steve works.
, is completely fucking naked in front of him.
The man is too busy looking for something in Tony’s eyes to respond. Whatever it is, when Steve finds it, he smiles bright as the sun, grinning like Tony has given him something infinitely precious.
it, being challenged the way Tony challenges him, delighting in the push-pull of their banter and debates, the way Tony teaches him about science and tech and the 21st century without being condescending. Steve gets to a point where he thinks he knows Tony, how he operates, how his brain works—then moments like this happen, and it’s like he’s sprinted smack into a brick wall.
it's only when you
“Oh god,” Tony groans, “please, do
The elevator dings, announcing their arrival, at the same time Tony drops his hand and Steve surges forward, taking up the dedicated space between them that’s been there for years and that Tony has never called into question until this exact moment, because one minute he’s ranting about how he’s trying not to let his need for a drink get the better of him, and the next he’s got a mouthful of Steve Rogers, whose arms come around him and
“After you,
Just the thought lodges a cluster of something uncomfortably prickly in his chest. Steve puts his coffee down and massages the heel of his palm against his sternum to try to ease the anxiety blooming there.
Steve keeps walking, offering Vision a quick, distracted wave in lieu of a response before disappearing down the main hallway leading to their staggered suites. He walks past Bruce’s door, past Natasha’s and then Clint’s, wondering all the while what he’s supposed to say to Tony versus what he
Tony is smiling up at him from his place in Steve’s arms, relaxed now, almost leaning into him, and all Steve can think is,
“Gonna fill you up again,” Steve groans, coming down to lie on top of Tony, who moans at the weight, feels safe and protected and held there under Steve, hot all the way through, inside and out. “God, Tony, you’re so
, humming as he licks and sucks Tony’s rim, opening him up with infinite patience and that insistent, wet tongue until he goes from prodding little licks to a deep, languorous tonguing that leaves Tony drooling even as he babbles himself breathless, “Fuck, Steve,
like it’s just another day that ends in a Y.
It’s just Tony’s luck that the first person he runs into is Steve, glowing from a workout (it’s Thursday, Tony remembers, which mea ns cardio and time on the heavy bag) and just as beautiful as the last time Tony saw him.
“I’d ask how it went,” Steve says softly from the doorway, resting his shoulder against the jamb, “but I know that groan.”
“At least ten, no more than thirty. If he passes thirty he has to come and talk to me.” Steve pushes himself up onto an elbow and shakes his head. God, he needs to change out of this shirt, it’s so saturated with sweat it’s gone from blue to black. “Anyways, what’s your point?”
Tony remembers seeing Steve’s watch there when he’d poured his coffee. Had Steve—?
It’s positively indecent, which is a good look on him.
Your presence is requested downstairs.” JARVIS, however, sounds downright peeved. “Opening remarks are scheduled to begin momentarily.”
He has to go back there, one day.

wanted but didn’t have the courage to articulate—it’s as heady an experience now as it was then, being on the receiving end of that look from Steve Rogers.
him, the goofy bastard, and he tries to say it with a smile, with his eyes, beaming up at Steve from the pillow of his arm. To Steve’s endless credit, he seems to understand, enough, anyways, to smile back, big and toothy and
“Are you doing okay? I know we—things kind of...ended, abruptly.” Steve says the word ‘ended’ like it tastes bad. His face screws up like he’s sucked a rancid lemon. It’d be endearing if it wasn’t directed at Tony for Tony’s sake. “I’ve been worried about you.”
, of course he does, but Tony was always especially weak for slightly disheveled and endearingly domestic Steve Rogers wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants. It doesn’t help that Steve looks
Plus, his life is complicated enough as it is. Adding an unsuspecting stranger to the mix would only complicate more. And how would he explain it to them, his life? How could he ask for understanding when what he does is so outside the scope of the average person’s day-to-day reality? How could he ask anyone to wait up for him, not knowing if he’d make it back to them alive? In what universe would that be fair to a partner?
to see Steve there among the suits.
The person who opens the door is far from expected, but like Nat told Scott that fateful day back at the compound,
Should he tell them the truth? Or does he reinforce the fantasy he’s been happily living in for the past few days? Natasha will see right through him, either way. By the look on her face, she already does.
Tony reaches out for the keypad, fully intending on hitting the button for the workshop floor, way down in the belly of the tower where he won’t disturb anyone. Where no one will disturb him.
“What did?”
He can feel every inch of him, thick and hot and so fucking long it has to be illegal in a few states. Tony must say something to that effect because Steve is humming again, not quite a moan, not quite a laugh, as he firms up his grip on Tony’s jaw and grinds against his ass like a sealed promise Tony has to sign for.
Tony wouldn’t be standing in the kitchen with him at three o’ clock in the morning if he didn’t—but Steve’s care is universal when it comes to the Avengers. He’s vigilant in his need to know his people are safe. He’s the man who checks in over comms moments after the bad guy goes down to make sure they’re whole (Natasha), who texts the hardest hit two days after the battle to ask if they need more ibuprofen (Clint), who boils enough water for two pots of tea without having to be asked (Bruce), who volunteers himself to spar when the clear blue sky outside the tower suddenly goes dark (Thor).
It happens often enough that the fact itself isn’t jarring, but something about being alone with disheveled-frazzled-happy-sweaty Tony sets Steve’s nerves on high alert. Tony is loose-limbed and relaxed, moving in and out of Steve’s space as he picks his way around the living room barefoot, looking for discarded tools.
“Yeah, well,” Tony mutters, “it’s good practice, anyways.”
Iron Man. Shield, suit, or otherwise, I am Captain America. I know that. But we’re also
you love him. he loves you. it works. better than that, it's
And oh, does Steve ever
Steve sips his coffee, staring at the picture splashed luridly across the front page. Anyone would have rushed to him to make sure he was okay. It’s what teammates do—they watch each other’s backs, pick each other up when they fall. It’s normal. Totally normal. Any teammate would have collapsed on their knees at Tony’s side and pried the faceplate off while crying his name like a prayer, the way Steve did yesterday.
“It always is,” Tony murmurs, dropping a kiss to Steve’s lips to chase away the sour taste speaking that particular truth always leaves in his mouth. Steve breathes in deep and pushes up, grazing his chest against Tony’s, not even flinching at the arc reactor as it grazes his sternum, pulling Tony in closer for another deep, hard kiss that makes Tony’s head spin. Steve presses down with the hand on Tony’s back and Tony gasps, forced forward until there isn’t a speck of space between their bodies, not an inch of skin Tony can’t feel acutely. Every nerve ending is precisely attuned to Steve, the soft wet heat of his tongue—which he’d had up Tony’s ass not five minutes ago—fucking his slack mouth, the hand on his jaw moving him this way and that at Steve’s whim, the burning brand of his massive, hot swollen cock grinding ever so slightly against his own.
“Only a few seconds. Natasha did the lion’s share of the work picking the shirt out for me,” Steve replies, blowing gently on his forkful of pasta, saliva pooling in the back of his mouth as he watches the steam trail off it before taking a bite. “Why, do you think I should have kept th—
life depends on it.
“And you think it’s because he’s trying to let you down easy?”
,” he keens, grabbing and tugging at the man’s jacket with fumbling hands until it finally comes off enough to hang from Steve’s wrist. He knows they need to talk more, like adults, but the lid has come off the pot and they’re both boiling over. Tony can’t remember the last time he felt this goddamn
Looking up into the Ancient One’s eyes feels like falling headfirst into time, itself.
“Steve, please,” Tony insists, reluctantly prying his fingers away from Steve’s neck and holding them against his shoulders. Only when Steve stops trying to Hoover Tony’s soul out through his mouth does Tony realize he’s a good four, almost five feet off the ground. Steve lets him down with a pout that Tony refuses to capitulate to, but it’s a near thing. Panting like he’s just run a mile, Tony looks Steve in the eye and says: “Not that this isn’t—”
She almost rears back. Almost. “Of course he does. Tony kisses everybody. Platonically, anyways.”
“Just so I’ve got it right,” Tony finally says after an unbearably quiet moment, a palm pressed against his own forehead, “you definitely had zero input vis à vis this whole blind date setup?”
“Huh. Didn’t think you’d notice.”
Steve—walks through the main doorway into the kitchen and stops dead in his tracks the moment he lays eyes on Tony, whose thoughts are spinning out at the sight of him. Steve’s presence alone is enough to derail him, but Steve dressed in perfectly tailored slim-fit chinos, a black jacket, and what Tony suspects is nothing more than a plain black T-shirt is icing on a large cake Tony desperately wants to devour.
“I did? When?” Tony wheezes. He occupies himself and his mouth with ice chips and doesn’t look Steve in the eye when he answers:
him. And not only that, he’s
maybe even reality. not in a "you might be a Skrull" kind of way, but in a "this is too good to be true" kind of way.
“I am,” Steve replies. Tony can
He doesn’t say it, but at least Tony looks more relaxed now. Smiling, they both take a sip of champagne simultaneously.
Tony licks and kisses and bites a roadmap across Steve’s neck and throat, leaving bruises that’ll heal all too quickly on his shoulders and the sweet, bulging join where his shoulder meets his neck. When he nibbles on Steve’s earlobe, Tony is rewarded with a hard, hot gasp in his ear and a thrust so hard he about loses one of his fillings,
, oh my—fuck, Steve, fuck,
Steve reaches into his belt and hands Rogers the extra vial. Enough for one trip. He’ll never get
“Not me,” Steve replies, still fidgeting with his wraps. Tony looks bemused.
Just as JARVIS reported, Tony finds the man in question standing outside on the northwest balcony, a stubby glass of something amber in one hand, the other resting on the sleek steel railing in front of him. Steve looks resplendent in the New York glow, dressed to the nines, his hair beaming golden in the city lights and against the flat blue-black sky. He’s smiling, looking off to the side, and Tony is forcefully reminded of the fact that just because something
“Just me?”
“I’ll let you go, then,” Steve says, already leaving the kitchen before Tony can respond with anything. He manages to catch Steve’s eye as he waves back at Tony on his way out.
“You’re the scientist.”
“Better?” Steve murmurs. Tony nods against his chest. He doesn’t let go. Neither does Steve, who seems to fold himself over Tony until they’re more like one person than two, standing there breathing together in Tony’s darkened workshop.
“I told you!”
Steve visibly swallows. "I’m fine,” he says, and he sounds like it. He certainly looks like it, smiling like the free man he is. Fine might actually be the truth, in Steve’s case, even if it isn’t in Tony’s.
, Steve,” Tony breathes, drinking in the sight of dazed, sex-flushed Steve Rogers like it’s his own personal art exhibit, bought and paid for and his for keeps. It’s a dizzying sight, sweet and a little bitter.
and now Tony's got his whole face smushed into Steve's chest, because he's lowkey (not lowkey, not even a little bit) having a crisis/meltdown and Steve is happy to wrap him up in a hug and hold him there in bed with all the lights off as the morning rain comes down outside.
This doesn’t happen much, anymore—Tony coming home late from an event he didn’t want to go to in the first place—but it does still happen, often enough that he and Steve have made something of a routine of it. Nothing elaborate: Steve welcomes him home dressed for bed in sweatpants and a mercifully loose T-shirt, leaning in the doorway or standing on the other side of the kitchen island from Tony, and Tony, still dressed head to toe in Ford or Gabbana or McQueen, tells him stories from the night over (Clint’s) leftovers.
Tony giggles at Steve’s huff, which is really a laugh disguised as exasperation, another one of Steve’s tics Tony knows by heart. The pain and joy of knowing that secretly splits Tony right down the middle—the joy of knowing Steve is a much bigger troll than anyone realizes, the pain of wanting to grab him and kiss him for it—but he hides it all with an elbow to Steve’s ribs and a muttered “jerk” under his breath.
“Steve, it’s okay, I’m just—it’s been a long day, it’s late, I don’t know what this is about, ignore me.”
fingers into him, slow and easy, because Tony is already loose for him, loose where Steve tongue-fucked him open, sweet and sloppy and ready for Steve’s big, strong, beautiful fingers. Tony moans, moans, can’t stop, can’t
That gets a laugh out of Steve, finally, short and low and sweet. “Right in front of me, Shellhead.”
“You said you wanted oblivion,” Steve replies. “I’d like to be the one to give it to you.”
“Don’t be, it’s my fault for losing my head. Heat of the moment, you know how it goes.”
“Just a pet project, nothing major. Hey, have you seen my cable knife anywhere?”
The thought of losing Steve freezes the air in Tony’s lungs.
A man’s flustered voice appears suddenly from behind Duncan, cutting through the noise, words spilling out in a rush. Steve notices heads whipping around to gawk, bug-eyed, at whoever’s just appeared.
,” he whimpers, chasing that pressure against his sweet spot and whining when he can’t get it, squeezing Steve’s shoulders and driving his hips down against his hand for more of those fingers, more,
. Of course any mention of New York is enough to puncture a hole in the moment. Immediately Tony is clamming up, laughter dying a sudden death in his throat.
Pepper calls him in a panic; FRIDAY claims she’s been locked out of all communications barring an emergency. Tony’s not in the workshop, nor is he on his floor; every car in the garage is accounted for, even Howard’s old hot rod. The quinjet is still parked on the helipad at the top of the building. Steve looks high and low for Tony, texting Pepper intermittently
” he cries, literally, big fat tears leaking out of the corners of his eyes as he strains his neck almost backwards to look up at Steve, who gazes back with those big blue eyes of his, awed like Tony’s pleasure really is the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
“How have I never seen these before?” Steve whispers, leaning closer as he does. Tony swallows hard against the shiver that ricochets down his spine hearing that low voice in his ear.
Tony balls up the bandages from Steve’s hands and tosses them over his shoulder onto the chair behind him, a perfectly calculated arch from hand to seat that makes Steve’s head spin. Tony crosses his arms in front of him and hunches his shoulders up toward his ears. “Anyways, I’d rather
he thinks,
Steve has a sneaking suspicion they see more than enough and match his original eyes perfectly.

Based on how Tony looks, Steve can guess he’s equally grimy and due for some shut eye. Neither of them are in fighting form at this point. And it’s still…a lot. To process, that is. Not that there’s actually anything
Tony’s hands can’t seem to decide where they want to go. He settles for putting them on Steve’s forearms. Steve is acutely aware of Tony’s fingertips as they brush over a protrusive vein; he watches hungrily as the blood rushes to Tony’s face when he feels it, too. “I want you to touch me,” Steve tells him. “I
The team settles in with enough snacks to put a rhino in a coma while Tony and Steve head to the back of the room where the vintage projector Tony pulled out of storage for the occasion awaits.
and deep, rounded
“We’re not actually engaged,” Steve mutters. Clint throws his hands in the air and stomps off cursing like
“And you’re—”
That cold feeling floods him again, freezing his heart in place as Steve reaches for the TV remote. The screen flickers on, vibrant colors taking shape as a reporter recounts the events of that afternoon’s attack by the Wrecking Crew and how Iron Man saved the day. The footage captures the moment the bomb exploded, windows blowing out onto the street and the structure collapsing into a heap of rubble and brick dust; it had been fully evacuated by the time Tony showed up on the scene, apparently, and thank goodness.
That’s his last thought before he realizes with a cold shock of dread that Steve has turned him over onto his
But now Steve is moving in the opposite direction Tony wants him to, taking all of the warmth and glow of the moment with him.
“Mmm, that’s nice. That’s perfect, Tony,” he groans, right into Tony’s ear. At this angle Tony can fuck back, and he does, pushing his hips back every time Steve thrusts up, and he drinks in the low, punched-out sound that comes out of Steve’s mouth with a smile and a long, laving lick to the column of Steve’s throat, tasting his sweat and memorizing the heady salt tang of it on his tongue. “O-oh, fuck,
is far more interesting.
” he’d replied instead, pinching his thigh hard enough to dissuade his blood from flowing further south.
Tony downs half his drink and barely conceals a little hiccup behind his hand, which shouldn’t be so goddamn cute on a grown man Tony’s age, on
And, Christ, has Tony thought about kissing Steve Rogers. A lot. A man can fit a fair few fantasies into the span of a decade, after all. But here he’d thought he’d imagined them all: post-battle snogs, sweet and lingering kisses under sprigs of mistletoe; hell, he’d entertained more than a few iterations of their wedding day kiss at the altar. But this: this hot, almost devouring kiss, Steve’s hands firm on his hips, lifting him bodily without struggle and keeping his feet a few inches above ground, is beyond anything Tony could have ever imagined.
The blood rushing in Tony’s ears drowns out the sound of voices past and present. All he can see is Howard filling the frame in that horrible tan suit, gripping a bottle of bourbon by the neck. The image catches on young Tony’s terrified expression, the way he hides behind the shield that’s almost as big as he is. He watches his own mouth move—
To Steve’s surprise, Tony doesn’t even blink when he says: “What if I told you I think about that exact scenario every time you walk into a room?”
Coupled with the fact that Tony would much rather be at home in the tower with Steve, and his nerves surrounding recent developments with said supersoldier, it’s any wonder that he’s still willing to go on that stage and stump for a charity that definitely spent more money on this event than on—Tony peers more closely at the name of the foundation on the pennant—
Steve’s idea.
, every inch, every vein and ridge, the flared tip of his cockhead where it meets the shaft, and then he’s thrusting back in with a grunt, so hard and deep Tony’s head rocks back against Steve’s hand, “and fuck you any way I want, whenever I want. Feed you my cock until you can’t think of anything else. And you said I could do whatever I want, Tony. Remember that?” He does it again, slower this time—draws out, so slow Tony feels
“I won’t ask how it all went,” they whisper conspiratorially, “but do tell me one thing: is Bruce alright?”
Tony might actually die like this, pinioned on Steve’s cock, gasping for breath against the man’s hungry mouth, being pet like a wild horse that needs gentling, but what a way to go.
under his hands, strong and warm and just small enough to envelope in a hug if Steve let himself, if Tony wanted him to, and Tony
“No, it’s okay,” Steve tells him, watching Tony’s shoulders relax with a noticeable drop of a few inches as he says it. He wants to run his hands over them and draw him into a hug, wrap himself around Tony and never leave. He crosses his arms in front of his chest instead. “Like you said, no big deal. We’ll take care of it tomorrow.”
“The time is currently ten twenty-nine.”
, because if Steve kisses him now and regrets it, Tony will never recover.
“Penthouse,” Tony answers blithely. Steve nods, smiling to himself as if he’s thinking,
“Who wants to know?”
Except when he does try, pressing his hands against Steve’s shoulders to push him around and down onto the bed, he’s met with pure resistance, a steel wall of Steve Rogers, who looks half-starved and is staring at Tony like he’s a whole meal.
He read it cover-to-cover twice before he went looking for Tony in the workshop to thank him with a hug. One of the few they’d ever shared, and all the more precious for it.
“I’m sorry, Steve.”
Tony mock-gasps, pressing a hand high on his chest. “Mr. Rogers! Are you saying you think you’re better than
Tony looks sitting on that bench, staring at his own hands.
“You got it, honey,” Steve says, laying a kiss to Tony’s slack, drooling mouth before pulling out with a filthy wet
“If you’ll excuse me, sir,” Steve says deferentially, already moving away from Pierce toward the circle of black suits hovering around Tony and Thor like expectant vultures at the feast. His heart is in his throat, racing.
all the while. Tony is crying, now, unabashedly, moaning every time Steve kisses his body, gasping every time he feels another blurt of Steve’s come splash against his insides, and he can’t. stop.
“We broke up because you didn’t want the world to know about us,” Steve grumbles. “Now everyone definitely knows, and it took you almost dying for them to find out.”
When Steve reaches up and takes Tony’s hand, he gets to watch
“What
looking, like Tony is a jigsaw puzzle and Steve’s just found the missing piece. It’s an unnerving look, piercing through and exposing parts of Tony he’s spent years hiding under layers and layers of false confidence and sarcasm and armor, so much armor—shiny, pretty tricks to draw people in and keep them at a safe distance at the same time.
act. That he’s doing it in no small part for Wanda goes without saying.
“Not if you don’t mean it,” Tony whispers, inches away from the long swooping bow of Steve’s mouth, hands bracing the hard column of Steve’s neck where he can feel the man’s pulse leap under his palm. Their foreheads tip forward and connect, breaths comingling in the half-dark. Voice thick, Tony says, “I can’t—I can’t, if you don’t mean it,” and he’s tired, so tired of waiting, tired of touches with no meaning, tired of holding his breath when Steve’s in the room, tired of keeping this love to himself. But Steve’s right in front of him, standing tall and broad and looking for all the world like a man on a mission.
“What else have you been working on today? This pet project?”
Steve smiles. Tony smiles back.
He’s so preoccupied with holding all the disparate parts of himself together and hiding them so Steve can’t see, he doesn’t notice Steve’s hands start to rub his back in long, soothing strokes until Tony is half-melted in his steady arms, weak-kneed at how comforted he feels. Steve doesn’t say anything—just keeps moving his hands, up and down Tony’s back, across his shoulders, along his arms, and over again. He can’t remember the last time someone touched him like this, without motive, ulterior or otherwise; his skin feels warm down to his toes.
. Want to feel
under his breath. It doesn’t sound embarrassed or insulted. When he opens his eyes, Steve finds Tony watching him so avidly, it’s hard to notice anything else other than the way the man’s pupils have dilated considerably and is leaning forward, almost over the bowl.
“I said let go of me, Mall Cop! I’m
The man’s words trail off as Duncan steps aside to let him through to his seat. Steve is standing—when did he stand up?—and realizes with a jolt (and an unmistakable, overwhelming
Adjusting the loosened knot of Steve’s tie with confident, nimble fingers, Tony continues: “After I’m done, we’re gonna get in my car and drive home, and then I’m going to strip you down, suck you off, and ride you through the mattress.”
And here he thought he’d shoved that addiction down just as well as he had the alcohol.
So when Tony feels the itch start in his fingertips, that telltale tacky dryness prickle in his mouth, after days of fighting everyone from the prisoners at the Raft to corrupt SHIELD agents and dinosaurs in the Savage Land, he goes dark. Says goodnight to Jarvis and the team, the
“Tony.” Oh, no. He knows that ‘Tony,’ and it’s everything he can do to not shut his eyes as he braces himself for what comes next: “Could you—turn around?”
the one who should be relieved, to bring it up again.
Steve shrugs, and immediately the little white bubble of hope in Tony’s chest—ballooning somewhere behind the arc reactor—deflates with a pathetic, droning
even though he’s lived less than seventy-two hours without it, but that’s seventy-two hours (plus/minus seven years and change) too long. He’s getting impatient, putting things back the way they were just to get to where he should have been all along, and he doesn’t want to waste a minute watching Dr. Foster sleep when he knows he could be spending that precious time getting back to Tony.
Tony surrenders to the hug. Wraps his arms around Steve’s neck and hangs there, letting the tears fall as they may. He knows Steve can smell the salt, can probably feel the skipping rhythm of Tony’s heart against his own chest, but hopefully Steve will chalk it up to Tony’s exhaustion running its course and not the fact that Tony is so happy here in Steve’s arms he never wants to leave.
that made Steve throw his head back and guffaw, but that beaming smile and the way his laugh booms and echoes across bustling 5th Avenue is unlike anything Tony ever saw when he and Steve were together.
“This one does.”
The Sanctum Sanctorum is remarkably unscathed despite being surrounded on all sides by Chitauri carcasses and broken alien tech. Dust from the rubble and ash permeates the air so thickly it’s like trying to breathe plaster of Paris without a mask. Steve coughs as he knocks on the front door, grateful all over again to be cured of his asthma.
.” Steve’s eyes slip closed and he loses himself briefly in wondering memories, of Iron Man cutting a fiery line across the sky in the middle of battle, the whine of repulsors and the subsequent blasts...
“Tony, they’re literally professional spies. Of course they’d know.”
“God, Tony…” he says, a low rasp that comes from somewhere deep inside him. In the low light of Tony’s bedroom, the arc reactor lights up Steve’s roving eyes an even more vivid blue, deepens the unfathomable black at the center of them until Tony feels like he’s falling in headfirst. “You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.”
Steve hitches him up one-handed to straddle his thigh and rolls his hips forward with the kind of single-minded resolve Steve usually reserves for the battlefield. Now he’s using it to grind his erection against Tony’s through their clothes and drive him straight from aroused to completely fucking
“Not me.” He tries not to sound so pitiful, but saying it out loud just brings home how much it’s started to wear on him, being the exception to this, the most tender expression of Tony’s affection, platonically or otherwise.
Like a dog with a bone, this guy. That’s why he won’t let go of Tony’s wrist—it’s not an affectionate touch at all, Tony realizes despairingly, but a way to keep Tony in place, rooted to the spot until he tells Steve the truth.
process, but just seeing the photo the first time had been enough to put Steve in a bit of a state, and he’s still trying to shake that off. It’s not real, after all. There’s nothing to be in a state over, period.
without this—he’ll never know. Denial, rivers, Egypt, yadda yadda yadda.
But then, the image shifts into a sharper memory still, and Tony feels something old and awful claw its way from somewhere deep in his chest, remembering all too well what comes next. It tastes like bourbon and cigar smoke and the metallic taste blood leaves on the tongue after you’ve been smacked in the mouth. Tony’s hands fly out to clutch the sides of his chair and stick there; he can’t move them to stop the projector in time. It just keeps playing out, each frame worse than the one before.
painted
Nothing about this is
to be special to Steve. That’s what’s horrible.
“Ah, you love me,” Steve teases. As they reach the bottom of the stairs, Tony turns toward him again and smiles, bright and brazen. Steve turns and looks a little stunned at what he sees written there on Tony's face.
Tony wants so much. Too much. Asking Steve for this would tip things precariously toward the latter. But the question is taken out of Tony’s hands the moment one of Steve’s perches itself under his jaw and tilts his face up.
He looks lighter. Younger. Fuller.
for those things.
Tony licks his lips. Steve tries hard not to stare.
Tony’s slightly hysterical, religion-hopping thoughts immediately hush. He’s always been weak for the way Steve says his name, with its soft
Rhodey texts him.
“I think he has,” Steve sighs. At Natasha’s quirked eyebrow, he crosses his elbows over his knees and sighs, “He doesn’t kiss me.”
“Holy
There’s a give and take to it, just like everything they do together, on the battlefield and off. Giddily Tony reminds himself
, Steve reminds himself as he opens the door to the restaurant. He’s immediately enveloped in dark tones of bluish green and the smooth voice of Frank Sinatra. He’s early, but the staff brings him through immediately to an intimate but decently large corner table in the back. A waiter, bald-headed but sporting an impressive mustache and wearing the hell out of a purple three-piece suit, pours Steve a glass of champagne and another for his date, who’s starting to cut it close, time-wise.
Even as the world whites out in a deafening blast of fire and stone, Tony thinks he hears Steve screaming his name.
Maybe tonight won’t be a wash after all.
Steve smiles at him and rubs a thumb up against Tony’s hole, smearing the mess around and back inside him. Tony drops his head and whimpers, clutching Egyptian cotton for dear life as Steve moves, sliding his knees up to bracket Tony’s hips before he pulls his cheeks apart again and nudges the head of his cock against his rim. It flutters on contact, desperate for more of that perfect heat, more of Steve filling him up to bursting; Tony nods, biting a knuckle as Steve slides in, easy as anything. God, he’s so open; Steve’s fucked him loose and sloppy wet.
“Alright! And what about you, Harley?” Steve asked.
Tony was livid. Absolutely livid.
“I guess this is the wrong time to come in,” Jan said as she walked in with a bundle of plain bland clothes.
Tony looked down. His hand was smashed into his phone. Fuck, that was one way to butt dial.
“You can be yourself. A marriage should not mean that you stifle that part of yourself for another,” Steve said.
“What do you want, baby,” Steve all but growled.
Steve looked down. Why was he always gone for the taken ones.
“I don’t think that’s important,” Iron man grouched, “we should be glad that the Stark’s kept Captain America’s history alive.”
There was a brief moment of quiet where Tony just stood there, holding his rabbit heart, and just breathed.
“Coming,” Steve replied.
While he was scrubbing himself off, a big burly dom came forward and leered at Tony, “hello, gorgeous. Mind scrubbing my back?”
Hackles raised, Tony walked towards the small enclosure, gun drawn. The noise stopped abruptly.
Tony felt incredibly embarrassed, sitting next to Bucky in the small back room without saying anything.
They went into the showers together. The other doms stayed away, focusing on their subs or themselves. Tony watched them wearily as the water washed down his back before he felt a strong hand touch his shoulder.
“Let me introduce you to my friends,” Steve blurted.
Steve frowned. He knew his brother was a traditional ‘
“Central park,” Steve said.
At that, some of the old Tony pulled through, staring at Rogers like he was crazed, “you’re a strange one.”
“Not that kind of Stark, unfortunately,” Tony smiled ruefully, lying through his teeth.
“This shouldn’t be possible,” Steve laughed, “is this some kind of joke?”
“We don’t know what happened to many of your comrades,” the man in the white coat- Reed Richards said, “much of Captain America’s history was lost to time.”
“Fuck off, Rogers hasn’t even touched the sub. No hickeys no nothing. This pretty sub is ripe for the taking,” the dom, Hammer, said, leaning over to grab Tony’s arm.
So they hatched a secret plan. Something Tony went along with.
The blonde jumped, looking at Tony and Peter in bewilderment, “what?”
As fucking normal as it got in NYC.
The man frowned but nodded, “alright.”
He closed his eyes, hoping, like a child, that this would all disappear if he couldn’t see it.
And the world came crashing down.
my lord.”
“Good boy,” Steve teased with a small lazy smile, “I'm going to line myself up now.”
And they did. They always did.
Rogers had the audacity to look hurt, “Tony, I have no clue what you are talking about.”
“Hammer. If you hit on Rogers’ sub, he’ll skin you,” another dom said.
Tony was sure if Obi was the one who killed him, he’d be given a medal and consolation for killing such a troublemaking sub. But because it was Tony…
Steve. He just allowed Steve to set up his plan with very little input from Tony and leave. Tony told himself he was fine with never seeing Steve again. That Steve only was a passing interest. Tony would be fine. He would have to be fine.
He dragged the carcass over his shoulder and brought it to the cabin where he skinned the animal and cooked it over an open flame. He used the whole animal. He combed the skin and dried it over the fire to be made into furs he could use for the winter. He made jerky out of the meat with salt he traded for from the local market, making sure that it would last until his next hunt. He even cooked the organs in an ancient pot, making soup out of the leftovers with the last of the vegetables he grew in the garden. He didn’t like killing but he would do so to survive.
He winced. He had not heard his own voice in a long time and hearing it now… well it was an experience. An unpleasant one.
“Someone monitor his heart!”
“You’re in luck,” A gentle hand held his face up, cool blues looking into dull browns, “I would not share a sub as pretty as you with anyone.”
Tony jumped at the chance to leave, almost bolting to the back room to collect himself. He sat down on the floor, having a small panic attack in the corner of the back room. God it had been so long since he saw his ex, the only person he ever loved, and he looked so good. So handsome. It wasn’t-
“Of course you are alive, friend Stark! The mighty Mjolnir brought you back to us!”
“Is there someone else?” Rogers- no, Steve asked.
“It’s me, it’s Bucky from high school, oh god it’s been a long ass time,” Bucky said smiling, and, at that handsome smile, Tony remembered instantly who it was. He felt his stomach turn inside out.
“Good,” Tony said with a bright smile.
“We have to break the news gently-“
“Do you have any relatives?” Tony asked.
“I’m so sorry,” Tony said, rushing over to pick up the cup.
A voice like a thousand melodies said, promised, “I do.”
, more than once, and it will chip away at your soul, bit by bit.”
“Alright, children, settle down,” Reed sighed, rolling his eyes like this was a common argument for the two to have.
“Meeee!” Morgan screamed but Harley stayed a little quiet.
“He really got you wrapped around his finger,” Clint whistled.
Tony looked down at his prison assigned shoes. All his life, he was under the control of others. It wasn’t fair. He stood up and followed a bored Rogers, keeping a weary eyes on the other doms and subs. Surprisingly, none of the other doms looked at him or leered at him. Even Tiberius the guard seemed to be looking at his nails rather than Tony. It was strange.
“Oh, I meant to say, this is a prototype. I also bought some parts and tools so that you can tinker with it and make it better?” Steve said, holding out another bag.
“No, I deserve it,” Rogers said.
Tony’s eyes widened. He knew what that meant. He knew what that meant for him.
“You should get that mammogram,” Steve said one day.
“That’s right,” Clint laughed low and dark, “be a good lap dog.”
Tony raised a brow, “who’s Steve?”
“No freaking way!” Tony laughed- guffawed even, “Brucie-bear tell me mo-“
Tears ran down his face and he curled on himself, weeping. When highschool was up, his life was over. Over and done. He wept for a life he could not control. For the unfairness of life. Once all the tears ran its course, he laid there feeling helpless. Helpless and alone.
Tony sighed, waved off the projection and looked down at his phone. He already had the number typed out on the screen.
“That’s enough, J,” Tony snapped.
Steve peeled out slowly until he was all the way out before ramming back in. Tony keened, head thrown back in pleasure, “more. Harder. Please, please-“
“Why not ask for more?”
“Later, Tony,” Steve tried, but Tony wasn’t having it. In fact, his lover seemed inconsolable, even more fearful when Steve tried to convince him that it wasn’t going to happen. That he wasn’t going to punish him. Compliments didn’t even seem to help.
But the omega was a good few feet ahead of him, walking briskly down the campus.
“Why?”
Tony took the bag from Steve and looked at the contents. He laughed, a genuine happy laugh that Steve never heard before. He wanted to hear it again.
“I’m… sorry?” Tony answered, heart sinking.
“What?” Steve asked, fearing the worst.
“Faster,” Tony whispered quietly.
“And the other times?” The man asked curiously.
He left without another word.
, she continued.
The why he said it- it made Steve want to believe him. But… to believe him, he’d have to believe that Hydra actually did take over the world. Steve didn’t want to believe it. Even though it was irrational thinking, Steve wanted to believe he had made a difference in the world when he died for his country. He didn’t want to believe that his death meant nothing.
“Yeah,” Tony said softly, watching Steve leave.
Tony was in a daze as Steve left the coffee shop. He wondered if the man was waiting for anyone to begin with.
“That’s the first time Tony’s said something without prompting,” Bucky grouched, eyeing Rogers.
“What did you get convicted of?” Tony asked softly.
“I see,” Rogers glanced between them, lingering an icy glare at Banner, “you may continue. Don’t let my presence stop you.”
“What?” Tony rasped, eyes wide with shock.
“I’m not. I’m worried about you. You can’t live like this forever,” Steve walked over to the window, “Greg knows this… it’s why he set you up on that date before right?”
Flickers of light emitted from the
“I’ll only tell you after you leave,” Tony said through gritted teeth.
“Yeah, what chu doing, Uncle Stevie?” Bucky grouched, knowing full well what he was doing.
“Ransom sacrificed a lot when he married me. He sacrificed rising in the army, he sacrificed his dreams of going abroad to fight for our country, he sacrificed a lot. It’s only reasonable that I do the same,” Tony said. It sounded like he repeated this sentiment many times to himself over the years.
“You got everything set?” Ransom asked.
“But you have super strength!”
“Please,” Tony rolled his eyes, “as if any man would dare look at me when I have you breathing down my neck.”
Tony had expected a change after that. Had expected that Rogers would show some possessiveness over his sub. Had expected to be tied down and fucked, willing or not.
“What kind of pancakes would you all like?”
“I can barely believe it,” Tony rolled his eyes.
“No,” Howard dismissed immediately.
“What? What do you mean?” Tony’s stomach sank, “didn’t we… didn’t we win?”
Alarm bells rang in Tony’s head. He heard horror stories about the going ons in prison showers. He tried to make himself small, saying, “I’m fine here.”
And Tony saying, “I’m ready.”
Tony revealed his tear streaked face from Steve’s chest, “truly?”
“You’re Tony Stark,” the redhead said conversationally.
Banner happily continued, and, after a tentative minute, Tony did so too.
“Alright?” Tony intoned suspiciously.
“Why’s that hot shot?” Bucky grouched.
Steve gave Tony exactly what he wanted, not holding back anymore, he slid in and out, cock slapping against Tony’s ass making loud obscene sounds. The next door doms were not going to be able to sleep tonight. Pity, Steve didn’t care.
“Why are you making this so difficult?” Steve asked.
“Thanks, Steve, truly,” Ransom said, smile weakening before pulling Steve into a hug.
“Just one night,” Tony warned.
“What? Who said that?”
“Please call me, Steve.”
Steve stopped, sobbing softly. He did it. He ended their relationship, planting the last stake in his coffin.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Tony rasped quickly.
He went into his room and worked for the next couple of hours.
“Is that not the term? Hang out? Doesn’t it mean to meet up for casual conversation?” Steve asked uncertainty.
“God,” Bucky chuckled darkly, “what happened to the great Tony Stark?”
“Does Greg know?”
“Should I sic Clint on him,” the quiet dom said.
“You gave us all quite the fright.”
But Tony was happy with Ransom, they had two beautiful children together. Harley and Morgan were precious. Steve was happy to play the cool uncle. He was happy to be Tony’s brother in law.
“But that doesn’t mean I don’t have an angle, correct?”
Tony startled out of his thoughts, blinking at the huge hulk of the Adonis. How could someone so large be so quiet?
“You know,” Bucky said, “it takes a lot of nerve to come here.”
“I- I mean, I have nowhere to go…” the man said, looking confused. Tony did not think he looked cute, confused like that, he did not.
When they had no roof over their head and their stomachs were empty, she held him behind the dumpsters and said, ”we’ll get through this,
“No… after Obadiah Stane was murdered by-“
“Steve, you ok in there?” Tony called out.
“I would say it’s nice to meet you all,” Steve frowned, sitting up.
“Oh, I understand,” Tony laughed, a little hysterical, “I understand…”
“What could have caused this?” Natasha snapped.
“I will,” Ransom promised.
“Nothing yet, whatever secrets Rogers is hiding, he seems to be keeping even from Barnes,” Natasha said.
“Ye-yeah,” Sharon said, confused, before leaving the room with some stock. Leaving Bucky alone with Tony.
“Get out!” Tony nearly shouted as Greg picked up his jacket to leave, laughing softly at the click of the door closing behind him.
“No…” Tony said quietly.
Steve let go, almost reluctantly, “sorry, I’ll be seeing you soon, I suppose.”
He tore through the first meal with the single minded focus that he’d usually give his machines. When he was done, he eyed the second meal forlornly.
“I’ll pilot the sub topside,” the man in red- Hank Pym said, turning and leaving the room.
“What?” Tony blinked, grasping hat his weak heart as he blearily looked up at- a man who looked like he came out of Tony’s wet dream, Captain Steve Rogers.
He was taken into the back room and showed several videos, all of them quite straight forward. They were mostly filler, if anything. Tony knew his way around coffee, he’d drunk the best of the best and this shit wasn’t it. Well, coffee was coffee, even coffee from a famous fast food chain.
“I don’t know what happened. They had such a perfect marriage. Obadiah Stane was such a great dom to his sub. How could this have happened.”
“If- if something happens to me, I need to know that Tony would be in good hands,” Ransom said, “can I trust you, Steve?”
“What? You filthy rich subs don’t piss and shit like us commoners?” The dom asked.
At Steve’s confused serious look, Tony added quickly, “on a date. He made me go on a date.”
Steve decided, if Greg wasn’t going to tell him, he’ll have to find this Tony on his own. It was fine, he worked better on his own anyway.
“Where were you living before this?” Tony asked.
Tony swallowed his fear, his pain from the last 18 years of his life. Ever since he found he was a sub. Ever since he found out he was to marry his godfather.
. Stark men were made of iron after all. Yes, Tony was nervous.
A frown weakened Tony’s smile. Ever since they moved, Peter had been struggling. It was made worse when he somehow got the attention of bullies. Tony couldn’t help feeling guilty. There was nothing he could do. Not talking to the teachers, not to the principal, nothing helped. Peter missed the old house they lived in.
When there was no response, Tony leaned over the bundle of blankets and shook his son gently awake, “Peter, wake up, it’s time for school.”
Then, when there was a slowing down of traffic, his manager and boss, according to her name tag her name was Sharon, came to him with a smile, “oh! You’re Tony.”
The two brothers would be combined. Gregory at the forefront, while Tony tagged behind. It worked, for the most part. Tony was left to his own devices while Gregory would take the glory and the fame. Tony was ok with this.
Anthonio Stark was never the favorite child. He accepted that.
“Daddy! Where are the lions?” Peter yelled, pointing at the cage.
“No, but-“
That took all the fight out of Rhodey, “what?”
“We’ll see about that, Peter,” Tony said.
“Oh,” Reed chucked, “yeah, we all have powers if that’s what you’re asking. We’re the first responders at any major disasters that Hydra causes. Hydra doesn’t care about the people, so we’re the ones that have to protect them.”
“What the fuck am I supposed to do?” He wiped his face, “I’m just some normal guy and Rogers is…”
Humble and strong with morals, Rhodey was liking this guy more and more.
Bucky misinterpreted Tony’s hesitant answer and said, “hey, it’s all water under the bridge. We are all friends here.”
“I… do,” Steve said, swallowing. God, he felt like he was going to cry.
“Oh, Steve, good,” Tony said with a relieved smile, “why aren’t you at work?”
Snow fell early in Autumn. The rust red and yellow leaves were coated with a crisp light frost. The air midsted on his lips as he tracked down his latest meal, a brown backed white bellied deer scampering through the woods. He pulled up his rifle, breathing slowly, inhaling and exhaling. He took his shot, aiming right and true. The bullet pierced through the deer’s head, giving it a quick and painless death. Excellent. Steve smiled, sauntering over to his kill. He will be eating pretty tonight.
“Then what’s the problem?” Steve asked, pulling back.
It was the longest night he’d ever experienced. Longer than his wedding night.
“Jarvis, can you tell us what’s wrong with Tony?” Steve asked.
Sweat and uneasiness drowned Tony as he grasped at his false heart. Yinsen’s tired face looked at him with those tired, weary eyes. Quickly, Steve swept into the conversation, “you’re my friend. That doesn’t make you super does it?”
“Don’t say sorry,” Steve said quietly. There was something soft in Steve’s ocean eyes.
“Then what’s the problem?” Steve asked.
“Daddy’s Tony Stark of Stark Industries,” Peter answered innocently.
Steve walked into the cell, disregarding where Tony sat completely, walking to the sink and washing up. Tony watched, feeling that familiar feeling of hopelessness and jealousy. If he was born a dom, he could do as he pleased. If he was born a dom, perhaps Howard would have loved him. If he was born a dom, he wouldn’t be here, because Obi would never have touched him.
When ‘James’ saw him, he instantly recognized him apparently, “Tony?”
“You sure? You don’t have to,” Tony said.
“Honey, wait for me. I’ll be back for you,” Ransom said.
Tony dropped the dishes in his hands into the soap water. He couldn’t even look at Ransom, “what?”
“Of course! He’s a strong alpha! Of course he’ll be fine,” Steve said with a small smile.
That was when ‘the alpha’ and his friend turned up.
Tony shivered, “it’s a deal then.”
“Don’t
Tony thought that was the last time he’d see Rogers again until Rogers took out his receipt and scribbled something onto it, “Here’s my phone number. Call me.”
it was all too overwhelming.
But then- “are you Captain America?”
Tony didn’t say anything, scrunching himself up and holding himself like he would to fall apart if he didn’t.
It confused Tony to no end. Rogers was all swagger, he walked through the prison like he owned the place. But he was a prisoner, just like Tony was. What made him so different?
“Tony,” Rogers said quietly, “you may leave.”
He walked towards the noise, bare foot on the grass. It seemed to be coming… from the guest house?
Steve was in love with his brother’s husband.
Once he was done, he pulled the sobbing sub into his arms, “You did so well. So well.”
“Capsicle?” The phrase the robot used threw Steve off.
The switch looked a tad displeased, “yeah, that’s me.”
“I’m not-“ Tony chewed his lower lip, “I’m not interested in Sasha.”
“You’re going to tell me what the hell is going on in the next 5 minutes or I’m going to bash someone’s face in,” Steve said in his most authoritative tone, snapping out of his restraints easily and sitting up to regard the strangers with angry blue eyes.
Tony looked at him meaningfully, “you know. I used to be a playboy before I met Ransom. I thought I’d never settle down and have a family. I thought I was too broken for that. But Ransom taught me differently. I hope you find someone who can teach you that too, because you aren’t the playboy type. I know you, Steve. You yearn for a family just like I had.”
Sarah’s face was a bit strange when she got home from the mammogram the next week.
Tony again remained silent.
“Good,” Tony ruffled Peter’s hair, “I’ll get you something yummy at the end of work.”
The world seemed to narrow around Steve’s vision.
”I want to apologize,” Steve said simply.
Steve wondered if he dropped into subspace.
What?” Tony asked cautiously without taking a step closer.
As Tony left the room, he chuckled as he heard Peter jump on the bed with excitement.
“Fuck, we have the same given name,” the dark haired alpha said but Rhodey ignored him.
“Just for three months. That means you’re the man of the house, Harley,” Ransom said, kneeling down.
“I… uh, lost people too, so I get it, but probably not in the way you do I mean-“ Tony continued awkwardly. It didn’t seem to fill any of that silence even as Tony rambled on about loss.
“Bucky? Clint? I don’t know, someone you’re waiting for outside-“
Steve had hope.
“Are you alright, Tony?” Rogers asked, “fuck, I forgot to ask when you last ate. Refeeding syndrome is a bitch.”
Tony paused. He never talked about what Obadiah did to him to anyone. No one cared. But, from the look in Steve’s cool blue eyes, he knew that Steve cared in a way no one else had. Maybe that’s what made him spill.
“Good, baby, now use those colors if it gets too much,” Steve nipped against Tony’s neck, “what’s your color?”
his father had snarled at him. Tony was grateful that Peter was not in the room when Howard said it,
Tony didn’t blame him. He rolled in his sheets, a plan materializing in his mind. It wasn’t an easy-to-execute plan, and he would be lying to a lot of people, but it was important to stop the paths that lead to his death and the deaths of others from ever taking place.
“I- I didn’t know-“ Rogers began but Bucky stopped him, “there’s nothing to apologize for.”
“You better, little brother,” Ransom said with a cheeky grin, before his smile turned serious, “thank you, Steve. Truely. I can’t trust anyone else. If anything happened to me… you’re the only one I can trust with this.”
Rogers walked over to Tony, leaning down, “afraid I’d use you tonight?”
me. You know I’m right. I’m trying to look out for you man.” Bucky said.
Bucky couldn’t look at Steve and Steve felt the tension drip down his back.
Tony closed his eyes but he couldn’t sleep, no matter how much his body screamed for relaxation, having someone’s arms around him set off all his alarms. He stayed awake, listening to his own rabbit heart beat. The dom wasn’t doing anything to him now, but it didn’t mean he’ll
Steve frowned. This was the first time Greg mentioned having a brother, let alone a twin. And he let his twin get hurt.
Steve felt his whole world collapse as Tony stared at the both of them, eyes wide, heart broken.
“It’s a long story, Buck.” Code for:
How could his father do this to him? Useless anger coursed through him. His father never loved him and this was proof.
“What, I can’t listen to my husband’s laughter before I leave for an uncertain amount of time for war?” Ransom laughed.
Tony said nothing. He wanted desperately to wash out his mouth but he couldn’t do so without showing the dom his back. It was the first thing Obi taught him, never show your vulnerable underbelly to a predator.
“I-“ Tony winced, voice rough from lack of use, “I’m alive.”
“Fuck off, Barnes,” Tony snarled, “let me go.”
“I’m ready if you are,” Clint’s smile was icy and sharp, getting into a fighting stance.
He instantly knew something was off about the air, there was something… just not right. And through all his dealings with the Fae, he learned to trust his instincts.
“Jarvis…” Tony rasped.
“-god, we found him before Hydra-“
Tony tried to relax, but his heart rate speed erratically, body anticipating pain. His breathing went rabbid and his eyes widened with fear until Steve kissed him, slow and languid. Then he remembered, he was here with Steve. Steve would not hurt him. He promised he’d go slow. He’d prioritize Tony over his own pleasure.
“I don’t know if I have the time,” Tony lied.
The man looked visibly sick, “why would I do that?”
There were little customers at this point, most lingering in the shop at tables doing work. Tony just loitered, doing some cleaning, when a customer went into the store. Tony turned his head, “hello, welcome.”
As the moon and sun moved apart, Tony realized that it would be at least another year before he was able to go back. If he’d live that long. He stood on shaky feet and explored his surroundings. There was a dark forest behind him and he shivered. He vowed to live long enough for the next eclipse. He vowed to destroy all those who sent him here to die.
“Because I want you to change that. And I think you can, big strong handsome alpha like you,” Rhodey smiled.
Even though the Bucky guy still looked angry, he listened to what Steve said, something that impressed Rhodey greatly.
“No… no one… I couldn’t…” Tony sighed, “after I came back… I found out my godfather was selling Stark weapons behind our back and I- it was my fault… I trusted him more than Greg-“
“I was… betrothed to my godfather, the moment my designation was shown,” Tony said quietly, “my father was not pleased to find out his only was a sub, you see, so he was quick to find a dom for me. He didn’t want any doms knocking on our door to ask my hand in marriage. Nor did he want any doms to force me to submit and steal the company away from him. So he chose his business partner.”
The source of the noise was farther than Steve initially anticipated, but there was billowing smoke that led him to a crater, the epicenter, of which, laid a slick red and gold metallic creature in the shape of a human.
He opened the paper plane and- he frowned, confused.
Steve Rogers seemed to be every bit of the superhero he was in Howard’s stories.
“Steve,” the quiet dom said, “watch your sub.”
This dom, this Rogers, had thrown his privilege of being a dom away and was convicted of something to land him in this prison. Why? Why would he ever do that?
“Name?” The bored man on the other end asked.
“Mr. Rogers,” the red and gold robot said in a distinctly calm tone, “you are welcome to leave. Just be aware that just beyond these walls is several metric tons of icy waters from the Pacific Ocean. If you were to break out now, you might survive and swim to shore or you might become another frozen capsicle in the deep once again.”
Tony kissed Steve, slow and languid. The alpha peeled away his own clothes, shirt and pants, and then, more carefully, Tony’s. He treated Tony delicately, like he would break if Steve pushed too hard. Tony whimpered softly against Steve’s lips when his underwear was peeled away.
“I’ll be right there,” Steve said, hanging up the phone.
Once Morgan saw Steve just standing by, watching Tony like a goddamn stalker.
“Coming, Harley! We better go,” Tony said quietly.
“Uh-“ Steve said dumbly-
“Howard, be reasonable,” Obadiah cooed half-heartedly.
There weren’t any cameras, Tony could have hid all the evidence and run away, but…
“Hello,” Steve asked wearily, “I’d like to take the position.”
“Did you know Bucky killed my parents?” Tony asked quietly.
Tony saw the stars shining in the sky smile down at him, he felt the waves of the ocean cradle him and cuddle him close. Who wouldn’t want to marry the sky and sea? To have someone love him? He smiled softly, serene, “I do.”
He was numb, shaking in Steve’s grasp.
Tony felt his world turn grey. There was always a fourth option…
Tony paid using a slick black credit card, a snide smile on his face as he went over to wait for his drink. He dropped a crisp 5 dollar bill into the tip jar as he went.
Suddenly all the systems went down.
“Get your things and get out. I won’t say it again, Steve,” Tony said, voice calm as he held himself.
Tony swallowed down his nervous tension, his fears, his grief as the camera's lights flashed all around him. He hated this. He felt small, vulnerable. He could hear his father’s disapproving voice in his ear, ‘
Steve blinked, all eyes were suddenly on him.
Steve sighed.
“It’s out of my hands, Tony,” his shitty defense lawyer said, “you plead guilty. That’s what the judge decreed. I’m sorry.”
“It’s almost like you care about Anthony Stark, wait, you do, you’re his bodyguard,” Clint scoffed darkly and sardonically.
Once they were alone, the atmosphere between them went tense.
“Thank you, Steve,” the hand that Tony put on Steve’s arm tingled even after Tony left the room.
, didn’t sound quite right in his head, “yeah?”
“Tony?” Steve asked, concern bleeding into lust. The dom moved away, “are you alright.”
The blonde guard raised his head and Tony flushed dark with embarrassment. The guy was leering at him, stepping forward to touch him, his chest, brushing against his nipples, his hips, his cock, his ass. Tony chewed his tongue to stop from saying anything. He felt like nothing but a slab of meat.
“Why not, daddy,” Peter whined, “you let Uncle Rhodey crash all the time and the man seems nice.”
“Did you learn anything new?” Natasha asked Fury after he left the compound.
“If I were to believe you,” Steve said, “which for the record, I don’t. Who are you fellas? And why is one of you the size of a bug and the other a robot?”
Tony covered his face with his hands and just, laid there. He needed time, time to himself, time to think. Time away from the others. He couldn’t trust them, not after what he’d seen. He couldn’t trust anyone.
“Did what?” Natasha asked with flax innocence.
“It’s Stark not Stane,” Rogers said casually. Tony was almost touched that Rogers remembered. He would be if he wasn’t currently trapped in the dom’s arms.
Tony felt like he was floating as strong arms took him into a warm embrace. The tears that ran down his face were wiped away. He felt warm and safe.
Rogers turned around with a soft, almost kind expression, “can't take a joke, can you.”
“I can watch my dramas more efficiently now,” Tony said.
“Prestigious high profile school, MIT- what are you doing here?” The manager asked.
“Mr. Rogers-“
“And while you’re at it, get yours too, I’m starving,” Rogers said, showing his back to Tony. And that was the end of the conversation.
“You… you are unbelievable, you know that?” Bucky laughed darkly, shaking his head.
“What do you want, boy,” Howard snapped.
He could hear whispers through the black dimness of his vision. Strangers’ voices.
“I’m sorry- I’m so sorry,” Tony buried his face into Steve’s neck.
’ alpha but Steve always thought he was too traditional. He thought Tony had mellowed that part out of him.
He had forgotten what it was like to be free.
“Thank you,” Steve sounded relieved.
Steve nodded but Peter protested, “you don’t make Uncle Rhodey sleep here when he comes over. You never make anyone sleep here!”
“What?” Bucky turned to look at Tony.
“I know…” Tony said, hanging his head.
“Sure thing, buckaroo,” Tony picked up his child and took him to the next exhibit.
“It’s not fair,” Tony covered his eyes with an arm, “it’s not fair.”
“The pleasure is all mine,” Steve answered mechanically.
“Unless you have a secret you’re keeping from us?” Steve poked the girl’s side. The girl giggled as Steve began to tickle her.
“Why haven’t you…” Tony hugged his knees, “why haven’t you used me yet?”
When it first began, Tony nearly dropped his phone. He didn’t expect the supersoldier to call him after the disaster that was the meeting at the park (Tony knew better than to call it a date). But soon getting a call from Steve became second nature.
Or at least that was how the press would frame it as.
“Buck-“ Steve began.
“I have your brother on speed dial. Why would I need to use you to get to him,” Steve said in that soft tone.
“You’ll be perfect for the part of Hamlet.”
“Why are you crying, love?” Steve asked, peeling a stray sweaty hair out of Tony’s face, stroking his lover’s cheek.
“No freaking way! You didn’t!” Tony gasped as more of the members of their group joined.
The whole group went quiet, all staring at Tony. Tony felt himself shrink. Did he do something wrong?
“What’s wrong with him?”
“You killed him,” Steve said quietly.
Greg smiled but it was strained, “what are you apologizing for?”
Then Steve realized what he was saying, “oh god, I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean it! I just wanted to-“
“Fuck you,” Tony rasped, false heart speeding up, “get the fuck out of my apartment.”
“Green means go, yellow means slow down, and red means stop,” Tony repeated, eyes dark with lust.
Iron man let his hands drop, glowing dimming.
“I can’t ask you to-“
his mind cryptically supplied and Steve batted the thoughts away. Now was not the time for misplaced scraps of memories.
“You really hurt him,” Bucky snapped.
As he left the showers, dressed, and wandered into the breakfast area, he saw Banner sitting alone. He walked straight to the lone figure hunched over the food tray and smiled, “hey Bruce.”
“Relax, honey, I’ll make you feel good. I won’t hurt you,” Steve cooed.
And it wasn’t going to happen.
After a while of baking and making pancakes for everyone including Tony, Steve excused himself to use the restroom. He didn’t really need it, he just wanted to check what was taking Tony so long. When he reached the bedroom and heard quiet sobbing, he realized why.
“What is worse- gosh, Steve, really? At the lunch table?” Bucky groaned as Steve carried Tony onto his lap. Tony ate it all up, grabbing onto Steve like a lifeline.
There was a loud
“Hydra rewrote the history books,” Iron man said, “when I grew up, no one talked much of Captain America’s exploits other than his role against Hydra- Hydra’s greatest nemesis and the enemy to the people. But my- Howard Stark. He kept all the memorabilia from the World War 2 era. He had a fascination with Captain America, something that bordered on obsession.”
instead
“Tony, come,” the dom, Rogers, said from outside the cell.
Steve paid her no mind, pressing the plane’s yoke down, down, down towards the pacific. He was never going to make it. Some part of him always knew it, but it was a certainty now. He was going to die, but die saving his country. His people. Peggy.
Steve pulled Tony into a bone crushing hug and the dam broke. Tony sobbed, wrapping his arms around Steve like a vice, never wanting to let go. Romanoff’s sudden appearance had triggered a harsh memory of when he had been kidnapped. He sobbed until he had no more tears left to give. All his mistakes- his and Greg’s but it was mostly his- caught up to him.
“He’s still breathing and his eyes are open, but I don’t think he’s- Tony, Tony- I don’t think he’s conscious.”
“I’m fine,” Tony said mechanically.
JARVIS came to life, “of course, sir.”
“No, it’s Steve,” Steve chewed his lower lip.
After he was done, Rogers shoved the simpering, spluttering dom to the floor, standing up.
“Uh huh,” Tony nodded his assent.
“Did Tony ever tell you about his traumas?” Nat asked.
“Why are you changing the subject,” Greg purred, “what do you have in there, Tony.”
“If you want anything, I might be able to sneak it for you,” Iron man said softly.
Tony startled, “hello?”
Steve slid Tony off his lap, standing up to fight. Bucky stood up as well, ready to defend his sub.
Tony shivered at that. Rogers said that so casually like he was talking about the weather.
Tony went out armed with a flashlight and a small wind gun. The gun was a prototype, made when Tony was bored and wanted to arm Peter with something non lethal. It shot a fist full of air enough to push someone back rather than harm permanently. That was what he hoped to do with whatever animal was making that goddamn noise.
“J, don’t get involved,” Tony snapped.
were distant in his mind. Tony felt slightly spooked, feeling wandering eyes on him as he stepped forward on the red carpet. His wet clothes fell away as he walked towards the altar, leaving behind a rippling white dress suit made out of silk so soft it felt like wearing a dream. A long train like that of a veil covered his face. He was too entranced to notice.
“Tony?” Steve turned to his sub. Tony sat there, back ram rode straight, eyes wide open, glazed, as he stared at a particular spot in the distance.
“But?” Steve asked.
“I do,” Rogers said, conversationally, continuing through a mouth full of food, “I think his last dom abused his drop. More than once.”
Tony didn’t question it, running into the mansion and under cover. The man leaned aside, closing the door behind him.
“What?” Tony froze, but the man just stepped past him and down the hall, “follow me.”
“I don’t blame you,” Steve smiled but it was sad, “When I became Captain America, people stepped over each other to get to me. But you know what I did when I first scented trouble?”
“You’re overqualified,” a manager told him.
“I'm sorry,” Reed blinked.
He thought about running away. He could run away and start anew. Go into one of those omega shelters and pretend to be another person. But Obadiah would look for him, he would relentlessly search until he found Tony.
“You would?” Steve asked, a little hopeful.
His doorbell rang at five in the morning. He had barely opened the door before men in dark suits entered the building.
“Fuck off, punk, this one is mine,” Steve snarled back.
What happened next happened so fast that Tony didn’t quite see it. One second Hammer was trapping Tony’s body between the dom and the tiled wall, the next second the dom was faced down on the floor, unconscious.
The moment was ruined when a small voice squeaked, “Mr. Stark?”
He sat there, finishing his first cup. The trash can was not far, so he threw it… and missed, hitting a buff blonde guy. There was something familiar about the guy…
The quiet switch looked surprised, “hey.. Tony.”
“-can’t believe this is happening-“
He smiled more, felt radiant, became more bold with topics in the group at meal times. And if he wanted anything, any signs of affection at all, Steve gave it to him.
“It’s it your eyes, the way you look at him,” Sharon’s expression was kind, “it’s alright, Steve. I always knew you weren’t really invested in our relationship. But it isn’t healthy to pine for someone you can’t have. You have to move on sometime.”
“Tony,” Steve folded his arms, “you can’t let your brother rule your life.”
“Around,” Steve said noncommittally.
Tony said nothing, miserably shaking back and forth, hugging himself.
“Let go of me,” Tony rasped out, teeth chattering.
“Buck-” Steve pleaded.
“Why so quiet? You were quite chatty last night,” the dom asked as he finished up.
“Bucky!” Rogers snarled, and that was the first time that he looked angry in this whole ordeal.
“What’s wrong?” Steve asked, fully alert, getting out of bed.
“Yeah… but why me?” Tony asked, chewing his lower lip.
Steve didn’t reply, watching Tony’s pretty back disappear.
Steve stared at the weary grim people in the room, eyes wide and lost, “that’s- that’s not possible.”
When he felt his dom slid away from him, he was brought back to the present. Those cold eyes were watching him with an unreadable expression, “your relationship with your former dom…”
“What?” Steve asked, staring at the theater professor.
He wasn’t always this way… or he supposed he wasn’t. He had long forgotten his past existence and he was… content with his current one. He did not know how to interact with other people of this world, the world being too bright and chaotic for him to stand.
“No! No! You aren’t going to tell Greg that you’ve been meeting me!”
“We have to be ten steps ahead of the Mandarin,” Natasha answered, “I was hoping to work out a plan with you…”
“Tony,” Steve asked, concerned, and the dam broke.
“What about you?” Bucky said, letting go out of shock.
At his words, there was a rumbling of thunder and the pitter-pattering of rain down the veranda. Tony held himself in his arms, hunching over. What the hell? The sky was completely clear a minute before. The daylight sky was growing darker by the minute.
Tony felt his body collapsing on itself. He leaned back until his back hit the wall of the cell, arms wrapped around his chest, trying to make himself as small as possible as he rasped out, “I- I can’t-“
“He’s flatlining!”
“You,” Tony said in a small voice.
The next day, he felt a bit better, having slept and having food in him. Rogers wasn’t in bed when he woke up and Tony felt thankful the dom wasn’t there.
do things to him. The clock next to their cell clicked down the time before something happened. He sighed softly, waiting for dawn to break.
“Chocolate!” Morgan shouted.
“Can’t an older brother check on his younger brother without being questioned?” Greg asked, strolling into the apartment like he owned the place. Because he did and they both knew it.
“What are you? A robot? What are all of you? And why do you wear such ridiculous costumes?” Steve asked, curiosity taking the better of him.
Steve kissed Tony deeply, “promise, lover.”
Steve mulled this information over, “where does Tony live?”
Tony went through his day for the next couple of weeks without incident.
It was an open and shut case, Tony was barely lucid through the whole thing. First degree murder. 72 years in state prison. It was a death sentence. Tony was fine with that.
“Tony!”
Ok, that was a lie. He wasn’t exactly happy. He yearned for Tony, burned for him. Steve dated around but he never found anyone like Tony.
“Alright, I’m going on my lunch, you two take care of things,” Sharon said, walking off.
“Stop that!” Steve snapped, grabbing Tony by the shoulders, “Tony-“
His eyes were not deceiving him. A tiny red and black fly flew over him. It was woman shaped. It had a woman’s voice. It had insect wings. It was the strangest sight he’d ever witnessed. Stranger still were the men and what looked like a red and gold metallic robot standing off to the side. Steve stared for a long time; the sight before him too peculiar to ignore.
“I’m a little out of practice,” Sir Anthony says. “More used to anvils than arpeggios these days.”
“And there I thought all the lords and ladies wore clothes made of solid gold,” Steve replies. “That won’t be necessary.”
“What do you mean?” Steve asks - step, step, back two, turn and promenade.
Steve looks down at the mask in his hands. It is leather, moulded to fit the face, dyed dark blue, with fabric to tie the back.
She slows to a trot and Steve sees a small house emerge between the trees, barely more than a cottage. It looks well cared for, with a small garden and clean windows and Steve sees a flicker of light through the window.
There is a loud
“I told him that he had been nothing but courteous and I reassured him that his private life was his own business and none of my concern.”
“Sir Anthony, I am more than capable of handling my own wardrobe,” he hisses.
“I am sorry about your knuckles,” he says, pulling away. “I really did not intend anyone to get hurt.”
But the words! What they had said! A conspiracy against the crown in a place like this. And Hydra! The word is burnt into his memory. He cannot have been mistaken. Had it just been a turn of phrase, or was it a sign of some greater evil to befall?
Steve steps forwards.
“Whatever Stark sent you here to do, it will not work,” Steve says. “I cannot in conscience allow him to continue.”
“There are so many of them, little rules that govern everything, and some days I’d like to say to hell with the lot of them, why not just do what I want?”
“Fine, I’ll stop,” Sam says. “But if you want to stop other tongues from wagging, perhaps you should prevent yourself from staring after him like a man whose lover has gone off to war.”
“The word of The Captain should be enough, I suppose.”
“A true story,” Ms Van Dyne asserts.
“Excellent, excellent,” Tony says. He looks down at the picture in his hands. “I should be going. I promised Colonel Rhodes I would show him my new mare.”
“Steven,” says Bucky’s mother.
“In my experience, it is the things that come with greater difficulty, that end up more worthwhile in the end,” Steve says. Sir Anthony eyes him curiously and then nods, a small smile crossing his face.
Barton would be well placed to smuggle such information out. Although a groom would not have access to the house, perhaps.
Slowly, so as not to make the hinges creak, he pushes open the door.
Sam eyes the crack in the solid oak table and then looks up at Steve, who forces himself to relax. He hasn’t lost control of his strength in years.
Sir Anthony seems relieved by the change of subject and steps forwards. He gives a clear critique of Steve’s painting, although his comments tend towards the more technical, which isn’t entirely unexpected from a man who spends his days drawing blueprints. The conversation continues more lightly after that, and whatever moment had been between them before, it fades. Still there, but buried deeper now, not so close to the surface.
“It’s been a pleasure!” he says. Then, before Tony can say anything in response, he pulls back, plants his feet firmly on the step of the carriage and uses it to push himself into a spinning vault over the heads of the shocked travellers.
“Of course not, and I suppose it was some other mysterious masked man who kissed the baronet’s hand and somersaulted over his head.”
“No, missed by a mile. They’re not trained pistoleers, that’s for certain.”
Yeah, Steve is starting to think his mystery tip-off was on to something. It’s just a pity Steve might be dead before he gets a chance to tell anyone about it. He’d managed to hit Record on his phone before they grabbed him and took his stuff, but that only helps if he gets out of here. Preferably in one piece. His two new friends don’t seem like that is their preferred option.
Iron Man is on his feet in an instant, and his repulsors fire. Steve feels his chest and throat start to relax, although his heart is still beating like crazy. But he can feel the air in his lungs again, not quite full, but better than before.
“I still don't know how you intend to do anything,” he says. “You can hardly stop and search every traveller on the road to Brooklyn. That would be madness!”
Mrs Romanoff frowns, exchanging a glance with Barton.
It’s probably a warning sign that he has a ‘sneaking around’ outfit, but Steve chooses to see it as being well prepared.
“Oh, probably not for days,” Mr Stane says with all outward sign of solicitousness. “He once holed himself up in that workshop of his for over a week.” He sips his brandy with the air of a particularly smug cat. Steve takes a deep breath and lets it out.
” Bucky says to him as Steve sits in the library, drawing up the plans for the night.
Sure, the sketch he’s doing of the Avengers, he’s been drawing Iron Man’s arm for about twenty minutes, but Bucky can’t see his sketchbook.
“What other route?” the woman asks. “This is the only road and you know it. I’m not about to trek across the hills when there’s a perfectly good road here for us. It’s not like we have anything of value on us anyway. We’re not what he’s looking for.”
“So, are you going to call on Sir Anthony today to apologise?”
He wants to punch something, but there is nothing around to fight. Instead he balls his hands into fists.
Luckily, Captain Wilson seems to have no problem filling in the space.
Steve beats a hasty retreat, heading back out into the dim streets of Brooklyn. He can almost hear Bucky’s voice in his head.
“Please tell me you didn’t mention these rumours to Sir Anthony during your conversation,” Sam says.
“Oh, I’m serious,” Sam says. “Haven’t you seen the way Mr Stane glares at you? Word around the village is that he has plans for Sir Anthony’s marriage. You are quite the fly in his ointment.”
They make good time and the sun is barely setting when they reach the inn. The stable is full of horses and four carriages are set down. It must be a popular place, more likely because of its situation on the main road to Brooklyn, direct from the military bases in the north, than through any fault of its owners, Steve deems after seeing the inside.
Things are far smoother now than they used to be. He has honed the process through trial and error, and he has no intention of allowing himself to be put in a position again like he had with Barton.
“Then we shall not keep you,” Steve says.
“So you think these two are smuggling something?”
“Is that everything?” he asks.
He sits there floating in his own body for an age, staring at the crushed remains of the letter. Until a knock on the library door pulls him back to himself as Sam sticks his head in.
She beams as she finishes the tale.
“I thought that as two people new to the area, we should stick together before we are overwhelmed by the locals.” She looks him up and down with a gaze that is a bit sharper than he would have expected.
“Yes,” Sir Anthony replies and he sounds so amused now that Steve has to think about what he just said and examine his words, blushing when he realises.
“Stop where you are,” says the voice of the groom. The same one Steve had found that morning going through his saddlebags. There is a certain irony to that, he supposes.
“Then finally we are on equal footing,” Tony says, grinning widely.
“But if you're not interested in dalliances, you may wish to be careful. He has somewhat of a reputation.”
“So you’d expose me to her wrath instead?” Steve asks.
Sam had had a point. There is no way Steve can search every traveller and cart on the Brooklyn road.
Steve starts five letters before he manages to complete one to his satisfaction. It is short and to the point, but then that is only a mirror of Sir Anthony’s own letter. Steve merely conveys his sympathies for the loss, his gratitude at the generosity and his intention to come to Marvel as soon as possible.
“Most uneventful, which I suppose I should be grateful for, but Hank was anxious that we might be beset by bandits. I find myself sorely disappointed on that case, not a highwayman in sight.” She sighs deeply, looking heartily disappointed. “No adventure at all. I like the countryside as much as anyone, but several hours in a carriage gets very tedious without something to break it up.” She looks very put out at the inconvenience of not being inconvenienced. Steve can’t help a small laugh at her expression.
A blue flash misses him. Steve can feel a strange crackle of air behind him as he skids over the floor and smashes, wheezing again, into the wall. He fumbles the key towards the lost and it takes him two attempts to slide it home, every second he’s expecting to feel one of those blue blasts hit him. He’s braced for the pain of it, but all he hears instead is the drone of repulsors blasting.
“If you must,” Steve says, grinding the words out of his gritted teeth without considering them. It is an abominably rude thing to say to one’s host, but Steve finds he does not care. He has worn out his social graces for the evening.
and he chuckles as he pulls it out.
The place is dark, everyone seeming to be asleep, as he creeps up through the gardens towards it. He is in his Nomad costume, for lack of anything better to wear, because it is better to be seen as Nomad at a distance returning such things than seen as Steve Rogers. There are already enough questions.
“Magic users are not so common that Hydra could afford to put one on every airship. Also, we have a different perspective, up here. Our battles don’t go the same way, or so I’ve heard. You’re an army man, you see things more personally. ”
“Of course,” Steve agrees.
“So, this is a robbery?” she asks.
“We’ve had a few incidents of highway robbery, but nothing serious,” Sam tells him. “Mostly opportunists, I think, after the rich folk. We’re unlikely to be bothered.” Steve tells himself that the pang in his chest is not regret.
Steve wants to growl that he knows how to deal with this. He’s been asthmatic his whole life. This isn't even a proper attack, won't be if he gets his inhaler. But he needs the air for breathing more than for shouting at superheroes.
Then they are moving. The force as they accelerate upwards, through the hole Iron Man had blasted in the ceiling, makes Steve wrap his arms around the chest of the armour convulsively.
“Would you like some company?”
“Of course you would not be so inconstant, Captain,” Penelope says, looking across to Steve through lowered eyelashes. “I cannot believe you would ever jilt someone you professed to care about.”
“Good company has a tendency to do that,” Sir Anthony says, giving him a small smile.
Steve’s mind runs blank.
As he finds his way out again, unsettled and uneasy in his skin, there are quick, uneven footsteps behind him.
“Though I do not doubt your ability to deal with one were they to appear, I believe you may be disappointed by the reality of the event. I fear that highwaymen aren't so romantic as you believe.”
Steve, for lack of anything to say, crosses over to the window to look out, letting the conversation pass him by. Sam is far better at this sort of small talk than he is. It always seems to Steve that his words are either too heavy with meaning - half of which he did not intend - or lack any meaning at all. There must be some middle ground, but it seems Steve can never find it.
“No. It was quick,” he says, because honesty won’t help him here. She nods, but looks unconvinced.
“Did you see anyone enter this room before me?” Steve asks. Sam starts and looks at him in puzzlement. “A man and a woman. Did they come in here?”
Sam’s parents receive Steve with all the hospitality of family, even though Steve can’t respond as effusively himself. He feels a little like he is constantly in the way as the family carries on around him. It is a pleasant atmosphere, but he cannot help disappearing to the library every so often, or for a turn around the grounds, just to clear his head.
He’s tried the ‘I’m lost’ routine. That hadn’t got him anywhere. He’s told them that people are waiting for him. They seem undeterred. In fact, all that talking had earned him was a punch to the face.
He will go again tomorrow.
“Want me to get rid of him, boss?” the man asks.
It feels like another lifetime, but Steve has won his fortune.
“Nothing of consequence, but you had the look of someone who was about to be eaten by lions and Tony thought you might wish to be rescued, so I set myself the task of being your gallant knight.” Steve chuckles and Ms Van Dyne smiles sunnily at him.
Steve frowns. He would not have thought that coming up with a name would be the most difficult part of this.
“They didn’t give it up easily,” Steve says.
He takes his findings back with him to the house to go through them, sitting at the desk in the hidden room well into the early hours of the morning, reading through letters. There is nothing suspicious and none of the items he has taken seems to be anything more than trinkets or practical travel items.
So much so that he has to shake himself back to his senses before he can speak.
“It’s been a while since my horse has had a decent run,” Steve says, though he knows they are not lying about that. He and Sam have been forced to relocate several times over recent weeks because of militia activity, and he was almost caught by a patrol three days ago. “However, it’d be better if we kept this polite. Throw your bags to the side of the road, and we can all go about our day.” The man makes a face and Steve knows he’s considering the situation.
“Tony! You’ve been working like a dog all day. I’ve-” he comes into view, turning at the bottom of the stairs and freezes, looking between Steve and Sir Anthony.
“You always seem to cut through to the heart of the matter, Captain Rogers,” Sir Anthony says. “How is it that you read my mind better than I do myself? Am I so much an open book to you? Have you read me from cover to cover?”
He cocks his pistol.
“Oh wow,” the mechanical voice of Iron Man says. “I was not expecting that. For a walking history lesson, your tech is actually kind of impressive. Though… mine’s still bigger than yours.” Iron Man raises a hand and a flash of white appears, spearing through the air to throw the guard backwards. Steve looks around for the other one, the one he needs, bringing his t-shirt up over his nose in an attempt to keep the dust out, but wheezing anyway.
His hands have clenched into fists at his sides, his teeth are gritted together.
“Quite well, thank you, captain. It is good to see you. Sir Anthony is always the better for your company.” The way he says it indicates that Sir Anthony is definitely not the better right now and Mr Jarvis firmly believes he requires some improvement.
. He scrawls to Bucky and pins it to the fridge with a magnet. It’s their usual joke, but if something does go wrong - as unlikely as that is - at least Bucky will be looking for him.
He realises as he looks up that his steps - and maybe the memory as well - have led him along the streets towards Bucky’s home, where his mother and sisters still live. Steve freezes in place.
else,” Steve says, allowing himself a rueful smile. “I have been to places I enjoyed less. I did fight in a war, you know.”
“What makes you believe we were sent here by Stark?” she asks.
He punches the screen before he realises what he’s doing. Pain explodes in his hand - glass shatters and connections spark.
“Don’t mind them,” Ms Van Dyne says. “There is nothing they like better than to talk about things they know nothing about.”
“Actually, mother was very fond of diamonds,” Tony says lightly. Stane laughs heartily.
“I don't know the people in question,” Steve says, “but you are yourself just returned from town. How was the journey?” His attempt to change the subject is transparent and clumsy. To someone like Ms Van Dyne, who has been a part of society for years, it must be painful to witness, but she goes along with it without batting an eyelid.
Steve reads the first line and blinks in surprise. This is not a notebook of Howard’s, forgotten when he moved. This chest has been unopened for longer than that. The date at the top of the page is over a hundred years ago.
Steve turns at the sound of his name and looks up to see Sir Anthony approaching on horseback. “I was not expecting to see you out here… alone… drawing.” The baronet pulls his horse up and slides out of the saddle to land on the muddy ground. “You like to draw?”
“That’s not what-” Steve pauses. “Sir Anthony does not have any special regard for me.”
He hears the rattle of a carriage coming towards him, and it is like everything closes in at once. He misses the weight of his shield and his costume seems too vulnerable.
If he takes a certain pleasure in the tightness of Stane’s jaw or his grip on the glass, then he keeps it to himself.
“Nothing of consequence,” Steve says, pacing back and forth. Sam does not look convinced. “My enjoyment of drawing. His father… my opinion of him.”
Steve forces himself to release the masonry, relaxing his hands before he half turns to look at Sir Anthony’s face, which is watching him with concern. Sir Anthony looks as though he would call the whole party to a halt if it would make Steve feel better.
The days pass treacle-slow without the rhythms of army life to keep them regimented. His small rooms seem both smaller and larger than ever before, and he rattles around them. The dishes mount up in the basin without him having the will to clean them. Knowing he may never return to this place - or at least not for a long time - is the only thing that forces him to clean them in the end.
“It was back a hundred years ago,” she starts. “When magic was still viewed as the work of the devil and witches and sorcerers alike were hunted down. A young nobleman fell in love with a warlock who was in hiding, and he decided that he would support the cause of the persecuted magic users. So he set out to raid the carriages that transported witches to Brooklyn for their trials and executions. He waylaid them on the road, dressed all in black. But!” She pauses for effect, her eyes and hands wide open. “He was betrayed and they came for the warlock he loved in an attempt to capture him. He ran into the trap - although he knew what it was - and managed to save his lover, but he could not free himself. To save the life of his love, he gave his own, and it is rumoured that on moonlit nights sometimes you can see him - or hear his hoofbeats as he goes riding along the road, his spirit never at rest.”
“Not me, I’m exhausted,” Sam says. “I haven’t danced that much in years.” He looks at Steve curiously. “Are you sure you’re alright? You seemed out of sorts all evening.” Steve shrugs.
“May we see what evidence you have procured regarding Sir Anthony’s connection to the matter?” she asks.
“Something’s been hidden in the cover,” Steve says. He has to pull more of the end paper up to get at it properly, but it comes more easily than he would expect, as though it has not been well stuck down.
“The human condition, one might say,” Sir Anthony says. “We are born wanting.”
Steve still thinks it’s probably a joke, but that’s a lot of effort to go to for one joke. He’s had Scott try to trace the number, and there’s nothing. Same with the email address. Whoever this is, they’ve gone to a lot of effort, and if they’re serious, then Steve owes them the respect of taking them seriously.
“What does it say?” asks one of Sam’s nephews before Steve has even got it open. His mother shushes him, but that doesn’t stop the eyes of all the children from fixing on him.
But he has nowhere else to turn, and he is losing blood. That, combined with the exertions he has been putting on his body - the lack of sleep - and the effort his body is already putting into trying to heal, he feels drained.
Steve sleeps uneasily that night. He dreams of the cold and the screams again, but that is nothing new.
Sir Anthony seems startled to see two of them there, but pulls off his astonishment with as much aplomb as usual, bowing deeply and accepting the applause.
There are another two travellers that night and Steve hurries back under the cover of darkness, taking the secret passageway back up to the secret room.
“And damn the consequences,” Sir Anthony says, raising his eyebrows in mild question. The words the Nomad spoke to him. Does he know? Steve cannot tell. His actions indicate one thing, his words another, and Steve cannot decide which to trust.
Then, as quickly as it started, they’re twisting and almost floating. He can feel gravity pulling him down, but it doesn’t seem to have any power over them and Steve opens his eyes to look around.
“Where’s Liberty?” Steve shakes his head. He has no idea. If she’s been taken by the militia then it’s only a short while before they turn up on his doorstep demanding answers. If she evaded them, then she’ll turn up sooner or later. If anything else has happened… He sighs. She is a good horse. A friend, practically, albeit one who isn’t particularly talkative. But if she has been taken, then he’s going to need a nice explanation for the militia when they get here.
The driver has a pistol.
“Then we are friends, Sir Anthony?” Steve holds out his hand and Sir Anthony looks at it for a second before reaching like he’s reaching for a viper that may strike at any moment.
“Do not tell me of my virtues, Captain Rogers. Please. Not today. I cannot hear them and know I am making a liar out of you.” There is something in his expression that stays Steve’s tongue. He doesn’t know what nonsense Sir Anthony has concocted in his mind about himself, but there is something there more honest than Sir Anthony often displays.
Steve tries to look innocent and Bucky gives a huge sigh, raising his hand to point right at Steve’s face.
“Thank you, Mr Jarvis,” Steve says with a nod and a small smile before descending.
Steve knows that Bucky would laugh at him, but there is no way anyone would see respectable Captain Rogers in the masked knave he has created and that is the point.
“I wouldn’t want to impose,” Steve says. He doesn’t know what he’s intending to do with himself. He will have to visit the families of his men. The idea turns his stomach stone cold, but staying with any of them – even the Barnes family, who have always welcomed him before – sounds like a torture he could not bear.
He rehearses what he is going to say as he rides over, though he does not know how to address what he said without making the whole matter worse. No matter what Sam might say, he knows Sir Anthony can have no thoughts of him romantically. He has a title and an independent fortune, He will be looking for a match of good family - nobility most likely - or good fortune. Both, probably. Perhaps he had thought of Steve for a dalliance, but no more than that. More than that is quite impossible.
“I don’t think damaging it is going to help,” Sam says, his voice light, but he has the kindness to not sound too amused by Steve’s display of temper.
“Sir Anthony,” he says, and Sir Anthony spins around in the doorway. “The song you played before, when I overheard you from the garden. What was that?”
“I assure you they do,” Steve says, cocking the second. “Just because something’s old, don’t make it obsolete.”
“Just coming to see if you are alright. I know this must be hard on you, since the accident, but I see you have company.” Stane gives the pair of them an amused look, his eyes finding the way Steve’s fingers are smoothing his coat down and checking his buttons. There is nothing said, but Steve feels exposed and ridiculed, like when he was small and other people would look at him with disdain, refusing to take him seriously. He straightens his back.
The music room door opens, allowing Sam in to break up the moment. Steve feels the air rush back to him. The world opens up again. He releases the sketches, stepping back smartly as Tony pulls them towards himself.
“Thank you, Mr Jarvis, but my business is quite urgent and it should not take very long. Perhaps you may show me to him?”
“I am afraid I must get some air,” he tells his current partner, and slips through the crowd to the balcony doors.
Perhaps they’ll just make him disappear.
Steve can feel the blush rising at the undercurrent of her words. If Bucky could see him now, he would be in fits of laughter at the very idea of this moment. Wherever he is now, he’s probably laughing anyway, not even knowing why.
It all goes much as usual then, as they empty the coach.
“If they haven't already.”
“What sort of things?” he asks. He knows – thinks he knows – that Captain Wilson cannot know who it is he has on board his ship. No one associates Captain Steve Rogers of the 18th Regiment of Foot with The Captain of the Howling Infantry.
The flurry of activity has been enough to keep Steve’s mind busy, pushing most other concerns out of it, but lingering at the back of his consciousness is a niggling memory of the conversation he overheard at the inn.
“Yes, you shall smile through gritted teeth and try to bear it,” Sir Anthony says in a sorrowful tone, shaking his head in mock despair. “If you feel you are being overwhelmed give me a signal and I shall rescue you.”
“It’s your money, Captain Rogers,” Mr Murdock says. “The total amount is a not inconsiderable sum. You have been handsomely rewarded by your regiment on a number of occasions. You’ve become quite a rich man.” Steve stiffens in his seat. He is struck by a sudden wish that he had never come here, because now he must ask the obvious question.
This is not a battle. This is not an enemy city they are besieging. Hydra does not lurk behind these walls, just people he has known all his life. People he has failed.
Everything stops. Sir Anthony’s head jerks around, his back straightening immediately, and his hands freeze on the piano keys.
“You’re a madman,” he says. Steve grins. His blood is thrumming through his veins and he can feel the rush of the chase inside him.
“My current clothing suits its purpose tolerably well,” Steve says, though his resolve is wavering.
It is not Steve Rogers who stands there, not is it The Captain; it is a stranger, a mysterious masked man.
He will not have them slip through his fingers so easily again, but he has no time to do much, he has to focus.
But what comfort will they find in seeing him, when he came back and Bucky never would? Will he be any help at all to them, or will he just be salt in a fresh wound?
“Ah yes, we must always have reason to our actions. We can never simply do something just ‘because’. What freedom that would be, to wander in whatever direction we should choose.”
“Patience, my friend,” Sam says.
“Now that was rude,” Iron Man says, although his voice doesn’t sound right anymore. It sounds less machine and more man. He raises his hand and the blast of white light hits the final gunman in the chest, sending him flying back into the wall, where his head hits metal and he slides down to the ground. Iron man turns around and-
It wasn’t meant to be a conspiracy blog. He titled it Punching Upwards, because that’s what he wanted it to do, and it had started out as him shouting into the void.
“A-” Tony catches sight of Steve and his words falter. “Oh, you must be kidding me! A highwayman? In this day and age? And what even are those pistols? Those are antiques! Do they even fire?”
“Were you not sketching when I came in? I thought for certain that must be what you hid with such haste.”
“I have always been of the opinion that the rules are there to protect and support us all,” Steve tells him. “But there is a difference between what is legal and what is right.” The words are scandalous, but they are still far away from what Steve wants to say. It is the truth, and possibly closer to the truth than he should be straying, but he cannot hold his tongue completely. He wants Sir Anthony to know he understands.
Steve could not say why, but it feels as though entering the house would break some sort of spell, or a confidence maybe. The music feels like a secret that Steve has been fortunate enough to overhear, and he does not want to shatter the peace that seems to settle over him at the sound of it.
“It seems I’ve outstayed my welcome,” Steve says, stepping back. He grabs a small case with a lock on it that seems like it might contain papers - or at least something valuable - and eyes Liberty. Tony’s friends are between him and her, Time for a quick getaway.
“If I’d known you were intending to visit I would have made sure to be-”
Sam stands back on his heels, crossing his arms over his chest, and looking down at the bag as though it is hexed.
“Have you any information you wish to share with us?” Sam asks, leaning back in his chair. Mrs Romanoff looks surprised at the question. “I mean, you’ve been here longer than us, and we’ve been accommodating. But you have come into our house and so far I have seen no sign that this relationship is to work in both directions.”
“Brooklyn,” Sam confirms, he turns to shout an order to his crew, then turns back. “Welcome home, Steve.”
“I’ve always thought that Tony inherited his amiable nature from his mother,” Colonel Rhodes says. “The Lady Maria was a most gracious woman. Always a delight to talk to.”
“True breeding and education shine like diamonds, don’t you agree, Tony,” Stane says, turning to Tony to hand him a glass.
Dr Arnim Zola.
“Now it is decided and we are definitely friends,” Steve says, “I hope you will take me up on my offer of coming by to see my sketches.”
The night goes smoothly, Sam meshes into his plans cleanly and with little fuss. It is as though they have been working together for years. There are no large carriages or parties that night, just a few lone travellers. Steve takes their cases and thanks them before bidding them farewell. None of their voices are recognisable to them.
“I like it,” the words come from behind him and Steve stiffens at the voice.
The talk in the village is all of the upcoming ball. Half of the county is invited, it seems, and anyone who is anyone will be there.
“That was one my mother used to play,” he says. “It was one of her favourites. She said…” he looks at the fingers of his right hand, where they clutch his riding gloves. “That was the song she played at the cotillion when she and my father first met.” He pauses and then looks up, right into Steve’s eyes.
challenge the might of Hydra?”
“I fear I will not be much better,” Sir Anthony says. “My drawings tend to involve more mechanicals than pastorals.” He gestures around at the diagrams that surround them.
Steve feels caught, like a butterfly in a collector’s case. He is staring at Tony’s eyes and Tony is looking back. For the first time since he returned from the front, he feels seen, but he is not afraid of it. The sketches hang between them, caught, Steve holding one side, Tony the other.
“An Essay on Thaumaturgy,” Sam reads from the leather cover. “That’s… not what I expected.” They look at each other and Steve flips the cover over, but there is nothing more than the expected frontispiece with its elegant letters announcing the title and author and its publication date, several decades ago. Steve rifles through the pages, but there’s nothing to be seen there, no secret code marks on its pages, nothing more than a dull treatise on magic. He believes he has a copy within the collection in the library himself.
“My thanks, Captain. You are very generous.”
But a criminal, a gentleman thief, a highwayman? They could do it and no one would be any the wiser. He could search out the conspirators without alerting them and find real information for Lod Fury. He could be useful again.
“Only that the man has been watching you all evening. I believe he has designs upon your virtue.”
“Very well,” Steve says. “But within reason.”
In fact, Sir Anthony seems to have taken it upon himself to be invaluable in every way. He has determined that he must become Steve’s guide to Marvel society. Steve had not been aware that so small a village would have so many intricate relationships to negotiate. Sir Anthony is aware of them all, and takes pains to be present when the notables of the area come to introduce themselves. Steve still is uncertain how much of what the baronet says is intended to be a joke at Steve’s own expense, and how much is honest, but his presence in Lakefield is a breath of fresh air, and Steve seldom has time to dwell on his own thoughts with Sir Anthony around to chase them away.
“Dr Arnim Zola is dead,” Steve says. Three more screens flicker to life, each with the same image of Zola’s face, moving in time with each other. It’s like the creepiest hall of mirrors he’s ever been in, except it’s not his face looking back.
Steve does not know what to do. He has the information he was looking for, and yet… he cannot be grateful he found it.
The music room is bright and airy. It is probably Steve’s favourite room in the house with its broad windows and light colour scheme. But it feels empty so much of the time. He has had the piano tuned, although there is no one to play it. Bucky’s sister Becca had sometimes played, although she played every piece with the militant air of a five day march.
Emergency lockdown.
“I don’t need a gun to shoot you, Mr Highwayman,” the man says. His voice sounds a little different though, a touch more refined than it had before, not very much, but as though the rough edges had been knocked off. “Turn around and hold your hands out to your sides.”
“I’d apologise,” Steve says. “But my ma always told me that an insincere apology was worse than saying nothing at all. And I feel like disappointing you is probably something to be proud of.”
“It could still be Stark,” Sam comments and Steve heaves a weary sigh. “I don’t know much about his past, but I know he got in trouble in his youth. It might be that he’s being blackmailed with evidence of an indiscretion.”
“It is not from my sweetheart,” Steve says. “I don’t have a sweetheart.” He carefully avoids Sam’s cousin’s eyes again. “I expect it is a matter of business.” He does not say that he has little business that could require a letter to be sent to him. His only business is soldiering and that is all done for the time being, or so he hopes.
“My sketches, Sir Anthony,” Steve says, extending his hand. “I hope they meet with your approval.”
“Steve!” he hears Iron Man shout. “What are you-?”
“We’d be delighted,” Sam says before Steve can step in.
“One day, Captain Rogers, I will uncover you.” The promise is firm and soft, almost a verbal caress, but at the same time it makes Steve’s blood run cold. “But for today, I shall let you have your secrets. Lead on.”
Barton nods once, his eyes narrowed, and Steve takes that as farewell, before darting off past the stable and into the woods where Liberty stands waiting for him.
“My thanks, Ms Van Dyne,” he says. “Your rescue is appreciated. I fear I'm not suited to such gatherings.” He scratches at the back of his head. “And my appreciation of bridge is…”
Steve remembers the look on Bucky’s face as they both realised he was falling and that Steve was not going to catch him. He remembers the scream. He will never forget Bucky’s scream.
“You should return to the party,” Steve says. “Your guests will be missing you.”
“You’re welcome,” Barton calls back. “Next time you might not be so lucky.”
“Are you up? You have nearly missed breakfast and I thought you might want to join me for a walk over to the village. I told Mr Lawrence last night that I would look at his hunting bird. He has promised that it is the finest raptor I’ll have ever seen. I know that can’t be true, of course, Red Wing, my falcon back home, is the finest, but I'll allow that it may be the second finest.”
He sends a letter to a man he met a couple of times during the war - Lord Fury, the crown’s spy master - but all he receives back is a letter thanking him for the information and requesting that he stay out of it.
Mr Jarvis leads him through the house again to a door that is plain compared to the other moulded doorways in this place. As he opens it, Steve sees that it opens to a narrow staircase that leads downwards.
“Of course,” Sam agrees, looking at Steve, who attempts to look unaffected. “And the interruption is welcome, I’m sure. I have been trying to convince my friend here to be more in society. Good company will be good for him.”
Iron Man is between him and the door, a shield of red and gold. There is a flash of blue and Steve hears Iron Man grunt with effort.
Steve gives him a hard look and Sam just shrugs.
“Hey, Steve Rogers,” Iron Man says. In any other circumstances, Steve would be tripping over himself because
, he adds internally. The military base is
The blow came from behind. On any other man, it probably would have knocked him into the carriage and probably unconscious, too. Steve, however, barely rocked on his feet.
“You deserve this,” Sam says. He cuts right to the quick of the matter, as is his way. That is the core of it, isn’t it? How can Steve be rewarded with this when he failed to bring anybody back with him? He feels like he has cheated them all somehow and stolen what should have been theirs. “Maybe this is the universe’s way of trying to apologise. You don’t speak of what happened to you. I respect that, although maybe you should. But whatever it was, you still get to be happy. Good things can still happen to you and you don’t have to reject them. Whoever you lost, if you meant as much to them as they meant to you, they wouldn’t want you to punish yourself.”
“You’re
The lights turn red. An alarm blares.
“Steve,” Sam says, glancing up. “Late up again. Half the morning gone. This is not like you.”
“Well, I might have… jumped,” Steve allows. He can practically see Bucky’s face in his mind as he grins, this moment like so many times he had come home with scraped knees and bruises, bleeding, to find Bucky’s shoulders sagging and his face full of resignation.
“Oh, right. Yes,” Steve agrees.
“Captain Rogers,” he says with an incline of his head.
Tony is watching him carefully, not speaking. His look cuts to the bone, but it’s soft in a strange, uncanny sort of way.
His eyesight is also much improved by Erskine’s miraculous serum. His dark vision is that much sharper than the average human. He cannot truly see in the dark, but in dim light, he has a better chance than most men. As the two start to gallop by him, he can see the man clutching a bag to him, clearly more concerned with that than anything else, and Steve takes the chance.
“They’re very accurate. There’s not much room for artistic sensibilities in engineering.”
“Thanks, Obie,” Sir Anthony says, taking the glass.
“I know.” Steve frowns at his ale, his teeth grinding together. “If only I’d seen their faces.” He looks around at the other patrons again, but they all seem far too calm for people engaged in treason. But that’s how you would want to seem, wasn’t it? “They might not even have come in here,” he says. “The creak might have been a window, not a door. But we can’t just ignore it.”
“Any member of the household,” Mrs Romanoff says. “He keeps the door locked, but it would be no great difficulty to pick it. And most of his trusted confidantes have access to his workshop whenever they wish. Although those people rarely change.”
Sir Anthony does not only provide much guidance on what to look for in a phaeton, but also manages to persuade the dealer to decrease the price quite considerably for Steve. He proves invaluable, obtaining both carriage and the two horses to pull it for far less than Steve would have paid had he been alone. Of course, Steve probably wouldn’t have purchased any of them on his own, but he cannot deny that having a carriage will most likely prove useful.
s captain says to him. Steve had not registered the footsteps coming up. He turns to give Captain Wilson a tight smile. The man is good-natured and has been very welcoming, although he has no idea who Steve really is. It’s better that way. Steve has no desire to hear himself congratulated or praised. Not today, not ever. He has already overheard enough from the airmen without announcing his identity to them. They do not need to know that the army captain they are returning to home shores is the same one that they salute with their rum rations in the evenings.
“My favourite kind of question,” Tony replies. He spreads his hands wide, a grin on his face. “Ask whatever you want, Captain Rogers. I am an open book to you.”
“No one has said anything,” Steve says carefully. “I merely… I find I am not in the mood for such a gathering.”
“And what was a humble soldier doing with all these wealthy men?” Sir Anthony asks, his eyebrows rising in amusement.
“You’d think no one had ever got a letter before,” Old Mrs Wilson says. “Leave the Captain alone.”
“Ah,” Sam says, as though that explains everything. Steve looks at him in question. “It’s just every time the two of you talk you end up confused, angry, or like someone shot your horse.”
As it floods into him, the door opens and another five guards spill into the room.
“Not much of a view on a night like tonight, Captain Rogers,” the voice of
“You found Liberty?” he asks.
They are both good dancers, their steps light and keen to the rhythm. They make it seem as though they are skipping on air.
“What we do about it,” Sir Anthony echoes. And he looks away. The loss of eye contact feels like a splash of ice water to the face and Steve blinks, realising how dry his eyes are, how the rest of the room had faded into darkness around Sir Anthony’s face. “Yes,” Sir Anthony agrees. He takes a deliberate step back, away from Steve. Steve wants to follow him, but he restrains himself, grabs his hands together behind his back to keep from reaching out. “To act on our desires, that is where the problems start.”
He waits two more days before he sends word to Captain Wilson - Sam - that he will take him up on his offer. There is nothing left in Brooklyn for him but the savage chill of memories.
"If Fury has magic users, do you think he'd waste them in this place?" The other voice scoffs, then there’s the creak of a door and the voices fade away.
“Yes,” Captain Wilson agrees. “They’re going to fully outfit her as well.” He pats the wood affectionately and rubs his fingers along it, like the ship is a favourite pet. “Apparently some genius has come up with new armour and there are rumours of new weaponry and even a new propulsion system. Don’t know if I’ll recognise her the next time I see her.” He smiles across at Steve. “But with the war over, I’ve got time to spend with my family, and with the prize money I’ve won, I’ve got some money to spend as well.” He pauses and assesses Steve thoughtfully. “You’re welcome to stay with us, if you want. Usually my first mate, Riley comes with me.” Captain Wilson nods over his shoulder to the man standing at the helm with 1st Lieutenant’s bars on his epaulets. “But he’s been promoted to Captain. He’s getting a ship of his own, and being sent to the other side of the world to hunt pirates for his troubles. So I find myself without company while he gets all the adventure.”
A few times, when Sam is dancing near him, he sees his friend smothering a laugh at Steve’s faltering conversation and attempts to side step flirtation, and he’s reminded of Bucky’s despair over ever finding him a dance partner. Bucky would be just as amused to see Steve now, he knows, at last able to get a dance, but still as terrible as he has ever been at any conversation that does not end in a fight.
“I shall forgive you if you dance with me,” she says, holding out her hand. “Hank never does.”
It is a piece of paper, far larger than the book it was concealed in, and folded up neatly.
“Captain Rogers,” Mr Stane says. His smile is slow and his lips dark, like blood welling up from a wound. “We were not expecting you.”
He does not mount Liberty until he has left the grounds, he does not want the hoofbeats to draw attention.
“I told you - anything to avoid the honourable Miss Throckmorton,” Sam says, his ready grin steady as a rock.
“Then I fear we must have your eyesight examined, my friend,” Sam says, patting Steve’s shoulder with a good deal more gentle camaraderie than is evident in his words. “If you could not see in Sir Anthony’s eyes the high regard he has for you, then you must be blind.”
“Perhaps it has been edited in some way,” Sam suggests. “Hydra were quite clever in their cryptography from what I recall.”
“I would indeed,” the red head says, giving the other man - her husband - a hard look before turning to Steve.
“It must have slipped his mind,” Steve says. “I have a few sketches of him that I drew, back at the house. If you wish to see them-”
The anticipation does nothing but prolong his discomfort. He paces the room, examines the books on the shelves and hears all the while the slow incessant ticking of the elegant clock on the mantelpiece.
“You deny it? I have the proof of it,” Steve says.
He reaches out to unfasten the flap of the bag and slowly lifts it, carefully splaying the bag open with a finger and thumb.
“Barton could be one of his.”
Steve does not bother to reply, merely raises an eyebrow.
Or try, at least. That’s not going to be easy, though. He’s got contingencies set up. He’s got plans. He just never thought he’d need them.
“And what did you wish to convey?” Sir Anthony asks. He sounds stilted still, like they are speaking a language he does not know very well.
“I have…” Tony pauses. “The manor is well equipped with pianos. I have no need of it. And we cannot deprive your future spouse. I’m sure they will be a person of great accomplishments.”
“You look very well for a man I shot,” Barton says, his voice conversational. His arms hold the bow string taut, not a quaver in them. Steve does not doubt that were he to loose the arrow it would fly true. And he is not sure how well even he could take an arrow to the heart. Wanda, alas, is too far away to help him now.
“I knew this would happen,” she says to the man.
Steve hurries to return to the taproom, looking around frantically for anyone suspicious or anyone who seems alarmed by his sudden appearance. No one seems out of place. The room is full of people. There’s no way to distinguish which were the ones he heard talking. If they are even in here. The door he heard open might have led to any part of the inn, or even the stables.
“What’s the hold up, Barton?” A familiar voice calls and just as familiar a head sticks out of the carriage door.
He discusses events with Sam over breakfast, ensuring the servants are out of earshot first. Sam has no better ideas than him.
Perhaps Steve is the first one to read these pages since they were written.
“So you approve of me?” Steve asks, the words coming unbidden from his mouth. It’s a question he should not ask. It is too direct and far from polite.
“I mean,” Steve pauses, looking around at the ancient technology and the crackly image of Zola’s smug face. “I live in New York. Last week there were radio-controlled flower monsters trying to eat me. After that, a man in a computer just seems… sort of ordinary. You’re not even HD.”
The door to the parlour creaks open with a weary sigh and Steve steps through.
Perhaps it is not an answer, but an entirely new puzzle to be untangled, Steve thinks with an aggrieved sigh as he finds his way back to his bed.
“I’m not used to the luxury either,” he says. “These beds, they’re too soft. Sometimes I’m worried I’ll sink right into it and it’ll close up behind me.”
“Love? Sam, be serious.”
Sir Anthony blinks at him and opens his mouth, then closes it again.
He looks around the room, to the door he came in by and the narrow door on the other side that he knows, from his reading, leads to a passage down to the stables.
“Not like you’re here to help,” Steve mutters to the air. There is no response.
Sam is waiting in the hallway and turns to see Steve come down the stairs, grinning as he takes in the picture.
Steve manages not to stumble as he looks over to where Sir Anthony is dancing. He's not looking their way and gives no indication that he is aware that they are even there.
,” Bucky says. “
“You look almost dangerous, Captain Rogers,” Sir Anthony says. His voice is rough as well and Steve should step away, go back to the polite distance.
“No, it’s doing its job,” Steve says. It is, he can feel it. If he’d had a chance to just sit and breathe, he’d probably be okay by now.
“I can’t say I have,” Steve says firmly. “Sir Anthony seems to me entirely his own person. But I did not know the Lady Maria. If she is responsible for even half of what Sir Anthony is today, then she must have been a highly remarkable woman and I'm sad not to have made her acquaintance.”
“Which is exactly why we shouldn’t be talking about this. Not here.”
Steve’s never seen the suit this close before, well, not for more than a few seconds at a time. He’s drawn it, though. Doodles at the side of his notebook, the occasional bigger sketch. The lines of it are fascinating. The way it moves is… Steve’s attention is dragged away from Iron Man by new noises: voices shouting, the stomp of running boots. It’s muffled, but definitely there. More guards are on their way.
“I’m sure the captains are not scared by a little ghost story,” she protests. Steve shakes his head.
“The horses were nothing compared to Du-” Steve cuts himself off. Dum-Dum’s snoring had been legendary. Fit to wake the dead. “Horses aren’t so bad. They’re warm at least.” he says. Sam nods.
Steve glares at him.
But the fact remains that they will be talking.
“I hardly think-” Mr Stane begins, but Mr Jarvis cuts him off.
“Why would I change my profession when my current occupation leads me to meet such wonderful people?” Steve asks. He can hear the other man recovering, clearly preparing to rush Steve from behind. The woman is brandishing a long, thin knife. It is time for Steve to cut his losses.
“You disappoint me, Mr Rogers,” Dr Zola says. He actually sounds disappointed, like he has some semblance of human feelings still - or at least the ability to mimic them. Steve thinks Zola must be mad. If he wasn’t before he made the transfer, he must be now. It doesn’t seem like a situation anyone would be able to cope with.
Steve checks the contents of his rucksack. Wirecutters, flashlight, pepper spray, inhaler, snacks, and the research on the few scraps of information he has: Camp Lehigh and Dr Arnim Zola. He’s got a camera on his phone, obviously, and his keys are in his pocket. Bucky didn’t take the rust bucket that they like to pretend is a car. He’s all set.
He stares at the words, willing the swoop of the upstrokes to change, but it remains, stubbornly, Sir Anthony’s handwriting.
Steve turns and sees the groom waiting at the bottom of the steps with Liberty. He thanks the man and mounts.
