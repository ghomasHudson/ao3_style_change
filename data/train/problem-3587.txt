A part of Dean wanted Cas to stand closer. Another part of him wanted Cas to stand far, far away. He couldn’t make sense of the conflict within him, so Dean stepped deeper into the kitchen, using the excuse to put some space between him and Cas.
Sam sticks him in the side with the demon knife, and although it isn’t enough to kill Alistair, it gives Dean the space he needs to flee.
Dean pulls him in cheek to cheek, this time, arms flexing like iron bands around Castiel. He cradles Cas’ head and kisses his hair, cursing even as relief shakes its way through him, sapping all the strength from his bones.
Dean’s the one to break the silence, clearing his throat with another wince. “You the one they sent to…?”
Dean cranes his neck over his shoulder and is slapped in the face by the sight of Sam and Cas approaching,
“Speaking of,” Dean says, “how long do we got? If she was taken before noon and the wipe happens after five hours, then—”
With Bobby and Ellen, Ash and Jo and Pamela all gathered, Castiel and his chorus summon the new version of heaven around them, weaving a world advised by what all its inhabitants wish for it to be.
Dean chuckles. “Yeah. I wouldn’t mind picking up a few tricks either.”
The transition into becoming legacy’s analyst has gone more smoothly than expected, considering the disastrous exit he experienced at his last job. Castiel couldn’t handle another miserable position on his long string of botched employment, but SA work is straightforward enough: look at a problem and ensure the correct answer is obtained for the developers to continue their work. But Raphael never said during his interview that he would have so much
retreat. You ought to be with your
So maybe there was something to talking to Castiel on a regular basis. Something that actually helps make the day to day better, not just for Dean but for legacy as a whole.
Dean laughs, shaking his head. “Can probably relate to what I’m going through, with all the questions you get asked by patients.”
“What happened to you,” Michael intones, frowning. “You reek of—”
“Still. A heat shouldn’t be about suffering.”
A breath huffs out on the other side of the room, cutting the tension by half. “Good. That’s good, right?”
“Yeah, about that.” Sam pushes aside the meal tray, making room for his laptop to turn around.
Dean’s lungs clamp closed, his ribs knee-jerk squeezing until he’s in sudden, palpable pain.
Dean locates his switchblade before he goes, laying open on a nearby shelf, and grabs it more slowly than he did his phone. He plucks it up almost mechanically, distantly noting the dried blood flaking along its edge.
As it is, Dean collects Anael on his way toward the elevator, the pair of them exiting the legacy floor together. Upward button pressed, Dean spares one last glance toward Castiel’s office, seeking comfort, but his office is disappointingly empty, the way it’s been all morning.
—he might have an aneurysm.
Things like: where the fight will likely start. Where to retreat. Which halls are easy chokeholds, and which are dead-ends from which they won’t escape.
Jack steps aside, and in an instant Castiel has fled from heaven, carried by wings of despair.
“But you found the cemetery,” Sam added, so hastily Dean rolled his eyes.
It takes a short eternity to locate the Roadhouse occupied by Ellen Harvelle and her pack of miscreants, the few hunters she cared for from her time on Earth gathered within the rundown tavern’s walls. Ash has done an excellent job warding them from Heaven’s eyes, but Castiel knows what he is looking for.
“Your rut,” Dean finished flatly. “Yeah. I can smell it.”
Dean hums, noncommittal. Icing hangs from the corners of his mouth, twitching as he eats the cake without a hint of joy.
after work becomes a thing that they do together. Dinner just becomes a side effect of those circumstances, since they’re the only two regularly pulling overtime on the legacy floor, and neither of them want to eat at home alone when it comes time to actually part.
With their blessings, Dean RSVPs as attending the team building day celebrating BEAU’s end.
“I won’t,” Dean assures him. “So let’s forget the tie. Okay? We’re gonna be late.”
His face flushes with the indignity of it. No fucking way would Dean do this to anybody, regardless of whether he called them kin.
They take turns reviewing the footage, but it’s as if the area around the school doesn’t even register properly, either on the screen or in their heads. Dean scrutinizes every second of the video, but it only gives him rapidly-building eyestrain and the vague feeling of having lost time.
"So," Miriam begins, tapping her nails against Dean's desk.
The foyer is too noisy to hold a proper conversation, so Charlie suggests they go for coffee at a shop off-campus, and leads them down a hall towards a different exit. The crowd thins the further they wander from the heart of the campus. Castiel points out the math and engineering departments as they walk by, the buildings that house administration, where he works.
In the bunker, Castiel imagines Dean making breakfast. Dean cleaning his room; his car. Dean whistling in the shower and Dean watching old movies; Dean eating pizza as he idly browses the internet.
, trying desperately to show that he was ready. That there was no need for them to wait any longer.
The blonde nods definitively. “Card-birthday. Like candles. And tablecloths. And if you have any of that annoying canned silly string in green or pink. Ooh, and sprinkles.”
“Dean’s right. It’s not a cash bonus. They’re planning a skill building event for us instead.” Castiel clicks at his laptop, then rotates the computer around so Dean and Miriam can see it.
Dean’s neck isn’t broken, thank god, but when his headache doesn’t clear after an hour they send him off to CTs, just to assess what kind of soup Dean’s made of his brain. His hearing clears up the longer he remains laying down on the gurney, although his balance is still staggered and his vision remains a little wobbly. All in all it’s part and parcel for a rough concussion, but then again, Dean expected much worse considering the severity of the hit.
“Could’ve,” Sam agrees.
"Hm." Dean hopes his disinterest is enough to throw Miriam off his scent. But considering the updates Castiel gave about on the BEAU project, Dean can put the puzzle pieces together well enough to know what’s coming next.
“Dude,” Dean insists. “You asked for it. After the hospital, back in Salt Lake City.”
The blonde’s phone buzzes, and she shuffles her hand free from the basket handle in order to fish her cell out from her pocket. Val catches a glimpse of a photo, some badly-burned baked goods flashing up on-screen.
They talk until Dean’s meal has grown cold and he has to shuttle away the leftovers into a plastic container, maybe to be eaten tomorrow, maybe to grow stale like everything else in the fridge. Dean asks how their hunt for a new apartment is going, and they ask him when he plans on having a social life again outside of work. Dean laughs, but it’s the kind of joke that hits too close to home, and makes for a sour note to end on, considering it’s not long after that they wave their goodbyes and hang up for the night.
A mouth brushes against Dean’s temple. Castiel hangs there, whispering straight into him, “Do you want me to make you some coffee?”
Well, if all goes well tonight, he might want to go out sometime on an actual date.
They never agreed that they should keep things strictly professional, but Dean doesn’t dare ask Castiel about it, not since so much time has passed since Cas basically said they’ll wait and see. But Dean’s noted the way Castiel keeps to himself lately, his office door closed, in the aftermath of being publicly lashed in front of half the team.
Castiel smiles almost shyly, gaze dropping to the one bouquet fresh enough for him to insist Dean bring it home with him. "I would like that."
“Dean,” Castiel says, gently. “I’m sure.”
“Maybe. It’s just...” Castiel’s mouth narrows into a tempting pink line, and Dean has to remind himself to concentrate. “We needed overtime to fix it, and not just within the legacy team.” Sighing, his head falls back roughly into the cushions, tipped onto the back of the couch. His expression sours. “Products and implementation will want to know why an emergency work order was logged. I’ll probably be pulled in front of the board to explain what went wrong.”
Dean frowned. He swatted at the tingle building on the back of his neck. “I’m sorry?”
Dean finds Jack in a corner of the library, trembling, his arms wrapped tightly around Kelly, sobbing into her son’s hair. Sam has likewise shied away from the crowd, celebrating alone with Eileen after she came right up to him and kissed him, breathless and giddy and alive.
He had to leave. It wasn’t safe. Except Cas was feeling sick and needed help…
Dean sighs heavily. “That’s what we want to know.”
They strip the sheets off the bed, relegate them to the floor with the rest of their clothes. Dean comes back from the bathroom with a washcloth in hand, passes it to Cas with a kiss pressed to his temple. Once they both are clean, they change into boxers Dean digs out from the dresser, and sleep beneath the stack of blankets let loose by the night.
In the half-dozen rings it took for Cas to answer, Dean almost preemptively ended the call. Waiting with hope was so much worse than just taking the hints Cas was dropping him. Dean had been ghosted—wasn’t that obvious? Why was he trying to resurrect a relationship that was already dead?
But Castiel has dawdled long enough on this reunion. He sheds his hiding place among the brush, stepping out into the light.
“I’ll have to warm you, won’t I?” Castiel murmurs into Dean’s hair, bowing over him. He has the audacity to flinch back when his body finally touches Dean’s bare skin. “You weren’t kidding.”
“Yes,” Bart agrees, “but Castiel emailed me last week, asking for a rundown of what all the legacy SA should take care of. I told him about the monthly production meeting, and I gave him the same queries I sent to you. Good thing too, wouldn’t you say?” he adds, winking at Dean.
Jack waves and greets Dean good morning, which Dean returns though he's distracted by how Cas has his shoulder slouched over, his arm wrapped around a brown bag that’s wrinkled at the top like a bottle neck.
“Yeah, uh. You too, Cas. It’s good to hear your voice.”
Dean doubts Castiel even knows enough about legacy to be advising on BEAU. It hardly feels like he’s been here more than a month, although he has. Regardless, it seems like Adler is more than happy to believe Castiel is handling legacy like an old pro, despite what practical efforts might have to say about that.
Realization dawning, Cas holds out his hand. Nodding, Dean finishes the sentiment by filling Cas’s palm with his own. “Something to the point, I guess. Except who’d want us to...?”
But then Maggie continues brightly, “I mean, between hunting and training, I haven’t really been out that way much. You’ve heard about those vamp nests spreading east, right? Sam says if I can get the skills down in time, I might be able to join the team taking them out in East Kentucky.”
Dean shakes his head. His fingers are numb, cold. “There’s gotta be something we can do. Some way we can keep you on legacy.”
Castiel shrugs his whole shoulder into the couch, seemingly resigned to accepting his fate. His movements are looser than usual, perhaps likewise affected by the wine. His brow is stormy and mournful in turns, the twist of the light changing his expression from potent to laid open and bare.
But Maggie has already slipped away with more grace and speed than Ryan recognizes, mouthing,
The two men are talking to a third person that he cannot see. Her presence is known only for the way her voice rings clearly above the murmured two, and how the two men keep looking at her when they aren’t exchanging looks with each other.
Dean needs no further encouragement. He rakes his teeth along the tendon straining in Castiel’s neck, scraping up through stubble. Castiel breathes hotly into the side of Dean’s head, mouth close to his ear, tickling the short hairs there.
“No, no.” Dean shakes his head. “I mean—shit, Cas, listen. I don’t want you to leave legacy... I like working with you.”
The cop with the ponytail perches an elbow on the coffee table, her smile seemingly ready for a good tale.
The sister checks her hip against the door, awakening its obnoxious chime, and as it rings out the boy’s voice carries through the din. “—Slim Jims and another coffee for Mister Pick-Me-Up back there.” He drifts from her in the chip aisle, while she carries on a bit farther for the drinks at the back. “How much longer did Sam and Jody say?”
“Jesus Christ,” Sam shouts, pulling his shirt closed over his chest, “my eyes!”
“No,” Jack agrees. “Not in the way that you’re thinking. But still—I ask this of you.”
“So what do they look like?” Dean murmurs, leaning close to Castiel’s ear. Potential freshmen flow around them, chatting, shoulders bumping as they walk.
“Oh.”
Dean guesses this is Castiel’s other coworker, judging by the goatee. “Dean,” he says, holding out his hand.
Conversation luxuriates around them, swirling through the room. Burgers are ordered by damn near everyone except a skinny guy who brought his own clamshell container, its contents indescribably red, and Donnie’s servers are kept busy busing tables for the next couple hours. Sam comes up to the bar for a pair of drinks and then sidles off to the side with Jody. A redheaded woman Donnie unfortunately recognizes appears for an order of red wine, grinning like a cat when Donnie keeps a cautious distance, his eyes peeled for any possible disruption Rowena might cast his way.
Dean stiffens, realization striking at the same time Cas archly says, “So I could have killed you and Dean, if I’d woken up earlier?”
“I will,” Castiel assures him.
She waits while Dean, groaning, pulls up his inbox to confirm what she’s saying. Sure enough, there’s a meeting invitation awaiting his response, sent out from the members of the central analysis board. The CAB consists of faces Dean seldom sees, much the way he prefers it: upper, upper management only met with underlings who fucked up in incredible, unprecedented ways.
“Thank you, Uriel,” Castiel says, smiling softly.
“Stick your hand up against one of those bullseyes, then,” she threatens. “Let me practice my aim.”
Dean moves in a slow circle, his hand fishing through the air. Despite the lack of breeze, his arm shakes like it’s being buffeted by a gale. Panic without a source builds within him, bile pushing up into the back of his throat. His heart thrums erratically in his chest.
“Because those aren’t a real happiness,” Anael says, clipped.
His toss soars through the air on an impressive arc, displaying an excellent combination of form and distance, the log sailing farther than any werewolf has managed so far.
“You’re telling me.” Pamela snorts, taking back her hand. “The way I see it, there’s gotta be a way for Heaven to guard us from shit like that getting carried away.”
“The third, actually,” Sam corrects.
As it is, Novak rounds the corner shortly after Dean’s made his way to his locker. Novak shoulders his way through the rest of the team, tosses his helmet aside for good measure. Dean keeps one brow raised, his gaze trained on Novak with feigned nonchalance. “Problem, Cas?”
Dean can’t think of that. Can’t think of how broken Charlie had become once she let love back into her heart. Can’t think of how Sam’s voice broke as he held Eileen’s dropped phone and said:
It cuts off the dream he’s been having, the one that had clung to him the whole way through his three-day bender, a favorite punishment he revisits again and again. That goddamn lie of a week leading up to Dean’s thwarted confession. Dean with his nerves singing wildly—circling in closer, standing there longer, daring to let his touch linger—and Cas…
,” Dean insists loudly, interjecting himself into their latest argument that he slow the fuck down.
“Maybe.” Wryly, Sam adds, “You know ‘em better than I do.”
“Deal.”
Cas doesn’t comment, merely waits out the shakes that course through Dean. In spite of his recent role as Dean’s punching bag, he’s still trying to help Dean through it. Never really stopped trying, even with the obstacles Dean tosses his way.
They both considered corn, but thought the shade from the mulberries would be too much for the stalks to gain any real height. Cas compromised by digging up the wild earth beyond the berry patch, picking rocks from the packed earth and dropping them into a rough pile. Dean dutifully dragged a hoe through the dirt, and Cas dropped corn seeds along it in two-inch gaps of earth.
Dean barks out a laugh. “You sonofabitch,” he says, when Castiel starts laughing as well.
As if on cue, a melodic chime goes off in Dean’s peripheral. Freshly-learned instincts have Dean looking to the app for a new message from Castiel, even as old muscle memory has him reaching for his ringing desk phone instead.
With tears in his eyes, Sam tosses the knife away.
“Dean.” Cas touches Dean’s neck, cups his cheek. Leans in to touch his brow to Dean’s. “For as long as you’ll have me. I’m here to stay.”
“Cas, is your bed just one giant pillow?”
Abbie probably looked out for her younger sister. Tried to make Libby’s life easier. She would’ve been there for every milestone, every knee scrape and heartache as they grew up together.
Castiel hummed, and the reverberation sent a spike of unwanted lust directly to Dean’s groin. “You said ‘no kissing’ on your profile,” Castiel replied, touching Dean’s hair.
Weighed down by tension, Dean gestures weakly at the stack of papers. “Any chance one of those has my name on it?”
“Dean,” Castiel says quietly, drowned out by the heroine screaming in the film.
“Don’t go dripping on the upholstery,” Dean mock-groused as he turned the ignition, throwing a wink Cas failed to catch.
“Seven,” Novak snaps, grabbing Dean’s shoulder and forcing him around. “A month out from playoffs and you’re still spending all your time in the box.”
With a couple deep, gathering breaths, Castiel manages to stand stiffly, and push his chair back into place beneath the table. Dean hovers close by Castiel’s side. He’s not sure what he expects to happen, but Cas feels—fragile. Breakable. Like the wrong look at him might scatter Castiel to the wind.
haven’t had a vision, I’ve done
Dean shrugs. “I mean, it depends when it’s happening.”
Next up is Cas, who seems puzzled as the staff walks the caber up to him. He leans down as he’d seen the other competitors do it, hefting up the log and angling it over one shoulder. But then Cas does something strange, lobbing the caber straight up into the air before deftly catching it back at an angle, the log arranged like a javelin in one hand.
The new heaven is exponentially more complicated than any prior attempt, but with the full host and Jack’s adjusted calculations, the space-time unfolds without a single glitch. Hundreds of people come into contact with each other, some for the first time.
And yet, now that Castiel was attempting the same, this time laying flat on a motel bed, his hands gently roaming his chest down to his navel, the mechanics of masturbation felt decidedly more complicated. The recipients of such touches typically showed some sign of appreciation, and yet all it was to Castiel was touching.
Dean might not be legacy’s official leader, but his efforts have made him the de facto system analyst, spanning the tenure of the last three SAs and then some.
Sam’s got his back shortly after, holding the remaining djinn in a standoff by the time Dean has their presumed leader pinned to the war room table, a scimitar blade pressed to her throat. Presumed, not only because of the intricate black markings tattooing her skin, but also for the regal manner in which she stares up at him.
,” Sam shouts, grabbing for the phone, clashing over Dean’s angry “
“Bart has changed legacy’s end date three times over email,” Castiel says bluntly, cutting off Dean. “When he couldn’t give me a straight answer why, I raised my concerns to Raphael, who advised that board approval for decommissioning legacy is still a long way out yet. As for BEAU,” he adds, growing heated, “that project has a shelf life of two months, maximum, before Miriam and Inias return to legacy. You’re not being phased out or replaced.”
A hand is on him in an instant, steadying his shoulder. The crook of an arm comes up behind his head, followed by the press of a cool glass against his shredded lips. “Easy, easy,” Sam murmurs, and Dean starts taking short sips of water, soothing the trapped, dusty feeling ravaging his lungs. Dean chokes a bit, rousing a whole new chorus of pain throughout his body.
The silence in the boardroom echoes endlessly, caught in the thrum of grace that composes Heaven itself.
Privately, Castiel wishes he doesn’t so wholeheartedly agree.
Dean shrugs with more bravado than he’s feeling. “I’ve just been making shit up as I go. Never expected to make it far in the NHL anyway. Should be glad I even got the chance to play.”
Benny looks somber at that, like Dean’s disappointed him by missing the point. But then Benny plucks up his drink and drains the glass, thumbing the rim in contemplation. “We’re here for you anyway, brother. Including Novak. When the other teams are chirping, we got your back. So stop picking fights and just play the game, alright?”
Fear and curiosity roiled up in Castiel as he thought again of his intentions. He was delaying the inevitable and he knew it. In response, he slid off his trench coat and folded it neatly over one arm, then again until it formed a bundle. He set that aside on the closed toilet lid, and removed his suit jacket in much the same manner.
Dean’s hands faltered. He had to put the bowl on the ground. Blood rushed to his head; Dean draped himself over his knees for a moment, gathering air.
Around the table, forks scrape against china. Cas asks, “Why don’t I remember any of this?”
The chorus shifts uncomfortably, already filled with doubt. Castiel recognizes that feeling; he knows how it eats through the insides of every creature, tempting it to give in without making an attempt.
The next morning at breakfast, no one can manage eye contact. Dean keeps tugging at his shirt collar, trying to cover up the worst of his hickeys, while Rowena looks radiantly satisfied as she cozies up next to Sam. Garth, impressively, seems to take no notice of the post-coital energies of the table, digging into his breakfast with all his usual vigor. Beneath the table, Cas rubs his thumb idly across the palm of Dean’s hand.
“I know,” Castiel says fondly. “I believe you. And you can say everything you need to say the next time we meet. If you still want to. Because we will, Dean. We
They locate Michael in the hallway, slumped over amid the carnage, wounded but otherwise alive. His eyes glitter wetly; Lucifer lies dead at his feet. He pats Jack’s hand and vows to join them in his own time.
Dean sits up straighter. “Say what?”
“I do want to stay,” Cas murmurs, “but I can’t promise you that I always will. My duties to heaven are—”
The djinn gives a tinkling laugh, light as the note from her glass. “Oh, Castiel. The Tree is not something that grows from a seed.” She leans across the table, her smile sharpening. Her blue palm comes to rest atop Cas’ hand. “It can only be replanted from dreams.”
Sam laughs. He asks a couple questions about Dean (“I’m right here!”) and then jumps into exchanging pleasantries, covering the usual small talk that comes up between strangers. Dean tolerates it for a couple minutes before he forcibly turns the laptop camera back onto himself. “You’re leaving me out,” he complains, his glare angled toward Sam and Castiel alike.
From where she and Cas sit in matching arm chairs, the djinn queen cranes her neck back until she has Dean’s attention snared. “You are welcome to join us, if it would soothe your sorrows,” she calls to him. One hand unfurls from her lap, her intricate tattoos eclipsed by the palm she flips upright.
“So.” Dean looks at his hands; the ground. “You stood me up.”
off what remains of the shirt stack, and pulls it over his head.
Cas puts up no fight when Dean flinches. He drops Dean’s hand with a sigh. “What good is it to love you if you won’t allow it when others are near?”
Castiel knocks on the cabin door to find Mary, snug in an oversized cardigan, alone for now. Taking some time away from John, now that their missing histories have been exchanged. She smiles with Castiel when she sees him, beaming as she tries to usher him inside.
Cas chuckled at him, breath catching.
Inias stares at him a while longer, brows furrowed, tilted upright with concern. “Um. There were a couple non-BEAU defects assigned to me by Castiel. I’m wondering if that’s a mistake, or if he’s trying to—”
“Easy enough,” Bart grins. He adds with a wink, “Can’t wait to beat you, Dean.”
“What?” Dean asks, sharp.
“So what were you up to anyway?” Miriam sinks back into one of Dean’s shitty office chairs and kicks her heels up onto his desk. Inias shuffles his chair over to relinquish more room to her sprawl.
“Yeah, but Jo’s a maniac.” Dean grins, imagining the over-the-top act Anael likely put on when Castiel broke the news to her. “Give her ten minutes and she’ll have it verified just fine. She knows these maintenance updates like the back of her hand.”
The saucepan is poured atop the pasta, and Castiel gives it a hearty stirring before he doles out a portion onto each plate. From a bowl offside, he grabs a handful of grated parmesan and sprinkles it on top of each dish, followed by a delicate portion of red pepper flakes. Satisfied, Castiel carries both plates over to the breakfast bar.
When they wrap up, Mary haltingly asks, “So what are you up to, are you still back at the bunker?”
And she brings back everyone.
Too soon, Dean’s pessimism is proven right.
“I’m gonna sleep on the couch,” Dean grumbles. In an afterthought, he grabs the
“Yeah—Yes.” The sight of that smile made Dean’s face flush even deeper, if possible. “And some other things,” he mumbled, and he was scared, so scared, that Cas would ask him
Sam shrugs. “Just let them be disappointed? I dunno. I’m just asking you to maybe readjust your standards a bit. Give yourself enough slack to have a life outside of the office.”
Mary runs her hand up the back of his neck, scrubbing his hair. Her thumb flicks the tip of his ear. Dean leans into as much as he will allow it. His mom might have trouble showing it sometimes, but she cares enough to come through for them in the end.
Dean nods, still chewing. “Vengeance, love, whatever. Toss a hex bag your ex’s way and see what happens.”
A stifled curse comes from Castiel’s end of the line, followed by further rustling and banging.
The crowd shouts back,
“Cut it out,” Dean demanded, as he ducked down beneath another table. It had been three days of slowly simmering tension, which had somehow culminated in shattered glass showering down from above.
Dean comes back to himself sometime during the cut on his forehead getting stitched closed, the pain enough to hone his attention down to a pinpoint sharpness. After that, the physician and her team start walking him through the standard concussion assessment. Dean is able to flex all his facial muscles; his hands pass the squeeze test, and his shoulders manage to hold the spot-pressure being applied.
Sighing, Dean digs out his phone and begins drafting a text to Max.
“Uh,” Doug says. “Sure.”
Castiel asks each of Ellen’s people to list every person they knew in life—as many of them as they could remember. On good terms or bad, close or distant relations; every name is needed, no matter how weak their acquaintanceship might be. He and the angels then gather up all the listed souls into a newly-crafted heaven, one scaled more massive than had ever been attempted before.
But it works: Jo finds herself in a modest lakefront cottage a half mile down from her mother, and spends her spare time in the Roadhouse much the same as she did before. When enough time passes that Ellen seems to irritate her, a lush fence of poplars and firs grows between the two abodes; Jo returns to her cottage and refuses to come out until she can finish sulking in peace.
“Dean?” Claire calls from the back bedroom. “Oh man, c’mere—you gotta see what Cas found.”
Sweat built between them, slicking their grip on each other. Castiel tightened his hold on Dean, fitting his hands around Dean’s waist. Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel in answer, his hand loosely curving around Castiel’s head, tucking his mouth down against Dean’s neck.
Val exhales deeply. “Extra bucks, definitely. I was working for the guys over at Ray’s farm for a while, but then the guys were, well,
“Never,” Cas intones, serious. “I took this ring so that you can live as long as you want, free from outside interference. I will make sure of it, Dean, for you and your brother. I swear.”
Pamela and Jo startle at his abrupt appearance, wary and ready for a fight, but Castiel holds up his hands in peace, asking plaintively, “I need your help.”
Dean shuts his eyes, wrenches his face aside. Skitters away from the chasm now yawning inside of him, shuddering open the instant Cas took hold of this thing between them, took it from the dark and held it, crying, out in the open air.
“You okay?” Dean says, quiet. Cas frowns, so Dean flicks his fingers up beside his own face, feigning scratching at his nose.
Recognition flickers in Castiel, pinching his brows. He holds Dean’s hands more tightly, fingers turning white. “No, that isn’t right. I wasn’t—”
“Whoa,” Max murmurs, eyeing Cas up as he shakes his hand. “You’ve got some juice to you, don’t you?”
Castiel shrugs, pushes himself upright. He winces at the familiar pain in his abdomen the motion brings.
Nodding, Patience adds, “The news stations didn’t say anything about it, but social media was flooded by speculation under the hashtag WhoTookAbbie. There wasn’t one uniform account of what happened, but most of the eyewitnesses said the abductor was extremely tall and had their whole face masked by a hood—except for these huge yellow eyes. They said Abbie calmly followed this figure out from the school, but after the five-hour mark the hashtag vanished as well.”
Castiel hums agreeably and rifles through the cubby’s supply of tea sachets. He seems to find what he’s looking for, retrieving a lone tea packet and tearing open its cover with his teeth. He then dunks the tea bag into his steaming mug and tosses the paper away.
It’s an ungodly hour by time Castiel falls asleep on the couch, and even then he gets so little sleep that when he wakes, he doubts he can keep his eyes open for the entire drive into work. Worse still, he also overslept, thanks to his now-dead phone failing to set its alarm off, its charger stranded in the bedroom.
To the soft space behind Dean’s ear, teeth dragging gently, the sensation trilling through Dean’s gut and upwards. Lightning strikes along his spine.
Dean nodded. He scraped his fork around, gathering sauce from the edges of his dish. Smacking his lips, he said, forced-casual, “You said you owed me an explanation.”
, me and this wildcat here have been—”
The heroine keeps screaming on the television.
Dean frowned, feeling as though he was taking even further advantage of Castiel’s good graces. “Don’t feel you gotta, Cas, not after I—”
“You guys figure out how this whole thing started? Why these things took the kids?”
Somebody even has the gall to start leaving care packages on his desk when he’s not there. He arrives in the morning to find cough drops and emergen-c stacked neatly atop his mousepad, and sometimes even a thermos filled with chicken soup appears with them, barely lukewarm by the time Dean deigns, hours later, to acknowledge the gifts being made.
Outside the car, the brothers are quietly arguing. Castiel cranes to listen, but he only picks out a partial phrase from Sam:
“Awesome.” Two sisters, both taken—maybe voluntarily—by the same thing. Dean shakes his head. “This creature on the footage, what is it? Can we find something like it online, or are its details erased too?”
“Yes,” Castiel replied. “That.”
Ah, Dean thinks. So that settles that.
“You stupid idiot,” Dean whispers. His dry lips brush Cas’ fevered skin.
Dean pushes his palms into his eyes until stars erupt. The admission, the
Was it worth putting himself through a conversation tonight? One that Dean knew would result in him never seeing Cas again?
Castiel’s expression scarcely shifts, save for a twitch at the corner of his mouth that wrinkles the corners of his eyes. Dean wouldn’t have caught the change if he weren’t watching for it. It’s… kind of cute, all things considered.
Christ almighty. His chest burned with a fresh dosage of shame.
It’s what Dean has been waiting for—just a moment of time where Castiel is focused solely on him. Dean’s grin widens. “Been a while since we needed to order in. What’s up?”
?” The boy scoffs. “That’s a joke, right?”
Muffled noises scratch the line, accompanied by a breathless gust that crackles the connection. “Dean! Did we move our current cycle to pre-production today?”
“I lied to myself, Dean. Every time.” Cas touches their brows together. Dean tightens his grip on Cas’ hips and Cas groans, low and gravel-rough. “Each time I go, I always want you more.”
He doesn’t say it because he can’t be sure, but Dean thought he caught a glimpse of Nick—of Lucifer—in the throng of fighters. And if he did… They don’t have long. It’s too much for Michael to hold back alone.
The door was unlocked, as promised. Dean nudged it open with his hip, surprised to find the lights dimmed in a living room immediately inside the door.
“Mm. Yeah, good point.” Dean sighs, staring at the shower. “Christ, the shower here has a bench seat in it. Who needs to sit while they’re—Oh, because there’s six shower heads.
—up tight against him.
Dean bites his cheeks. Stares down at his trembling hands, folding them together. Not now, not this. He can’t. The coal inside his heart flares within him, painful and bright.
The march back to the cabins passes in uncomfortable silence, the lot of them trying to walk as quickly as possible past the mess hall, evading the open stares coming from inside its doors. Rowena and Sam break out into a speed walk ahead, and Garth waits until the coast is clear before breaking character, a fit of loud, drunken giggles bursting out of him, bowing him in half.
Inside the bag are shoes, and a belt. A cell phone. Shirt, jacket, and a pair of slacks. A trench coat and tie Castiel has never seen before.
“Dean,” Castiel calls after him, but Dean just marches out the door.
Just another way Dean is poison to the people around him.
him, in any sense of the word.
Castiel nods, gaze trained low. It’s only with the change in light that Dean spots his facial bruising, Castiel’s eye and cheekbone purpled by one of the Red Wings’ meaty fists. Cas, who makes a point of never joining fights on-ice, sits here in front of Dean with his knuckles scabbed and bloody.
“Cas, I’m gonna—” Dean managed, just as a guttural moan hit and Castiel’s hips snapped roughly forward, his body buried inside Dean as deeply as it could. Dean held him tight as they rocked their way through orgasm, Dean making breathy noises against Castiel’s cheek that hardly counted as kisses.
Cas hums agreement. Dean looks at him more closely, eyeing the heavy lines Cas’ grace casts beneath his eyes.
“A cloud?” Dean asks hopefully.
The day is warm, the sky a bright blue pocked with fluffy white clouds. Dean keeps the radio tuned low past the outskirts, his gaze bouncing beyond the ditches and skimming over the seas of wheat surrounding them. He takes the corner at the tail end of their procession, pulling from smooth highway onto single lane grid road.
Sam sighs, disappointed. “So she can’t help, really.”
Dean touched Castiel’s cheek, his expression turning reverent. Castiel felt a sudden swelling in his chest in answer, the sensation of a connection so strong it stole his breath away.
Cas inhales sharply. “If one more person asks me if I’m alright, so help me—”
Dean leans into the hand Castiel has set to sifting through his hair. His body twists in its seat, moving until Castiel is close—closer. He slings an arm around Castiel’s hip, pulls him down. Hauls him between the open vee of his legs until Castiel can only sit on Dean’s thigh.
The djinn closes her eyes, briefly elated, as she smiles. “What a fine talent you have for evading reality.” Opening, her knowing gaze snags sharply on Dean. “Why not ask the dreamer himself, oh lover boy?”
The choice to leave Dean in the dark seems to Castiel like a costly mistake. If only Bart would listen to him… but Castiel is little more than a liaison between Bart and legacy. A systems analyst is no substitute for the management role Adler should be playing.
In the parking garage, Dean tosses his laptop bag roughly into the passenger seat. He drives home, fuming, his headache growing. The street lights flare with sunlike auras as they whirl by.
“What can I do?” Castiel asks—paused partway into packing up his laptop for the end of the day, Dean belatedly realizes. He just burst in, unannounced, and started venting without even considering the time of day.
So Dean works with the fire out in his heart. He is an automaton, a machine moving on auto-pilot through each day.
“Um. Thanks.” Dean picks at a hangnail. “Can’t imagine it was easy, considering how out of it I was.”
“Fuck,” Dean says to no one in particular, except maybe the shitty hand dealt to him by fate. Two weeks since that trashy article and already his problems have become the team’s problems. Dean needs to smarten up if he wants to keep them on-track to the playoffs, which they’re bombing out of at this rate.
“No,” Claire agrees. “And we’re not sure why.”
But then Cas dropped his messenger bag into what Dean had come to think of as his spot at the table, and pulled out his tablet. It was an item Dean only saw as it related to Cas’ work persona, which Cas made a pointed effort to avoid whenever he was spending time at Dean’s.
“Is that why you’re eating here instead of from the mom-and-pop?” Dean thumbs over his shoulder, back toward the diner. He’d only managed a quick glance in as they walked by, but it seems more like their usual fare.
Dean snorted a soft laugh. “Bad reaction to the name brand, and I don’t have insurance that covers the more costly versions. Just gotta pray the next heat doesn’t suck or hit early.” His laugh turned brittle. “This one did both.”
Enough biding. Castiel returned to the task at hand, unbuckling his vessel’s belt, the leather hissing through the loops as he tugged it free. He unzipped his pants and pushed them down with his underwear. He then stooped to awkwardly pull off each sock, and then folded and set the whole pile atop the rest of Jimmy’s clothes.
Castiel shifts slightly, his lips dragging over Dean’s cheek.
“Harrison Ford in khaki,” Dean answered, “or Harrison Ford in space.”
, Dean thinks suddenly, heartbeat racing.
No. Castiel cannot afford to dwell on it; he’ll lose himself if he does.
Castiel falls silent. Dean can hear him thinking, can feel his thoughts thrumming in the pulse beneath his fingers. “Hey, c’mon. They should be thanking you, if anything. You saved the day.”
Castiel leans back in his seat, a wince twisting his brows. “I doubt web services will be happy about that.”
Max gives her a reassuring smile. “Right.” To Dean, his smile weakens. “Doesn’t matter how often I mention Abbie to her, it just won’t stick. Doesn’t make sense.”
It’s late again by time Dean pulls his head out of debugging, his mind slowly dragging away from the zone where programming comes easily. He feels drunk afterward, having submerged sometime in the early afternoon only to emerge again in darkness, having completely lost track of time.
. If you ruined the place, I’m not finding a spell to sort it back out in time!”
“Trying to.” Claire scoffs. “As if she and Alex are actually ever gonna be normal.”
Three cancellations in a row counted as an emergency, right? Dean’s thumb hovered over the call button, ready to tumble down that rabbit hole.
“Need to finish my notes,” Dean says, belated, as Castiel drags them and their belongings towards the elevator. “Presentation tomorrow.”
“—and do you know how many corn fields there are between North Dakota and Minnesota? Because, uh, let me tell you, there’s—”
Rather than seeming happy, Libby takes a harrowing breath, her expression growing drawn. One of the kids moves to her side. He puts a hand on her shoulder and whispers something. Libby looks back to Dean, her face pinched and pale.
Only once this ritual is completed does Dean allow himself to pick up Castiel’s paper. To smooth it out, unfold it. The inside fold has a single line of information: ten digits, broken into telephone format. Castiel’s new cell number. But as the page further unfurls, Dean realizes there’s more to the note than the promised contact information.
Realization dawning, Dean scoffs to himself. Raph might not have given Dean the title and prestige that comes with it, but he’s effectively made Dean the SA anyway.
Castiel clings to the back of his head, fingertips angling him closer, his nose brushing Dean’s cheek. Stubble rasps pleasurably against his chin. A hand slides down the side of Dean’s neck, pushing beneath the hem of his shirt. Weight comes with it, and Dean finds himself being pressed back into the couch cushions, Castiel moving atop him in his wake.
“Yeah,” he says, tone firming as he warms into the decision. “Yeah, I can do it.”
Dean stands to meet Raphael’s handshake, then turns to offer his hand to Castiel.
Castiel was irritatingly endearing, the way he was tapping through the tablet he had retrieved from his bag. Head down and focused, tousled hair bobbing as he navigated through the device’s screens. Dean felt his already-hard cock twitch, thinking about how Castiel would look with his head bobbing between Dean’s legs.
At his seat behind his desk, Dean pumps his fist in private celebration. He quickly glances at his office door, ensuring none of his team is watching him savor the loss of their current SA.
On his way to emptying out his coffee, the light in the corner office switches off. By the time Dean is rinsing out his cup, Castiel has come up beside him, gaze atypically off-center from Dean himself. His hands twist the strap of his messenger bag, flexing with a nervous energy.
The truck hood slams, accompanied by further cursing. Dean marches through the underbrush and sticks his head in through the driver side door. “Think the belt is fucked, again. Swear to God—well, not actually—but it’s gonna take at least a day’s work to get it starting again.”
“Have Dean and I ever...” Castiel struggles with how to finish the thought.
They’re on borrowed time, all of them, just trying to memorize what they can. Dean saves key screenshots of the footage and makes handwritten notes about the abductor, trying to come up with a shorthand code that maybe won’t get erased, even if nothing they’ve tried has worked so far. He switches focus to the television when the local news starts up a special report on the abduction, and he’s on such high alert about it that he almost misses the knock on the front door.
Dean pulls the photo out from its album pocket and shreds it into tiny pieces, scattering it beneath the table.
Dean watched the rain claim Cas. He ran a thumb over his lips, chewed his cheeks. Shook his head. “Son of a bitch.”
Claire gently punches his shoulder. “Nobody escapes grunt work around here. Now, you still want that cheeseburger?”
Cas comes up to Dean slowly, scanning the area with a squint. A breath shudders out from Dean, partly from the perimeter, partly from proximity. He wipes at the sweat forming on his brow.
“Yeah?” Sam glances at Cas, though he continues suctioning gravel from the wheel wells. He and Dean apparently drew rocks over who was responsible for cleaning her; Sam lost, while Dean curiously took the opportunity to go out for the day.
So Dean does what they need. He’s waited this long already to take care of himself anyway. Lord knows he can handle waiting a couple extra weeks.
Not that Nat’s complaining. Darling’s visitations have kept Nat in business longer than most small town stops get in this day and age. Before the boys moved in somewhere nearby, Nat had to shutter her doors at eight each night and on civic holidays, if she ever meant to have an hour’s peace of her own. Now she at least can afford a couple hired hands to warm her seat during the peak hours.
“After tonight, who knows if I’ll even get to play!” Dean argues, exhaling sharply on a harsh breath. His mouth puckers as he mulls over that sour thought. Concussion protocol means Dean’s gonna be off the ice for at least a week, maybe more. Even if he makes it back in record time, there’s no saying Bobby’s gonna trust him to play first line through any of the finals.
Laughing, Dean wanders back to his laptop, giving Castiel the space he needs in the kitchen. The converter continues to whir through the files Dean gave it, the automated process moving smoothly through its second batch of tables.
But he could have been.
“Hey.” Dean touches Cas’ back, slides a hand to his waist. “You tired?”
Dean cleared his throat, glancing pointedly at the kitchen clock, which did the trick of encouraging Castiel to cut to the chase. “Your profile said you were only looking for proximity during your heat, not sexual intimacy. Have you reached out to other service providers before with similar requests?”
so much.
A life outside the office.
Cursing again, Dean pushes back his chair. “Leave it to me. I’ll find out what the fuck is going on.”
Dean drops his head to the bench seat. Back to the motel it is.
Castiel frowns. “Is that a problem?”
Dean just knows that when it’s all done, it will be worth it.
, Dean kept telling him, gripping Castiel’s hips and rocking against him, Castiel landing with these heady thuds that left Dean shuddering and scarcely satisfied.
Castiel rests his head atop the pillow beside his, the one Dean normally stuffs against his chest and clings to with both arms. It’s been awhile since he’s had anyone to share it with. He watches the way Castiel falls into it, settling heavily on his side, blinking back at Dean with a guileless smile on his face. He watches those blue eyes close, his breaths slow, growing even.
But after a while, some of the humans grow bored by the constant perfection. Petty fights break out over what the backyard ought to look like. One human grows tired of the constant companionship and locks himself away so wholly that the angels whisk him back to his private heaven. The remaining humans then fuss over his absence, struggling to enjoy the peaks of human experience happening back to back without end.
“If it were up to me, we would,” Castiel said, sincerely.
“Do you mind if I undress?” Castiel asked.
Castiel chuckles, eyes crinkled, his smile growing fond as he quiets. When Dean looks back to the screen, he finds Sam shrewdly watching him as well.
Dean settles back, despite the chill filling him with the need to flee.
A moment later, Dean’s phone pings. He drops his hand to open the message, except the text is muddied by fingerprint smudges. He scrubs the phone across his shirt, breathes on the glass, and then repeats the motion over a leg of his boxers. The screen is clear; the words are not.
“The girl that’s been kidnapped,” Dean says.
Judging by the worry lines etched around his puppy-dog eyes, Sam doesn’t seem convinced. As if summoning a specter, Sam even suggests, “There’s no harm in looking for a different job. Especially if you’re feeling detached from what you’re doing right now.”
“So how is Sam?” Castiel asks as he stirs the saucepan.
The cabin is as quiet as a house of prayer.
“Sure,” Dean says cautiously. “I can give you his extension, though,” he adds, reciting off the four digits in rapid succession, seeing how he’s already had to repeatedly advise the other teams to reach out to Castiel at his desk.
“It’s for me?” Castiel asks, at the same time Sam grumbles, “It’s not a bad car, Dean, even if it’s not pretty.”
“No problem. I can give her a rundown.” Dean jots more notes. “She just has to run the legacy application and then web services, checking the groups match what we see in the tables.”
Finally, Castiel can breathe.
“They’re benign,” Cas says. “Most frequently known for protecting grazing flocks and their shepherds, or tending to the children left alone while their parents farm.”
“Oh.” It hurts more than it ought to, slipping in like a blade straight between the ribs. Dean nods sharply, readjusting in his chair. “Okay. Um. Okay.” He takes back his hand, and stands shakily, legs suddenly quavering. “I’ll just. Yeah.” He gives a pathetic wave toward the door.
Sam’s mouth puckers. “We improvised.”
He bites into his burger, chews. Waits until Dean has resumed eating before he says, “You still haven’t told me about our fight.”
With a rough lead regarding Rebecca’s aunt’s farm, they make plans to move south en masse in the morning, mapping out the barrier beyond the city itself. Patience’s fears over the changing perimeter are quickly proven true: the perimeter has grown, with a whole new swath of streets having succumbed to the barrier’s radius.
, Castiel thinks.
But as the hours tick on and Dean’s office light is still left on, Castiel is ready to call his plan another crippling disappointment—if Dean doesn’t want to see him, and is in fact waiting for
Castiel breathes aloud, “Dean.”
Garth’s expression wipes clean of all unhappiness, and he giggles, much to Dean’s dismay. “Of course you, silly! I mean, no offense, Sam,” he adds, glancing over dismissively, “but no one would ever believe a guy like me ended up with
“Unfortunately, the feelings aren’t mutual.” Castiel’s mouth twitches, one corner moving upward, but it’s giveaway enough that Miriam punches him gently in response. His gaze casts over to Dean’s office, but Dean ducks away before he can see him.
At first the two men are nothing more than blurry shadows, ones he has to blink sharply against in order to resolve. There is a bandage covering his eye, and some sort of fabric is taped right beneath his nose. His mouth is dry, his lips split around something light but solid. A steady beeping comes from somewhere above his head.
“Wait, Max—you’re coming
Turns out It was a full two weeks before Dean was brought in.
?” Steve squeaks out.
Except, no. They know better than that, now.
The sight of him slices open the wound still throbbing in Dean’s chest. He has to look away.
He nods sharply, refusing to look back as he leaves.
Her free hand extends toward Dean. He gives her his arm, falling into place beside her.
Thursdays tend to be Dean’s busiest days, typically because upper management holds most of their resource meetings on Fridays. The higher-ups always want a rundown of how the ongoing projects are going, with intel summarized by the boots on the ground rather than investigated by themselves.
Rowena holds both hands to her face, gasping. Dean rolls his eyes and motions for her to dial the act back a notch.
First up is a djinn, making a fair toss that lands slightly askew from the one o’clock angle. Following her is an okami and a rugaru, neither of which are able to surpass her aim. But after them come a line of vampires and werewolves that seem to care less about the angle of their throws and more about how far the tree trunk flies through the air. The crowd cheers more for these kinds of tosses, drowning out Joyce’s attempts to remind them what game they’re playing.
Castiel closes his texting app, and opens the photo library next.
“To, what—me?” Dean pointed at himself, laughing. But when Cas didn’t join in, his jaw fell slack. “Cas, you serious?”
There’s a light on yet in one office, one that makes Dean scowl when he places its source. If he squints hard enough, he can see a mop of messy dark hair moving behind the blinds, Castiel’s head bobbing as he glances from his computer to the handwritten (
“‘Scuse me,” he says to Castiel, summoning a cough for extra emphasis, and hauls the laptop into the bedroom with the door closed. He perches on the bed and counts down the time it should take for Sam to feel contrite, and then reopens his laptop and reconnects the call.
The woman harrumphs, the entirety of her displeasure buzzing down the line. “Tell them to stop by quarter-to if they want ‘em,” she says, and with it, she hangs up.
Dean ducked with Sam behind the nearest tree. They met each other’s eye, made signals about which direction to run, when the goofy yellow poncho carrying the flashlight called out Dean’s name.
Castiel pauses with his mouth open. He then blurts: “I’m worried we’ll go back to fighting, now that we’re at the office again.” He glances up finally, eyes bright and over-sincere as they bore into Dean’s. “It means a lot to me, that we were able to talk before. And I’d like to continue that somehow. To find peace we can manage on the day to day.”
“Nah, s’alright. I can—Cas, c’mon, no—”
Old frustration burbles up inside of him, thinking about how many times he’s been suckered into this exact same position—trying to keep his teammates happy by sucking it up with a taut smile on his face. Part of him wants to tear into whoever put him in this position—historically, it was Bart’s poor analysis that got Dean stuck here more times than he can count.
Cas shrugs, giving a sour look that Dean assumes is his new resting face. “Without my grace, I am… recovering, but it will be some time yet before I’m capable of accepting its return.”
Castiel’s laugh rumbled through him, and Dean’s dick surged with need. He hooked a leg over Castiel’s thigh, drew him in until Dean felt Castiel’s erection grind against his.
The rich spice of the rut was less jarring, now that Dean knew what it was. But there weren’t any of the other tell-tale markers that Dean associated with rutting alphas: no notes of jealousy or possessiveness tainted Cas’ scent. There was nothing to do with lust or insatiable craving. Cas just smelled like—well,
Cas nodded, swallowing thickly. He gripped his bowl in both hands. Dean waited impatiently for him to gather his thoughts; Cas was probably a little addled by all the hormones in flux inside him.
Alarmed, Castiel looks up to find Dean already crossed to his side of the desk. “Dean, are you okay? You look pale.”
His forehead thumps against the wood; his hand shakes on the doorknob. Dean hovers offside, looking for clues as to badly Castiel might be melting down. But Castiel’s eyes are open, drawn to the floor. He is just breathing, body trembling, staring down into middle distance.
Ah, damnit. Exhaling roughly, Dean scrubs a hand through his hair. Did nobody tell Castiel what he was signing up for when he took the job?
“No,” Jack says, implacably calm. “Chuck has been handled. They’re safe on Earth.”
“Dean,” Castiel repeats, louder. He breathes in, fortifying, then: “You don’t have to tell me everything I’ve forgotten. I would never burden you with that expectation. But can you at least tell me why we’re fighting.” He swallows, emotion rising in his throat. “I want to know what I’ve done to lose you.”
“Jack, don’t—” Dean calls out, pursing his mouth when Jack enters the house anyway. He looks around, but Cas is carrying on a halting conversation with the remaining two, so Dean holsters his gun and makes his way after Jack.
“Cheers from the slaughterhouse.” Dean drains the last of his drink.
“You added kissing,” Cas said, looking up from the tablet. His eyes were soft, despite his formality, and he had that small, inscrutable smile settled gently on his face.
One of the angels scratches their blade through the demon trap on the floor, and then suddenly the demons are breaking for them.
“That’s strange,” Castiel says, “because both Bart and Adler assured me you weren’t necessary for the approval process.”
Dean puts the request in for vacation time a month before he wants to take it, but Adler doesn’t get back to him until another two weeks have passed.
“I didn’t, actually.” Miriam smirks. “Not this weekend at least.” With her pinky finger outstretched, she raises her coffee and says, mock-daintily, “I got invited out by Cas.”
Dean drops his gaze through his lashes, batting his eyes for good measure. Novak flinches back so sharply, Dean would swear Novak thought he had some kind of contagious disease.
, because Jean-Ralphio’s dad is definitely on the screen.”
“Aw, c’mon, sugar. It’ll be fun.” Garth grabs hold of Dean’s fish-limp hand, expression breaking as he giggles at his own antics.
Dean grabs the parcel out of the air, eyes widening. “Where’d you find a hex bag?”
Val is on shift in the fresh produce section, stacking waxy red apples into neat piles, when the automatic doors hiss open, giving way to a trio of girls she’s never seen before.
“It doesn’t have to, if you don’t want it to. But some people like to fix things.” Castiel’s mouth slants upward. “When I explained this to the host, there was almost a mutiny.”
Dean doesn’t remember Alex leaving, or Sam throwing blankets over the both of them. Murmured conversations carry from the room’s front entryway, but for all Dean cares the rest of his family may as well be miles and miles away.
Cas smolders harder, nearly seething as he accuses, “You kissed him back. Did you enjoy it, Dean? Did you want him to kiss you?”
“I know,” Anael says. “But Raph will have to explain to the board why an emergency work order was logged and four people are expecting a night’s worth of OT to be paid.”
Ryan looks to Maggie, who seems as equally intrigued by the commotion. Together, they approach the source of the smoke gently wafting from the kitchen.
A song picks up, mid-tempo.
“And she’s always bored,” says a man coming up behind her.
Dean blinks, pushing sleep from his eyes. He turns down the TV, dropping the room beneath the din of the storm outside, and then pushes up until he can crane his neck towards the laptop across the gap between their beds.
Dean sighs loudly, lowering his BLT to its plate. “How the fuck Bart managed that promotion, I’ll never know. Guy didn’t even know how to do his job. Always left me doing most of it,” he adds, not that the complaint is news to them, or worthy of garnering any sympathy.
Dean cracks a wide smile, laughing. “No way, no. You can’t hold that against me. We had a vamp nest in Kentucky that weekend! There’s no way we could've—”
Dean offers a shaky, boyish grin to Adler, who sits across from him at the conference table, between Bart and Castiel, which—what the hell is Castiel doing here? There’s no way he’s ready to handle this kind of meeting yet.
“It’s fine, Dean,” Castiel says. “I got what I needed from it.”
“You’re gonna be sorry you asked for that,” Bobby tells him, looking over his shoulder at Ellen and the rest.
The walk back to his office clears his vision enough for him to see all the heads popping over their cubicles to spy on him, post-yelling match. It feels shitty, having all eyes on him, but he can’t take it back now. Not without becoming more spineless than he already has been, all these weeks with BEAU holding the reins.
Drawn over by the ruckus, Sam appears around the corner from his room, scrubbing his eyes as he walks. He blinks at Dean and Cas’s hand-holding, frowning until his eyes gain focus. “Did the tethering get worse?” he asks, glancing between them.
Afraid that the Dean in dreams and the Dean in reality are two very different people, and the one standing before him might not admit to feeling the same way.
Miriam scrubs a hand over her mouth. "I know. Just know that web services is gonna be pissed for a bit. And me. I’ll be pissed."
Sam and Mary come inside to open talks with the kids, so Dean hikes back across the field—outdoors, this time—to catch up Jody and the others on the predicament in the house. Jody’s expression turns grim the longer she listens, the conversation ending when she wanders off to make a phone call. Dean drafts Max and Alicia into driving their vehicles inside the yard’s shelterbelt, parking along the grass beside the lane.
Cas hummed noncommittally. He shuffled beneath his blanket, and Dean sniffed the air, sifting through the notes wafting from the alpha behind him. Trying to determine just how much trouble he was about to be in.
Dean dreams of a Cas that actually stays.
If he hates Dean, why would he be so generous? More troubling: if their situations were reversed, would Dean have done the same?
The radio kicked on, flashing through its channels. A song crooned out from an AM station, a man’s voice warbling sorrows through the dusk.
The depth of human history has convened to this moment, and when Dean’s gone there won’t even be a grave to show that he was there.
“Cas?” Dean calls, his attention circling back to the armchairs. The queen’s chair has been vacated, empty save for a twig and a lump of dirt, but Cas still lies sleeping in his.
Castiel’s expression softens, turning fond. He touches Dean’s cheek. “I know. I do too.” His hand falls, soft smile fading. “But it isn’t up to me. And I’d rather get out before Michael can make his final blow.”
Dean reviews the email. Curses. The bastard didn’t even carbon-copy in the rest of the team.
Cas gives a small smile, his eyes crinkling fondly. “Yes, you can.”
Castiel tightened his grip on the steering wheel, straining to keep from leaning into Dean’s touch. The blind need for physical sensation ebbed through him too, though not nearly as strong an impulse as it was in Dean.
“Next time,” Cas agreed.
“I know,” said Castiel. “I’m sorry.”
Castiel removes his bandages and pulls out his sutures, once sufficient time has passed. He shaves every morning, only to be greeted again by stubble before the day’s end.
“Not an actual cloud, Dean, you know that. Now come on, step into the elevator.”
“Goodnight, Dean.”
Dean frowns up at his brother. “Stable? That the best you can say,
Dean feels his face grow cold. He can sense where this is going, but still he refuses to look it in the eye. The thought makes his hands go numb, fear clogging his throat. He doesn’t want to make an assumption, but Cas has brought this up for a reason and so—
“What about me,” Dean says. “Where do I fit in.”
Castiel shrugs. “Passable.”
The miles seemed to inch along despite the reckless pace they were setting. Castiel’s mind felt overrun with the catalog of symptoms currently harbored in his vessel: the rapidity of his heartbeat; the sweat gathering on his overheated skin; the gentle tremors that had entered his limbs, his body so flushed with desire for Dean that he could barely restrain himself.
it is that Agent Douglas—Doug—needs these things for.
Castiel winces. His body hurts more than it should. “How many did I injure?”
“How about this.” Claire extends her hand, palm up, and begins ticking down her fingers. “Abbie Lynn is sixteen years old and lives on 5th Avenue with her mom, stepdad, and a younger sister. Her dad lives out of state, and her mom sounded genuinely upset during the public plea put out for Abbie’s return. She’s quiet, but she gets good grades and was well liked at school. Nobody could explain why somebody would come after her, or why no one even tried to stop the abduction while it was happening.”
Sam scoffs. “Didn’t take you for a quitter.”
Castiel has the door open, and has stepped partly back into the hall, when he hears: “We had a fight.”
Mary’s voice calls out. “Dean?”
When Castiel opens his eyes, he is no longer in the Empty.
“Okay. They’re okay. Max and Alicia too; they’re all recovering in the other room.” The bed squeaks as Sam readjusts. “I told them to take a break, so of course they’re working on the case. But they’re okay. We weren’t in the perimeter nearly as long or far as you.”
Cas taps his nails against the Coke bottle, chiming out a hollow ring. He then sweeps aside the bottle, so sharply that the glass clinks against the pebbles in the footwell. Dean frowns, a protest forming, but in a lithe movement Cas undoes his seat belt and slides along the front seat, and then reaches for Dean to undo his too. Dean follows the motion of his hands, how Cas hooks his grip beneath Dean’s thigh and reels him in, pulling him into the middle seat.
“Bring him by sometime,” she calls after him as he departs. “You’re welcome to dinner anytime.”
Dean follows a half-step behind, hitting the front deck around the same time that Castiel is creaking open the cabin’s front door.
“What about when I sit in his lap?” he murmurs, leaning close to Cas’s ear.
Sighing, Castiel pushed himself up the bedspread, resting his back against the headboard while tuning in to the television. He watched the pornographic imagery play out on the flatscreen, his hand sluggishly touching the open front of his trousers as he attempted to gain arousal. The people caressing each other on-screen seemed impossibly attuned to one another, the mouth of one resulting in another’s sighs; the touch of one leading to their cradling from the other.
Castiel nods. “You wanted to save him.”
“All in favor?” Max asks, raising his hand.
He doesn’t know how far he gets, only that it’s not far enough before he’s falling again, fighting to stay upright. Cas is shaking in his arms, his head tipped back, mouth foaming pink, eyes pale and rolling. Then something rough pops in Dean’s eye sockets and his vision gives out for good, darkness greeting him no matter how frequently he blinks.
Eileen exhales sharply, her eyes rolling comically large. “You know. Always busy. I stay up half the night reviewing patient files. Sam says that I’ve forgotten how normal people sleep.”
Castiel is still pondering the best solution even before their first trial fails.
Castiel’s tie is gone. He must have stripped it off some time during the evening, maybe while he was cooking.
“The defined edge of my self, or aura,” Castiel replied. “My trueform’s corona.”
From across the parking lot Max approaches with a smile, his arms open and placating. “Dean, hey. Okay, don’t be mad, but I wanted you to know, before you freak out—”
“At the start, maybe. But it’s not amateur hour anymore.” Dean shimmied down, his legs spreading, his hand working his cock seemingly for show. “Start like this—see what I’m doing with my wrist?”
The woods rustled suddenly, branches snapping above the rain, and a flashlight bobbed between the trees. Dean cursed, wondering who could have spotted them—the grave was deep in the trees, but the cemetery itself ran close to a major highway. This time of night, the local cops might’ve taken an interest in whoever parked an Impala alongside cemetery row.
“Are you close, baby?” Dean murmured, mouthing at Castiel’s neck, and for his life Castiel had never felt his nerves alight such as in this moment, with Dean’s hands and his mouth upon him, his body beneath Castiel’s supporting him, yet keeping him purposefully from settling.
“Hm?” Castiel glances behind him, his neck and jawline now exposed. “Oh. My children.”
Castiel sighed to himself, seemingly below the roar of crackling electricity. Above it, he shouted, “This isn’t me.”
Castiel squeezes Dean’s hand in return, muscles flexing like he doesn’t know how long he ought to hold on. Dean’s almost disappointed when Castiel lets go, allowing him to return to his fork and his plate of desserts.
He drops his bag onto the unruffled bed and surveys the room. Clothes spill out from a pair of lounging chairs, and Sam’s laptop sits humming beside the TV, coated by reams of handwritten notes that're likewise scattered across the room. Charger cables snake out from heaps of discarded laundry, adding up to a minefield of tripping hazards every which way.
The hair on Dean’s arms stood up. The air suddenly hurt to breathe. “You don’t wanna be family?”
Cas laughed again, between kisses, but it didn’t feel mean-spirited to him. If anything, the deeper parts of Dean delighted in eliciting such joy within him. His body thrilled at pleasing his alpha, emboldening Dean to take more.
Cas laughs, his eyes crinkling, and damn isn’t that a sight Dean wants to see again and again, and again.
Dean inhales sharply. The cake tastes like it’s been baked exactly how the side of the box describes it should be baked—and yet it’s somehow extra delicious from the effort being made. He wipes his mouth, puts his fork down. “You didn’t need to—I didn’t need you to do that for me.”
“Dean,” Castiel says. “He’s angry with me. He barely speaks to me, even if I prompt him. And I don’t know why.”
“Bedroom?” Castiel asks, and Dean breathes, “Yeah.”
A taller girl stands now, one with dirty blonde hair. By her description Dean assumes it’s Abbie, rising to the defense her sister. Abbie looks to the guy as well, seeking reassurance. Haltingly, she says, “Trent said that we could stay here. That Etri and Aini and Wemi would protect us. That we wouldn’t have to go back.”
Dean might be stubborn and self-sacrificing and hotheaded, but he’s also clever and caring and
Inias and Miriam did well filling in for him, and beyond catching up on his email inbox, there aren’t any alarm bells ringing on his list of things to do. Dean analyzes his new defects in less than an hour, and resolves them in less than two. After he’s done, he has so much spare time it almost feels like he’s playing hooky. It’s been awhile since he’s slowed down enough to see the clock tick by throughout the day.
“Aren’t you gonna sit with us for lunch?” Miriam asks, after she catches Dean scurrying his sandwich from the break room fridge straight back to his office. She pins her hands to each side of the door frame, like she can physically block him from closing his office door.
With the last of his strength, Dean throws back the covers and clambers inside them.
Dean brushes up against the edge of the perimeter, same as the rest of them, while they watch Jack go. Mary and Jody test the vanishing points of the farmhouse, wandering side to side, while the younger women make a game out of stepping into the perimeter, seeing how long they can hang inside the edge before the ache becomes too great.
“Exactly, thank you.” Miriam flaps her hand at him. “What’ll they even do if someone gets injured? There’s no way our insurance covers this.”
It’s another warm one in Lebanon, the sun scratching up Dean’s neck through the driver side window, a restless energy burning right through him. Dean drums his nerves along the steering wheel, humming with the stereo turned low. The cloudless sky continues through the entire drive to North Dakota. Traffic remains low, though road construction tests his patience as soon as he crosses the I-90, and again just north of Bismarck.
“Dean.”
Dean says, “Jack, you don’t have to—”
to—they shouldn’t—not while they’re—
“Okay, okay,” Dean said, clapping his hands together, and then shook out his arms and legs. It was meant partly for the theatrics, partly to ensure that his muscles were primed to flee. Dean dug his heels into the dirt road. “Hit me.”
It is a prayer. One meant solely for him.
Sam hovers, just a moment, as if determining whether Dean is alright enough to back away. He settles at the foot of the bed, barely illuminated by the honeyed light from the kitchenette.
They’re all tense with nerves, watching. Dean crowds up beside Cas, feeling his tension as he leans into Cas’ shoulder. Cas nudges back before leaning stiffly against him, his gaze trained on Jack’s retreating form.
“I didn’t—” Castiel flounders. His hands wring his messenger bag strap. “I just wanted to say thank you. For all your hard work.”
“The other portal is in the bedroom upstairs,” Jack explains, gesturing to a square of beige wallpaper hanging in the space behind him, where his neniven stands. Jack opens his palm. “Aini shared their thoughts with me, and explained the schedule. The children choose this space to play in during the day, and then return to the farmhouse for the evening. Aini and their siblings stand guard throughout.”
“I wasn’t here for the firsthand,” Dean reminds her. “Somebody better tell me my seven.”
Dean can’t catch feelings for Castiel. He just can’t. He cannot get involved with a coworker, especially the first one who is technically his friend.
Dean slams his fist against the wheel, cursing. He climbs out of the cab in a huff, popping the hood once again.
For Cas, he could have been.
Dean’s not sure he’s ever considered a coworker a friend before. Sure, he’s
It was nice, for their first. The kiss was dry but warm, unhurried in a way that made Dean ache. He burned up inside where Cas’ hand was still touching his face.
The office is too formal for the two of them to be here.
“Out,” Dean snaps, pointing a finger. He turns around, repeating, “C’mon, git,” when neither dev refuses to budge. Sighing, he adds, “Don’t we have work to do?”
On the nightstand is Castiel’s crumpled letter, the same place as it’s been since Dean tossed it there, weeks earlier. Tucked between the spare pens and empty bottles, a phone charger snaked beneath it.
Even so, when Dean turns around he isn’t expecting the guy to be so
“The puke perimeter,” Claire calls cheerfully. “Patience got to name it, since she upchucked first when we crossed it.”
“Look at me, boosting the average. With the crowds I’m pulling, think they’ll offer me a raise?” Dean flashes a pearly smile, to which Novak shoves a forearm against Dean’s chest, slamming him back into the lockers.
Dean raises a brow. “Don’t want them knowing you’ve messed with the team format, huh?”
With nothing to do but wait, Dean kicks at the field around him, stomping down a small crop circle in his current spot. He spins slowly, listening to Patience and Alicia chatting, his gaze carrying out across the prairie. It’s odd, now that he’s thinking about it, that Cas had to shore himself up before stepping out. Like he was gathering himself before walking out into a storm.
Dean laughs, off-kilter enough that it comes out sounding brittle. “One way of putting it.” He looks between her and Sam, who has wandered over from where he was tossing the trash. “What’s causing it? Witchcraft?”
“Don’t worry,” Castiel says. “I’m very good at estimating temperatures.”
The cold concrete beneath his knees has disappeared. He’s enveloped in a room so dark he cannot see. Standing upright, hands at his side. Mind suspiciously devoid of the worries he
“Why are you guys knocking down walls?” Sam shouted.
“—And sure, the icing was a little lopsided and the sprinkles uneven, but it still counts.” Jack’s proud grin beams even more brightly. “I got to make my first birthday wish.”
“What the hell?” Dean’s grip on his coffee cup falters, slackening with shock. His gut clenches with sympathy and secondhand fear.
Max shakes his head. He waits until he’s within distance before speaking again. “Can’t sense any other source of magic within this place. The token is just too strong.”
Dean hums agreement, his shoe tapping against the edge of Castiel’s desk. The rhythmic thud makes Castiel glance sidelong away from his laptop, his eyes narrowed at Dean but his mouth quirked with humor, so Dean continues the annoyance.
“What? Oh. Wait until you have to deal with the puke perimeter all day, see how well that pans out.” Sam wrinkles his nose and ambles around the room, shifting loose piles of laundry into a single lump on his bed. “I keep getting a fever from it, full-body sweats. Have to change clothes constantly.”
“There’s no such thing as too flaky a pie crust,” the woman announces. “That recipe’s from one of Jody’s cookbooks. She wouldn’t have it lying around if it was garbage, so just …” A vague huffing noise, then, “Do it right. I guess.”
Dean loiters in the lobby of their office tower, feeling underdressed without his usual button-down and tie, a bookbag with a change of clothes slumped at his feet. He got an odd look from Virgil at front security, and would’ve likely been stopped if he weren’t already on a first name basis with the majority of the in-house security team. But the suits that pass Dean narrow their eyes at him, subconsciously snagging on how he stands out conspicuously in his t-shirt and jeans, his plaid overshirt rolled up to the elbows against the humidity hanging in the air. He’s surprised none of the higher-ups have taken it upon themselves to come over and try kicking him out for trespassing.
“Awesome.” Dean grins, practically leaping out of his chair. “I can do that, easy.”
? Seriously?”
Dean sighs, nodding his agreement. Castiel relaxes his hold, and helps Dean stand upright.
Dean pours that cold thought through him, lets it stiffen his spine. He forces all emotion out from his mind, from his body. Keeps his voice warm and smooth as he says, “Nah. No. Don’t worry about it.”
His head drooped onto Cas’ shoulder without intending to, though the arm he wrapped around Cas’ waist was entirely a choice of his own making. Cas hummed with satisfaction when he swung open the door to Dean’s bedroom, his nostrils flaring as he spied the nest Dean made for them.
Dean takes echoing steps down the hall, spies an empty living room in much the same condition as the kitchen: old-style furniture, well-used but clearly kept in fine repair. Old-fashion toys litter the hardwood floors, and textbooks sit open on the heavy oak coffee table. He rounds the corner for the staircase, takes a creaky step, and then thinks better of it and steps back. “Jack?” he calls again.
“Wait,” Ricky blurts, brain lagging behind. “You’re looking for
Dean briefly squeezes his eyes shut. “Cas…”
“Road view says no,” Patience replies, tapping at her phone, “but satellite view says yes, a house is here.”
Both bugs and scheduled updates? Dean can’t believe it. He’ll be handling all the dev for legacy on his own? His hands clench again, threatening to slam down on the desk. “So I’m not on the BEAU project.”
“Cas,” Dean snarks back.
Cas foists up, shoves his jeans and underwear down, his cock appearing in the gap between them. Dean finds himself staring dumbly down at the sight of it, wet and pink against him, his breath catching at its weight. Cas nips at his mouth and tongues his way back in, his fist moving to his leaking cockhead and giving it a slick pump.
Oh god. Dean winces at the thought of their final argument, how his temper got too far out of hand. In five years of employment—hell, in a year having
But Chuck isn’t paying them attention. He’s frowning, no longer lackadaisical. Dean thinks he almost looks—thrown off his game. But how?
—which lands off-center from the bullseye.
Cas laughed, loud and bright, and it warmed Dean to hear it rumble through his otherwise empty apartment. “I’ll take Indiana Jones, as if you’ve really given me a choice.”
Sam straightens, likewise affected as Dean. His hands look empty, clutching for some known book on some known shelf. “The lore says that without the Tree, all life on earth with eventually die.”
“For the most part,” Castiel replies. “There are—precautions in place, in case people come up with conflicting ideas about what would make them happy.”
Nat, who has kept her gaze unmoving on her paperback up until now, grabs her cane and a paper bag, and shuffles out the front door.
He finds Dean in the back corner, situated on the floor, back against the cold concrete wall. Dean is hunched over, his palms pressed to his eyes. A shallow noise shakes loose from him, shuddering with his breaths.
The dam bursts without warning. “So annoying! Jody stuck her in my room, so now I have to share with this loner who never sets a foot outside the bedroom. Add in a psychic who just
As the day of the axe throwing encroaches, Dean checks in with Inias and Anael to ensure they are okay working with reduced staff that Friday. Both have already said they’re fine staying behind, but Dean doesn’t want to assume that they won’t change their minds.
“C’mon,” Cas said, after another soft kiss, “let’s get you some rest,” and he led Dean over to the nest built on the bed. Dean felt the backs of his legs hit the mattress, and then Cas was pressing him down carefully into the covers, the two of them remaining in constant contact during the transition onto the bed.
Dean blinks, tracing Raphael’s attention back to the framed photo on the corner of his desk, and smiles at the sight of Sam and Eileen grinning out at him from behind the brass and glass. But Dean knows the question is perfunctory, so he curbs his earnestness and answers simply, “Just fine, thank you for asking.”
They luck out and find Castiel’s truck where Dean abandoned it, on the day Castiel was killed. Dean had driven it up to the patch of forest he had cleared cutting wood for Castiel’s pyre. The truck had been pushed in past the stumps Dean had left, and covered with pine branches.
“Yeah,” Dean says, nodding. “Yeah.”
It’s not until a while later, when the murmur of laughter and conversation has died down on the cubicle floor, that Dean receives a knock on his door. When he turns, chair creaking on its swivel, he finds Castiel standing there in the doorway, a plate of cake perched in hand.
“Anything pinging?” Dean asks, voice strange. Distant.
“What else do we have?” Sam frowns, his gaze cast out across the room. “Do we think it’s Joyce?”
There was a pause, and something throaty happened to Cas as he said, “Dean?”
“So it’s settled,” Sam says, nodding. “We’ll convoy out there and be ready as backup the moment Jack takes down the token. All in favor?”
“Yeah—Yes.” The sight of that smile made Dean’s face flush even deeper, if possible. “And some other things,” he mumbled, and he was scared, so scared, that Cas would ask him
Dean narrows his mouth with a closed-lipped smile. He probably looks constipated, but it’s better than having his actual feelings on the matter slip out. Instead, Dean asks, “What’s Castiel doing here? I thought you asked me to take care of it.”
In spite of himself, Dean smiles. “No way. Can’t imagine how that’s happened.”
“So why’re you so mad?” Dean blurts, even though it’s inaccurate. Castiel doesn’t seem pissed that Dean was nice to the kid, he’s just…
“Y’know, Novak ain’t the only one worrying after you,” Benny says casually. “Might be the most obvious about it, but…” Benny shakes his head, then squares himself, looking Dean straight in the eye. “No one blames you for what happened, alright? None of the boys think for one second you wanted to come out to us this way.”
Dean tries to roll his eyes, but he can’t even open them. He sucks at his cheeks, and his teeth rattle with the suction. “Mm. Not feeling it.”
Hannah tips her head side to side, a gesture they all recognize as meaning she’s trying to find a nice way to say something terrible.
“Let me reach out to deployment. You start the file conversions, and I’ll call Anael to see if she can help.”
Castiel says, “Let us know once your feelings on the matter have settled.”
“One of the partners,” Castiel replies. “Our estranged brother, Luke.” His face grows impossibly more grave.
, nimrod, not—”
The summer evening feels like it might never end.
“But what if something goes wrong? What if the converter fails, or the file formats are unacceptable—”
Nothing seems to happen for a very long time.
“Patience,” Patience answers slowly. “Not a witch either.”
"Yeah," Miriam agrees unhappily. "Gotta hope Bart and Raph are going to love that."
“So,” Castiel says. “It’s my last day.”
“Well,” Dean said. But Cas was right; the lemon honey tasted a lot better than straight hot water.
Every time the messenger app pings, Dean finds his irritation unfairly flaring, an ugly pressure building up inside of his chest in retaliation to Castiel’s latest line of inquiry. There’s just always another
Dean melts into his palm, his eyes closed.
“What’s with the homework assignment?” he asks, finger wagging at the paper.
Outside his apartment, he throws Baby roughly into park and slams off the ignition. The grouchy noise she makes has him wincing and petting her roof and side panels, apologetic, as he climbs out.
Castiel smiles, distracted. “What happened?” he murmurs, so Dean leans in close and tells him. Castiel’s mouth flattens, crumpled by more than just the news. “When is Bart taking him?”
It hasn’t happened often; in the millennia in which Castiel has lived, there have been only a handful of humans who have known how to call him by name.
“Nothing.” Dean puts on an insufferable pout. “Just wasn’t sure your phone actually works.”
Dean hides away the rest of the day in his office, door closed. He tells himself the sweat and fever he’s feeling is just because of how worked up Castiel has made him. That it’s not guilt that drives him forward, pushing him to edit Adler’s monthly meeting notes until it’s dark outside and his cough is making sparks fly in his vision.
“Listen, Dean,” Bart begins, strangely somber—probably because this is the third time Dean has called him about it this week. “We just don’t have it in the cards to get a new analyst for legacy. The accountants can’t justify the expenditure. You understand, right? You can just… keep filling in?”
Dean listens to his heartbeat, now roaring in his ears. For a month he’s waited so, so patiently for Cas, and he’s been
For once, Castiel’s nerves outweigh his end of day exhaustion, and he’s strangely geared up for what he’s about to do. The apology he intends to make has weighed heavily on him since he resolved to give it.
“What’s next though?” Alicia asks, looking around the group. “Forecast is clear, and everyone’s back on their feet.”
“There’s more,” Cas says gruffly. Dean follows his gaze, spies a couple more of the same species now standing inside the covered porch, watching from the threshold of the front door.
Dean catches the distant echo of his brother like it’s coming underwater. He runs for it, rushing. Tripping. Falling. Struggling, his grip death-tight on Cas…
“You missed the cake,” Castiel said, stepping forward, “so I brought you a slice.”
“—if she’s a hunter, she should remember, right? But she
“—and I must always be ready should they need me,” Cas finishes. “But when they don’t… I want to be here with you. If you’ll still have me, that is.”
Footsteps approach down the hall around the time Castiel has finagled cereal and milk into a ceramic bowl. He digs into a box of Crunch Cookie Crunch, and stares at the back of the box, pondering why Dean has reverted to purchasing such childish treats for his breakfasts.
Sam crowds in, keen on Max’s explanation of magics akin to the one Rowena put them onto, a type focused on inflicting remorse and physical pain. Even Patience perks up, taking a tentative seat on the foot of the bed where Claire is softly snoring. Dean pays only part-attention to all the talk about tokens. From the corner of his eye, he watches Cas instead.
perfect,
Cas shrugs, attention on the few fries Dean hasn’t already dragged through ketchup and stolen from his plate. “It’s nothing,” he says, brushing away Dean’s arm.
“I know,” Max says, still smiling, “but we were discussing Sam’s theory on the case you guys are on, and it turns out—”
“Who’s with you?
“No, Fitzger—” Garth begins, Dean elbowing him sharply and saying, “Sure.”
The sheriff’s office and county records both sit smack dab in the middle of the city, as does the courthouse, the high school, and anywhere else they could visit for any sense of a lead. Dean makes calls into the sheriff’s office for records on all missing persons, but feigning law enforcement is tough when he can’t charm his way around with the flash of a fake badge.
“Exactly.”
“You’re okay,” the man with long hair keeps saying. “Stevie got you here in time. You’re okay. You’re okay.”
“I’m fine,” Dean says crossly. Rubbing his eyes, he asks, softer, “What do you need?”
Ricky waits the half-beat for insult to rise, if the partner is truly a connoisseur kind of guy, but thankfully Doug seems grateful for the offer rather than offended.
Castiel exhales heavily.
On the screen is the side profile of a few unknown people, their arms angled above their heads, hands and elbows even heights to each other. In the background, large bullseyes are painted on sheets of plywood. In their hands are small, sharp hatchets.
Dean rolls his eyes. “You’ve seen Ennis, right? Dark hair, blue eyes? A sexy smattering of stubble?” He shrugs, grinning. “Hard to say no to that.”
“Oh.” Castiel’s gaze drops to his coffee mug, cupped gently between both of his hands—huge hands, by the looks of it. The cup is dwarfed by them. There’s some kind of bug drawn on the side of it; only the cartoonish outline of wings peeks out between Castiel’s fingers. “Sorry,” he adds, smokey and low, as he sidesteps toward the coffee.
Castiel was the one bringing him soup to work each day?
“I know,” Dean says again, cutting him off. He can’t handle hearing how it all should have been ‘fine’ one more time.
Dean shivers. He nods as if in a daze.
Dean whistles. “When did you order?”
Dean gets them as far as Kelso before he’s calling it for the night, pulling them into the parking lot of a motel whose sign they can barely see through the rain. They get a room with a pair of queen beds, the second to last ones left. Dean fiddles with the key until the lock unlatches and the door opens. Castiel does the honors of carrying in their bag.
“Heaven will be remade,” Castiel informs the chorus. “It is Jack’s wish that humanity no longer be kept in personal heavens, excepting those few soulmates whose heavens were made to be shared. Instead,” he continues, “we must create a new, open heaven. One where every soul is capable of visiting any other, should they wish. A paradise for all.”
Tilting back her head, Patience sighs. “We’re losing ground. Whatever’s causing the barrier is growing, and we have no way of stopping it, or even tracking it down.”
Five years of so-called exemplary work put in, and Dean is once again passed over for the job title of his dreams.
The bedroom is not one he recognizes anymore than the bedding. Clothes hang on a freestanding closet next to a dresser. A darkened doorway angles into what Dean assumes is an ensuite bathroom. An overstuffed armchair, draped with dark trousers, sits in the corner next to the bathroom.
Eventually, the trees clear enough to reveal the ocean, its waters a pitted and opaque gray. The rain softens its beatings against the rooftop, as they depart the trees. The Impala digs loamy ruts in the dirt leading to a cabin up ahead.
. The boy must glean as much from it too, because he quickly adds, “But Claire’s recipe wasn’t working, even after six tries. It kept asking for eleven cups of flour, and we ran out of—”
He remembers black blood spilling out from his mouth and Dean frowning down at him, unable to meet his gaze.
And then Castiel calls him aside at the end of day.
The day of axe throwing comes on a muggy summer morning, the air wet with the aftermath of thunderstorms that had rumbled through the area in the night.
Dean cracked a smile at that. “Take it you’re not a fan of that opinion?”
Dean scrubs his hand through his hair, thinking. He has weighed various ideas the whole day, trying to find the solution with the best outcome. There’s only one route he can see that really fits. “Can we bump up the schedule for phase three?”
Good. Things always get easier once the monsters start to bleed.
“So how is legacy?” Bart asks, after a brief interlude of small talk.
Dean was in the kitchen, making an omelette. He paused in his peppers chopping to frown at Cas. “What makes you think that?”
Dean pauses outside Castiel’s office. His knuckles crack on the half-opened door.
Jack shrugs. “Kind of. If I had more time, I could learn…”
“There’s three phases?” Dean scrolls back to the initial email, where Bart laid out paragraph after paragraph of explanations that could have been summarized in a sentence or two. “How long apiece?”
Cas mouths a soft kiss against Dean’s slack lips. “Welcome back, sunshine.”
“He’s not poaching you,” Dean says in a rush. “Not you, or Inias, or Anael. Or Hannah,” he adds belatedly, although she works in the pit downstairs, and it wouldn’t be possible for her to overhear and be offended.
Through the high-pitched ringing flooding his ears, Dean hears the crowd roar as another scuffle breaks out further down the ice. Fists are being thrown, but the shouts of the refs and the deafening crowd cut through anything else Dean might glean.
Dean wipes at the moisture building on his brow, the sun baking him in broad waves. He finishes the windshield around the time Claire wanders back. “How’s Jody’s, now that Kaia and Patience moved in?”
“I really want to kiss you right now,” Dean murmured, directly against Castiel’s throat.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Like we don’t have enough overhead already,” he says, to which Anael nods her agreement.
“Har har,” Dean grumbled, swiping back his hands. He righted the seam of his work gloves, tightening his grip on the pitchfork. “You picking potatoes or not?”
Too bad the guy’s a dud, but the legacy project has survived worse. Dean can push down the disappointment of his failed promotion enough that it won’t distract him from his duties.
“That’s not—” Dean cuts himself off, shaking his head. “Nevermind. Have a fun flight back to Syria.”
“You want every angel to accept that they and Heaven are imperfect?” Anael raises an eyebrow. “How blasphemous of you, Castiel.”
Castiel felt his cheeks heat, reddening to a hue complementary to Dean’s own. He could lie, but he failed to see the point. “Trying and failing to, yes.”
Dean turns his head. Looks up at Castiel. “You know about Jack, right?”
Castiel’s smile flickers and fades. He glances up. “Did you eat? I didn’t interrupt your supper, did I?”
“Good enough,” he tells his reflection, pausing in the hallway mirror on his way out the door. Belatedly, he sees he’s put too much effort into his styling, his smoothed cheeks and softened hair glowing like a neon sign pointing out how badly he wants this to be a date. But it’s too late to change it now; he’ll just have to hope his efforts will be worth it in the end.
“And look at you, fella.” Donna pulls up beside Cas and pinches his cheek. “Looking a little peaky at the edges, aren’t ‘cha?”
The bunker light, having been revived, promptly exploded. Dean drank his beer in the dark.
He arrives ten minutes before the official start of day instead of his usual half-hour early, slinking up the back stairwell even though his lung capacity isn't where it was before he got sick. It takes him longer than it should to get up to the legacy floor but he manages it, cracking open the stairwell door and peering inside. Both the cubicle floor and coffee cubby are blessedly empty; Miriam and Inias must be down a floor in the break room, stowing away their lunch bags.
Dean hangs his head. “I can’t—” He scrubs a hand over the back of his neck. Dean wants to shy away, but Castiel’s gaze holds him pinned in place. Lamely, Dean says, “I don’t know how to control how I feel.”
Dean frowns down at the thin t-shirt, tugging at the hemline. “When did I…?”
Nodding, Castiel collects himself upright, shuffling a hand through his bedhead. He pulls a pair of fresh boxers from the duffle bag — Dean only packed them the one, since Castiel has yet to build a proper human wardrobe, and Castiel mostly fits Dean’s wear anyways — and shuts himself in the bathroom.
Both Jack and Castiel are currently covered from the knees-down in a floury mixture, the victims of an upheaved bowl. Ryan spies what looks like eggshells gummed to the top of Castiel’s shoe. The crusty dregs of whatever they’d been mixing lies in lumps across the floor.
"Right." Dean nods. The air seems to change as his mind switches back to work. "So tell me—what did I miss?"
Since he’s human now, Castiel does his best to adjust to the requirements of his human body.
Dean shoves a handful of bacon into his mouth and motions to it as an excuse not to talk, chewing noisily while Garth and the couple exchange their fifteen combined comments.
Jack believes they are capable of doing this.
“I thought you ate already.”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Castiel said, quiet.
“So,” Dean says, tugging on Cas’ lapel. He looks so strange in that old frumpy trench coat, now black—close to what Dean knows but not quite the same. “How’d you pull this one off?”
to be blackmailed! Anyhoo, just want to remind y’all that our icebreaker games begin in fifteen minutes! Please settle in before then, and I’ll see you back here at the green.”
As much as he hates to do it, Dean shuts his mouth. Head pounding, he fights to contain the cough crawling up his throat.
So this is happening. Dean can deal with it. He can take on the work of two devs and keep his mouth shut about the weight of that workload. He can suck it up and just stand by while he’s excluded from the course his team is charting. He can be the last one left on the abattoir floor.
The sole reason that panic has not set in yet is that a rich, brothy scent wafts out from an indeterminable source, delectable even through Dean’s stuffy nose. He beelines straight for the fridge, his stomach rumbling at the mere suggestion of finding food. But as soon as he crosses the breakfast bar, he pauses, caught by the multitude of gift baskets overflowing the lower countertops.
Castiel props his cheeseburger against his lips with his bandaged hand, and gnaws at it absently while his good hand thumbs through his cell phone records. Sesame seeds brush off his lips with every bump in the road.
Once again—finally—the bunker teems with life.
Bart shrugs off her concern. "There are change rooms on-site at the axe throwing location. You can change your clothes there."
“Thank you,” she says in a voice that is abundantly grateful. She extends a hand to him, pulling Cas to his feet.
for baking help?” The short-haired cop whistles sadly. “Oh, honey, no. No wonder you were having trouble.”
Back in the living room, Castiel positions himself on the sofa with his laptop open. He pulls up the files last modified by Dean in the shared cloud and starts scanning the more recent of the two, looking for the point where its contents stop making sense.
“Holy shit,” Sam says quietly.
“Daisies are easier to take care of than a dog,” reminds Castiel, as he refills Dean’s mug with another round of tea.
Down the hall, to the boardroom. Inside, Raphael sits on the far side of the table with the other CAB members, a few of them familiar faces from the monthly products and implementation review. Naomi and Marv flank Raphael’s left, with Bart and Zach sitting farther down from them.
