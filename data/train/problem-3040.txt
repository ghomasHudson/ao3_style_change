“Well, they clearly married young and broke,” Cas jokes, holding up the receipt before he tosses it and the cardboard in the trash.
“Of course I did. Most fun I’ve had in a while. Yeah, some stuff went kinda screwy, I guess, but having you there made it fun anyway.”
“Anyone can read it, Sam,” Charlie explains. “You go to a website like AO3 and type in the search terms you want to use, and you can use filters. For example, if you want to find Ryllian fics, you can search by TV show, then by relationships. Ryllian fics aren’t hard to find. They’re one of the most popular pairings.”
The touch is enough to cut all of Dean’s strings, making him drop into Cas’ arms as if he’s done it a hundred times instead of one. Cas holds him the same way, the ever-present wind off Hattie Lake swirling around them.
The yelling stops as their door swings open once again. Dean steps in, looking utterly bewildered and nervous. When he sees Cas, those emotions seem to intensify. Cas rushes to him.
Dean does retire to his room to read, but tonight he’s looking for something simple, something easy and fluffy with little to no angst. One of the things he loves about fanfic is that there’s so much variety. He can find just about anything he needs to match his mood or his hankering that day. Action? Sure. Heavy angst? Plenty. Tooth-rotting fluff? More than Willy Wonka’s factory could make. Friends to lovers? Soooo much. A/B/O. Crack. Roommates (
“And that’s all I’m asking—don’t do this shit alone. Have backup. Have a plan. Maybe listen to the guy who loves you and don’t go out in shitty weather.”
They won’t have any more mornings like this. His little brother, who he kidnapped from foster care, whose parent-teacher conferences he went to his last three years of high school (to revel in the kid’s glory because he’s fucking brilliant), whose tears dried on his shoulder, who relied on him for everything until he didn’t, is flying the coop. He’s in love with Dean Winchester, and they’ve purchased a house a few miles away.
A week after they redecorate the apartment, the friends decide it’s time for Trial 2, because even though the shared spaces and sexually evocative materials annoy the hell out of Vaughn, they aren’t making as big an impact as Cas and Dean would like. So, on a Tuesday night in the middle of October, they have a few friends over, right at the time when Vaughn’s MAGA friends are around. Their goal is to expose their homophobic roommate to all the gay he can stand—until, hopefully, he can’t stand it and leaves.
“And those were reasons to die? Would you have let Sam or anyone else die if those were the reasons they gave?”
“I wish it were that easy, love.” Castiel squeezes his knee. “It takes a lot to adopt someone. But I know that Daddio loves being your father, legal or not. He loves you both to the moon and back.”
“Oh, fuck, Cas,” Dean moans as Cas’ tongue flutters around his hole. “That’s—that’s fuckin’ awesome, been so long…so good...” He pants as Cas hums along his skin, giving him the extra sensation that he knows he enjoys himself (thank you, vibrating toy).
Cas presses his forehead to Dean’s—they breathe as one, in, out, in, out. When he speaks, his voice is quiet and vulnerable. “I’m giving you one chance to take that back. Otherwise, you’re stuck with me, and all that comes with me, because I love you. I love you.”
“Same here. Hey, look at us, getting better at this communication thing. In three years, we might actually have the hang of it.”
Cas swallows his last bite of breakfast, though he’s far from hungry now. “Walk with me to class?” he asks.
I’ve never written Sam/Gabe and never planned to, but my story said differently, so here they are. 😂
“Drove me crazy seeing you shirtless. Drove me just as crazy seeing you button this thing up.” He flicks each button out of its hole deftly with one hand.
“I doubt it. I didn’t get that feeling, you know? It was more ‘I was concerned because I didn’t like it’ rather than ‘I was concerned because I thought something was happening to you.’”
“Quite hard, I bet,” Ana Jo smirks as she peers pointedly toward his crotch. Charlie slaps her hand in a high five.
He told Cas that after those two painful days, when they were pretending to make the decision to date. Only Dean wasn’t pretending his feelings and thoughts on the matter. Not at all. “We could,” he agrees.
Castiel nods, though he’s a bit puzzled. He’s interrupted in his scrutiny of the man when his brother asks, “Is Dean here?”
they’ve claimed, though Cas has his suspicions) or because they mutually decided they needed to look a little more flushed and ruffled than usual. Cas hasn’t minded one bit, except that it’s completely awful when it’s not completely blissful. He vacillates between taking Charlie’s advice to “enjoy it and don’t get freaked out” and completely freaking out, because when he enjoys it, it begins to feel real, and when it feels real, there’s a danger that it’ll become real, and that...well, that can’t happen, of course.
As he talks, he forgets to try to impress them with who he is, because what he does is so damn cool that it speaks for itself. How many people can say they designed and built some of the tech that people use in their homes and businesses every day, stuff that people say they couldn’t live without? Not many. He’s so damn lucky, and he knows it. Soon he’s telling funny stories and going waaaay off script, but he’s still telling them exactly what he meant to, just in his own way. He answers questions with ease, thank God, and he gets a standing ovation when he’s done. When he sees Cas in the audience, he’s smiling from ear to ear and he looks so proud. Cas’ regard for him is overwhelming sometimes, but it’s the best kind of overwhelming, the kind that stops time and makes his heart vibrate with joy.
He’s never seen Dean move so fast. He watches on the security monitors as Dean races to the front, checks around, then grabs the lube and dashes back to him. Castiel laughs as Dean bursts through the door.
“Well, I was kinda hopin’ you still needed me. Wanted me. Just like I need you. Want you. You and Matt.”
He posted his content this morning, a couple of days after the incident at the store. This ensured that people saw the shitty media sensationalism first (which Charlie said was good) and also that he was posting on a day when most people would see it. She said that the juxtaposition between what they were showing and what Castiel was showing would be eye-opening.
It’s revealed to them a few minutes later as Cas plays “Despacito” (a little inside joke between Cas and some of his Stanford students, he told Dean) on his phone and makes them dance to it. Cas always has his guests on his show dance before they get into things, to “loosen them up” and remind them to never get too comfortable, to take risks in life and in their work. He calls Dean over to him and they dance—nothing dirty, because they’re professionals, damn it—and laugh their asses off. Their enthusiasm is infectious, and the reluctant scientists soon join in.
They’ve been roommates since sophomore year, meeting in their freshman year and becoming the best of friends almost immediately. Dean was instantly smitten by the blue-eyed shy guy—in a totally bromantic way at first, but later, not so much. He wishes he hadn’t been such a chicken shit and at least tried to tell him that he was interested, but by the time they both got their shit together and Dean felt ready to take a chance (a big leap, considering his own shit and his own little rule he’s struggled with since knowing Cas), the Grayson thing happened, which made him swear off dating friends. He’s been harboring a major crush ever since. Probably more than a crush, but he tries not to dwell on that. Dwelling makes it significant, and real, and more painful.
he tells himself with a chuckle. It’s something he would say to his students. He settles in to learn.
to come home. Part of it was ‘cause I have a hard time saying no to friends, you know that. But really, Cas? I wanted you to ask me or tell me to come home because I wanted to know
“Oh!” she cries with a surprised laugh. “Wow, not only was I barking up the wrong tree, I was in the wrong forest.”
“Breakfast,” Cas mutters, hoping to divert this train from a fiery collision. It works, thankfully, Dean sitting and Crowley wiggling his fingers as he leaves.
Claire thinks about all she knows about Dean, the man she’s called “Daddio” for years. When she felt like she wanted to call him Dad instead of Dean, she wanted to come up with a special name for him, and since her Uncle Gabe always called him “Deano,” she came up with “Daddio.” Completely stupid, but he teared up when she said it the first time and he loves it and won’t let her change it. (The hurt look on his face when she tried once was enough to make her stop.) He’s been in her life since she was small—she doesn’t remember her life without him, really—and he’s been just as much of a parent as her own biological father. He’s been at her games, at her parent-teacher conferences, at her concerts. He was there for her when she broke her wrist, when her gerbil Bill died, when all her friends ditched her at the start of middle school. He took on a family willingly, knowing he wouldn’t just be with her dad, but with her and her brother, too, who was a real pain in the ass when he was a baby (not much has changed there, in her opinion). He’s been with them for years, and he talks about the future like he’s going to be there. She can rely on him, unlike Zoe. And yeah, the mom thing hurts, but that’s a different issue.
Charlie pipes up. “That’s pretty generous, Ana. I think they’d have to get married, have kids, and celebrate their fiftieth anniversary before he’d be like, ‘Yeah, okay, I guess he likes me.’”
“Uh oh, I’m right twice in a day,” Dean teases. “Soup’s all put together; I’m just warming it up along with some bread. You mind if I feed him so you can rest?” He hesitates, then adds, “Unless you wanna—”
“Oh, good,” Ruth smiles, pleased. “Now, since it’s Christmas in July you’re celebrating, we do have some theme ornaments. We have seashells, parrots, clear balls with sand in them, surfing Santas—”
Cas guides him to his room. Despite his floppy limbs, he manages to get Dean’s shoes, socks, and pants off him, leaving him in boxers and a t-shirt, which is good enough. He makes him drink more water and take some medicine, then gently lowers him—or tries to, but his landing is more of a heavy
Dean snorts inelegantly, leaning his head on Cas’ shoulder. “Stop making me laugh! This is serious business; we’re supposed to be hot for each other.”
“Great.” He swiped a hand over his face. “Why do we have to save everyone else while we lose everything, huh?”
“You do,” Cas says. He feels him scoot close and kiss his cheek. “Love you, honey pie. Good night,” Cas murmurs before he rolls over.
. If he thought he felt better before, it’s nothing compared to what he feels as he swings the Impala’s door open. The fire, unbearable moments ago, is more like a low flame than a raging inferno now. He sits, gripping the steering wheel as he breathes in the scents of Baby and rain.
“Uh huh. Tell me about yourself, Miguel Raphael.” He tries to keep a straight face at Dean’s antics, but a smile breaks through anyway. Dean catches it and grins, pleased with himself.
“You, your family, you’re all successful, you know? You’re used to a certain lifestyle. I wanted to make sure I could give it to you.”
be wasted after his second beer. Garth doesn’t seem to mind their laughter, though; he’s comfortable with who he is. Dean casts a glance around the table. It feels good to be with them, to be
“I’m very excited for you, and very jealous,” Chuck chimes in, changing the focus of the conversation. Dean’s certain it’s not on purpose—he loves his father-in-law, but the man is not that smooth—yet he appreciates the change, anyway.
Cas rolls his eyes and bites his tongue, hard. “Let’s just get this done, okay?” He turns to the hotel staff. “Lo siento. Estamos muy cansados.”
), and asks about going out later to pick up a couple of things for her locker. Dean also takes a bit of good-natured ribbing from her, teasing him about how he’s “famous” at school now because the video she posted on YouTube from Father’s Day has thousands of views. He’s a little embarrassed about his blubbering, but he’s not sorry for it.
Dean chuckles at his own statement as he nudges Jilly, who smiles uncertainly. Cas chuckles, too, knowing the statement is far from the truth. Dean is one of the brightest people he’s ever met. Usually, he’d call Dean on that sort of statement, but he’s fairly certain he’s only saying it to keep Jilly on their side, and he moves on too quickly, anyway.
Dean growls as he grips Castiel’s hips. The kiss he tugs him into is hot and dominating, his man’s love poured into it but also his fear, his frustration, his trust.
Cas might want to talk to him about privately. “Oh,” he said, his breathy voice betraying his nerves.
Cas is already at the bar when Dean arrives, so he takes a minute to watch him. He’s dressed in a white polo shirt and navy blue chinos and sneakers, his standard work attire. The pants are a slim fit and hug his thighs tighter than Dean does when Cas is fucking him from behind. “Calm down, buddy,” he tells his dick quietly.
He gets into the mindset of the horny pizza man who knows just what he’s getting into when he goes to visit the hot guy who’s well-known for knocking boots with his delivery people. Or his delivery
“Yeah.” He sips at his whiskey. “He never went back to the store, except to help me out here and there. Like I said, I think it was a wake-up call for him, and he was relieved to step back.”
Cas hummed in agreement, then said, “Well, if you want to sing ‘O Come All Ye Faithful’ like Carol Brady, maybe we can get a Christmas miracle. It’s a little late, but what the hell.”
“Grab a seat,” Dean directs him as he spoons one more bite into Matthew’s mouth. “Beer’s right there, and the sub rolls are—” The timer dings. “Ready,” he grins.
Between the siren, his team, and the storm raging around them, Dean couldn’t hear Cas anymore. “Cas? I can’t hear you but listen, listen man, I’m here, okay? Keep talking. Talk to me.”
Dean shakes his head. “Shut up,” he growls, a slight flush creeping into his cheeks that he would surely blame on adrenaline.
Lupine Cove Market and Deli will be busy today, with the three to six inches of snow they’re expecting this afternoon and into the night. There are standard grocery stores, of course, and most people will go to those if they need a lot. But for just a handful of things, they’ll come to him. It’s convenient for those who live nearby, he tries to keep his prices reasonable, and townspeople are all about supporting their own when they can, especially off-season. He appreciates it. And now, of course, Matthew is there. He swears business has picked up just because the baby is behind the counter. People come through to talk to him or just to get a little peek. Matthew doesn’t mind some cuddles, either, so some of the regulars get to hold him once in a while.
“And I you, good lady, and all of the people of the kingdom,” he smiles, taking her hand and bowing gallantly.
“Here are your Italians, guys,” Castiel says above the baby’s screeching as he slips them into a long, narrow paper bag.
The goodbye to Jilly and Harry is much tearier than anyone expected. “You boys come back around and visit if you’re in the area,” Jilly demands. They promise they will. Sam will be starting college at their alma mater, and Charlie and Jo will still be there for graduate school—but even if they weren’t, they’d make a special stop anyway. They say goodbye to Mr. Noodle, Vaughn’s ferret, while they’re there. Jilly and Harry hadn’t been happy that Vaughn got a pet, but when he moved out, they took the ferret and he’s been their office mascot ever since, getting a proper name, all the chicken he wants, and way more attention than he got from Vaughn. They leave with one final hug for Jilly and Harry, then drive away wistfully, leaving their first apartment behind.
“Oookay.” Cas arches a brow at him before shifting his attention back to their landlords. “Well, anyway, thank you so much. We do appreciate it.”
“Oh, fuck…” Dean moans breathlessly. “Um, because I’m honest, and caring, and loyal, and confident, usually, and I try hard to overcome my fears, and my soul is bright, and because you feel a profound bond with me that you’ve never felt with anyone.”
pretty soon. He tries not to imagine himself and Matthew moving in with his parents once they return. Or his brother, who’s been supportive but strangely quiet recently. Then he imagines he might move alone to his parents’ or brother’s place, because Charlie would have to take Matthew away from him, and
Only because the man is his boyfriend’s father, Castiel opens the door and admits them. He sees the distaste on both the men’s faces as they look around. It’s not up to their standard, clearly. They sit at the kitchen table.
Jesse nodded, his mouth twisting into a frown. “Shit’s gonna move. Between the crew moving stuff and the wind, he’s probably gonna hear a lot.”
Cas spends his time considering how to bring up their roleplays, or maybe the things that Lee said last night, then decides he needs to put his shit aside for a minute (because it’s totally his shit, he owns that) and check in with Dean about the fight.
Dean’s face flames red. He blushes so easily. It’s completely endearing—as if his friend needs to be
Castiel rolls his eyes. He’s exhausted, Matthew’s exhausted, and it probably isn’t worth the cost to stay open for the few sales they might get. “It’s getting deeper, all right,” he mutters under his breath before he capitulates. “Fine. I’m closing. Are you happy?”
of your bodily fluids on me. So a little snot isn’t scaring me away.” Cas nods, but still turns away and swipes at his nose. Dean can tell he’s embarrassed, and he isn’t having it. He grabs Cas’ face and rubs it all over his, tears and whatever else streaking across it.
Cas doesn’t answer his question, saying instead, “Well, for your inconsiderateness, you’re buying my first drink.”
“Looks like. I’m sure they’d like to get out of here. I’ll go pay the bill. Be right back.” He ruffled the crown of Castiel’s head as he passed by. The feeling of his fingers in his hair made him want to tell him. Everything about this weekend made him want to tell him. But the bravado he’d had two weeks ago had been replaced with sensibility. Why ruin what they have? Particularly now, when Dean finally seemed like he was settling into something good at work?
“Not the biting. The couple stuff. Having couple friends, doing couple things, being ‘domestic’. I was afraid of it for a long time, but...I really do love it, even if I’m still breaking in this new me, you know?”
It’s been a while since he’s had a day off (not counting that time he was sick), and even longer since he had a weekend off. And hell, he doesn’t want to think about how long it’s been since he had an entire
It ended on a happy (if nervous) note, though and it seems they're going to get a taste of vanilla after all. They'll get started on that in the next chapter.
—but Dean whispers “Please” and his anxiety dissipates. He strokes a finger between his cheeks to his hole.
A family tree, worn with age and use, is tucked into the back of this journal, and Cas takes a moment to pull it out and open it. It illustrates five generations of his family, ending with him and his cousins. The same genetic difference (
Cas turned and pecked the top of his head. “We’ll learn together. And we’ll have more happy surprise endings in heaven, as well, if you like.”
“Ten, fifteen minutes in the car? That’s not worth it, Dean. You have to be away again in a few days, and you just got home from back-to-back trips to Milan and Paris. Fashion Weeks are draining for you. You need your rest.”
When Castiel gets home later, hands full of Chinese take-out, Dean greets him at the door, takes the bags, turns him around, and pushes him right back to Dean’s truck, which is already running and is cool inside.
Despite the seriousness of the moment, Dean teases, “No promises.” He grins and thumbs at Cas’ face to take the edge off the joke.
Recognizing that his usual approach to trauma—dark humor—wasn’t going to fly this time around, he backed off. “Yeah, sorry, man. I’ll drive.”
“A lot,” Dean answered. He drew away slowly from Cas, then clapped Sam on the shoulder. “But none of us are gonna miss anything else. Let’s go home.”
“Yeah, we’re adorable,” Dean agrees, chewing on his bacon strip. He shows his chewed-up food to Sam, who groans in disgust and aims a piece of honeydew melon at his nose. Mary scolds her sons, and Cas and Sarah look at each other and shake their heads fondly.
“Uh, yeah, I’m gonna have what that guy’s having,” Dean says, nudging his head toward where their usual server is chatting with a guy in an expensive suit and handing him a slice of pie a la mode. Said guy in expensive suit is giving the server heart eyes.
For a moment, all Cas can do is stare. Then, wordlessly, he moves behind Dean’s chair and unties his hands, then steps in front of Dean. He searches his face. “You are free,” he says thickly.
Some much-needed sweetness for our boys (even though they’re apart) and all of us (even though we’re apart). Wishing all of you and yours good health and stability as we move through this time that is challenging for all of us. ❤️
talk a little more about their fears. But not much. Because they’re too busy enjoying each other to really have them.
Cas rolls his eyes. Dean doesn’t understand how he’s staying so calm. “Look, I’m mad, too, but maybe it was a misunderstanding on his part? He was pretty drunk.”
A bunch of faces come onto the screen, clearly recorded from a Zoom meeting. He recognizes Charlie’s (he looked her up on the website), Ms. Hanscum’s, Ms. Blake’s, the headmaster’s, Mr. Green’s, and of course, Cas’. He looks more rumpled than usual, and a bit pale, yet he’s as gorgeous as ever.
They find their luggage at baggage claim, then rent a vehicle. Cas speaks to the desk clerk in Spanish, respectably fluent thanks to his years of knowing Gracia. Out of the corner of his eye, he notices Dean watching him, an interested heat in his eyes. Dean loves it when he speaks other languages, or even just speaks with an accent for fun. Cas turns and winks, making him blush at being caught.
Good luck to everyone watching the finale! I’ll be with you in spirit, holding your hand and squealing. 😂
Like Cas explained, touching people’s faces really isn’t something that people with blindness do commonly. It doesn’t give much information, and it’s not socially accepted practice. Like sighted people, if it’s done it is generally limited to people with whom they are close, such as intimate partners.
Tearing his attention away from the handsome, green-eyed man happily holding his baby, Castiel responds, “Yes. They’re good people.”
“Have you seen Cas?” Dean asks several of their guests. No one knows where he is. Out of options after searching the house, he calls Cas’ phone.
Castiel closes his eyes. It’s really none of his business; this is Dean’s place. But the napkins…“Why did you mess up the napkins?”
She screams as Dean chases her up the stairs. Castiel laughs, his heart fit to burst as he watches Claire and her dad have fun together. Her
It pissed him off and broke his heart all at once. He’d just wanted to make things better for Cas. That’s why he e-mailed Jilly and Harry this morning. Instead, he made things so much worse.
“I’d still like to know what the fuck that other guy was going on about,” Dean mutters. “Homophobic. What the fuck did that have to do with anything?”
“Well, it’s all...yeah, it’s fine. But don’t avoid my question. I wanna know how you feel about it. It’s not worth it if it’ll make you uncomfortable, Dean.”
“No, Dean, you go ahead. I’m going to stay in the living room and catch up on some TV shows on my laptop.”
“The first guy was in a suit, all dressed up. We were dressed like we always are, of course. Didn’t really fit into the vibe, I’m guessing, and with the way he wouldn’t stop looking at us and then lookin’ at the other guy all scowling and shit, what else could it have been?”
The last thing Dean Winchester expects as he’s unloading his groceries on a blazing hot first day of July is a dog nosing at him.
His heart swells as they chat about the happenings on Bea’s favorite TV show, one that Cas is familiar with rather intimately now since it’s been on in the house daily since they moved in last month. Things have smoothed out for Sam, his daycare is open again, and living together was getting to be too much for all of them. They could have survived, of course, but when Dean had a boyfriend with plenty of room and an invitation already extended for them to live with him? No way Dean was saying no to that, and watching his favorite guy with his favorite kid, he’s grateful he didn’t.
They spent the rest of the afternoon there, enjoying pizza and bowling and, a while later, nachos and a few games of pool. Dean was back to his exuberant self, and though Castiel wished that he’d been the one to make Dean laugh the way he was laughing now, it didn’t matter in the end. None of it mattered. So what if he didn’t get to tell him how he felt? He was happy, they were together, and that’s all Castiel really wanted.
Dean smirks at Cas’ joke while imagining how very true it might be and how very much he’d like to find out. “Shit, Cas,” he mutters for Vaughn’s benefit, though the breathiness of his voice is all Dean.
“Where the hell do you get off, sayin’ that to someone? Sit your ass down!” Harry bellows to his nephew.
“Hi, Mildred,” Castiel smiles, knowing the basket of snacks means Mildred’s granddaughter must be coming for the weekend.
“Fuck you,” Cas says, breaking into a helpless smile as he shoves Dean’s shoulder. “In my defense, this came out of nowhere! We were talking about friends and parents and tables, and then I put my foot in my mouth and you said what you said and there was
Cas hums as he makes a simple breakfast of chicken sausage patties and fruit cups. His thighs are pleasantly sore from both the lap dance he gave Dean and, later, the fucking he gave him when Dean cornered him in the guest bedroom, where he was dressing after their roleplay.
Slowly, Dean slipped the coat off Cas’ shoulders, followed by his suit jacket. He took his time with the buttons of Cas’ shirt, biting and tugging at Cas’ bottom lip with every one he popped loose. Cas watched him through hazy eyes. He allowed Dean to play with him, giving himself over to Dean’s whims. Knowing that Cas, this wavelength of celestial intent with the power to recreate heaven who raised his ass from Perdition, chose to surrender, to entrust his entire self to Dean, was a feeling more potent than the strongest drug. He craved it.
Cas Novak raises his eyes from his cards to his best friend, Dean Winchester, stunned at his statement. Their other friends seem to be, too.
“Not gonna go get your note?” Sam asks. Dean can tell he’s trying to keep it light (and failing miserably).
Dean visits the dragon at every opportunity, usually three times a week or so. Rumors of Dean courting a young lady fly about the town, and Dean lets them. The rumors about the dragon continue to fly, too, and Dean says nothing—not because he doesn’t want to, because he
When he pressed in Dean let out a long sigh, like he had waited this for so long. Cas had given him his fingers throughout the summer but never more much to Dean’s protest. He had always wanted to do it here, on his bed where it all started.
Dean didn’t know what to do about it because what Cas asked of him was too much and yet he knew they couldn’t go back to the way things were, not after those kinds of declarations. He really wished it never happened. That they could go back in time and live in denial till they were out of Purgatory.
Castiel checks his post after work. It’s been a good day, lectures were good, seminars were good, even Naomi wasn’t as painful as she usually could be and he’s on top of his work load for once this semester. He’s looking forward to getting back to his mid-week routine of a book and laundry.
Cas opened it. He looked good, really good, in a loose white t-shirt, jeans and some more of his trademark striped socks. By the looks of his strung-out hair he’d just showered. Not the only one wanting to make somewhat of an impression.
He takes payment for a chocolate swirled brioche loaf and half a dozen caramel apple filled croissants. Gabriel deals with the customers, he’s entertaining and energetic. They all love him, laugh at his jokes and give in when he suggests they buy something else. He hands out free samples to the kids too and flirts with the parents. Castiel enjoys the show too much that he misses a customer talking to him.
“Shit Cas,” Dean grunted, hips bucking a little under his touch. He couldn’t move much with the weight of Cas in his lap and Cas enjoyed that. Smirking at Dean’s failed attempts to fuck into his hand. He let his head roll back to revel in the touch and pace Cas was hell bent on setting. Slow and steady, like the Russian was trying to memorise every twitch or move Dean made depending on what he did. Cas pressed his thumb into his slit.
A kick to his shoe startled him. He looked up from the book to see his brother towering over him with a bunch of books in his hands.
“Oh, he’s got jokes ladies and gentlemen,” Gabriel looks around pretending there is an audience. Castiel wasn’t attempting to be funny. When he tries, he fails, when he doesn’t try, he succeeds. Gabriel grabs a cookie and grimaces at that too. He isn’t a fan of dark chocolate, again not enough sugar in it for him.
Dean grew restless, pulling at the label of his beer and channel hopping, not really taking anything in, just flashes of images. A thousand channels and nothing on, nothing that he wanted. He knew what he wanted. Unfortunately, what he wanted was late.
Dean reacted like any prag would, leaned into Cas some more, let his head nudge Cas’ shoulder, like a cat looking for more affection. He was ready for the next one. This time above his brow, over his woolen hat. He let himself enjoy that one, his insides warming up from the display of affection. A genuine smile found its place on his face.
The urge to peek through his window to get a look at his new neighbor is there but he resists. Castiel refuses to leave his bed this early on a Sunday. He closes his eyes once again in the hopes of going back to sleep. The guy is humming a song loud enough for Castiel to hear. It relaxes him enough to dose off for another couple of hours.
Cas still looked confused and in need of further explaining, not that Dean could give him one. “I don’t know man. It’s just an expression people use.”
.” his brother explained. He was right. He couldn’t react. Dean ran his hands through his hair, got his breath back and regained himself. Sam let go and they walked on ahead in the queue. Everyone in this damn queue just saw that guy get away with slapping Dean on the ass. That was going to spread like wild fire. That was going to get back to Alastair.
Dean’s arm went around Cas’ middle and his breath got caught in his throat when he felt Dean’s lips on the shell of his ear again. “Yeah but not as much fun though, right Cas?”
Rufus was from Folk Nation but he and Bobby went way back. He was in here for as long as Bobby was, if not longer. Dean can’t recall exactly. Assault and battery charge it was in the end. He was a gang member when it suited him, he was big into it when he was younger, now he took more of a back-seat role.
Dean needed to make this count, needed to make a statement. He looked in the crowd searching. “Him,” Dean pointed to Cas who had joined the group. “He gave the order.”
Benny was actually good fun. He had a beer waiting for Dean at the bar, kissed his cheek when he greeted him, and they started talking like they’d known each other for a few years. It was easy and Dean fell back into flirty banter as if he hadn’t left it, turned out it was like riding a bike. A few winks and compliments between them and Dean got his swagger back.
He didn’t need fifteen minutes. He didn’t even need ten. Cas gave him one hell of a bone shattering blow job. It was full of filth and skill and Cas’ mouth was so hot and his tongue so attentive and Cas didn’t have a gag reflex and took Dean so deep in his throat that Dean saw stars on the ceiling. Dean kept his hands embedded in Cas’ mass of darkness, pulling, pushing and tugging on the strands as he sang Cas’ name over and over and over. He came with a cry, loud enough because there was no one around that would hear him and Cas ate him up.
“You know it.” She smiles. He gets himself off the ground, dusts himself off and kisses Jess on the cheek to say hello. He turns and gives his brother a dead arm. Sam winces in pain gripping his arm where Dean gave him the punch. Jess and Benny laugh.
“I am capable of keeping my hands to myself Dean,” he replied with a slight smile, rather enjoying Dean’s newfound ease on the subject. “You’ve sated me enough, for now.”
“Maybe.” He lets a small smile out careful not to give straight answers even if straight answers were Castiel’s default. Dean sighs and grabs his keys for his front door. Castiel walks back to his opened apartment door with Dean in tow. Step one, getting Dean out of his apartment and into his, complete.
He felt a cold hand on his thigh. Dean snapped his head back, hand immediately grabbing Cas’ wrist before it got any further up his leg. His other hand in a fist ready to use it.
“Cas,” He attempted to mimic the Russian accent and failed. Dean flicked through the pages, all in Russian. Go figure. He handed the book back. “What is it? Recipe book?”
He opened up a new tab, looking for a secondhand couch to distract his body from getting aroused. His phone buzzed on the bed beside him.
Charlie was more than elated to be spending some time at her uncle Sam’s place. He kept it a surprise till he showed up for the Fete. Well, more like he was still debating on whether he was going to go through with the date or not. Cas had reminded him at the Fete enough times, like he could forget. It’s all he’d been able to think about since Saturday.
“Yeah buddy?” Dean came into view, standing in the doorframe to his room. He looked soft, hair unstyled, worn out plaid pajama bottoms and a loose top. His glasses perched on his nose. Dean tended to write his sociology essays buzzed. His professor even suggested it, apparently alcohol opened up facets of his mind to the wonders of Durkheim and Marx. Cas hoped it also opened his mind to what he was about to ask,
Dean took a sip of his beer, focusing on the bubbles in his mouth rather than the swell of emotion he always got whenever Sam said something about his daughter. Sam never minced his words. The sincere one out of the two of them. If Sam thought Charlie would be alright, Dean believed him. “It’s like you’re in my mind sometimes Sammy, I swear.”
Cas and Claire walked over from their house instead of driving out of safety. When Dean opened the door, Claire bolted in seeing her best friend who she hadn’t seen in four days, the longest they’d been apart since the beginning of pre-school.
“Because everyone’s been talking about you, your ears are burning,” Dean pushed the letter away from him done with it for now. He shuffled the chair back so he could put his feet up on the desk in front of him to relax. All he’s missing is a nice cold beer and some classic rock.
He turned his head into Dean’s palm, kissed it sweet. Kisses he had been getting through-out the day whenever Cas felt like giving them. “You are, now sleep.”
Castiel has done enough of talking to strangers for one day. Deciding to grab his headphones, play an old audiobook of his to help drown out the music, it works. He eats the cookies and gives himself a food coma from it. Just about managing to crawl into his bed across the room and drifting off to sleep.
“I can’t kick Bobby, but you can be sure as hell I can kick you Sam.” he shouts. That’s definitely going to leave a bruise now.
He expected Dean to appear more startled than what he saw. His friend’s eyes widened, mouth parted a fraction, but he didn’t immediately tell Cas to shut up or go to hell. He paused, giving it thought.
Cas returned to his laptop, closing down windows and opening up his camera. He positioned it to catch the edge of the bed then moved his side lamp to angle it towards Dean. He moved past Dean to get the main light turning it off to let their usual aesthetic take hold. It set the tone, Dean’s body getting that shiver he got when he knew something good was coming. No fear or worries on him, just pure desire and need for Cas.
At least when it came, he’d do it in here. At least in the Empty no one would see him sweat, no one would see him cry. No one would see him again, period.
He could tell his brother meant that. If his brother found some shred of something decent in Purgatory, who was he to deny that from him, even if it meant his brother was no longer technically a free man. He was owned. That changed things, changed their dynamic.
Zachariah chuckled enjoying this mute Dean that wasn’t going to react to being provoked even if his blood was starting to boil.
He lay down on Cas’ body, chest to chest he enveloped himself over the Russian, head resting on one of the stars. Cas brought up the blanket, encased them in it. Warm hands roamed around the skin they could reach, across his shoulder blades, down his arms, over his thigh. One permanently in Dean’s hair though, where it needed to be. He let his breath out, slow and shaky. This was real. He wasn’t dreaming.
Gordon laughed, distracted by the presence of Sam now in the room. “Oh Sam, storming in here, unarmed and alone. Not a very smart move.”
He tried not to pay too much attention to how the delivery driver was talking to Balthazar like he knew him or that Cas had embraced the driver when he came out to see how the unloading was getting along. His curiosity got the better of him when the same thing occurred when the next truck rolled up.
“That’s coming out of your wages Kev!” Gabriel tells him. Kevin shrugs and slides the tray over to Castiel to eat. He likes Kevin. He has his book, cup of coffee, his cookies, and is hiding from all things Dean. That doesn’t seem to stop him thinking about how he his neighbor happens to be equal parts immature, beautiful, charming and insufferable.
Twenty minutes later and they’ve set up similar to before, dimly lit from the laptop screen though this time they’ve added the light from Dean’s room too, just slightly ajar. It added another dimension apparently, whatever the hell that meant. He let Cas do this thing and didn’t ask questions. All Dean had to do was be loud, oh and cum again, can’t forget the cumming. They had a couple of whiskeys as they went along too, wanting to keep their level of intoxication intact.
He pleaded with Cas, coaxing the man to put his hand back under his top, to touch his skin and take Gordon away from him. He stripped his coat and top, showing Cas his wounds.
He climbed up onto his bunk, grateful for the mattress, even more grateful for the blanket and pillow. He never thought he’d be grateful for being in Purgatory but compared to the nothingness in the Empty this place was the Four Seasons. Dean snuggled himself into his blanket, nestled his head into his pillow and sighed.
His mouth ghosted the shell of Dean’s ear, voice laced in his own arousal. “I want to hear you say it Dean.”
“Any girls catching your eye this year?” his Mom asked. Dean nearly spat out his drink, careful to swallow and not choke too hard at the question. He ignored any looks towards Cas as he shook his head.
The words ringing in his mind still. He had been so used to be needed, his Dad needed him, Sam needed him, Bobby and Ellen, they needed him. It never occurred to him that maybe they just wanted him around too. That he was more than what he did for them. So, he called up Sam, asked him to find him a place dirt cheap. Called Bobby asking for his job back at the auto-shop and called Ellen asking for his job back at the Roadhouse too. That was two weeks ago now.
Dean kicks the ground, churning up dirt that rest on his boots. He groans into his hands then screams into the air because there is not much else, he can do. This boy. This boy would be the end of him one day, he’s sure of it.
I have epilogue to come, just to wrap some loose ends up but hope you've enjoyed my love tale of Dean and Cas in prison <3
When Cas pushed his way back into Dean, he let the moan vibrate out of his body into their cell. Any brick that was still standing up right inside of him crumbled away to dust. The more Cas fucked him, the louder he got, wanted to show Cas how much he loved this. He could feel Cas watching him in almost awe, never leaving Dean’s blissed out face.
They started picking out the weeds from the cracks, then were supervised with weed killer to get the moss on the sides and the last part, scrubbing with soap and buckets of water and tough brushes to remove the bird crap and whatever else roads had on them. What he’d give for a power washer right now.
“Awh, c’mon Anna. Not in the mood for some OA? Orphans anonymous. We can compare notes on how much abuse we endured, it’ll be fun then we can head back to mine and inhale raw cookie dough batter till we puke. A typical Friday night in my books.”
“Cas.” He gasps hand gripping his heart. Castiel seems to have gotten himself into a habit of scaring Dean. He’s not in overalls this time, already changed back into his day clothes but he has been at work. Dean’s got a smudge on his neck running up behind his ear. His hands haven’t been cleaned properly.
“Can I? Can I? Can I?” Claire bounced around her Dad. The sass had been replaced by one hundred percent pure four-year-old excitement. Kids were like switches.
Dean tried to go in with some sort of speed then realised Cas wasn’t built like a girl and he slowed his pace down, edging his way in bit by bit with shallowed breathes that fluttered Cas’ eyelashes till he bottomed out then paused.
him, teachers hated him, and Cas found his stereotypical muscle car and rock n roll persona all too much. He was a walking cliché. When Dean heard the footsteps, he turned around and their eyes met.
“Me too Cas,” he admitted. “I tried to forget about it, forget about you, went on a date with a woman just to forget but…”
They walk back in silence, a comfortable distance apart. Some students greet Castiel as he walks, some faculty members too. The English building is grand and old. Dean gapes as it as they walk into the main entrance. He stops walking, assuming Dean will leave now.
“Yeah, well if you get these damn pajamas on I can burrito you with that duvet of yours.” He throws the top over Cas’ face. Cas pulls it off, suddenly alert.
Dean closed his eyes, turned his head away from him. Alastair grabbed Dean’s chin, forced him back and pulled his face up.
Summer had been everything Cas had wanted and more. Beautiful sights to take photographs, at least half of them of Dean if he were being honest. A muse of green eyes, tanned skin and darkened freckles from the sun. The days spent near water were his personal favourite. He had more photos to develop than he knew what to do with.
He responded almost immediately, brain going a little dizzy as Dean kissed him with such desire he wasn't sure how he'd make it through the rest of the day. Similar to New Orleans there were shouts and cheers from onlookers. They broke away from each other to turn their heads to see Jo and Ash standing there with wide smiles and Meg with a sly knowing look. Dean didn't make an attempt to move away so Cas stayed put, trying to capture this moment like a photograph.
“Castiel.” Wow, what a name. Before Dean says anything else the guy is in his flat with the door closed behind him. What an asshole. A stupidly attractive asshole but an asshole non the less. Dean sighs, eventually finds his keys and makes it to the Roadhouse just on time for rush hour.
“Did I stutter Winchester?” Dean was about to flick over the card from the deck in his hand when Cas came down the wrought iron stairs and onto the ground floor. He was pulled away from the game while he watched Cas walk through the mass of people. Some people moved, some didn’t seem him till he was nearly on top of them and spurted out a million apologies. It was like he was Moses and the sea parted for him. That power radiated from him and it was felt by everyone around. It didn’t take long for Cas eyes to meet his.
“Work with me here.” Dean huffs as he shimmies Cas’ jeans down, taking his socks with him. Cas grumbles again, this time he hears it.
to the end of that sentence. That night hadn’t been spoken about it since it happened. They went back to their normal lives though admittedly Dean found himself unable to stay in Cas’ room for longer than five minutes before his mind started to wander. That was inside Dean, on the outside he was cool as a cucumber.
“Dean Winchester alone at last,” The twang of a southern accent rang in his ears. Dean turned quick, met with the face of Alastair staring back at him, eyes wide, grin big. There were two others on either side of him with equally crazed looks in their eyes.
“Sorry, I—” Cas began to explain or rather lie. The truth would ruin this. How could Cas explain that he found himself completely overcome with a desire for Dean no one had yet to rival? That in this moment all he cared about was taking care of Dean. It would be too much for anyone, let alone his straight best friend giving his first blowjob. Unexpectedly Dean’ hand took Cas’ wrist, lifting it up to place his hand in Dean’s hair. “Are you sure?” he asked.
It’s not as weird being back in his home town as he thought it would be. Dean had spent the better part of the last five years avoiding it like the plague only coming home for Sammy’s birthday and the holidays. Now he was back, moved into his own place, working the same two jobs he did growing up and it feels like he never left.
“Whatever you say little brother. I gotta go. I’m an oiled-up mess and need to shower or else Ellen will spray me down out back before letting me serve customers, catch you later.”
She started to jab him in his side, knowing he was ticklish, and he put her down to stop the onslaught. Dean got down to her level, trying to contain her excitement. He needed to check his emails before committing to anything.
Dean is still, dry mouth parted in a state of slight shock. His hand holding where Castiel has pinched him under his flannelled shirt.
“Fuck that’s good.” He exhales. His voice wrecked. Dean has fists of Cas jet black hair in his hands and he’s torn between pushing them further into his neck or pulling him back to feel that tongue in his mouth again. So many decisions…
“Don’t worry Dean, I won’t write you up.” Cas replied with a slight upturn of his mouth. That made Dean chuckle and warm his insides for other reasons. He nudged his shoulder into the Russian. A silence fell between them, it wasn’t awkward which Dean liked. Their sides touched from shoulder to knee, feet swinging beneath them as they shared the cigarette.
Friday Dean had made last minute plans to bring Charlie to Amelia’s work to see the animals. She had been ecstatic giving him good Dad points and he was again glad for the less time around Cas as he was still getting over the whole
Drunken Cas in a lift is no fun but he manages it. He also manages getting the keys from Cas’ pocket, careful to avoid making this sexual as Cas is too drunk to even understand the word of consent. With the total weight of the man nearly on Dean he switches on the lights to Cas’ apartment and makes a beeline for the bed to drop him on. He lands on it, unscathed and Dean can breathe again.
Bobby looked around, careful again for no ears listening in. Snitches got stitches even Bobby wasn’t immune to that way of prison world.
When he’s sure the smudge is gone and can no longer justify touching Dean in that way, he takes his thumb back. Dean’s wide eyed and staring at Castiel like he isn’t quite sure what quite what just happened and Castiel isn’t quite sure he can answer it anyway. The lift door opens. They don’t seem to notice, trapped in the air of what has unfolded between them.
The next exam coming up had Dean more anxious than usual, no amount of porn seemed to be helping him. What he’d give to have Cas hold him down, pull an orgasm out of him and then for Dean to repay the favour would be everything right about now. He’d do it without the alcohol at this stage he was jonesing that bad for it. Dean sat at his desk, drumming his fingers on his laptop. The article he had been reading for the past hour still on the screen.
Dean saddled up beside his locker the following week, he held the strap of his bag tight on his shoulder.
Dean nodded, words escaping him, but he did as Cas said. He let him in, muscles relaxing, and the last push had Cas snug inside of Dean.
“Charlie! Dammit.” he ran up after her. He was too late. Cas had already opened the door and she swooped in under his arm.
Sam spotted Dean. He stood up off the bench and walked towards his brother. Sam didn’t stop walking till he ran his body into Dean’s, winding him a little.
Dean managed to get through work detail, lunch and lock in (without Cas) without someone mentioning his Dad. At yard-time there were murmurs, whispers that he could over hear. He tried to drown them out, cigarette after cigarette chain smoking to get as much nicotine in him as possible to get him through till the end of the day.
“You’re out!” Sam said. He took his hands from his pocket to embrace his brother in a hug. Dean was glad his brother was still in one piece, no bruises, no cuts, nothing. A relief. He hated being down in the Empty, meant he didn’t get to keep an eye on his little brother, not that he probably needed much minding, towering over most of the people in here.
He did. Sam ringing him up in the middle of the night, telling him he’d just ran over a dog. Dean had been more concerned about the state of Baby than the animal that his brother hit. The following days Sam had been going to check up on the dog, though Dean soon coped on that he was also checking up on the hot vet that was in there.
Once returned he grabbed a tissue and wiped himself up. Now, he had a choice to make, either acknowledge what happened and have to deal with the fact that he essentially had slightly submissive phone sex with his daughter’s best friend’s Dad or brush over it like it was nothing and just act casual, like it was no big deal. Given that he was going to have to see this man tomorrow in the playground he went for the latter.
“Winchester.” A guard called out. Sam stepped away. He ran his hand over his hair that had fallen from behind his ear. His brother looked worse for wear, about as bad as Dean looked if he was being honest and his brother hadn’t spent the guts of three months in the Empty. His eyes sunken into his head, bags as big as trash bags and bruises on his neck, not bruises, love bites.
Turns out he doesn’t have to, Cas’ bare foot steps leave the apartment, he thinks he’s gone, that’s it.
By the time the lights got switched off Dean was becoming a writhing mess on Cas’ bed, alternating between lifting his hips into Cas’ hands and grinded himself down into the wet patch on the mattress.
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Dean asked with slightly slurred words. He stared at anyone other than Cas, making a point to even make eye contact with Balthazar who he wasn’t a fan of. Cas was too drunk not to stare, his khaki shirt, black tee underneath, the amulet his brother got him hanging on his chest. His lips, slightly shiny, probably from the Gabriel’s drink or the girl’s lip gloss. Lips that were around Cas’ cock not even 24 hours ago.
Cas’ other hand came to rest on the left side of Dean’s chest. Dean joined him in looking at the bloodied skull hand over his pounding heart. He tried not to think about what it meant.
Sam moved closer to Dean like he was about to disclose some kind of big secret. Dean leaned in too. “They don’t speak in English with each other, it’s like a rule.”
You Really Got Me by Van Halen comes on his stereo. He sees Jess leap up from the edge of his bed where she’s sitting with, correction, where she’s on top of Sam. His brother is getting more action on his bed than he has yet, it’s not fair. She turns it up loud, about as loud as his stereo can go.
Sam got to the center of the yard when Dean noticed one of Cas’ Russians walking to the center of the yard from their table they occupied. Eyes on Sam.
“Cas,” he whispered, wanting the man in the video to hurry the fuck up already because he was going to cum any second. “Cas, c’mon push me down.” He urged, like somehow that was going to speed things up. He wanted it, needed it. That sheer strength that held him there as he came.
Balthazar, Gabriel and he had six more years without her. Some of the worst years. Anna would ask in the beginning, they would never tell. She got out and they refused to let her feel guilty about it.
“You’re not going home man,” Dean interrupted him, turning off the highway for his hometown. “My family love you and I don’t know if you’ve realised, but your family are a bunch of bible thumping douchebags.”
Dean then lifts his mug up. Their eyes meet, blue and green, like forest lands and bright skies. Nothing dark or sad in them, light daring to shine through, if they’d let it. Castiel thinks they could.
in any other way than he thought? That when Dean was around Cas, he found it hard to concentrate, and all the times Dean had been around Cas at that point he managed to be the flirty little shit he tended to be around people he wanted to bone.
“Don’t worry about it,” he swings his feet over to the edge of the bed. “Not my first time looking after a drunk.” Castiel hears his voice trail off, like a memory has entered his mind. He shakes it off quickly.  “Anyway, how about some coffee?”
Dean tries to give Cas a hand job. He’s kneeling in front of him, Cas lying back on the bed and keeping quiet, letting Dean figure it out. He’s hard, always hard when Dean has his hands on him but it’s not exactly the best he’s ever had.
Cas moved himself off of Dean, resting to the side of him with his good hand free to do what it wished. He ran it over Dean’s body gently. Ghost like touches over his chest and stomach making Dean squirm a little, so responsive to his fingers. Cas stored away spots that Dean found ticklish, that made his cock twitch, that gave him sinful whispers of moans. He took his time. Memorizing each one for a later date. He shifted his attention to under Dean’s naval, he rested his hand there, an inch from Dean’s erection and spoke,
Dean moved to straddle Cas’ hips. “What? Enjoy making out with my arm pit or—” he was cut off with a hand sliding up the back of his thigh, under his boxers and into the cleft of his ass. As quick as it got there, Cas took it away. Dean frowned. “I take it back, you’re not a good man, you’re a fucking bastard.”
“You don’t act like that around me.” Cas says quietly, like he’s so ashamed to even be having this thought because he is. He doesn’t so caring. He doesn’t do jealousy.
“Try not to move Dean, you might cut yourself.” Cas warned. There was a slight amusement in his voice, like he was enjoying this.
“And he just said he’d leave you alone? Just like that?” Bobby questioned. He knew Bobby from the outside, good friend of their Dad when they were both out of prison at the same time. Bobby wasn’t going to see the outside of this place again. Life without parole he got this time for grand theft auto with a deadly weapon. It’s his third offence. No one messed with him though, he was a vet in here, people respected that in all the gangs. Well, except the AB because they’re bat shit crazy.
Dean made a come-hither gesture with his free hand and Cas closed the gap in a hurry, crashing his lips onto Dean’s to claim him all over again. Tongue fighting its way back into his mouth, not that he needed to, Dean was handing himself over, body and soul to the Russian in this moment. They weren’t wasting any time. They’d wasted enough time tiptoeing around this for months. Cas slipped a finger between their passing tongues, coating it in spit. Dean lifted one of his legs, resting it on the bend of Cas’ arm.
Did he want to see the video? Cas must have seen the final product. Edited it to get rid of the audio and whatever else he had to do. He was good with that stuff. Part of his degree was photography meaning he knew how to work media. Dean wasn’t too sure if he wanted to see himself getting jacked off by his best friend. He had to live it sure and at the time it was weird, then turned good which was weird in itself but now time had passed he wasn’t sure if he wanted to open that up again.
“Let me help you then I’ll go.” Cas takes the keys off of Dean’s clean hand and opens the door. Cas is persistent and as much as Dean doesn’t want Cas around him, he needs help with his hand. Hospitals were not an option for Dean.
“You look good on my bed.” Cas planted a kiss to his hip bone, blatantly ignoring Dean’s erection that was lying there beside his head.
"A friend had mentioned we looked loved up..." he reached over to take Dean's hand, who took it with ease.
Cas led him upstairs. They both stripped down and crawled under the covers. Sleep consuming them as they were wrapped up in each other’s arms.
He looked over at Claire’s Dad, who had seen the whole thing. Cas had this odd expression on his face, awe or shock or amazement. Dean couldn’t place it. He could place the glassed eyes though. Cas was welling up that his daughter was letting Dean hold her. Dean smiled at him, knowing the sentiment and what it represented. She was beginning to trust him. Claire who had spent so long keeping Dean at distance, sassing him and refusing to give him an inch. The only adults she let in being her own Dads.
He watched the three of them interact. Their Russian exchanges looked friendly, it was hard to tell in their tones, Russian sounded angry to Dean no matter the tone. He based the friendliness on their body language, the smiles and laughs coming out of them. Cas less inclined to laugh though he did seem to make Balthazar and the other guy chuckle every so often.
They didn’t escape, they didn’t sneak out in the middle of the night and run away to join a circus, or a family didn’t come in looking to adopt them because who wants to adopt broken kids with broken wings like Gabriel and he were. They did their time, like a prison sentence counting down the days till release date.
“About your tattoo.” Dean wrapped the bandage around his hand, covering the tattoo on his finger, half covering the skulls head. Dean made sure its teeth were still sticking out. They seemed important.
Did he? He looked honest. Perhaps he was enjoying it, finding this as difficult as Cas did. Perhaps Cas could let himself believe it just this once. He took his friends advice and let go.
She tapped the baton on her side, clearly deciding something in her mind before gesturing her head for him to come out of the cell. He obeyed, joining her outside.
EDIT 14/11/19 - I edited the end of this because I don't actually want Cas to be nice in this fic, at least not yet.
“Language Cas.” Dean’s smile smears onto Castiel’s chest. He wants it imprinted there. He needs his mouth back though, grabs Dean’s head to bring him back to him, wiping that smile off of his face as he delves his tongue into Dean’s mouth needing to taste him, needing Dean to silence him from words he shouldn’t say. Dean distracts him, pushes his lower body into Castiel’s feeling that friction on his erection. It’s a bit rough but it’s not enough. He needs more.
All of it was for Gordon to see that Dean was his. Cas told him he’d have to act like one if he wanted Gordon to believe it. This was Cas making it believable. It felt like they went from small kisses to full on foreplay, but they needed to do it to sell it. He had to let Cas do whatever he wanted without protest and Dean had to pretend to like it.
He lay back, nestling into his pillow and lifted one of his knees up to plant it on the bed. In the corner of his eye he could just about make out Dean looking over his shoulder then moving it back, shaking it with vigor and standing up to undo his jeans. Cas turned slightly, letting himself see Dean push his jeans and boxers down in one go and Cas bit back a moan as he slid in the first finger. The combination of sight and touch had his cock hardening on his stomach.
“Did you tell him that pie he made was for me, that we shared it on your tiny couch?” he asks. Their eyes meet. Dean is angry.
Castiel is lost on what to say. His neighbor is confusing him. No, he knows what he feels. If anything, he feels too much. Dean isn’t simple, he’s contradictions that Castiel can’t pin point. He knows every protagonist, antagonist there is, where does Dean fit? He’s a kaleidoscope or a shifting tide or any number of metaphors Castiel can conjure up to explain what Dean is and it still wouldn’t do him justice.
“A little.” Cas admitted. That eased the tension in Dean’s stomach. He supposed he needed to treat this like a band aid and just rip it off.
“Watch your tone boy.” Rufus’s low and deep, slightly threatening. It would have scared Dean once upon a time but when you hear a pissed off Russian gang leader, not much scared you after that.
Dean fell back onto the end of his bed, feet still on the ground needing to be more comfortable than the back of his bedroom door. He stroked himself to full attention, looked down at his cock in his hand, saw it slide in and out of his fist with some ease from his pre-cum. It would burn a bit but fuck it, he needed to cum with Cas like yesterday.
“So tight, so beautiful…” Cas continued. Praise after praise surrounding Dean till, he was a crumbling mess not sure which way was up and which way was Cas.
He looked over at his baby brother. All 6ft 4 of him towering over most of the guys in here. That didn’t stop Dean from seeing the little kid who he pretty much raised, tried to protect, tried to keep safe and yet he still ended up in here with Dean.
He eased in more and more, Dean breaking their kisses to curse or pant only for Cas to shush him. Dean’s hands went to Cas’ face again, anchoring him in the moment or afraid that Cas would leave him, go anywhere than right here.
His strength sent a rush through Cas. He’d be able to hold Cas down, keep him down, even if Cas put him a bit of a fight. That would be everything but for now he needed to just get his hands on him, make him cum, make whatever was going on in him go away. He pressed against Dean’s chest again and this time Dean went. There was no resistance which made Cas realise this was the right idea to have.
Cas smiled against his kiss and it only pissed Dean off even more, like the fucker thought he was winning this. He wasn’t. Not this time. He let his mouth slip down, tugging Cas’ ear lobe between his teeth and taking his cock in his hand again to jack him off. His mouth hot and heavy in Cas’ ear, “Why are you pushing me?”
Cas opened up that part in his mind that he kept shut till these moments. That shadow side that enjoyed tearing others apart and keeping them contained simultaneously. He would never call himself a dom but there dom elements he enjoyed. Control being one of them. He felt it slip on him like a second skin then asked,
Now they were alone, he could talk to his brother about what happened that morning, and last night and the last couple of weeks or months depending on how far back Dean wanted to go with this. He knew his brother could tell something was off about him and that Sam had been patient all day, waiting for the right moment to bring it up or until Dean found the balls to bring it up himself. They were in sync like that, even since the last two or so years they’ve lived apart. It’s hard to break that kinda bond.
Dean nearly had to catch his breath seeing the Russian because the ink on his back was all kinds of mesmerizing. The wings spanning over his should blades, curving over his shoulders and down onto his upper arms. Each feather distinct and when he lifted his arms to run his hands through his hair it looked like he could take off right there.
“You my new celly?” he questioned the guy. The guy didn’t respond. Dean wondered if they even spoke a word of English sometimes. All they did was speak in Russian to each other and rarely spoke to anyone else. He spotted a dagger tattooed through the guy’s neck under his orange uniform.
What he wanted to do he couldn’t do here. It wouldn’t be safe, too many variables that could go wrong, not to mention the crowd of people on the other side of the door. They needed to be at home, in Cas’ bed where he could take care of Dean after it happened, wrap him up in blankets and soothe him to sleep.
He needed to play it cool for now though. “It’s nothing,” he untied his shirt to put it back on, not wanting the bruises to be on show. He’d see them later, probably touch them and jack off to them but right now the last thing he needed was people asking questions he didn’t want to answer in public.
When the sun comes down, he’s sitting with the box of cookies in his lap debating which one to try first and music starts playing from next door. Loud music, loud enough that Castiel can hear the lyrics through the walls.
The attention he was giving Cas left the Russian incapable of doing much to Dean’s cock. He could jack them both off together, something he’d done plenty of times before with strangers in motels and public bathrooms. That skill straight guys didn’t have off the bat, and Dean wasn’t about to give the game away on the first go.
“You’ve never left Charlie for a night, have you?” Cas’ voice soft and tentative. This man could see through Dean like glass sometimes. It was a miracle Dean had managed to keep his crush hidden for as long as he did. He scratched his stubble.
Sam ushered him towards the door, clearly understanding what was happening and that Dean needed to get out of here before he changed his mind. “We’ll be fine Dean now go, and you know, whatever.” He waved his hand aimlessly in Dean’s direction.
He didn’t know what it was about the guy that made his insides all gooey. Sure, he was attractive, Dean might even go as far and say hot. It was his damn sex appeal that initially caught Dean’s eye in the playground a couple of months back. His bed hair and the way his tie hung loosely around his neck that had Dean itching to grab it, pull the man into him and unchap those full lips with his tongue. Thoughts he really didn’t need to have while surrounded by a punch of kids and their parents and yet there he was, daydreaming about all the ways he could get his hands under that white shirt.
Dean runs his hands up Castiel’s arms, over his shoulders, down his spine, over his ass and down his thighs, then reverses back up till his hands cup Castiel’s face. Castiel moves his head, kissing Dean’s jawline, down his neck, behind his ear where he remembers he can get a moan from Dean and he does and it’s heavenly and filthy at the same time. He’s a world of contradictions.
He couldn’t say how long they stayed like that. Two minutes, ten, Dean lost track of time. The anger in him vanished, his body lax, he could almost go to sleep.
“Here?” he whispers in his ear before kissing it, all Castiel can do is nod because it isn’t capable of much else, Dean’s hand is on his cock and it is too much to function. He wants to say that it’s going to be over soon, that he’s going to cum in a matter of seconds, but he can’t seem to put words together because Dean is stroking his cock with such enthusiasm, he starts to feel it in his bone marrow.
He turns on his washing machine content with his victory and ability to surprise Dean as much as Dean can surprise him. Dean is still reeling in what happened though Castiel assumes Dean might be milking it, it wasn’t that bad. To ease the slight guilt that was manifesting itself in Castiel for his minor assault he hands Dean back his phone, unlocked, ready for a phone number to be typed into it.
“Not someone you give rules to Dean.” The guy had been sitting on his name the whole time and never mentioned it. Another power play, a damn good one too seeing as Dean knew next to none about this guy except, he thought Dean had a pretty mouth, whether objectively or subjectively was yet to be decided and most likely part of the Russian gang if not the head of it.
Dean heard it though, snapping his head around to see the sight before him. Cas on his back with one finger making its way inside his hole. He saw the bob of his Adam’s apple and how his green eyes widened.
Loud Russian voices carried into this cell. He got up slowly and walked to peer out of his cell to see what was going on. Cas stood in front of his men.
He kissed him again, more to stop himself from saying things that would make Dean run away from him before he even got a chance to be with him. It was sweet and slow, tongues passing and lips smacking loudly. When he broke away Dean put his hands back above his head, ready to continue.
“What?” he turns his head around and Dean’s face is there, shuffling forward to close the space between them.
Dean was waiting outside his cell for count. Cas hadn’t come back from the kitchen, which was worrying. Usually was in the cell already by the time Dean finished his lunch. Had expected to see him lying on his bed, book in hand as per usual. The vacant bed gave Dean a sinking feeling like something was off. The month or so he’d lived with Cas he had his schedule almost down to a T. Missing count at lunch was a glitch in that schedule.
“His car, he calls his car Baby.” She clarifies. There is a silence between them. Jessica smooths out her dress on her legs. “Sorry professor, I’m just not used to us talking about things not related to my work.”
The fight was over. The inmates reluctantly went back to whatever they were doing before it happened. The guards left too almost disappointed that the Russians didn’t kill each other this time.
This time when Zachariah came, he didn’t make himself small. He stood tall, chest out, chin up, squaring Zachariah in the eye.
The more he worked, the harder it was for the fantasy to stay in Dean’s mind. Every tug or twist of Cas’ hand was pulling Dean back to Cas’ bedroom, back to lying on his bed with Cas giving him a freakin’ awesome hand job. God, were hand jobs always this good? He only had one a week ago, but this…this was different. He didn’t even need to tell Cas what to do, how he liked it because Cas was doing everything Dean liked. The right amount of pressure and tentativeness, building up fast then slowing down teasing him…the camera, teasing the viewers.
This is not the situation Dean had envisioned when thinking about Cas’ head in his lap in his car. He looks down, sees Cas’ eyes closed, still breathing.
“My brother will deal with them.” he shooed Sam and Dean out of the laundry room. They went, taking it easy as Dean was still trying to find his strength again. He could hear Gabriel speaking to the others. “I suggest you take that shiv that stick it in your throat. It will be less painful than what Castiel will do to you when he finds out what you did to his property.”
“I didn’t think your eyes could get any greener Dean and yet they’re positively radiating.” Charlie pointed out. He waved his pencil in Dean’s face. Dean snatched the pencil from Charlie for being an annoying little shit. He was not jealous of his little brother and his afterglow and the new hickey growing under his jaw. Definitely not.
There was no light for him in here except for that window about as big as a shoe box. He had a bed, a flimsy mattress covered in mold spores, no covers and a toilet, no sink. The guards let him shower sometimes. Usually when the smell of him seeped through the cracks in the door they’d bring him out, shove him under the shower head and turn it on. With the drop-in temperature Dean welcomed the scorching heat of the water, savoured it as much as he could before he was thrown back into the cold.
Step four, talk to Dean. Jessica didn’t give much direction on this part, so he’s left to his own devices on how to communicate, which was not one of his strong suits. He joins Dean on looking at the floor instead of him hoping that helps.
Dean did. He told Sam everything, left out gory details that he and his brother never tended to talk about but kept in the chick flick moments knowing Sam secretly enjoyed them. The more he spoke about Cas, the brighter he felt. A fond smile found its way onto his face as he spoke about baking with him, about how Charlie anointed him Commander of Cookies, about the picture the girls drew of them all together like a family. The more he spoke, the more he realised that he had probably been gone on the man for ages. It just took him being intimate with Cas for it to be made clear for him.
He debates telling the guy to turn down the music. That would involve getting up, more importantly that would involve talking to a
Understatement, Castiel loves burritos, especially if Dean got them from the truck that illegally parks on campus and stays till security usher them away. It is tempting, he is hungry and has no more lectures till 3pm. Jessica being there is a worry for him.
“Likely to end up on a watch list,” Gabriel finishes. “Pull up a chair Dean-o and we’ll let you in on all we know about sweet little Castiel here at just the low price of a free bottle of top shelf tequila.” He wraps an arm around Cas. Dean eyes Cas gulps his drink back. If that aint of sign of hidden secrets Dean doesn’t know what is. The temptation is there, to find out more about the guy who he’s occupying too much space in his brain.
“Sammy used to be scared shitless of thunderstorms when we were kids,” Dean paused to see if the Russian was going to tell him to shut up. He didn’t, so Dean continued. “We travelled around a lot, slept in my Dad’s car most nights so thunderstorms were pretty scary when your house was effectively a tin can,” he chuckled as a memory came to the forefront of his mind. “I remember one time it was so bad we had to park the car on the side of the road, and he hid under my leather jacket the entire time. The poor sucker.”
Dean followed the three of them into the kitchen and out the back to the garden. The cold hit his face. The rest thankfully covered by his many layers. Claire let go of her Dad’s hand and ran into the inches of fresh snow. Their laughter filled the garden. The white contrasted starkly against the girl’s purple and blue snow jackets. They weren’t used to walking in the snow, let alone running in it. The pair of them stumbled, face planting into the cold white icy powder.
He started to falter, hips chaotically moving in tangent to Dean’s fist. Spots started to appear in his vision and when his orgasm hit him his phone fell from his hand, dropping to the tiles in a loud shatter. Not that he cared or noticed. Dean kept jacking them off, pushing them over the edge together. Dean biting down on his lip hard and Cas’s chest heaving, grunting at the sensation of it being pulled out of him.
The guy went for a punch this time, arm out swinging, and Cas ducked his head with ease, brought his fist up to deliver an uppercut. Dean winced at the sight of it, easily a shattered chin, few broken teeth. The guy fell back with a resounding thud, knocked off his feet. No one moved, no one dared move. Cas stepped on either side of the guy who was holding his face in pain.
When everyone is distracted I make my move on Kaitlin, nudging her mind kindly, trying to wake her up. Her mind is awake, which is good enough as I move into her dream.
When I figured that Dean wouldn't see my point of view, I left him in that small room in the middle of California. I landed back in Heaven, more specific the garden with Joshua humming a small human folk song. Looking around I sigh as memories of the original garden comes to mind, with the bright vibrant colors and bird song everywhere.
Shifting into his mind I find myself in a place of peace. Breathing in the light fog around me I toe down the long forest path to find a lake and a dock with him sitting at the end. Standing there I watch him for a moment, giving him this small sense of peace and tranquility before I am to disturb him. Part of me wants to run, to not bring him down this path that we all are barreling down with no end in sight. But I step towards him as a small smile appears making me feel something I have never felt before.
Of course Jean is right, she is always the most sane when it comes to the stuff that matters, bigger picture. Nevertheless I still can’t escape that plan that Michael has thought up that would evidently destroy the planet. At least Lucifer loved the small insignificant planet, he just didn't like the ape like creatures that occupy it. As for me, I find that I care way too much for one human and I can't quite place that emotion, something I have never felt before.
“All right.” His voice comes out halfway surprised and curious, as he goes to grab his coat. “Let me tell you something. There are two things I know for certain. One, Bert and Ernie are gay. Two, you are not gonna die a virgin. Not on my watch. Let's go.” He says walking past me out of the old house we are in.
“Of course we keep our promises.” I whisper walking closer to her as tears fall down her cheeks. “Of course you have our gratitude. You served us well. Your work is done. It's time to go home now. Your real home. You'll rest forever in the fields of the Lord. Rest now, Jean.”
“I don’t know what to do.” I whisper walking closer to the water. “I know there is a right and there is a wrong and I have a feeling I am on the wrong side of history.”
When all was said and done I watched him sleep as I lay on top of him listening to his heartbeat steadily. If I had the ability to freeze time, I would for the sole purpose of the small slice of peace that we both had gained that night. But like most things, they all must come to an end and you must face the real world.
Shifting through the old factory that has long been abandoned I find a nice hiding spot so that maybe I can connect with him and warn him. I know that I will not be able to escape them forever and I know that I will need him and his brother to protect Jean when that happens. So sitting down on a steel beam I close my eyes and concentrate on his soul as Jean begins to laugh in the back of my head, making me more pissed than anything.
Pushing her away I concentrated again on Dean’s soul, to feel the warmth of it like the sun on one shoulder. I look through the many dull souls in search of his, that oddly reminds me of the northern lights or the forest during late spring. I then find him, sleeping in some old motel bed that most likely have known many lovers from the past and Samuel laying in the bed next to him. Sitting back I watch his body take a deep breath as he rolls over onto his other side making the bed squeak under his weight.
“Yeah, well…” I shrug looking at Dean with a small smile and then back to Charles. “We're making it up as we go.”
Opening my eyes I take a deep breath as I sneak out of my hiding place as I hear flapping of wings from my right side. Without looking at my brothers I drop my sword, bringing my grace to the forefront of my mind as I feel them circling me. It's an odd sensation being hunted by Heaven, especially when I used to be the one to do the hunting and killing. All these Angels, my brothers, the ones I fought wars with are now tasked to either bring me back to Heaven or kill me. Then my closest friend, Benjamin comes forth as the other six stand back, almost like they are afraid of me.
“I don't know.” I whisper looking down to the marble ground. “But I know who does. We have to stop him, Dean, from killing Lilith.”
Placing my hands on his shoulders I looked him in the eye. “Lilith is the final seal. She dies, the end begins.”
“You need to be fixed Cassiel.” Her voice comes out clean and crisp. “It's pathetic for you to even think the humans are to be trusted.” She then turns on the drill looking at me with a sadistic smile. “Now don’t move, this is going to hurt.”
The drive was silent save for the tires on the pavement and the soft music coming from his ancient radio. For the first time in a long time I have never been so out of my element, not knowing what could happen next which puts on me on edge. I sneak a look at Dean only to see his eyes on the road with a content expression I think I have never seen from him. Looking back to the road I finally understand humans who have anxiety, not knowing and being on edge can be a little stressful.
“More private? We're inside my head.” He scoffs breaking the spell as he turns his attention to the fishing rod in his hands.
“You will find a new home with him, now go and save the world.” He says with a smile as I go to hug him close.
Quickly I start to unbutton my white blouse as I push off my shoes in the car watching him run quickly into the dark water. Stepping out of my skirt I walk on the soft sand feeling the cool air and the moonlight on my skin when I feel a cold splash of water from a laughing Dean. Smiling back I splash him back prompting him to tackle me into the frigid water. Who knew that humans could be simple as to use water to play in like children. He leaves the water as I go to float on my back, watching the stars in the sky and the moon gently moving across the sky.
“I never liked you Cassiel.” He sighs as he slams me against the nearest making me groan out in pain. “You always acted like him.” He then inspects his nails taking a step closer to me. “We should have slammed you in the cage with him all those years ago, but Gabriel fought tooth and nail to make sure we didn't.” Then he smiles a sickening smile that makes me want to vomit. “But he isn't here to protect you anymore.”
As soon as I stopped speaking Dean's eyes came into view. “Now what?” He asked me with the newly acquired angel blade in hand.
“Please, Cassiel. Me, just take me. Take me, please.” She begs me as more blood seeps from her wound.
“You do.” I sigh pulling my hair out of my face to tie it up with a hair tie I had found in Dean's car some time back.
“It's the Archangels!” I yell out looking away from Dean to the prophet who now is cowardly holding his head. “I'll hold him off! I'll hold them all off! Just stop Sam!” I yell at Dean as I transport him to his brother.
“You will never trust me.” I point out trying not to show my panic. “You can have Zachariah watch over me to make sure I don’t fall out of line.” I plead as Michael sighs nodding towards my bounded limbs as the latches fall away.
Shoving one of the younger angels in our garrison to the ground with a sickening crunch of metal, I hug the one to come from the front of me as he tackles me down to the ground. The Angel that tackled me punches me in the face making me see stars as two others hold me down by my arms.
“Good because we are going to get drunk regardless.” Then the Impala turns on and we are on our way to some unknown destination.
Then just like that we are fuzed together, my grace and her soul power us in a way that could never be replicated. Opening my eyes I look around trying to gather my surroundings to see the Demons attack the Winchesters. Closing my eyes again I concentrate on all of my energy to my bound wrists, to burn off the rope. Once free I move at lighting speed and kill the two Demons that were after the boys.
Ignoring her weak voice I move so that I am back to back with Dean as more demons come out of the seams. Moving with unparalleled precision I exorcise the demons as Dean works with the demon blade and holy water that he had in his pocket. When they are all dead we turn to Sam, only to see him leaning over a demon's body drinking her blood as if he were a thirsty man in a desert. Watching Dean run over to Sam I finally look at Jean, as broken as she is but still strong and holding on with all of her stubborn might.
“I’m going back to bed.” he mumbled, shuffling over to his door. He undressed down to his boxers and climbed back into his bed. Dean grabbed one of his spare pillows and placed it behind his back, not pretending it was a body. Absolutely not.
Cas had poured himself one too, he was leaning against the kitchen counter. Cas’ eyes cast to Dean’s mouth and Dean retreated his tongue from his lip. He blinked away as if he didn’t seem too fussed he had been caught staring.  “I highly doubt my coffee is that good.”
Last chapter! Sorry it took so long to update. You know how it is sometimes, life, pandemic, the usual stuff.
He hummed, reveling in the appreciation. His mouth opened up to move down, taking more of Cas in his mouth wanting more praise, more moans and groans letting him know how much Cas loved his mouth around his cock. His hand gripped tight on Cas’ thigh, slightly pulling him in to meet Dean halfway, silently asking to be skull fucked.
Cas sighs heavily, runs both his hands through his hair like he’s irritated by Dean. If he didn’t want to be here, he could just leave. It’s like not Dean asked him to be here. He’s about to tell Cas to piss off when,
“Apologies,” Castiel replies taking the pies from his hands. He opens them to check what kind of pies they are. Gabriel presses an indent of the fruit inside the pies onto the pastry crust. “Two cherry?” he checks. The customer nods.
“Damn machines.” He mumbles. He shifts his head on Cas’ shoulder, needs to turn his body towards Cas more to get more comfortable, not too comfortable. The urge to just turn his whole body and bury his head in Cas’ neck is there simmering underneath his skin.
“If you’re offering.” Dean shrugs with a slight smirk. It was on the light side. He didn’t make Gabriel pay for two of the drinks. He’s a generous man when he wants to be. Dean also knows this guy is one of the most important, if not the most important person in Cas’ life. If he wants to get to know Cas better, chances are this guy is the way in.
I tried to save it at the end but who the hell knows. This chapter was an emotional rollercoaster. Me and this chapter were not friends but we made it through and on the home stretch for an adorable smutty finish, stay tuned x
The width of the room between them and it still wasn’t enough. The air of what could have happened if Dean hadn’t walked away lingering between them. Dean was still a little breathless. When he turned back around Cas was still on the bed, he brought his leg that was around Dean back to the ground. His usual pose of his elbows on his knees looking at Dean with those cold blues. He was pissed.
It appeared to have been a warning too late for Cas. His only hope was that once he got Dean how he wanted him, his appetite would diminish, and he could move on. One fuck and he’d get bored. He always got bored. People got boring, fucking the same people even more so and why would Dean be any different?
He got his breath back, staring up at his ceiling reeling in what just happened. Sex brain had quietened down, reality coming back to him with each intake of new air. Cas wasn’t saying anything, neither was he. It was becoming deafening now. What had just happened hung in between them. One of them had to break it.
He must be out on a date. Cas had mentioned about Claire’s other Dad having her for the night. If Dean was about to have another conversation with Cas about dating or sex, he’d need something more than a beer. He grabbed a bottle of whiskey off his bar shelf along with a glass and poured himself a stiff drink. Downing it, then pouring another he felt a bit more prepared, or relaxed to give this whole talking about sex another shot.
He kept having this fleeting image of the girls running into the kitchen at any moment in their pajamas demanding orange juice. Dean would remind them about manners and Cas would pour them some juice, kissing their mess of hairs asking them how they slept. It ached him.
He wasn’t allowed to talk. A fuck, this was supposed to be a fuck. This was turning into something else, something entirely out of Cas’ comfort zone. He was actually shaking.
His phone buzzed, more matches. He tossed it to the other side of the couch, enjoying the moment with his number one girl.
He sat on Cas’ bed, the edge of it with his hands in his hair, elbows on his knees trying to gather up the nerve to tell Cas how pissed off he was with him. The guy saved him, and this was the thanks Dean was going to give him? Disrespect. Cas doesn’t work with disrespect.
Sidenote - whoever voted for this fic to be put into a collection is like a super star and too cute for this world.
“You’re beautiful.” Cas whispered. Dean was too dazed out to retort the statement, being opened up always made him dopey.
That caught Cas’ attention. He looked at his friend who was sipping his beer trying to act like that was the most normal question to have asked him. He stayed staring, trying to assess what Dean was possibly getting at.
“Fuck yeah I did.” Dean beamed at him like he’s telling Cas to let rip already, and Cas started to move with urgency. Hips snapping, the sound echoing throughout his bedroom as he drove his cock into Dean again and again, each thrust as hard and demanding as the next one.
Dean grabbed his brother, pulled him back to give Cas and the others space to get to the window. He watched Cas wipe the blood off of his hand as he walked then handed it back to Balthazar. His fist was cut from the force of his hits. Dean was hesitant to speak with others around, with his brother around.
“You keep the cold out of me Dean.” Cas says. It’s not the answer to the question, he’s off somewhere else again. Somewhere cold.
?” Sam punctuated the last three words insinuating something. Crap, the Angel Grace, he completely forgot to ask about it.
Cas was sitting up on his bed, topless, legs crossed, black notebook in his lap, pencil in his hand jotting things down. “It wasn’t mine to throw out.” Cas replied. He didn’t look up, too engrossed in his scribbles.
, the roll of that word off of his lips was sinful. It threw Castiel, threw him so much that he called him insufferable but not in the context that Dean took it. He didn’t have time to explain himself before the door was shut. Insufferable as in impossible, unbearable to be around because Castiel didn’t know what to do with himself when Dean was around him. All is usual ways of talking to people didn’t work, he couldn’t keep his emotions in check, he felt like he was spilling them out everywhere for Dean to see.
The nurse drops the pills into his hand and gives him a small plastic glass of water.  Dean takes them without protest, glad of the anticipated respite from nausea and the throbbing pinch that matches his steady pulse. He’s no stranger to this kind of head injury, it’s just that he usually knocks back some Advil and sleeps it off.
He smiles to himself and drifts back off to sleep before the headache that is circling somewhere just out of awareness comes back and takes hold.
“Yeah, Benny. He more or less told me to pull my head out my ass, last night. I love you, too, Cas. I don’t care if we stay here, or we go visit the Moose, or hell, emigrate to China. I love you and I wanna be with you, wherever. That’s why I was such an ass last night. I was worried if you started working with Benny, you’d be travelling all over, like he does…”
Cas climbs in beside him and starts the engine, fiddling with the temperature controls. Dean shifts as he feels the last remaining similarity with his Baby, ie: the biting cold of the leather seats under his butt and thighs instantly switch to pleasant warmth.
Cas sighs heavily and rubs his hand over his face and Dean hears the stress beneath his friend’s stoicism. “Perhaps it’s just that she hates me so much that the merest hint of tolerance looks like deep affection.”
Benny’s soft drawl breaks into his thoughts. “Dean said you were good, but he was underselling your skills.” Castiel turns back to the beach and glances up. Benny is smoothing his hand along the curve of the beam. “This is beautiful work, Castiel. You have a real good eye for the grain.”
“I did this?”  Bright blue eyes scanned his face, as Cas pulled at his lip, exposing the split, wincing in sympathy.  “I’m so sorry.”
He strolled along the corridor away from the maximum security wing musing on the whole Winchester fiasco and why it was unsettling him so much. The paperwork was an irritation. There was a lot of paperwork to complete when a taser was used.  Not to mention the amount of paperwork to complete when a remand prisoner ended up in the infirmary.  Thankfully he was making a full recovery but that still left the pile of paperwork required to transfer him into solitary.
He barely had time to register the sound of the voice as he turned the corner onto the airport concourse before he was enveloped into a smothering hug. He squirmed briefly before simply giving in. “My God, I have never been so pleased to see you.” He was allowed a brief second of freedom, as he was bodily thrown backwards to arm's length, his face scanned, before being dragged back into another tight grip. “You look pale. And stressed. I told Meg to look after you… she always was a slacker.”
“...of course, that was it, I pulled a print of the tile behind the toilet pan.  He must be a tiny man, Michael, you know, because he has to lean on the wall to make sure he is over the pan when he p…”
did the fool think he was kidding) Adler moved towards the door, unlocking it with a quick twist of his wrist. From outside a waft of heat carried the grumble of the gritty surface giving under the press of wheels and the rattle of fine gravelly stones pummelling the landscape, it shifted into the soft sing of tyres rolling over the blacktop for a snippet before the vehicle drew to a halt. The engine noise died away, a single car door opened and closed with an expensive sounding soft clunk followed by footsteps, gritty, like a movie sound effect. Slices of a shadowy figure slid along the gaps between the blind slats and then Adler was stepping back away from the door he had just swung open, his head turning back towards Castiel, grey eyes sharp above a vicious smirk.
She had died shortly after giving birth to Castiel.  Her decision to throw herself from the balcony at home while Chuck was in Europe covered up as a tragic accident.
The half an hour flew by, most of the questions were from children, a few didn’t make much sense and one little boy began to cry, overwhelmed, so Dean sat on the edge of the stage and called him over, wiping his tears and suggesting his Mommy ask the question until his voice grew brave again.
“Come out Dean. Hands where I can see ‘em.” Well that answered that question. The guy’s accent was pure Minnesota.
Dean stands in the bright light of his headlights as backs up and watches the red of his taillights disappearing through the scrub grass until he rounds the dunes out of sight. He sighs and stares at the outline of the beach house.  It is their home and every scrap of it has come from them. There is not an inch of it that is not suffused with their combined efforts. He scuffs the sand with his boots and takes a deep breath.
Castiel jolts awake as Dean coasts baby to a halt. Sand sparkles grey amongst dark tufts of seagrass in the beam of the headlights. They have been driving for hours and Castiel fell asleep somewhere south of Atlanta. He turns to Dean, eyes wide with uncertainty, in the reflected gloom. Through the window beyond him he can see the wooden fairings of a building.
She realised suddenly that the place she had thought chic and cool when she arranged the drink was actually probably a little pretentious for Dean’s simple tastes, and she felt like kicking herself when he took one look at the raucous swinging crowd in the Boston cocktail bar and with a simple gesture ushered her down into 68. Overthought grape stewing beat 70’s pseudo chic cocktails any day, apparently.
He could hear voices talking, occasionally words made sense and he caught snippets of the conversation as it drifted around him.  He dreamt that Sam was there, but Sam was safe in California, do-gooding, raising his children and loving his wife. He let himself drift back into the soft floating oblivion.  “
Adler shifted uncomfortably.  “There had to be another angle…”  he thought. Inspiration flooded his brain and adrenaline flooded his blood.   “Would it work?  Oh, my God, that was it.  So simple.  Would he have told him?  Surely that sort of thing doesn’t come up in casual conversation…”
Kali pushed Gabriel towards the lobby and the trolley. “I’ve ordered us a breakfast. Let’s eat while we talk. Spengler should be back any moment and he’ll be coming straight up here with our guest.”
“Why don’t you go and wait with Bal for Cas,” Gabe suggested to Sam softly. “I’ll escort these two beautiful ladies to din…”
He had squawked indignantly when Castiel typed the offer to carry him back to his truck and then come back for his things, "Dude, I weigh two hundred and change! I can walk."
Marcy stared at the opulence of the suite with something akin to disdain.  Having spent the last few hours in her company, as they transferred from private ambulance to medi-jet and then to the comforts of a discreet people carrier, Sam could not help but chuckle.
“Cas,” Jess said gently, “She’s probably just hopped in a cab when she couldn’t find the driver. There’s no need to panic.”
Maybe Kali had let Gregory drive it, or just taken the keys with her changing her mind at the last minute to be chauffeured to the office. With a sigh Gabe pulled open the drawer of the hall stand and fumbled around until he found his own spares for her car. He stumbled out of the door to the corridor towards the private elevator. It pinged it’s little welcome immediately, the car already at his floor and the doors slid open. They were half-way down when his bleary eyes finally focussed on his reflection in the half height mirrors and he realised what was tickling the underside of his chin. A label. He had his T-shirt on backwards and inside out.
He tries to lift his hands to wipe his face, but the clattering sound of metal on metal.  Of course.  He squints at his wrists, vision still too blurry, but the clanking sound, the lack of movement.  He’s manacled to the bed.
“No,” he licked a flake of pastry off his lip, “Figured I’d let them sleep while they could. Today is gonna be a long one and neither of them would have got any shut eye once they…”
And right now, he was extremely glad that Ash knew exactly where his phone was. Because today his knight in shining armour, the man who had rescued him just a few short hours ago had become the damsel in distress and Dean fully intended to go rescue him right back.
Their venomous when they’re arguing. It goes from 0-100 lightning fast. There is no middle for them. It’s all or nothing. Cas shouts at Dean with all he has, and Dean gives as much as he gets.
Dean got off the bed, needed to create some distance between them to get his breath back, get the imprint of Cas’s hands off of his body, compose himself back to who he usually was in here. He was Dean Winchester for crying out loud and he was no one’s prag, even if he wanted Cas in every way imaginable, it wasn’t happening. He wasn’t going to give everyone in Purgatory the satisfaction that Dean was getting fucked by the head of the Russian gang because he owned him.
Dean leans against the wall of the lift. His hands grip the bar and he rolls his head between his shoulders. He looks tired. Castiel mirrors him, leaning against the other side. The lift door closes, and they start the slow ascend. He looks at the mark on his neck, decides it’s a finger mark. Dean probably running a hand around it like he did sometimes, and it’s left a mark. Dean catches him staring.
“You finish that sentence I’ll break your jaw.” He pointed at his brother. He wouldn’t, he couldn’t.
“I want to,” He replied pressing his palm harder, an awkward angle but Cas was making it work. This guy seriously knew how to press Dean’s buttons, his skin was coating itself in a whole new sheet of sweat for Cas to taste. “Can I?” Cas slipped a hand under his waistband, pausing for Dean to give permission, like he even needed it. Dean nodded wanting to be good for Cas, give him what he wants and more pressing, what Dean
“Whoa, you guys made quick work of that bottle.” A familiar voice approaches. He looks up and sees Dean. He’s got bright eyes, not as bright as they could be either. Castiel needs to know why. What happened to Dean for his eyes not to be as bright. He sees glimpses of it, when he’s around his brother or teasing Castiel. In those moments the green is lighter, letting the goodness in and embracing it.
“I’m good.” Dean reassured his friend, tried not to think how hearing his name made his insides clench a bit. He was turned on, things were going to turn him on, hearing his name was going to turn him on. This was all normal reactions.
“What you waiting for?! Go!” Meg shouted over the music and pushed him out of the dancefloor. He didn’t object, stumbling a little but finding his feet before he face-planted on the ground and gave himself a concussion.
Sam had his jacket ready for him. Great, now he was feeling reluctant to leave her. That worrying feeling in the pit of his stomach that something bad was going to happen. Was it irrational? Yes. Did that matter? Apparently not.
“I mean, it has been a while,” Dean joined him in leaning. “Maybe my memory is a little foggy.” It had been, too long. He brought the cup up to his mouth.
Dean told Sammy about why he was missing count. He knew his brother wouldn’t ease up on till he figured it out. At least this way Sam was in no danger of getting his head kicked in for looking in places he wasn’t supposed to. He kept the mutual orgasms to himself though, for obvious reasons. Cas did too. As far as anyone knew they were cell mates and that was about it.
When Castiel manages to get up and open his windows the parking space under his window is empty. He didn’t realise he had slept through the racket of that car leaving. His clock reads 10am. Gabriel has already texted him twice and three missed calls.
No doubt Dean’s face had turned from pink to red. Cas had been pretending to be him but the whole turning head business was enough to make Dean squirm in his seat. The air of confidence Dean knew how to pull in person, not so much in texts. It seemed Cas had it down to a fine art, not too arrogant and everything with a hint of flirtation attached. Only thing was, did Dean want to go out with Benny?
Eventually oversensitive, he wrapped his hand over Dean’s to stop him. He obeyed, dropping it to his side, head hitting the wall behind him to catch his breathe. Cas stepped back, stumbling from his afterglow and alcohol consumption. He tucked himself back in, uncaring about the stains on him.
“I don’t mind strangers watching them, hell, the more the merrier I say but Meg? People we know? It’s weird Cas! You can’t tell me you’re not a little creeped out that Meg is getting off to us getting each other off. You’re like her best friend.”
“It means I am not afraid of authority.” Cas explained. He felt this was privy information Cas was giving him. That not many other Russians would hand that knowledge over as easily. Explained why he showed it to Zachariah during count. A reminder that he did not fear the prison guards. A reminder of what he did to one of their own 2 years ago. Allegedly.
. How in the hell was he supposed to continue scrubbing the ground with that image rolling around in his head? He hoped he was far enough away for Cas not to see the red that had made its way onto Dean’s neck or his dick twitching in his trousers. Cas already knew he could break Dean in close quarters, he didn’t need him to know he could break Dean at a distance too and damn was Dean breaking.
“Right, where is the wrapping paper and card sections?” He looked up at the signs to tell him where to go for what he needed next.
“Just a scratch.” He lies. He has a cloth wrapped around it. He knows it’s not a scratch, can feel the way the glass has sliced along the palm of his hand.
Cas looked down, shaking his head in a smile. He enjoyed catching Cas out, keeping him on his toes especially as they both knew when push came to shove Cas could render Dean mute with just his voice. He was about to continue in this flirty fashion when the girls came clambering up the deck, noticeable shivering, teeth chattering.
He didn’t have a chance to take her hand to bring her up, once out of the seat, she had already darted up the driveway, up the stairs and was banging on the front door.
He shut the door behind them, locking them in. When he was out of view Dean caught Cas’ elbow and turned him around, needing to look at him. The anger was still in Cas, blue eyes piercing, hands in fists. Dean brought his hand up to Cas’ face. The Russian tried to shake it off, but Dean wouldn’t let him, pulling the man into him, making him look at Dean. He put his other hand on Cas’ waist, eyes darting from Cas’ murderous eyes to his mouth. A mouth Dean wanted on his.
And with that Cas tumbled into oblivion. “Oh God,” his hips started to stutter as he spent himself into Dean’s ass. Orgasm strong enough to curl his spine. “Oh fuck.”
“Does that mean you’re going to fall asleep half way through?” Castiel replies. Dean shakes his head. He flicks through the pages, landing on a story about Gabriel. Cas turns him into the Norse God Loki, a cunning trickster who gets the last laughs on his foes who have wronged him. Its light-hearted enough for a story to tell Dean. He settles himself into the couch and begins.
He inspects Dean’s hand, gently with his fingers bringing it close to his face to get a proper look. Dean tries not to pay much attention to the attention. It’s like he homes in on nothing but Dean, the rest of the world ceases to exist as Cas looks at him. The place could be on filling up with water and Cas wouldn’t realise. Cas hums.
It doesn’t take long for his hopes to come into fruition. He spies Cas at the other end of the bar, trying to avoid advances from one of the girls from earlier. Dean half wants to watch the show then sees the girl slap Cas across the face. He rushes over to intervene.
Benny was still alive. The Louisiana smooth talker was surviving by getting ahead of the game and actually supplying Angel Grace to the nut jobs who were looking for it. His work-detail meant he could roam around the grounds with enough freedom and lack of supervision to get away with it. He refused to give Dean his source, though chances were that it was the Russians.
Cas tugged on his wrist, getting Dean to sit up, almost eye level with his crotch. He let go of it, giving permission to Dean to pull his bottoms down. Dean did, pulling out Cas’ cock and gasping at the sight of it, flushed and ready. He hadn’t even touched him yet and he was already this hard for Dean.
He flicked through the pages of some old ass book in the library killing time with Sam who had work on the weekends given he worked in the library. Dean had found a quiet spot down the back between the stacks to park his butt for a few hours. He wasn’t really reading it, mind kept wandering to Cas, his hands, his dick, his eyes, his laugh, his everything. It made him crave the Russian more than ever before.
The str8laced_unlaced account lay dormant for about three weeks because of it. That didn’t mean the views and comments didn’t stop coming in. They got three hundred dollars before when it had been up a couple of weeks and Dean hoped they were in for similar if not more money when the next payment came in. The three videos coming in at around 6000 views along with twenty or so comments. Very,
“Just the one?” Dean asks smoothly even if it is dossed in tiredness. Castiel can feel his ears pinking, Dean wants more than one. That thought is equal parts exciting and terrifying. He’s never been on a date before. A yawn comes out of Dean which Castiel catches.
A silence fell, followed by a sharp gasp from Cas as Dean’s mouth wrapped around the head of his cock. Heat swarmed him. He looked down, not able to help himself, drawn into his friend’s pouted pink lips around his cock. A hum vibrated from Dean, shaking Cas to his core. “Oh—” he cut out before he said Dean’s name.
With his hand still dug into Cas’ hip it was Cas who came first, too focused on the sheer strength and how he hoped there would be circular marks on him for days after this. Dean followed after, stilling and freezing in the moment with his mouth in a perfect o shape that Cas found difficult to look at.
He pressed Dean’s cock further into the side of his cheek, giving him a better touch. A deep seated grown came from Dean that had Cas holding his own cock a little tighter, careful of cumming because Dean making sounds like that was not ok, never ok, a voice shouldn’t go that primal. It was unnatural.
It was easy enough to tell who belonged where. Folk Nation, an all-black prison gang, aggressive, intimating by their stature usually in for drugs and weapons. Aryan Brotherhood, white as fuck usually skinheads with a Nazi symbol or five plastered on their bodies, most of them meth heads and bat shit crazy tended to be in for human trafficking or drugs. The Bratva, Russian gang, cold, collected, ruthless when provoked, tattoos etching their bodies too but less obvious than the Aryan. People speculated what their sentences were for, not that they’d ever say for certain. Dean had his money on them being in Purgatory for money laundering or racketeering, though chances were their list of illegal activity was endless. The Russians were next level bad news.
Cas hooked his finger into Dean’s bottom teeth to use it as a leaver to get Dean closer to him. Without words it was difficult to know what Cas wanted him to do. Cas patted his thigh, giving Dean a signal and Dean shimmied out of his jeans to straddle Cas. He put his hands on either side of Cas to steady himself, his finger still embedded in Dean’s mouth, not going anywhere. It helped keep him quiet and the way Cas looked at him made him think he might crack first.
“One more time! You promised!” she shouted back. Damn, she was right. He had promised, promised her four goes on the slide if she let him tie her red mane of hair up. She hated having her hair tied back, liked it wild and free but rules were rules apparently. Charlie had only been at the pre-school a couple of months and she’d been sent home with the clothing and hair criteria
Cas put his hand out for Charlie to hand him the tie she had been patiently holding and clasped it around the end of her hair. Claire jumped up and down saying it looked great and they now matched because Claire had one too and then Charlie hugged Cas as thanks for doing it and yeah, Dean just about died for a whole other set of reasons in comparison to last night’s. His daughter finally noticed him standing there all heart eyed and melting on the inside.
Hands on his dick that weren’t his were always going to feel good though, right? Heck, even his own hand on his dick felt good. So, it wasn’t a shock to the system that he was going to feel good in this moment. He had to relax, let it happen, think of some pretty blonde with nice curves and bright blue…eh brown, deep brown eyes and strong man like hands?
“Yeah, so I told him to go fuck himself, then he invited me over to his place for dinner and yeah we’re cool now.”
“I’m real.” Cas took Dean’s wrist, lifted it to touch his chest, placed his hand over his heart. The faintest of beats under his palm, calm and steady. Cas put his forehead on Dean’s. Warm breath spreading across Dean’s cold one, heating him up.
Right, the viewers, more views, more money. The heating. That was why they were doing this. He thought about other amateur videos he watched, realising he tended to like porn better when he felt the people in it were enjoying themselves. Currently Dean had been trying not to show he was enjoying it, more or less lying down like a zombie while Cas did all the work. He could change that, not that it would be hard to show he was enjoying himself. If anything, it was getting harder not to show it.
That became a regular thing in the week following. Cas going down to Masters cell, avoiding any long periods of time in the cell with Dean. Dean did too, choosing to spend rec-time with his brother and Charlie down around their cell. Any time spent in the cell reminded him of Cas, couldn’t look at the man’s bed without a spark of heat running through him, couldn’t look at the chair either. The only space untouched by Cas was his bed, and the toilet. So, half of the cell was tainted by Cas and the memories surrounding him.
Cas pushed Dean’s shoulder hard with his hand, making Dean roll over onto his back with force. Cas got up, straddling Dean’s thighs in one sure moment. Dean rose up onto his elbows to protest, “What the hell are you – holy shit!” he cut Dean off when he took a hold of Dean’s crotch over his jeans, not all that surprised that Dean was half hard but enjoying it all the same.
“Yeah Cas,” Dean took one, wiping himself up. He’ll shower in a minute, once his legs start working again. The chances of him moving were slim right now. “You’re a son of a bitch, you know that? What was with that orgasm delay?”
Dean didn’t have long to wait. He was in the yard with Charlie waiting for his brother to come out to join them in their usual spot. Sam was rarely one of the last out which was odd enough, but Dean didn’t think much about it. His brother entered the fenced off yard and nodded in Dean’s direction.
“C’mon Commander, I’ll make us some coffee.” He waved Cas back into his kitchen to make him a cup of java. Cas sat down on one of the chairs. It was the first time Cas and Charlie had been over though it seemed like they slotted in like they’d been there before. Dean wasn’t too concerned about being a good host or making sure they were ok. He found himself acting like if Sam and Amelia were over, an air of casualness, no stress of pressure around.
Dean sat up on his elbows, pushing his glasses back up his nose to glare at the back of Cas’ hair. “Fuck you man.”
“Go back to sleep Dean.” Castiel pulls the covers back over himself. Dean mumbles an ok or a fine, Castiel isn’t quite sure. The street lights from outside cast an orange glow on Dean. His features softened in the glow, his mouth a little parted to breathe. Castiel wants to curl back up into Dean, debates it in his mind till Dean lifts an arm up like he can read Castiel’s thoughts.
“Alright, I’m going now, for real this time so keep your damn hands to yourself.” He pointed his finger at Cas, showing he was being serious. Cas huffed but agreed, putting his hands behind his back to dramatically restrain himself. He scoffed, clocking where Claire got her attitude problem from.
Cas all but lost it when a hand that wasn’t his touched his shoulder, moving up to touch Cas’ face, pressing a thumb into Cas’ cheek to feel himself in Cas’ mouth. Dean never touched him, ever. Not that they had much to go off of, this being only the third time he’d ever been with Dean like this.
He worked Cas a few seconds more, bopping his head up and down till Cas pulled him off with a pop. A string of saliva connected Dean’s lip to Cas’ cock. He went to cut it, but Cas bet him to it, wrapping it around his finger and bringing it to his mouth but that was Dean’s and not Cas’ so Dean caught his wrist before he got that far and brought his finger to Dean’s mouth, letting it slip inside. He slid his tongue along Cas’ finger, taking it to the hilt and keeping it there while he continued to jack Cas off with those slow steady hand movements. His cock slipping in and out easily now coated in Dean’s spit.
“One minute,” Cas replied. He was still tinkering with the laptop that was beside them, had been tinkering with it for the past ten minutes almost, making sure the angle was right, that the camera was working and not too blurry, that the light from the screen was going to light up the area they needed to light i.e. Dean’s dick.
The following night felt a little like déjà vu. He fiddled with his laptop, setting it up, making sure the angles were right for their next keepsake. The money was a mere added bonus at this stage for Cas when it came to their porn account. He hadn’t expected Dean to be the one to ask for this moment to be broadcasted to their viewers.
“We’ll be there.” Dean cut him before he had to explain himself or lie for the sake of keeping face. Dean’s been there more than once himself. Charlie screeched in celebration. It wasn’t like they had plans anyway apart from stopping in on Sam and Amelia. They could do that on Sunday.
Of course, Gordon had been picking up on Cas’ silent treatment. Everyone who was close to them did, made sense outsiders did too. Especially outsiders like Gordon who were itching to get Dean alone and rip his limbs off one by one.
He leaned his head over the bunk, peered down to Cas sitting up with a book in his hand. The blood started to rush to his head looking upside down like this.
When Cas kissed behind his ear or pulled him in closer because he felt like it, it made Dean feel like the shit show they were in wasn’t so bad. And in the darkness when the lights were turned off, when they were tangled in each other’s limbs basking in their afterglows Dean’s imaginary hotel room was slowly becoming their own bedroom.
His good few days had to come to an end at some point. Dean had been riding some sort of a high, no trouble, no worries, no nothing. Work detail was fine, Sam was fine, the Russian was fine. Everything was working like clockwork, even the AB seemed less gawky. He still got stares but that was about as far as it went. It had been quiet for Purgatory.
I wanted to blur the lines some more for them. We should be returning to shitty amateur porn videos next time.
Then there were fingers in his hair. Starting the nape of his neck and moving upwards tugging his hair backwards. His whole body shuddered with it, hairs standing on edge. He watched his arm raise in goosebumps from the touch.
When the bell rings he gathers up his stuff, makes his way out and Dean is outside waiting for him. Of course, he is. He’s leaning against the wall, one foot planted against it and his arms crossed over his chest.
“Hello Dean.” Castiel grabs his keys and steps out into the hallway. Dean gives him enough space to lock up behind him. They walk towards the lift, shoulders brushing. When they’re in the lift Castiel admires Dean. He’s in a maroon shirt, unfastened with a black t-shirt underneath. The late October weather means he’s wearing a navy jacket with deep pockets he’s currently stuffing his hands into as he leans against the wall of the lift. Dean sees him doing it, the staring but doesn’t make a comment about it.
“For you maybe, I hooked up with Lisa Braedon after that and she broke up with me!” She was too embarrassed to even look at him. It took a whole lot of groveling to get her back. Sam told Ash, who told the entire school and they were called Fungus and Gangrene for a week.
“You can’t handle yourself in here anymore Dean,” his brother retorted. “This is not the same place it was. Inmates are dropping like flies either from grace overdoses or being shanked by the addicts high on the stuff and that’s on top of Gordon wanting your head on a plate. Don’t be an idiot.”
He’d never been with someone who could do that before. Hold him down with force that would rival his own. It was hot.
The following two days Dean had been absent from school, not that Cas was all that surprised. He rarely attended a full week at school and was probably having an internal freak out that Cas’ mouth had been on his cock.
Cas shakes his head. Dean sighs, laughs quietly, not a real laugh, a sort of forced chuckle and rubs his hands over his face like he’s come to some realisation. “Wow Cas just – wow.”
Dean didn’t respond, jaw set tight, eyes on the ground. If he didn’t give what Alastair wanted, he’d bleed out on the shower floor. Alastair dropped down to look at Dean, ran the shiv over the side of Dean’s face on the blunt side.
The hand touched his hip, silently telling him to turn over which he did. He was about to speak when his mouth was sealed with another. Morning breathe and all. Dean wanted to say he pulled away but who was he kidding, kissing Cas was the best and even with his internal freak out going on somehow kissing Cas dimmed it just for a moment. Their tongues passed each other’s, exploring and it felt like Cas was trying to pull out all of Dean’s worries.
Dean returned to the chair, put his feet up on the table and his hands behind his back, happily sated in his afterglow. He looked over to Cas who looked equally pleased with what happened. Dean took a mental snapshot of the swollen lips the Russian was sporting and the slight pink on his cheeks, how his chest was rising and falling fast still trying to get his breath back. Yeah, Dean caused that, and he liked knowing it.
Turned out the younger boy was Dean’s little brother, Sam, who still managed to burn bright in comparison to his older brother. Cas figured eventually his bullish attitude was down to hiding something darker rather than being an actual obtuse douchebag. Where Cas sought solitude, Dean sought distraction by attention, popularity and making a general ass of himself in Cas’ opinion. Everyone had their ways of coping he guessed.
Not sated enough from his drunken hookups Cas found himself spending too much time on the website their videos were on. His hunger had him searching for other amateur videos, ones with dark haired tops and light brown-haired bottoms. Cas would bring himself close enough to the edge with them, then quickly open up the video of Dean cumming to finish himself off. The sex filled desperate moans of his friend, his new favourite sound. If only he could hear it again.
“What did I do?” he asks, like he doesn’t even know. Cas doesn’t reply, just starts to walk down the hall but is stopped by Dean’s strong grip. He pushes Cas into the wall and Cas starts to fight against it. It’s no use. “Tell me.” Dean insists.
“Charlie you little…get your butt back down here!” he shouted to his four-year-old who was running along the rope bridge in the jungle gym to get to the slide for the third time that morning.
The thought of Sam’s life on the line was being sidelined by the sheer desire he had for Cas to make him cum already. The Russian was taking his sweet time about it, like they had the luxury of being slow about this in Purgatory.
“Cas.” he breathed. A breath he couldn’t get for what felt like an age. He reached for him, taking his wrist and putting his hand under his shirt, where it needed to be. He needed to be cleansed. Cas could do that.
Winchester, manacled to the chair in the interview room, a line of steristrips closing an angry looking split over his eyebrow, had politely answered the detectives in Nevada.  He did not strike Henrikson as a liar, nor despite this one list of charges, as a kidnapper.  In fact, he was likeable, a little sassy under the polite veneer, maybe, cocky even, but likeable.  He had stuck to his story. Insisted that Castiel Angel was with him voluntarily, that he had picked him up hitching on the side of the highway and entered into a bargain to take his hitcher to Mexico on the promise of $5,000. This was the only point about which Henrikson didn’t believe him.  There was something more, something Dean Winchester did not want to say.  Not on tape anyway.  Those intelligent green eyes had slid away from the interviewing officer and fixed on the two-way glass, just for a moment.  Henrikson had just decided to engineer a little private tete a tete when the interview was interrupted, the state-appointed lawyer had arrived and, wham!  All discussion was closed down.
“Something’s wrong. I know it.” He jumped as the phone beeped in his hand. Shakily he read the text message. “She’s sent me a motel address,” he looked at Sam, brow wrinkled in confusion. Why the hell was she booking into a motel? She knew Gabe owned the Casanova.
Desperately, ignoring Raphael, Cas turned to Michael.  “You have to listen to me, Michael.  Raphael is trying to take over the company, he wants you off the board.  All this is because Anna said no.”
“I talked to him on the blower a few days ago. He said he’s still pushing the press, the owner is playing the bruno.”
“First thing to learn about my Cassie, Mick, my darling, never disturb his beauty sleep and if you do, never get between him and his first coffee.” Balthazar rests easily against the door jam, his robe draped softly open over a pair of silk boxers, his own mug gripped lazily in one hand. Castiel can see the blush of a bruise at his wrist.
Waist deep in the rolling ocean, upper body swaying slightly as the swell rocked up against his chest.  Tiny bubbles, as brief as pecked kisses, bloomed and popped across the neoprene of his wet-suit. The only sound, apart from the occasional call of the ever-present gulls, was the break of the waves above the sandbank further out to sea.  The froth of the caps luminescent in the dying light. The sun hovered minutes above the distant horizon, but he did not want to leave the water, content to watch the sky and ocean blend into the muted pastels of twilight.
The news of the upcoming custody challenge was broken in a statement by long time family lawyer, Zachariah Adler, back in May last year. “The Masters family announce that, with great reluctance, they intend to challenge the last will and testament of their daughter-in-law, Margaret Masters. Her battle with cancer and the debilitating effects of intensive bouts of radio and chemotherapy clearly had a devastating effect on her mental well-being. Her decision to name Mr Novak as administrator of the trust she set up for our beloved granddaughter Claire is not at issue, although it came as a shock, but her decision to legalise his guardianship of Claire in secret prior to her death and his subsequent refusal to reverse the same has left the family with no choice but to fight for their kin.”
“Dammit!” Gabe interrupted. “Mike and Cassie aren’t just acting on Raphael’s directions, they’ve cooked up so half-assed plan of their own. Why the hell didn’t they say something?… we could have worked something out together.”
He closed it firmly behind her and grabbed the key from the bedside cabinet, locking the door and then half twisting it, so that it lodged in the keyhole. He paused, staring at the back of the door for a moment. Then, for good measure, he pulled the dressing room chair over wedging it under the door handle. He reset his alarm for an hour later. He would definitely be ‘out’ for breakfast. With one last satisfied look at his barricaded door, he settled back with a sigh onto his bed, safe in the knowledge that no-one else was going to be entering his room uninvited.
“Finding it difficult to get comfy, sweetheart?” Winchester gave him a twisted grin in the rearview.
She dropped Dean to the floor, sending him sprawling forward at Castiel’s feet. “I told you I was not angry with you my Prince, and I meant it. I understand, he was there, smelling of the ocean, it is no wonder that you were tempted. You have ten minutes, Castiel, to say goodbye to your pet, while we finish the rituals on your new collar.”
“And then?” Michael prompted, not satisfying Roman’s prediction. “What then? How do I know Raphael won’t have them killed when I hand over the drive? He is hardly the poster boy for trust and honour anymore.”
“You know they have these 48-hour deodorants now…” the blue eyes were closed again, the face serene, only a slight smirking curl to the lips spoiling the angelic appearance. “They’re very effective for men with body odour issues.”
“It’s OK,” Castiel nodded. “I should go, please take your lunch, enjoy. I can get the flask back next time.” He stood and with a curious little nod, he turned and walked away.
Castiel was amazed that Dean was not more aware of his surroundings, he was a policeman after all, but he supposed he had been drinking in that absurd wine bar.  “Focus,” he snapped at himself, “this is too important. He can go for drinks with attractive female colleagues if he wants to, he’s not mine.”
Bess stood for a moment, rubbing her arm, a set of finger-shaped striped red blotches appearing on her pale slender arm in the soft flesh just above her elbow.  Then her chin began to crinkle, and she gave a little sob, as the shock hit her.
When he unlocked and opened his door Sam discovered, that apparently, his height entitled him to a quiet room with a king size bed overlooking the high walled garden. Double doors opened onto a small balconette, soft voile deflecting the bright sunlight into something softer and more soothing. He kicked off his shoes without untying them and flopped onto the bed. He had two hours until he needed to go downstairs to eat and he’d already set his phone alarm. He was asleep before the mattress stopped bouncing under his weight.
“I was just finishing my breakfast when I heard someone come rushing down the stairs. I knew it wasn’t Drew himself, the footsteps weren’t heavy enough. He’s been a most considerate neighbour really, and, I don’t wish to be indelicate, but it’s not unusual for him to have …callers,” she leant forward, her voice had dropped to an artful whisper, despite the fact that they were alone in her sitting room. “Especially when Andrea is out in the country.”
He knows he’s being an asshole, but he can’t help the little surge of jealousy he feels. He’s kind of used to having Cas here with him and he knows that Benny’s winter work schedule takes him all over the neighbouring three states. He goes where the work is, sometimes weeks at a time.
“Holy shit” Crowley thought to himself. “Our killer is probably a woman.” Female serial killers were a real rarity unless they were accomplices. And statistically, although it was on the increase, they favoured non-violent (if you could have any such thing) methods of murder like poison. He pulled himself back, “stop getting ahead of yourself,” he scolded.
“Yes, Antman, with the heated glue and the keychain,” Kasia continued as if this made everything self evident. “The hardest part was finding a print, but then I remembered how precious he is about his private bathroom and…”
Concussion.  That explained it.  So he’d hit his head.  When had he hit his head?  Or had someone punched him?  Would hardly be the first time he’d been punched.  But he’d listened so carefully to Benny.  He’d stayed out of trouble.  Followed every instruction.  He'd been so good.  If he was good and kept his head down, he would get out of here. He was only here for a few weeks, while they saved Cas. He was here to save Cas. Where was Cas?  Stupid boy. Cas wasn’t in jail with him. Benny was in jail with him, Cas was… Cas was… Jesus, he had to get out of here and find Cas.  He would be having nightmares without Dean to comfort him and quiet him back to sleep.  He started to struggle to sit up, to roll out of the bed, but his arms wouldn’t work.  Every time he tried to move them they got stuck. He tried to shake his head free of the confusion that seemed to be addling his brain, but only succeeded in making his head scream in pain, bright circles of light sparkled in his eyes and the super-bright world faded to black.
He let Garth take over at this point, fleshing out her statement into something more intelligible and getting her to sign it. It might be worth a stab at an Identikit image but Crowley already suspected it was too late in the day. Witness minds were fickle things, even the most visually acute and observant people missed vital details or suffered from distorted memories, and Jenna Hughes struck him as far from observant. He ‘fanked’ her absent-mindedly and began mulling over what the statement meant.
Behind him, he heard Meg chuckle. When he glanced over his shoulder he could just make out the shake of her head, the mess on her face doing nothing to disguise the smile she had been confusing him with for years. “Oh, Cas. We’re imprisoned in the middle of nowhere, by a psychopathic maniac… who just happens to be your older brother... and you… you... why would you even know that, much less bring it to mind right now… My God, I love you, Cas, but you are such a fucking nerd.”
At the little passing out display for parents today, Lucas showed off his skills proudly and his mother tearfully laughed and clapped as he collected the graduation bandanna Benny provides for all the kids at the end of their lessons.
She gave him another slurp of water and let him swill and spit, as his bright blue gaze flicked over her face, a mixture of gratitude and relief.  “How are you even here, Meg?”  His voice was little more than a whisper.
“Sam. He rang him as soon as the news of the arrest was out. They've found Gabe. Bal is in Vegas.  They were getting ready to stand bail for Dean but Valentine has been talking to the DA…there's some ”
He settled back onto his chair. The monitor images were rebooting, one by one. In Cell C, Benny’s sleeping figure emerged first, then Bass saw his own hunched figure, moments later the airlock appeared, but it was the next image that registered with a juddering shock. In Cell A, the bunk was empty. Bass hit the light override, feeling the initial surge of alarm soar into full blown panic. It was at a full six minutes since he had watched Alastair leave the wing, he slid his electronic keycard into the side of his keyboard and typed the code with shaking fingers. The deadbolts to both cells slid back with a thunk, even while he was dodging back through the security tapes of the last few minutes.
"Or maybe we should just charge him now because the only way he could possibly know this stuff is if he's involved.” Dean dragged his hand down over his face. He was sick of the internal conflict, everything he knew was telling him that he’d been played and that Novak was a manipulative sociopath, but his instincts were telling him something very different.
With a flash of brilliant blue in the bright sunshine, Cas’ attention snaps back. Fully flustered at being caught staring, Dean’s mouth runs away with him and he hears himself blurt out. “Call me later with the deets, sweetheart, you know I can never refuse you anything.”
Castiel has spent the rest of the week avoiding Balthazar since their pseudo argument at the restaurant. It’s quite an achievement with lives as intertwined as theirs. He feigned sleep when Bal came in and gently knocked at his bedroom door that night and made sure he was gone the next morning, well before Bal was awake. He knows he’s being a total jerk, but somehow can’t stop himself. But after three and a half days of deleting Bal’s texts, ignoring his calls and sneaking in and out of their home, he can’t hide anymore, his friend has used Hannah to ambush him.
Dean realised his brother was waiting, expecting to be dismissed, but hoping for an invitation. He sighed heavily, closing his eyes and ruffling a hand through his hair. “Yeah,” he mumbled. When he looked up Sam started to turn away, he wanted to stop him, to say something anything, but another sigh, more of a snort tangled the words in his throat. He sat up and dropped his feet to the floor to shuffle to the bathroom.
The first day of his trial proper is also his last. Castiel has changed into a suit, provided to him with a note from Spengler, he and Hannah have been shopping apparently. How nice for them, Castiel thinks a little sarcastically. He is escorted to his seat in the courtroom by an armed court usher. Spengler running late, arrives out of breath, he slides into the seat next to Castiel and gives him an apologetic smile and starts to explain, just as the courtroom is called to order and they all stand for the judge.
Cas tried to push himself up, but gasped in pain, hands recoiling into fists as he overbalanced and fell heavily against Dean.  The sudden impact knocked him back, and his head connected with the wall behind him hard enough for stars to dance briefly in the darkness of the motel room.
He swallowed the bile that threatened to rise with the scotch in his throat. Their brief meeting this morning in Raphael’s office had not filled him with any great confidence in the supposed respected psychiatrist, indeed having now met Roman in person, Michael had added oily creep, to the list of uncomplimentary adjectives he’d already decided upon.  He had forced Raphael to promise that he would not make any decisions about Cas’ care in his absence, his own fists tightly clamped at his sides, because he didn’t trust himself not to start shouting and pointing if he didn’t keep up his mirage shield of calm.  He’d listed it off.  No change of staff, no change of drug regime and definitely no removal from the mansion unless he himself had personally and expressly agreed to it.  Despite his quiet simmering determination it still went against years of habit and conditioning. He didn’t like undermining his older brother in front of other people, but they had left him no damned choice.
The pain is something one can tolerate after a while, but what she was after is my memory. That kind of pain is something that can only be imagined, especially when she goes in to block and reset me for their own purposes. But just before she can get the memories of Dean Winchester, the ones that at that point I held closest to my heart, a prayer came through making her and Michael stop.
Most of my brethren would have laughed if I had described such things. They would never understand the profound bond that I had created with him over that year. They would never understand what it was like to put him back together at the subatomic level. They would never be able to even comprehend what it is like to feel his soul crying out in agony as I fought our way up from hell, and it just sickens me that I couldn't sooth that pain.
