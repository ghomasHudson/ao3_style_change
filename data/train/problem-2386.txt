Five hours and one lunch break later, Dean was on his way back to the apartment. He would have some time to review the day’s notes and change into his uniform before tryouts.
The teacher entered and began setting up her materials, and just a minute before the bell rang, Dean stormed into the room and flung himself into his seat, bringing in a rush of air with him.
mate. I was kidding about the letter. Don’t you dare do that. We aren’t in the stone age anymore. I was
“Uncle Cassie!” Said the small girl as she ran. Cas smiled and crouched down, opening his arms wide to catch the child. She ran straight into his chest and he held her and tipped backwards, pretending to have been knocked over.
Viscous back and forth thoughts circled Dean’s mind on their walk back. He absently accepted a ride home from Cas, and the drive was quiet except for the hum of the road. Cas smiled at him and placed his right hand on the centre console, palm up in a clear invitation. Dean fitted his hand into his and Cas laced their fingers together and squeezed lightly. This grounded Dean slightly and he made his decision. He would suck it up and do whatever Cas wanted. He would make him feel good because thats just what a good boyfriend would do.
Tentatively, so lightly Dean thought he might be imagining it, a hand settled over his shin. He shifted his leg, and now there was the definite pressure of a handprint curling towards his calf muscle.
was weird. Castiel waded over to the shallow end of the pool where he could stand with his torso out of the water. He tentatively touched the three lines, which looked suspiciously like… a claw mark tattoo. Behind him, Hannah grazed her fingers over his shoulder blade. He twisted to look, and saw a huge black spot, like someone had bounced a basketball on him right there.
Dean nodded in agreement and let Cas gently peel off both condoms. He leaned down to peck Dean on the lips, a laughably chaste gesture compared to what they had just done.
Dean knocked on the door using his foot, and was surprised when the door swung open from the contact.
Bobby nodded, small and accepting, then gave Dean’s shoulder a tight squeeze before he stood to leave.
“Last one to the house is a rotten egg!” Richard called out, grabbing a random arm and tearing off in a run.
“Heal up. I’ll be back in a few days,” the man ordered. He retrieved his blood filled bowl and relocked the cage. Cas wanted to move into a corner so he wasn’t so exposed, but he didn’t have the energy. The coolness of the concrete seeped into his cheek and kickstarted a mild headache, but it was nothing compared to the throbbing of his wrists.
“I’m getting there don’t worry. Anyways I’ve gotta run, got a pie in the oven,” He said as he grabbed the empty tray and started a leisurely strut back towards the house.
Cas woke to an incessant beeping, but he didn’t move. The sound of his alarm was actually comforting. It brought him back to earth after what was probably the worst nightmare he had ever had.
The sound returned to his ears and it was only then that he realized it had been missing. Cas took a breath and the world came back into focus. All around him, the children were stirring in their beds.
“And you love me for it,” Charlie answered, hopping up to give him a peck on the cheek. Cas flipped the pizza box shut and smiled. When he’d introduced Charlie to his friends back in junior year, he hadn’t expected them to pull her into the group so easily, but they had. Now, nearly four years later, they were inseparable.
The melody that at first was so prominent was slowly choked out and replaced by a flow of notes that took on an almost menacing quality. Michael seemed to push his whole body into the large echoing booms of sound and an even marching noise that crashed out of the piano.
Benny huffed. “Like hell you are.” And that was the end of that. Dean followed Benny thought the crowd and out the doors, feeling like he was floating away, pushed right out of his own body somehow. They turned the corner and headed towards Dean’s building.
They planned to meet at a cafe for breakfast and to read over each other’s papers before submitting. Dean was very much looking forward to getting this assignment over with, even if it meant he wouldn’t be working with Cas anymore. Weeks ago, that might have made him nervous, but now he felt more settled. Stable. Like he knew Cas wouldn’t up and leave just like that.
Cas huffed out a laugh and Dean felt the vibration of it in his own chest. “Yeah, I’m not too fond of spanking. But if anything else comes up I’ll let you know.”
Dean froze, not quite sure how to react. He definitely hadn’t seen that coming. Sam’s silence hung from the other end.
He swung his backpack over his shoulder and stalked outside with purpose, like he had someplace to be. Sam’s building was just across the street, and Dean reached the courtyard right as kids began pouring out the front door, most already running for the pitifully small soccer field or the run down playground.
In the end, Dean sent a text to Benny explaining the situation and to asking if he knew of a good place to rent a suit. Benny responded a few minutes later letting him know he actually owned something that would probably fit, and he could bring it over after six.
Dean’s heart skipped a beat. He tried not to read to far into the fact that he had hung out with Cas two days in a row, both outside of school.
“Cas,” Hannah started sympathetically. The pitying tone stung like lemon juice in a paper cut. Cas didn’t want to hear any of what she had to say. He wanted to teleport home. Preferably straight into bed under a mountain of blankets.
Frazzled, Dean looked down at his page, where his grade was exposed, red and telling and glaringly obvious. He flushed deeply and snatched the papers in his fist, crumpling them up a little.
There was no way for Dean to have noticed a pair of curious and confused blue eyes watching him from the dark hallway where they had disappeared to. There was no way for him to know that a knot of tension released from a particular angel’s chest when he saw the human somehow…not repulsed. There was no way for him to know about the flutter of hope the angel felt.
resistance, maybe even a full blown argument, but what he did not expect was a loud, brash bark of laughter from Samuel. He laughed, then continued laughing until he had tears gleaming in his eyes.
“Its been nice having someone around. My family can be a little crazy sometimes. Sorry if they overwhelmed you,” Cas said sheepishly.
“You’re like a bloodhound Dean, you can smell grease from a mile away” Sam said with a fond chuckle. He deposited the bags on the kitchen counter and started putting away his haul as Dean dug for a burger.
“Great actually. I got up early to finish studying for calculus. I ended up with this super strict teacher and I’d really like to do well,” Sam explained. Dean made a sarcastic noise. Only Sam could manage to sound so pleased about having a strict teacher.
He rolled his shoulders, ruffling his wings in their dimension before looking around to make sure nobody was near, then snapped them into corporeal existence. With a sigh, he spread them wide and watched as the rising sun glinted off the blue-black feathers.
Dean worked quickly, falling into an easy rhythm. He stroked his fingers over the velvety warm skin that was exposed in the bare patches as he went, and soon there was a small pile of feathers on the floor beneath each wing.
Dean shot him an acidic look. “Eighteen,” he said after a beat, but it was long enough for Cas to know he was lying.
“Come on, let’s get ready for bed,” Gabriel said, standing and lifting Cas with him. Castiel didn’t protest, even though the sun was still out and it was
“That’s how it was supposed to go. You were supposed to walk in on a perfectly set table with perfectly unburnt food.”
Benny was leaning over him, both hands on his shoulders. He was saying something, but Dean didn’t understand a word. He was drenched in cold sweat, and breathing heavily. The real world seemed fragmented, cut through with these memories twisted and made grotesque.
Cas’s hands were everywhere, mapping the planes of Dean’s body, every place that dipped and had changed since he had knit him back in hell. The scar over his shoulder, the new length to his hair, the tight bulge of his muscles, the hard line between his legs.
Cas heard another gruff voice and a higher muffled mewling sound, like someone had stuffed a kitten in a bag. The door slammed again.
He made it a habit, right up there with brushing his teeth and making his bed. He looked every morning. Every night.
The car sped over a pothole and Dean jolted in the passenger seat. His head bumped against the window but he kept his eyes shut because the light outside hurt. He’d hit his head pretty hard when he got thrown, but he was trying his best not to make a big deal of it because it wasn’t the first time and definitely wouldn't be the last.
know that. It was the only thing that kept him going all these years, knowing that the few dark little scar marks that never faded meant he still had a chance.
“Yes you definitely are,” Dean agreed cheekily, earning a swat on the arm. He leaned back and tugged Cas into a sitting position.
The day had started off weird. Gabriel was in a grumpy mood in the morning. Then Dean wasn’t in math class. So when Castiel hooked his backpack up in the sweaty gym changeroom, he ignored the random sinking feeling that washed over him. There was no conceivable reason for it, after all.
“She’s safe. Back with her parents. Probably gonna need a lifetime of therapy,” Dean admitted with a wince.
Gabriel rushed towards him and leaned Cas forward until he was sure he wasn’t choking for real. He silently helped Cas rinse his mouth out, and as soon as the foamy paste was more or less gone, Gabriel picked Cas right up again and cradled his head into his chest, pulling his brother’s gaze away from the mirror.
He was still cursing himself over how badly he had reacted yesterday. Now that all was said and done, he had no idea how to go back and even try to fix it.
reading something. Dean guessed that was his way of making up for barely ever going to school, but the heavy tome his kid brother was holding was heavier than him and the cover was scrawled with drawings of angles and squiggly lines and letters and numbers all mixed together. It made Dean’s headache worse just to think about it.
Castiel’s heart sank at the tone, but he didn’t rise to the bait. He reached a hand out and brushed it, gentle as a feather, against the spot on Dean’s chest where he sported a matching tattoo.
Castiel’s heart dropped as his eyes adjusted, now clearly seeing the light sheen of sweat covering Dean and the sheets twisted all around him. He sat at the edge of Dean’s bed, close but not touching him, unsure of how to help and what he was wanted for.
“Eh. Half work half pleasure. I’m writing a piece on the different atmospheres in the bars near campus and also trying to pick up a hot chick.”
After several minutes, Dean gently added a third finger. Cas was mumbling nonsense at this point and his hands in Dean’s hair were by turn running through it, then controlling Dean’s head. They didn’t seem to know what they wanted. Dean popped off his cock to look at him but Cas was gone, completely absorbed in pushing back into Dean’s fingers.
Castiel secretly thought his splash was the best. He was the one with the pool after all, the one who practiced his cannonball splash at
Cas mostly held Dean up as he rinsed off his body, but it was a serious task because Dean was more unsteady on his feet than he looked. He must have hit his head harder than he had let on.
Sam huffed out a laugh. “It’s fine Cas. Dean is right. You should have something to change into so you don’t wear that trench coat all the time.”
and neatly completed the solution. Dean leaned slowly closer to see the page. His shoulder bumped Castiel’s, but he didn’t move. He was too focused on the evolving solution to notice.
Cas’s face softened slightly, an expression which may have been relief if he allowed it to show properly.
“Wait, wait! Pause! Time out!” Hannah gasped between the unrelenting splashes coming her way. Castiel and Balthazar both fell for it, and Hannah successfully sent a huge spray of water in their direction before they could duck away.
“No,” Cas said, sitting heavily on Dean’s hips again, even though the man immediately stilled under him.
Dean hummed in agreement and settled back to watch the episode. Cas copied the motion, close enough to Dean that he could feel the warmth of his skin, but not close enough to actually be touching.
“Nothing you shouldn’t already know, son,” Bobby answered evenly. He wasn’t that much older than John, but the disparity between their maturity levels had never been bigger. Dean felt like his foundation was shaking.
Cas seemed to grow at the praise and Dean found himself taking a step forward, just to be closer to that radiant smile. He might have imagined it, but Cas’s eyes flicked down to his lips for a brief second before he took a deep breath and pushed his hands into his pockets.
Cas caught both of Dean’s hands and placed them on his hips. He pressed his body against Dean’s and rested his elbows over his shoulders, fingers running through his hair in a way that sent chills down Dean’s spine.
“Well then we better do well on this one.” He pulled Dean into the tall corn stalks and picked a direction at random.
Dean bit down hard on his tongue, trying to keep his anger in check. It had probably been two years or more since their last encounter, but the memory of it still made him sick. Some part of him still hated himself for letting it happen. For getting into that situation in the first place.
“I know,” Cas answered easily. “How about you, though? Anyone significant in your life?” The hope behind that question was palpable. Cas may as well have been asking if
She chewed twice and swallowed, then grabbed the nearest drink, which turned out to be Balthazar’s still mostly agitated one. When she unscrewed the cap, a mist of coke sprayed out, making Bal laugh, but Hannah just chugged back what was left in the bottle.
“Hazel is your sister’s kid?” Dean asked. He was slightly amused that a professional chef like Gabriel would be making macaroni and chicken nuggets for a family dinner, but based on what he had seen of the family so far, Dean thought it best to withhold any judgement. For all he knew the chicken nuggets could be imported straight from France, or wherever it was that they came from. Either way, he loved chicken nuggets.
He padded back out of the bathroom, wanting nothing more than to crawl into bed and sleep off his pounding headache. Hell, his mild
He slid behind the wheel and allowed himself a second to just breathe the scent of leather before turning on the car with a rumble and beginning the drive.
“Let me heal you” Cas said, clearly and quietly. The words were a clear demand, but they were spoken too softly, with too much hidden meaning to be taken as anything but a raw desire to fix Dean in the same ways Dean had fixed him.
a next time, because there never was, but he refused to think about that now. He sucked Cas down as far as he could and pulled up slowly, hollowing out his cheeks.
Dean realized he hated his life when his alarm rang the next morning. He went through his routine in a mental fog; run to the beach, shower, coffee on the fire escape, walk to school.
On her next pass, she attempted to flip her board, but had a little too much speed and ended up tumbling, thankfully, into the grass. The board rolled down the pipe and bumped against a metal railing.
“I won’t,” Dean interrupted him darkly. “If that’s how you feel then I won’t show up anymore. Sorry for disturbing you.”
They walked in comfortable silence until the school buildings came into view and Dean angled to walk towards his justice studies class.
Cas didn’t even have a chance to explain himself. He didn’t want Dean to leave, what he wanted was for him to
Castiel huffed wetly against Dean’s neck. He pulled away slowly. “I should be asking you that, Dean. You’re the one that got -” And he didn’t even finish his sentence because his breath hitched. Dean reached out and cupped his jaw, swiping away a hot tear with his thumb.
He resolved to take whatever shitty and painful experiences he had in his past and do the exact opposite, which meant the first step was probably some lube.
“Kinda,” Dean said shortly, leaving the muffin where it was. He wished Cas would just drop it. Now was not the time or place to delve into psychoanalyzing himself based on what flavour of nightmare his stupid sub conscious decided to serve up this time.
The sight behind it nearly made his jaw drop. Tucked into the little clearing was a small grassy area; very overgrown, but impossibly soft looking. Bordering the small space on three sides were trees, roots completely hidden by a tumble of wildflowers. Cutting across the back was a small brook that had carved its way through the stones and made a clear pool that appeared deep enough to swim in. Dean looked back at Cas, who was twisting his shirt in his hands, looking almost nervous.
Castiel stepped out of the car and reached back in to lift Dean out as well. The hunter stirred and let out a wet sounding cough, making the angel’s heart freeze with fear. Normally a vampire was easy to handle, but a newborn vampire was strong, and this was Dean, who knew what he would be capable of? Maybe he was an idiot for refusing to tie him. He quickly scooped Dean up and stepped inside, shutting the front door with his foot.
beyond all measure, but real. Castiel didn’t even hesitate to gather Dean into his arms. Didn’t even pay attention to the
“Fine. I like burgers, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and October 11th. That’s me in a nutshell,” Cas answered sassily.
At that, Castiel loosened his hold slightly and gave Dean some space, but just the space allowed in the confine of his arms.
“We need ice cream too,” Cas informed him, pulling out a tub of vanilla from the freezer across the aisle.
“Fifteen,” Benny straightened and called out, and a tall lean boy wove out of the crowd to stand behind him.
“That thing,” Sam yelled back, pointing to the same strawberry contraption Dean had been eyeing earlier. Dean smiled. They truly were related. He let Sam drag him to the short line, and they only had to wait a couple minutes until the overly chipper worker took two tickets and let them into the ride area.
No. Cas would not come when called this time. He would continue to ignore the boys completely until Sam understood that this wasn’t something they were going to talk about. Besides, if either of them were truly in danger, they would say so.
Dean laughed and followed, stopping quickly in Cas’s room to grab his things before heading out to the car.
“I changed my mind too,” Dean said softly, reaching out to tuck a lock of Castiel’s hair behind his ear. Cas tipped his head, wondering what about.
No matter how many times he replayed those words, the hurt never lessened. This time was no different.
A light flicked on and the man that had snatched Cas from the parking lot stepped into the harsh glow of the bare bulb. He was holding a small and very grimy knife, and a large bowl. He dropped the knife unceremoniously into the bowl and shifted to hold it under one arm. From his pocket he dug out a key and slotted it into the thick padlock on Cas’s cage, which
Their lips met like long lost lovers, tentative, uncertain if this was okay, then ravenous, suddenly unwilling to part for air or hellfire or anything in between.
“Love is sacrifice. It’s a give and take. I understand that you’re not the type of person to kick back when you have the means and knowledge to solve a problem. I appreciate that about you, and if it means I can’t have you here by my side all the time, then so be it.”
Okay, so that was definitely the dumbest thing that could have come out of his mouth. There was no way to take it back now though.
“Hey Ben, how’s it going?” Dean answered, grateful for the moment his face was tucked behind Benny’s shoulder. It gave him a brief pause to compose himself again.
Dean nodded and ducked into the bathroom to fill a bowl with warm water and give Cas some privacy. He returned to find the angel stuck in his coat, one arm twisted halfway out of a sleeve and a painfully annoyed look on his face.
“Woah language,” Rafael interrupted, gesturing at Hazel who was completely oblivious, reaching for the chicken nuggets. Anna absentmindedly moved her lemonade out of range of her flailing arms and brought the bowl closer to her.
“Well?” Dean asked, “what are you waiting for man? Go get your girl. Please. I can’t stand here seeing you all weepy over something you can still fix.” He pushed Benny closer to the door and Benny unfroze, snapping into action. He pulled Dean into a bone crushing hug.
The teacher, bless her heart, stood from her seat that very moment and cleared her throat to begin the class.
“Yeah of course Cas,” Dean answered. He wandered back into the living room and got the first episode ready to go. He stood to join Cas on the couch when he realized he hadn’t offered him anything to drink yet. His mother would have been so disappointed in his hospitality skills. It was evening, so he wanted to offer a beer, but the cookies were almost ready, and who the hell drinks beer with chocolate chip cookies?
Dean was on the sofa, hands tangled in his softly tousled hair, staring at his bare feet in the moonlight.
Castiel let out a ragged sob when a third and cursedly longer tattoo appeared. At this rate, he might never even find out. It was rare
Ever competitive, Michael and Raphael also had to then prove themselves, and it was a long couple rounds with some laughably awkward positions before they collapsed back on the sofa, breathing hard.
“So. You’re the goody-two-shoes that’s gonna turn me into a math whiz?” Dean asked, his tone nearly acidic. He looked down his nose at Cas, narrowing his eyes. “Should’a clocked you for some kind of nerd.”
Cas pulled back and allowed the vision to fizzle out. He fished out his cell phone and shot Sam a text.
The situation suddenly didn’t seem so funny. The sidewalk didn’t seem so warm. Dean did not want him. Whatever had happened earlier, the laughter, the kissing, it must have been an act. The realization made him feel dirty all of a sudden. Like he had somehow
Dean had enough presence of mind to hobble to his room and grab a change of clothes before making his way to the bathroom. He turned the water to the hottest setting and didn’t wait for it to warm up before he carefully stripped and stepped under it.
“Okay?” Cas questioned lightly. He felt a little like an overinflated balloon. The wrong words spoken too sharply would cause him to pop and he would dissolve into something worthless and empty. Broken.
“I was thinking we could go down to the beach? There’s a pretty big lake a couple minutes drive away and it’s nice to walk through the sand this time of year.” He popped a fry into his mouth. It was salty and crisp.
Dean let the silence hang for a moment. “Cas this is normal actually. Its an emotional day, you lost your
Castiel looked skeptical, but stood carefully and followed Dean to his room, then perched uncomfortably at the foot of his bed.
already and you didn’t answer,” Balthazar said in a rush, toeing off his shoes and walking straight into the kitchen. He didn’t give Cas a chance to explain himself. “Oh. You’ve made coffee. Nevermind. All is forgiven.” He pulled open the dishwasher, grabbed at random, and poured coffee into a bowl.
“Naw I’m fine,” she said quickly. Dean might have believed her except that she couldn’t seem to tear her eyes away from the girl. The brunette gave her a small shy wave and Charlie shifted in her seat.
jagged and imperfect. “I don’t know what was going on that night, but… I’m glad you stopped. It… would have destroyed me.”
“Are you kidding me Cas? Your family is amazing. I haven’t eaten this well in…probably since I left home. Maybe not even then,” Dean answered, thinking back to Bobby’s overly salted and often burnt attempts at cooking.
They had all planned to meet at the bar that evening, either to celebrate or to make up for the loss. Dean was glad it was a celebration.
Cas gently scraped his teeth over the nipple and this time Dean gasped out for real. His hands flew to Cas’s hair and gripped it almost painfully tight, and Cas tried to lift his head, wondering if what he was doing was still okay. Dean immediately pushed him back down and Cas smiled against his skin, switching to the other side to even things out.
“Michael is playing for a charity event tonight at eight and Gabriel bought two tickets for each of us so we could bring a girlfr.. a guest. He didn’t tell me about it until just now and if you’re interested, I have the extra ticket.” Cas’ words tumbled out.
But what if Dean read it here, in class? What if the teacher saw the note and confiscated it? Cas had poured his heart out in those lines. The thought of anyone except for Dean reading his words was enough to keep him frozen in his seat.
He tucked the mask under one arm and stalked over to a rack of capes, flicking through dragonskin, purple velvet, silk, and sheer lace until he found a plain glossy black one. He pulled it out triumphantly and was delighted to find it was scalloped at the bottom, sort of like bat wings. He inspected the corners and found that it had little straps for your wrists.
The whole situation made him angry and frustrated, and Sam wisely avoided his dark mood by hiding in the bunker library.
He creaked open the oven and found a cooled plate of heart shaped pancakes. He set them on the table with an amused smirk. He had completely forgotten that today was Valentine’s day.
Once everyone was off the field and in the change room, Jody clipped her pen to her board and looked up at the boys.
The thought made his stomach swoop and Dean slowly extricated himself from the bed before things took an embarrassing twist. He wanted to hope that there was a chance, but he knew hope was a dangerous thing. But still…what kind of guy invites another guy into their bed and cuddles them unless they aren’t slightly…
“What’s wrong,” Bal asked immediately, setting his bowl down on the table. Cas sighed and collapsed into a kitchen chair. Leave it to his best friend to have a fine tuned crushed spirit detector.
“Let's get going,” John said, rising from his crouch with a few stiff pops from his knees. He slung his gun over his shoulder and walked back out of the forest the way they came in. Dean scrambled to pick himself up off the ground like a properly dignified man, and ran to catch up to his father.
The thought, the possibility that maybe Cas saw him that way, didn’t bother him as much as he thought it would have. He felt oddly at peace instead. Dean snapped the album shut before he could get all mopey over it and quickly grabbed another one.
“If you’re amenable,” Cas started, slowly, hesitantly. “I think I’d like to take things slowly? To just see where this goes?”
He ended up driving to the mall the morning of Cas’s birthday and wandering around all sorts of odd little curiosity shops until he happened upon a large jar shaped like a cartoon honey hive. It was
Rinsed out glass dripping softly into the bottom of the drying rack, Castiel grabbed his worn out shoes and his skateboard, and locked the door behind him. His usual shortcut across the soccer field got him to Charlie’s house in five minutes flat.
The roughness of the sidewalk was suddenly unbearable, and Dean realized with a flush of embarrassment that he was just
“Move,” he demanded, so Dean did. He pulled back and sunk slowly into Cas again. Cas kissed him once.
Dean sighed and followed Cas back outside. They walked at a leisurely pace to the hotel and up to their room. Cas turned on the oven and slid the pie inside, then put the ice cream in the freezer.
His fingers moved at impossible speed, buttoning his jeans back up and shoving his shirt back on so quickly that it was inside out. He didn’t
Dean didn’t answer this time, just clenched his jaw and looked away. Cas let out a laugh, which was beyond inappropriate for the situation, but also not something his crazed mind had any control over at the moment. They were sitting on the warm sidewalk. Bloody. After having just been beaten up by Dean’s
Cas hesitated at the door and Dean raised an eyebrow at him. “You can look through some old albums while you wait. If you want,” Cas added quickly.
Cas picked up the filthy clothes and stuck them straight into the washing machine on a speed cycle. He shucked off his own jacket and hung it by the door, then turned to the kitchen. His original plan was to make roasted potatoes and some braised chicken for lunch, but that would take at least an hour and Dean looked gaunt and hungry. He pulled a box of Kraft dinner from a cupboard and set the water to boil.
It seemed impossible that so many notes could flow out of a single instrument, that it was just one person on stage playing. Dean was transfixed. His heart pounded and he felt alive, full of both wonder and fear.
Dean felt his jaw go slack. He had intended not to react, to make sure his friend felt accepted and safe, but it was impossible not to. The wings were folded tight against Cas’s back, but even folded they couldn’t hide their size. Each wing was easily twice as long as Dean was tall.
Castiel waited for him to draw a number line, but he just stared blankly at the page, blinking at it like the answer would pop up if he gave it long enough. It never did, and as Castiel debated with himself on whether he should point Dean in the right direction, the other boy reddened a little. After a minute, Dean dropped his head into his hands and tipped to look at Cas.
Dean tipped his head to look at him and could have died then and there. His cheeks were flushed, his eyes were shining in the crappy living room lighting, and he looked happier than Dean had ever seen him.
Oh. That wasn’t dangerous. He looked around the room and his eyes landed on a little coffee maker setup. There were two spoons wrapped in plastic with little napkins folded inside. He held them up triumphantly.
Except… Cas heard him. His hands were off of Dean that very second, his body lifted up, and when Dean didn’t make eye contact, when the tension didn’t drain out of his body, when he didn’t breathe, Cas scooted back half a foot. All pressure, all contact was off.
“Do your worst,” Cas answered defiantly. Dean couldn’t handle that smug look on his upside down face. He slid out from under him and threw a leg over his waist, a knee on either side of Cas, caging him in. Dean dragged his hands from Cas’s waistband and slowly up his chest, his neck, and buried them in his hair, tugging softly. He leaned down, sinuously slow, and pressed a feather light kiss to Cas’s breathless mouth.
floated out from under the costume and Cas dumped the last of their candy into the child’s overstuffed pillowcase, then waved his sparky pink wand at their retreating back. Dean snorted beside him and adjusted his cowboy hat.
“Alright who’s good at roasting?” He asked, offering the sticks out. Castiel eased Hazel off his lap and took one, as did Anna and Raphael.
“Got it. Two sandwiches coming right up.” Gabriel gave them both a thumbs up. “You may resume holding hands,” he said, ducking out of the room and shutting the door.
Two more days passed and Cas broke his radio silence and messaged Dean on every number he could think of, asking if everything was okay and when he would be home. That’s all he really wanted, he realized. For Dean to be
Sam beamed at the same time as John scoffed. Dean shovelled another forkful of the pasta into his mouth so he wouldn’t have to take a side. The sauce was smoky and despite the crunchiness of some pieces, it was the best damn thing he had eaten in weeks. It was
Dean flipped through the package again. “Look man, I’ll be honest with you. I haven’t even heard of most of these. I swear I’ll do my part for the actual project but I’m lost when it comes to picking a book. You just choose whatever you like and we’ll do it. As long as it isn’t a chick flick.”
The opposing team looked menacing dressed entirely in bright red, and they won the first kickoff, but the game pretty much went downhill for them from there. Gordon stole the ball and weaved it between another players legs, passed it to Kevin, who kicked it hard across the field to Azazel, who sunk it straight into the net.
Dean let out a short laugh. “Yeah dude its because you probably grew a whole foot since last year ended.”
Castiel nodded and crumpled his wax paper into a ball, holding out his hand for Dean’s paper too. The boys walked briefly back up to Castiel’s room to get Dean’s bag, then back out front to the Impala.
The water, though breathtakingly cold, felt nice on Dean’s still somewhat mottled skin. He leaned backwards and let the water take his weight. Felt the gentle pull of the brook that wasn’t quite strong enough to move him anywhere. The rocks underfoot were slippery with moss, and Cas, who was still standing, desperately trying to keep as much of his body out of the water as possible, slipped and crashed down gloriously.
Cas tore the pouch open and dumped the mixture inside too quickly, making a little mushroom cloud of flour.
before. It’s always been rough. Maybe sometimes I think I’d want it, but usually I just didn’t care what happened to me when it started.”
“Well, thank fuck,” Dean muttered under his breath, pulling the car in park beside his brother’s. He stepped out and Cas followed, eyes shifting around for signs of danger. He knew the monster was technically
The doors to the school banged open and Cas didn’t wait to hear them close. He didn’t stop for red lights, or cars, or pedestrians. He ignored all the horns, all the cusses sent his way as he cut in front of people.
Hannah desperately wanted to race, and Balthazar desperately wanted a breath holding competition, and after three tied games of rock, paper, scissors, a decision still hadn’t been made. Cas stepped in as peacemaker, and decided that they should do a breath competition, and when the last person came up, that would be their cue to race to the end of the pool.
Cas doesn’t respond, just pulls him in for a hug once again. Dean inhales his scent, somewhere between clean clothes and strong wind. He turns his face so his nose is pressed up against Cas’s throat, and he inhales again. The exposed skin that had driven him mad an hour ago still drives him mad, but for an entirely different reason.
This may be taboo, but I’ve decided to share my (very) rough outline because screw it, we’re working on this together now. I may as well give you guys credit for most of these ideas anyways, and this way you have a chance to request any scenes you want to see before it’s over.
“Not anymore. My father left about eighteen years ago, I don’t really remember him. I live with three of my brothers. The other one moved out. I have a sister as well but she moved out too.”
Once the timer ran out, the cheerleaders exploded back onto the field with a fresh chant. Dean lined up with his team to shake hands with the opposition, who would go home tonight defeated. He was exhilarated, buzzing after the win.
Dean stood and carefully navigated his way around the various bottles Cas had opened. The strips were all in the negative, but Dean looked closely at them anyways. They were fragments of the world, as seen through Cas’s eyes.
Something hit the back of his head and he crashed to the ground, rolling away and trying to stand even though his vision was swimming. His machete clattered out of his hand.
“Sorry Miss, just want to clarify, are you saying the equation is only true from that point forward, or from that point backward?” Dean looked over at the curly haired girl who had spoken. He was confused too, but so confused that he didn’t even understand her question.
“How are you doing Cas?” Dean asked as he pulled out some saline and a stitching kit, kneeling down to get closer to the gash.
“Cas,” Dean said, his voice broken. He dragged a hand over his face as though that would erase the evidence of his tears. He waved the letter weakly. “What is this, man? What game are you playing?” The words might have stung, but there was no heat behind them. Dean sounded shattered, like he truly thought Cas was messing with him in the worst possible way.
Dean fixed him with a long look, debating whether or not to tell him what happened. He was unsure what happened himself. With a sigh, he decided maybe he could use another brain to help him get out of this potential mess.
It was such a ridiculous dream. Made even more so in the grey hours of morning, after a hunt, when he’d spend upwards of an hour scrubbing dried blood off his skin. Watching it swirl, rusted and brown, down the drain.
“What?” Dean asked, immediately scanning the kitchenette looking for threats. Maybe a fire or a hidden creep or something.
“It’s fine. Excuse me,” The doctor said, trying to shoulder his way past. Cas stepped in front of him again.
Cas was panting against him, moaning and gasping in a way that only someone who never had to learn to be quiet could do. Dean was impossibly turned on by it. He delighted in each sound he drew from the ex angel’s mouth.
“You um — Can you..stay? I need help.” He admitted, reaching back again and trying uselessly to scratch through the feathers.
It was pure torture, running in the sweltering summer heat, but the sun had already started to dip lower and the team was actually working well together. Dean was impressed by the number of passes and the speed of some of his chosen players.
They waded out and made a pit stop by the abandoned court to grab their shirts before heading over to the fire pits. The sun was starting to set, but someone had already lit two of the fires and a group was huddled close to the wood and was lighting the third.
“Can I walk you?” Dean asked, sounding strangled. Half hopeful. But hopeful for what? Probably that Cas would refuse. That he wouldn’t make him stay one second longer.
“I remember my first day of high school,” Gabriel started wistfully, stabbing at his pancakes with a fork. “I got numbers for half the grade by the time the day was over. Slept through most of them by the end of September.”
But this wasn’t a fling. This was the real thing, and the knowledge both lit a heat in his chest and pulled taut a thread that felt near to snapping. If he messed this up, there would be no forever.
Dean tore his eyes away before he could be caught staring, but Castiel didn’t seem to have noticed, because this face lit up with sudden excitement.
This is what Castiel saw. He saw the beauty in these slices of time that everyone else breezed past with their eyes closed.
He closed the door, undid the latch, and opened it wide. The man was swaying. He looked like someone had put him through a meat grinder.
“Good morning Dean,” Cas said with a bright smile. That was another thing that had changed. His expressions were clear as day now, more varied than they had ever been. When Cas was an angel, he didn’t quite know how to maneuver his face to show what he was thinking. Now that he was human, he didn’t know how to shield his face to hide it.
He found Cas in the room he had claimed, a loose sprawl over his perfectly made bed. A bed that he now had to use nightly. There were so many things Cas had to adjust to so quickly, it was amazing he hadn’t had a breakdown yet.
“If you call I’m outta here,” Dean threatened. Cas looked at him and saw that he was serious. There was a set to his jaw that told Cas he would not be getting his way this time.
Cas could have written entire novels about the emotions that flitted across Dean’s face. Shock, disbelief, confusion, sadness, anger, shame, then a hard closed off look. Cas watched as the stones fell into place, as the wall was built.
Dean wanted to call out, to ask Sam how his day was, if he felt safe… but an aching feeling in his chest stopped him short. Sam made friends, got attached so easily. Usually it caused Dean to worry, because he was the one who handled the damage control when John whisked them someplace new. But this time, seeing his brother throw his head back and laugh, seeing his carefree walk, his weightless shoulders – it sparked something different.
The pause lasted for a few charged seconds before Cas leaned forward, dropping Dean unceremoniously onto his back on the bed and following him down to press his weight into him.
“Then you go get her. Go prove to her that she’s wrong. Show up at her door with the world’s most massive
“Dean,” Cas said gently once he had finished talking. He wasn’t quite sure where to go from there, so the lamest thing slipped out of his mouth.
The conversation around dinner flowed easily, and Dean eventually relaxed enough to join in on the light banter. Cas was by far the quietest of all the siblings, but it was clear they all sought his opinion and listened attentively whenever he spoke.
“It’s getting late,” Hannah said, eyeing her watch. Cas looked up at the sky. The sun was long gone and all that was left was the reflection of the city lights in the clouds.
Castiel didn’t even realize how hard he was shaking until his brother laid a hand at his throat and the eerie stillness of it shocked him.
Castiel finally looked away, suddenly feeling completely overwhelmed, and vaguely like he had done something wrong, when his eyes locked with Sam, who was propped up on one elbow and watching the exchange through wide eyes from across the room.
“So you’re telling me its either me or you? You take me apart to get your bit of grace back or you die slowly and painfully?”
Dean pretended to consider the proposal, but he was already all for it. Ice cream over biology readings? That was a
It took several achingly long days before Bobby let Dean get up and move around. Several more before he let him leave the house, and only then, it was because Cas
The word was rock solid and left no room for debate. Instead of relief, Dean felt crushed. He felt like a failure.
Dean huffed, knowing it was absolutely true. His nerd brother was either helping Bobby around the auto shop, or buried in his books. He had a determination to end up a lawyer like no other kid ever had before him. He could imagine Sam hitting the books even harder now that he was in twelfth grade and universities would be open for applications in a few months.
“Are you okay?” Cas repeated softly, tangling a hand into Dean’s hair and ignoring the tug on his taped IV.
He wanted to live, of course he did, but he had done this to the angel, his closest friend. If he had caused this then he must also fix it.
“Oh.” Cas said, sounding somewhat confused. He took an audible breath as if he was steeling himself for something difficult.
Who knows how much time passed? Enough for the water to have cooled significantly. Cas pushed his hands into Dean’s chest and leaned up slightly, looking
The classes he had to take for his program were either heavy mathematical things about calculating blood splatter angles and identifying bullet types from wound characteristics, or heavy science things about chemicals and the human body.
She threw an arm over his shoulders in a quick and purposeful embrace before pulling back and scanning him up and down.
One picture was of Gabriel’s back as he jumped off a cliff into the water below. His hair was sticking straight up and his body slightly blurred from the speed of his fall.
He carefully shuffled his papers on the desk, dropping his eyes as he considered what to say to get Dean’s hackles down. “No, but I will help you if you have questions,” Cas answered mildly. Dean squinted at him. Something shifted in his eyes, like he was trying to read Cas - to figure out what game he was playing - and he’d just gotten his answer.
This would not last long. It was too much. The smell of Cas was heady and filled the room, a manly musky scent that drove Dean insane. He wanted to inhale it all. The wings fluttering and trembling at his touch, brushing over his arms and leaving the skin buzzing and alive. The sweet friction where Cas was moving against him. It was all too much. Dean felt like he was going to finish in his pants like a freaking teenager.
“Aww gross keep it PG,” Gabriel complained from the couch, but he was smirking too hard for it to come across as serious.
“Dean you would need to touch my wings.” Castiel looked up at Dean, eyes full of shame. He looked like he was waiting to be laughed at or dismissed. As if he had just asked the most disgusting and inconceivable thing.
a place long enough for it to feel like his. But that might seem like some sort of sob story, and Dean really
Hannah’s jaw dropped. She looked entirely betrayed, but Charlie laughed maniacally and darted upstairs for a banana. Hannah took it from her like it was about to explode.
Once the world stopped spinning and he had his breath back properly, Dean nodded, then stood properly and shook everything out. He didn’t actually feel like he was hurt that bad, sure he would probably be sore later, but for now he was mostly just annoyed at the player who had slammed into him.
“I don’t,” Gabriel admitted after a beat. This was a conversation they had had hundreds of times. Thousands. “But I do know that he’s one hell of a tough guy. Whatever is happening, wherever he is, he will be okay. If that tattoo hasn’t vanished by now, It’s not going to.”
He plopped down into a seat near the front, and turned to smile at the redheaded girl who was already seated beside him.
After scrambling and fighting for dominance, Castiel found himself pinned to the ground, a forearm pressed tight to his throat and his arms somehow twisted underneath him. He looked up at his attacker, fully prepared to beg for his life, when he saw startlingly familiar eyes looking down at him.
Cas snorted. “Picasso. And…those guys were legends. Are legends. I guess I sell pieces too, but I doubt I’ll ever be anything like them, Dean.”
Dean’s heart leapt in his chest and he may or may not have picked up the pace. He took the steps two at a time and when he exited on the landing for his floor, a thick smell of garlic and herbs hit him. He unlocked his door to find Cas stirring something on the stove and bopping to the blasting music.
One look out the window told him it was almost sunrise anyways, no harm in getting his run in a little early.
Dean squeezed his side, hoping he knew he didn’t have to go on, but Cas took a deep breath and continued anyways.
Castiel flew so fast that the pang of guilt barely had time to hurt properly before he flapped to a stop in the middle of the small motel room, sending up his own prayer of thanks that the boys were so close.
Dean didn’t give him any time to process. He pushed the call button for a nurse to come, then took Cas’s hand and pulled him from the room.
Hello all! Its been a while (burns all calendars so you can't tell me how long its actually been). This is part one of the "Dean's POV" chapter, I just don't have the energy to write the second part tonight and I'm also starved for some feedback (to the point where I didn't want to post earlier because I was feeling lame). But anywho. Posting this now. I realize this note may not even make sense because I am loopy with exhaustion lol. I saw a bear AND a deer on my way home tonight. (my enter key is also broken so this note is just gonna be one big block. sorry.) Trigger warning for homophobic language and a physical fight. Love you all! Let me know what you thought! Oh and please go send CasuallyNeurotic some love. They are the world's best beta and I'm beginning to think they should maybe have edited this note....
Cas nodded in response and leaned up an inch to give Dean a peck on the lips. They pushed through the crowd and Dean wrestled his way into the change room for his duffle bag. Most of the guys had already cleared out their stuff. Some were in the showers.
Dean stood and pulled out a first aid kid from the supply closet, checking to see how much was in there. Sam was right, they were running low on many things, but Dean hoped that the gauze and stitching equipment that was left would be enough for now.
“What? Just because angels don’t usually eat doesn’t mean they can’t. Besides, if it might help then why not try it?” Sam asked defensively, knocking the spoon he was stirring with against the edge of the pot a few times before placing it in the sink and setting the pot on a spare cutting board on the table.
When his dad cleaned the guns, Dean watched attentively. The next time John had cleaned them, Dean had wordlessly picked one up, disassembled it, gently wiped out the dust, refilled the bullets, and oiled it with tiny, careful fingers. The time after that, John had just dropped the bag on the table and pointed. Dean had already known what to do.
Dean was tense, pacing. Skin zinging and buzzing with anxiety. Cas didn’t know Sam when he had a soul, but even so he could tell that things had broken a little between him Dean since he lost it. The pain of that was not lessened when Sam chose to hunt with his grandfather, leaving his bother behind.
Cas slipped his hand into Dean’s and offered him a small smile, tugging him towards the garden as well.
Castiel internally laughed at himself. Of course in a moment of panic all he would think of was his most recent read.
Cas stared down at him for a shocked moment before he realized he was standing over an actively bleeding person. Oh and the neighbours were also probably watching.
“Yeah like hell you are. You’re hurt, I’m calling an ambulance,” Cas said, trying to keep the panic out of his voice as he reached into his pocket for his phone.
Dean coughed on his first try, but eventually managed to squeak out some sort of response despite the chaos in his brain. He somehow managed not to turn around and kiss the hell out of Cas, but it was a close thing.
Dean gave him an even look. “Theres no going back once I tell you. Please believe me when I say there are things out there you’d rather not know about.”
“Onetwothree!” Balthazar yelled in a rush. Hannah started to protest but both boys took huge gulps of air and plunged their heads recklessly into the water. She had no choice but to follow suit.
“Shut up Raf, its way past her bedtime,” Anna said quietly. “Speaking of which, we should be heading in.” She gently lifted Hazel from Dean and tucked her into her shoulder. Dean felt suddenly very cold and exposed, so he stood as well.
“Have a seat!” Gabriel said loudly, tugging him down into the chair beside his. The girls were back on him immediately, stroking manicured nails up his arms and down his chest.
“You piece of shit,” John snarled, standing fluidly. He looked down at Dean with a searing hatred in his eyes, then kicked out again. Hard.
Dean reached out and drew Cas closer until he was curled around him, head on his chest, one leg thrown over his, arm slung over his waist. He laid there, breathing in time with Cas, wondering how he had ever gotten so lucky.
There was clearly no changing his stubborn mind, so Cas swallowed, and did perhaps the hardest thing he had ever had to do. He nodded curtly, and pulled Dean in for a tight hug.
“Dean its okay, whatever happened you’re okay. You’re safe. Please talk to me, I’m right here.” Cas murmured softly. He was holding Dean so tightly it seemed like he was determined to keep him from shaking apart.
In a flash, the man who Dean had thought was knocked out turned and gave him a solid backhand blow across his face. Dean twisted and fell from the force. His hands were pulled tight behind him. A weight settled across his back.
They had walked to the lot where Cas usually parked his car, and Dean slid into the passenger’s seat. Normally, he got nervous if he wasn’t driving, but with Cas, it was so easy to lie back and live. Plus it helped that Cas followed road rules to the letter.
By the time Dean stepped out of the shower, his muscles were loose and relaxed, throbbing significantly less. He patted his skin dry and tried to ignore the mottled bluish purple tinge of his torso in the fogged mirror. With careful movements, he pulled on his boxers and the worn flannel pyjama bottoms and washed-out shirt he had grabbed.
The lingered there for a few minutes, each picking a handful of the autumn blooms. Dean chose a couple sprays of small purple flowers.
when he brought the sharp cool metal against the pale exposed stretch of his inner arm, pressed down, and sliced.
By the time he made his way to the field, coach Mills was already setting up some cones for drills and several of the boys on the team were helping. About 15 that he didn’t recognize were already on the sidelines stretching, paper numbers pinned to their shirts. Dean ducked into the change room to put on his uniform and jogged back out to lend a hand.
“What will you do then?” He asked, part of him hoping that Dean would swear off hunting because of this. It was selfish, but in the seconds it took Dean to answer, Cas had already imagined a life for them. He imagined coming home from work to find Dean sprawled on the sofa in just his socks and sweats. He imagined kissing his soft lips and cooking together and taking long walks in the cool evening air.
“Well, don’t. I owe you nothing,” Dean snapped. He was instantly embarrassed for lashing out, couldn’t even explain to
The guy was leaning in the chair like he owned the room and was slightly bored with everyone in it. His leather jacket was carelessly unzipped over a deep blue shirt. His jeans were tattered and faded, but the stretch of them hinted at thick thigh muscles. Cas shifted, his own jeans suddenly a little too tight.
“Yeah well, I didn’t spend the last eight years just watching you smelly boys kick a ball around,” coach Mills scrunched her nose.
Dean touched the spot again to try and see if he had somehow made Cas bleed, and Cas roughly wrenched away when Dean’s hand made contact.
Dean took a huge bite of his burger and chewed twice before turning to Cas. “So what do you want to do tonight?”
“Well I apologize for having a schedule,” Dean answered, putting a hand over his heart in mock offence.
He teased at first, light sucks and feathery kisses, but soon fell into a steady rhythm. Cas was breathing heavily from above him and Dean felt a hand thread through his hair. He lifted off with a pop.
“So what does the rest of your family do Cas? You said four brothers and a sister? What about your mom?”
” He took a sudden step closer to Dean, puffing his chest outward, but Dean didn’t move. Didn’t flinch.
“Might be who I’m thinking of. Castiel Novak. He hung around taking photos of the team during some of our games and I caught him afterwards once. Nice guy to talk to.”
“We’ll cream you next time brother,” Benny promised, clapping a hand over Dean’s sweat soaked shoulder and then wiping it on his shorts in mock disgust.
John roughly dragged a hand over the stubble on his chin and looked down at his bleeding son with frustration. After a beat, he reached a hand down to Dean, who looked at it like it was a bomb.
Cas stood and held a hand out to Dean, who took it and allowed himself to be led into his room. Cas waited until Dean settled down on his usual side of the bed, then he crawled in behind him and curled himself against Dean’s back, hand going over his waist to pull him closer.
Cas snapped the wings out of sight and looked up at him from his slump on the sofa with a guilty look on his face.
“Dean I want to be clear, you’re always welcome here. The door will always be open for you.” The words felt lame in Castiel’s mouth, but he didn’t know how to get across to Dean that he was
“Yeah, its mine,” Dean admitted. He was unsure of how he felt about Gabriel. The man seemed to be unpredictable.
That seemed so long ago now. He wondered where the time had gone and what went wrong along the way. It was hard to sort out his emotions. When his father was alive, he respected him out of fear. Every order, every suggestion, was followed immediately. He would spend hours trying to think ahead and anticipate, because if his father thought he should have done something and it wasn’t done, that was already enough to warrant a good beating. Dean was always terrified, always maximally stressed, but he got so good and putting on a mask. He became a safe spot for both Adam and Sam, even his mother when she would allow it. Nothing got to him, he never rebelled, was always calm and helpful on the outside.
Cas managed a small smile despite his nerves. He reached out to help but it didn’t seem like Dean required anything of him. Dean bit his bottom lip and hooked both sides of the skin through the needle, pulling the thread neatly through.
And maybe it’s because they were suddenly out of sight that Cas could speak again. His words came tumbling out, hitched and warped between his spastic inhales.
Dean turned and found his face inches away from a pair of very pillowy, barely contained breasts. He eased back.
In that moment, Dean turned his head in his sleep and planted the softest of kisses in Castiel’s palm, completely unaware of his actions. Castiel felt a dark blush crawl up his face and he removed his hand and stood in one fluid motion, unable to tear his eyes away from Dean.
Cas stretched up and kissed Dean’s cheek, then snuggled back against his chest and let sleep claim him.
Dean quirked an eyebrow, confused, then sputtered as he realized what Gabriel was getting at. No, no, no he had to fix this right now. He swallowed the giant bite.
It’s his worst nightmare, except this time he has to live it out for real. He doesn’t even try to muffle his heart wrenching sobs as he slits Cas’s throat. He doesn’t even try to move out of the way of the blood spurts as he holds the only man he has ever truly loved tight to his chest. He doesn’t fight it as his own breathing stutters and hitches right alongside Cas’s gasping death rattle. And he never recovers.
Hidden speakers made sporadic sounds. Static and bats, creaking wood, the occasional scream. Actors draped in moulded cloth strips darted in front of them and skeletons hung from the high ceiling.
Castiel gently guided Dean onto his stomach on the sofa, then crawled to the floor and kneeled beside him, the show and snacks all but forgotten. Two warm hands pressed down on Dean’s shoulder with a delicious pressure, and Dean bit back a groan. Cas was meticulous, working out every knot, and slowly, very slowly, Dean began to relax into his grip.
“Well we’re heading back now to shower and change, then probably taking a walk downtown to get dinner. Care to join?”
“Is this alright?” Dean whispered by his ear. Castiel nodded and Dean shifted closer, pressing their hips and chests together. Castiel shut his eyes and guided them slowly to lean back against the large cushy chair. He squeezed at Dean’s hips, revelling in the solid weight of him on his lap. He had only met the man a few times, and those times were confusing and far between, but Cas already knew he had never felt anything as good as Dean’s weight pressing into him.
Maybe it was the quiet ease of a real home made dinner, maybe it was Castiel’s steady presence, but Dean went on to elaborate without further prompting. Actually, the words tumbled out of him like water from a smashed dam.
“Well,” Cas started, tugging Dean in for a loose hug. His frilly purple tutu scrunched up between them. “I was going to develop some photos tonight. Wanna hang out while I do that?”
“Yeah, fine my ass.” He walked into his bedroom and Dean followed him, completely confused as he watched him pull out a pair of sweatpants and drop them on the bed.
Holding a weapon calmed him down significantly, tightened the wild spiral of his thoughts closer to the constraints of his brain. He slowed his walking and breathed a little, and was entirely focused on his breathing when the blade suddenly bit into the pad of his thumb.
When he made it back to bed, Dean was still a limp puddle of muscle. Cas slipped under the covers and curled into Dean, who immediately put an arm around Cas, tugging him closer.
“Oh really now?” Cas asked. His voice was low. Sweeter and quieter, as if meant to draw Dean in. Dean tipped his head to the side and was surprised to find that Cas was already looking his way. Even more surprised to find that there was a certain lust in his eyes. A want that Dean knew
“NO,” Dean said firmly, catching his wrist in his hand. Dean’s fingers were ice cold and covered in a mix of blood and black goo.
Dean woke, and the first thing he noticed was that the bunker was eerily quiet. The usual bustling sounds of Sam and Eileen going through their morning routine were absent. Cas, who was surprisingly clumsy in the kitchen, could not be heard.
Sooooo I found a place! I'm moving in a week and a half and honestly guys, it has been a rough ride. There has been a lot of pushback, and way too many moments where I questioned if I was doing the right thing. The situation seemed to be getting better, which was mostly why I was confused if it was all in my head, but the last few days shit hit the fan again and I realize now that this isn't going to resolve itself so easily. I'm moving about three hours away, literally into the woods up in cottage country. Got a new job, and everything will be changing. I'll be starting from scratch, furniture, towels, pots, you name it. That being said, I feel so light. So much happier about this. I look forward to being safe in my own space and having me all to myself. Having control over my body and my time. Thank you to everyone who supported me and wished me well, you've given me strength and courage to take this step. A couple more days and it will be done. Thank you also for being patient with me while I get my life in order. I love writing, but god knows every time I sat down to do it crisis arose. Love you all!
“Thanks,” Dean said. He adjusted the marshmallow to make sure it was stuck on properly, then plunged it straight into the flames, lighting it on fire.
Charlie smiled sweetly at him and promised to send some photos as soon as she finished editing. Cas waved her off, now honestly curious about what shots she could have possibly gotten while they were walking. He checked to make sure his phone and keys were still in his jacket and took off for the forest once more.
There was an atmosphere of excitement in the change room, all the players were pumped and ready to go for their first game of the season. Home games were always wild; students came out decked head to toe in navy and white, waving giant foam fingers and sporting huge mugs of beer. The noise from the stadium could be heard as a low rumble in the change room.
Cas held his breath for the rest of the class. His thoughts were flitting along so quickly that by the time the bell rang, he hadn’t taken a single note, and still hadn’t decided what to do with this new, incredibly precious information.
Dean woke feeling like he had been battling leviathans all night instead of sleeping. He ran his hands through his hair and over his face, trying to shake off the half conscious fog before roughly swinging out of the bed and to the closet. He pulled out a pair of clean jeans, and the next clean flannel and t-shirt in the pile, then stumbled into the bathroom closest to his room for a hot shower. Ten minutes later, he stepped into the hallway freshly shaved, more awake, and less drunk than he would like to be.
shoulders, the bulge of a bicep, tanned skin, hundreds of little freckles on his arms, and...a bandage?
“You can’t do that if you don’t know where he is, if you don’t have a visual on him at all times. What if some vamp came and snatched him on his way home? Then what would you do?”
“I have to find Sammy,” He said, scanning the room quickly before seeming to realize he had brought nothing with him.
Dean, to his surprise, pulled out a rumpled looking duffle bag from the backseat before following Castiel inside. Dean shrugged at Cas’s curious look.
“Maybe you should be,” Dean answered, a small amount of his usual snappiness flooding back into his tone. His eyes flashed defiantly, but Cas knew now that it was just a defence. It was just a mask.
I know I should come up with some sort of updating schedule, but I get too excited to hear from you guys as soon as I have a chapter written and I need feedback because I’m weak so I always end up posting right away. Take this as a gift for waiting so patiently for the last chapter.
entailed, because all his previous flings had been quick. The length of only a day or two. Mere distractions. Times when he’d flirted and sweet-talked a girl into taking a stroll with him by the riverside. Into burgers at the diner. Mostly just to prove to himself that he
The guy flicked his hands dry, spraying drops of water all over the floor. “Michael.” He shouldered past Cas, who stepped easily out of his way. “Nice shirt,” Michael scoffed over his shoulder on his way out. Castiel turned back towards the mirror and smiled a little. It
Cas pulled Dean up and into his lap with unnatural strength. He kissed hungrily down Dean’s jaw and sucked a dark mark on his neck. Dean groaned and moved to push Cas backwards onto the bed when his wings flung out from behind him, giving a powerful flap and lowering them both down gently. The lamp on the nightstand crashed to the ground, but neither man noticed. They were hungry, starved for each others touches, lips, murmured words.
Cas slid back into the kitchen in his socks, refilled his coffee mug, then pulled a notebook out of his backpack. He checked the time on the microwave and saw that he had half an hour before he really needed to get ready for school.
The drive to Castiel’s house was no less breathtaking the second time around. Dean parked the car near the edge of the roundabout and hesitated before the large front door. His phone pinged.
He knew he shouldn’t. Knew he was playing a dangerous game with his heartstrings. But he shifted closer in the warm grass until he was pressed to Cas’s side, close enough that he could feel the wet droplets of water on Cas’s skin. The heat of the skin underneath.
Up at the corner of the wall, a curved mirror caught his eye. It’s warped image gave a view down the hallway, and down that hallway was a horribly disfigured…thing. Cas squinted and it turned, looking right at him through the reflection of the mirror. He reeled back. It’s face was half rotted, the bleach white of bone overlaid with peeling strips of flesh.
“Morning Dean” Sam said cautiously, jerking his head towards the half full coffee pot. Years of experience had conditioned him to not to let too much of the morning pass without caffeinating Dean properly.
“I am so sorry. They wouldn’t let me in unless I was related and it just slipped out,” Dean said in a rush. Cas shook his head to tell him he had nothing to be sorry for. The bandages made crinkling noises and Dean’s hand immediately threaded into his hair.
“That sounds fun,” Tanya said, stretching up to kiss Gordon. He immediately wrapped her up in his arms and pulled her closer. It didn’t look like they intended to pull apart anytime soon.
“You good, Dean?” John asked, flicking his eyes briefly to his eldest son. For a moment, Dean debated telling him that no, he was far from good, it felt like his bones were on fire and someone had blended up his brains and poured them back into his skull, but even as he thought of saying it he knew it was pointless. There was nothing his dad could or would do about it. There was nothing to stitch, nothing left to pop back into place, so there was nothing to fix.
“Yes. Its a concert in the Royal Hall, all proceeds go towards supporting education for girls in Afghanistan.”
Dean woke well before his alarm feeling rested and ready for the day. He went through his usual routine, a run, a shower, and a quick breakfast, then decided to get coffee from a shop on his way to school. The beauty of waking early was the luxury of time.
Cas looked up at him and Dean felt like he could see right through him, read him all the way to his very soul. He hoped Cas would find what he was looking for there.
Benny gave him a crooked smile and shook his head. He laid a long plastic bag with a hanger sticking out the top over the couch.
Behind the counter stood a middle aged woman that looked like she would give good hugs. The place was… quaint. The perfect study spot. He never would have gone in unless Cas had suggested it to him.
By the time he stepped out in a pair of dark blue cotton lounge pants and a plain white t-shirt, Cas was in the kitchen, leaning against the counter in black and red flannel pants and a black v-neck.
The boy looked down, as if he had forgotten what he was wearing. The simple action made something in Dean’s chest squirm.
Cas added in his mind. Looking at the man though, Castiel couldn’t imagine a single sinister thing about him. He looked tired, worn down and abused; like he had had his fair share of misery in life. Besides. He couldn’t be more than what, 19? 20?
?” John repeated, face red and screwed up with anger. His breath was hot and smelled like nothing at all. Dean curled in on himself, half wishing his dad was drunk right now. If he had been, he could have discounted this as nothing more than a horrible inebriated rage. But no, he had no excuses to make this time. This was John. Pure and sober.
Dean shot a completely betrayed look at Cas, who had indeed finished most of his bowl and was now looking back at Dean almost as if he was going to smile.
Cole laughed. “Yeah right man. When was the last time you spent a planned day with anyone instead of a one night stand?”
“Nothing broke because of you Cas. Look around. I’d give anything to be this close to my family. They love you and
When he got there, he walked right in without knocking and went down the steps to the basement. Both Bal and Hannah were already sprawled over the sofa, controllers in hand, concentration etched on their faces.
He brushed a finger over it, stomach sinking. In the last few years, his soulmate’s injuries had been on and off. Sometimes there were long stretches where no new tattoos appeared. Sometimes Castiel’s skin was littered and dark with them.
to wear these boots.” He stepped out with one leather boot to widen his stance and rested both hands on the large metal clasp of his belt.
The pain that had seemed so refreshing and grounding just minutes ago was now pulsing and throbbing; not unbearable, but definitely annoying, even more so because Dean knew it was
He coughed once, but couldn’t seem to come up with a good explanation as to why he had randomly touched the guy, so he quickly stepped out of the bathroom, muttering something about how the food was ready.
Besides his knowledge, there was a tug in his gut, he knew somehow that he was what Cas needed to heal.
“Nuh uh don’t you dare say you’re fine. You’re sitting there looking all constipated trying to hide your pain but dude, you suck at acting.”
He was lost in thought, wondering how this course would go and opening a blank document on his computer, when a dark haired boy sat in the seat next to him, huffing and out of breath.
“I do now,” Cas smirked back. He didn’t mention that Dean was the only reason he bought it in the first place. He didn’t bring up the fact that keeping his fridge stocked with beer was his own twisted way of apologizing for the horrible misunderstanding of last time. He didn’t tell Dean that he rarely drank, definitely not often enough to warrant buying an entire six pack.
He dragged in a rough breath and suddenly needed to see for himself; to confirm it. He pushed away from Gabriel and made a beeline for the bathroom mirror. The feeling rushed back into his limbs when he saw the horrible handprints were still there, black as a death omen, but still there.
Once the table was cleared and the dishes were washed, Bobby hopped straight onto the computer and registered them for school; Sam to the local junior high and Dean to the local high school. It would be awkward as hell starting over again in the middle of May, senior year, but starting over is something he had done before. Would probably be doing again, if he was honest with himself.
So a month an a half later, when Cas was glumly stirring honey into his tea and the door swung open, he half thought he was hallucinating. But no, Dean was real. Filthy,
The shower water shut off at the same time as the dryer beeped, so Cas gathered up the warm clothes and knocked on the bathroom door.
Gabriel scooped him up like a baby, even though he was a big kid now. He didn’t hold Cas away, even though his swimming shorts were dripping wet.
“You do this in the dark?” Dean asked, watching curiously as Cas filled some shallow basins with liquid from different bottles.
Which is exactly what happened a few minutes later. He shuddered against Cas, who was leaving a trail of hot open mouthed kisses on his neck. Dean would have been embarrassed except for the fact that Cas came with a sharp exhale a couple seconds later.
The formality made Dean’s heart leap. He checked the time. 9:14. Was it too late to invite Cas over? Probably not. But would he come just to hang out?
“Thanks, Sammy,” Dean said, more softly this time. “I’m sorry.” Dean hoped Sam could pick out all the different shades of sorry in those two words. He was sorry for having made him worry, sorry for having gone with John, sorry for getting hurt and making Sam clean him up. Again. The list was endless.
The walk home was pleasant mostly due to the light breeze. October was nearing, and there was already a hint of chill in the air.
Dean fought his way out and crawled onto Benny’s back. He intended to force him down, but Henry climbed up onto Gordon’s shoulders and the pair waded closer, arms out for balance.
“Yeah I like it too buddy but just trust me on this. Cotton is way more comfortable” Dean replied. He got up, knees making an exaggerated popping noise, took his bowl and the empty pot to the sink, and soaped up a sponge to begin washing them.
He scooted lower and without warning, pushed his hands against the firm globes of Dean’s ass. Dean yelped and pushed a hand into the bed, raising himself up just enough to turn and look back at Cas. He looked wrecked. Cas smirked and kneaded his hands down. Dean groaned and flopped back into the pillows, shamelessly pushing his hips back into Cas’s hands.
Dean gritted his teeth and pulled out his toothbrush, spending way longer than strictly necessary cleaning out his mouth. He felt like a coward, but he decided to take a shower before going downstairs. If it turns out he had done something royally stupid while he was vamped out, then he wanted to have one more peaceful shower before his life came crashing down.
“Probably not but it’s sort of in my job description to be a pay as you go shrink,” Cas joked. Okay obviously that wasn’t entirely true but at this point, Cas was curious. He let his gaze wander appreciatively over the man’s large frame. He was tall, but still young enough to not have fully filled out yet.
Dean had barely pulled back onto the road before he reached for Cas’s hand again. He toyed with his fingers the whole way back, and it really shouldn’t have been so sweet, but the simple movements made Cas’s heart leap.
“Would you like to walk outside for a little?” He offered, holding out a hand to tug Dean off the bed.
Behind him, the coffee machine hissed and sputtered and Cas replaced the pot with a mug, ready to catch the first drops. Once his cup filled, he switched it back out with the pot and took a gulp, ignoring the way it burned down his throat. For all the physical and emotional pain he had caused Dean lately, he definitely deserved at
“Last night I asked to see his wings again and I was touching them and this wet stuff came out and Cas freaked and poofed away and now he’s avoiding me and I have no idea what I did but Sam, I think I molested the guy.” Dean finished in an anguished rush.
He couldn’t see Cas’s expression, but he trusted Cas would tell him if he was hurting him or doing something wrong. As his hands massaged and fell into their own rhythm, his mind wandered to his private thinking session from earlier that evening.
there, but neither of those terms felt real anymore. Besides, it was kind of hard to think clearly with his mind racing.
“Nope,” Sam answered, popping the end of the word. “I finished all my homework, I read all my books, and Bobby said he’s almost done in the garage and doesn’t need any help. My room is clean, the dishwasher is empty, and I have nothing at
Dean might have been annoyed at this, but honestly, he was looking forward to figuring Cas out. Besides. This
Cas methodically filled in his answers, mind whirring. When he turned to watch Dean again, he noticed that he hadn’t moved at all. Actually, it looked like he was sleeping, a suspicion which was confirmed when the bell rang and Dean didn’t so much as twitch.
“I don’t really know Dean. Depends what he’s like,” Sam said, taking the information in stride so easily it was as if he had always known. Dean released a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding.
“Brother if you do start craving that make sure you do tell me so I can stay far away from you and your madness.”
Cas slowly, teasingly dragged Dean’s pyjama bottoms and boxers down in one go. He heard the moment Dean’s cock sprang free because he let out a deeply satisfied noise and immediately flipped onto his back. It stretched up towards Dean’s stomach, thick and reddened.
He barely passed his last semester. Heck, he probably wouldn’t have if his teachers hadn’t taken pity on him and bumped his grades up to a D.
The reply came almost instantly, which was a good thing because if this didn’t happen right now then Cas would lose his nerve and it would never happen.
The silence hung for a moment before Cas cleared his throat. “I know you and Sam have spent your whole lives hunting the supernatural, and I do not enjoy reminding you that I am part of that group. You and I were finally getting somewhere and I have been trying very hard to appear normal for you. Human.”
He returned briefly to Dean’s lips, kissing him properly this time, allowing Dean to deepen the kiss and explore his mouth. When he broke away, Dean’s hair was a mess, and he noted with a smirk of satisfaction that he must have been responsible for that.
“Why didn’t they kill us?” Cas asked. He didn’t want to die, of course not, but in times of high stress, the wildest things run through your mind.
Benny leaned over the table to rack the balls up again, and Dean left before the next two contestants could be decided. He made his way back to the bar and ordered another beer. From the stool, he could watch the reactions to the game, and someone must have royally lost a bet because the team went wild and all piled around someone.
It has been a while, friends! Hi! I started writing this just tonight and felt like this was a good stopping point, and despite it being short, CasuallyNeurotic edited (thank you endlessly) and I decided to go ahead and post anyways. More to come in the next few days. The words have started flowing.
“You had better not be here when I get back Ben,” Dean warned, half joking. He grabbed his things and let the door swing shut behind him, knowing Benny would lock up when he left, which would probably only happen once the beer ran out. Dean couldn’t complain, it was fair payment for borrowing the tux.
“Race you in!” Dean shouted. He tore off towards the water and didn’t look back, but he barely reached hip depth before Benny slammed into his side and dragged him under.
good. But all at once the memories flooded in and he tensed. He was suddenly back on that cold concrete floor, pinned down by arms much stronger than his, legs pushed apart by thighs more muscular than his own.
There was nobody in the hallway, so Dean slipped off his shoes and headed upstairs to Cas’s room. He found the door wide open. Cas was sprawled on his bed reading, but sat up and smiled when Dean came in.
Cas swallowed. Ohio was pretty far, but from the torn look on Dean’s face, it was clear that he already knew that. Cas sat gingerly on the sofa. He didn’t know what Dean needed right now, but it definitely wasn’t a glimpse into his erratically selfish heart.
Castiel moved on to crumble some feta cheese into the bowl. Dean seemed absorbed in watching him and Cas let it happen. The silence was comfortable, almost domestic.
Once the pomp and ceremony and photographs were over, the crowd flooded onto the field to congratulate the players. Charlie jogged down and gave Dean a wide grin, snapping shots at random.
“Dean I am so glad you came,” Cas said softly by his ear, relieved in a way that said he really thought Dean might not come.
probably. But he was too wound up. His father wanted to hunt yellow eyes alone? Dean had so much energy he felt like he could obliterate every demon on both Earth and in Hell. Maybe like
“Yeah actually Sammy, why don’t you get him a pair of sweats and some t-shirts. Or some real pyjamas. Nobody should have to wear a suit and tie when they’re that banged up.”
“Fine. Have it your way,” Charlie said, in a tone that clearly said this wasn’t over. “Let’s do something else.” She clicked off the TV and turned to Balthazar with a suggestive raise of her eyebrow.
and before Dean quite knew what he was doing, he reached out and grabbed Cas’s hand again, threading their fingers together. The beaming smile that Cas shot him was like an incinerating fire, burning up every bit of negativity from his mind and leaving only the sure thought that whatever happened, wherever they ended up from here on out, this was not temporary, and they would be okay.
By the time class ended, he had no idea what was discussed and hadn’t taken a single note. He had been trying to work up the courage to slide the note onto Dean’s desk, because he was
He had just stepped into the spray of hot water when there was a rustle in the bathroom and Cas pulled open the shower curtain. He was standing there, very very naked. Dean froze with the shampoo bottle tilted halfway. Every inch of Cas was flawless. His muscles curved gently under perfect skin, and his spent cock hung softly. Dean felt a low swoop in his belly and probably would have hardened again were it not for his complete exhaustion.
, had never sneered at anyone like John so freely did, but he also hadn’t really analyzed his feelings too closely. It was somewhat unsurprising to him that he had so much to work through, so many rancid lessons to unlearn. He’d never had a reason, never had the time or the
“Glad to hear its going well Dean. Do I need to threaten him about breaking my brother’s heart yet?”
Guys....I am so sorry I have been MIA. To say life got in the way is an understatement. Here is the latest instalment, made readable by the heroic efforts of casuallyneurotic. Endless thanks.
“Cas you’re okay. It’s all okay,” Dean murmured by his ear. He knew this demon all too well, the viscous guilt, the back and forth, the mood swings. He was aware that Cas knew his mother’s death wasn’t his fault, but he was also aware that sometimes the logical train of thought just didn’t seem so logical.
Castiel gritted his teeth and willed the nightmare to remove itself from Dean’s mind. He felt the dark tendrils of horror wash out of Dean and into him, where he let his Grace consume the nightmare in an effortless swipe.
The honest admission surprised Dean. Five years ago, he never would have pictured himself leaving the mechanic shop, now here he was with a practical stranger telling him he believed in his dream.
The teacher prattled on about some math concept Dean didn’t have a single hope of understanding. He didn’t even bother listening. Instead, he just let his mind wander, dangerous as that usually was.  It usually turned into a self depreciating spiral, but Dean was pretty sure he couldn’t feel worse than he already did.
It was sweet, the thought of Sam and Eileen bumping around each other in the kitchen making breakfast, but it also lit a mild jealousy in him. He wondered where Cas had been at the time. Sleeping? Curled on the couch reading? Sitting in a chair watching them with that subtle smile of his playing across his face?
Castiel was hurt for all of one second... until he realized what Dean was doing. The way the boy was holding himself was a dead giveaway – he was stiff, shoulders drawn together. Jaw locked. He looked ready for a fight. Put plainly, Dean was embarrassed. And he was acting rude so Castiel either wouldn’t notice, or wouldn’t care.
