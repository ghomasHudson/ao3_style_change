The kids were okay – traumatized – but physically okay. Sam tried his best to put on a cheerful and brave face for the kids, but he was sure they knew something was amiss. The drive to the sheriff’s office was silent. Explaining that he had seen them in the woods while driving, Sam managed to avoid the lengthy questioning he usually got after returning victims to their families. Dread filled him as he realized he now had to return to the barn to not only bury the vampire remains, but also retrieve Dean’s body and begin preparing for a funeral. Sam pulled out his phone, sending a text out to Eileen. He had managed to salvage his relationship with her in the weeks that followed Chuck’s demise. They had begun texting and even meeting up for drinks recently.
“Whatever you say, Angel. I’m getting the pizza.” He walked over the get the pizza from the boy at the door. As he settled into the couch with Cas at his side and a place with steaming pizza in his hand, he noticed that the romcom Cas had selected was about roommates who pretend to be together for Christmas. Dean swallowed a lump in his throat and filled his mouth with hot pizza before he could say anything stupid. Cas already knew Dean was in love with him, he didn’t need reminders.
he thought. People had asked him if he was part of the campus move-in team so many times he was ready to explode. When he explained he was an older brother, they asked if his parents were with him and his brother. Sam was used to explaining to strangers that he didn’t really have a dad, just his older brother, and his roommate; Dean was not used to explaining that. Sometimes when he showed in places where kids and teens where people would assume that he was a teen father and give him dirty looks. He bit back the urge to chew them out and instead just focused on what was important – supporting Sam.
, a partner. He had watched the neighborhood ‘good Christian boy’ turn into the man he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. They were friends for all of middle school and high school, Dean being there for him when Castiel told him that he needed to escape his parent’s cult-like church. Dean was there when Cas came out as gay and was scared that his parents would somehow be able to tell. Dean was there when no one in their high school would talk to him because he was a Shurley and the Shurley kids were weird.
“Why is it such a big deal, Cas? So, Garth thinks we’re dating, why do you care so much? Am I that terrible that you’d rather be alone in a hospital room than have some people think we’re dating? I’m sorry, but I don’t understand why you’re so pissed.”
“But, I mean…I assumed you were telling me you’ve been dating him,” Sam said. Dean could hear the confusion in his voice. Damn, did everyone know he was in love with Cas? Was he just walking around that obvious?
“I don’t feel like going anywhere, Dean. I’d just like to spend today how we spend every school night. Here.”
“Dean, I – I need you to pick me up. I dropped out. I…Dean…” Cas’s voice was hushed as if he was trying not to wake someone. His roommate, probably, Dean realized.
rerun to another nature documentary. This one was about lizards. He let out a soft chuckle. Only Cas. A silence fell between them. The apartment was quiet since Sam had moved out. No coming and going of random teenagers, no flurry of movement every morning when Sam woke up late. It was odd. Dean had driven him down to the university alone, as Cas was still in the early stages of recovering and said he wouldn’t be much help.
“I forgot to remove a pride pin from my backpack. I’m cut off. I don’t have a place to be…Dean can I -”
It was if someone had thrown a bucket of water on his head. The shock of hearing those words, words he never thought he would hear, combined with the heat that was crawling out of his chest into his cheeks hit him like a punch. But this time, it didn’t hurt. Cas wouldn’t hurt him.
“Good morning, Dean,” he mumbled. Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel. Castiel, his boyfriend. His lover. His partner. He would never hear the end of this from Sam or any of their friends, but somehow, he was okay with that. As long as he had Castiel in his arms it would be okay.
“Sam. Dean is okay. I healed him,” Castiel stopped to roll his eyes exasperatedly, “Again. He will need to rest; his soul was already on its way to heaven. Jack told me that he didn’t want to intervene, but to be fair, he never said
“Sure, Cas. Do I need to dress nice?” Dean asked, looking up at his best friend. Cas seemed to be trying to contain happiness.
Castiel’s mouth was hanging slightly open and his eyes were still as wide as Dean thought they could get. He blinked a few times, and frankly, he kind of looked like a fish.
Castiel didn’t blame him. He had likely made Dean uncomfortable and then died. It might take a while for him to want to deal with Castiel. Especially now that he’s human. Would he be okay, staying here, if Dean wouldn’t talk to him?
“I know, Dean. I remember it. Do you want me to call out for today? If…if you’re going to talk I wanna be there,” Sam said, and Dean could already hear clicking on a computer as Sam started to type an email out.
“Yeah, we didn’t pretend to be a couple, though. Our family knows we’re friends,” he frowned at Cas. Did he have to be that cruel as to point the similarities.
He loved Cas. He loved that Castiel saw the world as good. He loved his terrible puns and lack of understanding of pop culture. Dean loved the way Cas wore sweaters that were slightly too big for him and steel-toed boots even though he worked in a library
That sent a cold spike through Dean’s heart. A plus one, that meant romantic partner usually. Sure, Cas had come to Dean’s family Christmas dinners a few times and he had returned the favor by escorting Cas to his brother Gabriel’s wedding, but this wasn’t just their family. Their families all knew that Dean was in love with Cas and were able to joke about it. This was Castiel’s work environment. That meant meeting the ever-elusive coworkers Meg and Bal. Cas had been meaning to introduce him to his coworkers for a while, but this wasn’t how Dean expected that to happen.
“You two finally get your shit together?” Asked Meg sweetly. Before Dean could cut in, Cas smiled brightly and squeezed Dean tighter.
“Dean? Would you be able to do me a favor?” Cas called out from his office. Dean was laying on the living room floor, recovering from a long day under cars. He rolled onto his stomach and whipped out his phone.
“Castiel is okay. He is stable. He was involved in an accident this morning and is currently being monitored for any internal bleeding. Could you come down to the health cen - ”
Groaning, Dean pulled himself out from under the car he was working on. It was an old truck that had more rust than machinery. Standing up, he kicked the wrench on the ground over to his workbench. Wiping his hands on his stained jeans, he walked into the office of Bobby’s Repair Shop.
“Sam!” Dean threw himself at the other man again, this time clutching him tightly in his arms. As he opened his eyes, he took in the sight of Eileen. “Am I in heaven?” he asked.
Castiel kissed Dean. It was shaky, wet, and brief. Dean was still crying, he cut off the kiss to press his face into Cas’ shoulder because he couldn’t hold it together anymore. The last dam broke, and now Dean knew it would be okay – finally - because Cas was holding him, running his hands through his hair and rubbing his back.
“I know you want Sam to have a normal teenager life, Dean. But you know he won’t. He knows that too. What he does have is the best older brother he could ask for. I think he’d rather spend time with you now than worry about
A sudden intake of breath, a small hum, and the soft sounds of lips parting and connecting filled Castiel’s ears. He didn’t know how long they kissed. Long enough for the beautiful sounds Dean was making to increase in volume, for Castiel to feel Dean adjusting so he was practically on top of him, and long enough for the kissed to become open mouth, Cas shaking as he slipped his tongue into Dean’s mouth. It wasn’t long after they truly started kissing that Dean pulled back, however.
“Hey! Hey, uh, Sammy. I need to talk to you.” Dean mumbled, suddenly regretting his brave choice. His fingers had called Sam before his brain could catch up to what he was doing.
“Yeah, Cas, I love you. You know that,” Dean huffed, watching Cas’s face carefully. His hand felt a squeeze, and he looked down to where Cas was gripping his hand like a lifeline. Glancing back up, he took in the shocked look on his friend’s face.
They hit Dean’s bed with a soft exhale shared between lips. Cas was tugging off his blue sweater and Dean started on getting his t-shirt over his head. The skin on skin contact was glorious, Dean had never felt anything like it. Having Cas against him, on top of him, shoving his tongue in his mouth and kissing his neck and –
Dean jerked awake and immediately sat up, not even noticing he wasn’t in his bed at the bunker. He reached for the gun under his mattress, and only then did he realize he was on a sofa in an unfamiliar room. Swallowing hard, he rolled himself off the sofa and slowly got to his feet. Dean blinked rapidly when he realized he wasn’t in pain. Why wasn’t he in pain? He was always in pain. What was happening?
“I’d be happy to share,” smiled Eileen, wrapping an arm around Sam’s waist. She signed something quickly, something to make Sam’s entire head go red, and Cas to let out a cough.
“Hey, hey, Cas. Here,” Dean moved over to Cas and helped him maneuver back into a sitting position. Cas looked at Dean’s face for the first time since he woke up. Beautiful. But above that, Dean looked sincere, and he looked scared. Dean didn’t scare easily. Not with the life he lived. They stared. This was good. This was normal. Starting was normal for them. Slowly, Dean inched his hand to cover one of Castiel’s.
He ended up in the Impala, driving down the road back to their apartment, silently. He wouldn’t look at Cas the entire time. Dean really thought that he knew. Now he
“Dean! What do I owe the pleasure?” he stopped when he caught a look of Dean’s face. “What’s wrong? Claire, cover for me, will you?” he excused himself and smiled at Claire. Cas was in his typical work outfit, a pair of jeans, a sweater, and a truly terrible tweed jacket that Dean had bought him a few years ago for his birthday. Dean’s heart clenched painfully with a bit of longing. He was having a weird day. He didn’t need to bring Cas his lunch, he just needed to see him, and finally, tell him some things he should have years ago.
“Hi, is this Dean Winchester?” a woman asked. Dean frowned. He didn’t remember giving his number to any women at the bar lately. He swallowed roughly.
“I’ll be at the library already, setting up for the event. You can meet me there at six? We have snacks but I’m sure you won’t get your fill. We can go to the Roadhouse after if you’d like? We Should be done by eight.” Cas smiled, knowing Dean couldn’t say no to a trip to the Roadhouse.
“Hey, Cas, buddy, you okay? Let’s get you sat up,” Sam said, he and Eileen working to move their hands under his back and propped him against some pillows. Dean was sitting back, jaw set and eyes weary.
It was bright. He blinked but managed to keep his eyes open. He was correct. He was in the bunker, and staring down at him from above were Dean, Sam, Eileen, and…a dog?
“Yeah,” Dean nodded, even though Sam couldn’t see it. “He found out my senior year. I moved out. I haven’t told anyone till today,” he murmured, still fidgeting.
“No, it’s okay. Cas, I have spent every day since Dad died trying to learn who I am without him. This was just the hardest. I know I’m a good mechanic. I did get into that university, never told anyone. I still have issues, God knows that. But this one, this was the worst.”
“You know how I feel about you, Cas, don’t put me though this shit. Come on. Charlie and Jo are always saying how cute of a couple we’d make. Sam is always joking about how whipped I am on you. Gabriel’s…well, Gabriel is Gabriel. I don’t know why you feel the need to make me tell you,” Dean bit out, and looked away from Cas’s piercing glance. He bit his lip, looked upwards, and attempted to make sure the stupid tears that were welling up in his eyes didn’t fall.
“Uh…Cas? Aren’t you supposed to be home right now?” Dean let out a confused chuckle. Cas was supposed to be with Sam making a frozen pizza and then sleeping before his morning shift at the coffee shop.
“Bullshit. You know you don’t have to wait for me to move out to start sharing a room. I’m literally an adult, I can handle - ”
“Cas?” Sam leant down further. From Castiel’s position on the bed (it was a bed, right? It felt like a bed) Sam loomed large over him, Castiel’s eyes still watery and full of cosmic entity made him disfigured.
Castiel, who was beautiful. Castiel, who was helping Dean stay sober. Castiel, who Dean would give anything to be able to love, to touch, to kiss. Castiel, who was talking to Garth. Castiel, who was –
before his brother could get another word in. Taking another deep breath to steady himself – what felt like the millionth deep breath of the day – Dean started the impala and headed towards the library. A bell jingled as Dean entered the library Cas worked at. He rounded the corner and stopped at the circulation desk. A bored-looking blonde teen girl glanced up, then rolled back on her chair to the door leading back to the employee lounge. Knocking once, she opened the door.
Dean adjusted his position, sliding up to lay next to Castiel, helping the former angel slide back down into a laying position as well. He was wearing a loose shirt and had sometime between sitting down and getting under the covers removed his jeans. Castiel looked as his own body – still reminding himself it was his body now – and saw he was dressed in at least two hoodies and sweat pants. He was still freezing.
Oh, shit. Had Cas found someone else to be his fake-date? Or worse, were Meg and Cas a genuine thing? Cas turned back to him, now.
The familiar jingle of bells alerted everyone inside to Dean’s presence. Great. It was mostly people he knew from town, and a few familiar faces he had seen in pictures on Cas’s phone. Speak of the devil, Castiel emerged from behind the front desk, smiling, although it was rather strained.
“Cas…Cas died. Sam – what?” Dean bit out, still slightly bleary and now extremely confused. His heart beat in his chest at the mention of the angel.
He had to go to parent-teacher conferences when Sam was in high school, meaning that the same high school teachers who had often told Dean he wasn’t going to succeed unless he tried harder or “applied himself” as they said had to look Dean in the face as he told them he was raising his teen brother as well as working over sixty hours a week to make sure the kid could afford college. There was a bitter sense of satisfaction in his gut when the shock and guilt showed on their faces. He never opened up to anyone besides Cas in school, none of the teachers knew he was busy trying to make sure his dad didn’t accidentally kill himself or hurt his brother. Maybe in high school he was a dick to some of the teachers. But they were dicks to him too. Dean remembered the first time he had to talk to one of Sam’s teachers. He was only twenty-one, and Sam was sixteen.
“Sure, let me find – oh! Meg, good to see you!” Castiel suddenly burst out, leaning toward the brunette woman who had seemingly come out of nowhere. Dean tried to bite back his wave of jealousy.
“When Chuck was defeated,” Cas started, loosening up and hugging Dean in return, “I felt Jack calling to me. I managed to stay awake long enough to find a few of my brothers and sisters willing to fight against the Empty with me. As long as we were awake, the Empty was awake. Jack opened a portal, and we left. In the Empty, it was a year, here, a month.” Dean dropped his head lower, still not letting go of the angel. Cas let his head fall onto Dean’s. “I was planning to stay in heaven, restoring what was once good and fixing it, but…you deserved to live, Dean. I had to save you. My deepest flaw always was my love for humanity.”
Dean broke out, turning around to point the spatula at his brother. Sam had a shit-eating grin on his face.
“Alright, so I’m stressed. Sammy’s finally going to college. I’m going to miss the kid. Can’t I be stressed about this? I’m practically his dad.”
“There’s one more thing I never told you about my dad.” Castiel moved closer and forced Dean to face him. He reached for Castiel’s hands this time. He needed this. He needed to tell Cas everything.
he thought. Sure enough, Cas returned to Dean’s room, and Dean’s eyes couldn’t help but flicker to the marks he had left on his chest. Cas was holding two mugs, one black coffee and one chai latte. Dean felt his mouth smile on its own accord. Cas set them down on the headboard before climbing back on top of Dean, dropping his head into the nook of his neck.
“Dean, I can’t imagine the toll this has had on you. All these years, not telling anyone. The guilt. There’s a term for this too, I can explain it,” Cas blinked, shedding a few tears himself.
“Novak, Dean’s here.” Dean didn’t know how she knew his name. Sure, he had seen this girl here a few times, but he didn’t know her name. Clarissa? Chrissy? Claire? Didn’t matter, because Castiel emerged from the backroom with a curious smile on his face.
“This is what I mean by faith, Dean. Just knowing that life is beautiful. Earth. Us, we’re beautiful. I hated my church, but I always trusted the voice in my heart telling me to be glad for life.”
Dean fumbled with his phone for a minute as he continued to drive. He didn’t know what was going on with him today, but his walls were breaking around him, and he had to let people know. He managed to press
“A romcom? Seriously, dude?” Dean asked, incredulously. He squinted at the screen. It was a Christmas themed one too.
“You…Cas, you serious here? Because I’ve been through way too much today to deal with anything fake.”
Dean knew why. He was eighteen and laughing at a joke his friend made while studying for their biology final when he knew. Cas was special because Dean was in love with him. He didn’t choke or stop laughing or react in any way. If there was one thing he was good at, it was hiding whatever he was thinking. Everyday Cas smiled at him, and Dean had to excuse himself because he would flush too much. Dean knew he was bisexual. He would never forget the day near the end of their senior year that he shyly approached Charlie after their last class of the day and asked if there was such a thing as someone who liked boys and girls. She had smiled eagerly and answered all his questions. She even gave him a button the next day. It was blue, purple, and pink. He smiled and put it in his pocket.
. Dean had been the father that John never was. He only wanted to give Sam the best teenage years he could. Because Dean never got those. His teen years were spent working, drinking shitty beer, trying to make sure no one was harassing his best friend for being gay, and avoiding abuse from his father. So, when Sam turned eighteen, he wanted to give him something that would mean something. The only gift that Dean got in his entire life from his father was the Impala.
“Oh,” Dean nodded, flushed. “Makes sense. Sorry, I just didn’t know for sure.” This was going terribly.
It wasn’t Cas’s fault he was working himself to exhaustion. It wasn’t Sam’s fault either, although they both wanted to blame themselves. Cas was working as both a barista and an assistant librarian, and Sam was working part-time at a restaurant while finishing high school. Dean still had his job at Bobby’s repair shop but was bartending on the side as well as – to Cas’s anger – selling his plasma for money. They could afford rent and food just fine. Cas also payed for his online classes, having chosen to return to school for a degree in library science. But Dean wouldn’t let Sam pay a penny of the rent or help with anything. No, Sammy’s job was to enjoy being a teenager in the way that Dean never got to. Dean’s plasma and bartending money went to the college fund he had set up once claiming Sam as his dependent and cutting ties with their father legally. Sure, he was tired. But if Sammy could go to college and put his brain to good use, it was all worth it. If Cas could get his degree and be happy at the library, it was all worth it. If Dean’s family was okay, it was all worth it. Even if…
The sound of laughter filled the air. Tomorrow they would call their friends and family, go visit Jody and Donna, Claire and Kaia, Charlie and Stevie, and the rest.
“I don’t understand why you refuse to have fun, man. Come on, you’re free now. We graduate next month, and you’ve never done
Oh, no. Dean closed his eyes and felt the pain of Castiel’s statement hit his heart. Naomi Shurley was a bitch. Raising Castiel and his three siblings hyper-religiously, she had already caused Cas more guilt and pain than he deserved. His older brother Michael was an asshole, always snitching on Cas to their mom, and his younger sister Anna too young to know much about their corrupt cult-like church. His last brother, Gabriel, was the only one Cas could trust not to screw him over. Three years ago at age eighteen Gabriel had brought home a massive cake decorated in the colors of the pansexual pride flag, declared that he “liked anything with an ass” and promptly was kicked out. He lived two states away with his own hybrid bakery-tattoo shop. Don’t ask how that works, Dean never found out if it was actually legal for food and ink to be in the same place.
Dean knew Cas was in love with him. Dean knew that he was the reason they weren’t dating. Dean knew that Cas probably knew he was in love with him too. Cas had a way of knowing things no one spoke into existence.
“I don’t consider spending time with you doing nothing,” Cas bit out, and Dean felt a wave of guilt wash over him. Cas was too nice. Sure, he enjoyed spending time with his best friend too, but he wanted to make sure Cas would go out and have fun when he left for college. Dean wasn’t going to college. Cas was.
“He deserves that much, after the childhood he’s had. He deserves to go to college and be a stupid young adult like we were never able to,” Dean said, looking at Cas. He set his mug down and reached to hold Cas’s hand in the middle. “A hand sandwich, if you will,” he joked. Cas let out a small laugh and the corners of his eyes crinkled.
“I should have told you then.” Castiel felt his entire body melt with anxiety. Everywhere Dean was touching him felt warm, his gut was clenching, shoulders stiff.
“Why not? Everyone assumes we’re dating anyway. All you’d have to do is say we’re dating and put an arm around me. Unless that idea makes you uncomfortable…” Cas trailed off, looking unsure. Dean felt like slapping him with a slice of pizza. Cas had laughed at Charlie and Jo’s teasing remarks, accepted the smirks that Sam and Eileen gave them at holidays, and even tolerated Gabriel’s gross sexual jokes about the two of them, but he had never made fun of Dean himself. This was crossing a line. Dean bit back the urge to yell at Cas, or worse, cry.
“You’re always busy, Dean.” He looked sad. Dean never wanted to make Cas sad. He managed to do it enough, though.
The apartment showed no signs of movie night. Cas must have cleaned everything up. Fuck, Dean felt guilty. Cas needed a fake boyfriend for an event and Dean had snapped at him. Of course, Dean made the most sense as a fake boyfriend. It wasn’t Cas’s fault Dean was in love with him. He sent out two messages, one to Cas and one to Charlie relaying the same message.
“Yeah! It’s great. Hey, Sam, right?” he nodded to Sam, awkwardly standing in the corner. “I’m glad you and Castiel finally ended up together!” Garth said. Dean opened his mouth to protest but remembered that he had told the nurse on the phone they were dating.
“I’m dropping you at Bobby’s for now,” Dean said, finally getting out of his bed. He flipped on the lights, looking for his discarded jeans from earlier. “He’s got a spare room. You can stay there until we can find a place to move into.”
“Morning, Sammy!” Dean called from the kitchen, where he was scrambling eggs. He saw the shaggy-haired kid smile and sit at the counter.
picking up a few extra shifts to cover his classes. Sam is smart, Dean. He knows what college will cost him. I’ve been helping him out with studying lately, he stops by the library sometimes and I gave him some study guides. He’s well on his way to getting excellent scholarships,” Cas’s lips twitched upward, and Dean felt his heart swell with joy at knowing that Cas cared for Sam too. Maybe even almost as much as he did.
he thought. He swallowed and inhaled, turning back to Bobby. Something inside him was telling him that today was the day. Maybe he was just fucking tired.
“Hello, Dean. How are you feeling?” Dean hesitated, not believing his ears, but finally turned to see Cas. There he was, in all his re-found angelic glory. The man was practically glowing, a slight smile on his face, blue eyes beaming with hints of tears already welling up in them. Dean let out a soft laugh, moving forward to clutch Castiel tight to his chest. He dipped his head into the nook of Cas’s neck and simply whispered his name into the fabric.
Castiel opened his mouth, feeling his tongue figure out how to work again. “Is this real? Is this just the Empty torturing me again? Because, Dean, I can’t handle this if it’s not real.” It was the longest he had talked the entire time since he awoke. He felt the arms around him squeeze.
“You couldn’t have just said you’re my roommate? Or closest friend or the nearest thing to a family member?” Cas was quietly fuming, and Dean felt as if his heart was going to explode out of his chest. The guilt was eating him alive from the inside out, but he couldn’t help but argue back.
he explained, shrugging slightly. “I guess they were joking about it because everyone knew we liked each other.”
“What? Faith? Really, Cas? I’m not that kind of guy,” he huffed. Leave it to Cas to suggest Dean be more faithful.
Castiel was reminded of his humanity very suddenly, as his heart panged with an emotion he hadn’t even thought about since he returned, and his stomach lurched. He had told Dean he loved him. He had thought that this was either the Empty toying with him – it wouldn’t be the first time – or Dean just babying him back to health. But…sweetheart. Dean called him sweetheart, and his nose was buried in Castiel’s hair.
“What? Cas, I know you and Dean were having a tough time before this, but he wants to see you, I promise.” Castiel sighed as if he knew something Sam didn’t, but touched Dean and Sam’s hands, and they all were moved to the bunker.
“Cas?” Bobby asked after what felt like hours but was probably twenty seconds, looking at Dean for confirmation. He simply bit his lip and nodded. “Does he know?”
Dean drew in a deep breath, heart hurting, even though he knew Cas didn’t love him back. “Let’s go back to the party, Cas,” he murmured, turning around to head back. He hoped to God that there was alcohol involved in this gathering.
“Hey, we’re fine now, Cas. Everything…everything is good. Really good. Sammy has Eileen, Charlie and Stevie are okay, Jody, Donna, the girls…and, and you. You’re back. I have you, now,” Dean said, and he did what broke Castiel out of his tired, bleary, confused state. Dean kissed the top of his head. He froze and attempted to roll over, but Dean’s grip was tight.
“I’m one-hundred percent serious. You think I would leave my own fundraiser if this weren’t so important? Dean, I love you too,” Cas said, wrapping an arm around Dean again. Dean exhaled. There was no way this was happening. Absolutely no way. But Cas’s arm around his was tight, and the look Cas was giving him was full of joy. Cas was smiling like he did the first time Dean made him homemade burgers, when Dean let him pick the movie, or the way that he did only when he saw a honeybee on a flower. Castiel loved him. Why? How did he not notice?
“We did. Thank you, Meg. Dean, I’m afraid we will need to be heading out sooner than later. Meg will cover for me for the rest of tonight, right?” Cas said, completely unphased. Dean’s heart was going way too fast for his body. What was Cas doing? Were they going to the Roadhouse, where Cas would tell Dean that he needed to move out? Was Cas going to move out? He managed to nod along and follow Cas numbly out of the library. The cool fall air hit his lungs and made Dean squint. His eyes started to tear up for several reasons now. Was this the end of his friendship with Castiel? Fuck he hoped not, he didn’t think he could even move on from Cas without his friendship. He could live without Cas loving him romantically, but he needed Cas as a friend.
“No, Dean, Cas saved you. Again. He always does,” Sam answered, putting down the bags he was carrying into the house. Eileen stepped in, smiling, and closed the door behind her. “You’ve been out for a few days, but you should be fully healed.”
They held each other’s gaze, and Dean tentatively moved his hand from where he had grabbed Castiel’s shoulder to his hand. Cas’s eyes widened. Dean bit his lip.
“Bottled grace,” Dean laughed quietly. He let his hands flow from the lapels of Cas’s coat to his hands, where he ran his thumbs over the callouses on his fingertips. “You’ll always be my angel, though,” he murmured.
“I don’t think you’ll end up getting your birthday present today, Sammy,” Dean lowly chucked. Sam frowned in confusion. “I was hoping we could maybe look at getting you a shitty car. To keep on campus with you. I think the medical bills are gonna slash that. I’m sorry.”
Of course, he didn’t really want that to happen. But it would be a lot easier to be sad and drunk in peace if the object of his sorrow wasn’t there, kindly asking him what was wrong.
“Having a bad day, Cas,” Dean said, not knowing how else to start the conversation. He had to start with his dad and explain what he had been dealing with for his entire life.
“Don’t, I’m fine. Hey, uh, thanks. I’m gonna go talk to Cas. I’ll see you later,” Dean rushed to hang up, but Sam cut him off again.
“Because…no, I’m not doing that,” he set down his drink, snatched the remote from Cas and paused the movie. “You know why, don’t make me say it. Why would you – I gotta say, Cas, this…this is a low blow. Sam and Gabe might make jokes about us being together, but you doing it is another thing.” Dean felt as if his heart was going to break in two. That was ironic, of course. Cas had already broken his heart so many times.
Cas pulled back and smiled, slightly sadly. “Would you like me to take you to the bunker and return to heaven?” Sam frowned.
“What?” he grunted out, looking back up at Dean. It was only when he caught a look at Dean’s worried face that he set down his pencil and stood, moving to where Dean had frozen by the service counter. “Dean, what is with you today?”
Dean fiddled with the collar of the moss green button-up that Cas had asked him to wear. He looked himself over in the mirror. He still looked like a dirty mechanic, but at least he was presentable. Running his hands over his face for what felt like the millionth time, Dean grabbed his keys, wallet, and phone, and left Cas and his apartment. Baby roared into life and Dean felt a little better. Driving Baby always made him feel better. When he pulled into the library parking lot, he glanced around in shock. There were never this many people at the library. It must be a pretty big deal. He sighed, checked his phone again, and decided that he would head in.
Even if too much of his extra money went to shitty whiskey. Maybe he spent too long at the bar even after closing. Sometimes he would avoid seeing Castiel or Sam for too long. Yeah, he sucked at talking about any of his feelings. Even if he snapped at them when he was tired. It would be okay.
for fucks sake. I take you to my parent’s house for Christmas. Did you seriously think all our friends would joke this much if there wasn’t some truth to it?” Dean cried out, pulling his hand out of Cas’s grip. “I’m sorry. I thought you knew. That’s why I didn’t want to be your fake date.”
“Yeah, well. I do. Sorry.” Dean picked up his partial beer and grabbed two more from the six-pack on the table next to them. “Gonna need these,” he murmured to himself, and retreated to his bedroom down the hall. Once inside, he placed the bottles on his nightstand and threw himself onto his bed. He blinked hard and felt a tear run down his cheek. Damn Cas.
They barely even managed to get back to their apartment, throwing off their jackets in the car already, and then Cas had Dean against a wall and was against his body. Dean let out a sigh, a gentle sound of
“Why wouldn’t you be around to spend time with?” Cas asked, head tilting slightly. Dean watched the movement with a bit of fondness. It was so
“Where’s Cas?” he asked. Castiel was usually back from his run by now. He shrugged, although he also wondered where the man was. “Are you two dating?”
“Okay…go ahead?” Sam said, annoyance dripping in his voice. Shoot. Dean had called him while he was at work. Oops.
“Please, Dean. I think it would help. I just know that no matter what I have this grace with me, and I wish I could share it with you.”
He waited. Checked the clock. It was after six, Charlie should have already left her comic shop for the day. He tapped his foot on the floor and bit his lip. Damn Cas.
“I work, tomorrow, yeah,” Dean said, mumbling into his coffee mug, “I’m sorry, buddy. I’m free Saturday at two, though.” A silence followed. Dean looked up to see Cas biting his lip.
“C’mere, Cas.” Dean whispered, throwing one of his arms around Cas’s freezing shoulders. Dean slid them together, pressing Castiel’s back against his chest, intertwining his bare legs with the cold man’s.
“You are the best person I know. You’re my everything too, always have been. You’ve endured so much. These eight years when you’ve shared what your father did have been so hard on you; even after he’s gone, he hurts you. You never deserved that. Dean, I want you to know that I’m proud of you,” Cas spoke softly, affection clear in his eyes and a slight sad smile on his face.
So, he wasn’t in the Empty. That was good. At least, Castiel thought it was good. The Empty had frozen him down to a whisp of himself; the ooze wrapped its way around his grace, sucking it out of his vessel. Scattered around the Empty were the vessels and former angelic beings, so cold, so stuck. He opened his mouth, tried to yell in the Empty. He thought he saw a familiar face. Maybe even a demon he knew. An angel. There was no air for his vessel to breath, he was human, and he fell.
“What?” Dean echoed his own thought. He looked at Castiel, who was biting his bottom lip and looking up at Dean hopefully.
And thirty-two-year-old Dean remembered all the words his father had yelled at him when said pin was found.
“Cas,” he started, swallowing visibly, “you changed me, too. I can’t be without you,” he whispered. He was speaking slowly, as if he was afraid to rush it and ruin the delicate tension dangling by a thread between them. Cas nodded slowly back at him, never breaking eye contact.
He tried to open his mouth. A weak cough emitted from his lungs. He needed to warm up. His vessel – or his body ¬now was in bad shape.
“My faith was never in the reciting of prayers or in the worship of a God who wanted to smite me for being gay,” Cas chuckled, “My faith was in us.”
“Never said move around, I just think you would do good with a job in something you take interest in. You’re good with cars, of course. But…Dean, I can’t keep the shop open forever. You know that.”
“Why would you tell Garth we are dating?” Cas asked, looking away and speaking quietly. Dean felt his entire body deflate. Cas was going to move out. He was disgusted not only by the idea of dating Dean but also at the idea of Dean even saying they were together.
Cas slowly leaned in, reaching now to place a hand on Dean’s face and the other on the back of his neck.
Dean didn’t know what to expect in the morning. He really didn’t. His bed was empty, and he half expected to find out the whole thing was a dream. Only he wasn’t wearing anything, and there was the sound of movement in the kitchen. Did Cas regret it? No, he couldn’t, not after what he had all said.
Dean hated hospitals. They smelled bad. They smelled like someone was trying to cover the scent of blood, vomit, and piss. Hospitals were pain and suffering. No amount of weird modern art or cheery nurses would change that. Dean hated hospitals. Sam had been to the hospital once at age thirteen. He had broken a wrist at school during gym and Dean at age eighteen had had to care for him the entire time. John showed up just to yell at Dean for an unrelated reason and pay the bill. A few nurses looked at him suspiciously when he had told John to leave before knowing anything about how Sam was doing. One look into his too-old-for-his-age eyes told them enough.
It was almost four am, he clicked his phone off as he didn’t expect a response for a few hours. Sam drove back to the barn. As he walked in, however, there was a feeling in the air he could sense was…different.
es that he got that day. It was Castiel who had thanked everyone and kept his hand wrapped around Dean’s waist the entire time for support. Dean had numbly left the funeral, Cas following him quietly. After they got in the Impala, Dean let out a sob, and Cas, thinking it was simply mourning, attempted to speak of his father lovingly, even though he had never met the man.
“Since when do you care about lying?” Dean pointed out, knowing Cas had been prone to lying his entire life due to his upbringing. Cas looked away now, blinking. Only then did Dean notice that Castiel’s shoulders were so tense they were shaking. Cas let out a short and bitter laugh.
didn’t know. I’m so sorry. You must have thought this entire time I was ignoring you. I had no clue.”
He loved that even though Castiel grew up in a massive church that warped his views on love, sex, and the world, he was still the most understanding person Dean knew. Cas still had
“You’ve been off for months. I’ve tried to talk to you, but you always avoid me in the apartment and insist on taking Sam with us when I ask you out to dinner,” Cas explained, crossing his arms and giving Dean a knowing look.
“Cas, please, you need to sleep. Just – just let me hold you. I’ve got you,” the hunter said, hooking his chin onto Castiel’s shoulder. “We can talk, but…can we just sleep first? I…I haven’t been sleeping. You were gone for weeks, Cas, I…I couldn’t sleep.”
“Oh, Dean. You don’t need to pretend in front of me, darling. Castiel has already told me everything. Just the guests.”
Dean shifted. He removed his hand from Cas’s hair (Cas did not make a disapproving sound at that.) and placed it on Cas’s bicep.
“Cas, you said, before you died, that you love me. I never got to say anything. You’re our family, Cas, we treated you terribly at times. I’m sorry. Please, Cas, don’t leave. Not again, I really can’t live without you - obviously."
Cas was the only one who knew Dean had lasting trauma. It was only after John died that he told him. Cas came to the funeral with him. Sam brought his girlfriend at the time, Jess. Dean was so zoned out that he couldn’t even accept the many, many
“The night before he died, he told me he knew. I said he was wrong. But I know. I knew, and I have to say it. I’ve known I was bi since we were in high school, I was probably seventeen or eighteen. I told Bobby and Sam today. I can’t keep it in anymore, Cas.” Dean bit out, eyes closed and tears flowing freely. He knew that crying was for men too.
It was Saturday, which was movie night. Dean was humming a tune to himself as he prepped the popcorn and placed an order for two large meat-lovers pizzas on his phone. Movie night, no matter how emotionally painful later, was Dean’s favorite night. Just him and Cas on the sofa together, eating pizza and drinking beer, and usually Cas fell asleep on his shoulder. For a few hours, Dean could pretend that Cas was
“What?” Dean shook his head, trying to make sense of what Cas was saying. His eyes were watering and his mouth was half-open. Cas’s lips were trembling and there were already tears threatening to spill from his blue eyes.
Turns out that Castiel’s idea of having faith in the world is in simply enjoying life’s simple pleasures. He took Dean to a state park and made him sit on a hill overlooking a lake. He didn’t want to admit it, but maybe Cas was right. Maybe this was the best part of life. Dean’s life was loud. The garage was loud. The radio played. His coworkers yelled and swore and laughed. Sam’s high school graduation was loud. Their apartment was loud. The TV was on, playing Dr. Sexy (Dean’s idea) or a nature documentary (Cas’s idea) constantly. But this, this was quiet. Sitting high on a rocky hill looking at the water below him, Dean breathed in the scent of the outdoors. It was nice. His flannel was tied around his waist and he had his hiking boots on. He hadn’t worn hiking boots in ages.
“Oh, maybe because we’re not actually dating, Dean!” Cas bit out, his glare hitting Dean like a slap across the face. A stab in the heart. It hurt more than a punch from John. Dean couldn’t help the tears falling from his eyes. Why did Cas care? Why was he crying? Why did Cas look both angry but also sad? Wait –
“Dean! Woah! Woah, Dean! Dean, It’s me!” Sam cried, pushing his brother off him, watching the realization dawn on his face.
“I’m in love with you, and I want to be with you, and I want you to move into my room, and, and, Cas, I want what you want too.” They were so close, the words were whispered against Castiel’s lips, barely brushing. Cas hitched in his breath and tilted his head ever so slightly. He pressed his lips against Dean’s.
It was three am, and Dean was only slightly pissed at whoever had called his phone. He rolled over, reaching blindly for the damn thing. The anger turned to fear as he saw the name
Castiel set to trying to remember where he was, what he was doing. He knew he was in the Empty. He had said goodbye to Dean and been dissolved into the slimy ooze that he knew was awaiting him after his happiest moment. In the Empty it was cold, it was so cold that Castiel couldn’t even move. But it wasn’t as cold here. No, he was cold, but the space around him was warm.
Dean snorted at the last one. At least that one was deserved. He sighed and checked the time. One pm. God, he needed to stop sleeping in so late. He groaned and cleaned himself up.
“Let’s go.” He marched off, not willing to look at Cas’s disgusted face. He managed to get back into the main party, where he saw Meg and Charlie whispering to each other. He swallowed. The last thing he needed were those two being friends.
“Hey, Dean, do you work tomorrow night? Sam and I were thinking we could see that new Marvel movie,” Cas said, wandering into the kitchen wearing just boxers and a robe. His face was freshly shaven, and Dean had to tear his eyes away from his sharp jawline. Cas was on his phone, probably looking at the movie times and ticket prices. Dean couldn’t admit it to himself when he was eighteen, but he knew now, at age twenty-two, that he had more than just
“Oh god, Dean.” Cas’s hands squeezed his tighter as he shut his eyes. Cas always shut his eyes when listening to Dean talk about his dad.
Thirty-two-year-old Dean knew. He knew he was fucked up. He knew how much emotional damage his father gave him. His self-worth was dangerously low, he drank too much, and he knew he was going to snap one day – probably today - and kiss Cas. He knew he would give in eventually. It was always Castiel. Cas was the only one who had listened. He listened as Dean broke over the years and told him what had occurred up until the day his dad died. But Dean never mentioned his bisexuality or his father’s hatred for that part of him.
Dean realized he was caught up in his thoughts. He looked up and met Cas’s worried gaze. Dean felt a sense of peace wash over him. The blue eyes of his best friend always calmed him down. It would be okay.
“Dean you don’t mean this,” he said, desperately. He could not have Dean trying to repay a favor by saying he loved Cas. He could not handle this. Cas wormed him way out of Dean’s grasp and almost off the bed. He was almost impressed with his ability to stand up so quickly.
“Alright…take a seat, son, you look like you might faint,” Bobby said, pulling out two chairs from the counter and steering Dean into one, taking the other for himself. Dean was still blinking and biting his lip periodically. He wasn’t like this normally, Bobby knew that. “Dean, what’s going on?” he asked, a little softer. Dean was his son by all means, especially after John had passed.
thought Dean. Why was he so happy? And nervous earlier? Dean blinked and once again chastised himself for looking into Castiel’s emotions too much.
“Need to make sure Sam gets to go to college, I know,” Cas said, reaching across the table and pulling one of Dean’s hands close to him, and putting his own hand over it. Dean’s heart fluttered.
“Glad you’re feeling okay,” Sam said, arms crossed and a smile on his face. Dean flushed but let go of the angel and faced his brother.
“Dean, don’t apologize. It’s not anyone’s fault. It was an accident. I’d rather have Cas be here and safe than a car.” Dean nodded. Fuck, this was all messed up. The sun had hit a driver’s eyes and they had swerved, knocking Cas over. He was knocked unconscious, broke three fingers, and had a nasty road rash. He looked down at Castiel, still on the hospital bed. A knock brought him back to his senses. A male nurse with a clipboard came in. Dean sighed.
“The Empty didn’t exactly expect me and a few of the other angels to begin annoying it so much that it couldn’t sleep. Once it began yelling, Jack heard it. He opened a portal to heaven. I am back, Sam. Returned to full power. I am once again an angel. I have fully healed grace. Dean Winchester is saved.”
“Dean?” he heard from behind him. He sighed and sat down on the steps leading up to their apartment. The concrete was cold, and he was so emotionally exhausted he felt like crying again, this time from sheer tiredness. His heart had been put though so much within the past twenty-four hours. Cas slowly sat down next to him and hugged his own knees.
Sam pulled Cas into a very strong hug. “We’re done. Cas, we’re not hunting anymore. I don’t care if you can heal us. We’re done.”
“I wish,” Dean nodded desperately, “I want you, Castiel. Please, stay. Cas, I need you. I love you, too. I’m done hunting, I’m done fighting. I want to live and have a family; I need to reconnect with everyone and tell them it’s over. I deserve my goddamn apple pie live, Cas. But I can’t have it with anyone else,” Dean confessed. Cas smiled, looked up, and closed his eyes. He let out a soft breath, and with it flew the blue light that Dean recognized as Castiel’s grace. He licked his lips and watched it flow into Cas’s pocket, where he pulled out a capsule on a chain.
“Oh, um, okay. Eileen, could you grab one of the heated blankets from our room? Dean, can you get some – hey, Dean?” Sam turned, and Cas followed his eyesight. Dean was now sat at the end of Castiel’s bed, and shit, he didn’t look okay either. Eileen returned; eyes wide as she looked at the scene unfolding. She placed the blanket on Cas, plugging it in. Sam stood back up, looking at Dean, now.
“Really, Angel?” The nickname slipped from his lips without thought. He felt the tension he had been carrying with him for years leave his shoulders as Cas shyly nodded. Dean laid his head down on Cas’s shoulder, trying to process the events of the night. He needed comfort, and his friend – boyfriend? – was right there, as always.
Cas felt his world shift. More tears shedding with each blink of his eyes, and his mouth dropping on its own accord. Dean leaned to Cas and shifted, placing his forehead against the ex-angels.
family, Dean,” Cas said, finally meeting Dean’s eyes. “I thought for the longest time we have been family. You always say I am. But am I not now that Sam’s gone?”
“I don’t need faith, Cas,” he bit out, the anger coming to the surface and leaking out through his teeth. He couldn’t keep it in. Castiel had a shitty life too, but somehow, he landed topside. Cas had a degree, a stable job that wouldn’t fire him when his back got too sore, and plenty of offers for sex or dating or whatever he wanted.
“I might not be able to fuck you yet, Dean,” he said, watching as Dean’s eyes widened, “But you certainly could do something.” Dean nodded. He licked his lips and grinned down at Cas, moving his hand to the waistband of Castiel’s sweatpants.
Dean lay in the hay where Sam had left him, but his face was calm, the blood was gone, and his chest rose and fell softly. Sam let out a soft sigh, tears trailing down his face again, as he realized that Dean – and Cas – were
Sam’s sobs were the only sound that filled the barn. Save for the rustling of the wind outside and the occasional muffled cry of an animal, Sam Winchester’s grief consumed the air around him, filling up the universe with sorrow. After everything he had been through with Dean, losing him to a simple hunt hurt more than he could process. Dean had just closed his eyes for the last time when Sam pulled him off the pole he had gotten pushed onto. He tried to ignore the bleeding, laying him down on the floor of the barn and wiping his eyes with his jacket sleeve. Sam took in one last deep breath and stood, turning on his heel to find the kids that his brother and he had managed to save.
Cas was good with words. Too good with them, Dean often thought. He had to hold himself back from making a face at the mention of Castiel’s church. He remembered being thirteen and Cas telling him how they were made to promise themselves to God. He remembered seeing one of the pastors on a sex offender list when he was fifteen and wanting to break into their horribly beautiful building and destroy the whole thing. He remembered Castiel painfully recalling being abused. He remembered having to sit with Cas during his first Christmas away from his church and family so he wouldn’t have a panic attack. Dean remembered how much Castiel’s church fucked him up.
“I’m in love,” Dean managed. His jaw was clenched so tightly that he was sure he’d need a visit to the dentist after this. Bobby frowned and leaned back in his seat. Dean could practically see Bobby’s brain putting pieces together. His stomach was turning in circles.
“That green button up over a black t-shirt with some nice black jeans will do.” Damn Cas for knowing his closet better than himself.
“Why are you so good?” Dean asked gruffly, watching as Cas turned his head to make eye contact. Cas frowned slightly, tilting his head. The fondness was back. He loved Cas.
“Never had a worse day,” his voice cracked slightly. “That’s when I got burned. He told me to move out the second I could. He said I had never disappointed him more. Said worse things that I can’t say. But I’ve never spoken about it. I knew I liked men. I knew, Cas. Everyone thinks I don’t know anything. Everyone thinks I’m just poor widower John Winchester’s good, stupid, straight son - ”
It was a normal weeknight for Dean and Cas, they chose to do their grocery shopping, and then go home to watch some Dr. Sexy reruns (Dean’s idea). Cas was nearly recovered, and Sam was doing well in school so far. He was making friends, joining clubs, and having a normal college experience. Dean was so proud of him. He and Cas were good. They spend a lot of time together these days since Dean was less busy ensuring Sam was where he needed to be. He had stopped picking up extra shifts at the bar, but still selling his plasma (“Come on, Cas! It’s easy money!”). Dean even joined Castiel on his outdoor excursions. They were when Cas felt the most connected to grace, it was where Dean felt safe. Maybe, Dean thought, maybe Cas was right. Maybe he did need faith in his life, just not the kind of faith that one would find in the pages of a dictionary or in the backrooms of an old church.
“Y-yes. Yes, I am. What – what happened? Is he okay?” Dean frantically asked, standing up from his chair so fast that it almost fell over. Sam rose too, walking closer to attempt to hear the conversation.
“You’re my family, Dean,” Cas smiled and stood up, moving to grab his backpack and continue the hike. Dean felt his heart start to crumble. He really thought…Cas was going somewhere with that. Maybe this not-God entity was watching out for Castiel, but Dean wanted to yell at whatever grace there was in the world for cursing him with the pain of loving a man with no interest in him.
“I’ve always been comforted by the presence of grace, Dean. Even at my old church. This is not religion. This is faith, belief in good, trust in the world. Love for beauty. You need grace, Dean. I’ve been watching how you act recently. You don’t think you deserve anything good. You want to just work yourself out, only relaxing when everyone else is gone. You’re going to dig yourself into a hole this way, Dean.”
“Dean…I thought those were…jokes. Oh my god. Dean, are you…do you…?” Cas was barely able to form a sentence. Dean looked back at his friend. What the hell? Did Cas
Fuck, he was in love. He was kissing the man he loved. He was with the man he loved. Castiel was kissing him. In this life, now.
“It’s fine, Cas, I was out of line, I know you just needed a fake boyfriend and I made the most sense, you didn’t mean to…you know, mock my feelings,” Dean swallowed, wishing that Cas would drop his hand.
“Sir? Are you and Castiel related? We need to know to let you into the room to see him while he is unconscious.”
It wasn’t a secret that Dean liked Castiel. Seven years of sharing an apartment made Dean soft for the other man. Cas was easy on the eyes, with beautiful blue eyes, hair that somehow always needed a trim, and a smile that made Dean’s heart flutter. Yeah, he was screwed. He knew he needed to get over him, but never had it in him to do anything that would help, such as move out or quit having their weekly movie nights. (They aren’t dates; he swears). Of course, Castiel knew how Dean felt. Everyone did. It was hard to ignore the fact that Dean smiled more around him and shared practically everything with him. They were friends in high school, but not very close. Dean had always had a bit of a thing for the other boy, but never did anything about it. He was still closeted at the time. When he and Cas found out they were both planning to stay in their hometown they chose an apartment together and that was when Dean realized that he had made a terrible mistake in choosing to room with the most attractive man he knew.
“I love you, Dean. In a way that angels shouldn’t be able to. I wish for nothing less than to shed my grace and let myself feel the humanity of love. But only if you wish too.”
he wondered to himself. No, he was present in his mind. Wait…he died. Dean rapidly ran to the nearest window in the room he woke up in. It was sunny, blue sky and green grass met his gaze. Was he in heaven? Dean pinched himself. It hurt. Then he heard the sound of keys in a doorknob and some laughing coming from what he could only assume was the kitchen. Weaponless and exhausted, Dean crept up slowly to the door, and just when it started to open, he threw himself against the body entering the house.
As Castiel spoke, Dean felt anger bubble in his chest. He didn’t need faith or grace or any of that shit. Faith was what broke Castiel in the first place. Love for others was what broke Dean. He was served a shitty slice of life, a dead mom, an abusive dad, and only himself to blame for his lack of love.
“When we were seniors, I told Charlie I liked boys and girls,” Dean said, glancing up to see Cas simply nodding, blue eyes searching for more, no judgment present. “She said I was bisexual and gave me a pin. My dad found it, Cas.”
“Hey Bobby,” he waved at the old man sitting behind the desk, who looked up from the paperwork before him. Dean walked over to his locker in the back, pulling a water bottle down and chugging it.
“Hand sandwich,” he whispered. Cas couldn’t help but snort. Dean missed him. God, Dean missed Cas. He had been avoiding him for fear he would leave. But he should have known better. This was Castiel. Cas needed Dean just as much as Dean needed him. Castiel was his friend. Maybe that was all they ever would have, but Dean would be okay. It would be okay. He squeezed his friend’s hand.
“No, it’s just a sense of calm I’ve gotten since accepting that I am part of a beautiful world. Dean, please, have some faith in the world. You look like you’re falling apart these days. Have some faith in me, I’m here for you. I always am.”
“Who’s there?” Sam called out into the dark, whipping out his flashlight, and as it clicked on, he found himself face to face with bright blue eyes and a face of shock.
The Winchester brothers ate their eggs in silence. Dean had almost forgotten that Cas was missing when he got a call from a number he didn’t recognize. It was in their area code, so he took another bite of eggs and pulled it up to his ear.
Dean blinked, looked at Cas’s face for an explanation. There was nothing but a small smile. Was this…did Cas…? His heart was starting to pick up in pace and his hands started to sweat.
“Mornin, sunshine. How do you feel?” Dean asked. Cas sighed and dropped his head back toward Dean to give him better access. He felt Dean’s breath on his neck. Castiel’s heart was still running wildly.
said Cas. Dean was glad no one ever said anything. Sam knew a little. He tried to talk to Dean about it, but Dean never budged. Eileen tried a few times to get through to him. Bobby noticed. Ellen and Jo would cut him off if he seemed out of it. They knew.
“I’m…” he couldn’t get any more words out, his throat closed. Dean blinked away unshed tears and Bobby smacked his hands before he could wipe his oil-covered hands all over his eyes.
“Hey, sweetie, how you doing? Better than this morning?” Meg asked, and Dean tried and failed to contain his sigh.
“No,” Dean said, smiling a little, although very tense. “I’ve been watching him since he was born, okay. I won’t know what to do with the empty apartment.” Dean knew the reason he had been avoiding his friend and brother was because it was starting to really hit Dean how old he was getting. The other boys at the garage all had wives and girlfriends to go home to. His friends were all telling him he should start dating. They had tried to set him up numerous times, but Dean declined every time. He was in love with Castiel, and one of these days Cas was going to meet a smart young man who would sweep him off his feet with his large vocabulary and wisdom. Dean was going to sit in his empty apartment and become the next John Winchester. Tired, bitter, and lonely. Only he wouldn’t take his anger out on anyone but himself. Dean wouldn’t hurt a fly in the way that John had. Dean would work at the garage until his back gave out, then would work at a grocery store or something until he drank himself to death.
After chugging the three beers and removing his jeans and overshirt, Dean got in his bed without even washing his face. Let the tears wash his face tonight, Dean was too hurt to bother. He didn’t want to run into Castiel in the bathroom or hallway. Shit, was Cas still expecting him at the event tomorrow? He ran a hand over his gross and tear-tracked face. He’d see tomorrow. For now, he let himself wallow in his misery. How could Cas do this to him? Castiel asked him to pretend to be boyfriends, put on a movie about roommates in love, and pretend the entire time that he had no idea that Dean was in love with him already. Cas knew. Everyone knew. Dean let his touches linger, smiled at him when he wasn’t looking, let him drive Baby. He turned over in his bed. Sleep didn’t come easily that night.
“Right! Right, yeah. Dating. Castiel and I.” Dean’s ears were practically ringing with the emotions swirling around his head. Lying to a random nurse was one thing, but Dean felt bad lying to Garth. He managed a tight smile. “Sam, let’s let Garth here work alone, how do you feel about a coffee?”
Dean whined to Castiel. They were sitting in Dean’s bedroom, the silence of the small house overwhelming. Sam was still at an afterschool event, and John…Dean didn’t know where John was most afternoons. They went to Dean’s after school most days, usually to play a video game (Dean’s idea) or study (Cas’s idea). Friends and neighbors since the age of ten, it was surprising to Dean that Cas still stuck by him. He was brash, stupid, and undeniably too loud. Cas was smart, careful, and too kind for his own good.
Sam had to know. The kid was seventeen, working full-time over the summer at the Roadhouse with his friend Jo, whose mom owned the place. Dean eventually fell into a routine of picking Sam up from his shift at ten, dropping him at the library, where Cas was also just getting off a shift, and then returning to bartend for four or five hours. This way he could avoid Cas telling him all about whatever smart man was at the library today begging for Cas’s attention. Dean knew he wasn’t the only one who wanted Castiel. He almost wished that Cas would settle down with one of them and move out, so that when Sam left for college, Dean would have the place to himself.
Now Sam was holding him together. Waiting in a tiny chair next to his unconscious friend was unbearable. Sam tried and failed to keep up a conversation, but eventually left the room silent save for the beeping coming from Cas’s monitor.
” that Dean would never understand despite having read both several times. What he was doing hanging around with a mechanic was beyond him.
