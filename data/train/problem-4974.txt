. As he watched Dean, he saw him dig into his pocket, and retrieve something— a packet of cigarettes. Dean pulled one out and brought it to his lips, before digging into his bag for the lighter.
It started with a fleeting conversation.
"—but I couldn't do it. I couldn't be a monster. But I promise you, Cas, and please take my word for this, Alastair won't ever bother you again. After what I did—"
Dean paused. He continued to state up at their linked hands hovering in the air above them, before quirking his lips in the slightest.
"Does it hurt?"
In his mind, Dean could see, clear as day, the moment from the day before, when he'd been watching Novak, and the moment he had leaned forward on his desk, the thin strap at the back of his panties had slipped between his ass.
he wondered,
Eyes wide, mouth hung open, and his cigarette trembling between his fingers, almost of the verge of falling, Dean gaped at Castiel, absolutely stunned, and Castiel simply stared at him.
A hand cupped over Castiel's crotch, and he let out a soft moan, eyebrows furrowing as he held onto the man's shoulder. The man chuckled darkly in his ear, before muttering a deep, rumbling, "
"Castiel, hey."
, and squeezed his thighs around Dean's face. Their breaths hung in the air, loud and expectant, until at last, Dean pulled his head out of Castiel's thighs. Castiel fluttered his eyes open, feeling his spent cock twitch at the sight of Dean, his hair a completely crazy mess, his eyes narrow with lust, and his lips slick with spit drooling down his chin. He sat back on his knees for a moment, and rubbed the back of his palm across his lips before sending Castiel a smirk and climbing off the bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Alastair. With Nick and Gordon at his side.
"Jus' scrollin'," Dean shrugged, and they settled into compatible silence. Had it been Castiel in place of Benny, he would have eaten off Dean's right ear and started his way to the left with his stories. And hey, Dean would've let him too. Guy's adorable, no one's immune to him.
"And? Let them— they're just—
A pair of rushed footsteps echoed through the passageway, and Castiel paused his pacing to turn to the source of the sound. Rushing from down the corridors, was Dean, with Benny at his back. Dean's stern face brightened, and he reached out to pull Castiel into a tight hug.
Slowly, Dean trudged over to join Castiel by his side.
excitement, as they kissed. Hot, wet, desperate— it was unlike Dean had ever seen Castiel before, and if he had time to think about something other than Cas, he'd probably think of how surprising it was to watch Castiel take the lead like this.
The sound of a throat clearing pulled both Dean and Cas out of their moment, and they turned to the side to find Mr. Singer watching them from a few feet away. Oh shit, Bobby saw them? Saw them
With that, Dean dragged a dry thumb down Castiel's taint, and heard Castiel let out a breathy moan. Dean spat down on Castiel's ass, and watched the string of spit drip down to the man's tight, pink puckered hole. Dean shoved his thumb inside, and pulled the hole apart, toying with it and tugging at it, all the while Castiel was a moaning, whining mess under him.
"We won't make him suffer, Anna," Castiel said with conviction as he pressed a hand to Anna's back, "—we're just going to give him a taste of his own medicine. And if that entails suffering, we can't help it."
"Look, I'm not gonna' get all pally-pally with you just cause you're friends with Cas, but look, I've been where you have, I know how it feels to want to fit in, okay? And sometimes, when we want something so desperately, we end up making bad choices and taking the wrong decisions. I don't blame you for not knowing better, but you can't keep living with that burden holding you down," Dean sighed, and his eyes wandered downward, "—all you can do is think twice before making another decision, and move on. Alright?"
"We will too."
"Cas, I want you to know that none of what happened yesterday was your fault. It was Alastair, it was that sonovuabitch that deserved to be be hurt. If I wasn't human, I'd do the same thing to him that he did to you—"
"Hello Sam," He smiled, and brushed his fingers through Sam's hair before joining Dean at the kitchen counter. Dean was cutting up some vegetables, and Castiel slipped his arms around Dean's stomach. "What are you doing?"
"Yeah, yeah," Mr. Singer hummed, a bit flustered, before he set his glasses on his nose, and pulled a binder from a stack on the desk. He flipped it open, and Castiel watched in silence, as he ran his finger down the page, before giving a satisfied hum, "—according to the information I have, Alastair is scheduled to come back on the second Monday from now, so you have
, parted as the boy let out a noise. Dean's cock twitched in his underwear and he wondered for a moment, what other noises the boy could make, especially if he had a large, ten-inch-cock rawing his asshole.
"Well, it's only the most mainstream album. Music-wise, Zeppelin IV is
Early surprise!
"You know, no matter how nice you are to me, I ain't gon' delete those pictures."
A few mumbled
"I'm here," Castiel said from almost a foot away. Gordon stepped forward, and though Castiel wanted to move back, his feet were rooted to the ground. "What did you want from me, Gordon."
He really thought Dean Winchester would stand up for him.
"Do the bruises hurt?" He asked in a whisper, and for a moment Castiel was dumbfounded as to what he was talking about, before it struck him. Dean had spent the rest of their Sunday fucking and cuddling, and listening to music, nothing else. And man, had it been rough. Bruises littered all over Castiel's body, bites all across his neck— it would have been more believable to tell people he'd fought a gorilla than tell them his boyfriend fucked like an animal. Of course, the uniform thankfully hid the marks, but the moment Castiel was in his casual clothes, anybody could see them.
understand the intensity of being raped and abused? And these aren't allegations, these are facts. We have witnesses to account for these. We have a line of students ready to tell you just how much Alastair Knight has wrecked havoc in their lives. But nobody has been willing to come up and speak about it." Castiel said, and watched as Mrs. Berry studied him.
"Thank you," Castiel mumbled against Dean's chest. "I was scared they wouldn't take me seriously. But I think Anna sealed the deal."
"No, you didn't do anything. Just things Dean and I should have spoken about sooner. But it's alright. So," Castiel paused and turned to the rest of the table. "So, guys, we've got Anna now, and she's a great ally. Anna, you've got good reach in our batch, good friends too. Think you could popularize our website and help us get more support?"
Their eyes met, and Dean's fingers paused on Castiel's face.
"Cas— Castiel—" Dean called out, and leaped right out of his chair, following after Castiel. There was only one place Castiel could have gone.
"Then you should have done that ages ago. No point in crying now, huh, kid?"
And Castiel was a surprisingly good kisser.
"Yeah."
"Why? Why did you want to know?" Castiel asked, and reached a hand out to Dean's face, to brush some of his sweaty hair aside. The action so casual and domestic, it had Dean's heart skipping a beat.
And he couldn't wait to go see Cas after school.
"Okay," Dean sighed, "-do you want to switch the lights off?"
"Saved by Devereaux," He sighed, and his sidekicks, Nick and Gordon, brushed past Castiel roughly, bumping against his shoulders, before at last, Alastair walked past him. For a moment, he paused beside Castiel, and leaned into his ear. Castiel froze, his body tensing up in anticipation of something rough—
Dean almost choked on his spit as his eyes widened, and he dropped his mouth open to say something,
"Castiel, we're counting on you, alright?" Anna smiled, and Castiel felt more at peace with the love he could feel thrumming in his veins from the rest of them. Castiel sucked in a breath.
Given their history.
"Must be desert time
Dean grabbed Castiel by his jaw, blunt nails digging into Castiel's supple skin, not hurting, simply pressing, as Dean compelled Castiel to meet his eye.
With a smile, Castiel went home that evening, fucking himself on a dildo to the memories of the stranger's lusty green eyes and thick, pink monster cock.
Castiel narrowed his eyes at Dean, and Dean laughed. Castiel had this adorable, strange thing he did when he didn't understand something. He tilted his head to the side and squinted his eyes, as if trying to figure it out, and it never failed to make Dean smile, "-is it not a valid enough reason for me to care about you?" He asked, with his signature head tilt, and honestly, how would Dean even argue against him?
Even when they regarded Dean, their faces remained stoic as ever.
"Where's your pal?"
"I'm sorry you were scared of me, Cas."
Michael seemed impressed with that, as he leaned back in his seat, and sent Dean a scrutinising look. "Alright, let's start easy. Ford Mustang. Who created it?"
Castiel snorted, and flipped the menu around, before deciding on a cheeseburger with a side of fries. Something on the side of the table flickered, and his eyes snapped over to where Dean's phone was sitting. On the lock screen, however, was a picture of him, in the Impala, laughing and eating a hamburger. His eyes widened as he reached for Dean's phone for a better look.
"Dean," Dean paused, and stared up at Cas, whose teary eyes roamed across his face with such admiration, it almost made Dean sick that Castiel could
. His youthful exuberance, his warm, tender touch, and how carefree he was— nothing like the uptight, stuck-up, cold
"Y-yeah?"
"That's amazing, baby, I mean, I don't know what to say. I'm just glad, mostly." Dean smiled, and clapped a hand over Castiel's shoulder.
The clock struck 2:45 PM, and the five of them exchanged a glance at each other, before turning back to Tessa, who simply sent them a tight smile. She typed at her computer, and paid no mind to the students seated a few feet away from her. Then, the door to the Principal's office clicked open, and all eyes snapped over to see. A man in a suit, followed by Mrs. Berry, who was smiling and nodding her head, walked out of the office. The man glanced at the children, before walking out the hallway, and at last, Mrs. Berry's eyes shifted onto the group of teenagers seated in the waiting lounge.
"Like shit I'm letting you alone with him."
"I see you, Dean. And you matter to me. A lot."
The sexual frustration, paired with Michael's incomprehension of Castiel's high libido, and the painfully boring and innocent conversations between them had pushed Castiel to a new height of anger.
Castiel let out a choked whine as he came, splattering hot, thick white come across his chest. Dean followed not long after, coming inside Castiel deep and thick. His seed spread around the insides of Castiel's hole, leaving him sticky and slick and wet, but instead of pushing out the come inside him, Dean plugged Castiel up with his gorgeous pink glass plug. A small, thin drizzle of come trickled down Castiel's taint. Dean ran a finger through it before holding the finger out in front of Castiel.
of all people.
been my home screen for weeks."
"Thanks kid, I owe you."
Below him, Dean jerked Castiel off, and Castiel came in a few minutes, causing him to go sensitive and limp, and at this point, Dean was holding Castiel up by his hips as he pounded into the man, watching his tight hole swallow up Dean's cock so hungrily.
Michael nodded. "That's the spirit of a man, god, I like you, I do like you, Winchester. And I might like you more if you lost to me."
"Mother," Castiel shouted, almost enraged, but Dean couldn't help but snap back at Naomi. Each second had Dean's blood boiling, especially now that she had taken it to Mary.
"Cas, will you listen to me, please—"
With a crooked grin, Alastair unbuckled his belt, and pushed his zipper down.
Castiel could hear every sound of Dean's footsteps in the aisle behind him.
"You're not wrong, that's a really good idea. A peaceful protest. Technically, we have freedom of speech, also freedom of assembly, and hey, as long as there's no fighting, we can protest for having Alastair and his goons suspended. But Dean," Castiel sighed, "—have you ever thought about how things could turn over
"Of course," Dean smiled, and stepped away. Castiel watched as Benny and Meg stole a quick glance at each other, before turning their eyes away. Castiel stepped back, and let the four of them gather around behind him, before he turned back to knock on Mr. Singer's door. A few seconds passed, before at last, the door swung open, and at the front stood Mr. Singer, slightly rumpled, but otherwise fine.
Dean swallowed tightly, his cock now achingly hard and waiting to bury itself in something warm and pliant, as he pushed his thumb inside. But the next moment, his mouth dropped open as he felt Castiel's insides slick and sticky around his finger.
With every step closer, Castiel felt his heart pound in his chest. The sound resonated in his mind, almost driving him crazy with anticipation.
"You're not mad at me, right?" Round, deep green eyes stared into Castiel's, pleading like a puppy, and Castiel couldn't help but smile.
"Michael?" Castiel asked, feigning an innocent look.
All he could do was stand, and hear his father's sharp grumbling from the kitchen.
"And you won't hurt anyone?"
"No, uhm, it's alright. I should erm," Castiel shifted nervously for a second, before turning away, "—I'm going to get a jacket, it's getting colder in here."
But then again. Staying would only have hurt Castiel. And wasn't he doing enough of that already?
It seemed unreal, and Castiel fought with himself to give into the dream, or to get a grip on himself.
Doing anything to make a place for yourself.
, and turned his eyes down to the picture again. If he was being honest, it wasn't that bad, and the fact that Dean had made it his lock screen
"Hello?"
Dean shrugged, and nudged Castiel down on the edge of the bed, before dropping down to a crouch before him.
"This isn't about you. This is about Anna." Castiel grumbled, before slapping his hands down on the table and leaping out of his chair. Dean and the crew watched, dumbstruck, as Castiel stormed away out of the library.
Absently, he reached out to graze his knuckles down the bruise on Dean's jaw. Castiel's own face stung with a few bruises.
"Don't accuse him, okay? Just, just ask him, quietly. Be calm. Dean you—" Benny sighed, "—just remember you'll never be able to see the world from his eyes. You'll never be able to feel the pain and the hurt and the regret that he did on Friday. So just go easy on him, okay?"
"Maybe not scared. Just, just worried, I guess."
"I— I didn't expect to see you here."
"You probably think I'm a loser for crying right now, but I'm— I'm sorry, Cas, I never meant to cry or whatever, I just— I keep thinking about everything. About who we are. What we used to be. What we could be. I just— I've never had good things in my life before," And as Dean said it, the tears pooling in his eyes slipped down his face, prompting Castiel's own eyes to well up, "—I've never known what it feels like to be in love with someone, or to devote myself to someone. I've never felt love the way you love me. Every day, all I can think of is being a better man for you, being a man you would be proud of, a man you deserve. Sometimes I just find it hard to accept that you're here, and you're mine."
Castiel pulled away at once, eyes wide and ecstatic as he jumped up to his feet, and dragged Dean up with him.
"I swear, I swear on you," Dean pressed a hand over Castiel's chest, "—I wasn't, I just wanted her to leave sooner—"
Castiel's laugh faded into a smile, and he ran a finger down Dean's face. "Every time you smile at me, I feel like I'm falling in love with you again too."
"You think you're funny?"
"Let's stick to Bobby, school hours are over, kid," Bobby sighed, and Dean stared at him for a moment before turning his passive gaze down to his shoes.
you're gonna' kill me someday, sweetheart."
"Well," Naomi started, obviously flustered by Dean's comment, "—I just think he isn't working hard enough."
, he thought he was going to fall. Dean simply laughed, and set him down on the floor, breath panting from laughter. Castiel peeked an eye open, glad he wasn't dead yet, before punching Dean in the chest.
"Tell me what?"
"You walked all the way here?" Dean's eyes hardened, and he towered over Castiel, hands on his hips as he glared down. "Cas, it's past nine in the evening, it's cold as balls out there, and you walked here, all alone. What were you thinking, Cas? What if someone jumped you? What if someone did something to you while you were all alone? God, Cas, why can't you see it— people are bad, alright, and they see someone like you walking alone they're gonna' try and—"
"Going to make you feel good, Cas, trust me, baby— would never hurt you, never." Dean mumbled, and as slowly as he could, pushed his cock in.
"Since yesterday, 'cause it's my lock screen. But it
And yet, all he could see was the sight of Lisa and Dean laughing.
Castiel smiled, eyes brightening as he pressed against Dean's side, sliding an arm around his waist to nuzzle into his neck. Perhaps it was the sudden realisation that Dean was here, that he had always been there for Castiel, and how Castiel was lucky enough to have someone who loved him unconditionally.
"So, you'd much rather let a rapist stay in your school to protect your reputation? Wow. That's very noble of you to do, Mrs.
Castiel blinked his teary eyes up at Dean for a moment. They were puffy, swollen, and red at the rims, and yet, it was the way they stared into Dean's soul that still managed to baffle Dean.
WARNING: Recollections of Rape/Violence.
"I just want you to be happy—"
. Dean wasn't touching him, not a single finger, and yet, it was by far, the most diabolical thing Dean had done to Castiel. He'd made Castiel sit through his lecture with an ass full of Dean's, thick, sticky semen, and a large, ribbed plug.
tell you is that your mind plays a huge role in how fast you heal. The more positive you are that you're strong, and that you're going to get better, the sooner you'll be fine. That also being said, no sexual activity for a while, got it?"
"Good," Castiel sighed, his eyes wandering into the distance, "—because I'm pretty sure my mom's going to kick me out."
Meg paused for a moment, before giving a sad smile.
"What the fuck—" Strong fists crumpled the front of Castiel's t-shirt, and slammed him against the door, causing Castiel's shoulders to hurt and he let out a pained whine.
"Dean—" Benny warned, his eyes wide and face pale, "-I'll rip your tongue out if you finish that sentence."
s and
Unable to find his voice, Dean simply watched Castiel, before croaking out hoarsely, "—The things he said about you, I should've emptied a whole fucking pistol into his head then and there—"
Castiel's smile dropped in an instant, and he huffed, turning his head away from Dean, who read through the notes.
times." Dean sighed, and reached out to grab himself a bottle of water from the fridge. Castiel pursed his lips, sharing a guilty look with Meg before walking over to press a discreet kiss to Dean's lips. But the moment Castiel pulled back, Dean, shameless as he was, pulled him back in for another kiss, and Castiel gave in. Meg, to her credit, was respectfully looking away, until Castiel broke their kiss and cleared his throat.
"Use your words, Castiel," Dean growled, as he pounded into Castiel's tight, little boypussy, and had him arching his back with every thrust. Dean could feel Castiel's searing hot, moist flesh suck him in deeper, and he let out a staggered breath, feeling his orgasm creeping through his gut as he fucked Castiel.
Oh. Dean thought forcing Castiel to expose himself was
Whatever. Their fault for watching.
The finger was dry, and yet, it teased Castiel's tiny pucker, rubbing the rim, poking inside, grazing with light touches, and prodding so obscenely that it almost had Castiel shaking in Dean's lap.
John seemed to consider it for a few seconds, before grumbling a
Dean's hand hovered hesitantly in the air between them. "Cas," He breathed out.
And then it dwindled.
, Castiel was twisting his ear, and Dean yelped (for real, this time), and pushed Castiel away.
"Say please," Dean warned, and Castiel held onto the armrest of the couch to keep himself steady as Dean pounded him— ruthless and rough, not bothering to care for Castiel anymore as Dean sought his release, and chased the gut-curling sensation of his orgasm bolting through his cock.
"What is it?"
This had to be the best accident possible.
"I won't. For you, I never will."
He couldn't tell what it was.
to the world, and kiss him right then and there, not caring for who watched them, wanting everyone to know Dean was his, only his.
"It's eight in the morning, Dean."
"God, we should do that everyday." Castiel sighed, and felt Dean chuckle against his chest.
Quietly, he plugged his earphones into the earphone jack, and pressed play on his favourite playlist. At once, Led Zeppelin's Tangerine blasted through the earphones, and he hummed along to the tune. He grabbed his workbook, and flipped open to the chapter they were being tested on after lunch. It was their last lecture for the day, after which they would be on their way home. Castiel skimmed through the questions, feeling his memory jog and the images from the night before flashed clearly in his mind.
"You were great, Cas. I'm so proud of you." Dean whispered into his hair, rubbing a soothing hand down Castiel's back. He felt Castiel's hands crumple his shirt.
"Dean," Came the softest of sounds, "-thank you for coming back."
"Who's at the door?" John shouted from inside the kitchen, and Dean sighed.
Dean was busy chewing, and he didn't want to embarrass himself by speaking whilst eating, but Castiel spoke up on his behalf. "Oh, mother, Dean got into Lawrence High on a scholarship. He's the smartest boy in my class, great grades, a high GPA, he's everything you've ever wanted from me."
"Your cock, daddy, please—"
"I'm just observant."
As Castiel walked into the classroom, however, his eyes darted over to where Dean was seated behind him, and on his lap, Lisa Braeden, playing with his short, spiky hair— hair that Castiel loved running his hand through. She pressed her tits against Dean's chest, and Castiel watched, as she rolled her hips on his thighs, a coy attempt at showing Dean how voluptuous she was. Castiel stood rooted to the ground, crumpling the book in his hand, as she whispered something against Dean's ear, and giggled. Dean smirked, a boyish, charming grin, and Castiel felt bile rise up in his throat.
But Castiel never let him finish, because the moment Dean had opened his mouth, Castiel launched himself forward, throwing his arms around Dean and pressing his lips to the others'. Dean stood, frozen and unresponsive for a moment, before he tentatively wrapped an arm around Castiel's waist and pulled him close in a hug.
"I- I am."
"And then, once he's all tied down and naked, I'll split him open slowly, making sure he feels every thrust, every inch, every push— I'll make sure he knows I'm fucking him as hard as I can—"
And maybe Dean just did.
"I know," Dean sighed, and his lips found Castiel's again as they rocked against each other, "-but I love you, Cas, and you're mine, only mine. I just want to live somewhere I can tell that to everyone."
, did he?
to do was cry. He let his contacts scroll down to the
Dean's eyes hardened, and he rose up on his elbow. "Why?"
I'm in the middle of a lot school stress, so I must also focus on that. Thank you for your lovely comments and support! 😄🥰
Castiel smiled at that, tugging Dean down for a kiss as he spread his legs open, ready for another round.
"Now we're getting somewhere. Beg for it harder," Dean grit out, and tugged a fistful of Castiel's hair, before slipping his fingers out, and slapping Castiel's ass with a loud, clamouring
"I don't want him to contact our parents."
A few moments must have passed, before Dean found a question he didn't understand, and he turned to Castiel. Castiel sighed for a moment, before hopping off the seat and onto the bed. He scooched his butt towards Dean, and sat with his back pressed against the wall, leaning into Dean's space, and although it didn't seem intentional, Dean could feel the warmth of his body radiating towards him, and he breathed in Castiel's gentle, minty scent, before letting his eyes wander down to the questionnaire.
As if it burnt his skin, Dean tore his hands away from Castiel's body, and recoiled back, putting a good foot between them, eyes now passive and grey as he realised—
The pressure hit, and Dean came, so so deep inside Castiel. Castiel cried out Dean's name, his face a picture of pure fucked-out ecstasy.
Castiel chuckled over the line, before muttering "—go back to class, Dean." And hung up.
"Let's go, Cas."
"Are you sure?"
"Cas—" Came the expected, breathless call for Castiel's name, and Castiel watched as Dean doubled over and clutched his knees, panting for breath a few feet away from where Castiel leaned against the wall, "-hold, hold on."
"I'm sorry," Castiel mumbled, "-are we friends?"
"But," Castiel sat up, and turned to Dean, "-every song on Zeppelin IV is a masterpiece. Rock and Roll? Black Dog? Stairway to Heaven? Misty Mountain Hop? When the Levee Breaks? Gem after gem— they're Zeppelin's most critically iconic songs?!"
"Dean, I—"
"Are you going to sit here and smoke?"
almost kill someone for him. But there it was again, the thrill. The thrill of knowing that Dean had done it
"Let me guess, Alastair Knight's suspension?"
"Cut the crap, Dean, you're tired of me. I get it."
Dean grinned, and maybe if Castiel glanced behind, he would have been able to see his tail wagging too. Dean was, in some way, a puppy who trailed Castiel around, and Castiel couldn't help but be amused. They bid Benny and Meg goodbye, and Castiel slipped into the passenger seat of Dean's car. Dean, revved the engine to life, before reversing them out of the parking, and driving down onto the main street.
, and Castiel stared at the way his face pinkened. It was a rare sight, but delightful nonetheless, and Castiel chuckled. He flicked his finger against Dean's cheek, and leaned in to press a kiss to his jaw.
, what the fuck was Dean supposed to do? He had let out a gasp already, and Castiel had realised that he'd seen it. It had been awkward as heck, and then there had been the fucking pen. Who owns a single pen in a huge fucking house? And
"I erm, I was going for a walk this morning, I erm, I needed some air and I thought I'd give you your notebooks too, so you could have ample time to study for the test on Monday, because surely, you don't expect me to write both yours
Castiel considered it for a moment, and Dean killed the engine. The two of them stepped out of the car, and walked over to the front door where Dean jangled a small bunch of keys in his hands. "Let's wait for Sam, 'kay?"
"Yeah? Awh, I'm sorry, I'll knock next time, okay?" Dean snorted. The boy kicked him in the ankle, and damn it, he was feisty, wasn't he? But that's alright, Dean liked them
"I know," Castiel mumbled against Dean's neck, and ran a hand through his hair, "—thank you for standing up for me, Dean. I don't know what I would have done without you—"
Alastair Knight. Why are you guys here?"
There was no space left between them anymore, and Castiel had been pinned against the corner of the wall, with the man pressed into his chest, not leaving an ounce of distance between them. Fucking pervert. He was having fun with it, wasn't he? Pressing into Castiel,
as he jumped out his seat and trailed after Castiel. If he had a tail, it would be wagging side to side in high spirits, and Castiel seemed to chuckle at his excitement. They let their belongings remain where they were (who would steal a Chemistry textbook? Castiel wouldn't be surprised if someone left their own for lease), and sneaked out of the library, into the emergency stairwell. Castiel climbed up the stairs, and Dean followed after him, until they were stepping onto the terrace. It seemed to be an unspoken acknowledgement between them to sit on the place they
. Now you know why.
Castiel fidgeted with the hem of his sleeve, nervous, but annoyed. He wasn't in any mind to deal with Alastair at all. What with Dean, what with their fight, Castiel was
Maybe it was the fact that his skin remembered both of their crude, vulgar touches, but the moment they looked at him, Castiel felt his chest constrict. His throat tightened, and sucking in air seemed like a herculean task. The sound of people speaking in the background seemed to fade away, and all Castiel could comprehend was the sound of Gordon's laughter as his fingers pushed inside Castiel, rough and assaulting. The sound of Nick taunting Castiel, calling him a fag, shoving his crotch into Castiel's face— Castiel couldn't breathe. He wanted to reach out to Dean, he wanted to call out his name, he wanted to scream, shout, and beg for Dean to be by his side, but absently, Dean had wandered ahead, assuming Castiel was right behind him.
underestimating Dean, so he wouldn't have gone as far as leaving the party, which meant he was somewhere in the farmhouse with his two, loyal knuckleheads. If Dean was lucky, Alastair would be drunk enough to be caught off-guard, just the way Castiel was when Alastair found him. Oh, how Dean wished he was a crueler person so he could put Alastair through the same thing he put Cas through, but some semblance of righteousness still prevailed in Dean's mind, and he hoped a good, long thrashing would show Alastair his place.
"Of course."
"I'm sorry," He grumbled, "—and thank you, for looking out for Cas."
"Novak," Dean whispered, "-what's the answer to the first one?"
Benny sighed, and in a split second, let go of Dean's hand. "Please, Dean, I know you're not thinking straight—"
Dean paused in his tracks, and Castiel watched his face falter as he struggled for words, before grabbing Castiel by the hands and rubbing his thumb over the ring on, Castiel's finger, "—hey, sweetheart, you know I didn't mean it that way. I just, didn't know how else to put it. I'm sorry."
see how red Castiel's face was. It was unlike Castiel, who Dean knew could be a cheeky, arrogant cock-tease, but it was cute— this nervous side of Cas, and Dean wouldn't complain.
Castiel felt his chest ache for both Dean and Meg. He wondered why he never felt the need to fit in. Perhaps, he did— always had, and that's why he used OnlyPics. Maybe that was how he coped.
Okay, whatever, it was
"Always ready to help my boys."
"Oh," Castiel scoffed, a bite to his words, "—but don't you already?"
"Yes, erm, the thing is—" Anna began, but at her hesitance, Castiel placed a hand on her shoulder.
Castiel must be hurting. He must be in pain, he might be
"You're—"
"Stop smiling, you look like an idiot."
"Alastair's going to—"
"You too, Masters. I'll see you soon." Mr. Singer smiled, and tipped his head to acknowledge them.
"Let go of me, right now—"
"But uhm, I don't understand why the four of you are against him. I mean, Dean, you practically kissed his ass throughout junior year, no offense, and Meg, you— you
"For the past three days, I have been handing out fliers about Lawrence High's new anti-bullying club. And I thought this class would be much more interactive about it considering that Lawrence High's most notorious student, Alastair Knight, is a part of this class. But the response is pathetic." Castiel sounded firm, each word said with raw conviction as his eyes glazed over the classroom. They trailed over each row of students, but never faltered.
Dean quirked his lip. "Fair enough. Okay, Cas," He growled, and slipped his knee between Castiel's thighs, "-are you alone? Be honest, lying will only get you dead."
Dean wanted to throw up.
"How did you…" Cas asked softly, "-how did you find out?"
"What's funny, fag?"
Because his expressions seemed to darken, his eyes grew deeper and cleared his throat, more to school himself than the others, as his eyes lingered upon Castiel's spread thighs. When their eyes met again, Castiel smirked, and as softly as possible, rocked down on the large, long plug inside him. Now to anyone who didn't know better, they'd think Castiel was simply trying to get comfortable in his seat. But Dean? Dean knew. Dean knew Castiel was fucking himself on a large, cock-shaped butt plug, and that's right, Castiel was the one doing the teasing now.
Castiel smiled, and leaned against the counter to wrap his arms around Dean's waist and bury his face into Dean's chest.
"No," Anna breathed out, and Meg's eyes snapped up to meet hers, "—he didn't."
Next update: 15 March.
Dean was silent for a while as they hugged, and it allowed Castiel to bask in the peace, before Dean pulled away, and sat down on the chair next to the hospital bed.
He couldn't any longer.
"That was tiring." Anna sighed as the five of them walked down to the library. Castiel nodded, letting his shoulders loosen at last, feeling relief flood his veins at the thought of going home— well, to Dean's home for now.
"I'm sorry to break apart for a moment, but I need lube, alright? And a condom."
Something soft, warm and wet pressed against his lips, and Dean's breath hitched.
"I have a favour to ask."
An unexpected smile pulled at Castiel's lips, and he leaned into press a kiss to Dean's lips, only for the door to swing open. He paused, and both of them pulled away with a sigh before facing Dr. Sunders, who seemed to turn slightly flustered.
"It's okay, baby, it's okay, I'm, I understand. But," Dean sat back on his knees, and took Castiel's hands into his own, "—I won't do anything reckless, okay? I won't do anything to hurt you. And I love you so much, Cas, I can't tell you— and I can't, I can't, I can't—"
"The only reason I'm here is because I want to see Alastair Knight suffering. And if you can help me see it, I'll be eternally grateful to you."
"If something isn't up to par on the contract, we can have it revised. How's that sound?"
"I hate you," He grumbled, and turned away from Dean, letting the tears at his eyes stream down his face unabashedly as he squirmed his hand out of Dean's grip, but Dean wouldn't let him go.
selfie of him in bed, and Dean replied with a heart-eyes GIF. Something— no, somebody nudged him in the side, and he turned around to meet his classmate, a boy whose name he wasn't quite sure of, since he hadn't really taken the time to know everyone.
Castiel grit his teeth, and sucked in a short breath, fists curling into a clench, but he didn't look back. Nope, he wouldn't spare a single glance.
"If sharing it with us makes you feel better, please by all means, go for it. And don't worry about Benny or Dean, they're harmless. We won't say a word to anyone, if that makes you comfortable."
And for once, it became clear— all too clear.
"I swear, I will never understand what is so exciting about fighting people, about beating them up and—" Castiel was rambling, but Dean couldn't be less bothered, as he grabbed Castiel's hand, and yanked him back. Castiel yelped, and turned around, crashing straight into Dean's chest as their eyes met, and Dean hitched a breath. Close, they were too close, and Dean let his hand fall away from Castiel's arm as he stepped back. It wasn't until a few seconds later, when Castiel uttered a soft
"You passed out. My best guess, vasovagal syncope."
"Good night," Meg said, and now that Castiel noticed, it was quite dark outside, somewhere around seven in the evening. He smiled, and watched as she walked away and slipped into a black car standing at a corner. The car pulled onto the main street, and disappeared at the curve.
He knew how it felt. He'd lived through it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel quirked a lip, and followed after Dean who slipped out of the car, and slammed the door shut behind him. They eyed the diner for a few moments, before Dean stretched his arms above his head and yawned. Castiel snorted, and wrapped his hand around Dean's arm with a smile.
"You've been strange these past few days."
"Bad enough."
"Attaboy, c'mon, let's get you some ice-cream, something to balance out all that salt from the crying," Dean snorted, hoping at least his lame attempts at joking would lighten the air between them, and thankfully, Castiel giggled— it was a laugh, but it was too cute to be a laugh. Dean helped him up to his feet, and led him into the kitchen.
The plug fell to the ground, and Castiel's fingers, now slippery from lube and Dean's old, still thick come in his ass, reached back to hook through Dean's tie, as he yanked Dean closer, and ghosted his lips over Dean's ear.
Castiel pouted with a
"Would you have?" Dean snarled, "-if someone tried to rape Andr—"
It shouldn't have hurt Castiel as much as it did, and yet, it felt as if an anchor had been tied to his heart to pull him down deeper into the pits of an ocean of despair.
Castiel swallowed thickly, before rounding the corner, when at once— broad, rough hands grabbed him by the shoulders, and shoved him back into a wall. Castiel gasped, eyes widening as his gaze met a familiar pair of apple-green eyes, staring down at him with such admiration it had his face flushing pink with heat. Dean was dressed in his usual, a black canvas jacket, black jeans, and a grey Henley.
"You know," Castiel started, and a smile grew at his face at the recollection of the memory, "-remember when I told you that sometimes it feels good when people
Sam had read the message, and was yet to reply. A few seconds later, another reply came through.
"Sure," Dean grinned. His bright green eyes, paired with that charming smile had Castiel going weak in the knees.
"Christ," Benny barked out a laugh, "—you gotta' be head over heels for someone to do that."
"No," Dean breathed out. He met Alastair's eyes, "-I'm gonna' kill you."
"Right." Castiel rolled his eyes, and the two of them walked into their class. But the moment Castiel crossed over the threshold, he paused. Eyes wide, mouth hung open, and the colour draining from his face, Castiel stood silent, simply trying to comprehend the sight in front of him.
Castiel turned away from Dean with the same rigidity he had been staring at Dean with.
"Cas, I'm home."
"I-I'm alone. My parents are out, they won't be back until tomorrow evening."
"Yeah, Novak's a bore."
"No way," He gasped, "-your bare fists?"
"For real? Novak? Stuck-up, up-tight nerd Novak?"
"Sure." Castiel smiled, and watched as she walked out the door. It clicked shut, only to click open again, and in came Dean, his eyes expectant and full of worry.
"You gonna' cry?" Dean asked, before bursting into laughter, shaking his head as he doubled over, "-man, you're gayer than I thought."
"That your sweet spot, baby? Bet no one's fucked it for you before. Bet that asshat of your boyfriend ain't ever made you feel so good."
"Fuck, I'm close—" Castiel breathed out, feeling his gut tighten with the familiar pressure of an orgasm. His thighs tensed up, and he felt his chest heave with every breath. Dean hummed, and dragged his lips down Castiel's neck, pressing deep, colorful marks onto his unblemished skin.
"You—
"I erm, I wanted to talk to you."
Benny sucked in a breath, before letting his fork drop down next to his tray, "-nothing much. I just— about Friday, I—"
The door to the classroom swung open, and the rest of the class scampered back to their seats as their History teacher, Mr. Frank, walked into the classroom with his cold, rigid glare sweeping across the students. Alastair's hand on Castiel's jaw fell away, and Castiel brought his own hand up to soothe some of the pain as he watched Alastair click his tongue and leap off Castiel's desk.
"Wanna' grab a smoke? I'm dying to," Benny sighed, and scrolled through his own phone.
And yet, strange as it may have been, the only thing Dean could comprehend as he walked away from Castiel, was the thought of seeing Castiel smile for the last time. Dean couldn't think of a world where he could live without seeing Castiel smile, at least once, with his entire heart— teeth glistening, lips parted, eyes crinkled, cheeks tinted pink— Dean would rather drink a bottle of poison than have Castiel cry
People who cared for him.
Castiel ran his fingers through Dean's hair, and sat up on the bed to simply gaze down at Dean. Dean lay silent in Castiel's lap, so tranquil and soft with his eyes shut. Castiel couldn't help but press a kiss to his forehead. Dean fluttered his eyes open, and gazed up at Cas.
, Cas."
Even as Dean shut his eyes, all he could picture was the sight of Alastair towering over Cas, with a predatory hunger in his eyes. Dean couldn't let that happen. Dean would never let it happen.
"Can't you get them suspended?"
"C'mon, it's been a while already, let me drop you home," Dean said, and turned to Castiel, who watched him for a moment, still drinking in the sight of Dean at his truest, but then Dean was grabbing him by the waist, and picking him off the concrete railing. Castiel yelped at the sudden movement, and threw his hands around Dean's neck; eyes squeezed shut because
Dean sighed, and yet, Castiel could see his eyes soften. "I hate to admit it, but you're right."
"We need you to suspend Alastair Knight, Gordon Walker, and Nick Morningstar." Castiel stated, trying to sound unwavering and confident, even though he was anything but.
"Tutor me."
There was silence once again, before Mick spoke.
"Jesus, fuck, you're gonna' make me come before I even start—" Dean muttered, and with the thumb sucked inside Castiel's hole, started pulling around and opening him up, almost wondering how tight and pink and hot he'd be inside.
, how he'd craved this.
"Then as you can see, I'm already on my phone. Take me just a second to post both now, the video
"Tight little teen cunt. Man, I got lucky," he laughed under his breath, and his fingers pounded into Castiel's dry pucker, the only thing giving a fraction of smoothness being the sweat between Castiel's ass. Castiel bit his lip, arching off the wall behind him into the man's touch, as the pervert panted into his shoulder and fingered his greedy, quivering hole. Oh god, oh— Castiel's gut tightened, and he felt his orgasm creep to his cock. No, no, no, he couldn't walk with a come stain on his jeans, but the pervert in front of him made no effort to take responsibility.
"You won't get mad at me?" Castiel asked, tears bulging his eyes and a quiver to his tiny voice.
"Cas?"
With that, both Meg and Castiel slipped out of Mr. Singer's cabin, a bright grin on their faces.
Castiel stared at her for a few seconds, before leaning in to wrap an arm around her shoulder. He knew news about Dean and he had already spread to a few people, but he never realised Meg had been at Benny's party. And why would he? They weren't friends. But with Meg sitting here next to him, wiping away her tears, opening up to Castiel for the first time in a whole year, he felt nothing but awe.
And made him calmer.
, Castiel punched him right in the gut, and Dean fell back on the floor, hugging himself in pain as he doubled over.
Castiel smiled.
If there was anything Dean had learnt over the years, it was the art of milking Castiel's prostate with every thrust.
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes— for your cock— please, stop teasing— just fuck me already, please—" Castiel gasped out, and Dean stood up to his feet, singlehandedly pulling his dick out of his cargo pants.
Dean pushed his long, thick finger inside, and coated his spit around Castiel's walls, curling his finger, pressing against his prostate, and fucking it into his needy little hole frantically, as Castiel arched his back and let out another loud, panting moan. He whined, squeezing his thighs together to somehow resist Dean, but Dean simply spread them apart, and added another finger to Castiel's slippery, greedy pink pucker.
Dean snorted. "Might as well give it a shot."
Castiel laughed, before throwing his boxers at Dean, (which Dean dodged) muttering a soft
"You think you're being smart? Fuckin' fag, you think you're being smart?" Dean hissed, and pressed his palm into Castiel's chest, leaning into Castiel's space. His face followed Castiel's, and their eyes fixed onto each other, Dean's seething with anger, and Castiel's filled with confusion.
Next update date 24 Feb. Stay tuned!
"Novak ain't my friend," Dean sighed, and sent Castiel a sharp glare.
"A bit," He whispered, to which Castiel sat up, and leapt of the bed, walking over to his dressing drawer to rummage through it, searching for something, before returning with a bandage and some ointment. Dean didn't sit up, and Castiel never asked him to. The silence between them felt almost palpable, and Dean found himself once again in awe of Castiel, who despite being ridiculed and hurt by Dean not once, not twice but countless times, managed to be the sweetest person Dean knew.
"I saw your face, it ain't good anymore," Dean grumbled, and waited for Castiel to step in. Castiel's smile dropped, and for a moment Dean regretted saying that, but he couldn't turn back time, and the silence between them had now turned sour.
, he thought,
Almost instantly, Castiel noticed, Sam was online again, and the ellipses on the screen began to bounce as he typed.
"You know," Dean gulped, "—that time you put a bandaid on my bruise?"
"Dean— oh god—" Castiel gasped, only for Dean to press his lips against Castiel's face, not kissing, simple resting.
Dean had said things had been rough between them for a while, but now though, Castiel could see, the two of them had reached the point of breaking.
"I honestly don't care. If you have any boundaries, just let me know."
"I can't believe it's you." Dean whispered, and Castiel slipped a hand across his jaw.
"You look gorgeous, Cas." Dean breathed out, Castiel fluttered his eyes up to stare at Dean, his breath held in his chest as he met Dean's eyes.
"Yeah, that was cool of her to do."
"Pity," Castiel quirked a lip, and Dean watched as he bounced his shoulder with a smirk, "-I'm very sexy."
"Oh, oh fuck," Castiel moaned out, now for the theatrics of it all, since he knew Michael was watching. A strange kind of thrill ran up his body as he bounced his perky ass back on Dean's cock. "Oh Dean, you're—" But the fake moan died down on his tongue the moment Dean thrust against his prostate. Castiel bit down on his hand to suppress the moan, and tears welled at his eyes. "
Castiel cracked a cynical smile. "So, if we per say, decided to contact the police authorities of Lawrence, and filed a case against not only Alastair Knight, but also you, and this school, you would allow it?"
"Yes," Castiel breathed out, and felt the tension in  Dean's body seep away.
Which is why, in hindsight, the idea didn't seem as bad as it really was.
What he was about to do, he only hoped Castiel would forgive him for it.
best Zeppelin album of all time," Dean remarked, and Castiel let out a unsatisfied hum.
"I don't know," Cas laughed, in that shy, pure way he did sometimes when he was flustered, "—I just want him to be someone I can be proud of."
"I can't waste a second, Benny, every moment you wait, Alastair's going to be hurting my Cas—"
"I shouldn't have left," Dean whispered, squeezing Castiel's hands within his own, holding on as if Castiel would disappear the next moment if he wasn't too careful, "-I should have stayed, I'm so sorry," Dean stuttered out, and wiped his face on the back of his palm, before clenching Castiel's hand again.
"Of course, Dr. Sunders. Thank you so much."
"Think it'll work?" Benny asked.
Castiel Novak was a slut. Contrary to the goody-two shoes, studious, dedicated, holier-than-thou mask he donned every morning at school, Castiel Novak was a whore, and he'd spread his legs open for anyone. Which is why Dean loved shaming him. He knew Castiel got off on the humiliation. He just wanted to toy with the
Castiel rubbed a palm across his face, and sniffled. "On foot."
"Can you just shut up?" Castiel snapped, and watched Dean's demeanor change. He snatched his bottle out of Dean's hand, and turned away, trying to hide the tears welling at the rim of his eyes as he filtered through the crowd, lips quivering and fingers trembling. He felt Dean follow after him, and shout out calls of, "
Dean nodded, and pulled into the driveway to his home. "Sounds great, you wanna' get the forum thing started? I could ask Sammy, or we could just, Google it."
, he mouthed, and turned back to look at the screen. He adjusted his headset and console, and sucked in a deep breath.
"Fifty new confessions. All with usernames. People are speaking up. We can make this work, we can actually get Alastair suspended."
"Family emergency?"
and that's when Dean felt the need to step in. "Hey, hey, cut it out. Cas isn't like us, guys. He doesn't like this stuff."
"I never should have left him, Bobby," Dean whispered, unable to hold back a sob that wracked his body, "—if I would've just stayed there a few minutes—"
"Ivy League? You've got a huge chance of getting in, baby. I'm not lying. Your grades, your student record, everything's amazing." Dean cut in, and Castiel hummed to himself. He grabbed the t-shirt Dean had given him, and changed into it, before stripping down to his briefs.
Heat crawled under Castiel's skin, and he shoved his tongue into his cheek to hold back a wide smile. He nodded slowly, and let his face hang down, only for Dean to tilt his chin up and press a kiss to his lips.
Dean gently hooked his hand under one of Castiel's thigh, and guided it around Dean's waist. "It's your first time, isn't it?" He asked, his voice quiet and keen.
Tension coursed through every single nerve in Castiel's body, and all he could do was imagine a scenario where he would have to beg Alastair to stop. Either Alastair would beat him to a pulp with the nearest sledgehammer, or he would—
"Sam— do you think Sam could help me? I know he's not in our school, but he could help us formulate some kind of systematic campaign, right? He's smart, and he's organised, maybe he can help? What do you feel?" Castiel asked, as he sat up and hovered over Dean, pressing a hand into Dean's chest softly.
Dean drifted his eyes up to meet Bobby's wide, aghast eyes. His chapped lips were parted, and his shoulders had tensed. The colour in his face seemed to drain away with every passing second as he gaped at Dean, most likely hoping Dean would say something to numb the shock, but Dean stayed silent. There was nothing he could say.
"You better," Benny smiled vaguely, and Dean felt himself being pulled back down to the ground, now nearing the downfall of the high of his adrenaline.
A sharp knock on the plywood under his eyes had Castiel jerking to the present, and he looked up, only to meet Dean's deep, green eyes peering at him intently.
"Novak," Dean growled, "-help me. I don't want to keep threatening you."
The objective was easy. Get Dean to fuck him. Sure, Castiel could blatantly just ask Dean to fuck him, but knowing Dean, the boy would always ask if there was something in it for him. And the perfect opportunity presented itself as a group project in Chemistry where Castiel was paired up with Dean.
Seated on the front seat of the Impala, with only the sound of his ragged breaths to keep his company, Dean sighed into his hands, and glanced up to look at the Novak residence outside his window. A few feet away, with only one window illuminated, the rest of the house faded away into the gloom of a calm, dark, cold winter night. Dean stared at it for a moment, before glancing at himself in the rear-view mirror to study himself. A smear of blood stained his chin, and he rubbed it at his sleeve. He ran a hand through his hair, and with conviction in his movements, stepped out of the car, letting the keys jangle in his palm as he strutted up the short flight of stairs in front of the rosewood door. Once he was at the threshold, he rung the buzzer.
"Wow, how sweet of you."
"Why did you wait so long?" Castiel asked, cutting Dean off, and Dean stared at him, mouth hung open— utterly speechless.
"The way you're both obsessed with each other, god, it's scary, honestly."
"Mhm. Now come on," Dean reached up to wipe the back of his palm over Castiel's face, much to Castiel's fond protest, "—give me a smile, baby, come on."
"Cas didn't tell me."
Their gazes held, and Castiel felt each word echo inside the depth of his chest, etching itself into his mind and heart. And the truth to Dean's words, it scared Castiel. Knowing Dean
Dean felt his mood sour at the mention of
"So, will you come?"
Castiel nodded, and watched as Dean grabbed his cellphone from the pocket of his discarded jeans, and slipped out of the door. For the first time, Castiel felt like a stranger in his own bedroom, and he glazed his eyes across the blank, white room, and somehow, it stared back at him with all its emotionless aura. In the distance, he could catch traces of Dean's conversation.
"Please— please fuck my cunt—"
Dean mouthed back
"There's my good boy." Dean whispered, and with a final kiss to Castiel's lips, he was leaning back. Castiel shut his eyes.
, ain't that what you said about me, Alastair? What happened now? Aren't you going to fight back? I mean," Dean chuckled, "-I
"Yeah, s'all."
A beat passed between them, before Castiel was fuming, and he smacked the book right across Dean's face with a hopeless groan.
"How's Cas?" Dean asked, as he stalked over to his car, snatching the keys out of Benny's hands.
"You should be on Broadway, drama queen," Castiel chuckled, and Dean sighed, slouching back against the concrete wall, watching as Castiel laughed at him unabashedly.
It was a simple Friday evening, and Castiel had no plans, no friends, no parties to attend. He lounged back in his bed, scrolling through his OnlyPics, replying and liking the comments on the video he'd posted the week before. Of course, looking at the video reminded Castiel of only his deal with Dean, and he tried to avoid thinking of it, but the love pouring in from the people on the app made him smile, and believe that in some way, he was important to someone.
"Man, Dean told me you were cute, never told me you were kinda funny too." Benny chuckled, and slung an arm around Castiel, much to Castiel's dismay. Benny and he were friends, sure, but only fast-friends. Acquaintances, if he was being precise. But Castiel knew Dean and Benny were good friends, he'd asked Dean once, and Dean had said they were
"Me too," Castiel said between a kiss, "-but you know we can't do anything," Their eyes met when they pulled away to breathe, "-until Michael agrees to the divorce, which I know he won't, we have to meet this way. His men are always around, the only time I can get rid of them is today when he calls them in for their reports."
Castiel felt anticipation thrum under his skin as he leaned in, shutting his eyes and parting his lips, waiting for Dean to press his own against them. What he didn't expect however, was the rough, feral way Dean crashed their lips together, and pressed his hands into Castiel's chest. Castiel yelped into their kiss, the sound of which was muted as it echoed in Dean mouth. Dean, on the other hand, nudged Castiel back onto the bed until he was lying down. He climbed over Castiel, leaning down to pepper gentle, feather-light kisses across Castiel's neck that had Castiel aching for more. The touch of Dean's lips to his skin had electricity flittering through his veins, and he tugged Dean down by the back of his head into another slow kiss. Castiel opened his mouth into the kiss, and groaned when he felt Dean's tongue roll inside against his own. He grabbed at Dean's t-shirt, crumpling it under his fingers as he pressed Dean closer and closer to himself.
Dean paused for a moment, simply chewing on his food, and Castiel shoved a forkful of pancake into his own mouth. It was delicious, honestly, and so much better than the boxed ones he bought.
"You're mine, Cas. And I'll mark you up, just to show the world you are. Remember back when we got our shit sorted, when we got together— I made you a promise. I told you I was here to stay, that I was going to be with you, like it or not. So don't you dare assume, even for a second, that I'd ever let my promise down."
The time passed by pleasantly, after all, Dean was a very interesting person. They talked about school, exams, books, music, and even the most absurd things they could never talk about before. Dean paid, despite Castiel's protest, and they walked out to the car again. It was around five in the evening when they slipped into the Impala, and the sun had begun to dim from bright yellow into a sombre orange, and the first few traces of twilight lingered at the horizon.
"Hey man," Benny grinned, "-I'm having a party tonight at my farmhouse, you have to come, dude."
"Hey, Novak," Dean called, and Castiel could practically see the wicked grin that must be curled on his lips, "-your panties blew up on OnlyPics. I mean, fifty thousand hearts? Can I expect to see you on PornHub now?"
Dean's face was soft. A bit uncertain, but concerned mostly, as he rubbed his fingers into Castiel's hair, his sharp, green gaze fixed onto Cas. "Cas, calm down. I'm not leaving, alright. And I'm sorry for making you feel like you're some helpless—"
"—Oh, oh, Back In Black is
For a moment, silence lingered between them, and the air between them had changed. Dean sighed, and turned around to meet Castiel's eyes.
"We don't want to fight. Just talk."
"Hey, uh, sorry I was in the shower, I just read your message."
Teary eyes met Dean's, and he hitched a breath. Castiel turned around to stare at him for a moment, silent, before his lips trembled, and Dean could tell he was trying
They lost count of how long they kissed, how long they fucked, all Castiel knew was that his legs were aching, and his orgasm crept closer to the edge as Dean ferociously snapped his hips, eyes peering down into Castiel's with the intensity of a thousand suns.
"Keep moving," Castiel urged with a nod, and before he knew it, Dean was catching onto a soft, rhythmic pace of thrusting back and forth.
as Castiel and Dean ducked their heads down in shame and scurried out of the library.
Benny sighed, and hung his head down.
"You didn't have to do that," Dean breathed out, still recovering from that soul-sucking blow job. His legs were as good as jelly, and he had to grab a minute for himself to recompose his thoughts.
At school, Castiel had begun handing out fliers about their anti-bullying club, and so had Benny, Dean, and Meg. Although only three people had approached them so far, the three had only been there to inquire, and not take part. For a day or two after that, there was buzz about the anti-bullying club in Dean's class, but no action. Dean could see it was making Castiel dejected, that it was frustrating Castiel, but Cas was holding on, and Dean was proud of him for it.
Out of all the things Dean could have done, he
Castiel could only grin, but before Castiel could say anything further, Dean was hooking his arms under Castiel's thighs, and lifting him up off the ground. Castiel yelped, and tightened his arms around Dean's neck, before letting out a sigh.
Next chapter will be what you've been waiting for. Update on 22nd May.
With a deep breath, he rung the buzzer, and stepped back awaiting an answer. A few seconds later, Dean heard the door creak open, and standing at the front was Castiel, dressed in a casual navy-blue Henley shirt and a pair of black sweatpants. At the sight of Dean, he broke into a grin and let his eyes trail down Dean's body. Dean stood, silent for a moment, allowing Castiel to study him. With every passing second, Castiel's mouth parted wider, and Dean noted as his eyes grew wide.
Dean clicked his tongue, and let a grin pull at his face, "—thanks Bob."
Castiel gulped. The silence shattered.
"On paper. We need to bring it to life."
"How about you take me in your car? Spread me open nice and wide like the good girl you want me to be, and just take me, yeah? Fuck me nice and rough till I'm sore and limp. I bet your cock's so wet for me, so hard for me, would you like it if I touched it?" Castiel grinned, knowing damn well the effect he was having on Dean.
. For once, he realised, he felt what Dean was used to feeling— having no idea about what the other was thinking. Dean was sitting there, right next to him, so close to him, and but at the same time, Castiel had not a single clue as to what he may have been thinking about.
And then Castiel had realised it for a fleeting second— his family was stitching itself together. Maybe his mother had turned soft, maybe his father had begun to care for him— maybe Castiel could have a family, as loving as any other. And so he had texted Dean as soon as he could. Even if Naomi and Michael approved of Dean, it would mean the world to Castiel. He didn't need their approval for it, but getting it would mean they had tried to care for Castiel, and that in itself would have made Castiel happy. What he failed to see was that his mother would never approve of Dean. To her, it was a game. A fun litte ruse to watch Castiel cry, to watch Castiel lose people. She said he deserved better, but he knew it was an excuse for her regret.
Perhaps Castiel was expecting a snarl, or a sarcastic dismissal, but in its place, what he got in answer was a smiling kiss to his forehead, and Dean pressing his face into Castiel's neck. Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean's back, waiting for the breach of it to come.
"To Castiel. Please. Alone."
Dean flushed with heat, and ducked his head to avert his gaze.
At last, when Dean thought it was enough prep, which it so, so certainly wasn't, Dean spat some more on Castiel's ass and on his cock, and pushed into him with one, harsh thrust. Castiel screamed out Dean's name, and Dean clasped a hand over his mouth to suppress his moans. In the mirror, Dean watched as Castiel's face glowed red, and his eyes rolled to the back of his head as Dean fucked into him.
"Never, sweetheart. I would never hurt you."
"I realised then, that if I wanted to fit in, I was going to have to do something herculean to make a place for myself, even if it meant joining the wrong company." She continued, and it was then that he realised just
"How about I make you some breakfast? Pancakes, waffles, or my special, marshmallow mac'n'cheese?" Dean snorted, as he stretched his arms above his head, and Castiel groaned.
It was everything Castiel had associated with Dean.
"Dean." Castiel sighed, and watched as Dean jumped out of bed, eyes wide in disbelief and somewhat surprise.
"Novak, I'm sorry," Gordon's voice was breaking, "—I'm sorry, I really am. You don't have to, don't have to forgive me, ever, ever. But I'm gonna' leave. Nick and I, we're moving. We won't be coming back to Lawrence any time soon, and we'll do our best in life, alright? Please, please just— I'm sorry— I don't know what to say, but I want you to know that you helped us. And we won't ever, ever forget this, Castiel, we won't ever forget you for showing us the right way."
"—so," Castiel asked into the headset, his voice hoarse from all the moaning, as if he hadn't just been fucked to an inch of his life on a live voice call, "-where were we?"
"I need you to help me with the test."
"I already wrote the notes for you, what more do you need me to do?" Castiel asked, as he watched Dean intently.
Alastair laughed, and Castiel watched as he stalked forward toward Castiel, crowding him up against the railing. Castiel considered jumping off the railing, but it was a good few feet above the ground, and he'd end up with a broken bone. Before he had time to think, though, Alastair was leaning into his space, his breath reeking of alcohol,
place," Castiel snapped, "—I would love to stay and listen to you and your husband crush each other's throats, but I have more important things to do, like apologize to the one person who loves me more than anything in the world."
"I know… But forget about that. What colleges are you applying to?" Castiel asked, and Dean quirked his lips. He pulled his phone out, and began surfing through his playlist, before putting on a Black Sabbath song.
"Dean, that's for me to decide, sweetheart." Castiel whispered, stepping out from behind Dean. Dean grabbed his arm, his eyes softening with concern and helplessness, but Castiel simply smiled at him. "I'll be fine, trust me. And I'll call for you if I need anything."
Dean pulled away from their hug, dropping down in a crouch again to match his gaze to Castiel's. Dean stared at Castiel for a moment, simply watching, thinking, considering something, before he swallowed thickly, and his eyes dropped down to Castiel's lips. Castiel felt himself flush under Dean's gaze, absently licking his lips, but he couldn't miss the way Dean's eyes deepened at the sight of it. "Cas," Dean croaked out, low and hoarse, "—I really want to kiss you right now."
. His face was bright, brighter than the sun, and his grin was almost blinding. Dean had never felt as insignificant before as he felt in that one moment, gazing upon what he considered to be one of the most sublime things in existence. Something about Castiel was so utterly
"Dean is here?"
"—maybe I deserved it. After I hurt you, maybe I deserved it."
"Why's Novak absent?"
The sound of his name pulled him out of his thoughts, and he snapped his eyes to the side to meet Castiel, who gazed at him with his head propped up on his arm. The flannel shirt on his shoulders had slipped down to his arm, revealing his delicious, smooth collarbones, and Dean let his eyes roam across them.
"But they got away? Is that what's bothering you?" Bobby asked, "-in the real world, that's just how it is. But the important thing is that you risked yourself for your friend. Or erm, boy... friend—"
Behind Alastair, Nick and Gordon burst into incoherent, amused noises, and Dean grit his teeth, "-Cas is my friend. And what's it to you? Why are you so worked up about him? Could it be that maybe you're a fag too?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Once Michael was out of earshot, both Dean and Castiel laughed out loud, and reached for their bags.
Dean snapped his eyes up to meet Castiel's, whose face was flushed with heat, and gaze nothing short of lewd, just begging to be fucked to an inch of his life.
And that's when Castiel realised.
"I should have waited. If I just waited for a few more minutes, Alastair would have never—"
a way, it had bile rising up in Dean's throat and tears pooling at his eyes. He thought he was strong, he even considered himself brave— but now, listening to Castiel talk about how Alastair had raped him with an
Anna's eyes softened, and she blinked them around as if trying to catch some semblance of what she'd heard. "God, I couldn't think he'd stoop that low."
And yet, he decided not to make a mountain of a molehill, and assumed his place at the back of the class silently, waiting for their homeroom teacher to come in. He glanced down at his phone in his hand, where Cas had sent him a text, a
"Well," Castiel snorted, "-you're the only who'd mind."
"You're so big, boss," Castiel whined, and sucked the tip of Dean's cock, "—are you going to fuck my face? Use me like the whore I am?"
Dean laughed, and crossed his way into the corridors of Benny's farmhouse for some privacy. He had to call Castiel, he had to make amends, he had to apologize and confess— he only hoped Castiel would take him back. Somewhere in the midst of an empty, darkened corridor, where the music was muted and faint, and silence prevailed over the noise, Dean fished his cellphone out of his pocket, and took a deep, composing breath—
"—he should be my rock, my support. You know those kind of people, where no matter what you do, they're always going to have your back?" Castiel sighed, and a smile spread across his face as played with a pencil sitting on the table. Dean watched him, simply listening; observing.
"I hurt him."
"Now that we've let Dean in on the
"I'm gonna' ask you a question, and you're gonna' answer, okay?"
"If we can go long enough tonight, I'd love to come on your face, Cas, paint your pretty, boy-toy face white with my come. And then I'd lick it right off, kiss every single inch of your face—"
A shiver ran down Castiel's spine as his eyes widened, and he turned on his heels, a deer-caught-in-a-headlight expression on his face as he blushed a deep, dark red right from the tips of his ears down to his neck.
"You're so fucking sappy—"
"Well, lucky for you, it's one of the few Zep songs I do know how to play." Dean laughed, and fiddled with the tuning of the guitar for a few seconds, before adjusting his finger on the neck of the guitar, and starting out with the intro to Black Dog. Castiel listened with apt attention, as Dean strummed his fingers, and played each note with perfection, and towards the end, Castiel couldn't even hold himself back from humming along to the song.
said, and shot up in his seat. His wide, worried, aghast eyes trailed across Castiel's face, and Castiel let out a breath he hadn't known he was holding. Already, the sight of Dean had warmth curling in the back of Castiel's mind. But Dean's weren't the only concerned eyes staring up at him. There was Benny, who sat behind him, staring at him with worry and relief. Meg, who smiled at him and squeezed his hand, and Anna, who reached out to comfort him.
The air was seething with anger and fury, and Naomi banged a fork down on the table, her eyes wide and enraged. "Everything I have done, I have done for my child. And you are nobody to question me, I'm his mother—"
Monday came in the blink of an eye. Castiel and Dean were their usual dorky self. And Michael, who had been tailing Castiel around for the past few days, was still tailing around but with a big, wide sulk. He tried his damn best to win Castiel over again. If only Castiel knew what he had planned.
Something about how quiet Castiel was only irked Dean, and he felt another tear roll down his face. But then, Castiel's hand reached up to touch his face, and nudged his head up. Staring up at Castiel, his face marked with bruises, Dean only felt the regret in his gut tighten as he rubbed a hand across his face before gazing back up at Cas.
"Let's go home, yeah?" Castiel asked, and reached out to run his thumb across Dean's jaw.
thing you have going on, but, Cas. She's Alastair's girlfriend. She's a bully, okay—"
"You won't like the answer." Castiel croaked out, trembling fingers reaching up to clutch onto Dean's shoulder.
Even as he took a drag of the cigarette, and let the smoke slip past his lips, something lingered in his expression that hurt Castiel to see. Regret. Guilt. Exhaustion. It was the face of a man who had seen too much in life, most of which he never wished to. A person who had been beaten and bruised and yet, wanted to keep living. Dean didn't have the face of a boy, as boyish as it may be. Mannerisms and personality wise, he had grown into a man, and it reflected in his eyes.
"I— could you get Mr. Singer, please? I'd like it if he escorted me back." Castiel whispered, and let out a laboured breath. Alex nodded, and disappeared into the room outside, leaving Castiel alone. Castiel lay his head back down on the pillow, and waited for someone to come get him. Mr. Singer was someone he could trust, and if not Dean, being with Mr. Singer would bring Castiel some peace. He let his eyes slip shut, and recalled the events of the morning.
Their eyes met, and Castiel watched as Dean waited for Castiel to speak, his face soft and expectant.
He paused outside the library to catch his breath, and mumbled to himself, "-I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I'm gonna' be a fucking man, go in there, and tell Castiel I like him, and that I wanna' be with him. I'm going to tell him I love him, and that I've never loved anyone else so much before," Dean panted, and sucked in a deep, refreshing breath, "-Cas, I love you, please go out with me. No, no, Cas I'm in love with you, I want to be with you. Too proposal-y. Oh, oh, Cas, I think I'm in love with you, please be my boyfriend. My boyfriend. Oh my god—"
"I should head on home now," She mumbled, and cast a glance at her wristwatch, "—my father and I are going golfing, he has a business deal to crack. I'll see you guys at school, Monday okay?"
"Until I say so, bitch."
, that he left the moment Castiel asked him to? How would he ever get over the fact that had he stayed for five more minutes, he would have been able to see Castiel smile, that he wouldn't have to be sitting in Castiel's room, watching him cry and shiver.
"What'd she say?" Dean asked, as he pressed a kiss to Castiel's head, and ran a hand through his hair.
Naomi seemed stunned, if not disappointed. "You must be rivals then, huh. Since Castiel is and always has been the brightest boy at school. I remember, even to this date, the moment you showed me your award for the Best Merit Student of Lawrence High. I was so proud of you back then. I wish you worked half as hard now as you did back then."
"Well, maybe if I stopped thinking of you, I'd have time to miss you."
He could never be sick of Dean.
engrossed in himself, because he absently knocked over a spoon, and bent down to pick it up.
Dean's eyes widened, and he plucked the bottle out of Castiel's hand, despite Castiel's protest, and narrowed his eyes to read the label, before turning back to Castiel with a cold, frigid look in his eyes.
"Cas, you— you're the strongest person I've seen, alright? And the bravest, the kindest, the most beautiful person I've ever seen. And I'm not leaving you, ever. Heck, I'd give up every dream I have to be with you, Cas, because if I have you, I don't need anything else. You're my biggest win. And I love you more than anything. But whatever fight we've got to face, we're facing it together, capische?"
No, he reprimanded himself, Dean Winchester is a disgusting human being, who doesn't deserve an ounce of Castiel's attention. And yet, with Dean, who sat lingering at the edge of the bed, waiting and watching so intently, Castiel couldn't find it in himself to argue against him.
"Hits home, doesn't it." Castiel's words were humourless and wet.
Michael let out a groan and set his glass down on the table in front of them, before clapping his hands together and rubbing them with a grin.
The boy whimpered, and rocked his hips against the chair, which only drew Dean's eyes to his tiny cock bulging against the panties, and
"That's your issue with this?"
"Sammy would disagree."
It was a boy, barely eighteen, clad in a soft, oversized graphic t-shirt, and nothing else. At least it seemed to be nothing, until the boy, whose messy, raven-black hair made him look like he'd been fucked to an inch of his life, reached up on his toes to fetch something from a high shelf, and his shirt rucked up. Dean caught a glimpse of pink, but it was enough to have him hitching a breath.
, to stick a finger up the tight, sticky, heat of his hole, and Dean only wondered if it felt so good, how good it must be to look at. Desperate hands clawed the panties off of the boy's slender, smooth legs, and Dean hauled him up in his arms once again, this time pressing his legs up in the air, exposing his cute, tiny pink hole to the air, and Dean almost forgot how to breathe.
, and Dean followed Castiel inside, up the flight of stairs and into his dry, blank, lifeless white room. The room was drenched in a soft, warm yellow glow, not too bright, not too dark, and Dean toed his boots off as he followed Castiel to the bed. Castiel fell back on the bed, hands stretched above his body, an action that reminded Dean of a cat, and it made him smile, but also wonder if Castiel was really alright. If anything, the past few hours had been the hardest for Castiel, moreso than anyone.
, so fucking
He gulped, and leaned back in his seat, rubbing a hand across his face, eyes drooping and lips turned down in a frown. He felt his fingers tremble as he reached down to poke at his food, suddenly having lost his appetite.
"Dean," Benny was speaking, concern and worry in his voice, and he'd even held him by the shoulder for support, but Dean couldn't hear him. All he could hear was vague, distant mumbling of
A hand drifted down to Castiel's ass, dipping between the crack and dragging down the taint. Castiel gasped into their kiss, before closing his lips around Dean's mouth, slick with spit.
"Yeah. It is. And I'm tired of being asked why I don't want more. As mediocre as my dreams may be, they're mine. And no one can change my mind."
A sharp squeeze of his hands had him faltering, and he watched as Castiel firmly shook his head, "-please, please don't keep saying it's your fault. It's not. It's not you, Dean, you saved me, you saved me again, after everything I did to hurt you. I punched you, I shouted at you, and I told you to leave— and you still came back."
Now that Naomi had nothing to say to Dean, she turned to Castiel. "This is who you choose? Out of the million men who could love you, cherish you, and be respectful and classy at the same time, you choose a mutt. An pathetic rebel with no manners, no respect for his elders, no morals—"
Naomi stood, dumbstruck, before she widened her eyes, and followed after Castiel. "And what makes you think you're allowed to go? I want you in your room in three, don't you take a step forward, Castiel."
"I mean, I'm going to be at the library for a little while more," Castiel murmured, and slid his chair back, pushing himself to his feet as if to get away from Dean, "-You should go on home, I don't want to keep you waiting."
Dean's eyes gazed into Castiel's for a moment, before flickering down to his lips, and the next moment Castiel was pulling Dean down into a wild, frenzy kiss which had Dean yelping, before they both parted and broke out into a laugh. Dean let his head rest in Castiel's lap, and Castiel leaned back on the bed, hands tangled through Dean's hair.
"I want you to take your pants off, throw them away somewhere, and sit in your bare underwear, right in front of me," His voice turned sour then, much to Castiel's surprise, "-You like showing your ass to people, huh, don't you? Go on, show me. Fucking slut."
"Ah," Dean clicked his tongue, all male bravado on display, "-what was that?" A sharp tug at Castiel's arm had him arching off the wall and crashing against Dean's chest, causing both boys to moan softly. Castiel's eyes fluttered open, and he tried to suppress the blush rising on his face, but failed.
Dean looked lost for a second, before his face lit up. "You know what," He started, his eyes bright and intrigued, "—I asked Bobby the same thing the other day."
By Monday, things at Lawrence High had changed. No, the senior year batch at Lawrence High was on a way to revolution. Thanks to Anna, the list of supporters for Castiel's anti-bullying campaign had grown from five to almost thirty-five. And paired with the inflow of submissions on the Lawrence High anti-bullying blog, Castiel's campaign was soaring. In the corridors, people would smile at Castiel, thank him for starting the campaign, and they would chat with him for a while— even people he didn't know. And then there was Dean, who stood by Castiel as unwavering and solid as a boulder.
Ever since, the picture had become Castiel's personal caller ID on Dean's phone.
"Principal Berry," Castiel swallowed thickly, and fiddled with the hem of his school shirt, quickly stopping that once he realised Mrs. Berry had noticed it. He didn't want her to think he was nervous. This was his cause. He needed to speak up. "We have a request."
"Smoking."
he felt so close to the edge— there but not quite there, as Dean worked them over. Castiel leaned back gently, only to crush his lips against Dean's, and all at once, it was another flurry or lips, teeth, and tongues. The pungent smell of sex and semen lingered in the room, all around them, but neither of them seemed to care.
Castiel paused in his tracks, and turned around to face Dean, a strange, deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression on his face as he tilted his head to the side and sent Dean his signature squint, "-what do you mean?"
"On your knees, Cas."
"Me too," Dean sighed, and snuck a hand over Castiel's thigh. Castiel leaned into his shoulder to press a kiss to his face, to which Dean simply smiled. They pulled out of their parking spot, and onto the main road again. Somehow, Castiel noted, going back always seemed quicker than coming somewhere. Perhaps it was because the roads had become familiar to Castiel, but be what it may, they reached home too soon, sooner than Castiel pleased, and he sighed when Dean paused in front of his house.
"—And they shoved the bottle inside," Castiel hiccuped, "—over and over, and over again. I couldn't stop them, I'm sorry—"
"God, what— when did you take that?"
would help— but a hand clamped over his mouth, filthy and large, and Castiel felt tears sting his eyes.
"Yeah?"
(See the end of the chapter for
It started with a bet, as all bad ideas do.
Anna grinned at that, and Dean watched as she visibly relaxed.
Mr. Singer hummed, and stepped aside to let them in. Castiel walked in, followed by his group of friends behind him, until the door shut, and Bobby walked over to the back of his desk, and grabbed his seat. He urged the four of them to sit down, and erm, there were only two chairs, so Dean, chivalrous as he was, offered up his seat for Castiel, and Benny for Meg.
Dean Winchester, who had just been promoted to the Head of Sales and Marketing at Sandover Inc. had been dragged down to a club to celebrate his promotion by the rest of his close colleagues. Benny, from Accounts, Victor from HR, Ketch from Management, Mick from HR, and a few other mutual colleagues. Castiel Novak, Dean's personal secretary was also a part of the group at the club.
"Castiel, I—" Dr. Sunders sucked in a breath, "-I want you to know that you're very brave, okay? And the fact that you've opened up to me about something so personal and harrowing, it just proves that you're far from weak. Please don't let this hinder you in life. Sexual assault is something no one should have to go through, and yet, the fact that you're moving on, I'm extremely proud of you. Now see, as hospital policy, I'm not allowed to give out my cell phone number, but you're just a teenager, barely finished high school, and I can't leave you like this. This," Dr. Sunders fished out something from her pocket, and handed it to Castiel. It was a thin, white piece of paper, "-is my business card. The second number on it is my personal number. If you ever need a therapist, or maybe just an ear to listen, please feel free to reach out to me."
English passed by in a flurry, and so did Calculus, Biology and Geography. Before Dean knew it, it was recess, meaning he ended up at the cafeteria with Benny, who trailed after him quietly. It was strange for Benny to be quiet, especially at recess, but Dean didn't ask him much about it, until they were seated at a table at the far corner of the cafeteria.
"Oh, o-oh god—" He breathed out, faltering back a few steps, "-Dean, I'm so— Dean, I'm so sorry—"
"And I'm already in love with someone else." Dean snorted, and grabbed Castiel by the jaw to press a kiss to his lips. It was silly and Castiel ended up laughing, much to Dean's relief.
Next Update: 7 June.
, to call up his driver. His eyes lingered on the name
Hope flickered inside Castiel.
, but all he could do was sit and stare at his own pathetic reflection on the polished wooden table. It must have been a few seconds after, when Castiel sighed and without turning to Dean, addressed him.
"Doing what?"
Even then, he felt somebody staring at him. Their gaze was nagging and intense, and already Castiel knew who it belonged to. But he couldn't find it in himself to turn back and face them just yet.
"Wanna' head over to mine?"
"Are you going to hit me, big boy?" Alastair laughed, and his sidekicks joined in.
"Berry's in the office till three. Think we can come up with something to say to her till then?"
"I tried to be strong." Castiel whispered, and clutched his hands around Dean's shirt. "I really did."
It was a Saturday morning, and Meg was over at Castiel's house. They found out a few minutes ago that both of them shared a love for the band Halestorm— Castiel for the badass music, and Meg for the badass female vocalist. They were blasting one of their songs in the kitchen, raiding through Castiel's fridge for some ice-cream as they talked about school, about movies, music, and some times, about Alastair. Meg told Castiel she might be pansexual. Castiel treated her to some more ice-cream as celebration.
"You want to know what I look for in a man?"
It started with a small quiver of Castiel's lips, and a litany of
With loud, collective
Ashamed at having been caught staring, Castiel gawked, and turned his tomato-red face down to his shoes. From the corner of his eye, Castiel watched as the man smirked, and puffed his chest out in an unabashed show of dominance.
The boy had a perfect face, chiseled and sculpted right down to perfection. A sharp jaw, attractive dark blonde hair, bright apple-green eyes and a smile that made the girls in his class leak through their panties. Dean smiled, and Castiel watched as he held up a phone, and playing on the screen was—
A beat passed between them, and Castiel pushed himself up to his feet. Before he could take a step forward though, Dean shot an arm out to grab his wrist, and Castiel stopped dead in his tracks. Dean snapped his eyes up to meet Castiel's, and urged him down.
Behind them, Dean snorted, and Castiel nodded. "Of course Mr. Singer. We know school policy doesn't allow you to participate in all of this. Which is why we appreciate your help so much."
"But I—"
Thirty-minutes later, Castiel stood shivering at the Winchester's door. The walk had been slow, but steady, and only the sheer amount of determination in Castiel's mind had helped him reach here. Walking up the driveway of the Winchester's house had been nothing short of a finishing a marathon. He thought of ringing the buzzer, but decided against it, since he knew the wreck that was John Winchester would be awake, and Castiel showing up uninvited would raise suspicion. Instead, he did the one thing he was sure would work. He pulled out his phone, tapped on Sam's contact, and held the phone to his ear. Sam picked up after a single ring.
Dean couldn't bring the words to his lips. They lingered at the back of his throat, and yet, never surfaced. He trailed his eyes across the window, out where a soft breeze swayed a thin tree branch, and with it, a pair of swallows sitting on it flew away into the horizon.
Dean, and Dean
"I'm bored. Can you untie me, please? I won't bother you, I'll just go back to doing what I was before you came." Castiel pleaded, and blinked his big, round princess eyes up at Dean with such innocence,
Then came the glasses, those goddamned glasses. Castiel bit down on his lip and let out a low, dark chuckle. Dean felt his breath hitch the moment Castiel began rolling his hips over Dean's cock, slow at first, simply testing. Dean couldn't help but slide his hands down the swell of Castiel's firm, bouncy ass. The glasses Castiel had been wearing, he pushed them down on his nose, before plucking them up, and setting them down on the tip of Dean's nose. He leaned in, his breath smelling of a mixture of alcohol and sugar, and smiled.
"I know," Castiel nodded, and squeezed Dean's palms in his own hands, "—let's just go, okay?"
"Sam doesn't go to my high-school. He's yet to join, but I know he will be next year," Dean said, and tried to scoop some of the gravy into his mouth.
Not his fault the man was the sexiest piece of ass Dean had seen.
"Hate Mondays."
, right? And everything you've worked for so hard will crumble right away."
A hand on his thigh drew his gaze up to Dean, who smiled, and nudged his shoulder.
Dean's eyes wandered around the room. He hadn't seen much of it the last time he was here, well, mostly because, erm, his eyes hadn't been able to leave Castiel, and then the fag had the nerve to bend over. Goddammit, it wasn't supposed to make Dean hard, it really wasn't, and Dean was sure Castiel had seen his boner, which made it all-the-more worse. But now that he noticed, his room was quite simple. Books marked along the shelves, a simple desk set-up, a few lights— nothing seemed personal about it.
— but Dean held back. For Castiel, he held back.
photos. Photos of women, showing nothing but their cleavage peeking through a shirt, or photos taken from a low angle with a view up into their skirts, showing their thin, damp panties, and the comments? Castiel wondered if the people in the comments thought it was disgusting, but to his surprise— there had been nothing but love and support in the comments. Hearts for as low as he could scroll.
"Is it because of what Alastair did." Castiel stated, more than asked, and on instinct, began to pull away, but firm, strong hands held him in place, and when he turned back to Dean again, tears laced Dean's eyes which stunned Castiel for a good, solid moment. Dean wasn't one to cry. He was reticent, rarely ever showed his feelings or shared his problems with Castiel; he repressed them until they ate away at him, but he never let them show, he never cried— but this Dean. This Dean was something unlike the hot-headed volcano of a man that Castiel knew Dean to be. This Dean's eyes were twinkling with tears, and he almost let out a small laugh at that.
Everything was quite civil.
"How about we go somewhere quiet, fag? Somewhere private, just the two of us having the time of our lives, doesn't that sound great?" Alastair growled, and Castiel felt his body tense up under their hands, "-and then, when we're all alone, you can keep screaming, shouting, begging me to stop. But I won't."
The four of them, save for Castiel, broke into a murmur of agreement, and Castiel simply gaped at then, mouth hung open.
Next update: 28 May.
"Erm, I don't want to talk about it."
The five of them went silent in consideration, when at once, Dean cursed. "Yo, there's only about twenty-minutes left till three. Are you sure you want to do this today? How about tomorrow?"
"You're insane."
"Yes, I do realise how insanely stupid and random it is for you. And yes, this is a conscious decision. And no, I haven't smoked anything."
Castiel yawned, and rolled over onto his back, staring up at the ceiling and hoping it would help him form a coherent thought.
They lay side by side on the bed, with Dean curled around Castiel. "Was that alright?" He asked, softly, once the silence had become heavy.
"You made this all by yourself?"
"Hey Dean?"
"Whore wouldn't be the right word, Novak, I mean, aren't you one too? I've never slept with you."
Next Update:
"Right now, put it in right now," Castiel hissed, "-I've never had anything so big inside me before, I hope it leaves me gaping."
"Just put it in already—"
loveseat at the corner of the room, his shoulder crashed against something firm, and he clicked his tongue at the person in front of him, looking up to reprimand them, only to find—
"What were they about?"
Castiel set his pen down, and stared down at Dean, rolling his tongue around in his cheek in thought. Dean gazed up at him, hoping Castiel would give into his puppy-eyes, and at last, he was successful, because Castiel groaned and slid his chair back from the table.
"Cas? Meg?"
"Well, this ain't really a Supreme Court case, so I think, yeah, it might just work. And the thing about pressurising authority— pretty neat. Bully them until they don't have a choice. But you're going to have to keep this whole viva la revolution attitude going. If you falter, you lose your chance. Unity is the key, okay?"
"Time, and time, and time again— I told you— I
"Morning," John grumbled, and Dean glanced at him.
Castiel's eyes flew open wide, only to find the man panting, his face buried in the crook of Castiel's neck, sucking a deep, purple hickey onto his young, supple skin as his finger rubbed down Castiel's taint, and the sweat had made it's way smoother.
Dean couldn't tear his eyes away from Cas.
"I can't— it's your mother's—"
Each step forward felt as if he were descending into a bottomless pit, and yet, he compelled himself to move, to walk, to keep himself steady. Every thought, every instinct threatened him to scream, to shout, to tear down the world around him, to light it on fire, just because Castiel had said it—
"I asked you a question, bitch. Do you still have them on?"
"I mean— I—"
After what felt like an eternity, the elevator dinged and its metal doors slid open. Dean sighed and thanked God in the back of his mind for the empty elevator, before tugging Castiel in behind him.
"I know," Castiel whispered, "—and I'm sorry. You have every, every right to be angry at me. You could ignore me still, and I wont mind. You could punch me I guess, I don't mind, I really don't. But just—" He swiped a hand across his nose, "—just know that I'm— I'm not sick of you, Dean, and I never will be. I was tired of the fighting, of the taunting, of
Dean, Lord bless him, spanked Castiel's ass before heading towards his bag, only adding to the disgust on Michael's face.
"Meg is my friend, Dean," Castiel started, waving his spoon over at Meg, "-we're eating ice-cream."
"Vaso—?"
Castiel didn't really see anyone else around them, but the fact that Meg Masters, a person Castiel never spoke to before, was here to talk to him, privately at that, struck him quite odd, and absently he nodded, and turned to lead her into his house. Once inside, she shut the door behind them, and Castiel toed off his boots and slipped into his slippers. He dropped his keys in the bowl next to the door, and stood aside to lead Meg in. He didn't doubt she would be astonished by his house, because Meg came from quite a wealthy family herself, from an esteemed social class.
, and dashing into the library. Inside, he turned his head from side to side, wondering which aisle Castiel would be in. On a fluke, he walked into the study-help aisle, and paused in his tracks the moment he found
The loose threads are now tying up, we'll be reaching the end soon. ☺
"Mhm," Meg snorted, "—sorry, but I only open up about my deepest darkest insecurities on the third date."
"But nobody wants to come forward. We do need a leader, but we don't know anyone who can take this movement ahead." Silence followed Castiel's words, but a moment later, it was Benny who spoke up. "But I do."
Dean laughed, and shrugged. "Why not? I'm game for a challenge if you are."
And somehow, Castiel felt his cock twitch for a moment.
Flushed and yet, feeling the tension in the room seep away slightly, Castiel had answered. (Which now that he thought of, he never should have).
Castiel's glassy eyes travelled across Dean's face, before wandering down to the space between them, and Dean leaned in to listen to Castiel speak in a soft, timid voice.
"Daddy—" Castiel called out, eyebrows furrowed and mouth dropped open, as he clenched his hole around Dean's cock and made his hole tighter for Dean to fuck into. Dean cursed under his breath, a soft
"Oh, uh, by the way, Benny," Dean called out, "-the house's a mess. Don't call the cops on me."
"Wow, way to make yourself comfortable," Castiel shrugged, and pulled the seat out at his desk.
"Yeah, I figured. Anyway, we've got beer, vodka, diluted beer which is basically beer with water, it tastes like crap but y'know. We also have fruit punch, in case you don't want to get smashed," Benny rattled off, and led Castiel towards what seemed to be a counter, more like an indoor-bar. On the counter were large bottles and jugs, and Castiel reached out to grab a plastic cup for himself.
thrust up against his ass.
"Leave."
"Oh?" Castiel turned around, facing Dean. Castiel's face had gone pale and wet, and his eyes had swollen up all red and pink, "—is that not why you've been trying to set me up with someone? It's just an excuse, isn't it? So you can get me off your back? Well, you could just say it to my face, I won't mind—"
Warning: Vague implications of rape.
"Can't we stay like this forever?" Dean asked, his voice breathless as he pressed another trail of kisses slowly down Castiel's chest, rucking his t-shirt up, and holding him as delicately as a porcelain doll in his arms. Castiel whimpered, shoving a hand over his mouth to stifle his noises, when at once, Dean reached up to link his fingers through the hand on Castiel's lips and bring it down.
these last few days."

Dean walked around the couch and brushed past Castiel into the passage, his boots stomping against the wood as he climbed up the set of stairs, and Castiel followed after him. He paused at the top of the stairs, and Castiel led him into the passage towards his bedroom.
s and
Castiel smiled, a glorious, victorious smile, and poked his tongue out to moisten his lips, which caught Dean's attention at once, as he managed to keep his gaze on Castiel's eyes.
Dean nodded, unable to say anything more, as he wiped his tears away, and sucked in a few, deep breaths. He slunk away from Bobby, back against his chair, and sighed. His skin felt numb, and though he wanted to move, he couldn't find it in himself to do so.
Unable to help himself, Castiel crossed the distance between them, and rubbed a hand over Dean's back to help him steady himself. But instead, Dean grabbed Castiel's arm, and stood back up, towering over Castiel with a strange, guilty gleam in his eyes. Castiel's skin crackled with a spark where Dean had touched him, and he staggered back a few steps until his back crashed against the wall.
"As you may have known already, three students from our class have been hospitalised for a few days, Alastair Knight, Nick Morningstar, and Gordon Walker. I don't know how, I don't know why, I don't know when. It was beyond school premises, so frankly, I couldn't care less if one of you beat them up—" Somebody whistled, Benny maybe, and Mrs. Barnes sent him a look, "—that being said, I do hope you all wish them well and provide them with notes if need be."
"Hm? Oh, the picture—" Dean chuckled and shrugged, "-a while ago after school."
He had been dying to tell Dean what Meg and he had planned, but he had been bound back by his respect for Meg. Since that had been covered already, Castiel knew telling Dean the main plan wouldn't hurt in anyway.
The sound of Castiel's deep, hoarse laugh rumbled under Dean's skin, and he pressed another kiss to Castiel's lips. "Round two?"
They walked out the conference room, ignoring the obvious chatter about them the second they left, and Dean guided Castiel to the elevator. The silence in the air was thick, heavy, suffocating— anticipation and impatience lingered in the air, and Dean couldn't find it in himself to turn back, because one look at Castiel's tousled, raven hair and those obscene, pink lips and Dean would lose it.
Dean gasped to himself,
The terrace was much windier that morning, and the air felt moist and humid. Dean loosened his tie, and undid the button at the top of his uniform to allow some ventilation for his body. Castiel handed him an earphone, and Dean plugged it into his ear without a thought. They rested their heads against the concrete wall, and Dean fished out a cigarette and a lighter from his pocket, lit it up, and took a drag of it.
inside me—?"
"Is this alright?" He asked, feigning innocence in his voice, and heard Dean gulp.
Dean stared at his hand for a moment. Even if it was just for now, Dean was glad to hold onto Cas.
"R-right," Castiel stuttered, and took his bag from Dean's hands, and slipped into the passenger seat, while Dean slipped into the driver's seat. Sitting in Dean's car, side by side with Dean, it was an experience Castiel had never thought he'd ever feel. The car was everything Dean was. Big, loud, shining— and it smelled like Dean's cologne— something Castiel would never tire of. Dean grabbed onto the back of Castiel's seat as he turned his head back to reverse the car out of the parking lot. Castiel watched him, strangely captivated as he watched Dean drive, focused and natural, as if he'd been doing it for ages. But then again, like Dean said, his father owned a garage, maybe Dean was used to being around and driving cars. His hands were rough too— coarse palms that you'd get if you used work with your hands a lot.
"Perfect. I'd say perfect."
Thursday had been hectic— coming back after almost a week, some of his classmates had expressed their concern, and Meg, surprisingly, had been more than welcoming. She'd gone as far as bringing painkillers for Castiel, as well as she would check in with him after every lecture. As loved as Castiel felt, he realised the more pitiful reason behind why she continued to do so— to do for Castiel what she wished someone would have done for her. As upset as Castiel was at that discovery, he didn't bring it up with Meg, simply to respect her decision to move on. Dean however, had been annoyed by Castiel and Meg's sudden, fast-paced friendship. Maybe because Dean had been unaware of what Alastair had done to Meg, so he assumed she was still one of Alastair's gang members. Though Castiel desperately wanted to let Dean in on his and Meg's shared trauma, he knew better than to violate Meg's privacy.
The song ended, and the host rambled on about Metallica and Led Zeppelin, before jumping into the next song, which just so happened to be a Zeppelin song, and both Dean and Castiel turned to each other at the same time, only to break into a chuckle. Before they could finish humming along to the song, Dean was pulling into the a parking spot next to a small, mediocre-looking diner.
Meg pulled him in a brief hug, before pulling away.
"So, now that you've got a promotion, don't ya' think Novak here deserves a raise?" Benny teased, and the rest of the men hummed in agreement. Dean simply glanced at Castiel. The guy was nerdy in every sense. Spoke in articulate sentences, wore a trenchcoat every morning over a neatly pressed navy-blue suit. Had a large, black pair of glasses that sat on his nose. Tight-lipped, with an obscure sense of humour, the guy was a piece of work, but God, if he wasn't good at what he did. Punctual down to the T. Not a single delay. Managed Dean's work with absolute efficiency. God knew the guy deserved a raise.
he'd looked that night when Dean had bumped into him on the foyer, and he still did. But more tragic now. More ruined. More broken. More hurt.
The two of them stood at their locker, with Dean lingering behind Castiel as Castiel picked out his textbooks. Anna and Meg were a few feet away, laughing and engaging in what Castiel could only describe as
"Well," Castiel cleared his throat, "-think of it as a committee, of sorts. Or a group, union, whatever you want."
"Leave him alone, Alastair. He isn't an object, and he certainly isn't
Meg sighed, and her eyes glanced between Dean and Castiel, "—I promised my dad I'd come. But I'll text you, 'kay?"
"Yes, mom."
Warning: Very minor violence. Just a punch.
Meg blinked back to the present, and Dean watched as Benny rubbed a hand down her back. It was adorable yes, but Benny was— taken. And Dean wouldn't encourage Benny to go for it especially since he was already with Andrea, but that wasn't the point. The point was, Meg was opening up.
Castiel felt his mood sour at the word, and he turned his eyes down to the floor. He knew Dean would never mean it in a pitiful way, but the thought that something was wrong with him, it turned him foul. "I'm not sick, Dean."
Castiel got off.
"Dean— oh, fuck, right there—" Castiel cried out, and Dean slapped his ass, a nice bright red colour rising on Castiel's skin where the blow landed. Castiel screamed out loud, much to Dean's pleasure, as he scrambled to hold onto the arm rest, gaming console forgotten. "—oh, fuck, yes, yes—"
Meg sighed, and nodded. She ran a hand through her chocolaty-brown hair, and at last, composing herself, paused before Mr. Singer's door. Castiel stood beside her, and when he realised Meg was not making the next move, took it to himself to knock on Mr. Singer's door, and wait. It must have taken Mr. Singer about a few seconds, before the door swung open, and he stood there— short, slightly stout, and as always, looking grumpy.
"Fuck," Dean grumbled, and slapped Castiel's ass, before slipping down on the couch next to Castiel's pliant, loose body. Pants filled the air as they regained their breaths, until at last, Castiel turned back to Dean, reaching back to slip two fingers into his ruined, come-leaking hole, and pushed some come back into his asshole. His eyes were lidded with pure lust, and Dean couldn't believe how vulgarly arousing Castiel looked.
"Do you have a problem with that?"
"Thank you, Mr. Singer, for being with us on this. It means a lot."
Once again, the class was pin-drop silent.
Alright, that was it. Dean let out a slow, laboured breath, and compelled himself to meet Castiel's foxy eyes. "You see Mr. Novak, we are a humble institution. We don't strive for brilliance, but for helping out our clients in the best way we can, to the fullest extent." A pause, "—perhaps you and I both need to clear out some things before we proceed with this discussion."
"Oh yeah? So what, Singer gave me a C for no reason at all?"
At once, Dean and Castiel paused, and found sitting on Castiel's desk, Alastair, Dean's friend and the most
"I didn't mean to freak you out."
"Drive safe!"
…" Castiel whispered, and pressed a finger to Dean's lips. Dean dropped his eyes down to gaze at the finger for a moment, before licking it. Castiel, who was leaning down to Dean's cock snapped his wide eyes up at Dean, and watched awestruck as Dean sucked the finger into his mouth, before rolling it out. "What, think you're the only tease here?" Dean grinned, devilish bastard that he was, and Castiel grunted, before going down on Dean's cock, swallowing him in right to the hilt. Dean's balls slapped against Castiel's chin, and Castiel kept himself buried in the trimmed bush of dark blonde hair above Dean's cock, as he felt tears threaten his eyes.
Heh, you want me to be a
"Stop looking at me like that, creep," He growled, but his voice had lost its edge. Castiel shrugged nonchalantly, and picked up his pen, leaning forward to write, but the moment he did, the fabric of the panties slipped inside his ass, rubbing over his taint. Two gasps rung through the room. One, understandably Castiel's, and the other—
"It's uhm, it's Castiel," Dean whispered, and watched as Benny's eyebrows shot up.
"Benny, I—"
eighteen, since he was taller, and seemed to have a good, lean build under the oversized t-shirt, with a narrow waist and wide, sharp hips that Dean would love to bruise.
Silence settled between them again, reminding them they were still somewhat strangers, when at last, Meg spoke up.
"I—" Bobby sucked in a sharp breath of air.
"I, I can't tell you how gorgeous your hole is, Cas, it's, it's beautiful— so much pinker than I remember, so much tighter,
Castiel's eyes snapped open, and he grabbed Dean by the tie to pull him down and stare him right in the eye.
Dean watched Castiel, who walked down their driveway, with his head hung down, a soft, pink glow on his face, Dean felt his stomach churn for a moment. Perhaps, the real Castiel was nothing like the one in Dean's dreams. He was brighter, and prettier, and much more delicate than Dean had thought, not by nature, but by features. And maybe, Castiel always had been beautiful. He ran his fingers through his hair, before disappearing around the corner of the block, and Dean stood there, numb, wondering why he couldn't think of anything but Castiel.
"Bobby?" Castiel and Meg asked in tandem.
The question made Castiel falter, and he hummed for a moment, trying to think of how to respond, before finally— finally, he could think of what he wanted to be, not what he was supposed to be.
Poor Dean. He thought he'd figured out Castiel. Oh please. It was far from the truth. But for now, Castiel wondered, he was happy to play along with Dean's misunderstanding.
Dean grinned, and stole a kiss off Castiel's lips. "Oh, he left a while ago. Family emergency. He'll be at your office in a while. You guys should go on ahead."
the first touch of the cool air to his cock had Dean twitching, and he spit into his hand before stroking it over his cock. He was huge, bigger than average, and he knew it. Ten inches was quite big, and he wondered in the back of his mind, whether the boy would even be able to fit all of him inside.
Each set of eyes now turned to Castiel.
"And I wasn't the only one." Meg added, with a glance at Castiel. Anna picked up on it, and Dean watched, a bit awestruck at how they managed to avoid the word as if simply saying it would prick them.
"What's she doing here?"
Castiel would have the best moans, Dean mused, paired with his deep, velvet voice that felt like whiskey, every moan— breathy or whiny, would sound like an absolute treat.
Only when Dean trudged into the kitchen, annoyed and dumbstruck did Castiel realise how loud their music was.
"Extremely." Castiel gulped.
The air was heavy with sheer anticipation and desperation, and for a moment, the two of them studied each other, eyes roaming across each other's face, before Dean licked his lips and dove down to press a kiss to Castiel's lips. For a moment, Castiel was stunned at having to taste himself on Dean's lips, but the more Dean kept going at it, sucking and nipping and biting— Castiel could hardly care.
"I know. I understand what you did and why you did it, Dean. I don't forgive you because you and I both know they were extreme, but they don't mean as much to me today as they did before. I love you, I really do. And I want to help you change, and I'm proud of you for doing it."
"I'm sorry for leaving you alone."
"You don't have a choice, Novak," Dean chimed, before slipping back into his car.
Instead, warm, tender hands cupped Dean's jaw, and Dean let his hands fall away from his face to find Castiel staring up at him, a soft, fond expression in his eyes, one Dean probably didn't deserve to be looked at with, and in that moment, Dean realised, having Castiel beside him had never soothed him before as much as it did then.
"B-boss?" Castiel asked, uncertain, as Dean flipped him around, and bent him over the sink, forcing him to look at himself in the mirror in front of him.
"Ah, that explains it," Sam mused, and Castiel snorted, suppressing a laugh when he found Dean's cold eyes, "-great, so you won't mind us being friends, right?"
They may have stayed that way for a while, before Dean's stomach rumbled, and they pulled away after a laugh.
Dean couldn't swallow his food. He simply couldn't. On his side, Castiel's eyes had turned down, his face had lost all colour, and his lips pressed into a flat line. He fidgeted with the hem of his shirt, and Dean couldn't help but feel his chest heave with pain.
It was a lot. Saying what he said. But Castiel felt
Without warning, Dean grabbed Castiel by the front of his shirt, and crashed their lips together. Castiel moaned into the kiss, unable to comprehend it until Dean's eager hands traveled up his shirt and over his back. "Fuck," Dean growled, "—this is way hotter than I thought it would be."
Because Dean remembered seeing the lightest traces of bruises on the inside of Castiel's thighs on Saturday morning. He hadn't been too focused on them, especially with how beautiful Castiel had looked in the sunlight, but in hindsight— it did strike him odd that there were bruises on his thighs when all Alastair had done was use his mouth.
"Must be Sammy," Dean grunted as he lifted himself off the bed and walked out the door. Castiel let out a breath, and finally, sat at the edge of the bed. Talking to Dean about what he wanted— it was liberating and gave Castiel a much required insight into Dean. Somewhere in the back of his petulant mind, he wished he could be part of Dean's future. He wanted to be. He wanted Dean, at that moment, and for every moment after. Because if not for Dean, Castiel wasn't sure how longer he could keep himself going. Sure, they were working hard to get Alastair suspended, and all of it was quite a feat, but even then, Castiel couldn't help but think of the sheer pain coursing through his body at the mere thought of Alastair. His hands, his thighs, his face— everything hurt when he thought of it, some kind of muscle memory, and he was trying to be strong, trying to pretend he was alright, but he knew some day, he would have to let it out. And he didn't want Dean seeing it. Because it would only hurt Dean, and Dean had already been through enough.
"Hey, uh, I need to go call Sammy and tell him I'm spending the day here, I'll be back, 'kay?"
Michael looked horrified. A living corpse, if you asked Castiel. Colourless, speechless, and scarred.
"You have to stop that, Dean."
"We should, um, we should erm, leave—"
"How was school?" Castiel asked Sam, who swallowed down a mouthful of cereal before turning to Castiel. Sam was a cute, young boy, and always listened to Castiel with complete attention. He was bright, hardworking, and genuinely intelligent. Conversation with him was always interesting.
"Dean? What are you talking about?"
"Calm down, calm down, Dean, I'm fine. I'm much better than before, and yes, I had breakfast, I had lunch, and I did have my meds. I'm okay, okay?"
"Fuck my hole, please, professor Winchester?"
"School was well, school. Got into an argument with someone over the future of cryptocurrency, it got intense. Besides that, things were alright. How come you're here?" Sam asked, before scooping more cereal into his mouth.
Dean's face was
"God, I have to taste this," He sighed, before dropping down to his knees, arms still holding Castiel open against the wall, as he dove in, and licked at Castiel's hole. Castiel couldn't hold back another round of dirty, filthy moans as Dean ate him out, with loud, obnoxious slurps, tongue fucking the boy's tight, teenage hole.
"No," Castiel scoffed, "—me? You want me to lead a protest?
"Shut up," Castiel rolled his eyes fondly, and snuggled into Dean's arms, "—don't ruin the moment."
I miss you.
Castiel swallowed thickly, letting Mr. Singer's words settle inside him. He nodded, and sent Mr. Singer a small smile, before turning the knob of his classroom door in, and pulling it open. He knew already that the eyes of twenty other children were now on him, but he couldn't care. Inside, Mr. Devereaux continued to teach, but paused at the sight of Castiel.
Benny scanned his eyes over the counter for a few seconds, before grabbing a bottle and holding it up to Castiel, "-this one."
"Do s-something," He urged Dean, who glanced up at him for a moment, as if having been pulled out of a trance.
could make him forget Castiel. He shoved through the crowd, not apologizing for who he pushed and bumped into, until a hand dragged him to the side, and Dean gasped, eyes wide and gaping as he stared up at Benny, who looked quite drunk.
"Alright, I've told you already, this isn't an official conversation, so I won't tell them. And about those three bastards, god, I always knew they were sick in the head but rape— I think I'm gonna' throw up."
watched, called Dr. Sexy MD, and how Dean
"Oh, by the way, I stole some of your fries, sorry 'bout that." Dean snorted, and the tension between them seemed to dissipate with those few words. Castiel chuckled, and stole a forkful of pie off of Dean's plate, stuffing it into his mouth with his eyes right on Dean, who looked aghast. Castiel grinned, and bounced his shoulder, continuing to stuff his face with his cheeseburger as Dean pouted.
"Do you want some coffee?"
Dean sighed, "—I will. I love you."
Knowing Castiel needed him just as much as he needed Cas— it was strangely satisfying.
The crowd seemed to have been disturbed, and the man crashed into Castiel again, but this time— he didn't move back. Annoyed and at his limit, Castiel looked up to the man, who had startling bright green eyes, which seemed weary with exhaustion, and short, spiky blondish hair. He was clad in a suit and tie, and Castiel sighed,
to Dean.
"Say my name again, when you come."
Castiel rolled his eyes.
"Oh?" Dean asked, "-but I haven't played with you at all?"
weirdo showed up at Dean's door.
came from both Meg and Dean, and Castiel smiled before hopping up on the counter and grabbing a spoonful of ice-cream.
A choked cry drifted through the air and Dean squeezed his eyes shut, gritting his teeth together. A shudder wracked his body at the anticipation of what he'd see, what he'd find—
"After you left, he came down to where all of us were dancing. He beat the
"So at the end of the day, you needed attention too, huh, just like me?" Castiel asked.
"Mother," Castiel grumbled, and Dean simply turned his eyes down to the floor. "-if you're going to pick a fight, I'd rather escort Dean and myself out."
"You should tell him already."
they took every chance to tease them about it. Benny, who had bonded with Castiel over the past few days, would shout out inappropriate comments in the middle of lectures, and as funny as it was for the rest of the class, it was embarrassing for Castiel. Castiel remembered how the last lecture of Friday had been a sex-ed lecture, and Dean, being the most disruptive in the class, had been called on to demonstrate how to quickly slip a condom onto a plastic banana. Unfortunately for Dean, who got his fingers slippery, the condom took him a whole six minutes to get on, and Benny,
Castiel grinned, and pressed his head into Dean's chest with a yawn. "We'll talk to him tomorrow, is that fine?"
That tugged a smile at Castiel's face.
"Yeah, I'm gonna' call you in a little while, just wanted to tell you I'm heading over to Cas's place, see ya' in a hour or so."
Dean watched.
he thought to himself,
Dean blinked up at Castiel, stunned at first, before grinning and pushing himself up to kneel between Castiel's wide, open legs. "There's my Cas— there's that
"Why did you think I wouldn't?" Dean asked, eyes narrowing in confusion and concern, and Castiel faltered, mouth dropping open to reply only to shut it again. Maybe he wanted to say something. Dean wished he knew what Castiel was thinking. "Cas, I," An exasperated sigh slipped past Dean's lips as he swallowed tightly, "-I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you when you needed it. But I promise, from now on, you'll never have to be alone ever again. Ever. I'm going to make sure nothing bothers you, I'm gonna' make sure to rip apart anyone who tries to hurt you, I'm gonna'— I'm gonna' be good to you, I swear—"
One hour later, Castiel was bent over on the large, rosewood desk in Dean's office, with his shorts pooling around his ankles and his knees spread apart wide as his hole, swollen and gaping, quivered from having been fucked with a plug over and over again. Dean crouched behind him, stealing gentle, sneaky licks from Castiel's hole, and the unpredictability of when his tongue would tickle Castiel's hole and send a wave of pleasure through him had Castiel thrumming with anticipation.
Dean parted his lips, and Castiel's eyes snapped down to watch as he darted his tongue across the bottom before pressing them shut, as if he was hesitating, before finally, he was leaning in to crush his lips against Castiel's.
Castiel's throat went dry as he gazed up at Dean, who appeared to still be in a minute shock over Castiel's existence at Benny's party.
Alastair had run away. Good, good, good for him. But then again, Alastair
Besides the clothes, Bobby had also given Dean a bottle of Chardonnay to gift to the Novak family. Visiting them empty-handed would have been a shame, not only to Dean, but to Bobby, and these were Bobby's words. So, with a small, pristine gift-basket in his hand, Dean stepped out of the Impala, and made his way up to the front door of Castiel's home.
"Would you mind if I stayed the night then?"
"Well, if there's anything I've learnt over these past few months, it's that blackmailing may not be a good thing, but it sure does get the job done, doesn't it."
"It was," Castiel tried to think of a word, but found nothing that could possibly be said, "—indescribable. I've had fingers, and erm, toys up there before, but never a, never a—"
"It must be the last lecture, right?"
, but it was terrible what they'd witnessed together, and Dean wasn't surprised that it would take Benny time to recover.
"I thought, I could, erm, set you up with someone I might know, based on your taste."
"Dean," Bobby sucked in a breath, "-I want you to know that everything we speak about right now is completely unofficial. I'm not your teacher right now, you're not my student. I'm just uncle Bobby, and you're just Dean, 'kay?"
"On Friday… What I saw wasn't the only thing Alastair did to you, was it?"
So lost in his struggle to change Dean's mind, Castiel barely realised how quickly time had passed by, and it wasn't until the school bell rang a second later, that Castiel jerked back in surprise, but even more surprising, were Dean's hands holding his waist to keep him from stumbling backwards. Their eyes met for a moment, Dean's intense and stern, and Castiel swallowed nervously, before mumbling a
"Zeppelin?"
Anna nodded, and Dean noticed how her eyes kept flickering back to him which was, well, nothing short of awkward.
"You know," Dean started, "-I'm genuinely confused. Like I mean, genuinely. Why do you like that shit so much? What, do your parents not love you enough or somethin'? Don't you have friends? Oh wait, you don't." A vicious laugh rumbled past Dean's lips. Castiel felt his lips twitch, and he tried to suppress the anger coursing through him. Anger, because he knew Dean was right. Castiel's parents couldn't be less bothered about him, all they cared for was an A on his report card. And friends? Please, as if anybody had even tried to speak to Castiel. He wasn't quite approachable himself, opening up took a long time, and he'd often lose himself in his own company. It was how he had lived for the past seventeen years. Why would it be any different now?
"Shut up," Castiel snapped, "-you're— you're not— you're straight."
"You know," Castiel started, "—I used to be able to predict what you were thinking, back when we were getting to know each other. But these days, not so much."
"Fading, you say. Guess we'll just have to get you some more, huh." Dean murmured, and leaned in to press a kiss to Castiel's neck. Castiel pushed him away with an incredulous.
It was a guilty pleasure.
A wistful smile spread across Castiel's face before he turned back to browse through the books, "-so, what if I have?"
Maybe then, Castiel could find someone who loved him much more than Dean did. Someone who never hurt him.
"You, I mean, why do you look like you've never studied before? It's easy, I've been telling you for the past fifteen minutes."
Bile rose at the back of Castiel's throat as he watched the video play— a video he had uploaded not less than five minutes ago.
"The names, the events, the evidence. I'm going to need at least ten people supporting you, and acting as witnesses. I need teachers as witnesses too. So, names. And I can't guarantee I will suspend Alastair Knight."
Their hands flew in a frenzy of hugs and squeezes, until at last, Castiel had ended up in Dean's lap, pushing Dean's pants down to dig his heavy, hot and damp cock out of his boxers. It was big, no doubt, and Castiel could only partially wrap his hand around the girth of it. A moments fear gripped Castiel, but he knew with Dean he had nothing to be afraid of.
Dean didn't move. He simply let Castiel hold onto him.
"Like a sixth base?" Castiel sniggered, causing Dean and Meg to break into a chuckle.
, Dean realised,
"You're being weird," Dean started, and scooped some potatoes into his mouth, "-too quiet. You got somethin' on your mind?"
"Fuck, Cas—" Dean groaned, and ran a hand down Castiel's jaw. There was no semblance of fear or uncertainty on Castiel's face, simply pure arousal and conviction in his eyes as he snapped his gorgeous, baby blues up at Dean, and wrapped his lips over the pink, throbbing flesh of Dean's cockhead. Castiel stared up at Dean, eyes narrow and hooded as he lapped at the precome pooling at the slit, and at last— sunk his mouth all the way down. Seven inches long, Castiel couldn't even fit it to the hilt in his mouth.
Benny stared at Dean for a moment, before Dean realised what he'd said, "-I, I, I mean, not, erh— n—not adorable, but uhm."
"I'm so proud of you, Cas. You were brave, heck, braver than I could've dared to be."
"Just get a new pen," Dean grumbled, pointedly averting his gaze, and Castiel grinned to himself, "-oh," He pouted, "—but this is my favourite pen."
"You wanna' go make-out in the car?"
"How are you the same person that I knew months ago?"
Dean shook his head with a sigh, and glanced down at his watch. Shit, he should go join Cas. He must be at the library. Dean scampered down the stairs, and dashed into the library, panting for breath when he found Castiel packing both of their notebooks into their bags. At the sound of Dean's heavy breath, Castiel turned around, and his face lit up, before softening again as he rushed over to Dean.
"Uh, no thank you."
"I hope you didn't mind the uh, spanking. Got a lil' lost in the character." Dean admitted shyly, and Castiel grinned.
"Yeah? You moonlighting as a stripper or sumthin'?" Victor called out, which earned a loud, cheery laugh from the table, including Dean.
The pressure that had already curled in Dean's gut only shot up at an alarming pace, and Dean tried his best to hold back. But instead of finishing in Castiel's mouth, like Castiel expected him to, Dean pulled out and stepped back, yanking Castiel up to his feet.
"It's alright. Why wouldn't it be? You like spreading your legs open for weird men, don't you? You probably even think of taking their wrinkly cocks too, don't you? God, you're a sick bastard."
"You fucking bitch—"
Dean groaned as he shoved a pillow between his thighs. It was a Saturday morning, and he wasn't quite sure what time it was, probably somewhere around dawn, but the sun hadn't risen yet. His room was cosy, the perfect blend between not-too cold and not-too warm, and yet, heat crawled across his skin, hair tingling, nerves crackling and pressure building in his gut. He knew what he'd find when he looked down, another morning of his boxers bulging at the front with morning wood. Sighing, but not wanting to open his eyes or leave the warmth of his bed, he shoved a hand into his underwear and wrapped it around his thick, heated cock— already quite hard and leaking at the tip.
