"I was a bit distracted." Sherlock glanced out the window to see where they were. "With this traffic, we've got a good quarter hour before we get home. Want to try again?"
Sherlock stepped past John to retrieve his coat. Once he had it on, it was easier to force his mind back to the case. He handed Lestrade the Crawfords' laptop so he could return it to the evidence technician.
"I've called for a separate car to take you there. Mummy is expecting you in time for tea."
"Then—is it Eurus? Is she back?" He sat up straight, all the fear he'd felt when Sherlock had first phoned him three days ago flooding back.
"I just wanted the coffee." John raised his cup and took a long swallow.
John pushed himself up so he was upright in Sherlock's arms, his head nearly brushing the ceiling, and threw himself backwards towards the mattress, catching Sherlock off guard. He tried to let go but was pulled down with him, landing on top of him on the bed, which worked out even if it hadn't been his plan.
"Did you...did you call Mummy to tell her about Eurus and Eve before you called me, Sherlock?"
"I—know. I just know."
"That's not true. And it wouldn't matter if it were." He'd thought confronting Moriarty like this would be difficult, but professing his love for John was the simplest thing in the world.
Mummy had been somewhat hesitant about agreeing to watch Rosie while Sherlock and John were on their honeymoon—it had been so long since she'd taken care of a child. But the past few days had been mostly delightful, and just when she'd feared that she and Daddy had run out of ways to amuse Rosie, Mycroft had shown up.
Moriarty laughed. "Oh, Sherlock. You're so much fun. Trusting your big brother. And of course Johnny, with his little gun. I'm sure nothing bad will happen as long as he's around."
"Leon is Mrs. Hudson's bodyguard, not ours," John said.
Sherlock grinned. "If Moriarty is stalking you, that ferocious beast there will protect you."
23: Friends and Family
"No, I haven't!" She bounced on the heels of her trainers. "Whenever you're on the telly she watches you and I know what you sound like because she always says how much she loves your voice." She extracted a phone from the pocket of her jeans and Sherlock spun around before she could snap a photo, pulling Stone along with him. Stone gave a little yelp of displeasure but then followed, trotting next to him as they squelched back towards the path.
He rummaged through his chemistry supplies in the kitchen until he found what he was looking for, then went into the bedroom to get the rest of what he needed.
"Sherlock, are you saying you want to get high?"
"Yes, I'm positive she's not going to have an eleven-pound baby."
"You do realise I could theoretically make a stronger case for myself as an adoptive parent based simply on financial resources and personal history."
Rosie stared at him, then turned to John. "Dad?"
"My experiments aren't pointless."
The next morning, he wasn't as well-rested as he would have liked to be, but Rosie was cheerful and he could drink as much coffee as he needed to in between patients. By noon he'd had enough caffeine that he was both wide awake and in a good mood. He was definitely going to bring takeaway over to Sherlock after he picked up Rosie—he'd just have to check to see if Sherlock's mother was still there, and if his father had joined her, so he would know how much food to get.
"I have my mother and Mrs. Hudson staying in the same building, John. Do you think I'm likely to go hungry?"
(See the end of the chapter for
—um, no
"Then don't be alone."
One more chapter to go!
"No, no, Eurus didn't—" John was completely lost. "What did Eurus and Mrs. Hudson say to you?"
Sherlock reluctantly followed John back into the kitchen, where Mycroft immediately began to harangue them. "Leon will be here by ten o'clock. I see that Mrs. Hudson has claimed your old room, Sherlock, which means he will have the room across the hall from her. I trust he won't be incapacitated by any fumes escaping from beneath her door."
"I promise." He swallowed, and a bubble of unexpected anxiety bloomed in his gut. "John."
"Good," John said. "And you're not sending us off to stay with them wherever they are now, either."
"You probably wouldn't be. You haven't been there in a while, but Alex's girlfriend has been playing with us most weeks."
That prompted a giggle from John, exactly as Sherlock had intended. Mycroft turned his disapproving gaze on John. "You both need to take this seriously."
"I see." John raised the newspaper again, though the article he'd been reading seemed less important now. On the one hand, Sherlock was a grown man who should be able to occupy himself when he needed to. On the other hand, he and John were now alone together in the middle of the day for the first time in ages. John lifted his head to look over the top of the paper at Sherlock, eyebrows raised in a particular question.
"And here I thought he just liked your pretty eyes," she said, and then pressed her lips closed with a smile.
"Yes," Sherlock replied, trying to keep his voice as neutral as possible. He could see the tremor in John's hand as he held the envelope, and had to make fists of his own hands to keep from grabbing it away from him.
"I guess you're right."
John plucked a half-eaten scone from Rosie's hand just before she flung herself towards the box. She and Sherlock tore off the wrapping paper and lifted the cover from this second box to reveal a brightly-coloured mobile, designed to hang over Eve's cot.
"Why don't they like each other?"
“Yes, I will.” Though perhaps he should let Mycroft drive, given how the keys were currently jittering in his hand. That would also allow him to spend the entire drive checking his phone for new messages.
"I just said I don't want to."
"Excuse me for once more failing and being human."
"They just wanted a special holiday together to celebrate getting married."
John's few brain cells that were still able to form thought marveled at the idea that he was able to have such an effect on Sherlock Holmes. He made another long, lustful sound and shifted his weight so he was able to lift his left hand, bringing it to wrap around Sherlock's fingers atop his own cock. "Please," he managed to say, and Sherlock's hips pressed hard against his arse as both their bodies stilled at the same time.
John took a deep breath and let it out slowly before explaining. "This is an early stage trial. They're only accepting a handful of people, maybe a dozen or twenty at the most. They only want ideal candidates. Ideal candidates aren't people who tend to put themselves in mortal danger in their everyday lives."
Continuing from yesterday's "Visiting" ficlet...
Mrs. Holmes turned to stare at Mycroft. "Mary the what?"
"Yes, I am aware." John sighed and reached for Sherlock's hand. "I guess I don't have to worry about not having anything to talk about at my next therapist's appointment."
Sherlock ignored his mother. "John, why did you never tell me you speak French?"
"That would ruin your career! No one wants to hire a detective who won't solve crimes. You're missing out on a chance to solve the business crime of the century."
"Yes, yes." Another sigh. "Send me the number she used and I will have it tracked. I'm sure Anthea won't mind working late on a Sunday night."
"Daniel," Rosie said. "You don't know him."
Sherlock scowled at him, unsure if Mycroft was trying to insult him, but ready to disagree with him on principle anyway.
"Mmmmnh." John closed his eyes as Sherlock's fingers wrapped around him. Eurus was right, although he'd never say those words out loud. But he wasn't going to last long. Sherlock knew the ideal pace, and how to pull and slide his hand just the way John liked it, and his cock in his arse was almost unbearably divine.
He went into the loo to retrieve his medical kit. When he came back out, Eurus had put Eve down in the cot next to the bed and was sitting on the edge of the mattress, holding her arm out to the side, the picture of a cooperative patient. As he fastened the blood pressure cuff around her arm, she kept talking. "It's good that you'll stand up to him, even when you know you can't win. Sherlock needs someone like that."
"No," Sherlock said. He scooted his chair closer and put one hand on the table, palm up, next to John's computer.
"Yeah, I think so." John rubbed at his right arm, where the bigger guard had been holding him. "She didn't drug me this time, I don't think."
"I'll get her," John said, and took longer than he would have liked to pull himself to his feet from where he'd been sitting on the floor. Wasn't having a child supposed to keep him young?
"How?" John asked.
John's shoulders' slumped. "I've had enough people see me shirtless for today. Don't need to flash Greg if he comes home."
"I may not be a chimney sweep, but I still feel as lucky as lucky can be." He sang the last few words, then stooped to drop a quick kiss on John's lips, before running off towards the bedroom, just begging John to chase after him.
"I would have, but this flat is too small and you'd see me if I tried to go and use Lestrade's toothbrush." He closed his eyes and let the sounds of the football match fade into background noise, empty and soothing as John silently played with his hair. He had a vague intuition that he should be the one comforting John today—
John frowned and forced his eyes up to Sherlock's face. "What do you want?"
"John!" Sherlock stood up from where he'd been crouched beneath the table and glanced over into the living room, but John was no longer there.
John looked at him over his shoulder and gave a brief chuckle. "I don't mind. I usually like seeing the reminder the next day." He tilted his head back between Sherlock's knees. "But right now I'd appreciate a more gentle touch."
"Ah," said John. "Good. That was good."
John turned his hand up to squeeze Sherlock's fingers; Sherlock glanced sideways and saw just the faintest hint of a smile. He grinned back at him.
John sighed and turned around to head up the stairs.
John glanced down at Rosie and then nodded toward the kitchen. His hands were full with bags from two different takeaway places and the chemist where he'd picked up some cough syrup and throat lozenges—Sherlock only liked the honey-flavored ones.
"You can win." John swallowed. "I do—I want you, too, Sherlock. You can win. I'm just afraid I'm not much of a prize."
"Hi, yes. Sorry." John cleared his throat and pulled Sherlock's phone from his pocket, holding it out between them. "You've got a text."
Some time later, he heard the lift run again. He put his hand down and grabbed Stone's collar just as the motor stopped and the doors folded open.
"Go for it." He shifted his position slightly, allowing Sherlock access to the upper half of his back as well as his shoulders, though he suspected some ibuprofen before he went to bed tonight would be more effective than whatever effort Sherlock made. But as soon as Sherlock began to move his hands, John realised he had underestimated his skill. His touch was not too heavy on the tender points near John's neck, but firm enough to loosen the overused muscles. "Where did you learn how to do that?"
Sherlock dropped down to sprawl on the sofa that John had just closed. "We've already had breakfast."
"That's it," John said. "Perfect. My head is between your knees. Now I'm leaning forward, putting my mouth against your cock. My lips are still closed, though. I'm dragging them along your cock, breathing on the head now. You can feel the tiniest bit of my five o'clock shadow, can't you?"
"Sherlock. She has your eyes. She'll probably end up the spitting image of you."
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock opened his mouth to tell her that he knew exactly what she thought of staying with his parents, but John intervened before he could. "That reminds me, Mrs. Hudson. Would you be willing to take care of Stone for us next month when we go to Spain for Sherlock's cousin's wedding?"
"Thank you, Mrs. Hudson." John emerged from the kitchen. "Though you do realise that Sherlock is not the one who does the cooking around here."
"No, it's not that heavy. Just too bulky for me to carry on my own." Sherlock pushed on the box, tilting it up. It was unlabelled apart from a string of random numbers and letters printed across one side, presumably meaningful only to the manufacturer of whatever it contained. "It's a rocking chair."
When they got to Baker Street, Sherlock separated himself from John long enough to get out of the car. He would have waited for John to get out, regardless of the rain, but Mycroft rolled down his window as if to speak to Sherlock, so he hurried over to the building instead, under the pretext of having to unlock the door. Mycroft didn't follow them, thankfully, though his car didn't pull away from the kerb until they had closed and locked the door behind them. They went upstairs to find Stone waiting for them, trying to crowd onto the lift with them as soon as the door opened.
Sherlock abandoned his previous tactic and stretched out on the sofa, putting his back to the room and to John and to everything he didn't want to talk about.
"Sherlock! Wake up and come look at this."
Sherlock slid back onto the sofa behind him. "By the way, I didn't mean to bite you hard enough to bruise last night."
"Did she really show up here without a change of clothes or anything with her at all?" John asked, realising that he hadn't seen any sort of bag belonging to Eurus in the bedroom. "Where was she staying before she came here? She doesn't seem like she's been living rough."
"What? Then you would actually try to find her?"
Sherlock closed his eyes and let himself feel John's weight atop him, holding him in place. It would have been perfect, except for the ache in his ankle. And the fact that he knew John was probably going to be uncomfortable after a few minutes, but wouldn't be able to move his legs easily to shift his position.
"Did I? When—oh. Yes, I remember. Then you decided to get high instead."
John raised his eyebrows, waiting for an explanation, and after a moment, Sherlock stepped forward, nudging John's legs apart with a knee. John didn't resist. He spread his legs so Sherlock could stand between them, though if Sherlock was hoping for some sort of intimate encounter right now, the bells were certainly not helping his chances.
"Of course I remember. What's your point?"
Sherlock and Stone were both waiting for him when the lift into the flat opened, which didn't surprise John at all. His first instinct was to warn them away, though that was rather pointless, given that dogs couldn't catch COVID-19 and if he was carrying the virus, then he'd doubtless already exposed Sherlock. But now that he knew about the positive test results from the patient he'd treated three days ago, every interaction he had with another person seemed fraught with peril.
Sherlock did look at him for a second, then leaned away from John's touch. "I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry."
Eurus pushed her hair back with the hand not holding the baby and then looked up to meet John's eyes. "From the waist down, it feels as if my body has been flayed open and both my hips broken. I haven't eaten since last night and I haven't slept since the night before that. So, no, my breasts are not among my top ten complaints right now."
John had always had a certain amount of anger simmering beneath the placid surface he showed the world, and Sherlock had seen it bubble over into violence before. He’d just never been a target of that violence himself.
"Yeah, but it's fun. And we don't always have enough players to practice with two full teams, especially on Friday nights."
Sherlock stepped close again and curled his right fist on John's shoulder, feeling the warm, slightly damp skin beneath his knuckles. "I never did anything like that when I was a teenager."
—in love with me, probably not a good choice
"That is a good photo of you, Sherlock," Mrs. Hudson said. "You look very dashing and heroic."
Sherlock opened his eyes and went back to work. He took fingerprints and sent scans of them to Mycroft, and thought about sending copies to Lestrade, as well, but decided to wait. Sherlock could hack into all of the databases Lestrade used, and bringing him in now would mean he had to explain the situation and waste valuable time.
"No. Boring." He stretched his uninjured leg out further, wriggling his toes against the arm of the sofa. "I like boxing. There's that gym where we caught the guy who was planning that attack during the Olympics. I bet they would waive my membership fees."
"Really? Congratulations!" John said.
"John!" Mrs. Holmes's voice boomed as she stood up from the sofa. "Congratulations!" She crossed the room in a few swift strides and wrapped him in a hug that he didn't have a chance to avoid.
John looked up from the post and stared at him. "Sherlock, are you jealous?"
Sherlock shot a sideways glance at him. "Is this an offer of sex? Is that now your go-to cure?"
Sherlock shook his head and leaned back against the worktop, keeping himself between Mummy and Mrs. Hudson and the block of knives, so they couldn't escalate their feud.
Sherlock watched him, ignoring the blood that was still dribbling from his nose. He wanted to comfort him, which was a bit absurd, given that John was the one who had punched him.
"After I shot Magnussen, Mycroft sent me to die in Eastern Europe. Eurus saved me."
"Did you mean what you said, the other night?"
Combining the last two prompts for this one:
"Hm, I was going to suggest we should text Mrs. Hudson to take Stone for his walk so we could go have dinner together somewhere."
for their beta'ing expertise as I slowly, slowly write this fic!
He hadn't thought about it until John's lips were wrapped around him, but it had been over a week since they had shared anything more than a quick kiss. And the last time they'd done anything like this in public had been a year ago, on the day John left the rehab centre. Sherlock let himself smile. Maybe this would work, and even if it didn't help him solve the case, at least things were better than they'd been at this time last year. He let himself fall into John's rhythm, thrusting into his mouth, though not as forcefully as he normally would, given his precarious position on Lestrade's desk.
"Thank you." John leaned over the tray she had placed on the rolling bedside table and inhaled. "I think I should be fine with this to start. I'm feeling much better."
"Oh, Rosie." He knew he should be upset with her, but instead he was relieved. Not Covid-19—she'd simply been sick because she'd eaten two dozen pieces of chocolate.
"Sorry, you did what with your phone?"
Force John to come to a crime scene, fail to make any progress in solving the crime, and then wrap it up by going for a ride in Sally Donovan's police car.
"Tea for you, John?" Mrs. Hudson asked as she set the cups out on the coffee table.
"I have to, it's a little—"
"Were you, though? Are you sure you found them all?" Moriarty's grin was audible. "You didn't miss any?"
"That's probably true. But—" John cut off in the middle of his sentence, and a fraction of a second later Sherlock heard the reason why—the lift was humming again. Someone downstairs must have pushed the button to summon it. Mrs. Hudson, of course, but Sherlock couldn't keep his mind from going to Mycroft's words this morning. Maybe they should start keeping it locked, just in case. He watched as John turned his chair back towards the lift, noted the way he shifted his arms and shoulders so he would have easy access to the gun. Another little surge of pride and lust thrilled through him at the thought of John shooting someone who was trying to break into their flat. Though having to clean up and deal with the police afterwards would put a damper on the mood.
"No. But what other options do you have? Or do you think Johnny's up for another visit with me? If I hurry, I could be there by the time he gets to work."
After he'd cleaned his hands as best he could, he turned to John. "I might've got your coat a little muddy...." He reached out to dab at John's sleeve with the wipe.
"What is he doing here?"
In case it's a deal-breaker for anyone, I don't plan to have any more violence between John and Sherlock in this fic. Sorry that it had to be here! I know how a lot of people feel about it in s4. But I did need to have a good reason for John to storm off alone, and I'm interested in the idea of John wanting Sherlock to fight back, which he never does in the show itself, though he does plenty of other crappy things to John.
"I'm not going to get sick."
"What?" John looked at Sherlock, brow creased. "Where are we going?"
The box of Christmas ornaments she was bringing to her new flat was almost full, but there was one more thing Rosie wanted. She picked up the Advent wreath, dusty and neglected, its plastic needles shedding. The four candles had never been lit, but were nicked and misshapen after two decades of being displayed every winter and then shoved into a cupboard for the rest of the year.
By Rosie Watson
"Was it?" Sherlock wriggled against him, trying to find a comfortable spot on the thin mattress. "Is that why you kept shouting 'God'? Or are you planning to go to church with my father if we're still here come Sunday?"
"Nope." Sherlock gave Mycroft a close-lipped grin. "We're leaving as soon as the flat is ready."
John looked up at Sherlock, eyebrows raised. "Yeah, that's a bit disturbing." He turned back to Mycroft. "Even more disturbing is that you let him escape after he did that. You should have increased his supervision."
Fortunately, John was able to do much more than that. He leaned forward and began to stroke Sherlock's cock, until it was hard and leaking, just as his own was. "Sherlock," he whispered.
"Of course you did. Anyway, this isn't a game, Sherlock. Moriarty cut off two people's fingers specifically to send them to you."
"What's this Mary person's last name?" Mycroft asked.
Sherlock stepped back just in time, yanking Stone by the lead. The dog whined and skittered behind him, wrapping his lead around Sherlock's legs. Sherlock felt John's knuckles just barely graze the bottom of his chin, almost a caress.
Fair warning: this is the chapter that finally starts to earn the fic's Explicit rating, though only for a couple of paragraphs. :)
"Not until Tuesday. Don't you want to go ice skating with Gram and Grandad tomorrow?"
"Nope."
"Yes, I'm apparently not up-to-date on all the possible uses of this newfangled technology," Sherlock said.
John let out a long sigh. "There are Legos," he warned, but he brought the box into the flat and dropped it in the corner of the room, next to the small desk and chair that Rosie had been using for class ever since her school had gone remote last month.
When they'd finished, John pressed his whole body against Sherlock's for a moment, then stepped away. "I'd love to take you into the bedroom and call you Jean-Luc, but I think that will have to wait until Rosie is in bed tonight. But perhaps for now I can interest you in a few episodes of The Next Generation, for old times' sake?" He raised his eyebrows in invitation, and laughed out loud when Sherlock finally gave him a silent nod of agreement.
He opened his eyes to the sight of his pillow. "Yes, okay," he muttered. "I'm awake. What?" He shoved the pillow to the side and discovered that it was not John next to the bed, but Mycroft, standing over him with an expression of concern that was a far cry from the composed and condescending front he normally displayed. Sherlock jolted fully awake. He sat up and glanced at John's nightstand, confirming that his watch and wallet were not there. "What's wrong? What's happened? Where's John?"
Sherlock scowled and threw himself down onto the sofa. "I thought Eurus had called you."
"Who are you?" she repeated. "Why didn't you knock or ring the bell like a normal person?"
"What else would it be?" Sherlock passed it back and forth between his hands; it was bright green, perhaps eight inches long and thicker around than the average man, though not as large as some of the other toys they had tried on each other over the past few years. "They also had a set of smaller anal plugs decorated with snowflakes, but this seemed...."
"Mrs. Hudson, would you mind grabbing Stone's lead off the hook and taking him downstairs for a little while?" John intervened, for which Sherlock was immensely grateful. He didn't need to deal with Mrs. Hudson's wittering concern when he had far more important things to attend to.
"I was outside," Sherlock replied. "You're warm. And wet."
Sherlock glanced at his watch.
"Yeah. I mean, I have those pictures of Mum from when I was a baby, but the wedding album had some really good close-ups." She took her phone out of her pocket and brought up the photo she'd used as a reference for the drawing.
John opened his eyes. "Thought we agreed we weren't going to get takeaway for every meal."
"I don't know," Sherlock said. "At first, I thought it was because she knew she was a danger and wanted to be locked up again, but I think it's more than that. I don't think she's emotionally capable of being free all of the time, and I think she knows it. There's too much data out here—the world is so big that it's overwhelming. I feel that way sometimes, and her intellect is vastly greater than mine. I think she's more comfortable when she's limited to four walls and a pair of guards. She can retreat into her own mind when she's locked up at Sherrinford, and not have to deal with anything else."
"Mycroft?"
Mycroft did as requested, and John pulled the laptop closer, pointing at the screen. "It looks like it's carrying a smoke grenade, but not one I've ever seen before."
if you're interested in that or anything else I might write. Thanks!
but before he could settle on the best choice, Moriarty raised the gun again.
"I almost didn't recognize you, the way you're dressed. But then I heard your voice. Not the 'ho, ho, ho' part, just your regular voice—that's unmistakable." She was grinning at him, but Sherlock was horrified.
John shook his head. "Are you making valentines?"
John sighed. "Unless it's directly in self-defence."
"No, Mycroft," Lestrade said. "He called me and I told him I didn't know where you two were."
"John, I can't."
"I—" He didn't know what he thought, but he knew he was seeing the truth on John's face. "No. But why...?"
"I'm sucking, but lightly. Teasing you. One of my hands is at the base of your cock, stopping you from thrusting all the way into my mouth."
But what his motivation may have been, Sherlock didn't know, and he didn't like not knowing.
"I started to draw up a spreadsheet, listing people who would be willing to take him for a walk for us. So far, I have several of the staff at Speedy's, that girl at the coffee shop who flirts with you every Saturday, and some people from the homeless network who could use a few extra pounds sent their way. But would we need to disinfect Stone before sending him out with somebody else? He can't carry the virus himself, but it could still be on his lead, or even in his fur, and who can resist petting him? He hates baths, so how could we effectively disinfect him before handing him over to someone else twice a day?"
That was one small mercy, at least. Although he’d rather the rest of the country see John’s nipple ring if it meant he didn’t have to explain it to Mummy and Daddy.
"I'll not have a criminal living under my roof!" Mrs. Hudson’s voice rose towards a shout, and John glanced nervously towards the still-sleeping Eve.
“Where is John?” Mycroft demanded. “There’s no sign of him outside and he hasn’t responded to my texts or calls.”
John stepped forward and Sherlock parted his legs, allowing John to stand between them. He leaned down for another kiss, but after a moment, Sherlock broke away and slid back, bringing his feet up to sit cross-legged on the mattress.
"I haven't," Sherlock said. "And I don't want to, usually. Because I never thought I'd be able to, with the only person I really wanted. The only person I loved."
"It's okay, sweetie." John tried to turn her around but she wouldn't loosen her grip on his arm. "I'm sorry, Mrs. Holmes. She's a little shy around people she doesn't see often."
"Of course I did, John. Relax. Eve is doing fine. She's a Holmes. We can thrive under any conditions."
"How?"
"Go find her mobile number. It should be somewhere at the reception desk."
"Me?" Sherlock turned to face him fully. "I'm not—I don't know how to help deliver a child."
Before he could second-guess himself again he pulled out his phone and tapped out a quick message.
Sherlock frowned at her.
"I just thought you might want something that feels good after today."
"Yes, but there's still a risk, even if it's very small."
"Good morning to you, too, Mummy," Sherlock said, bringing a hand up to his head as he stepped into the kitchen. His hair felt normal.
"Because you live in the middle of nowhere and lose power at least once a month," Sherlock replied.
Sherlock huffed a laugh. "We could do something else, something for you to enjoy, too."
Sherlock stood blinking as she walked away. Congratulations? To the two of them? Him and John? What did she mean by that? Did she think he and John were together? Why would she think that? He'd been trying to tamp down his feelings for John, since his desperate text to The Woman had produced no useful results. Why did Janine have to go and ruin—
“So much for no one in town having seen him,” Sherlock said, leaning back against the sofa as Mycroft fast-forwarded through the footage after John disappeared into the tiny public library at the far edge of town.
His ringtone, not just a text.
John had just poured himself a second cup when they heard a soft cry coming in stereo from the baby monitor and Sherlock's bedroom. Before John could even set his cup down, Sherlock was on his feet, shaking his dressing gown into place around himself. "I'll get her. She's had a good three hours of sleep, so she's probably wet and hungry."
Sherlock tensed at the memory and John threaded his left hand into his hair, the tips of his fingers coming to rest on his temple. "No, I understand why you'd want a cigarette today. It's been a rough week. I'm not sticking my tongue in your mouth right now or anything, but I understand. And I'm glad you're not trying to hide it from me."
"No, I want to see it." The segment ended, but John flipped to another station, looking for more coverage.
He ran every test he could think of, then texted Mycroft several times, impatient to hear the results of the DNA tests he had ordered. Mycroft had so far had no more luck than Sherlock. The owners of the fingers appeared not to exist, or more likely were simply two innocent civilians who'd never had reason to have their fingerprints or DNA samples collected by any authority. Sherlock slammed his fists on the table in frustration, then looked around to see why John didn't react to the sudden noise. There was no sign of him, or of Stone, for that matter, though surely they should have been back by now.
Sherlock shoved his laptop across the desk and tossed his phone on top of it, then collapsed on the sofa to retreat into his Mind Palace. When he surfaced an unknown amount of time later, it was to find John standing between their armchairs, his back to the fireplace.
"Oh, I'm not leaving."
He shoved the ladder back up into place overhead and walked over to Mrs. Hudson's rear window. Mycroft's camera was hidden above it; he sacrificed his left glove to cover it. Mycroft would know he had left the flat, but he wouldn't know what direction he'd gone, and Sherlock knew how to avoid all of the CCTV cameras that covered the nearby area. He walked through the alley for several streets until he judged it safe to venture out and hail a cab, double-checking the driver even though he doubted Moriarty would try to abduct him as he was on his way to their rendezvous.
He should have known that he didn't need to ask it out loud, not when Mycroft and Sherlock were involved.
"Oh, thank God." He exhaled and dropped into his chair, letting his head fall back for a second before sitting up straight so he could stretch his shoulders and neck.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. "You do get more colds than I do."
"We'll replace your windows with bulletproof glass, of course," Mycroft said.
"Never," Sherlock said. "But I've imagined doing it a lot. Always with you, just never under these exact circumstances."
"Hit me back!" John shouted.
Last year it snowed when we went to Gram and Grandad's house and we all played outside and Sherlock had to wear Grandad's trousers because Gram said he shouldn't get his suit all wet. If it doesn't snow this year Daddy says we can go to the ice skating rink instead.
John stretched his legs out until his toes touched the railing of the balcony, and looked back over his shoulder into the hotel room, to see how poorly Sherlock was treating the room service attendant. Thankfully, he appeared to have secured their food without incident, and a few moments later they were both sat on the balcony, enjoying their anniversary meal together. Ten years.
"I had a case once...." Sherlock began, then paused, though his hands didn't stop trying to coax the stubborn knot out of John's left shoulder. "That's not true. I've never really given anyone a massage before, but I've seen it done." He paused again, and John wondered where Sherlock could possibly have gone to study other people massaging one another. "I used to watch my father. Every day, after dinner, he and my mother would clear the table and do the washing up, and then she would sit in front of the fireplace in her chair and he would give her a massage. I always thought she was just tense from doing housework and looking after me and Mycroft. But now, I think...." His hands finally stopped moving as his voice trailed off.
"John." Sherlock sat down next to him at the table. "What was that about?"
"Hm. I'm pretty sure my father has some hair clippers if you want me to run upstairs and get them for you."
"We—" John began, then stopped. "Yeah, all right." He looked down at his own phone again. "Mycroft didn't get a lock on where the call came from, but if we can get to Dreyer's house before—do you think Moriarty's there now?"
Rosie wriggled until he loosened his grip. "You can't ground me. You never even told me she was in prison! I had to figure it out on my own. How was I supposed to know that she escaped? I thought she just got released and didn't tell Sherlock because she wanted it to be a surprise."
"Very good," Eurus said. "Please take off your trousers and pants, then get down on your hands and knees, Doctor Watson."
"Normal," John said.
"No, you started to wake up and he injected something into your thigh muscle, put you back under again."
"Yes. She apologised for the scent." Sherlock felt a sudden surge of gratitude that the label on the bottle touted its benefits as stress-relieving rather than sensual.
Sherlock shook himself out of his torpor and sat up. "You don't have to do that."
"Yes, thank you, John. Stony, look at the mess you've made on the floor now. Crumbs everywhere. You're as bad as your owners, aren't you?"
“My, such protest. It won’t hurt but a bit. Or, actually, it won’t hurt at all, will it?” Moriarty sprang forward and plunged the syringe into John’s thigh, depressing the plunger and leaping back immediately.
"What, to warm you up? You want me to be your blanket?"
Rosie giggled and flapped her arms, lost inside Sherlock's t-shirt. "It's too big!"
"Not food messes," Sherlock said. He strode into the kitchen, plucked a napkin from the pile on the table, then returned to the living room to hand it to Rosie. "And your father always makes me clean up all my messes when I'm done with them." He shot a glance at John to ensure that they would have a united front, even if it meant bending the truth a bit.
"No, that's fine. That's perfect. Thank you, Molly. I'll let you know what's going on, and if I can't get there by seven, you can bring her here. Any later than that and she'll start to get cranky."
Sherlock growled his displeasure. While it would be comforting to think that someone would have noticed if Moriarty had left Gemma for dead yesterday, he knew that it was just as likely that no one had bothered to check her office if she hadn't appeared this morning. He reined in his too-detailed imagination and started down the hallway. "Check them all," he barked at Sally and the two police officers with her, waving a hand at the closed doors that lined the hallway.
“Oh. You mean....” John shook his head, not in denial but because he had no idea what to say. "I think—I think that's up to you. I'm willing to do anything you want. That's always been true, for anything. This isn't any different."
John froze, thinking that Sherlock had changed his mind, but Eurus interrupted.
He shut off the phone and tossed it across the bed. For a brief, awkward moment, he thought Mycroft was going to touch him in an attempt at comfort, but he didn't; instead he slipped off the bed to stand next to it. Sherlock exhaled and returned his thoughts to the video. "Have you reviewed the footage from your other cameras to see how he might have got into your house? Or do you think he had someone else plant it there?"
"My gift. I didn't mean for John to—I thought one of the patrol officers who were on their feet all day might like it."
"Oh, hello," John said, grinning back at him. He couldn't say he was surprised to find Sherlock naked, given that they were on their honeymoon—he would not call it a sex holiday no matter what Sherlock said—but when he'd gone in to have a shower, Sherlock hadn't even been in the suite.
Sherlock nodded, lips pinched tight. "Were that the case, I would bring Mycroft in. He has far more resources than Anderson and the Homeless Network. I think between the two of us, we could find her. Eventually."
"But you went through their computer with all their financial records and didn't see any connection, right?"
"No, I have to work tomorrow." John yawned and shoved at Sherlock's chest until he rolled off him again. "I need to get some sleep."
"I didn't," Sherlock repeated, and held John's stare.
John shook his head. "Just 'we regret to inform you that you have not been chosen for participation...very rigorous selection process...blah, blah'." He tossed the letter onto the coffee table and pushed Stone's nose away from the tray of scones. "Come on, boy. Let's go get a bone."
"He's your family now, too."
"We'll bring them down, Greg," John said. "We'll go home and get the fingers, then stop and get coffee and something to eat, yeah?" He gave Sherlock a look that indicated he was sympathetic but would hear no arguing.
"I know."
"You're moving a little stiffly."
The reminder of the article from Moriarty sent a new wave of fear coursing through him. He tightened his hands on the arms of Gemma's chair and hoped John didn't press him on the topic.
He put his tea back down and plucked the paper from her hands, deducing that the quickest way to get her to stop bothering him would be to humor her. "What am I looking for?"
He picked up a tea towel to dry his hands, but before he could make it out of the kitchen, Sherlock dashed from the bedroom into the living room and cracked open the door to the landing. "Mummy, be quiet!" he hissed, his voice low but impassioned. "You're going to wake the baby. She's supposed to be sleeping in increments of two to four hours, but she can't do that if people are shouting in the hallway."
"I have no idea what that means, but a glass of wine would be wonderful. Thank you."
"I don't know. She got here about thirty minutes ago. I can go ask—I put her in my bedroom. I'm going to need to buy a new mattress, aren't I?"
He paused again at the top of the stairs, then rapped on the door, turning the knob at the same time. "Sherlock?"
Mycroft needed to know; he'd spent the better part of the last year trying to find Eurus, without ever getting a single lead, as far as John knew. "He—"
"But." He raised the card a few inches higher between them; John was still holding his wrist. "I need you to know how I feel, too. I could have made you a card." He was repeating himself, he knew. He glanced down at the card, at the careful and intricate pencil work John had done. "In fact, this looks almost exactly like something I would have made myself."
"I should've brought your crutches and—"
"Yep. Grilled chicken with lettuce and tomato, a bit of carrot, radish and onion. Want some mayo on it?"
“Or maybe he got hit by a car and has been lying injured in a ditch for the past half-hour,” Mrs. Hudson added.
"Nicholas.... He's my age. There's no way he has a daughter old enough to be getting married."
"I'll do all the work. You focus on solving the case."
"Come on," John repeated, though his voice was softer now. Sherlock didn't especially like his soft voice, because it meant John thought he was fragile, but he knew he deserved it right now. He just hoped Donovan didn't come out of the building before he was able to pull himself together. He closed his eyes and squeezed his hands into fists, trying to keep the panic at bay.
"Not really. Sorry." John slowly made his way back and forth across the room, paying extra attention to how he placed his crutches as he moved from the carpet to the hardwood floor and back again. "Stop staring at me. I'm not going to fall."
"No. But I just don't care at the moment." Even the last traces of the panic he'd felt when he'd feared John had been caught in an explosion this morning were gone. He reached down and grabbed John's hand, pulling it towards him so both their arms rested on his chest. "It's a brilliant feeling."
"They both come from big families, looks like. No kids of their own, bunch of nieces and nephews."
"I know. I have held a baby before."
My understanding of the current situation in England is that children of essential workers, including doctors, can still go to school in-person, but I assume John and Sherlock would rather keep Rosie at home.
"Oh, yes. Well, you two refused to put a wedding announcement in the newspaper, but then you posted this picture on the blog after your honeymoon, so I thought that would do, instead. Still would've liked to have an official announcement." She turned another page. "Didn't really get a wedding, either," she added under her breath.
"I understand. Um." Molly turned her head and looked down the street. "That man in the black suit at the corner? When we got out of the cab, he asked me where I was going and how I knew Sherlock. I thought he was going to want to see ID, like I was at a club, but then he let me go. I think he had a camera in his sunglasses."
"Yeah. Keep going. It's perfect, just like that." He pushed himself back more firmly against Sherlock's body, and Sherlock felt himself begin to lose the rhythm that they held.
"Is it? How do you know?" John looked at Mycroft, who was leaning back on the sofa, carefully holding a scone in one hand.
John had spent many a restless night since he'd become a single father, but this was the first time in years that he'd lain awake here at Baker Street. On the few occasions he had spent the night here recently, Rosie had been with him, and he'd slept soundly knowing she was in the cot at his side while Sherlock roamed the flat beneath them. This time, he was alone in his old bedroom, straining his ears for any hint of what might be happening in the rooms below. He found himself wishing once again for the gun he no longer had, more for peace of mind than because he thought Eurus was actually going to climb the stairs and attack him while he slept.
"I understand that. I want you to be safe, too, but we're better off if we stick together." He paused, then continued. "And, Sherlock? Me getting paralysed wasn't your fault."
He could use the railing in the stairwell for support, though, and once they were down the stairs he knew John would let him sit on his lap.
"Maybe she's just on her lunch break," John suggested.
"Touché, Dr. Watson." Eurus cackled, the sound turning into a grunt of pain as another contraction hit.
John watched her as she waved her arms and legs, not really able to interact with the toys attached to the swing, but clearly engaged by them all the same. With a bit of pale afternoon sunlight coming in through the window behind her, he noticed something he hadn't seen before. He got up from his chair and knelt on the floor next to the swing so he could take a closer look. "I think she might have a touch of jaundice, Sherlock. She looks a bit yellow here in the natural light." He sat back on his heels and made a silly face at Eve.
"Oh, well." Mrs. Holmes waved a hand, the same dismissive motion Sherlock had made in regards to Rosie's baptism. "That was years ago. If Mary were here right now, I'd give her a good chewing out, but since she's not...." She sighed and looked at John for a moment before continuing. "Sherlock, you be sure to take good care of yourself. John doesn't want to lose another partner."
Dad set the tray down on the desk and crossed to stand next to Sherlock by the fireplace. "Need some help getting it going?"
"Hang on," John said, and started to turn as well.
"When did you know about this, Sherlock? This...pregnancy. Had she been in contact with you before yesterday?" Even as he interrogated Sherlock, Mycroft continued to pound out texts on his phone.
"You haven't been—it's not—Sherlock, calm down."
"Between four and seven p.m. yesterday, my household surveillance footage shows nothing but a loop that had been recorded earlier in the day. I was out of the house at the time, first at work and then chauffeuring you and John about town. Someone must have entered the building and planted the rogue camera during that time frame." Mycroft straightened the sleeves of his jacket but Sherlock saw the shiver that the motion was meant to hide.
"Oh, I'm sure you are, Mr. Watson. You'll be up on your feet again in no time."
"True." Sherlock grinned even more. "Okay. I have a plan. Once you're ready to go, I'll go out into the hallway alone."
"If our genetic legacy is so questionable, brother dear, then you can't be suggesting that we allow someone else to raise her. They wouldn't have a chance. I'm her best hope."
John exhaled heavily at the impact. "A little warning next time."
"It's all right." John shifted Eve to one arm and carefully stood, stepping around the glider's footstool so he could put her back down in her cot.
Sherlock nodded, his eyes blinking closed for a moment. "I want it all, John. You know that. I never do anything halfway."
(See the end of the chapter for

"No, you just think you have to stay home with me, but you really don't."
"Understandable," Janine said. "She's a little beauty, though. And a lucky girl, if she gets to spend time in your arms."
"Oh, sorry," Sherlock said, when he saw John sitting in the room. "I didn't know she'd woken up, or I would've taken care of her myself."
Eurus shook her head, then spread her legs and blinked up at him. "Will you need to examine me again today, Dr. Watson?" She was wearing a pair of very baggy boxer shorts beneath Sherlock's much-too-large dressing gown and holding Eve against her chest, yet she somehow made it sound like one of the filthiest come-ons John had ever had directed at him.
When he didn't, John went on. "Okay, yeah. A plug. I could take it out, or I could leave it in and just tease you more with it, tipping it up so it rubs on your prostate while your cock is back in my mouth. I'm sucking harder now, swallowing you down and moving that plug, pulling it out just a bit, then back in, same rhythm as my mouth. Sherlock."
"Mm-hmm. A couple of times. I turned off my ringer. I reckoned he was your problem to deal with."
"Why is it ridiculous? Hm?"
"Okay." Molly tried not to react to the fact that Rosie preferred the store-bought to the ones she had made herself. She stood up, then bent to give her a quick hug. "I'm sorry none of your dates worked out tonight. How did you even come up with the idea to bring three people all at once?"
Sherlock bounded up from his chair and across the room. "Eurus has just had a baby, Mrs. Hudson. They both need their rest. Come on, let's get you back downstairs." He wrapped an arm around her shoulders and tried to guide her towards the door.
"Oh, I see." Zoe looked relieved. "That makes more sense, since I know it's just you. I mean, you aren't married or anything. Sorry. Anyway, she was good today. Except she didn't fall asleep during nap time. She was looking at books quietly, but she just never went to sleep. She should go to bed early for you, I'm sure."
"Okay." He glanced up the stairs and debated what to tell her now. Though he expected this conversation would be less uncomfortable than the one he'd just had with Molly, he didn't want to have it here in the stairwell, especially without Sherlock at his side. "He was, erm, about to nap when I left to get Rosie."
John stepped back into the living room in time to see Mrs. Holmes standing at the door, facing Mycroft, who looked like a cornered fox that had been surprised by the hounds and was momentarily too startled to run.
"I want to hold her now." Eurus lifted her arms into the air, staring past Sherlock at the baby on John's shoulder—Eve. Her name was Eve.
She shook free of his embrace. "No, your sister is the one who blew up my kitchen! And this flat!" She managed to add a full complement of hissing venom to the words while keeping them low enough so as not to disturb Eve.
"Well. Even if she did read the tag, the name won't mean anything to her."
Sorry for the long wait--I am trying not to pressure myself with this story, but I also got distracted and wrote
"Yes, 8 to 4, just like every Monday."
"No, it's fine. They did give me ibuprofen. Probably could've used a muscle relaxer, but it's okay."
"I've got a problem." Rosie pulled a chair out from the desk by the window and dragged it over to sit in between John and Sherlock in front of the fireplace.
"What? I don't know...not really." He could feel that the muscles were tight, now that he thought about it, but it hadn't been consciously bothering him.
"You knew about the LEGOs."
"She's almost seven and you know very well that she can read." John took a step closer, forcing Mycroft to back up against the worktop.
"Whoa, stop right there." John raised both hands. "How could you possibly know that? She tell you about that, too?"
"It's been a nightmare from the beginning. Come on."
John put his head back down on the pillow. "I don't even know why I was so angry. Usually I can control myself, but I was so upset, and then when I realised you wouldn't hit me back, it got even worse—"
We'll be going back to that first year that John and Sherlock get together after this chapter. I needed some time to finish up
"I understand, John. We'll have to agree to disagree on matters of Eurus."
Sherlock's grin shifted into something more real, although he suspected the only reason she was taking their side was so she could disagree with Mummy.
"Consider yourself lucky to have a grandchild at all, Mummy."
Sherlock sat, staring at the screen, but no more messages came. The possibility of replying flitted through his mind, but even if he'd known what to say, he didn't want to give Moriarty the satisfaction. It was bad enough that he would have already seen that all his messages had been read.
Thank you once more to my 2 betas,
"No, it's not. I mean, obviously, it is, but...." He took a deep breath and smoothed his hands down the front of his dressing gown as John tried and failed not to stare at his fingers. "My instinct is to let you leave and never speak of this again, but that's not going to get me what I want."
"Me? Molly will get it. She just offered drinks. John wants some water, please!" he shouted into the kitchen.
"Well, I suppose you think you don't," she replied. "Considering how you chased away all three cleaning ladies I hired for you."
"Then I thought, perhaps Greg and Molly would be willing to take him for the two weeks—they like him, but I don't know if their cats would appreciate it. Though I doubt Stone would know enough to chase a cat. He would also love it if we sent him to the country and he got to spend the time at Mummy and Daddy's, but again, how do we be sure he's not carrying germs to them? I don't want my dog to accidentally kill my parents, John."
John held up both his hands in a gesture of mollification, then noticed that her toes had remnants of varnish on the nails. Bright pink, chipped and halfway grown out, but definitely there. Of course, she probably would have had a hard time reaching her own toes to clean it off or touch it up for the last month or so. But before that she'd painted them or gone for a pedicure. Not something he would have expected of her. Why would she have bothered? She'd been on the run for ages, presumably alone. No one would have seen it. He glanced at her hands, curled into fists on her knees at the moment, but there was no varnish visible on her fingernails. Had she worn it when she'd pretended to be his therapist or the redhead he'd seen on the bus?
They watched as John left the library and headed back the way he had come. He passed the chemist at 9:57, presumably on his way back to Mummy and Daddy’s house.
"Why would she do that?"
"Putting aside the fact that I didn't notice when she started to turn yellow right in front of me, the moment I was left alone with her, I wanted to get high. How can I possibly be a good father to her?"
John sat in front of the mirror, shirtless, wearing only a pair of sleeping shorts. He glanced over his shoulder when Sherlock opened the door, then picked up a tube of styling gel. "I hate having to use this before I go to bed, but it's the only way to keep my hair out of my eyes. I don't like smelling it all night, though." He wrinkled his nose and then spread a clump through his hair with his fingers before using a comb to arrange it off his forehead.
"Mm." They'd discussed this at great length already. Sherlock thought John would be accepted to the trial, since he met all the qualifications—age, health, level of injury—but he understood his reluctance.
Sherlock shifted Eve onto his right shoulder and glanced at his watch. "Soon. Oh, God. I changed my mind. Mycroft can't find out about her. You have to take her away before he gets here." He pulled Eve off his shoulder so abruptly that she blurted a sharp cry of surprise. "Go. Now. Hurry."
Lestrade scowled. "Can't you just magically deduce if he's in one of the buildings?"
They left through the kitchen door, over Mummy's lingering doubts and Mycroft's disapproval.
"No, no. Nothing like that." Sherlock pulled his legs up to his chest, wrapping his arms around them, and sighed. This wasn't something he'd really intended to ever talk to John about, but he didn't see a good way to get out of the conversation now. "I can't because. Because I think about you when I do it, obviously." He sighed again. "And sometimes, when I get far enough along, I lose control of my thoughts and I...I picture you doing things you can't do anymore."
John dropped all her purchases off in her flat and headed upstairs, thinking about how much he needed to sit down, put his feet up and have a nice cup of tea after spending four hours out in the shops. He knew to brace himself as he opened the door to the flat, but for once his imagination had created a bigger mess than Rosie and Sherlock had. They had decorated, but the empty boxes had already been moved out of sight, presumably down into the storage in 221A. There were more lights strung around the living room than there had been last year, and the mirror over the fireplace was covered in snowflakes that Rosie had made in school. The overall effect was a that of a cozy, family-oriented Christmas, and John thought it all looked very nice.
"As you can clearly see from the logo on that shirt, he hasn't run one since 2007. And he's put on over a stone since then. That shirt does not fit him."
John stared at him, and Sherlock watched his thought process play out on his face. Yes, John was known to step up in times of crisis and draw upon his background as an army captain to get other people to listen to him, but the somewhat lesser-known legacy of his time in the military was that he sometimes just wanted to be told what to do. And Sherlock was more than happy to oblige. "I said, stand up and take off your trousers."
Sherlock grinned back at him and they reached for each other's hands as the lights went down and Rosie's school concert began.
"I don't want to, no. But—it's difficult to resist." He paused, and John could hear him take a shuddering breath before he went on. "Can you come? Now?"
Sherlock reached the door into the flat and pulled it open, startling the guard who was stationed at the bottom of the stairs.
"No, no. You have hours-old vomit on your trousers and more recent toddler-snot on your shirt. Take off all your clothes. I've drawn a warm bath already."
"Her hair is damp—did you give her a bath?"
Mycroft sighed. "I know you both believe you are capable of protecting yourselves, but, as I believe today's events have demonstrated, you are both mistaken."
Sherlock didn't move from where he sat. He was watching Eve, who was still in the swing, but rapidly becoming less enamoured of its music and motion and starting to fuss.
Mummy elbowed Mrs. Hudson out of the way so she could clear Sherlock's empty breakfast plate from the table. "He's your brother."
"What would be the point? If I'm dead, you won't be able to play with me anymore. You'll lose your chance to have me."
"He killed his own employees," Sherlock said, but he knew John was right. He'd killed his former employees, yes, but then he'd sent Sherlock their wedding rings. And he knew that Moriarty had chosen the poison he used on the Dreyers specifically because it was a paralytic—and then he'd called him and John so they would arrive in time to see its effect. And now that he was done going after the people who had worked for him, it seemed he had turned his attention to Sherlock's own circle of acquaintances. "This is turning into a nightmare."
John took the gun from him, his shirt stretching across his chest as he put the holster on, which made Sherlock wish he could send everyone else out of the house and convince John to take off everything he was wearing but for the gun and holster.
She gave him a blank smile as if she didn't quite understand that but had been told that smiling was part of her job. He crossed his arms over his chest and leaned against the wall to stare at her as she uncovered the tray of food for John. "It's just soup and some bread, for now," she said. "But if you manage that, you can have something more tasty later."
John straightened up to face the camera again. "Okay, Eurus. You saw what you wanted to see, I assume. And you think you've won. But you didn't. We did. And you will never have what we have, because it's not something you can obtain through force. So it's over now, your game. It's time to let us go."
"Yes, and we're eligible for the newlywed special. I booked us for this afternoon."
They'd only made it halfway through the kitchen before Sherlock noticed the way John was moving, each push of his chair shorter than his usual smooth motions. "You all right?"
John was in the living room, reading something on his tablet, which he'd been cleaning with disinfecting wipes several times a day, even though Sherlock hadn't touched it. He looked up when Sherlock stepped into the room, and Sherlock reached into the right-hand pocket of his dressing gown and pulled out the dust mask he'd got from the kitchen. It didn't meet hospital standards, or John probably would've already stolen it for the clinic, but it would do for their purposes now. He stretched the elastic over his head and settled the mask in place on his face, adjusting his hair over the band in the back.
"Oh, Sherlock, good! I was hoping you'd be awake."
"I know, I know. That's fine. But things like meditation and exercise can also help sometimes."
"Yes." John seemed startled for only a moment, then his shoulders relaxed a fraction of an inch. "Oh, of course. You knew already. Did you see me making it, or was it something you deduced?"
"I thought we were past this, Sherlock. I really did. But you keep trying to coddle and protect me and I can't—I can't...." John lowered his head, hands clenching at his thighs.
Sherlock's Adam's apple bobbed once, and then Eurus's voice cut in overhead. "Oooo, I thought you would have opted for oral sex. Interesting. Is it because you don't want to meet each other's eyes?"
"What?" Dad said. "No. Moriarty wasn't in prison."
"True." John smiled and took a sip of his champagne. He hadn't had any in years—it tasted better than he recalled, and he realized he was conflating the memory with the sparkling apple juice they were served every year at Rosie’s school’s holiday party.
He went back into his bedroom and picked up his phone from where he'd left it to charge. He'd missed a text at some point, not from a number that he knew.
He could hear Sherlock moving through the flat, though after a few moments he turned his attention to making sure he had everything he would need to actually deliver the baby. He was all set—all there was for him to do was wait, while Eurus did the real work of enduring near-constant contractions.
"Don't."
"Shut up. I've just never played before. I've never played any ball-based sport." He reached out to thump John's arm before he had a chance to smirk.
"I know you know they're dating." John drummed his fingers lightly against Sherlock's forehead.
“I hope you’re watching, Sherlock! I was going to call you to make sure, but I threw Johnny’s phone out the window. It wouldn’t stop ringing!” Moriarty zoomed out so he was in the frame again. “I think I’m having more fun than Johnny is so far. I’d like to wake him up to play with him, but I’m afraid he’ll try to run away. Well, in a manner of speaking.” He giggled. “Oh, Sherlock! Did he run away from you? Is that why I found him all by himself in the middle of nowhere? He did seem upset when I picked him up.” He leaned towards the camera so his own face filled the entire screen. “Did you have a little lovers’ quarrel?”
"Mm." Sherlock didn't care in the least what Fletcher thought of him, and though the urge to defend John was strong, anything he said would just prolong his time here in this office. He was done with this tedious case. He turned and headed towards the door.
Mycroft took one step closer to the cot and peered down into it. Eve gave a particularly enthusiastic kick of her legs and began to cry—John didn't blame her. "You're certain this is Eurus's child?" Mycroft asked. "Not some prank she's playing on you?"
Didn't expect to go smutty so soon this month, but here you go. Obviously, we have jumped ahead a few years in the timeline.
"You knew John and I were going to get together? How on earth could you possibly have known that?"
Sherlock drew the plastic bag containing the fingers and wedding rings from his coat pocket. "I wasn't about to hand these over without making sure they were properly logged in as evidence in the case."
Sherlock settled himself as comfortably as he could—there was a stack of file folders a few inches from his left thigh and an empty coffee mug to his right, but otherwise Lestrade's desk was fairly empty. He let John undo his flies and pushed the waistband of his trousers and pants down as far as he could. He didn't have many limits, but letting his bare arse touch Lestrade's desk was apparently one of them.
"Snowfakes!" Rosie yelled. "Snowfakes! Cold!"
Nice, but unusual. John had never been one to cuddle in his sleep. He still wasn't one to cuddle in his sleep, and the fact that he had wrapped himself around Sherlock suggested a concerted effort to do so: it wasn't as if he rolled around in his sleep these days. He couldn't turn from his back all the way onto his side without waking up at least partway to drag his legs into position. Sherlock twitched his own foot back to check—yes, John's legs were tucked neatly behind his, his feet uncomfortably cold even though the rest of him was warm. He must have woken up, then felt the need to move closer to Sherlock despite his preference to sleep unentwined. And Sherlock knew of only one reason why he would make the effort to do that.
Once they arrived at the hospital, John was immediately ushered into a private room, and an armed guard stationed at the door. Sherlock stayed with him, watching as he slowly woke up while a doctor and several nurses took blood and monitored his vitals and started him on bags of IV fluids. An eternity passed before they were satisfied with his progress. Finally, the last nurse left the room, leaving Sherlock and John alone together as she closed the door behind her.
"All right. So we won't ever do anything like that in public again."
"I will."  John ended the call. Fuck. What had he just agreed to? He shoved his phone into his pocket and exhaled. Across the room, Rosie glanced up from her animals and he forced himself to smile at her. "Hey, sweetie, grab Mr. Bear and come upstairs with me to get your shoes on. We're going out for a little while."
"I don't know. I was just surprised to see you show up. And alone. Is John all right?"
John clicked on the small lamp and Sherlock dropped down on the bed. "If you're sore, you really don't have to—"
When he'd ended the call, Sherlock sat up again and tried to make himself appear to be in more cheerful mood. "You should go to practice."
"He was very interested in your chest, for some reason. Let's just say you don't need to worry about Mummy finding out about your piercing anymore."
John made a noise of protest as Sherlock shrugged and turned his back on the two of them.
"Hugs!" Rosie declared, and John wrapped his arms around her for a moment, and planted another kiss on top of her head.
"I've already fired my household staff. I trust my driver, and he was with me yesterday when the cameras were tampered with. The four guards that I chose to rotate between here, Barts and John's office can all be vouched for—they were undergoing a final background check at the Home Office yesterday. I have Anthea working right now to find me a new housekeeper, cook and gardener, but I don't plan to hire anyone until Moriarty is caught." Mycroft turned away from Sherlock and began to pace back and forth between the bed and the door.
"What are you—you've been training him?" John watched as Stone got up and moved to lie in front of the window.
He called his name again and Lestrade stuck his head out from one of the bedrooms. "Oi, stop yelling. He left."
She'd only started watching one program when she caught a movement out of the corner of her eye and looked up to see the door to the flat open and a woman with long dark hair step through into the living room.
"I know," Sherlock said softly. "I know."
"I've always been concerned about you, little brother. And thank you, I would like a cup of tea." The kettle clicked off, punctuating Mycroft's statement.
"There is," Sherlock said. He shook free of John's grip and crossed the room, pushing past Mycroft to reach the coat rack so he could pull a set of car keys from his coat pocket. "Return the blue Passat that's parked down the street to the Smithfield Car Park at Barts. Please."
Everything was ready; everything was done. The gifts were wrapped, the cards were mailed, the flat was decorated, Rosie was asleep and tomorrow they would drive to Gram and Grandad's after they spent a leisurely morning here together. Well, as leisurely as Christmas morning with a toddler was likely to be.
"No, you'll be Grandad. I'll be Papa. Rosie and I have already discussed it."
"So," Sherlock said. "Your nurse was Moriarty's secret agent and neither of us noticed for years. That was quite a surprise, wasn't it? Fancy ordering something for dinner?"
Sherlock was silent for the space of three heartbeats, watching her, thinking. "What if I'm wrong?"
"Okay," Sherlock said. "Two hours."
"I'm not afraid of you," he said, and clasped his hands behind his back, pretending that he believed what he'd said. At least he didn't think she could physically overpower him right now, and she no longer had a prison full of guards to do her bidding. He cleared his throat. He was Dr. Watson, again. "How are you feeling?"
"If you'd asked me this morning, I would have told you I didn't need to be on it anymore. But the way I've felt today...." Sherlock shook his head, then squirmed to push down the covers so John could get into bed next to him.
"If you say so." And sure enough, when John went downstairs and opened the door to the street, he found Rosie practically hanging from the knob on the other side.
—but John didn't seem to mind. Sherlock tried to go into his Mind Palace and see if he could predict Moriarty's next move, but he found himself starting to drift away, though he'd slept well last night and had no reason to be tired.
"Oh, that's a work text." John slipped his hands out of Sherlock's shirt. "Can you go grab my phone for me?"
John nodded, following Sherlock's gaze around the property. "I think it's doable." He nodded at the wall behind Sherlock. "I mean, a decorative stone wall doesn't offer much protection, but the house is in a good location. If he brings in more guards than just Leon, it shouldn't be too hard to protect your parents and Mrs. Hudson."
"Yes."
Sherlock sighed. "I'm not suggesting you shoot my brother, as cathartic as that might be." He turned and walked out of the kitchen, back into their temporary bedroom. John's gun was still in its holster, though he'd stowed it in one of their travel bags overnight. Sherlock checked that it was loaded and the safety was on, then brought it back into the kitchen. Mummy flinched back a bit at the sight, though Mrs. Hudson barely reacted. He handed the gun to John. "I just thought everyone would be more comfortable if we took sensible precautions when we take Stone outside."
"I know," John said, and then looked again at what Sherlock was doing. "You know, I'm sure we have adult-sized scissors in this flat somewhere."
"Me neither," Sherlock said, and turned away, looking around the room. "Where's Mycroft? Mycroft!" he shouted.
He waved a hand at her. "I have people to deliver them for me." Rosie and her friends, plus a few of his more trustworthy homeless network members. "Now hurry up and leave so you have time to do your shopping. Those toys aren't going to buy themselves, and I know you wouldn't want to disappoint a bunch of poor children at Christmas."
Sure enough, a few seconds later, Sherlock lifted his head away from the wall, though he didn't turn to look at John. Instead, he began to fiddle with the tie of his dressing gown, wrapping it around his fingers and then releasing it as he spoke. "I wasn't expecting this. This...longing. I thought I'd be too busy. And I was. Yesterday was awful. I could take care of Eve, or I could deal with my mother, but I couldn't do both at once. Every time I turned around, Mummy was there, or Mrs. Hudson, telling me to let Eve cry, or to pick her up, or that I should be using cloth nappies or I was feeding her too often or not often enough. I thought, when I finally got Mummy to leave and Mrs. Hudson to leave me alone, it would all be okay. But it wasn't."
As he leaned forward to check her, he was all too aware of how close her feet were to his head, and had to remind himself that if she'd wanted to kill him, there would have been much easier ways to arrange it than getting pregnant and then waiting nine months so she could kick him to death. And she'd shown no signs of refusing to cooperate with him so far, agreeing to his examination without protest. "Okay, it looks like you're at about eight centimetres already. It won't be too much longer. I see the baby's head pressed against the opening just like it should be. Everything looks good."
"Nope, sorry, Sherlock," John said. "I already put my braces and crutches in Sally's car, so looks like you're stuck with her, unless you want to take a cab by yourself."
Sherlock took two running strides across the room, catching himself on the back of the chair at the desk, his own mobile clattering to the floor. He leaned forward towards the phone. "Moriarty."
"It wasn't great." Sherlock sat up and repositioned his foot on the pillows so the ice would rest against the correct part of his ankle.
"You've never complained before."
Sherlock looked at him and opened his mouth, then closed it. He looked down at Eve, who had found the collar of his shirt and was sucking enthusiastically on it. A heartbeat later, he said, "That was more than a year ago. Things in her life have obviously changed."
"We should do that more often," John said.
Molly giggled. "Sherlock says Mycroft's afraid of their mother. He probably didn't want to upset her."
"Is she any good?"
Sherlock looked down at the ground between him and John. "You're the one who's in the saving people's lives business."
John's tongue darted out from between his lips. "Why?"
"Your favorite potatoes," he told her, leaving out the details of the rest of the meal.
"No. I know. But it what it is. Come here." He pulled on Sherlock's arm, and Sherlock let himself be tipped over towards him, realising a moment too late that John hadn't wiped his stomach and chest off yet.
"I've got it." Sherlock slid off his stool and crossed to stand in front of Rosie, his back to John. He slipped his wallet from his pocket. "You remember the PIN?" he asked, as he held out his card to her.
Sherlock swallowed, realising that Mrs. Hudson was still in the next room and able to hear their bickering. He wasn't supposed to talk about John's bodily functions in front of others, but it was too late now, and she'd certainly shared more personal details than that herself. "You know what I mean." He twirled a hand in front of his own stomach, then flung his fingers outwards to point at John. "Fine. Make me a sandwich if you're so worried."
John returned to the bedroom, the anxiety he'd felt when he'd first arrived today now almost completely gone. He'd spent an hour alone in a room with Eurus and survived. Delivering a baby seemed easy in comparison.
"Yeah. Yeah, I can come." He stood up, sending his office chair rolling backward, and bent down to grab his work satchel from where it sat beneath his desk. "I'm leaving now, Sherlock, all right? Just—hang on. I'll be there as soon as I can."
"Let me see." John craned his neck and Sherlock tapped on the screen to enlarge it and then tilted the phone towards him. A well-maintained, semi-detached house filled the screen, the edges of neighbouring homes just visible to either side.
"Yes, I did. It's—it's a long story." She glanced back over her shoulder, at Sherlock, who was still standing in the doorway.
—too young. Also, unsure if I'm pleased or upset with her first effort at matchmaking
He'd done plenty of things that weren't right, but he didn't need Eurus to hear his confession about any of that. God knew he'd already told her enough while she was pretending to be his therapist.
article Moriarty had sent. He folded it up again and stuffed it back into the envelope it had arrived in.
"Not too interesting, though."
"No."
"John, ignore what she says. Just help her." Sherlock strode around the bed to stand on the far side, across from John. "She talks a lot—I think she can't help herself. Earlier she said that I was nicer than anyone she'd ever met, then a minute later she was screaming, asking why I hadn't tried to find her earlier. I don't think she even—"
"I would never—" Mrs. Hudson began, gesturing with the chef's knife she had been washing in the sink.
"I don't know. Could be any number of reasons. You want to go ask one of her co-workers?"
They weren't as strong as John—they wouldn't be able to handle being kidnapped as well as he had. No. This had to end. Sherlock was going to put a stop to it now.
Unfortunately I've discovered that my writing style and speed means any smutty ficlets are likely to be mostly dialogue and end before the action happens. If we followed them into the bedroom, there would be another 2000 words and I can't do that on a daily basis. You'll have to just imagine the rest. :)
"Sherlock?"
"Oh, I'd forgotten that you're now an expert on child development, Sherlock." Mrs. Holmes widened her eyes at him, making the family resemblance between them even more apparent than it normally was.
John swallowed and quickly looked down at his hands, folded in his lap, before shaking his head.
He spent the next hour alternating between cutting chunks of cardboard off the box following Rosie's specifications and helping put together the glider, until Sherlock finally tossed down the Allen key in frustration, not with the construction of the chair, which was not particularly difficult, but with his mother and Mrs. Hudson.
"Oh, hang on, that's Wiggins," Sherlock said, pulling his phone from his pocket in response to a faint buzz which sounded to John like the same tone he used for nearly everyone he texted. "He's just down the street. I'll go meet him downstairs. Don't really fancy him meeting Eurus right now."
"Anderson, you—" Sherlock began, and John elbowed him in the side. Sherlock glared at him—
"What? What is it? Explain it to me. Because it sounds like this is just like you not wanting me to play basketball, because you're afraid I'll get hurt. Come on. I thought we were past that, Sherlock."
"I'm already clean." Sherlock edged away from John so that he could open his gown, showing the fresh pyjamas he wore beneath it. "Now take off your pants and vest and get into that tub."
"Yes, I—wait." Sherlock brought a hand up to his chin and wrinkled his brow. "You like this look, don't you? Why?"
"So, we only do that at night." He waggled his fingers between the two of them at the word 'that.'
He shook his head to clear Moriarty's voice from his mind before heading into the bathroom for a quick shower. He gave his hair the minimum amount of attention it needed for him to appear in public, and picked out clothes that were presentable but not his best. A suit that wasn't new and a plain white shirt, not one of the darker colours that John was so fond of seeing him wear. Shoes and socks and of course his coat. He pulled it closed around himself, though it was a pleasant enough day outside.
"You didn't tell me you were heroes!" Mummy said, giving John's shoulder a squeeze.
John bent to catch Rosie before she could throw her arms around his legs and carried her through the living room and into the kitchen. He set her on the step stool in front of the sink and helped her clean the pizza off her hands and face. Molly followed them into the kitchen but didn't say anything else about him and Sherlock, and John was grateful to have that awkward conversation over.
, the leg braces mentioned here appear in
“Let. Him. Go,” Sherlock snarled at the telly, caught between embarrassment and a helpless rage.
"Yes-yes-yes!" She released her grip on John's arm and let herself fall into Sherlock's waiting hands.
Sherlock stepped closer to the bed, still holding the baby, looking much more natural than he had when he'd first held Rosie. "She's all right," he said, nodding at Eurus. "Give her some time. She needs to process everything that's happened."
"Sit," John told her, pointing to the chair. "Wait."
"Oh, so Aunt Eurus was guilty at her trial."
Sherlock inhaled before he could stop himself. John should know better than to be so sappy in front of...well, he supposed it was fine if Mrs. Hudson saw. He brushed his hand over John's and then reached to relieve Mrs. Hudson of Rosie, who had begun to squirm.
Sherlock saw Mycroft's lips twist in disapproval, so he closed his eyes again and let himself slip into a light Mind Palace trance, even though he didn't have anything he really wanted to focus on at the moment. He'd given up trying to figure out Moriarty's next move. The man had gone from killing his former employees to researching the side effects of Sherlock's medications—clearly, he was impossible to predict. There was nothing to be done except wait to see what he decided to do next, as frustrating as that was to admit.
"It does matter! The old Johnny would be climbing up those stairs right now to rescue you, wouldn't he? Who's going to rescue you now, hmm, Sherlock?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sh'wock!" Rosie announced, and threw herself into his arms. He tried to lower her to the floor—she could certainly walk when she wanted to—but she wrapped her small arms around his neck, her head butting against his chin. "Sh'wock," she said again, more softly this time, and he exhaled against her hair. Maybe having the photo appear in the newspaper wasn't the worst thing that could happen. Rosie might enjoy having a copy of it when she was older. As long as the general public didn't start to believe that nonsense that said he had a softer side.
Sherlock put his phone face down on the table and sighed in frustration.
John nodded against him, tickling Sherlock's nose with his hair. After a few moments, he loosened his grip and wiped at his eyes with the sleeve of his coat. He sniffed once and cleared his throat. "We should, ah, stop downstairs and get your ankle looked at," he said, not meeting Sherlock's eyes.
"Yes. Thank you."
"Oops," Mycroft said, raising one hand to his mouth. "Did you forget to tell Mummy who shot you, Sherlock?"
John laughed, dropping his hand. The worry in his face had smoothed away. "I know it does. That's how I knew you would like it." He stepped closer, leaving only a few inches of space between their bodies. "But I don't need a card from you. There's really only one thing I want right now, if you're willing."
"Oh, Rosie, you're much too big for that," John said. "It's only for little babies who can't even sit up yet."
John closed his eyes for a moment. They were never going to agree, and John himself was never going to believe that Eurus should be allowed to remain free. Sherlock's agreement to try to catch her if she killed again was likely the best he could hope for, and it would have to suffice. "Just to be clear, are you promising me that if you discover that Eurus has killed again, you will tell Mycroft so the two of you can work together to put her back in Sherrinford?"
Sherlock sat up reluctantly so Mycroft and Mummy could share the sofa with him as they watched the CCTV footage from the past hour. A camera stationed in front of Barkley’s chemist gave a clear view of anyone coming into town along Ridge Street. At precisely 9:42, John passed by the chemist, continuing towards the centre of town. Mycroft switched to another camera, and they tracked John as he made his way along the pavement.
After a few minutes of exploration, John stood up to take off his trousers, and Sherlock squirmed out of his, revealing a lack of pants that did not surprise John in the least. He would have been surprised at the size of his cock, if he hadn't already had a look at it a little while ago.
"Yes, well." Mycroft held his gaze, making it clear what he thought about that. "I do assume young Miss Rosamund will be somewhat easier to rear to adulthood, given that the Watson-erm, Morstan gene pool must be at least slightly more stable than that of the Holmes family."
She was, however, holding a folded-up newspaper, one of the gossip tabloids that she enjoyed so much; she was clutching it to her chest, as if hugging it. "Now, I know what you're probably going to say when you see this, but there's just the most precious photograph in today's paper."
"Apparently, I had suppressed a few more of my childhood memories."
"She's not stinky. She just got a new nappy."
"That was almost a year ago and also not a pizza."
"Well, you could share the bed with John, I suppose," Mummy said. "As long as he doesn't mind and neither one of you is a sprawler."
"I—I watched you." He hadn't realised that John didn't remember waking up, and so didn't even know that Moriarty had been filming him. "He made a video of it—we all saw it."
"Rosamundio!" Grandad unwound the string of lights and draped it over the foot of her bed frame. "Here you go, Miss Rosaboo. Some lights just for you." He handed her the battery-powered remote that controlled them. "If it's too bright, you can turn them off, then if you get scared you can turn them right back on again."
Rosie sighed again, but only because she didn't want them to know that she still loved doing things like this with them. She walked across the room and sat down on the edge of the rug, next to Sherlock, who handed her the blanket. She draped it evenly over her shoulders, so there would be room for both Sherlock and Dad to join her beneath it. Dad carried the hot chocolate and biscuits over and set them down in front of her, and they all sat by the fire together until they had warmed up from being out in the snow.
She giggled and then stuck the newspaper in front of him. "Go on, take it."
"I'm going to check on Eurus."
"I discovered something." Sherlock clapped his hands together and John would have bet money that he was going to say he'd uncovered a murder in the hotel, except Sherlock tended not to get naked for cases that involved other people. He would have at least worn a sheet.
John grabbed the shirt, scowling at Sherlock's tone, and shook it out. One of Sherlock's expensive tailored shirts, and in the deep, rich color that always made John's gaze linger, because it looked so good against Sherlock's skin. "I wasn't going to wander about shirtless. I was just going to go up to my room and get my own clothes to wear."
"Apparently." Sherlock shrugged. "We should be grateful, because if she went out for dog supplies then maybe she got some food for us, too. Biscuits, I hope."
John leaned into the kiss for just a moment, then pulled away, feeling himself blush at the idea that they had just kissed for an audience. Rosie didn't seem to notice at all, but Mrs. Hudson uttered a small squeal.
"You are such a romantic, John Watson," Sherlock said, and slithered out of his pants while still beneath the sheet.
John was either still upset with him, or else he was in danger. Either way, it was Sherlock’s fault. He made himself cut off that line of thought; there would be plenty of time to let himself spiral with guilt once John was back home. He swung his feet off the sofa. “I’m going out to find him.”
His feet slipped in the mud and he fell, catching himself on his hands—better than sprawling full-body, but he would never reach Stone first now. He shouted at the two racing dogs to stop, putting as much command into his voice as he could, but the tone that tended to surprise people into listening had no effect on animals.
"Why wouldn't I, hmm, Sherlock? Why shouldn't I kill you now?"
"You're right, John. He's always snored when he sleeps on his back. Just like his father." Mrs. Holmes glanced from him to Sherlock and back again, looking a bit puzzled.
"Yes. No phones." Sherlock turned to face the door again, and reached into his pocket for his lock picks. "He won't mind if we let ourselves in."
John laughed. "It is, isn't it? You know, you don't always need me to make you feel that way."
"John."
Upon reflection, I don't think the door into the flat would be locked because Rosie's room is through that door and up the stairs but I'm not changing it now.
Moriarty laughed. "Ah, Sherlock. You sound so confident. But you just sent Johnny off to work by himself, didn't you? And then texted me. I think you've finally realised what you're missing."
Sherlock unbuckled Rosie from her car seat and helped her climb out to stand in the drive of his parents' house. There was a light dusting of snow on the grass and more in the air; she immediately began trying to catch some of it in her mouth.
"You could have just called to tell them about it. Or texted them."
Mrs. Holmes watched Sherlock pace back and forth a few times before speaking again. "You know, there have been times when I've wondered if it wasn't a mistake for me to ever have had children at all. The amount of heartache and destruction the three of you have caused." She sighed again. "But I know you've also done good in your lives, and made people happy, so I can't regret it, in the end. And I love you all dearly. I just wish Eurus were able to be here, too."
"No. We are not calling Mycroft. We can discuss it further in the morning. When Eurus is awake and rested. She should be able to have some say about her own future, don't you think?"
John didn't reply. He skimmed his fingers along the bare skin above the collar of Sherlock's t-shirt. "Do your shoulders hurt?"
Sherlock crossed the room to grab the knife that sat in its usual spot on top of the mantel. He returned to the table and began to slice the tape holding the box shut. "It's not from Eurus," he announced, before he even opened the flaps. "It's from Mycroft."
"Thank you for coming with me. I know...." Sherlock trailed off.
"Yeah. Tomorrow I'll start talking to Rosie about moving in here, get her used to the idea. We can get a rail for the bed, so she doesn't need to sleep in the travel cot, and get her excited about having her own room here, like she does at home. It might take a little while for her to adjust."
"I know. I've seen cranky Rosie. I'll get her back to you before that happens." She giggled. "Say hi to Sherlock for me, all right? I hope he's okay."
"Now, we've all made mistakes in our lives, haven't we, Mrs. Hudson?" Sherlock said. "You wouldn't like it if everyone you met held your past against you, would you?"
"Sherlock." John's hand was on his wrist. "Stop. You don't need to do any of those things."
"You don't want me to be someone else?" John sounded light-hearted, but Sherlock answered him seriously.
Once her contraction passed, he got her to lie down and sent Sherlock into the loo to fetch the blood pressure cuff and stethoscope. He was willing to spare him the sight of his sister's cervix for the time being, though he was likely to see more than he wanted to by the time this was over.
"Nothing to apologize for, Molly." He peered past her, trying to see if John was ready to leave yet.
"He'd planned to, but as he's currently lying on the sofa beneath multiple ice packs, I volunteered to do the job instead." Sherlock pulled off his mask and took a step towards her so she would back up and let him into the flat.
John scrambled down the steps, mind racing as he wondered what had been delivered. "Er, what is that?" he said, when he saw Sherlock standing just inside the door next to a cardboard box as tall as his chest and wider than his body. "Is Eurus hiding inside it?"
Sherlock nodded in agreement. "He's right. You need to lock this place down with Mummy and Daddy and Mrs. Hudson, and then we won't have to worry about him targeting them. But he's not going to stop pursuing me just because I'm here."
"What on earth are you talking about?"
"Oh, God, Sherlock." John laughed. "You went to Barts and spent all day with Molly, didn't you? Should I be jealous, too?"
"Well, I—" Mycroft began, but before he could blather on, Anthea slid her phone across the table, displaying a picture of the device that the drone had been carrying.
"Your personal history of leaving her mother locked in prison from childhood without a trial?"
"Hmm?"
"Okay." John stayed next to the sofa, watching him.
"Don't care." John's hands were in Sherlock's hair again, urging his head back towards his chest.
Sherlock doubted he would be hungry for Chinese after he met Moriarty, but she seemed eager and he didn't want her to keep thinking something was wrong with him. "Maybe. If I'm still around. And hungry then."
"That's probably something your parents should have explained to all three of you a long time ago."
