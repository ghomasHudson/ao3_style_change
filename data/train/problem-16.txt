She bent down to whisper in his ear, “Are you ready? Are you sure?”
One of the brutes tossed Watson’s overnight bag into the corner, and right after the thump of leather hitting wood came Holmes’ querulous voice, “You were leaving? Why were you leaving?”
“How can you even want me to?” Watson whispered, looking deeply down into his almost-empty mug.
His awareness returned with a jolt -- he was naked, sprawled across Sherlock, Jesus bloody Christ. John levered himself to his knees. Sherlock’s eyes were closed and his mouth open. Tears stood on his cheeks. His body was smeared with blood and… John  looked down at himself: bloodier, striped and smeared with ejaculate.
God what a drama queen. John felt himself grin, felt all the pieces of his heart not come together, but stop cutting him with their broken edges. The great master of deduction Sherlock Holmes thought John was a figment of his imagination. John would never let him live this down.
"I see. So the government plans to use him to find out about Perfect Matches?"
"How'd you know all that?" John asks the boy quietly.
“Thank you.”
"Andy said Soo Lin left recently, citing family issues though she has no family. We know a killer has been targeting members of a Chinese smuggling ring-"
“Eat this, and drink this, and go to bed,” Lestrade orders kindly. “I’ll text Sherlock and give him absolute h*ll for leaving you alone like this.”
"Hey Jim. Hi Mike. Hello John. You're a sight for sore eyes today." John halfway smiles, though it probably looks more like a grimace. "Your dad again?" Molly questions kindly. John nods.
"Sherlock, be nice. We're only here because of your brother, remember?"
"Just how closely are you working with the police?"
“And this is the number fifteen. We know that already, but what does it mean?” Sherlock questions.
Once I'm certain he's gone, I manage to somehow pull myself up and hobble over to see what he found. I read over his notes but can't find anything. In fact, it looks like he was just identifying different parts of the brain.
“F**k! Sherlock!” John’s voice trails off into a wordless scream.
"What happened?"
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "The question written in bright yellow on your card?"
"Oh, I normally just have tea and a pastry."
"Mmmm?" Lestrade questions wordlessly as he checks his computer to bring up whatever it is he wants Sherlock to look at.
"Mycroft, my brother. I need to see him."
"Hmmm?"
"And of course he declined, claiming some sort of international crisis."
Angelo pulls off John's shirt, and we all three gasp. Scars and ugly yellow bruises litter John's skin. The story of abuse is clearly written in his skin. I hear a low growl and look beside me. Sherlock's lips are pulled back into a snarl and his eyes are wild.
“Blue. It’s a safe color.” Seeing John’s confusion, he elaborates, “Blue is the color of the ocean I imagined when I was Bootstrap Bill playing pirates, and Father was away. Blue is the color of Mycroft’s eyes, and my mother’s too. Blue is the color of the sky outside, which was safer than inside. Blue is a safe color. My turn: how old are you?”
“I’m not going into heat.”
Sherlock shakes his head. "It wasn't rape," he argues. "I asked John to bond with me. He didn't do anything I didn't want; nothing was done that I didn't ask for, or even beg for."
Gregory frowns but doesn't answer Jim. I take this as my cue to speak. "So will you stay with us?"
"The violin. It helps me think. Sometimes I don't talk for days on end. Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other."
"I don't want my Father to have the satisfaction of keeping me from being happy." Mycroft says nothing, so I continue. "But I've pushed Sherlock away a lot the past few days. He might not want me, or he might be upset."
Dimmock stares at him, looking concerned. "John's not back yet, kid."
"I believe they're still downstairs unconscious."
"I've learned not to trust her," the man smirks. "Archer, on the count of three, shoot Dr. Watson in the head."
“No,” answers John quickly. “You?”
Sherlock holds up a hand imperiously, and John's questions putter to a stop. "Possibly, to hand-holding, no to kissing. Let me initiate PDA-no promises, I most likely won't be interested. Keep-it-behind-closed-doors is preferred; honestly no contact would be better. No to sex, and I'd prefer to avoid the bed situation due to the possibility of nighttime," Sherlock clears his throat awkwardly, "reactions on your part, though I'm fully willing to accept that that might not be possible for the next week."
Mycroft rolls his eyes, then launches into a spiel about whatever case he wants Sherlock to take. Sherlock ignores him completely. In the end, he attempts to leave the palace, citing a desire to keep his mysterious client out of his cases because he prefers mystery from only one side of his case. This seems to really make Mycroft grumpy, and he steps on Sherlock's sheet as he goes to walk away.
John's spine straightens with a jerk and he gasps, "Sherlock!" before he can stop himself.
"Gavin? Who's Gavin? I thought I was helping you propose to John?"
"I don't know the code," Sherlock replies.
"Let me see, John." His omega mother kneels next to him in the dirt, tenderly turning his face toward hers.
"Yes John, keep up. So, she goes missing. Obvious solution, she's the next one threatened and has vanished before she could be killed."
Entering the room, John is struck by how small his Omega looks. Asleep like this, he looks much younger. John gets him physically comfortable, lying the blanket over him and adjusting pillows until his head and hips are both propped at an acceptable level.
As soon as the taxi stops, Sherlock bolts from the taxi. Mrs. Hudson is on the stoop waiting for him, and he greets her joyously before turning to help Mycroft pull his mate from the car. He introduces John to Mrs. Hudson, though John’s eyes are glazed with morphine and Sherlock will be surprised if he remembers any of this later. Mrs. Hudson leads the way up to the flat, babbling on about how “There’s a second bedroom upstairs, as if you’ll be needing two bedrooms.”
After lots of careful consideration, Sherlock and I had decided we were going to bond. He wanted us to have the opportunity to get to know each other without feeling a sense of obligation, he had told me. But he didn't want to wait any longer to give me an equal partnership in our relationship. We also agreed we would be married, but probably not for several years yet-after I graduated college as a doctor, however long that will take.
Right at that moment, Mycroft’s computer chimes a conference call. Apparently Mycroft elected to have his computer always accept conference calls-an option which technically doesn’t exist-because Sherlock doesn’t get the chance to deny the call before Mycroft’s picture comes up on the screen and he is sighing in exasperation.
"No, I just tease him about Lestrade to pick on him. The CD was meant to be nice."
Sherlock froze. He realized he had never, not even mentally, referred to himself as the twins' Daddy before. He hadn't been sure what he had wanted to be called, only that he never wanted them to call him Father, as that was the moniker of the man who abused him. Apparently he wanted to go by Daddy, which was a bit of a surprise due to its childish sound, but he rather liked it. "John?"
Mycroft takes about two seconds to decide he doesn't want to get into this and simply shoots her a polite smile before he wanders off after his brother. Sherlock has made his way near the waiting room, and both brothers freeze and watch curiously as a doctor approaches a waiting family. A hushed conversation clearly reveals terrible news, as the family starts to cry. "Look at them!" Sherlock says. "Do you ever think there's something wrong with us?"
No response, but Sherlock's agitation is like a palpable thing.
Sherlock surges forward and kisses him chastely on the lips. “I love you.”
Mycroft nods, back still to his brother. "Sorry. I was just...curious."
Mycroft stares at him. "I'm only going to the bathroom, Brother Mine."
"Sit down, John."
"Mycroft is the name you gave me, if you could possibly struggle to the end. I'll be done in a moment, don't fret."
"Nonsense, I couldn't impose on you like that."
John takes the bottle and instantly realizes it's from a different country. "Mycroft, where are these from?"
"Why are you here?" Sherlock asks.
“The Freak took off and left you here, did he?” The woman from before is back, and John can’t say he’s glad to see her. He snarls a bit to make his displeasure known at the way she insults his mate. “He gets off on it, you know. The crime scene, the bodies. One day it won’t be enough. One day we’ll be standing around a body and Sherlock Holmes will be the one who put it there.”
"I- Just go get John. Please."
"Don't call me naïve!"
When the car finally stops, John stares in shock at Holmes Manor. Apparently his young mate is accustomed to a much better lifestyle than the one John can provide. 'Think about that later,' John chides his inner wolf. 'His father just died.'
"Did you want to talk?" John asks, breaking the silence.
"Wait a moment, 'A Study in Pink?' You read his blog?" he asks, indicating John with a sweep of his hand.
"Love you, Dad," I mumble into his neck. He freezes.
"John? Hey John?" I snap myself out of my reminiscing, looking at Greg curiously. Sherlock had sent me to work with him today, so he could set up our flat for me. We were bonding tonight, so he sent me with Greg to work so it could be a surprise for me, how the flat looked when it was set up. I was just trusting it would look nice, and praying there wouldn't be body parts on the counters right away.
"Jim?"
John grabs him, and Sherlock has enough time to quietly gasp, "John!" before John's lips descend frantically onto his.
John swats him as they head back into the house playfully. Sherlock chuckles, then stops as he considers what lies ahead. John turns around before they even make it into the flat. "Something wrong? I can feel your anxiety."
"Yes, yes, alright," Sherlock agrees again. He puts down his stack of books, kisses John's cheek lightly, and turns to go back to the books.
"Hey, Mr. Mycroft Holmes! Wait a minute!"
"Anytime, Sherlock, I mean it."
"Soon," replies John.
"Your house reeks of heat, John. Did you bond him?"
"Behave, Myc!" Mrs. Holmes chides, rolling a dish towel and smacking her son's rear with it.
He sits there for a moment longer, stroking Sherlock's hand as he allows the sound of their child's heartbeat to comfort him. They will be alright, the three of them, come what may. He will do whatever it takes to ensure it.
"Duly noted," John answers, bemused. "Are you threatening me?"
At the crime scene, they discover a woman who has been murdered and sliced completely open. Sherlock takes one look at the body and runs away. "Sherlock?" John calls after him in concern. The entire forensics team watches in shock as Sherlock vomits all over the sidewalk.
Sherlock sighs. "Such as?"
.............................................................
"Uncaring, never be a good Alpha," he shrugs, "all things I've been told over the years. I believed them too, John."
"For the baby shower, of course," she replies. "Do you prefer a shower before or after the children come?"
"Yes." John levels a look at him. "I am!" Sherlock insists. "I've got a couple small bruises," he holds up his arm for John's perusal, "but otherwise there's nothing wrong."
.......…....................................................
"Mother started Harry and I out doing chores, little things around the house like taking out the trash or loading the dishwasher. Once my Father realized Harry was an Alpha, he put a stop to that. Harry wasn't allowed to do 'Omega things' like clean the house. It was the first time I realized there was a difference between Alphas and Omegas. Every once in a while Harry could do the dishes, but that was it."
She texted him a lot, which was awkward because she had made her personalized text alert to be that of a woman receiving...pleasure. He didn't like it. At all. Sherlock contemplated the idea that if he didn't text her back it would make her stop. It didn't. She texted him several times a day, and he found himself desperately wishing that he hadn't deleted how to change text tones from his Mind Palace, because once his children came he didn't want to have to discuss why Daddy's phone sounded so strange, or worse yet, why Daddy was getting texts from a Dominatrix in the first place.
"Yes."
‘You know I abhor emoticons. Who’s on forensics?-SH’
“He IS my mate.”
Sherlock shoves past Anthea, hollering "John!" so the man followed him.
"He's going to be okay," John reassures. "Here, let's get you cleaned up." He leads Sherlock into Mycroft's master bathroom, gently shoving Sherlock atop the toilet. From there, he grabs a washcloth from the rack and wets it, rubbing the cool water over Sherlock's face. "Are you alright?" he asks once he's finished.
“That’s okay, there’s always other ones.”
Sherlock stares at him for a moment. "You're brilliant!" He kisses John, then releases him so John can reach his phone.
"Hey," John says, grabbing Sherlock's arm and spinning him toward him. "I love you, in spite of the 'bit not good.'"
.........................................................................
"Your naivety is endearing, Johnny. You may be the Alpha, but I think we all know Sherlock will come running the moment he realizes you're gone. I've been watching him for a long while, learning all about him. I know how to make him dance like a puppet on a string. Now, I will give you this readout-" he kicks it over to John, "and you will go out there and say whatever I tell you to, or I will blow both you and your mate sky-high. Ta!" And he vanishes into the shadows once more.
"Do you have a shower? I smell odd."
“He’s my Perfect Match,” John answers, wanting this arrogant man to know that he is very much in love with Sherlock.
"It wasn't John."
He shoots me a look of pure tragedy. "Why do you do that?"
"Oh. Oh my god," John muttered. "It's me. The only way to reverse it is to bond him. Wasn't planning that yet, but okay. Okay. Can your car take me to Bart's?"
Sherlock nods. He huffs around the room, slamming things together, and disappears into the bathroom. When he reappears, he is toweling off his damp hair, and John has never wanted to kiss him more. He swallows and realizes his mouth is dry. After a moment, he tears his gaze away.
Greg rolls his eyes. "I swear to all things holy-". He jumps up. "C'mon, John, stand up," he orders tugging me to my feet.
Sherlock enters the room, balancing two trays nimbly. Without a word, he prepares a tray for John to his liking, then he grabs his own tray and leaves. John huffs, grumpy his Omega is leaving him after they cuddled together, and grabs his tray and walks out to the dining room table where Sherlock is.
My emotions are overwhelming and I can't take it. "Can you please stop the car?"
"Yes," Mycroft says, "according to John I've slept for the past twelve hours." He winces as his muscles tighten again, but the wave soon passes. "You've brought food?" Mycroft questions, sniffing the air. "Chicken noodle soup?"
"Beg pardon?"
"You are fierce and cunning, even if you often miss the obvious. You tried to protect me from John, setting aside years of personal dislike at the drop of a hat as soon as you saw signs that I might be in trouble. I can think of no one I would rather have for a godmother for my little girl than you."
I'm nervous the whole ride home, thinking about what's next. I need to apologize to Sherlock for pushing him away. I'm lost in thought again, fretting over how Sherlock will respond, not realizing I'm tapping my leg incessantly until Mycroft's hand lands on my knee. I jump.
“Because you want to reconcile.”
Sherlock huffs as John climbs into bed. His eyes go shut immediately, though he can feel his soulmate's stare piercing him.
Sherlock and Mycroft both stare at him. Sherlock glances at Mycroft and they quickly have a discussion with their eyes alone that John cannot hope to follow.
"You as well." He hangs up the phone, and smiles blissfully into the fireplace. He has successfully held two phone conversations with Gregory at this point. Granted, the second call was only thirty-four seconds long, but everyone must start somewhere, and this is Mycroft's start. His phone rings again, shattering his peaceful moment. He picks up, palms sweaty. If it's Lestrade again..."Hello?"
"Right. We're going back to Baker Street to figure this out," calls Dimmock to his team. "So help you if you can't catch the killer," he tells Sherlock quietly in an aside. "You will take the fall if you can't catch the real killer, I hope you know that. There were no witnesses, so you're in danger."
"He's missing. I don't think he's in the house."
“Okay,” answers Anthea awkwardly. “I won’t ask again.”
"I can't!"
"Yes," John replies, taking his mate's hand and leveling a challenging glare at Mycroft. "We are both very pleased."
Chapter Twenty: The Great Game
Sherlock doesn't answer, and the two men lapse into silence again. Much later that night, Sherlock finally gets the answer they are looking for, posting it online for their bomber to read. The game is on.
"Oh." John holds out his arms, inviting Sherlock to come to him. Sherlock does so, going boneless the second he hits John's arms.
Back inside 221B, Sherlock has gotten rid of Irene. 'Gotten rid of' being code for he grabbed her arm and just about threw her out the door, shutting it firmly behind her. John is on him the minute the door shuts, causing Sherlock to grab the handle for support as his knees buckle. To his surprise, John catches him, lifting him smoothly in the air and carrying him from the room. John's mouth is fastened onto their bond bite, and Sherlock is torn between wanting John's mouth on his lips or on their bond bite. John takes the decision out of his hands by smoothly kissing up Sherlock's neck and across one prominent cheekbone until he's connected their lips. Sherlock releases a deep throaty growl as John's hands travel across his ribcage, dancing lightly. He tries to pull John's shirt off-he loves the sight of John's shirtless body as much as he loves locked room murders- when his keen hearing catches the sound of someone knocking on the door.
"Mycroft Holmes, brother of Sherlock?"
Sherlock shrugs. "Thought it might be nice for your shoulder. I noticed you've been favoring it a bit today, it probably got tight due to all of your maneuvering during my heat, so I figured I'd get someone to help loosen you up again. He comes highly recommended from Mycroft."
"I better cherish it," John replies, grinning back.
He's been on the phone with several nurses and doctors alike, only to finally have one tell him, "I'm sorry sir, you're no longer the legal guardian of Mr. Holmes, and his bonded has requested we not give out information to anyone."
Sherlock laughs. "Yes, alright. Who did you want to ask for our little boy?"
After a moment's deliberation, Sherlock jumps up from the bed and grabs his Belstaff coat. "Coming, John?"
"Did you try any passcodes on it?"
"John sit down!"
"I'm sure about this. I love you, I want to be your family and for you to be mine."
Meanwhile, Sherlock didn't want an Alpha because he had learned that Alphas were vicious people who would kill anyone you held dear. It was a deeply-rooted fear of his that any child he had would be abused or murdered. No, Sherlock Holmes would never have an Alpha- he had a Mycroft and that was almost the same thing, but far less threatening.
“Yeah, the body, the corpse, whatever term you prefer really.” A spike of adrenaline wakes John up quickly. Body, corpse, no, no, no, no, Sherlock can’t be dead! He searches through their bond desperately, though he can’t find anything. No! Sherlock can’t be- he shoves past the woman on the stairs, charging up to find his mate, or whatever is left of him. He throws the door open and his entire brain cycles to a stop. Sherlock, his mate, his glorious living breathing beautifully breathtaking living mate, is on the ground next to- a dead body. Sherlock wasn’t the dead body though, and that is truly the only important thing to John as his world rights itself once more.
At Mycroft's nod, he strides out of the room. The supply closet hasn't changed location or code, so John easily enters the room. He grabs a few pillowcases, some bandages, soap and other cleaning supplies for Sherlock's bond bite, and then he takes a deep breath and grabs the things he'll need to bond Sherlock. He leaves and runs to the clean linens room, breaking in quickly to grab a heated blanket. Then he returns to the, no, to his Omega.
“Greg!” Sally exclaims as he heads to his office. “What are you doing? I thought you were going home?”
"Seventeen."
"You don't have to," reassures my Alpha kindly.
"Two babies," John replies, taking Sherlock's hand. "He's not sick."
John smiles as he looks at his mate. "Care to explain?"
"Oh, yes, him. That's a terrible name, you know, so plain. Anyway, continue."
Half-asleep like this, with minimal control over his body or his thoughts, Mycroft allows himself to admit that he's jealous. He's a bit jealous of his brother's mate- not that he wants John for himself, not at all, but someone might not be too terrible. It might be nice to have someone who wants to be with him constantly, someone who biology dictates would be the best match possible for him.
“Listen, I-“ John began, but Lestrade cut him off.
Sherlock doesn't answer. In fact, he doesn't speak again until after dinner. "I don't want an Alpha, Mycroft. Or pups."
He gratefully accepts the plate Mrs. Holmes hands him, and conversation grinds to a halt as everyone begins eating.
"Ha, ha. Could you put something on, please? Anything at all? A napkin?" he questions awkwardly, offering the cloth in his hand that was meant to be for Sherlock's face.
"Wait, this is your house too?" John  cuts in before the brothers can start name-calling like children.
At eleven thirty that night John was woken up by Sherlock smacking his arm, "John! John!"
"No, I'm serious," Greg insists, trying to see if Sherlock realizes how weird this is. "If there's something suspicious about the death of Connie Prince, why point it out?"
Mycroft's eyes dart down and back up his brother's body, rapidly deducing. He doesn't like what he sees, and his lips start compressing into tiny white lines. Then his eyes catch the bruises.
He is just getting ready to enter the tunnel himself when a tall ginger-haired man leaps his crime tape and sets off in a ground-eating stride toward the tunnels.
"Yes, if you'd let me go, I took a picture of it on my phone."
"Shut up, Sherlock. I'm in a great mood and not even you can ruin it," I hear Greg say as I scamper off to the dining room. I don't want to make eye contact with him yet.
"Hi, I'm Sebastian Moran," the blonde boy who came out with Jim tells me. He offers me his hand, which I just stare at. Who cares about social niceties when my soulmate is missing?
"That's not a problem, considering you're not sitting in it. Unless you plan to sit on his lap, then you should tell me so I can get the camera and take a picture." Sherlock grimaces in response, making John laugh.
"I'm going to need you out," he tells Mycroft politely. "Also, I'm going to need supplies. Give me five minutes?"
"Irene Adler. She has compromising photos of a certain member of notable reputation. It would be quite disastrous if she were to leak the photos as she has been threatening. Your job is to get the photos from her. She's very careful, doesn't have copies, anything she has is on a single cameraphone."
One week later, the smell of intense Omega heat abates, and John relaxes for the first time in a while.
.........................................................................
No, no, no, he surely did not have a dream fantasizing about Sherlock's Detective Inspector. That was inappropriate, he had never even met the man!
"Do you?"
"Do you know what he calls you?" she questions, and Sherlock isn't sure who she's talking to. "The Ice Man," she says, her gaze settling on Mycroft, "and The Virgin."
"Mrs. Hudson's been attacked by an American, I'm restoring balance to the universe," Sherlock responds coolly from his position on his chair, where he has the gun pointed at the American and holds the phone to his ear. On the inside, he is sending John feelings of joy and happiness at seeing him, and concern over Mrs. Hudson, hoping he interprets them correctly. Bless John, he does.
"Yeah, I just bought it. You don't think it's too much?"
"Sherlock, you need to listen to me. I cannot hide in here for the rest of my life. I want to be out there, finding Moriarty and making him pay for hurting you. I want to make him pay for scaring you, for making you think you lost me, and for every bit of ground he made me lose now that you think I don't care about you. Of course I care, Sherlock. I love you with all my heart. But we need to be able to go outside, and as of right now we need groceries, and I have to go get them."
"I had all this stuff," she continues, holding out the camera phone with the picture that started this whole mess in the first place, "and didn't know what to do with it.Thank God for the Consulting Criminal. He gave me a lot of advice about how to manipulate the Holmes boys."
"Alas, mangy cur! Ye've been defeated! Walk the plank!" roared Sherlock. "Redbeard and I have sunk your ship!"
Mycroft gets into his car, holds the door for Sherlock and John to scramble in behind him, and doesn't speak to either of them for the rest of the journey to Holmes Manor.
Sherlock glances up at him as he sits down. “You were supposed to stay in the bedroom.”
"Couldn't be more pleased. I love you," John replies.
"How would you know?"
Sherlock Holmes was nobody's idea of a traditional Omega. The seventeen year old rejected Alpha suitors outright, though at his age he was already expected to be bonded. After he sent a string of female lovers away in tears from his cruel deductions, his parents decided to have males pursue him. After all, their son had always needed a firm hand to discipline him, perhaps he needed a male Alpha. Sherlock took this challenge and rose above it, he insulted and overall bullied each man until they left him alone. (What Sherlock never told was how uncomfortable the men made him with their lewd comments and sordid promises of what they would do to him, the way they would force a bond on him, keep him bred with pups, and so on.) His parents viewed this as a disgrace, Sherlock saw it as the ultimate victory.
"Don't like to eat. At all. It's distracting, disrupts my thinking."
"Sounds like a good day," answers John when he can get a word in.
Satisfied that his landlady will be alright, Sherlock turns his angry gaze back to the American on the floor. His face is murderous.
"Sherlock, what are you doing?"
“When His Royal Sulkiness gets back, maybe we can find the phone,” Donovan comments.
“Do you think I’m a moron for that?”
"Kid's fine," John says. "Wait, how old is this boy?"
John snaps out of his drugged haze long enough to mumble, “Of course we’ll be needing two.”
“But I left you at a crime scene! And you were wounded and in pain!”
"Right. If you would've let me finish though, I wanted to discuss our relationship."
"Well, I was curious as to how close I could get to you without upsetting you or making you nervous. Moving the table slowly was a method of systematic desensitization, getting you acclimated to my presence in small increments so as not to upset you."
"Yes, sir?"
"Sherlock? What are you doing?" At the sound of John's voice, Sherlock panics. He darts away from Dr. Sawyer, jumping onto the nearest elevator. It's going up, not down, but it's away from John and Dr. Sawyer, so it's better than the alternative.
“No thank you,” says Sherlock smoothly.
“Probably because-“ Sherlock began, but Lestrade held up a hand and cut him off.
"But-" Sherlock begins.
"Where did that ring come from?" asks John. "I'm certain you didn't have it in your pocket, because I had to grab your coat off the hook when we left Baker Street."
I stay in his lap, smelling the comforting smell of family. There is a part of me that panics more at this, but I firmly tamp it down. Sherlock is my mate, Mycroft is his family which makes him my family. Simple math: Mycroft equals family.
"You've been doing that for the past three hours."
”Stop it! Put that down! Donovan, put my eyes back! That’s for a sensitive experiment!” He turns to John, expression pleading. “John! Make them stop it! They’re destroying my nest!”
.........................................................................
"For now. He'll call reinforcements, because that's what Mycroft paid him to do."
"But all of those lives-" John begins, pondering the horror. As a doctor and an Army man, he hates the idea of what Sherlock is implying. All those innocent civilian lives lost...Sherlock says nothing in response, and John gets lost in his head for a while, picturing the terror of what is to come.
John's just finished with the weeding when his father bellows for him to come inside. He rushes in and cleans his hands. Dinner is a tense affair and John is relieved when it's over. He loads the dishes quickly without being asked.
Mycroft leads them to a parlor and pulls out board games. They pass the rest of the evening laughing together over board games, or in some cases raging over them. John wins at Monopoly. They try Cluedo, but when trying to explain to Sherlock that the victim cannot be the murderer, he grows angry and flips the board, then stabs it to the wall. John and Mycroft both roll their eyes at his dramatics. Once they agree to give up Cluedo, Risk comes out. Mycroft skunks them both easily the first round, so John and Sherlock team up against him the second round. They put up a decent fight, but eventually their kingdom falls to him again. "Don't feel bad, Brother Mine. It's my destiny to win, I am 'The British Government' after all."
"Sherlock, the boy was outside struggling to move."
"I can't wait, either. Love you Mom."
The third time Sherlock proposed, he was high. He and John had been chasing Moriarty, and Sherlock had managed to get close enough to tackle the consulting criminal to the ground.
"Is it selfish to want both?" questions Sherlock. "I need you, only you, but biology demands I have John too."
“You looked like you were getting ready to fight that guy.”
Irene grins. "I like detective stories." Her gaze slides back to Sherlock. "And detectives. Brainy is the new sexy, you know," she says to John, smirking at him like he's a co-conspirator.
"It's Mycroft. He's sick, I've never seen him so bad, he's curled up and groaning. He asked for you."
Lestrade returns then with a taxi and cautiously helps John into it. He climbs in after him and the two sit in silence until the taxi arrives at 221B.
"So like, biologically, I wouldn't enjoy kissing anyone's mate?"
Sherlock wrinkles his brow in confusion. John is...he stares at him, deducing, and lights upon the answer a moment later. Jealous. John is jealous. He wants Sherlock to himself, and Sherlock is intended to oblige him because he doesn't like the naked lady very much.
The whole story is flowing out of Sherlock in a rush, and by the end of it, Mycroft is glad his brother threw the agent out of the window, because he is tempted to do it, too. "I told them to be careful because you were pregnant! Stupid Americans never want to listen! They will be recalled immediately," he vows, furious. "I will speak with the Director and threaten to withhold all possibilities of freelance work within the CIA if he doesn't pull them off the Irene Adler case instantly. And he will, because he will not want to lose me." He paces outside, and they can hear him for a moment berating someone on his phone, and then the door falls shut and his voice is muffled once more.
"We had to re-break them because they didn't heal properly. Whoever abused him probably broke them then wouldn't allow him to get treatment."
"If you don't want to be bonded, if you've changed your mind, I won't be offended."
"I just told you Mycroft can get them for us!"
"I'll get stoned," Mycroft replies, "which is not exactly the response I'm going for. I'm not attractive, you know. If you joined me, people would at least have something nice to look at."
"I thought that-well, it's complicated. I freaked out over the fact that I might be gay. And I'd never kissed anybody before, so I asked Greg to kiss me, so I had experience. But kissing him wasn't nice, and now I think I might be asexual."
“No? Only a matter of time, then, dearie. Oh don’t be embarrassed, we all know that’s what’s coming. Here’s your breakfast, and here’s John’s, go back to your mate now.”
Mycroft moans as the Alpha above him plunders his mouth expertly with his tongue. Instantly his mind begins categorizing differences between this encounter and all others: this encounter is not marred with the needy feeling of a heat, and his bed-partner behaves in a manner that says he wants Mycroft for himself, not because of who he is or his position, or even because he is an Omega.
Sherlock lopes back home to John. "Hey," he greets as he comes through the door.
'Congratulations, you're a godmother. -SD'
"So, what's the code?"
"Great! Then let's drop John's crap off and go play poker."
The clock chiming in the hall gets everyone's attention. "Oh, its too late for you boys to go back tonight," Mrs. Holmes says. "Stay here tonight. You can have your old rooms, boys." She takes their plates-in spite of John's argument that he can wash the dishes- and turns to leave. "Mummy, aren't you forgetting something? Where will John sleep?"
"Sherlock?" John calls regretfully.
“I’m not going into shock! Look, the killer must have been a crack shot. The bullet when pulled from the body and run by ballistics was shot from a military-grade weapon, I can guarantee it. Your sniper must be used to killing people, his hands didn’t shake at all. So, an experienced killer, who’s used to protecting others, hands didn’t shake-“ Lestrade is so busy furiously scrawling Sherlock’s deductions that he misses the pause. He glances up to see if Sherlock has succumbed to shock after all when he realizes Sherlock is staring at John. “Never mind. I was wrong.”
"What do you want with me?"
"First and only time you'll ever hear that, John," calls a teasing voice behind them. Both Sherlock and John swing around to see Lestrade, a shopping basket on one arm that's completely empty, with a huge grin on his face.
“Are we going home soon?”
He sees police tape and figures that he should probably go over there. Given his mate’s propensity for trouble, police tape seems like a good place to look for Sherlock.
"Sherlock," the older boy whispers. "Are you alright?"
“What?”
Sherlock appears flummoxed for just a moment. "I'm sorry."
"Well, you're going to today. You just got out of heat, you need to eat. You can pick something if you want, but I need you to eat."
“Twenty-one,” answers John. “Second question: What do you do for a living? Or what do you want to do?”
"I'll be there in a few minutes. I must admit I had my doubts about a home birth, but everything worked out alright?"
Sherlock shakes his head. "No, it wasn't Mycroft. It was my father, and he's dead now, good riddance! Sorry, that's a bit not good."
"WHY?"
"Sleepy?" Mycroft repeats.
John smiles at his young mate, trying to put him at ease. He makes a show of laying on top of his good hand, knowing the boy will realize this means John won’t lunge for him and hit him. Sherlock finally climbs onto the bed, though he curls into a small ball on the opposite end. His knees are touching his chest and both arms are around his knees. His aquamarine eyes are the only part of his face John can see. Belatedly, he realizes the ball of boy is trembling.
Sherlock has a sudden reminiscing of the kind of business she deals in and frowns. "I don't want to do business with you, thank you. Please feel free to see yourself out."
"I am sorry, truly. I should have told you, talked to you earlier."
Mycroft actually laughs now, a short aborted chuckle, but a genuine laugh all the same. "How novel! I'm being blackmailed."
Dimmock arrests the man.
"I suppose for all intents and purposes I was straight. I liked to think about men, but didn’t act on it. That’s why I said earlier I knew I was gay, although I acted like I was straight."
They board the plane together. John stares around at all the passengers, realizing that something feels off. "They're all dead," he tells Sherlock.
"Phone. Call from high up, much higher than we can ignore. Get the phone, Watson."
"I think so, yes." We climb back into the car and head home. Once we get there, I go inside and bellow, "Sherlock!"
"What?" Mycroft stares at him.
"I thought I'd lost you, Mycroft," Sherlock whispers.
"You're welcome. I've got to go, I'll be late for work soon if I don't," Lestrade explains unnecessarily, then he turns and leaves.
That's all they say for the rest of the trip, until they get to 221B. Sherlock makes a beeline for the fridge, throwing their supplies on the counter and beginning to unload the bags. "John!" he yells, turning to see his mate hasn't yet made it up the stairs.
The trauma in his mate’s tone causes John to growl loudly and ferociously. He can feel his body trembling as it desires to turn into a wolf and force the intruders out, but he restrains, knowing he will only injure himself worse if he morphs now.
"No, I don't. What am I missing?"
"She is cunning and resourceful, though she often misses the bigger picture. She is kinder now that she's not with Anderson, and she calls me Freak as a joke now and seems to look out for me. She's very protective, and seems to have decided that I am someone she needs to protect, based on her behavior when she thought you might be hurting me. I believe our child could do much worse for a godmother. Besides, she likes children. She'd spoil her godchild rotten."
"I will," he vows.
Mycroft nods seriously. "It is your decision, John."
Babies born stop Call me stop
Once all the housework is done, he moved to his room to finish his homework.
.............................................................
John has no idea what that is supposed to mean, so he ignores it. As he and Sherlock go out into the hallway, they find Irene's friend lying on the ground. John begins assessing her, and doesn't realize that Sherlock and Irene have both left until Kate is sitting up slowly and he then starts looking for his mate. A feeling of alarm shooting through their bond has him running down a hall searching for Sherlock.
"Wonderful. I'm going to need his number. Who's godmother for your son?"
Sherlock leaps away from the table excitedly, grabbing his Belstaff and pulling it on. "C'mon, John," he calls impatiently over his shoulder as he heads to the front door. John grabs the cards for Lestrade and Donovan, tucking them carefully into his pocket before rushing out the door after his mate.
“Oh! That means she left it with him, with the killer, brilliant! We find the case, we find the killer!” And Sherlock is off, down the stairs like a shot, gone into the night.
Greg pulls away. "You okay?"
"Yeah, yeah. Get out of my room. It's too crowded with your six-foot pouty self lying on the bed."
"What'cha lookin' a', Jawn?" slurs Sebastian, clapping his friend on the shoulder.
"Sure. Did you want to look through them now?"
“Why?” Sherlock questions, pulling back a bit to stare at John.
Greg feels his face split into a grin. "We've got a wedding to plan, Mycroft. Our consulting detective and his blogger are getting married!"
"How about me, then? Is there someone who could love an abused Omega?"
"You never wanted an Alpha?" Sherlock shakes his head no.
Mycroft stands slowly, stretching his lanky body and popping his back. "Thank you for your honesty, John," he says, then hugs me. Greg follows his mate, hugging me and squeezing my hand but not saying anything.
"Greg. Mycroft is real, this is his house, he did invite you over, and he is really sick." As if to prove his point, Mycroft has his first seizure of the night. He wakes up a bit once it's over, John reassures him that he's alright, and then he drifts back off.
"The model-the one we knew about- is a little boy."
John cracks a smile. "Honestly, it doesn't matter to me. Just surprised me, is all. So then, will those two be our little girl's godparents? I could see Donovan and Sebastian both being good with a little girl. Honestly, I'd feel better when she starts dating, having Sebastian around as a threat."
"Why do we have a chiropractor coming?" John questions.
"The same way I know the victim was an excellent sportsman, recently returned from foreign travel, and that the photographs I'm looking for are in this same room."
"So I'm not a sociopath, I'm just different." Sherlock laughs. "I'll have to remember that to tell Anderson the next time." The mates stand in silence for a moment. "I'm going to take a shower," Sherlock announces, pulling away from John. "Join me?"
"Sorry gorgeous. I get stupid when seeing such a pretty Omega."
Sherlock stares in shock at the screen. "You're sure? Where was the second child on every other ultrasound I've had?"
“Yes, Mycroft and I unfortunately share genetic material. As for John, he’s okay in the manner that he’s still alive and they believe he should have full use of his arm, but he’s on pain medication and was sleeping the last time I saw him.”
The door to the lab swings open, and Molly bustles in. "Oh, sorry!" It's too late, the damage is already done. Sherlock moves away from John, offering him a half-hearted smile before he moves back over to the microscope and stares through it. Whatever moment they had had has been lost, and it takes all of John's willpower not to snarl at Molly for it.
The woman looks confused, but she agrees to look over the graffiti. “The sign here, this is the number one.”
"Yes, well done, you were actually right about something," Sherlock comments, his tone only a little mocking.
"I love you too," Sherlock whispers, taking a moment to be vulnerable with his mate.
John turns and jumps on Moriarty's legs, ensuring the man's legs break so he can't follow them. Then he turns and runs from the building too.
"Hamish," John says, and the comment is so off-the-wall both Sherlock and Irene turn to stare at him. "John Hamish Watson. Just in case you were looking for baby names."
Mycroft rushes into the room mere seconds after Lestrade's car pulls away. His eyes immediately lock onto his brother's, and then fall to the growling wolf in front of him. "Hello, John," he greets evenly.
“Come here.”
"But that's not why you're here, to thank us," John realizes. "So what are you here for?"
Sally gives him a look like he's being deliberately obtuse. "We all did."
"John and I may be arrested for murder unless we can catch the real killer."
“I don’t know. The doctors haven’t told me anything yet.”
"I know. I would never dare accuse otherwise."
"Sherlock, I think you overestimate the time that will take. There is literally one person here."
Mike, Molly and I troop downstairs at a more sedate rate. As soon as Mycroft and Greg join us, I take charge. "His jacket is on the hook, so if he is outside he's sans jacket, thus at risk for frostbite. Finding him quickly is paramount. Split up outside, Mike and Molly go north, Greg and Mycroft go south, Jim and Sebastian go east. I'll go west. Yell for him within the boundaries of our property and if we can't find him converge back by our front gate. Jim, if you and Sebastian do anything other than hunt for John-"
The next day, Sherlock begins domestic work, ie. cooking. He tells John that he is bound and determined to make an edible food dish to take to his brother's house that evening. However, he will not accept John's input on the matter at all, so John spends most of the day in the library as Sherlock looks through cookbook after cookbook in an attempt to find a dish he thinks he can make. Finally, Sherlock has decided on a banoffee pie, which John is pretty sure he decided on only because it's Sherlock's favorite, and a yellow cake, because Sherlock knows his brother loves cake.
"Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes."
"You killed my dog!"
"I concede the victory."
"Um, whatcha doin', Sherlock?"
"Your help," Sherlock answered, staring at the detective inspector as though the man was being deliberately obtuse.
She puts it on without complaint. "Now tell me, I need to know, how was it done?"
"Relax, Mycroft. We've got the code, we can find the real killers now. Email me the numbers," Mycroft scans the sheet through as they speak to each other, "and go to bed. You've done enough for today; John and I are indebted to you."
"Sherlock," John tries again, "you need sleep too."
Greg agrees, and drifts off to sleep.
"Your heat."
"Propose to me like I'm John."
Sherlock frowns, but sinks to his knees.
The fifth time Sherlock proposed to John, it was an accident.
"What?" Sherlock still looks cool and collected, but John can tell because of their bond that he has no idea what she is asking about.
Sherlock relaxes instantly, going limp in John's arms. "Mmm, yesss," he purrs. John smirks to himself. At least the boy is relaxed now, even if he will be a terror once he realizes he hasn't convinced John to come to bed with him.
John chuckles. Recalcitrant, then. That certainly explained a lot.
"Get there within six minutes and I'll give you a raise."
Greg turns a little red and quickly changes the conversation after that.
"What? No, that's impossible! Come on, John!" She's still tugging at his hand, though they both know it's useless, John's Omega biology won't let him disobey his Alpha.
Lestrade glanced up from his paperwork. "I don't have a-" he began, then shot Sherlock an incredulous look as the man's words registered. "You need WHAT?"
"Then you bond with that man. They're not all like your father, you know."
"I figured it out moments after you left. That's why I came."
Sherlock nods, face serious. "I'll work on that," he says, and I know he will. My baby brother will try to take care of John to the best of his ability.
"Did you get to see everything the last time you were here, or do you need a tour?" Sebastian asks.
“Hi, John,” Sherlock answers, feeling his heart squeeze painfully as he looks over his mate. ‘It’s ridiculous that I’m hurting simply because he’s hurt. What a useless bit of sentiment,’ Sherlock thinks.
Mycroft sits behind his desk, steeples his fingers, and stares at me. He doesn't say anything, so I feel the need to speak.
"You've never met said Alpha, are you certain it's wise to get attached so quickly? Remember Redbeard. Caring is not an advantage."
It's a day they both recall like it was yesterday. Siger Holmes was on the rampage yet again. His youngest son was causing trouble in school, and had been expelled from the second school this year. As he walked through the door, he had expected to find his wife waiting for him, his oldest son making dinner, and his youngest waiting apologetically with a wonderful explanation as to why he'd gotten expelled yet again.
"Well?" Mycroft questions.
Sherlock passes John one of the donuts, then crawls onto the bed to be with his brother as he eats. The food is just what he needs to feel well again, though he passes up the coffee with the excuse of not being thirsty. After all, he doesn't want to clue Mycroft in to his pregnancy, and he shouldn't have the caffeine.
Sherlock looks up then, a bit of derision across his features. “No.”
"Sherlock-" John begins, but Sherlock is on a roll.
“Mycroft’s house.”
Mycroft snarls. "You had better not SHARE my brother with your army friends."
Sherlock jumps up and grabs the book in response. They flip through it together, occasionally calling out names to each other. Blake, Landon, Jonathan, Arthur, Archie, and Reginald are all quickly vetoed. Amy, Victoria, Elizabeth, Georgia, Virginia, Susan, and Joy are soon to follow. After a few hours they come up with nothing they like, so they agree to set the books aside and look another day.
After a few minutes, John's last question comes. "Have either of them hurt you?"
“John? Let’s go to sleep,” Sherlock suggests.
After about a half hour of silence, he walks to Tesco's and picks up some groceries for them. A sense of alarm has him sprinting back toward the flat, and he charges up the stairs like an angry bull. Sherlock is sitting at the table still, looking terrified.
“You can. If you give me passes, I’ll take the coward’s way out and pass every question.”
Another deep chuckle. "Please what?"
"Would you like to talk about it with other people present? We could have your pack, Greg if you want too, there for support. I could sit with Sherlock if you want, or get lost for the conversation. Whatever would make you more comfortable is what I want to do."
"We've been listening. She says she told you."
Sally stands her ground. "Yes, I do. John, can you go grab something off the printer for me? It's in the room three doors down, you can't miss it. The code to access the printer is 23556. Then you just push the green button and the paper spits out." She grabs Sherlock's arm and hauls him out of the room before John can agree.
“We never discussed the use of conference calls as a factor that would need to be avoided when you broke into my house. Anyway, you’re at a loss, otherwise you wouldn’t be in my house. I could save you hours of mind-numbing research. Which do you prefer?”
Abruptly his spine stiffened and he inhaled a huge breath. A sweet smell permeated the air. A mixture of peppermint tea, gunpowder, and fabric softener dryer sheets. Sherlock had never smelled anything so amazing in all his life. He searched subtly through the group of sweaty soldiers, but couldn't decide which one emitted that glorious scent.
"Boyfriends. Girlfriends. Friends in general."
"Mmm? Sure John. Goodnight." It's how quickly he surrenders that makes John realize he wasn't actually heard.
I pull my Omega close, and surprisingly he allows it. He goes boneless the second I curl him around me, my scent soothing him. We lie there on the snowy ground together, and I whisper "I love you, John."
John hardly even looks at it. "How are you doing? I mean, you just got out of the hospital, were recently bonded, and now you found out your father is dead, and was murdered by your mother. How are you holding up?"
"In fact, I could stand a change in scenery. My foster brother is trying to-" his voice trails off awkwardly, but then he clears his throat and recovers. "Anyway, I was planning to leave soon, wouldn't hurt to go with a friend."
"I saw the way you flinched when Lestrade used his Alpha voice. I sat through the classes, I know that that is often a sign of abuse. If it's John, we can get you away from him."
"What the f**k are you still doing here? I thought I told you to do housework." A sharp crack of a hand across his mouth sends John on his way, blood beginning to slowly trickle down his face.
I quickly lose track of time. After I get done, I study the pins I put in and remove them. Looking at the names, I try to push them back in in the right spots. I fail epically, which makes me laugh at myself. I try again and do better.
The woman's suspicious gaze changes instantly. "Of course honey! I'll help you find him!"
"You seemed very uncomfortable with being near me in the car."
"Been divorced for about two weeks now, I'm a free man!" Lestrade says, laughing. Sherlock stares at him for a moment before turning away- it's obvious to anyone with eyes that Lestrade is hurting worse than he is letting on, but he's trying to pretend he's unaffected so that people don't pity him. "Anyway, your dress is pretty, Molly. Is it new?"
Sherlock has just won yet another game of poker, much to the feigned chargin of John’s Army mates, when he hears alarms ringing. “What is that?”
"They won't let me see Mycroft."
"Around two hours and thirty minutes, since a bomb went off near us this morning," John replies after consulting his watch.
Molly's face twists in pain, and she leaves the room in a hurry.
It is as close as he will come to admitting his guilt, and even Lestrade seems to realize that, because his only response is a soft, "oh," and a strange look Sherlock's direction.
"Hello Mycroft, it's Detective Inspector Lestrade." Mycroft freezes at the sound of the man's voice, mentally cursing himself for not checking the caller ID before he picked up.
There is an excessive bang as their outside door flies open, and Sherlock is heard dragging something heavy up the stairs. "Well I'm sorry, but you didn't get all the injuries! We're going to need to try again!"
"Sherlock, love, maybe you should go get dressed, and we can hear your brother out," John suggests, and Sherlock miraculously flits off to find a bathroom and put clothes on as he was told to. In a couple of minutes he has left the bathroom fully clothed and seats himself on the sofa next to John.
"Okay, so you bonded. Most Omegas don't celebrate by threatening to jump off a roof."
She giggles. "Such a charmer, John!"
"If I wanted to look at naked women, I could use John's laptop," Sherlock answers, holding out his Belstaff coat for Irene to shrug into.
"Mr. Holmes? I'm Doctor Sawyer, the doctor in charge of Sherlock. None of the blood tests have shown us anything, which means it's not an overdose. Has he had heats?"
"Are you alright?" Lestrade demands. "Are you sick? You should be at home if you're sick. I don't mean to be rude, John, but you shouldn't let him have crime scenes when he's sick. And maybe you didn't catch it, but honestly, you should go home. Or are you high again? I swear, if you're high-"
"That's what family does," replies John sincerely.
I think this over. "Maybe. That might really help."
“Hmmm? Oh yes, definitely.”
"Let her burn, and cry 'God save the Queen,' then make yourself a cup of tea and have a cigarette," Sherlock retorts. "I'm sure you'll manage without me for a while." He turns to his mate now. "Take me home, John."
"I'll move when I get the chance."
It's not long after Guy Fawkes Day that Sherlock is called into Buckingham Palace. The day starts out like this: Sherlock had been throwing up for most of the morning. When he got a client he pulled himself together long enough to sit with the client, though he was still wrapped in a sheet off the bed, claiming it felt cooler and gentler on his delicate skin. He listens to the client and is genuinely interested, but John puts his foot down at the idea of Sherlock going to a crime scene to examine a dead body when he can't even get dressed. As such, a solution is finally reached that allows John to go to the crime scene with a computer so that Sherlock can examine the scene through Skype and remain in the comfort of his own home at the same time. John is bent over the dead body, angling the laptop for Sherlock to see, when he is interrupted by a helicopter hovering overhead, the sound of the blades loud enough to drown out Sherlock.
"Shush, Jim," reprimands Mycroft.
Lestrade smirks. "Great, thanks!" He sends out an order to his colleagues to go arrest the brother, then leans back in his chair. "You know, we'd better pray your brother never decides to murder you with a green ladder. 'Cuz if he does, you're death is going to be the biggest cold case ever. I wouldn't be able to solve it."
Mycroft shakes his head. "I didn't need to hand you over like a lamb for the slaughter."
"Don't be. It's for the best. We tried to reconcile, and she cheated on me again with the same PE teacher, so we just divorced. Good riddance."
“You heard me. Yes or no: do you think I’m stupid?”
"So I'm guessing this is your first heat?" John asks. The snarling Alpha lurks beneath the surface, pleading for a chance to bite the delicious-smelling boy in front of him, but John determinedly tamps it down.
Miraculously, Sherlock manages to stay ahead of Sebastian the whole time. He darts back into the base, forcing his way through the fighting until he gets to the front. He arrives just in time to see an Alpha morph into human form, pull a gun and shoot John.
Something about that doesn't seem right to John. "People don't have arch-enemies."
"I know. I'm asking for a kiss, not a marriage proposal."
Sherlock turns away, trying to hide his hurt and frustration. Why doesn't John want to marry him?
Something about John's tone makes Sherlock question, "Not good?"
Mike isn't stupid, thankfully, so he just looks at John and says, "Your dad again?"
His gaze fell on the sheet of paper next to him, one that had not been there when he had entered his Mind Palace three hours ago. Written by John, obviously. Scrawled quickly, by the way the letters are written.
“I’m going back. People always told me there was no way that I would ever have a match, no way that anyone would ever love me. If you think I’m going to just sit here and play damsel in distress while I possibly lose the only person outside of my family that would ever love me, you’ve got another thing coming.” Thus saying, he turns and sprints down the hill. Sebastian chases after him, cursing him out all the while.
After forty-five minutes, Sherlock has finally cracked the code. "It's a jade pin that's missing, John!" he exclaims excitedly.
"I'm smarter than you like to give me credit for."
John gapes at him. "I'm not unfaithful! How dare you accuse me of such a thing! And what are you on about? We're not married!"
"John!" Sherlock bellows, completely ignoring Lestrade.
"And I think Mrs. Hudson as godmother."
"That's brilliant!"
“Hi, John.”
The doorbell rings, and I move into the foyer to let the doctor in. "Hello, Mycroft. So I'm here to look at your foot?"
Sherlock does nothing to fight him, rather he wraps his legs around John's waist and clings to him desperately.
"An hour."
He goes up to check on his brother, but once again John only lets him stay a couple of minutes. "I'm sorry, the stress isn't good for the baby," he says quietly.
"I already know things you want to talk about. Your family. Your brother is close to you, but you don't approve of him-possibly because of his alcoholism, more likely because he recently left his wife. I know you're not close to your parents, but not because you were abused by them. I know you would consider yourself to be a "good" Alpha, which I would agree with based on your dealings with me in heat. So as you can see, there's no need to talk, because I already know most of the important things about you."
“The famous Big Brother?”
"Yes! You're fantastic!"
"Perhaps you'd like to burn it tomorrow?" Sherlock suggests.
“Yeah, I think so. You don’t look so good, John. Let me help you downstairs.” Lestrade gently guides him down the stairs as John swallows his pride.
"Yeah, it's for a case," John explains, sounding tired. Then he too leaves the room, obviously looking for Sherlock.
Mycroft stands and moves to his brother's side. He leans down to whisper quietly to Sherlock- two words John doesn't hear: "I'm sorry." He turns and leaves, pulling the door shut unobtrusively behind him.
“Wonderful.” Lestrade types that into the computer too. “Now then, the ballistics report says the weapon was a British Army Browning L9A1. I’d estimate that there are approximately 5,000 of those in London at the moment, and possibly another 20,000 that are unregistered. Since I’m not going to track down all 5,000 registered owners, and since Anderson was working forensics last night and mucked up the crime scene as per usual, I’m going to say the assassin is impossible to find. That was all I needed.” He makes a few more notations, prints the file, signs it with a flourish, and shoves himself away from the computer. “Wish all my cases wrapped up so nicely as this one. ‘Course that would drive me nuts if they were all left open like this one after a while.”
John wakes up to the clicking of the door opening and closing quietly. He keeps his breathing regulated, hoping Sherlock will leave him alone so he actually can go to sleep. “I’m sorry, John,” whispers Sherlock as he tiptoes over to the bed. “I’m no good at this; Omegas are supposed to nurture their Alphas, and I ditched you at a crime scene in the middle of nowhere when you were hurt. Lestrade reamed me out and I deserved it. I’m sorry, but at the same time I wish I could be more sorry. I’m not used to having anyone else look after me, and honestly I’m furious that I have to put up with taking someone else with me or leaving notes now because I have you. I hate that I lost my independence, and I hate that your kiss made me feel like I was melting, like I’d never be whole again without your arms around me and your mouth on mine. I hate this, I hate you, and I wish I’d never met you.”
John didn’t realize that spaghetti, Sherlock’s meal of choice, was so difficult for some people. He had never realized that it was possible to nearly burn down a flat by making spaghetti. As such, he got quite the shock when he took a taxi back from the therapist and found the street blocked by fire trucks. He shoves by, reassuring the firemen that he lived there, and found Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson standing outside a smoking 221B.
Mycroft sighs, peaceful mood completely vanished. Honestly, he should get one bloody day off. "I'll be right there," he promises.
“No. Not for lack of several people wishing it, though. Are you glad you have an Omega now? Even though it will take you away from the Army?”
"Who press-gangs suicide bombers??!!"
John shoots Mycroft a look. "It's not that easy."
Sherlock shoots him an odd look, but barrels on. “So where is her case? Did she eat it?”
"Don't ever apologize for getting upset. If it was my brother, I'd be much worse. You're free to express yourself," John tells him.
“I was shot. In my shoulder.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "Great, now I need to go get him a better present," he gripes."I'm glad I got you to move all the stuff out of the other bedroom the other day, because we don't have to do it now. What kind of colors do you want?"
"I'll bet Lestrade would enjoy the Alps," Sherlock remarks offhandedly.
“The evidence you gathered is of interest to the government. I’m afraid I must insist you turn over your case files, effective immediately.”
“He’s married.”
He turns to Mycroft. "You should probably leave now, sir."
"Yeah, sorry," I answer.
"Sure," John agrees, turning to point in the opposite direction. "You just go-" the sharp pain to the back of his head knocks him to the ground. A second bludgeoning, and he embraces unconscious.
“Sh’lock!”
Sherlock doesn't bother to respond to that. As Irene slips past him, he yells, "John! We have a visitor!"
"I am," the boy says bluntly. "I'm also not interested in him, in spite of the stereotype of all Omegas wanting a doctor for a husband."
"Oh, I forgot to tell you, tomorrow we have a chiropractor coming to visit," Sherlock says. He moves over to the computer and begins an analysis of different chemicals, so he's free to speak as the computer runs through the data and does some of the work for him.
As I turn to follow them inside, I realize Sherlock has ahold of my arm. "Hey, everything okay?" I question.
The room itself is dark brown, with a light brown carpet. It has a small fireplace with hearth tucked in the corner unobtrusively, which I like a lot. The wood of his desk is oak, offset by his black leather chair. His computer is a sleek laptop which he pulls from the messenger bag he carries. Based on Jim's face, the computer is a nice one.
"Sorry?" John's not sure he heard him right.
"It's a good sign, his body's metabolizing the drug," John replies. "It's exiting his system even now."
"Sherlock," he says finally, "it's late. We need to go to bed."
"Don't be sorry. If he hurt you, there's no need to be sorry."
"I'm going home, with John," Sherlock says. "Make sure I'm not disturbed."
John swears, then glances at Soo Lin guiltily. "Sorry."
I bite down the growl traveling up my throat in challenge to Sebastian smelling my mate. He is clearly a tracker, and if he knows where to find John that is helpful, I tell myself as I lope along beside Sebastian.
"We got paid well," Molly says.
"What?" the man demands, drawing back and looking confused.
"Propriety suits you, brother," retorts Sherlock.
Inside the room, Sherlock sneers for a moment as Irene's frantic gaze darts toward the mirror. "Thank you. Upon hearing a smoke alarm, a mother would look toward her child. Amazing how fire reveals our priorities." He crosses over to the mirror and fiddles with the mantel of the fireplace directly beneath it. In a moment, the mirror slides up to reveal a safe behind it. "Really hope you don't have a baby in here," he tells Irene dryly. "Alright, John, you can turn it off now!" A pause as the fire alarm continues. "I said you can turn it off now!"
"When you blush like that, I want to devour your skin."
"It's decaf," warns John.
"You don't have to mourn him, either," Sally tells him, her tone uncharacteristically gentle. "When you hugged Lestrade, when you threatened to jump off the roof of the hospital, he told me there were things that I didn't understand, but that you would be alright. Was this what he meant? He knew you'd been abused?"
"They don't?" Sherlock's tone makes it clear he doesn't care. "What do they have?"
I giggle. "Shut up! How did you know?"
"No, I got a tour the last time."
"I'm certain there's a few," he answered nonchalantly.
"I will. We'll come back for you John, I promise!" She kisses his cheek lightly than darts off to safety.
John and Sherlock share a glance and both realize that if the party gets to be too much they can have a built-in excuse to hide if they have it after the twins are born. "After," they both say simultaneously.
The click of the phone lets Mrs. Holmes know her son has hung up, and she chuckles to herself as she begins making plans to see him tomorrow.
"No, stop! This is our ticket in!"
"If so, be sure to lock the door this time," Sherlock calls.
He's shocked when Sherlock jumps off the ledge onto the roof and flings himself into his arms, then promptly bursts into tears. Belatedly he realizes that Sherlock, as a newly bonded Omega, is experiencing hormone surges and has no idea of how to deal with his volatile emotions right now.
"I'd prefer to do this," I answer, frantically putting everything away.
Meanwhile, Sherlock goes downstairs and finds his mother in the kitchen preparing plates of food. "Mummy, Mycroft is pretty sick," he lies, not wanting to upset her. No matter if she killed his father or not, he still sees her as the delicate woman of childhood, and he doesn't want to upset her or trigger a sickness in her. "He'll be upstairs for at least the next twenty-four hours. John has volunteered to stay with him. We're going to keep the party running though, because that's what Mycroft asked us to do."
Lestrade reopens the card and his eyes skim the words. "Really? You want me to be godfather?"
He checked his watch-six thirty a.m.- and told his driver to take him to his brother's. He was certain they would still be asleep, but whenever meant whenever, and then he'd be near Sherlock once he finally did wake.
"Yes, but you need to drink it slowly," John tells him. Sherlock grabs a bowl for his brother from the kitchen and returns, pouring the soup from a thermos into the bowl. Then he hands it to his brother.
"Thank you," Sherlock says gratefully. "We appreciate it."
They'd also found out that it was way too difficult for them to get supplies, especially in the winter when they needed warm clothes. It was Jim who led their forage into crime. He could disable security cameras in a matter of seconds, while John led their pack through the house to find what they needed.
"Holy s**t, am I really?"
John jumps and whirls around, grabbing a washcloth to preserve his modesty. "Mycroft?!"
"Nothing, really," John answers vaguely. He thinks he's found the Omega emitting that lovely smell, a tall yet still somehow delicate-looking thin boy who's bloody attractive. John thinks he looks familiar, then places him as one of the gentlemen who had watched them perform earlier in the day.
"John? What are you doing?" John tries to move his feet, but they refuse to follow his commands.
Sherlock takes a deep breath, and John feels his fingers dig into his arm. He doesn't complain. "John."
Meanwhile, John Watson was trying to focus on his army drills. At the signal, he transitioned smoothly into his wolf from. Where the short Captain once stood was now a brown-blonde wolf with piercing blue eyes. As a soldier, John liked his wolf form for its strength. The doctor in him appreciated the odd color of fur and eyes which seemed to make the wounded trust him more.
As soon as he gets off, he ducks behind the building. Jim is already there, wearing a pair of dark sunglasses. "Hey Jim. Looking stylish," John teases. Jim doesn't respond. Because he's often does the same thing, John reaches up and gently takes the sunglasses off.
Sherlock glances around for a minute, checking for the location of the others. Seeing his mother and Lestrade down one of the paths in Mycroft's ginormous garden, admiring the various flowers, he tells her the truth. "He accidentally overdosed on heat suppressants. He took nine times the recommended amount."
After a bit of thought, Sherlock selects the same room he was in before. It was comfortable, close to the kitchen for easy access to food, relatively easy to protect, and still smelled of him; all of which his Omega took to equate to safety.
"What did you want our children to call you?"
"Not to worry, you'll meet him soon. Not today, though. He's got a grand revealing planned for you and your mate, and that takes time to stage."
He's so angry that he almost misses the fact that the door to 221B is open a tiny bit. Well, that's not all right. Someone is breaking into his flat and disturbing his nest and he's already angry. He pulls out a slip of paper and quickly leaves a note for John whenever he deems to come home 'Crime in progress. Please disturb.' He shoves the door open and barges his way inside, cerulean eyes roaming wildly while he deduces. His first matter of concern is Mrs. Hudson, so that is where he automatically looks first. Her flat is obviously empty, and the scratch on the wall concerns him. It's possible she left that scratch, trying to fight off attackers who were carrying her up the stairs. He trails his finger over it, fitting his own fingernail in. It's the perfect size. His eyes dart up the stairs as he imagines her desperately screaming for his help. With no further ado, he hurries up the stairs and enters his own flat.
"Just Mycroft."
"I know, John. I know." He pulls me into his arms, smoothing a hand over my hair. "It's alright."
Sherlock’s entire demeanor changes instantly. “Yes! I dug it out of a garbage bin. Her phone is missing, which means she planted it on the killer. I was thinking we should go to a restaurant and bait the killer into coming so we can see who they are!”
“Yes, as soon as you’re cleared to travel.”
"We'll figure it out," Sherlock promises.
He pulls Sherlock to him and kisses him soundly, completely ignoring the twin sounds of gagging from Anderson and Donovan.
He is going over to Mrs. Hudson immediately. "Oh, Mrs. Hudson," he says, so gently, "my God, are you alright?" he asks as he sits down next to their still-crying landlady. "Jesus-" John begins, and Sherlock realizes he is trembling with rage, and about thirty seconds away from turning into a wolf and ripping the American limb to limb. And while that would be pleasant to see, it doesn't fit in with Sherlock's plan to make the man suffer, because that would be entirely too quick.
John hears the man's footsteps behind him, and turns to meet the gaze of the man he stabbed. "Interesting," the man breathes, surprise visible on his face. "You're his soulmate." John nods tersely. "Well come on, then. You'll catch a cold standing out here." John's legs unlock and he follows the man back in the house. This simple fact alone tells him a few more things. The man is probably a family member of Sherlock's, because he can counteract Sherlock's orders. He's the leader of his pack, the Head Alpha, though Sherlock is certainly in the pack too. The man holds the door open and John ducks under the man's arm, spine tingling as he tenses for a hit. It never comes.
In that moment, he hears a car pull up to the curb outside. Footsteps alight and stop at the door for just a moment before continuing on. He can feel John's concern for him through their bond. So then, his mate is home. Lucky for the American, John's presence has literally saved this stupid man's life.
“That I can’t tell you,” Mycroft answers. “But I’m sure Sherlock can figure it out. Good day gentlemen, and Sherlock do remember to lock up prior to leaving.” The video screen vanishes and Sherlock is left staring blankly at the desktop once more.
"No," he responds. "No, I wouldn't ask you to change. To make your experiments upstairs, perhaps, where a baby couldn't get into them, but no, I wouldn't want you to stop doing them completely. As soon as you stop your experiments, you almost become someone else. Sherlock Holmes is a crazy erratic madman. He's a Consulting Detective and a scientist, an experimenter and a mortician. He's my mate and the father of my child, I love him, and for the life of me I would never want him to be anything other than happy, no matter what he's doing. And your experiments make you happy. I know they do. I wouldn't want you to sacrifice that for me."
It's testament to how tired Mycroft is that he doesn't immediately correct what she says. Instead, his brow furrows and he looks confused. "Where will you go?"
He hates his father for not bonding with his mother, ensuring that (since she has a soulmate that won't bond with her) she has to listen to him. He hates that his father has destroyed the romantic notion of a soulmate that he's taught at school. Most of all, he hates that his father's treatment ensures he will never have a soulmate, because he's too afraid of being beaten.
“No, I told you, it was dark.” Sherlock throws off the orange shock blanket that the paramedics keep trying to tuck around him. “Why are they giving me this? I’m not in shock!”
"Sit down!" John orders in his Captain voice. Sherlock's eyes widen and he slides back into his seat. "Sorry," John says, realizing he's scared the boy. "I just don't want you to fall."
A few hours later, they are awake again. Mycroft stretches out the kinks in his back, mumbling soft complaints under his breath. Then he takes his leave and Sherlock and John are left alone in the flat again.
"Is that what you want?" Sherlock asks, suddenly tense, bolting up from the table so he can meet John's eyes.
"To burn a Christmas tree on Christmas Day is probably sacrilegious," Mycroft retorts. "But yes, a lovely idea just the same. Perhaps I'll even dance around it as well."
"I refuse to rely on your brother for everything. We can get groceries ourselves. Besides, it's not right to make your brother get our groceries for us."
This is Jim's cue, and he senses it too, because a moment later he melts from the shadows like a demon summoned from the depths of hell, repeating his monologue about being offended by not being recognized. Posturing done, he grins menacingly at Sherlock. "Is that a Browning L9A1 in your pocket, or are you just pleased to see me?"
“Hey, it’s alright,” John soothes. “Just refresh the screen.”
Once I arrive at our old campsite I realize how much pain I'm in physically. My leg and ribs are screaming for me to stop running, shaking enough that I finally collapse into a pile of snow. With a lot of effort I drag myself out of the snow and inside of a hollowed out log. As I do it starts to snow, and I don't have my jacket. I just lay there and shiver and cry. This is my retribution, this is what I deserve for hurting those I love.
