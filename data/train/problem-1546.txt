‘In truth, I fear I don’t quite trust my voice at the moment.’ –MH
Sherlock blinked not understanding what the impossible woman wanted now until she held her hand out toward him. “No. Absolutely not.”
It would be simple to merely pretend that he never opened it, yet he couldn’t just get rid of the box. Even if he had tried to take it back, Sherlock had sent it initially, wanted John to have it. Or at least that’s what John had told himself as an excuse to keep it.
Sebastian ran a hand through his hair as he took in a deep breath, “I’m done. That’s it, I’m done.” He kept his voice calm and proceeded to take his rifle apart to hide it in the contents of a large duffle bag along with a handful of knives laying around.
John jolted upright in the darkened room tucked into the midnight blue scarf. A cold sweat ran down his face. His hands instinctively ran through his hair, down his neck, with his left hand stopping where the bullet had left him a nasty scar.
John meanwhile, had tried his hardest to kick out the closet door, but the damn thing was sturdier then expected. He had paused several times, being as silent as he could in the desperate hope that he might hear Sherlock’s voice again. But it never came. He wanted more then anything to believe that he really had heard it before, but if that was true, where had he gone?
Everyone John had ever known came to visit him in the hospital after that. He knew they all knew exactly why he was there. None of them asked him, they all pretended to be in good spirits and that ‘everything would be ok.’ At least death would have saved him this embarrassment.
“Simple enough? And you are a big cuddle slut cat, there is no way you could stop.”
John smiled at the very ‘
“It’s a blind experiment. Just drink it. Please?”
Sherlock brought the egg over, cutting off a small piece for John, which was very large for him by comparison. Sherlock ate the rest, never being one for a big appetite.
Sherlock looked back up, John was
“Good, I’m good. Say I was wondering-“
“I suppose that’s the best I can expect from you. But if you wait too long, you may be on your own.” Mycroft warned before leaving.
“Agh! What are you doing?”
John had a fantastic nap. There were no drugs, no hypnotism, and nothing homosexual happened. Although if Tennant had made an appearance John likely wouldn’t have minded. It was all fine.
“N-no… no, it’s not ok Lock… it’s not…” John had started sobbing.
The lower tentacle on his waist had let go entirely, the tip now sneaking down into his trousers. Greg wanted to thrash about to stop it, but he couldn’t risk it. Just another moment, that was all he needed it. He swirled his tongue around Mycroft, knowing it might just be the finishing touch he needed to get all those damn things off him.
John didn’t think his day could drag on any longer, Wednesdays were hell, he had calculus first thing in the morning which he often found himself nodding off during these past few weeks due to his late nights, then political science just after noon. All he could do was think of his unexpected present from his strange friend. It really did seem like a waist to let such an item go unused… John snapped out of his thoughts, he had completely zoned out in the middle of his teacher’s lecture. He tried reminding himself that he wasn’t even interested in that sort of thing, only girls and a good old fashioned wank than you very much. But he found he couldn’t help but wonder what it must be like, after all, there seemed to be a lot of people that did seem to enjoy, perhaps he was being too rash in not giving it a try first.
John watched his screen waiting for the following text to come. It seemed to take longer then the rate at which all the other messages came. Just as he thought Sherlock might have nodded off before texting back his phone buzzed.
The detective’s phone pinged a moment later.
Sherlock stepped back inside the flat slamming the door behind him, A look of satisfied triumph on his face, not only had he gotten rid of John's date for the night, he had likely ruined all future dates between them as well. The unexpected sound of the door slamming caused John to loose his balance again, two steps later he fell into the hole, it was too dark to tell at first, but it went straight down the wall.
-Hacking
John crossed his arms and looked away, his mumble barely audible. “Ten”
“Tobby! Down boy.” John sprinted over and began rubbing the monster’s ear.
Sherlock looked back at him momentarily, ‘
“You think far too loud.”
Sherlock let out a heavy sigh but continued on. Having no idea where he was going or which way was home was driving him mad. “Well, you could at least take my hand.” He huffed.
Sherlock gave a confused look. “That’s selfishness, not sentiment.”
Sherlock abruptly cut him off finally finding his voice, “It’s not ok John! It’s not natural and you probably think I’m sort of freak now- which I probably am- and… stop looking at me like that!”
"Oh hush, you are perfectly safe" Sherlock could feel John clingy fiercely to his fingers for support. Sherlock sighed, "I apologize, you're safe okay?" He could feel John's body relax a bit in his hands.
“Just breath, try to calm down. It wasn’t… there’s no one there now.” John corrected himself. He still wasn’t entirely sure himself what they had just seen. Perhaps it really was… no, John couldn’t let himself start thinking like that.
“I can’t play. My arms are too short.”
“So beautiful.” Mycroft purred. His mate was entirely splayed open for him and even begging for more. He had no idea why his whole body had wanted him to fill Greg with that fluid. But he had to more then he needed to breath. He began thrusting the tentacles in and out at different times, so Greg’s prostate would always be assaulted. Greg was soaked, which was more erotic then anything Mycroft would have ever imagined. His strokes sped up as he could feel Gregory’s body convulsing from sheer pleasure. His legs hardly able to keep himself up anymore.
Lestrade glowered at her, he had enough of her mocking Sherlock while working, and now that he had died, he sure as hell wasn’t about to tolerate her saying anything against John. “Never you mind him. What do you mean there’s no body.”
"Damn, I've twisted it."
Sherlock eyed him thoughtfully.
“You said I could pick anything I like.” ‘
Lestrade was absolutely about to jump out of his own skin. He quickly straightened his tie, as if that somehow made a difference. “No, no, not at all… I’m not even sure what-” John had this obnoxiously knowing look. “Its just business. He likes to discuss things over food sometimes, is all.”
Mycroft turned to face her, "A what?" his voice skeptical but cautious.
John had gotten to work researching everything he could find on ghosts on the internet- which ended up mostly being creepy pasta and blatantly fake videos on youtube. Both of which were extremely unhelpful. Even more distressing somehow, were the dozens of sights and rituals he had found on ‘vanishing’ ghosts from ones home. They could have at least said ‘help pass on’, but no, they said ‘vanish’, like Sherlock was some unwanted pest.
The cab stopped and both men got out, John clenched his fist and avoided eye contact with Sherlock as he had to pull his wallet out his sparkly silver purse to pay the cabbie. His eyes were still downcast as he strode up to the door of 221B and said in a low voice “Not a word of this to anyone.”
John’s eyes snapped open, they were mere centimeters apart now, Sherlock had definitely moved close on his own but now his eyes were down cast like before.
“You’re not listening.” Sherlock frowned.
John paused for a moment, his hand feeling strange as he reached for the knob and turned. He reminded himself that he had to go to work and stop waiting for a man that would never come home. John walked outside, inhaling deeply. It wasn’t as bad as he thought it might be.
“What? Me? Oh, no! No- I’m just- it’s fine is all- I’ve never… I mean, not that I wouldn’t, just that I’ve never really considered-“
-Shut up XD –
John’s eyes widened, “That’s why Mycroft…”
“Not sure where we are yet. My perspective is rather off in this state.”
There in the center of the nearly destroyed flat was the man that had set the whole thing off. Sherlock looked up, hair overgrown and in a mess, clothes torn to shreds.
John was curled up on the ground in a fetal position, arms blocking his already bruised face, the boy still kneeling at him hitting anything he could. Sherlock kicked him under the chin, sending the boy reeling backwards with quite a deal of pain.
Molly ran to his side, trying to calm him as well. He couldn’t explain it, but John knew he could feel Sherlock around him, trying to calm him. Eventually John caught his breath, most of his tears dried now.
Greg remained where he was completely confused.
Sherlock made large strides back and forth across the cold metal table where the deceased body of the woman from the lake house lay.
Sherlock smiled, he took his feat as an accomplishment of his intelligence, “Of course. John?”
“What are you getting at?”
Mycroft held his umbrella firmly and cautiously approached the dollhouse. He was slightly surprised to find John had already accepted moving into it, but then there was his very rumpled hair and clothes to take in. His eyes softened, but his overall form remained stiff. "Lestrade's phone is off…" he had a hard time looking John in the eyes. "Scotland Yard has been looking for him."
That night Lestrade waited hidden outside of 221B waiting for John to get back from work like usual. Unlike usual, John never came home. The next few weeks John sporadically spent one to two days away from the flat at a time. Mycroft searched everywhere on his CCTV cams but could never find him anywhere in London on those nights. It was as if he had completely vanished.
“No John, I said they all either wear off or are reversible. This isn’t the wear off kind.”
Sherlock wanted badly to protest this comment.
“Um… uh… you have a…” John pointed to the new limb.
“Fuck you. You did this. You gave Moriarty all he needed! For what?! You know he only gave you lies and you sold out your own brother!”
There was a knock on the bathroom door. "Finished?"
“I really need to test this one and you don’t have anything else to do today, I just thought it would be best to get it over with and have it out of the way, or should I need to make any more changes to it I would be able to do so in a timely fashion.”
He wanted to tell himself that this was all an elaborate prank on Mycroft’s behalf, but a deeper part of him knew that it was far from it. He played back the conversation in his head from the day before.
"Working on it. But I should probably inform you that today is Monday."
“and… this ‘promise’?”
“What work?”
John clutched at his pillow without opening his eyes. “I said half an hour.” Knowing that was the approximate time it should take for Sherlock to be cat and leave him alone.
It’s funny, you know my dorm address but I have no idea where you are. –
“How do you know they aren’t?”
“Thank you Dr Watson, you have no idea how much this means to me.” Daniel looked as though he were on the verge of tears. “I don’t want to be a failure of a land lord as well.”
“She wont be. She’s not Maria’s type, besides, Molly’s practically invisible, no one ever looks twice at her. Mouse of a women.”
Only half paying attention, Lestrade stopped his search momentarily and stood, seeing the boat right away.
Really now brother, you should be more careful with your possessions. Did he fall out of your pocket?-MH
“That’s cheating, and no one would believe me, I’m not the genius detective- you are. And you’re not just invisible- YOU’RE NAKED.”
“and now he’s… we have to find him now!”
Mycroft was about to leave his brother’s flat when his phone chimed.
Sherlock nodded. “Its… nice. Better then air, honestly. Also, I think mermaids are only female.”
I’ll keep that in mind –
Difficult? –JW
“Oh who cares? I stopped minding and John loves them.” Sherlock nipped at the beige sweater.
"The killer? I would hardly think he would willingly stroll into Scotland Yard."
“Oh don’t think I’ve forgotten about you now Johnny boy. I could always squish you to death, but the thought of having you smeared under my beautiful designer shoes is horrifying.” Moriarty made a mock scared face. “Sebbie! Do that thing you do when you get rid of a bug for me. You know when I catch one in a cup and you flip it upside down? We’ll need to bring Johnny boy with us after all if we want to have some fun.
“Obviously not if I’m standing here now. Where is John?”
“Your limbs will stay in place. Look.” Sherlock grabbed John’s torso and lifted him into a sitting position. He slumped over slightly but remained relatively upright.
“Oh you! It’s so is a date!”
He waited patiently for them to leave. For the staff to turn the lights off and think he was asleep. Then, when the time was just right, he slipped out. John wasn’t sure if it was cruel fate or luck that brought him to St. Barts hospital after the pills, really Mycroft and Lestrade should have known better. He creeped through the halls and up the rickety stairway to the roof. It was dark, so much unlike that morning months ago when the morning light nearly blinded him as he looked at the roof. Blood still stained the ground where Moriarty had fallen. The ledge was inviting. John stepped closer to it. He could practically sense Sherlock’s presence around him. Soon he thought.
“I’m not straight. Gay! I’m not gay!” This was worse then the cat experiment.
“Trying to stimulate the muscle. Should speed things up. I had hoped to move onto a new experiment today. I don’t like delays.”
“There’s a bagelry two streets down from here, I’ve never been to it but when there’s a strong southern wind I can smell it quite well from my window.”
Sputtering water out Sherlock immediately sat up, drenched, in Lestrade’s hands. “John! Find John!” he coughed painfully.
-Sure you did.-
Molly also pulled out a flashlight with a particularly sensitive button to turn it on, a Polaroid camera, and a Hasbro Company Ouija board.
"To be fair he doesn't know why anyone dates."
There in the door way stood a tall silhouette. “I worried you might not come.” The voice seemed to buzz inside Greg’s head in an unnatural way.
"That was hardly my fault, those chemicals really shouldn't have reacted that way, I think Ms. Hudson might have switched the labels-"
The knock continued.
Lestrade ripped his over coat off and plunged into the lake, he knew from a case over a year ago that Sherlock couldn’t swim- and even if he or John could, there chances of making it back to land were rather limited give their size and the height of the lake’s small wakes compared to them. Of course searching for two five inch people in a murky lake was only matched by that ridiculous cliché’ about a needle and a haystack.
John hated the way she said ‘real life,’ as if anything that happened online wasn’t real. Sherlock was real, he was his friend, John just simply hasn’t met him in person yet.
The slits opened and closed on their own in a rythmatic pattern. John looked at the wall clock. Sherlock still hadn’t come up for air, but he could see his eyes were watching him through the water.
“Ah, of course,” something seemed off, Mycroft had never checked up on Sherlock this much in all the time Lestrade had known them. “Well, the barrowers are in the morgue looking over a body- Molly’s supervising.”
“You did.”
“No, not this time. Uhm… what looks good on me?” the awkwardness was very audible in his voice.
“Could you control any of that?” Greg drew back, doing what he could to try and read Mycroft’s features. His eyes had returned completely back to normal.
Sherlock tried to avoid eye contact. “You haven’t said it yet.”
Chapter 7
“Not yet…”
A young boy dressed shabbily straightened his back at the sight of the odd man and shoved a glass jar inside his jacket as the detective caught his breath.
“Hm?” The detective stopped passing for just a moment and continued again, “Very mild transformation, hardly a big deal really.”
“Hey now! Don’t you start with me Tobby!”
“Don’t give John more reason to want out for a look about.” He smiled before returning his attention back to the corpse. “This one is different. The past victims have all died by poison, minimal effort was put into the act it’s self. This one… “
“Also came to check on the state of my brother.” There was a hint of annoyance in his eyes.
“Sherlock, door.” John was still amusing himself with the literally hundreds of comments his blog now had from people he didn’t even know congratulating him and claiming they knew this would happen.
He thought back to the awkward events that had just taken place. ‘
John shrugged, “A gang of fishermen?”
“Just hold on, I don’t even-“
“You wont lose me,” Mycroft’s voice softened a bit at that as he stepped closer, cornering Greg in.
Sherlock's smile fell, "I'd take very good care of you and you could still help me on cases. Sure typing your blog might become a bit difficult but…"
At 2am John quietly jumped on Sherlock bed and found his way under the covers. Sherlock woke up the next morning with the tabby sleeping on his chest.
John brought a fist up to stiffen his laughter but it still came through. “You’re too short for that. You’ll have to jump.” He lost all control and buckled his knees so he was on the floor.
"John!? John! Where are you?" There was no sign of him.
“Myc?!” Was he really in there after all? This wasn’t just some shape shifting who-knows-what in his shape?
Sherlock was still proud that John was catching onto how to deduce things. He had never tried teaching the art to anyone else, he thought it was above the mental capacities of
“Nonsense, I’ll have my driver take you.”
John shot up from his bed in a cold sweat. His heart was pounding so loudly in his ears he could barely make out what his tent mate was saying to him.
Another body lay dead in the center of a dance floor. The club was a massive two story place and the manager was insisting the place didn’t need to be shut down for the night and his patrons didn’t need to be bothered with this information.
Sherlock immediately went into a scowl. “Why?!”
The following day Sherlock and John showed up at a crime scene happier then anyone had ever seen them.
One down.
"Is something wrong?"
“Perhaps,” Sherlock seemed unsure. He let out a little growl, what was he even thinking, the odds of it happening seemed utterly impossible. And yet… what Mycroft had showed him had left him speechless. If it was true, if he was in fact what he feared he could be, he would of course have to tell John. There would be no other way around it if he wanted to keep him as a friend. Besides, there was no reason to believe he was dangerous, it was just Mycroft over reacting again.
That was a great blow to the former military doctor. “  I- I! “ He goes silent for a moment thinking. “I help.”
Something clicks in Ella’s head. “John, how many friends do you have?”
“Right… Sherlock, I just would really like to be able to move again, so if there is anything, anything at all that you could do.”
-What are you doing!! There are Orks over there and you’re going to get yourself killed!!-
“It’s quite alright Gregory. I can manage on my own.” His voice remained emotionless; only a hint condescending.
“It’s obvious really, I mean I can’t believe your team hasn’t figured all of that out by now.”
It’s cute when you do that. –
John huffed, “I wouldn’t just write it off like-”
John cleared his throat loudly. Thank goodness Lestrade had offered to spend the night with him, not that he wanted to admit that he was already getting spooked. But now that ghosts were more then something in a cheesy horror film to him, he didn’t really want to find out if there were vile spirits floating around the world. Especially in bedrooms he planned on sleeping in. “Well, I’m sure it will all be sorted out soon enough.”
Lestrade frowned and pointedly closed the donut box. “I am Not binge eating.” He cleared his throat a bit, “Besides, I would worry about anyone who turns into a hermit and disappears during storms.”
And here, take this” Lestrade leaned back inside the car for a moment to grab Sherlock’s coat and handed it to Molly, “See if you can find anything interesting on this.”
“Yes?”
John still didn't want to go, but the idea of being trapped on the table all day with no food and nothing to do was unbearable.
“Mate… uh, what are you doing?”
“You’re certainly dressed up nice.”
“So, what are you up to?”
Moriarty’s smile flattened a bit, “In due time.” He cocked his gun. “You could help me with that you know.”
John briefly considered blocking one of the doorways with furniture but when he remembered how firmly the first spider pinned him he realized the flimsy wood would never be enough to stop them.
John guided a woman inside, his voice noticeably softer with this woman then with his other patients. Sherlock quickly noticed the thick black glasses and walking stick. Blind. He lolled his head back, already getting bored with John’s job.
“I have and I did.”
“Which you did without a shred of refusal.” Sherlock purred into the crook of John’s neck. His voice deepened into its deep baritone, “And then you got an erect-“
“Fantastic,” Maria’s voice was eerily cold and collected, “How about you take a seat and I grab the papers? Just to review of course.”
He was only a meter away when Mycroft stepped out with his damn umbrella tapping the ground.
Sherlock kneeled to analyze it. "It's been stabbed through…"
Mycroft glanced down at his watch 11:55pm. He knew he was too worried about Sherlock to sleep tonight. “Alright,”
Sherlock began walking the perimeter; John refused to go near it. “Lock, get back here this instant! You are not going inside!”
“What’s this?”
“Well there isn’t anything I can bloody do about it is there?” it felt like they had gone several kilometers, and comparatively probably had, but he knew they probably had only gone half of one.
The door opening caught Moriarty off guard, he notice the shaking lamp next to him until it hit his arm. The gun fell and slid across the sleek wooden floor. Sherlock reached out to grab him by the shirt collar but the shaking ground gave him just enough time to slide by Mycroft and towards the door.
Dr. Vure nodded accordingly, “Well I know this must be a bit boring compared to the war-“
That doesn’t mean you like men. –
Lestrade had finished grabbing the few items and sticking them in a duffel bag. Hopefully it would just be a nice calm night with John. He turned to look at the flat.
Sherlock stopped his fork midair before getting a second bite, “Yes?”
“No, I’m fine. I’ll just meet you back at the station.”
“We have to get to St Bart’s, it’s the only place he can’t get in. But then you have to leave me…” John’s voice had gone quiet; he looked as though he was on the verge of a mental breakdown.
"Maria…" John had completely forgotten about his date that night. "Sherlock! You have to get rid her!"
“Fit’s the MO, short, blond, attractive.”
“Where did you go today?”
John clicked the green call button, it would be better to do this face to face.
“Well I don’t see a body anywhere.” He lifted one of the only remaining pieces of wood up and immediately jumped back with yelp. “Holy mother of god!”
John had nerves of steel. That or he was an idiot. Sherlock smiled sheepishly as John drank the cup and swallowed the small pill.
Molly was visibly flustered by the strange way Sherlock was acting, he was always strange of course so she tried to brush it off. Then it hit her. Sherlock looked as if he was sitting at the table doing nothing. He didn't have his eyes closed with a strained expression, so he wasn't thinking deeply about anything, but whenever he wasn't thinking he was certainly always busy.
"A Mr. Ganahl would like to invite you to bid on something. He says it may be of scientific interest to you."
“You left your phone on the ground, you never go anywhere without it. And bloody hell, Sherlock,” He put his hand to the detective’s forehead. “You’re burning up!”
Sherlock smiled lightly at that, all the while avoiding eye contact with the two.
John rolled his eyes. “Do you seriously think I’m going to just take your word for it?”
“Hang on!” thinking fast, John tried undoing the string of the sails so he could pass it down to Sherlock, he wasn’t fast enough.
John winced, unsure of how he felt.
“Uh, Lock…”
“So… I mean, what else did you try?”
“Why what? You’re going to have to be more specific then that.” The detective hoped John’s observation skills were still sub par, but they weren’t.
“No worries, is that the girl you’re trying to impress?” She nodded towards the phone.
He knew that night he would need a good raid to get his mind off school and the war.
“Faked my death, dull. Why would he run away because of you?”
“Yes, obviously lovers, this was likely a hate crime. Probably someone who didn’t frequent the area much but had stalked these two to this spot.”
"Well Lestrade is right, this is a lesbian bar. I recognize the unusual architecture from the background of some of Harry's photographs." He stood on his toes to get a better look over the pocket. "Scratches? ' Lock, do see that scratch on her wrist?"
“I’m coming with you.” John grabbed a coat. If Sherlock was around, which he likely was, he hoped he joined them. It seemed possible at least if Sherlock really was in his office at the hospital the other day.
“Please don’t tell me the emergency was that you were bored. You know I have to go to therapy Sherlock.” The latter part of what he said sounded forced in his mind.
John opened both eyes and rolled over until he was pressed against Sherlock’s side. “You like this scarf.” He elongated the sentence for emphasis.
So why did you- John had started to typed before another message was sent.
“What if I’m stuck like this?”
“Fine. Just fine. Listen-“ John pulled Sherlock aside, “Could you just, you know, tell me what’s going to happen at least?”
Sherlock laid his hand over John’s, John felt suddenly cold but didn’t move.
John’s worry subsided a bit at that, so it was just some sickness he was prone to or something along those lines. “Its still better to have someone help take care of you then to be on your own, isn’t it?”
“I know you don’t quite understand these things and… that’s ok, Lock. It really is. But Greg- he- Mycroft-” John felt like such an idiot. Why was this so bloody hard?
“Here! We’re here!” John nearly jumped out of the cab and paid the cabbie.
experiment.”
“Hmm.”
London actually. Opposite side from you. –
“Not exactly evidence that a crime took place here.” Sally pointed out.
“Nope, nope, I rather have no idea then have you lie about it frankly. But you can at least look me in the eye and tell me I wont be mad at you for it and it was for a good reason.”
“G’night Jawn.” He yawned.
Sherlock made a note and showed the following similar image.
“Of course not. Wouldn’t you and Mycroft be the first to know if I was?” the words had some venom behind them.
“I have no idea what your are talking about. Helping solve cases for the Yard help Sherlock pay the rent. I’m not some degenerate who gets off on seeing dead bodies if that’s what you think.”
“Don’t try to distract me, I already figured that word out-“
-Sure. ;)-
Whether his friend was aware of it or not, John simply could not do
“No… I- I never lied to him.”
He quickly shook the thought that it was an excuse to see him out of his mind.
There was an awkward pause.
“Molly? Seriously?” Greg rubbed his forehead as he exhaled slowly. “One of my best and smartest forensics brought a Ouija board over to your house?” He really did not want to have to talk to her about this.
"Please find an antidote Sherlock." John's voice was filled with worry.
Sherlock’s cat ears flattened against his hair, “What are you talking about?”
“Sherlock… If…. If you’re some how really there, I need you to listen to me. You need something of yours. Some item that maybe you had a connection to before. It might help you, er… ‘manifest’.” This sounded bloody insane. “It could help you communicate maybe.”
“I don’t understand, all of our stuff his still here. He never even got rid of my things. The apartment has obviously still been paid for but judging by the dust level no one has been here in at least two months. Where is John?”
Sherlock lay horizontally across the foot of John’s bed in his blue bathrobe with his tail sticking out. “ ‘M comfy.”
, and lifted him closer to the body.
“I don’t know, she’s alright. That’s not the point.”
“Well, it would be preferable if you didn’t date any more women.” Sherlock had no idea how to word what he wanted from John but luckily at this the doctor’s face softened a bit.
“Oh brother… when will you learn? You think you know him but how could you? He thinks you’re someone that you’re not.”
“Ah, that must be Lestrade” Sherlock brought out his own phone in an attempt to mask the evidence against his flatmate.
“The hypnotism experiment…”
"I don't think Hannah had any enemies. So you'll help me then?"
“Dearest Sherlock- hope you don’t mind I borrowed it, I can think of so many fun possibilities.” Lestrade cringed as he read it out loud.
“This is one of the weirdest things I’ve ever done.” At first John thought it was weird to scratch and pet his flatmate but after a few minutes it became strangely fun and he could swear the low baritone rumble vibrating the couch was Sherlock purring.
He would have to work that out later.
“Mm, you really did actually.”
John cringed inside his skull barrier. Harry had picked on him constantly as they grew up and she was no better now that they were both in their 30's.
Once again Sherlock struggled against his restraints. Bolts kept the legs of the chair pinned to the cement floor. He tried jerking his feet to break the chair legs but he didn’t have enough leverage from where the rope tied his legs down.
“You should have killed me,” Mycroft buried his face in Greg’s chest. How could he ever meet that man’s eyes again?
Ella gave a very irritated glare, “It doesn’t matter when other students go to sleep, it matters when you do. What about this internet person you met? He’s he still the reason why you’re playing this ‘game’ online?”
“Hard to say, but I wouldn’t imagine so. He’s worried about you though, I know that.”
John was still trying to think of a reasonable explanation ‘
Not everyone was worth telling.
?' John pondered on Donovan's phrase as he dipped back into Sherlock's pocket.
“J-John…?”
“I’ve had enough of your shit! I don’t have to work for you.”
Sherlock’s phone started chiming from his coat pocket left in the other room. “I forgot about the case! I said I’d be there… oh that can’t be right, an hour and a half ago? There’s no conceivable way I let you pet me for that long…” he quickly sat up looking at a clock.
“Well at least we can say you are inconclusively gay now.”
“John! John!! You’re not even listening to me deduce!” Sherlock grabbed John’s arm only then noticing the awkward stance between his blogger and the D.I.
“Well, I did text you as an experiment to see if your morals for your therapists rules were greater then your loyalty to me.” He smiled as he realized he had won the wager.
Greg stepped in the doorway with a chuckle, “You two wont like this.” He dropped his hand in his pocket and waited till he felt both men sitting in his palm and brought them out.
“Just a magic trick…” John mumbled to himself, suddenly the odd phrasing Sherlock had used through out their last conversation was starting to make sense. “He lied to me!? He stood there on that building making me think the worst when he was….” Except that wasn’t how it had panned out. John’s sudden outburst was only made all the more awkward by the silence that followed it. “So… What happened? What went wrong?
"No games, I just want to find my brother."
“Tobby, dinner.” As soon as the deep baritone voice called out the cat leaped up and began dashing through the park and then down a thankfully empty street. Sherlock’s grip tightened around John.
They could hear her heels clicking about in the hall just outside.
John hesitantly put his other hand under the table between them and on Sherlock’s knee. “You can feel now though.” He leaded closer.
“John?” He could hear his own voice buzzing strangely, as if it was cutting through sound waves in a different manner.
John blinked. They had a whole kitchen full of stuff. “Are you hungry? I could make you something to eat now if you like?”
"Finish that sentence and I will strangle you in your sleep!" John's voice was so loud that Harry turned around expecting to see him standing right behind her.
Maybe he could…
Sherlock Holmes died.
Lestrade who had been quietly observing John straightened up and flushed faintly. “Sorry mate.”
No worries, you’re probably bored out of your mind without your computer eh? –JW
John's entire body froze as a rustling came from behind him. The movement was fast but he was sure of it. John had dread this moment since he first realized what had caused the hole he was trapped in. Leaning on his good leg he held his toothpick out as a weapon. The rustling started again, closer this time and slowly drew near. John prayed for lighting to show him the tunnel again. His heart pounded fiercely in his chest as his breaths quickened. At the finale moment before the damp hair spiked creature lunged at him lightning illuminated on them allowing John to prepare his ill suited wooden 'sword'. It plunged through the rat on it's first blow but did not kill it. The rat slashed a claw at John's face, he successfully dodged but it nicked his left shoulder. Rolling beneath the thrashing rat to get away from it's fangs he grabbed the base of the toothpick twisting it deeper inside the creature causing a grotesque squeal to escape it. It's furless tail whipped around and soon it's teeth were nipping far too close to John again. With the speed of a soldier John daringly reached under the rat to pull the toothpick out and within second of being mauled he thrust it through the beast's mouth penetrating the brain. The grey form slumped down as the small man felt it's sticky liquid on his hands and arms.
“895 Doyle Ave.”
-I thought you would be on earlier. Raid?-
Sherlock scoffed, “Obviously not or it wouldn’t be straight like this. The muscles are just completely relaxed.”
“I can make you some toast with jam” Sherlock’s hand started to pull away so he could find food.
“No reason. Just don’t get too drunk around him, he could dirty your good name.” He winked.
“I’ll get you out. Don’t panic.”
Mycroft was shoved against the doorway, his breath leaving him for a moment as he was winded. He bared his teeth, clearly furious now. Greg hadn’t found anything on him in his moment and decided to quickly run for it, perhaps there was a window somewhere he could smash through. But as he attempted to turn tail and run, something quickly coiled around his ankle and tripped him, sending him smashing into the floor and dragged back wards.
Sally looked up, “What, the closet?” She was sure the police earlier would have looked, but they had heard that strange noise. She cautiously opened the door, relieved to find no one inside. “Its just some old rope?”
John was agitated. “Well… I didn’t want to say this but, I should probably you know… get more clothes. It’s already been three days now and…” his voice trailed off.
Mycroft caved, “Dr. Watson, would you mind if-” and of course Sherlock couldn’t resist cutting him off.
“You’re not. Now take your clothes off.”
“This could still be a coincidence you know.” Lestrade tried to reassure the red haired man.
That night Mrs. Hudson found a check for three months rent in advance. She tried calling John to ask about it, but his phone had been put out of service.
“John?” Sherlock’s voice was a faint whisper, breath ghosting against his flatmate’s mouth.
“Maybe you didn’t drink enough of it…” Sebastian tried to reason.
Then John does something Sherlock couldn’t understand at first. Something that would break him.
Sherlock looked away awkwardly before giving the D.I. a confirming nod.
Chapter 3
The attacker chocked and wheezed before gaining just enough breath to talk in a hoarse whisper, “Just a message.”
“Ah, see he’s gone through it already.” Daniel grinned, figuring that meant they would investigate the case after all. The contents of the box were scattered across the table, pictures of previous occupants of the flat put out and a disk labeled ‘security footage’ sitting on the edge of the table.
A small moan like sound escaped John before coughing up a fit of blood and laying still in attempt to reduce the pain.
John blinked for a moment, “Wait, this /Victor/ guy, was he-“
It was early Monday morning, John didn’t have work that day, the hospital had given him shorter hours and better pay- he knew Sarah had done it as a pathetic attempt to make his life seem better and thus worth living. John did something he thought he would never do again, he called Lestrade and asked if there were any knew cases.
“Not that I know of.” Sherlock had no idea this was going to happen, his brother had certainly never warned him about it. “Maybe.”
“I’m sorry, you want to learn how to hack into someone’s computer? why?” Molly was use to eating lunch alone at school days, she was surprised when John walked in and started talking to her.
Sherlock tilted his head in thought, he was certainly not the first person to ever die, so where was everyone else? He had spent the past two days in unnecessary hiding, but on his way to the flat…. Sherlock blinked rapidly. He couldn’t recall now how exactly he had gotten here after his fall. He wasn’t even sure how his plan had gone awry ending in his death.
‘I hope you found the Café Renaud to your liking’. –MH
Sherlock snickered.
John released a nervous breath. “This might sound a bit nuts, but” He picked up the salt container again. “Its not like it will do any harm to leave a line of salt in front of the closet.”
-My hand?-
Sherlock straightened himself back and glared at the offending rope near by. He had his own item to give him energy now and it was high time he used it.
A loud pounding came from Sherlock’s bedroom door. John peered behind Sherlock’s back wondering if this meant he would be seeing the irritating sod of a brother his friend was always going on about.
Athea grimaced but wasn't fully detoured yet. "A man claims he has something that might be of interest to you."
"Oh, so I must be gay if I don't want to stick around as you cheat on me? Is that it?"
"Really John, you haven't even considered all the positive possibilities of being… small."
Get better grades. :) –SH
John gripped the dresser harder, his whole body feeling strange and numb. His head jerked to the side, almost as though someone had forcibly moved his head in that direction. He felt like he might panic at any moment, but as he blinked he realized something. There was a thin door. A closet door most likely. The numb feeling suddenly left him. “Have you guys check in there?”
John huffed and crossed his arms over his chest. He was wearing a ridiculous yellow raincoat, boots, and a hat. “Maybe I just didn’t want to get soaking wet. Your coat is going to get drenched.”
Sherlock smiled. “You’ve been rather…
“The roof isn’t that high off the ground, there’s a drug that-“
“I thought you might. Take care.” Unknown Sender.
"Lestrade, I don't miss things, he's not in there."
“High tension, trouble sleeping, and nightmares.”
“It’s not going to eat you, I promise.”
“Not that I should be, but am I forgiven?”
“That bag… there might be something in it, I’ll go fetch a net-“
Everyone who worked for the Yard seemed to be aware of Sherlock’s aversion to his deerstalker cap, earning him a multitude of gawking looks and whispers.
A small crash came from the front room, causing Maria to dash back in. “Damn it John” Sherlock muttered under his breath.
“I’ll be back as soon as I can,” Lestrade promised, patting him on the back.
“Well…”
John sighed. He had gotten no response. It was beyond maddening how inconsistent this ghost stuff was. But then again, perhaps that’s why so many people didn’t believe it and scientists didn’t study it.
-Do not. I could hack nearly any computer.-
.’ He was almost certain that Sherlock had just done one of his damn ‘commands’ on him, he shouldn’t be this calm about letting his crazy flatmate play mind games with him in public. He began to open his mouth in protest.
John threw a pillow off the couch at the detective.
________________________________________
“Oh, that. Well yes, happened last night when I fell down that damn hole- which we should really fix before Mrs. Hudson adds it onto the rent.”
“Ah, what class did you just come back from? Let’s see, it’s Wednesday, which means….  Which… means…. Oh…. OH.” Sherlock could feel the blood running to his face.
“Oi! Where are you going?” John dropped the razor, feeling like a total ass for even picking it up.
Mycroft began lowering Greg gently onto the bed when Greg’s tongue, annoyed from its lack of space, flicked over the tip of the tentacle. The tentacle immediately squirmed as Mycroft’s strength left him for another moment and dropped him again, though this time onto the soft bed.
“I’m sorry John, its just, I don’t know if anyone should be encouraging that sort of thing.”
“Why is there a boat next to- Oh no.” he silently prayed to himself that the miniature idiotic duo was not nearly that stupid. “Go get a net and an evidence bag.”
John cleared his throat in a loud rude manner; Sherlock dipped back down in the pocket realizing it took stepping on his own toes to look outside. John couldn’t reach the top.
I love you too. -HW
Alright, so maybe that was what the texting had been about. “And I know its really not any of my business,”
“Oh shush.” John pulled him in closer and raised himself on his toes to kiss the back of Sherlock’s neck. “Mine apparently do.”
Harry took a step closer towards the detective. "Won't you tell me?"
“Nope.” John smiled lightly, which highly confused the detective.
“Trust me, you could pay my rent for my entire life and I don’t think I would be getting the better deal.” John sighed.
“There could be practical uses to this.”
John blinked, still a bit confused. “But… you’re uh, chair? It’s right there isn’t it?”
Well congratulations mate, I knew you two had something special.- GL
"Moved actually." He tried hard to keep his tone even.
“I have a new experiment for you today.” Sherlock’s voice was muffled by John’s lap.
“mm. Strong word don’t you think?” Sherlock scrunched up his nose.
“ ‘M drunk but I mean it. Is cute. Now come bed. Wants me’ kitty.”
“It must have been diluted by the tea…” John realized. “Stupid of me.” He crouched down to where Sherlock sat. “I’m a bloody tosser and I deserve whatever abuse you give.”
Someone knocked hardily at the flat door. Sherlock looked up in a panic “Make them go away, please John! Make whoever that is leave.”
Sherlock fumed a bit. For a moment he had forgotten that no one knew he was there.
For once Sherlock was a tad grateful that Anderson really was the absolute moron he appeared to be. There was a strained huff from behind him, he turned to see a steaming mad John, all be it looking in slightly the wrong direction.
“This is perfect!” the detective beamed catching John’s attention.
“I know. Just climb up.”
Lestrade quickly stuffed Sherlock back in his pocket trying to muffle his complaints and stood from his crouched position.
his mind seemed to scream and to his surprise that only made matters worse.
-Should you be under any duress again feel free to contact me via text. (579) 987-5555-
"Let me see." Sherlock approached him abruptly and grabbed his hand. "Won't need stitches, you should go wash and bandage it though."
There was a long pause before Sherlock responded.
John flushed a bright red, he knew he would have to think of a way of explaining all of this. “Been looking for those…”
Moriarty stepped inside the flat followed by Moran toting an assault rifle. “What happened to you gun hmm? Oh that’s right! Your pet is too small for it now!” he quickly spotted John on the table and grabbed a glass beaker, pouring out the content and trapping John in it in one swift movement. “Can’t have you running off now.”
Chapter 13
“I wasn’t-“ John began protesting.
John nodded and began to wrap his ankle, Sherlock would have done it for him but his hands were simply too big for such a delicate action. “That should do the trick for now.”
Not a good time, first thing in the morning. JW
John stifled a laugh as his dorm mate came in.
“Not entirely true. You seem to be able to talk just fine.” Sherlock wrote down more notes. “A very interesting development really. I had hoped this drug might come in useful for apprehending suspects while still allowing them to talk and thus give away evidence. It seems to be a success! This is great news, you have been most helpful John.”
“We’ll find her John.”
Even stranger, Lestrade let him, looking very nervous and anxious that the pipe be torn to shreds. The two only paused in their bizarre efforts to look at a dead rat of all things.
John placed one arm under Sherlock’s knees and the other on his back as he picked him up and placed him in the chair, smiling giddily at the light shade of pink that Sherlock was turning. He noticed Sherlock was able to adjusted his legs slightly by himself, which was rather promising John thought.
“That was your voice…”
“Shit, Sherlock! Snap out of it!”
“And how did he text me if his phone is right here?” he eyebrows suddenly furrowed. “Wait… how the hell did he text me.” There was no way he could sneak up right next to her and leave his cell phone on the mantle after texting her.
John felt strangely safer in Sherlock's hands, but grabbed his thumb for support anyway.
"You can't just leave her out there!"
Then forget I said that and move on. –
“John! You lied to me!” Sherlock’s voice sounded hurt.
“Wha-“
“No, you’re not. You’re trying to be him and it’s not right.”
‘Something has come up, I’m afraid I’ll be rather busy the next few days.’ –MH
“Well the common person is so gullible to begin with I think it’s highly likely they just absent mindedly pretend to be hypnotized when in fact they’re not.”
Maria smiled, it was nice talking about her work, there’s was no she could actually share it with and she would be killing Harry afterwards anyway. “I read his blog, have been for a while, long before I met him. Didn’t tell him that of course, I had to follow him for a while before I found a way to introduce myself and dig my way into his life.”
“But we don’t know if they died or no-“
Sherlock shifted closer, feeling like an idiot for playing with something that was clearly labeled as a ‘child’s toy.’ He was afraid of hurting John, but carefully placed his hands over his.
“Greg liked the shoes by the way. The ones you picked out.” Molly XX
Lestrade was already out of the car by the time Mycroft answered, “Really? Oh, well good, great. Uh, just this way.”
"I know you don't." Before Sherlock could talk again, John lightly pressed their lips together.
-Please forgive me.-
Lake House Murder
The detective rolled his sleeves up allowing the tub to fill before continuing to massage his blogger’s muscles like he had tried earlier.
You could have turned skype off when I first messaged you, unaware of what you were doing I might add. –
No… it’s ok. We are friends. –
Sherlock’s jaw clenched.
“It’s ok Molly, it’s… it’s just Sherlock. Right?” The knock came again.
“Well she and Clara never got back together and I don’t think she has too many close friends.”
That wasn’t the response John was expecting. “Sherlock, I don’t think you want to go to those kinds of clubs” ‘Or clubs in general for that matter.’
But now that he was closer to the closet, he could feel it. There was something coming off the rope. It had looked ordinary enough at first, but it was different. He reached out to touch it and immediately pulled back. It was as though he had just been scolded by something exceptionally hot. He looked down at his hand, but there was no marking. Sherlock reminded himself that his form was really some sort of illusion he simply controlled, of course there would be no physical mark.
“Just leave me alone for a bit? This is really embarrassing.” Sherlock half mumbled as he stood, now the same height as John.
That night the camera facing the door of 221B was broken. Lestrade raced up the steps and pounded on the door. It had been an antagonizing five hours that he lost track of the doctor. Trying the flat was a dumb and desperate attempt.
“But John, you wanted to meet someone and-“
Sherlock looked down at himself. He certainly didn’t see any additional limbs. Perhaps it wouldn’t happen to him? Though, he hadn’t checked everywhere just yet. He went to remove his pajama bottoms when John flushed and turned away.
.” She couldn’t bring herself to say ‘love.’
“Ah, he was a florist. The taller man here recently bought some flowers, the flouriest killed them.”
“I don’t feel any different.”
The door was unlocked when he first entered, a strange sound lured him in. The sink left on in a room void of anything he could defend himself with. This was all set up for him. He had even been foolish enough to cry out to Mycroft at every chance he had so his attacked knew exactly where he was at all times.
John found the tapered edge of the tentacle and slowly started to pry it off. The grip immediately loosened, Sherlock’s full attention on the rain now. “We can get you everything you need, food, water, whatever. Just stay here with me?” He made the mistake of stroking his hand a bit over tentacle’s tip.
It was strange, Lestrade felt like laughing, but then he remembered he was in a restaurant and everyone was likely staring at him and Mycroft now, but as he caught the tail end of Grace's dramatic exit, including slamming the restaurants door, he heard something wholly unexpected.
I will enter unless you say otherwise.-MH
"You still came though." Grace smiled in a manner she thought was pleasant, but had a hint of something else in it, Greg didn't miss it.
“Er, are you sure that’s a good idea? I don’t want to make a scene in public Lock…”
“You’re invisible!”
“Myc is the only bloke I ever saw like this. Never cared much for any other guy.”
“Then I’ll come there.”
Lestrade whipped his door open, gave grace a death stare, and grabbed Mycroft by the elbow pulling him behind the protection of the door and quickly shut it behind him. He had no intention of giving his ex wife any further attention.
“Your spine?” Sherlock went to remove the sheet but as he touched John the smaller man doubled over in pain and clutched his head with both hands. “Shh, calm down, you’re going to be ok” Sherlock dropped to his knees and tried reassuring him. Still in pain John tried to crawl onto Sherlock’s lap. “John no, get off! I’ll give you another pastry.” He tried shoving him off earning him a bite on the hand. “Damn it John!” Sherlock stood up quickly, leaving John to fall back to the floor and hide under his sheet.
“This is…” he held up a miniature cabinet. “I think it’s some kind of dollhouse?”
Sherlock frantically wrote notes in a thick composition book, “The initial exam is very important John. I have quite a few experiments I would like to run but I need to get this data first. Make sure then you aren’t compromised between experiments.”
“I’m holding you prisoner until she leaves. Can’t have you killing each other.” He was only partially joking. His eyes fell on the coffee Mycroft had brought him. “Thank you… for that.”
“I mean, we’re you know.” Judging the expression on his flatmates face he really didn’t know. He cleared his throat
John didn’t like the words Sherlock was using ‘
Sherlock stared at the door blocking his way, he couldn’t open it, but perhaps that meant- he closed his eyes and stepped forward, opening them again to find he had passed through the door. That would take some getting use to. Sherlock glided down the steps but as soon as he tried to walk through the outer door and onto the street it was as if he slammed into a wall.
"I see, so this is a pattern then, not just a location factor. John? Are you okay?"
“Sign the damn papers.”
“You two are close though. Friends even.” He eyes him suspiciously.
“Wha- well, of course not just… I mean, I already do all the shopping anyway I guess.” John headed for the dairy section knowing tall git would follow.
“He has fleas and he wont let me bathe him.”
“He’s staying.” His words were met with a somehow even more demanding look from the politician. “Anything you have to say to me, you may say in front of John.” Sherlock was really trying his luck this time.
“It… it was? Must be a draft…” John knew he didn’t shut it after his mad dash through the flat in false hope that Sherlock had come back.
“Oh? And who’s that?” The detective knew something was up.
“You’re clothes…” Greg swallowed, still not able to put his finger on what exactly was the most off putting part of this. “we should find you something dry to wear.”
Mycroft eyed him, deducing his brother silently, “He doesn’t know does he?”
Besides, if you actually used a vibrator that I sent you, I figured you wouldn’t be opposed to me assisting. –
John over dramatically rolled his eyes, "well I couldn't sleep with your constant snoring anyway."
John would just have to do it himself. He pressed the lip of the glass to Sherlock’s lips and tilted it up for him. Sherlock drank it down as fast as possible, chugging every last drop of it. But it wasn’t nearly enough.
A quick phone call revealed the good doctor had called in sick for the day, the following day as well. But this morning the hospital had received no such phone call, yet, the doctor still hadn't left the flat.
“I’m done John. I have better things to do with my life then waist time on you.” John frowned.
John let out a light sigh and crossed an item off the grocery list, “Then I trust you… wait… you didn’t say I wouldn’t be mad about-“
The detective angles his head quizzically.
“Ah… I’m uh… my girlfriend, heh, dragged me along. Lost track of her actually… I should probably just go find her…” he quickly lied.
A freshly unboxed Ouija board to the side of the coffee table.
She’s a beaut! –JW
an idiot.”
Chapter 12
“No, it’s all fine. It’s the only time that my, um, well, it’s when people come online to play it.”
“Somebody get this damn cat out of here. Who the hell cleared this room anyway?” Lestrade grabbed the feline and shoved it in Donovan’s arms. “Go take that thing somewhere else.”
Sherlock looked up, facing John on the other side of the computer camera, eyes slightly shiny, he could tell John was being sincere. He had gotten particularly good at discerning lies. “You’re into that sort of thing then?”
“You have been seeing your therapist for over a year now and your lack of emotions is worsening yet you haven’t told her about it.”
The Placebo Effect
John rolled his eyes but did his best to raise Sherlock higher, who in turn grabbed onto the seat cushion of the chair and climbed out.
Please come back. JW
“The flat is plenty safe and comfortable.” Now was John’s time to glare at the politician. He wanted Sherlock where he belonged, at home with him. He also wanted all this weird staring nonsense to stop.
"Very well, get on with it." He continued to watch the footage of the flat just in case something turned up.
“Well… fine. I could be bisexual.”
“I know you were lying-“
"Damn, I was afraid of this."
’, not a word he would use to describe his friend. Suddenly his mind began to buzz with hundreds of questions, What shade was his skin? The texture of his hair? The shape of his hands? What his lips looked like when he smiled? So very many little questions he knew would be considered odd to ask and would likely go unanswered, at least not properly. A simple verbal description was not nearly enough, he needed more, something slightly more tangible, he needed to actually see John for himself.
It's all down the gay hill from here guys.
And now for more mormor.
Sherlock shrank back a bit, tentacles hidden in the water now.
“Why would someone else hack my computer? Forget that, why would you hack my computer? To answer a call to yourself of all things…”
Lestrade gave him a very skeptical look.
“Sh-Sherlock? Is that… you?” He wasn’t at all expecting a voice quite like that.
“Sorry Sir, seems there was some miscommunication. There’s no body.” She scrunched her nose when she saw John. “What’s he doing here?”
Lestrade quirked and eyebrow, “John?… John Watson?…”
Lestrade let out a loud frustrated sound. “What’s with that man?!”
Chapter 6
“I told you before John, I don’t care what you wear. You can wear your hideous jumpers or a dress, it’s all the same to me.”
“You’re naked aren’t you? Of course you are…” he shook his head.
Sherlock looked down at his miniature friend and scooped him up, "Hide." Sherlock placed him on the mantle. John scurried inside of the skull.
“You’ve been talking to my brother I see…” he mumbled irritably.
“I can feel it thickening again… shit, you really do have a fetish.” Greg teased, helping to dislodge the lengthy limb.
John had been kipping in the warm pocket of his
“Ah, you’re here. It’s uh, not exactly the case on my mind right now.” He didn’t make eye contact with John at that and bent down to rifle through a few case files before pulling out three. “Here you are.”
“Come on Tobby, go home.” He pulled on the collar again, Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John woke early, feeling well rested for the first time in a while. Unfortunately he didn’t have much time to appreciate it before he had to go back to the hospital. He had to come off his leave of work at some point after all.
“Mhm.”
“We should really try to find our way back before it gets later.” His voice was uncharacteristically nervous.
Greg had shrugged it off though, thinking it was just John being forgetful that it was in his hand. Besides, they were both grieving, those things tended to happen more in hard times. “John. There’s something I uh, wanted to ask you about.” Lestrade knew this was going to be hard to get out. He was already looking away so he wouldn’t have to face his friend directly.
“Well someone should’a warned me he’s got no alcohol tolerance. He’s been talkin’ bout’ you all night by the way. And he never did explain why you got those.” He made a hand gesture referring to Sherlock’s cat ears.
I cant believe I wrote this weeks and weeks ago and forgot to post it
“Oh.” Sherlock thought for a moment. “Well we could…”
“Hypnotizing you? Of course. Did you know that some people have the gull to claim that they have been hypnotized to perform a crime? The audacity to claim such an absurd thing.”
John groaned at the sound of his phone going off, it was still lying on the bed where he had left it. He could only hope that whoever it was would come looking for him and get him out.  A thought flashed across his mind. Could it be Lestrade?! He yelled out as loud as he could, hoping he was just outside trying to get in. He still fumbled desperately at the door in the dark but nothing seemed to work.
“I will.”
John was suddenly at ease and shook his head. “Sherlock. I’m such a fool, why didn’t I see it sooner?”
John, you are truly ridiculous at times. –SH
Daniel was overjoyed as he shook John’s hand, “Thank you! You guys are really helping me out here.”
“John, shut up, this is essentially the same as a stake out.” Sherlock berated him.
Sherlock Holmes: Yes John, you certainly do.
"But that makes no sense. He's obviously emotionally compromised because of John, why did he not at least check on him before he left?"
“Of course, come in, he’s just over on the table.”
Not really what John was expecting. “Uh, Sherlock?” It was still him, wasn’t it?
Angelo’s was walking distance from the crime scene, Sherlock estimated they had walked 67% of the way their without either of them exchanging a single word.
“The stairway is in the next wooden room, the spider is on the other side near the door.”
"Yes." It was more of a gasp then anything else.
“No idea.”
John looked up at the whispering yet still loud voice. The scarf had previously been removed from the dresser and placed on Sherlock's lap. The impossibly tall man, in John's opinion at least, reached back over to the table and handed John a pen cap.
“Maybe even stay away from the flat a bit. Find some woman to take on dates and stay at her place for a few nights.”
John clenched his jaw in frustration. “Well it’s none of their damn business what people do with their lives.” His face was hot and his throat began to ache.
“You don’t have to do that, it’s a dream, he’s not real, he’s…”
Transformation
‘Please, I just worry when you disappear on me.’ -GL
“Not everything has an ‘antidote’, some things just wear off naturally and thus don’t need one. This will just go away eventually.”
John blinked. “That could mean a lot of things. What exactly will it do to me?”
Sherlock crinkled his nose, “What do mean?”
“Hold on, if he’s not leaving his house, why don’t you just go see him?” Seemed like the most obvious advice, John reasoned. “After all this time, you must have his address?”
"Why do you people assume this is my fault?" Sherlock leaned back away from the files on the table.
Chapter 8
Anthea held her phone up for Mycroft to see. There was an image of a jam jar and inside what appeared to be a sleeping John Watson.
“What’s he pay?”
“Oh Sherly, you didn’t scare her off did you? You don’t want to upset John now.”
'Did Sherlock just blush?' John had caught the faint red of his friend's face before he looked away. "You can't be serious. Sherlock, people can't see me like this."
John crawled up onto the former detective’s bed and grabbed one of the pillows, holding it to his chest. “I thought… I thought that… oh god… Sherlock… I really thought I heard you calling me.”
So Archive changes my formating :/
“Yes, we were planning to-“ Shite. “ I was planning to,” he corrected himself but he knew it was too late and that Greg would have caught that slip up. “To…”
“Everything all right?” John hadn’t noticed he had unconsciously leaned down to Sherlock’s eye level, his hand resting on Sherlock’s knee to keep his balance.
“No idea really. Less then a day based on the last test.”
“So you’re in college then yea?” The was a lapse in the game and John decided to fill the silence.
Moriarty switched cameras to ones in the ally. Smoke began draining from the seems of the warehouse but no one came out. It wouldn’t be long before the bees dies of smoke inhalation, which would make the detective and his tiny associate long dead by then. A fire engine could be heard coming down a nearby street.
The tentacle seemed to dive further in then Greg would have thought possible. The other tentacles stroked soothingly at Greg’s thighs and waist, silently encouraging him.
John shook his head, stripped his clothes, and awkwardly climbed into the steamy teacup. Had he not had his back to Sherlock he would have noticed the larger man’s up curling mouth and occasional peek as he pretended to be in his mind.
John nodded again, “That’s also why you want me back. Sentiment.”
________________________________________
Not the end of this scene, I just needed a break from writing.
. It’ll just have to wait then.” He sighed and went back to his blog.
No, it’s about Sherlock. JW
Sherlock perked up at that, “Of course it is… I did get it for you after all.” The blush was still there, but now his mouth had the smallest of smiles.
“I don’t pretend!” he said a bit too loud but Sherlock and his usual social awkwardness didn’t catch it. “I do get
“Mhm. If I had gone willingly I would have, glad I didn’t, would have gone the way of my coat.” Sherlock frowned but still didn’t open his eyes as he laid on his back next to his fetal position flatmate ‘
Yes, remember, 12 sharp. –SH
“Nineteen.”
Maria approached from behind with a garrote held taught between her hands, quickly slipping it around the woman’s neck and pulling tight. She struggled desperately for breath. John cringed at the sight, wanting to help her with every fiber in his being but knowing there was nothing he could do. Just at the last moment when they thought the last thread of life would leave her, Maria let go of the garrote, causing the woman to fall forward to her knees and gasp for breath. Maria chuckled at the sight, admiring her work.
Sorry, it’s too loud where I am, wouldn’t be able to hear you. JW
Both of Mycroft’s eyebrows rose dramatically. “Oh.”
Mycroft’s eyes were solid black. Even the white part was entirely consumed by it.
“I know it’s important. You are important John. That’s why it hurts that you tell a total stranger all these things about yourself and not me.” He paused before a flushed look came over his face “I didn’t mean that… I meant that…” it was too late, the ruse was up. Sherlock cared.
“If you wanted him back you should have put up missing Jawn posters.”
“You’re right, this would make an excellent studio! My girlfriend will just love it!”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “He does have a wedding ring on. We should see if anyone reported a missing husband recently.”
“John?” Sherlock looked at his hand curiously, unaware of the moment.
“I mean it! Don’t you dare deduce me!”
An hour passed with no signs of any change, the miniature Moriarty began to fear he had made his first bad decision.
“So Sherlock, tell me about yourself.”
The music faded out as Greg reached Sherlock’s bedroom. But as he stepped inside, the violin in the corner shifted and gently tapped against the dresser as though it had just been moved. He carefully picked it up.
John’s throat felt as though it was closing off a bit, Sherlock looked as though he was on the brink of tears. “Shh, it’s ok, really. This is about that night isn’t it? When I… saw you’re computer screen?”
Sherlock placed John beside the skull, it would be difficult to run into trouble there, then answered the door. John looked for a good hiding spot just before he spied where his phone had gotten off to the past few days, blinking with missed messages.
John seemed to be yelling inflammatory remarks while making wild hand gestures but no sound came out. Finally he pointed at Sherlock with dagger like eyes.
“It was a placebo.”
The detective strolled in a moment later, “Did you need something?”
What happened? Any way to fix it? –JW
“I already see you almost all day everyday….” John could see his dating life and social life falling apart before his eyes.
‘Why didn’t he just stay put? He will run into all the tarantulas if he walks around like that! What is he thinking? Of course he’ll die anyway if the house burns down.’
“You can accuse me all you want, but it looks like John just doesn’t want to see you right now.”
“Wrong?” Sherlock stared at him incredulously.
-So what are you doing on?-
“I’m already wearing them and the strap is bloody awful to undo.” Sherlock licked his lips as he did the final touches to John’s make up and attire. “There! Now, come out so I can see you better.” He grabbed John’s hand and led him back into the main room where he badly pretended he was not gushing over his own handiwork.
“No I bloody can’t!”
“Shut up. Of course you wouldn’t be able to find a way out, that’s why he’s a genius and you’re a hired gun.” Moriarty shot back as he focused on the camera watching John dart down the hallway of the dollhouse. He smiled wickedly, “This one doesn’t like to give up.”
“She might not allow it, but alright, you can come. Just don’t be disappointed if you’re told to sit in the waiting room.”
John was silent, he knew Sherlock was right. The mood of the room shifted when both men heard a distinct knocking at the door.
“I don’t understand, why would someone be after Harry?! And besides, she’s not exactly hard to track down, anyone could just grab her off the street the way she goes about drunk at night.” John paced Lestrade’s desk frantically with the blinds closed on all the windows.
John took the long way home, walking down the London streets he use to run by with Sherlock while they were on cases. He knew those days were long gone. He didn’t have Sherlock’s wit, there would be no reason for him to show up at crime scenes. There hadn’t been a reason even with Sherlock though, he never contributed anything the genius didn’t already know or medical information an autopsy would reveal. He had simply been there all those times for Sherlock. Someone for him to feel like less of a ‘freak’ around as John bombarded him with compliments.
“Well then I’m officially alive again.”
The sound/ vibration, had ripped a moan straight of him, his hips thrusting forward instantly as he started to climax.
“Interesting… I think we should stop by there tomorrow. It could be any number of things, maybe someone with a grudge against Daniel is scaring people away so he’ll lose money, or it’s a prank done by neighbors. I think we should put up a few cameras inside the flat, possibly stage it so seem like the new tenant and see what happens.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened. “Please, Mycroft- don’t do this. I’m sorry, just don’t-“
Maybe a light joke was in order? He could always play it off as an accident… as blatantly untrue as that was.
“It’s not going to happen.”
Sherlock stared blankly at his phone.
“Uh… Well I guess that’s true. Never really thought about it, not that it matters. Why are we talking about this?”
“You’re thinking too loud, shut up.”
“John, I swear to you, this is just a dream.” Sherlock needed to think of something fast, logically he knew John would eventually wake up, but his mind was racing now. If it was a dream, that meant they needed dream logic to get out. “You need to think of a way out, anything, just imagine it really hard and vividly.”
“Well it was closed just now.” She went about making them both tea.
“Your studied have been dropping as of late. You’re not still playing that game are you? The online one?” Ella was holding a pad of paper for jotting notes down balanced on the edge of her knee. He real focus was on John, who was staring out the window and being relatively non responsive.
-Shut up. I made this account years ago and I’ve already got a reputation with this name…-
A tuxedo cat wondered in from one of the interior rooms, nose held in in the air intent on finding the source of what she was smelling. Her attention fell of Sherlock, who’s leg she would be dedicated to smothering. Sherlock tried shaking the pesky animal away at first but the cat wouldn’t give in.
"Why not? If anything people have shown that they are more interested in you in this state, it would make a good dinner conversation at least."
“There is a window though.” John pointed out. “Did anyone check if that was unlocked?”
“It’s a long paper, this could take a few hours.”
“It’s really better to test it at night actually, besides, I haven’t done an experiment yesterday or today, I’m falling behind on my plans.”
Loud voices came from the living room. John nearly dropped his mug. He was certainly not expecting that. Lestrade quickly stood, looking a bit alarmed as well.
Sherlock had an intent look for a moment. “Food.” It was hard to concentrate, he just knew he had to leave and gather supplies. They already had shelter.
“Let’s never do that again.”
“Very good John. Now, who killed him?”
Mycroft bit back a reply, once in the flat they could hear the small choking sobs coming from the dollhouse. They would need Sherlock for this one, and he couldn’t leave John like this.
“Clothes? What does it look like?”
Sherlock sighs as he waits, it will be hard hiding out in the flat as Mycroft has men dispose of Moriarty’s men, but he’s alive and still has John, that’s all that matters after all. Besides, John is more then capable of keeping his exaggerated death under wraps.
“Honestly I could only think of a few useful ones”
Unfortunately, it wasn’t Anthea waiting in the back for him. Suddenly John felt his skirt was significantly too short for the occasion.
Chapter 1
The next day couldn’t come soon enough. John didn’t focus on a single word one of his teachers said. He rushed back to his dorm as soon as possible, booting his computer up. He had set his skype account up so it automatically turned on when the computer came on, a small green check appearing next to his screen name. John smiled brightly when saw Deducing Otter already had a green check next to his name as well, clicking the name a small picture of a skull came up- he had grown very accustomed to this image representing his friend.
John still showed up to work, still paid the rent, and despite remaining antisocial genuinely seemed at least a little happier.
“Why on earth would we go with you? Lestrade, if you would, could you kindly take us back to our flat?”
John opened his mouth only to close it quickly again.
“Maybe.” They should keep looking either way. But he was starting to think all that talk of Ouija boards and morgues was just taking its affects on them both. He holstered his gun. “It’s a small flat and we didn’t see anyone else all night. Door is locked and,” He checked the window. “This too.”
“Hey, don’t listen to anything she said ok?” Lestrade wasn’t sure if he could address him on that close of a personal level yet, but it was obvious something that detestable woman had said upset Mycroft on a personal level. “She’ll say anything if she thinks it will get a reaction.”
“I rather stand.” His face was an emotionless mask.
He sucked in a deep breath, his eyes downcast towards the floor as he faced the chair. John’s head slowly raised, not sure what he had expected to see. It was a simple plastic chair; everyone’s office had at least one. He opened his mouth for a moment as if to speak before shaking his head.
“Get up.”
Sorry, I lied. Action chapter with BAMF John and Sherlock will be next chapter.
Sherlock shrugged, “Well maybe he’s trying to tell you something.” He raised an eyebrow suggestively.
“God… John?”
“Oh.” John looked down as a blush creeped across his cheeks. Swinging his head over his shoulder he checked that Sherlock was still in his mind palace.
“That’s alright, we could talk instead.” John readily replied.
“My knees?” He glanced back to double check the aisle was empty.
Chapter 7
Sherlock stayed by John’s side holding his hand despite John’s weak grip as they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Lestrade and three other police cars arrived at the same time. Greg instantly ran to John’s side as the paramedics lifted him onto a stretcher.
Greg couldn’t help but notice how John scanned everything in the room. He was clearly on edge as if anything could happen at any moment.
“What the hell is this?” John stood in the kitchen staring at the various science equipment on the counter and slowly held up a large beaker of grey liquid.
At first he did nothing.
-What? How’s that possible?-
“No I mean…” John shook his leg nervously, “I could never live with myself if I knew I hurt you, under the influence of one of your crazed experiments or not.”
“Tell him yourself.” Sherlock wasn’t about to take the high road.
John wiped the tears from his eyes and tried to stand again. “It really is actually. You’re half a foot shorter then me.” John picked up his slightly under five foot detective by the waist. Sherlock struggled against him at first but he was out muscled and outsized, he soon gave in and was limp in John’s arms. “I’m making you food, you’re going to enjoy it, and I’m going to enjoy being taller.”
Sherlock remained silent.
Sally stirred from her spot on an outdoor reclining chair.
-Worrier you are. I’m fine now.-
Have an interesting case for you, meet me at Barts? –GL
“What if you rub against me or something and muddle it all up?”
As Lestrade's eyes scanned the room John ducked his head behind the skull. The slight movement caught Lestrade's attention though.
Sherlock sighed. He ruined both their lives. His mind wondered to the contents of his pocket.
“Official? They’ve gone into business together?” his eyebrows furrowed.
John nodded quickly, “And if someone used it to commit crimes?”
John cupped the sides of Sherlock’s face, gently making his friend look at him. “We’ll just stay here then. I can look after you, it will be fine.”
"In your dreams freak."
“Then what’s he doin’ on the floor?” The teen leaned closer to get a better look but John was already feeling too drowsy to care.
Is it your brother? Or do you not want to meet me? –
“Let go! It’s not like he’s not going to check here anyway!”
“Don’t you trust me?” He attempted his best innocent look, which only gained him a smirk from John.
“That’s amazing… You’re really there.”
John had lied. This was nothing like kissing, it was much, much better.
There was an even long pause in messages.
“I’m only taking a pillow, his were softer and it’s better for my neck.” John told himself as he went in to grab one.
“You… “ Sherlock bit his tongue, he didn’t want to go down that route. “Why does it matter? I can just wear a hat and my coat and no one will know.”
“Er, sorry.” He squeezed it a bit in surprise, finding it strangely thicker now.
I’m in class. –JW
“Right. Well, I’m sure we’ll find him.”
Sherlock bit his lip feeling a smile forming. Had he gone too far? Could he possibly push his limits more?
“You haven’t said ‘
“Only if you keep doing this.”
Sherlock smiled dauntingly up at Molly, “I can and I will. Grab a pen and paper, you will write down questions to be asked exactly how I say them.”
“And it didn’t! It’s not like you have to talk or that anyone would know. I’ve stayed true to my word.”
“Shh, It’s ok, I know, you thought you saw him but-“
“Are you-” He huffed in a breath of air, the tentacle was so close to his prostate now. “Doing that?”
John… -
“What do we do if Lestrade can’t find us?” He was already following the mad genius down the chair leg.
“No.”
Sherlock could feel the energy stored up inside him, desperately wanting to be let out. He rubbed his hands together enthusiastically before knocking over a stack of books. John and Molly immediately snapped their heads up.
Molly had gone back to the lab, promising to stop by again later after work. It was late by the time she came back and John looked positively drained from researching for so long.
A very awkwardly long moment passed as Lestrade took in the sight. John’s hair had been slightly overgrown as of late, he hadn’t paid it much attention since he typically wore wigs while in drag, but today Sherlock took it upon himself to gel it into perfection. A perfect compliment to the tight wasted cocktail dress and dark leggings.
“John, get on your knees.” His voice was a deep baritone of authority and John found he was on his knees before he could even register what he was doing. But was that the hypnotism or just Sherlock’s voice? “Your whole body is going to relax in 3, 2, 1,” the detective snapped his fingers loudly.
“Of course not.” He continued making breakfast. “How does it work anyway?”
An even longer pause before the message was sent.
“Starving!” Lestrade stretched a bit as he stood. “I brought a pizza actually. One of those frozen ones, if you’re interested.”
“I’m just trying to help you.” John crossed his arms, totally pissed off, but looked away.
John looked rather surprised by that, “Oh, its not that big a deal, really.” Although it would have been a better idea to grab at least one night’s worth of supplies before he and Greg had headed over earlier.
Well if you knew that’s what I was doing, why would you message me?
“And?”
“Well I’m not anymore so I would appreciate if you didn’t try to follow me when I leave at night.”
“I’m up I’m up, you don’t have to keep calling me name.” John rubs the sleep from his eyes as Sherlock smiles down at him.
Looming over him clad in his black coat ready to leave for the crime scene was Sherlock, complete with a pair of soft black cat ears sticking out of his hair. “John? You’ve gone pale…”
Take the case.
“You look like you could use some assistance.”
“It was just one date. One girl doesn’t make me gay.”
“John shut up.” The words were monotone but had a powerful affect.
Sherlock didn’t see the first coming, only felt the throbbing in his face after the fact. “You could have said that any damn time!”
John felt strangely relieved by that. Of course Sherlock wouldn’t leave over some silly storm.
“And this changes nothing about what I said last night.” John whispered, forcing Sherlock to lean closer.
“No… this is Sherlock, if there was another way, he would have taken that instead.” John took a shuddering breath. Sherlock wasn’t trying to kill himself. He wasn’t sure if that made things better or worse. “Idiot…”
“It’s always the wife.” John mumbled.
John tried to regain his composure at Ella’s harsh words.
Sherlock was satisfied by this.
“There’s a tarantula three rooms to your left, it hasn’t seen you yet. The third is occupied with a rat, it likely wont bother you for some time, even if it sees you, best to avoid it regardless. The other three are downstairs.”
Well ok, there will be fluff, but god there will be angst!
“Oi John! It’s freezing in here!”
“You wont be. You previously promised me everything to be tested was reversible.”
At that Sherlock's eyes jolted to the table making sure it really was the beaker John said it was. He then grabbed his flatmate's hand once more. "Wash and bandage it now."
“This is a rather small apartment, likely only one way in and one way out.”
He opened his eyes, vision still slightly blurred, he could just make out the pale neck he was barely an inch away from, only then realizing his arm was wrapped tightly around the figure.
Suddenly Sherlock was standing in an empty ally surrounded by impossibly tall buildings. There was just enough ambient light to see by but it was otherwise extremely dark and filled with garbage. It looked a bit like the back alleys of London, but he couldn’t think of anywhere in the city that was this garishly painted or had quite so many trash bins. He heard the faint far off call of what sounded like his own voice, ‘Hurry up John! We’re almost there!’ as foot steps splashed through puddles and quickly approached him from beyond the corner. Sherlock blinked rapidly in confusion, he saw himself running around the corner right at him before fading away into nothing. A second pair of foot steps and a heavy panting breath followed, and within seconds John was running around the same corner. He came to an abrupt stop when he saw Sherlock standing there motionless.
“I cant- I- fuck, Myc…” Greg let out a shaky breath, hardly able to say anything coherent at all. “Gonna-”
John quickly readjusted his body as another jittery cringe drew Sherlock’s finger’s closer.
Sherlock decided it was best to walk. He slid a hand through his curly hair, glad the effects of the last experimental mix up was finally out of his system. He didn’t really mind the ears or tail, but he hated wearing that damn hat in public. He cast his gaze down at John, following fully willingly, but with a hint of concern on his face, he knew he could suddenly lose control of his actions at any minute based on the whims of his crazy friend.
“Even though this morning at the crime scene you thought she was enough to ask her out,”
"It's been a while Greg."
"Can you fix me already?"
-Dorm mates are the worst.-
“Care for?” He wasn’t even bothering to look up from his phone anymore.
“Moriarty has Harry then?!”
There was an awkward silence.
Sherlock leaned against the wall and hummed in thought at that. It was possible after all, and not an entirely terrible place to start. But there was the obvious problem that it wasn’t just anyone trying to scare people away. There really was a ghost.
“I thought I would never see you again.”
“There’s people outside… idiotic masses of them…”
“Yea?” One boy stepped closer with a strange swagger about him, both hands kept in his pockets. “That close by?”
“Then put a blanket over your face.”
The detective was silent for a moment. “I’m working on it.” the corner of his mouth fell downwards, he knew John was beginning to worry by the sudden lack of movement. He himself was terrified.
"Sherlock! She's waking up." John stood at the edge of the table watching Molly. He wanted Sherlock to do more to make sure she was okay, but he insisted she would be fine.
But they were Sherlock’s pillows. On Sherlock’s bed. How could he possibly remove one from it’s rightful place? This is where it belonged with the rest of Sherlock’s possessions.
“Hm? Girl? Oh, I’m not trying to…”
“Relax Sherlock, it’s Tobby.” The cat was lying down and released the struggling detective. “It’s Molly’s cat remember… no, you most definitely would have deleted that.”
It took Mycroft a moment to answer, his thoughts being elsewhere, repeating what Grace had said to him in his mind. “It’s Harriet, John’s sister… She’s gone missing, the two officer’s watching her lost track and haven’t found a trace of her since last night.”
Sherlock barely managed to take care of himself, taking care of John was slowly becoming a nightmare. John was like a pet he wanted desperately but knew he couldn't take care of.
Lestrade quickly looked away, face feeling hot from Sherlock’s accusation. “John- you look… really good actually. Very good.” ‘is this what he’s been up to this whole time?’ Lestrade started feeling extremely apologetic for invading John’s privacy now.
“They’re not like you, I mean, they look really good, just surprised a bit.”
"Are you saying I'm dull?"
“I don’t believe you.” The air from the words ghosted across John’s skin making him shudder.  “You only made me do that experiment yesterday because you knew I didn’t want to do it.” Sherlock backed off and began to pace the room.
Sherlock placed his phone next to the pillow, John hopped off landing on the hard wooden table with a light thud. The screen lit up clearly indicating it was in fact Monday.
Until then, there was the highly important matter of what to wear. With a defeated sigh he pulled out his cell phone and dialed Molly’s number.
The taxi ride home was silent, not an awkward silent like they both originally feared it would be, but a peaceful understanding quiet.
Have to go, wont be back for a while, sorry. –
John couldn’t help but to laugh, he never even thought of asking what on earth ‘deducing otter’ even meant before. Not that his username made much more sense, just an army nickname he picked up.
Sherlock was lost in thought.
Mycroft leaned a bit too forward, not responding. Greg caught him, now growing concerned.
John bit his lower lip before repeating the words for Lestrade to hear, he didn’t like that he was technically deceiving him, but it seemed better then saying
‘It must be Christmas, I finally got my wish of you shutting up.’ –SH
“Oh please, the placebo test wont be for a few days. Now just sit there calmly.” Sherlock took the cup back and fixated his eyes on the doctor as he relaxed back into his chair.
“Then complain to the school and find a different room.”
“Oh… oh my god.”
Greg couldn’t help but smile at this. “And I didn’t think Sherlock could ever see anyone that way.”
“Yes!” John blurted out before he knew what he was saying. His hand instinctively raised to cover his mouth.
Yes, Mycroft. –SH
-“I’m reporting you for hacking and then taking your gold”-
“Glad you’re coming around.” Sherlock drank his tea in one long gulp. “Now then, for today I was hoping to-“
John often heard people whispering, “Why does he put up with him?” “How could anyone stand that freak?” They were of course referring to Sherlock. He couldn’t stand when he over heard these things. Of course his flat mate wasn’t the easiest person to get on with, he was a bloody git and quite possibly the most socially awkward man in all of England.
“No one’s online today, not much we can do in game I’m afraid.” The baritone seemed particularly bored.
“I miss you Sherlock.” John murmured to the empty flat.
“Of course it is.” John should have known. He was definitely tossing those out after this. “I’ll be back.”
“Get back inside that pocket, hide.” John did as he was told, he could see a sudden jolt of pain running across Sherlock’s face. He had been lucky. The amount that got into the cut on his hand was a much smaller dose, the process had taken the entire night. This would take mere seconds.
Ella blinked in confusion; she wasn’t a very internet savvy person. “I’m sorry? Are you saying you met him online then?”
It was nearly noon and Sherlock sat at the kitchen table peering into a microscope still wearing his dressing gown and sleep wear.
“Don’t worry.” Sherlock put a hand on John’s chest to steady him. “I wasn’t planning on leaving you in your clothes. That would be horribly irresponsible. I will make sure you get a proper bath.”
Three hours of footage passed with nothing of any interest happening. As Mycroft fast forwarded the tape he nearly jumped out of his seat when his little brother came bounding out of the flat like the mad man he was. Switching to the ally's camera he watched as Sherlock ripped apart a drainage system.
“I’ll still come to you in dreams.” Sherlock promised.
Not much point in beating around the bush anymore, “I know you destroyed the camera outside the flat.”
The clattering sound grew nearer and John walked with his head down pretending not to notice it until four young men came into view. One had been kicking a stone against a trash bin until they spotted John seemingly walking alone.
“John! Go for the abdomen! It’s the weakest point!” He clenched his teeth, he didn’t know if John was already dead or not.
“So he’s not really a friend, have you considered meeting some new people? Maybe joining a club at school or going on dates?”
’ “Be a good cat while I’m gone.”
But something was still bothering him.
That completely shut John up for a bit. “But I’m going on a date tonight with a woman.”
"What's going on now?" Lestrade grasped the door handle after Sherlock got in the car to prevent him from taking off right away.
John rolled his eyes, “I’ll bring it.”
"Yes, very disgusting, now get away from it."
“It could be a coincidence.”
"I'll have to take the whole thing apart." He muttered to himself.
Sherlock scowled. “Who do you think I mean? That… woman.”
That was right, Sherlock thought. Lestrade was at their flat now. There were numerous items he could grab that might have some effect. He couldn’t exactly hail a cab down though. Could he even make it to the flat on foot from here as a ghost?
It’s sort of a time sensitive matter, think I could come by now? GL
The two men hear no reply, but then it was also possible they just couldn't hear John's small voice through the hole.
Sherlock brought his head up for a moment to see what John had brought, showing him a flash of those aquatic eyes, John thought his heart could melt from the sight of them.
Earlier:
Another knock.
Sherlock had already taken in the sight of the boat and it’s painfully obvious pirate theme, he bit back a smile at the way John addressed him. “Don’t be so childish, just get us close to that notebook.”
-Sometimes I think you say that just to impress me-
“I’ll get you some aspirin, and yes, you called me that repeatedly.” At John’s groan he added, “And in front of Greg.”
“You can’t possibly mean… Lock you have ears!”
Sherlock’s voice quieted significantly, he kept mentally reminding himself that this was all a dream but somehow that didn’t help too much.
“Molly! Molly wake up!”
“Oh god no, please don’t tell me I called you that last night.” John tore himself away from his flatmate and sat up to one of the worst migraines in his life. “Ah great, hangover.”
“Ok, are you going to tell me what’s wrong or are you gonna clam up and go quiet like everyone else?” He had really had enough of the bizarre behavior from everyone lately.
Greg looked at him curiously.
“John? I need you now!”
“Joooohn.” He extenuated the name, “You proooomised.”
“Sherlock wait. Just tell me. Am I stuck like this? Indefinitely I mean.” Sherlock stepped closer to him noticing the wetness of his eyes. “I’m sorry, I know I keep asking and so does everyone else but- well, it does change a lot.”
“A few days ago, I was looking for a team up- that’s when two or more people decide to play together in the game- and he let me into his server.”
"You're so small John!" A light smile began to fill Sherlock's face.
All Harry could think of was how her idiotic brother better be right about the supposed genius of his flatmate.
“Stop deducing me or whatever you call it and focus on him,” Lestrade gestured to the dead man. “I’ll tell you the rest once he’s on the road.”
Something about the description put John on edge. “Really, there’s no one here.”
“I left her because she was having affairs, actually.” And of course Sherlock was the one to tell him.
“You wont like it.” Sherlock nearly whispered.
Sherlock looked at John in a calculating manor. “And what about you?” He had turned his gaze back on Mycroft. “How will you ride out this stupid storm?”
Sherlock scoffed, "
If Sherlock was right- which of course he was Lestrade knew- the killer really had picked their game up this time. The woman wasn’t just killed, she was beaten fiercely. The D.I. bit his bottom lip, in cases like these he knew the killer only got more violent as the crimes went on. He needed to stop this guy, and fast.
“Lets go back to your place.”
“Yes John?”
“Well fuck you too mate!” The cabbie shot back considering if he wanted to kick them out or not but ultimately decided he needed the cab fair more then his pride.
“I’ve just been very occupied with work.”
John was still teary eyed by the time his body was so exhausted that he succumbed to sleep in Sherlock’s bed. He wasn’t sure how the late detective would feel about that, but he still felt oddly welcomed there.
Sally obliviously strolled back “There’s no net, but I got a bag, maybe we could just find a- Greg?!”
Donovan: Finally with the freak then?
John took that in. That meant he was still gay… if he was gay, which he certainly isn’t. He thinks. “Well when the hell is this experiment gonna be done with?”
“Shh, just calm down and breath alright?”
It was no more then a whisper, he wasn’t even entirely sure if he had heard it.
Sherlock cocked his head, not understanding for a moment. “It’s not for me.”
“Oh uh… yea. Mostly.” Not entirely, he was having horrible nightmares and sometimes thought his dead friend was talking to him.
“Then they’ll call.” Sherlock was typing something out.
"And it talks! English no less at that." The old man had a whimsical smile and tilted his head, "Trying to convince me you're 'regular' bloke eh? Ha, I've caught you now and I know exactly what you are."
“Well- That’s different.” His tone was significantly less hostile now.
“You… you’re…. I can see through you…”
’ he wasn’t sure if he was more confused by what was sent or that it was too him.
is just manipulating him. It’s glaringly obvious.”
“Told him first. If your phone hadn’t been off I would have found you sooner.”
“Excellent. I’ll give you a week to pay me, then I’ll hand it over.” The man smiled gleefully.
“You’re right, it’s not your business.” Sherlock shot back.
“John?!” The knocking came harder and John felt like an utter imbicile. It was clearly Lestrade’s voice.
“Should be subtle at first.”
John flinched, he hadn’t expected him to react so dramatically.
“How am I suppose to prove it? There’s nothing useful in this place.” Sherlock grumbled, wishing he could just shoot a smiley face in the wall. For a moment he considered tapping out in morse code, but after the third tap he realized he had lost too much energy and could no longer be heard.
“Don’t be silly, that’s the same chemical compound that-“
Sherlock gave in and nestled next to his flatmate on the bed facing him, “You’re just going to yell at me for this in the morning and claim you’ve forgotten tonight.”
Chapter 3
“I don’t really understand either, but it’s ok. I think I- well, it doesn’t matter for now.” He looked down at his feet, knowing sometimes size does matter.
Around him now was the familiar sight of 221b.
Sherlock leaned close and smiled fondly. “Of course not. You’re my little soldier man.”
Almost drowning and nearly losing your boyfriend in the process was apparently one of the very rare instances in which Sherlock will call it an early day and go home. He found he couldn’t take his hands off John on the way back. He ignored that his own hair was irritatingly curlier when wet due to the newly processed information that a soaked John Watson was in fact, mesmerizing.
I’ll be on soon.- JW
“Oh Sherlock, you’re adorable!”
“Where’s Sherlock? I thought he was watching after you?”
“Well I do have an idea actually. Warm water can help relax the muscles and it could help you move again. I could just place you in the shower or run a hot bath for you…” his voice trailed off deciding which was better.
Sherlock’s hand raised slightly bringing his forefinger up, John immediately wrapped his hands around it. Sherlock smiled.
"Sherlock's probably tearing the place apart looking for me and I haven't a bloody clue where I am." A horrifying thought crossed John's mind,
“Not entirely convinced you didn’t have a hand in my mood, but yes, I suppose you can tell me to make an arse of myself now.”
This is when you typically go to sleep. Thank you for texting me today. –SH
“What sort of things do you discuss?” Ok, he was having far too much fun, but seriously, this must have a way more logical explanation that what it sounded like.
John grimaced at him, already straightened out from his previous condition and held tightly to the sides of the wheelchair. “I’m not leaving without Sherlock.”
“What?” John lost some of his tension at that.
“I realize none of this was what you were expecting, I- I’m really sorry-“
“Uh huh… where’s the freak today anyway?” Sally looked around to no avail.
Right. John judged the space between him and the stairs. How long he could creep near without the spider hearing, or rather feeling his bloody vibrations before it saw him. He crept stealthier then he ever had in his life. He pressed his back against the final doorway; he knew once he entered the room the spider would see him. He glanced through the plexiglass at Sherlock, he could see he was leaning as far forward as he possibly could to watch John. John inhaled deeply and lunged forward to sprint down the stairway. The tarantula spun around and was after him in the blink of an eye.
“Well?”
Sherlock hailed a cab, “I’ve told you all I can about the bodies, it seems we really should be getting back now. Call if you need anything.” He stepped into the cab gesturing for John to do the same.
Sherlock could feel John’s firming erection and much to John’s surprise he immediately pulled back
A moment later John returned grinning.
"Sherlock!"
John sighed, He wasn’t looking forward to a conversation where he had to ask Mycroft blood Holmes is he had gills or not. So much for people thinking all politicians were reptilians. John furrowed his brow. Were there reptilians?? He would have to revisit this thought later.
'It was just a cut, it's not like he drank it.' Sherlock thought to reassure himself, but somehow that didn't make his worry disappear. 'Well, there's no point in telling John until I know for sure if there will be any affects.'
Molly choked out another sob, trying to steady herself. She knew there was no way she could live with this guilt. “Sherlock… I didn’t know how to tell you, this wasn’t suppose to happen. But then, he really died and…”
-Sorry about that, my damn dorm mate is causing a scene in the hall. I swear he lowers the IQ of the whole college. I’m still here, not going anywhere.-
“Nothing in this world happens unless I want it to happen, you understand that? If Sherlock and his little pet die, it’s because I want them to die.” He slowly stepped closer to Moran. “And if they both live, it’s because I want them to live. Do you understand me?” he was now inches away from the now terrified sniper.
“Right, of course.”
“What? John really-“
Sherlock handed John a short list.
It was the first time John heard Sherlock talking about his life and not just the game, though he had slowly been asking John more and more about his own life. He forgot himself for a moment and dropped his backpack on the floor, causing a small thud. The baritone voice quickly stopped and John bit his lip.
Lestrdae bit his lower lip nervously; at least he was pretty sure it was still him. He reached out, lacing his hand with Mycroft’s. He could swear those solid black eyes softened at that.
There was a ping sound from John’s lap top, which generally meant he had a new messages, except his computer had been frozen since last night when… Things were starting look a bit suspicious. John grabbed the computer, finding it in perfect working order now.
Lestrade thought of their previous theory that this was all somehow connected to Harry. The thought was nerve-racking.
“A case?” Molly raised an eyebrow.
Something's happened, I can't come.-SH
“So… what’s supposed to happen?”
Greg knew this was a bad idea. “Yea. Couldn’t have been. Its even got dust on it now.” Maybe it was someone from outside and the sound came through the window, or perhaps it was all in his head. “I’ll take it back if you like-”
“Just well… you don’t think that it’s permanent do you?” his voice was nervous and quiet.
John giggled drunkenly, “You could take advantage of me then. I wont remember.”
Greg arrived not long after, various bags of items in his arms. He knocked but heard no response. ‘Strange’, he thought. Had John left to Tesco’s after all? He tested the handle but it was still locked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry: Well I hope you kiss and tell! Who’s the lucky gal?
“Uhh, yea, I just um… I have a bit of a favor or rather question to ask.” John blushed a bit even though no one could see him. He was going to sound absolutely ridiculous.
Moran quickly nodded once and obeyed only pausing when he saw the sleek black car on a street camera also headed towards the warehouse.
“Nothing! I swear to you, this was it John.” Sherlock rushed to say in a quieted voice.
“No, boring is fine, good even.”
“Send a text for me, to 334-7…”
“Sometimes I just feel drawn in there. Like… I know it sounds absurd, but its as if he wants me in there.”
“I can’t protect you if I do- you don’t know if the reverse chemical even works yet.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I… I can't find him anywhere, it doesn't make sense. He was only out of my sight for a few moments."
The case was still bothering Sherlock, he still couldn’t find anything that would make someone want to threaten Harry or John assuming he was on the right track. He had been in his mind palace for 10 minutes trying to find anything he might have missed when a knock came from the front door.
He could feel his face reddening but couldn’t stop it. “You’re putting me on…” his hands felt frozen, unable to close the tab on the offending webpage.
John nodded; he knew what he was getting into before he went under. It was only fair that Sherlock got to test the results now.
John briefly wondered if there was a new article about him “Confirmed Bachelor Dr. Watson Attempts Suicide After Loss of Fake Genius Partner.” What did it matter?
“Boys! Boys!?” Sherlock could hear Mrs. Hudson fumbling up the steps just in time to cover a sulking John with his palm against the table before she came in. “Oh Sherlock, is everything alright?”
Sherlock shrugged, “You seemed rather irate with me, not to mention the following day was when you swore off all experiments- the second time.”
Molly blinked and looked up, “Sorry?”
“You would… do that?”
There was a horrible howl that came from the direction John had been running away from. John had a look of pure terror as he glanced over his shoulder, “We don’t have enough time, come on Lock!” He grabbed Sherlock’s hand, it felt as real as anything, and began running again. The deafening howl only got louder as it gained speed on them.
Lestrade come back in wearing his usual work attire, “Crime scene, possibly another serial victim. Er, I sort of need you on this one Sherlock.”
"Oi! Where are you off to now!?" Lestrade followed Sherlock out and spied the slick black car waiting.
Possible new information on the killings, come to the Yard.- GL
“I don’t have time to tell you again. I must return home. If you… insist on something more substantial to base my claims on, I’m afraid you’ll have to let Dr. Watson leave us for some time.”
“John, John! Stop, stop this!”
Sherlock stretched his arm out to help John onto the chair as well, “There’s something I need to get a better look at.”
John’s voice was small and slightly cracked, “So someone else cleaned the floor? What would be the point of that if the killer left the body there?”
John’s blush deepened as he switched hands for his phone to go through the coat hangers. “Jeez, it’s not a… not really anyway… maybe…”
Feet entered her view, she tried to look up at her captor, face this monster down, but her neck was screaming in pain. She had been hit there when she was knocked out the moment the two officers looked away.
It’s freezing here, wish I had a fire.
"Oh, John, before you go, tomorrow morning I'm going to see Lestrade about a new case. Care to join me?"
"We're not-" Mycroft began to protest.
Maria stopped before her hand touched it. “Oh what am I doing! You are so maddening.” She huffed and turned to leave until a hair-raising sneeze came from the skull. Sherlock clenched his jaw.
“Sounds like whatever this is, its connected to your case.” They got to the room the attack was reported in. Nothing seemed out of place. Just a simple room, nothing but a bed with a night stand and a dresser in it. “Well, I don’t see a body.”
‘The hell is he doing?’ He tried the handle but it was locked. “I swear to god if you are doing what I think you’re doing in there…” Lestrade let out an exasperated sigh and decided he really had to do it. He began picking the bathroom door lock.
Greg jumped and hit his head on the glass table. He didn’t break it but the pain was instantaneous. “Damn it Sally, what do you want?”
“Fine. Yes. I’ll go back to therapy.”
“Jealous?” John could practically hear the grin he was sure was there.
Sherlock let go of John’s hand to approach the bodies for a closer look. John’s hand felt colder at the loss of warmth, he balled it into a light fist by his side, Sherlock noticed this and continued his deduction.
Sherlock dipped his head into the crook of John’s neck, taking in his scent. “Because you’re meant to be smaller.”
“You were snogging me senseless in another man’s pocket, I do have standards. But this! Sherlock, I don’t want this. I don’t want to live like this.”
“Wont affect my date will it?” he remained sitting in his chair as the detective sprinted off into the kitchen.
Lestrade chuckled and waved him off, “He must drive you crazy mate, I know he does me and I only work with him.”
Sherlock couldn’t take his eyes away from the thin red tentacle, even as he heard John approaching with the tea tray. The limb tucked its self away moments before John had entered. How could possibly explain that to anyone? That there was some strange possibility that he wasn’t quite human. He was a monster.
No fireplace in your dorm room I take it. –
“Except that he’s not alive.”
“John?” Sherlock watched as his friend was staring at the shaker. He had seen it. Sherlock tried pressing his finger against the salt again, it didn’t budge. Damn. He was so close.
“We should check the rest of the place too, the attack might have happened in here, but we have a whole flat to search.” Lestrade turned, ignoring the closet door.
“Its ridiculous, I know. But… Sherlock?” John looked positively dreadful just thinking about it.
Sherlock still hadn’t answered John’s question about what in all he wanted from his blogger. “What time do you see her?”
"Why did you want to meet up?" he didn't notice the well dressed man carrying an umbrella walk in looking for him.
John wondered if he could possibly explain the mix up with the chemicals and if it was even remotely believable.
‘If you’re suggesting Gregory as a possible mate, I should inform you that I fear he may not survive. You have yet to experience the changes, but I assure you, they are neither explainable to people nor physically easy for them to handle.’ –MH
No offence mate, but I’m pretty sure you were never ‘tall.’ –GL
Mycroft grinned at that, his prehensile limbs squelching in and out of his mate as the other tentacles began to wander about Lestrade’s body. One trailed over his chest and twisted its way around an already hard pink nub.
“Don’t believe you. There’s more.”
Sherlock sighed what was obviously a fake sigh, “Very well, but you were just complaining yesterday that everyone thinks you’re gay anyway and that it’s awkward when men check you out. This could be an improvement in your life after all.” He pulled out a pill container and handed it over.
“Goodbye then. John?” She turned before walking out the door. She huffed, clearly agitated by the lack of response and left.
John skimmed through the newest posted porn videos, glad Sherlock chose text opposed to talking this night.
“It’s a date then,” Greg teased, when suddenly his mug fell off the corner of the table.
John looked around. There was nothing that would have caused it to just open like that. Could it have been? “S-Sherlock? Is that… is that you?” Did he want him to investigate it further?
“Where’s the freak today? Off shaggin his boyfriend?” Donovan drawled out.
“Oh. Just, uh, thinking.”
all day.”
Greg looked up at him, “The second one that died?”
"A small one, clear blue liquid inside."
“What on earth-“
John let out a deep sigh, “I’m not exactly a chemist genius with experiments I want to test out.”
Lestrade looked beyond relieved when he saw John, as if he had been expecting to knock the door down to get in. He let out a breath he had been holding, “I’d be lying if I said I haven’t been worried about you. Thought I ought to check in.” He subtly scanned the flat, which John noticed despite Greg’s best efforts. But the place didn’t seem to be too much of a mess, just some knocked over books. He thought John might not be taking care of himself. “Mind if I come in?”
Dr. Watson has very few possessions of his own, he’s not a materialistic man. Find a way to check the bags if possible. MH
-Cat got your tongue? Not gonna try to impress me anymore?-
Chapter 6
Of course the world’s only consulting detective knew what his phone said already. “I have about an hour and a half.”
. “No, just trying exit if you could allow me.” His voice remained calm but he could feel the pressure building in his head.
John froze, his hand even letting go of the door handle. That was Sherlock’s voice just outside of the door.
John and Molly sat on the floor at either end of the table, placing their fingertips on the planchette.
Sherlock had sprinted off to the crime scene the moment he was out of the cab, John trailed behind pausing briefly to not the crowd just behind the crime scene tape holding up picket signs.
“Ten minutes John!”
He shuffled the coffee mugs and jam jars around desperately. Finally behind a blender he found something unexpected, a small rat hole. John had almost completely forgotten this whole mess started when Sherlock jumped up to find a rat in the flat. John took one step in hesitantly, he didn't want to burn to a miniature crisp on the counter or fall to his death, but that didn't mean a rat hole was an entirely safe place to enter.
Sherlock brought his ‘John Experiments’ notebook back out, it scrawled all over with various notes on their past experiments. He would need to get a new one soon he realized fondly.
Sherlock’s face was right next to John, slightly lowered so his eyes would be paralleled with the small man.
“She was having an affair with the gardener, you can tell by the way her gloves are worn. The murder weapon should be on the other side of the house, likely hidden in the gutter drains as a quick form of disposal. Her twin was just collateral damage, walked in at the wrong moment.”
As the days went by John had showed up more and more to crime scenes and solved nearly all of them in truly impressive time. He wasn’t as good as Sherlock, but he was the next best thing and still better then anyone else alive.
Sherlock sucked in a much needed breath,
John thought he might literally pass out from the sight of a very much alive Sherlock. He was torn between grabbing hold of him and never letting go and pretending he was just some unimportant bystander, but the longer he looked into those pale green eyes he knew there was no faking his way out. He didn’t want to ever look away in fear of loosing him again anyway. Sherlock’s hand came up against John’s face and fixed where Sally had smudged his eye shadow.
Every case that Greg had gotten in the past few days he wanted to run by the consulting detective, only to remember that those days were far gone. He knew that Sherlock had his problems. But suicide? It hardly seemed like him at all. He had lived a risky lifestyle, not just chasing down criminals but the drug abuse as well. But even then, Greg couldn’t fathom that he wanted to end things. Especially since life had finally begun looking up for him. He had friends, himself included. Even a best friend. Lestrade refused to believe the things the press had been printing about him. That he was a fraud that made up being a genius. Those people didn’t know him, couldn’t know the real Sherlock Holmes. But Lestrade knew. Sherlock was an absolute genius that could solve nearly any case. If only someone was smart enough to solve the late detective’s death.
“Shit shit shit shit shit.” He knew he was suppose to stay quiet but he couldn’t resist mumbling as he ran for his life through a doll house of all places.
John furrowed his eyebrows at the phone and knocked harder, there was no way Sherlock couldn’t hear him if he was inside.
Mycroft clenched his fists. “First bees and now this? I don’t like the looks of this.”
Sherlock’s eyes lifted only momentarily to meet with John’s before dropping back down to what he was looking at, his smile growing coyer. “Nothing, looking a few articles online up.”
“Fine, fine. Lets go salt the bloody closet then. Its not like we have one of those Ouija board things for the latter.”
John frowned as he got up and slowly dressed for the day, he knew what he had to do no matter how much he didn’t want to go through with it. He confronted the sulking detective on the couch.
“Sher- lock. I’m not even discussing this with you. Eat your damn fish and can it. I’ll be back in an hour or so.”
John groaned, thinking it was too soft to hear.
“It’s my job to find them.”
“Don’t drop me” his arms dangled uselessly by his sides.
John gathered the case files up and stood, ready to leave. Lestrade noticeably relaxed. Yup, something was up. John looked at him again, trying his best to seem casual.
Sherlock sat up at that, laughing harder then ever. “A mermaid? Are you serious?” He laughed some more.
“The killer was female.” The whisper came again.
“You can’t be serious…”
“Rope like what the attacker used on their victim?” Lestrade raised and eyebrow and came closer to take a look.
“Where the hell have you two gone off too? There any evidence in here?” Lestrade called from the doorway before he saw the strange display of Sherlock’s affection inside. “Bloody hell are you two rubbin off on each other at a crime scene?”
"I do not! You should bloody hurry up with an antidote in fact."
John swallowed thickly, “Moriarty.”
John’s face went red with rage, “Get out of here Maria! I don’t love you and I don’t want to see you again! Sherlock and I love each other and you’re just going to have to get over it!”
Sherlock sat on his knees behind John and rested his chin of the soft blond hair below him, wrapping his arms around John’s shoulders. He wasn’t good with sentiment, but he would try his best for John. With Sherlock wrapped firmly around him, John let out a breath, he knew his detective didn’t like repeating himself and he had a;ready promised they would find Harry.
-How on earth did you know all that?-
Lestrade was stunned. Was it possible John really had just gone to the gym and simply left out the back door before coming home?
“To prove that I can, can you show me?” John gave her his brightest smile, he didn’t mean to be manipulative, but she really could help him out.
“John- Your blog is suppose to be about your life to help you get over the PTSD.”
Lestrade truly did not get enough credit for staying quiet in the taxi cab back to 221B while having to listen to the soft protests of “Not in his pocket, wait till we’re home,” and the worst, “Let him hear.”
There was really nothing more he could say. “Jenny! I’m joking of course!” he shot Sherlock a look of pure rage. “Ha, me and my weird sense of humor. But um, something has come up actually.”
“I think they’re gills.”
He was lucky to only be suffering a sprained ankle, if he had fallen on a hard surface he likely would have died. He slowly stood to check his surroundings in the darkened tunnel. He could feel something soft under his feet, it's what had broken his fall. He kneeled down to place a hand on the object.
Molly, posing for the moment as a private detective, had done her best to memorize the questions Sherlock had her write down. Some seemed rather unimportant, and other flat out rude, but she did her best regardless.
“Oh god…” He so easily could use it, that was why Sherlock had gotten it for him after all wasn’t it?
“Just walking home.” John tried brushing him off.
We could meet somewhere else first? Somewhere public if you’re concerned about that.
Sherlock smiled, “Apparently it’s also a popular fetish.”
“Fine, fine. Although I do think you would be getting the better end of the deal this way.”
Lestrade put the baker bag on the table, “I’ll just go change…” he noticed John eyeing the bag tentatively and brought a croissant before walking away.
“Ok, seriously, what the hell? You’ve been under water for five minutes and you’re not dead. Are you…” He felt like this was going to be the stupidest thing he ever said. “Are you a mermaid?”
“JOHN! There’s one coming from my right, get the hell out of there!”
“It does? So I could see you then?”
“How do you turn this thing off?” Lestrade looked around for a remote, but when he finally spotted it, the tv went off on its own. The detective nearly jumped out of his skin. “The hell!?” He could feel his heart pounding. He wasn’t sure why, but it just didn’t sit right with him. “You’re not pranking me, are you?”
“Aha! I knew you were here John! This isn’t funny, come out!”
Sherlock lay next to him, wishing beyond hope that he could reach out and pull him close, but apparently he was beyond the ability to touch now. “I’m so sorry John… this wasn’t suppose to happen… I wasn’t supposed to… die. Not for real. Something must have gone wrong.” He was finally understanding what was happening to him.
“Some of these are post mortem, but most were before he died. Tortured?” Sherlock glanced at Lestrade, who seemed to be a bit of a nervous wreck.
“I know he makes you mad” Molly paused to catch her breath. “He makes everyone mad. But he probably didn’t mean whatever he did or said. Please come back?”
'Shit, Sherlock, don't tell him!' John prayed to himself.
‘Please make it John. Please. One of us needs to make it out alive.’
“I know,” Sherlock’s voice was a bit softer at that.
John sighed, “Fine. But you’ll have to take it off before you’re out.” This was ridiculous but he didn’t want to work Sherlock up anymore then he had to. “Does this happen a lot? This fever or whatever it is?” He was ready to go full doctor mode.
That was the nail in the coffin. Lestrade had been a married man, even if he was going through a divorce after his wife repeatedly cheated on him, he did in fact know how women got during sales. They wouldn’t drag a significant other with them to save their lives. Shoes always came first.
Sherlock picked John up bridal style like the night before, supporting his head on his chest, limp arms hanging loosely by his sides.
John nearly shrieked. “You said you were in your mind palace!”
“Sorry about that, there’s been something wrong with the heat lately, the flat keeps getting cold spots, still haven’t figured that out.”
John gave a sharp nod and firmed his grip on his post.
“Well I should be off, groceries to buy and all that.” John tried to make a quick escape from the flat but was pinned to the wall in a flash.
As Sherlock was still hyper focused on the way the woman reacted to the string of odd questions, he felt a tug at his arm. He ignored John’s attempts until it became too distracting.
A small frame from the mantle lay on the floor with a crack in it.
“In here.” The baritone responded from the closest room.
“It’s an inanimate object, I neither like nor dislike it.” Sherlock was cut off before he was able to say anymore by John’s lips crashing against his own.
John swallowed before kneeling down near the body. “Asphyxia. There’s a blue fiber on his mouth, it matches the pillow on the bed. The body was staged, there would have been sign of a struggle but his arms are down by his sides.”
Sherlock looked off in the direction John peered in, his eyesight being greater then the doctors he easily made out what they said.
The words were such a surprise that John turned to see the detective blushing softly.
The door slammed shut on John. He immediately turned to attempt the handle, but it refused to turn. He slammed on the door and screamed out for help. There was no way Sherlock would have done this to him.
Sherlock glanced over at the kitchen at first wondering where John had gone, his eyes widened in horror as he saw the kitchen slowly burn down.
Sherlock merely grew frustrated with him.
Found John, he’s ok and safe now. Thank you for last night. John thanks you for looking after me. - SH & JW
“You’re eating Lock, I wont let you waste away.” John pointed a spatula accusingly at him.
Sherlock struggled fiercely against his restraints with every inch of his being. Before leaving Moriarty flashed a wicked smile and started a clock that had been set up near the dollhouse, causing the door keeping John in his small cube within the dollhouse to open.
"If you would just let me out-"
John sat back in his chair with a cup of tea, bemused beyond belief when his flatmate came back inside after only a few minutes of leaving the flat carrying a large cardboard box. “What’s in that?”
He could hear Mycroft following, though his pace was far from rushed. He was almost casual about the way he followed him. Greg had a sinking feeling from that, he almost knew before he grabbed the door handle again. Locked. Of course it had been.
“You’re conflicted about the way you feel. You see how ‘
Molly’s eyes widened in a panic, “But you have to! He and John… they just went into a building… and Harriet… They think they caught the killer but they need someone to be watching in case of an emergency.” Her voice grew frantic.
Sherlock’s mind was failing him for an answer, but John’s was not. The moment the hatch opened he went into soldier mode. He quickly assessed the wooden room in front of him through the small door; it was clear. Turning around to see the door behind him he could see the faint movement of long limbs. He dived through the door to the empty room in one fluid motion. Garish pink wallpaper was peeling off the splintered wood of the walls behind the cheaply made and non-functional furniture. It was clear to John the original wooden structure had been chosen to remind him of his current size. Through the door he could see the creature coming for him at a quicker pace then he had initially anticipated. The small wooden frame caused the tarantula to take additional time, it’s limbs struggled to reach John. The small man knew his only options were flight or fight. He had been listening to Moriarty though, there were six tarantulas in all, one was mere inches from him, though compared to his size it was more like a few feet, one was occupied with a rat at least for the time being, which left four more that could be anywhere in the dollhouse just waiting for him. He couldn’t take a chance by running through another room, there could be one around any corner, and with this one already hot on his trail, having two after him would most definitely end in death.
John noticed the top two buttons of Sherlock’s shirt were undone, ‘
“John?!” Lestrdae called out and tried the handle again, but to no avail. He was positive he heard someone yelling from inside.
The doctor’s eyelids fluttered
“And there you are again. I never said anything about being gay. Just that you seem infatuated with the man. Your blog that is supposedly about ‘your life’ is about your flat mate’s life. You chronicle everything about him, always bring him up in sessions. Yet whenever I ask something about him directly you always state that you are not gay.”
Moriarty snickered as his sniper closed the bag up and went for the door, shoulders blatantly tense despite his attempt at a cool manner. “Oh come on, we both know you’re not leaving.”
I just want you guys to know that I have nothing against Molly, she's a tad sad in this chapter but this wont be the end of her. Just know that she wont be in the next few chapters, but she will be coming back. I promise I don't have anything against female characters XD (I have been accused of this many a times...)
“Found a job yet?” Sherlock knew John hated asking for money and their little arrangement was the only thing that allowed him to keep his financial dignity even if it came at the cost of the rest of his dignity.
“You’re thinking too loud again. But this serves a very good purpose- think of the possibilities for following someone unseen!”
John smiled, that was close enough to his age.
“Well how was I suppose to know? She seemed normal enough at first. No different from anyone else anyway.”
“You’re not a sociopath John.” The words sat awkwardly in the air for a moment.
After a pregnant pause John pushed, “Go on.” His voice was light and sounded strangely understanding of the self proclaimed sociopath.
“I’m going to pretend that somehow made some form of sense.”
No. –
John looked at his flatmate incredulously. “You drank a gallon of milk in two days?”
Ok, now John was definitely interested. “Never? But then Mycroft was insisting that Sherlock stay home during the storm for his own good or something. Apparently it didn’t matter if I went out for a swim in the Thames for all either of them cared though. But now Sherlock’s moping about at the flat and sending me out to get files for him.”
Sherlock stared at the woman for a good thirty seconds with out word, just running his eyes across her.
John mindlessly brought his hand to his neck, lightly squeezed the side, then ran it to his shoulder.
“But sir… it… it moved…”
“I’m very selfish John.”
“Lovely, yes, and John is where exactly?”
The detective didn't move. The knocking persisted.
“Sherlock, I’m trying to talk to Greg.”
“Fine, I’ll go to clubs with you until you build your confidence up.”
Mycroft’s smile widened. “You never cease to amaze me with the feats you manage with my brother Dr. Watson.” Turning back toward Sherlock he added. “Well I’ll leave you alone until you are more willing to leave your flat. It’s been fun seeing you like this again. Until later.” He waved dismissively and left.
“It was stupid, I know. I’ll just be in m room then until it wears off.” He turned to leave but was stopped by a hand on wrist.
This thought left his mind when small metal sounds came from the lock of the door.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “It was my brother’s little ‘joke’ to put me here. Said I deserved it… for leading you on or something.”
Are you busy?
John grabbed Sherlock’s arm and practically dragged him out the door. That had been the final straw, he was going home. He didn’t care if Lestrade followed and tried to break them up or not.
“No messages,” John flicked his phone screen on and gave it a quick check before plopping it into his pocket. “Good. Rather not talk to anyone just now.” No one living at least. He headed towards the door. Deciding a bit of fresh air would do him some good.
Usually the emails by this point came twice daily, sometimes more. This time two days passed without one. Molly was worried she had said too much.
“So why is no one collecting evidence?”
“Just don’t dash off ok? I love you. I really do.”
“But, you really hypnotized him then? And it really worked?” Molly’s eyes were wide with curiosity.
“It’s not.” Sherlock scowled, not at John per say, but in general.
Chapter 21
“But you haven’t yet and you have no idea how much I appreciate you for that. You remain to be my one and only friend.”
“That was not a compliment! Why the hell did you plan on doing this to yourself?”
Sherlock was furious. “Who are you?!”
John smiled at that. “That would be nice actually. I could certainly use a few drinks.” It would beat drinking at home alone.
The taller man merely stepped out through the door, water pooling beneath ever foot step.
“I can assure you it was for a good reason.”
“Name your price, I’ll happily meet it.” the voice sounded oddly familiar to John but he couldn’t quite place it.
“Am I?”
John lay flat on his stomach praying there would soon be a way out.
Ch12 Notes:
“If you were any taller we never would have met.”
Curious, he stood and made his way to the bathroom to peer in the mirror. He could see himself quite well, though he assumed he was likely the only one that could view his own reflection now. He was wearing the same clothes as when he jumped off St. Bart’s. He was sure his corpse was probably not, it would likely have been stripped and left on a mortician’s table by now. There was no obvious cause of death, in fact, he looked rather alive. This made one thing obvious at least, the physical world apparently had no bearing on his appearance now. Though he also considered if he was what one might refer to as a ‘soul’, there was truly no need for clothing. In fact, he likely wouldn’t look like his physical form at all, genetics and souls having little to do with one another, he reasoned. But he couldn’t deny that he really did seem to look the way he always had.
John crossed his arms and shook his head.
Mycroft rolled his eyes now believing this to be a waist of his time as he previously suspected. "I'm sure he does." His voice was sarcastic.
“They’re going in, what should I do?”
John’s teeth chattered as his jar shook, every second brought him a bit more off the ledge. He tried standing at the far end in hopes of balancing the glass as long as possible.
Chapter 18
“No. Just bite. One bite. I need to John. I have to.” He was pulling John closer without realizing it. “It would hurt.” He knew if he did, he was going to sink all the way in.
Nope, we should be fine. Though if you could make me tall again it would be much appreciated. –JW
The voice seemed hesitant, “I said I would wait.”
“Feeling less curious?” Sherlock mused, chucking the soaking fabric out of the bath and onto the tile floor. Only his briefs remained.
“Find anything useful?” Molly put a large bag she brought with her by the couch and came over to look at the computer screen.
“But you never wear them.” Shrlock pouted.
John looked over at Mycroft, he stopped making his finger movement against Sherlock’s palms. The answer that would follow made him nervous.
"You're a lesbian and I have no interest in women. I recommend a new tactic." His expression remained the same.
Sherlock reached his slim pale hand out and poked John in the chest. “We should conduct a test. Feel that?”
“Look in the box.” Sherlock swallowed hoarsely, god, John was actually holding it, and in front of him at that.
He rubbed his eyes before realizing his surroundings had completely changed, or so he thought. Instead of his bed, John was laying on a massive white surface covered in an equally huge sheet. It was as if he had been kidnapped in the night and placed on the world's largest bed. The booming sound continued. John looked up, seeing his situation was growing dimmer. Furniture the size of skyscrapers lined what looked to be walls millions of kilometers high. Even Moriarty couldn't pull off something like that.
“I’ve always loved you.”
“I don’t anymore.” He said matter of factly.
“I have.”
John peered from the eyehole of the skull he hid behind; spying Harry he realized this could possibly be one of the worst days of his life. Just under being shot, having a bomb strapped to him, the time he and his date were nearly murdered when an assassin who thought he was Sherlock and….
A Promise Made is a Promise Kept
Those undulating tentacles lowered them both back to the bed, two of them prodding at the detective’s entrance. Greg’s breath left him for a moment at that. It was hardly his first time, but the thought of being breached by such an appendage was wholly different. He couldn’t imagine how the fully prehensile muscle would feel as it writhed inside him, hitting him at every angle. Lestrdae found that he was surprisingly ok with this suddenly. Somewhere in there it was still the man he had been pinning after for all this time.
Mycroft hadn’t responded to his texts after that. Maybe he should just leave the politician alone if he wanted his privacy. But Greg just couldn’t get over that uneasy feeling he had. He pressed the little green call button and held the phone up to his ear. The phone rang and rang, but no answer. He knew it was just paranoia, but he couldn’t help but imagine scenarios where Mycroft was in trouble and needed his help. Or maybe that was more a wistful daydream of his where he could swoop in and save him? John was right, this thing between them was absurd and needed to be settled. Besides, going to Mycroft’s house wasn’t such a big deal. If Mycroft really didn’t want to see him, he would just turn him away, or never open the door. The DI really hoped neither of those things would happen. But sitting around and not knowing for days on end might as well be the death of him.
”Help?” Mycroft purred, “I fully intend to take you up on that offer.”
Sherlock had wanted desperately to find something to give John even a shred of hope that they would find his sister before it was too late, but his prospects were looking dismal for the flat. They would have to attempt to retrace her footsteps. John sat against the white curved wall of the cup close enough that his leg brushed against Sherlock as he peeked into the room. He would occasionally look up glossy eyed and catch the moments the detective would look down to check on him, no hint of any leads on his expressionless face.
“That’s alright, I’ll stay here, check the place out a bit more and talk to Rogers. Might make a trip to Tescos, even.”
“I am not an “it”.” John muttered to himself.
There was no doubt, the teeth marks that puncture his hand were not human. He sprinted back to the sheet but now there was only a small lump underneath.
“Harder to open from inside?” Greg raised an eyebrow with a bit of confusion.
John couldn’t take it anymore and joined his side. The closet was empty. “What if they’re somewhere else in the flat?”
“You may stop fooling yourself, as you’re clearly aroused.”
She's boring, come back home.- SH
“John I…” he looked away.
Sherlock went quiet, there was no point to lying, Mycroft when know he was.
I know you wont get these, but I wanted you to know that you are my best friend and mean the world to me. Please stop this. Stop being dead. JW
"Any time John." The detective flicked the light off and left to experiment in the kitchen.
Mycrfot sprinted back through the doorway that separated the two rooms just as the shelf unit on the north wall slanted too far over. Mycroft dashed to hold it up before it fell on a hunched over Sherlock still mad with panic. The detective heard Mycroft moving behind him and turned in time to see a suspicious empty jam jar slide off the tilted shelf. He instinctively reached out just before the glass connected with the hard wooden floor. Just behind the label he could make out a clearly dazed John.
“How do you know that?” Donovan looked at him suspiciously.
"Harriet has gone missing."
“Para- what?”
Grace narrowed her eyes. "Oh?"
John smiled up at the detective,
“How was your day then?” the voice already seemed brighter. “Just drive home?”
“If it does, I’ll give you call. But I’m not sure how long I can keep people out here. Some big storm is supposed to come.”
“Hold on, Lock. Just calm down.” John gently pushed Sherlock’s hands away.
“Now stand up.”
"What? What is it?"
John stood awkwardly in front of the movie theater sized computer screen. He wasn’t sure if Sherlock wanted him to post anything about them being an official couple yet, he usually would become very flustered whenever John posted about his life. He looked back at the screen to find a new message.
Mycroft thought.
“Still don’t know how you can stand to live with him.” Lestrade chuckled, “If you ever need a break give me a call and we can grab a pint.”
“Hardly, if you couldn’t talk on your own the first time for hours after the initial hypnotism then you are clearly very susceptible to some forms of-“
“When Sherlock and I went to gather John back from his little misadventure, Moriarty was there. Threatened he would be back. I should have taken more precaution of course. Damn. What was I thinking?” His shoulders tensed harshly at this.
Even as Mycroft tried to stand, a tentacle wrapped around a bed post, trying to prevent him. He was loosing control of them again, which generally was a bad sign he wouldn’t be himself for long either.
She seemed a bit disappointed, “Doesn’t this affect your studies?”
I can’t. –
The DI was at his desk with a large box of donuts and looking exceptionally down. More so then when he went through his divorce a while back, it seemed.
“S-sorry…”
Lestrade was speechless.
The edges of Mycroft’s eyes had a bit of white. Greg filled the gap between them as he kissed him softly, praying that may have some affect. He nearly sobbed as his cheek and neck were gently cupped and the kiss was returned.
John knew once outside he would be caught for sure, until that painfully familiar car pulled up. If the car was there then it was pointless hiding it from Mycroft, might as well only have one of them know rather then the whole police force.
“Why? On edge? It’s really nothing to be concerned with.” Sherlock turned to deduce more about the scene.
“So I brought you the files.” Lestrade held the manila folder up and walked in, eyes jetting around the flat in search of anything suspicious.
“Anytime.” Sherlock’s eyes darted across John’s body. “Can you feel anything?”
"Help me on the bed?"
John nodded. He hadn’t thought of that either. It was too finalizing. “Of course that git didn’t have a will.” He never had any friends outside of them to will things to.
John looked up, his attacker was laying sprawled out against the cold sand. Everything was eerily quiet, he stood to get a better look at the man who now had a massive cavity in his chest. The sight was horrific and yet he couldn't take his eyes away from him.
John found himself stealing glances whenever he could at the still undeniable mystic that was Sherlock from across the small booth. Sherlock ate exceptionally slow, practically picking at his food with a difficult expression to read.
“I believe someone may have abducted my brother, I need you to form a search party immediately.”
Lestrade wasn’t sure how to respond to that. “Bee keeping? Really?”
“Sherlock?” a small voice chimed from behind them, “Are you two ok?” Molly looked worriedly at John as Sherlock struggled to pull him to his feet.
“What about tea? I’ll make you some-“ He stood to grab the kettle.
John grabbed his jacket while shaking his head knowing Sherlock would never change. His mad flatmate was already in a cab waiting for him by the time he got downstairs.
The moment before John was thinking how silly this was but he soon found himself falling forward, if Sherlock hadn’t quickly dropped and held him up by the shoulder’s he knew he would have fallen face first into the ground.
John’s hand trailed down the sheets. This was wrong. He knew he wasn’t moving on and he had to get sleep for work in the morning. He turned to head for his own room.
John sighed, ‘
“Would you prefer that I only take you out on experiments then?”
"Yes, erm, it's none of my business."
John didn't feel it as his legs went out, or Sherlock holding him up. "Harry…."
Sherlock scoffed. “John, you just don’t understand.” His hand reached for him.
Copying my text signature now? And should I be insulted that I’m the only one?- SH
Sherlock stepped closer to him and slid his arms around John’s waist. “We’re in this together remember?”
Sherlock let out a loud hiccup and covered his mouth. “I change my mind.” He turned to leave for his room.
-You’re an idiot. I’m not booting you. Do you have skype?-
Harry’s flat looked about the same as John and Sherlock checked it out the day before. There would clearly be no evidence here and Harry’s disappearance had likely occurred elsewhere.
“You haven’t been taking your pills have you? They really do help with the nightmares John, I think you should really consider it.”
The next day brought another crime scene.
“Hm.” John thought for a moment, “What do you look like?”
Sherlock instead dived his head back under the water, letting the air press out of his nose. That was better. He could breath much easier like this, though he wasn’t sure how.
