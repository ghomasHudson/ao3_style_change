“I will.” Dean says, and he knows it isn’t a lie. “Just gotta make sure I get the chance too, and make it out alive tomorrow.”
Scattered in front of the ship, are the bodies of the creatures that had chased after the dogs. And standing before the bodies, is Jo Harvelle with her gun in hand.
He has to stop and wonder for a moment, is this really it for him? His last mission is rescuing the only survivor left out of a murder scene, and then just walking away. He’ll go home, get settled, marry the love of his life, and live peacefully on Earth. Once he gets on that ship again, he and Cas are done. It seems so simple when he really thinks about it.
When Dean looks out the window of the cockpit this time, he feels so sure about it. Much more than any other time he’d contemplated what life would be like for him after the military. He knows he’ll miss these stars, and the constant beauty of their light flashing by in front of his eyes. But he knows that when he’s settled back on Earth, he’ll have something even more beautiful with him, and he won’t have to hurdle himself through space to see it.
“Maggie, Lylah, stick to Jo.” Cas gestures towards his teammate and the dogs move to stand behind her. Dean knows that if there’s a chance for them to make it out too, Cas will let them go. There’s no point in them staying behind to watch the fight.
For once their mother isn’t huffing and puffing at them over their language, and instead just grabs Dean and pulls him in for a tight hug.
He turns back to look at his brother every few feet on the walk to the exit, and Sam never takes his eyes off him. Dean gives a final wave before they’re completely out of view, and then that’s it. He is now officially stuck living with this guy he doesn’t know, with no mom, and no Sammy.
proudly printed across the side. Young Dean had always wanted to take a ride in a police car, but he isn’t getting any enjoyment out of it now. Once they’re on the road, and the airport is long behind them, Dean decides he wants to avoid any further awkward discussion for as long as he possibly can, and pulls his headphones out of his bag.
He decides to just sit and watch the stars until he finally feels tired enough to go to bed, soaking in everything that Sam had said. Dean knows he deserves it, knows Cas definitely deserves it too, and he is excited, but also extremely nervous. This has been his life for a decade; constant travel from planet to planet, putting his life on the line on a daily basis. What will it be like to adjust to something new? Will he even be able to adjust, or will he long to go back to what he’s used to?
this. He’d beg her for any other possible way for this to go, but he knows all that would do is make her feel guilty, and that’s not his goal. But just...
When they reached the lab, they found her. A woman hidden in one of the storage closets, her name was Donna Hanscum, she was the only person left. Donna told them that she, Josie, and two other crew members had managed to get to safety, away from the monsters, and quickly sent their message begging for help. Unfortunately, Josie and the others had been injured at some point before they got away from the slaughter, and Donna couldn’t do much to save them. She was forced to watch as the last few members of her crew, her friends, bled out.
“I couldn’t sleep. It’s not the first time this has happened, you should be used to it by now.” He says, petting her head softly. “And if you’re out here, your sister can’t be far behind.”
“We’ll call you tonight, when we get to the new house.” She pulls back and sets her hand on his cheek. “I know you don’t like it now, but you’ll be fine.” Dean nods and she kisses his forehead. “I love you.”
The Board quickly approved a rescue mission to bring back any survivors who might still be out there; employing Dean Winchester, Castiel Shurley, Benjamin Lafitte, Victor Henrikson, Joanna Harvelle, Jody Mills, and their search-and-rescue canines Lylah and Maggie, to get the job done.
And maybe Dean was being really unfair to the guy, after all, he had been completely willing to let Dean stay with him, pay for the rest of his schooling, and change his home life around to fit Dean in, but that didn’t matter. All that mattered to Dean was the fact that he was leaving his mom and his brother, and being forced to live with a practical stranger.
The other creatures are distracted for a moment by Dean’s cry, and it gives Jo just the right window of time to grab Donna and run for it.
“Of course I won’t forget. How could forget my pain in the ass little brother?” Dean says as he ruffles Sam’s mop of hair. “And when you get to California, will you finally cut this mess?” That earns him an elbow to the ribs when his brother finally lets go.
He remembered what it looked like inside, the carnage that lay waiting for them. The blood splattered on every single surface, bodies littering the floor. He remembers the slow, dreadful search. It was like torture, moving through each section off the base and waiting for one of those monsters to pop out. There was a tight coil building in his chest, ready to snap in a second.
“That was one time!” Dean covers his eyes as laughter erupts from around him. He knew he was never going to live that down. But they’d been in a hurry, and it only took a minute for him to realize and turn around.
“Love you too, mom.” Once the goodbyes are finished and everyone’s got their hug in, Dean picks up his bag and turns to his father. “Ready when you are.”
Dean smiled at his brother’s words. He was right, he had done this a hundred times before. For every mission Dean and his team had, he would give Sam a check-in call. It was honestly a little depressing. Each call being a “this is just in case I don’t make it out and I need one more chance to talk to you” kind of affair, but Dean loved that no matter how many times they’d done this, Sam never failed to tell him to be careful and to let him know that he loved him.
The creature on top of Dean leaps off of him and lunges in their direction, the others following suit, and then the dogs turn around and take off; flying back down the hallway to the entrance, taking the creatures with them.
Cas has already prepared him a small bowl of cereal, which he accepts gratefully with a kiss to Cas’ cheek.
“I won’t try to leave.” Dean says, and he feels the bed sink as the dogs rejoin them. Lylah contently keeps herself curled up at the corner on Cas’ side near his feet, but Maggie insists on crawling over Cas to curl up next to Dean, like she’s also trying to keep him there.
A few tense moments pass of just listening as the thudding approaches them… and then the coil that had been building in Dean’s chest finally snaps as the first creature walks into view.
“Did you talk to Sam?” Cas asks after a few moments of silence, when he can tell Dean still isn’t asleep yet.
“Talking to Sam couldn’t wait until a reasonable hour?” Jo raises an eyebrow at him, but Dean doesn’t react. He’s a grown man who can talk to his brother whenever he damn well pleases, thank you very much.
They start to make their way out of the base, and then they realize just how quiet it is. There’s no gunfire, no screeching from the monsters, and no barking dogs. Another coil starts to build in Dean’s chest. That could either be really good, or really bad.
The Planetary Expansion Board, leaders and innovators of interstellar travel, discovered Patara six months ago at the edge of the Enochian solar system. A research team had been sent out to investigate its environment, and see if it was a livable planet for humans.  They received confirmation when the team touched down on the planet, and everything seemed to be going well. But after two days, all communication with the research base was lost. After another few days, the distress signal came in.
The boys’ mother worked as a successful health and wellness writer. The job came with its perks; she could work from home, and while she wasn’t exactly rich, money wasn’t a problem. When she’d agreed on moving to California if Sam was accepted into Edlund Prep, she hadn’t seen any issues. She could easily move from one state to another and still be able to write, she found a nice house just a few miles away from Sam’s new school, everything seemed fine… Until she saw the price of attendance. Even with her larger-than-average paycheck, to send Sam to this school would mean putting quite a bit of stress on her wallet. It was still do-able, but then there was the added cost of sending Dean to school as well. There was simply no way she could afford to send Sam to Edlund Prep and also pay for Dean to go to a separate school for two more years to finish high school. She thought her only option was to tell Sam they couldn’t do it, but it was at that moment that her ex-husband came to mind. At first she thought it’d be rude to ask something like this of a man she only spoke to a few times a year anymore, someone who has his own life. But then she remembered that he’s not just her ex-husband, but the boys’ father too. It wasn’t an unreasonable request, and he might even be happy to do it - he had mentioned wanting to get to know his sons if they’d give him a chance. So she made the call, asking if he would mind Dean living with him for two years to finish school in Lawrence, as well as paying for said schooling. And, to her surprise, the answer was an enthusiastic “Yes, I would love to have him here!” Now came the hard part, telling Dean. At first, there had been the expected reaction “Is there no other option?”, but when it was made clear to him that there really is no other way, he agreed. And so, here they are, waiting just outside of an airport restaurant for her ex-husband to get here and bring Dean to his new home for the next two years.
Dean tells himself then, that if he’s going to die, this is the best way to do it. He’ll go down surrounded by his comrades. And he’ll die knowing that they saved Donna, that she’s going to make it out of here and live the rest of her life. The only thing he wishes for is that he’d at least gotten to marry Cas.
Once Jo has been somewhat revitalized with a few sips from her coffee, she fixes Dean with a hard stare.
“Humor lies in the eye of the beholder, Sam. I thought it was hilarious.” Truthfully, he hadn’t thought it was
“Is he excited about you coming home for good?” Jo asks before taking a sip of her morning go-juice.
“You know,” Victor eventually says, “I don’t think Benny would want us to hang around here any longer just to bring back a body.” It seems so wrong, but they know it’s true. Benny would tell them to move their asses, and ask why they were still standing there in the first place.
“Alright. Well Dean, I guess we should be off?” And it only takes a second for Sammy to latch on. His arms are tight around Dean’s waist.
The atmosphere of the airport was rather cruel. Not that anyone was rude or harsh, quite the opposite, everyone went about their business as usual, paying little attention to the people around them and focusing only on getting to their own flights or finding an end to their boredom as they sit through a long wait. But that was just it, no one was paying attention. No one cared for the teenager sitting at a table with his mom and brother in front of one of the restaurants in the shopping center. No one stopped and offered to rescue Dean from his grimm fate.
anything that meant he wouldn’t have to be stuck in Lawrence, Kansas with his father that he barely knows, while the rest of his family is all the way in California.
“You think they’ll be alright?” Cas asks, and the sound of his voice makes Dean want to wrap him up in his arms. He knows Cas would be destroyed if anything happened to them.
“Well the hope is they’ve left since then, but considering this is an unknown species, and one that apparently our gear won’t be able to see coming, we need to be prepared for anything. Dr. Sands’ message said that most of their crew had already been killed but that there were some survivors. We don’t know how many of those survivors, if any, are still alive, but we are going to do a full sweep of the base to make sure that even if there is just one breathing soul left there, we get them out of there safely. If one of these things does show up, shoot on sight.” Jody’s response to her order is a sharp nod from each of the members of her team, and a resounding “Yes, commander.”
The change in question was retirement. After ten years of service, this being his last mission, Dean was finally saying goodbye to the military. Of course, he wouldn’t be alone. Joining him on the train to a new life would be his fiance, Cas. They’d met when they were assigned to the same team, and it hadn’t taken long for a strong bond to grow between them.
“I’m just gonna listen to some music.” He tells his father before he slips them on, and tries to forget his problems within the sounds of Zeppelin.
In the split second before the shooting begins, Dean can see that it’s a humanoid figure; its limbs are long and lanky, and its silhouette in the dark hallway almost looks like a tired old man. It’s flesh is pale, and milky white. And it hasn’t got a face, just a huge, gaping mouth.
“It took you long enough to get out here.” She says. “Now, I want all of your asses on that ship. I can see more of these things coming in the distance and I want us to be long gone by the time they make it here.”
And of course it’s only now, when Dean is actually ready to go to sleep, that Cas decides to be chatty.
“I’m sure they will be.” Dean squeezes his shoulder to calm him. “They’re fast, they can get away if they need to. And right now we need to get out of here before those things decide to come back.”
“Up and out, people! Let’s go!” Jody’s voice was loud and clear, and Dean wonders how she’s always been so energetic in the morning.
When they make it out to the parking lot, Dean can quickly figure out which car is his father’s. It’s definitely the Dodge Charger that has
Cas makes his way over to Dean and sits himself right on his lap, resting his head on Dean’s shoulder. “You don’t have to apologize. I felt you leave the bed and I knew you were going to call Sam, so I let you go. But it’s getting late, and we both need to be rested for tomorrow.”
“Honestly Dean, this could be so good for you.” The voice makes Dean turn away from the intense eye contact he’d established with a chipped tile on the floor. His mother has a warm, reassuring smile on her face that he wished could actually do anything for him. She reaches out to put a hand on his shoulder. “It’s a chance for you and father to spend the time together you never got to before. I know it’s going to be awkward at first, but give it time.” She continues to smile at him, but it still does nothing.
“Please give me just five more minutes.” Dean hears his muffled groan after the pillow lands directly on his head.
One of them managed to get close enough, dug it’s long, sharp talons deep into his stomach, and then yanked its hand back out.
one who calls him Sammy. Not even their mom holds that privilege. But he holds his tongue, and surprisingly, Sam doesn’t correct him either, just responds with a nod. Dean can tell this is awkward for him too. Luckily their father is able to read the tension of the moment and doesn’t let it simmer.
He makes his way over to them, and their mother stands. “Hello, John.” She gives him a friendly, one-armed hug that Dean thinks should be more awkward than it looks. He nods to her with a small smile and the simple reply of “Mary” before turning to his sons.
“Sure thing, Benny. But then you’ll have to deal with Jody. So which route do you wanna take?” With that, Benny is up and moving, so Dean leaves to go get some breakfast from the kitchen.
In the half-second before the creature lunges for his face, Dean can see that creature pinning Victor has moved it’s attention to Jody. It grabs her, and plunges its claws into her side.
The exact events that unfolded the moment the set foot on the base had become fuzzy and unclear to Dean, but certain points stood out.
“Alright, alright, we’ve had a laugh but now it’s time to focus.” Jody says, her face noticeably going into full commander mode. She places a hologram projector onto the table, and then the team has a 3D blueprint of the Patara research base laid out in front of them. “We already know the P.E.B received a distress signal from the base a few days after the research team touched down. The woman in the message identified herself as Doctor Josie Sands, one of the board’s leading scientists in planetary research. She said that whatever these things are that attacked, were somehow hidden from any of their readings. That planet never showed any signs of life, so when they went down there, they thought they were alone. Luckily, we know that they’re there now, so we'll be ready for them if they decide to show up again.”
Dean doesn't have to ask to know what Sam is asking about, they’ve discussed it enough at this point.
Dean sat alone in the cockpit of the ship, watching the stars go by. Sam’s voice coming from the communicator was a huge comfort in the otherwise dead silence. Though it was never truly silent, Dean had just grown used to the white noise of the inner workings of the ship. Everyone else on his team was asleep, but Dean found that he wasn’t tired, so he decided to get in one more call to home before they reached Patara.
He snaps head in the direction of the entrance to the base, and sure enough, just a few feet away, there they are.
As he takes in all of the unfamiliar surroundings, all of the buildings, signs, and streets, he reminds himself that this isn’t permanent.
When he finally does get up, he notices that Benny has tugged a pillow over his head, attempting to block out any more noise and grasp at whatever few moments of sleep he can still get. Dean grabs a pillow off he and Cas’ bed and flings it and him.
Cas, Dean, and Victor all take a moment to stare at each other and try to process what just happened, before they rush over to Jody.
Victor spoke up then. “It’s been three days since that signal came in, what are the chances those things are still hanging around the base?”
“Actually, I’ve come to invite you to mine.” A gravelly voice speaks. “And this one actually involves
to go to the bathroom, so Cas leads them to the designated area of the ship for them to relieve themselves, while Dean stays behind and struggles to find the strength to pull himself out of bed and get his uniform on.
It would be quite a move, all the way from Chicago, but she’d do anything to make Sam happy. That happiness though, it came with stipulations. There was one member of the family who wouldn’t be joining them on their little trek across the country, and they would have to make a stop in Kansas to drop him off.
Dean hears the scream before he sees what happened. His eyes shoot to the source of the sound, and his grip on the gun’s trigger falters. It’s Benny.
“I’m fine, I’m fine.” She says, but her face is pulled into a tight grimace, and her hand is clamped down over her wound. “Can we talk about what the hell just happened? Did those dogs seriously just distract the monsters for us?”
But Dean says nothing, even though the ‘shred of grace’ is news to him. He knows better than to play into a demon’s trap. He can practically hear the cogs whirring in Sam’s mind as he wrestles between quick attempt at an exorcism or somehow creating a devil’s trap without it noticing. It seems impossible.
, but I was a little selfish in the process,” Castiel smiles, a little braver than he actually feels. “When I thought I would raise Jack and live in that house, I hoped you’d be able to join us one day. You and Sam, for as long as you wanted. We all loved the bunker, and I know you were happy there, but I wanted you to know that there was also a place for you when you were done.”
“You heading out with Eileen then?” Dean doesn’t miss the glance from Castiel, the slightly arched eyebrow then familiar frown.
“Everything I know of you I know because of him,” the Shadow sneers, leaning over Dean alarmingly close. “All of his regrets, his pain. It’s all you.”
"Yeah," Dean starts. He fidgets with the feel of Castiel's trenchcoat under his fingers. "I never expected to end up
There is a pause while Dean chokes down his breakfast and chases it with a beer that he barely remembers bringing to the table and he stares at the scratches and knocks that have marred the wood beneath his hands. He runs his fingertips over them, to just feel something. To feel anything. The wood catches against his skin and he breathes.
“It’s not much,” Castiel wants to look away. He wants to look at anything, but his gaze has been captivated. “Small two-bed lakeside cottage, like Kelly’s house. There’s a fishing spot out back and a garage, if you need it.”
“You’re not listening,” he says. He’s trying not to sound confrontational, but it happens anyway, because this is Dean. And this is what he does. The edge of anger hits his words, and he cringes slightly as he hears it.
Within seconds he thinks of his father and crushes it, thinks about Lee and being sent away and a childhood of fear, of constantly fighting, of the apple-pie life that imploded in his face, and then this – Castiel and that stupid dog. Castiel who always comes back, who never leaves him for long. Castiel who sees him as clear as a bright sunny day and loves him anyway.
Over the next couple of days, Dean pretends like the conversation never happened. He cooks food, watches TV, shares his favourite horror movies with Castiel, and reluctantly takes him shopping for more clothes when he asks. The trenchcoat stays though. No matter how many different tops, pants or ties he may now have, the trenchcoat remains. Dean doesn’t know whether to be glad about it or not, but he remains painfully aware that the flash of tan fabric in his peripheral is instantly soothing.
Dean grips Castiel’s chest, hard, as though trying to reach in and actually touch his heart. But instead, he counts the beats, the impossible beats. Another trick from Heaven.
It’s just as he’s drifting that Miracle decides to leap up and cock his head at the corner of the room. Dean’s laptop screen flickers slightly, the tape skips and the lights go out momentarily.
Sam conducts the spell with relative ease which doesn’t surprise him. The sign of the Empty opening before him, from the same wall it burst in on before, takes his breath away for a moment but he gathers himself after a few seconds.
But at that, Castiel does finally look up, sees the amusement on Dean’s face and allows himself a small breath, for comfort more than anything.
Sam is kneeling next to them, trying to reach to check a pulse but Dean doesn’t even want to think about it. He knows Donna is stood to the side with her hands over her mouth, but still, he doesn’t want to know.
“Sam’s face looks incredibly red,” Castiel winces sympathetically, as Sam heaves another box to his room.
“We’re not doing it,” Dean stands, grabs his now-empty plate and makes to wash it up. End of discussion. Pointless discussion to have in the first place. But then, suddenly and without permission:
The room is as sparse as it always has been. The bed is made, barely slept on. The wardrobe empty, personal items never there to be missed and not a single thing that indicates the room has ever been used, let alone occupied for several years.
Every time Sam asks him for more, for a better explanation, he finds himself bracing for impact, but he doesn’t know why. This is Castiel’s secret. And yet his insides scramble and his feet are ready to run because the dots connect themselves and he knows it and Castiel probably knew it, so he can only assume Sam does too.
“Hey, we all want him back,” Sam tries to joke, but Dean catches his eyes filling slowly and smiles. “Just be careful, okay?”
“We’re wasting time here,” Dean flings open the driver side door and throws himself into his seat. His heart is hammering in his chest, his palms are starting to feel clammy, but his head feels like a whole load of cotton wool. He’s just fuzzy. Bile begins to rise from his stomach and god, why can’t Sam just
And when Sam scarpers to his room as soon as they get back to the bunker, Dean lets himself smile, easy and peaceful, free, sparing a glance to the clouds before he drags Castiel by the lapels into his bedroom.
Dean can only look at him. Suddenly there’s nothing to worry about. The news of Castiel’s grace restoring assuages his guilt and as it leaves him, Dean can’t take his eyes off of him. Castiel has bruises that he hasn’t quite healed yet and he looks an absolute mess, but Dean can see the spark in his eyes, can see the tiniest speck of angel that has come back to life and he can’t. stop. staring. He wonders, briefly, if this continues for even another minute, just how long he can keep it up without kissing Castiel. But:
“Cas, it’s me,” he says by way of explanation, but it doesn’t do any good because Castiel isn’t moving and Dean’s pretty sure one of his legs is broken. “Come on, man, before it comes back.”
“I don’t think dogs take much notice of television, but I thought hearing some familiar sounds might make him miss his brothers and sisters a little less,” Castiel explains and is rewarded with a pleasant grumble from Miracle as he continues to fuss a little.
Castiel nods and stands to join Dean where he is trying not to pace. Trying not to sweep a lamp from the table to the floor. “Alright, Dean. I’m sorry, I didn’t know you felt that way. I’ll be more careful.”
“I’m sorry because you shouldn’t have to arrive here and find an angel squatting in your house. It’s unprofessional and actually, a bit rude,” Castiel explains, a well-rehearsed apology. One he knew he was always going to make because when has he ever been able to tear himself away from Dean Winchester? “No one else has had to go through it and you shouldn’t either. I just… I missed you. All of you. You and Sam, and Jack, were the only real family I ever had and even though I was stuck
Dean just continues yelling, shuts the Shadow’s voice from his mind. He’s not listening, he won’t listen. He can see the shapes moving and squirming behind the Shadow, behind this tortured, hopeless version of himself and he knows he’s winning. He yells some more, laughs some more, and groans a little when his body wants him to stop, when his lungs feel like they might give in.
“I know,” Dean plates the bacon and hopes to… Jack that Sam can’t see the slight wobble of the pan in his hand.
Dean is halfway through processing how significant this contact is, how much of a potential lead he has in his hands right now, when he cuts himself off and gets to it. Naomi doesn’t want to hang around and neither does Dean.
“You sure it’s a demon?” There’s a hope barely beginning to bloom deep in Dean’s chest. When you kill a demon, there is only one place they end up.
Sam passes him the angel blade and he tucks it into his belt next to the demon knife. He keeps his gun in its holster and gears himself to move. The portal, covered in the same thick black mess that consumed Castiel, settles in its open state, ready to swallow him whole. Like last time, Castiel doesn’t emerge. He’s not going to walk out. But:
“I hope so,” Dean says around a mouthful. “I keep wondering if I did something wrong, but I think it was the Shadow.”
“Don’t you worry,” Dean jokes, because it’s about all he can do. He’s grateful for the opportunity when he feels like he’s choking. “I’ll be my usual charming, reckless self. We’ll be back before you know it.”
“Cas-” Dean starts, taking it all in, as slowly as he can. And then, when he is done, he explains: “When we found you and Kelly, I wanted to understand why you chose this and why you didn’t just
Dean still can’t see a lot, but he can see some of the black swirling just beyond the Shadow. Strange forms beginning to take shape, made entirely of the substance of the Empty – made of nothing and everything all at once.
“What are you watching?” Dean asks, throwing himself down into the other recliner and offering Castiel one of the beers in his hands. Castiel takes it awkwardly, trying not to disturb Miracle who Dean can now see is fast asleep.
“Sorry,” Dean rubs his face with the palm of his hand, furiously attempting to wipe his bad decisions away. “You don’t-”
“This doesn’t make any sense,” Sam is getting frustrated with him. Dean knows it’s fair, but Sam just cannot understand. He has no idea.
Dean is begging Castiel to get it. To know that he can’t just say it. That the mere thought of it lights him up on the inside and strangles him at the same time.
“I heard your prayers, and I’ve been watching over you,” he says, so earnestly, so unintentionally. Dean feels it deep inside, wonders if Jack knows just how alike Castiel he really is. If he so much as tilts his head, Dean’s going to be a wreck.
Dean knows this mission is hopeless and they have no leads and no one willing to help. But he can’t stop looking for a way. He was fighting for their freedom? Their peace? Their paradise? Chuck never wanted him to have it at all.
That doesn’t sit so easily with Dean, doesn’t settle in his stomach the way he needs it to. But he can give his kid what he wants, one last time. “I’ll try,” is all he can muster but the way Jack smiles back makes it worth the effort.
“It wasn’t going to let him leave,” Dean explains, trying not to relive the memory of fighting alone, no guarantee of success. “I don’t know what happened, but it just gave up. His grace was probably the price for freedom, to shut me up.”
“You know I actually don’t know if we have,” Dean laughs miserably. “We might start another apocalypse.”
“Wasn’t really a choice. He was the last dog on Earth, found him after Chuck zapped everyone to nowhere, after-” Dean tries to explain but he still can’t say it. “When everyone came back, he sort of stayed with me.”
“It’s not far from the Roadhouse,” Castiel continues, trying to fill the silence. He feels awkward. He feels clumsy and impatient and
Sam has prepared the ingredients and has the spell written down, Eileen, Jody and Claire are ready to fight whatever they need to, Donna too. Alex is hanging back with Miracle, by the map table, just in case.
"You can have it, Cas," Dean says, still unable to offer him exactly what he means. "What you want, that is. If you still want it."
“Shut your eyes,” he hears faintly and does, but even through his eyelids he can see a blinding amount of light erupt from Castiel. Just as Dean opens his eyes, Castiel’s hand slips from his neck completely and the glow around him fades as he falls to the floor, unconscious.
Castiel leans against the nearest wall as Dean circles the coffee table, shuffling some of the photos around: Dean and Sam as children, John and Mary before they were married, Dean and Mary when she came back…
“Okay,” Dean starts. “Rule number one: don’t ask me for relationship advice. Rule number two: you know Eileen better than anyone, Sammy. You know if she’ll want the big gesture.”
And Dean can’t take his eyes off of him. He’s seen it a thousand times before, he knows how good Castiel is in a fight, but this is
Sam nods, slowly, deep in thought. Dean can only imagine what he’s thinking, all they’ve been through and Dean is asking him to take yet another almighty risk, to walk right into the resting place of so many of their enemies. He’s a piece of shit for even bringing it up. He’s so selfish. He can’t ask Sam to do this, he can’t risk Lucifer or any of them walking free one more time. This is their happy ending and Dean wants to throw it all away for…
And something shifts and Dean feels younger and Sam feels wiser and god, if that doesn’t make Dean feel
“Miracle,” Castiel says, without guessing. Because he knows. Because he looked to the moon last night and he felt the shift, and he wondered if Jack left him just a spark of grace after all.
Castiel steps over to him, pulls him close, and presses a kiss on his mouth without even thinking. Because every kiss had been in private until now. Every touch confined to the bunker.
“Alright,” Dean sighs, content and enthusiastic, after several moments. “Let’s go find a bar that gives you little umbrellas in your drinks.”
Castiel's eyes widen ever so slightly, and his mouth parts a little with surprise, but not for long before an impish amusement finally takes over his face.
“Eventually,” Castiel smiles, finally, honestly. “Everyone you’ve loved and lost is here, no restrictions. Your dog will get here, Sam will be along one day, perhaps with Eileen and Jody and the girls. They’re all here and the rest will get here.”
"So, what you're saying is... I am your type?" again, with the air-quotes, but this time they make Dean laugh. He's happy to see Castiel beaming, like he hasn't seen in a long time, at Dean's amusement.
Research is hard and Dean all but gives up. Beer starts his day. Whiskey ends it. Over and over, between rounds of bacon and burgers and pizza and cartoons and hunts so easy he wonders if the people they’re trying to save couldn’t have just done it themselves. The books lay over the library tables, the kitchen table, in stacks around Dean’s room and in the moments when he’s feeling even just a speck of hope, he might look in them one more time, one last time, just one more read-through…
He knows he doesn’t want anything to risk this moment he’s in right now – his loved ones are the safest they’ve ever been. He doesn’t want something as mundane as a vamp nest or errant spirit to interrupt that. He won’t put Castiel back on the front line and he refuses to leave him.
Clutch, gear shift, gas, gas, gas, and finally the beach is before them. He slams the brakes and is out of the door before the engine has had a chance to calm. He gives the Impala a courtesy pat on the hood as he rounds the car, grasps at Castiel’s hand, who has Miracle’s lead, and pulls them to the sand.
Within three days, the Impala is packed, hugs are exchanged, and they take off without a plan or a schedule and only one goal. They’ll be back at the bunker one day, and Dean hasn’t seen his last hunt, but this is the break he’s earned. This is the break he fought so hard for.
He takes a second to wonder if Castiel will look like that. What if he appears to him like this? Would it be okay? Would he have to find a new vessel? Would that change… anything?
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean murmurs, breathless, as he moves closer, urgently, grabs Castiel and presses his mouth insistently to his. Dean’s hands clamour for the trenchcoat’s lapels and use them to pull Castiel even closer. He feels Castiel try to gasp for breath before he pushes Dean back into the wall he was just pinned to by the vampire, kissing him back just as desperately.
“Okay,” Dean finally says after what feels like an entire other lifetime. His eyes haven’t moved. “Take me home then.”
He tries to stay on mission when he spots the mixtape. In a room so devoid of anything, Dean doesn’t know what to expect. It hits him harder than the ID card as he remembers the hours he spent making it – recording, pausing, rewinding, recording, no- made a mistake, rewind, start again, record – just so Castiel had a little piece of Dean with him when he wasn’t around, when he was venturing on his own to both help and fight angels. He didn’t think that Castiel knew what it meant for Dean to make it, the hours he spent gearing up to give it to him, the many playlists he wrote out and edited and discarded but here it lives, in the only space Castiel ever really had to call home. Here it sits amongst his incredibly few personal items, now a relic, a headstone of who he was and the space he occupied in Dean’s life.
He leaves Sam behind, bewildered and confused in the kitchen, and doesn’t look back. This isn’t a conversation he’s having today. This isn’t a conversation he
“Maybe not, but I want to see him,” Dean says, his confidence betraying the chaos beneath his skin. “Don’t make me fight you.”
It has his face but it’s a face he hasn’t worn in many years. He sees the Mark of Cain on the Shadow’s arm and can almost feel the blood on his face as he stares right at it. Castiel’s blood, probably.
“Sorry if we’re not entertaining enough for you,” Dean laughs but it’s not funny. “I’m sure you can get cable upstairs if you’re bored.”
He presses his finger into a deep scratch in the wood so hard it leaves an indent on his fingertip. If he does it again it might bruise. So, he does.
“Bobby needs to keep his mouth shut,” Castiel mumbles, with a gentle roll of his eyes. Dean laughs, suddenly, and Castiel feels it like an electric shock as it sparks in his middle. The last shred of grace clinging on jolts in his throat as he looks at Dean, who is looking at him, sincerity and peace and comfort dripping off of him.
Sam is staring at the elephant in the room and begging Dean to look at it, but the elephant is crushing Dean clear as day in a room with an audience, where he can’t bear to feel vulnerable. He drops the plate in the sink and makes for the doorway.
Dean squirms a little in his chair and hides the way his body forces a smile back. He’s sitting opposite Castiel at one of the tables and accidentally knocks his foot whilst trying to wriggle away from the implications in that one simple sentence.
Castiel remembers the hand of God reaching into the Empty to raise him up, and he remembers the feeling of renewed grace filling up in all the places it had left him. He sees Dean in the Heaven he made (
It takes less than 24 hours for Sam to recruit Eileen, Jody, Claire and Donna to the cause. Alex comes along too “in case of any medical emergencies”, she reasons, but Dean knows it’s because she misses them. And suddenly, as though in a blink, Dean is stood in the library amongst them and they’re ready to go.
He makes it to the library without incident, thoughts of needing the archangel blade to hand, of Lucifer breaking free, of the portal to the Empty not being entirely closed and having Satan himself walking free in his home.
But Sam still wants to go chasing monsters, clinging to some idea that this will bring Dean back to life, will drag him away from the books, that this will take away the memory of being healed, grace running through and over his injuries, of seeing a trenchcoat in his peripheral, the sound of wings from many moons ago. But Dean is still only interested in chasing one monster. He just doesn’t know if it’s him or if it’s Nothing.
“We found something that can restore the warding to it’s full potential,” Eileen says and Dean knows that’s not the end of it. “If angels are getting in undetected then it’s not safe.”
Castiel rolls his eyes, like the answer is obvious, and steps aside. Dean grips the tape so hard he thinks it might break.
“I think we should restore the angel warding, Dean,” Sam says, more confident than he was when he started.
Dean’s eyes widen and he immediately stands up straight, pulling Castiel along with him, coffee long abandoned. “Run,” is the only instruction he gives Castiel before they take off through the back of the library and find their way to Dean’s bedroom.
“Yes,” Castiel knows there is no point in lying but he can’t make eye contact. He can’t look at him. “I’m sorry.”
Dean closes his eyes for a moment and steels himself. He allows himself to run his thumb over the photo, carefully, gently, like a promise, before he pushes it back into the drawer.
“I’ve wanted nothing else for months,” Dean admits with a harsh exhale. “I just wanted to go back to before Chuck, before everything. Just you, me and Sam hunting. Just doing our jobs. It was the last thing I thought about before… well before the next thing I knew I was drinking beer with Bobby.”
“No, he wasn’t,” Dean teases in his most absurd voice, wiggling his eyebrows, incredibly pleased with himself and delighting in the disgust that immediately shows on Sam’s face.
“Sure do!” Donna has a spring in her step and an unwavering smile, and after a quick clean-up and a story for the demon’s previous vessel to take home, they dutifully follow her.
It makes a horrific kind of sense that Castiel would sacrifice himself to the one place that no one had ever heard of, and no one knew about until they got there. It makes a sick karmic sense that Castiel’s final moments have doomed Dean to a mission he can’t possibly fulfil, to a point of no return. It’s almost nihilistic but Dean thinks he deserves it.
“It doesn’t matter!” Dean eventually explodes. “My feelings or whatever, none of it matters. What does matter is that he is stuck in the middle of God knows what probably living out his worst nightmares every single day and we might have a shot at saving him, bringing him home. I want you with me on this, but I’ll do it on my own if I have to.”
Dean dares to look at him and sees the universe in Jack’s eyes. He sees the millennia of existence, creation and myriad worlds and stars. He sees paradise, and with the smallest glimmer of hope he finally wants in on it.
Dean sees Castiel in the dog gently grumbling at the end of his bed. He sees him every time he walks past room 7b, host to many an abomination and atrocity but none quite so sinister as the sight of the Shadow. Dean feels the warmth of Castiel's hands around the tumbler sitting next to the decanter of the whiskey he always pretended he enjoyed.
paradise. Maybe this is Dean’s ‘simple life’. Maybe this is what he has been yearning for ever since an angel walked into his life and told him he was part of an impending apocalypse.
“Tell me how to get to the Empty!” Dean yells. He’s already asked five times and the demon hasn’t budged. The answers are all the same: Dean is only human. Dean can’t do anything. Dean is useless.
“Relax,” Dean says calmly, with a mischievous smirk, as he sits up. “Eileen mentioned cataloguing and I can think of a thousand different things we should be doing instead.”
When he gets to his room, Miracle dutifully follows. As he leaps onto Dean’s bed, he brings the jacket with him. Dean’s breath catches as he looks down at the handprint, now draped carelessly over his leg. He can’t take his eyes off of it, the one he would recognise anywhere. The one he’s pretty sure is still branded on his soul.
Donna stands back from the devil’s trap she’s tried to throw together behind some broken down boxes but it’s not quite finished and now it’s just Dean and Castiel. The demon reaches forward to grab Dean, one hand around his neck and the other on Dean’s shoulder. The demon squeezes tight and Dean starts to feel lightheaded. He can hear Sam in the background, starting the exorcism with Donna, but all he can see is Castiel. He grips at Castiel’s arms just to hold onto anything.
“What are you talking about?” Dean is losing his patience and he can feel the anger building in his chest. He doesn’t want to blow up at Sam today. He doesn’t really want to ever do it but, god, not today. Not when they have a glimmer of something like hope ahead of them. “I think I remember burning his body, having a fucking funeral, Sam. I was there.”
“You didn’t have to be though,” Dean is nudging at something. He’s poking at a wound that Castiel isn’t sure has really healed. He’s ripping off the band-aid and tipping the antiseptic down the sink. Whatever measures Castiel has taken to avoid this are falling apart in this tiny cage Dean has trapped him in. “You’re not here like I’m here, Cas. Why didn’t you come back?”
“Hey,” Claire says quietly from her space beside him. The jacket is laying across one of the library tables, a small piece of the handprint cut out of it, and she can’t take her eyes off of it. “Is it really his blood?”
“But this time we had a deal. Whatever it thought it was getting from me in that deal, it wasn’t going to lose easily.” Castiel is sombre, but Dean has yet to see any signs of regret. Any hints that this probably wasn’t what he really wanted. “The Empty thrives on angelic and demonic energy. My body, vessel, personality, none of that was important. That was just personal.”
Castiel has a sunset glow shining on him, glinting in his hair, catching on his face, and Dean thinks,
“Dean,” he finally hears a voice behind him, his own, but slightly accented. “You shouldn’t be here.”
There is a body slumped on the floor across the warehouse that the demon abandoned when he saw Castiel, sensed his humanity. But it doesn’t matter.
“Okay,” Dean nods. “Yeah, okay. As excuses go that’s a pretty decent one. So, you won’t be around now? Gonna sit in the back office and do paperwork all day?”
Dean joins him in a heartbeat, scrambling to him while trying to catch his breath, reaching to grasp at his face, his shoulder, his arm… anywhere. Anywhere he can find a sign of life.
“Eileen!” Dean calls over as he puts his coffee down, giving a wave to get her attention. As she turns to look at him, Castiel presses a soft kiss into Dean’s temple. It’s new, and there is no ignoring the pang in Dean’s gut at how
“You’ll need that,” Sam says without looking at him, gesturing vaguely in the direction of the blade. “I don’t know how effective it is in the Empty but it’s better to go heavy-handed than not at all.”
Awake or asleep, they’re always there. He hears Castiel’s voice as clear as day and every time, conscious or unconscious, dreaming or deep sleeping, it squeezes around his chest like a vice. The tightness has yet to subside.
The Shadow gestures towards the younger, worn down and murderous version of Dean it is currently embodying. Dean pulls himself from the ground and shakes off the aching in his bones, the twinge in his knee from where he landed awkwardly. “Where is he?”
Dean feels like he’s lost a limb. He’s flailing around, trying to adjust, but he has no reason to believe he can. He’s lost so many, his mom, Jack, C… but any semblance of faith that he ever considered himself to have has also vanished.
playing like a stuck record. Every angry outburst, every torment, every time he made sure Castiel heard everything he didn’t really mean. As another spell fails to materialise anything, he can’t do anything but know that this is his ending. This is how he wins, doomed to live out his past mistakes and his current regrets. Just like the Empty. And it’s fucking awful.
“Sam,” Dean sighs. “I can’t explain it, I don’t want to explain it. I just need to try, and I’d like you to help me.”
"I'm very familiar with unrequited love, Dean," he smiles but he’s not amused. "Humans have been telling tales, singing songs, and making movies about it for centuries. I know I'm not your type."
Castiel says nothing, just spares a glance out of the window to the moon – low in the sky and shining across the water. He gently, finally, pulls the curtains closed because he doesn’t need an audience. He doesn’t need anything but a single minute, just a moment, to breathe. To let himself really feel what Dean is saying. To wish upon the grace he gave up that this is real and true.
“Could I?  Would you, Dean, knowing who you were then, would you have accepted my words, my confession under any other circumstance?”  Dean wants to immediately say yes, but it would taste like a lie, so he doesn’t.  He clears his throat and starts talking, hoping that somewhere in this word vomit he’ll find what he needs to say.
"Thanks, Cas."  There's something soft in Dean's voice that Cas is going to force himself to ignore.  Dean refills his water and sets it on the table while he washes the engine grime off his hands and lower arms.  Hoping to distract himself from Dean's flexing, Cas scrambles to gather sandwich ingredients and piles them on the counter.
“Yes, he’s been decent company.”  Cas is looking up at Sam, thankfully, so he doesn’t see Dean blush.
“I’m sure he did,” Dean chuckles, not moving from next to the car.  Sam turns back when he notices Dean isn’t following, head tilted slightly in a question.  “There’s uh, there’s something I didn’t tell you, about what Bobby said.”
“We’ll have more,” Cas hums, taking Dean by the chin and drawing him into a soft kiss.  Cas pulls away before Dean can dive deeper.
covered, with darker splotches on his forehead and his arm where it mingled with his own injuries.  He glances down and finally notices the huge red stain on his injured leg, and ok maybe he can see why Cas is so freaked out right now seeing as Dean looks like he got dunked upside down in a pool of blood.
The change isn’t instant, but gradually, like the warm liquid feeling that flowed into and through him, he feels almost the opposite.  It's like he’s pouring something into Dean from where his teeth have broken skin. And then he
“Sorry to disturb your beauty sleep,” Sam scoffs, “but I need you to come pick me up from work in an hour.”
They walk back into town for a quick goodbye, Dean stepping away to speak to Layla one more time while Jessica waits with Cas by their Jeep.
“Must be lonely.”  Dean’s scent shifts into pity, and Cas shakes his head.  He doesn’t want pity, especially not from Dean.
“It's my cousin’s home.  I've only lived here for a few years now.”  Cas downs the last of his tea before setting his mug in the sink.  “Let me make sure the bed is made." He leads Dean into the side hallway, pulling some pillows and blankets out of the linen closet.
He pulls on his jeans from the day before, grabbing a clean t-shirt and tugging a blue plaid flannel on over top, not even bothering to try and fix his sleep mussed hair before making his way out to the kitchen.  The coffee can isn’t on the counter, so Dean goes into the pantry.
“Well we’ll have to fight back,” Sam says, walking in the kitchen.  He smells like gunpowder and Cas immediately flashes back to the bunker. He suppressed his anxiety quick as he can, and he's thankful Sam has provided a distraction for Dean so he doesn't notice his mate's reaction.
Finally detention ends, and the kids scurry out of the room.  Jack seems to be expecting Dean to stop him on his way out, but when Dean lets him go, he makes the mistake of letting a brief moment of triumph show on his face.  Once the kids are gone, Dean shifts his attention to his computer, pulling up the email address listed for Jack’s parents.  The only one listed is for his father, so Dean selects it and starts to type up an email requesting a teacher parent conference.  He’d done taking this kid on alone, he needs to know what the hell is happening in his home life to make him so aggravating.
with him?  Jack's poor grade had hardly even registered, his mind too distracted by the man in front of him.  Even now he’s struggling to focus on Sam’s voice, because apparently he has a thing for bow legs… well, at least this set of them, anyway.  It was too bad Dean didn’t have much of an ass to speak of…
Dean smiles at him, soft and genuine. “Thanks, Cas.”  He squeezes past to walk down the hallway, brushing his arm on his way by, Cas' scent spiking with slight nerves.  Cas manages not to shiver at the touch, reminded again of the lack of scent coming off of Dean. The bathroom door closes, shaking him back into motion and Cas takes the linens to the bedroom.
“Just send me the video,” Castiel sighs.  He can hear her tapping away at her keyboard, and a new email pops up.  He opens the video, smirking at the cheesy logo and introduction. It’s a child’s drawing of the country, with lines in different colors all spreading from Central, and little pudgy cartoon people holding hands and smiling at the center.
The cabin is small, one large room making up the living room and kitchen, and two open doors, one leading to a bedroom, and the other to a bathroom.  The bathroom has a washer and hanging racks to dry clothes on, and the living room has a small fireplace. The kitchen is stocked with plenty of fresh food and a variety of juices. Overall the color palette is soft yellows and creams, feeling like summer, warmth and comfort. Cas is about to suggest they talk about the day when Dean crowds up behind him, wrapping his arms tight across his middle and burying his nose in Cas’ neck.
There’s no words, even with how much time has passed they don’t need them, they never have.  They take a moment together to appreciate that their struggle is over, and then after Sam sniffs back a few tears they climb back in the car and drive off.
“Well, to be honest, I sorta quit my most recent job.  Kinda why I wound up out here in the middle of nowhere.”
Cas turns his alarm off at 5:30 the next morning, rubbing the sleep out if his eyes as he stretches.  He dresses in his work clothes from the day before and heads downstairs for breakfast and coffee. The rooster starts to call out the morning right as Cas finishes eating a quick bowl of oatmeal.  The morning chores are much the same as the evening chores, with the addition of mucking out the horses’ stalls and a quick trip through the garden to check on the vegetables and do some watering. Another shower, another cup of coffee, and Cas is back in his office, ready to start another day of work.
“How about you, huh?” Dean shoots back, gasping as Cas lowers his head to suck a new bruise into his sternum.  “You ran off last week to take on that demon boy band,
“Gabriel, I am a full grown adult.” Cas ignores Gabe's snort of laughter, “and I've been on this farm with you for years now.  I can take care of it while you're gone.” He raises an eyebrow at Gabe over his coffee and Gabe sighs, running a hand through his long, golden brown hair.
“Alpha,” Dean answers with his own growl, commanding.  Cas leans forward, not hesitating as he flattens his tongue and drags it across Dean’s entrance. The taste of slick explodes across his nerve endings, their scents and endless feedback loop of
“Okay, Dean.  Our family.”  There’s a pause while the universe aligns itself or some shit where Dean is transfixed by Cas’ gaze, only this time when he wonders what it would be like to kiss him he’s no longer daydreaming.  Cas leans forward, and oh this is happening and Dean’s not prepared but Cas kisses him and he surges to his feet, Cas’ face in his hands as he kisses him back with years of built up frustration.  It’s messy and awkward but also hot and full of emotion and if Dean’s honest it’s the perfect analogy to the two of them.
He takes another breath, to make sure he isn't imagining things.  All he can smell is a slight overtone of leather and motor oil, both of which seem to have rubbed off from the car.
“Her dead wife,” Sam counters, “and like I said, we were both lonely.  Nice to know that as soon as I get to Heaven I get to be judged by you again.”  Sam’s reply is snarky, but there’s a little bit of a laugh in his tone.
“Holy shit, Cas.  How could she see that happen and not realize how bad you were hurting?” Dean spits.  “How could she make your brother take care of you?”
“What was that?” Dean's voice comes from the doorway, making Cas jump and turn to face him.  Dean is still wearing the t-shirt that smells like the car, but he's swapped his jeans for cotton pajamas.  He drops his small duffel bag on the floor by the door, glancing around the room.
“Congratulations, by the way,” she says with a smirk.  Cas blushes but grins, running his fingers over Dean’s bite.
“I didn't realize how much I needed that."  Cas surprises himself with the admission but doesn't back down from it.  “It's been awhile since I've had a good laugh. Or a reason to.” Dean finishes off his coffee, stands and starts clearing the table.
Cas is standoffish?  He goes to bite out a retort, then stops himself when he realizes Dean is right.  It's what comes naturally for Cas, shutting down around strangers. Dean is watching him over the rim of his coffee mug, green eyes patient.
“Sadly, I have to get home, otherwise I’d take you up on that offer.”  The man raises an eyebrow at Dean as he passed by on the way to the coffee pot. He was wearing scrubs and an ID badge and Dean’s brain starts to stumble over itself when he recognizes the tufts of dark hair and the blue eyes.
They spend a couple hours talking about logistics, a lot of stuff that goes right over Cas’ head, but that Layla and the other communities have prepared for.  Every counterpoint Dean brings up has a contingency, every flaw an escape clause. By the time they’re finished, Dean's scent is a lot more confident, powerful.  So much so it’s kind of distracting in the 'not for polite company' way, if Cas is honest.
There’s a promise in those words and Dean doesn’t know if he whimpers from his injuries or from the twitch in his pants but the next thing he knows Cas is
, and that’s the only reason he’s having trouble focusing.  It’s not that he’s picturing Dean in greasy jeans and a dirty t-shirt, bent over the hood of this particular car, sweaty and determined as his muscles bunch and-
“So why'd you quit your job?” he asks, hoping to divert the conversation into something else, anything else.  Dean’s eyes narrow a bit, but he accepts the change of subject.
Gathering up all the tests and everything he’ll need for the weekend, Dean decided to call it a day, stopping by the main office to check out and walking to his car to head home.
“What do you say about going on a trip today?”  Dean sounds a little nervous about asking, brushing his nose along the back of Cas’ neck.
“You deserved to hear those words at least once, too,” she says as she signs.  “You’re a good man, Dean, and Castiel may be gone but for a moment you made him
“Hey, can I get some help?”  It takes Cas an embarrassingly long time to realize the deep voice is talking to him.
“Okay, my shift is scheduled to end at 4:30 but if something comes up I might have to stay on a bit longer.  See you in a bit!” Sam is already talking to someone else as he hangs up the phone, and Dean digs his knuckles into his eyes.
I’m standing there staring down oblivion and Cas starts to smile.  God his face he-”  Dean takes another moment leaning hard against the prep table.  “He gives this speech, this whole thing, and it’s all about me.  Everything I hate about myself but he’s talking about these things like they’re beautiful things, about why I do what I do, and he, he says… he says that he learned to love the whole fucking world, because he loved me.”  Dean’s crying now, not bothering to try and hide it anymore.  “He said, he said that his ‘happiness wasn’t in having, it was in just being.’  The fuck am I supposed to do with that, huh?”
Cas watches as Gabriel grabs his bags, taking a deep breath to calm himself.  It wasn't good to let his irritation show to the point where his cousin’s weaker sense of smell could catch it. Just one of the many issues Cas faces in his life, keeping himself and his condition under control.
“From the Empty.”  The way Dean says it makes Sam’s stomach drop.  “See, apparently the Empty thought it was entitled to Jack’s soul or whatever because it gets to collect all the Angels who die, and it wanted to drag him off to the big old nothing.”
“No,” Dean snaps, pushing to his feet.  “No not this time, this time it’s different Sam.  This time he-”  Dean’s voice gets stuck in his throat, and he clears it, dropping his chin to his chest as he breathes through it.  “We were trapped, Sam, backed into a corner with no way out and that was it.  Death is pounding on the door,
“My White knight in shining armor coming to rescue me?”  Dean smirks, leaning in to brush his nose against Cas’ in a sweet and intimate gesture.  “Only when I was feeling particularly sappy.” Cas catches Dean’s lips, a quick kiss as
“No, I'm good, thank you.”  Dean smirks, a small, coy thing.  “You know,” he stands up and steps closer to Cas, “you’ve got nothing to be embarrassed about."  Dean winks. "You're quite the looker yourself, Cas.” The man’s voice dips, as his gaze takes an appreciative glance down Cas' body.  Cas feels his face burn and grabs the doorknob in a rush.
Dean tells Sam everything Bobby said, about how Heaven is different now, about how they can go see anyone they want whenever they want.  He brings up the whole time working different thing, even if he doesn’t understand it, and that makes Sam smile.
A click and more mumbled curses, followed by the creak of a door that needs some oil, and the sound of the hood opening.  It’s quiet for a moment, then Cas jumps when the hood closes with a definitive ‘shit’ from the man.
please, need it, want it.” Dean is repeating it over and over and Cas finally pulls his hand away, yelling in surprise as Dean flips around and manhandles him up against the head of the bed. Cas’ as yet neglected cock is so hard it’s standing straight up, and Dean doesn’t hesitate to crawl into Cas’ lap and drop down on it, impaling himself with a loud groan.
