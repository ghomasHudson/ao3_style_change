He ends that nonsensical reply with a shrug. There is so much he wants to say. There are so many words hidden inside of him. Locked up within his heart and I just wish he'd set some of them free a little more often.
He had stormed out of Mary's dorm-room and before he knew it he had found himself utterly and completely drunk in some bar or another.
And as Sherlock starts pulling him out of the room John looks at Mycroft one more time. Once again the older Holmes has a look on his face that he can't quite place.
John laughs too and his eager lips find Sherlock's once again. There is a little bit more urgency to their kiss this time. They have years to make up for after all.
And so he just sits in his room and when Mycroft calls him down for dinner he says he's not hungry and just sits on his bed until the room darkens around him.
Once again I catch his eye for just the briefest of moments and, once again, he looks away as if he's been stung.
“What I mean is”, John says, “look at you....off to Eton....seeing a whole new side of the word....learning all this stuff.....becoming the next Einstein.....and I'm just here....where I've always been.....it's just........”
It would have made so much more sense if all these prophecies that Sherlock has been trying to avoid all his life but somehow have been thrown in his lap irregardless had been given to Finn.
See if there is any news from Finn. If they have a plan to find out more about who exactly was behind the attack on Holmes....behind the magpie mark....behind any of this really.
“I like your hair like this”, John says. His voice nothing more than a soft whisper in the breath between them.
“I'm really sorry about this”, he says, “we can sit somewhere else if you want but I'm afraid they'll just follow us again if we do.”
John looks more handsome than he has ever been as the afternoon light that filters through the window makes his hair look like spun gold and accentuates his eyelashes as John demurely casts his eyes down.
John wasn't sure how to respond. His masters face was stern. He bore a haughty expression that John could not quite place as his eyes seemed to briefly change color.
Either this happens often and he's given this answer many, many times before or....these are rehearsed words. A lie he's been going over in the privacy of his own home to hide a truth he doesn't want anyone to see.
Slow kisses, soft kisses, tentative kisses, kisses full of wanting and lust and just a hint of fear.
The scene they've been reading through has nothing to do with parties. They've never had a conversation about parties before and he only half knows who “Eric” is.......he thinks Eric has brown curly hair and glasses....but that also might be Rob....or Dan....
John rubs the back of his neck. His shirt rides up slightly as he does so revealing a strip of tanned skin and a scattering of short golden hairs.
It is Friday evening 7pm. John is standing outside of the tool shed. The school and its surrounding areas are deserted at this time of day.
At this time of day it'll take the next bus in my direction a proper 20 minutes to get here so I make myself comfortable on the bench at the bus stop and prepare to just wait.
I could not imagine myself without you and, with a naivety very unbecoming of me, for a while, I thought that was how it always would be.
This would have gone slightly better had he remembered to actually add the ground coffee before he turned the machine on. It's been running on just water for the last couple of minutes.
“I was summoned.” Once again the answer is short and honest. John thinks to himself he should kiss Holmes more often if the effect it has on the man is this unguarded truthfulness.
A moment of silence between them. Their rooms are on the third floor. There is no simply climbing out the window and getting the key.
In the end they must head upstairs, go to their shared room and their shared bed, or run the risk of falling asleep at the table where they sit.
That woman must either be the least observant person on the face of the earth or she knows and simply does not care because John is just not good at pretending or lying.
“You know”, she says, “Greg's also been ignoring me since the party. I gave him my number and everything. Maybe that's just how rugby-boys are. Maybe they're just not worth our time.”
No longer is there a slight sheen of sweat on his skin but he now positively glistens. His hair is sticking out in every possible direction. There's sand in it. There's also sand and mud on his clothes and his shirt hangs slightly off of his left shoulder where a member of the opposing team has been pulling on it in an attempt to tackle John to the ground.
Mycroft chuckles. This sound he does remember. Thank the gods he still does. If he ever loses this he will kill himself after all.
'You don't need books', the alpha said, his voice now positively oozing, as he stepped closer, 'I can teach you a thing or two'.
He could feel himself starting to fall asleep, but right before he lost consciousness completely he managed to mumble out another: “thank you, Sherlock.”
“I know”, John replies, “I.....actually had a secret relationship with another man when I was in the army....I know what people can be like.”
But the fact that they will eventually fade away and that you know that they will, does not mean you cannot enjoy their vibrant colours, soft petals and sweet smell right now while you are still standing in the middle of the field and the sun is still high above you.
Seemingly endless monologues about owned land and politics during which John had usually just nodded and pretended to listen.
As evening starts to fall she is turning lights on and off as she goes. Sometimes she stays in the dark rooms just a little bit longer, sometimes she leaves immediately again.
'Please don't regret this later', Sherlock murmured into his mouth and then, all at once, the kiss deepened.
With Holmes here, rather unexpectedly and a lot sooner then he had even dared to hope for, his mind suddenly feels a lot clearer.
John, Shakespeare murdering-cannot act to save his life-John, is cast as Demetrius. One of the leads in the play. Helena's love interest.
Let's make it perfectly clear that he has no interest in Watson at all. Sees him as part of the interior.....if anything.
But the look on Sherlock's face is not one of amusement....it's one of contemplation....as if he's thinking something over.....and then...suddenly....he's even closer than he was before and John loses both his breath and his balance and the only thing keeping him upright are Sherlock's hands on his hips.
It seems that, no matter what time of day, a sleeping John Watson should always be shrouded in a heavenly light.
I nod again and quickly take another sip from my mug. It's not exactly a lie if it's partially true, right?
“Say no more”, he says, “I don't envy you. Is it Patrick? I always got that sort of vibe from Patrick......is that why you were at his party?”
“I need to go”, he says as he gets up, his hands on the table for support. His muscles are sore and there's an itch just underneath his skin he's never quite able to reach.
'Fairies are not good and kind, John', he said, 'I thought I was clever in striking a bargain with her, but instead she tricked me and now I'm here. Stuck. Forever.'
John laughs again. The sound is so lovely, care-free and honest....Sherlock wants to bathe himself in it.
The area inside the cave was small. The roof overhead so low that neither of them could stand up without hitting their heads. The floor was covered with soft moss and in one corner a small oil lamp stood that Sherlock lit as they entered.
Outside night falls and the clouds grow heavier still. The low rumble of an oncoming thunderstorm can be heard in the distance now.
She had been labeled “new money” by those who liked to speak ill of her. Not born into nobility, but married into it.
But before he was able to voice any of his thoughts to Sherlock his phone rang. A quick glance at the screen to see who it was made his blood run cold.
Just as he had done when he had been 8 years old and afraid he now decided that running away from his problems might be the best option.
John is looking at him questioningly and for the life of him Sherlock cannot piece together what he wants.
The dark cloud around him grows denser and denser and John is starting to have trouble making out the bent shape of master Holmes in the midst of it.
At the moment Sherlock finds himself once more on the small hill overlooking the orchards of Holmes Manor. Beyond the fruit trees the familiar shape of the building, now bathed in the warm light of the sun, can be seen.
'Sherlock?!' He said. His tone of voice was laced with anger, but his eyes were slightly red and there were traces of shed and unshed tears all over his face.
“I'm sure he'll come find you as soon as he can”, Greg says. His voice low and reassuring so only a small part of the table is able to overhear their conversation.
This is how I die, he thought and as the water slowly dripped from the nightstand to the ground he pulled the covers over his head.
“You need sleep. Come back to bed with me. You can continue this in the morning. Who knows, maybe the light of day will bring you new insights.”
He'd much rather have those kinds of physical reactions with John actually there. In actual physical form.
John's eyes are still closed. Sherlock lets out a breath he didn't know he was holding as he sinks his head back in the soft pillow beneath him and decides to  just stare at the ceiling for a while.
And we never said goodbye exactly but all the tiny ways in which he keeps showing me that we actually did hurt way more and....
With Holmes no longer holding him, with those magical eyes no longer trained on him and him alone........it is easy to think that none of it will last.
That's why he's chosen this strange movie in a theater right at the edges of society where they sell strange and dusty kitchen utensils and where he's almost certain he won't run into anyone who might recognize him by accident.
She gives a long suffering sigh as she stares at Greg a little longer before turning back towards the table and me.
A warmth had spread through his chest then and for a moment he had thought he was having a heart-attack.
'Oh, that's too bad', Mrs. Hudson said as she clasped her hands in front of her chest, 'you know, she's been sweet on you from the moment she saw you.'
'Really?', she said as she cocked her head and slowly placed her fork back on the table, 'how fortunate then are we to have you grace us with your presence tonight.'
'He's a dark sort of fellow. Not just in looks, but in the way he carries himself as well. I always feel there's something untrustworthy about him. Hidden just beneath the surface. He's hiding something. And when he looks at you...',she shuddered and this time turned her face to John again, 'as if he's trying to read all your secrets laid bare on your face. And succeeding. The things that man knows about you. It's unnatural. The things he's said to me.... I'm sure in another life he would have been a great pirate', she laughed again, a nervous edge to the sound this time. An effort to try and make light of the situation. Turn it into a joke.
John just feels embarrassed now. This is exactly what he was hoping to avoid. He really likes seeing this guy completely at ease and in his element. Making him uncomfortable is the last thing he'd want to do.
He had no plans of ending up here today but he had been coming down from an exceptionally good high when Mycroft's sleek black car had rolled up behind him.
Ever since he started working at this place he has been propositioned a couple of times, by both men and women, but never quite so directly.
“Is John Watson there?” he asks, keeping his voice low on purpose, hoping Bill won't recognize his voice and address him as John's cousin again.
To my right the window is cold but to my left John is warm as his leg slides against mine when the bus takes a sharp turn.
But so far she was still blissfully unaware. A smile formed on Johns lips as he gently kissed Sherlocks tip earning him a broken off groan and Sherlocks hand gripping his hair.
The classes go by in a bit of a blur but I'm sure it'll get better soon enough. I've never had too much trouble with learning and school-work.....yet another thing people seem to want to bully you about.
He had stopped being frightened by his father a long time ago. The only thing he felt now was anger in return.
Not knowing what to do he had ran. He had ran out the door, over the path through the orchards, through the fields and into the wooded area beyond. He had ran until he couldn't run anymore and his stockings were drenched through.
His horse was skittish and nervous underneath him. No doubt reacting to its masters strange mood and unfamiliar and hurried style of riding. Its nostrils flaring as the smell of omega in heat that came oozing from every pore of his body surrounded them both.
In the distance he could now see a small sliver of yellow light. It was emanating from a door he had left ajar on his last visit here.
She seems nice and full of questions but before she is able to ask any of them Sherlock has already managed to herd John inside and has closed the door behind them.
Sherlock just nods. He finds he has no words. Only an unexplained nervousness that grows stronger by the second. A faint tingling sensation is starting to make itself known in the tips of his fingers. It feels so real. It feels as if he is about to start a spell. As if his magic is being gathered. Living a life of its own. Warning him maybe?
For the first time since we started this strange and confusing conversation he takes his hands out of his pockets and rummages through his own backpack for an empty piece of paper and a pen.
“So let me get this straight”, he says, “both of you put yourselves in dangerous situations in order to look for something that might not even exist?...... I think that....maybe....both of you are chasing ghosts.”
I just don't know and I'm afraid that if I were to ask him, if I push him, I'll only end up pushing him away.
When he finally made his way to the kitchen later that day he learned that the fair haired gentleman had left quite suddenly before the ball had ended, leaving everything behind, even his horse. None of the household members seemed to know why. Now, in the light of day, after some sleep, John felt a small hint of satisfaction at this, but this feeling soon left him again when he learned that Master Holmes had also, quite unexpectedly, left during the night.
John just nods. There's sweat on his forehead and a ringing has now started in his ears. Slowly rising in pitch.
“I was....busy”, is what he ends up replying after a short pause that, perhaps, has lingered on just a little bit too long.
“Sherlock”, he says again, as if my name is something special. As if he likes the taste of it in his mouth and the feel of it on his tongue. He takes one of his hands out of his pocket as if he is going to touch me but he changes his mind at the last moment and puts it back inside instead.
“Listen, Sherlock.....”, John says, “seeing you like that and not being able to.......”, he bites his lip and I am mesmerized by the gesture as it leaves his mouth spit-slick and shining in the light of the street lamps, “I miss it.....spending time with you.....just you.....being close to you like that.....just....I really want to do that again.....and I was just wondering......if maybe.....you and I could.....you know.....some time.....if you want to.....that is.....”
At his back John is pressed up against him. This bed was not designed for two people but if they lay like this they can just make it work.
I am over him, I tell myself again and again and again as I walk to my next class and maybe God just really, really hates me because, as I round a corner I literally bump into a group of rugby guys.
The light filtering in through the windows now more orange than gold as the sun sinks beneath the horizon and sets the world aflame with its dying light.
The list of things that are weird and odd and stupid about him. The list he made up in the middle of the night when, once again, plagued by self-doubt, he couldn't sleep.
He will stand and step over the rubble that has formed around him to bring rot and decay to the lands beyond.
Seeing John like this, on the road to the peak of his potential, he is reminded of everything John has written to him in his emails over the last couple of years.
“...I should have never left you like that”, he continues, “and I came here to apologize and to let you know I was not of sound mind when I did that. I was under a spell that made me do things I would not normally do.”
“I just feel that going beyond the veil will bring you sadness”, she says, “it would be better if you waited here for the King to come to you....or at least until more answers reveal themselves.”
Mike had not changed a whole lot. They'd grown up together in the same small country town, but with Mike's father being a banker Mike had always been destined for bigger things. He was dressed up like a proper banker now. A proper wool suit. All the rage in London these days. His hat was in his hands and he was twisting it around nervously. Probably taken aback a bit by the state John was in. He hadn't been able to properly wash for days and new clothes were hard to come by.
It is Thursday once again and rugby practice has just ended. John is about to head out of the locker room door and head home. Even though he isn't spending his afternoons with Sherlock anymore he doesn't feel like hanging out with the rugby team either.
Sherlock is lying on his bed. He's still fully clothed, on his back on top of the covers staring at the ceiling.
Sherlock was standing next to John now as they both looked down at the cross. His arm around Johns waist. Holding him close as John leaned his head against his shoulder.
A couple of minutes later Andrew returns with a fresh bottle of beer. It tastes just as horrible as the first but I drink it anyway.
“Wait”, he says, Sherlock just looks at him, Greg looks as if he is having a hard time trying to figure out how he's going to say whatever it is that he wants to say. Sherlock gives him the time he needs. He finds it's pretty much all he has to give at the moment.
John still could not look him in the eyes. He looked at his feet instead. How his boots were hidden in the tall grass. His legs, their sun-bronzed skin framed by small white flowers that struggled to keep their heads up in between the tall grass. His skin had been darker the previous month. Being inside for 30 days, away from the sun, had paled his complexion ever so slightly. John didn't like it. His gaze reached the hem of his kilt. Its green and red pattern complementary to the colors found all around him.
John moans into the kiss and I swallow every sound he is still willing to give me with greedy lips and tongue.
He has come to the resolve that he will probably spend the entire day thinking of things he wants to do to Watson when they see each other again after the sun has gone down when suddenly something outside of the window catches Watson's eye.
He looked at the figure atop the white horse. He seemed exactly the same as the others, but......but what?
“We'll take this one and a gray suit in the same size and some riding gear for my....friend.....and I also need some new clothes myself.”
John didn't know why, but now that Sherlock was actually looking at him he felt rather nervous and so he rubbed the back of his neck and avoided Sherlock's gaze.
She can't see very far, the downpour that had started up that morning and hasn't stopped since obscures most of her vision.
His mind is foggy, his skin both too hot and too cold at the same time and he finds he still cannot breathe properly.
“I want to be special to you all of the time”, I say, “not just some of the time. Not just when it's convenient to you.”
The way the sunlight reflects off of his hair makes it appear like spun gold. It's nothing like the dulled down color of Miss Huntington's hair.
Once again Sherlock Holmes finds himself sharing a bed with John Watson. He is wide awake and extremely aware of his surroundings...and who he's sharing them with.
She knows what her reasoning for this is. Time is short and happiness is rare and fleeting. Especially when death follows you around with every step you take.
Just to his left he can see “Tall Dark and Handsome”. He's got his eyes closed and his head tilted back as his hips sway seductively to the music.
“He doesn't come up in any police databases.....doesn't have a record.....who is he?”, Mycroft asks.
Quickly he got to his feet. Scanning the field. But there was nothing there but the flowers and grass swaying slightly in the breeze and the sound of birds singing to announce the gradually approaching dusk.
During the day Watson goes about his numerous tedious chores around the house and gardens and Sherlock tries to keep busy as he waits rather impatiently for the night to arrive.
He looks strung tight. I'm afraid he will combust or just simply fly away at the barest hint of a touch from me.
Every second that slipped away was a second closer to the moment he had to leave for Eton and leave this newfound....whatever it was that he had found.....with John behind.
It does things to him....very pleasant things.....he almost doesn't catch what Sherlock is actually saying.
He wishes he could melt into the crowd and disappear but John is already jogging towards him. A smile on his face.
The woman with the dark braid gives him another look as they carefully walk past him and maybe she does see the words he wants to say. Maybe they have been written on his face all along.
But where the look John bore was one of concern, Sherlock just gave him a radiant smile as the light of the moon reflected in his eyes and placed stars in their depths.
“No”, she says, “but it spread like wildfire. I'm really sorry Sherlock. I know I haven't really been there for you as a friend lately but know that I am here for you now.”
There's something else he wants to do. Desperately so. He feels his life might depend on it. But only if Sherlock will let him.
Two chapters in one day? Yes! Because I had this one all thought out already and thought I might as well type it out.
On other occasions he would go at a more leisurely pace. Turning his horse this way and that. Trotting along slowly. Seeking the shade of the trees and hills to eventually make his way to Ettrick Water where he would doze on its banks surrounded by the smell of wildflowers as the sun warmed his limbs and the rushing of the river sang him to sleep.
“But....why? I'm sure there are lots of other gentlemen to be found here who would like to dance with her.....”
As he passes through the kitchen Mycroft is also there. Oh well, some tragedies can't be helped. Maybe if he ignores his brother he can get his bag packed and get out the door without having to say a single word to him.
'We did discuss the option', Johns mother said, 'but no. We felt since you have been suspended before you would not be learning anything from repeating that specific punishment.'
Holmes finally smiles back at him honestly and the room around them seems to fill itself with golden warmth.
What is this? This softness. This happiness. This feeling of things being incredibly uncomplicated......
But he is still young. Just a child. And he doesn't know yet how to voice complicated emotions like this and so, in the end, it all just comes out as more obstinate anger.
“Please don't. It's what brought you to me.......it's beautiful”, Sherlock says before bending down and placing a chaste kiss on the reason for John's uncertainty.
'The supernatural?', he had replied. So taken aback was he that he could not come up with any words of his own and simply mimicked the last Holmes had said like an echo.
John used to be able to read her like an open book....but now.....lately.....he wonders when and how things have changed so drastically between them.
'You tell me. You're always more up to speed with current affairs', Sherlock said as he shivered and poked at the fire with a stick, trying to breathe some life back into it. It was of no use. More and more embers silently fizzled out and were swallowed up by the dark of the icy December night that surrounded them. The circle of faint light Sherlock found himself in growing ever smaller and smaller. He found himself hunching forward slightly as the cold night air seemed to press on his back as a physical force.
She doesn't quite know what it is......maybe it's wishful thinking.....maybe it's the fact that his death will cause Sherlock so much grief that he will die soon after too. And losing Sherlock......Molly's own heart will not be able to handle that.
“But”, Mycroft continues. It seems even Sherlock's signature scowl can't stop him. Typical. They're both Holmes' after all. “you know you can always talk to me, right?”
A great ball of magical power traveling at lightning speed through the tethers still binding her to Holmes' mind.
Sometime during it, while he slept, Watson has rolled around on his stomach, exposing his back to the cool air of the bedroom and Sherlock's inquisitive gaze.
And now a comfortable silence had fallen over them as they sat side by side enjoying the warmth of the late afternoon sun. Their shoulders almost touching. Separated only by a hair's breadth and the semblance of decorum.
Sherlock wonders why he is suddenly contradicting his own earlier statement. Unless that wasn't about rehearsals....but he's not quite sure what else it could have been about.
He's also about 79.3% sure John was about to kiss him today. He's had to use some more complicated formulas on that hypothesis.
Maybe in time, with gentle persuasion, they might be able to convince Holmes to present Watson and.....whatever he was......to the Order, but not today.
At this point all that is left are shadows out of the corners of his eyes and whispers from the dark corners just behind him. Gone as soon as he turns his head and looks at them directly.
Sherlock sounds so sad and dejected again. John wishes he had a time-machine. Go back about 10 seconds in the past when it was still the both of them in their happy little world where John would never hurt Sherlock. It seems he has already broken that promise.
His hair sticking out at odd angles partly from tossing and turning in his sleep but also partially the result of Sherlock's own fingers raking a path through it while he helped John undress.
Like right now, for instance, his hair is a downright mess. Curls sticking out in impossible angles. He hasn't removed his eye-liner and it's starting to smudge. Sherlock looks like the very definition of chaos.
The shape of his long limbs is clearly outlined underneath the blankets now that he is the only person left to occupy the bed.
He didn't need to finish that sentence. The entire rugby team was well aware of the headmasters threats by now. If Johns grades did not improve he'd temporarily remove him from the team until they did.
To find Sherlock Holmes, The One, and learn what magic is and how to draw onto it, borrow it, and make it his own for just a little while.
“When she came out my mom got so mad..... she kicked her out of the house.... off to some strict boarding school. She hardly ever talks about her anymore. As if she doesn't exist..... as if she's not......I don't know.”
The fingers of his right hand that he just cannot seem to keep still where they lay on the table top.
The long snout shortened, but the wolf-head itself became larger, matching the size of the enormous body he now held, as the snarling wolf was transformed into a growling bear.
“Look at you now”, he says as his smile widens, “I'm proud of you. But I also miss you. Terribly so. And sometimes.....when I can't sleep.....and my mind is racing......I need you to put a halt to it......but you're not here anymore.....and I'm afraid I'm losing you.....John.......I'm afraid......I'll try calling you again tomorrow.”
I swing my feet over the side of the bed and for a moment the floor and ceiling seem to switch places only to right themselves again most violently.
When he turns his face away from the ceiling and back to John he finds his boyfriend looking at him with an open, honest, questioning look on his face.
He would have to ask later, because his heat was flaring up again most viscously and as his body burned with an intense craving all rational thought was pushed to the side. All he could do now was reach for Sherlock and hope he heard the unspoken words that lay behind the gesture.
His vision was starting to get blurry and although the sun was barely out, the light hurt his eyes and made him see stars.
Slowly John got up. It was hard to move when your limbs felt as if they were moving through water. He had heard enough. He felt like throwing up.
He looks so lost and small and alone and I want to wrap him up in my arms and take him far away from here. Go back to the beach, build a hut there and hide us both from the rest of the world. But I know the beach will not be as we left it and you can't run away from your problems forever.
I steal the words from his mouth with my own. I swallow them down whole and lock them up in the pit of my stomach with the rest of the things I never got to say.
“Oh.....you know.......just......”, Sherlock lets the sentence peter out. How is he even going to reply? He doesn't know what to say. He doesn't know what John wants him to say.
This time Mary does smile briefly at him, but her lips are tight and her eyes cold and unfeeling. John finds himself unable to look at her face for too long. There is something there....something hidden just underneath the mask that now always seems to be firmly in place and it's making his skin itch.
If the medallion won't work for Watson anymore then that means.....they can go back to Holmes manor and forget any of this ever happened. They can go back home and crawl into bed together after a long day of riding, he can wake up in Watson's strong arms as the first rays of light turn his blond hair into spun gold.
He poked wistfully at his plate as the shrill sound of their voices penetrated his ears as they talked amongst each other.
There were not a whole lot of household members for the size of the estate. Again, according to Mary, Holmes junior was mostly to blame for this. John just shrugged. He wasn't really interested in gossip. However much Mary liked it. There was Mrs. Hudson, who was head of the household and did a lot of the cooking. Two maids to help her in the kitchen, another handful of maids to help around the rooms and wait on Mrs. Holmes and her two daughters, Gregson and of course himself. So as far as young men were concerned John was pretty much on his own and the younger maids would tend to giggle when he was around and flirt unapologetically. John pretended not to notice. He'd had his fair share of women in the army. It had even earned him quite the reputation. But he was trying to put that part of his life behind him. He was here to make a fresh start. When he had been forced to leave the army more than his body had been wounded. His mind and soul had also taken some deep cuts. The loss of James still weighed on him heavily and the thought of letting love back into his life scared him more than we was willing to admit.
They've kissed so many times by now that Sherlock has lost count but somehow it's different this time.
My jeans and hands are dirty with sand, my face feels all swollen and puffy and my eyes gleam with the wetness of barely contained tears.
'Leave it, Finn.' Sherlock knew the attempt was pointless. Finn would most decidedly not leave the matter be.
About all the other boys in his group.....or team.....or class.....or whatever the correct army term is.
Even though their bond was no longer as strong as it once had been and they barely ever did anything together anymore Sherlock always missed his brother terribly when he was gone.
Perhaps sensing Sherlock's defenses to be unbreakable, he's probably had years of practice at his old school John realizes and his heart gives a small pang, Sebastian now turns his attention to John.
But now.....now he's about to work for 4 weeks on a vineyard in a small Italian town called Montaione.
His grasping hands finding skin wherever he places them. John's cheeks, his neck, the hollow just above his collarbone, the trail of hair that leads down from his chest to his abdomen, to his.....
Apparently Molly has overheard the last part of their conversation as she was making her way towards the door to leave.
The sky is streaked with purples and dark blues and a faint haze can be seen at the edge of the horizon as the cooling sky of oncoming night draws out the water that had been trapped in the earth during the day.
John had proven himself trustworthy. Keeping Sherlock's secrets even after he had told him perhaps more than he should have. Spurred on by John's bright smiles. Sherlock would do anything to have John's smiles directed at him so he could warm himself by the pure sunlight they produced.
His cheeks flushed. His hair already pleasantly mussed and his skin has a slight sheen all over. The team has most likely been busy warming up and he has already worked up a bit of a sweat.
“It's okay for a party”, I say, my mouth and brain have suddenly become separate entities. Neither of them knows what the other is doing and so I carry on talking: “but at school you just look ridiculous. It makes your mouth look.....too small.”
Looking down below his feet he could still only see darkness as the fabric between his tightly gripping hands made an awful tearing sound.....
Of course he could just tell Philip he wasn't coming, but by now Mary had told the entire school that he was. And with Johns popularity as the captain of the rugby team, if he were to not show up, he would have a group of very drunk disappointed party-goers at his door to retrieve him in no time. This had also happened before. His mother had grounded him for a solid month.
He tries to tap into that feeling again when he looks at her now but he finds there is very little of it left. It is as if he is looking at a different woman entirely.
Sherlock is writhing and moaning on his fingers as he twists and spreads them inside the warm safety of his body and John cannot possibly wait a second longer.
“Sherlock”, he says again. I still don't look at him, he buries his face against the side of my neck. His breathing is fast and shallow but comforting nonetheless.
The jacket is formfitting, showing of the muscles in his chest and shoulders and the shape of his waist, and the colour complements the blue of his eyes. He has never seen himself looking quite like this before.
Slowly John takes the hand momentarily tangled in his curls and gently he brings it back down again.
She hits the ground hard. The man is still holding on to her right arm and so she can only use her left one and her knees to catch herself.
Sherlock supposes it's just how Mycroft is able to survive. He doesn't really blame him. He just wishes he'd leave him alone right now.
He remembers John in the throes of orgasm and he feels his cheeks flush as a now slightly more familiar feeling makes itself known in his lower abdomen.
The fire-place is still covered in ash from a fire that has long since burned out and next to it John spots a plate with the remains of a half-eaten meal.
But before Sherlock even has time to think of a somewhat appropriate answer to that question John answers for him.
Drowning out the dueling sirens calls that are trying to either call him back to shore or drown him for good in the tumultuous waters of the open sea.
Next chapter: the reunion. Finally. I've found not having Holmes and Watson together slightly less fun to write.
'When will she stop waking us up?' Sherlock's breath was a warm presence at the top of his spine and, even though the rest of him was still half asleep, John felt his cock stir as the alpha pressed himself even closer to him.
It had been like being in the middle of a hurricane. At the eye of the storm everything was calm while wonderful and curious sights whirled around you.
And so he'll stay in his costume just a little bit longer. He'll not remove all of his stage make-up just yet and he'll go home. Alone.
The light of the screen is too bright for my itching eyes and so I squint as I scroll through the app that handles my messages.
Holmes answers him with a smile of his own and, once again, John can't help but notice what a good look it is on him.
Maybe the night is playing tricks on his sanity. This night in particular. It's been a very strange night so far.
I'd seen it hidden beneath the tightness of his lips. Their seam a barrier to keep certain words from spilling out. Words that had come so easily to him when it had just been the two of us and the rushing of the waves and the private light of a setting sun.
Finn sighs as the paved street underneath his feet makes way for a gravel path, then a dirt road and then just grassy hills.
“I'm sorry, John”, Sherlock finally says. Because he truly is. Why do things always become so complicated? Why can't he find the words to say what he wants to say?
Once again he tried to remember what had happened but his memories were hazy and all out of order. Memories overlapped and interwove creating a cacophony of sights and sounds that stung his ears and eyes.
His dream had been nothing like his usual nightmares. For a change it had been rather pleasant.....serene......
John breathed in deeply again, held his breath for a couple of second and then let the held air flow out again in one big rush taking some of his worries with it.
At 9:30pm I scour the internet again for horrific news stories. This time I also include violent muggings and house-fires but still nothing comes up.
They are sitting at a table in the small coffee-place down the road. There are not many people in at the moment so they pretty much have the back of the place to themselves. Molly, John and Sherlock.
Holmes sounded tense. Like a nerve ready to snap. Also the use of his given name was new. John quite liked it, but not the way in which it was said.
John had definitely had enough. He'd been in trouble for fighting a couple of times at his previous school. Right after his father had died. His mother had given him hell for it. She had dragged him to numerous therapists. Convinced that there was something wrong with him. Something that needed fixing.
We've just sort of been coexisting these last few years. Both adrift with our own grief while gradually getting further and further away from each other.
'Mycroft I'm boooooored!' he had drawled in that special way that all small children seem to have mastered and he had flung himself across Mycroft's desk. His face almost smashing into the carefully splayed out maps, but Mycroft had been quicker as he pulled the maps from the desk surface, folded them neatly and locked them into one of the desks many drawers with the small key he always wore around his neck.
Sherlock pours himself a cup of tea to go with his toast. Maybe if he just ignores her this whole ordeal will be over sooner.
wasn't there? But why? He knows there's an obvious answer here. It seems obvious to Greg at least because he's giving him a knowing smile but he just can't quite get his finger on it himself.
There's a twinkle in Holmes eyes as the corners of his mouth curve up in a smile that makes him look boyish and incredibly young. Once again John feels the palms of his hands go clammy and he decides to shove them in his pockets anyway.
Ever since he had found out, secretly using Mycroft's computer and government access, where John works.
He had crossed his arms and had given his brother the best glower he had possessed at that age from underneath his unruly curls and messy fringe.
His bedroom is still exactly the same as when he left it. Mycroft has cleaned it. It's pretty much dust free. But that's pretty much all he's done in here.
Without the warm shape of Watson's body pressed against his back, his arm draped nonchalantly over his hip he feels as if his companion has taken all the warmth out of the room and has carried it down the stairs with him.
'What the hell do you think you are doing?' Holmes baritone boomed and it seemed as if the entire building rattled and shook with the sound of his voice.
Once again he's avoiding looking at John and John realizes he probably still doesn't know where he stands with John. Where they stand. He has to tell Sherlock. Needs to tell him. Needs to figure out how....
“I tell you every time we talk”, it feels as if the low husky sound of John's voice is no longer in his ear but right in his brain and his chest and Sherlock closes his eyes and lets it sink in  as John continues: “if I could get to you I'd walk.”
He wants to touch him, hold him, drown in him and forget as he has done on many, many nights before.
There are now so many tears in his eyes that he is unable to see anything anymore. He's afraid that John might have left again but then there are soft hands on his face wiping at the liquid running down and a soft voice close to his ear.
He leans himself forward and kisses me again and once again my hands find him because, now that he's so close, I can't stop touching him.
He is sitting on the floor in the corner of one of the mansion's big rooms with his knees drawn up towards his chest and the remnants of a failed disappearance spell crackling in the air around him.
I turn back to the class and make my way to the only empty seat available. I assume the skinny boy with greasy hair that frames his face in uneven strands seated next to it is Phillip.
“Oh.” Sherlock's reply. He is looking down at his ratty t-shirt and bare feet self-consciously. He runs his hands through his hair nervously, trying to tame it just a little bit.
John's on his fourth pint but he still can't quite shake the feeling of dread and unease that has clung to him like a coat ever since he left Mary behind.
All of a sudden he feels the cold sting of jealousy again. A small, dark part of his heart wishes John would put this much effort into courting him and not Molly....
A lot of the time he finds himself so full of doubt and insecurities. About who he is and what he wants and what others might think of him....but never when it comes to John. Once again, that might be John rubbing off on him. His light illuminating the world until it makes sense and making everything that Sherlock is better.
“Shut up, freak!”, he shouts. Sherlock seems to remain unfazed by the pure rage that Sebastian now spews towards him. “This is exactly why you don't have any friends.”
Seeing him like this quickly made an end to the warm glow that had been spreading through Johns body and a sudden and cold fear was quickly taking its place. Having said what he had set out to say Holmes was evidently getting ready to leave and John couldn't let him. Not before he had had a chance to say what he had been wanting to say for the last three weeks. Not before he had had a chance to unload the weight that had been weighing down his heart and had made him worry about Holmes' absence so.
The lanterns on the walls had thrown strange shadows on his face. Making the sharp features, that Sherlock had also inherited and would grow into once his face lost its boyish roundness, appear like the sunken bones of a skull.
“In a good way”, John continues, “your hair is as bit longer, you're taller, you're more proportional than you used to be.....when we were young.”
'Talk? About what?', John had felt confused and very uneasy at her words, but Mary had started walking back towards the house in a brisk pace and instead of an answer she had just said: 'come on John! We'll be late!'
John sits down next to him. Close but not too close. He can feel the warmth that's coming off of John's body but their legs and arms are not touching.
“She studies birds”, I clarify, “more specifically the migratory patterns of birds. Wherever the birds go, we go.”
And when John raises his glass to show Holmes that he has, indeed, finished it already, he finds his glass somehow full again.
At 9pm I get so desperate that I actually decide to call him. He doesn't answer. The phone just rings until it goes to voice-mail and at that point I don't really know what I wanted to say anyway so I just hang up.
“See, you're getting mighty interested now”, Finn is no longer laughing but a smile still lingers on his lips.
He'd go down to the stables to see if he can give the stable-boy a hand but he's afraid that if he does leave the room Holmes will lock the door and not let him back in again.
“It's because you're so good”, he says. Which Sherlock finds a somewhat strange way of reasoning. If he's so good then why would he still need to practice? Would it not make more sense if John did most of the reading.
'…...being pregnant at your age, with your alpha not even around. People will talk. My good name will be tarnished beyond repair. No other alpha will have you like this.'
At first he thought it was white, then some kind of gray colour....or silver......maybe just a combination of all three.
“Oh....shit.....no.....I mean......that's what the rugby team calls her. She used to hang around while we practiced a lot......I mean
She squints her eyes at me and bites her lip. I notice she's still not wearing lipstick. She looks back at the rugby-table again and then at me.
Knee high grass waved at him invitingly in a soft breeze and flowers in every color imaginable were dotted across the landscape in mesmerizing patterns.
Sherlock is the first to recover. He just rolls his eyes in that very Sherlock way that John has come to know so well, turns his head to Sebastian and says:
He wants to say John's name again but this time all that comes out is a sob. His chest hurts. His heart hurts. His lungs feel as if there are shards of glass stuck in them. He fights for breath as his legs feel as if they're slowly turning to liquid.
He asks the stable-boy if he's seen which direction Holmes has taken but the boy, at his query, is genuinely surprised the black horse is missing.
“No!”, John feels almost insulted now, “we had had that argument about you leaving acids in the fridge right next to the milk and so I went out to the pub and had a drink. She was there and started buying me drinks and I ended up getting pretty drunk and then all of a sudden she was right there....in my face.....her lips on mine....and....somehow....I kind of felt like I......owed her.....something......it felt rude to push her away.....and so I just.....let her.....I'm a horrible boyfriend.”
Finn turns his face towards the still dark sky overhead as he makes his way through the streets of the small town.
He gives me another too soft kiss as his hands tighten around me for a moment but then he pulls back again.
Mycroft never comes to meet him the following month and when he goes to look for him all traces of him  are gone.
He will see me many more times after that. In his dreams. I will try and speak to him. Tell him what will come. Remind him of the mission I have given him.
“We are never wrong”, the voice interrupts him and this time one of the figures does turn its head but it doesn't appear to be the same one that has been speaking, “three nights ago we felt it. It could have been nothing else. A power so great...so splendid.....and we saw you with it. You must know where it is and you must bring it to us.”
Sherlock had spelled the word out for John and John had repeated after him. He had not mocked Sherlock. Had not made fun of him. He had just been honestly impressed.
He put on a devilish smile of his own as his muscles tensed and his hands seemed to turn into fists all on their own. John Watson might have been in many fights, but he had won every single one of them.
Holmes now joins him where he stands next to the house. He takes the bracelet in his own hands and turns it over and over. There's a smile on his face now. The moon reflects off of his raven curls as if it was sunlight. The moon is unusually bright tonight.
'Anything I can help you with, sir?'  there was a bit more bite to the word “sir” than he had intended there to be, but John found he didn't really care.
After an argument his father always kept an extremely close eye on him. There was no escaping the castle today. His father was already angry and if he caught him sneaking out now he would do far worse than just shove him.
What he actually got was a tall, slim, but still well built young man wearing very well fitting and seemingly expensive clothes. His nose and cheekbones were somewhat sharp, but they were well balanced out by the soft, plump cupids bow of his lips. John tried very hard not to stare at them. On his head was a mop of raven-black unruly curls and just underneath a piercing icy gaze. Currently fixed on John as Sherlock held himself with a cold authoritarian air.
He wonders whether Holmes will dare to make the journey back to the mansion on horseback or just spend the night at the estate of Lord Wallace.
Sherlock has been waiting in the dark in this hotel room for over an hour and John has not shown up.
After all, if he still needs Sherlock there to work up the courage to sit close to Molly then looking at her is probably a step too far.
And so he starts moving. Gives it his all but he still feels utterly ridiculous. He knows there's a beat and rhythm to this song but his clumsy limbs can't seem to find it.
As Mycroft's fingers make contact it suddenly lights up like a firefly, makes a soft popping noise and then disappears.
Best to let John know some of his worst character traits and if he then still decides to hang out with Sherlock.....well....that'll just be
Hitching a ride with Greg beats having to walk. Or take a bus. The downside will be that Greg will probably continue talking to him, asking him questions, probing for anything he can then later pass on to Mycroft.
He had been busy pruning and reshaping trees all day long and this had involved a lot of climbing up and down ladders.
There's a large blanket that he unfolds and lays down. He's got some bottles of water and a pack of oreo's.
He probably should have had his fill of alcohol this evening but the sound of Holmes laughing only makes him crave more.
Miss Hooper glances to the side where her aunt is dancing. The look on her face once again tense. “I'm afraid we don't have much time”, she says.
It's what keeps her going when she's having a particularly tough day. That there is an end to all of this....or.....a point....a reason....something....anything.....nothing.
There was a full moon in the sky. Every now and then wispy clouds slowly slid in front of it like ghost-ships made out of fog traversing the inky black of the night sky.
He puts his cup of tea down on a table in front of him and tries to get more comfortable on the monstrous sofa. It's not really working. He feels as if the upholstery is trying to swallow him alive.
Finn's words snap Sherlock out of his thoughts of coming up with every possible way to dispose of a ghastly shirt and back to the matter at hand.
He had worked from dusk till dawn that day. Only taking small breaks here and there when he felt close to passing out.
Why should John being ashamed of being gay make me feel ashamed of being gay in return while I had never really been before.
'Ah!', said the strange man, the smile never leaving his face 'you must be John Watson. I was not expecting you to be so.......'
There was just something about Sherlock that he found utterly fascinating. If you took all of Sherlock's features separately: the strange cupids bow of his mouth, the sharp angle of his nose, his somewhat long face, his high and sharp cheekbones, his black curls that had only been a wild mess the first time they met, Sherlock had taken to styling his hair ever since.... separately none of it sounded like it worked, but all put together it resulted in something John had a hard time looking away from.
But misfortune seemed to cling to his heels as James had died and he himself was irreparably damaged.
“You've been visiting an awful lot of different hotel rooms”, he says, “what were you doing in them?”
In a daze John made to follow her, but he was stopped in his tracks by Sherlock grabbing his arm. Ah, good, maybe he had a quick way to get them out of this mess.
For a moment Sherlock goes rigid. All his muscles tensing up. John fears he has misjudged after all....but then......
It's raining heavily in London tonight and the sound of fat drops falling penetrates the otherwise tranquil interior of the bedroom.
So, in the end, they had decided to remain underneath the leaves of the tree instead of running home and risking getting soaked all the way through with the icy water pouring from the sky.
He gives me one more look I can't decipher and for a moment I think his eyes flit to my mouth and lips and then he is gone.
I'm about ten minutes in to Stephen Fry delivering detective stories to my ears when I notice someone else sitting down on the bench beside me.
Sherlock just wishes his brother would leave him alone. Wouldn't pry so much. He has half a mind of not answering. But not answering will only turn it into more of a mystery and there is nothing Mycroft likes more than a Mystery. He'll never leave him be then....
I don't see John immediately but I finally do spot him. He's standing a bit off to the side and he's talking to one of the theater's employees. A young girl, about our age, with long ginger hair that she keeps flipping over her shoulders.
By now the main rush seemed to be over as most of the guests had found their way to the house and John found himself blissfully alone once again. He had made sure all the horses were brushed down and properly fed and watered. Ready for the ride back later that evening or for some even the next morning as some of the guests were staying the night at Holmes manor. He had half a mind to climb up the ladder to his small room where the cold wintry draft wasn't as pronounced as it was on the main floor when suddenly the stable doors swung open again.
A small smile now briefly forms around the stranger's lips and....hot damn....if the sight of it doesn't do strange things to John's insides.
Holmes, however, seems to be sure enough for the both of them. Having stripped down to his undergarments he slides himself underneath the covers, turns on his side and heaves a contented sigh as he closes his eyes.
“The Order”, Holmes replies. The answer short, direct and honest. Somehow John had still expected him to be evasive and defensive. He's glad he isn't. He's glad things still seem to be easy between them.
For a moment Sherlock wonders if John is the one who knows magical spells and not him but then all coherent thought leaves him as John's lips make contact with the hollow at the bottom of his throat where his collar now lies splayed open.
Updates have been few and far between and at the moment that has mostly been a problem with poor planning on my part and my job that is keeping me way too busy.
Kind of the downside of not really having a lot of friends at school. I can't really go up to anyone and ask them. So I make due with the snippets I catch here and there and wait impatiently for lunch-break to arrive so I can ask Molly.
If he were to throw up on John twice in a row he'd probably have to change his name and move to a different country.
Not after what I'd seen yesterday. He will not want to listen and I will only end up getting rejected again.
Because of his talent at sports he does have to devote a lot of his time and effort to rugby training and so he has little time for his other classes.....and it shows.
But still...last time he had to make a decision similar to this he had chosen the threat of his father over that of the fairies and look how that had worked out for him.
'For the record', John replied, still a tense edge to his tone of voice. He would not be cowed into submission, 'I have not spoken to anyone about last night, nor was I planning to do so. Your secrets are your own. Just as mine are mine. Sir'.
“At least I wouldn't have to warm you up every time you got back in bed if you quit smoking”, John says. But he only halfway means it. He loves these moments. These times where it's just them and the rest of the world does not seem to exist. He loves gently and carefully rubbing warmth and life back into every part of his lovers skin. His fingers are already absentmindedly twisting themselves around the curls at the back of Sherlock's neck as Sherlock's lips find his own.
John cleared his throat. Even after thinking it over in his head for the last couple of days he still wasn't too sure about how he wanted to broach the subject. But he knew he had to. The tension between him and Mary had been steadily rising and by now it had become an almost visible force. He watched Mary's fingers as they stretched out the dough then pushed it back together only to stretch it out again. It was hypnotizing.
Thankfully Mycroft hasn't tried to talk to him again. He's just been sitting across from Sherlock giving him strange looks and on occasion looking at the terminal around them as if he's searching for something.
He turns around to the sound of Mary's voice. The sun is in his eyes as he looks at her so he can't quite make out what expression she bears on her face.
His hair is neatly curled for once. Not the wild array John has gotten used to. He wears a dark blue form fitted jacket with golden buttons, a white silk undershirt with a silk necktie and dark blue high-waisted trousers that have been tailored so precisely to Holmes' shape that they almost seem like a second skin on his long and slender legs.
“Ehm....”, he starts, only to stop again when the head of the household raises her eyebrows questioningly.
Mycroft lets out another heavy sigh and Sherlock feels another small surge of victory but the taste of it isn't sweet at all. It's bitter and raw and.....just slightly wrong.
However much he racked his brain he couldn't think of anything he had said or done that would make John act the way he did today.
Right now Sherlock and his soldier are sitting together on an elaborate flowery sofa in the drawing room.
Patrick is frowning at John now. If he keeps this habit up he'll get wrinkles in his forehead before he's reached thirty.
Fear that, one day, one of Mycroft's elegant feet might slip or his grip might be just a little bit too loose.......he fears Mycroft will get hurt.....or.......
The spell looks like a small cloud made out of gas and fireflies. John's not entirely sure what it's for. Holmes explanation had been a bit too hasty and, to be completely honest, John's mind had still been a bit dulled down by post-orgasmic haze.
'Indeed', was all Sherlock said. He leaned back in his chair and sipped on his wine. The food did not seem to be agreeing with him at all tonight. This was usually the case when he'd been away for too long.
“And then we'll be back to saving the world”, John laughs as he says it but there is a nervous edge to the sound. His words are only a joke in part. The serious edge underneath makes Sherlock uncomfortable and he is suddenly very aware again of the wind and rain howling in the night just outside the thin walls that separate them from the rest of the world.
Sherlock is perfect and brilliant and gorgeous..... who cares if he's a guy.....if they're both guys.....talking to his parents had been a mistake.
And although the body laid bare beneath him is new and exciting and he is still discovering all the different ways that make Holmes tremble and moan as his eyelashes flutter it somehow also feels as if he's done this before.
“The King is old”, she says, “one of the great demons. The magpie is his messenger. He uses it to see into the world beyond the veil while he is still trapped there. You should stay as far away from him as you can, Sherlock. Wherever he goes death and despair follow.”
The man was like one of those ancient statues. Nothing but perfect lines and curves. Not an inch of fat on him and muscles only where it mattered. The effect only enhanced by the pale, almost marble-like complexion of his skin.
'Isn't everybody beautiful', Mary said. Her voice barely a whisper in the dark, but with her pressed so close to him there was no need for anything louder.
He currently found himself in bed bathing in sweat with a throat that felt like it was lined with razorblades, a cough that sounded as if he had swallowed a goose that was desperately trying to get out again and a fever so high he could probably cook eggs on his forehead.
“I really love seeing you”, he says, “you have to know that....you.....you're......not like anyone I've ever met....this......I don't want it to be a one time thing.....you know......I just.....”
With the hour being so late the fire had started to burn out but before John had been able to get up and get some new wood to get it going again Finn had waved his hand in the air and the flames had roared back to life.
Apparently he hadn't even noticed John had been absent for the last ten or fifteen minutes while he escorted Kitty back to her room.
But Sherlock's brother is still giving him that creepy vampiric smile. And he's also quite a bit taller than John....and older....and he's probably John's only way of actually getting to Sherlock at the moment. So, in the end, he just nods.
'I'm not allowed to smile?' John sat down at the table on the chair opposite from Sherlock. His smile only faltering slightly.
Behind the lion's right ear John could see that her white horse had reached the trees and was moving between them inexorably.
John takes another hesitant look at the clock behind him. There's still a little under 3 hours left to his shift. He can't just leave and......well.....on the other hand.....Becca is still here.....somewhere.....and he is more than a little intrigued as to where detective Lestrade is planning to take him.
out of the relationship. Who broke up with Sherlock and to this day had enough power over him to make him look sad and small.
The conversation was silly, but they both found themselves giggling and John silently patted himself on the back for coming up with the idea to take Sherlock here. This was the first time he'd seen Sherlock this loose, carefree and....happy. It was intoxicating and he found he wanted more of it.
In the crowded hallways between classes I check for a head of golden hair, a dimpled smile, strong shoulders and a confident stride....but I don't see him.
They're having far too good of a time for the circumstances they find themselves in but Sherlock finds he doesn't care one bit.
Sherlock remembers one summer evening where they had gone out at night to catch fireflies. Sherlock had been twelve then and John fourteen. Nothing had changed between them yet.....not yet anyway.
The parts of John's life that do and do not contain Sherlock in it should be kept separate at all times.
The room behind the door is dark. It's shaped like a pyramid with a ceiling that slopes. Its highest point a dot lost somewhere between the clouds of incense that drift upwards and make his eyes sting. There are only a couple of windows but they are all up near the top of the sloped walls and so he can't look out of them and very little light filters in.
'Of course, of course!', and this time Sherlock did touch John. The contact of fingers against his upper arm only barely there, but to John it felt as if he was set on fire as a warmth blazed through his chest.
Especially now that they have decided on pretending to be equals.....pretending John is a lord as well.....
The gorgeous stranger has one arm in the air and he's moving it down slowly and gracefully as the music swells to a crescendo.
John marveled at the expanse of pale, flawless skin suddenly laid bare before him. Sherlock's muscles visible underneath as tight cords. A hidden strength that was both beautiful and slightly intimidating at the same time.
'Is it now?' John replied playfully before he could stop himself. Mary had been flirting viciously with him this afternoon and some of her behavior seemed to have rubbed off on him.
Sherlock feels himself panic even more. Of course John has noticed. John probably hates it. Of course he hates it. Silently he curses his stupid cheekbones and too small eyes as he looks down at the table where his empty Snickers wrapper still lies and tells himself that, next time he has an “idea”, he probably shouldn't listen to himself.
With Sherlock standing in front of him he felt as if he was inside of a dream once again. Only this time it was one he did not wish to wake up from.
I want to say something to him but there is nothing left inside of me. He has quite expertly emptied me out.
It's becoming clear to him that it doesn't matter how he sees himself. It matters how John sees him. And from what he's hearing now, even when he's not around, he's still able to make John happy.
After a moment of silence where Finn just returned John's gaze, liquid fire once again swimming through his irises, he seemed to have have reached a conclusion.
'Because when you get hurt....again, it would be nice to not have to drag your arse 20 miles to the nearest doctor.'
John lies on his back with his eyes closed and his bare chest rises and falls slowly and rhythmically underneath my hand. The motion reminds me of waves rolling onto the shore and the coming and going of the tides.
Once your crimes are beyond redemption the East Wind will swoop down and pluck the unrighteous from the earth. To carry them away. Never to be seen again.
The man laughs. It's a low gurgling sound that makes John think of men dying on the battle-field. Gasping and fighting for just one more breath.
His fingers were entwined with Sherlock's once more and, just like the last time, John could not remember when they had reached for each other.
To him all of these wondrous feats are synonymous to spending hours and hours pouring over some old book. Trying to memorize the inner workings of a seemingly ordinary spell. Having it fall just outside of his grasp time and time again. His father's condescending gaze as he fails him yet again.....
And so at seventeen Sherlock moves back to England. To Eton. To study and make something of himself and not think of John.
And so he usually makes sure he arrives late to avoid pre-class socializing and he always makes sure he's on the opposite end of the room from wherever John is during the class itself.
“What was his name”, once again the low baritone of Holmes' voice pulls him from his own thoughts and back to the waking world around him.
“I just thought”, John says again, “that it would be nice to have something of.....us.......here.....forever......”
John can't say he blames them. There is a part of him that feels the same. As if time is of the utmost essence.....as if....
“So”, he says, “Sherlock.....”, his tone of voice is different from what it has been through their conversation up until now. There's a slightly uncertain tone to it. The pitch just a little bit too high and a tremor on the pronunciation of Sherlock's name.
“I think....perhaps....we both had a little bit too much to drink”, Holmes had said then, “it's making it hard for me to think.”
“I don't know if I'll get clean once they release me from the hospital. I've tried before. It's never worked.”
Holmes lets out a long sigh and inside of it John can see swirling patterns of light as the  magic leaves his body and fills the air around them.
“I was just wondering”, John says, still not looking Sherlock in the eye, “since you're so good at this Shakespeare stuff......whether you'd like to run lines together.....once we get our actual parts.......after class......tomorrow....if you want to....... that is.”
Mycroft is just standing far way enough for Sherlock to not be able to overhear the conversation and find out who he is talking to. He contemplates moving a bit closer but that would make it too obvious.
This time around he hasn't caught a single word of what the young lady keeping him company has been saying.
'Oh, come on, Johnny. It'll be fun! I'll be there',  Mary's hand was on his arm now as she leaned over the table and as John looked up at her her chest was right in front of his face. She was wearing an extremely low cut top. Bent over the table like this not a whole lot was left to the imagination. John swallowed.
