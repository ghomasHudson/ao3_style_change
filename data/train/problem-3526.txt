He never imagined he could find himself in this situation now. He'd never imagined he could survive. He'd never imagined he'd have to deal with the consequences of his confession.
But his expression was blank.
"I don't."
of it-
It's enough to rip Dean out of his haze, make him disentangle himself from those arms still holding onto him. When he looks at Cas, his blue eyes are warm and
"Thank you, Dean."
you to go", he corrects himself, "because I never actually wanted you to. Not ever. I could never want you gone, Cas."
Cas bit his bottom lip, unable to hide the little grin that was spreading on his face.
"What?"
"No", Dean lies too hurriedly. He doesn't have to ask what Cas means. "I dunno. It was just that I...I want you to feel at home here, Cas." He doesn't just want Cas to be here. He wants Cas to
He couldn't stop.
"It would have been a great comfort for me to know that you're not acting against your wishes just because you want to help me."
Dean's movements were beginning to lose control, his hand flying, hips bucking up. But his eyes were fixed on Cas, asking, begging for something, anything that would push him that last step to finally tumble over the edge.
He doesn't want Cas like that. He shouldn't want Cas like that. He
Dean pulls him down into another kiss, sweet and full of those future promises.
He shouldn't be the one that needed soothing now, Cas shouldn't have to comfort or explain or- wait. What was that?
Cas was still scared to explore new aspects of this relationship they had developed, he still fought with dreams and flashbacks, but he still discovered that he was looking more and more forward to the time dedicated to their practicing every day. He trusted Dean, he really did, and taking each new step turned out to be as exciting as it was terrifying. After all, he had quickly discovered that the only thing worse than being touched by anyone was
Does he mean it? Is Dean even aware what he's saying with this? Does he have any idea what that word encompasses?
Cas hated it. He hated this. He hated the sudden emptiness in Dean's eyes, the hardness to his jaw, the tension in his shoulders.
What if Cas decided he didn't need them anymore? What if he decided he didn't need
Needless to say Dean likes Cas in his clothes. More needless to say Dean likes it a little
~oOo~
- but Cas would take what he could get) and he would never tire of using such moments to shower him with as many gentle, loving touches as he can.
"You're holding back again", Cas said, soft but with a hint of reproach. "I can feel that you are."
Cas gives him
"I'm really not", he heard the small, mumbled words, making Dean's heart clench painfully.
"Fair."
Oh, right. He'd almost forgotten.
, it echoes in Dean's ears,
And the Downton Abbey reference ofc...you're welcome, Charlie xD
~oOo~
gonna need coffee for this", is what he presses out with an uncomfortable wave of his hand, pushing up from his seat as fast as possible.
"Yes, Dean." And it sounded sure this time, causing Dean to smile as Cas leaned down and kissed him. "Of course. Anything you want, my love."
But he also knew that he couldn't have done anything differently. At the end of the day, he'd always go with Dean, always return to him, follow him, wherever he went.
His white-knuckled grip loosens to bury his face in his hands instead. It's too much. He's feeling to much stuff at the same time. Anger, frustration, with himself, with Cas. Longing, hope, want,
"Dean, are you alright?" He carefully moved closer but stopped when the hunter gave him another look, something in those eyes freezing Cas to the spot. "Did I do something wrong? Did I somehow hurt you?"
. "Now more than ever", the angel assured. "But maybe...I think I'd like...to just let this seep in for a while?"
Dean really has no time or energy for a fond chuckle now.
, for that matter." Dean can hear the meaningful smirk in Cas' voice, can clearly imagine the warm sparkle in his eyes. "Even though I won't deny it does have its merits. But just being with you is enough to make me happy, Dean."
"Dean!" He didn't care to keep the panic out of his voice. "How much?"
Cas sighs, and Dean smirks.
"Hold on a sec. You
His head snaps up.
"Good", he says, easily picking up where they left off. "What're you gonna do the whole day without me, though?"
Their hands have somehow both found their way onto Dean's chest by now, clasped together, and it's Dean who tightens his hold this time, Dean who grips onto him in both reassurance and the search for support.
Cas loved it. Despite talking to Dean and how he'd assured Cas that he didn't want to hide in front of Sam or anyone else, Cas knew his beloved well enough to be aware that it might be easier said than done. He was delighted to find that Dean seemed as affectionate in front of Sam as he'd been in the previous months they'd spent alone at the bunker.
Dean had introduced Cas to the world. And he had enjoyed watching the angel discover new things along the way. Making him watch Dean's favourite movie, convincing him that a good piece of fried bacon was far better than that soja-based whatever crap Sam was preparing, giving him the mixtape with Dean's favourite songs. The joy Cas (and later Jack) showed towards every new detail was mirrored in Dean's sparkling eyes, just as if he were to experience them through Cas' eyes for the first time again, too. Cas is aware that sharing those things with him, things Dean
Which didn't mean it was easy for Dean to tell his treacherous body about that.
Cas swallowed again, his eyes flitting between Dean's face and their lightly entwined fingers. Finally, he nodded.
Only my second time writing smut btw, or well, third if you count the short additional one in HIITH...so bear with me. Just because I decided to write a fic that would obviously require a lot of smutty chapters at some point doesn't mean I actually know what I'm doing xD
Dean stared.
"You showed me these. Just the shadows. But I was terrified, man." Dean laughed a little breathlessly at the memory. "Fascinated too, though."
, Dean thought.
he'd apparently done and shit. It's hardly the first time Dean has prayed to Cas. It's the first time he's been told he also does it unconsciously.
"I've been underestimated a lot. People thought they could...push me around." She laughs a little grimly and feels him shifting beside her. When she looks though, he's smiling confidently.
He grinned wider.
"They look like...you."
Instead, his angel looked hurt, rejected, lost.
All that trust...from both of them. Cas had to close his eyes for a moment.
But at the same time, he was terribly scared. He didn't know how it would be, laying eyes on Cas, seeing all the damage he'd done. He couldn't even stand the thought of it, let alone see it with his own eyes, the undeniable and tangible, real proof of what he'd done, of what Cas had gone through, was still going through.
him. Like
"Oh." He looked at Cas, seemingly disappointed. "I mean I can if you'd rather..."
Cas knew that sex was important to Dean. Cas also knew that Dean didn't seem to be very comfortable with touching outside of sex. And maybe even then he could only let go because he knew he would never be seeing any of his partners again. At least that was what Cas had always assumed.
Because did that mean he was using Cas? Enjoying himself while he knew how hard this was for Cas, that for him it was just a way to overcome his trauma, not knowing that for Dean, it was so much more than that?
"God,
, he didn't say.
The surprise on Cas' face was obvious.
"You think so?"
"I would hope not", the angel chuckles, eyes beaming just the way Dean wants them to. The hunter lifts a teasing eyebrow, lips curled in a smirk.
It had been his desperation leading his actions, no doubt, a desperate cause asking for a desperate measure, Dean's head overwhelmed and causing him to act on instinct, anything to make Cas react to his words and follow his plea. That was all, Cas was sure, no matter how much he wanted it to be different.
Cas said he wanted this. And not just in any way, with anyone. He wanted it with
"You bastard!" He stares at Cas, mouth open. "You knew what it's from!" Cas has the audacity to grin at the accusation, shrugging innocently, and Dean just wants to wipe that smug look from his face when the angel shuts him up with a kiss. Cas already knows how to play him, it seems, for he's just physically unable to do anything but melt into the kiss, his annoyance melting away with it.
"You could just have asked, you know?"
Cas says, and takes a step in his direction, and what is he doing, what is he saying, what does this have to do with anything, what-?
Comments give me life so...if you feel like it, I take anything you have to give, like, seriously. Ok, bye and thanks for reading, everyone!
"Oh?"
Dean looked up in frustration to meet blue eyes sparkling with anger, just a hint of grace flashing in their depths. (Which wasn't hot either. Dammit.)
I'm so sorry. It's been so long. I know. You see, when I decide to write something it always starts with a conversation I want two characters to have, and then I start building a plot around that will lead up to that conversation. Thing is, we're past that point now, and my brilliant planning and I have literally no idea where I wanna go from here lol. Making it up as I go, I guess;)
"You're gonna be fine, Cas", he said now, tried to convince them both." We're gonna do this step by step, yeah? And we'll be fine."
"I didn't like it either." It was just a whisper, muttered into Cas' hair, but in Cas' ears, it rang clear as a bell. "When you left. Always thought maybe this time you wouldn't come back." Dean sighed, and it was a heavy sound, like the weight of the world was bottled up in it. "Just like everyone else. They all left, sooner or later."
He couldn't look away from his own hand, from the way it was cupping Cas' face, a hand that had been covered in the blood of countless people, a hand that had been raised to hurt and kill, a hand that Cas had miraculously chosen to trust.
"Cas?" He's not sure what he wants to hear (he's already been given all the words he could wish for, all the words anyone could wish for, hasn't he), not sure what he's searching in those blue eyes that look far too calm and peaceful, with emptiness staring in his face and Death lurking in his back. The angel smiles that smile again, one that Dean can't decide on loving or despising. Then there's a hand on his shoulder, and no, not his at all, it's Cas' shoulder, Cas' shoulder on Dean's body, the one that had marked him as the angel's long before he'd known he was, and even longer before he'd accepted it.
...and
"Cas..." He forced his eyes up, knew the words bubbling up in his throat weren't enough, would never be enough, but he had to say it anyway. "Cas, I'm so sorry. I'm so-
"Sure, but...jeez, Cas."
Dean squeezed his eyes shut for a second, keeping his voice unaffected and soothing.
~oOo~oOo~oOo~
, who just so happens to be an angel of the Lord and who he with all certainty did not want to kiss, like, at all.
Cas smiled at him when Dean leaned back, watched as Dean's hand lifted, the back of his fingers stroking reverently over Cas' cheek.
The following weeks are busy with preparation. Despite Dean's best efforts, Sam and Eileen manage to turn it into a huge thing, when asked only smirking something about it being a one time opportunity to see your ship getting married (and your brother, Sam adds as an afterthought) and even though Cas isn't exactly sure what their wedding has to do with sea travel, he deems it wiser not to asks and just lets them do whatever they're doing.
He'd meant to say
"Really?"
And not to him. Not to
"Because you were more important", he said, and somehow, it sounded like both the easiest thing to say and the hardest thing to admit. "More than my guilt and my anger."
. Not like that. Not completely. Not forever.
Not doing so was a fucking challenge, okay? And after-sex-cuddles made it frickin
His eyes were hopeful, pleading, but Dean didn't like the waver in his voice.
It was still a little awkward, how they tried to sit on the bed in a comfortable position, facing each other, knowing what was to come. Dean usually liked to be spontaneous about these sorts of things, but that was certainly the last thing that would work in Cas' case. Kissing in a sitting position was not ideal either, but he didn't dare suggest they lie down, didn't want to overwhelm or push Cas into something he wasn't ready for, and if it was just a change of position.
Still beautiful, still Dean Winchester.
Not with anyone. Certainly not with Cas.
This is not just a gesture, it's not a message, not even a promise. It's truth.
"Thank you..."
I was at my parents' work today. Waiting a lot. Used it for writing. So here you go;) Thought you wouldn't mind the early update, ehe.
He thinks about going for a drive but he can't. It's painful to look at Cas, to only look at him when he's looking away, how they spent years looking at each other. Only, it's worse now that he knows how it is to meet that blue gaze without restraint and how it is to be given a loving smile in return. It's painful to look at Cas and know his eyes would be hard if he were to meet them. But he still can't look away. Can't leave his presence, even if it's a cold and distant one.
The words that left his mouth when he opened them again had come unannounced, and they sounded alarmingly final even to his own ears.
~oOo~
"Yeah", he grins. "Yeah, Cas, that's how it works."
. But it hadn't felt like he imagines it's supposed to. He'd felt guilty, back then, sure that he was somehow unable to give them something they would have deserved, but...no matter how hard he tried, it just wasn't there. It felt almost like a job at times, like he did it because it was the right thing to do. He'd tried to want it, he'd
He remembers replaying moments like the one he'd just witnessed in his head, those moments he'd fed on for years, clung to like a safe rope. Rides in the Impala. Evenings with beer and laughter. A smile over something Cas had said. A hand on his arm. A hug after a long time apart. In that moment, when he'd been sure that it was all gone, all he could hear were the words that he needed to say.
Someone can be madly in love and still not be ready. They could love in a way they had never loved before and be afraid of it. It's alright to love someone who doesn't love you back, or maybe just can't. As long as they're worth you loving them. As long as they deserve it. And Cas couldn't imagine a single person more deserving of love than Dean Winchester.
"What is it? Dean?"
His life sucks tremendously. And that's saying something, considering they'd been faced with the literal Endtimes. More than once. There's no possibility of imminent death lurking now, but he almost wishes there was. Easier to shut out your personal life when you got your survival to focus on.
"Dean, come on in." Sam waves him towards the table and he purposefully steers towards the chair next to his brother, diagonally set from Cas, who he's still so not avoiding, just in case you missed it the first time. "I was just telling Cas that Eileen called. She's gonna be back home in a few days."
He can't take any more.
And that was how they found themselves here now, Dean with a wall in his back, his knuckles slightly swollen, the cold night air clearing his head off the alcohol in his blood and an angel yelling at him.
But then, he supposed, neither had Dean.
A Dean who worried was a Dean who cared, a Dean who was here, a Dean who stayed.
"Maybe you should leave them out for a bit", Dean suggested. "Let air on the wounds, y'know. Recharge your mojo before trying to use it again."
"Oh." Cas lowered his eyes, unable to hide his disappointment. "Okay."
He still couldn't believe he was here, couldn't believe how good it felt, how he never wanted to have this moment end. The tiny voice in his mind that usually told him he didn't get to have nice things, good things, how he'd never be deserving of it, of Cas...it had gone quiet, drowned out by the warm glow in his chest that just kept spreading and spreading the longer he remained in his angel's arms.
The anger is completely drained out of the angel's voice by now, leaving it raw, almost pleading, and Dean nods to himself, drives a hand over his face, lets the emotion loosen his tongue, confess openly and truthfully. The pain of hearing Cas like that is mixing with the pain that's become his constant companion and he doesn't dare look at him, fixes his eyes on the kitchen tiles.
in love with you."
"I..." Dean swallowed hard, willed his vocal cords to work. "Because I..."
It's a leap of faith.
Dean thought
That wasn't too bad. Not
"You're the only one I've ever truly wanted, Dean", he said with an ease that had Dean's head spinning.
, was all he could think.
"See you soon", he'll say. "Love you."
It sounded so easy, coming from Cas' lips like that, so sincere and
Whatever Dean had expected, it hadn't been this.
he asks himself. There are so many.
That was actually an understatement, in fact Dean felt almost dizzy at the thought of being allowed to kiss Cas, and yet the angel looked at him as if he'd just revealed one of the seven wonders of the world. (In Dean's opinion, Cas was the eighth.)
- and Cas felt himself relax into the pressure as he realized there would be no pain. And all the while Dean kept kissing him through it, Cas latching onto Dean's lips like a starving man, trying to convey his relief and gratitude through presses of lips, the little sounds breathed into the space between them.
"What do you want, angel?"
"You know what, never mind." He just wants to disappear through the door as quickly as possible when a sigh from Cas stops him.
"Tell me again what you want me to know", Cas begged. "Tell me you want me. Tell me you- you..."
to help him, wanted him to be fine, to be happy. A world where Dean held him and touched him and kissed him. A world where he could overcome it because it was
A bitter laugh had escaped Dean's throat.
He wants to do it. He can't do it.
He still didn't get it. Cas said these things all the time. And with so much ease, so much sincerity, they couldn't be anything but the truth. How had he ended up here, with this extraordinary being in his arms, looking at him like...like
"Fuck", Dean breathes out and feels Cas hum against his neck.
"I get it." Tony nodded again, gestured less than discreetly towards Dean's obviously impatient figure. "Can't say I see the appeal, but...I get it."
"Dean-"
The content hum that reverberated through Cas' body made Dean close his eyes for a second, revelling in the angel's warm body against his, Cas' fingers painting slow patterns on Dean's shoulder. He breathed in, let the feeling of peace and happiness and
they're talking about here.
Because this isn't just about him, it's about Cas, too. Cas' happiness depends on this, on him.
"Is there a way to make you stop worrying all the time?"
(Was it just a slip of tongue, Cas asks himself, or is this what they're like now? Dean calling him his angel, acknowledging that he knows the colour of Cas' favourite mug -and maybe even why it's his favourite colour-, calling him sunshine and sweetheart, even if in jest? If this is what it's gonna be like, Cas has nothing to complain.)
He had looked so devastated when the kiss broke, even more so after Cas cleared his head from the remaining effects of alcohol in his blood.
Cas shrugged shyly, but his eyes were fixed on Dean, his voice quiet but determined.
But the thing is, he can't do that, either. He's too selfish. Too selfish to tell him to leave. Too selfish to ask him to stay (too selfish to tell him why he wants him to stay). Too selfish to lose him, one way or the other.
wall, and yeah, no, he didn't really wanna have his first time with Cas in the bunker's kitchen, but the angel was so warm against him and his lips were so soft and his moans sounded so
He told himself it was nothing. He told himself it would go away. He told himself it didn't mean anything. He told himself it was just an objective appreciation for what everybody in their right mind must consider aesthetically pleasing, nothing more, nothing deeper, certainly nothing he needed to worry about.
"I wanted you to", he said, resuming to stroke Cas' hair. "I told you to", he remembered through the hazy mist of pleasure.
"Thank you, Dean."
"Do you want to talk about it?"
And it felt nice, the touch. Very nice. There were no wandering hands, just steady points of pressure, grounding, holding him together. He couldn't be entirely sure he wouldn't just fall apart if Dean ever let go.
"I'm wonderful, my love." Cas looked at him with hooded eyes and a brilliant smile. "I'm absolutely wonderful."
And finally he felt Cas smile, his lips tickling Dean's skin where they brushed against his neck.
"Then leave it", Dean says immediately, and Cas has to bite his lip to hold back a moan.
Because this is Cas
"What? Nothing!", he says more defensively than he should. "I didn't do anything. You're the angel, I thought-"
~oOo~oOo~oOo~
Cas shrugged, but Dean could feel that his shoulders had relaxed.
Sam is still grinning from ear to ear when he releases Dean again to turn his attention back to the cooking, taking just a moment to load everything on a plate while Dean goes and takes a seat next to Cas, smiling sheepishly.
Maybe not. But then, Lucifer didn't do random. There was a plan behind his actions, a purpose...and if it was just to drive a wedge between them, destroying them from within because they had crossed him one time too many.
He hesitantly made move towards the door, feeling that there wasn't more to get out of Dean at the moment, and still he stayed turned towards his bother as he went, searching eyes full of worry. Dean couldn't even appreciate it. There was nothing Sam could do to help him. And he sure as hell wasn't the one that needed their care and attention right now.
But he couldn't. He
Still, the confirmation hurts. It hurts like a bitch.
Dean nodded, hesitantly brought his cup to his lips and took a sip. Cas couldn't stop staring. The
Miracle runs to the staircase, looks at the door of the bunker before directing his gaze back at Cas and whimpers again. Cas throws a glance at the clock on the wall. It's been hours since Sam and Eileen left, he realises, wrinkling his brow. Dean should have been back by now, shouldn't he? His first instinct is to worry, but he knows it won't do any good. Maybe he'd simply needed longer than anticipated. Maybe the stores had been crowded. Maybe he had to refuel the Impala. Maybe he's stuck in traffic.
He lifts one of Cas' hands to his lips, presses a kiss to his knuckles, just because he feels like it, just because he can.
"Perhaps he got lost", Cas suggests. "I already checked this route twice. Is there anywhere else you think he might go?"
"Maybe I shouldn't be here at all."
And it was scary, it was fucking terrifying, the power he had over Dean, how he could break him with a single word. But if anyone could manage to take the shattered pieces of his heart and miraculously find it to be worthy, mend it with a single touch, it would be Cas.
"Dean."
~oOo~oOo~oOo~
to leave, I-"
Dean followed Cas down when the angel pulled him to lie on top of him, arms coming around to encircle Dean protectively, reminding him of this place where he felt like he belonged, the home he had found in his angel's embrace. Dean's own hands were sweeping up Cas' sides, fingers gliding over smooth skin, mapping out every inch of his body he could reach. Cas whimpered when Dean's mouth trailed off to follow the line of his jaw, down his neck and to the hickey on his collarbone, licking over the purple mark there, smiling against his skin when Cas gasped.
"Oh, Dean", Cas breathed, and the little smile forming on his lips made Dean's silly heart skip a beat.
Turning back around without waiting for an answer because that's totally not rude or a give-away or just plain creepy, he grabs the coffee filters from the cupboard, sighing internally.
. He'd been there all the time. And he wouldn't leave. Cas knew he wouldn't.
"Yeah?"
"I'm sorry", he whimpered again, felt Dean holding him tighter.
"Are you happy, Cas?", Dean asks him at some point while they're sitting on a bench between the trees, the beautiful scenery of the lake spread out in front of them. Miracle is playing at the edge of the water. The air is warm around them, the bench is warm from the sun, and Dean has taken off his flannel that's knotted around his waist now.
"I'm fine." Cas huffs. Dean can pull this shit with whoever he wants, but he's not stupid.
Afterwards, he's ashamed. But Dean never needed to know. And none of this is even nearly as embarrassing as going to suck up all of the most evil creatures ever created in the hubris to believe you could become God, so...
"Good night, Dean."
Boundaries are safe. Walls are protection. Personal space is an armour.
"Ha!" Sam huffs, his eyes drawn up in disbelief. "Have you met Dean?"
Dean had to change that.
"Yeah." Sam huffs. "But I've been trying to work on them for weeks and you're here..what? Maybe an hour and they're talking again."
. Big word for him. He'd always felt it everywhere. Almost home. Almost happy. Almost fine. Almost changed. Almost ready.
"I have told you many times, I'm utterly indifferent to gender and sexual orientation."
To be fair to Cas not seeing through Dean's meaning, the subtext
And once again...thank you all!! <3
"That's it." Dean pressed a kiss to the corner of Cas' mouth, the angel turning his head to chase after Dean's lips. "That's right, Cas. Does it feel good?"
He only then realised that his hands had a death-grip on Cas' shoulders, and he had to actively tell his fingers to unclamp and stop burying their nail in the angel's skin. There would be small crescent shapes left if he were to look, Dean was sure, and a burning, possessive need to mark his angel collided with the dreadful memory of the scratches and bruises those same fingers had left behind on Cas' skin last time, marks both of them had been impatiently watching as they turned from violet to green and yellow before disappearing without a trace.
"I know", Cas assured him sincerely. "I appreciate you being careful, and there's nothing wrong with you being gentle. I just wanted to be sure you don't think there will never be any other way", he explained. "Someday, I hope we'll both be ready to let go and just...
"Cas?!" He even looks in Sammy's room, even though he can think of no reason whatsoever why Cas should be in there. (Not that he has any reason to be in Dean's room, either, and it had been pure coincidence that he'd checked there first. Really.)
He hoped Dean would just leave it at that. But of course, he didn't have that much luck.
Cas couldn't hide that he was slightly taken aback by that declaration. Especially from Dean. Not that he didn't think Dean capable of showing affection just for the sake of it, without intent. Dean was the most loving person he had ever met, and he was sure, whoever Dean would choose to bestow his love upon would be the most blessed creature in all of existence for receiving all the love and care Dean had to offer.
"How bad is it?", he asked instead through gritted teeth, eyes lowered to the mattress between his knees.
Dean smiled. Cas breathed. Dean nodded encouragingly. Cas focused. Dean told him how well he was doing. And the flashes vanished.
But now that he knew Cas could experience this sort of human emotion, might even be looking for that special someone, that connection he was missing...
If Cas only knew. If he only knew how easy it had all been, so much easier than it should. Just sitting in silence. Or talking for hours. Even touching him. Being touched by him. Maybe because his love for Cas had existed for years, silently, secretly running beneath the surface.
want you here. I
He'd thought it would all end.
"Dean-"
He only now realises that his feet are moving, aggressively pacing up and down in his room. Maybe his body is searching ways to release whatever is boiling inside of him. He can't quite pin down what it is, anger, worry, sadness, frustration, a bit of everything. And he can't make it shut up. He can't make his head shut up.
. "But I couldn't let you go on without knowing what this is to me. Even if it means you want me to stop. But I couldn't keep this up, it felt like I was using you and I couldn't, Cas."
"So anyway." Sam's voice rips him back to reality and he quickly lowers his eyes to his hands in his lap. He has no idea how long he's been staring at Dean while the hunter is busying himself in the kitchen, but if Sam clearing his throat has anything to say about it, it has been too long. "Eileen said she got a real good lead from talking to some of the locals", the younger Winchester brother continues, "There was this club where people kept going missing over months, the police had been looking into it but there were no hints, no bodies no nothin' and they dropped it."
"Forget what?"
Dean stared at him, wondering if he'd heard correctly, but yes,
"Because I can't be away from you", Dean said then, and it sounded like both the hardest and the most relieving thing to admit. "But I can't be near you, either. Because when I am...I might do or say something stupid." Dean shrugged, smiled sheepishly. "Like that kiss in the parking lot. I might tell you that I'm the person you should go home with. And not just...y'know, go home...but...the way you almost went with him. I might tell you that
"But it is." The angel's voice is barely above a whisper, his eyes lowered to the floor.
"Y-Yeah." Dean faltered for a second, taken aback by the accusation in Cas voice. "I mean...obviously."
He allows himself a moment to indulge in the fantasy that he actually could. Dean deserves it. He deserves to be touched and treated like the valuable, precious thing that he is, the way Cas knows Dean refuses to believe he is worthy of, even if he can't help to dream of it.
"We can start as soon as you're ready."
He sighs and turns around. Shit.
Cas was plagued by a nightmare that night, the first one he'd had in weeks.
"I happened."
"Well." Dean swallows hard. "Guess again."
Dean's brow wrinkled.
should be a good time to think about such things. Yep.
Sam's brow furrowed.
"Cas..."
He pulled himself together at day, because that's what Cas needed him to do. He didn't want to burden Cas further, so he stayed strong, played strong, but that didn't mean he wasn't secretly falling apart by the seams.
Cas takes his time, studies the lines of Dean's body longer than Dean is used to. (And that means something, considering the excessive amount of staring that had been going on since the day they met.)
"Yeah, whatever." He gestures in the angel's general direction, captures the length of him with an awkward wave of his hand. "This? This is
"Dean."
He reached for Cas' cock, revelled in the angel's gasp at the contact, stroking him a few times to make sure he was back to full hardness after their interruption.
, Cas answered breathlessly, and shit he was so screwed (soon more than figuratively speaking, with any luck).
and this is fucking terrifying and amazing and a lot. Like...a
"Okay." Cas stands in the kitchen like a little boy on his first day at a new school, shy and awkward and insecure. Dean has to remind himself that this is an actual angel right there in front of him. Cas shouldn't ever have to look like that. And not because of him.
Not that it was uncomfortable. Far from it. Dean was actually totally on board with it, especially when Cas released a breath against his neck and unconsciously rolled his hips in a tiny movement to grind against Dean in his sleep. Oh
disappointment? It was too much.
"For...for everything", he presses out, eloquent as ever. "All that...bitching at you in the kitchen and...letting you sit here alone when you should be out there with Sam and Eileen and Jack and..."
It will be enough, he tells himself, as often as it takes to believe it.
"You can't know that." Cas drew back, needed to look into Dean's eyes again. "I can't know that."
Dean felt giddy.
"You wanna try?", he asked, pulling his own hand away in invitation.
He lifts his other hand to cup Dean's face, traces his thumb over his cheek in that way that has become so beautifully familiar to him.
"Yes?" Cas smiled shily, beautifully, and Dean just had to lean down and kiss him again, just a press of lips, short and sweet.
"Shush." He feels Cas' chin settle on his head. "It's okay. It's okay. I know."
Cas nodded frantically in return, responding eagerly when Dean pressed their mouths together for the umpteenth time that night.
He just wished this day would never end, that they could just drive on and on for eternity like this, for he knew as soon as they reached the bunker, its silence and its memories, it would all go back to the way it had been before.
~oOo~
~oOo~
"Oh." Dean could feel himself blush. Stupid blood circulation. But
Yeah, exactly.
Cas faltered.
Dean watches how Miracle gets all excited over the movement on the surface of the water when he touches it with his paw, curious but not courageous enough to actually step into it yet. He barks at it and Dean smiles. And Cas watches Dean smile, head slightly tilted to the side.
"It's not your fault", Cas says, because of course Cas would tell him that. He knows about the unreasonable sting of guilt inside him before Dean even noticed it himself. "It's just nice to see you without worry or pain written all over your face. And at night...I guess I can just enjoy that look for a while, get lost in the fantasy that you could always look as...free."
"Fine, fine. Now shut up and kiss me again." He tries to pull Cas down to him, desperate to continue what they were doing in...
"You're right." Cas nodded in confirmation. "I've never been interested in anyone else. There was no room for anyone else, Dean. Not with you already occupying all of it."
Was he even fine with all those things?
Cas had said, and Dean hates himself for making Cas believe that for even a second.
He was being pathetic. Selfish. Dean knew that.
"Cas?"
He bit his lip to hold back a groan of his own as Dean flicked his thumb over his tip on the upstroke, smoothing the way down with his own precome, his hips bucking up into his hand.
The choked sound Dean made at the contact was beautiful, but Cas still couldn't help it when he tensed, immediately seeing the worry in Dean's eyes when the hunter felt his muscles locking up beneath his hands.
"I appreciate what you're doing for me here, Dean", Cas said, pulling Dean from his thoughts, misinterpreting his tense expression. "I know it's a lot to ask, and I wouldn't burden you if I thought there was anyone- but I...I couldn't-"
"Nono, don't thank me, Cas, not for this." Dean pressed another quick kiss to his lips, close-mouthed, reassuring. "I wouldn't do it if I didn't want to", he told Cas truthfully, brushing a lock of hair out of his forehead. "A-And not just to help you. Also just...for me."
"Dean. Dean, I-" Cas sucked in shaky breaths as Dean let his mouth wander down Cas' neck instead, sucking a mark. "I didn't know it could feel like this."
Cas nodded against his forehead, bumping their noses together.
~oOo~
"It's still there, you know?"
He can't stand the thought of it happening again, not again, not like in purgatory, not
His body kept making out with the woman in his arms, but his mind kept wandering back to Cas, asking himself what he was doing, what they were talking about, what it was that made Cas enjoy that guy's company. It didn't take long until he had to open his eyes again, his head too set on conjuring up images of Cas getting way too friendly with that dude over there. His gaze wandered across the bar, immediately settling on his target.
"Okay." It's a whisper, drawn from the angel's throat by the look in Dean's eyes, that muddle of longing, nervousness and determination, and he knows this is the right thing when Dean smiles in relief.
Because if he didn't, and in Dean's mind, there was more than a small chance that he didn't, it might end everything they had created here. Not only the new relationship they'd established through the practicing sessions, maybe even the friendship it was built on.
who I could never love just because they're
"Hello, Dean."
Oh yeah nice. Teasing material. That's actually perfect. Making someone else uncomfortable to cover up his own nerves? Genius.
wanted Cas. And wasn't that both wonderful and horrible?
This though, this is a good kind of excitement.
How beautiful to have found a heart that loved you, without asking you for anything but to be okay.
He wanted nothing more than to care for Cas, to help him, to comfort him - but how could he, when all Dean knew as his own comfort was touch, and touch was the one thing Cas couldn't take from him?
This is a long one. Got a bit out of hand tbh. I just hope you'll like it. Not beta read and posted at 6am as usual.
, not that Dean can blame him right now but duuude.
But...urgh, well. He doesn't have a good reason. Just...
"Nonono!" Dean shakes his head. "Don't you give me that kicked puppy face, dude, not now!"
"Hm?"
There were cries and sobs and furniture flying around, and it took two bloody hands and a wrecked room to make him understand that he was the one making those noises.
Dean sounded as breathless as he felt, overwhelmed by a wave of emotion, happiness, love...
"Yeah, that's the thing, isn't it?" The words feel like venom on his tongue and he hates himself for speaking them, for spitting them in Cas' face like that. Cas who never did anything wrong, Cas who has no fault in any of this, Cas whose only crime is that he's too humble. "You never expect anything, Cas. You're this good...damn
~oOo~oOo~oOo~
, Cas hisses, and Dean wastes no time before he frees them both of the last remaining items of clothing. He pushes Cas to lie on his back and the angel instantly reaches for Dean to follow, welcomes him in his arms and they moan in unison when their erections brush together. They enjoy the pressure for a moment, perfectly lined up, the feeling of skin on skin. Then Dean reaches between them, takes them both in hand, and Cas bucks his hips and throws his head back with a moan of something that could be Dean's name. He leans down to capture the angel's mouth in a kiss, swallows all those sweet sounds Cas is making, because why shouldn't he, they're his to own, anyway.
Dean's eyes snap up and he releases a shaky breath at the sight that greets him. Cas' features are a turmoil of emotion. A soft smile in the corner of his mouth collides with the sparks of surprise and fear in his eyes, all wrapped up by a general mixture of awe and confusion.
"No, Dean, it's fine." A small laugh escaped him, free and incredulous. "I'm alright. It's...it's
"Mhm."
He picks it up, takes a bite and...chokes.
It got easier.
"Let me", Cas whispered while leaning in again, half request, half question, and Dean had just time to nod before their lips connected again, just in case Cas needed confirmation, permission.
After all the steps they'd taken with such success recently, Cas was more eager than ever to continue what Dean had long stopped referring to as 'practicing' sessions in his own head. He knew it hadn't been about that for him from the beginning, knew his weak attempt at pretence had only served to quieten his own guilt.
"So." Cas lets out a shaky breath at the relieving sound of Dean's voice. It's different now, more carefree, more relaxed, more like
"It's..." Dean took a long steadying breath. "Oh, shit Cas there's- the left one, there's feathers missing, I can-" He swallowed, "-can see- but damn..."
Cas' voice was hushed into a whimper, his body slowly rocking itself back and forth. Dean couldn't stand it, couldn't stand to look at it. And yet the thought of leaving, fleeing from the sight made him sick to his stomach. Still, he asked again.
.) "Don't want you gettin' cold", he says like an idiot and Cas squints his eyes.
"You said it'd be weird with me not touching you back. But we also don't wanna make you feel...out of control. How about you take my hand and guide it? Show me where it's okay to touch? Just try it out for yourself...what feels good."
He hears it coming, a sound like water, ink-black and hungry. He turns just to see what he already knows will be there, an opening in the wall, clawing forward, eating away at the warding. The moment he turns back is the moment the door finally flies open and he knows they're trapped. They were all along, but the whole hopelessness of their situation hits him now, pressing the air from his lungs, making his already stinging eyes water.
He knows he shouldn't.
and they're terrifying the shit out of him. So better not acknowledge them, better shove them down soooooo far that he won't even manage to dig them up again himself. The only times he allows them a second to breathe is through outbursts of rage.
"You haven't?"
And how was Cas supposed to answer that? How was he supposed to tell Dean that he was his life? His reason and his purpose, his will, his guidance, his direction?  His freedom and his home?
Or was even interested in it.
"Do you think-"
, Cas' heart cried out what his mouth couldn't,
Sam thinks.
"That's all I'll ever need", Cas promised,
"If you wouldn't mind. I don't want you to hold back on your own pleasure for my sake, Dean", he told him. "And even more so I'd like to be involved in yours...if I can. You're right, I'm not ready to do this properly yet. But maybe I could just...be there?"
And finally the stinging in Cas' eyes returned, emotions meddling in Cas' chest to an overwhelming crescendo that found its release in the tears rolling down his cheeks, running hot and salty over his smiling lips.
Cas rolls onto his side to be able to look at Dean as they lie snuggled up under the covers of the hunter's bed. (A wave of the angel's hand had taken care of cleaning them up and putting their boxers back on, to which Dean had lifted his eyebrows but then shrugged, pleased to just lie down and enjoy the afterglow.)
"None of that", he mumbled, lowering his eyes to his hands that started fiddling with the blanket. "Do you...ah. When do you wanna start?"
. Is this what Cas thought of him? Is this what he thought Dean would do? Son of a bitch, he fucked up even more than he thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas worked his way to Dean's mouth, nibbling on his earlobe, leaving a trail of kisses along his jawline, the stubble a pleasant scratch against his lips. When he placed a chaste kiss on the corner of Dean's mouth, he found him already waiting, turning his head and chasing Cas' lips, silently begging for him to meet them with his own.
"Not right..."
Dean smiled.
it can grasp. "You talked about colours, right? Maybe it changed colour? Did it become weaker? Or-"
Sam shakes his head.
He had to stop himself there for a second, think again, check it was really him. Because Dean was many things, but happy was not one of them. Neither was Cas, for that matter. It wasn't something they did, wasn't something they got to do, usually.
"Don't you want to return to your new acquaintance?"
do this shit sober. He doesn't know how to deal with the things inside of him like this, the pain and the rage and the...the...
~oOo~oOo~oOo~
"Yeah, whatever."
Cas managed to look both relieved and disappointed. He licked his lips.
Guys. I really can't believe we're finally here. Oh my God.
"I-" The words are stuck in his dry throat, have to be pressed out between clenched teeth. "I'm not sure what you're implying here, Sammy, but-"
Oh, Cas. Buddy...believe me, that guy's intentions were far from innocent."
he'd said. And believed it himself.
Just go for it.
"You know I..." Dean stared, waiting for his mind to catch up with his tongue. "I wanted this, too", he finally said, pulling Cas closer for emphasis. "When we...started this, I told you I wanted your body, but I needed- I needed..."
All of it. That Lucifer got in at all, that he could hurt Cas, that he knew exactly the way to do it. All because Dean couldn't get his heart under control.
Dean's hands were trembling by his side, his breathing shaky.
So Cas nodded, not bothering to hide the tears of relief and gratitude in his eyes, and Dean smiled, pulling him into his arms before the tears could start to fall, a hand driving soothingly through his hair.
Dean sighed, and Cas just wanted to reach out and pull him in, feel Dean's heart beat against his, run his fingers through his hair, hear him hum contently against Cas' mouth.
Spoiler alert. He does.)
And how could Dean say no to that.
"I've got you." Dean was panting, his rhythm beginning to falter, their kisses turning sloppy. "You're safe with me, angel. My angel. Let go, sweetheart."
"That's right." Dean put a hand over Cas', encouraged him to hold onto him, humming when nails bit into his skin. "Relax. Don't think too much. Just feel."
reaches his ears, it's already too late. Cas pushes him out of the way and into the wall, onto the floor, not enough to hurt (never), but with a power and determination that distinguish him as the former angel of the Lord he is. Dean sometimes tends to forget it, that Cas is that powerful celestial being and not just the same human mess they all are. He knows to hide it well, beneath beige trenchcoats, soft eyes and gentle smiles. He knows to hide it behind actions, too, the way he talks to them like they were equals, like friends, like family, the way he
He closed the driver's door and rounded the car, coming to stand next to Cas who smiled at their surroundings, fields full of wildflowers on every side, framed by a forest in the distance, the air warm around them and -Dean noticed, pleased with himself- filled with the humming of bees.
"But she tracked one of the vamps down and used it as lead to the nest. Small one, maybe six, seven. Smart ones, though. Careful. They'd caged the victims, kept them alive to feed on them for a while and burned the bodies to leave no traces. Took them out all by herself."
, Cas wanted to say, not just talking about the food.
How pathetic. He should be ashamed of himself. (He is.) Not only that he's too much of a coward himself to admit to what he wants and to fucking go and ask for it, dammit, he can't even watch others have it and not be a jealous ass about it.
"Are you, Cas? Mine?" Dean knows the answer. He still needs to hear Cas say it. And he does, without hesitation.
Dean looked up to meet Cas' hooded eyes.
clothes, but they can hardly share Dean's sparse wardrobe on a daily basis. The coat stayed though, and he isn't sorry Cas insisted on keeping it, knows that coat like he knows the back of his hand.
"No." He throws a sad glance at the empty doorway, slightly shaking his head. "I tried to talk to Dean but...you know how he is."
Cas didn't like bars. He didn't like
No. Cas probably didn't know what was going on. His poor, oblivious angel was just being nice and didn't get what that douche was after. Dean tried to swallow the feeling of sickness emerging at the sight of someone else touching Cas. Cas was an angel, for fuck's sake! That guy had no clue what fire he was playing with. The audacity! No random dudes in bars should be allowed to touch his angel with their greasy, greedy, grabby hands! Cas was
"This makes me very happy", Cas says one evening a few days later, sprawled out on the mattress with Dean tucked into his side, face buried in the angel's neck. He sounds so content Dean smiles despite the worry and guilt still gnawing at his heart.
Cas turns and makes his way to the door Dean vanished through and Eileen exchanges a quick glance with Sam who's coming up behind her, the same mixture of concern and sympathy on his face that she feels herself. Before he walks out though, Cas turns again, smiling when he sees that Sam has put an arm around her shoulder.
"Are you absolutely certain?"
He snapped out of his thoughts, a disbelieving eyebrow lifting of its own accord when he saw the angel was sitting on the bed, on top of the covers, still wearing that damn coat.
He did. His head lifted of its own accord, green eyes meeting blue, unable to deny Cas anything he asked.
If he drowned, perhaps he could forget.
. Just Dean isn't sure anymore what that means.
"I'm not sure if my wanting you made it harder or easier, in that moment...", he said to the room, almost absentmindedly, before shaking his head and refocusing on Dean. "It doesn't matter. We're here now. We can...we can make this work, Dean. I want to get back there. To the way I wanted you...before. Do you think you can help me get there?"
"Hey", he breathed, the corner of his lip twitching, and Cas could feel himself mirroring the smile.
Dean swallowed hard, desperately trying to force the small spark of hope he could feel emerging back into the dark pit it had come from.
Cas' hands were so warm and soft against his skin, his eyes so wide with something that looked suspiciously close to awe, and Dean really struggled not to lose himself in the sight, the feeling,
he breathed against his lips, "need to feel you..."
"Well", Cas hesitated, unsure if he was interested in being drawn into a conversation. "I was here with my...a friend, but..." He couldn't stop himself from turning and gesturing in Dean's direction, ignoring the sting in his heart when he spotted him against a wall in the opposite corner of the room, wrapped up in a female embrace. "He seems to have found better companionship", Cas mumbled, quickly turning away.
, he explained, cupping Dean's face in his hands, smiling at him." So good. It's
"So when this whole thing is over, even if you decide it's over now, right here, this very minute, no matter what we did, no matter how you feel about that, no matter what you think I feel about that, just promise me-
, this was what he'd begged for, this-
Perhaps there's a small part of him, far in the back of his mind, some tiny bit of self-esteem that unconsciously knows the real reason he gets so mad is that he sees the injustice of it all. Only, he doesn't really have access to that part anymore. It's buried under too many layers of pain, sorrow and bitterness.
doing this for me", Dean hears himself say, the desperation leaked from his voice now, leaving it empty. "You don't want me to get old while you stay like this, young and gorgeous and- You don't want me to die alone", he says, and it isn't a question, but Cas still shakes his head at him and keeps smiling that strange sad smile.
He couldn't go there yet, echoes of that other, unwanted pleasure too fresh in his muscles, torn from him, worn out of his body, caused by fingers that were so similar yet so different from the ones touching him now.
Pleasure was hooding Cas' eyes, but he could still make out the small spark of panic behind, pausing his movements.
Sam looks doubtfully between Cas and the dog lying in a corner of the library. Cas has never been alone with Miracle until now, that's why Sam had offered to look after him in the first place.
Cas shrugs lightly.
"So...are we going to?"
"Dean-"
As if on instinct, Dean reaches for Cas' pants, fingers fumbling awkwardly with the zipper. His hand is shaking, but Cas grabs it and presses soft kisses to his palm that make Dean feel things he doesn't want to think about too closely. He watches in wonder how his hand slowly stills in Cas', although he rather feels like trembling all over instead. There's a question in Cas' eyes when he releases Dean's hand again and the hunter nods, watching how the angel shrugs out of his pants before helping Dean discard his own, blue eyes never leaving his. There's heat in Cas' gaze that makes Dean's throat go dry, but their eye-contact is also calming, comforting in its familiarity. He lets Cas come to him once they're left in nothing but boxers, lets him plant a kiss on Dean's lips, slow and soft.
, he groaned, leaned his forehead against Cas', his warm, heavy breaths washing over the angel's face.
the shift in the air when Dean was shaken by a wave of relief at his words. "Your eyes, they're...warm and inviting and kind. Even when you're angry, then there's pain and worry but- never cruelty. They're never cold and empty like his were. I couldn't stand to look at them, Dean, I-"
"Well." Jack scrutinizes his burger (he's already eaten half, one could say that makes it
"Okay."
He'd never heard his own voice so pleading, so damn needy, but Cas was soothing him, was holding him close and whispering into his ear, so maybe it was fine.
Cas nodded, his nails digging into Dean's hips, creating little sparks of pleasure-pain.
"But dude, if it's too much, you don't have to, I don't want you to use the bit of grace you recharged so far."
He should move his hand. He really should.
Doing GISH rn, so it took a little longer, but here we finally are. I'm so happy yall seemed to have liked the last chapter, your comments have all been so amazing and kind. And even tho I haven't really been answering any comments recently, my friend Charlie will confirm that I read and cherish every one of them, seeing that little 0 behind my inbox turn into a 1 gives me such an adrenaline kick, it can't be healthy.
"Congrats, man."
that Dean couldn't mind) and maybe a bit of strawberry. His eyes fluttered close of their own accord, and when Dean felt a tentative hand sneak up to his face and around his neck to wave long, elegant fingers into his hair, Dean was lost. Before he knew it, his own arm came around the angel's waist to pull him closer, a small sound of surprise escaping Cas' lips, but not a displeased one. And just for a second, he almost forgot that this wasn't real, that maybe they were here just because they wanted to, because Cas
His eyes flew open, found hopeful, hesitant green. Cas was sure he'd never loved Dean more than in this moment.
Cas smiled, a shy thing somehow, with just a bit of a smirk curling one corner of his mouth.
The times Cas had died had made it impossible for Dean to pretend as if he didn't depend on the angel's presence in his life. He needed it. He needed
Because Dean plants roots so deeply in people he loves that he always loses a part of himself when they leave. And they always leave. It's become sort of a pattern, people leaving him. And he's angry. He tries to be angry with them, but never seems able to keep that up long enough. He loves them even after they left, how can he be angry with them? But the anger has to go somewhere, so he's angry with himself instead. They must have had a reason to leave, didn't they? There must be a reason why it's always him who's left behind.
The next thing he knew was his eyes opening from total blackness to a dimly lit semi-darkness.
"No, Cas, wait, I didn't-", he starts, but the angel is gone, the trenchcoat vanished around the doorframe, hurried footsteps losing themselves in the distance. "Didn't mean it like that", he whispers to himself, swallowing around the huge lump in his throat.
"Cas. How could I not be? Being with you, in any way, I told you - it's a gift to me, Cas. Just being able to hold you...give you comfort...it's..." Dean breathed out, lightly shook his head in what looked like happy disbelief. "I want you to feel...to
"Of course I knew, Dean!" Cas lifted his hands in a gesture of frustration. "How stupid do you think I am? I was perfectly aware of his intentions, why else would I have encouraged him?"
"You good to try again?", the hunter asked then, and Cas swallowed, steeled himself, nodded.
"W-What?"
"I'm here, angel. You're here with me."
"Shit, yeah, Cas. Like that."
"Yeah", he agreed. "Yeah, we did."
, where no one's gonna suddenly burst in, actually truly alone for the first time in weeks, the first time since...since...
"We'll take it slow, sweetheart", he said, the pet name slipping out without permission, but it felt so incredibly right on his tongue, made Cas' eyes only soften, so he simply let it. "Yeah? I can make it good for you."
God, why hadn't he thought of that?
Oh, the things he'd made him do, the things Dean's mind hadn't stopped his own hands from doing...
me, telling me that you love me..."
Except that Dean hasn't really planned anything. And even if he had, there's a good chance all of the rehearsed lines would have disappeared from his mind now that he meets Cas' eyes. They look tired, a sort of emotional exhaustion Dean can feel himself, but he can still see the fire burning behind the veil, a flame kindled by frustration and anger.
"Shhh. It's fine. You're fine." Dean rested his chin on Cas' head, inhaled the scent of his hair as he held him tighter. "We're fine, Cas."
"That's...not all. Dean, I-"
"Nono." Cas gave him a tentative smile. "Don't apologize. I...I feel honoured that you would choose me for this, Dean."
"Caaaas." Cas grins wider. "I guess that's it then", Dean says, theatrically lifting his arms and letting them fall down again. "My carefully preserved womanizer-meets-bad-boy image destroyed, my pride and dignity shattered at your feet. RIP."
, pervert), and if he'd had any hesitation it was certainly blown away a second later when dream-Cas
He gasps when finally a finger carefully brushes his rim, just featherlight touches to let him get used to the feeling. He's done this to himself before, a few guilty hours he's spent fantasizing about this exact scenario, but he'd never let someone else. It's a lot more intense that way, maybe because he doesn't know when to expect the next brush of fingers, maybe simply because it's Cas. Dean closes his eyes, concentrates on relaxing, the sound of Cas' gentle voice that whispers soothing nothings into his ear. When he finally presses a finger inside, it's accompanied by a surge of warmth, a tingling sensation that spreads through Dean's whole body and wakes goosebumps on his skin.
Dean spat out in disgust, fell forward with his hands on the cold ground, his shaky arms barely supporting his own weight. He was weak, tired, drained. Everything ached with the awful post-orgasmic pleasure that made him want to claw his own skin off, get rid of every trace of an unwanted bliss that had been torn out of him, against his will and out of his control. It made him sick, knowing,
He'd certainly never cared before that their hands were too small, their hair too long, their voices too high and their eyes not blue enough.
"Tell me if I hurt you", the angel whispers before he carefully starts to move and Dean's eyes flutter shut. It's slow and gentle and agonizingly tender, and Dean has been with a lot of people in his life, he's fucked with a lot of people in his life, even slow and tender, but not like this. He knows this is a damn cliché, and it's chick-flicky times three, and he sounds corny as shit but the only appropriate term that comes to his mind about what they're doing is making love.
"And I...I hate that I can't-"
"Hello, Dean."
Not that he could care about that right now. With Cas warm and safe and beautiful in his arms. With Cas' tongue soft and careful and
of watching Cas walk away from him.
Want and need, passion and love, desperation and tenderness. It was all there inside of Dean when it came to Cas, mixing and meddling, the nearly overpowering desire to care for and to be taken care of.
Poor angel had to be super uncomfortable. No wonder. That guy was practically all over him, and Cas being his innocent, oblivious self wouldn't know how to handle such advances, if he was even aware of their intention at all. Who knew what filthy thoughts were running through that guy's head, Dean could just imagine the nice,
. He's a fucking angel. And though most angels are douchebags - They. Are. Fucking.
And something that is just
Cas sighs and leans back against the back of his chair, shoulders slightly slumped and eyes lowered to his feet, and Dean feels the soft smile being wiped from his lips at the sight.
, in all the years they'd known each other, after all they'd been through, Cas had never been told by anyone that they loved him. Not once. Cas had sacrificed everything for them, and he had never heard how loved he was.
Cas who did give him that sense of connection he'd always missed, Cas who woke feelings in Dean that could only intensify the physical sensation, Cas who didn't know what sex was really about, how it could be, what it could mean...
"You sure?" Dean clutches at the fabric of the coat around his shoulders. Cas nods. He can feel it getting stronger and it's barely five minutes later that they can hear a faint whimper over the beat of the rain.
"Oh..." Cas broke their kiss on a moan when Dean crooked his finger just right, nails digging into Dean's scalp, pulling at the strands of his hair just enough to make him groan.
"Some people actually enjoy reading, Dean."
Dean chuckled.
~oOo~
Dean. So caring. So considerate.
Okay, after I got this off my chest...*wipes tears away*
. Dean could never know. Cas hated himself for staying silent, for being so selfish to leave Dean in the dark, guilty and ashamed, just so Cas could keep him and his friendship.
"We just finished yesterday", he points out, the hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth that makes Dean press his lips together to keep a grin from his face.
"C-Cas-"
"Are you...are you happy here, Cas? With us?", Dean asked him suddenly, and Cas found he had to order his thoughts to follow. "I mean...maybe you don't wanna talk about it. I get that. But...y'know. Losing your wings, leaving Heaven...I can't help but ask myself if..." Dean paused, looked at him a little helplessly. "If you're missing something."
But he'd already gotten so used to it. They had been living together like this for months, for God's sake, he couldn't even remember how he'd ever been able to fall asleep without Cas' warm presence in his back, his weight dipping down the mattress, the sound of his peaceful breathing.
"As long as you need, Dean. I'm not going anywhere."
"I'm gonna let you try on your own now, yeah?" He loosened his hold on Cas' hand, letting go completely when Cas didn't object, let it rest on his chest while Dean placed his own beside him on the mattress.
Dean smiled back.
He pressed a kiss to Cas' lips, loved how Cas instantly opened up to him, groaning into his mouth and clenching his hands where they were holding onto Dean's shoulders.
"No."
Dean has lifted his head, his eyes mirroring the nervous, questioning tone of his voice, and Cas feels a soft smile form on his lips.
he has for that angel who directs his own puppy eyes at him.
But that didn't make sense. Cas had been fine. Everything had been perfectly fine until...
. Wishful thinking.
"Of course, Dean."
"How do you even begin these sort of things?"
"You..." Dean pressed his lips together, willed his voice to stop shaking. "You mean you...you wanted him to...to-?"
, exactly. Just the one. The one that actually deserves to be called an angel at all, the one that holds all the beautiful things one's told about his kind and their goodness.
Loving Dean had been the first choice he'd made as a free man. Loving at all was a choice that Dean had taught him about, that Dean had opened and made possible.
"What about you?", he slurred, voice already heavy with exhaustion.
Silence spreads between them, still a bit awkward, but different from the heavy tension of the last weeks. This is a shared silence, one that's not forced on the other, but rather partaken in, in mutual agreement. Because sometimes, an understanding silence is better than a bunch of meaningless words. (There is an intimacy about being understood like this, but he doesn't want to think about that too closely right now. Not when he's just made some progress.)
"Because I couldn't stand to see the hurt", he manages to press out, "and...and the
Dean's thoughts were running away from him, the angel's words ringing in his ears, mixing with the pounding of his own heart, the rushing of his blood.
"What? What is it?"
"You know..." Cas shifted, forearms resting on Dean's chest so he could look at Dean's face. "What I found is that...you can't wait until life isn't hard anymore before you decide to be happy", Cas said thoughtfully. "It will always be hard. And that's fine. Yes, our road has been bumpy and twisted and broken but..it still led us here."
Anyway, don't wanna give away too much, hope you enjoy it!!
~oOo~
"Mhm. Do that-" Cas pulled him up for a sloppy kiss, eyes closed. "Dean, do that again..."
what the hell-
~oOo~
(See the end of the chapter for
Fuck. Fuck, fuck,
recently and neither of you said as much as two words about what happened", he continues mercilessly, his voice soft, yet strained with held back frustration, "and instead you keep acting weird around each other? Well,
But Cas would need him to be calm and steady right now. So he could pull himself together. He
Well. Not letting any feelings get involved had officially been a huge failure on Dean's part, that was for sure. His mind had started to plague him at night, thoughts he'd managed to quieten for a while coming back to hit him with full force when he thought back to the things he'd done to Cas, things Cas allowed him to do. Not that he could regret it. It had all been beyond amazing, filling him with conflicting feelings of rightness and shame.
Anyway, I'm not happy that I'm taking so long for these last few chapters (I'll probably go for 3 more after this) but I'm not forcing myself to write either, don't worry. If I write I do it because I feel like it and it makes me happy, just wanted to say that so you're not concerned I'm having more stress bc I don't wanna leave you guys hanging or anything!💙
The only thing wrong had been what had been done to both of them. The only thing wrong had been what they'd had to go through.
"Just- I just need a moment to calm down, yeah?"
"You promise to tell me if-"
The day is there and he still hasn't decided on the words.
those desperate features said.
Cas couldn't get enough.
For today I wanted to post so I could give you guys a little something to soothe your hearts and minds after the con this weekend so...hope you enjoy!
The words sent a hot surge of pain and guilt through Dean's body, but he drowned it out. It didn't matter. There was nothing to do about it now. All that mattered was the present. He couldn't change where they came from, but he could choose where they went from there.
that song,
"I'm sure I'll find something to occupy myself."
He trailed off. It had been a dream. It had always been nothing but a dream.
(See the end of the chapter for
"My angel...", he hears himself say, an adventurous finger dares to sweep over Cas' jawline and to his bottom lip. When Cas catches his hand to kiss the fingertip, Dean thinks he might actually explode. (Or maybe faint, fuck the chick-flicking. People in actual
He'd been on his way home from a supply run when he saw the glowing sign of an open bar. He'd gone in there with the intention to pick up some chick, have a round of quick, impersonal, dirty sex and get his mind off the fact that that was something he didn't want anymore. Maybe he could prove himself wrong, he'd told himself. He hadn't even made it to first base.
"Cas? Sweetheart, open your eyes", Dean asked, "Please, look at me." And the worry in his voice urged Cas to follow, relieved to find the stinging in his eyes gone once they opened to meet Dean's.
"Hey, you stop
Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, practice had turned into reality, and Cas slowly adapted to the thought that maybe this bubble of happiness he'd found himself in lately wouldn't just burst at any moment. Not this time. Perhaps he could actually relax and enjoy this life they were making for themselves.
"Oh, and Cas?"
But that wasn't even what really made him pause.
"I don't want to fix you, Dean. I want you to understand that there's nothing that needs fixing."
Cas basically drags Dean forward, following the direction he had pointed him to as well as the path his grace lays out for him.
"Y-Yeah", he croaks out, mentally slaps himself out of this pathetic shock. He'd known. This doesn't come as a surprise. It shouldn't come as a surprise. "I- good. Yeah, sure."
Cas is sitting on his bed reading
He was. He
"Mhm."
We live our lives having these fictitious ideas of what we think other people will accept. Our parents function as ideals to an unknowing and malleable youth, naive and begging to be influenced. When people approve of something, we watch, learn and try to copy that behaviour, that personality, even. When they respect us, when we're given their validation, we feel secure. We end up barricaded behind masks, honing our act. But if we're not careful over time, that person down underneath the social training becomes unrecognizable, lost. Our act becomes the truth. And the truth becomes some residual of the person we were before we learned how to fit in, how to disappear in the mass, how to please everyone but ourselves.
Dean's voice sounds casual, but Cas thinks to notice how he relaxes slightly, smiles to himself, small and silent, while his gaze glides over the lake. He takes the liberty to believe it's because Dean's actually happy to have him around.
But Cas broke him of, hurriedly shaking his head.
"Shh." Dean kissed his forehead, cut him off when he heard Cas' choked voice. "Don't worry anymore, ok? You have all the time in the world and you can go as slow and as far as you want, at any time. I'll always be here, Cas. Always."
"No!" The knot in his stomach loosened as Cas' eyes snapped back to his, wide with shock, and Dean could breathe again. "Absolutely not", Cas assured him, pressing his lips together. "I just thought...despite the things you said, and I don't doubt that you meant them, Dean, I don't. But I know you." He gave Dean a smile, understanding but with a hint of sadness. "I know this isn't easy for you. And I wouldn't have blamed you. In front of your brother, you know. In front of the world."
"You're right." Cas pulls a face. "I could taste it in your mouth. It
~oOo~
"I don't understand. How would a tie at the-" He trails off, thinking. "Oh, I see", he says after a moment, just a hint of pride in his voice. "It's
So he followed, let his movements become a little more bold, a little more purposeful, massaging the ring of muscle until he could feel it relaxing under his fingertips, opening to his touch.
Dean swallowed hard, released a long breath.
He groans into the pillow and turns to lie on his back. Oh, fuck it.
Dean looks searchingly at Cas, but the angel seems as lost for words as he is himself. "Jack, no", he finally gets out, watching how the kid considers his words for a moment before he nods.
"I'd love that."
And what a fucking joke that was. Lucifer, using Cas' form to sneak into Dean. And on top of that Dean had provided him with the way to do it, had unknowingly exposed his deepest desires just so that son of a bitch could take it and twist it to use and hurt Cas. Knowing that if Dean's secret had been impossible before, it certainly would be after he was done with them...
"Y-Yes...it's...strange", Cas said, "but it doesn't hurt."
"Oh." The angel's blush deepened. "Ah...good. That's..."
Cas' fingers tightened around Dean's, and he was grateful, clinging to Cas' touch like it was the only thing keeping him from being swept away by the wave of emotion that had overcome him listening to Cas' words.
"I don't need to explain my reasons to you", the angel finally said, but Dean knew there had been more sitting at the tip of his tongue, something he'd swallowed down the same way Dean used to swallow all his own truths.
Cas hated it.
Cas presses a light kiss to his shoulder.
He could feel Dean's arms tightening slightly around him, and he couldn't help but imagine that Dean's subconscience wanted to keep him in place, to hold him there, protect him from the prospect of having to leave once again.
(Fuck his voice for cracking on the name,
They were here. They'd actually done it.
"It's okay, Dean." Cas' words are too understanding, his voice too soft, his gentle smile misplaced. "You don't have to say it."
He guessed that this is just what Dean feels like to him.
"Suit yourself."
would die.
This is something else entirely. And it's perfect too.
"Really?"
He held Dean's gaze as he looked at him, his brow furrowing despite the smile on his lips.
1. He feels right
-what I'd...thought and I...I'd like-"
"You have me", he whispers. "Cas, I-"
"I'd like you in any form, Cas", he said truthfully. "No matter how you look, you'd still...be Cas."
Sam huffs, but she's pleased to note that he can't hide the smile. "If you say so."
I'm gonna be honest with you, I've been sitting on this for some time so I hands down don't know anymore what's written in this chapter bc I wanted to wait til I've written more but turns out I need a deadline to keep myself at it so here we go and create one. Was this betaed? Ask me something I remember. Just in case - thanks my beta angels, you know who you are.
Cas' face is completely serious, and Dean stares at him for a second, then bursts out laughing, earning him another confused frown, and of course, the adorable signature head-tilt.
Dean didn't need to be asked twice. They came together in the middle, Cas meeting him halfway, and Dean cautiously started to move his lips a bit more against the angel's, delighted when he felt Cas respond. He was hesitant and clearly unpracticed, but the longer the kiss lasted, the more Dean could feel him melting into the contact, his body relaxing, the tension seeping out of his shoulders. Neither tried to deepen the kiss, content with just letting their lips press together, finding a rhythm, getting in sync. And no, there were no fireworks, but the deep feeling of calm and peace that settled in his chest upon having Cas release a sigh of contentment against his lips was better than anything he could have wished for. He dared to bring his hands up to tenderly frame Cas' face, tilting his head slightly so they could slot their mouths even more tightly together. Cas let him, curling fingers into Dean's shirt to pull im closer.
The words drove like splinters into Dean's chest.
The angel stops in his tracks and turns back towards him.
"Cas..." Dean swallows around the sudden lump in his throat, his voice leaving him completely when soft blue eyes find his own.
. Dean had to open his eyes, had to see it, and there it was, blinding him with its brilliance.
"Why would I want that?"
"Lemme just grab that real quick", Dean says, loosening the tie around Cas' neck, and Cas just lets him, too busy staring at Dean to speak because he's
Dean had barely finished the thought when he felt Cas moving, tugging on his sleeves to shrug his flannel off. Dean froze for a moment. Was he still caught in his fantasy? But no, he'd broken the kiss, had opened his eyes, looked back into deep blue, and the angel in front of him was real, was still about to divest Dean of his outer layer.
"C-Cas." His voice sounds a bit sore, his tongue stumbling over the name he has to press out. "Cas, wait."
But then, if he thought about it...it made sense. It didn't need romantic love to be emotionally involved. They were friends. Best friends, even. Maybe it was just that.
Sammy and Eileen are on a date this evening, which they had announced with smiles on their faces. And as Dean had been out for several purchases they had to make, Sammy had said they'd take Miracle. Meaning Dean would get to be alone with Cas. A few days ago, that prospect would have twisted his stomach, but now that they're on friendly terms again, he's really looking forward to it. Not that his stomach is calm, but the fluttering is one of nervous excitement rather than dread.
Cas' brow wrinkled with worry as he watched how Dean reached out, gently trailed a finger over his collarbone.
His name between a groan and a whimper. Cas would never tire of it.
"You there with me?", Dean asked just then, and Cas nodded, kissed Dean again because he simply
He doesn't answer. He can't lie to Cas. He can't tell him the truth either, so he says nothing.
"Really." He could hear the little smile in Dean's voice. "Mmm. If you liked that I think I have an even better one."
"Dean, what's wrong, man?"
"Dean." The name is like honey. Sweet and golden and dripping with affection. Dean almost can't stand it. He's tempted to close his eyes again, overwhelmed, but he can't. He's captured by something in Cas' gaze, a calm blue ocean sparkling in the sunlight.
He revelled at the flushed skin, the line of his stretched neck when he threw his head back, the arch of his fingers fisting in the sheets, the moans falling from his lips, and all the while he never ceased to praise Cas, telling him how well he was doing, how good it felt, murmured confessions into his skin and breathed pleas for more into his mouth.
"What?"
"Dean." Cas reached out and took Dean's hand, entwining their fingers, making sure he captured Dean's undivided attention. "I told you, it wasn't your fault. You've been used too. You're allowed to be hurting. Just because you're helping me heal doesn't mean you need to be fine."
And the best of all, Dean had not moved out of his room. On the contrary, he'd permanently moved all of his stuff there, gradually, just leaving things there as if Cas wouldn't notice it that way, as if Cas would ever have said no if he asked. But Cas didn't comment on it when he spotted another one of Dean's books residing on his shelf, another one of his flannels next to Cas' shirts in the drawer. He just let it happen, enjoyed the warm pulsing in his chest every time he found something new, even let Dean buy a new memory foam mattress for his bed -because it was
He barely has time to order his sheets and wipe the moisture from his brow when the door's practically ripped open. There's no light streaming in from the corridor and the figure standing in the doorway is just a blurry shadow before the door falls shut again.
"Nono." Dean shook his head. Of course Cas would be concerned about him again. If he only knew how much Dean was on board with literally anything-
Cas nods as if he knows. He doesn't know shit. He has no fucking idea.
He'd left with Dean, had followed him outside, had slid into the Impala's passenger seat, and he'd sat through the drive in silence as the road flew by, taking them home.
He let his hand carefully creep up towards Cas' crotch again, watching his reaction, how his breathing picked up and his hands tightened in the sheets, but he didn't tense again, so Dean dared to lightly press his palm against the bulge in his black boxers, eliciting a groan from the angel. Encouraged by his reaction, he slowly began to stroke up and down, long smooth movements, gradually increasing the pressure, finding out what would draw the sweetest sounds out of Cas.
"What?" Dean lifts an eyebrow, but Sam just smiles.
"So...do you want me to do it?", he asked slowly, carefully. "The oil thing?"
, Dean thought. This was Castiel, wanting him.
"Of course." Cas slightly shook his head about Dean even having to ask such a question. "I'd want you to", he assured him truthfully, eyes skipping between Dean's flushed face and his hand.
His hand hesitantly trailed down Dean's side, over his hip, traced his hipbone just shy from wandering lower, the implication igniting a fire in Dean's whole body.
that coat,
"Shit, sorry. I didn't mean to talk about that. It's just that..."
