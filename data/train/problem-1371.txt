- But you go first. John didn’t fight him about that. He didn’t like the idea of telling Sherlock about his feelings the last couple of days but he knew when he was beaten. If Sherlock said please there was no way he was letting this go.
Mr Holmes, he said unlocking his door and holding it open for Sherlock. Sherlock put his phone in his pocket and walked in, sitting down as usual.
“Sherlock I didn’t mean…” John’s voice trailed off. He abandoned his attempts to hold Sherlock’s hand and put it on Sherlock’s knee instead. It felt like it burned through the fabric like it wasn’t there.
- Coping? Is it that hard loving me? John tried to make his question into a joke but failed. He could see anger flare up in Sherlock’s eyes.
- You mean if he needed the money to run away with his lover? Sherlock couldn’t hide a bit of distaste at the word lover.
You stopped before I passed out right? Said Sherlock, John looked perplexed at him. Like that made it all better.
“You kept count? John sounded surprised. Sherlock wanted to turn around to look at him but John started pulling out bandages and started to put them on Sherlock’s back so he stayed put. And it was easier to talk when he didn’t have to look at John. It almost felt like all the fantasies he had since he jumped off Bart's. He had talked to John in his head every day.
I told you, Mycroft is worried I’ll start using if I get bored. Sherlock said this with such ease. John would have thought he would be a bit embarrassed about this fact.
“Okay” Sherlock said slowly. He had a hard time jumping between feelings the way John did. He was still stuck at fantasising about John naked.
I guess you’re not supposed to date students but it seemed like your Mr Holmes’ older brother could see to that if it would pose a problem. He had saved his brother before.
How did you know i served? He asked, realizing at once he had answered Sherlock’s question without meaning to. Sherlock’s smile widened. He straightened up and strode into John’s room, sitting down in the chair opposite the desk.
“I thought you would be at Baker street” This was harder to admit. The discrepancy between his imagination and reality made him feel foolish. John stopped pouring, but down the bottle and faced him. He looked angry but the expression fell as he saw Sherlock.
"I was still wondering, um… If I can spend some extra time in the practice-lab? I think it would help."
“I had to feel it for myself. I knew as soon as your feet left the ceiling that you would die. But I thought that if someone could survive that fall it could be you. You could have produced a miracle in some way. They didn’t want to let me touch you but I had to see it for myself. And it was gone, you didn’t have a pulse, you were dead.” John stopped talking, his breathing ragged. Sherlock suspected that he fought not to cry.
Then you’re more stupid than I thought, he said before the silence could stretch. Sherlock draw in a deep breath.
I think you still want to be with me, and I want to be with you. The only issue is this notion of yours that I’m not safe. But I say I am. I have several inches on you, I train in martial arts. If you try to hurt me again I can defend myself.
Yes, I was just passing the time. Sherlock took the violin and put it back in his case. He turned around and looked at John. There was a brief moment when none of them spoke.
“YOU COULD HAVE DIED. I RISKED MY LIFE FOR YOU, YOU UNGRATEFUL…” words failed him there. He wasn’t one for swearing but nothing else seemed to cut it. John walked up to Sherlock and shoved him hard in the chest. But Sherlock stood his ground this time.
"No, no, there’s nothing you can do there. I just need to practice more." John felt for the man. He wasn’t supposed to but he took out his card that gave him access throughout the school. And handed it to Mr Holmes.
John called in sick the next day, spending most of the day in his bed. He called his therapeut and got an emergency-meeting in the afternoon. But the next day when he walked into the lecture hall he wasn’t sure that had helped him at all. He started to sweat when Sherlock walked into the hall. He didn’t have any outward signs of John’s attack. Though John, more than anyone, knew that the deepest cuts didn’t show. He sat in the front row as usual. John could feel his eyes following him round as he walked addressing the whole body of students. He could not make himself look at Sherlock. He thought he would break if he looked at him. Was Sherlock angry, scared? Did he pity Sherlock? Saw him as an old, broken soldier? Sherlock expected perfection in himself, he would never be with anyone that was broken like John. John didn’t want Sherlock to want to be with him either. He could not risk hurting Sherlock. He had to unpack his bag to find his phone at the end of the lecture and didn’t realise Sherlock had stayed behind until he spoke.
I’m sorry John, I should have known, Sherlock said in a low voice. John shook his head. This was not Sherlock fault, could never be Sherlock’s fault. This was all on him. He had put Sherlock in harm's way.
“What did I do?” John asked quickly, then he understood the full implications of Sherlock’s word. Sherlock could see it dawning in his eyes.
"Well, your results are great so I don’t think you need to worry." John spoke calmly, trying to catch the man’s eyes.
"I’m going to expel him of course, stealing is seen as an grave offence." Mr Holmes nodded and rose from his chair.
“Sure.” He followed John into the kitchen. He stopped in the doorway and waited for John to give him his glas. He didn’t feel like sitting down at the table. He didn’t want a solid object between him and John if he would like to continue with the kissing. And if they sat at a table facing each other, he would have to look at John. He didn’t want to do that saying what he had to say right now. But John seemed to have one of those moments when he could read Sherlock’s mind since he leaned against the wall next to Sherlock and sipped his drink. He was so close that Sherlock could reach out and touch him but Sherlock didn’t have to meet his eyes.
I won’t kick you out, your brother saw to that, John said dryly. He could see Sherlock straightening up at once.
"The only thing different yesterday from other days was that your keycard was used accessing the morgue. Why were you there?"
- The thing that bothers me the most is why you would steal something that is so hard to sell. You need to have a buyer ready; otherwise the theft could be for nothing. And then there is the money. I went to a collector and asked about the stamp. If you put that amount of money into a British account the bank would want papers as to where the money came from. So you need to set up an offshore account that’s not directly connected to you. It’s not as hard as it might sound but still, it takes some work. So we have a thief who plans ahead, who is connected, what else? What am I missing? John didn’t bother answering; he knew Sherlock wasn’t expecting it. He felt himself relaxing, sleep creeping up on him.
- Yes, I was thinking we could go to that new Italian place down the street? Sherlock still looked at him like he was talking a foreign language and John was beginning to regret his question.
John thanked her and started climbing the stairs. He could hear classical music from the apartment above. He knocked on the door and the music stopped. Sherlock opened a door dressed in a purple shirt that was ridiculously tight over his chest. It made John’s mouth water.
“You have no right coming in here after two years making demands.” Sherlock wanted to contradict John, tell him he hadn’t been gone for two years. He had made it back before the two year mark.
I haven’t found anyone I wanted to kiss before. It seemed like a waste of time. John tried to take this in and decide what it meant. He decided not to make a big deal out of it, following Sherlock’s lead.
No, of course not, I understand. I just… I thought you could stay. Sherlock’s eyes softened. He walked upto John, placed on of his hands on John’s cheek and pulled him close to kiss him. John leaned his head back, wanting as much of a kiss as Sherlock would give him. He places his hands lightly of Sherlock’s hips, careful not to pull him.
You know why, John felt a bit annoyed. It wasn’t like Sherlock hadn’t been present when John attached him. He knew perfectly well why.
- Who is the other woman in the photo? Any relation? Sherlock was holding a picture showing a much younger Mrs Gordon standing next to her father, on the other side of Mr Bryce was another woman approximately the same age as Mrs Gordon. Mr Bryce was holding a stamp in an album and they were all smiling.
“Why would I? It hadn’t made a difference.” Sherlock succumbed to his knees weakness and sat down in his armchair. He had to grip the sides so he didn’t just stand up and walk away.
- We have to go through the security footage first thing in the morning John, se if anything feels odd. John murmured an answer, then he fell asleep while Sherlock’s voice washed over him like one of those tapes with ocean sounds.
“What? What had you done if you knew about my feelings? What difference had it made? Except for you moving out, leaving me?” He had to work for it bur Sherlock’s voice was still leveled, his words were cool and crisp. Every syllable audible. He felt a bit of pride that he let so little of his inner turmoil show. He could see it infuriated John. He was so easy to rile up.
- We have an appointment with the branch manager. And I want to see the perimeter as well. The taxi slowed to a stop and they both got out. They were standing in front of a bank office that looked like every other bank office John had been to. There were large glass windows full of posters urging people to borrow money to follow their dreams, and to save so that their children can follow their dreams. As they walked in they were greeted by the man John had seen with Sherlock just a few hours earlier. He had changed his tie but otherwise looked just as rumpled as before.
“Yes, it’s... good.” To prove his statement he leaned forward to kiss John. John’s hand returned to his cheek, holding him in place. Sherlock felt like he grounded him when the room seemed to be spinning. That he could do this, that he wanted to do this made his head spin. He licked John’s bottom lip and got a satisfied humming as a response and John opened his mouth. Sherlock took a deep breath as John started to play with the curls in his neck. Surely it wasn’t supposed to make him aroused, such a small thing. He tried to reaproach and was rewarded with a groan from John. And suddenly he was kissing Sherlock with more urgency. They had both moved forward in their chairs, now their knees were touching. Still, it wasn’t enough for Sherlock, John seemed to be seated too far away for comfort. He solved the problem by clambering onto John’s lap. It made them both gasp as his own erection brushed against John’s. Sherlock didn’t stop to think about what that meant. Instead he caught John’s mouth again. It had no right feeling this good, especially since he could have been doing this for years without realising he wanted to. John broke off the kiss.
- This is Mr Bryce, his wife, his sister Mrs Gordon and her husband. Mr Jackson pointed out the person attached to the name.
“Since maybe three months into our friendship. It would have been sooner if I had been better at detecting feelings.”
"And you are…?" The stranger smiled a little smile that reminded John of someone. He couldn’t figure out who.
- Are you still angry? he asked. John shocks his head, and then realised Sherlock couldn’t see him in the dark room.
John was walking to his office a monday afternoon when he saw his mysterious student standing waiting for him. He was even taller than John had thought, he towered a good five inches above John. He looked nervous, shifting his footing every other second. He quickly eyes John before diverting his eyes. His hand that took John’s was sweaty but he hold on a moment to long, glancing down at John as he did.
“Will we ever be okay?” John opened his mouth to answer and then shut it again. Seeming to ponder the question.
“Kissing?” He answered but it sounded like a question. John smiled so the answer can’t have been that wrong. He leaned in for another kiss but John put his hand up between them to stop him. Without thinking, Sherlock licked one of his fingers. He was curious how they tasted and felt. He wanted to know everything about John that he didn’t already know. It made John groan and close his eyes. He didn’t remove his hand though, Sherlock took that as encouragement. He kissed the palm of John’s hand, hearing John’s breathing hitch. He tried to lick the place he had kissed. Then doing the same with all of John’s fingers.
- Hey, where are you going? John rose aswell, but walked around the sofa. Sherlock was putting his coat on, he stopped for a second.
- Goodbye then, Mr Holmes, John was grateful that Sherlock was bad at reading emotions. Otherwise we would have seen John’s heart breaking. Instead he looked irritated and walked off without a word. John walked to his office, feeling more miserable than he had done in years.
Yes, Sherlock said simply. John looked at him, trying to get him to elaborate but he wouldn’t budge.
- It there anything else we need to know? Mr Jackson started to shake his head but Mr Bryce spoke up.
Do you wanna see some more? Sherlock asked. It was only then John understood what Sherlock was saying. He was asking John to come along. He wanted John to come with him to the crimescene. It would mean seeing another horrible death. It would be a risk, maybe it would trigger his ptsd again. Even though there was many reasons for him to say no (One of them being that if he said no, they might stay in the apartment and snog for the rest of the evening), there was no hesitation when he answered.
- I need you to tell me what made you upset the other night. He opened his eyes when John didn’t answer.
I knew about your PTSD and still put you in a situation that could trigger it. I should have realised being trapped by a much larger man could be frightening. John looked at Sherlock in disbelief,
- A whole evening wasted listening to people gossip. I can only see one or two who even had the mental capacity to pull off a theft like this. Sherlock started ticking things of his fingers.
- We’ll be in touch, he said and once again strode to the door. John felt finished with following Sherlock blind.
“I love you.” he said. Looking like he had just made a high jump. Sherlock felt relieved, he knew what to say to this.
Of course I am, John looked up at Sherlock. Part of him wanted to say that he was not serious, that all he wanted was to be with Sherlock. But that wasn’t an option as long as he could hurt Sherlock. Sherlock scrutinized him.
- You didn’t ask yesterday if we were going on another date. I wonder if that means that you don’t want to date me anymore. Sherlock spoke matter of factly.
- Something is bothering you. You started acting strange after I asked if I could kiss you. Sherlock spoke matter of factly but John knew he couldn’t reply in the same manner. Maybe he was overreacting but he felt entitled to, the way Sherlock treated him sometimes.
Sherlock noticed John’s grimace and got up, ignoring John’s grumble of displeasure. He grabbed a cold compress and brought it back to the sofa as quickly as possible. “Even if I’m supposed to be taking care of myself as well, I can still look after you,” he said to John’s raised eyebrow. “You were just
“Never have I ever pretended to be in a relationship with someone.” That one came from John, and he seemed to be trying to tease Sherlock in order to get him to relax a bit. It actually started to work.
John laughed and tried not to stare too hard. Sherlock was wearing dark fitted jeans and an equally fitted charcoal shirt. His hair fell in loose curls over his forehead. His eyes were piercing and blue-green-grey. His lips were plush and delectable. He was even more beautiful up close, and John was surprised that Sherlock didn’t post a million pictures of himself online every day just for the sake of appeasing the public.
Sherlock curled in on himself even further and resolutely continued to sulk. He had a feeling that the effect was somewhat undercut by the fact that his pyjama bottoms had cartoon bees on them, but he tried to make up for that with projected aggression.
Sherlock frowned. “What are you doing here?” he asked, which, as greetings went, was not exactly stellar.
Again, might be a little while for the next chapter to be up, but it'll be very long and full of John/Sherlock with one another in person, so it'll be worth it!
“So, I spoke to your brother again,” he said. “Yes, I know he’s your brother now. He’s living as a human man in London, right?”
“You’re pushy once you get going,” John teased, although he let himself be led toward Sherlock’s room.
By the time two o’clock had rolled around, Sherlock had changed three times and had restyled his hair seven times.  He was as bad as Molly was (she had once made him sit around for two hours while she tried on every outfit she owned before going on a date), and he couldn’t even bring himself to care.
“Oh, baby,” the man said, and then he was standing, walking over to Sherlock’s side. “I think you’ve had a bit too much to drink. Let’s get you home.”
Although that was hardly a stern command, Sherlock found himself obeying almost automatically, which might have been troubling had he not been growing increasingly aroused at each passing moment. He stripped off the t-shirt and pyjama bottoms John had apparently dressed him in while he’d been unconscious and tossed them off the side of the bed.
John furrowed his brow at Sherlock’s expression. “Are you feeling all right? You look a little flushed.” He pressed the back of one hand against Sherlock’s forehead and seemed satisfied that he didn’t have a fever. He seemed to realise, then, that there might be another cause for the pinkness in Sherlock’s cheeks. He smirked and began needlessly wiping soot out of Sherlock’s hair, which did nothing to help him keep his face a normal colour. “When I heard that voice of yours for the first time,” John said, “I knew your body had to be amazing as well, but I have to say, you’ve exceeded my expectations.”
Sherlock’s jaw clenched at that, which John assumed meant he really didn’t want to be near any members of the rugby team. “It’s no problem,” he said, and his words were stiff, losing the easy flow of their earlier conversation. And then, to John’s surprise, he stood up and started gathering his things. He put his coat on and shoved his phone in his pocket.
Sherlock hadn’t realised that he’d been frozen in that spot until John was beckoning him over. He tried to walk as calmly as possible to where John was, concentrating hard on keeping his steps straight and even. When he was close enough, John pulled him in, using one hand to brush over Sherlock’s forehead, his cheek, his neck, as if checking for injury.
John pulled back, having to practically force himself to do so. “You’re sure about this?” he asked, hating the thought that he was pressuring Sherlock into this.
The man smirked, and he reached one hand up to brush back some of Sherlock’s hair in a move that was entirely unwanted. “You’re going to be so much fun, aren’t you, baby?”
“It’s just a bit shocking, is all,” John said once he regained control of himself. He didn’t bother trying not to stare.
“I happen to like your hand where it is,” John said with a coy smile. “Besides, I like seeing you all marked up like this.  It’s a
“In the Downing case,” Sherlock said as his call was answered, “check to see if the brother has a green ladder.  If he does, then he’s the killer.”
“Never have I ever used that ridiculous fake-stretching move to get my arm around someone,” Sherlock said, this time prompting John to drink.
As Sherlock studied John, John seemed to be drinking him in as well. Eventually, John met his gaze and licked his lips. Sherlock very much wanted to kiss him. “Shall we?” John said, and he held out one arm, bent at the elbow in a gentlemanly fashion.
Sherlock whimpered again, his movements speeding up. John wanted to see him so badly, wanted to expose them both to one another, but he didn’t want to derail their current momentum. Another time, he told himself. Another time they could try this unclothed, and, oh, maybe Sherlock would want to ride him, and he could have this new fantasy acted out.
John supposed that was a decent point. As far as he could tell, Sherlock’s teeth appeared similar to his own, and Sherlock’s abdomen was shaped in such a way as to indicate near-human digestion. “For all I know, you could just be imitating the way humans look in general,” he pointed out. Sherlock was, after all, still maintaining that pale skin tone that was entirely different than the one they had had at the beginning.
“I definitely like you better without the oxygen mask on,” John said with a pleasant smile as he reached the ambulance. Sherlock wasn’t sure how to respond to that, and any hopes of coming up with the right words were eliminated as John reached out to stroke his fingers against Sherlock’s cheek. “I think I’d like you even better without all this ash.” John lifted his hand to show that his fingertips had come away from Sherlock’s skin covered in a thin layer of grey dust.
, he thought as he binned a few old experiments as well, although that wasn’t quite true. He had always made an effort to impress others upon first meeting them, but he rarely attempted to keep up that effort after knowing them for any length of time, usually because people generally had formed negative opinions of him by that point. John was different. John
Throughout all of that, Sherlock had been able to maintain the outward appearance of calmness. It was only when their shared cab pulled up outside his flat that he began to lose his grip on that nonchalant mask.
Sherlock stood up abruptly, finished off the rest of his drink, and stormed off to the toilets. He needed a moment to himself. He needed to think. Once in the toilets, he stood braced over a sink, looking at himself in the mirror. He needed to pull himself together, or he was going to end up ruining this entire evening for John.
“You’re trying to mimic me,” John said in awe, resisting the urge to reach out and touch that changeable skin. Like that, they looked almost entirely human, save for the antennae, and John didn’t feel half as bad as he had before for finding them attractive (though, to be honest, he hadn’t felt very bad about it at all to begin with). “Incredible,” he breathed, and the alien seemed to know that they were being complimented judging by the way their cheeks glowed green right then.
All the same, John put his hand on Sherlock’s arm to get their attention and said, “Why don’t we head back to the main house?”
Sherlock hummed in reply and rolled over so that he could rest his head on John’s shoulder. He flung a leg and an arm over John’s body. “Going to miss that,” he admitted, keeping his face buried in the crook of John’s neck.
That one moment had sparked a series of events that included—among other things—John coming over to Sherlock with a full pint in his hand and telling him that it was a shame for him not to have a drink; Sherlock forcing himself to drink beer even though he far preferred wine or any other, tastier alcohol; Sherlock deducing John’s entire family history and status among his friends; John and Sherlock not looking up from one another to the point where John’s friends left without him because they apparently couldn’t get his attention; and finally, John boldly asking him if he wanted to take this somewhere else.
John’s hands were suddenly pulling at his thighs, and he broke away long enough to mutter a gruff, “Up.” Sherlock had barely processed what was being requested of him before John hoisted him up, hands firmly under Sherlock’s arse as the lanky man’s legs came up to wrap around John’s waist. Sherlock moaned, feeling his cock begin to fill out, unreasonably aroused by John’s strength.
[5:04PM] You’re not reassuring me that you won’t end up in bed with one of your friends over there. SH
Sherlock snatched the book from off its shelf and began making his way back toward the check-out desk, passing through a cluster of small tables to do so.
. He held his hands out to his sides and spun around to give John the full effect. He was wearing a navy suit with a simple white shirt underneath, and although he knew he looked presentable, he wasn’t sure how well this look would fit in with the rest of their companions at the pub.
The signs were all there.  John’s impeccable appearance, her obvious comfort with him, the way they looked at one another.  They were dating, Sherlock concluded, and he really felt like he was going to retch. God, he had been so foolish. How had he let himself believe that John Watson might actually be interested in
Oh, come on.  Will you at least let me know when he comes back next time?  I’d like to see this guy with my own two eyes.
John rolled his eyes. “Believe it or not, I don’t actually want to sleep in the same bed as you while you’re drugged out of your mind and haven’t given me consent beforehand.”
Sherlock dropped to their knees beside the patch of flowers, putting them at eye level with the bees. “I love them,” they said.
Sherlock felt the urge to defend John.  “He left a note for me.  He said he was running late for work and that he didn’t want to wake me.”
John tried to not imagine Sherlock mating with dozens of other members of their species just for the sake of increasing their reproductive success. There was no reason for him to be
John settled himself between Sherlock’s legs. He spread his hands down their back, coming to rest on their arse. Sherlock’s breathing hitched audibly. “Just relax, love,” he murmured. “If there’s anything you don’t like, just tell me.”
Murderers sometimes tries to hide their crimes with acid. It makes it extremely hard to pinpoint time of death.
You didn’t go to the practice lab yesterday, he said to a still standing Sherlock. He pursed his lips, like he was fighting a smile.
- It was clear from the cctv footage that Mr Bryce had done something special that last time he was in the bank. You could see him walk in with purpose, his stride long. He was calmer when he walked out. He had done what he set out to do: getting the stamp. Miss Williams nodded.
- You’re usually quite well with touchy feely stuff. He looked up from his phone but didn’t stop typing.
- Tell me why we want to spend more time in the presence of those people? They were so utterly boring. John just looked at Sherlock for a while before he sighed and continued.
I know, but I don’t know why. There is something about you, Sherlock said making John blush. He didn’t really know how to respond. Sherlock didn’t seem to expect a response either. He stood up and started walking to the door.
- I... I don’t know. I think I was disappointed but... he raised his voice a bit. He didn’t want to say things to Sherlock that got his hopes up.
- If you tell me what this is about maybe I can tell you something useful, he continued. He could hear Sherlock moving around in the bathroom.
- I hope you’re not allergic? I know I’m living up to the stereotype of a spinster with a cat. But it’s nice with some company. John smiled in response.
“Is this okay.” John asked quietly. Sherlock straightened up, a bit embarrassed by his obvious enjoyment of John’s touch. He had to clear his throat before he could answer.
“Oh fuck, Sherlock. What happened?” John took the other chair in the kitchen and sat down behind Sherlock. Sherlock could hear him rummaging in the box he had brought from the bathroom.
- Well, that’s not a very helpful answer, he snapped then disappearing into the living room. John stood for a moment looking puzzled at the empty doorway. Then he turned, looking at his failed attempt of tea. There was a teabag swimming in some milk, there was more milk on the countertop, he wasn’t even sure he put the kettle on.  With a big exhale, he put the cup in the sink, the milk in the fridge and went up to his bedroom. Now when he calmed down a bit he could admit that it wasn’t only the fact that Sherlock tried to kiss him (or tried to find out if John wanted Sherlock to kiss him? He wasn’t sure) that made him angry. It was also the fact that he didn’t follow through. That made John angry ‘because it made him scared. What was that about? He didn’t want Sherlock to kiss him. He wasn’t in love with Sherlock. Still, he couldn’t deny that he had felt disappointed when Sherlock had said it was just an act. He couldn’t either deny that Sherlock was an attractive man, John wasn’t blind. Maybe he just got caught up in the moment. Maybe it wasn’t Sherlock he had been attracted to; maybe it was just the moment itself? That thought comforted John. He put his pyjamas on, and then sneaked down to the bathroom. Sherlock was stretched out on the sofa, his eyes closed and hands clasp under his chin. John felt quite relieved he didn’t have to speak any more to Sherlock this evening. Back in bed, he tried to finish some more pages in his novel but his thoughts just strayed. He put down his book and had just put out the light when he heard footsteps in the stair. He laid motionless, listening to Sherlock slowly making his way towards John’s room. He seemed to hesitate outside John’s door. He could see Sherlock’s shadow in the crack between the door and the floor. After a few moments, there was a knock on the door then Sherlock popped his head in
It didn’t help John at all with his level of desire that was threatening to overcome him. But he sensed the logic in what Sherlock was doing. The man was so tall so he was now almost completely level with John. He leaned forward, feeling a bit unstable sitting at the edge of the chair, and kissed Sherlock again. It was even better the second time, Sherlock seemed to be a fast learner and the kiss quickly depend. John had his hands in Sherlock’s hair, pulling him closer. Sherlock’s hands roamed from his neck down to his bum. They only let go of the other ones lips for occasional gasps of air and John was feeling a bit lightheaded.  His only thought was to keep Sherlock close, he could not get close enough. Sherlock seemed to think the same because he pushed John even closer to him. Which made John lose his balance on his office chair and he fell forward. The chair rolled away behind him and John felt onto Sherlock. His quick reflexes made him catch himself before he crushed Sherlock. But he was still sitting on top of Sherlock with his hands on either side of his head, who had his legs bend beneath him in an odd angle. They looked at each other in surprise, and then they started to giggle. Sherlock moved to untangle his legs but he didn’t attempt to get up. John tried to catch his breath. His erection was straining in his trousers and as he sat, he could feel Sherlock’s cock hard against him. It made him want to forget where they were, how inexperienced Sherlock was and just rip the clothes of him and fuck him every way possible. Instead he steadied his breath, relaxing the muscles that was strained with the desire of pulling Sherlock closer. He lowered his head and leaned his forehead against Sherlock’s. He closed his eyes and they stayed like that for a moment. Both of their breathing slowing down, echoing each other. John felt his desire being taken over by fondness. He really cared for this man lying beneath him. He barely knew him, but he felt connected to him in a way he hadn’t felt in a long time if ever.
After dinner, Victor offered to walk Sherlock back. "No, thanks, Victor," Sherlock politely declined, lightly shaking his head with a chuckle, "John's got me," Sherlock turned to look at the Gryffindor boy, who smiled wide as if that was a greeting. Sherlock felt something bubble in his stomach for some reason. Victor didn't fight, so that was good.
"Holy shit, mate!" William turned at the bottom of the bleachers, then told John to sit down and to wait for William to help him, which John pouted, but he still did what he was told. John's body felt really heavy. "Gravity doesn't like me," John muttered as he zoned out whilst looking down at his feet.
"And, your boyfriend?" Jim asked, his voice a bit shaky, "Where's he at, then?" Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows. Boyfriend? Sherlock didn't have a boyfriend...
"Way to go, twat!" The kids from his table said, some of the closer ones giving a smack to his arm. They forced him back down, but he still glared at the boy from across the vast room.
His name was Victor and he was a second year, assigned to get Sherlock to and from all classes from then on. Sherlock looked over at the Gryffindor table, where John sat laughing with others as they shared loud anecdotes of their previous lives. Sherlock looked back at Victor and nodded, "Fine,"
"What do you think, Mike!? It was my mental spacings that bloody killed a man!" John shouted as he lied on his side, facing away from his friend. "I killed a man," John muttered.
As John and Mary walked, she sighed, "I don't think he likes me very much," she admitted lightly. John chuckled,
"Probably to curse you for feeling superior enough to have the audacity to save me," Sherlock chuckled bitterly after impersonating his mum's apparently shrill voice. John chuckled, too, shrugging as he was still too scared to find out. "Hey, uh, I n-never got to say..." Sherlock began but looked behind John as an elderly throat cleared itself. John sighed nervously and turned to see Dumbledore standing there. John pressed his hands together beneath his chin in a prying position as he turned back briefly to tighten his lips in anxiety. John then looked back at Dumbledore, who nodded his head towards his office.
"I'm sorry, Professor," John said, looking down in self-disappointment, "I take responsibility and I'll do my best to focus more," he assured, looking up at the woman with promise twinkling in his eyes.
He saw Sherlock floating motionless to the bottom of the lake. The sight made his stomach flip anxiously. John quickly swam to Sherlock, pulling on his arms to get him to the surface.
"What are we doing here?" John asked as Sherlock tentatively let go of John's hand to dig through his satchel. They hurried into an empty phone box. "No, really, what's going on; I don't understand,"
"Of course, I bloody well know who I am, woman! Have you gone absolutely daft!? I'm Sherlock Holmes, first-year Ravenclaw!" He shouted, making his own ears ring. He winced at his own voice. She stepped back and looked at him. She walked into her office and sent an owl to someone. Sherlock sat there. He pulled himself up to the head of the bed and noticed the different kinds of gifts people sent him. He looked up to find balloons, too. He flipped his over over his legs and looked down at them, then back up at the other wall. He seemed dazed for moments. Then, the door opened and,
"I'm running an errand," Sherlock quickly turned away, so John couldn't see the huge smile involuntarily spread cross his lips. John picked up his bag and slugged it over his shoulder with a huff.
John was sitting in the library, looking at books and articles in which astronomy was the solution. John may have attacked his partner, however, he still had a portion of the project to do. As he was doing so, John glanced up to see a computer and his eyes widened. He had only seen them on the telly. John tentatively stood up and slowly made his way to the information desk, where the librarian was there to greet him.
John had left the shoppe with three different magical creatures books in hopes to find out what this destructive force really was. Before John went home, he stopped to grab some cheap pastries for himself at a small bakery run by two witches, who seemed very close.
William removed his hand to allow John to quietly pack his clothes from William's bureau. John looked over his shoulder as he was about to close the door. William was frozen in fear of rejection, and John was waiting, wanting Willliam to make the first move, which unfortunately didn't happen. After the door closed, John lingered, his ear against the door to hear something. He wanted to hear something. He needed to hear something-anything. John heard footsteps toward the door, but he didn't move. William walked up to the door and pressed a hand to the wood, then pressed his forehead to it as well.
"Oh, boy! Now, we know why you don't have a girlfriend," The younger boy quickly uncovered himself as he sat up to make that remark, however, he plopped right back down and pulled the covers up again, letting out a loud, long, agonising groan.
"I know, yeah," William replied, smirking as he took the bag back and offered more to a still hungry Bill.
"Wow!" John said, his eyebrows flying up in surprise, "that could feed me for a week!" John laughed, then furrowed his eyebrows, "I think," Sherlock let out yet another posh laugh.
"Ah," Sherlock sighed, stroking a hand over John's still apparent scar on the palm of his hand. 'It's still there,' he thought, half-relieved, half-angered that his father was the cause of a semi-permanent physical scar such as that.
"Because I like you," Victor admitted, making Sherlock go quiet, "and, I like being around you, so... Why not?"
"John Watson, ma'am," he said, stepping from the group of scared kids. He was ready to win those seventy-five Galleons, twelve Sickles. She motioned for him to sit on the stool. He walked up and Mrs McGonagall took the hat up to carefully place it on his head when he sat. It began moving, squirming.
"Hey," She shouted, "What are you two doing out here?" Madam Hooch asked. She jogged out to meet them but stopped as soon as she saw the luggage they carried as he shook violently even still. She looked up at them and quickly drew her wand, only for Hagrid to stand in front of them.
"Where's your, uh, bodyguard, eh?" Jim asked, clearing his throat as he looked around, craning his neck to search for spots of yellow heading their direction.
"I'm fine," He said, "I'm perfectly fine," John didn't quite believe that, however, he knew to an extent how angry William can get when he's pushed to express himself, so John didn't want to cross an unnecessary line.
A few days into his depressive streak, a perfect barged into his trunk and pulled him out by his robe. "Get the hell out of there!" He shouted as he shoved Sherlock into a wall. He shut the trunk and kicked it back under the bed. "I don't give a shit what you're feeling, Holmes; no one does!" Shouted the perfect. "No one gives a shit about other people, so why should you!?" He hummed in question. "Why the hell are you letting emotions get the best of you, dammit!? Try to appreciate what you do have for a change, yeah?" Sherlock felt terrible for a number of reasons, but having just been yanked out of a relatively warm, dark spot into a cold, early December morning was not helping.
"Good to be back" And, so the lesson went on. Snape slipped back into his severe case of solipsism. Sherlock didn't have a notebook, but he could just copy John's notes later, if he'd let him, that was.
A half an hour later, William heard a knock on the door, but William didn't respond as he was in the bathroom.
John brought his charms book with him today as he needed to feel like he belonged somehow. The walk to the school was uneventful at best. Though... "John? John Watson...!" A voice called from behind him. John lifted his head as he slowed to a stop, looking around, wishing he'd had his wand with him. A boy he knew from his previous school hurried over to him. "Hey, Mike Stamford," the boy gave John a quick hug. It turned out they were headed to the same place, so they walked together.
"Dammit...!" John cursed as he pressed with all of his weight. He was getting tired, but he can't give up on Sherlock! He can't! He'd just done some breaths again muttering that Sherlock had to make it when he felt a hand on his shoulder,
He was waiting at the end of the hall, scratching at his last injection point out of an anxious habit. He was having an attack. People who could've only glanced at him are depicted to stare, smirk, laugh, make cruel faces, and wince at William in his mentality. He was looking from side to side as there wasn't a corner to back into. William gave up on waiting for John and rushed back into his room to isolate himself.
"I hate you," John grumbled, though his mouth couldn't help but quirk up at the edge of it. Sherlock opened the door a bit more after John had shaken his hips into the pants, pulling them up still in the back as Sherlock leaned in to plant a quick, sweet kiss to John's lips, John's eyebrows lifting almost immediately as Sherlock forgot to lean back, instead tilting his head to gain leverage into the blonde's mouth, which was easily granted by the doctor.
"A bunch of the older students give a morale boost to us younger by casting their patronuses into the night sky," He explained. John's eyes brightened and a smile spread on his lips.
"Isn't Gryffindor common room, I don't know, for Gryffindors?" Sherlock asked with a chortle. John scoffed.
"Well..." Sherlock thought, "I guess I just really didn't want them to be around me," Sherlock shrugged. John shook his head angrily.
"Let's get back," Harold said, looking to the ground, "this is strange and I can't use my mind in the cold." Harold turned and began walking away. John glanced back with a whistle. Bear came running over, basically colliding with his caretakers as they made their way to the library, their mutual... place.
"Your, uh, y-your bra," John stuttered, nervous about getting the wrong idea and getting in trouble.
"Here, take off your robe," Victor said. Sherlock did as he was advised, letting his black and blue robe fall to the floor. Sherlock sat on a pillow and Victor joined across on the opposite pillow. Sherlock's back arched in a stretch. "So, how was Transfigurations?" Victor asked, seemingly casual about the question. Sherlock blushed,
"Is this my blood?" William asked as he gingerly looked into the pale to see that it was mixed with something else.
"After the incident, she hadn't talked to me, waved to me, nor even looked my way," John took a breath.
"I thought it was Irene's dorm! Honest-to-God, mate!" John shouted, He was set on campus arrest and was issued for a detention every day for the remainder of that week. John was put out of the Dean's office before he could figure out what happened to Irene.
"I'm Harry," A woman said as she sat, her arms crossed, looking cross with everyone as she glared at everyone around the room, "I'm an alcoholic, and my wife is a bitch and sent me here,"
'He's a stalker,' 'He's going to kill me,' and 'Did I know him in a past life, maybe?' His thoughts were going wild. So wild and fleeting, in fact, that he hadn't realised that the teenager had sat down across from him until he cleared his throat once more, pulling John from his panicking daze.
"How do you know all of this?" Hagrid asked, confused by all of the knowledge the boy was sputtering out as he practically switched into a young doctor. John looked up as he hooked his hands under the jacket, giving it a test tug.
"Is this a joke?" He asked quietly, glancing up to Victor, whose eyebrows furrowed in confusion. He chuckled slightly, letting a breath of question out. Victor placed a hand under Sherlock's chin and gently lifted it up.
"Oh, no. We've been getting spammed recently and we don't need another 'Carl Powers' solver,' kid," The officer said with an ironic chuckle.
"Eh, n-no, uh, it's actually... could you help me? I heard you were great with potions class and I just..." She exhaled sharply in a distressed sigh, "I have no idea what Snape goes on about," That made Sherlock scoff.
"Sherlock!" John scolded as soon as the pair stepped outside, "What the bloody hell were you thinking, trying to go at him like that?!" John asked loudly. Sherlock looked away. John couldn't know. He couldn't know that Lestrade knew. If he'd found out that Graham had known all along, he'd accuse Sherlock go talking behind his back and then the relationship was as good as done...! And, Sherlock didn't know what he'd do without John in his life. The doctor would probably find it awkward to live with his ex and move out, and they wouldn't talk and kiss and hold hands and he'd never be able to see John's smile again, never get to breathe in the smell of him after a long case where he'd taken the man for granted, as he did all cases...!
"John," He said, sighing as he'd failed to find the courage to do something. William ignored the stuffiness in his nose and neglected the stray tear that ran down the boy's face, desperate for escape. William fell to his knees as the floodgates opened. John stood at the door, frozen with hope and fear.
"I wonder, can you speak French, then?" Sherlock asked, suppressing a laugh, and John groaned, knowing the intent he had with that possible knowledge.
"Hey, you're one of John's friends, yeah?" The boy asked. William turned around and decided to be nice as to maintain a high status with John.
"Some speculate the painting's a fake because of some star that wasn't there before," John said, rolling his eyes, apparently sharing some of William's distaste with the subject of Astronomy. They entered a large yet emptied room, which turned out to be the Mess Hall.
"You don't have to push me, you know?" Sherlock said, letting his eyes close a long moment. He opened them up to see that they'd arrived at a staircase. John parked the chair and unhooked those things from the handles. John brought them in front of Sherlock to reveal that they were braces, leg braces. Magical ones, he wagered. Sherlock rolled his eyes. John strapped them to Sherlock's legs and showed Sherlock how to strap them. John stood and leaned over Sherlock to grab something else. "Wrist supporting crutches?"
"Flippendo!" Was aggressively changed by multiple people and the sound of grunts and shouts of pain was hardly drowned out by the harsh chants. Then, half of the chanting voices switched to a different phrase, "Slugulus Eructo!" And the sounds of pain were then mixed with one of wretching, horrible wretching. Jacob looked between two trees to we a large group of Slytherins cast the spells on a single Ravenclaw. The influenced first-years were physically damaging him with punches and kicks. Some were switching rapidly between Lumos and Nox and it made John sick to his stomach when he saw, peeking out behind Jacob.
Sherlock met John's eyes for a slick moment before John turned to the side of the bookcase aisle. Sherlock followed him and quickly caught on, making the briefest of eye contacts. Sherlock scoffed quirking his eyebrows. "I need information from your dream boy over there," he lowly hissed, letting his arm wrap gently around the back of Harry's shoulders. He was so close to Harry's ear, that he could tell what product he put in his hair last night, "Grab my hand, take the paper slip," he instructed. Slowly Harry let his hand reach up to wrap around Sherlock's, completing the handoff. Harry let his head fall slightly.
Suddenly the boy did let go. He was grumbling something about a girl and rocks. John went up to breathe quickly as he saw Mary with a handful of rocks, throwing them at the boy. She noticed John looking at her. "Go, John!" She shouted as she continued to throw rocks at the big second-year. John nodded, coughing still, and went back down.
"Now, take a shower, for god's sake!" The perfect yelled. Sherlock looked down, then lightly nodded. As he went to walk towards the washroom, the older boy stopped him with a hand, "Then, I want you to show up to your fucking classes -- all of them, do you understand?" He asked harshly. Sherlock did as he was told. The shower felt nice and he felt clean and fresh and somewhat energised. Sherlock changed into a fresh set of clothes, not bothering with his robe. He loathed them, anyway.
"Hey, you can't just-" A boy shouted as Sherlock started up the stairs to their boys' dormitories. Sherlock barged into the room and looked to find that all of the beds had a trunk or cage underneath, except one. Sherlock felt his heart tighten and his eyes water. He was gone. John wasn't here anymore. Sherlock's leg gave out and he fell against the door post. He felt his stomach lurch and he didn't know what to do, now.
"Y-you can use mine," he offered, pulling out his phone. The man looked at Mike, and John could've sworn, he'd seen the man bite his lip a bit. He'd nevertheless stood up and walked slowly over to John and took the mobile he'd offered.
"What do you mean? She married you! How can she just up and leave?" John asked, taken by surprise. Harry glared at her brother.
"My father is a drug addict, my sister's an alcoholic, my mum gets beat on a daily basis, and we have absolutely no health insurance; I kind of have to take a first aid class every couple of months," he said darkly almost in a growl as he looked down at the boy, "but all that matters right now is pulling him back into the castle and getting help," John looked behind him as he turned and pulled. It was cold out that night and it was a long path. Especially when you're pulling someone else's convulsing weight instead of running away from a big ass dog.
"I've tried," John said, reaching a hand up to point awkwardly behind him to a bucket with his regurgitated attempts at eating floating in twenty millilitres of water to dilute the acids.
Then, Sherlock coughed water up into John's face. The colour beginning to return to his face as John laughed and sobbed at the same time. Applause erupted and kids let out the breaths held in their throats as John rolled Sherlock into the recovery position and pat on his back. Sherlock began sobbing loudly and John did his best to hush and comfort him. He was in a lot of pain, John figured, leaning his forehead to Sherlock's side as he sobbed, relieved that his friend was alive. Sherlock was trying to grasp onto something, anything...! John grabbed Sherlock's searching hand and held it tightly, still trying to calm himself down from the thought of possibly losing one of his best friends.
"I'll get more, once mum gets paid," he chuckled. It was a lie. John's mum doesn't work because she relied on his dad, who only worked to get high and drunk. "Don't worry about it. What do you have on you?" Sherlock stood and John hadn't known how short the boy was until he did so. He stepped on to the seat and reached over the rack to grab and pull one of his bags.
"Yes, but it doesn't matter; All that anybody should care about when they see you is if you safe and warm and happy."
"I don't see why I had to be her," John grumbled, struggling to walk in the heels Sherlock had snagged from Mrs Hudson's flat,
The next morning, John's heart was beating so fast, he was convinced his heart was palpitating as he was walking up Baker street to see that right next to a cute little sandwich shoppe, there stood a black door with a strange knocker that hung under the address which was given to him with a wink of a beautiful man.
"Mr Reese, come back immediately; we may have an issue," Finch's voice sounded worried. John took one last picture before switching his phone over to call Lionel.
Sherlock met up with Victor at the entrance to the courtyard. Victor hugged him and took his hands as they went through the door at the end of the steps. There was a spot cleared out where it seemed Victor made a pillow fort with blankets, sheets, and comforters. Victor pulled back a blanket as f drawing a certain and Sherlock and he entered. The space had been enchanted with the muffliato spell and atmospheric charm, making the blanketed area warmer than outside was.
"He left," Sherlock stopped and snapped his head up to the knock. His eyes were wide and his face had paled,
Sherlock thought about it, humming, then came to the conclusion, "yeah, I'll most likely be there; when do they meet, do you know?" Sherlock asked. Once Sherlock got the meeting time, Jim was on his way, saying how much he looked forward to seeing Sherlock there. Sherlock bid him goodbye and continued to pick at his food, actually eating a bite or two, feeling good about tonight.
"You're still my son. It doesn't matter, in my opinion, who you're with," He said, shrugging as he took another sip, "as long as the person feels the same way and treats you right, I don't see why I should have a problem with whoever you like."
"Because nobody sits with me; nobody likes me. So, if you start to like me, you'll be a nobody, like me." He explained, straining his voice for the last part. John's smirk widened a bit.
"What?! John, are you absolutely mad!?" He shouted. "John, I respect you, especially for what you did for Sherlock last night, but this is-" he started, but John pushed past him,
John was very surprised when William tackled him in a hug, causing John to fall back against the bed.
"H-hi," Sherlock heard as he was snapped back to reality from his seat at the very end of the Great Hall's long table for the Ravenclaw students. The boy the voice accompanied was clad in yellow, "Sherlock, right?" He asked. Sherlock, looking the boy up and down, answered with a terse nod, making the boy smile.
He ended up getting escorted back to his house by an angry third-year. He didn't go to dinner or any of his evening classes. He wasn't planning on going the following day, either. He only hid himself in his trunk.
"I suppose, although, you mustn't complain about my complaining as I worked out for the first time in a long time, you see? And, I'm going to have a bit of pain tomorrow." John explained his condition, and William agreed a shade too quick for John's taste. John and William headed down for some lunch.
"I don't think you're useless, idiot," Willliam scoffed as he turned his face down to look at John, "If I thought you were useless, I wouldn't let you help me tie this useless tie," John snorted out of amusement at the comment he'd heard.
John could hear the smirk in Sherlock's voice as he snatched his pair of red and white pants from the man's hand, which he squeezed in through the crack of the door. "Although, I'd love to see the flustered look on your face as you buy a pack of the five-pound brand from a store," Sherlock's low voice purred, sending shivers up John's spine.
"It's gonna hurt like hell," John warned. William nodded as John looked back down at the injury. John began to stitch William up. William squeezed John's shoulder to help compensate the pain with grit, however, William's not so sure if it actually helped.
"W-well, uh, I guess I'll see you tomorrow morning, then?" Victor said as Sherlock's daze was finally broken from Jim Moriarty walking into the office of the headmaster. Sherlock shook his head and swallowed. He looked at Victor with tightened lips and nodded. Quickly, Victor looked faint, then stepped in, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's torso.
"Great! We're gonna be best friends...!" He said sweetly. Sherlock shyly smiled up at Victor. They then ate together. And, after, Victor upheld his promise, helping Sherlock through the castle back to his house. John was waiting and as soon as he saw Sherlock, the blonde boy smiled.
"It's never your fault, John," William said, folding his hands as his elbows rested on his knees. Willliam's damp curls clung to his forehead, showing John that they were in fact long enough to cover his eyes as the rain came down harder.
Upon arriving home, John quickly made for his room and practically locked himself in, reading and eating until he fell asleep, wrappers and crumbs on his bedspread as John's face cutely slept over top.
"Oh, my," She gasped lightly, "is it a teacher?"  William's eyes went wide with horror, trying desperately to get rid of the mental image of him with any of his teachers,
"I never said that. I'm just saying that if she wants fewer pimples, she's got to go at it a natural way," Sherlock tried to explain, but John still looked uninterested in his excuses,
He wasn't like William. He was more social, and probably one of the most Cassanova-like boy William had encountered in that school. 'Heh,' William thought as he let out a chuckle, 'figures, he's the only Cassanova I know, and I've inevitably fallen for him,' William climbed into a comfortable sleep-like state when he thought his last thought of the night, 'what will I do without him?'
"I saw it," He said, "You see, as I was strolling up from my previous seat, and saw you sitting alone, acceptance letter in hand, where I caught your name. Then, as I dropped your trunk in exchange for mine, I saw a 'Junior Reserved Officer Training Corpse,' pamphlet being used as a bookmark in a medicinal sciences textbook, then after you, so kindly, scolded me, I took a glance down to see, 'J-R,' and I put two and two together, efficiently," He explained. John was barely keeping up with what was being said.
"Your student threw a marble at me in an aggressive, ill-mannered attempt to get under my skin, sir. John was just trying to defend me, is all," Sherlock said, reaching over the bench the two boys sat on to pick up said marble and show it to the professor. "You're supposed to be supervising us. How would this have happened, Professor?"
After an unbearable drive back to London, then sitting through, "bloody traffic!" John was reintroduced to London, muggle life, making him feel very depressed. John saw a folded paper on the counter, next to the most recently emptied bottles, and he picked it up to see the title, 'The Daily Prophet,' John fervently opened it up to read it. John's father snatched it from his hands.
John looked the man's name up and found a website. John'd read through it and he was confused. This man is really smart and extraordinary. John decided to write about it on the new blog he's being forced to write. John couldn't help but include the charm Sherlock had to him. John had to know more about the man he'd be living with because let's face it, John was not going to say no to whatever cost of living with Sherlock. John thought Sherlock's mind is brilliant, his eyes are beautiful, and the man was overall pleasant to be around, although John got that deja vu feeling like he'd met Sherlock before.
"I don't belong in a London school...!" John protested, but his father only but gave him a testing look, that made John shut up quickly. He'd hesitantly closed up his book and looked out the window, extremely bored.
"For any other class you'd be on par with lecture notes and study sessions, however, Professor Snape is far more high maintenance than just on par, Mary, you should know," He calmly scolded.
"You've got a bug, you know?" Sherlock said without looking at the blonde man, letting go of his hand as the cab had pulled up to the side of the road.
As they prepared to leave, John's legs wobbled in the heels even still, holding onto Sherlock. The two walked past the receptionist and John looked back to wink at the man spitefully. They snickered as they took their leave.
When the holiday started, Sherlock was convinced that he'd be fine. It was better for him to be alone, anyway. He could actually get some studying done. Sherlock overheard Harry and John Reese talking in the back of the library on the first day of the holiday. He decided to approach them.
"I didn't ask you what you call it; I'm asking what it actually is," John clarified, and William narrowed his eyes.
"But, they told me not to tell, or they'll beat me up." Then, William loosened up as he let out a breathy chuckle, "I don't know why I was scared, though; I've had tougher people beat me up before."
"Brilliant," he said, making John's face flush, "I mean I came here to hunt the Obscurus, anyway, but since you've already gathered such information, it means I don't have to explain it to you," Sherlock shrugged. John laughed, rolling his eyes.
"What are you doing here? Going to chase my roommate away again?" He asked, a mean look on his face.
"Well, since Dr Watson has an entire blog dedicated to his flatmate, Mr Holmes would be preferable," Harold gave quickly. John started walking, pulling his phone out to seem distracted as he and Sherlock bumped shoulders, causing the dark-haired man to stumble some. The other two stopped, Dr Watson sighing, rolling his eyes as if expecting what will come next.
"Gather as many men who are still alive as you can and meet back here; I'll do the same, mate," Mike said. John nodded and watched as Mike awkwardly walked away to go find mates to help him capture the point. John took a peek and swallowed hard as he saw how many guns were sticking from the trenches. John saw that some of the sand was lifted like there was something under a layer of sand. 'Mines,' John thought as he narrowed his eyes in a suspicious manner.  John went to look for soldiers suitable for battle. Most of them weren't. It was either, they had died from neglectful medics or from medical malpractice in general.
Sherlock spent a day debating on whether or not he should go and check on John. He didn't have permission to sneak off campus, but then again, it's not sneaking if you have permission, nor is it exciting. That settled it. Since Sherlock had nothing better to do, he would go, tomorrow, to central London. He really hoped Mrs Hudson still had that block of flats.
"You're saying he's having a seizure?" Jacob seemed afraid and very scared. He was probably thinking of what would happen to the boy. John glanced up and nodded.
"A simple, 'hello, I'm (so-and-so), your new roommate,' would be fine for me, thanks." The boy said sarcastically.
John opened the door to William's dorm and saw the boy asleep on the bed. John decided to get in the shower whilst his friend was sleeping. When John exited the bathroom, however, he saw William holding his recruitment papers, staring at them almost in disbelief.
"It looks fairly consensual on all parties," Harold said with a shrug in his voice. "'Seems as though Mr Holmes, who doesn't really like the spotlight of London, mainly works with homicides; I'd check with Detective Carter and Fusco to see if they can keep an eye on them if I were you." He suggested. John gave a brief hum and turned his head, giving his earpiece a tap with his finger as he stealthily dialled for Detective Carter.
"If it's about my social life, I'm not interested in gossip," Sherlock said coldly, beginning to turn away from the blonde. She only released an, oh, before shaking her head lightly.
"Wait," he said, pleading. John briefly looked back, "I need your help," Sherlock let his eyebrows turn up with emotion before John's dad decided to break it up himself. Bounding down their muddied dead lawn, to the end of the street, John looked over at the angry man, then back at Sherlock.
Sherlock was brought to a moment he'd never lived before. It was like an alternate universe where they were in Sherlock's dorm back in College, lying on Sherlock's bed, the both of them, each with an earbud in one ear. Sherlock's younger-self looked over and smiled at John, who smiled charmingly back. Sherlock had willed himself to hold himself back in reality, but during his 'needle-dreams,' he was the opposite. He was confident, daring, strong-willed. However, this dream was a new one. He hadn't dreamt about John since he was in the hospital after he was shot. The younger Sherlock reached his hand to caress John's cheek, which John'd leaned into. Sherlock had caressed his friend's face before. In fact, it was the last day of John's college days, when he was being shipped off into the Army. Sherlock wanted that again, only he didn't want the heartache that came with it. The young, tall boy had leaned in, his face growing alarmingly close to John's. Sherlock urged it to happen, but before it would, Sherlock felt a bolt of a startling amount of electricity to the side of his abdomen, waking him with a start.
Sherlock essentially told Lestrade to sod off for the next month, choosing instead to use his free time getting to know John as thoroughly and as intimately as possible. All in all, it was four weeks well spent. John certainly seemed to agree, judging by how often that playful smirk was on his lips.
