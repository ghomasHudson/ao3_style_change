Sherlock swirled his tongue around the head of John's cock slowly. "I already told you I have..."
Mary grinds down on her teeth, because as much as she is still sore, still bitter and betrayed at everything that’s happened, this is miserable. It’s like she’s watching their friendship drain away through her fingertips, all the memories and the happy moments vanish in front of her, overwritten by
, those cheekbones really were something. The appearance of them ever changing depending on the setting. They could be razor sharp, or deliciously smooth, but whatever the lighting was the curves always seemed to be in exactly the right places. John’s eyes trailed down from Sherlock’s face to his clothes. He was wearing his usual things, slick black trousers and a dangerously tight fitting white shirt, which was mostly concealed underneath a black suit jacket. He always looked smart. This was Oxford, one of the best universities in Britain, but even so he did look just slightly out of place. His hair was long black and curly, falling mercifully over his ears and forehead. It was the only thing that was boyish about him really. Everything else was...well there was no denying he was handsome. John bit his lip, hard. Suddenly stumbling from his thoughts. His stomach knotting, horrified, as he realised he was staring a bit too intently into Sherlock's eyes and sti hadn't even answered his question.
Sherlock shifts on his back and tries to sit up, his arms shaking as he puts pressure on them. Everything
Perhaps he’ll never escape this. The chains are locked securely around his wrists. All the exits are blocked. This time he has no plan, no backup, and no one is coming to save him. Maybe this really is the end.
Hello again! This randomly came to me when I was lying in bed one morning. It's not something I'd usually write but there we go. I hope you like it.
“And I…”
“You are.”
“Really?”
He drops his gaze and takes another deep breath. Mrs Hudson places her hand on his thigh and whispers, "Steady dear, it's nearly over."
“Don’t.” John turns on him instantly, thrusting a threatening hand in the detective’s direction. “Just...” His words come out as a low warning, a guttural growl. “…don’t.”
Surely no one in history has taken this amount of drugs and survived. No one. Sherlock must have known it was suicide to do so. Is that what they are witnessing here? An attempted suicide? For
“Well I never,” The older Holmes widens his eyes. If John isn’t mistaken it looks like his jaw might be about to drop open.
"Well, I don't know... France is pretty."
“Oh, Sherlock!” Molly exclaims, and John sighs in defeat as she pushes past him.
She’s not careful or quiet, and the wood splinters as she pulls up the first corner. She sighs. Two nails out. Two to go. She removes the metal and wedges the bar in from the other side. She never thought she’d be doing this so soon, if ever, and the thought of how quickly her life has fallen apart helps her find the strength to push down on the crowbar once again.
Mary pulls back. She shrugs. “I suppose I'll get over it eventually.”
“How…” She is still struggling to form a coherent sentence. The words take a long time to leave her lips. She pulls back from the arms crowding her shoulders. “How could you?”
Sherlock says nothing in return, and they sit in silence for a while. But it's not awkward. Not heavy with tension like before. Gradually Mycroft feels the dense air thinning around them, the water draining away at their feet. He starts to breathe cool, clear air.
Sherlock squeezes his hand.
The man with the beard lurches forward and knees Sherlock in the chest, forcing the detective to whip his head backwards out of the way. His long matted black hair falls from his face.
“...be set up…?” Sherlock finished quietly.
It’s like a switch has been flicked in the room. The lights have changed to green. It’s time to
to make his voice soft, like he used to when they were children. “Sherlock, look...don’t get upset I didn’t…”
Sherlock tries to turn his head away but the act only causes him to wince in pain.
"You don't, um, do drugs? Do you Sherlock?" He stuttered slightly when he said Sherlock’s name and cursed himself internally for it.
want to think about the answer.
"Now?"
“I mean I can get there on my own, ok?”
“No John, he needs to hear it.” She gulps. “I’m sorry you’ve been unhappy and I’m sorry that it sucks. But there are better ways of dealing with it than this. This isn’t fair on anyone else. You’ve got to stop now okay. You’ve just got to stop.”
“Do you feel as though you want to be in a relationship? I mean a romantic one. A sexual one.”
“Yeah, listen Sherlock,” he’ll begin. He’ll look up at you, and a muscle in his jaw will twitch. His mouth will twist a bit. And you’ll know: you’re doing this now.
She knew you were lying as well as we do. She’s a smart lady, that one! I understand the attraction, trust me! But it’s for the best. A tryst between the three of you could have had its benefits, of course. A little imagination goes a long way! All of London would have been salivating over the blog post about that steamy evening, let me tell you. Not that it’s any of their business, of course, but...well, you know how people are.
Do you want to hear the one where your date will fail to turn up, so you’ll take him out in her place? You will have bought the tickets ahead. Would be a shame to waste them. Premium seats at the Everyman, nice and romantic.
When John recovers, he’ll return to Baker Street. You’ll worry that he won’t, but he does. It won’t even be a question. But it will be different, away from the bright white stasis of the hospital. John’s health won’t be in peril, and that will regrettably free you up to consider the future full time. A future you won’t yet know how to detach from all your planning. And 221b won’t be the right place to let go of those plans, because it’s where you made those plans.
And that’s it: done and dusted. Painless, really.
“The moment I kissed you is the moment I stopped lying to you.”
"Good. Reason number one: they showed the video. They never show the video of tragedies. And why? Because gore is usually unacceptable for day-time television. So why was that footage allowed? There was no gore. No blood. Which leads me to reason number two: Mycroft is too careful than to expose himself to the public without some sort of protection, like a bulletproof vest. No blood plus Mycroft's personality equals he was wearing a vest. Which also equals not dead! Moving to reason number three, if you even need any more, I haven't received a frantic phone call from my parents, which means they don't know. If Mycroft were dead, they would have been contacted immediately as next of kin. Under the same reason, I would have been contacted as soon as he arrived at the morgue. But again, I have yet to receive any such calls. So, therefore, reason must state that Mycroft Holmes is not dead!" Sherlock finished dramatically, ending in shouting tones loud enough to wake the dead. At first, Greg refused to allow himself to believe that what Sherlock said was true, but the solid reasoning made him consider the option.
"I don't think you know what you're saying, John." Sherlock said quietly, his face and voice unreadable.
"Mycroft Holmes, will you marry me?"
"Why do you want to know? Give me a good reason and I'll tell you."
Even though it was still early in the evening, Greg and Mycroft collapsed into the bed together and fell into a deep and restful sleep, finally free of nightmares.
"Sherlock, everyone knows how you take your coffee, even Lestrade! You don't exactly make it much of a secret!"
"I suppose it just takes a sophisticated palette to appreciate the intense flavors of dark chocolate. Like how I take coffee black, and you have to have sugar in yours. Two, to be precise."
"He's had an argument with a lover. My guess is they broke up. Greg's afraid he'll never see this person again. He also blames himself, but he's not sure of that, so he probably couldn't actually have helped the situation, even if he could have tried." For a reason beyond Sherlock's reach, Greg flinched like he had been slapped when Sherlock had said the word "my". Greg unclenched his jaw to try and give something in reply.
Greg and Mycroft sighed as they watched the new couple walk down the hall together, hardly daring to let go. They could both remember the time when that was them. That night, they felt the same way, though, especially Greg. He felt like if he let go, even for a second, Mycroft would disappear. He decided it had to be then; he had to do it quickly before Mycroft faded away.
"Love, John. I was talking about love. I have Greg, but Sherlock refuses to tell his love about his feelings. He's too scared of rejection." Mycroft answered, since Sherlock declined.
"I think that's a great idea, Sherlock. Goodnight Greg, Mycroft. By the way, very glad you're not dead!" They all chuckled as John and Sherlock left the small flat, hands entwined.
The depressing thought infiltrated his celebratory mood at thinking of the downfall of a terror cell with such force it caused his bruised ribs to ache with renewed fervor.
John's eyes went wide with shock.
"But what do I do if he is? If I allow myself to hope, and he's dead, what then?"
"Mycroft, I wasn't planning on doing this tonight, but losing you today, although it was temporary, hurt like hell. It also made me think: what would I do if I lost you? It scared me to death because I didn't have an answer. Me without you has become obsolete. Completely and utterly pointless. I decided when you came back through that door from death to life, I didn't want to ever experience a day without you again. Open your eyes, please." Mycroft again did as he was told, but this time he had a feeling he knew what he was going to see, and he was right. Greg was kneeling on the floor with a small box covered in soft black velvet in his hands. It was still closed, but when Greg saw that his eyes were open, he slowly raised the lid of the box as he spoke the age-old words that moved Mycroft to tears.
"That was weak, John, and obviously a lie. You'll have to do better than that. Why do you want to know who I am supposedly in love with?"
A moment of silence ensued.
"Those Kevlar vests sure are good at keeping you alive, but they haven't quite figured out how to minimize the bruising, yet. But think on the bright side, sir: you get to live to be the British Government another day." The commissioner throws over his shoulder as he walks through the door, closing it behind him, leaving the sore man alone with his thoughts once again. He'd been locked in his office, presumed dead by the media and likely everyone else, for three hours already, ever since the shooting occurred at 11:00 that morning. He hadn't planned for this to happen, but he had known that it was going to potentially be dangerous to present himself to the public in such an exposed way, so he had thankfully made the decision to wear a bulletproof vest that morning. But the press didn't know that. Couldn't know that. Because if the press assumed him dead, the people who were targeting him would assume him dead, meaning they would be celebrating, and not worrying about being careful, which means it would be the perfect time for them to be caught.
taught you.”
As the bike zooms she glances sideways, only allowing herself one quick glance at the Thames, at the pink sunrise reflecting off the water, before pulling her foot back up on the clutch and revving the accelerator.
is dancing.
She tries once more. Upset now. Close to defeat. “Please.”
How about if she just took her? How would John react? What if she just took Rosie far away and never told him. Never let him say goodbye. She could outrun Mycroft for at least six months, maybe a year, and go to Asia, Cambodia. Find somewhere to settle. A fucking shack or something. They’d be fine there. It’d be a punishment. John broke her heart so now she’ll break his. Make him suffer.
John sighed quietly, a quick flash of relief crossing his face. Perhaps Sherlock wasn’t actually annoyed.
"Okay…” John sighed. “Let's just, all move on shall we?"
Then she’ll be there.
Mycroft bites down on his lip, because, John is whispering the words so softly, so gently, that in any other situation you would think he was speaking to a child.
They were centimeters away, maybe less, noses next to each other, eyes closed,
Mary is looking at him. Sherlock is looking at him. A panic in his chest indicates that he needs to speak now; just say it all before it’s too late.
“Really, Sherlock?”
“So, you’re going... where? For how long?” She stands in the doorway. It’s raining outside.
John struggles to keep his hand still for long enough. His best friend is squirming and jolting beneath him, like a mouse trying to escape from a trap.
Of course. Sherlock’s bedroom. The realisation of the last 48 hours hits him like a blow to the head. He takes a deep breath. Orange light filters through the blinds. It’s early evening. They must have slept through the day.
have.”
Not everyone was ignoring him though, a couple of students at the front and Sherlock, normally listened. In fact Sherlock never messed around, usually he sat straight, taking notes and hanging on John’s every word. Not today though, which was odd. Today he seemed...agitated, like the lesson wasn’t quite enough for him or something.
Someone yanks the helmet from her head. Mary squints and puts a hand to her face slowly. Blood wets her fingers.
“No...I - hey!”
Mycroft tugs at John’s shoulders and they sit back as a man with mousy brown hair and sharp blue eyes takes over. He checks Sherlock’s pulse before lifting the detective’s head and sliding an oxygen mask over his mouth, causing his hair to get caught at the sides. A steady stream of warm breath appears on the inside of the plastic.
Mycroft lets out a breath.
John is speechless.
“Of course, but he won't do it.” Mycroft feels his fists start to curl involuntarily in his lap. “You know how he is, Claire. They’ll be no persuading him. There just won't.”
"Yes. Why does Dopamine build up in the brain when you excessively take Cocaine over a 24 period?” Sherlock asked, his voice calm and low, his usual confidence seeming to return as he spoke.
“You bastar-” John went in for an angry third attempt, pushing and squabbling like a small child desperate for a lollipop. He tried furiously until he ended up leaning across the Chair, stretched over Sherlock in a messy flop, with one of his knees pressed up high on Sherlock’s thigh. Both of his arms outstretched in a determined attempt to reach out to where Sherlock's long, lean, muscular one was dangling the present just out of reach behind him, centimetres from John’s fingertips.
John wipes his eyes and takes steady breaths in and out. It feels like the ground is about to vanish beneath his feet.
Sherlock’s voice comes from over his shoulder. “Fine.”
He brushed it off as nothing at first, but then Sherlock did it again. And again. John had to check a couple of times to be sure he wasn't imagining it. As they were walking, just for a split second, so quick that anyone
The door swings open.
“Fuck,” John pulls back abruptly, breathless.  “Sherlock… that's…” but he doesn't have a chance to finish, because all of a sudden Sherlock's lips are on his again. Needy. Urgent. Hot and heavy. John puts his hand on Sherlock’s waist. Sherlock starts fumbling at the buttons on John’s shirt. Desperate.
“You’re not fine.”
close to the edge.
John waited for Sherlock to speak first but to his surprise the younger man remained silent, only fiddling with the rim of his jacket.
John is still staring into Sherlock’s eyes, lost, when he realises the detective is slowly lifting his hand into the space between them, his palm trembling, hesitating in mid-air. John finds himself holding his breath and-
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock whispers after a moment, moving his cheek and willing John to kiss him again, but not being bold enough to initiate it. "I'm sorry for everything."
Mycroft pulls out his phone and taps in his MI6 login. He sets up a border alert for Mary’s description and gets two people on the job of locating her before John has finished his conversation. He’s annoyed at himself. He should have predicted this would happen.
Mary crouches on her knees in the hallway of her empty house and attempts to rip up one of the floorboards with a crowbar.
“Sure?”
“Of course,” Mrs Hudson nods, “I’ll get a pot.” She takes one last fleeting look at Sherlock before moving towards the stairs. “Oh, and John?”
“John… I’ve been meaning to say…I...”
John shivered as tingling arousal started to overtake his body. He loved it when Sherlock was like this.
They sat there in the dark, holding their breath as the clicking got closer and closer, until it was just outside the door.
And if you want to be really depressed, then listen to this song :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn0qoSvsn7Q
John tries to give Sherlock a reassuring look.
Mycroft sits back and watches silently as John’s gentle hand caresses Sherlock’s cheek, the pad of his thumb smearing across some of the blood on his lips.
John’s voice grows deeper, darker, like a spark running through gunpowder. His expression reminds her vaguely of thunder.
Mycroft watches as Sherlock tilts his head back and tries to focus on the ceiling, his fingers curling ever so slightly at his sides. He starts to blink rapidly. It actually takes Mycroft a second to realise he’s trying to stop himself from crying.
“I...”
“You could say that.” Sherlock grimaces. He and Mycroft share a look.
He places his hands underneath his chin.
“Of course I meant it, Sherlock.” John interrupts, his fists clenching tightly at his sides. “I meant every word ok? Every. Damn. Word.”
Mycroft nods silently beside him.
“Oh gosh,”
The clock is
"Sherlock!" John called as he spotted the trails of a very familiar long black coat go sweeping around the corner of the shop aisle and promptly out of view. "Sherlock, wait!"
Mycroft stands in the centre of the living room of 221B Baker Street; rolled-up sleeves and bin bag at the ready. His face curls in disgust as he bends down to pick up some browning newspapers and what looks like mouldy old takeaway packets from the floor. He turns to Sherlock, still lying on the sofa.
“Sorry.” Sherlock whispered, looking lost and then faintly concerned, as if he’d previously been in a daze and he’d only just remembered himself.
Mary darts forward, the curls of her blonde hair falling across her flushed cheeks.
He tells himself. He can’t worry about all that now. There’s no point, it's not going to make the current situation any better. He’s just got to focus on seeing Sherlock through this.
“I’m not difficult.”
If there’s anything he’s learnt while working for the British Government it's that some things just have to be done.
"Well he
“Mycroft?” John drops his hand.
“Sherlock…”
One…. two…
The other man circles behind him lazily. Sniggering at the seeping wounds that line Sherlock's bare back. He readies the whip.
Mycroft feels a fresh stab of guilt, right in the stomach. It’s a reminder of his failure.
Sherlock’s glistening eyes flickered up to his and the pupils seemed to twinkle deviously, and that's when John realised Sherlock had been teasing him deliberately, waiting for him to beg.
Mycroft looks up. “Ok, fine. I agree.”
And I know
“Obviously it would be essential for you to lie the patient down with their legs up, if possible, to ensure remaining blood and therefore oxygen could get to the brain. Were you ever taught science?" Sherlock spat.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock!” John hissed, shrinking back briefly to regain strength before reaching out again and clambering over Sherlock, trying desperately to grab it still.
“What?” Sherlock looks irritated. “I’ve said the phrase ‘thank you’ before.”
he was about to agree to, but one thing, at least, was certain.
It’s indulgent. It’s ridiculous. He’s technically still
“Mary, please. Listen to me.”
“Check his pulse.” Mycroft orders.
It’s the same words, spoken the same as before, but different. Darkness has started to close in on Sherlock from all directions, all angles. He feels trapped inside a cage, a dark room he’s long forgotten the way out of. It appears there’s no escape. Shadows of unknown figures start to flicker in front of him, all laughing. One by one the outlines start to resemble everyone he’s ever cared for; Mycroft...Molly... John…all telling him to hurry up and get on with it. Their words strike him like bullets.
There's something about Sherlock saying the word promise that makes John feel very warm inside. He tries to stop focusing so hard. To stop panicking and overthinking everything. Besides, now that his cock is finally getting some attention, he's nearly there too.
Sherlock shuffles and turns so that they’re facing each other, his expression solemn. He’s trying hard. “I didn't tell you because I couldn't, or Moriarty’s snipers would have shot you right there and then, on the tarmac at Bart’s, or soon afterwards, or even before if they suspected you knew the game. It was all worked out, John. A fake suicide was the
“No that would have defeated the whole point!” Sherlock cries, exasperation erupting in his voice. “Don’t you
Sherlock stills beneath him. Because of
John’s whole body flooded with relief, he gave a massive sigh and with Sherlock’s help, wriggled down in the hope of being more comfortable, until he ended up straddling Sherlock’s lap in a way that was surprisingly snug on the small chair.
“You mean…”
Rosie blinks at the memory, the vision of their conversation so real she can still hear the crackle of the fire in her ears. It is a devastating shame that she never knew her, but she’d like to think that if she was watching now; she’d be happy with the way things turned out. It was for the best that Sherlock and Dad finally got together, and that they were happy and in love, because in turn, Rosie’s childhood was a blissfully happy one too. Surely, her mother would have been glad of that.
“Umm…" The nurse crinkles her nose. "Actually I’m afraid I really should be present.”
Why hide from her?
Most of all, he's the only person who could make him cry
He’s not actually going to say this. Here. Now. Surely he’s not...
John raised his eyebrows even higher. “Hmm” He huffed. “I would say otherwise” But Sherlock could see his mouth was beginning to curl up in a smile.
"Oh wasn't it?" John spits. "What was it France? Russia? Slovakia? Your own holiday, a one-stop tour of Europe." He tilts his head sarcastically. "Oh let's not worry about John, I'll just fake my own death for two years. He'll be fine with that. Everything will be just how I left it."
And then Sherlock
He turns sideways and stares himself up and down for a moment, deciding, debating. Does he look…good? Or just old fashioned?
Sherlock stops moving and makes a face. “Of course I am, John. Stop asking me stupid questions.”
“Defend you?”
“John!” Sherlock said, raising his voice a little, he wanted to try and go after him but his stuff was still everywhere and he couldn't leave it.
Every fibre of Sherlock’s being makes him want to look away. For the shame is so overpowering, the embarrassment so strong, that it’s nearly impossible not to turn his head, to shut his eyes and retreat to the darkest and most private corners of his mind palace - to hide.
“What? Oh.”
“2.39am. Now get dressed immediately and get in the car waiting for you outside. Don’t bring Mary. I’ll meet you there. See you-”
“Ok.” Mary nods. “Ok. Maybe we’ll talk tomorrow?”
Sherlock nods.
“Sherlock, this is incredible. I can do it, I can-”
At least he doesn’t look quite so pale, John thinks.
“Well…” Sherlock daringly reached out and placed the light touch of his palm on John’s shoulder. “I’ve got some research notes I was hoping you could take a look at…”
Absolute stillness.
Realisation floods her veins, quick and sharp, like a drug entering her system. The cabs go to pull over, they recognise her, and then they drive off.
Sherlock gave a shy smile, and it was as if just for a second all the paraphernalia that usually surrounded him was gone, the magnificent smoke of 'being Sherlock Holmes’ was blown back from him briefly. In that moment John could see Sherlock for all he truly was; just another small human being who’d given his heart to someone else and was praying they didn’t break it. The truth was, Sherlock was vulnerable, and entirely in John’s hands.
You'll tell yourself, for example, that the happy ending is that John lived. He escaped his entanglement with you long enough to blog about it. If he still wants to blog about you, that is: sitting there in the hospital, bundled in your coat and listening to the drone of the vending machine, you won’t be sure. But still: John lived. If that's not a miracle, nothing is. Wanting anything more is just selfishness.
You think you need them, the coat and scarf, don’t you? John thinks you look cool in them, yes, we know. But once they’re gone, you won’t miss the extra weight. Not at all. The jacket won’t feel like such a big step compared to that. And when John unbuttons your shirt, well. I can’t say you’ll be calm, but it’s hard to describe how it feels when a decades-long background hum of anxiety recedes and a different kind of excitement drowns out everything else. The outward signs are similar, after all: your heart will pound, you’ll hardly be able to breathe. You’ll be properly terrified, that goes without saying. You’ll feel a bit like you’re going to die, Sherlock, if I’m honest. But you’ll feel truly
You’ll see your violin near the window and think,
Oh no, definitely not, I won’t tell you what she told Dr. Watson. That’s between the two of them. He’s free to tell you, if he wants to. But we all know he won’t. That’s not his style, is it. I have a different story for you, if you want to hear it.
He’ll be frustrated because he’s been caught out again. Some little detail in a case that shines an uncomfortable light on a gap in his core knowledge. You know already what that gap is. It’s sex. Romantic affection. It’s all the rush of hormones that comes along with being physically intimate with someone you love. He understands it all theoretically, but in practical terms it remains a nagging and persistent mystery. He wants to understand everything, even the things he’s not sure he’ll ever physically know. He doesn’t believe that there’s any truth to the contention that you need to experience this particular activity in order to fully understand it, but once in a while a case crops up that shows him that he’s wrong. That he’s got a bit missing, that he doesn’t entirely understand. You’ve already seen that, haven’t you. He goes a little hollow at moments like that. You can see the gap in him then, can’t you.
“Your best friend.” It will be terribly difficult for him, saying all this.
No, of course we’re not listening in on your conversations with your wife! No no! We’re not creeps! We’re just observers and pattern-followers, that’s all. Theme hunters. Subtext analysts, shall we say. Have you noticed that your life revolves around a set of themes? No? Well it does. That’s how we know what we know. It’s just that obvious, if you’re looking at it from the right angle. Your life is a composition, and we can feel where the notes are heading based on the ones we’ve already heard. It’s not magic, or voyeurism. We’re only following a logical progression, that’s all.
Are you ready?
I didn’t mean to let it slip out like that. What, the odds? On your happy marriage continuing indefinitely? Do you really want to know?
Sorry: strike that. I didn’t mean to say
We could do all of that, sure, but it won’t matter, because John will say yes anyway. As a stickler for semantics, surely you understand the word
We’re just interested observers, waiting for the inevitable. We’re waiting for you to fall out of the sky. Or leap into it, depending on your preferred metaphor. You see?
It will begin just after breakfast, which he’ll only pick at. He won’t be in a strop, exactly, but you’ll feel one brewing. He’ll want a cigarette, he’ll want a needle in his vein, and he’ll be anxious. Crawling out of his skin. Familiar, isn’t it? You’re used to this sort of thing. You know how it goes. This won’t be any different.
But John will look back at you, albeit suspiciously. He'll say your name – has been saying your name, you'll think. And then he'll say it sharply, in that tone that makes you feel like he's taller than you, and suddenly you'll be able to hear again. The world will speed back up again. And John will say he's okay, which can't be true, but somehow it will be. You'll stare down at him, blinking. John won’t look at you, though; he’ll look at other people. You won't remember exactly what you say, what brings John's attention back to you, but he’ll only frown and say, "Yeah. I love you too, Sherlock."
But it will be awkward, yes. Coping strategies won’t do much for that. Even Lestrade will pick up on it. Lestrade, of all people! He didn’t see the kiss, you know, having taken off after Mary. So when Lestrade looks between you and John during an uncomfortable silence and makes that shifty face, it will feel unfair. I’d assure you that you won’t be that obvious, that word just gets around, but the truth is, it will be both.
John will sit with his laptop resting on his knees, but you won’t hear him typing. You’ll wonder what he’s not typing about.
Let’s be clear from the outset: it will happen. There’s no fighting that. It’s like gravity; you can imagine flying, you can dream about pushing off the pavement and soaring into the sky, but in truth, if you found yourself up in the air like that, you would most certainly fall to the ground at a known rate of speed. It’s like that. Predictable, like gravity. You are falling, John Watson. You will land one way or another. It’s only a matter of when, where, and how.
It will almost be as if nothing was said at all. As if it didn’t happen. Almost. The only difference that afternoon will be that you will grant yourself permission to watch him. Of course you often watch him, but not like you will this time. Not with this direct, unashamed, anticipating, devoted stare. He’ll notice. He loves to be watched. You know that already.
“What?” It will have been six hours since you asked the question. It’s fair enough that you’ll have no idea what he’s saying yes to.
It will quickly become clear that nowhere in the flat is safe. Nor much of the outside world. You would go get dinner, but it would be a bit rude not to invite John. You would try to find a case, but you don’t want to do a case without John. You would simply make up an excuse and leave, but you’re sick of lying to John. None of those will solve anything, anyway. You’ll know you’re just stalling, trying to think of something to
You look conflicted. It’s bad news, but it’s not all bad news, is it.  Being in love with two people at once can be a bit confusing sometimes, when you’re not ready for it. When no one talks about it. And I know you’ve got that big ugly marital issue to wrestle with. Can’t be easy, not knowing who on earth you married. No one would blame you if you tried to have the marriage voided on the grounds of completely-made-up identity, I’m sure.
Plenty of people don’t have bloggers, you’ll tell yourself, and they aren’t lost.
“John.” That’s all you’ll manage. Pointless. Worthless.
It’s inevitable. Not impossible. Remember? You do manage to say the right thing, sometimes. It’s been known to happen. So you’ll pull yourself together, and this is what you’ll say:
There’s the one where you fall asleep on the floor together in a tiny space. Long story: there’ll be a case, and a door you can’t open until the right moment, and only just enough room. It’s a closet you’ll be shut up inside, if you must know. The jokes come naturally for this one, of course, but I won’t be so gauche.
You’ll consider never coming back, for a moment or two. But you’ll know that running away is silly and hardly called for. Surely, you’ll imagine, it will fade to a mild embarrassment eventually. You’ll get over it. You’ll still be addicted to him, after all. You’ll need him still, the way you do now. So you’ll push the door open, you’ll walk back up the stairs, you’ll put on your calmest face, and you’ll nod to him (still in his dressing gown, still lying on the sofa) without actually looking at him. Best not to, isn’t it?
“No.” He’ll say it fast. “Of course not. Not my area.”
John will keep talking to Mycroft, and then Lestrade when he comes back, but you'll have hardly moved. You'll be thinking,
“Why would you do that, Sherlock?”
No syringes. You’ll have promised him.
You’ll kiss him far longer than you’re imagining you could, given that you’ll be in public, standing at a bar. It will be crowded and busy, but in that moment, you won’t care. Until suddenly you will, because someone will nudge into you by accident, and you’ll have to take a step back and away from him. Then you’ll get a good look at where you are, and who you’re with, and what you’ve been up to, and you’ll piece it all together. Finally. Just like that and it’s done: you’ll be romantically involved. A couple, like everyone always said you were. You’ll sleep in his bed from then on. All because of one spur-of-the-moment kiss, interrupted by some stranger’s elbow.
Because it’s felt like you’ve been lying your whole life, in a way, hasn’t it? You know what I’m talking about. Oh, but people don’t say that about you, is that right? They get upset that you just say whatever’s on your mind? They say you’re too honest, do they? Don’t try and pretend with us, it won’t work. Tactlessness isn’t honesty, it’s armor. It’s a disguise. The scarf and the coat are part of it for you, somehow. It’s not the wind you turn your collar up against, and you know it.
Thanks so much for the tea! Though, to be honest, it was a little cool. And rather...strong. Not complaining! Just mentioning!
“Don’t you?” A good counter.
It will click, and stick in your throat, and you’ll swallow against it.
And there’s two seconds gone. John will stare at you.
Someone will struggle to get past him at one point, so you’ll reach out and grab him to shift him out of the way. That’s how you’ll end up with a hand on his waist, resting on the small of his back, hidden under his coat. His skin will feel invitingly warm. That will be the first time it will occur to you that something else might be going on between you and him.
being with her was the stumbling block? It’s a little bit hypocritical of you, don’t you think? You ask him to share you, even now, but you really can’t bear to share him. Not with anyone. Even the idea makes your stomach turn, doesn’t it.
What he’ll finally say is this: “Is it done?” A tight almost-whisper. You’ll want to answer, but you won’t understand the question. He’ll impatiently plow ahead, finding it easier to speak now that he’s started: “The… game. Or whatever. Moriarty’s plot, your plot. Is it all finished, can you talk about it?” You’ll have expected anger, but not about this. And it will build so quickly. John will sweep his eyes across the flat. “Are there, what, cameras still?”
Yes, you’re right: I did say the two of you ending up together was inevitable, didn’t I. This story doesn’t seem to be going in that direction. Well, hold on. I’m not finished yet.
There should be something you can say to that, and you’ll mean to find it. But before you can answer, he’ll inhale sharply, and his next word will fight being spoken: “Why–”
But you were right the first time around, as it turns out. Weren’t you? It will seem like it, anyway. John didn’t kiss you back.
The fact that you’re standing close enough to kiss him won’t even occur to you, not at first. It will feel absolutely unremarkable that you’re standing so close together at the bar. It will feel completely natural to you, because by then, it will be completely natural. It will seem like nothing earth-shattering and life-changing is going on at all.
On the mouth, I mean. It won’t be difficult; his face will be exactly in the right place to make it easy for you. Not that he’ll have meant it that way. Though maybe some part of him will have. It’s hard to say, really. In retrospect, he won’t be entirely certain about that himself.
You’ll smile too. “Yes.” You’ll be grateful for it, John’s smile. You’ll shuffle your feet a bit. “Threw him off the roof myself.” You’ll chuckle slightly, and John will join in.
You’ll taste the beer on his tongue. He will be warm and malleable, and will take your direction well. He won’t know what he’s doing, which you’ll sense, but he won’t want you to stop, so you won’t. Sounds nice, doesn’t it? It will be. It will be very nice indeed.
. Things do happen, afterward, yes. Of course they do. We said we were going to tell you the important bits, and that’s what we did. You have quite a lot of sex, if that’s what you want to know.
His brain works quickly, it’s true. But you have to understand that it won’t work quickly for a question like this. Because he won’t be able to bring himself to see that you’re saying what you’ll be clearly trying to say. It’s not that you won’t be obvious about it. It’s that the words themselves will shatter his perception of you, himself, your relationship, and the universe. He doesn’t let himself imagine you would mean what your words mean. It will take him a bit of time to process it. Take what you say and put it in reverse: that’s how he’ll hear it.
You won’t have envisioned losing him quite this way.
“Trying to.” He’ll tilt his head and give one of those slight smiles, the kind that he can’t quite maintain when he’s teasing something out. “Not quite sure where to begin.” A pause. “I’m not sure I’m… clear on all of it.”
That’s when it will click.
“Not someone. Who, John?”
“Is that how Moriarty thought I felt about you?”
There are scenarios where it happens in the middle of a fight, and not just an argument. Where he’s wound you up so much you’ll swing at him, push him up against walls or down onto the floor. And in those scenarios, it will always just fall out of you by accident. You’ll say something you don’t mean to say, you’ll reveal too much. Sometimes he’ll hear it before you’ll even know you’ve said it. Sometimes it will stop the argument dead. Other times it will only make the argument worse. But it won’t ever change the outcome.
You'll sit quietly in the hospital. Sally Donovan will catch Mary when she runs. You'll want to thank her for putting Mary in jail, for not being too rough with her – Mary saved John’s life, in her way – but your thoughts will be too scattered. Everything will be over, but nothing will feel resolved: when John doesn't make sense, nothing does. You'll think it was wishful thinking on your part, and jealousy on Moriarty's. You'll think it, but you won't quite believe it, and that will make it worse. Because you've never thought of yourself as delusional, Sherlock. You strive not to be.
“Dinner?” He’ll say.
But when you realize John thinks you kissed him as some sort of trick, that you were just messing with his mind, that’s when you know: You’re one of those people who hurts the people you love. It’s not all killing bad guys, after all. You won’t stay entirely above the fray, no. You’ll slide nearly all the way down that slope. You won’t know what other choice you had, but you can’t deny you’ve deceived him. The road to hell, as the saying goes. You’ll be sure that’s how John must see you: you’re someone who lies to him, and hurts him. And that is the last thing you’ve ever wanted to do.
He’ll go with you even though he’ll have no interest in the film and actively won’t want to sit through it. He’ll go with you even though he’ll complain the whole way there. The server will make the same assumption about the two of you everyone else always makes. You won’t bother to correct her; what’s the point? It won’t matter what she thinks. It doesn’t matter what anyone thinks, really, does it. Except for you and him.
But it couldn’t be much closer to zero.
So we’ll leave you to your own devices now, yes? And you’ll get on with it? Go on, then. Give us more to talk about won’t you?
There are so many more possibilities I could tell you, John. They’re practically infinite.
The force of it will startle you: “Not if you needed to lie to
“This is not funny,” John will say.
It’s perfectly friendly in the moment, of course. You’re just mates. It will all make sense in context. And he won’t mind. Not at all. All his attention will be focused on you. He won’t care any more about boundaries than he does now. He’ll watch your face, the way you’ll lick your lips, the way your shoulders will angle towards him: it’s all flattery to him, you see. He’ll be at least as drunk on you and your intoxicating reactions to him as he is on anything else that night.
the other with the engraving
"Yes. Greg, I love you so much. You make me so happy. Thank you, my love." Mycroft whispered hoarsely as he pulled Greg off of the floor and kissed him deeply, making sure to keep the ring box steady. After they broke apart, Greg put Mycroft's ring on his finger, then let Mycroft put his ring on. They both admired their new rings before they kissed again.
After looking with squinted eyes at the selection, John made his decision, smiled up at the server, and gave his order.
"Greg, what caused this? What happened?" Greg stayed silent.
The police force could not capture these men soon enough. Mycroft Holmes wanted to go home.
"Look, just because you prefer flavors made for three year olds doesn't mean those are the only flavors people can make! Grow up! Learn to like something more interesting than caramel and bananas!"
"Not this time. Not like this. Remember a few weeks ago when Mycroft was in the flat and he and I had the deduction game with that hat, and he claimed he wasn't lonely? He wasn't lying. John, I just found a ring box with two men's engagement rings in Greg's pocket. One of them has Greg's own initials, but the other's initials are
"I think I do. Anyways, who is it?" Sherlock thought he detected a slight tremor in John's voice, but he, like Greg, didn't want to let himself hope. So he went for cynicism, hoping to push John into making another mistake.
"Hey, My, why don't you come on back to my room. I want to show you something." Greg took Mycroft's hand, pulling him to the bedroom without actually waiting for an answer. Mycroft was slightly confused, but he went along with it, happy to be with Greg. When they got into the room, Greg had him sit on the edge of the bed with his eyes closed. He did as instructed, not wanting to ruin the surprise. He heard some rustling, then he heard Greg clear his throat before speaking again.
"My. I'm not angry. I'm just so thankful you're alive. Sherlock figured it out, just a minute or so ago, actually. I didn't want to let myself hope, but here you are, standing right in front of me. I love you more than anything, and I'm so happy to see you. You are so brave, and beautiful, and absolutely amazing, and I'm so glad you came home to me."
"John, a few months ago, Mycroft and I made an agreement. The moment he admitted to my face that sentiment is not a disadvantage, I would tell the person I love about my feelings. So, to honor my agreement with my brother, I'm going to do something I've never done: share my feelings. John Watson, I'm not bringing a new person into Baker Street. I wouldn't dream of it. The truth is, I'm in love with you. Will you have me as your boyfriend?"
Greg nodded his head as he realized John was right. He then started the trudge back to his bedroom but froze in the entrance hall as his ears recognized the sound of a key in the lock. His mind went numb, but he could feel tingles of hope running through his body, and a heavy knot settled in his stomach as time seemed to stand still. Finally, he heard the lock disengage, the key removed from the lock, and saw the door knob twist. It was the moment of truth; was
"Thanks, mate. It's worse than it looks." Greg tried for his usual flippant tone, but failed miserably, unable to hide the truth in the statement. Greg swayed on his feet after a wave of dizziness swept over him. He reached out and leaned against the door frame until he had recovered.
"Why John, I didn't realize you cared enough to know how I take my coffee!"
here. The door quietly opened just enough for the tall man with dark ginger hair that Greg had been dreaming of to slip in. He hadn't seen Greg. He'd kept his back turned and his eyes downcast as he closed the door silently and re-engaged the lock. He looked so small, so tired, so vulnerable,
"On the count of three, then?" Sherlock replied, and after a nod from Mycroft, he motioned to John to count for them, even though he had no idea what would be said by the brothers.
"Yes, you clot!" John said before he connected their lips in their first kiss. Greg clapped, and Mycroft smiled smugly.
By the end of his monologue, John had started shouting, and everyone around them was staring. In the moment of silence after the yelling, the man behind the counter said what the other patrons were thinking, but were too polite to say.
"Admit to your what? What is he talking about?" John asked Sherlock, unable to stand the silence.
"God, Greg, you look like hell!" John exclaimed a little too loudly for Greg's comfort.
"Greg locked himself inside his office. I don't know why, but all we could hear from outside his door was things being thrown about and what I could have sworn was sobbing for about an hour before all went silent. The silence fell an hour ago. We've all been trying to decide who should go in there to check on him, but none of us feel like getting stuff thrown at our heads. But, I figure you two are close enough to him that you might stand a chance of surviving Greg's wrath. We all agree on one thing, though: whatever happened to cause this wasn't good."
By the end of Sherlock's speech, there were no dry eyes in the room.
"I'm not wrong. I can't be. You have to keep hope, Greg. I have to be right." Sherlock said with a determination he didn't quite feel. Greg just scoffed.
"Greg, I'm so sorry. I found the rings. I wi-I really wish that you could have been my brother-in-law. It's not fair. You should be my brother-in-law. But just like my brother, the moment he finds true happiness, he goes and des- wait a minute, no! That's not Mycroft at all! That's me! Mycroft would never allow himself to die right after finding something so good and lasting as love! Oh, this is good. This is great! Greg, don't give up hope yet: I think Mycroft is still alive! And before you can say anything, just listen to my reasons! Will you at least listen to them?" Sherlock ranted, jumping out of his seat at his revelation. The red flag from before had finally caught his full and undivided attention. Greg and John looked at him skeptically before nodding slowly, curious about what he had to say.
"Wait, Greg. Before you go to bed, I want you to think about something. If Mycroft were to walk through that door right this second, you need to know how you're going to react. You need to examine your current feelings, what you felt when you found out, how you reacted then, and what he's been going through since the shooting. When calculating your feelings, don't forget to add in the fact that he still got shot. I'm sure you've been shot in the vest before. It's not fun. But seriously, it helps if you have an idea of how you're going to react."
, just to see if it was really true. If
"I'd like two scoops of dark chocolate and sea salt in a cup, please."
"Close, Sherlock. Close."
Before Sherlock could go anywhere with that admission, the taxi had arrived in front of Greg's building. John and Sherlock half carried, half drug the weary detective between them up the stairs to the second floor and to the door of Greg's small flat. Greg fished for his keys in his pocket, but he was shaking so badly John had to take the key from him while Sherlock held him upright so John could open the door.
"Greg and Mycroft were together. To the extent that Greg was planning to propose marriage! Sherlock, this is awful! He could have been your brother-in-law! He should have been!" John was shell shocked by the pure injustice of the whole ordeal. He threw another glance at Greg's prone body on top of the bed before walking heavily out of the room to go sit on the couch. Sherlock followed quickly on his heels, his eyes avoiding the man who could and should have become his brother-in-law, the only man who could make his brother happy.
"Nothing. Don't worry about it, John."
"I don't know! Because I'm your-your friend!"
Greg looked at several more of their pictures, all of them reminding him of something else he would never again experience. After a while, he gave up and curled up on his side and cried himself into a fitful sleep there on the floor of his office, thankful the door was locked.
You’re a proper genius and you’ll reason that you can’t stand in the kitchen forever. And you’ll want to see what John is doing on his computer. You won’t be able to help it; you’ve always wanted to know everything about John, and you'll be in no position to resist then. Whatever gets you out of the kitchen, right? We all have our crutches. So you’ll wander past and discretely catch a glimpse of an empty blog entry box. He’s thinking about it, then. Of course he will be. And there you’ll be, still with nothing to do.
! You’re married, of course you are! That’s a vow for the rest of your life, we respect that! Of course!
“Going out?” John will ask. And he’ll look up at you, unwavering. You won’t be able to read anything on his face, and it will take you a moment to understand what he’s asked you.
“Ah,” you’ll say after a moment. “A lot did… happen.” You’ll expect more words to come, but they won’t.
It won't go quite like you expect, telling John you love him, but you've always found it difficult to think about John dying. You know it's a real danger, of course, but contemplating it shuts you down; you prefer to imagine happier scenarios. John will be thrilled, you hope. That could go all sorts of nice places. Sometimes going to those nice places in your mind will be the only way to be patient, to keep lying and keep John safe. Or in your darkest moments, you imagine John will be angry at you for not saying something sooner. For letting him stay with Mary, when you know what you know. You think you could handle that. You're pretty sure it's what you deserve, at any rate. And John has never stayed angry at you for long.
You’ll clear your throat first, and he’ll ignore you. Strop, remember. It will be well on its way by then. You’ll take a gulp of your tea, now cold. You’ll fold the paper in half, then in half again, and put it on the table in front of you.
Don’t laugh! It’s possible. Everything is possible. I’ll tell you how it would go if you were to try. It might appeal to you.
There will be a long, heavy pause. But it will be the easiest silence you’ve ever endured, because John won’t have automatically deflected you. You’ll wait for him. John will glance at you, shut his eyes against tears, and open them again. He’ll meet your gaze but shake his head minutely, a refusal to speak.
“Blogging?” you’ll ask instead. You’ll sound casual enough, to your credit. But you’ll just stand there, all the same.
Come with me.
“Because it’s the truth.” It will sound too quiet, too weak an explanation. And he’ll shut his eyes  and incline his head as if stricken, just for a moment. It will be the wrong thing to say.
Well, hello there, Mr Holmes. How lovely to see you. My colleague and I were just–
He’ll still be in his dressing gown. There will be seven laptops on the coffee table, and you won’t have even thought to ask why. He’ll have been pacing, wringing his hands. He’ll have had a sneaky cigarette while you were gone, and it will be impossible for you not to notice, in spite of the toothpaste and soap trying hard to disguise it. You’ll be too distracted by the pulsing pain in your chest where his rejection stung you to think about what that might mean. He’ll stand up, he’ll turn and face you, even though you can’t bear to look at him.
Do you want to hear it? I won’t make you beg. I could tell you everything; all the possibilities, from least to most likely, if you like.
You’ll be glad for it, because you weren’t quite sure how to get there.
You’ve hated it from the start, after all, lying to John about Mary. For what it’s worth, you won’t have to keep that up much longer. I’ll just tell you that now, to put your mind at ease. John’s clever enough, and when it becomes clear that Moriarty is actually alive, he’ll put two and two together. Snipers aren’t exactly thick on the ground, are they. But that’s another story. The important part is this: you’ll come clean as soon as you can, and aside from keeping your feelings to yourself until Moriarty is out of the picture, you won’t lie to John again. He’ll forgive you, when you tell him about Mary, as he always does. He won’t be happy, as you can imagine, but he’ll accept you had no choice.
It’s alright. He’ll be yours alone, I promise.
Oh, I see. You’re worried you’re going to screw it up, are you? Don’t be. It’s true, you’ll have your ups and downs. Every couple does, but your downs won’t merit much mention. They don’t fundamentally change things. For example, we could tell you that in a moment of impulsivity, you’ll propose to John using the same engagement ring you used for Janine. We could remind you that John has every reason to hate that ring, and that it is, in fact, a woman’s ring. We could warn you that you should not attempt to justify your decision on the grounds that it fits him, and that men with small hands do not like to have attention drawn to said fact.
You can, of course, think about it later. When you have more data. There’s something to be said for that, don’t get me wrong. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. That’s later. You’ll have just confessed your feelings; John won’t want something cerebral and forced. He hasn’t spent years wondering about that side of you. That’s all you’ve ever shown him, and you will have just said that you were done lying. No, it will be good, that first time, that you can hardly process it all. John won’t care about all that. He’s only ever wanted to help you
He’ll return after about twenty minutes fully-clothed with wet hair and a well-scrubbed face. He’ll close all the laptops but one, then go into the kitchen and set up some sort of chemistry experiment. He’ll put his safety goggles on and won’t speak again until supper time.
His eyes won’t leave your face. You won’t have a response – how could you? – so he’ll cut straight to the point.
He’ll tug his dressing gown around him and sulk. He’ll flop down on the sofa and stare at the ceiling, as if you’ve written the answers for him there. He knows you have the answers. He knows you can’t just tell him, either. For once.
His gaze will flick to your mouth, and you’ll tell yourself it didn’t. You’ll have hurt him so badly, you won’t dare presume.
Mrs Hudson will have put out a plate of pastries, so you’ll stalk into the kitchen under the guise of eating one. You’ll realize you’re starving; you couldn’t even think about food at the hospital. John still won’t say anything. It will make you uneasy. You won’t be able to think of anything to say, either. You would offer him a pastry, just to make conversation, but it will seem like a ridiculous thing to say. John will know the pastries are there, he’d eat one if he wanted to. Wouldn’t he? Of course he would. It will feel so stupid.
else: yeah, it’ll help with that. All of that.
I feel I should remind you that you'll like this. It gets worse before it gets better, I'm afraid.
“Yes.”
This will be your moment, if you want to take it.
You’ll spend the day feeling stupid and a bit raw. And disappointed, frankly. Terribly disappointed. I know you won’t admit to it now, but some part of you has always believed that it was only circumstances, an absence of emotional maturity, and a comedy of misunderstandings that’s been keeping you apart. You have always believed that the two of you would grow into each other, eventually, like old trees, and that you would be impossible to untangle ever after. You like that potentiality, don’t you. It’s exquisite, this bizarre love, sitting there just out of your reach, moving towards you with each passing day.
It will just burst out of you: “I love you.” You’ll sound hopeless. You won’t even care how your voice wavers; desperation tends to hit like a flash flood, doesn’t it? And that’ll be the first tear. You’ll feel badly about that, you know, like you don’t deserve to cry, but, well. You’ve always been a crier. And if there were ever something worth crying over, surely it would be this turn of events. You kissed him, and he didn’t believe you. What could possibly convince him? What good is the word of a liar?
It’s such a big moment between you, it really is. I know. What will you be thinking? Will you be seeing all the consequences of this running through your head, ticking through a massive spreadsheet of risk assessment pros and cons? No. Nothing so sophisticated. You aren’t him, after all. Time won’t change that. This is what you’ll be thinking as you make your decision:
I know, I know: I said you were going to like this. What gives? Moriarty will be dead and you’ll still feel like you're being tossed about by a malevolent higher power. God doesn't exist and you'll have already learned that Mycroft is a mere mortal. There will be no one left to toy with you. You'll know that, but the feeling will persist. That’s what feelings do. And that's just what happens, isn't it? Happy endings aren't promised to anyone, you'll think, least of all you. It was stupid to ever believe otherwise.
John will look achingly handsome for someone who just got home from the hospital, I’m sorry to say. It will throw you a bit off-kilter. You won’t want to stare, but won’t you seem nervous if you look away? There’s probably some optimal balance of eye contact. Someone should figure that out. You won’t, though, and it will feel like another thing you didn’t solve in time.
“I don’t know.”
Well, no, I suppose it’s not an ending, if you want to get technical. If you want to get into
was truly gone. If his boyfriend was actually dead. Then he realized how silly that would be, and decided to look at pictures of them instead. He knew they wouldn't make him feel better, but he couldn't stand the idea that the only picture he could conjure of the beautiful man he had the honor of calling his boyfriend was of his final moments, hearing the gunshot ring out, watching as his eyes went wide with shock, and seeing his body drop to the concrete, supposedly dead in minutes.
Sherlock gave up on keeping his deductions to himself, almost hoping that admitting the truth might help Greg feel better.
The man nodded and got to work on their orders. Once both flavors were dished out, the worker placed the two cups with spoons protruding out like antennae behind the cash register.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"I was wrong. Sentiment is not a disadvantage found only in the losing side. There, happy now?"
"That's ridiculous! Sherlock, you should just tell them! If they don't accept your love, they'd be a fool! And I mean that!"
Greg could see the flash of crushing doubt in Sherlock's eyes before it was replaced by a desperate hope.
"Trouble coming up with an answer? How about hearing the question again: why do you want to know?"
"Let's get back to Baker Street, what do you say, John?"
Then, the smallness and vulnerability started fading away as Mycroft put on his work mask. A mask he only uses with Greg when something really bad is happening. The mask scared Greg, and he, in that moment, decided how he was going to greet Mycroft.
"No. Don't you dare. We agreed, no masks. No matter how bad, please no masks, My. Why are you trying to use a mask?" Mycroft went tense, almost as if he was expecting something harder and harsher than what Greg was giving him. Mycroft slowly turned, still not letting himself relax. Greg saw the fear in his eyes and his heart broke.
"Onset of a migraine?" John guessed, and Greg nodded slightly, moving his head as little as possible. John and Sherlock shared a glance of concern before John spoke again.
"Greg, what's wrong? What happened?" John asked while reaching out a steadying arm to the still swaying man, his doctor instincts taking over.
"God, if there was ever a time for me to be wrong, please let it be now. Please don't let me be right about this one. Of all things, not this." Sherlock spoke softly to himself as he rushed over to the discarded jacket laying on the chair, going through the pockets before he found what he was looking for: a small black velvety box. Sherlock opened the box to see two silver rings, one with the engraving
