“You take good care of me,” Cas continues. “My good boy.” Cas reaches out a hand to touch Dean’s as he says it, and Dean’s fork clangs to the plate as he draws back sharply.
Cas is sitting in one of the old leather chairs, reading. He stands as Dean enters. “How are you feeling?”
Dean lets this sit. He doesn’t want to get into a philosophical debate. Knowledge is not the important thing here. The point is that something feels WRONG.
“Faster, Cas,” Dean pants, adding his hand to Cas’s, and they still their hips to find a new rhythm with their hands, holding each other instead of both together, quiet in the loud downpour, wet cloth hitting Dean’s wrist with each motion. Dean comes first, gripping Cas’s shoulder in one hand and his cock in the other as he gasps into Cas’s lips, body tight and shuddering and then loose. He doesn’t wait to come down, just picks his hand’s pace back up again, rubbing Cas quick and hard while Cas runs his hands through Dean’s wet hair. Dean kisses Cas’s open, dripping mouth, drinking rain from his lips until he comes almost silently—or maybe that was the rain, eating up Cas’s breath and carrying it down into the Texas earth.
They stare at each other for another minute, and Dean comes to understand that Cas isn’t going to invite himself to sit. He must be waiting for Dean to shoot him, or tell him to get the hell out of town, but Dean can’t bring himself to do much of anything except stare.
“You do?” Cas asks, and he likes that, Dean can hear it in his tobacco voice, tilting up higher than usual.
that’s why he’d been thinking about it. He wants to prove that he can touch Cas, touch him and control him and not hurt him while he’s at it. He wants to give Cas a feeling to connect to him that isn’t a sudden pain in his back. “We don’t got to,” he says after a minute in which Cas doesn’t say anything. “Can fuck instead. I just—“
He can’t sleep, he can’t drive, he can’t pace around his room all night. “This is what I want,” he says, keeping his voice level.
“‘Castiel’ will do,” Cas grumbles, pressing his thumb against Dean’s taint, and Dean doesn’t have the energy to laugh.
says the jackass part of him again, but Cas, being Cas, doesn’t explain himself, and Dean, being Dean, doesn’t ask. He eyes Cas’s fingers instead. He isn’t wearing a wedding ring. Did Jewish folks wear wedding rings?
“Yeah, uh. The old Singer place. You remember I told you about Bobby? Anyway, ain’t nobody living there right now. It ain’t modern like this, or big. Bobby only kept horses. About five acres. Kinda run down, but. Anyhow, it’s free.”
“You filthy hypocrite,” he says. “Betrayer of betrayers. Cain to my Abel. Can’t you see the monster you’ve become?”
Cas stares at him, in that unsettling way he had. Somehow Dean had thought his memory must have been exaggerating that look, but no, there it was, strong as ever. Like Cas was looking straight into him til he felt more than naked. “What happened?” Cas asks him, like a goddamned psychic.
Dean gathers up his spending money for the month—he’s been able to save since he paid Sister Jo off, though less than normal, since he had to cover for Bela on the bar, and John did get ten dollars from him a week ago—and goes to the bakery. They agree to sell him some starter. Dean knows they give it away to some folks, but pays up anyway. If they don’t like him, they don’t like him. It wasn't the day to get in a fight. He asks if they have any cracker recipes, and they say no.
“I’m sorry,” says the kid, surprisingly polite. He looks up at Dean and gets this excited expression on his face. “Are you a real cowboy?”
“You read Calamity Jane?” The kid didn’t look older than six or seven, not old enough, really, to be reading those things.
Dean elbows him off. “Alright. Went to a lot of trouble for that coffee, you know. Go on and drink it. You can kiss me later.”
Dean winks down at Jack. “That means ‘yes.’ Morning’s the best time of day to ask for anything you want. Quick, ask for something else.”
Cas doesn’t seem to be capable of answering, so Dean comes and puts a hand on his shoulder, kneeling beside him. “Nice people ain’t always good, and good people ain’t always nice. Your daddy’s big brother was a good person. He saved Cas, when Cas was in trouble, and he saved me, too. He was kinda like you, actually. Smart as a whip and loyal as a hound.”
Dean’s heartbeat begins to slow. Cas didn’t care about turning tricks. Cas didn’t find any of this shameful. Cas was more than that. Cas was eyes like the sky: perfect blue in the sun and glittering black at night. Cas was light and sound and sanity. Cas was the universe.
“Not everyone,” Dean objects, throwing their purchases in the backseat. “I see Lorna and Len, like. Every week, at least. They’re good people. What, you don’t want to be social?”
It’s too good to be true. Cas must have changed his mind. Or maybe he’d said those things in the spur of the moment, not really understanding them. He couldn’t have meant it.
Cas hums again, rolling and stretching beneath Dean, as if to remind him that their dicks are pressed together. “Is that really what you’re most interested in?”
The second week, travel slowly starts to get harder again, and Dean begins to realize that it’s due to a slight uphill climb. The land becomes pockmarked with little hills and mesas, and seemingly overnight there are little round bushes everywhere. They have a windy day, and Dean and Baby delight in running around and through the tumbleweeds together, watching a dust devil kick up and toss the dry plants high into the sky. Two days from Santa Fe, he can swear he sees mountains on the horizon, and one day out he for sure can, big and green and impossibly huge. Dean’s seen pictures, of course, but after spending his whole life in a place flatter than a train track, it doesn’t seem right, for the ground to rise up like that, cutting a shape into the horizon like it has a right to the sky.
Dean turns away from him. There’s lantern light ahead. “That’s why you don’t like me whoring?” he asks. “‘Cause it’s dangerous?”
Dean’s dimly away of Charlie between them, trying to speak reason, but he’s making eye contact with Adam over her head and he sees an anger there he knows too well. “I didn’t run off,” he says.
“You gonna hang me, sir?” It’s irrelevant to whatever the hell is going on. The sheriff could arrest him anytime. Dean’s done more than enough illegal shit to warrant a hanging already, and they both know it.
“You’re not.” Cas is still holding his hand between them on the mattress. He’s soft and warm and they’re not touching anywhere but their hands. They’d never done that before. They’d never get to do it again.
Cas pauses with his frock in hand. He shoots Dean this sort of resigned ‘we-both-know-where-this-is-heading’ sort of look. “Are you going to call the police?” he asks.
“She’s gonna be giant.” Dean steps up onto a rung of the stall door, just to get as close to her as he can get.
He thinks about Cas, naked on the other side of the wall. How he’d look covered in running water, it dripping down his pale skin, his hands—
No, the hardest part, now just as it was the first time, is sleeping. Every night, without fail, Cas follows his routine dutifully (several articles on the internet recommend this)— he brushes his teeth, flosses, showers, urinates, and gets dressed in the old shirt and sweat pants that Dean had given him. Then he goes to ‘his’ room (he’d never actually had a room in the bunker before; he’d never needed one), turns out the light, and lies down in the bed. He’s seen humans do it often enough, watched Dean turn onto his side in a motel bed, one arm beneath his pillow, his other hand gripping the blanket tight. Cas copies that posture now, trying it on as he tried on so much else to do with humanity.
“Never really wanted it. Was just being lazy, growing it out.” He’d been bedridden for months, then depressed for months more. He hadn’t been able to so much as look in a mirror, much less take care of himself. It had been Adam and Krissy taking care of him for a change. They’d meant to be kind, but it had hurt his pride, having them do it. He hadn’t put much thought into his appearance since.
Cas doesn’t respond, just keeps rubbing at his palms until long after they feel better, until Dean grabs his hands and holds them there. Cas looks up in surprise, eyes wide and innocent. Like he had no idea at all what he was doing to Dean.
Cas shakes his head against the pillow. “I didn’t mean this. I never thought it could be like this.”
He didn’t need to say it again. Cas had told him it was okay not to. Cas knew it already; Cas’s weird new confidence was evidence of that.
Dean pants in Cas’s ear. He hadn’t meant to lose his head like that. He stands and helps Cas up. Cas comes closer, and Dean lets him, but protests in his ear as he sucks his neck.
“Yeah, you— you’re right.” He quiets down, shuts his fat mouth. “You know, I— I bet he would’ve liked the idea of you going to school, if he’d’ve thought we could afford it.”
“Thank you.” Cas sucks a bruise into him, a few inches from his cock, which is perking up with interest now. They didn’t have time for much of this teasing, but Dean doesn’t say it. He likes the confident look in Cas’s eye. “You know I wondered,” says Cas. “It’s intimidating, being with you when you have so much experience. And then you sent that letter and I wondered.” Cas takes Dean’s dick in hand, still mouthing only at his thighs, sucking a few more burgundy bruises into Dean’s skin, but giving him a gentle pump, too. Dean pets his hair, waiting for his mouth to become free again, waiting for more of that God-given sound. Cas sucks his thigh harder, breaking from him with a loud smacking sound. “You don’t get sucked off very often, do you?”
It’s a shout that wakes him. He’s groggy, confused. It takes him a moment to recognize the noise he’s hearing as his own name. He looks up and there’s Dean Winchester, smiling at him. Impossible.
Dean nods again and tries to stop the pounding in his chest. Jo was fine. They were all fine. Except for Rufus, anyway. He moves behind the bar and pumps himself a glass of water to chug.
Tagg isn’t even there, as far as Dean can see, just a few other dusty vaqueros, but he follows Balthazar anyway to sit at one of the parlor tables. Balthazar pulls out a deck of cards and they play a few rounds of hold ‘em using coins from Dean’s pocket to bet, with each coin counting for a meal owed. Poor Bal’s face furrows more and more with consternation as he loses more and more of his allotment of change, but Dean isn’t even paying much attention, trying to listen to and watch Cas without Balthazar noticing him at it. Cas is playing something cheery, though his face is wrinkled in a frown. He looks good at a piano, serious but poised. Dean’s always found it magical when anybody played any kind of music; he was useless at it himself. There hadn’t been a single instrument in the Winchester house growing up, unless you counted the spoons or the washboard.
Cas can feel the sun on his face. His arms are still thrown around Jack and Dean, and as he opens his eyes Jack peels off away from them.
Cas’s hands find Dean’s sides. He breathes out, heavily and long against Dean’s back. “You’re alive. For that, we must be grateful. I am grateful. You’re speaking to me,” he adds, like he can’t believe it.
“Here’s what we’re gonna do. I’m gonna shop around,” says Dean, “for real. When I get back to Abilene. Gonna shop around for jobs for you and Bal. Charlie will help, and the girls. All together we know a lot of people. Just about everyone in town, I reckon.”
Poor guy had probably been working literally 24/7 on Heaven bullshit that other angels ought to be doing without him. He always worked too hard, especially when he was alone.
“Not that you don’t know me, just that… the Castiel that he knew and the Castiel that you know; they’re different people. I’ve changed in the last six months. You changed me, Dean.”
It’s a good rule, for roadhouse bathrooms and truck cabs, for guys who are already horny and who have cash in hand. But for Cas— for Cas, who’s a virgin, for Cas, who probably isn’t even into him, for Cas, who is a freaking angel of the Lord— Cas deserves foreplay.
“Sure. Can do whatever I want. Most folks don’t care, anyway. Just lookin’ to get off. Not everybody has your imagination.” Dean winks.
Dean can feel himself softening, and tells himself it’s the beer. Cas finishes his lecture apologetically, as if realizing only then that he’d been talking about bugs for fifteen minutes. Dean steals Cas’s nearly-full beer as payment. The reckless side of him is getting louder, but it could use a little help. Two was his limit, so two it would be. He takes a big swig, and puts the glass down determinedly.
Oh. Dean nods weakly. Now he’s the one who can’t seem to make eye contact. “Me, too,” he says, and ducks out the door.
Cas holds his hands out to his sides, as if something might come to him. “Nothing,” he admits finally. “Listening,” he adds lamely.
Cas draws a thumb across Dean’s lower lip, his eyes sharp and dark. “Is it different, if I’m the one doing it?”
Then Dean speeds up, and so does Cas’s breathing; he’s whispering Dean’s name breathily, eagerly, little ‘pleases’ punctuating the ‘Deans’ and then he gasps sharply and his dick pulses on Dean’s tongue. His hand tightens, petting Dean’s head as he rides it out, and then releases him to drop back against the wall.
“And I thought you wanted it slow,” Cas counters, steadying out in his new rhythm now. His cock is dragging inside of Dean, brushing repeatedly against that spot— fuck. It’s starting to be good. It’s starting to be really good.
Dean thinks wistfully of a camera. That couldn’t be anywhere close to Charlie’s price range. “All the man ever wants is a bath and some— oh. Coffee.”
He was going to come. They’d barely fucked yet and he was going to come. “Get out,” Dean tells him. “Get out, get out.”
Cas stares at the kid, and shit, the sadness in his eyes. Dean’s kicking himself for bringing it up.
“I heard about last night,” he says finally. “Awful stuff. I didn’t realize he— I’m sorry I never— Anyway, I, uh, I came to give you this.”
Benny would just talk to them, gruff but gentle, somehow not needing innuendo at all to get his point across, but Dean preferred a more showy tact, usually giving them a wink and enough proximity to slap his ass. He was pretty good at talking, too. He liked to flirt with the men, though it had gotten him hit more than once. For the boys’ customers, once their suspicions were confirmed, Dean or Benny would send them to Jo, who’d rent them a private room.
Dean is STUNNED speechless. Guilt overwhelms him. Jack holds out his arms for a hug. Dean shakes his head.
It’s wide open. An invitation. Cas isn’t stupid. His voice comes out dry and rough. “How do you generally use it?”
“It’s our first date,” Cas observes, hoping stating the obvious will get them back on the same page. That’s what this was, right?
that’s just… been beaten out of you. You’re whipped, Cassie. They’ve tamed you. They’re not your friends, they’re your owners and you’re their pet. You’re their little angel on a string.”
Cas can see the future ahead of them, one full of secrets, one where Jack has to lie for them, where Dean with a stern word gets them both to stay silent forever, avoiding the truth for no reason, forever. He can see the weight of shame hanging over their heads, forever. It’s awful.
Dean crawls eagerly onto him and goes ahead and kisses him without waiting for permission. He kisses him good and deep, and when he breaks away, Cas seems much calmer.
“Yes, I— I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” Dean hands him a hanky, and Cas just holds it, not bothering with his face. “I missed you,” he whispers.
“Howdy, boys,” says Dean, coming round from the bar to meet them, a smile spreading across his face. “Balthazar,” he acknowledges as the man wordlessly pushes past him into the room. Blue eyes meet his as Cas removes his hat.
“Yeah,” Dean laughs. “She had a blast with it, too. I don’t reckon they knowed how right they was. But, yeah, she’s good. She’s in jail right now, but she likes it that way, for the publicity, you know. She’s fighting the good fight.”
Cas indulges him. They almost overflow the tub, they’re paying so little attention. Dean feels both calm and energized; Cas’s touch is relaxing and steady, but the promise of more makes him jittery, the excitement of having Cas there is almost too much to bear. He steps into the bath and is surprised when Cas moves away to the bed before coming to join him, both sets of letters in hand. They wash each other like old times and read their old letters to each other; Dean has much more (and much raunchier) material in his book than Cas does in his little folder. He reads Cas’s letters back to him and, much to his delight, they make Cas blush. Dean doesn’t tease him for it too much, just kisses him until he calms down and then reads more smut in his ear til he’s hard in the water. He gives him a squeeze.
“I miss him,” says Dean. “Not— not like the last time I saw him, or even before that. Before Momma died, though. He— I mean, looking back, I know now, that he was a bastard all along, but, I didn’t know it back then. And he had time for me, you know? He had time, to teach me to ride and rope, and— I guess I’m gonna have to do those things now, for a living. I guess he won.”
“I done figured it out,” says Tagg after Dean raises. “Dean looks at Smiley when he’s got jack-shit. He’s bluffing.”
and then the words are cut off by a low moan that in turn is cut off by a short gasp. Cas’s thumb tightens in Dean’s mouth as he thrusts deeply into Dean, drawing out a tiny whimper from him, Cas’s muscles quivering against Dean’s body, spent, as if he’d used everything he had just in that moment. He gasps as he comes, then slows the roll of his hips, and stops.
“Yeah, Cas. More is required than attendance. For one thing,” Dean says, sinking onto the mattress next to him and handing him his watered-down whiskey, “you gotta drink.” He sits there expectantly. Cas looks at him seriously.
Dean looks away. It’s true, but this feels different. He doesn’t want to kill himself. He doesn’t want to kill Sam. It doesn’t feel like fighting. What if it goes wrong?
Of course Jo initially dismisses him out of hand. “It’s not for clients, and if it was, we’d have to start charging for soap.”
I promise multiple pov's of the same scene aren't going to be a ~thing~ in this fic, but the boys' experiences were so disparate here I had to do it.
Dean remembers suddenly. Cas wasn’t doing this for him, Cas wasn’t feeling anything for him. He was supposed to be doing Cas a favor, and yet Cas’s arousal was bucking forward into nothing but air. Which made Dean less than a two-dollar whore.
He’s coming, that has to be what’s happening, he’s breathing so hard, he’s riding Cas, he’s going insane, he can’t think straight, there are fireworks inside of him, it’s so
Cas slowly speeds up and draws more and more words from him until Dean is gripping Cas by the hair and gasping and cursing and warning him to get off he’s about to come— but Cas keeps going and then Dean’s making a goddamn embarrassing-as-hell sound as he comes in Cas’s mouth. Cas pulls off of him slowly and swallows everything down without missing a beat. His eyes return to Dean’s.
You destroyed everything you ever loved. Everything you worked so hard for. All of your children. You nearly destroyed your own sister.
He’s still the same way, though the hour that constitutes ‘early’ has changed. He gets up right away, though, has to do something immediately or else he feels like a mess.
“It’s as good as an ‘I love you,’ trust me. Thought Daddy done turned little Jo against me, but she turned up in the middle of the night a few weeks ago, just needing company. She’s a sweet thing, really.”
The store is fucking awesome— rows and rows of hats and boots, with choices he’d never even thought of: a million different types of colors, embroidery patterns, types of leather.
“I’ll take whatever you can get me.” Charlie slumps in her seat. Girl couldn’t hold her alcohol for shit.
While Cas puts Jack to bed, Dean goes back to his room and paces. He hasn’t felt these nerves in so long; in his chest, his stomach, in the balls of his feet. He’s never felt anything like what he’s felt for Cas, not in ten years of trying. He undoes the top button of his shirt, decides that’s too cocky, and does it back up again.
They fall silent. There’s singing in the church, and piano. Dean thinks of that piano piece Balthazar had played, of attending a funeral and seeing yourself lying there in the box. What would he see, if they let him in there?
“All told, I received a number of death threats today, and I was happy to get them. They all care about you, Dean. More than you realize. I just wanted you to know.”
“How are we going to keep John from taking the horse back? What’ll he do, when he finds out you took her?”
Dean had kept his knees together just to hear Cas say it. He spreads, and Cas kneels in between his legs. Cas runs his hands up Dean’s thighs and back down again, tickling his leg hair.
“Cas!” barks Dean, causing Jack to jump in his seat and Sam to collapse into laughter. Jack stares at Cas in confusion. Sam starts signing to Eileen while nearly doubled over, and she laughs, too, smiling over at Cas.
“Can fuck my mouth if you want,” Dean murmurs. Rolling over is too difficult— just moving his hips is too difficult, but he can keep lying here still while Cas has his way with him. Assuming they don’t fight over it again.
“If you don’t talk to him, he’ll find you out anyway, I’m sure, like the rat he is. There’s no point in holing up here. Dean?” Balthazar again looks to Dean expectantly.
They stand there quietly. A clock ticks on the wall. Dean tries to find his breath. He feels raw, cut open and bloody. The pain is overwhelming, and he can’t find the hate to numb it with.
“What?” Cas pants. Dean pulls his fingers out slowly and wipes them on the blanket Cas had laid down. He scoots up by Cas’s face and kisses him.
Chuck telepathically throws Sam against the wall. He SNAPS, and Mohinder disappears into nothingness.
But Cas just takes him by the jaw and says, “No. You gave me hope. You gave me identity. You gave me your loyalty and your trust, and with those things you’ve earned mine.” Cas lowers his hand. “For the first time, I…. I’ve never had anyone like that before. You told me yesterday, that I was one of the only things you’ve ever wanted that you didn’t already have. I think maybe I’ve spent my whole life searching for something to want, and now that I’ve found you, I never want to be parted from you again. Is that what love is?”
Dean looks up at him to see that same old Cas look. Sincerity coming out his ass. Faith that defied reason. “Here’s hoping.” Dean clears his throat and looks around again. “You got other rooms in this place?”
Sparks are flying. There’s a being that he doesn’t yet trust telling him to have faith, that good things do happen. Dean smiles despite himself. This is where it changed, he thinks. Chuck’s plan. None of them knew it yet. Dean watches himself, defiant, defensive. Unwilling to believe. Castiel stares at him, realization in his eyes. He examines Dean closely, speaks quietly, “You don’t think you deserve to be saved.”
“Dean.” Cas’s hand grips his side tightly. “You’re obviously not fine. Don’t— I can’t do this again.”
Maybe a smile flickers across Cas’s face, or maybe Dean imagines it. Either way, he sits on the stool next to Dean. “If invited to.”
And that’s what he did for five years, until a greenhorn cowboy came in one day and changed the beat of the heart in Dean’s chest.
“Mm.” Dean sucks him briefly as he thinks and then pops back off. “Why don’t you fantasize for me, sweetheart? Pretend you’re somewhere nice and cozy and doing whatever it is you want to do. Tell me about it.”
Dean puckers, and so Cas works his tongue into him— Dean’s prayer had involved more than tongues, but Cas doesn’t think they have the materials for that. This would have to be good enough. He slides himself in and out of Dean, losing momentum with his hand, focused on this one task. Dean shudders above him, curse words trailing off, until finally Cas hears from above a quiet, pleading, “Castiel.” And then, “Please.”
It distracts her nicely. She pushes his shoulder, hard, and he lets her, and she insists she doesn’t talk that much, not compared to him, and he laughs at her, and she loses track of the conversation, and brightens up like she’s got an idea. “Hey. Reckon we should give him something. Cas.”
Dean lets the silence sink in. He isn’t sure what Cas means, exactly, but he has an idea. Cas is ashamed of wherever he’s living, or maybe he isn’t living anywhere at all. Guilt settles deep in his stomach. Dean nods.
Cas lets go and crawls back around until he’s on top of Dean. He kisses Dean’s cheek. “What is it?” he asks.
Cas’s expression loses its edge, and he nods before turning to the window once again. Dean feels so alone.
“Yes, sir.” But one of the letters where Cas talked about that was the same one with his daddy’s profession written in it. “Sir, those ain’t— those ain’t pertinent.” He’s shivering, now. Actually shivering with anxiety.
“You’re a yellow-bellied, lily-livered, chickenshit, flighty, harebrained miscreant, that’s what! You high-tail it three ways from Sunday with Daddy’s new horse, and we’re stuck here cleaning up your mess, and Jo stood up for you, did you know that?”
Cas hums again, but deeper, an excited sort of sound. His hand picks back up and Dean’s just happy he didn’t say anything stupid. “In that case,” Cas grumbles. “In that case, I have to tell you how magnificent you are.”
“You alright?” Dean is finally able to ask. Cas’s hair tickles against his ear as he nods. It’s followed by lips. A hand runs through Dean’s hair. “Cas, I—“
The pain doesn’t let up; it feels like Michael is trying to shoot through his forehead. Maybe he was. Maybe a searing white light was going to burst through Dean’s skull at any second and start killing the world. The banging comes through so regularly and so sharply that Cas—devastatingly handsome, love of his life, angel of the goddamn Lord
“Son of a bitch.” Dean drops his head, staring into his lap. His hand closes around the little derringer. Hadn’t he had a rough enough day?
“Who are you supposed to be?” says Meg’s voice from the hall, and Dean groans disapproval. Some gentleman caller or snake oil salesman for Bela, probably, who was sleeping up in her room like the princess she thought she was, and, as always, blissfully ignorant of the inconvenience she was putting them to on the first floor. Dean rolls over and falls back asleep.
it’s still too slow to be great, but it’s good and getting better. There’s a pressure building in him and Dean can easily see the potential for once they really get going. Shit, he can imagine them going at it, this same feeling, but more. Cas groans above him as they find the rhythm together, rolling their hips into each other, small smacks punctuating the still room.
“Take it up with Sister Jo,” says Dean, a weak joke that makes neither of them laugh. “I ain’t supposed to negotiate price.”
“We got, uh. Peanuts. And some cracker things from the store ain’t bad. And Donna made this cornmeal, uh, well she done called it a hash but it’s more like a log—”
Warnings: not actually that sad! I had fun! Not explicit! Sure there's a little angst but who can get that sad when Crowley's around! And Cas irrationally hates him!
Below the windowsill, something brushes against his hand. Dean looks down. Bela’s handing him a pistol. Dean shakes his head. John is still staring up at him, and some part of Dean’s brain that’s focused on survival notes that John has a pistol, too, his big-ass, old-ass Colt Navy holstered to his waist.
“Maybe!” Dean explodes. It hadn’t been about the horse, until it was. It had been about getting away from this exact mess. It had been about
“There, now. Feeling better?” Dean shifts over to pet Cas’s hair, dark and still a little wet, starting to curl now as it dries. “Hold up. There’s water here somewhere.” Dean reaches around the bed and finds the jug there, giving it to Cas to sip from. Cas shifts around onto his back to drink.
Every year since he was four, it’s been like this. Every year, there are new ghosts. The old ones never leave. And he’s lived so long now, longer than expected; he knows he’s living on borrowed time. Soon there will be too many ghosts to bear.
The stupid man wasn’t thinking straight. “I don’t like it,” Dean says. “Who is this boy? What could be so important he’s hunting you down all the way out here?”
But Dean’s followed him across the room. He wipes a tear from Cas’s face and kisses him there. “Thank you, darlin’. Thank you.” He wraps his arms around Cas’s waist and holds him close, and they rock in place, unwilling to let go. “Ain’t held together by twine, you and me,” Dean whispers in Cas’s ear. “You know that, don’t you?”
“Huh. Well, get over it, Sammy.” Dean breaks out into a smile and toasts at Sam with his water glass. “I’m fine, you’re fine, Cas is alive, Chuck is a normal-ass skeezeball. We won. Time to get some fucking sleep.”
ps can you imagine being a salesman and these two married home of sexuals walk into your store and one of them is LARPing as a country boy who plans to LARP as a cowboy and the other one is just Done with everything. I, too, would keep the store open late and grift them for all they were worth.
A moment later, a naked Dean is dragging Cas to the bed and throwing him down onto it. Dean climbs on top of him, prayers so loud, so close, pleading, his mouth wide and desperate on Cas’s. Dean’s need is infectious, flowing through Cas’s grace, and so Cas does the only thing that makes sense: he gives in to Dean’s will.
“All due respect, Dean, I ain’t the bad guy here, and I’d appreciate a little truthfulness from you. Now what sin goes on inside this house I don’t concern myself with, because Miss Anael is a good citizen, and she gives to lots of charities around town,—”
“Need— your— cock,” Dean manages to get out in between gasps, and Cas flies off him and onto his lips, rising from the floor and onto his knees and knocking Dean’s hat askew. Then they’re fumbling at each other, lifting Dean’s leg, lining Cas up, the bed so low they can fuck just like that, and a second later they are, Cas pushing into him and Dean moaning and squirming at the awkward angle, trying to move his torso back and his hips forward even while Cas, groaning and kissing at his chest, starts pumping into him, but it’s not deep enough, and then Dean upsets their balance and they’re falling, with a thud, onto the wooden floor.
Dean leans down to kiss Cas’s forehead. As he moves, the room slips sideways. He grips onto Cas. “Cas—!”
Jo’s fears get more prominent as she talks. She focuses on Krissy, and on her own feelings of betrayal, on how she’d hate to be married to some smelly old man and have to clean his house, and Dean starts to understand a bit better.
Dean amends, silently, to himself. Dean pulls back, looks Cas in the eye. He looks confused, scared. Not far off from where he was in the brothel. God, he’s probably hating this. The hell was Dean doing.
Cas kisses the nape of his neck and his hand presses on the front of Dean’s chest, holding him tightly. He doesn’t make a move to do anything else. Dean takes Cas’s hand in his again, a little selfish gesture.
He can’t see in the dark, but she must roll her eyes at him before she lies back down. He packs the cigarette in his bag and looks down again at the coffee in his hand. He isn’t even sure they can make coffee on the range. It must take a long time to boil water. He decides to leave it where it is, in his box under the bed next to a stack of dime novels. He’s coming back for it, anyway.
“And since when are you all about blind faith? Huh?” Dean gets up and stands over Cas, leaning his ass against the library table next to Cas’s book. “You know what I think?” He smiles down at his angel. “I think you’re sad, ‘cause once I get a handle on this thing, you’re not gonna have all-inclusive access to those juicy Dean thoughts anymore.”
When they finally do break apart, Cas is crying, and Dean immediately starts kicking himself for whatever fool thing he’d done.
“Fine,” she’d said. “I’ll let you move in today. Talk to Benny, follow him once you’re feeling up to it, and no touching yet, hear? Just watch. It’s five dollars a week, plus half what you bring in. I’ll warn you again; that’s a girl’s wage, and not a lot of men come here expecting boys. I pay Benny more for security than whoring, but I can’t afford to pay you what I pay him.”
Dean has to stop reading just at that. My darling. Written in pen, in black, looping cursive. Hell if he ain’t smiling like a schoolgirl. My darling. Shoot.
had made him stupid. He’d pulled Cas onto the bed, not caring that Cas didn’t care, hoping that maybe he might— “Okay, so I started it,” Dean admits. But Cas had done things they’d never done before that night. He’d acted in ways he never had before. He’d put Dean off his guard, rendered him totally helpless. “But I didn’t ask for, you know—“ He can’t even say it.
“Alright.” They both fall quiet. Dean plays with Cas’s hand. His jealous man. “I’ll think about you when I come,” Dean offers. “Nobody will know a thing. I’ll just call out, ‘darlin’, darlin’,” Dean says, in a breathy voice, “‘fuck me, darlin’,’ and I’ll mean you.”
Every evening, he stole away to a room that wasn’t his. Every night, he was held in another’s arms. Every morning, he snuck through the halls so no one would see him go.
Start on Cas. Cas is on the run from quite a few angels, and so has been traveling with Jack and a small group of humans for the time being. Jack ran ahead to get Dean, leaving Cas waiting, quiet. Nervous. RECOGNITION as he sees Dean, offscreen. Cas moves away from the group towards Dean and Jack.
“The chaos is making it difficult to tell what, if anything has changed. One thing we can guess is that at least some monsters came back, too. There’s a case in Missouri— vics drained, throats torn out.”
Cas rolls over to watch as Dean gathers his pajamas from the dresser, glances up at Cas, and leaves the room with the bundle of clothes, turning the light back out as he does so.
“Thieving cowboy,” Dean whispers back. It sends shivers up his back, being pinned by Cas like this, being alone in the dark. Maybe he can be better this time; he doesn’t have that jittery feeling from before, like at any moment he might break.
“Well, I will take that into consideration. Sweet thing.” Dean kisses Cas’s side. “Darling man. Handsome cowpoke.” Dean keeps talking soft and sweet, til Cas grabs at his hand, a silent request to stop, and then he shuts up, and before he knows it, his eyes are closed, too.
Dean wakes in the small hours of the morning. Someone has tucked him into bed, fully dressed except for his shoes. There’s a glass of water on his nightstand that he immediately chugs. He’s not in pain, exactly, but he feels raw and hungry, like he had when he’d crawled out of his own grave. Like Cas had rebuilt him from scratch last night. Maybe he had.
Castiel’s eyes flick to his, then back to the paper. “Stay still,” he murmurs again, though Dean is sure he didn’t move.
Cas pumps him faster, sitting up now, still pressed against his crotch and looking over him with dark eyes. “Whose whore are you?” he asks, perfectly, that voice going straight to Dean’s dick.
Cas releases Dean’s mouth, hand falling to the floor beside his head. He comes lower, resting his forehead against Dean’s. Dean works his hands under the back of Cas’s shirt and around his torso as they both breathe. He scratches at Cas’s skin lightly, a smile starting to play on his lips.
“This—this is too much,” Dean protests finally, desperately, holding the check out at her as she walks by.
The girls had the more straightforward job. Men came in, found one they liked, paid Sister Jo, and they ran off upstairs. That, or the men found Sister Jo, told her what they liked, she chose a girl for them, and they ran off upstairs. The boys had a little dance to do first. Most customers didn’t even realize Dean and Benny were on the menu, and it was true that, often as not, they were working the door or the bar instead, making themselves look tough and throwing out troublemakers.
A few minutes later they leave the store weighted down by paper shopping bags. The sun had set while they were shopping; Jack and Sam must have eaten dinner by now.
“You’re alright,” Cas whispers in his ear, and Dean comes back to the sensation of a warm hand tugging his cock. “You can tell me.”
“We’ve rented a couple of rooms in the inn over on Sunrise. You can stay with me, if you like. But you should talk to him.”
Cas grips Dean’s thighs tightly and thrusts into him hard, pumping faster and faster until Dean can’t keep up, can’t grind or move or even push with his feet. He just falls back into the mattress, getting railed within an inch of his life. Cas is so strong, so fast, so big, and it feels so good, getting fucked. God, Dean wishes they’d done it on Earth, could have fucked so much more, so much better, and he’s not groaning anymore, he’s whining; embarrassing, undignified sounds, whines and yelps and gasps, just letting Cas into him, letting Cas break him, whatever Cas wants, whatever he needs, and it feels so good, just letting go and feeling and giving.
“Don’t ever talk like that again. You’re more than me, Dean. You’re more than Sam. Don’t you dare hurt yourself. Don’t you dare. Promise me you won’t hurt yourself.”
“It’s just— you asked what I wanted. I didn’t understand what you meant, at first, but I think I do now. I changed my mind. I want you to tell him. I want everyone to know.”
Castiel is breathing shallowly. “I do,” he breathes. “I just. I don’t need it today. I don’t need it for you.”
“You gonna fuck me, darlin’?” Dean teases, running a finger up the middle of it. Cas bats it away crankily.
Dean rises from the bed and gets dressed in silence. A painfully long time passes before Cas hears him walk to the doorway and pause. “I can take the sheets if you—”
He’s never been told “no” before. He doesn’t know how to cope with it. But you… you’ve been told “no” your entire life, haven’t you? What a massive reservoir of repressed emotion you must be.
Dean doesn’t have a quip for that. He reaches a hand up, meaning to pull Cas down with him, but Cas just holds it instead, rubbing circles into it with his thumb.
“Gotta be honest, Cas; I don’t think you can kill me right now. Don’t suppose he’d let you.” Dean gestures to his head with the hand towel before dumping it back on the sink.
“True enough.” Somehow Cas’s voice has turned soft and smooth. “I vastly prefer fucking you. You’re a particularly loud fuck.”
“Uh, yeah. I mean, unless you know how to throw a parade.” That was the difficult thing about having Charlie for a sister, the way she’d talk about things like they were obvious when they weren’t. Dean isn’t sure how to react.
Cas loops an arm around Dean’s legs and waist, and twists him, turning him against the blanket, then releases him there, sideways, leaning on his tied hands. Dean is too gone to even think. He’s just letting Cas manhandle him, throw him around, tie him up, pull his hair. Anything. Dean whimpers.
“You mean—” Cas can just fucking raw him right now. They can just— they can just have sex for— “Holy shit.” A million possibilities are flowing through his mind, most of them the products of porn, a few the products of hentai. Could they do
now I have to warn you if you haven’t read the last two chapters you probably won’t understand this one so these are officially not drabbles they’re just… a fic, I guess. Please let me know if there is a name for this kind of thing in particular I am still new here.
“No, she ain’t.” No lack of damage would let you just forget being hit by your own father. All of Dean’s bruises had healed, but he never forgot.
Sam and Chuck walk down a street in Supercop World. Things are colorful, but uniform. It’s like the suburbs in A Wrinkle in Time, with a heavy dose of futurism sprinkled on top. Think original plans for Epcot. It feels extremely derivative and SOULLESS.
“I thought I wasn’t allowed back here without express permission from Sister Jo,” says Cas, following him down the hall toward the bedroom.
Dean knows better than to answer this, even to sass. He can come up with some creative ones, though.The sheriff rolls his eyes.
Chuck sits back down backwards on a chair and spins it to face the blackboard. He snaps, and the figures and charts from the blackboard fly off of it into reality as we—
Cas shifts around to face him better, his face wrinkled up in frustration, his voice too loud as he says
Dean pauses a moment, not really ready to stop kissing, despite his protestations. But he can see where Cas is going. “Yes, darlin’.” He sits on the edge of his bed.
“Sam,” Cas acknowledges. Back to reality, back to their lives, back to Dean, standing five feet away. It feels so far.
Dean sneaks a peak at the paper, but it’s not him— Cas is drawing, of all things, the little bowl of coffee. His one true love, Dean thinks wryly.
They head straight to the washroom, even though it’s early in the night. Dean can only assume Cas has bought too much of his time again, but he still wants to make it worthwhile, and filling the tub takes time, so he gets it started right away. He gives Cas his usual spiel: big, tough cowboy, ain’t you handsome, you gonna show me a good time tonight? Cas stays silent through it, answering the question instead with a “How was your month?”
Dean shoves his arms into his shirtsleeves. His mind is still racing, but not with words, or thoughts, just racing, just the need to get out.
Dean is surprised to find he isn’t sure how he feels about that. He was always pro-sex, as a rule. It’s just…. He’d made his peace with never sleeping with Cas again. He’d told himself it was good that they stopped, that he’d already messed Cas up enough, that way.
“I’m sorry.” Cas snuggles into him. “I’m glad you’re here,” he whispers, and Dean squeezes his hand.
Sweet, useless man. “I ain’t fixing to seduce the cattle, Cas,” says Dean. “I mean, do I look like a proper cowpoke?”
said with such sincerity not even Dean could deny it. Cas had enjoyed it. Cas hadn’t manipulated him. He hadn’t manipulated Cas. They both just— enjoyed it. That was all. That couldn’t be real. Cas couldn’t be real.
“Didn’t mean anything by it,” he says innocently, untying the man’s pants. “They don’t do much for me, either. Broke too many girl’s hearts before I realized it wasn’t gonna make me happy.” He looks back up before going any further. Castiel doesn’t seem angry. He’s just watching Dean. Just anticipating what they both know will come next. “You know what does make me happy, Castiel?”
“I’m sorry,” says Balthazar. “I thought we were done with the ‘riding smelly beasts’ part of the day, and were ready to move on to the ‘eating and sleeping’ part.”
Cas gives him a dirty look, like bringing up the theft was a step too far, but Dean just smiles innocently back, tonguing his teeth and enjoying the view as Cas walks on through, and then he shuts the gate behind them.
“Good evening, sir,” says Jo, suddenly all smiles. “I sure hope you had a wonderful time tonight with Dean here.”
He’s a fucking romantic. Of course he is. “Wanted you since I saw them pretty blue eyes,” Dean says honestly. “And those big, strong arms. Been wanting you inside me since you talked to me all pretty behind the tiger. Since you done strung me up and made me wait for you.” Dean rolls his hips for effect.
He expects Cas to defend himself, or Boston, or to get mad, but instead his pitches his voice even lower than usual and deadpans, not even attempting a Texas accent, “Howdy, y’all.”
They get through it. If Cas wants to pick up a little extra money, it’s fine with Dean, so long as he never has to speak with Crowley again. When they get up Dean squeezes Cas’s shoulder and slides his hand down to the small of his back territorially.
Sam gets up, brings some bottles to the kitchen, across from the laundry. Dean finishes his laundry and gestures at Sam to follow him.
Bobby curses under his breath. “Well, there’s no point hiding her; I know you’re gonna take her, anyhow.”
“Good boy.” It’s said slowly, the same speed with which Cas pulls, once again, out of him. Dean thinks he’s going to faint.
“And I can't fight this feeeeling anymore/ I’ve forgotten what I started fighting fo-or/ It’s time to bring this ship into the shore/ And throw away the oars, foreverrrrr”
“Please, Cas. Everything is… I just wanna turn off for a minute. Just wanna do what you tell me. You’re so good at it. I need you, baby.”
In the name of keeping a low profile, the brothers hadn’t let Dean help with the grocery shopping before they rode out, but Dean finds himself the official cook anyhow. The two rich boys seem to be content to squat uselessly at the end of each day and watch him try to make the best of the supplies they’d purchased. Dean doesn’t mind it much, so long as they hop to and bring him what he needs, and clean up after. He gets good reviews, too, though he doesn’t know what he’s doing, really. They’re both impressed by his ability to add salt and spices to their food until it tastes palatable, though Dean doesn’t see how that’s a skill at all.
There’s no way of predicting it, no schedule, no pattern. The only system they use is Dean’s whims. Dean more than once drags Cas into dark corners and distracts him with no warning, just a flurry of lips and tongue that ends as suddenly as it begins, both of them left panting into each other’s mouths. Other times, Dean gives Cas a nod or a tap on the shoulder, and Cas dutifully follows him to his room, where they do whatever it is Dean wants to do that day. Dean never says a word before or after these sessions, but during…. During them, Cas is getting a thorough education in the sounds Dean Winchester can make, the ways he gasps at unexpected contact and whimpers after orgasm, the words he uses to describe and encourage pleasure: curses and instructions and words of praise that feed a hunger Cas had never known he had. So Dean speaks during sex all the time, sometimes Cas does, too, but still, they never talk
“Oh, no?” Balthazar asks, seemingly thrilled to have started an argument. “Tell me, then, Dean. Do you want to
Dean wants the same things he’s always wanted. He wants a house and a sweetheart and kids who need him. He wants to be close to his family, to feed people. He wants to feel safe. He wants to be wanted. He wants to be in love.
“Then you’re in charge tonight,” Cas says, fingering Dean’s lips. “Do you know what that means?” But Dean doesn’t get to answer, as Cas’s thumb pushes into his mouth as soon as it opens. Dean sucks obediently. “You have to make fucking me just as good, if not better than, fucking you. You’ve got your work cut out for you, I’d say.”
Cas just reaches a hand out for it, and Dean passes it to him under his arm. Cas actually groans after taking a sip, leaning sideways against Dean’s back.
“Uh. That bad, huh?” Dean looks down at himself, but of course that doesn’t tell him anything. “Isn’t Heaven supposed to botox me or something?”
Dean just breathes as Cas looks at him, shirt open and fallen against the bed, chest exposed to Cas’s eyes and hands, which grope him hungrily, exploring all the same old territory.
Cas blinks and looks away. “I don’t know about that. And you have to realize that Balthazar was both. To tell Jack otherwise would still be a lie.”
This isn’t a product of Cas’s imagination. They’re lines, fed to him by Dean himself years ago. Cas had done quite a bit of research at the time. There was a rhythm to this play, a pattern that made sense. Everything was predictable; every action had a pre-established reaction. All he had to do was stick to the script. And so, yes, Cas is confident he’s good at this. There’s a certainty to it that he likes. He knows exactly what Dean wants from him.
“I can see that, baby. You look so good, baby.” Dean kisses his neck, wide and slurping, with tongue, then he starts to suck, the sensation making Cas moan. Dean’s hand is speeding up, sending wave after wave of pleasure through him. “You make me feel like a teenager. Make me wanna make out all night, give you hickeys all over. Fucking stupid. Jesus, Cas.”
Dean hums against him, making Castiel shudder. “You done promised me you’d be a gentleman, now. You gonna treat me right if I put it there? You gonna stay still, and treat your boy whore good?”
“Annnnnd for his majesty,” Dean announces, presenting their shopping bags smack on top of Sam’s research on the war table. “The exact, correct, brand of paper towels.”
“Yes, but believe it or not, this is the most finished room. I haven’t had much time for decorating, either.”
Dean had promised that, hadn’t he? But now that he looks at the tepid, opaque, reddish-brown water he’s having second thoughts.
Dean looks at the kid, who he’d forgotten was there and who’s watching them with round eyes. He has the urge to curse again, but represses it. “I thought he’d make it. He was trying. He was really trying.”
“Hell if I know.” He’s panicking. At least he wouldn’t rat them out, maybe. Assuming there was anything to rat on. If Bal had— he could always come clean, later.
“Didn’t do this to you,” Dean manages to gasp out. Was it heaven that made his ass feel this good, or had he seriously been missing out in life by not being gayer?
As Castiel, angel of the Lord, sits at the kitchen table with his new family, he revels in the normalcy of it. It’s strange for them, to be so normal. All of them are there together, for one thing. Jack, Eileen, Sam, and Dean. His whole family, safe and sound. Just as it should be. The sort of normal he’d never dreamed would happen. Cas feels a fullness in his chest, close to bursting. His face hurts from too much smiling and for too long.
Dean almost objects— Balthazar can’t be 15 yards away—but in the pitch black, with the rain muffling the sound, they may as well be in a different room, different building, even.
Balthazar peeks round the door like he expects them to be in the middle of things. “A day of rest,” he says, “is a holy thing, you know.”
“Fuck,” says Cas, and Dean laughs. God, he loves it when Cas curses. “Can I move, Dean? I. I need to move.”
“For what? If anyone asks you why you attacked that man you can just tell them the truth, which I assume is that he called you a queer, and I think they’ll find your reaction normal, actually.”
“Good.” Cas quiets. He taps Dean gently with the crop again. Dean leans into it. “You speak when I ask you a question, and not before. It’s not so hard, is it?”
He grabs a cigarette but doesn’t light it. He sits at the desk and tries to see if he can flip it around in his fingers the way one of his johns had done once to impress him, practicing the sleight of hand trick badly and then only moderately badly.
At last Castiel seems to be satisfied with him, and then he says, with a thoughtful, matter-of-fact voice, like he’s talking about the weather, “Can I suck you through them?”
“Thank you for apologizing.” The man looks up at Dean, mouth opening, presumably to make some excuse for his—for
“Ain’t one thing John said today was true, Dean. There ain’t nothing wrong with what you are. You may be the best man I ever met.”
“Thank you.” Cas rolls onto his side, drapes an arm over Dean’s chest, and takes his unoccupied hand. He rubs it gently. “Do you have any siblings?”
Dean swallows everything down and kisses Cas’s spent cock as he lifts slowly off. Cas collapses onto the tarp beside him, just slightly off kilter from where he had been. He pumps Dean’s cock slowly in his fist, hot breaths hitting Dean’s skin. Dean reaches a hand over, just wanting to touch Cas and finding his ass. He palms it, playing with it as Cas kisses his dick again.
“Tagg,” says Cas, shifting a bit and grabbing at Dean’s free hand, not the one on his ass, “knows a lot about insects.”
he thinks to himself. Well, Cas had pinned him to a wall or two before, but he’d never initiated sex. It was always Dean. It was only Dean. Dean was the one who got horny, emotional, bored. Lovesick. And Cas always met him where he was, always, but he never asked for more.
They wake Balthazar, who blinks and frowns at them from the doorway to his room before asking, “So it’s back to the old method of torture, then, is it? Everything’s simpatico?”
“Cas,” Dean starts, and there’s something strange about his tone, something… cautious, maybe? “Do you trust me?”
“And if you find her again?” Cas asks, what hope he has remaining resting on this thread, because if Sam and Dean can do the deed, there will be no need to betray them at all.
Cas makes a sort of retching sound, which wouldn’t be loud except it’s directly in his ear. Dean pushes him away.
He pads quietly to the door and opens it for little Jo. His little Jo. She’s tall; taller than Charlie, he’d reckon.
Dean laughs. “Well, thank God for that, but let’s not talk about him any more tonight, that sound agreeable to you, darlin’? I wanna hear about you.” Dean tips his hat even further back, so it’s just barely staying on by the string under his chin, and gets down on his knees. He doesn’t actually have all night to talk to this guy for no money, after all. “Can I look at you?” he asks, hands on Castiel’s waist.
“She ain’t alone over there, you know. She’s got Charlie with her. And your other siblings. If they’re anything like you, she’ll be just fine.”
Cas blinks, coming back to earth, and meets Dean’s eyes. “You’re right. I’m sorry.” He reaches down and pumps Dean gently.
“Sammy!” Dean crosses the threshold to hug him. He looks good, his hair too long and falling in his face, annoyingly tall and fit as a fiddle. “You son of a bitch. What the hell’s going on? Are you alright? Hey there, Charles.” He hugs Charlie briefly.
Dean sighs. He lets go of Cas. “See if Charlie ever bangs you now,” he huffs in Meg’s direction. She just waves lazily back at them from her bed.
“Dean, those college boys aren’t smarter than you. They’re just richer. I’m not smarter than you either, my family just uses a different vocabulary.”
“Beautiful asshole,” he mutters against Dean’s lips, and, sure, Dean’ll take it. “Don’t sleep with anyone who knows my name.”
“Wha— oh.” Dean takes it and puts both beers on the nightstand. Cas can only describe the look in his eyes when he turns back as amorous.
“No need to get personal.” Crowley starts dealing cards. “I’m impressed with you, you know. I thought certainly he’d kick you to the curb after what we did. But here you are, and only, what, fifteen hours after he found out? That’s very good. You must be something special.”
It’s a ghost that he’s allowed to resurface recently, only during his loneliest moments, only when the pain is already so great that a little bit of pleasure seems worth the cascade of shame to follow. It’s a dark alley somewhere in Maine, the backseat of his car, the early hours of the morning. It’s Cas’s voice groaning his name, gasping out in pleasure. It’s Cas’s lips on his, opening him up, exposing his soul to the world. It’s the cold of night, the sinking feeling in his gut. It’s shame. It’s darkness.
It’s Crowley, of course, sitting at the table Dean and Balthazar had vacated, shuffling Bal’s deck of cards.
He doesn’t even warn him, just presses his arm firmly to Dean’s upper back and Dean goes down without thinking. Cas pushes him all the way, all the way until his chest is against the table. Then Cas stands behind him, one arm solid against his shoulders, his other hand massaging Dean’s ass.
She’s gentle enough as he brushes her down and saddles her up. Dean remembers Cas saying in his letter than he hadn’t gotten along with her at first, but she seems peaceable as anything to Dean. He feels a weird nostalgia as he gets in the saddle, like he’s seventeen again and daydreaming about competing in the rodeo. Riding on Sue-Anne before the sunrise, heading out toward Singer Corral, he feels like he’s already on the range, free as a bird.
Dean is tempted to say. He scootches forward a little instead, grabs his hat from the dresser, and plops it on Cas’s head, where he arranges it to look sexy.
“Your ass is perfect.” Dean lets a hand wander down to verify. “Bet you’d look real pretty, too, riding me.” The thought is incredibly distracting. He tightens his grip.
Cas wraps a hand around both their cocks, holding them together and thrusting slowly. Their skin clings and sticks with water—there’s too much friction—until they get hard and start leaking and nothing seems to matter anymore. “What do they do on the mountaintop,” Cas prompts in Dean’s ear, voice tinged with a color that suggests he knows exactly what they did.
“I hardly ever get any,” Dean keeps up the conversation cheerfully. “Figured I could go and take a cup seeing as you done got me up at an ungodly hour. Hope you’re hungry. We got hotcakes, eggs, and jam.” Dean points to each proudly.
“Cas,” Dean groans deeply. Cas hasn’t even moved yet, hasn’t touched him. Dean’s keyed up already, must’ve been since before he came by. He’s writhing on top of Cas in a way that would be embarrassing if he weren’t unreasonably erotic doing it. “Hurt me, Cas. Please.”
The sheriff raises an eyebrow at him. “I can see that.” Dean doesn’t even blush, he’s so busy panicking. “This Mr. Milton happen to be the same man who decked John in the street a couple months back?”
Cas stands, but doesn’t accept the towel. He steps out of the tub and puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “What’s wrong?” he asks.
They let him be, sometimes. When he’s with people, or when he’s hunting. When he drinks enough, but not too much. So long as he’s distracted enough from himself, it stops. But when he’s alone.
Frustrated and lost in his own anxieties and desires, Cas ceases play without communicating his desire to do so. Dean complains, and acting out of frustration and anger, Cas jacks him off without asking consent.
“—Yes, Cas! Geeze. Don’t gotta get into it now. The point is, we’ll figure it out. Together. Alright?”
“Ground rule two,” says Dean, taking his overshirt off. “You want me to stop, just say so, okay? I’ll stop. No big deal.”
Dean closes the door, only to hear thudding footsteps and a knock a second later. He opens the door back up to find Jack there.
It feels like such a short time and then Cas is pushing him off, gentle but firm. His eyes are lit, and then sorry, and wordlessly he makes to move, but Dean grabs him by the hand.
By the time he’s done his eyes are dry. He asks Cas for a minute anyway, goes into the cold air and leans against his Baby, closes his eyes. He feels like a jackass.
“I know how dangerous that job is, Dean. Ruby told me about all the men who ride the rails into town and reckon they can get away with hurting people there. These stupid things you’ve been doing— they aren’t protecting us anymore. They’re just hurting you. It isn’t the same thing.”
Cas blinks at him like an injured animal. “I… want you to be honest with me.” Maybe he was just that stupid. But somehow Dean can’t look down on him for it. Not when he’s being stupid, too.
“No, no. I want to. It’s what I do. Is that… okay?” Dean asks Cas, uncertain if he should even be asking.
“That’s right.” Dean rubs against him through their trousers. “Move your feet further apart for me, darlin’.”
Dean supposes Cas means this to be a great compliment, that he wants to say that it means something, that he’s letting Dean do this. But Dean doesn’t see what the big deal is. It was just sex. Most people did it. There were other things he’d trusted Cas with that were infinitely more important. Anyway, Dean’s not one to be a stick in the mud. He smiles up at Cas. “Well, it is my great privilege,” he says in as smart a voice he can manage, “to educate you in this matter.” He winks.
Then there’s the click of shoes out in the hall and Cas scrambles up and Dean supposes he may ought to scramble, too, and they squeeze into the bed and under the covers.
“And I didn’t mean to disrespect you. Again.” Cas sighs the last word, like he’s yelling at himself instead of apologizing to Dean.
“Shit,” says Dean, meaning it bad, meaning Cas might as well have just thrown dirt down on Dean while he stood in a grave of his own digging.
“I can’t afford a room in that hotel, Dean. Not if you want me to keep what’s left of my father’s money.”
A humiliating certainty. Dean pretends the water is whiskey, which makes it drinkable. Jo keeps talking.
Afterwards, when Cas collapses onto the bed, ready to begin to come down from his orgasm, Dean gets up, cleans himself off at the sink, and gets dressed. He throws Cas’s clothes to him harder than necessary, then mumbles, “I’m gonna get that beer,” and leaves the room before Cas can even start to assemble himself.
Perhaps Dean would understand, if he attempted to explain. Dean was more than familiar enough with the sensations of violence. There’s a reason, Cas knows, why Dean always requests to play the submissive role, and never the dominator. Dean had dominated souls in Hell, after all; he’d tortured and controlled and twisted them until their screams filled the halls of Hell. He’d excelled at it, and that step toward demonhood had haunted him ever since. But Cas doesn’t have that excuse, only his feelings for Dean. And he isn’t allowed to talk about those.
Cas wonders if he’s supposed to kiss Dean. He certainly wants to. Characters in movies usually kissed at the end of the first date. Was this the end of theirs? How was he supposed to know? Cas swallows. Dean’s close enough. It wouldn’t be hard. He just had to—
I’m not dumb, Chuck. If you wanted me gone, I’d be gone by now. So isn’t that why I’m still around? So we can talk?
Balthazar keeps on talking. “He’s strange, but competent. All the cowboys know him; it’s like a requirement around here. You do want to be a cowboy, don’t you? You seem to enjoy the banality of it all.”
“You ain’t the only man from Boston. What about your boy? He’s still there, ain’t he? And people know what he is?”
Dean reaches into his pocket, pulls out what cash he has left, and pushes it into her hand. “Alright, well, you go back there and tell Krissy not to let John do shit with her til I say so, alright? I’ll scare something up.”
Cas sighs. For the first time ever, Dean sees him at a loss for words. He looks to the ceiling, as if accusing God for not coming down and putting an easy answer in his mind.
How the hell would I know? I’ve never been there. I’ve spent so many years lying to myself about what I hated that I believed it. Now, I don’t know anymore.
He hasn’t been to Rick’s Saloon since he was seventeen, but it’s just as dark and dreary as always. So early in the day, it has no one but smelly old drunks in it. There’s Old Jim Bradleigh, Edgar Whitmore, a scummy-looking man whose name Dean can’t quite remember, and of course Rick himself behind the bar. Nobody he’s close with, no clients. Certainly no friends. Old Jim has got a problem with him being there, and they scuffle almost as soon as Dean gets into the place, the man too old and too drunk to do Dean any real damage. It gets his heart rate up, though, gets him feeling a little bit confident, a little bit better. His ribs hurt where Jim got a punch in and it makes him feel alive. Wiping spittle from his mouth, he leaves the man on the floor and sits himself down at the bar. He orders a half pint bottle, bold as anything, having no idea what’ll happen next.
Dean has to crane his neck back to see where he’s sitting. Cas goes off to help with dinner, occupying Miguel and Tagg’s attention on the other side of what is now a proper campfire. “Quit what?” he asks.
“Oh. Uh, yeah. Yeah, she’s good for it. Though Meg ain’t supposed to have chew in the first place, so don’t go blaming Jo if she does. How do I look?” Dean asks, a little impatient, craning around to peek at the paper.
“‘Course he ain’t.” Dean had already given almost all of his own funds to John a few weeks ago to cover what Bela had learned from one of her clients was really gambling debts; maybe that was the reason he hadn’t asked, this time. Maybe he could smell money, and he knew Dean was out. “Why ain’t he marrying you off?” Dean asks. At least Charlie was a proper adult.
A week later, he gets a letter addressed to Dean, courtesy of Josephine Anael, from C. Milton. He locks himself in room three to read it.
Cas thinks this over for a minute, during which time Dean’s stomach seems to sink straight down through his balls. Dean’s almost finished washing Cas by the time he says, “That thing Fergus said to you… about you not knowing me. I think he was right.”
He loved Cas, too, the way he’d look over and watch him even when they were both busy with their own business, the way he’d serve Dean his supper and then clean up after like Dean was his guest, the way he’d sit and draw him every night by the light of the fire, even when Miguel noticed him at it and began to tease. He kept on drawing like Dean was the only thing there to look at and drawing was the only thing to do.
There’s more than one kind of creativity. Say you build something that makes sense to you. An engine. One you’ve never built before. You find all the difficult-to-find parts, and you fit them together. Grease them up, get it running perfectly. Then, for whatever reason, you decide to break it. You destroy every piece. What remains?
Cas waits, impatient now that he has implicit permission to stay. Dean was coming back, wasn’t he? Dean wasn’t just going to attribute any success in falling asleep to the memory foam, and end up switching mattresses with him or something, right?
“We’re headed to Santa Fe and back. It should take about four weeks before we stop in Abilene again.”
“—Is that what they’re calling it these days?” the man asks suggestively, putting his drink down on the bar before leering at Dean. “He’s very talented, isn’t he? Very… vocal.”
“Cas!” Dean stands to return to the piano. As he passes Crowley’s chair he hears him say something and stops dead. “What was that.”
“Yeah, yeah, you’re cheap. What else is new,” Dean had sassed. He didn’t owe her money anymore. He could sass a little.
“You don’t work here, Mr. Winchester.” That startles him long enough for her to keep talking, tone professional and clipped. “That means you don’t live here. And I don’t take kindly to trespassers; especially in my girls’ bedroom. I’m afraid I have to ask you and your brother to leave.”
Cas kisses him, just the corner of his lips, just gently. “Shut up,” he whispers, trying to hold the anger back.
Dean manages not to groan. She’s got him by the balls, and he’s got nothing on her. She’s staring at him with a raised, perfectly plucked eyebrow. He sighs. “What do you want.”
Chuck doubles over at his waist, yelling it in Sam’s direction like a spoiled child. He’s giddy, self-satisfied.
Cas’s eyes flick up to him and he obeys without a word, pulling Dean close by the neck and kissing him gentle and slow. He lets go only to fall back on the bed, and Dean leans over him, outlining his lips with a finger. “Is it my fault?” Cas asks. “You left to be with me.”
so good, each thrust of Cas’s hips is better, is more, is perfect, fucking perfect, everything he says in that voice making Dean harder.
“I’ve been trying to think of ways to compliment you that you’ll like,” Cas says. “I haven’t come up with much, but I think I have something.”
“Just a couple miles.” Dean ties up the little jar with a bit of rope and straps it onto Cas’s pack. He throws the extra blanket over the saddle and reaches for Cas’s hand. It’s gotta be past two in the morning; there’s nobody around to see them.
“Lynyrd Skynyrd. Thank you.” Cas takes Dean by the chin, gently turns his head, and kisses him on his cheek.
“If anyone comes for me in the night, I’ll just die,” says Meg laconically. “Unless it’s you, blue-eyes.”
“Sammy?” Dean asks loudly, swinging his legs out of bed and getting up. He’d gone and slept in his clothes. Ruby shushes him as he crosses the room to the door.
but maybe he can drown it out. Maybe Cas can make him feel something other than pain, if only for a few minutes.
“You really have been telling me the truth this whole time, haven’t you? And you’ve been flirting. And complimenting me. He hates it when people compliment me. Always follows them up with a criticism.”
There were a lot of things that could set a barn in West Texas alight. A cigarette was one, smoked furtively where the family couldn’t see, dropped at God knows what impetus onto a pile of dry hay. A lantern was another, resting on a surface where it ought to be safe, til someone who oughtn’t be there, who was a little too drunk and a little too reckless, bumped into it.
he’d joked once after Dean had sworn his way through orgasm. That was it. Dean lies there silently, barely breathing
“I, uh. shit. Yeah. Yeah, I’m good. Real good.” He leans down and kisses Cas, and Cas keeps pumping slowly into him, though the angle’s less good this way. Dean’s dick is still ready and eager to go. Fuck. “Hain’t never come that way before,” Dean admits.
It takes Cas a second of eye contact before he obeys, turning in the small space between Dean and the wall to face it.
Cas stares at him instead, eyes wide and almost black in the darkness. Cas’s lips are only inches away. Dean redirects his attention, back down to the other side of Cas’s neck this time, and Cas gasps above him. Dean moans despite himself, lips closed, humming against Cas’s neck. He sways slightly as he kneels on the seat, wishing he had something to rub against. Cas’s hand grips Dean’s shirt. Dean drops a hand down to Cas’s crotch, fumbling over the cold belt buckle and cheap polyester to an unmistakable bulge, hard under his hand, and Cas groans for real this time.
“Shit. Shit, Cas.” Dean says it with a breathy laugh, but it’s hot, fuck, it’s hot, and he starts pushing at Cas’s lower back with his legs, grinding up on him harder.
I’ll have you know, is a cheating, spoiled, lying piece of shit whose own mother doesn’t love him, and Cas knows it. Come on. You should eat something, at least.”
After the change, though. After the point of no return had passed, he always knew what to do: He held his head high. Adapted. Did whatever needed to be done.
He sneaks into the dark bedroom, strips, and slides into bed with Cas. There isn’t room enough for the both of them, really, but Cas rolls onto his side so Dean can fit. Cas has stolen one of Dean’s shirts, and so he’s cottony and soft as Dean snuggles around him and holds him close, like they’re one person instead of two.
“I mean, me, sure, I don’t get kicked out of bed. Well. Except by you, I guess. But you, I mean. Geeze. Jimmy should’ve been a supermodel.”
The girls start to get up and Dean ends up making two more batches of hotcakes. Sister Jo comes in and complains when there isn’t any coffee left to go with the smell. They all end up eating and chatting.
There’s nearly half a moon in the sky, just barely enough to see by. Dean leads them on small dirt paths, small enough they have to walk single file, and after they’ve exhausted the topic of Bobby, Dean asks about Cape Cod, and Cas tells him about it, and Dean shakes his head at the whole idea of it, people so rich they can afford to have a second house standing empty almost the whole year, then they pass through a field, and into a copse of live oak trees by a little creek still babbling with spring runoff.
Cas smiles and turns his attention back to Dean's thighs. “He’s making a picture out of you. But it won’t be a very good one if you can’t keep still.”
They gather up their things, get dressed, and sneak one by one into the washroom down the hall. This inn has got a porcelain tub, and indoor plumbing too, so things go easy as Dean helps Cas clean himself up, then they fill the tub back up and get in, each washing the other gently. Cas’s mood improves greatly once he’s clean, and Dean supposes he’d been right to want to wait for this until they were in town.
“Talk to Sister Jo,” Dean whispers roughly before he can con himself out of any more commission. “Please talk to Sister Jo.”
No, Jack. Not yet. You should be— hell, you should be playing with play dough. Throwing your toys on the floor. I failed you, Jack. I’m sorry.
this the right thing to do? It feels right. It feels erotic. Then again, maybe anything with Dean would feel erotic. Dean pushes in and out of him, watching. Cas closes his eyes, lets himself feel the pressure of Dean’s finger on his tongue; he groans, low and slow and relaxed.
thing to work with. But you got very boring. Maybe it had something to do with all the people on Earth being replaced by soulless illusions—
Sweet thing. Dean about melts into the mattress. “Aw, go ahead and fuck me quick. We can fuck slow later.”

Par for the course level of angst. Also includes total plagiarism of That Scene because wow there was way too much going on to paraphrase it.
“Alright, alright. Rich boy needs his coffee.” Dean lights the stove and pulls a pot of water. He hums to himself as he goes, aware of Cas’s eyes on him. “Hold up.” Dean winks at Cas and heads over to the bedroom. He comes back with a brown shirt, which he lays out on the counter. He puts the handful of roasted beans in the middle and folds the shirt over, then picks up the cast iron pan and give it a good wack, making Cas jump. He gives it a few more hits and replaces the pan back on its shelf. Then, he gets out a ceramic bowl and drapes the shirt overtop, weighing down the corners with pots and pans, leaving enough give in the fabric to make a little divot for the crushed beans over the bowl.
“Yes,” Cas admits breathily. “A few times. I never used—“ he sighs softly. “I never used to understand the appeal, but.” He sighs again, and Dean smiles, running his teeth along Cas’s right thigh now.
“That’s right.” Cas kisses his cheek. “You were wonderful. Dean, I’ll give you whatever you want. What is it you want?”
“Fuck. You—Maybe— not now. Not now, baby. I want it, but we gotta— You can—” God he’s bad at talking—“you can have me however you want, later.”
Dean plugs the cork back in slowly, walking over close to Cas but not to him, to the nightstand instead, and puts the skin down. Cas stands there still, watching him though they’re almost touching. He’s either learned to be patient or he’s thinking about something else. “Focused?” Dean checks, turning towards him.
Dean approaches the door Cas left through and finds a hallway. He starts down it and jumps back when Cas nearly runs into him.
Cas kisses him, which isn’t exactly what Dean had been angling for, but Dean leans into it happily, inching forward on his muddied knees until he’s between Cas’s legs, tasting smoke, intensifying the kiss, a hand on Cas’s neck, holding him as close as he can, until Cas breaks away.
“Hi. Listen. How about I take you to breakfast, kid? Let your daddy sleep a bit. Would that be alright with you?”
I told you, Dean. We’re actively recruiting, and no Gen Zers will join if we sound like some boy’s club.
The feelings are too much, and other memories are coming to him quickly now, of being apart again and again and again and each time just as painful, but he also remembers being together, raising a son together, feeling affection, anger, forgiveness; he remembers Cas telling him he is
“She’s important to the town. Attracts a lot of men, cowpokes and the like. People here live off the money they bring around. And people usually put up with you if you’re helping them out. Even if they won’t look at you.”
“—I know you mean it. It’s because you don’t think things through. You’re just like him. And you forget that I know more about this than you. For one thing, I know that I very publicly took a shit in Anton Seidl’s prize orchid.”
Cas lifts a hand to Dean’s face, fingers warm and steady. “I don’t think I could ever understand this,” he says, and Dean reaches up to grip his wrist, to hold his hand there against his face just a second longer. “You should go to the police,” says Cas, like a rich idiot.
Dean shoves the man from behind and dodges his left, countering with a direct hit to his kidney. He follows it up with another punch, and another, til he gets the man on the ground and bloody, and then he doesn’t stop; he’s punching just to punch, then arms are grabbing at him and he’s rushing up to fight more, getting onto his feet and turning—but a Yankee voice is speaking soothingly. Blue eyes are staring at him.
“—BOYS.” Charlie holds her lantern straight up in the air between them, and Dean can just barely see Sam over it, the orange light flickering off his face. “Let’s put some more distance between us and the house be
Cas lets Dean crawl up onto him, wrap him up in a muscled arm and hold him tight. He scratches a hand over Dean’s scalp. “Dean?”
Cas didn’t want him to lie. There was no reason to, really. Dean pets Cas’s hair, for his own comfort, not Cas’s. He thinks about things he wants, things he never thought a person like him could have. It’s strange, to have them potentially within reach. He’s never had that sort of opportunity before. He’s never had this sort of feeling before. He’s never done anything for himself before.
“Dean—“ Cas leans closer, rubbing Dean’s cheek with a thumb. “Thank you.” Dean stares at him, and Cas stares back. “Do you really want this?” Cas asks. “Not just me, but Jack, too?”
“With your hands tied behind your back? In the house of a man who you don’t know well, who doesn’t know you’re here?”
“You—“ but Dean can’t voice all his concerns. Are you sore at all? Is this comfortable? Where do you feel pressure? “You sure?” he manages.
Cas is quiet on the other side of the car, hands in pockets. “Of course not, Dean.” Dean stares off into space as the passenger side door thuds closed.
It takes Dean a second to figure out that he means in the room, not in the relationship. Dean shakes his head. “Fifteen minutes, maybe?”
Dean fights to keep his face still. So it was all a game. The man already knew. But he needs Dean to say it, for some reason. “Can’t spell worth a damn,” he lies.
Dean gets up and finds the list. He looks it over and notices a few lines at the top that haven’t been crossed out. Cas had lied, about the first question being about food. At the top of the page are three questions, clear as day:
Motel it is, then. Dean decides to stop for burgers on the way as well, even though he just ate. He has a feeling Cas hasn’t been getting enough hot food. He orders himself a burger and swallows it down so that Cas won’t feel self-conscious, and watches to make sure Cas finishes his own. Then he drives them to a motel with a vacancy sign and gets them two queen beds for the night.
“Good. Now get down here.” Dean shifts over onto his side and puts his picture carefully in the chest, away from the oil jar.
Dean flees towards the library at full speed, only to stop dead outside the door. Nerves, bubbling up from God knows where, root him to the spot.
“Should get Sam’s stupid towels before the store closes,” Dean murmurs. “You probably need stuff, too.”
But they don’t work as distractions now, not when every other line reminds him of something Cas would say, about Jim Crow or Denis Kearney or Indian reservations.
Dean can feel himself breaking, just like Cas fucking said. With every pump of Cas’s hips, with every word out of his goddamn mouth, Dean’s will breaks. He needs. He wants.
“There’s one down the hall.” Cas turns and squints at him. “You just bathed. What are you talking about?”
There was no pretending to be straight anymore. Cas had been clear on that: he wanted to be out. He wanted Dean’s family to know.
Cas looks at him like he’s promised him all the money in the world, then he shifts, getting his knees up to the pillow, and Dean can feel his tip, hot and slick, touch against him.
The ranch is nearly a two hour ride from town, and they end up having to light a lantern to make it there as the sky darkens. Dean and Cas stop outside the gate, and Balthazar rides in alone, for once uncomplaining after a stern look from Cas. Cas gets down from Sue-Anne to give her a break, but Dean stays astride Baby, the two of them pacing there in the road until a lantern comes riding back down the way.
“Okay.”Dean’s a little dazed. He leans down and kisses Cas, softly sucking on his bottom lip, humming a little himself.
It’s Bobby, up in the church doorway, staring down at him with a ruddy face and no hat on, wispy hairs combed back over his head. Dean squints up at him. It’s bright out, but he doesn’t have a hat on, either. Not today. “Preacher wouldn’t let me in.”
“You are helping, stupid.” Dean kisses him. “Stupid, idiot man. Sweetest, kindest, soul I ever met. Shut your stupid mouth. Talking nonsense.”
“I want you, Cas.” Dean scrunches his hands into Cas’s shirt, as if he can keep Cas from flying off by holding him there. “I want you, here. I want you, not flying off, or dying, or, or, doing secret deals, or trying to do everything on your own. That’s all I—“ Dean’s lip wavers. He bites it.
With that, he starts playing another piece, one that in only a few notes makes Cas roll his eyes and walk away. For this one, Balthazar’s hands jump around nimbly, hitting only a few keys at a time, at a quicker tempo than before, but it’s not nearly as impressive-seeming to Dean as the dramatic chords of the previous piece had been—at least it isn’t, until Balthazar’s right hand is jumping a wide distance back and forth, then jumping even farther, passing over almost a third of the keys in between each quick note. Dean doesn’t know much about piano playing, but he’s seen pianos played before, and as he watches he begins to understand. This wasn’t the sort of piece, like the previous one, that one played for emotional impact. Nor was it the sort of thing like Cas had played, that made for an enjoyable ambiance. This wasn’t the sort of piece people liked to
“Tell me.” The sheriff gives him this condescending look like he thinks he’s the toughest lawman in the West. “Why’d you take a job for less pay than you get here?” Dean’s blood wants to boil, and it’s taking all Dean’s experience as a whore not to let it. At least this one he knows the answer to.
They keep arguing like that; the whole trip they argue like that, and while it’s annoying, Dean finds it comfortable; it feels like home. But then sometimes it hurts for the same reason, when he thinks about Charlie, Sammy, and Adam fighting over the last bite of dinner, or Krissy and Jo stealing each other’s clothes, or all six of them arguing over who could take how many coyotes in a fight. Cas catches him sometimes, being distracted or sad, and cheers him up with a touch or a kiss.
Dean starts doing some mental calculations. They said John hadn’t touched Jo last night. Probably he’d drunk a lot. Probably ranted and railed all night. Strange, that he hadn’t outright said what’d happened. Must have been ashamed over it. Probably needed to feel big, after. So he’d fired Rufus, probably gave him a big bullshit speech while he was at it. Then bossed the kids around til sleep took him. Probably he was still asleep at this hour. It was just Jo and Krissy at home with him now. Probably that was alright. Probably. Maybe. His head hurts.
Donna waves them goodbye from the porch as they ride west out of town. Dean doesn’t bother to rein in Baby as she stretches her legs, easily outpacing Sue-Anne. Soon it’s just the two of them, a man and his horse, both of them with their eyes on the horizon. There’s a question, a prick of guilt in the back of his head that feels just the same as Adam’s accusing glare, but Dean bats it away with a reassuring thought.
Dean sits back down and reads through the list, like he didn’t just say that. “Let’s see what we got here… ‘Is it true what they say about Sister Jo?’” He blinks up at Cas. “What do they say?”
“That didn’t take very long,” he comments, and Dean cracks up, forehead resting against his shoulder. Cas smiles despite himself. Dean’s laugh sounds good. It feels good, too, the vibrations of it humming through him alongside the aftershocks of orgasm.
Dean had put an end to it, whatever it meant. He’d shaved Cas himself. He has the feeling of having stepped into a puddle much deeper than he’d anticipated— a lake, maybe an ocean. He’s never seen the ocean before. “So you don’t eat bacon?” he manages.
, staring into Cas’s downcast eyes. Fine. Dean could play by the rules. He was shitty at talking anyway.
And that, more than anything else, is what makes him hate himself. He hates himself for being happy, away from the kids. He hates himself for wanting this, for thinking it could actually happen. He hates himself just the same as Adam hates him, for getting out.
Her dark eyes flick over him, judging him one way or another. She turns and opens the door, then stands there in it, bracing herself against the frame, red nails on white paint. “I’ll give you half an hour to pack up.”
“‘Course you can. You’re my best friend. It’s just hard for her, you know. You’re kind of her momma. Closest thing she’s got to one, anyway.”
“You been shaving, too.” Dean taps Cas’s chin briefly before letting his hand fall. Cas’s hand raises to that spot self-consciously.
Their mornings grow longer, more comfortable, and also more maddening. They hold hands, now, as they fall asleep and after they wake up. They turn off multiple alarms, in order to lie in bed, awake. They press foreheads to napes, they shuffle awkwardly when one of them gets an erection, their feet touch when fumbling positions. Never do they say a simple ‘good morning.’
Dean stares at John until he decides he’s telling the truth. “It’s gonna stay that way. You hear me, John?” Dean leans down to him real close. “You lay a finger on her, or Krissy, or any of them, ever again, and I’ll kill you myself.”
He probably isn’t wrong about that. He keeps kissing Cas, anyway, pressing his hips against the counter and sucking his lips one by one, like if he was slow and steady enough at it, eventually he’d pull gold from them. Bela steps around them in the tiny room, grabbing some thing or other, and leaves them in peace. Dean kisses Cas a little more, but it’s starting to get frustrating, and he pulls away, asking, “You got your gear?”
Sister Jo’s voice follows them down the hall as he leads Cas out. “And I want you back here in one minute, Dean Winchester!”
So Dean shuts up. He wiggles around until he finds a more comfortable position, still with his head on Cas’s chest and Cas’s hands holding him there, but with his arms not in so much danger of falling asleep. He listens to Cas breathe: in and out, up and down. Too relaxed to be awake, too angelic to be asleep. Dean fiddles with the sheets, wrinkling them in his fingers.
“You are, Dean. You came because you wanted to. But you can come again if you want to. You can take my cock if you want to. You can do whatever you want.”
When Cas wakes, Dean’s nowhere to be found. The clock on the nightstand says it’s noon. Cas blinks awake and makes himself get up. Human things to do. He urinates, washes his face, and finds himself clean clothes to wear. By the time he gets to the kitchen he feels like a human again. He doesn’t see Dean all day.
Cas sighs. “You already have this picture. Hire a shill if you need more authenticity. We’re not interested.”
Dean follows instructions perfectly, silently. Cas turns the crop in his hand and smacks himself gently in the palm. It’s a cheap toy, a piece of plastic. He could do worse to Dean with his bare hands. He’s done worse to Dean with his bare hands. This was nothing.
That voice. Dean’s breath comes a little shaky. He’s not going to fall for one of his johns. He’s not like Donna, falling silly over every man treats her half-decent. He knows better. He does. Shit. He drains his glass. Cas turns to a fresh page and starts sketching again.
Cas looks down at his frock, as if to verify this. “Thank you,” he says again, like a shy little politeness machine. “I had a meeting with a realtor today.”
Dean had called him a brother once before, and it hadn’t been heartbreaking. It had felt like almost picking every pin in a lock but one: not good enough to be freeing, but almost. It shouldn’t have hurt the second time he said it, either. Cas knew Dean well enough to expect it. He should have expected it. Maybe if he had, it wouldn’t have been so crushing.
had been novel to Cas, and he’d loved to see what things Dean had deemed worth keeping, how he’d organized them, how his mind had worked. Everything was always cleaner and more logical when Dean was happy. Things seem clean now. Cas wonders why Dean hadn’t been sleeping well.
“Not if he was going to shoot you,” says Charlie quietly, so Dean gets up and leaves. Baby still had some energy left in her; they could go for a ride, maybe get this anger out of his system.
Dean tears his eyes away to check on his expression. Cas's eyes are closed, content. Rainbows from the wings dart across his cheek, the white light throwing his profile into sharp relief.
And the hell did Cas think Dean did all day? Dean’s more than a little offended. “I’m a goddamn professional here. You think I can’t handle it?”
“Don’t you worry,” he assures Cas. “Charlie and Sam are the smartest people I know. Even smarter than the two of you. They’ll figure something out.”
They enter summer proper, and it turns hot as hell as they head farther south. Dean is glad that they’re going downhill for it, and even more glad when the land flattens out and there are no more hills or mesas to dodge. Most of the journey passes that way— hot, flat, and dusty, with brothers arguing in Dean’s ears and hope for the future in his heart.
They’ve been here before. Dean had asked him for things like this a few times, had explained how it worked and what he wanted. He’d even purchased materials: a riding crop, for one, which Cas had used on him a few times before relegating it to the back of his closet for almost a year now.
The drive back to the bunker is charged with a strange energy. Cas’s words seem to have penetrated every Winchester there, and so the time passes mostly in silence, radio off. Dean is sitting beside Cas in the backseat, and he can feel the resentment radiating off him. He glances over, but Cas is staring resolutely out the window. That angry “You’re welcome” seems to fill the space between them, only a foot or so of distance in the tiny car. Maybe that’s why, to his own surprise, Dean is the first to break.
He next sees Cas only a few hours later, when he’s eating leftover tacos in the kitchen. Jack and Cas enter together, and Cas immediately gets a panicked look on his face.
He fills the cloth with water and wets Cas down, then starts scrubbing soap in his hair and over his face. Cas dunks to rinse, overcrowding the tub, then comes back up all wet and scraggly-looking, wiping water from his eyes.
“Yeah, baby. Of course it is.” Dean thinks he can hear Cas groan. He’s not far from groaning himself. He’s fully hard now. “What— what do we do, in your fantasies?”
“Well, hey. I’d do anything for you, baby,” he says, meaning to throw Cas a roguish grin but aware that it doesn’t come out that way; the words feel too honest, and by the time he gets to the flirty smile, all he can manage is something small and sincere and embarrassing as hell.
“Yes. I’m ecstatic. Really.” Dean has to push back all the invading doubts and barricade them with that sentence and remind himself that Cas was the sort of man who actually meant what he said.
Hell, if they ain’t wet already, it’s a miracle. Dean closes his eyes and tries to remind himself that he’s a professional. “Anything you want, angel. Anything.”
“Huh.” Cas watches the idea settle into Dean’s brain. A smile spreads across his features. “Yeah, why not?”
“We should go.” Before Dean can stop him, he’s unhooked their hands and picked up the shopping bags. Dean follows behind, wondering what it can be that Cas was trying to say.
They kiss for a long time, then they cuddle, holding each other close and not saying anything. Maybe it’s Dean’s imagination, but he feels like Cas is holding him tighter than before, like he’s afraid he’s going to go. Dean knows he’s doomed to stay. His tears drip silently into a stranger’s rug.
Cas comes up to the bar. “I, uh, convinced the others that the cattle could handle a push, and two days of grazing here.”
“Are you kidding me?” Dean leans down over Cas’s head and runs his hands through his hair, mussing it more, so that it’s big and sexy and says something like ‘property of Dean Winchester for the next eon.’ “I’m never letting you leave this room.”
Cas tips his hat. He cuts a nice figure, with his grey hat on the black horse. “Much obliged,” he says, like a regular cowpoke.
“Sam and Jessica can visit and have a much-needed break. I can play, and you can sing, and Jack can watch the baby.”
“Hm.” Cas leans harder against him and nods against his mouth, kissing him deep and slow. “Gonna ride you tonight,” he promises in that God-given voice, sending tingles all through Dean. “Ride you good and hard.”
Dean wonders vaguely if Adam was going to fight him, once he told them what had happened. Probably. He was pretty pent up, looking at him. He had that look in his eye, a feeling which Dean knew well, like he could throw a punch any second.
Indeed, the man makes a wheezing sound that could well be laughter unless it was some sort of attack. “Whatever you say, boss.” Two more whistles.
“You mean, how much do I put in?” Charlie corrects bitterly. Charlie was an expert in thievery. Though John wouldn’t let her see the books and ostensibly was the owner and head of Campbell Ranch, Charlie was the one doing all the work, and that allowed her, on occasion, to skim some money off the top for the kids. “Not a lot. But without it Sammy’s got less than tuition from you and his own work. And any less than tuition’s enough to get him throwed outta there.”
Cas grumbles something that might be an apology. He pulls Dean’s hand over to his mouth and kisses it.
It’s a tall man, that much he can tell. Brown boots and britches, a long gait. It had to be Sammy. It had to be.
Cas smiles a sort of wondering smile, and Dean watches him for a moment before, “Forward,” Cas prompts, and he’s stuck posing again.
Dean rolls his eyes and opens the door. “Real mature. Has Jack been taking lessons from you or have you been taking lessons from him?”
No, no. Cas had to know already. And if Cas somehow hadn’t figured it out by now, telling him would only make Dean’s disappearance more confusing. It certainly wouldn’t help anything. It wouldn’t make Cas love him back.
The truth is Dean’s been avoiding Cas’s sweet spot on purpose. The last time he’d fingered him, Cas had gone ahead and jacked himself off while Dean was still working him, which would be all well and good, but Dean needs to get inside Cas tonight. “Don’t you move, now,” he orders. “Don’t need you getting yourself off early again.”
Dean runs. Up the front staircase and around the landing until he’s in front of Bela’s door. He barges in without knocking, and finds her leaned up against the front wall next to the open window, peeking out around sheer purple curtains. She meets his eye warily and Dean comes to stand beside her.
He was always sorry. Just a sorry, nervous, little thing, ready to work himself into another panic. “Alright, tell you what. We—” he gestures between them—“are gonna compromise. Alright? We’ll do both at once. So, we’ll talk, and we’ll drink.”
Dean’s poured him a drink even before he sits down, and Bobby lifts it towards Dean gratefully before taking a swig.
It’s him in his hat—no, maybe a slightly different hat. He’s in profile, sitting tall on a horse, looking over a field of something. Sheep, maybe. There’s little buildings in the distance.
“He wishes. Naw, pick-up riding is what it’s called. Had to jump in and save this guy’s ass. Scraped the edge of the ring getting the horse away from him.”
“I am. I am, I am. Fuck.” Dean’s rubbing himself, enjoying the sensation of his own fingers against his hole, oil dripping down from his ass onto Cas’s balls. “I’m gonna—“ Dean presses a finger in and moans, just writhing and fucking himself over Cas’s body, fucking into Cas’s hand and then onto his own finger, making a display of himself. “Fuck.”
The return journey is strange, at first. They travel by road, for one thing; the freewheeling dust there is almost luxurious after the cactus and burrs of the open range, and while Dean is glad that it’s easier on Baby, he misses knowing that they wouldn’t meet another soul on the journey. There aren’t many travelers on the way, though they do pass through a few little towns, some of them with square pueblo buildings like Santa Fe, but mostly little wooden homesteads like Abilene.
When Dean and Cas had tried to head off at bedtime that first night, Balthazar had complained of being ‘abandoned in the wilderness,’ so they all sleep together by the fire instead. Some nights Cas wakes Dean in the wee hours and they sneak off together, but most of the time they just don’t bother. They had time, now. Each little moment didn’t have to be everything all at once anymore. Dean lets himself get horny, lets himself hold Cas and want him with a warm, patient fancy instead of a ravenous need. They whisper sweet nothings to each other and kiss and make plans for when they get their own room, and if they’re ever too loud about it Bal lets them know.
Cas sighs. “Don’t. It’s not worth it. It’s not just the camera, it’s the film, the negatives, the development solution, the ingredients for flash powder. And it isn’t practical. It doesn’t do anything.”
“—I’ll roll in the dirt if you want. Roll in the cactus. Gonna do whatever the hell you want me to.”
One week becomes two. Their nightly habit is interrupted by a hunt, during which they (the three adults, that is) stay at a motel in Colorado for two days. Dean nobly tries to ‘give’ the single to Sam, citing Sam’s back pain, but Sam offers it to Cas, citing Cas’s insomnia, and neither of them can argue with that. So they spend two nights apart, and Cas tosses and turns again. Was Dean tossing and turning, too?
“Then don’t you worry none,” Dean whispers. “Works just the same in business as it do in pleasure. ’Sides, I’m fixing to take real good care of you.” He moves closer, running a hand down Castiel’s chest, watching his eyes for any sign of alarm. “Poor thing, must be exhausted after riding all day.”
Cas hums, deep and sweet and full of tobacco grit. Lord almighty, the man didn’t even smoke. Dean thinks about the last time he visited, falling asleep with their fingers entwined. He forgets to talk, to entertain, to work.
It couldn’t hurt, though, could it? They’d done it once. It wasn’t such a great violation anymore; if Dean didn’t want him there, he wouldn’t be cruel about asking him to leave.
“—The music director of the New York Philharmonic,” Balthazar explains impatiently. “Do you know what he’s known for? Conducting Wagner.
They stop by Bobby’s weapons trunk and then head out back, Bobby with his hunting rifle, and Dean with a revolver he’d picked out. He hasn’t shot many handguns, just enough to learn and try it out. Just enough to put one in Cas’s hands and teach him to pull the trigger.
“Hold still,” Cas orders irritably. He continues to dab at Dean’s chest, an angry look on his face. Dean pets his hair. It’s getting long now, long enough to curl around his fingers.
“Don’t do this, Cas,” Dean starts following him, walking swiftly down the street, heartbeat starting to escalate into panic.
“That’s good, Dean,” whispers Cas, pumping him slowly as he comes down. “You come so beautifully. Breathe. So good for me.”
“Dean,” he whispers. “Yes, of course I— yes.” He starts kissing the rest of Dean, his neck, his ears, his shoulders.
In between discussing the finer points of the deal, Crowley looks up at Dean with those beetle black eyes, as if to say
Cas shakes his head. “You wouldn’t believe how difficult writing that last letter was for me. I spent so much time on it.”
Oh, yeah? And what do you suggest we do, Sammy? Huh? How do you suggest we fight the all-powerful being holding an icepick in our brains? Huh? How are we supposed to fight him if he’s willing to just—erase who we are?
Cas doesn’t answer. Dean follows, glancing furtively around, self-conscious of their clenched hands. There doesn’t seem to be anyone nearby; the only light is spilling out of the store’s glass doors or filling the parking lot from street lamps. Cas drags him around the side of the building, into the shadows, and before Dean can ask him what the hell he’s doing, a hand has snaked around his neck, lips are locked on his, and Cas is kissing him within an inch of his life. Dean drops the bags. Cas’s other hand finds Dean’s waist, and Cas is attacking him, pushing him back, and Dean has no choice but to stumble a retreat until his back is against the wall and Cas is pressing into him, the rough plaster scratching painfully at his scalp, Cas’s tongue forcibly keeping him mute.
These mountains seem proper enough to Dean, and they feel even more impressive the closer they get, the horses and cattle slowing down as they have to wend back and forth around foothills and the grade of the ground grows steeper.
Cas shakes his head and walks back to the bed. Dean intercepts him by the hips and angles him away from his old spot on the mattress and closer to Dean, so that he’s standing right in front of him, between his legs.
“They don’t mean anything,” Dean explains. “They’re pet names. They just— they mean you’re my guy.” It sends a thrum through him just to say it.
He’s been drinking less and less, under Sister Jo’s sharp eye. That first year had been the worst. He’d never learned to drink quite like John, but he’d gotten close. He’d gotten close enough to understand.
Yeah. Amara told us to go to the Empty, so you don’t want to send me there. I get it. I’d be scared, too.
“You could charge people. Ain’t got no photographer in town. You could charge people and stay here more.”
“Alright, I—“ Dean shifts where he sits, trying to think of where to start. “Let’s see—one time, Daddy was locked up in the sheriff’s office, and there was some traveling fair set up over in Fort Worth, and Charlie and Sammy—you know, they like shit like that— anyhow, they snuck out and went, disappeared for two days. Drove me near crazy. Anyhow. Sheriff got sick of John I guess, and let him out early. He come home, found them gone, got mad, and I was the one got beat. For not watching ‘em.”
“Alright.” Cas breathes slowly, calming himself down. He has a tight grip on Dean’s arm. “Let me go. Alright. I can—alright.” Dean watches him struggle, enraptured by the way his chest rises and falls in and out of the water.
Whatever his name is, the man in black’s eyes glitter knowingly, and it gives Dean a painful, breathless feeling, like he’s just been punched in the gut.
Miguel directs them all to a ranch south of town, and exchanges words with the rancher as the rest of them herd the cattle into the fence and the ranch hands count heads. When they’re done, Miguel rejoins them, and all the cowboys get a cut of the pay. Miguel even gives Dean a few dollars off of his own share, which seems to guilt Tagg into doing the same. After the others move away, Balthazar hands the entirety of his cut to Cas, who similarly separates out a few dollars from each of them for Dean.
Cas stares back. He still looks confused, but he nods yes, so Dean presses up against him, pulls Cas close by his tie, and brings their lips together. Cas’s lips are impossibly gentle, asking for nothing, only giving, and Dean is incredibly aware of himself, of his nakedness, of the towel that won’t stay up much longer, of his already hardening dick. He’s shivering, but not with cold. He opens his mouth wide, invites Cas in, and Cas comes, licking into Dean, drawing moans from him, his hands wandering to Dean’s naked waist. Cas holds him there, pelvises just touching. Dean feels so exposed, so vulnerable. There’s something gratifying about it—and terrifying. Cas could kill him with the wrong word.
Cas can be patient, when he wants to be, and he knows that Dean needs rest. He knows, too, that Dean loves him; there’s no need for nerves.
. He loves it; he wriggles against the restraints just to feel the slide of silk and know that he’s given himself over to this blue-eyed stranger completely.
“‘Course you could. Voice like yours, it’ll be easy. Be good for me, too. Real good for me. You gonna be good for me?”
“That’s… fine,” says Cas slowly, as if only just noticing that Dean is a crazy person. “I thought we could have breakfast. Though you look like you still need a bath.”
Dean keeps talking softly as he swirls his fingers inside Cas, watching Cas’s beautiful panting mouth and heaving chest and flexing arms—
Dean nearly spits whiskey over the bed, but makes it to the chamber pot. He howls with laughter. He bends in half, hanging over the edge of the mattress, his whole body shaking with it. “Fuck off. Hell with you. Hain’t laughed that hard in ages. Shit.” He comes up eyes watering.
Dean is about to ask what’s got her looking at him like he’s just lost his leg in a bear trap, when he hears a loud, familiar voice that makes him push past her and into the parlor.
Dean freezes up for half a second, then makes himself move. He’s already got his own clothes, so he grabs Cas’s too, including his hat, which he sweeps off the floor and onto his head. “Come on, Cas,” says Dean, marching out the room naked but for his head. He dumps everything on a not-so-gross-looking chair in the empty parlor, then leans over and grips the chair back hard in his hands. He counts to ten, and when he looks up, Cas is there.
“I understand what happened, and why. I understand that you feel sorry for doing it, and that it won’t happen again, but that doesn’t change—“ Cas’s brow furrows. “That doesn’t change the fact that it happened, or that you lied about it. And it doesn’t change the fact that Fergus is never going to let me forget it.”
Only a few minutes later, Dean is turning into a dark alleyway. It’s not on the path to the house, at least not as the angel flies, so Cas watches curiously as Dean parks the vehicle and looks over at him as if he has something to say.
It wasn’t morning, but that’s how they talked in the house. Anytime before 3 o’clock in the afternoon was morning. “Here for my whiskey,” Dean tells her.
Dean licks into Cas’s mouth unashamedly. Cas doesn’t protest; his hands come to rest on Dean’s back, holding him steady. Everything’s hot in the water. Their dicks touch, awkwardly bumping against each other’s stomachs and sending a thrill of excitement up Dean’s spine. Cas’s mouth is just as open and eager as Dean’s and when Cas pulls Dean off him a few minutes later, he’s gasping.
They both stare, and the word hangs between them. As if Dean’s heart hasn’t been working hard enough, now it really kicks into gear, unable to take back anything his fool mouth had said. He can only stand there and stare at Cas and hope he doesn’t tear him open.
Cas pulls out, slow and slick and weird-feeling again now that they’re not fucking, and then he collapses onto his back next to Dean. Dean rolls onto his side to stare. He runs a hand through Cas’s hair and then pets his face softly when Cas doesn’t respond.
“I promise,” says Cas, and Dean stares at him in shock. “I promise to stay by your side, if you promise to be honest with me.”
He starts to come back to reality as they prickle with sensation, as he finds himself able to lie on his back proper, as Cas rubs his palms gently with worn, dry fingers.
“Well he’s queer as the fourth of July and all the girls are busy working, so I don’t see how that’s concerning to you.”
Whiplash. Loving Dean was constant whiplash. Cas drops his head back against the pillow and holds his bundle of clothing close, trying to recover. The wake of Dean’s anger still simmers throughout the room, throughout his own bones. So much for making things better, then. Cas had expected the sex to appease Dean, but if anything it seems to have made things even worse. And he still has his betrayal to enact.
“I do, Cas. I want you. Want you inside. Want you hammering me. Fuck.” Dean squirms to his left and reaches awkwardly for the chest. He pulls out the jar of oil there and starts slicking up his hole, still writhing hungrily against Cas, dripping onto the sheets. “‘M so ready for you.”
Eventually, the lantern flickers out. It’s hot under the blanket, the wool much too much for a Texas March. Dean can feel himself starting to doze, though it’s still early.
Dean shakes his head in wonder. “Bet you’re a real good daddy.” He glances back up, and Cas is giving him a funny look. “What?”
Like all of Cas’s letters, it’s far too honest, even more so than Cas was in person. It doesn’t escape Dean’s notice that Cas has sent him something far more similar to a confession of love than an apology. The word
That gets Dean’s attention pretty quickly, and he has to strain not to lean into Castiel’s hot breath. Castiel lingers there for a second, mouth open and hot and driving Dean wild. Dean’s dick begins to twitch in anticipation before Castiel finally kisses it again through the fabric, slowly working it with his tongue, the sensation rough and wet and perfect.
Cas takes a step closer. He reaches out and fondles the corner of Dean’s bandana. “That’s true,” he whispers, sending shivers through Dean’s neck and back. “And you have a beautiful smile. And you know how you look, which makes it all worse, somehow. You’re impossible to say no to.” Cas leans forward, and Dean tilts his head for the kiss, but with a click, Balthazar’s door is open and Cas freezes before reaching his mouth.
Cas groans in anticipation. He leans over Dean and puts a hand on the wall, remembers the sensation of Dean writhing against his mouth and crying out his name. His hand speeds up on his cock. The momentum builds. He isn’t allowed to tell Dean how beautiful he looks. “Fuck,” Cas curses quietly instead. “Fuck.”
“It’s different,” Dean snaps. It’s important, that he leave, not just to make Cas stop talking, but to make himself stop everything, now that he’s physically pushed Cas, now that Cas is holding his own shoulder and acting like nothing’s wrong. But Cas keeps objecting.
An elbow presses between his shoulder blades. Cas leans down over him, breath tickling in his hair. “Can I spank you?”
Despite the restless night he’s up at the crack of dawn, before either of the brothers. He paces around the room. He’s dying to go knock on Cas’s door, but knows waking him’s the worst possible way to get in his good graces. Finally he decides to read, but when he goes looking through his pack for a novel he finds the one with Cas’s letters stuffed into it, and ends up going through those instead.
soak back into him. He isn’t sure how long he stands there—a long time, more than long enough to fill the large room with steam—before a voice echoes through the air.
Dean nods. He watches Cas carefully. There’s something different about him, and it isn’t just the humanity. He seems… fragile.
They pick Cas up in an alleyway behind some tacky church in Amarillo. His eyes are shining with life, and Dean Winchester, who had believed himself to be broken beyond repair, starts to pick up the pieces of himself. He rushes to Cas, holds him tight and keeps thinking it even after speaking:
He starts talking nonsense. He tells Cas he’s gorgeous, he’s perfect, he’s beautiful. He keeps talking, meanwhile Cas is going insane from want, leaking into his too-slow hand. Dean won’t shut up. Cas grabs Dean forcibly by the back of his head and pulls him close, staring at him in his stupid, beautiful eyes.
It’s so good, so big and full and good. Cas goes slowly, dribbling more oil onto them, moving slowly in and out while Dean quivers there, egging him on with eager sounds as they get more and more slick, each movement coming easier, Cas sliding into Dean as easy as if it was God’s own will and driving Dean crazy with how gentle he’s being. Soon—thank God—Cas pulls Dean’s hair, lifts his head up and fucks into him harder, harder,
“Yeah, well, maybe you was right,” says Bobby gruffly, getting him a glass of water. “Shouldn’t have said those things. Not at the man’s funeral.” Dean takes the water and sits at the table. “Whiskey?” Bobby offers.
He thinks about Sister Jo pulling him out of the smelly old saloon and dragging him back to the house.
to settle down and sleep. He waits until Sam passes out, then gestures to Cas and walks him to the parking lot.
“Bal helped you. And Sister Jo. Bobby’s the one who bought that gun in the first place. And my momma—she’s the one kept it around. I done showed you how to shoot the damn thing. Hell, even John went and got himself nice and drunk for you.”
“The sheriff took pity on him, and it all got hushed up. He and his momma got to live together without being afraid. Then, he told me, one day he seen it in Daddy’s eyes. He hadn’t actually done nothing; Bobby just seen his daddy in his eyes that day, and that’s when he went and bought that gun. And then he spent hours talking at me, apologizing for never shooting the man himself. Can you imagine? Apologizing for not shooting my daddy. And I thought, I should smack this man. And then I thought, well he should know, though. But then I thought, maybe he’s just psychologically justifying his own past actions and his opinion is actually the least reliable.”
“Ain’t never gonna touch you like that again, Cas,” Dean promises. “If I do, you take your brother’s gun and shoot me dead, hear?”
He’s trying to adjust to the sight of Cas “Smiley” Milton, the gruff cowpoke best known in his hometown for shooting a man in cold blood, in bed with a kid who obviously trusted him over anything else in the world.
“Well, I’ll take a raincheck on being, uh, shower buddies, but what say we start with a drink, huh?”
Sweet thing. Dean’s been waiting weeks for that sweetness; now here it is and it hits him like a ton of bricks. He’s not sure he’s ready for so much sweetness, not sure it won’t lay him low. “Cas, darlin’,” says Dean, walking forward and running a hand along the seam of Cas’s vest. “You said it yourself; we done made an appointment.”
“No.” Cas stares him straight on, a determined look in his eye. A lie that made itself true in the telling.
“Don’t leave.” Blue eyes. It makes Dean lick his lips, looking at Cas like this. It makes him want to straddle him proper, kiss him silly, see how that look changed when he started riding him. And yeah, if they got to be naked and staring at each other like this, Balthazar could have a little chew tonight. “I already spoke with Sister Jo about it. Is she good for her word?”
“Tell, me, Dean,” says Crowley as Dean starts pouring the drinks. “Have you seen a man in here by the name of Castiel Shurley?”
“Alright, alright, we can talk,” says Dean. “First you ask what I wanna do, then you say we got to do what you wanna do. I’m just trying to keep up.”
“Treat you right. Fuck you so good. We can do whatever we want, in our home. Can tie you up and suck you and fuck you, fuck you every day. Fuck.”
