John feels deep down as if he should be bothered by that – that and a million other things that just happened, but instead all he does is lean forward and kiss Sherlock’s forehead softly, the same way he’d done to him just that morning by the Jeep. Something flashes through Sherlock’s eyes, something mournful and sad, but it’s gone before John can even process it, or memorize the way it subtly changes the lines around Sherlock’s eyes. He gazes down at him for another moment, waiting for Sherlock to speak. When he doesn’t, John scoots down and lets himself fall limp into the quick, strong grasp of Sherlock’s arms around him. Sherlock reaches over and pulls across one edge of the blanket to cover their skin from the cool sea breeze, and he continues to stroke up and down John’s back while John places his ear right over the thrum of his heartbeat.
The announcement to prepare for the descent sounds in the stale air of the plane, and John presses his forehead to the cold glass once more. The stewardess passes by one last time to pick up trash, and John feels like the scum of the earth for not even looking her direction.
Sherlock gently shakes his head against John’s back, inhaling and exhaling in a slow, careful rhythm.
“You like it, don’t you?” Sherlock rumbles.
He takes a hesitant step forward in the hallway, unsure if he’s even heading the right way.
Watson, holding back a laugh: “What, you were going to just . . . call me up when you got back from the summit?”
“If you think all this smirking is going to make me want to do what you say tomorrow evening, I can assure you it will have the exact opposite effect.”
Behind them, the crowd cheers, ooh’s and aah’s after every turn, every fierce drop, every new twist in the course as Sherlock’s thighs fight for control against gravity, flying at ninety-miles-an-hour, his forearms flapping the gates hard enough to echo down the mountain. Sheets of snow and ice fly up with his skis, and John thinks that surely he’s never skied this fast in his life, this must be some sort of record. And there’s an ironic comfort, too, in watching Sherlock ski down a mountain, John’s eyes watering as he squints through the sun’s glare to watch the black speck speed through the trees. Here, at least, he knows what role to play: the awestruck cheerleader, the man who can’t believe he’s lucky enough to see the eyes behind the goggles, who takes fierce pride in Sherlock’s strength, his utter focus.
John’s eyes light up as he looks ahead at the stretch of road, and he covers Sherlock’s hand on his knee with his own. “I love you,” he says. He covers his mouth with the hand that had been hanging out the window, and the corners of his eyes crinkle as he slowly shakes his head. “God help me, I do.”
He’ll have to see Scotty Holmes again.
He feels oddly ridiculous, almost embarrassed, at the passing thought of any of his squadron seeing him now—playing dress up in the snow just to race around and shoot a fake pellet gun and win a useless medal—as if people didn’t die before his eyes in the sand, faces twisted with terror. As if John’s prosthesis glinting in the harsh sun—the metal with two sets of initials engraved behind the knee, and a black skull painted into the joint—is simply an inspiring Paralympic
Watson, roughly: “They . . . they tell you to learn your gut, in the army. To trust what you feel . . .”
I didn’t end up getting John his coffee after putting down my pen on Christmas morning.
in the most buried part of his mind. Three weeks that had confirmed to him that he was gay, and that he was a human being outside of a pair of skis, and that he could have a
“There you are, Mr. Holmes!” the intern is chattering, hovering by him like a nervous insect. “Oh thank God, we thought—you see, since the call time was an hour ago, we weren’t sure if—and we couldn’t get a hold of—”
I wake up screaming and drenched in sweat. I force my body to get up and move. If I stay in the tent I’ll stay frozen in that huddled up position forever. I walk back and forth cross the dark meadow clutching a blanket round my shoulders like a ghost. Five minutes later I hear the faintest whisper of the harmonica driftin’ down to me through the pass. It’s Water-Walking Jesus.
Watson: “There. That’s us that first night we met. Buddy of mine took it before we . . . er, before we left the bar. You get the idea.”
He rounds the final curve into the stadium headed straight for the shooting lanes, his strides long and strong. Kuznetsov is still lying on his belly, aiming for his fourth shot. Vanko’s setting up his third.
(And honestly, even I'm still confused about who wins what how. The Classes are all very confusing. So even if I'm totally wrong above . . . that's at least how it's working in this fic. Forgive me.)
John follows Sherlock off to the side, cringing at himself for being afraid to even look down unless he lets Sherlock out of his sight. The three inches between their shoulders buzzes and thrums. It’s all John can think about. How if he just leaned slightly to the right, if he just shifted his weight in the sand, he could feel Sherlock Holmes’ warmth on his skin, a reminder that he’s here and alive and breathing. Not floating pale in the black deep with seaweed covering his face.
Then, suddenly, we’re thrown underneath a helicopter, watching from a camera as the landing skids slowly lower to the ice in a blurring cloud of snow.
The pier is deathly cold. Icy wind whipping across my face from the roaring waves, sinking straight through my skin to my bones. I curse under my breath and shiver, pulling my coat tighter around my strong frame. I marvel at the way my skin fits my body tight and smooth. Marvel once more at the way the ground stays steady underneath my feet.
His eyes fixate back on John where he stands next to O’Brien near the starting line. To any one of the hundreds of spectators flocking to the beach to see this Final heat, John Watson looks entirely calm. He’s ready in his full wetsuit with his waxed board by his side and a wet towel around his neck, leaning forward to hang in a stretch between his open legs and calmly bobbing up and down like he has all the time in the world.
Sherlock hums. “Getting there.”
I tell him “see you in four months.”
Notes, thoughts, and context:
Simon silently gestures with his hand, and the dog immediately sits, waiting frozen and still.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock whips back around, eyes fierce. “Don’t what? Don’t look out the window of my own house? Don’t help you by getting what you want? Don’t breathe?”
, they wouldn’t bring up . . . they wouldn’t ask about . . .?
He eases his way around the last bend in the road, watching the early sunlight drift through the trees in swaths of swirling gold and expecting to find a quiet, sleepy hut with gently lapping waves. Instead he nearly jumps out of his skin when he hears “John, you’re here! Excellent. I see you ate breakfast. Coffee before we go?”
approved that is—”
Greg nods, a simple understanding, no judgement in his eyes. “Actually, yesterday, you were not looking so angry.”
John’s sitting on one of the chairs Scotty moved out to his porch, practically devouring the spicy rice dish Scotty seemed to whip up out of thin air once they made their way back from the shore. He’s wearing a borrowed pair of Scotty’s sweats and an old, worn Grateful Dead t-shirt that he doesn’t fully believe Scotty just randomly bought at a Goodwill. They sit and look out over the moonlit ocean, illuminated by the lights still on inside the hut, pouring golden pools through the windows. John feels like he’s lived in this place for a hundred years. The thought of leaving to go home in a bit churns in the pit of his gut like lead, yanking him down from the heavenly daydream he’d been living all day.
, seriously, we’re in public—”
But it isn’t there.
Time stretches out before him like eternity. Sherlock knows he’s only been out there for five minutes, only stopped paddling and stopped to perch on his board thirty seconds ago. But now Sherlock also knows, deep in the pit of his soul, that John Watson is waiting for him back on the sand, waiting to tell him “I love you.” And he knows, for the first time in his entire life with certainty, that the ocean will carry him back to shore and not leave him to roam out towards the horizon forever.
“But you didn't say I was right. About you and Sherlock. You said maybe.”
Watson nods his silent answer, gives her a quiet smile, then clears his throat.
“You came back for me,” he grits out, voice thin. “You
“Don’t worry, John, you’ve already made that point loud and clear, several times.”
Hours pass. I don’t eat nothing. The months of livin’ in the trailer have taken me back in time to when I was fresh out the army hospital, feeling clothes sag off of me that used to fit tight. I know I should get up and shave, wash my face, cook up some toast at least and then sit down listing who I oughta go see to ask about work.
Cut back to their flat. Watson is rising to clear away plates and start washing in the sink while Holmes smirks. Before Watson can walk away, Holmes leans over and picks up the last bite of Watson’s slice of cake with his fingers and steals it, tossing it into his mouth.
Greg runs his own fingers through John’s hair, smoothing it back into place, then smirks. “It is difficult, very difficult, not to be taking these clothes off you right now.
Sherlock wants to say something horribly amusing and clever about Group Captain John Watson coming out in full force in the shadows, but then John’s mouth is on his in a desperate, bruising kiss, sighing across his tongue and filling Sherlock’s mouth with wet heat.
Greg feels like he’s turning in slow motion, every sound echoing strangely in his ears, when he recognizes the American coach from earlier coming up behind him. He realizes he’s briefly met him before, back when they both wore racing suits.
He squats on his screaming thighs, trusting the joint on his right leg to work smoothly and hold his weight, and he coasts around the bend to complete his first of three laps, coming back in view of the stadium and grandstands.
.” Outside the window, snow flurries whisper against the glass, fogging it up with steam.
He sits next to me by the fire like our conversation the other day didn’t even happen. I can’t help it. I reach up without even thinking and brush the leaves out of his hair, lettin’ my fingers trail through the tangles in his curls. I pull my hand back when I realize what I’ve just done, stare straight at the fire until the flames begin to hurt my eyes. He wraps his elbows round his knees and takes another long drink. He shakes his head and gives a little huff of a laugh.
The sound of a distant helicopter interrupts his words. He freezes, mouth-open, and looks over his shoulder. The red chopper carrying Holmes and the other half of the rescue team is on its way back, flown by Robbie who’d come to get them after Greg tried to fly Watson and the patient to the hospital at Visp.
“I should have?” John’s eyes grow impossibly large, and Greg has the sudden conviction that the pilots serving under him must have been terrified when John was disappointed. Scared out of their wits. “You were the one who had
Greg had known even back in London, standing at the top of the stairs. He had known when John stepped into the medical room and immediately took Sherlock into his arms, and not Greg. Had known when the two of them showed up in his room in the middle of the night, breathless from sprinting across the Village from security and kissing in the snow.
The second time it happens, Greg lifts an eyebrow. Sherlock shakes his head, chest panting under his thin lycra.
He’d even kept half-expecting to hear Greg’s voice over the intercom in his best Coach Tone: “Sherlock Holmes, please report to the Coach’s office immediately; you are very much in trouble and you very well know it.” Or whatever eloquent-sounding French gibberish Greg would come up with instead. Maybe he’d even wanted Greg to seek him out in the crowd and slog him right in the face. At least that would mean that he was on Greg’s mind still, that he hadn’t been written off the second he stupidly, unforgivably, chaotically, (tenderly, lovingly) bent to kiss John Watson’s stunned, grinning mouth in the trampled snow.
“Watson? You in there?” Yells a voice through the thick metal.
Gerold, sighing in relief: “Thank God. Are you bringing him to Visp?”
John stands dangerously close to Scotty in the tiny kitchen, watching his chest rise and fall into the silent, buzzing air of the room. He knows he should say something about that. Change the subject or take a step back or ask him for more or
John thinks of the desert—the way the sand looked like silk from the cockpit at dawn. He thinks of Sherlock’s careful fingers removing his leg the other night. Greg’s lips pressed to his hair in a simple kiss.
“Word got to my father at work on the base pretty fast. Day I turned fifteen I was coming home from being at the beach really early in the morning and all my stuff was in a bag on the front steps.”
Sherlock hums softly, and suddenly the yearning in John’s chest grows so strong he thinks he’ll moan out loud at the clutch of it. “I know Hank’s already watching the shop for a few days but . . . you think we can ask him to add a few more?”
But he would never want me to Stay. And that’s why I’m sorry.
Bien sûr que non  :  Of course not.
Then, in brilliant letters across the screen, the final standings are announced, next to each skier’s Second Round time.
“Sherlock?” John sighs. “Sherlock, are you even listening to us?”
I never want to hear her voice again. I clear my throat away from the receiver. “We herded sheep together up on Baker one summer back in ’65,” I say.
He doesn’t turn his head away from the first blue flag as a shocked gasp makes its way through the course attendants. Sherlock’s fingers grip his poles hard enough to break the carbon and aluminum in two. He doesn’t move away his bandana to speak.
Cut back to Watson still lying on his back on the asphalt. His chest is still heaving, and he rubs his palm up over his face. The sky above him looks endless – a clear and empty blue.
One night I’m out way past dark tryna find a runaway runt that got stuck down in a ravine. I cut my hand on a thorn mighty bad draggin’ it out, and by the time the whole ordeal is over my stomach is screaming for food and my hand is bleedin’ so bad I know I won’t make it through the night up in that field without going back to camp. A lifetime of cowboyin’ tells me that that same runt is gonna end up back in the ditch during the night if I leave and sleep back at the camp, but my belly feels hot and empty and the whipping air is turning the blood dripping down my palm into an ice slick, so I pack up the pup tent and saddle up my horse to return.
“But they don’t tell you what it’s like . . . to feel like a fucking old man and a teenager at the same time. Right? Like you’ve seen more shit than most people see in eighty years, seen people die on the ground, just drop and breathe their last breath right in front of you even though you’re the last choice of person they’d ever want to do that in front of, and you were just playing poker with them six hours ago and talking about their girl they got back home. But then out you come out of the jungle dragging their bones behind you and you’re still stuck the same way you were when you first stepped on the fucking boat. No change at all. Nobody tells you what to do about that.”
Watson, loudly: “He’s stable! Let me finish patching up the cut on his face, then I’ll be there.”
” came spitting out, right before he turned his back on Greg like a two-year-old, then dared him with just a look to take the bait and scold him. To which Greg had wanted to kick the leg of the exam table as hard as he could and tell Sherlock that he wouldn’t be tempted to treat him like a child if Sherlock hadn’t spent the last half hour criticizing every word out of Greg’s mouth, insisting everyone was overreacting about
Sherlock jogs a step to catch up. “I’m starting to realize that,” he says under a chuckle. He amazes himself how easily the laugh falls from his lips.
We stop for a rest halfway back down the mountain, letting the sheep graze on a flattened out meadow. We sit a couple feet apart up on a hill and watch.
He takes in a deep breath, presses his bare hands to the freezing metal of the fire escape, and begins to climb. The dull ache in his sore muscles feels good as he heaves himself up the rails, using body parts that haven’t been taxed day-in and day-out by his ski training. Sherlock can almost believe that he doesn’t have the crippling expectation of an Olympic Gold medal pressing down on his shoulders. That he has nobody to please, nobody to prove wrong, nobody to make proud. That he can just climb and climb and climb and do something impressive that has nothing to do with skis.
Just a heads up that Gus Kenworthy does not exist in this universe. If that makes sense to you, cool. If that doesn't make sense to you, also cool.

Alors : so
They hadn’t really said a single word to each other since. Had woken up, gotten ready, and come down to breakfast all in uneasy silence—a silence which Greg realizes a second too late that Sherlock is about to break. He only has time to be grateful that Sherlock is glaring at
Nearly an hour later, once he’s wound his way through the miles of endless lines and check-in points, John peeks across the table at the old-fashioned paper list in the woman’s hands and sees that he’s one of only a handful of Paralympic athletes already there—just him and what look like the cross country racers and curlers, whose events are overlapping way earlier into the ‘normal Olympics’ block of time. The woman seated in her crisp Olympics uniform gives him a warm smile as she hands him his room key and information packet, practically beaming, as if she’s trying to make up for the fact that John’s the only one in line at the smallest check-in table, all the way in the corner.
John rolls his eyes and shakes his head down at his board, flinging himself down onto his stomach to try and catch up to Greg, cutting through the sharp, clear water with his arms as they race out to the rolling horizon.
“Wait!”
“Aw, come on then, bring her along. My wife will be there, too. Let us meet your date!”
Where I stand it’s just grey and quiet and soft, the bones of the eternal city exposed beneath the layers of makeup painted across her face for each Time. In a way it feels like the twin of myself – exposed in a bright blue shirt in the moonlight, stripped bare for the very first time in decades from the layers of War and Catherine and
Sherlock’s shoulders are tight, and he stares at John’s hand.
A few quick words on surfer culture (based on my admittedly rough understanding as a more casual fan):
John reaches up to cup Sherlock’s face gently in his palm, and Sherlock turns his face softly into the touch, breath shuttering out his nose as a wet sheen glosses over his eyes. John’s chest clenches.
Trento. Sherlock and John in a race through the trees, gliding over fresh snow, Greg following their lovingly carved tracks. There is no denying it. He had loved skiing, then. Had loved it with every drop of blood in his veins. Every particle of freezing air in his lungs.
“Bit late for a jog, isn’t it?”
Greg keeps looking straight ahead, as if nobody else is there, as if it’s just him and the snow. Then he shakes his head once. “That is the thing with Holmes. Realistic—there is no such thing. But . . . there is not a chance. No. Not on this course. He will be . . . somewhere in the middle.”
And John hadn’t noticed. Hadn’t even seen that Sherlock’s time tracker had shown him in red compared to the current first place time. The journalists gasp next to him, frantically whispering into microphones—
“You have me,” Greg whispers, straight into John’s ear. And he’s grunting in that way he only ever does with John, when they’re thrusting and tangled, when Greg’s teeth are grazing across John’s skin, and they’re both
“You’ve complicated matters, John Watson,” he says breathlessly.
Interviewer, teasing: “Did you now? With ‘someone’ who?”
Greg kneels again, this time not bothering to hide his wince, but John doesn’t move to help. Instead he leans back, internally cursing his heart for racing over something that should be nothing more than a tiresome routine, and he presents his thigh.
Sherlock, my lovely Sherlock. My handsome, fierce, gladiator of a husband. He let the silence drag on until he was finally standing, and then he turned and faced Lestrade head on, like a soldier before battle. It was glorious. And then Lestrade said, “you bastard” with a gigantic smile, and he walked forward and awkwardly leaned across and to the side of Sherlock’s belly to wrap him in a huge hug. I heard them whispering to each other, and saw a small smile at the corner of Sherlock’s lips. Even now I have no idea what was said. And then Lestrade pulled back, and pulled a card out of his jacket pocket.
John swallows hard and slips his shades back over his eyes to hide the panic he knows is showing. The conversation is proving an unsurprising but still terrifying reminder of how careless he’s gotten with his looks at Greg. His stomach fights against the banana and slice of bread he ate earlier before his heat as he agonizes over whether Greg’s ever noticed him checking out his ass as he paddles out in front of him in the early morning waves day after day.
John places one last gentle kiss on Sherlock’s wet lips before pulling back and resting their noses together, drawing in the warm scent of his skin. The smell of the ocean embedded into the freckles on his cheeks.
“It’s not really important,” he says lightly. He runs his cold thumb slowly across my lower lip. I barely resist the urge to lick the tip with my tongue. My eyes are huge and fixed on him. “Later,” he whispers.
Maybe. But probably not. The human body's only able to go so fast on a pair of skis, etcetera, etcetera.
Because he had been gone. Gone this entire month. And now I had my husband back, naked and glowing in the fluorescent light of our bathroom.
She’d smiled at me, and I’d seen the weary exhaustion in her eyes. Possibly it had always been there and I’d never been alive enough to notice. “I’ve spent the week in contact with the carers for Mr. Holmes,” she’d said. She’d brushed the dust and wrinkles from the old suit in the dreary light. “Bit of red tape – all that,” she’d said lightly, “but as long as you take some extra dosages this morning at breakfast you should be in the clear for your visit.”
My mind goes empty on the drive back. Before I know it I’m pullin’ up outside Alma and Monroe’s place ‘stead of my little room back off the dirt highway. Who knows why my hands and feet take me there. They got themselves a nice little place in the new suburbs now – all white painted porches and shiny green lawn and a brand new Chevette parked out in the driveway. Before I can hightail it outta there Alma Jr. sees me from where she’s sittin’ staring at nothing on the porch railing and comes runnin’ down the grass in her wide leg jeans with flowers stitched onto the sides.
The journey through the hallways is a blur of silver and white. Beeping monitors and pale faces and the sharp slap of antiseptic crawling up my nose. The farther we go, the worse the patients look.
John feels like he’s been sucked up into a hurricane, utterly at the mercy of a force of nature. Scotty’s lips move a mile a minute spouting facts and statistics, studies and observations. His eyes rapidly scan John and the horizon and the swells and back to John again. Tracking the waves, the wind, the currents, the correct and incorrect lines of John’s body as he hunkers down across a wave. Scotty drops in with him on barrels, calls out his corrections, tells him how Hawaiian water would be different. He makes John laugh and scoff, roll his eyes and listen with such focus that every cell of his body is zeroed in on the rich sound of his voice. He’s an encyclopedia, and he’s ruthless. Fierce and awkward and ridiculous and terrifying and charming. John finds himself following in his wake like a breathless disciple, amazed and indignant as he tries to hold on for dear life, to just stay afloat in the sheer onslaught that is surfing with Scotty Holmes.
—to make Greg forget that he’s about to helplessly sit and watch his first love try to win an Olympic Gold. That there isn’t anything he can do other than blow into his hands to keep them warm.
salaud : bastard
O’Brien finishes his third major ride of the set and puts up a third score over 7.5 points, accompanied by a wild cheer from the crowd. Sherlock thinks he’s going to be sick.
Scott shifts his legs just barely over the grass. I can see him out the corner of my eye.
John’s heart unexpectedly melts, churning in his chest, and without thinking he leans forward with a sigh and falls into Sherlock’s arms, burying his face against Sherlock’s neck and feeling Sherlock’s hands come up to hold him steadily at his back.
John, who hasn’t answered the half-apologetic, half-pleading texts Sherlock sent him throughout the rest of the afternoon and into the night. Who may very well have already somehow left Korea on an early flight. Who just learned he’d spent two years seeing the falsified version of Sherlock Holmes.
The camera pans through the doorways into the rope storage, the mechanics’ supplies, and another hallway before finally peeking through the doorway of the paramedics’ room.
One hundred and thirty-eight hours, now, as he braces himself against the wind and spray and tracks the current of the waves by the light of the greying stars, memorizing their rises and falls, completing the tables and formulas in his head that will help him pick the largest wave tomorrow at the competition.
, Greg thinks, with a silent, sinking feeling.
Sherlock shrugs and turns back to Greg. “Nothing.”
When he finally looks back over his shoulder, both John and Greg are gone too, having disappeared in opposite directions. Sherlock stops by the dining hall and forces down a grab-and-go turkey sandwich as he walks back to his dorm, cursing John Watson with every mealy, flavorless bite. He obsessively checks the location tracker on his phone, but the dots for John and Greg never move from their respective rooms. He takes a fourth shower. Then a fifth. Then he falls asleep in an unwashed Rossignol jacket at two in the morning.
Greg kisses John’s palm before John can say anything back, and Sherlock wants to bolt upright and beg either of them to say something about the fact that Greg’s eyes had been wet standing out in the freezing snow, to say
The nurse frowns for a moment, oblivious to John’s rambling thoughts, before double-checking his notes on the thick stack of John’s medical records. “Sorry,” he says. “I am not as used to deciphering records in English. Is it just the tight skin that’s causing the impaired movement here?”
). That, in a shocking twist of fate at the end of the day, Sherlock Holmes
someone calls out behind them, their flashlight illuminating the snow where Sherlock sprints. “
“John.”
I realize too late that I’m nearly crying before him. Sherlock’s hand is on my cheek, and I blink out of my thoughts. He looks at me gently, thrumming with concern. “Oh, John,” he says softly. I wince and close my eyes.
“Didn’t study the ocean all these years for nothing,” he says back, sounding bored.
It’s the silent communication we’ve somehow gone and mastered over twenty years, even with a hell of a lot of that time spent aching miles apart. The eyes and the mouths. Lookin’ at each other through the thick, dusty light of our farmhouse, across the front seat of my old truck, over a campfire high up in the clouds. Through the mists on Baker.
best in the sport,” Sherlock murmurs.
“How the hell did you find out where I work?” John asks, not bothering to hide the undertone of a dark challenge in his voice.
“Hey man, mellow out,” Greg says. “I can hear your brain flipping out from all the way over here.” John yelps when a handful of seawater gets dumped on his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock shrugs where he’s staring down at his iPad. “Lucky guess.”
“I don’t—”
He tells me how he was right, and how nobody really looked closer into it seein’ as how they all knew someone had simply had enough of hearin’ them rumors about him and taken the law into his own hands. How he convinced his parents with fake ashes, and then went and worked near every day for a whole year savin’ up every dollar that got passed him under the table while he searched around for the perfect little ranch to buy for us.
I don’t blame her. I don’t know what the hell to say either. I try to speak through the sharp pain in my chest. The one that makes me want to wring my own neck. Lay down in front of a speeding car and take Catherine’s place. Press poison into my arm in a darkened lighthouse so Sherlock Holmes wouldn’t ever have to.
Sherlock’s voice is hesitant as he stands rooted to the floor, “Greg . . .?”
“I’ll see you soon, Sherlock Holmes,” she whispers. They share a long look, and then he blinks once. She steps back and takes a deep breath, smoothing out her nurse’s uniform and shaking her shoulders once hard. Then she reaches up towards the clear bag for his IV and adds in a new medication with steady fingers. The one that will put him to sleep.
It’s strange how quickly Sherlock is starting to show. He’s so thin, his muscles always so flat and taught, that suddenly any extra weight at all is immediately noticeable. He’s even gotten a comment or two from Mrs. Hudson or Lestrade that it looks like he needs to cut back on the sweets. They give him a knowing wink and laugh it off and go back to their baking or their paperwork as if it was nothing. And for all they know, it is nothing. But it cuts into me like a knife when that happens.
The air is filled with sweat and wet grime. It smells like a secret hidden away inside my bones for years – one I haven’t taken out to look at until this moment. It also smells ugly and foreign in the dark, hair raising on the back of my neck and lungs clenching to try and squeeze out the air. Get it away.
“I care,” Sherlock says, in a tone of voice that makes Greg realize that Sherlock is definitely not just talking about a quick BBC television spotlight. That he’s talking about the last human voice John must have heard right before falling out of the sky.
Watson nods, then wraps his arms around his waist and holds on. Somehow, both of them look smaller, dwarfed by the body of the other.
Ah. Right. He was thinking about millions of people watching NBC coverage of Greg Lestrade slapping a warm hand across his young protégé’s shoulders.
John nods. “S’why I made sure I got back here by today.”
The water beneath them continues to ripple and roll in soft, slow curves. No waves in sight.
He tells himself now after each step as he walks down the shaded road to just turn back. That Scotty will just be embarrassed for him, that he came all this way just to say thank you to a man who hates him for doing something that anyone in their right mind would have done. He fiddles with the bullet casing in his pocket, unbuttons and re-buttons the button at the top of his quarter neck grey shirt. Before he can force himself to turn back he rounds a bend and freezes.
” Greg starts to sputter out when Sherlock suddenly huffs, grabs his arm, and pulls Greg unceremoniously into an unlocked door beside them. Greg stumbles along into an unused locker room, one he realizes with a quick glance has been adapted for the Paralympians for next week. The lights don’t automatically turn on as they enter, and Greg barely has time to turn around and start hissing a curse when Sherlock’s hands are on his shoulders, one of his curls tickling Greg’s brow.
Behind him, Dom tries to regain his own calm, staring down at the pit of snow with wide-open eyes. Elsa paws at the jagged snow and starts to cry.
John nearly laughs. “Jesus, look at you! You just . . . I thought your neck was fucking broken. Do you understand that? I thought you were . . . you were
But ah, right. There’s a body lying on top of him. A body with an erection and hot breaths and wet moans gasped into his ear. A body who wants to clutch Greg and kiss him and fuck, and the thought of it zips a fresh wave of heat straight down to Greg’s cock.
“Surf like hell, John Watson,” he whispers into his skin, and he kisses him softly just under his hairline. John sighs long and slow at his touch. Sherlock feels the tension seep out from John’s body in front of him, feels the hot lines of nerves running rigid through his muscles soften and relax.
Sherlock had immediately deleted it.
And after two months of work he made his way with sagging spine and lowered neck down to the shoreline next to the pier. He’d never gone down there before, always packed up and left right after the end of day whistle.
Greg swallows hard. He hates himself for not standing up and hugging John that morning, crowded athletes’ dining hall or no. Hates himself for not texting John every second of the day that he is loved, no matter how he does today, that they are proud—
terrified. It’s the . . . I mean, it’s the fucking Oly—Paralympics. I just can’t let that out right now when I’m busy dealing with—”
He sighs dramatically, then flashes an unexpectedly warm look at the interviewer beyond the camera.
“This was different.”
He tries to breathe. Tries to convince himself that John being stuck in eighth is actually a good place to be, when—
“Angry and disappointed,” John repeats, still hardly able to speak. Then suddenly he whips towards Greg, his stare burning Greg’s skin. “And you knew? You helped to keep this from me?”
I cupped his wet cheek with my hand and turned his face up towards me. I looked into his eyes, opened my mouth as if I was about to say something desperately touching and important, and then purposefully let out the gigantic beans on toast fart I had been holding in for hours. Sherlock groaned, and rolled his eyes, and called me a heap of garbage, and then promptly forgot all about the uninvited curve to his belly and instead stalked out of the bathroom in an indignant huff, ready to carry on with his current case. Sometimes I manage to make myself useful.
A single tear rolls down his cheek. He looks afraid, and I have no idea why.  “I’m sorry,” he whispers.
The air between them suddenly turns tense and fragile, and John’s blood thrums hard through his veins. They stand in a silent stalemate, both staring at the ground.
He wants to ask Sherlock to explain to him why he did it, because even he doesn’t understand. He doesn’t understand how he could be at the Olympics, what should presumably be the proudest day of his life, and yet he thinks he felt prouder the first time he successfully took off solo in a fighter jet, back when he was twenty. The first time he walked again in hospital, gripping the bars with the nurse rolling before him on a stool, holding his waist.
“You realize we’re also there for their wedding, too? Not just for surfing?”
John sighs, then walks forward and takes Sherlock’s cold fingers in his. “But, we just can’t. Not everyone’s Greg, or even Hank.”
Sherlock stares at me. “November,” he says back. He puts his hands on his hips and shakes his head. “What the hell ever happened to August?”
I feel anything but brave, but I decide on the truth. “Sherlock knows I signed the paper not to Stay,” I say quietly. “He wanted –” I swallow hard. “He wanted me to Stay with him.”
knows Sherlock Holmes. Yes,
” when Sherlock’s test actually came back clean two days later.
. . .
In a daze Sherlock walks down the beach in the opposite direction of the bar and his motel. The opposite direction of Johnny Watson. His fingers rub the smooth metal casing in his pocket until the sun starts peaking up over the distant horizon, sending puffs of slowly warming salty air across his skin. His body is exhausted, begging him for rest and water. He pats his other pocket to reach for cash for a cab and realizes he left his wallet back in his motel like an absolute moron. And when he finally drops down limp onto his motel bed almost three hours later, sweating and dehydrated and spent, he lies there and tries very hard to hate Johnny Watson with every fiber of his being. To hate him for staring straight into his eyes in the middle of a crowded pier, and for stubbornly insisting on introducing himself while they waited for the waves, and for emerging from the whitewater as the winner, and for making Sherlock’s throat tighten when he placed his warm, rough hand on his shoulder and pushed him away, and for being so damned unpredictable.
“Never known you to be one for excuses, Watson.”
He tosses what Sherlock belatedly realizes was his own shirt back onto the floor, then crawls back over John and Sherlock to his side, taking special care not to step on John, and taking extra special care to knee Sherlock in the hip.
John inhales a long breath in the darkness. Sherlock tracks the faded glow from the streetlamps as it cascades over John’s eyelashes, illuminating the line of his jaw. John’s fingers tremble where they still pin Sherlock to the mattress, his heart pumping so fast Sherlock can see the vein pulsing in John’s neck.
Watson, putting his hand on Holmes’ knee: “I was there with the military, as you know. And Sherlock was there with a climbing team as their route finder –”
And he’s falling and falling in a stream of fire and smoke until the earth swallows him whole, ripping bone from bone, setting his skin to flame.
John’s rubbing a hand over his eyes. “Christ, you’re the last person who should be disappointed. I know this has been hard for you—not skiing. I should have tried to . . .” He lifts his hands in a helpless gesture.
“I pushed the design on him. I paid for it. I convinced the Committee. I—”
When John sneaks a look, he glimpses long, black lashes tightly shut, a bead of water gathering in the corner of Greg’s eye, and then, with an emotion that feels like time freezing, he notices Greg’s left hand, hovering in the air above John’s metal knee.
John runs a hand up Sherlock’s wet chest, running his fingers through the soft hair and catching Sherlock’s nipples under his thumbs. He can barely think straight, he wants so desperately to grind himself deep and slow against Sherlock’s wet skin. “What?”
“Hello? You need any help up there?” John calls back. “I’m pretty sure you’re sinking under the weight of your gigantic fucking head.”
By the time they make it back to Sherlock’s home the sun is late and heavy in the sky. Sherlock can tell John’ shoulder is bothering him. The adrenaline of victory has worn off, leaving him sore and tired, and John’s holding himself carefully when he moves. He can’t quite understand the feeling that comes over him when he sees John’s entire body visibly relax the second they come within sight of the little hut.
John thinks he’s going to slip off his board and sink down into the murky, cold deep. The seconds feel like hours. Then, out of the thrumming fog in his mind, he hears Greg saying his name. Realizes he’s been saying it for a while.
John’s heart lurches. He rushes forward, not caring as he shoves people aside, stepping on toes, leaving angry chaos in his wake, annoyed curses in five different languages, until he finally gets a clear view of Greg standing at the very bottom of the course. He’s pushed into the corner by the press, leaning against the barricade alone and staring up at the wall of snow. John doesn’t even question himself. He’s moving faster than he has all morning, Greg’s back slowly coming into focus through the crowd.
I want to vomit. Somehow he knows.
John clenches his jaw. He should have gotten over himself and found Sherlock, or at least called him back. He should have reached out this morning, apologizing, reassuring. He should have shown up at his door last night.
believe in me. It’s like a script.”
And yet John still looks at him in the quieter moments of their life and can’t help but see the bright-eyed twenty-one year old kid, fresh off his stunning Silver medal win in Nagano, shyly turning to introduce himself to John on a tiny ski lift, as if eighteen-year-old John Watson didn’t already know exactly who the hell he was. Wasn’t already nervous and sweating at the thought that he was sharing a
Watson: “Fine. Sue me. File a workplace complaint with Gerold, who you’ve spent eight years calling ‘Greg’. See how seriously he treats it.”
,” John tells himself, actually whispering the words out loud under his breath as he curses at the tangled sock, nearly rips it in two, then childishly throws it to the ground. “
Greg pockets his wax and leans back in the sand on his elbows. “Anybody. When they tell you that you can really go pro with this, that you can make it up to the Championship Tour.”
“John would . . . he would have to PR by . . .”
Dominic quietly speaks up from Simon’s side. We can barely hear him over the howling wind.
I reach up to adjust the glasses sliding down my nose. Smooth down the front of my suit. “How do I look this time?” I ask.
John smirks again to himself sipping his coffee as he remembers the look on Greg’s face when he’d told him why he couldn’t meet up with him to surf in the morning.
“Gonna make me unfit for the camera,” John breathes. He rubs his erection perfectly along Greg’s own, building their rhythm, finding the right pulse.
Sherlock’s chest is heaving. He slips down farther on the wall, bringing himself face to face with John, and pulls John into himself by the small of his back, perfectly aligning their hips and feeling John’s half-hard penis press gently into the dip of his own thigh. It’s exquisite. John’s body is warm and solid is his arms, letting Sherlock feel the full weight of him pressing up against his frame as John’s tongue slides against his, hot and steady and slow.
Sherlock could punch himself in the face. He quickly interrupts, “As my coach has announced (
Sherlock turns his face to press a kiss into John’s palm and nods, and with an internal sigh John pulls himself away and starts to pull on board shorts and a t-shirt from the drawer Sherlock had cleared out for him in his dresser. He makes his way out into the kitchen, hearing Sherlock start to get up and rummage around for things back in the room. It sounds so right – hearing another person walking about, creaking on the floorboards, opening doors and moving clothes. John can’t quite believe he survived for so many years in a silent apartment, only ever hearing the sounds of his neighbors.
He pulls away gently, and I sway forward into his warmth. The sides of his long coat wrap around my body in the breeze, shielding me from the mist that clings to my bones and cloaking me in heat. He stares down into my eyes and cups my face and looks like he’s never been more surprised in his life. The moment hangs and tingles between us. Breaths held and eyes locked and noses just a hair away from touching.
“Holmes!”
He licked across my lips with a final soft sigh before he pulled back to breathe. I thought in that moment that there was nothing so precious on this whole wide earth as John Watson’s sleep heavy eyes blinking above mine. As his swollen pink lips, wet from my own mouth, glittering in the Christmas sun.
I barely whisper. “I can’t –”
asking or staring or urging him to sit.
Sherlock looks up from where he’d been staring down at his skis, slightly nods, then looks back down.
We stare at each other in the moonlit dark, and suddenly the air starts to crackle again, sighing and heaving against my skin like hundreds of fingertips. Making me want to step towards him.
John looking back at me over his shoulder from a horse. John in a tent at sunrise. John picking a leaf from my curls by the light of the campfire.
Interviewer, taking a deep breath: “There is some footage we have seen of you. Some footage which we all admit you may be upset that we have taken. And for that, we already apologize. We will start editing for the show immediately once we finish filming next week, and so we wanted to ask you . . . well, to explain to you what we have got. To ask for what you think.”
I watch, feelin’ small and helpless, trapped, as a tear falls down his cheek. He stops to wipe it away with his forearm, and his eyes shine, rimmed with red. “How am I supposed to protect her from it all, how can I try to be that in her life, when I’m just stuck for years being ‘granddaddy’s friend Scott’? Who the fuck am I to think that . . . And it is hell to me, hell on earth, that she gotta live in a world where . . .”
Suddenly Johnny’s tearing across the sand, half full beer left back on the patio. Sherlock stupidly thinks of laying down to hide like a child behind the rocks before he realizes it’s too late. He’s going to be seen. It’s inevitable. He smoothes out the front of his tank-top and grits his teeth. He’s Scotty fucking Holmes, not some star struck little kid, even if Johnny did catch him watching him through the palm trees earlier that afternoon. He feels his face settle into his familiar mask of cold indifference.
Qu’est-ce que t’as?   :   What's wrong with you / what's gotten into you?
John tracks the nurse’s faintly surprised gaze fluttering to the faded purple bruise sucked into his neck, and he finds himself foolishly proud in front of this freshly graduated young man that yes, John Watson can still pull, even at his age and in this state, thank you very much. He has a fleeting, humorous curiosity as to what this man’s reaction would be if he ever found out that John got himself off the night before to thoughts of two other men giving nearly the exact same brush to his nipples, but with their teeth.
Kip cuts him off. “But man he’s a miserable asshole, Johnny. Thinks he’s Jesus Christ or something looking down on all of us poor losers. And keep fucking far away from him out there unless you want him checking out your ass as you paddle out, sick fucker.”
Watson, starting to clip off his mic: “We’re all a team here. None of this would work if we weren’t a close team.” He grins, but it doesn’t fully reach his eyes: “But, you know, I do love working with Greg. He’s the most competent pilot we have – he’s even surpassed Gerold, who trained him. We all agree. I trust him with my life.”
John fits his head underneath Sherlock’s chin and hugs him hard enough to bruise, fingers gripping hard into his back, imprinting themselves on Sherlock’s bones.
That it isn’t because I left him all alone.
As if we aren’t already sick enough.
Turns out the second little one was hiding behind her sister all this time during the previous ultrasound, and now we have two of them. Two little girls.
“Holmes, you ducking out?”
Afterwards he holds me. Or actually, I hold him.
And so, in the blink of an eye, five men are shoveling at the base of the deep pit, utterly silent except for the heaving breaths and the crunch of the metal through the snow. From the edges, Sam watches them closely, carefully monitoring the fragile surface of the ice – the carabiners and ropes.
“You want this,” he breathes, voice shaking.
They fly through the empty Village, whipping around dark, abandoned corners and courtyards flooded with eerie yellow light. Sherlock looks back once at the guards and catches one of them slip and fall right on their face. The others stop to help him up for a brief moment, and Sherlock immediately sees his chance, and takes it.
I love him fiercely, I do. I just hope he was right, that we can do this.
They all wait in silence. It isn’t until the doctor clears his throat again, looking between Greg and John, that Greg realizes he’s waiting for them to leave for patient privacy. But just as he tries to catch John’s eye, Sherlock sighs.
John’s not sure what the hell just happened. A slow fear starts to build at the base of his spine – that he said something wrong, or that what had come out of his mouth when Sherlock’s hand was on him had taken the fantasy too far, too fast. Sherlock sits beside him godlike and untouchable, pink light dripping down across his bare and glistening skin as his chest rises and falls with his even breathing. John clenches his fist not to reach out and touch him, wanting to bridge the sudden distance that had expanded between them in the seconds between John’s orgasm and Sherlock sliding off his board.
He half-winks, but it falls flat. His knee bounces on the cement floor.
Sherlock is alone in the ocean. Alone in the world. He grips the sides of his board with shaking fingers right at the crest. He feels his heart beat like a drum in his chest, echoing out across the silent, muffled sound of the entire rest of the earth. He sucks in a wet, salty breath, thinks of the color of John Watson’s eyes in the earliest morning light, and then leaps up to standing, ready to fly.
The man John hasn’t seen since a silent visit in an Afghanistan hospital.
“And so at this point,” Rick interrupts, either oblivious to John’s change in mood or quite good at pretending not to see it. “Will you settle for the Bronze? Would that still be a cause for celebration?”
The stadium seems to fall silent except for the Russian cheering section towards the back. The earth rushes away, muffled as Greg waits, absolutely frozen, for the screen to confirm the final results.
For a horrifying moment, Greg’s heart sinks down into the snow. He can’t draw in any breath, and he can’t see, and everything around him is hopeless and empty and bleak . . .
“Listen to me,” he says steadily. “Listen to me.”
Sherlock whips around his third gate, a perfect, beautiful turn. His skis move like white bones extending from his own graceful body, reaching out for the fourth gate like elegant fingertips, gently pushing aside the snow like a hot blade through soft ice. John steals a quick glance at the screen off to the side, and his mouth drops open at the extreme close-up view.
He’d taken his sweet time coming down from his race. First, there’d been celebrating with the other ex-military guys in their own corner, mostly razzing each other, taking the piss, until John had realized halfway through cleaning off his racing prosthetic that he didn’t know ninety-percent of what the hell pop culture stuff the rest of the guys were even talking about, and he’d slipped into the shower to avoid feeling like a crusty, out of touch hermit.
John nods, understanding. “I did,” he agrees.
“Holmes!”
Greg’s voice: “They had done a lot of work by the time we got there. So much work. I could not believe how much they had already dug.”
John smirks back, wincing at another curse from upstairs, then looks suddenly lost in thought.
Sherlock drowns in it. Drowns in John inside him, and in front of him, and on top of him. John on his tongue, and down his throat, stretching his lips wide, dripping into his mouth.
He’s silent for a moment. “I wouldn’t know.”
He motions his head to his bike, and we slowly follow, scraping up from our chairs.
There is a moment of silence as Holmes and Watson look at each other. We feel like we’re intruding. The interviewer shifts in her seat.
He shoots.
“Sorry for him,” Greg says, immediately wincing at the harsh grate of his accent against everyone else’s crisp, polished English. “It is just the nervous energy for the games. Thank you for having us. And yes, it is good to be back.”
But his eyes. His eyes are exactly the same. Looking up at me with silent terror. He’s afraid.
he can never really name, but now the lights are so bright, and they’re going to be asking him on international television how he met Sherlock Holmes, how it feels to coach him, and Greg can’t well open his mouth and say that coaching him reminds him of why he first fell in love with the snow, before he ever won his first medal when he was seven. Back when it was just freedom and flying and
Greg waits so long John finally looks up at him. Greg’s lips are chapped from the cold; a lock of silver hair falls into his eyes. “That is not what I was meaning.” It sounds like a scold. “Are you alright?”
“He does not look that nervous now, actually,” Greg adds, noting the way John’s shoulders look relaxed, and his gaze appears to be almost serenely fixed on the course, not glancing at his competitors or the screen or the crowd.
. While I know Los Angeles like the back of my hand, I've never set foot in Hawaii. She was amazing and shared gorgeous Hawaii vacation photos with me, in addition to giving great island descriptions. Couldn't have done it without her!
them, right from the very first second of their lives.
“It very well can be,” Sherlock says, reaching into his pocket.
I came home and didn’t even go inside the old house I’d spent every day of my life in before that drive with Harry to the bus stop – just took one last look around the empty farm, grabbed those keys and hopped in the Ford and drove and drove, until I ran out of gas near Garland and had to walk eight miles to a gas station. My army boots sounded strange crunching through the Wyoming grass and rocks after years of trudging through the hot, wet, stained red jungle mud.
), I am unavailable for any interviews, specifically regarding my personal life, as my Finals are in 3 days.”
“How do you know what she would want?” I yell up at him. I rise to my feet in a rush, new anger flashing in my gut. It feels wonderful to be riled up and angry with energy. Nothing like a dying man on his knees in the sand. Nothing like an ex-soldier crying and weak.
John groans as he passes a hand over his mouth. “God, can’t you just bloody tone it down for one day? Are you physically incapable of stopping trying to be so . . . so . . . for five minutes?”
The sun is heavy and bright in the sky when Sherlock blinks hard and looks up from his work. He’s switched back and forth between the record player and recording his notes on the waves from the night before in his notebook, working until the passing hours feel like seconds as his mind buzzes steadily ahead, refusing to do anything but think. His stomach growls roughly, and his eyes start to droop closed against the harsh blare of the sunlight reflecting off the white sand. He suddenly realizes he hasn’t eaten or slept in well over twenty-four hours, and shakes his head angrily at himself. So much for taking back control of his life – he can’t even keep his new resolve for four hours without letting himself get to a state that will come back to bite him in the ass tomorrow morning at the competition when he’s tired and weak.

money and airtime? And you think I want that solely because I’m indebted to you, because a camera happened to see us kiss, and not on my own fucking merit? You think all I can think about, days before your fucking Final, is whether I get anymore cash?”
John’s eyes flutter open. Ridiculously, he hears himself respond, “You’ve never called me that before. Brave.”
But Greg can barely wait himself. Because he
“Hold on,” he says belatedly.
. After Sherlock had nearly levitated up into the sky and yelled back, “
Interviewer: “You’ve mentioned the importance of teamwork before in this job. Of trusting your team. Does working with Holmes ever detract from that?”
I breathe in the scent at the warm crook of his neck. “Me too,” I whisper, and it’s the truest words I’ve ever uttered on this earth.
, you speak English every day of your life, you and John would just stare at each other blankly in between making out for hours if you couldn’t speak English, you’ve already done two interviews since we arrived here in English, you’re listening to my English right now, why in the world would you—”
“Greg told me the other night that the sunglasses are kind of your thing,” he says. “Never seen without ‘em.”
Sherlock looks at him over his shoulder and winks as if he isn’t doing anything extraordinary at all. “You coming, Captain?” he smirks. Then he flings his board down and leaps onto it in a dive underneath the water, sending up a small plume of foaming spray into the glittering air.
“Just breathtaking!”
The cameraman holds up one finger. The awkwardness seeps through the air, wrapping around John’s skin.
to them both all those winter nights ago. That he didn’t turn away in disgust when Sherlock hesitantly placed his palm on John’s shoulder, and Greg held John’s fingers to his lips and said, “
John, I think I will be telling you a lot over the next weeks how grateful I am to have you here,” he says, shaking his head at Sherlock leaping over another athlete who just slipped on the ice without offering to help him up. “Perhaps you will get sick of me repeating myself.”
He licks his full lips, and I can’t tear my eyes from his face. “What you did,” he says low. “Last week, what you did in the alley . . .”
We cannot tell who it is, but an odd look of regret passes across Holmes’ face, replaced by his usual indifference in the span of a blink. He turns back to sit straight in his seat.
Then Sherlock’s warm, wet tongue slides roughly inside, shooting straight past the rim and igniting the heat in John’s groin, and Sherlock groans loudly against his skin. He pulls back, words whispered like ice against the wetness surrounding John’s hole.
It’s almost pleasant enough—
” And then Greg had stared down at the snow, at the exact spot where Sherlock’s head had smacked the ice. And before Sherlock could decide how to respond, he’d said, “
“Holmes, just because you do not like the silence does not mean that you can decide when—”
Because the sight of me there, strong and young and free – I want to throw myself to the mirror and protect the man standing before me. I want to drop to my knees and beg him. Don’t follow the Draft and go. Don’t pick up that gun in your hands. Don’t tell Catherine that you’ll take her to the park another day. Don’t stay at your desk instead of holding her hand across the street. Because if you stay working at your desk and leave her to cross the street alone, that’s the last time you’ll ever see her with her eyes open.
. And now you’re sitting here asking me if I’m mad that that wasn’t the case? Fuck you. Let me be worried. Let
The man starts speaking. My name and Sherlock’s name and commitment and sickness and health and will you cherish and as long as you both shall live.
Suddenly this is our life now. Doctor’s appointments and gynecology textbooks and odd glances from Lestrade and his team when Sherlock’s shirts all look just a skosh too tight, and then again when he finally switches to wearing some of my jumpers. He claimed it was an experiment, and thankfully he’s done enough weird things that they all believed him, gave me a shrug and a pat on the shoulder (“good on you for putting up with him, mate”) and moved on.
Eleven o’clock comes and goes with a murmur of restlessness from the crowd. John doesn’t even sigh. He’s never seen a competition start on time in his entire life. No reason to think things should start working properly now, even at the Olympics.
“What a career!” Rick exclaims, his voice shattering through the studio with a jolt.
“I thought you didn’t blame me!” Sherlock practically demands, like he’s picking at a bleeding scab. “You said you forgave me. Not in so many words. But clear enough. And we’ve all established that it wasn’t such a grotesque thing to do.”
He presses another kiss to my forehead, long and soft. It shivers across my skin like warm water dripping from the top of my skull, coating down the length of my body towards the sand. “I was hiding from you,” he says quietly.
That time had ended in him snorting something vile into his nose just an hour later in the loo of a seedy Russian bar. A bar that was proudly displaying Super-Greg’s fifth Gold Medal Ceremony on the grimy televisions when Sherlock came out, still wiping his upper lip with a shaking hand, wondering what the fuck he was going to do now.
She beams and adjusts her NBC-logo beanie over what looks to be long, elegantly curled black hair.
When there is no response, Watson shakes his head and curses under his breath.
Sherlock turns towards him as he takes a sip of coffee, frowning down at John’s attempt to cover himself. “John, don’t be ridiculous. You know there’s nobody around here to see.”
But instead, John just looks back down again and rubs wearily at his eyes. His shoulders sink, and Greg shoves his hands under his own arms so he won’t go over and rub at John’s back, holding him up from behind.
,” Greg says, with just enough force of command that Sherlock’s body goes weak, a pulse of heat jolting up his legs and curling in his stomach.
He’s efficient. “No, and sort of.”
La Marseillaise is the French national anthem. Apologies for Sherlock's critique regarding the lyrics, but you have to admit. There's a lot of blood in that anthem.
Greg barely processes what’s happening as he and Sherlock stride out the studio door, gear bags back in hand and waving final goodbyes to the NBC crew. All he knows is that they need to get to the course. Practice and practice and practice until the sun goes down, and even then some, and he needs to convince Sherlock not to take the absolutely
Everything is forgotten. Everything but his legs and the water and the board. John surfs like a machine, barrel after barrel, ride after ride, chase after chase. He’s the only person out there in the water. The only person on the entire beach. The only person underneath the sun. The towering waves push and shove against the bottom of his board, straining at the muscles in his legs and ripping at his core. They blast salty spray into his face and crush him in their whitewater – propel him faster than he’s ever moved on a board in his life and shove him back towards the shore again, and again, and again. He doesn’t stop. The only sounds in the world are the hurling crash of the great walls of water around him and the echo of his breathing in the long tubes of the barrels. He gouges into the face, rips cutbacks across the crests, soars up into the air and crouches down low against his board.
The words don’t even compute in John’s mind.
John and Greg were already showered and in bed two hours ago, digging in to delivered platters of sushi with a revolting amount of groans and mmm’s and curses in both languages. Sherlock had shoved four pieces in his mouth to avoid an argument, then realized he was famished and eaten approximately seventeen more, then tried not to bounce off the walls with leftover restless energy until Greg had silently handed him the hotel keycard to get into the private gym, where Sherlock had spent a grateful hour of delicious silence on the stationary bike, until he was so exhausted he nearly fell asleep right there on the floor.
“This is the second time someone’s saved my life, and the first time I never said thank you. So I couldn’t . . . I can’t move on from this without thanking you, too.”
-MAJOR thanks go out to
A news helicopter suddenly cuts through the steel grey, soaring overhead in a graceful arc with a whirring hum, and John cranes his neck from the freezing shade to track it through the sky.
“As if you understand anything at all about what happens in America. Let alone some niche trophy.”
Another thick moment passes, both of them holding their breath. John wants to believe he can read the emotions passing through Greg’s dark eyes—disbelief, embarrassment, and a quick reddening of shame, as if he’d been caught out wanting something inappropriate. Then it finally settles on what John has been fiercely trying to convey to him with his gaze for long seconds: belief.
