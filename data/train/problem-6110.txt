, what’re you gonna do, steal my kidney and . . . sell it?  Could you please not do anything awful for . . . five seconds?  What’d she just do to me?”
Steve gazed over the scene.  Tony, his hair a mess, wearing a grease-stained sweat shirt and flannel pajama pants, looking somewhere between exhausted and just waking.  He was curled into the side of the couch, one foot trapped in the crevice between cushion and arm, while the other was carelessly dangling over, toes flexing occasionally.  His hands were twitching as well, resting on the throw pillow in his lap, hands freshly scrubbed with GoJo and smelling of pumice and orange, but the lines of his hand were still embedded with grease.  The worry lines of his face relaxed, looking more like a teenager who had stayed up all night finishing a science project than a teenager who regularly challenged what engineering could accomplish.
A particularly large clang issued from the transponder outside of the office, followed by a series of swears.  “You don’t see Rhodey fussing over me, do you?”
Sam’s mouth was a hard line, and Tony knew it was going to be difficult for all of them to forget it.  They’d all seen the destruction fire could cause, dedicated their lives to stopping it.  It wouldn’t be easy to sit back and let a known arsonist gallivant around.
Tony double parked, and leapt over the unopened door. His Italian loafers seemed to squeak with joy to be back on grease-stained concrete. “I got a little caught up! But, hey, I’m here now!”
“Hey!  We are proud of our son!” Sam shouted from where he was tending three grills with Thor, who where both wearing frilly aprons and chef hats printed with the flag.  “Let the mother of the bride have her moment.”
The weight of the bronze token in his hand is the only metal that can help him now.
“I suppose that’s what it’s called now.”  Cap looked more at peace than Tony had seen before, but the man still looked troubled.  Probably the whole “Man Out of Time” thing.
Around his brow was a diadem, with a Herakles knot done in sapphire and sliver with seed pearls criss-crossing on metal wires.  Freshly cut olive branches had been used to form a victory wreath.  He pulled at it when he thought no one was watching, obviously not used to the marks of affluence or victory.
“That’s not up to you.”
Steve looks up, and bare eyes meet his, violet pouches beneath and well-kept brows above and wiry lashes around.
“That’s not what people usually remember, but yes,” Tony agreed, pleased.  “Antinous, Prince of Athens.  What do you do?”  He gestured at the shrouded workspace.
Panting, Tony plopped down.  Steve, still chucking to cover up the hot custard feeling that was once again filling the air.  They let Tony regain his breath throughout “Fire In the Hole”, but when a slower, smoother sound filled with maracas and snare drum started up, Tony once again leapt up, this time holding out a hand.
Sweat dripping down his face, making his skin glow gold, forcing him to close his eyes to avoid the salty burn from stinging.
There follows a heavy sigh, and Steve ducking back inside for a moment to grab a blanket. He drapes it awkwardly around Tony, then carefully, ever so carefully, gathers Tony up in his arms. The only reaction Tony gives is to pull his limbs in close to ease the process, but otherwise allows Steve to manhandle him.
Snow was in his eyes.  “That’s a little bit tougher to explain.”
for this child of Hephaestus and I’m not changing my mind.  But, they should be with us very soon, and you can ask them for time privileges.  In the meantime, take some time to get to know the place.  I think the waterworks project is more pressing, and you volunteered.  They’ll keep you busy, trust me.  Fair?”
It was very obviously some genetic experiment gone wrong, but none of it was Steve’s main concern at the moment.
And then they’ve said everything.  Well, not everything, but as much as they can come up with at this time.
Tony lowers his head and perks up his antennae and frill for Steve to explore. Steve’s fingers are cautious and the look on his face is awed as he traces the lines of Tony’s snout, taps his scales, runs his fingers along the line of the antennae.  It’s intense and focused, and Tony is terrified, but he’s also terrified not to have Steve’s hands on him.
It was dusk before they arrived at the site of the wedding.  It was set up in the middle of the Very Large Array, a couple hundred folding chairs draped in blue, red, and gold in amidst the enormous satellite dishes.  Women were stumbling over the rocky ground and tufts of grass in their colored heels; Clint and Sam were hobbling to try and mimic them.  Nat just rolled her eyes.
The next step was to find the mysterious village where the Drakovich children came from. Which doesn’t seem to exist.  People told him that it would be impossible to make a settlement there, and the mountains are full of dangers.  The cold being the worst.  Even in summer, when the lower parts thaw, the terrain is rugged and filled with natural barriers that make it nigh impossible to get where Tony desires to go.
“Does your boss not think you’re capable enough handle routine shit on your own?” Tony shot back.  Rhodey and Nat made noises of agreement.
“Just curious. Because if you prefer your other name I can start – “
“I’m here.”
Tony sat up.  “There was a time when he was
“That would be
when I’m with you, and I don’t really remember what it’s like to be content routinely since before we became the Avengers.  The others help, but it’s
“Steve said to tell you he was sorry, but they got called out,” Jane apologized profusely.
“Twelve percent.”  Oh, shit.
The host cleared his throat.  “Anything lasting?”
“Steve,” Sam muttered as Redwing licked fig juice off his fingers, “we’ve all been being rude then.”
Fuming, Tony shoved the damn thing in the pocket of the baggy, grease-stained Levis he’s put on as part of his disguise and rubbed and hand through his slightly overgrown beard.  “I would know, I designed the damn thing.”
He buried he face in Steve’s shoulder, and felt a hand card through his hair.
There’s something sinister here, the dragon humming at the base of his skull whispers. Something bad.
“My God, I hope you’re right,” he said aloud to the empty room.
“Love you, too,” Steve answered, sounding like he had just raced the 800 meter against Usian Bolt.
“Wine?” Natasha asked him, holding out a kylix.  Tony accepted it gratefully, noting the illustration of Herakles and Kerberus on the sides.  He took a sip.  It was good, for a rough country wine.  Sweet and slightly smoky.  He followed the example of the others taking platters to the couches and stopped when he saw the wall.
“Dr. Banner, put down the scepter.”
“Expensive,” Steve gulped.
“What for?”
The air tastes of ozone. Thor is off doing . . . whatever he is doing, but thunderstorms can happen without him. The air is thick, cloying, the vague smoke-spice-rot scent of the city rising on the waves of heat. It is hot and muggy, and clouds are circling low, obscuring the antennas that top the skyscrapers. Dark, heavy clouds, grey and reflecting the orange of the city, rumbling and flickering in their depths.
, then would lay him out and
Steve wondered if his future son-in-law would be a Stark.
“Oh?” Steve teased, grabbing the lube once again.  “Why don’t we change that?”
, he still loves his suits and he will continue to sort his M&M's by color before he eats them.  He will still drink too much coffee and still loves Steve.
So intent was Tony on kissing Steve he barely noticed being stripped, and Steve stripping himself.  Before he knew it, Tony was lying on his back, cock rubbing up the cleft of Steve’s ass.
They kept his spirits up.  They politely bad-mouthed Colonel Philips, and not-so-politely bad-mouthed his fellow recruits.  When he was kneeled over, panting for breath, Peter would say
It wasn’t a shock to his system, really, he thought as he watched Clint jump up and try and give Thor the Heimlich Maneuver.  He loved Tony.  The thought and feeling was light as air, easy as breathing without asthma, natural.
Or cupping his face and listening to his breathing to convince himself that Steve was still alive.
going to hell.
He piped up.
“And my problems would still be here,” Tony groaned, rolling onto his back and throwing his left arm over his eyes.
“Ohhhh-kay,” Tony said in a shaky voice.  “You need to teach a class on that.”
“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean, Pep. And there is no secret staircase that I’ve ever come across.”
Tony helps Steve with his breathing apparatus, strapping it to his back and untangling the tubes and mask as they straighten the straps. Steve ends up with the mask tucked beneath his chin, staring at Tony intently, like he’s searching a battle map for clues to victory.  “Honestly Tony, I think I’ll be fine without it.”
“Oh.  Was he out late yesterday or something?”
“Have you seen a sad duckling?  ‘Cause I have, and the first thing I thought was ‘Oh my God, this pathetic thing, look at it, all it needs is affection – ‘”
Steve didn’t moan.  His breathing was harsh and ragged, controlled and stifled, only letting out the occasional tiny whimper that had Tony wanting to make Steve make those noises.  He didn’t know if Steve was naturally just that quiet or he was keeping it down because of the assumption that Tony was asleep and Steve didn’t want him awakened.
When the door pinged for his floor, Steve speed-limped to his bedroom.  He was in no mood to fool around, so the really ripped his shirt off in his haste to get it off, and kicked his sweatpants gracelessly to the edge of the bed.  He usually made sure to get stuff into the hamper (something years of living surrounded closely by others had ingrained in him), but as he yanked his boxer-briefs around his straining cock, he laughed deliriously at the notion that no one could walk in on him.
Tony says nothing.  Not because he has nothing to say, but because he has too much.  And maybe, for once, Steve should be the one talking.
He turned to go pack up what he could of his forge.
“Actually – yes.  What-“
“I don’t know about them, but I’m relaxed,” Bruce’s blissed-out voice from his massage table.
Korkyra was beautiful.
Rhodey glowered.  “Pikas never wakes up long enough to challenge travelers.  Shit, are we going to have to start warning travelers going in that direction to go around the river source?”  Tony just shrugged, and Rhodey, half grumbling and half grinning, pulled Tony inside.
“You all came in from Iceland?  That’s impressive,” Steve cut in.
“You were given an amazing mind for a reason, Tony. You can change the world. If you can, that’s what you should be doing.”
“Yes you should say something, or yes you will marry me?”
“JARVIS, anytime now,” he grumbled as Loki grabbed him again, pulling him up.
He still wants a drink.
real.  I’m the realest person you’re ever going to meet.”
Steve jumped like he had been caught. “Um, no,” he muttered distractedly. “Things have just – I hadn’t realized how much had changed.”
“The power surrounding the cube is impenetrable.”
Smoke begins curling from the beam above them. Tony spots plastic explosives and detonators strapped to the wood.
assume I won’t have kids?  What is it about me that make people think I won’t be able to?”
Fury chucked a set of blood-splattered trading cards at him.
“Sure.” He rubs at his throat.  “Not that I don’t love you two, but is there any reason you’re here?  I have important . . . things to do.”  He waves a hand in the direction of the pile.
He did, when he wasn’t lusting after his friend.  Teenager.  Son of a friend.  Injured.
By seventeen, Tony had tenuously established himself as the head of SI, with the handpicked Pepper Potts operating what he was not legally allowed to until he turned twenty-one.  He had successfully been operating the armor for a year before the Invasion.
“Frequently.  Daily, when other things aren’t pressing.”
,” Steve gasped as Tony worked him thoroughly in his mouth.  Sucking, tasting, testing the limits that only Tony Stark could.
“On the lease.”
He got up to explore the rest of the house.
like it's truth is really faulty reasoning.  He's a logical adult.  Maybe his past with surreal shit allows him to just accept the dragons' existence.  He has met dragon-y things before, and much stranger things besides.  But this is like a Skrull telling he's been a Skrull the entire time.
“Whoa, whoa whoa. What, nah, he
“You owe me at least part of an explanation,” Steve told him as he wedged the key into the crack under the door and walked away without waiting for Tony to answer.

but Tony didn’t say that.  “Now,” he croaked, and let his sword drop and impale into the dust, “are you gonna let me have some water?  ‘Cause I haven’t had a drink since Corinth, and I could really use –“
“Oh?” Tony asked.  “Pater and Maria are gonna be three when you bring Padma home.”
“Okay, good lesson one.  But the forge . . . ?”  He trailed off hopefully.
“I say this as a friend: you need to get laid,” Sam quipped.
“It’s not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.”
He didn’t have much, just an overnight bag stuffed with some jeans and shirts and a few toiletries (and lube, plenty of lube).  Steve’s birthday present, which Tony had thankfully designed and had made after his own birthday but had never picked up, was nestled at the bottom of the bag.

Tony dozed a bit while he waited for the battery to charge itself enough to keep him good for a few hours. Once he deemed the power at an acceptable level, he retrieved the key and used the room phone to call the hotel he and Happy were staying at. It took a while for the switchboard operators to push him through, but eventually he was able to speak with an irate Happy, to whom he gave the address of the hotel he was currently in and asked for some new clothes.
There is the sound of a large inhale and exhale, then a fog of white curls almost lethargically through the air.
A shriek of laughter from his six jars him out of it.
Happy just called it “mooning”. Tony really couldn’t argue with him.
Tony leans back, and decides he should give Steve a chance.  To explain himself.  “Maybe you should make me understand your position.”

It was only whispers, thankfully; no one had gone to the gossip columns,
“For what?”  Tony cackles slightly as he plops down across from him.  “Freezing him just prolongs it.  When he wakes up?  Everything will still be the same in his head.  It takes

but it doesn’t seem right.
Steve doesn’t even hesitate.
“Tony,” Steve said one night as he examined the dark blue-grey Natasha and Bucky had insisted on earlier (laughing uproariously at the name,
“What do remember about your dad, hm?”
He has no feelings.  He can’t feel pain.  There’s nothing screaming in agony in his head, there’s no drowning emptiness and isolation.
He was going to try his damnest to make sure he was the only one ever privy to this image.
Clint was still staring at water, clutching the diving board like it was a life preserver.  “I got us some of those handcuffs they usted to use on the criminally insane.”
He wasn’t crying, really.  “Peter and Maria,” Tony agreed.
Steve shrugged.  “All three of them, out on the beach.  I didn’t stop to chat, but they heckled me as I passed.”
Jeremy had come out of his carefully-positioned slump, eyes shining.  “No
The recording ends.
But while the island looked vaguely wild and lonely, it wasn’t vacant.  Shepherds with sheep and goats waved as the ship slid past, as did the farmer inspecting a small field of barley.  A solitary doe appraised them for a moment before slipping into the hills.
Tony is paging through the images that he has examined a thousand times, and wonders just how deplorable humans can be.
“Headed out to complete the Great American Road Trip?” Tony asked, shaking Cap’s hand.
He couldn’t keep himself from laughing at Peter’s words.
That made Steve pause.  It was rare when a person had a child and didn’t hear a voice.  Usually the parent was so bitter that they had not heard, they either put the kid in an orphanage or neglected the kid.  By not hearing a voice, they insured they never knew their children.  Their children often went on to not hear voices.  It was a vicious cycle.
Tony slumped against the seat. “I just can tell, Happy. He doesn’t have anywhere to go, and I just couldn’t let him get away. I can’t explain it, but I know I need him next to me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart.”  He tapped the arc reactor.  “This stops it.  This little circle of light.  It's part of me now, not just armor.  It's a terrible privilege.”
Worth everything.
of the dark, but knowing that if he opens his eyes he’ll be able to see helps him get his fitful sleep.
Happy had offered to drive them up to the front door, but Steve had asked to be let out at the foot of the long approach.  Tony was regretting the decision to follow him, and they weren’t even halfway up the steep hill that lead to the terminal.
Jarvis had been driving the car when Howard, Maria, and he had been killed.  Something about the report was sketchy, as Steve had been denied the request to read it.  But if he pushed, all vital information would probably be blacked out anyway.
It was a picture text, showing a chubby towhead baby of maybe three months.  In the corner of the frame, Steve’s teeth glinted in a wide smile.
,” Natasha ordered as Clint and Tony growled at each other.
“I’m getting my crap.  A ship’s waiting.”
“Happy –“
Steve smiled pityingly.  “Really Tony, it’s fine.  I’ve heard of your metalwork, but you aren’t here to apprentice a master smith.  You will have plenty of other things to keep you occupied.  Anyway, metalwork isn’t exactly a common pursuit for the son of a king, is it?”
Tony ‘hmmm’ed noncommittally, still thinking.
It became a thing after that.  Occasionally, Bucky would go out to the Duane Reade and come home with several tiny bottles of lacquer and ask Natasha to do his nails.  It went on until Tony threatened to take away his StarkCard if he kept bringing home the shitty drugstore brands, and to get some professional grade next time.
“Sorry for breaking this up, but Zemo’s making his move. Tony, we need to be gone
As the golden armor passed the state troopers, they set their sirens on for about five seconds before shutting them off and waving the man away with laughter. They paused on the shoulder, watching Iron Man slip away into the sunrise, probably remarking on how good Iron Man was, how important he was, how glad they were that he was on their side.
“And the more people cling to an idea, the more extreme it gets.  The more it is challenged, the lengths people will go to defend it will get longer.  The less amenable they become to compromise.  The less willing they are to explaining things.  Yes, I am talking about myself here.  A bit.”
“That’s not true.”
“It will keep you from flying.”
And she sounded genuinely touched.
“Just find the cube,” Rogers mumbled as he stalked out.
He had known. He had known this morning, as everyone engaged in the usual breakfast banter. They’d been anticipating this showdown for weeks, so the atmosphere has been slightly more subdued than usual, but nothing out of place. Thor chomping on his usual smelly canned Scandinavian fish and eight hard-boiled eggs, and Clint acting all offended over everyone eating his “babies”. It was a really shitty old joke that never failed to garner a laugh. Tony happily chatting away with everyone, and begging Steve to make waffles like every morning. Steve hadn’t wanted to be bothered, so Tony’d had sugar cereal.
It was just getting dark when they heard the phone ring.  Sam jogged inside to answer it.  When he came back out, all of the present firefighters were very still.
I re-wrote my summary to be a Homeric Hoe.  But FUCK hexameter.
The firefighter subculture attracted some strange characters.
with this mess you helped create instead of fighting me at every turn.”
Ah, Steve.  So obtuse until it's too late ;)
Tony lets scalding cheese scorch his throat in his haste to answer. “For the time being, which is what the answer always is.  I took a break, went to figure some stuff out.  I’m back now.”
The man had stood out amidst the congregated people like Apollo, all golden hair and smooth face.  An almost ephemeral halo of light had clung around him, setting him apart from the drab assorted dignitaries; they glittered with gems and gold but were still gritty.  He stood somehow pure but unfiltered.  It was an odd contrast, like the raw, uncultured man was better than the pasteurized polite society.
“I win,” she grinned, “pay up, you three.”
“Steve?” Tony asked gently, gingerly placing a hand over this chest, with the flat of his palm pressed flat against Steve’s collarbone, a touch that was grounding but non-threatening.  Steve’s hand shot up, gripping Tony’s wrist tightly.  His breathing evened an increment.
A pair of bay leaves hit the broth, and Steve’s face was glowing red.  “Stop it.  Stop trying to make it happen.”
Tony was trembling, he was so angry.  “I get it.  Don’t try and explain-“
Tony had been sent to boarding school at the age of seven, and had been home for the summer after he turned fifteen, planning on heading to MIT in the fall, when a drunken Howard had rammed the car he and Maria had been driving back from a gala of some sort into a tree.  At fifteen, Tony had been orphaned and became head of a company he had never been trained to handle.
Dragons. Dragons hold the answers he has come for.  What are they, some sort of mythical paternity testing facility?  But it is more than that.  He can tell.  The real son of Howard and Maria Stark was created with alien intervention.  Why can’t dragons tell Tony where he came from?

Steve huffed.  “Look, I know you’re gonna be bored.  I have the ability to at least make you
“You always tell people to take me seriously, that I’m smart enough to make my own decisions.  Why is the only thing you won’t let me figure out for my self is who I love?  ‘Cause it’s you, Steve.”
“Actually,” Steve starts shyly, “I want to learn how to throw clay.  I’ll need, well, clay, a pottery wheel, glazes, a kiln.”
“Well, I think that was meant for you.  Even if Barton didn't post that, it was all over the news.”
As different as they are, they’ve always been similar in other ways. That is why they’ve always worked.  They fit together well enough, but contrast enough to allow friction that keeps them in check.  No one can argue with Steve the way Tony can.
Tony decided another peek would suffice, and nearly choked on his tongue.  He kept his eyes open.  Steve sure as hell wouldn’t notice.
“Boss!” Immediately, everyone’s eyes were on him. “This traitor Shapanka was tryin’ to break into one of the vaults.”
He stripped Tony down to his underwear with shaking hands and propped him in the chemical shower for a few moments while he spoke to a frantic Pepper, who was stuck in traffic.  He only told her that Tony had locked himself in his lab and had gotten drunk.
in charge of keeping everyone on track.
Quite suddenly, she gasped dramatically, and dug her nail sharply into his biceps. “Oh, darling, but did you have to pick car number thirteen?”
“Well, you came back to help us with the Zemo thing, and it does involve your, uh, family.”
be right.  But he can't stop himself.  The current favorite in his mind is an Italian man, on business or vacation, met a young Russian woman and left her pregnant, and she was forced to leave him in Sverdlovsk by her family.  Along the way, throughout this mad journey, Tony has focused on his mother.  It takes to much to be a mother, and so little to be a father.  He doesn't need to find the source of an ejaculation; he needs to find the woman who carried him, who bore him, who wrapped him tenderly in blankets and put him up for adoption in the desperate hope he would have a better life.  He can't be certain, of course.  But sometimes, he
Tony stared.
There was a pause.
He jumped from the Humvee, zigzagging through the desert sand.
Everyone save Fury groaned in response.
“Hi.  They need you on the bridge; they’re starting the face trace.”
“And you didn’t have to bring me pizza, yet here we are,” Tony plopped back down and raised his glass. Steve just laughed and raised his own.
Tony steps up onto the low wall, naked as he looks down at Manhattan. He allows the rolling, sparking heat that now hums beneath his skin constantly to grow and expand, and he feels his body morph.
Fury apparently.
The water was murky, but it was slow enough to show Tony’s reflection.  He looked haggard, his long damp hair curling more than usual at the ends, his beard in dire need of a trim.  His eyes were sunken, and if others were to be believed, empty.  But the ember glow still burned, that glint his mother told him was his alone, a gift from the gods.
to say – fuck – is that, whatever happens, whatever unforgiveable thing I think you’ve done – damn it!” Steve fists the armrest until Tony hears ominous cracking. Steve backs off, breathing thickly through his nose. “Tony.” And it is in every way Tony had ever wanted to hear, forlorn and desperate and filled with a burdened longing, loneliness that only Tony could cure. “At – at the end of the day, you’re
Magdalena wasn’t even on the list of “Places to Take Steve to Show Him How Much You Love Him”, but it wasn’t just for shits and giggles that they were going.  Thor Odinson, forensic specialist in arson and close friend to Crew 91, was getting married to his astrophysicist sweetheart, Jane.  (They had met, Tony learned, when a fire had broken out at one of the many research facilities littered around Magdalena.  Thor had shown up, said “I specialize in arson – “ and Jane had slapped him before he could even show his badge.   And now they were getting married before their baby was due in March.)  The two of them were “sickeningly” in love (according to Clint).
Basically this is set during a time between the two eras of Ancient Greek history we are familiar with, which has comparatively less information about it out there.  I’ve taken a lot of liberties on the historical canon, but this is fanficton.  I’m sure you can understand ;)
“Falconry?  Maybe.”  Tony had been given a tiny bird to be trained to hunt when he was small, but Pepper had fallen in love with the bird and he’d let her have it.  She’d fed the thing too many dates and killed it, and was inconsolable for weeks.  She still flinched when anyone brought it up.
So whoever he has kids with will want to name their daughter after him.  Great.  “I like that you’re named after my mother.  Peter, be happy you’re not named Howard.”
Still with Tony hoisted onto his hips, rubbing himself against Steve's abs eagerly, he stepped out of the shower and reached for a towel.  He gently lowered Tony to a bench and began to thoroughly dry him, rubbing the Turkish cloth gently over Tony's entire body.
,” he moaned, and Tony hummed in agreement.
So Tony had put his foot down, called his travel agent, said he needed a decent place for two couples and two single grown men near Magdalena, New Mexico.
“Yeah.  Sure,” Tony muttered, still in his phone.
Thor shouted, “Who allowed this horror to be ingested?”, spitting out the pudding.
“For as long as I can remember –
He still missed Pepper, but the pain from that was dulling as it was replaced by longing for a certain someone else.  He hid behind “She’s away for business” and hoped no one noticed they hadn’t seen her in six months.
Natasha stroked his hair, Bruce laid a comforting hand on his shoulder.  The three of them watched as Clint and several doctors on break tried to calm the god of thunder down.
Tony turned to Steve, and was suddenly aware of how close the man was.  His face was only a
. Shapanka’s icy fingers were curling around the ledge, working on pulling himself up. With lack of anything better to do, Tony stomped down on the frozen hands.
“What do you think – honestly – about why I did what I did?  I don’t know myself, I can’t – why do you think –“  Steve cuts himself off, waiting.
Steve didn’t have the decency to look abashed.  “I
“You’re not worried?  About the other guy?”
a chance.  He had escaped the ice.  What's to say he couldn't overcome the void of pain and misunderstanding and longing?
.  Zoloto hangs her head.
The Asgardian looked offended by the accusatory finger.  “Me?”
This was the father of his children.
Then Steve had ‘tried’ to smother Tony with a pillow, which had devolved into the two of them smashing each other in the head with pillows, which then turned to play wresting, which ended up with Tony deep-throating his cock while Steve simultaneously demonstrated his nonexistent gag reflex.
Phlegm was clogging his throat. “But – but when the flames hit the gas tank –“
“He’s not home.”  Steve had driven Bucky back to Camp Nelson after they had gotten lunch.  The roundtrip drive from Malibu to the tiny town in the forest Steve and his crew members lived in was about eight hours, and Steve had said he might hang out with them for a little while and get some paperwork he needed to go over.  The satellite tracking on Steve’s phone said he’d be home any minute.
Tony listens as Steve rifles through the linen closet.
“We’ll both be here tomorrow.  Can I just hold you for now?”
“Steve. Move.  Now.”
The covers moved, pulling up around Steve’s neck.  He shifted slightly, moving infeasibly closer to Tony, but stopping just short of touching.  A heated millimeter hovered between their blankets.
Then the Vita Ray chamber was tipping up, sealing him inside.  Suddenly there was calm, nothing but Maria’s murmur of
Thor was standing at the end of the aisle, greeting guests with warm, full-bodied hugs.  Next to him stood a short man with a bushy white beard and an eye patch, with a tall, regal woman with golden hair on his arm.  Presumably his parents.  There was also a shifty-looking guy with stringy black hair in a tacky green-and-gold suit and handcuffs, with an Icelandic corrections officer hovering behind him.
Finally had time to watch the movies to get the proper dialogue!
“Tony,” Steve started as Tony was scrubbing his hands with GoJo, filling the muggy air with the cutting scent of orange, “are we, um – “
,” Steve found himself pleading.
“Steve,” he croaked, feeling it build.  He’d gone too long without this.  Not that stamina would benefit him here.
Tony couldn’t help it.  Steve was so different from him in so many ways, but Tony was sure that if they got past the huffing and the yelling, they would fit together seamlessly, filling one another’s negative space until they were a single cohesive unit.
“Don’t make me make you.”
She whispered, barely enough for him to hear.  “May whatever god looks over you give you clear sight.”  She cleared her throat and held out a scroll.  “I need you to seal this.”
“Don’t worry, Tony.  If a song hurts, it means something.”  He paused for a moment.  “And she always remembers; it’s just kind of touch-and-go.”
“Don’t Steve, I know.”
“Nnnoooo,” Tony clung to Steve’s chest.
saying this, Stark?”
The common living room was bathed in the blue light of the wide screen and the golden glow from the kitchen.
“Alright.  Hey.  Alright.  Good job, guys.  Let's just not come in tomorrow.  Let's just take a day.  Have you ever tried shawarma?  There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.  I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it,” Stark blathered.
“Following is not really my style.”
The dust wasn’t clearing. No, the dust had fallen, but smoke was rising from the engine compartment. The heat was spreading, and the crack of fire on metal sounded.
“Wait.” Carol slams her open palms of the table, sending her cup of creamer-with-a-dash-of-coffee spilling over the table into her lap.  Tony winces.  Carol ignores it.  “You.”  She points at Steve.  “Why aren’t you grilling him?”  She points at Tony.
“Have you
Nausikaa squealed, and suddenly there was a small net bag in her hands.  She stepped forward, and reached into the bag to draw out a handful of something which she tossed over his head.  Naus walked around his three times, throwing fistfuls as she went.  Tony reached out to catch what it was she was throwing: dried figs and assorted nuts.  Immediately, a lump formed in his throat.
will be remaining here for the next week.”
“STEVE!” Tony screamed, struggling harder.
The part about Erskine’s claim of Steve as his heir was well-worn gossip.  Tongues had been wagging about a poor Athenian bastard being left the kingship of an island, even a tiny backwater.  But then reports had come through about Steve’s heroism, and the whispers of him being godly offspring, and public opinion in Athens has swung towards egotistical boasting about how even Athens’ poor were better than everywhere else.  (People had conveniently forgotten that Steve’s mother had emigrated from Thera.)
*knows she's an attention whore but, checks her inbox for comments like 600 times a day*
As the years pass, he finds more and more snapped pairs of sunglasses, and he stops replacing them.
“Will do, honey. But gotta let me win the race first.”
He had introduced himself as Saoirse at school, and the other children had laughed.
Just until the meeting was over.  He just had to wait until the meeting was over.
“Oh Tony!” a feminine voice called, at odds with the grit and grease of the track. The pit crew puffed up their chests and attempted to wipe the black smudges from their faces, but the pristine woman in white linen and a red head scarf only had eyes for Tony as she rushed into his arms.
away for future exploration. “Hey.” He reached over and nudged Steve’s upper arm, feeling the rock-hard muscle beneath the fabric. “Don’t sell yourself short.”
“- asked me.” Bruce cleared his throat awkwardly.  “The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract.  But it's gonna take weeks to process.”
She stared at him for a while.  Tony wanted to squirm under her scrutiny.  “Well, you can make up for being rude by carrying my baskets for me.”
Steve shrugged, eyes still on the sky.  “This mentoring thing?  Surely you haven’t forgotten?  Anyway, you wouldn’t be able to keep up with me.”  Steve looked back at him, appraising but unreadable.  “You know you don’t have put on any formalities here, don’t you?  This isn’t Athens.”
“That’s . . . different.”
Tony can see the righteous indignation seep out, leaving only the empty mass of wounds that remain of the man who had died seventy-one years ago.  He lowers himself back onto the bench, it creaking and settling like old bones.
“But what?”
Maria huffed.
Still breathing heavily, Tony sat on one of the boulders directly in the surf.  He reached down to scoop water over his face, and relished the feel of the cool waves washing over his burning calves.  Steve had wandered off, but returned with the jars that had held their lunch filled with crisp fresh water.  They drank in silence for a while, taking in the turquoise water and chalking cliffs littered with wiry trees.
Tony continued. “Happy, you have been complaining the entire time. Not particularly cheerful. Steve, don’t worry about it.”
“I’ll get Howard on the line.  He’ll know what to do.”
Steve nods, waits. The recording continues.
“Never said it would.  But it’s not a switch, don’t you get it?  There will never be a way to go into someone’s head and scrub something out.  And if there was, don’t you think it would end up being used more to make people
And maybe sex isn’t what Steve needs, but what else can Tony give him?
“Hey, we’re from Richland.  Just an unannounced inspection.  Nothing to worry about,” Tony breezed, pitching his lower and making sure his cap covered his eyes.
“But yes,” Korkyra answered.  “We are enlightened to some things.  Now, let us look at you.”
“I’m gonna wake up soon.”
He kicked off his boots and socks, toes smarting at the still-damp floor from the kids’ baths.  The rest of his clothes followed, making a tiny pile in the only dry patch of floor, right behind the door.
“At this point I doubt anything would surprise me.”
A large hand carded through his hair, but Steve didn’t look up from his tablet.  “That would be counterproductive.”
Tony just rolled his eyes.  “Yeah, cause everyone else here has been so forthcoming with information.”
“Is that an OPI box?” Bruce asked.  “You didn’t seriously buy more-“
“If you’re asking if I’m back for good, then the answer is yes.”
“No limit?” Clint asks questioningly, glaring at the card with distrust.
“Let’s get this over with,” Tony growled, and marched down the desolate hall towards the door marked with the appropriate station.
Tony glanced over where Steve was getting kissed on the cheek by Peggy and clapped on the shoulders by the guy they called Dum-Dum.  He looked so happy.  “I would never.”

an important development.”
Steve laughed, his melancholy from the ride to the plant miles away. His eyes lit up when he saw the painting displayed in pride of place. “Is that Iron Man?”
“Steve,” it was tearing him in two, but if it was Steve wanted, he didn’t care. “You can’t tell me about it, but from the little I have gotten, you did some top secret work for the military. It was good and necessary work, but for some reason, they don’t want you continuing it. Funding or something else?”
Once he began passing all the travelers coming out of the west gate, he began to hear shouts and cheers, people running back into the city screaming “
Clint nodded.  “Just needed the name, thank you, but by all means give me the whole biography.  And don’t tell everyone about my snooping.  Not that I do it.”
He had asked what it meant.
homemade cocoa was.  Clint just sat on the counter, throwing cheese popcorn into the air for himself to catch with his mouth.  He never missed.
Tony jumped as Steve pressed against his side, but relaxed immediately.  “Well, my half of them.  Wanna see?”  He didn’t wait for a response before fiddling with a microscopic arm, and a second later the screen above the table displayed an image of two human eggs, slightly grey and clinging to the edge of the tube.

“Whatcha watchin’, Steve?”
“Uuurgf,
Then shots sounded.
“Would you try eating solids if I made beef stew tomorrow?  Or I could use oxtails, or veal, or lamb?”
He dumped his bag at the foot of the bed and crawled into his cocoon, suddenly assaulted by a sharp, slightly spicy scent.  It made him want to scrunch up his nose, but also made him feel . . . safe.
Tony wasn’t going to pretend he hadn’t imagined what kissing Steve would be like.  But this does not live up to his expectations.  Steve is not shy and uncertain; slow, yes, but filled with intent, like this man doesn’t want to let opportunities slip through his fingers.  Like he knows loss, he knows pain, and knows he’ll experience them again, so he should try for happiness where it’s available.
When he can be made to see a different perspective.  Which has become harder as time has gone on.
explain that to the missus.”
Steve didn’t know whether to cover him, draw him, or lick him.
“Oh.”
"Goddamn it, Tony!" Steve shouted, marching over and peeling his helmet off.  He was projecting, as always.   But his anger felt vindicated.  With everything that was going on in his head and his heart right now, Steve felt the right to be frustrated with his life.  Tony being reckless and Tony not talking to him . . . .
of them.”
“Hello?”  One of the doors was propped open with a fire extinguisher, emitting the sounds of a ball game.  A man in a sweat-drenched tee shirt and a shining bald patch popped his head out.
Tony was still in the suit, but that didn’t stop Steve from wrapping his arms tightly around Tony’s shoulders, fingerers moving and digging into the tender skin of Tony’s slender throat, tangling in the soft curl at the nape of his neck, unconsciously trying to peel the armor away, to find the slender, muscled form beneath.
A swallow comes from the other end of the line.
Tony presses foreheads with the both of them one last time, before stepping away slightly to shed his outer clothing.  It isn't winter anymore, but the cold still gets to him.  Quickly, he activates it, and the metal folds around him for the first time in months.  Safe, his mind says.  Safe now.
Steve just shook his head.  He put his hands on his knees as he lifted himself from his own bench.  “Not one to be distracted.  I’ll have to remember that.  As for the forge . . . it
Tony made a face.  “Ugh, no.  You guys are disgusting.  Beer.  Specifically, Guinness.  And before you say it, yes I too am shocked that our America boy likes Irish beer.”
.” It’s careful, void of any recrimination, and a fair bit welcome.
Maria had said gently.
“Who says I’m not perfectly fine?”
And Tony might even let him.  And when they woke up . . . .
“Water, vinegar, and a few drops of food coloring.”  He shrugged of Tony’s look of incredulity.  “Say what you will, she eats it up.  It also does double duty by killing ant trails in the summer.”
“Going to a therapist isn’t going to cut it – “
“I don’t see how that’s a party.”
He stepped in close to read the sign.
.  It hit too close to home.  But,
Steve’s entire forehead had wrinkled quite thunderously at Tony’s mention of Howard, which made Tony think that maybe it was true that in Steve he would find another ally in his private war with his father.  But he seemed to decide that now wasn’t the time to get into it.  “It was, indeed.  Did you notice the islands at the mouth of the harbor?”  Steve gestured across the water, towards a small rock, bearing nothing more than a few trees.  “They say that one was the ship that was used to carry Odysseus back to Ithaka.  Poseidon was, of course, angry, so he turned the boat to stone.  Nothing has been built there, because we have been worried about his wrath, but I have wondered if it might be an appropriate place for a new temple.  The gods are fond of flattery, and our seafaring has only grown.  What do you think?”
“I haven’t heard of you wrestling with Herakles,” Tony said mildly, not wanting the backlash that would come with informing him that he was not indeed a river but instead a dinky stream.
Well, he hasn’t got the body for a day laborer.  So what if he dreams a bit?
It's ridiculous, but it's all he has.  A feeling.
“Steve doesn’t really want to believe it.”
“Are you

Steve breathes out like a gust. “I’m here for you Tony, but I didn’t come up here to be attacked.”
Perhaps he was being a bit too obvious, but Steve rolled his eyes and shook his head.  “Oh, just take it down.  Everyone always asks to.”
“No.  Everything’s great.  Maybe the novelty will wear off, but . . . there are a

to,” Steve huffed.  “I want to know if you want to become a part of us.  If you are willing.”
“How would you know?  Why is he Phil?”
Hopefully he would find out about Tony being Iron Man before he found out how Tony felt about him.
Steve allowed himself one humorless snort.
“Should we intervene?”
Bruce, bless him, only raised an eyebrow.  “You think?”
“And you'll get your Cube back, no muss, no fuss.  What is Phase 2?”
Steve frowned. “You don’t have to go through so much trouble. I slept on camp beds or damp ground for years. I don’t need anything fancy.”
“You look just fine the way you are.”
The front desk gave the man a set of keys for a first-floor room as soon as he said “Tony Stark”, and they quickly got him inside the blessedly dark and cool room. The man tried to deposit Tony on the bed, but he just waved the man off. Eyebrows twisted in confusion, the man bowed out. Tony heard the lock snick from the other side.
“Don’t bullshit me, Tony.  You fought Vanko mainly because he threatened me.  You didn’t need to, but . . . still, thank you.”
Natasha stilled, and gave him a calculating stare.  “He spent some time at the temples praying for your safe arrival, and whatever else he needs from the gods.  Made some sacrifices.  He’s very worried about you.”   She waited for his reaction.
“There’s a reason people don’t talk about their kids.  Gives people information you might not want them to have.”
Two other women were reclined on a large boulder.  They both looked ageless, but for some inexplicable reason Tony felt they were more mature.  Both wore their dark hair in braids.  One was dressed much the same as the first, but her tunic was a softer shade of seafoam, and the golden diadem she wore was more substantial, akin to the ones Tony’s mother would wear.  She looked less robust than the first, more delicate and ethereal.  The third wore a longer tunic that was the shade of spilled wine, and while she was paler than the others, her cheeks were quite flush.  Her hair was crowned with a wreath of fresh ivy and grapevines like a
was Natasha going to get Tony to go for the bouquet.
“You’re beautiful. You’ve always been beautiful.  I just guess I can finally tell you.”
"What?" Tony squawked.  "How dare you?
“Tony,” Steve looked up, bleary-eyed, the impression of the whip stitch on the edge of the blanket zigzagging across his face.  He smiled, big and open and like Tony had made the world a better place by being there.  All the dirty looks he had gotten vanished, replaced by that ever-growing pull between utter contentment and desperate longing.
He sounded pleased.
“Uncanny,” Natasha said as Sam snickered.
“What is all this?”
Tony always had difficulty connecting people he knew with having kids.  Vary rarely were kids taken into his world, aside from the Make-A-Wish children and those that approached him.  Offers had been made for the Avengers to appear at elementary schools, but people had protested a “self-appointed squad of egotistical freaks” influencing children.  The PR reps always responded with a soft “no”, giving some bullshit about potential attacks and safety.  So, the team was beloved by children but was not allowed near them very often.  But still, the mails bags came loaded with crayon drawings and badly-executed letters.
with me.”
“Well, we all got back into town a few hours ago, and thought we’d give you a few more hours to sort yourselves out,” Bruce supplied, stacking the pastry boxes on the counter next to the fridge.
“Oh, shit.  Steeeeeve, hide me,” Tony tried to climb up Steve’s shoulders, and kicking out, making Bruce and Sam flinch away.
So, that was out of his system.  Now he wouldn’t have to worry about rutting against Steve in the night, just cuddling up to his warmth.
came the sly reply.
Natasha was looking at Steve with undeniable approval.
Tony wanted to ask what they meant, but I remembered what Steve told him.  So he kept quiet.
And afterward, it’s satisfying, physically, but emotionally?  It wreaks him.
“Everything I own is in my car. I was road tripping with no destination.”
“We’re about forty minutes out from home base, sir.”
Barton nodded.
The presumed woman’s room was located closest to a second set of back stairs, presumably for servants.  Her room had nothing in the way of looms or spinning; the most feminine objects were several vases of flowers and a table set with a large circular bronze mirror, brushes, and
Tony burrowed into Steve’s neck, humming contentedly.  “Mmm.  Warm.”
“Wait, wait, wait.  Just what do Alastors

“Umm, how’s Iron Man?”

are.”
“TONY, WHY ARE YOU NAKED?"
He didn’t want to think about that.  Not now, not with Tony breathing trough a tube four floors above him.  “Maybe I’ll make him a little comic.  He loves those.”
He wondered how much his mother’s heart would break, waving her only son off to war.  Knowing there was a good chance that he would never come back.
But that shield . . . .  Seeing it stirred something within him that he could not name.  The heat, the fire that seemed to exist only in him.  The way the hearth seemed to beckon him, the strange desire to thrust his hand into the flames and caress the embers.  The impulse to coat his fingers in glowing liquid bronze and anoint himself with it, as if it were oil.
“Who?”
“You’re –
Steve closed his eyes, letting the water make tiny rivers around his brows and nose.
Tony found Steve’s fingers and squeezed his hand.  “It’s fun.  They do it because they care about you.  It’s nice.”
The twins seemed very interested in Peggy, but when Steve pushed them, he was met with silence.  Usually they just told him that someone wasn’t right for him, so hopefully they wanted Steve to find out on his own.
“I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.”
“Padma.”
He loved Tony.
Before they set out, Tony and Steve had donned sandals (Steve said it would be much too warm for cloaks, as they would be back before sunset).  Steve had also picked up some waterskins, a pair of jars filled with
Steve sighed and leaned back on his arms.  “Don’t think I’m not aware of your . . . situation.  I might even have more information regarding it than yourself.”
He turned back to Shapanka. “Is this true?”
Tony had taken the silver Audi, as anything else he owned would stand out, and it was a testament to his driving that he didn’t ram himself into a tree on eighty separate occasions, twisting through the winding roads.  He nervously twisted the golden amulet that Steve had given him almost a year before.  He couldn’t remember ever taking it off.
He was in the process of laying into the supersoldier-reinforced-yet-still-not-quite-enough punching bags when JARVIS spoke up.

they were avenging, but he could deduce it was some sort of vague ideal.  But the Alastors themselves seemed very vague.  It was probably best to assume that eventually he would be enlightened to their secrets (they seemed to
“So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?”
“Hey, man, she’s your kid.  I have zero know-how on dealing with those tiny demons.  But if you think that’s what she needs from you as a dad,” he shrugged, making the tower teeter dangerously, “it’s not a bad thing that you’re trying to be a good dad.”
It was there, clear as day and night.
and get to know me.  So it’s a little difficult to understand why he would say the whole future was riding on me.  I don’t get that.  We’re talking about a man whose first instinct to his wife being pregnant was to try and divorce her, and whose happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.”
“Is this a submarine?”
“My private elevator.”
It really shouldn’t have been a surprise that, after a few perfunctory greetings, Steve quickly made a beeline toward the wall where Tony and Bruce were sitting.  “So, Natasha didn’t kill him this morning?  A shame.  She must be losing her touch.”  Even though she was on the opposite side of the yard, she seemed to hear Steve’s remark.  Her glare could have pierced bronze.
“Steve – “
“I have an army.”
Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow for me.”
“You’re very good at this,” Tony noted quietly, loath to interrupt the stillness of the rosy dawn, but also genuinely impressed at her skill.  Natasha was obviously deadly, but in such a precise, controlled way that was impossible not to find awe-inspiring.
“Tony.” Steve face is full of light, but is terribly cautious, like he wants to believe but is terrified to.  “Spell it out.  Please.”
“What?  How is he different?”
“Then why are you bumming with me?”
“Uh, Antinous, Prince of Athens."
Steve stared at him.  “Not interested . . . ?” he muttered bewilderedly, then a look of troubled understanding crossed his face.  “You think our sex life slowing down means our relationship is in trouble?”
He stands, vulnerable in his snow shoes. Nothing but a few layers of cloth protects him from frostbite and death.
“Yeah, there’s a lot of things Fury doesn’t tell you.”
, of something beyond the harsh, dirty world he knew.
Breathing is difficult.  His heartrate is up to what are unsafe levels, but no matter how many breathing exercises he tries it won’t help.  There are a multitude of solutions, but all but one see impossible to reach without drastically changing the fabric of reality.  “I - I need out.  Out of my brain.  Out of Tony Stark.  It’s – it’s like I’m choking.  On everything.  I – I want
He was so beautiful.  And all for Steve.
He could hear the crowds from the road. People recognized him, waving and cheering even while wearing another racer’s colors. Tony made sure to give a jaunty wave before slipping into the tunnel towards the pits.

Romanoff was regarding him carefully.  “I’ve seen worse.”
“Sorry, Tony,” Steve gasped.  “I gotta-“
“But you’d need people with godly blood.  The gods have been absent.”
And Steve was barely an inch from his face.

“Helmet, too.”

He grimaced.  “Look, let’s just forget yesterday even happened, okay?  Let’s just – “
“Not anymore.”
A step that could spin him to heaven, so to could hurl him to hell.
And now one of the biggest things they have in common, having only the Avengers for family, is no longer applicable.
She poured some champagne for herself.
Steve raised his eyebrows, but Stark seemed to have figured it out.
Stark sounded so pathetic Steve just had to laugh.
Not in the way Tony had kisses his fingers and murmured something that he couldn’t hear, but felt in his bones as
Howard probably was worried of Tony poisoning him, or outright killing him, but Tony would never kill his father.  But not planning the death of a person didn’t mean the death wouldn’t be welcome when it came.
“Sir, I’m gonna have to ask you to exit the donut.”
“You’ve been very busy.  You made your PA your CEO, you’re givin’ away all your stuff, you let your friend fly away with your suit.  Now, if I didn’t know better-“
Later, they’re tucking into a spread of pizzas when Steve rounds on him.
Maria was in her solar, possibly the best room in the palace.  The second floor windows looked over the center courtyard, but the curtains gave it an air of anonymity.  Tony could remember when he was very small, wrapping himself in the fine linen and pretending she wouldn’t be able to find him.
That makes Steve pause. “Okay, Zemo.  I’m just going to say this once.  Call off your goons or you’ll just get us all killed.  Fight us like a man.”
“Could’ve fooled me.”  But Steve’s words made him feel better.  He’d been tied up in knots the entire trip there, but somehow, he could tell he was being welcomed into their little group.  “She had me up at dawn to help her with the opium.”
“I know. I just . . . I want to go, but at the same time want to stay.”
drink. He had a shitty childhood? Not too difficult to tell people. He was struggling with guilt? Still is, but now he knows how to handle it differently. He felt alone?
“Waited for you.”
But all of his back story was difficult to reconcile with the teenager in front of him.  At ease as he moved away from Steve’s chair and sprawled onto the couch cushions, leg thrown carelessly over the arm.  Easy smile on his lips, eyebrows quirked in such a way that implied his tremendous intelligence.  But there were lines where there shouldn’t be, worry lines that Steve had never formed even growing up in the heart of the Depression.  He sounded so weary as he softly murmured:
“You’re such a cheeseball.” But Steve is smiling and is reaching out and taking Tony’s hand, looking a lot less alone then he has for as long as Tony has known him.
“Back with us?” Nausikaa asked, perched were Makris had sat, her feet tucked under her.
Steve?”
He frowns.  “I’m not a duckling,” he mutters.
Steve ignored her.  “Tony?  Still with us?”
Tony looked up, nose snotty and plugged, eyes scratchy and red.  “Why?”
Five days.  It has been five days.
Steve immediately pushed the bowl of peanuts away. “It’s like you read my mind.”
“Sure, Tony,” Steve mumbled into his hip.  “Now.  Sleep.”
The grass slowly dissipated as boulders became more plentiful.  Scrub and stunted trees dotted the mountainside.  Wild goats bleated at them before scampering off.  The brilliant sun bore down, making Steve glow like a god and Tony sweat like a pig.
Korkyra blew him a kiss.  “You need it, darling.”
He’s never inhaled the crystallizing vapor of clouds before. It’s crisp and clear and burns his nose.
They were the heroes.  Tony was barely an adventurer.
“Well,
Halfway through the informal meal, Steve entered in a huff of sweat and skin.  A chorus of voices welcomed him, and he smiled in an abashed way as he adjusted his exomis and accepted a large bowl of porridge.  Typically, the head of the household would be expected to eat first, but Bruce said that Steve had a habit of arriving late to meals to make sure everyone else got their fill.
Half of Tony wants to automatically apologize, while the other half wants to scream in frustration.  He sees the desolation on Steve’s face, he can tell it affected him terribly . . . but Tony can’t find it in him to feel sorry for him.  There’s a trace of pity, but Steve hasn’t done anything that warrants Tony’s sympathy.  Steve doesn’t deserve anything Tony has to give anymore.
“No.  SHEILD doesn’t recruit people with voices anymore unless they’re specialists, stopped in the fifties . . . .”
He refused.  Asshole.
“Oh, no.”

Tony barely had time to shout “

Tony winced.  “Well, the chorus is
Tony forced himself to stay calm. Everyone Jack Frost – apparently Shapanka – had frozen had been revived after the ice was melted. He wasn’t going to lose Steve. Or Happy or Pepper, he reminded himself somewhat ashamedly.
“You just might.”
Tony pondered who Steve’s godly parent must be.  And it
Pietro was a fast one, and by the time he reached the west gate, about half of the inhabitants of the city were milling about, weaving summer flowers and grasses into garlands, draping them over the horse, covering up the scent of decaying flesh with heliotrope, lavender, larkspur, myrtle, poppy, and everlasting.
Tony sat, and stared unseeingly out the window.
.  It’s not a machine.  Trust me.  Machines are so much easier.  There are ways to break reinforced reactions and other things, but what do either of you expect?  That he’ll forget everything?  That he’ll miraculously revert back to be exactly the same as your old buddy?  The most you can hope for is to find a way to override the override, and time to come to terms with everything that has happened.  But if you think that ‘getting him back’ means getting the guy you knew back in the forties, you’re sorely mistaken.”

Steve smiled ruefully. “I’m
But his heart was telling him not to listen.
“No.  Anyone can have godly blood.  Many people do.  The gods are not celibate.  But they have withheld their blessings, to all but a very select few.  Might you know anyone like that?”  Steve smiled impishly.  Tony’s heart was hammering.  “But it’s not something I should dump on you all at once.”  He made his way down the narrow hall, stopping and pulling aside a curtain with a flourish after Tony stumbled up the stairs and reached him.  “You’ll be living here.  You can freshen up, take a nap, explore, if you’d like.  We’ll be having dinner in the throne room.”
The woman in blue and gold tilted her head and smiled.  “Thor, my sweet, are you going to introduce me to your friends?”
The man appraised him warily.  “Oh yeah, hi.  Ty told me you’d be coming.”
He takes a moment to breathe, then walks with mechanical movements over towards the sink. He splashes cold water on his face and scrubs his eyes vigorously, but when he looks around for the mirror he doesn’t find one. Of course. Tony never liked mirrors. Steve has to make do with wiping damp paper towels under his eyes and hoping they don’t look too bloodshot. But they probably will, and he finds doesn’t care.
private elevator?”
“Yeah,” relief at being able to talk about them for once flooded his system.  “Ria called you ‘Uncle Bruce’, so I must assume this is the start to a beautiful friendship.”
Steve straightens his shoulders, shifting in position into something a bit more formal.  Tony becomes aware of the expanse of table between him.  Not like a desk, which sitting on one side gives one more power of the other.  But instead a conference table of equal individuals, each with their own distinct passion and belief, facing each other.
“Tony,” Steve frowns, and damn, he’s too smart for his own good, “you barely drink anymore.”
“JARVIS, see if you can get Pepper to set up a meeting with marketing and OPI’s designer collections manager.  Not leaving you hanging, soldier,” Tony grinned.  “Now come here.”
“Got an assignment.”  Bullshit, they
“Do you need your meds?”
The Russian’s eyes glittered with too much knowledge.  “They don’t know it’s mutual.  Anyway, they’re just becoming more than acquaintances.  If they started anything now, it probably wouldn’t end very well.”
Yes, Tony was still a teenager, and yes, he had emotional problems, but everyone that knew him had said that Tony had improved exponentially since he had joined the Avengers.  Eighteen was the age of majority, Tony was legally allowed to vote and pay taxes and marry and fuck and die for his country.
Visiting hours were over.  The only people still here were working or waiting.
“Pepper,” Steve grabbed her shoulders and forced her to hold his gaze.  “You’ve been with Tony through some of the worst times of his life.  There’s nothing wrong with feeling responsible for him.  I just hope you realize that you don’t have to do it alone, anymore.  You said it yourself, we’re his family.  We’ll take care of him.”
He could tell Steve was grinning ridiculously from the tone of his voice, and well, Steve’s good moods were usually infectious.  Tony flipped Bruce off, because the asshole was still grinning in smug satisfaction.  He heard Steve pass the baby off to what sounded like Sam and Natasha, then striding and the slamming of the screen door.
“I’m still better off than you.  I know what’s wrong with me at least.  When you know the problem, then – then you can start to figure out what to do.  Then you can work on developing yourself.”
“What does the other part want?”
“How – “
“Nah, he likes it, see?”
Tony opened his mouth, like he was going to say something, but decided against it, closing his mouth and shaking his head.

Steve shot back, and Tony stuck out his tongue at him.
With a practiced hand, like those familiar with lonely nights and immense frustration, Steve had his erection cupped in his palm, slowly rubbing up and down the shaft, the forerunner to the game.
Loki smirked tightly.  “Yes.  I’ve met them.”
But at times like tonight, it just adds another layer to the bitterness at the insurmountable barrier that lies between whatever it is that they are now and the possibility of what could be if things were different, if they didn’t hurt each other so much, if Steve cared for him in the same way Tony always had.
“Nah, but there's no good in wondering.  We're us. We’re both pains in each other’s asses, but it keeps us in check. Part of the reason we’re both terrible and perfect together. You being a stubborn ass is part of why I love you.”
of you. Big-hearted Stark, tossing a crumb of freedom to a lowly crook.” He hooked a finger over his shoulder back towards the vault. “How about adding a few crumbs of severance pay? You have more money than you know what to do with!”
Steve is frowning at him. “He’s your cousin?”
“Awww, then you can’t draw my ass.”
A picture of Steve embracing a leanly muscled man, with long dark hair and a devil-may-care attitude.  Embracing close, as people who loved each other very much would.  Standing in front of one of the best restaurants in LA, where celebrity couples often went for “low-key” dates.
“You cannot.  Please do keep me posted if you do find anyone,” Steve requested.

“We do most of our work outside, so you might as well get used to it.  Not that I’m expecting you to become a regular laborer, but with the harvest coming up, all hands are needed.  We’ll start harvesting the wine grapes near the end of the month.  Olive harvest starts in
At least, that’s what Tony has determined for himself.
“Oh God.”
They shared a laugh, but Tony’s eyes were invariably drawn back to the shield.  The reached out to stroke the slivery metal.  Steve handed it over.  “Where did you get this?  I’ve never seen this metal before.”
Tony froze, and looked up slowly, cognac eyes wide and whiskey-bright.  There was something in the air, making it thicken.  Steve would have said congealed, but it was too hot.
But no amount of captured stardust will ever bring Tony back to him.
“I would love to help.  But, Steve promised to show me the island today,” Tony answered.
“Don’t you realize it’s about a veteran coming home to a world that doesn’t accept him anymore?”
.  Fuck,” Tony hissed, grabbing at his shoulder, where a line of neat blue plastic ran through his skin.
It was worrisome, to say the least.  The silver band on his finger wasn’t a legally binding contract.  When they’d started planning the wedding, Tony’s lawyers had descended, demanding pre-nups and contracts.  Steve had turned green reading the papers.  So wedding planning was currently on hold.
of leaving them to . . . well.  Steve wanted to punch something.
“Often enough. Why?”
was going to happen, but he had no sure idea of what.
They turned back to the wall, and Tony’s eyes were drawn back to what he had been staring at last night: the battered but still immaculate
“Let him think he’s safe, then we’ll head after him. He won’t be able to wash it off for months.”
Steve’s fingers are still curled around the beam, but they have gone limp has he stares at Zemo in horror.
“You speak of control, yet you court chaos.”
“I refuse.”
As he seemed to know where they were going, Tony let Steve take the lead, making long strokes through the crystalline water.  Steve’s form as flawless as he led Tony toward the series of caves he had pointed out.  They headed for one that looked larger than the others, aquamarine water illuminating them from below, dozens of tiny fish nipping at their heels.
“Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke . . . Harlem.”  He shifted awkwardly.
The little girl who didn’t want the orange grabbed it from her father, skipping over and presented it to Tony proudly.  Tony dug his thumb into the peel, pushing until he was squishing the pulp, releasing the scent of citrus.  He shoved it under Steve’s nose.
“Yes, I’ve learned to take Clint’s stories with a grain of salt.  You don’t regularly set Men’s Warehouse suits on fire to make a point, do you?”
“Oh, and Tony?” Peggy called.  He turned and for a second she stood tall, the steely glint in her eye sharper than any dagger and more than capable of killing any man.  “You asked how you would be in love.  You’d believe in them.  You’d give them everything.  You’d give your whole heart, because you aren’t capable of anything less.”
“Where were you stationed?”
have to deal with.  Contrary to popular belief, you are not the center of my universe.  I have bigger problems than you in the Southwest region to deal with.  Hit ‘em.”
“What’s that?”  Tony points at the bag.
Pepper sighed.  She’d been sighing a lot over the past half-hour.
One of the newer slaves, Thratta for lack of any other name, stood tall and pregnant over his mother’s small form, scolding with a look of disdain on her face.

Necessary for the upcoming fight,
When he returned home again, he locked himself away with his circuit boards and forgot he even considered geology worthwhile.
Tony stretched and yawned, blinked impossibly wide, then smiled brilliantly up at him.  “Steve,” he murmured, sounding
She had cried with the others upon the disappearance of Fastnet Rock, then focused on the rippling red, white, and blue above her head.
Even if Steve doesn’t stay.
“Ow!”
They don’t talk about their fight-slash-confession confrontation the day he returned.
Shapanka snorted. “Oh how
“If you want, I can stay with you for a few hours, and carry you if you need it,” Steve offered.
“What happened?” Peggy demanded the moment she stepped down from the carriage.
“Trouble sleeping?”  It was Fury, the man with the eye patch.  The current director of SHEILD, the successor to the SSR.  Founded by Peggy.
And it wasn’t like he was a fresh-faced, just out of high school brat who had never been in the real world.  Tony had been shot at and abused and tortured, he had seen the worst humanity could be, had been manipulated, learned to do all those things right back for his own defense.
There was time now, Tony thought giddily.  Time for the two of them, together.
Pepper sounded awed.
“Can I see?”
Silently, Tony shook apart.  He had been so focused on Steve, he’d been unaware of his own erection.  It wasn’t a pleasurable orgasm.  He came down to Steve licking his fingers clean, removing the evidence, and pulling his shirt down on his newly-cleaned chest.
by color.  Steve had read off some fact to him, that it was the largest half-dome in the world when it was built, and was still second next to the Sidney Opera House.  Tony hadn’t expected it to be this bright though.  The upper portions of the dome were painted in stripes of half-circles, all oranges and yellows.  The colors didn’t mesh well with the pale stone of the columns and floors and the aluminum trim, but the overall effect with muted, recessed lighting was cheery and welcoming.  Tony followed in Steve’s wake as he drifted past the admissions desk, which was still open for people with questions, and came to rest in the center of the hall.

“This isn’t a consultation.”
” accompanied by champagne poppers and tinny speakers playing “Born in the USA”.  Tony opened his eyes only to be hit in the face with a flag.  Laughing, Steve pulled it off their heads only to reveal Sam and Clint doing some elaborate war dance while waving smaller flags and Bucky fired off more poppers.
Steve is completely still, eyelashes fanning softly over the bags under his eyes. His breathing is quick and shallow, and when he finally speaks, it’s a croak. “Am I dreaming? Tell me I’m gonna get a call in a second, and none of this will be real – “ he yelps as Tony digs his nails sharply into the tender flesh behind his ears.
Korkyra patted him on the head.  “Don’t pay attention to them, dear.  Nausikaa sees Steve as a replacement older brother she can pester, and anyone else nearby gets the backwash.  Now, tell us about yourself.”
“Just –“  he squeezed his eyes together  “God, Steve.”
Steve was less impressed by the corporate offices, but Tony could barely blame him. There was less innovation, more paper pushing, less respect of intelligence, more ass-kissing. When Tony introduced Steve as his new bodyguard, he just nodded mutely at whoever it was. Playing dumb, no one would believe that a man of Steve’s stature had more intelligence than a brick, but it was a smart move on Steve’s part.
His mouth is dry as he asks.  “Is she . . . is she here?”
Steve didn’t care.  He’d moved into the Tower, and taken up residence in that blackened crevice in his heart, the one that was clean and healthy for most people, maybe a little cluttered, but his was twisted and black and starved.
“He was doing his job.”
she laughed.
“Phase 2 is SHIELD used the cube to make weapons.
“I deserve that.”  A strange expression crosses Steve’s face.  It takes a moment for Tony to place it, because he’s never seen Steve so openly display the emotion before: guilt.  Empathy wells within Tony.  Not enough to give Steve a completely clean break, no, he deserves to be called out.  But Tony knows a thing or two about being harder on yourself than you will ever let any other person see.
Tony deflates slightly, but a spiteful, resentful spark still lurks in his mind. “I don’t need a reason.   I don’t know why it’s so bad tonight. But it just . . . is.”
That little rock on the edge of the ocean –“
He didn’t move.
“You’re not going back?”
Seeing it opened a chasm of wanting in Tony.  He’d spend his happiest hours in the smithy down the southern slopes of the acropolis, hauling water and begging for a chance to bang out even a small piece of metal that he would show his mother proudly by the end of the day.  His favorite had been a particularly burly smith, who no one even seemed to know by name, but still created amazing metalworks.  As he got older, Tony had wondered why the man hadn’t been taken to the frontlines.  But as soon as he’d asked, people looked at him like he was crazy, like the man didn’t exist.  But he had
His heart?  That twisted piece of burned metal?  Steve already has it, if he wanted it.
He doesn't cry.
Everyone waited a beat before dissolving into raucous laughter.  Tony was left to stare.  Fury continued munching on an onion like none of the rest existed.
“Nightfall.  Isn’t that usually when dinner is?  Now, I have a few things to tend to.  Namely, informing the gossipy old men why a well-dressed Athenian is here.  The others will be around to help you, if you need it.”  Steve strode back to the stairs, then stopped.  “Will you be alright?”
“No, she does.  But she also knows where you will sleep, and what dish you will eat from.  And she’s not a slave, nor a servant.  She won’t take kindly to you calling her anything of such.”
“Oh. That’s a mouthful.  What does it mean?”
“And allow me to introduce you to my island.  Nice to see you again, Fury.”
Steve swallowed several times, giving Tony a wonderful demonstration on how his throat worked, breathed deep, and sat up straight in time for the waitress to return with their drinks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I am Antinous,” Tony sighed, the epithet worn on his tongue, “Prince of Athens.  Son of Hoples, King of Athens, and Mardus of Zancle.  Of the House of Stheino, which comes from the bloodline of Theseus and Hermes, the giant-slayer.  I am the hero who vanquished the Serpent of Ten Rings, and return from my quest to slay –“ he held up the bag containing Vanko’s head and shook it slightly “- the Spartan Velkhanos who sought to bring about the ruin of my House.”
“Why’d it make you think of me?” he asks hoarsely, running a finger along the stem.
“You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.”
He paused.  “I don’t see you as my kid, Tony.”
Her eyes widened, looking completely shocked in a way Steve knew was totally fake.  “No, I’m speaking about our friend.  You two are best
“He got some stitches, but I don’t think that’s what you mean.  His mind is unaffected, thank you.  After he heals, he’ll be right back in the suit.  Probably before, too.”
Tony’s eyes were already drifting close.  “If you insist.  And we’ll get married tomorrow?  After sex?”
Steve raised his eyebrows.  “Aren’t you going to take in the view?”
“Now, Nephalion,” Steve scolded.  “Tony just arrived.  Let him settle in before you put him to work overhauling our waterworks.  We’re fine drawing directly from the source; we just wanted the fountain for convenience.  Besides, he said he’d need to see the setup first.”
“Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.  It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war.”
Steve straightened up.  “No.  I wanna finish looking at the exhibit, get ice cream, and show you something special.  In that order.”  He looked at Tony worriedly.  “Okay?”
.  How can I go to a medium-sized city that has a reputation for being twenty years behind everywhere else?  For a conference on innovation, of all things.”
in a mystified tone.
"So much more than okay."  He turned back, and found he couldn't breathe.
“What the hell did you do to me?”
“Shh,” Steve murmured into Tony’s lips, moving a practiced hand to where the lube was located.
Steve rolled his hips down one last time, insuring Tony’s cock pressed firmly along his prostate, pulling him deep,
“Do you want to . . . talk about it?”
Comments are little gifts from above.
Coulson was standing uncomfortably close.
have is the ability to breathe fire, chlorine gas, and the harmless tranquilizer Zoloto blasted him with on his first day in the mountains.  Which is awesome.  What would be more awesome is an explanation as to how, but he's just been teased that he might like to figure it out on his own.
He just has to wait, because not matter how long-winded, Tony would always get to a point eventually.  And there has always been something beautiful about Tony speaking about science, even if Steve doesn't always understand it.  Something about the light in his eyes.
“How will your friends have time for me when they’re so busy fight you?”
The producer pointed at him needlessly.  He smiled and waved at the piped in cheers, face pulled taunt, felling like a grimace.  His face took up a third of the plasma screen, right in the middle.  He usually insisted on being called Steve Rogers as opposed to Captain America, but America didn’t need to know how Steve Rogers felt about Tony Stark, just what Captain America felt about Iron Man.
, that’s why I never-“ Steve was sobbing in his neck.
Pepper swallowed.  “No.”
She frowned at her needle.  “He didn’t even seem the same man.  Rough, in his way, but courteous and gentle.  Respectful, if you can believe.  But he wasn’t drunk, for once.  That might have had something to do with it.  He was even worse afterwards, but I stopped caring after –“  She froze, eyes wide.  “Did I ever tell you what happened while I was expecting you?”
“Don’t let the baby Bartons bite.”
“That I did know.”
His phone buzzes and he picks it up blindly, still staring at the pictures of gutted carcasses.
She understands how people work.  He’s still learning.
He fled the room before he could throw his reservations out the window and crawl in anyway.
In Steve’s opinion, Tony sounded far too calm to be flying around, kicking strange flying lizards that were coming from a purple wormhole out of the air.
, but with someone who was more . . . genuine. But unfortunately, in the circles he ran in, the brilliant women he met had ulterior motives or weren’t interested, and the men didn’t usually go for other men. But that really didn’t matter anymore.
He’s man enough to admit when he’s jealous.
“No, Steve. I want you to say whatever it is I know you’re bursting to say.”
“The, uh, lesser ones.  Yeah.”
“Wonderful.  Are we headed anywhere?”
“You’re not going to ask about the price?”
*Gingerly places this here* Perhaps I have some issues . . . .
Which was terrible, really, because if it was anyone else they’d have already been rolling around in the unmade together.  But Steve was possibly one of the least-easy people he’d ever wanted to bed.  So might as well get what he could out of his system.
Shapanka was a genius, even if he was twisted. He’d come to Tony, blathering about immortality and cryogenics, but Tony had hired him to keep an eye on him and direct his genius towards different pursuits. Obviously it hadn’t worked.
“This?  Well, we were tired from training one day, and Nat decided we should go on a field trip.  Ever heard of Corning?”  Tony shook his head.  “They’ve got this glass museum.  We did this workshop, made glass candy canes.  Fun afternoon.  Before Wanda melted a few pieces.”
“But he wasn’t in actual
Tony scans the setup. They’re in a warehouse area.  Aside from the green-suited men taking fire from both the aerial and ground Avengers, and their mystery-blasters-of-the-week, he and Steve have Zemo to themselves.  The Baron himself stands on a platform with minimal equipment, a massive gun of some sort strapped to his side, with a reservoir full of a grayish liquid and large needle to administer it.
“The uniform?  Aren’t the stars and stripes a little . . . old fashioned?”
Bad train of thought.  Best think of something else.  Anything else.
He felt, for the first time since he had gained this body, like he was going to have an asthma attack.  “Break what?”
“I’m a spy, remember?”
“Yeah.  Takes us a while to get any traction, I’ll give you that one.  But let’s do a headcount here.  Your brother, the demigod.”  He slipped one of his bracelets on.  “The supersoldier, a living legend that

food.
“So they think.  He hasn’t proven it yet,” Barton supplied, and the girl smiled victoriously.  “Stark, can’t you figure out that it keeps out the bad guys when you spray it on the doors and windows?”
Except for the tension that was thrumming underneath Steve’s skin.  Being alone with Tony had never been a hardship before.  Before his realization, he had enjoyed that time immensely, the hours he had spent simply hanging out with Tony.  Sitting with Tony in his workshop, listening to Tony as he babbled about his inventions, bringing food to Tony so he didn’t starve.
THE ROOKWOOD TEA ROOM WAS AN ORIGINAL FEATURE OF CINCINNATI UNION TERMINAL WHEN THE BUILDING FIRST OPENED IN 1933.  IT WAS DISIGNED BY WILLIAM E. HENTSCHEL, A WELL-KNOW ARTIST AT ROOKWOOD POTTERY, AND FEATURES A TILE FLOOR, FLOOR TO CEILING TILE, AND TILED PARTITIONS.  COFFEE, TEA, AND LIGHT REFRESHMENTS WERE SERVED.  DURING WORLD WAR II, THE ROOM WAS USED BY USO VOLUNTEERS, WHO SERVED COFFEE, COOKIES, AND DONUTS TO GIS PASSING THROUGH THE TERMINAL.  AFTER THE WAR, THE ROOM SERVED AS A GAME ROOM.  IT BECAME AN ICE CREAM AND CHILI PARLOR IN 1980, AND IS STILL OPERATED AS AN ICE CREAM PARLOR TODAY.
“You need to drop the history books and pick up a decent psychology text.
“Uh, you would shoot someone over poppy pods?”
It was so easy to assume that Tony would have laughed at him and would have been venomous when he called Steve “old man”, but if anything, Tony had become his best friend.  Sure, Natasha was closest to Steve in physical age, or that Clint was “an acidic man-child with the maturity of a sloth” (or so Natasha said), or that Thor knew as much about the intricacies of modern culture as he did, or that Bruce understood being a science experiment.  But Natasha and Clint had never lived ordinary lives and their maturity levels were coping mechanisms, Thor was unfamiliar with the base culture, and Bruce hadn’t been left bereft of seventy years.
“Doesn’t look like it’s gonna be an easy fix.”
“’Impressive’?  Tony, it’s a masterpiece of Art Deco,” Steve lamented, gesturing up at the façade.  The front was massive, with two bas reliefs framing the sides of the humongous half-dome.  There was a pair of rectangular vertical bars supporting a large analogue clock in the center of the front.  Tony loved the accuracy of digital clocks, but he had to admit the strong aluminum lines backlit and accented with glowing neon were stunning.
blessed by the gods, but Steve has a very deep relationship with them.  When he asks, they tend to answer.  He knows the answers to questions we don’t know to ask.  He tries to teach us to pray like he does, but the only one who’s any good at it is Bruce, and he’s worked in temples before.  He wants you mentally prepared before the gates are opened.  Because there will no closing them again.”
