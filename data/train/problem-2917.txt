“Yeah, well I haven’t shown you the other ones yet,” Dean said, only half realizing what he’d just promised. He didn’t care to think too much about anything though, because it was hot and Cas was grinning and sweaty and he was just happy.
It was freeing, to be able to fuck into Cas as hard as he wanted, knowing Cas could take it. Knowing Cas loved it. But soon, too soon really, his breath was growing short and ragged and his dick was throbbing for release.
Things have been good. Real good. The snow would come and go, but Cas stayed. Every day, he took pictures with that stupid Polaroid camera Sam gave him; usually, pictures of Dean when Cas thought he wasn't looking. The lucky penny stayed firmly around the angel's neck, too. In fact, things have been so good, that Dean largely forgot that today it was Valentine's Day.
Half an hour later, Cas walked up to the Impala, a small bag slung over his shoulder. For a being who’d been alive for thousands of millennia, he really hadn’t picked up much stuff along the way. “All right. Chuck it in the trunk and let’s go.”
Cas propped his head up on an elbow and squinted. “It means I love you and you want me and I want you,” he answered in a gravelly tone.
Well, fair enough. Bully for Cas. God knows he hadn't always treated him well. Taking that in, thinking about how many times he'd been rough with Cas, who had
Cas laughed, like he knew exactly where Dean’s thoughts were going. “I think that says Dean Winchester and Castiel were here quite clearly, don’t you?” When Dean rocked against his back in response, Cas’ voice dropped and he said, “One last stop.” The world disappeared in a rush.
It was only later when Dean realized that Cas hadn’t said anything that could be answered with a ‘me too’. He bit his lip, silently cursing. Cas, though, Cas understood.
, glowing white where their hands touched. And it was like the bubble they were in, the bubble containing them inexorably joined together, started to expand. Wing shadows flashed black across Dean’s vision, stretching, stretching. And it was almost as though he could now feel the flowers as they shook gently, stirred by the sudden whisper of wind, as though he might as well be one of the drops of water hanging from the petals, in comparison to what Cas was. The air around them was shining, and Dean could feel Cas’ senses expanding, could feel
“Dean.” It’s Jack. He’s smiling, but a little more sadly now. Like someone who’s grown up, Dean thinks, his stomach turning. “You don’t need to apologize.”
Well, didn’t he just feel like the world’s biggest dick. Cas had seen so much blood, fought so many wars. After all of it, he was still fascinated by the idea of a butterfly. It was kind of amazing really. “I get it,” Dean muttered.
“They took my ability to kill using my grace. I’ll be less useful on hunts..” Dean shook his head, hoping to reassure Cas with the gesture. Cas continued. “My ability to hear angel radio, to time travel, a few other things. I can still fly, and heal, and hear prayers. Taking those would have been… I would no longer have had any claim to the title of angel. I can pass into Heaven, but only through Joshua’s Garden, and I can never return there permanently, with the other angels. I am forbidden for seeking direct contact with other angels, but not from returning it. If I interfere with their plans in any way, I will be put to death. If I transgress in any way…” Cas waved a hand. “That’s not of import. If I have to stop them doing something, it will be important enough the consequences won’t matter.”
They pulled up outside the closest dive bar messily, and the bike ground to a halt. Dean jumped off the motorbike, having forgotten there would be real people, and namely women, to see him practically advertising gay motorcycle riders. It was him and Cas, though, and that made it different. It was always different with them.
Just when Dean thought Cas was just going to leave the word hanging, the angel started up again. “I’m afraid you taught me how to feel, and in that, you taught me something beyond need. When you die… you’ll be in heaven. I wanted you to remember me, remember the things I wrote to you there. Irrespective of what happened after, closed off from blood and wars. Is that so much to ask for you, after everything?” It wasn’t a question Cas expected him to answer, Dean could tell that. “I will be alone, forever, wandering the earth. Observing its infinite beauty, its change; Dean, it’s full of miracles. I’m not
"I miss you," he said, scarcely realizing he'd spoken. He blinked. Cas remained still, like a rumpled soldier carved out of marble. "Fuck," he said as a tear slid down his nose. He hadn't cried for months and now, this? This day, like any other, was when he chose to lose it?
Cas frowned for a second, and then his face split into a smile. He cupped both sides of Dean’s face and kissed him long and hard. Dean panted when they split apart. “That was… that was…” he floundered for words. “Damnit, Cas,” he finally breathed out.
The ornament on the top of a tree wasn't really an ornament per say, it was more of a red spray painted wooden pentagram which Dean had found in a box labelled 'Demon Warding' in a box downstairs. There was so much they still hadn't discovered in the bunker, and Dean wanted to explore it all. The red spray paint had been added on to make it "festive," although probably to anyone other than a Winchester, it would've looked psychotic. They'd compiled various boxes of old, partially broken ornaments at the local thrift store. Some of them were quite disturbing, actually, like dusty china mice with pitchforks and threatening expressions. Dean wasn't sure what demented old lady had wanted those hung on her tree, but they put them up there anyway, if only to fill space. The rest of the space was filled with bottle caps, which Dean had learned to hang as Christmas ornaments through many years with John Winchester.
Cas smiled, and with a relative amount of grace carried Dean to the Impala and set him on the edge of the back seat. Dean scooted backwards, grabbing at Cas’ hands and pulling the angel with him. The music was louder in here, thrumming through his bones, and Dean glanced around the car fondly. “Made some pretty good memories in here, huh?” Dean said.
He ran one finger along the length of Cas’ erection, watching Cas’ hips tremble as he tried to keep still. He palmed Cas’ dick, keeping his hand perfectly still, applying just a touch of pressure while he ordered, “Shoot.”
That no flames were licking up the ceiling, swallowing someone he loved. He gripped Cas a little tighter. Somehow, just the idea that he was safe prompted him to think that even if somehow they weren’t safe, if he died now, it wouldn’t be so bad.
“All right,” Dean said, biting back a grin from Cas’ response. “I’m going to fuck you every way you can imagine.” Cas gulped. “But here’s the thing. You’re not allowed to cum until I say so.” One of Cas’ eyebrows lifted up. If they were two normal people, this’d be pretty kinky, Dean thought absentmindedly. But this was him and Cas, and Cas insisted he had utter control over himself. Something about that just made Dean want to make him lose control. “Shouldn’t be a problem since you have total control, right?” Dean breathed against Cas’ ear, nibbling at the lobe.
"I think you're right. I love Winchester Christmas." He spun Cas around and kissed him, barely questioning the stiffening of Cas' muscles as he was included in The Winchesters. In fact, Dean barely thought about it at all, not until later.
“But do you?” He desperately didn’t want Cas to say yes. But maybe the truth of it was that for an angel, a wavelength of celestial intent, nothing felt quite as intimate as the sort of thing Cas had described. It only stood to reason, that physical beings like humans would seek physical intimacy, but maybe for angels it was totally different. He tried to remind himself that Cas wasn’t exactly a regular angel.
Cas cried out beneath him, bringing him back to the present. “Dean,” he whispered over and over again. Dean growled, feeling the angel clench around him. He knew what that meant. He thrust into Cas harder, faster, letting the pleasure explode through him as they came together. He saw stars and angel wings on the back of his eyelids, every fibre of his being lost in Cas and crying out in ecstasy.
“Dean,” he said, like it was a prayer. “Yes. Oh.” Dean started to move, slowly at first. “Feels so good,” Cas gasped, and Dean decided he liked this, Cas breathless and gasping whatever words came to mind. Cas moaned as Dean brushed his prostate, and Dean rocked his hips so he was hitting it with shallow thrusts, never quite pulling out. “Oh yes, Dean, yes.” Cas’ cock was hardening between their stomachs, and he squeezed his fingers against his handprint. “Full, Dean. So… oh. Close to you. So fucking close to you,” Cas muttered. Dean ghosted his fingers along Cas’ length, making him shudder. “Make love to me,” he said in a low voice. “Harder.” Dean fucked into him harder, still never pulling out. They felt closer this way.
"Oh, Dean," The angel murmured, and started in on the buttons of Dean's shirt, sometimes missing them altogether in inebriated haste.
The spit isn’t enough: he wants to glide into Dean seamlessly. Like he belongs. He conjures lube on his fingers and circles them against Dean’s pucker while he licks up the base of Dean’s cock. Dean shudders, rocking forward and back between Cas’ hand and his mouth.
“Dean,” he replies, voice low. The confinement of his jeans is night on unbearable, but the denim seam running against his cock feels somehow bad and good at the same time.
Cas looked at him, some unpleasant emotion simmering in his eyes. Dean expected Cas to hit him, any minute now. Because Dean was wrong. Of course things have changed. But hunting had seemed like it worked – like they didn’t need to readjust everything when it came to that. And he’d been glad about that, because hunting was just about the only thing that had stayed constant his entire life.
The hallway was satisfyingly silent, and when he poked his head into the library, he found a note taped to the table. “Back in 2 days. Don’t die.” And then a scrawl which Dean supposed was meant to be Sam’s name. Dean grinned. “See, Sammy?” He muttered.
“Dean,” Cas’ voice came from behind him. The angel’s arm was wrapped around Dean’s sudsy stomach, drawing circles in the bubbles there. The angel rocked against Dean’s ass, and Dean gasped as he felt Cas’ erection there. “I want you.”
“All right then.” Dean stood, offering Cas a hand up. Once he’d pulled Cas to his feet, he coughed. Cas was staring at him with his head cocked to one side, hand still clasped in Dean’s. Dean laughed lightly before extracting his hand from the angel’s grip. Cas probably wasn’t familiar with being helped up or something. “What say we get you inside, huh?” Dean asked, absent mindedly picking leaves out of Cas’ hair. He ran a thumb along Cas’ cheekbone, erasing the tear that had sat there a moment before. “Come on,” he said suddenly. Cas followed him down the hill slowly.
Maybe if Cas had had a little more beginner’s luck playing guitar, and Dean hadn’t zoned out into his own thoughts of Cas, the hunter might have made out the garbled strains of Buffalo Springfield’s Sit Down, I Think I Love You. Cas didn’t, though, and Dean had. He was thinking about Free Bird. He’d listened to it so many mornings, pulling away from a sleazy motel, cold air caressing the hot red hickeys on his neck. Another girl who’s name he’d never known in the first place left behind. The song should make him sad, by all rights, if it made him feel anything. Riding in the Impala with Cas, knowing that Sammy was safe and they could go anywhere they wanted; it made him feel the song harder than he had before. Dean Winchester couldn’t change. He’d always be stuck in the hunting life, slightly bruised, protecting his brother and with his angel by his side. If Dean had been fully awake, he would have been kicking himself for all the cheesy chickflick crap his brain was throwing out. As it was, he was mostly good with this life.
"I have been in your car at night before." Dean wasn't sure Cas realized just how dodgy that really sounded.
Cas nodded. “One minute,” and he ducked into their room to get something. Dean watched him go, the last chorus of the Byrds’ song echoing through his head, and a smile spread across his face.
I took his hand and squeezed it. It was a warm, late summer afternoon, and I lost myself in the sunset. I didn't know how to help him. I thought once I was fully human, fully fallen, I would know. I was wrong.
I started to move, thrusting in and out of him in smooth, deep slides. We were lost in pleasure, forgetting everything but the here and the now. "Beautiful, Dean," I said quietly. He groaned, and I knew I had found that secret spot inside him again. I thrust into him harder, gasping at the hot bliss that graced my being. He held onto me tightly, panting into the curve of my neck.
Dean let out a puff of air. That was something to take in. “What the hell,” he kissed Cas on the top of the head. And if Cas happened to see that recurring dream, the one where they ran away to Vegas and got married while Can’t Help Falling In Love With You  played… well. That was that.
“You think I’m being foolish.” Dean didn’t say anything. Cas tilted his head and swallowed, eyes still firmly fixed on the encased butterfly in his hands. “It was alive. A long time ago. And now it’s dead. And… I don’t know what I think about that.”
“Yeah. And you, and Sam, and… uh, my Baby.” He grinned stupidly. “I’m good how I am. And this is a damn fine song, so I’m alright with it being my accidental anthem. Mostly.”
die, mixed together with a glorious coping of his heart aching and that strange wonder he’d felt when he saw Cas’ wings for the first time. He manages to growl out, “Just take another piece of my heart, why don’t you?”
Cas moaned in response, grinding against Dean. Dean closed his eyes. God, he needed these jeans off. As if he’d read his mind, Cas reached down and unbuckled his belt. Fuck, was he using his teeth on the zipper? Angels learn fast. Dean groaned as Cas pulled down his jeans and boxers, finally cold air instead of rough fabric around his dick. Cas shoved him back towards the wall, and Dean blinked. He opened his mouth to say something, but Cas shut him up with a kiss and a hand grasped around his hot, aching cock.
He thrust inside Cas, and he was fucking Cas harder than he ever had before, as hard as he could. Cas’ hips rolled with him, taking each thrust. The angel’s hands came up from the bedsheets and he clung onto Dean for dear life, crying out as Dean struck his prostate.
“All right. First thing’s first,” Dean said the next morning. “The most important thing about being human is music.” Dean scraped his omelet out of the pan. He’d slept fitfully, his waking periods plagued by the fact that he was pretty sure he could hear footsteps on the roof above him. He smiled though, despite the bags under his eyes. The burnt eggy mess on his plate was just evidence of how distracted his was. Nomally, he was the Martha Stewart of the hunting world. Which was not a sentence he’d ever imagined applying to him.
There were a few moments of silence before Cas materialized in front of him. “Dean,” he said almost laughing.
It felt like he’d confessed something just then, like he’d laid everything bare and opened himself up to a world of hurt far beyond the words ‘I’m cold’ implied.
Guilt hit him like a slap across the face, but he shoved it down before he bothers to ask where it came from. “Get outta my face, Cas.” He said. Anything to just forget this.
Dean crumples up the piece of paper, scrawls, ‘so it goes’ a la Vonnegut on its raggedy surface, and tosses it in the bin.
Dean fell to his knees in front of Cas and cupped his hands fiercely on either side of the angel’s face, because
Dean’s eyes rove up Cas’ body, drinking him in, and it’s Cas that has to delicately pull his cock from Dean’s mouth. A pearly string connects the two: Dean leans forward to kiss the tip of Cas’ dick and clean him off. If he wasn’t lying down, Cas’ knees would give out.
He felt Cas’ eyes burning into the nape of his neck, but remained stubbornly with his back to Cas. Instead, he turned up the cassette player as far as it would go. Ac/Dc. He reached for a shotglass and filled it sloppily before downing it. As the burn in his throat subsides, he contemplates exactly how they got here. It’s not really his fault, he tries to tell himself. Cas still isn’t being totally honest, he
The pancakes were burnt, and Cas seemed to have put more blueberries than flour into the batter, but they were
It was about a week later, and Dean realized dimly while Cas was throwing a lighter down on a pile of gasoline-soaked bones, a furrow appearing on his brow while he watched the fire spread, that spring was in full swing. And he’d barely even noticed.
“Dean?” Cas asked, the one coherent thing he said since Dean started touching him. Cas could tell that Dean was getting close, and he wanted to know if he could come with the man.
“That’s an odd way to kiss,” he said, cocking his head to one side. “It felt like falling,” he added, caught up in his own thoughts.
Cas hummed at the correction. He ran his fingers over Dean’s collarbone, pushing the edges of his shirt away. “Dean,” he whispered into Dean’s skin, the feeling sending butterflies fluttering through his skin. “This has been a most enlightening experience.”
“I don’t want to go.” Cas grimaced, unclasping his hands. In an instant, they went from shaking to steady. “But Dean, I’m deadweight here.”
When he awoke, it was dark outside, and he shivered something awful. “Fuck,” he whimpered, when had it got so goddamn cold? The only source of heat in the room were fingers, stroking the side of his face and playing idly through his hair, little licks of lifegiving fire. Dean blindly pushed his head up into the warmth. “Cas?” he croaked.
He hasn’t said anything out of the ordinary in the message, but something about it drains him. Unexpectedly, he wishes someone was there to hold him. It’s okay. He’s read all the books, after all: he knows the road to healing is rarely smooth or straight. He returns to heaven, to a secluded glade. It looks a lot like the place Dean crawled out of his grave after Castiel resurrected him. The sun beats down into the centre of it, and with a flick of his fingers, Cas is naked except for his trenchcoat. Sunbathing. He’d caught Amara at it once, by a lush hot spring.
Cas' head rested on Dean's chest. Dean couldn't help thinking, as Cas stroked the bare skin the scoop of his shirt neck exposed, that while Cas was listening, he was a great deal more interested in listening to Dean's heart beat and admiring how well his head fit in the hollow of the hunter's chest. Dean wasn't wrong. He pressed a kiss into the angel's hair.
Dean’s lips formed one of those smiles often made when one is happier than one’s ever been, but being torn apart at the same time. “Me too, buddy. Me too.”
“Yes,” Cas grunted, and Dean wasn’t sure whether it was an answer to what he’d said or an exclamation. They made love deep and slow, sweat running down Dean’s neck as he trembled, trembled at the waves of sensation the heady slide of Cas’ cock into him cause, and Cas held him tight. They came at the same time, Cas’ erection pulsing inside of Dean, filling him with hot cum, and Dean groaned, bucking his hips wildly, pleasure flying through him.
Dean let a single, light laugh fall from his lips. After all of Cas’ millennia on earth, what gave him a sense of purpose was a charred skeleton? Cas smiled slightly at Dean’s laugh, and continued.  “I was wrong to seek it from only one source – to try and adopt the garrison’s ideas, to find my own, singular, misguided mission, even to try and derive happiness solely from human means.” Dean tried not to wince. Seemingly sensing that, Cas said, “I mean to say that it was a marriage of your ways and heaven’s that prompted me to find my own. And it’s not simple, like I thought it would be, it’s a swirl of fighting for what’s right, free will, determination, hedonism, embracing what I am, expanding…” he cocked his head to one side and said fondly, finally, “Love.”
"I was kinda hopin' you come find me, actually," Dean said. "C'mere," he said, softer now, his breath catching a little at the sight of Cas. The marks all along his chest and neck were fading now, but his nipples were pink and clamoring for Dean's attention.
“Dean, why are the pumpkins on fire?” Cas asked idly. His head was propped up on his fist, elbow resting on the open window.
“Do you know how to dance?” Dean asked suddenly. It’d been a long time. Since he was sixteen, actually. That girl at the boy’s home – his first kiss – had shown him how to dance, awkwardly shepherding him around the room until they got it right. He hadn’t danced much since then. It didn’t fit with his leather jacket vibe, nor did he have occasion very often. Maybe today.
"We're all out of books," Dean said. Then, "This'd be a lot easier if you'd just wake up, you know." He waited. The door upstairs slammed and the Impala's engine started up. Baby felt more like Sam's car these days than his. He sighed. Alone in this giant bunker with a Cas whose breathing was still too shallow. "Screw you," he said suddenly. "Screw you for throwing yourself in front of every damn bus you could. Y'know, if you hadn't stuck your neck out for me in the first place, you wouldn't be here. I mean, come on. Rebelling. Cracking open Purgatory. Staying there. Taking on Sam's hallucinations. Trusting Metatron. Trying to fight an angel war. Saying..." he took a breath to steady himself. "Saying yes to Lucifer. I know I said it was the right thing - but I..." He ran a hand over his mouth. "I wish you hadn't."
Cas didn’t say thank you. He knew better than that. They walked slowly down the street to the nearest motel. They got weird looks when they checked in, and there was the familiar mutter of,
Dean spits out his coffee. It burns at his navel. Cas heals him, but his ears are still ringing. “Hundreds?” He squeaks.
Dean is lost on pleasure, rocking back to meet Cas' thrusts. Cas fucks deep into him, so deep it feels like Cas is in the core of his being. Cas reaches between them and grabs Dean's throbbing cock, stroking him so hard it almost hurts. Dean wraps his arms around Cas, drawing him ever closer. No matter how rough this is, there's something gentle in it too, something in Cas' eyes and the idle circles Dean's fingers trace, trembling, on Cas' shoulders.
Cas’ eyes flickered over Dean’s bare chest, and when they met his own, the angel’s expression was mild. “I don’t see why not.”
Cas swayed slightly against him, hands coming to grasp at Dean’s wrists, holding him tightly. Which was just as well, because Dean felt like he might fall down at the touch of a feather. “You know, I’m aware this won’t be easy.” Cas said. “Things rarely are.”
“Uh,” Dean stammered intelligently. It was dark in the room – Cas hadn’t bothered to turn on the light – and so he couldn’t even
A furrow appeared in Dean’s brow. “They want you as like, a rogue hunter or something? After they took away your ability to kill using your mojo? Are you sure you… I mean, signing up for thousands upon thousands of years of
Dean looked around, and slowly his surroundings started appear. Were they… in a greenhouse? Yeah. That’s exactly where they were. And a giant one at that. Plants grew wild across it, looking like they’d been left there for at least twenty years. Lilies were floating on what had once been a well landscaped pond, pale pink blooms against the dusky static of night. A variety of ivy he’d never seen before clung to most surfaces, and the smell of flowers and earth hung heavy in the air. “Where are we?”
Cas' eyes - Christ, they were so deep, their glimmers like sparks in the ocean blue, he'd almost forgotten they looked like this - flickered with something sad. "Pain," he said. "Freely given." And Dean thought of begging, praying, offering everything he had one last time. That fit the bill, he supposed.
Dean woke up all at once, sleep vanishing in the blink of an eye. He didn’t jerk awake, or sit up, though. He stayed still, the leather of the Impala’s seats pressing against his back, Cas’ bare chest rising and falling against his own. The snow had mostly let up, but a few solitary flakes drifted down. Dean closed his eyes. It wasn’t often he felt like this. Peaceful.
He would leave in an hour's time, I knew. Prepare for the dawn. I stared at the broken guitar in the corner, and thought perhaps it was true. And I fell asleep to his heartbeat, for the last time.
When Cas started to jerk with oversensitivity and pulled out, Dean swallowed without hesitation, just to see the look on Cas’ face. The angel sank to his knees and pulled Dean toward him roughly. “How do you want to come, Dean?” he asked breathlessly, wrapping his fingers around Dean’s dick, like they belonged there.
Dean felt cold air meet his back and then Cas’ wings wrapped around him, holding him up so strongly and securely he almost felt like he was pinned down. Cas rocked his hips a little, finding a new angle and it took Dean a moment to realize they were fucking
Cas laughed, to Sam’s surprise. He’d been expecting an eye squint. “No, seriously, I mean it.” Sam clapped a hand to Cas’ shoulder and climbed into the back seat. If Dean was aware of their exchange, he didn’t show it. Sam had to admit it felt weird to be sitting back here. He hadn’t sat in the back seat since John had owned the Impala. But he wanted to show Cas that he was… important, y’know. Part of the family and not just back seat material. Plus, Sam had a feeling Cas ought to get used to riding shotgun.
Cas shoves a third finger inside Dean, and this time, the stretch feels good. His hole is getting slick, and he buries his face in the pillow to muffle the needy little phrases that pour from between his lips. Cas seems to notice, reaches out, and tilts Dean's chin up. Dean looks back at him, and the first word that escapes is, "Please."
Cas suddenly stiffened next to him. Dean raised his eyebrows. "You OK there?" He asked after a pause.
“I dreamt when I was human. It was interesting.” Cas offered. The silence continued for a few seconds. “Dean, for this to work, our minds and souls would have to… meld, I suppose. It’d be temporary, of course. But this isn’t a light spell.” Dean barely noticed Cas inspecting his fingernails in a little too much detail. This was by far the worst idea he’d ever had. Opening up his mind to Cas, right after he’d finally admitted he loved the guy but before he knew what to do about it? Yeah, crappy plan.
“Some day, I’m gonna teach you how to make a damn bed,” Dean said, just to break the awful, sickly sentimental silence.
almost against his will as he took hold of Cas' hand. Cas finger twitched, just the slightest thing, but it made Dean's heart skip a beat, hope soaring through him like a falling flame. Dean let out a breath and laced their fingers together, squeezing once. Waiting for Cas to return the touch.
Dean’s eyes widened, staring into Cas’, oceans of blue that seemed to drag between them as he utterly failed to comprehend what the angel had just said.
“I… trust I’m doing this correctly,” Cas said. A pause. “I’ve been thinking about it for a while. About how, it seems almost laughable, to be bonded together as we are, grace and soul, and this final, mortal custom dictates that we’re apart. And how I want to be bonded with you in every conceivable way. I also thought about how it seemed, as traditions go, a beautiful one, even if it did have its origins in considering women as property…” Cas trailed off, and then steeled himself. “And I believe this is the part where I ask you to marry me.”
“I fucking love you,” Dean cut him short and once again closed the distance between them, seeking the cool, full press of Cas’ lips. Cas gave in easily and sighed, winding his fingers through Dean’s hair.
Cas smiled at him like he’d just done something stupid but incredibly endearing. “Oh, Dean,” he whispered. Talking in their normal voices would have seemed wrong. Something holy had happened in this room, and they were in awe. Not holy like God, or Church, or the Bible, no, something sacred between them, like trust or love or rapture.
Instead, he undid Cas’ belt, sliding the angel’s jeans down and throwing them in a heap in the front seat. Cas’ boxers followed, until he could see all of Castiel, spread out before him, from the stupidly ruffled hair to his erect cock. Dean swallowed. He’d never done this before, but that was Cas, and that made it… profound, he guessed.
he raged silently. There could be a thousand reasons Cas had left. Seriously. Maybe he wasn’t even gone. Maybe he was outside, or was locked in some room somewhere, reading. He hadn’t even looked. Maybe Cas just went out, or got bored of watching Dean sleep – that was perfectly possible, right? Maybe he was off somewhere, watching the bees.
begged his fingers as they scrabbled for purchase, for something solid to hang onto, to prove it was real.
“No,” Cas rasped. “I – kiss me.” Dean obliged with wet, hot, biting kisses, one hand still skimming along Cas’ feathers. He jacked Cas faster, loving the way the angel’s cries filled the tiny space between them before Dean swallowed them with a kiss.
“Then I finally found you. You were on the shore of this lake – not the one we went to, one with white stones and a pine forest. I was late, but you were still waiting for me.” Cas trailed off.
he wanted to say. “What, Dean didn’t teach you about Christmas? What happened to ‘human stuff’? Or was that just code for sex?”
“Come on.” He dragged Cas up by the arm, only to have the angel snap his fingers. Dean looked around frowning. His cassette tape collection and player were sitting right in front of the window.
It was a few days after that, after a day of brutal training and practice to help Dean regain his former strength. (Sam would be back from a case in a few days and Dean didn’t want him to notice anything amiss.) Dean was ready to collapse into bed, muscles aching everywhere, when he heard footsteps at his door.
the dirtiest thing he’d ever done, because Cas tasted like roses and bitterness and Dean’s own cum. From one look at Cas’ face, pressed sideways against the pillow, he was in heaven.
"Don't you know I can't live without you? I need you, Cas. I never thought you could...feel those feelings for anyone. Not until you were gone. And then I knew I'd been feeling the same way for years, years and I never –" Dean stopped short, seeing Cas flinch at the regret in his voice. "Listen. I'm not good with words. And I've done wrong to you sometimes, I know it. But you changed me. You've been saving me, all these years, watching over me. And if you’ll come home, one last time, I want to spend the rest of my life proving to you that you can have what you want. That I love you."
“In the library Metatron hid my grace in,” Cas said nonchalantly, holding the thin green volume up to Dean’s eyes. He only had time to read the word
Cas craned his neck to see inside the box, and Sam continued. “Dean, this is Mom’s wedding ring, isn’t it? I didn’t even know you had this.” Cas frowned. Dean really hoped Sam wasn’t going to enlighten him on how exactly they might be putting a wedding ring to use. Marriage was probably just a weird human custom to him, anyway, or else something absurdly sacred.
Dean’s vision whited out and he had the briefest sensation of flying, before he came to, standing in a deserted library. “Uh, Cas?”
Chuckling at Cas’ metaphysical confusion with twiddling his thumbs, Dean picked out his only Grateful Dead cassette. “Where are we going?” Cas asked suddenly.
Dean was still thinking over Cas’ response when he looked over and laughed. “They do it when they’re bored.”
Cas laughed a little, and Dean tentatively stroked his wing again. Cas whimpered into his shoulder. “
Later, Cas asked if he could have the cassette, which had a few other songs dubbed onto it. Dean pressed it into his hand wordlessly and Cas slipped it into the pocket of his trench coat. Dean knew they were just like one of Bobby’s old trucks, lovingly repaired but poised to break down at the drop of a hat. For now though, they were driving steady, and it was all right.
"Hunt went good. See? Not a scratch. I'm gonna grab a beer and veg out," Sam said at the door. 'Veg out' was Sam-speak for read a 900 page book on monster-lore. Dean nodded, glad his brother hadn't tried to pry him out of his chair. "Try talking to him," Sam said softly. By the time Dean looked around, Sam was gone from the doorway.
There was a flash of light, and Dean wondered if he ought to have closed his eyes, but when he looked up at Cas, where he lay propped against too many pillows, dark gray wings spread out from his shoulders. Dean’s mouth fell open. They were beautiful. Cas stared straight at him, blue eyes blazing with the fire of heaven, tempered with trust. Dean thought he might break like glass under that look.
I kissed him back slowly, calmly. If this was what he needed, I would give it. He had been there, taught me how to be human, sat with me when I broke my foot. We were all we had left now.
Dean walked into the library to wait. Sam was sitting at the table, nose buried in a book, looking like a puppy that got kicked. Dean frowned, and sat on the edge of the table by him. “You look like shit,” he supplied helpfully.
Sam held aloft a glowing metal pyramid, eyes nearly crossed from the effort of casting. It was beginning to liquify.
Sam smiled. “You really gotta thank Cas for that one.” Cas materialized on the arm of the sofa, nearly making Sam jump out of his skin. Dean smirked. “Anyway,” Sam coughed, “He just showed up on the ship and said you’d mope all day if I didn’t come home.”
After about half an hour of fishing, Sam catching one but letting it go when he saw that it was some endangered species, Dean two beers down and many more to go, Cas stopped counting pebbles and stood. “I thought I might swim,” he said, gaze flickering over Dean briefly.
“I like it,” Dean says, leaning forward to give his forehead a kiss. “Who else can I show a movie to four times and still explain the references to.”
Cas' tongue dips inside him, circling curiously, and Dean shivers. He starts shaking with every thrust of Cas' tongue and inbetween wondering how the fuck Cas knows how to this and biting his lip to try and keep his moans in, he realizes that he is still shaking. Hasn't stopped shaking. Can't make himself. Doesn't really want to.
Somewhere in the afternoon, Dean built a fire in the frankly oversized fire-place, and they sat in front of it and watched it blaze. Sam and Dean traded anecdotes, with Cas occasionally chipping in what he could. The life of a divine soldier wasn’t particularly festive.
“So,” Sam said after a good five minutes of silence. It wasn’t heavy silence, exactly, but it felt that way to Dean.
“You go on roadtrips with Sam. He was the one who quite indelicately informed me what you did at bars.” Cas’ words were hard, almost a challenge.
Cas moaned with utter abandon, and they fucked as hard and fast as they could. It would’ve hurt if Cas wasn’t so wet and ready for release, and finally he came hard, the cold tiles against his back, Dean’s cock utterly filling him and sliding inside him, Dean’s hand giving him what he wanted, and hot water sliding over their bodies. It was beautiful, and he couldn’t hold back anything, not the embers of glowing light in his eyes, not the cries of “I love you.” Dean held him, come spurting between their chests in thick ropes, and watched his lover cry out for him.
Cas was inside him. This was the realization Dean couldn’t quite come to terms with or dispel as Cas fucked him, and so it lingered, playing over and over again. Cas reached around with his other hand, and started stroking Dean’s cock. Dean groaned. He could already feel the pleasure building in his stomach, but he didn’t want this to end. Cas was fucking him hard and fast, and each thrust struck just the right spot. His fingers twisted in the sheets. He wished he could touch Cas, but this was almost better, Cas touching him in every way possible. He gasped when he felt sharp teeth and a hot, wet tongue across his shoulder. “Oh, angel,” he moaned sinfully. Skin slapped on skin, and Dean’s hole was wet and slick, and Cas was so deep inside him.
they were, how they were closer than they'd ever been and it was all wrong because Cas was bleeding, red on his white shirt.
Cas awkwardly assuages him. “It’s my understanding that humans have multiple homes during different phases of their life. And that transitions are typically painful.”
“Yes. We are still hunting, correct?” Cas raised a solitary eyebrow and Dean turned back to the wheel.
Funny. They’d been through hell, literally. Blood and fighting and just general horrible stuff that’d drive anyone stark raving mad. And here they were, watching a horror movie. An angel and a human. Dean laughed softly in the dark, before knocking back a shot of whiskey.
Dean strode forward to meet the angel, cupped his face in both hands and crushed their lips together. Somehow their afternoon of separation felt, in that moment, like years. The press of their bodies together was sweet as Cas wrapped his arms around Dean’s shoulders and pulled him closer. A flash of blue out of the corner of his half-closed eyes notified Dean that Cas was wearing the leather jacket Dean had given him. “Hey, Cas,” Dean murmured, pulling away slightly to stroke Cas’ cheek.
permanent about this place.” Cas reaches down, and strokes his thumb along the petal of a dark red rose. “Nothing,” he repeated. “And that says… well, I don’t know. Perhaps the most wonderful things are transient.” Cas finished, his eyes a little misty.
"Hello, Dean," I said, and an inexplicable surge of happiness flooded through me at that simple phrase. That after everything, I was permitted to say it. That he had called me.
Scarcely a second went by, and they were standing in the middle of what appeared to be a rose garden. Indeed, the sign by the gate confirmed it – Berkeley Rose Gardens. The light was nearly blinding after the dark library, and Dean squinted. By the time his eyes adjusted, Cas was already walking through the rows of roses, grinning at each one like it was an old friend. “I came here after I took on Sam’s madness,” Cas called over his shoulder, and Dean strode to catch up with him. “It was spring then, so there were more roses. There are still a few,” he added contemplatively. “I sat here, for days. Nights. People probably thought I was homeless. The people came and went, and the petals dropped off, and in a way, I think I was determined to be the one constant thing about this place. Even the concrete under our feet is being worn away.” Dean glanced down. “But eventually, I left too. I sought other flowers, other places. I went back to Meg, occasionally, and to you when you called. There’s
Cas stilled. “Yes. How did you know?” Neither of them dared move for a moment, until Dean sank down onto the bed next to Cas.
Dean was confused for a moment, before he caught Cas’ drift. Clapping the squinting angel on the back, he climbed into the driver’s seat. “You just don’t. K?”
“Maybe I don’t deserve that,” Cas contemplated, staring into his palm. “Maybe I need to atone for the things I did, in heaven and on earth.” The words came falling out, bitterness spilling across them. “Maybe I ought to stop being so caught up worrying about whether I’m some angel freak of nature and moping in your living room all day, and go out and do something
“Damnit. This is different. I, uh, we’re different. I thought you knew that.” Dean stared at his hands.
Without a word of explanation, he walked across the room, clapped a hand to Dean’s shoulder, and promptly collapsed on the sofa. He gave a cursory grimace to the orange blanket.
So I looked over at him, and I think he saw the storm gathering in my eyes. I leaned closer. Our lips collided, and I pulled him to me, pinning him up against the house walls. He moaned into our kissing, and I licked my way hungrily into his mouth. It felt good, to use this muscle and flesh and bone which was made for fighting wars to love him. We were soldiers, but in that moment, we were only fighting for air.
Dean pulled Cas to him, and kissed him roughly. Too many words. Everything was too much. Dean turned so their torsos were pressed together, and Cas drew the hunter into his lap. They kiss hotly, teeth occasionally connecting. After all the things that have been said, Dean wanted to make everything but the present go away. Everything but the here and the now, him and Cas. It wasn’t long before they’re hard and rocking against one another. Dean didn’t question it when Cas snapped his fingers and the music turned off, leaving a pregnant silence.
“We’re going on a roadtrip,” Dean announced. “Just the two of us.” That was probably a bit obvious, but Cas didn’t point it out. “We’re gonna hook up with Sam on the other end. He thinks he’s gonna get on a flight back, but we’re gonna beat him to it and drive back. It’s not a long drive. Two or three states. But I thought it’d be… I dunno…” he stumbled. “Fun? Show you some of America, y’know.” Dean waited impatiently for Cas’ response. The angel looked to be mulling it over.
Dean spun around, blood rushing to his cock just from Cas’ words, and pinned Cas back against the shower tiles. He glanced around. There was nothing in the shower stall which could even possibly be used for lube, apart from the conditioner. He bit his lip, but Cas just snapped his fingers and the familiar bottle of lube appeared. Dean grinned. “You really gotta show me more of your angel mojo sometime. I bet it has,” he lowered his voice, hunkering in close, “All kinds of uses.” Cas raised a single eyebrow as he opened the lube bottle, pouring some on his own fingers. Dean’s eyes widened as he watched Cas reach his hand behind himself and start to open himself up. Dean sank down to his knees and licked up Cas’ length. Cas breathed raggedly, trying to stay focused as Dean teased him. He was nearly coming by the time he yanked his fingers away and shoved Dean away. Dean grinned as Cas said his name in a rush, a hard, desperate edge to the word. “Dean.” Dean spun him around so Cas’ palms were on the tile and spread the angel’s ass cheeks before pushing into hot, wet, oblivion. The water from the shower pounded on his back as he started to thrust into Cas. Cas cried out, canting his hips back to meet Dean’s thrusts, fingers scrabbling at the tile for purchase. Dean put his palms over the back of Cas’ hands so their fingers half intertwined, and it took only three well-placed thrusts before Cas was practically shouting with pleasure, dick spattering cum into constellations on the shower wall and on Cas’ stomach. Dean grinned as he worked Cas through it, watching as the angel’s body started to jerk from overstimulation.
The world went bright white, and Dean was soaring, soaring, like he was the one with wings. It was beautiful, and he cried out in rapture.
Dean nodded slowly, trying to wrap his head around it. “And what, I’m not on the invite list for your monster hunt?”
mixing together and spinning when their bodies stayed so nearly still. He couldn’t hear Cas’ thoughts, but he could feel Cas’ wonder, his pleasure at this, all throughout him. And it
They had sex for hours, until they were both panting, trembling messes and then twice more after that.
Cas melted against him. Dean loved the simple effect his touch had on the angel. "Mm. Aren't they readily available at... department stores?" Cas asked, like a department store could just as well be some distant jungle.
“By all means.” Dean turned over on his back, watching the sky. He decided, privately, that roses weren’t so bad. At least they had thorns. And daisies… well, if that claimed him a spot on Cas’ skin, he’d take it. But this was a conversation strictly between drunk-him and his brain, which was never to be repeated to sober-him.
“I’m not going to let you come until you’ve hit the target dead-center while your cock’s down my throat,” Dean said in a matter-of-fact voice. He was rather surprised by how easily the words came, given that he’d had no conscious plan of the sort before this moment and that he’d never really done dirty talk with Cas.
"Don't you think Winchester Christmas is a little... dingy?" He asked, pressing a kiss to the back of Cas' neck. Internally, though, he was berating himself. He was meant to teach Cas about human shit, and Christmas was meant to have lights.
“Dean?” Cas asked, and there was an edge to his voice, like he knew Dean wasn’t telling him something.
Dean gasped when Cas’ finger, wet with miraculously appearing lube circles his entrance. It was cold against his hot skin, and he keened as Cas thrust it inside. He’s filled with the sudden desire for Cas to be inside him, deep inside him, like Cas had said in the garden. “Cas,” he whispered.
“You said it last, it doesn’t count.” This game sounded a lot more complicated than the name let on. “All right,” Sam said, “You go over there and close your eyes. Count to 100 and then shout, ‘I’m coming, ready or not.’” Dean completely failed to restrain his laugh at the innuendo. Sam sighed. “Then you come and find me and Cas. If you give up, you shout Ollyollyoxenfree.” Was it just him, or was Sam actually
Dean found himself rolling in a wave of thought which was rather inescapable. It started with Castiel rescuing him from hell, had Cas rebelling
Dean sighed. He’d more or less expected this response. Cas would thank him in the morning. “Well,” he said taking a shot of god knows what, “You’re pretty hot, there are lots of single ladies, it’s not that hard. I mean,” he said, washing whatever gross concoction he’d just drank down with a whiskey, “You can probably just stare real hard at them and see if they kiss you.”
My trenchcoat was burnt to a cinder by a grenade in a Croat raid gone wrong. After that, I sat on the edge of his bed.
He blinked, once, and then leaned in and gently sniffed my neck. I heard his voice crack as he said, "Yeah, Cas. You smell like flowers."
“But yes. You know, he actually tried to give me a talk once, about a gay preacher he knew who’d escaped from a fundamentalist religious cult. I didn’t really understand what he was getting at: quite a lot of the angels were ruthlessly pansexual. But he’s going to be accepting.”
It wasn't like I hadn't said it before. But this time, it seemed to really sink in, and he didn't look like he liked the implications much. "Yeah," he said. "And look what I did to you."
His eyes went wide for a moment before his fingers resumed their flurry of activity on Cas’ shirt. He let out a shaky breath as Cas let him guide it off the angel’s arms, until it fell to the ground and Cas was left standing in only his jeans, leaning against the Impala. Fuck, he was acting like a girl on their first time. Cas reached out for the hem of Dean’s t-shirt, and Dean raised his arms, letting Cas take his shirt off.
It was close, so close to when it all fell down, when I came to him. I didn't intend to hand him a 'ransom note', as he put it. I didn't mean to drive Crowley's point home. I came to beg him for the trust I deserved. It broke me, standing there in the moonlight of Bobby Singer's living room, that he didn't trust me, after everything. Of course, I was wrong, and should have listened. That's beside the point. I thought, when I shattered, it must have been so apparent it was written all over my face. He was so lost in his own anger and misery he didn't notice. How had we gotten here, I asked myself? I knew, and it was a treacherous road I still couldn't believe led here.
Dean didn’t say anything, just held Castiel even tighter. Maybe later he’d worry about the right thing to say, or what this meant – but then he knew exactly what this meant – or about finding their clothes, or about the seat upholstery, or about the blizzard outside, but he wouldn’t think about it just now. For just now, they’d said all there was to say. The light, which played over them so gently, had turned blue. It was cold outside, but they were warm, pressed together like nothing existed either after today or outside the car.
"Right, but I... I was wrong." My breath caught in my throat. "You're not broken, Cas. Just human. And a little insane, to choose me over everything."
Dean leaned in to kiss him again, but Cas turned away and growled, “You’re going to freeze to death.”
Dean didn’t have time to think through drunken nicknames and kisses that still clung to his hair. Which, for the record, he was glad about. They were working a case, and that was probably the only thing that enabled him to look Cas straight in the face. That, and the fact he liked to dismiss it as a drunk dream, I mean, he wouldn’t really flirt with an angel, least of all Cas, right? Right?
That night he'd drank his weight in whiskey. Sitting on the loveseat in his bedroom, it sunk in. He scoffed. "He changed his mind."
"Tell me, baby," Dean's own eruption was coming fast, and he sped up, Castiel's inner thighs glowing red from overuse, "what did you do to the guy next door?"
Castiel's pants were only down to his knees but kept the white lace thong, Dean caught his furry cat tail and teasingly pulled it out a little, Castiel's breath caught, he kissed the demon passionately on the face and neck, pecking down the other man's jaw impatiently, he loved the feel of his dry lips on Dean's skin, he loved kissing even more those freckles, they are like the last bit of childish proof left in this man's body, and also like the dotted stars in the Milky Way. Castiel thought they were beautiful. Then, in the demon's teasing-like attitude, he pushed the anal plug back into Castiel's body, causing the angel's body to shudder and fall into his arms, clinging to his neck.
"He won't even touch a hair on your head." Castiel said pleasantly, this moment Dean was brushing his sensitive spot, the angel narrowed his eyes and hummed with enjoyment, "You reminded me, I'll kill him later, he's so loud."
A tidal wave of pleasure began to build up inside Castiel, his body propelled, step by step, towards the brink of eruption. What finally pushed him off the cliff was the act of Dean gently pressing his thumb against Castiel's perineum. There was nothing there, he didn't have labia like a woman, but Dean's hand seemed to have created such a part for him, and although Castiel didn't seek to understand it, the thought was undoubtedly like an electric current through his whole body. He shuddered as he stepped his head into the pillow beneath him and felt the wet liquid coating his belly. He ejaculated, it took his brain longer than ever to recognize it, and then for the next minute, he couldn't think of anything but this insatiable feeling that filled his whole body.
They sat side by side on the bed, the TV was still on with Scooby-Doo, which Dean had watched countless times, he didn't want to change the channel either, so he watched it with Castiel. He didn't really care about the TV show, and Castiel didn't really need to eat, but they enjoyed such a quiet moment in silence. After a while, Castiel leaned over, rubbed his knee against Dean's leg, and called out softly, "Dean."
His hand cupped Castiel's already semi-erect cock, his thumb grazing the sensitive head as the demon leaned in and whispered in the angel's ear, "Look, you're already wet."
The feeling was like a long thirsty man holding up a clear spring. He let the water soak through his guts, even though there was a little discordant voice in the back of his head telling him that this was not going to last, that when you come to your senses, when Castiel comes to his senses, it will all be over, and you will regret what you did for the rest of your life. At the moment, the only thing Dean wanted to do was to drink more of this poisonous water, in addition to everything else, he did not care at all. He did not need to care. No responsibility, no meaning, he found his lifelong goal, which is to stay with the person he wants to spend the rest of his life with, not a second apart.
A kiss fell on his earlobe, the mysterious man taking Castiel's ear, his sharp teeth landing not too lightly on the ear, his tongue licking gently in a doting manner. Castiel felt an instinctive shiver run through him.
Dean was already annoyed with Sam over the words he didn’t say out loud, and couldn’t help but roll his eyes at his brother.
“Sam,” he said again, louder and more annoyed this time. He hit Sam on the arm for good measure, which finally got his attention.
Dean chuckled, slipping his arms around Cas. “Missed you too, babe,” he said, kissing the tip of his nose. “Alright, now let me go, I need to sleep.”
“I’m not gay,” he screamed, right before the door was slammed behind him on his way out of the room. Jack and Sam were left staring at the spot where he had been standing totally calm less than a minute ago.
What he hadn’t counted on when he came home a week after the new guy had moved in, was to hear loud classic music seeping out under the doorframe. That would be the perfect opportunity to say hi to his new hallmate.
The two brothers had managed on their own, though they had considered calling Castiel when they realized it would take a few days longer to figure out who was behind the murders in town. Dean missed the angel, but knew that it wouldn’t be necessary for Cas to make the long trip, when they would be going home soon anyway.
“Hey, Sam, I hooked up with someone at a bar. A dude. I swing both ways,” and then laugh it off. He just couldn’t do it like that. Maybe it also had something to do with the fact that he was getting older, and meaningless hookups didn’t have the same appeal to him as they did when he was younger. Maybe the reason why he didn’t want his first time with a guy to just be something quick in the stall of a bathroom in a small town on his way to a case, since his first time with a girl had been the first time he thought he was in love, a blinding teenage passion, and he had never regretted it. He treated her right and she him.
When he turned human, he had started writing a novel, and ever since he had met Dean Winchester he had kept a journal on him in his inner pocket, so that he could note down important and new things he noticed about Dean.
Instead Dean looked out at the road again. He hadn’t said anything else for the duration of the phone call, and without answering the person on the other end or answering Sam, he hung up, put the phone back down between them, tightened his grip on the steering wheel and stepped on the gas.
Even though he had been there since the start of mankind, he didn’t have a reason to learn about it. Until Dean. Until he fell in love. Until he fell to the Earth, his wings burned and his grace lost. He still didn’t know anything about humanity, even if he had tried to learn in order to get closer to Dean. It hadn’t helped.
The tears were still falling down Dean’s cheeks, but the giant smile he had plastered on his face overshadowed the fact that he had been sad just a minute ago. Right now all he could feel was the relief and happiness of actually being able to look into Cas’s eyes once again.
“Sounds good,” Cas said, turning his head to keep kissing Dean’s neck, not removing his hands nor mouth as they moved together through the bunker to Dean’s bedroom.
“God, I missed you,” he heard Dean say. Again, Dean sighed, and started to pull back from Cas. They now held each other at an arm's length, and Cas couldn’t stop smiling, whereas Dean was just staring at him with blatant love in his eyes.
He would get to say hello to his friend, even if that meant he had to wait for a little while. It might have always been Dean’s job to protect Sam, but Sam had made it his job a long time ago to make sure that Dean was happy, and if that meant his own heart clenching in his chest as he waited for his best friend to notice him too, then that was alright with him.
Sam had begun snoring not long after his head hit the pillow and when Cas laughed softly at him it gave Dean the perfect opportunity to examine him closely. He seemed fine, not a scratch on him and no puncture wounds in his neck. It looked like the djinn hadn’t had time to get to him. The relief flooded Dean and settled in his bones. He felt saturated, full of love and knew that he now had fulfilled his quota of hunting for the rest of his goddamn life.
He didn’t think it would be possible for him to ever feel this way about someone, especially when that someone was a dude.
Dean had just been sitting quietly, drinking his beer, and so Castiel had gone up to talk to him. When Dean had made no move to talk, Castiel drew out the now-vacant seat next to him and sat down.
Not much time went by before Sam declared that he was going to sleep and Jack decided to turn on the tv at a reasonable volume. Dean had nothing to complain about, seeing as he had just gotten the love of his life back — the newest and best revelation he had ever had — except for the fact that said love was having a staring contest with the floor, not daring to look up at Dean just yet. The tension in the air was palpable as Dean turned around with Cas’s name on his tongue.
“You are my root, Dean. My grace rests like a seed inside of you, and ever since we first met our tree has been growing and growing, up until a point where I can no longer bear it alone. My grace solidifies our bond with each other, and though I can feel you longing for me when I am not here, I sometimes fear that it’s only because of my existing grace inside of you.”
For the last two days he had been tripping over boxes in the hall, waiting for who he knew was a man, just by looking at the handwriting on the boxes.
“Hey, Sam.” Dean grinned sheepishly, maneuvering him and Cas around a table. “Back home again. I’m going to bed and taking Cas with me. See you in a few hours,” he said, grinning down at Cas, who didn’t seem to hear a thing. Sam looked weirdly at them, as if this was something new, even though it happened every time Dean came home.
“Dean,” the man said, simply just staring at him. There was a moment of surprise in his eyes, but it didn’t last long before it disappeared. “I wasn’t expecting you. Gabriel will be over soon, but do you want to come inside?”
He took a few steps forward until he was standing right in front of Dean, a little too close as only they tended to do.
Now Cas knew what Dean had tried to suppress for so long, afraid that his feelings wouldn’t be reciprocated.
It almost felt surreal to him now, arriving at the bunker after having been away for a few days. They had been living on the road for so many years without ever having someplace to come home to that it had taken him a while to get used to it, but now he cherished it and even missed it when they were away. He missed his bed, he missed the coffee machine, he missed every little quirk and feature that the bunker had, because it was his home.
Before he really fell off the edge of wakefulness into the bright blue sea in his dreams he had a thought about how wrong he had been. Maybe he was gay after all. Or maybe he just liked Cas. There hadn’t really been anyone else in his life for a long while. To Dean it didn't even really matter anyway. Having Cas right there beside him was all that mattered in the end.
They loved each other and there was no one Dean would rather spend the rest of his life with, so why he was surprised when Castiel turned around to look at him one morning they had chosen to spend in bed, and asked Dean to marry him, was anyone’s guess. That morning would be their first and last time making love together as fiancées, and only two months later, when they had the ceremony, the elegant outfits and the guestlist all worked out, did they get married and tried out how good the bed was in the honeymoon suite they were currently staying in.
Now, it might have seemed like he had found the right guy that he wanted to do that with. Cas. Castiel. The Fallen Angel. His Angel.
“How’s your beer?” he asked cautiously, trying to strike up conversation. But then Dean turned around to face him, intent eyes and tight lips, clutching his beer in both hands.
“We are linked forever, Dean, you and I, and I care enough for you to let you go if this is not something you want.”
“Dean. I do find you very aesthetically pleasing, just so you know. Don’t worry about rejection, because there will be others.”
Dean hated being sick, and Cas knew that, which was why it had taken him three days to ask for Dean to cuddle with him.
“You don’t mind that?” Castiel sounded out of breath, tentative as he searched Dean’s eyes for the answer he already knew in his heart.
He had been pacing around his room for a while now. He had heard Sam leave the bunker, but he hadn’t heard a word from Cas since the kiss. He was honestly afraid to go out of his room, afraid that Cas had packed his bags and was gone by now, or afraid that Cas was just going to ignore him.
Every night he wrote new observations down, and it wasn’t even like he was hiding his obvious staring or the book, so when Dean found it Cas simply smiled.
There was a pause where Castiel let his words soak in, as he stared back at the dumbfounded man in front of him.
“You’re more than just family, Dean.” In the small pause that ensued, it was clear for Cas to hear how Dean’s breath hitched in his throat.
He often wondered how Castiel felt about the bunker. Dean wanted Cas to think of it as his home too, but he wasn’t sure how welcome Castiel felt he was.
Rather than sex, they, and Dean had needed a lot of time to get used to this, made love. They took care of each other and Cas was so earnest and caring that Dean was sure he could never love another.
“Please work,” he whispered, taking a deep breath, before gently pressing his bleeding hand against Cas’s. The silence was deafening and Dean closed his eyes in dread. He moved his mouth silently along with the prayers playing on repeat in his head, asking God to please save Cas, asking Cas to please come back, spooling the words forwards and backwards and putting them in a constant loop. He barely noticed how he had leaned his head on Cas’s shoulder, his breath coming in heavy waves to land on the other man’s neck nor how tightly he was gripping to the front of Cas’s shirt with his previously unoccupied hand.
Before he reached the highway he had to pull the car over. Dean took a moment to breathe while he leaned his head on the steering wheel in front of him. At that point he realized that he never finished reading the rest of the note Sam gave him.
It didn’t take more than 20 minutes before Dean was driving down a little road, the excitement very obvious on his face, and then he pulled to a stop. Out of the windshield Sam could see the blue light from a phone booth sign vaguely lighting up the figure standing beside it. The figure, the clothes and the hair looked like Cas.
Dean suddenly exploded in a fit of rage, his outburst unexpected and loud. “You’re wrong,” he was yelling, and “It’s not as simple as that, Sammy,” he accused.
Castiel was giving Dean a strange look and it made him look almost small, as he stood there under the towering trees in an oversized trenchcoat, despite the fact that he was an angel of the Lord and had existed since the creation of the Earth.
They sat against the headboard for most of the night, Dean’s eyelids droopy while Cas told him stories in the softest voice Dean thought he had ever heard. He barely got a single word in, but listened happily and ended up unintentionally dozing off against Cas’s shoulder. He needed the sleep, though he didn’t get very much of it.
Sam trudged down the stairs, already halfway through the library by the time Dean started to move down the stairs too. He suspected Sam would just shut himself in his room, and seeing as he had been sleeping all the way home, he would probably either start reading or begin research for a new case.
He smiled gently at Dean and moved aside so that they didn’t touch while passing each other in the doorway.
“Yeah, just fine, Dean. Simply tired,” he answered, sitting down next to Dean and immediately took a sip of Dean’s coffee, warming his hands on the mug.
“I willingly gave a part of my grace to you, Dean, so that I could make you whole again. That’s a decision I will never regret. When I said we share a more profound bond, this is what I meant. I care for you unlike any other human, Dean.” He looked back down at the ball of light, unable to meet Dean’s eyes. “You are the core of my existence, what grounds me here on Earth. I feel like I belong somewhere, when I am with you.”
They hadn’t seen each other in years. As soon as Castiel had closed the door and turned around to face Dean, he was engulfed in a bone crushing hug.
Dean couldn’t say anything. He didn’t think he had ever stared at anyone that long in his life. When it became clear to Cas that Dean wasn’t moving, he leaned forward himself and kissed the love of his life.
Castiel looked up and Dean finally got eye contact with him again. His eyes looked blue and tired, but was filled with an oddly sweet look of affection.
He had felt attracted to his own sex over the years, and he knew that being on the road could mean that he could just try it, and then, if he didn’t like it, he could just stop thinking about this weird urge he had.
No more words were exchanged for the rest of the ride, but the excitement bubbling in Dean was unmistakable in the small room of the car. Sam was nervous, too, but also knew that they had to approach apprehensively.
“Cas, I’m right here, aren’t I? I’m right here.” He held Cas’s face in his hands for a moment more, caressing his cheeks, before heaving a deep sigh and pulling Cas close for a bone-crushing hug. “We’re not leaving each other ever again. I promise, Cas.”
Cas was looking at him so earnestly, that the words Dean felt rising in his throat was being choked down again.
He was well aware that Sam didn’t cherish the bunker nearly as much, having had a lot of places to temporarily call home in his life, but to Dean, this was it. This was the place where he knew he would grow old and die, or at least he would like to be burned and buried out in the woods behind the bunker, seeing as hunters didn’t tend to live nearly as long as everybody else.
It wasn’t hard to take the first steps towards the figure in front of them. Sam’s feet felt too heavy to move though, and Dean was already in front of the car when the person by the telephone booth decided to turn around.
But, alas, here he was, madly in love and he never wanted to change those feelings. Maybe he had always kind of liked dudes, he had learned that it was actually possible to swing both ways, but he had just always denied it. Now, the time had come for him to start acting on it, instead of ignoring it.
“And you say that now when I’ve been offering to sleep with you for the last couple of days. C’mon, let’s go to sleep,” Dean said, when Cas yawned loudly.
It had taken them a while to get back home. They had been working on a case in Dubois, Idaho, a regular salt-n-burn turned to a sudden witch hunt.
Like the way it seemed that there kept on coming more and more freckles on his nose, and how his right dimple, the only one really, had seemed to grow into his chin, just like a wrinkle. It didn’t make him look old, but it just kind of gave him something very endearing over him.
He didn’t think his brother would mind, but still, he didn’t feel like it would be the right kind of way to tell his brother that he was bisexual.
The things on this list are ridiculous, he couldn’t help but think. The aforementioned true love’s kiss was first on the list, but the rest involved drinking the tear of a loved one (they hadn’t even specified who was supposed to drink whose tear), a blood pact that can only work for true loves, and the last sentence simply states “virgin sacrifice.” Dean couldn’t even be sure of whether or not that was a joke, because they had gotten desperate in the last couple of days. If the other options didn’t work out they probably wouldn’t hesitate to try out the last one, just for good measure.
Turning the tv off, Dean turned his head towards his brother and almost barked out his words. “What, Sam?”
Dean took a deep breath and tried to focus on the tumult of feelings stirring inside of him. It clicked, suddenly. Something felt like it was moving inside of him, and it was filled with a burning want to be connected once again to the light sphere in Castiel’s hand. It was so blatantly obvious now that Dean wondered how he had not realized this before. The longing he felt for Castiel had always been a part of him.
He hadn’t even prepared what to say, but that didn’t matter, because the moment the door opened and he saw who was now living across from him, he was rendered speechless.
Jack walked directly over to the table and sat down with his back to Dean, immediately opening up one of their computers. Dean was suddenly a little worried, as Sam was still standing halfway into the room, looking at him uncertainly.
But now, years later, he finally felt like he had it under control. He finally felt like he knew something about humanity, that he had somehow uncovered a secret that had been long lost to him, a secret only revealed with the promise of true love.
A phone call that could make Dean react like this could be a number of things, and Sam could do nothing but fear the worst until Dean told him.
Dean looked at him, unblinking and trying to wield his words to sound firm. “There is nothing I would change about us or our bond, okay? I’ll be right here, by your side, to watch our bond grow stronger every day, Cas.”
Dean almost tore the paper out of Sam’s hand. Except for the choking noise that came from Dean’s throat as he read the first sentence, the room was exceptionally quiet. Sam was standing at the foot of the bed, wringing his hands.
So Cas researched, Dean killed the monsters, and Sam talked to people to get information or to help them get through the loss they had suffered.
Sam couldn’t take his eyes off of Cas, but Cas had barely acknowledged his presence with a glance, and Sam didn’t know if he was even allowed to make the first move towards him.
, had you not run off without looking back. You think you’re the only one who’s been trying to keep your hands to yourself, but believe me, Dean, I want to kiss you just as bad as you want to kiss me. So stop avoiding me, and just
He couldn’t say it. But he could feel it. In every bone of his body, it was tickling. So instead he lifted his hand off the bar and took a hold of Castiel’s warm palm.
That was all it took for Dean to break down. A strangled sound escaped his throat and he took a step forward to bury his head in Cas’ neck, arms going around his back to hold him tightly against his own body. Cas’ own hands came up to grip Dean, and he gently started carding a hand through Dean’s hair.
Thank you so much for reading! I of course appreciate kudos and comments, and please check out the DCRB
Nothing special happened, but suddenly Dean felt so much more safe, so much more happy. Cas was looking at him like that and as they smiled softly to each other, Dean knew this was it. He didn’t need anybody else.
After what felt like 10 minutes, Dean finally closed his eyes, and Sam looked over at him. A tear was trickling down his chin, and as he closed his eyes and let out a deep breath, Sam thought that maybe this wasn’t even something he was supposed to see, something he was even allowed to see.
So Dean stayed in his room, long after dark, his stomach growling. He felt like he needed a drink, but he had long ago gotten rid of the stash he used to keep under his bed.
These stories were written a long while ago and I know it's taken me a while to upload them all, even though I've had them on my computer for years. (Which is also why the quality of my writing, grammar and storytelling probably changes from the first to the last story.)
“Isn’t this great, Sammy?” He put out his arms to emphasize that he meant the bunker, and Sam barely threw him a glance before huffing and throwing Dean’s duffle bag at him.
Dean is trying to believe that, yeah he got life, He gets paid, and he doesn't have to worry about hunting too much. It was a little difficult to get used to it all but something is still missing. Adapting to it wasn't that hard but it's the fact the whole bunker was radio silent with one another, there weren't any conversations, no family dinners with one another, and really everyone is doing their own thing. To Dean, it was fine that everyone went off doing their own thing however the family business was about working with one another, and now that everyone is doing their own thing they aren't together as much. That wasn't the main problem really, but he did miss it. “I don't think it's just all about Cas and me, there are things I'm not certain of” Dean simply replied.
Jack huffed tired as he looked over Amara, and smiled brightly thank you- he didn't know what else to reply, and now looked back at Sam, he needs to check on him
He knew how much Dean appreciated him, how much he loved Sam, and Cas too, he just knows, and that brought a smile upon his lips. He could organize something for Dean to feel better, maybe ask Cas to help him a little bit... even as one of the strongest beings in existence right now, he is still not prepared to do anything on his own really..understanding it is a different thing “Well, life here right now feels empty. No matter how harsh this will sound, it's because we had a purpose to run into, God made them for us, You and Sam too. Now we can make our own choices Dean…” And finally, Dean's truth was out here, heard by someone. It will remain a secret until Dean decides to be honest with his feelings towards the angel. “If you truly love him, you should try telling him that Dean…” Jack squinted his eyes a tiny bit, a quiet hum leaving his throat. “Have you tried talking to him about your feelings ever before?”
Once he saw Sam and Jack leave. The Angel needed to believe that both of them are capable enough to hold chuck back. Cas charged right in front of Dean with his angel blade in hopes it would harm her so they had a chance to take the scythe from her. Aside from that, nothing would touch Death. The only thing that could do damage was the scythe itself.
Looking back at Castiel and glancing over at Dean, the signs of tension were obvious. The Nephilim Swallowed almost too close for comfort and with one peak over his books and laptop, he thought of something actually his eyes fell over Dean now, letting the box back down on the table, a smile implanted on his lips still “how about you and Cas got to the cinemas tonight?” Jack suggested “I really have to study”
Dean moved his head down a little before he looked back up at “Cas-'' that was until he also was startled by Billie's continuous loud bang, the door flung right open and they braced themselves for this day, Dean can't find any options and he had to accept whatever came to him, he didn’t want Cas to be in the middle of this because it was unfair. it really was unfair for him.  Dean even knew that Cas did not deserve to be killed by Billie. He looked over at Billie who approached both of them slowly “Cas please, go.” This was one final attempt Dean had, even if it didn’t work, somehow, Dean believed that Cas can still get out of there before anything else went down. His objective was to now keep Cas alive at all costs and he's in denial this was the end
Castiel gasped at the strong radiance of power flow in his body, this awakened his angelic side to full potential once again. His eyes glowed a gentle blue before Cas blinked and exhaled after he was healed "Thank you Jack" he is so proud of Jack..
Sam burned up, from head to toe, the immense anger boiling off inside him was too much. The feeling of empathy was almost gone, the mark pulsed on his stomach simultaneously enough to make Sam groan from the annoyance. When he noticed Jack reached towards him, he raised his own hand to stop Jack from trying to touch his shoulder “don't, not now Jack... not now” This was a win, a big win...but they still had so much work to do
Sam inhaled sharply and tried to shake off the bad feeling he is getting out of this, how God has not made a single sign, which is a good thing, it means that he has not felt anything coming from Jack “Well Dean, as you know. Jack can't exactly use his powers...It will be a beacon for Chuck if he were to do that. I don't think you'd want Chuck coming to us so suddenly.” He explained before he looked at his brother before he took something out of his bag. It was a sharp blade of the sort, he found it on the hunt. A vampire had it, the blade looked familiar from one of the thousands, and thousands of lore he had read, he needed to do some digging. “So, you mean to say that Cas bailed on us because he wanted to drink?” Sam said furiously, he left the blade in the middle of the map table before he turned back to his brother now.
Jack huffed out, and with whatever he had last, he groaned from exhaustion but fought through it, gripped his jaw tightly, and finally got to seal the gate. God was locked
Dean immersed himself fully in the film because the hunter is a big movie watcher it would only make sense. He didn’t move a lot once it started and really his focus was locked onto the said movie. He's seen it before but it'll never get boring to him. Dean would recall when his mother would enjoy films such as these with his Dad, his mother was more of a pop culture-savvy person than John ever was but that never stopped him from still enjoying these films. Maybe he was a little too young to be watching these kids. He can recall when his mother would sneak him into some of the rated R movies but that never stopped Mary from doing it, and quite frankly Dean wasn't bothered by it either. He did finally look over to Cas a little trying to see some of his reactions. A lot of them looked of a mixture of perplexed and even more inquisitive
Amara the moment she took care of Billie decided to leave, she went off to fix what her brother had done to the rest of the planets, but he doesn't have much hope for that, she is Amara after all, darkness.
Castiel allowed his hand to fall to the side, now it had finally stopped dripping. the Angel made his way towards the main part of the bunker, the angel felt lost in his own thoughts, each step felt heavy and forced. When he reached the main part of the bunker, he raised his head to look at Dean and Jack just made his chest pulse, his heart beat faster. They did it, they’re finally free. He didn't move any closer to them and the way he looked were just small glances that were filled with awkwardness, shock, and obviously still processing through what just happened. His lips parted to speak; to say anything more to make the silence break, but Dean spoke first. Cas jolted slightly and just gave Dean a nod but the eye contact was avoided. He heard a few footsteps come closer to him. Cas turned a bit to look at Jack that was now close to him
Jack had walked in after a few minutes, he opened the door before he closed it again. The Nephilim looked tired and filthy, but the familiar posture he has with a semi-forced smile on his lips was there. To him, that should indicate he was fine for the time being. He looked both at Sam and Dean trying to hide the weight he felt on his chest, the guilt eating him alive. “Dean, it's good to see you!” Jack said, his voice wasn't loud but was loud enough for him to hear.
Dean has finished up his second beer. He still was gazing up at the ceiling for a good solid three minutes before he heard Cas. He doesn't actually want to go on the hunt they may go on but even so, cases were enough to distract them all from Chuck's doings and weird awful plans even so. Seeing his other version self doing that destroyed his mood for the day. Dean finally looked over in Cas's direction “Yeah, I don't think I'm going to go this time” Dean blandly said, he didn't have any specific tone to it but even so there's a very little hint of sorrow in the mix. Dean's finally figured out what he was feeling;  wasn't pleasant in any sense or sort. Dean placed his bottle into the recycling before he walked towards the exit, the Hunter simply pats Cas's shoulder before he departed from the kitchen.
Dean listened to Cas, he's still trying to process everything that did happen the other day even from time to time he thought deeply about it. Dean didn't say anything in response to him when the angel mentioned him meaning a lot to Cas, he did take note of what he said, but he isn't going to bring attention to it. He's a bit focused on getting over what happened, not a heart to heart conversation. He looked at Cas when he was about to explain something they needed to discuss but they were interrupted by Sam like usual, also, on time as well. Dean got up from his seat before he walked over to his brother “Yeah what's up?” Dean was quick to reply, Cas and Dean spoke to each other very little but he'll maybe save the conversation for another time or whenever they get the chance to. That isn't Dean's worries right now, that's way behind what he needs to focus on right now
Dean looked up at the kid when Jack placed his hand onto his shoulder, he finished with whatever was left in the glass. The hunter placed it gently back onto the table before he sighed a little “Hey” Dean regained his composure he didn't think the Nephilim would be up at this hour. Both Dean and Cas were out for a while and it would be very late. “What are you doing up?” Dean inquires simply, he needed to cut down on drinking but whenever something goes wrong with him and Cas it just doesn't help him. other than that he tried to change the subject if he were to guess what happened at the cinema. “Did you get enough studying in?”
Castiel's palm had a fussy physical feeling over his skin, the ghostly touch over his knuckles still made the angel shiver, this shiver ran down his spine with strong desire. If it was under his own will to have a dean now and then, he would probably do so. He’d take his hand, press against his own lips, and kiss every single scar until all of them have taken the love and care they so much asked for. Castiel must be delirious to even try so hard to fill up the emptiness that knows if it gets filled, the empty itself will take him.. honestly, he didn’t know what was worse at this point, the fact he is losing Dean inch by inch, their love, their connection fading away with every way possible. He has fallen for the hunter and now a Deal he took in high belief Dean would never reciprocate back, and now that Castiel had a gut feeling Dean is...he can't allow it, he needs to be there for Dean
His eyebrows almost touched each other as he frowned gently, looking at Dean, listening to what he had to say. He and Castiel have one very complicated relationship and it makes Jack confused to say the least, though he can see the signs from Dean's sides too, and that hurts his heart, it hurts having Dean so desperate to explain his emotions, how the missing pieces that will only be healed once Cas's piece slots right there, right into Dean's chassis.
Chuck looked at his sister “You cannot do this to me sis, you wanted nothing more than a family and It's right here please” Chuck pleaded for his sister to merge with him, he wanted to resume control but by the looks of it, Chuck had lost
Billie tried to get through the sigil by continuously banging on the door. The sigil will not stay forever and she's very ready to kill both Dean and Cas. The two people she has her mindset on, the original plan was to kill Dean but the annoying angel wouldn't let her so easily and if both of them aren’t alive in the story, it might make her chances a lot better
When the other Dean moved away from him Cas forced a smile on his lips and tried to make it look as real as the angel could possibly make it look. Soon enough that smile turned parted lips and eyes widened in pure shock, the man leaned to kiss his cheek and it was when he realized now.
“Dean…” he started off, the Nephilim looked away for a second, and swallowed harshly he contemplated if it was a good idea to empathize what's happening here or just make sure Dean won't stop talking with Cas “Castiel he uh, he’s had a few troubles lately, he talked to me about not getting happy any time soon for something personal. I don't really know what that means..but I think that both of you should talk a lot more; talking to him yesterday, he seemed sorrowful” Jack raised his look to focus now on Dean's eyes “truth is, I didn't have to study much, but I thought both of you going out would help.”
Sam gave Dean a confused look, bit glimpses of concern as well. Even with anger that boiled inside his gut towards Cas, bailing them for whatever bender the angel went once more. He couldn't help but also feel worried for him, lately, he has noticed Cas eating a little bit easier but also getting drunk a lot easier, and now a shower- something is wrong. Sam knows He would have replied only if Jack didn't come back in. Sam decided to leave them alone for now and finished cleaning up himself. He decided to make dinner for Team Free Will to ease his mind of the current emotions he’s trying to keep down deep within him.
After God has defeated the mark was handed over to Sam, with him now having it was a burden in itself. They all hope it won't cause the same obscure effects to him as it did with Dean, so far Sam seemed to be doing fine but Jack can't help but worry over him, and how it affects his ability to feel empathy or have anger issues...almost like his soul was flaking away. Jack currently sat at the main part of the bunker, reading a few books that humans call biology.
Cas tried to focus his eyes at the taller figure, must be Jack or maybe Dean? with a little more focus he got to see a little clearer but the dizziness remained, everything was turbulence around him and it made the angel sicker. He leaned onto the kitchen table, before letting it go to take a step closer to Dean and look right at his face, too close for comfort. “I am such a big bad luck Dean” Cas's voice is very harsh and dehydrated, almost as if he had a cold. With a deep swallow, Cas kept talking now eyeing the man emeralds... he felt his own eyes droop and is now falling.
The hunter was left just as stunned as Cas as he looked over at Amara, he was both relieved and shocked. After a brief moment of silence after Billie was literally reduced to nothing Dean looked back at Cas they were still in the same position- at most but he moved away subtly. Dean wanted to ask what Cas wanted to tell him but they literally were both about to get killed in the same room. The hunter had nothing to say after this whole thing was much like a fever dream and he didn't know what to think at the moment, but now that everything was taken care of Dean should be a bit happier over this but for some reason, he isn't. Dean just decided to leave the room, the job was done. He went back to the main part of the bunker to see if Jack and Sam are okay.
The Hunter found Jack before he came up the steps “Hey kid” Dean replied, he acted as if he was happy. He's been acting as if everything's been okay and all. For the most part, he'd say they did get what they wanted, but even everyone is so detached in the bunker. The hunter is barely home, Cas is barely there, and Sam... Sam usually stays in his room from time to time, he does come out but he doesn't speak to anyone else. Dean really only had Jack to speak with him consistently. And hell, he doesn't even know where Cas is the majority of the time... that should be the least of his worries, in those couple of weeks, he was able to take Jack fishing for a little and also do a couple of other things, hunting wise a little but not too much of that.
They managed to kill god, or more so lock him up they are truly happy or should be. Sam might be struggling, Jack too, a little bit too. “Just because it’s something you both regret doesn't mean it's true…” Jack turned his chair and stopped leaning on the table to focus on his dad instead. “You and Cas are hurting so much even without freedom, you both are hurting and I can feel it Dad '' Jack confessed, it's the reason why he so desperately is trying to help them out both, and then there was the question. Jack exhaled gently looking Dean right at his eyes “do you love Cas?” he is certain there won't be an answer, the Nephilim’s intention was to not invade Dean's privacy, but knowing would solve the last few dots he has to connect
Again with the pie situation, he isn't going to take too much thought into that, Dean will probably get some later, preferably when the angel isn't around. Even at four in the fucking morning or something because why not. The hunter was taken aback by Cas who stepped forward and said no to him- well... guess he isn't going himself.
Jack’s eyes gently squeezed each other and he squinted, tilting his head to the side and eyes wandering on the map table trying to busy his mind with anything else but worrisome thoughts.
Jack was drained to the bones, he tried to gather up his own breath as he and Sam were now sat at the edge of the table in the main part of the bunker. The map looked ominous, the bunker deafeningly quiet after what happened “Sam-” Jack said pleadingly he reached out to him, he was about to touch Sam's shoulder but his hand got stopped almost right away
Billie looked at Dean “What a shame” Death sighed a little, she walked toward Dean. She was ready to do whatever she needed to get what she wanted. Oh how badly she wanted to become god since they made plans to defeat chuck. She always wanted to be a ruler and make the world the way she envisions it. The type of world she wanted is a bit darker than what god initially had at the beginning of times.
Jack waited for the queue, he waited until Dean turned and nodded his head. Sam and Him went the other way in a rush, he has faith and trust that Cas and Dean will stop Billie from ruining their plans, this is the one chance they have, they could not afford to make any mistakes now.
The rest of the night. Dean didn't pay mind to what happened, he already convinced himself that this wasn't going to work out after all. The hunter went to the main part of the bunker when he left Baby, he didn't speak with the angel as per usual. Dean took a seat at one of the tables. Conveniently there was the whiskey from the other night. Dean thought, screw it. He left the table for a second to get a glass and the alcohol, the hunter took a seat before he got himself a little. Dean looked at the table, he glanced over and found that the box with the pie is still there. He looked around to make sure no one else was present in the bunker, or at least in the same part as him. He moved his hand over to drag the box back to himself; He traced his fingers around the box before he opened it.
He looks at Cas, the face he made was with acceptance of what will come next. This might be the one time they have, and yet this will be their last. Dean still felt guilty for the angel being tangled in his own death row. This shouldn't have happened in the first place, and he regretted every bit of it. “You know what's going to happen.” Dean paused and gulped deeply. “Billie is going to get in here, she's going to kill you, then me,” Dean explained this was the reality and he needed to deal with it. His time already came a very long time ago, he's been able to cheat Death ever since he got out of Hell. Technically “Billie wanted to kill me since I was taken out of Hell.” Dean paused before he continued “It looks like there's nothing we can do” Dean placed his elbows on the chair looking down for a second before he stared back at blue-eyed Angel
Jack held the edges of his book, paper-thin enough that it rippled and a loud clap like the sound was heard as he closed it, dust flew onto the air while doing a said thing but the smile was visible looking at dean contently, he dad was one spectacular human being and their time together has actually enlightened Jack about the world and how it is. His favorite thing to do with Dean is fishing, he liked movies but those pop-culture jokes he cracked from time to time Jack doesn't understand them, as for the references, he sometimes gets them, but so much.
Dean cleared up, he remembers when he had the discussion about love with Jack and how crazy it was, Steak through the heart and that may be true love- but that isn't it. And it never was. He wanted to avoid this type of conversation but it's almost one in the morning and Dean is just drinking himself to sleep at this point, there's nothing else new about this
Castiel had no clue how to form any sentence, Amara had saved them both, and as he turned his head to look at the wall of the room, behind the chair that collected dust at the center of the room, there was nothing...The empty was nowhere around, Castiel didn't get to express how he felt, he didn't even get to say a simple three words that have been buried deep down his chest, carved and carved into one large crack in his chassis to made him disobey. Something that made him have his own free will and fall in love for a human so purely humane “Dean-'' he husked out, voice gentle but the shock grained the noise of the hunter's name. Castiel didn't even notice it yet but his palm where he held Dean on the cheek, blood still gently dropped from the deep wound, he smeared blood that was on his palm all over his sleeve to try to clean it up. He couldn't bear to look at Amara or anyone but his palm.
Jack’s face lightened up once he saw his angel father Castiel, He looked at Cas with pure and gentle eyes, excited much cause he was going out with Dean tonight to watch the movie with one large lizard “Cas!” he almost screamed but did say his name loudly, his eyes fell right on the box placed over on the table. Jack knew right away that this must be one of the baked goods that Cas made at the classes he goes to, without any hesitation Jack reached out to grab the box and open it. The pie was still heating up slightly and the smells of sweet apples and cinnamon got even stronger. Everything about the pie was amazing.
Castiel knew that by the way his skin achingly caressed over his own, how the fingertips grazed harshly across his thick coat, and how softly it caressed their head down to the angel's lower back, it made the starvation for the man sink lower. This dean was longing for something, Cas knew but he couldn't give that to him, his own affection has been taken by someone else. He stood there and watched, Dean observed how Castiel allowed this foreign version of himself to touch him. Cas was hurt with seeing not even the slightest of tension on the other man; nothing at all as a reaction to the intimacy between The Richer Dean and him. It almost shattered his heart, he wanted something, anything, any reaction would be good but he got nothing. Glowering looks and eyes that skimmed through his life forced like a really sharp blade slicing through.
It didn't take long for them to drive to the cinema. The last time Dean’s been to one was a couple of days ago. He's been able to catch up on a lot of old films he used to look at when he was a kid. Dean was lucky enough they were playing at the time. When they arrived Dean parked Baby and got out, of course, he waited for the angel to leave the car. He didn't question Cas literally wearing some of his clothes, he didn't think that the angel would dig into his wardrobe, not that Dean ever cared that Cas would. It’s still a surprise Dean washed away whatever thoughts he had at the moment, he locked the impala before he headed in. Dean took the time to stay in line to get something to eat, he stuck to the whole popcorn thing but actually he was quiet while he got his things and acquired tickets for the both of them.
Dean listened to Cas closely, He tried to wrap the words around his head but that didn't fully clear up. The last phrase that Cas was so rudely interrupted by; He actually smiled a bit at the statements that Cas said while sitting just right across him. He's rendered speechless but he isn't sure of what to say, thank you? or something that would be the blandest answer. He's not really intoxicated and he isn't quite sure how to assess this without it making it too awkward “You were about to say something else” Dean cut Cas off after he finished the last line “I don't know, you seemed desperate to tell me something else other than all of that” Dean may be a bit pushy at the moment but he felt it might be something more, he just wanted to be right about this, but he would need that confirmation from Cas
“Oh, the movie we're going to watch is Godzilla.  I think he's about the size of an angel and probably smaller” Dean slipped in that comparison, it seemed even with that he couldn't get Cas out of his head “I guess, just, let me know when you're ready then we'll get going. I'm going to drown myself in buttered popcorn” Dean smiled at Jack, he did enjoy the full few weeks of activities with Jack, therapeutic to say the very least aside from hunting all the damn time
Then again, Billie expected this to happen. The book followed exactly how their deaths will play out. Billie wanted nothing more but to kill Dean at this point, the conversation She had with him almost two years ago stuck with her. Dean never complained if it was his time, and he never begged for wanting to live. Billie was in shock when she was struck by her own weapon, fortunately, she did get a hold of it once again once Dean moved back. Billie was holding onto the side of her Arm Dean, Dean... I thought this day would come. Death Regained her composure before getting her scythe again, she knew how Dean would die and it's been his time since two years ago when they first had this conversation. They stole the book from her and she wanted it back. Billie did get it back but the whole story changed, it changed in a way she didn't like which is something she’ll try alter. If Dean was no longer in the story then it would change, therefore, her goal is to get rid of part of the story that shouldn't be there in the first place
When they had proof that this was the real Castiel, and not someone pretending to be him, then they could find out why he was back and go back to the bunker. They deserved at least a week’s break after this, Sam thought.
He opened his eyes again, and despite the burn in his eyes from the white light between them, he focused his gaze back on Castiel, who was already looking intensely at him.
Cas and Dean had always had a special bond, a different kind of connection than Sam and Cas had, and different than the way it felt for Sam and Dean to be brothers, but it wasn’t like
They had been through so much, and they knew each other maybe even better than Sam and Dean knew each other. Dean just knew that he wouldn’t mind spending all the time he had until death together with Cas, sleeping next to him, having sex with him, loving him.
Despite the fact that he had been sitting behind a wheel for an entire day, Dean wasn’t tired. They’d stopped to get dinner a few hours ago, so there wasn’t really anything Dean needed to do.
Castiel moved slowly, deliberately, and turned his body around to face Dean’s. The fact that Cas wasn’t looking him in the eyes made him feel like he didn’t belong in his own skin. He wanted Cas to look at him, he
“Oh. Uhm. I got offered a job here. I start in two weeks time at Kansas University. I’m a teacher now,” he said, seeming a little embarrassed.
“Of course. I have watched humanity for all my existence, and never have I seen a soul as bright as yours. And even if I didn’t have your soul to look at, I see what it is that women get attracted to. Your soul is shining through your eyes and even in your grumpy days, you look so wonderful. So of course I mean it, Dean. I will always mean it.”
They had been told that Castiel was dead, that this time he wouldn’t be coming back. It wouldn’t even come as a surprise to Sam if Dean had been praying to Chuck, because he had done that too, both for Cas, but also for hope that God was looking over their mom in the other world where she was trapped.
There had been an endless number of ways for him to finally come out and say it, and yet, he found that he had probably chosen the worst of them all. He had just kissed Cas.
Cas had taken over and pushed Dean up against the wall and the two grown men were grinding against each other.
The only sounds around them was the occasional car driving by on the busier road further away from them. No one moved. No one said anything.
“We found something,” Sam said, “but you’re not going to like it.” He held out a piece of paper in his hand, clearly hesitant to give it to Dean, the obvious discomfort showing in the way he was shifting his body.
“How could I not? I may love humanity and how odd it is, but that’s not the reason why I am still here on Earth. I left my brethren for you, Dean.”
When Sam and Jack got back to the motel room Dean barely glanced up at them, too enthralled in the tv show he was currently watching. Sam was looking at Dean like he had somehow sprouted two heads, even though they saw each other less than two hours ago. Sam brought back a coffee for Dean, who was thankful but also reminded that he hadn’t eaten anything in a while.
Dean still didn’t speak for another few minutes. It looked like he was having trouble saying anything. At last he looked over at Sam, and Sam could see that his eyes were wet, and what looked like a small smile was playing on the corner of his mouth.
“Your grace inside of me is just an excuse for me wanting to be close to you. I’ll help you, okay? You are a part of me, as much as I am a part of you.” He watched cautiously for any sign that Cas didn’t like what he was saying, but when nothing happened, he said, “You’re moving in and that’s final, Cas.”
So Dean went over and knocked, and first when he heard the music get turned down and footsteps approaching, did he think that maybe he should have brought something over with him, like muffins or a wine maybe. That seemed like the proper way to welcome a new neighbour. Well, Dean had never been good at these things, and, anyway, the guy would probably understand that Dean wasn’t the type that did stuff like that.
“Cas, you d-” Dean began, but was interrupted when Castiel took a step forward, leaving all traces of personal space behind him.
He didn’t mind though. Humanity had always been kind of a mystery to him, even though he really longed to know about it. He was intrigued, if you could really say it that way.
When Dean had kissed him in his bedroom that night, a few days after he had been cured of the mark, it felt like everything was finally as it should be.
Dean was complicated, yet simple. Castiel wanted to learn everything there was to learn about him and that, inevitably, meant learning about humanity too.
Castiel looked uneasy, as though he was trying to wish himself away to somewhere else, anywhere but here.
Once there he took a moment to really look at Castiel. Though they might have left most of their feelings unsaid, the looks they shared spoke volumes instead. There had always been an understanding between them that their relationship couldn’t be compared to that of a mundane pair of adult men.
“Cas.” Dean reached out a hand towards Cas and put it gently on his cheek. He was already choking up, despite the fact that Dean Winchester was a man who rarely cried. On this occasion, though, he had trouble keeping a level head as the tears prickled behind his eyes and squeezed his throat tight.
His body had unwillingly wrapped around Cas, pulling him in for a tight hug, both of them still breathing shakily in the silent room. When Dean took in a sharp breath as Cas squeezed his hand reassuringly, as if to say “Yes, this is real, I’m right here in your arms and I’m not going anywhere”, Cas used his powers to heal their wounded hands. The light streamed out from between their fingers, a strange pattern dancing on the walls for just a second, leaving their hands unscathed.
Dean couldn’t stop staring at Cas, amazed by the sudden change in him. He looked powerful, his eyes blazing fury, as he studied his outstretched palm between their bodies.
Sam wasn’t sure how long he had been asleep when he was jolted awake by Dean’s cellphone ringing between them. Dean barely glanced at it, before he answered. “Yeah?” he said. It was obvious his voice hadn’t been used in a while.
, as he took his guns down off of the wall so he could start to clean them. This was going to be a long night.
“Cas?” he tried again. “Look…” Dean scratched his neck, a little unsure of how to proceed. “I’m sorry if I said anything wrong, Cas.”
Dean had been about to knock on his door, to both welcome him to the building but also to ask him to stop taking up so much hallway space, but when he got home from work he found the hallway missing half its boxes and thought he might as well just wait until the last boxes were removed than do anything about it himself.
Dean turned on the lights as he went to look out over the war table. He could hear Sam coming up behind him, and turned around to greet his brother.
For once it was Dean who said I love you first, and for the rest of the evening, peppering a laughing Castiel in small kisses.
“Dean, stop playing dumb. I don’t know why you ran off after kissing me, but obviously you didn’t think I would kiss you back. I
He vaguely heard Sam mutter an affirmative as he closed the door to the car and headed toward the door to the bunker. As soon as he put his foot over the threshold he breathed a sigh of relief.
“I always knew you’d go on to do something really smart, Cas,” Dean said, the nickname easily rolling off his tongue. “Pretty random that you ended up moving in right across from me, right?” Dean laughed.
I also know that the last few stories are different from the rest, but I hope you enjoyed them nonetheless.
Dean was exhausted after a long and tiring day, but when he caught the angel’s eyes he couldn’t do anything but stare right back. He was afraid that if he stopped looking Castiel might disappear, and so he invited him to join him on the bed.
“Huh,” Dean said. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from the paper. He made a grunting sound and rose from the bed without looking up. He couldn’t stop staring down at the paper he was holding, stunned speechless and mind numb.
These last couple of days had been rough on them, to say the least, and it was clear to Sam that Dean wasn’t in a talkative mood and that this would be a quiet ride home, except for the music blaring from the stereo. He took one look over at his brother, sighed, and then laid down to get some sleep. They had a long ride home after all.
He thought for an instant about the list still sitting in his Baby and before he could second-guess himself he leaned forward to press his lips against Castiel’s cold ones. It was a chaste peck of a kiss, but he still didn’t dare to open his eyes as he leaned back, in fear that Cas would open up his eyes, wide and shocked, and look at him with disgust on his face.
The tears began rolling down Dean’s cheeks as he stood there staring at the stone figure in front of him, still clinging onto him with one hand on his cheek.
Instead he went to his room, threw his duffle bag on the floor by his bed, and put his headphones into his cd-player to listen to Led Zeppelin’s
“Well, why didn't you sleep when I told you to?” Dean asked, taking one of Cas’ hands in his own, loving how close he could be to him after Cas had been sick in bed for three days, sleeping and grumbling every time Dean came in to place some soup next to him.
But when Dean turned to head back to his room, he found Cas leaning against the doorway, looking woefully at him.
Sam scrambled to sit up, and looked out of the window as he rubbed sleep from his eyes. “We’re here?” he asked, a little unsure as he squinted out the window.
A burning white light started to illuminate the space in his hand and Dean was staring now too, watching the light slowly morph into something else.
And two years later, you could still find Dean smiling when mentioning his husband or when Cas would smile at the waitresses noticing how their fingers were linked together, so that their rings clinked on the table. Dean knew everything about the love of his life, but he still wanted to learn more.
Calls were made to the extended family, Charlie on one phone, Mary on another, Bobby on a third. They were all elated to hear the good news, stating that there would be a welcome feast when they got home the next evening.
No one moved as Castiel turned around. The moment his eyes met Dean’s it felt like there was a rip in time. Sam could feel the tension of the moment hanging heavy in the air. He couldn’t believe it. There was absolutely no doubt. This was Cas.
Not long after, a door was shut down the hall, laughter and kisses exchanged. Cas couldn’t let Dean go again, tucking him down on the bed. It turned out, Dean didn’t need sleep as much as he thought. It could wait. Cas needed his full attention and Dean didn’t mind.
The more he stared into the face in front of him, the more he came to realize that he wouldn’t mind kissing Cas. He couldn’t think of a single reason why it should feel wrong for him to want to hold Cas’s hand. They were more than just best friends. Flirting with other people had always been fun and games with Dean, but he didn’t tend to just flirt with people for no gain, and damn, he had shot many flirtatious remarks towards Cas. He liked to wink at the guy to throw him off or confuse him, but if Dean was really honest with himself, he wouldn’t have enjoyed doing that with anyone else. For some reason the thought didn’t sit right in his gut and almost made him feel sick.
Dean had been driving all night and day, while Sam had slept soundly beside him. He was exhausted, but as soon as the Impala rolled down the road toward the bunker it felt like his energy was fully restored. He was home.
They only needed that one minute of silence looking at each other, before Dean was taking a step forward and Cas was throwing his arms around Dean’s neck.
Dean knew that Cas woke up early, refusing to come out of bed until he was presented with a warm mug of black coffee, and that he loved to watch Dean cook, but wasn’t good in a kitchen himself. After a long hunt he was all for cuddling and whispered secrets between the sheets, but when they had the bunker all to themselves and nothing to do, he liked to see old movies and listen to Dean’s commentary and laughing at dumb jokes. He wasn’t much for sex, but didn’t mind it when Dean expressed the want.
It had taken them a while to finally step away from one another, but they didn’t stop holding hands until they were standing right in front of the motel room. By an unspoken agreement they let go of each other when Dean took ahold of the doorknob and stepped over the threshold. His smile hadn’t lessened since Cas had uttered his name earlier and the rest of his family could see that something had happened as soon as they saw him enter the room, simply from the way his face was lighting up.
“Well, I was walking around town looking at available apartments, and it just so happened that I saw your name outside and I thought that maybe we could be friends again. I didn’t even know that you still lived in Kansas, but I’m happy you do.”
“Hell yeah, we’re here!” Dean answered excitedly. He turned the engine off, killing the light and enveloping them in complete darkness. He knocked a fist against Sam’s chest, unable to hide his thrill. “I’ll get the door, you grab the bags, okay, Sammy?”
“You’re family, Cas, you know that. We’ve all made sacrifices, but we’re here now and that’s what’s most important.”
Their initial shock of being caught in each other’s arms were evident on both of their faces, but it wore off as quickly as it had appeared. Without thinking about it Cas interlocked their fingers while bringing his hands down from his sides. When he had been turned back from stone the shadow of his wings had also disappeared and Dean needed to blink a few times to fully comprehend the now-normal, human-looking, very much alive Castiel standing right in front of him, holding his hand.
Dean wasn’t looking him in the eyes, but looking at everything else. Only when Cas quietly let out “Dean” did green eyes meet his.
Even though he tried being tough, and it had also taken him some time getting used to cuddling, he actually really liked it. He had tried denying to Sam that they cuddled at night, but then Sam had found them curled up on the couch wrapped in each other’s arms. It didn’t matter though. That was exactly where Dean wanted to be.
“Sam,” he said, his voice gruff from being unused. He couldn’t stop the big smile from spreading across his face, and he looked over at his brother in the passenger seat, who was still snoring lightly.
“Castiel,” he sighed. The look on his face was one of determination, as he stepped forward and closed the space of what little room there had been left between them. Instead of putting a hand on his shoulder as he tended to, Dean put a hand on either side of Castiel’s face, framing it and holding it in place, so there would be no more breaking eye contact.
It didn’t make any sense if Cas was alive, but that didn’t stop the hope from rising high in his throat. He felt a little teary-eyed himself.
Dean Winchester mattered. Casti- Cas mattered. He was Cas now. Human Cas, living in the bunker, boyfriend to Dean Winchester.
“Cas…” Dean felt bashful. He had to put a hand on the back of his neck to hide the blush he could feel creeping up along his shoulders. “Come on, don’t say that. We have such a good thing going on, you and I, don’t ruin it.”
He nearly made Dean crash to the floor, when he jumped into his arms and started peppering his face with small kisses. “Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean,” he said in a hoarse voice, like he hadn’t used it for all the time Dean had been away.
Castiel had fought off his spell with the rest of his grace, making him human. Now, even with the threat of the darkness waiting for them out there, Castiel had never felt as loved as he did now. It didn’t matter that maybe they could die tomorrow. What mattered was here and now.
Dean practically pulled Cas with him to their bedroom, Cas nearly falling asleep on his shoulder. In a few day, Cas would be better. Not grumpy, like-to-cuddle-under-seven-blankets Cas, because damn, Dean hadn’t even been sweating that much in Hell.
He parked the car and nearly ran back into the bunker. God, he had missed this place. And Cas. Always Cas.
“Dean, you don’t…” Cas glanced quickly up into Dean’s eyes. His eyes were filled with hurt and looked almost hollow in the dim lighting from the trees. “I don’t think you would understand it.” He was pointedly not looking at Dean, instead choosing to focus on a point somewhere past him. Dean didn’t know it was possible, but he felt a chill go through his bones, despite the fact that he was a little hot.
A raindrop fell on Sam’s hand. He slowly went over to them, the sound of his footsteps attracting their attention, and Dean finally let his hands fall to his sides, but didn’t remove his gaze from the other man.
here and that he was loved, until Dean cleared his throat and with a movement of his head gestured to the car.
“Cas,” Dean choked out, his voice filled with all the emotion he was feeling. “Cas,” he repeated, and absentmindedly lifted his hand a little, as if to reach out for the guy.
, their best friend, their brother, who they thought they would never see again, was alive and standing right in front of them. He couldn’t believe it.
Castiel patted him pathetically on the hand he had splayed out on the bar disk in front of him. Sam was still sat in a booth in a far corner of the bar, and both he and Castiel had been witnesses to Dean blatantly flirting with a girl and then her looking grumpily at him and stomping her feet as she walked away.
Castiel could only increase his speed and interrupt the demon's nasty mouth. He knew the other man was on the verge, and resisting the sourness of holding his mouth open for so long, Castiel tightened the hand circling the base of the man's cock while letting the cock fucking his mouth go in deeper, pressing it with his throat. Dean stroked Castiel encouragingly, yes, faster, let me cum in your mouth, the man mumbled these words vaguely, and his hips lifted upward in response to Castiel's movements. What finally released Dean was a heavy sucking, the sticky cum dripping down his throat, and despite his preparation, his inexperience caused Castiel to nearly choking down his windpipe, and he let Dean's cock slip out of his mouth before turning on his side and coughing violently, the milky liquid mixed with saliva dripping down the corners of his mouth and spilling onto the grass.
Everything happened as it should, they kissed each other hungrily, Castiel straddling Dean's lap, his shirt half unbuttoned and half ripped, even more, his trench coat was crumpled and tossed aside.
As if noticing my astonished gaze, Dean nuzzled at me smugly, "Ah angels, these feather heads are so sweet."
And what he felt now was nothing less than the day he saved Dean. Dean, clearly a master at sex, twirled his fingers, his wet index finger feeling around in his gut as if searching for something. Castiel felt him stroking from side to side, finally pushing to a certain spot, and that spot - Castiel was almost reflexively about to jump, a sobbing sound squeezing from between his throats -
"Yeah, and then I spent three whole days convincing him that building a long trunk for a whale wasn't a good idea."
Letting the hot water lap at his face, Dean touched the mark on his arm and could also feel the oldest and most primitive Mark of Cain responding positively to him with a warmth coming from his right arm. Since he became a demon, this seal no longer felt like a curse. He had gotten everything he wanted that the human Dean had never dreamed of; remembering the old days, he just wanted to laugh at that Dean, how much of a loser did he have to be to let that slutty angel's virginity be taken away by someone else? He even failed to touch Castiel's hand.
"It's a magic spell, you know, witches prefer to solve everything by magic than to fall in love honestly." That's what Crowley said at the time, he flicked the small bottle in his hand, the grace flowing brightly inside the bottle, the light that had coalesced into liquid form was just pinched in the hand by the corruption and filth of Hell, not caring if it was a blasphemy, "In theory, it will change Castiel and make him completely yours. But everyone is different, so I can't say what he will be like in the end. There are risks involved in using it, so I'm not responsible for any problems after use."
The bright, warm glow trickled into his mouth, and the last image Castiel remembered was something like the bright white of heaven.
"Say hello to Rowena for me." Castiel rolled his eyes at him, but finally smiled as he tapped a finger to Dean's lips, "Save it, you've taught me a lot more nasty things than that. Remember that time we travelled in Andromeda?"
After a long time, Castiel slowly sat up, cum dripping from his lifted legs and drawing special patterns on his firm thighs. He lay down next to Dean, his breathing still not completely calm, but looking much more awake.
It's just a legend handed down over many years, after the Winchester Gospel, the first chapter in the New Age Bible story where God calms the chaos of the world and all things fall into place, and the Father and Mother of Heaven create the angels who guard all living things on earth, and thereafter the world is as heaven on earth. It's not true, of course, but you know, these biblical stories tend to be written in a divine way (I had the privilege of coming into contact with a prophet who was, I'm afraid, the most biting person I've ever met, and I dare say it's in their nature). And the target of my trip - which now opened the door for me - was none other than the legendary pair who inhabited a planet called Earth, the Heavenly Father and the Heavenly Mother.
"You're distracted, Cass." The demon suddenly spoke, his tone much colder than before, "What are you thinking about?"
"Don't want to try something else? If you order something else, we can share a different main course." The demon suggested carelessly.
"You just want to see me continue to stare at the menu in confusion." Castiel muttered in a small voice as he shook his head, "Just order the same thing."
Perhaps my incessant internal ranting moved God (if such a thing exists), after ten minutes of walking aimlessly, a small wooden house standing by the lake caught my eye. I doubt that it can be called a house, it's so primitive that it can only be found in those archaeological programmes that Sofia loves to watch, in real life I've never seen such a dwelling. Outside the house was a small, flickering light, I couldn't even identify the fuel it was using, but the warm yellow light gave me a small sense of comfort. I approached the house, knocked gently on the door and waited politely at the entrance.
"Then sleep, Cas." Dean responded gently, "Just bringing you out to see that even angels shouldn't be nestled in their rooms and get mouldy."
"That little guy just likes to experiment." Dean let out a laugh as he stood up and grabbed an empty container from the rough and primitive locker and pulled a small knife from his trouser pocket, "I'm glad he's not interested in creating new creatures. Do you remember when he asked you why elephants couldn't grow fish tails?"
Perhaps it was the experience; my instincts, honed over years of being around the ladies, told me that I was perhaps intruding on their private time. Between their imploring glances, I raised my hand and harmlessly interrupted them before anything was irrevocably awkward, "Thank you, then perhaps I can go-"
"Cas, I really should have tried this six years ago." Dean withdrew from him without the obstruction and Castiel felt the semen flow out of him. A finger appeared out of nowhere again, happily pushing back the leaking semen. "Who would have thought we would have waited so long? It doesn't matter. I was stupid enough to not aware of this after all this time."
"Dean, I'm dying. It should be just in a few days." He said matter-of-factly, as if he was talking about nothing more than the stray dog they both saw in the parking lot yesterday.
"Baby, if you want my dick, this is not the way to go with this amount of determination." He pinched the man's chin, forcing him to meet his eyes. The man's - Castiel's - eyes were disoriented, the black pupils swallowing up most of the aquamarine irises, and he looked like his consciousness had gone to some unknown land, which Dean believed to be the case. Nonetheless, Dean still enjoyed the process of constantly stimulating him with words, and occasionally, Castiel's reactions would be interesting... Like now.
Castiel was dumbfounded. He turned his head to stare at the side of Dean's face, the demon's lashes having a long projection shadow in the sunlight, and he blurted out, "I only want to remember what's important, too."
It lasted for a while before he finally felt a moist liquid flow into his mouth. Castiel's breast milk tasted like almost nothing, and Dean let it flow and sucked out the other side of the lotion as he had done, satisfied to see them dribble lasciviously down the angel's chest and disappear into the padded nightgown beneath him. It was early days yet, and when a few more months had passed, his angel would have trouble keeping his clothes on in general without getting his chest wet. He loved that stage when Dean would demand righteously that Castiel walk around the house in nothing but a chatty bikini, or even shove a short, but vibrating bunny tail up his ass and watch his bunny girl hold his belly and get all wet up and down to make dinner for him.
Castiel did as he was told. Dean's finger carried a faint salty taste and seemed to have a hint of sweetness left over from the earlier jam, and he sucked eagerly, even eagerly moving over to swallow deeper when Dean pulled his hand out. The demon laughed again, a knowing laugh that was almost annoying, "That's not my dick, angel, don't be so eager to suck it. Don't worry, I'll give you that chance."
Castiel pursed up his lips. He moved his body back and knelt on the soft grass, propped his hands on the side, and raised his eyes to meet the demon's green eyes. Then on a whim, he took the other man's semi-hard cock in his mouth through the thick fabric of his jeans and retaliated by running his tongue over it, thoroughly wetting the crotch area. Dean took a deep breath and a swear word slipped out of his mouth, and Castiel smiled in satisfaction before he finally relented and unbuckled Dean's belt for him, peeling off his jeans along with his underwear and letting the pent-up cock hit him in the face.
Cocking his head at the odd satisfaction in his chest, Castiel lowered his head again, this time taking it a little deeper, swallowing Dean's cock as deep as he could until it rested against his throat. He tried to suppress the feeling of vomiting (a strange reaction he had never noticed in humans), and it was difficult for Castiel to move his tongue when his mouth was full, so he circled the base of Dean's cock for support and began to suck, mimicking what he had done with Dean during sex. With Dean's hand in his hair, he didn't force Castiel to do anything, but he would gently push or tug a little, showing the angel what was the proper speed. Castiel was a quick learner, and it didn't take long for him to master how to be at the frequency Dean liked, and he lifted his eyes, Dean was half-smiling contentedly, like a well-fed cat, making the purring sounds that only come from having his stomach scratched. He loved seeing Dean like this. The untimely feeling of jealousy swept over him again, he really didn't want anyone else to see this side of Dean, such thoughts didn't make sense, but he took it for granted that these gasps, these emotions should all belong to him, this was the man he was guarding. But he couldn't keep Dean any more than a man can catch a shooting star with a bug net.
"All right, your call," the demon retorted reluctantly, " Remember to put on your pants, even Hulk knows the courtesy of not showing off his lower half anywhere."
Crowley looked a little offended. He took two quick steps to get himself slightly ahead of Dean, "But it's not just about having fun! Think about it, with the power you have now, in Hell, you could totally train more Hell knights, Abaddon's men would be nothing more than a bunch of mindless flies, and we could easily regain control of Hell. By then, anything, and I mean anything, including the gadgets to charge your angels, will be within reach."
He stood for several minutes before turning off the shower, and when he was done cleaning he stepped out, his angel still naked, the body on the floor was gone, only ashes remained.
To say he didn't want Dean would have to be a lie he couldn't even tell. But what Castiel knew just as well was that if the mark of Cain hadn't temporarily turned him into a demon, Dean would not be as he was now, with his body pressed against his back and his cock rubbing against his leg. And by the time Sam found a way to cure him, he would have regretted it... Castiel bit his lower lip, dreading to imagine the pain and disappointment, or worse, the alienation and disgust, in the eyes of a sober Dean...
Castiel bit his lip. Then he lowered his voice and came up to Dean's ear as well, "I want you to put your cock in, leave me hanging hopelessly, and fuck me so hard that I'll still feel your cock in my belly by next Tuesday."
Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean's waist, and he buried his face in the demon's arms, "When you were lying here alone, did you ever think about running away? Away from your responsibilities? Away from it all?"
The grip on his hand relaxed a bit as Castiel built up the strength to turn his head sideways, "How do you ...... oh, Dean."
Dean responded vaguely. He hugged Castiel from behind and buried his nose between the angel's neck, inhaling deeply, "Cas, did I tell you today that I fucking love you?"
" It's very... Strange." Castiel commented hesitantly, "I can see your genitals. I can see how it pops out from between my legs, is that how it usually fucks me?"
The air pumped out of Castiel's lungs in a flash, and he blacked out, his consciousness lapsing, and eventually, all he could see were the black eyes of the demon. It was good that the last thing he saw was Dean, and that was all he wanted. The only regret was that the green colour that recurred in his dreams was nowhere to be seen, swallowed up by the darkness, along with himself into the stomach pouch of darkness and corrupted to nothing.
He was complete. No matter how much Crowley boasted, the truth was: Dean had no interest whatsoever in any Hell, or anything to do with world conquest. He had all he wanted, and now his dark-haired angel was pressing against him, seeing nothing but the longing in his eyes, and Dean believed that was what the other man saw in his own.
Castiel listened quietly, at this point no longer looking up at the sky, but instead examining the familiar face beside him. A face he could not forget.
He moved with difficulty. Needless to say, lust made this more difficult. Castiel tried to get the cock to slam into him in a regular rhythm, but his legs shook a bit, instead making this stimulation irregular and the pleasure almost overloaded him. After several attempts, his head was dizzy and his legs went weak, finally giving up on giving him any support, leaving Castiel to fall right into Dean's lap while being crushed by the feeling of the heavy impact of his penis in his body. He collapsed, bracing his hands on Dean's shoulders and nearly falling into the demon's arms. His cock trembled, some pre-cum seeping out, he was just reaching for it when his hand was once again grabbed by Dean and taken away with a force that brooked no resistance.
"The last time he was lying there half dead was because he needed the grace of an angel to charge him. Come on, you don't think any angels would voluntarily offer up their grace, do you? That stuff is not easy to get, and it took me a whole week to get my men to find a weak angel left on Earth. Even then, we had a lot of demons die to get this bottle of grace."
Dean tilted his head, he rubbed his face, the corners of his mouth hooked out a lazy smile, but no smile in his eyes, "You really should go."
It wasn't until he came under Dean's touch and was penetrated by Dean's cock that Castiel vaguely understood what more he was longing for. Human sex is different from bee pollination, and with every time Dean parted his body and incorporated himself into it, Castiel felt he was possessed. He let himself be owned by Dean, and at the same time, he seemed to own Dean. Sex is primal aggression, it is not violent, but possessive, and what he did not expect was that after so many years of misunderstanding and betrayal, suspicion and separation between them, he would be so happy to let himself be possessed by Dean, to submit to him, to be at his mercy.
Jack huffed out, his chest was heavy. Human emotions were hard to handle but he had to manage through. He nodded at Sam before he touched the taller hunter's arm. The Nephilim manage to teleport both of them to the correct place. He only can really hope that Amara is part of this because the worry in him will not go away, and it’s going to continue to eat him until he finally knows.
The Hunter’s fingers were closer to his mouth while he listened to the explanation about the idea of him carrying on even without the angel. That would've been hard to do. Dean felt a sharp sting with every single sentence, it felt like a blade slowly easing through his bare flesh every single second, and he would even know what it felt like. He wanted to leave the main part of the bunker right now. Dean watched Cas take a sip of his whiskey, Dean got up from his seat immediately, he moved the chair back in place. “I guess something to do with wanting to stay alive is all that would matter in this world” Dean simply said, he was about to kind of get angry, a bit more sorrowful than angry, he's quick with his movements, He literally was about to ramble on. “I thought-” Dean paused right there, he wasn't going to continue. His eyes were already brimmed with fresh tears and he wasn't going to break down then and there. Not in front of Cas. Even after everything, it was always about living, it was always about surviving, Dean tore his eyes away from the angel before he departed from the table. He's done for tonight. He got what he needed, and he thought he knew deep down. But it turned out, he was wrong the whole time. Purgatory, he wanted to say something, but he didn't get to.
Castiel is mad, his mind is going a million light-years worth ways, he feels like a cosmic being once again, not even the universe can comprehend how many emotions he is feeling. Envy for his dead self of his alternate version because that other version of him at least got to feel his lover closer, got to have to consent reaching out to embrace the man from the back without Dean turning at him gun pointing. Either that being mental or physical, he almost shot Jack and he had come back from the dead. Everything seemed to be better than now, times being confessing or committing into his heart's desires, his vessel's needs would not be wise especially with the fear of being beaten up. Because sticks and stones may break this body's bones apart but more emotional incrimination for something he has no control over would make things more complicated and painful, but one reason more for Cas to stay alive.
Throughout the rest of the night, Dean decided to stay in his room and pondered about a couple of things. Dean sighed to himself checking his laptop throughout the night checking if there's any important information about the world going to shit as it is, Chuck already destroyed a couple of planets, and it's going to probably get worse later on. Dean wondered why things never go as planned- other than his constant anger issues and all Dean genuinely doesn't know what to feel at this point. Yes, he was planned on getting drunk that night but he decided not to. Dean didn't sleep at least until four in the morning, and if Sam went on that case Cas referred to earlier. He didn’t go, Dean assumed Cas went with Jack and Sam
Dean's grin got wider, like this couldn't get any more painful than it would already be. He had no context about the deal and he wouldn't really know which is the main reason Dean may not understand this. “Yeah aren't we all?” Dean simply replied “Something personal, I wonder what that'd be,” The hunter remarked “After this whole entire thing with god being gone I thought we would get happier with this but it doesn't look like all of us have our minds set back in place” Dean started explaining “Talk to him? look, I've known I've been ghosting him and all but we- we can't. There are things we've done that we both weren't proud of but I wouldn't think anything we've done would be something we regret” Dean didn't say it directly- but this should be enough context. By things they haven't done, those were their proudest moments, that was Dean even trying.
He wished to ask and find clues over why Dean acted so happy but somehow his soul looks so hollow “Dean I-” he stopped there, asking Dean will not get him anywhere, Sam had taught Jack to never ask dean questions about his mental health, anything else that needed to be addressed Dean will talk about “How's Sam, have you talked to him today?” Jack lied, he knew exactly how Sam is, but anything to avoid the question that will get Dean to leave almost immediately
This moment he knew, Cas knew this would be both of their end, tragedy in the human perspective but no, this is no tragedy but actually pure consequences from the dozens of times they played with death,  with trying to defy reality, and what's there to be written. It’s what kept them going, what made them move away from the road that they have been forced to walk into.  He was a soldier, an angel of the almighty that ended up being nothing but someone he despises. Someone that now wants them all dead, someone that has made all angels, humans into chess pawns. Cas defied god, he fell from heaven..fell for someone, someone that is at the moment shocked and obviously terrified.  His green emerald eyes melting, Castiel can't stop looking at the scared hunter, he needed to help him snap out of it.
Dean tried to think, his thoughts are scattered but it's a simultaneous process there's no way he could start to think correctly and properly. The Hunter needed to think about what was really happening and the reality of it. He's accepted his death by Billie herself a long time ago but this one time, this one he doesn't want to. Dean is still speechless, there's so much stuff happening at once- he couldn't even process Cas's deceleration correctly, he finally looked at the angel after he gazed at Billie who walked slowly. Dean stared at Cas instead of Billie and he's still smiling but why is what the hunter is still wondering. He heard Cas say he wasn't going to die, not here, Dean already knows the reality of it and they're both going to end up killed one way or another but he's come to terms with what will come. What does Cas need to tell him? what is this one thing he keeps trying to tell him?. Dean felt Cas's hand on his face. He watched the angel place it onto his cheek and yes it shook with fear paired with the blood that still came out of his hand. He saw Cas was again about to finish what he wanted to tell him but he Saw Billie in his peripheral view he still looked at Cas, he was bracing himself. That was until Billie randomly disappeared
When the Angel walked down the hall he noticed both Dean and Sam talking to their other selves that ended up in the bunker. This caused Cas to stop and look at where the stairs for the exit. Castiel tilted his head with confusion looking at them four messes with someone's head. The Angel walked towards them a stood beside his world's dean, he doesn't know if they have their own version of Castiel, but if not, he could try introducing himself for good measures “Hello” he started off with before he shoved both his hands into his coat's pockets
but as it seems, it's not going smoothly...it looks like he is losing touch with Dean more than actually being here “Dean-” He spoke, he tried to get Dean's attention once the movie was over and the lights went on but the hunter had gotten up already and left. Cas had no choice but to follow him after that back to the car, the shameful expression on his face was obvious...Cas might be oblivious and Dean might not actually like him, moreover..he still remembers the day Dean said that he is like a brother to him, which broke his own heart into tiny shards, the small crack in his chassis got bigger and the love that's deep inside him begged for more, and still is..otherwise he would never allow what happened tonight in the cinema..even if occurrences like that is what his angelic heart desires, he must resist the happiness that is the man he fell in every possible way for years ago, the man that made him feel something
Sam Seeing them, seeing this alternative version of himself had brought more questions on the table. One of them was Chuck's mindset of how his little worlds work...and why would he create more? it scared the smart hunter to points of desperation and confusion, he was smart and had to find ways out. But somehow this god complex that is hovered around him, and with Dean getting worse he’s scared and doesn't exactly know where to begin anymore, but to wait for an outcome with a plan that makes him feel blind...Right now they are back from a mission and have to say goodbyes to their alternative selves. Sam found his other self quite amusing, but the man-bun he despises very much. When Sam walked into the main part of the bunker and saw his older brother speaking to them he thought of barging in. They both spoke to them for a while before he allowed them to leave “Hey.”  He said and looked at the original Dean before he placed his eyes on both the richer Dean and Richer Sam. It's so bizarre looking at yourself like that.
The current Dean looked over at both Cas and the other version of himself. Dean didn't have much of an opinion on all of this quite yet but, Dean stood there quietly crossing his arms, not to interfere of course. There's something in his stomach, It isn't a nice feeling but it's not something he should pay attention to. This will be over soon, there isn't anything to get upset about. Dean is more focused on the forgiving side than being the sad type at the moment. It seemed something about this interaction didn't feel right to him, but then again he's a man who represses his emotions all the time, so he isn't going to say anything. The only thing he could do is watch
He wanted to let Cas know how sorry he was, he wanted to apologize for everything he's done; from telling him he's the problem, from kicking him out of the bunker multiple times and the number of times, and how he didn't trust the angel. It wasn't the angel's fault at all, it was his and his anger that troubled his mind. By the end of the day, it was Dean’s fault and his fault himself. The only way he could diffuse the situation easily was to blame it on someone else. He can't control his anger and that's what fuels his hatred for himself. But god, god does he feel more guilt. “Cas I-” Dean was again about to say something, that was until he felt something. Dean hunched over violently with a pained noise that escaped his throat.
Dean swallowed deeply, he didn’t say much at the time but he knew something was going to go down. He'll need to act quickly. Dean looked over to Sam and Jack, this should be the queue to get to it. They don't have a lot of time, and he even knew god is being held in one of the rooms by Amara currently. He spoke to Amara a while ago and he trusted the darkness to not give into God's plan at most he hoped that She wouldn’t. Dean does remember that God wanted to start a life with Amara, one without pain and one without sorrow, Chuck was able to get Amara to merge with one another and create balance but that isn’t going to happen this time.
Dean watched Jack close the book, he had both of his hands on the chair in front of him. He had his hands propped there just looking around a little. He didn’t pop any other questions but Dean was actually happy that Jack would come with him. He removed his hands from the back of the seat and stood straight back up. “No, I haven't been able to get a hold of him in a whole week, He doesn't want to talk” Dean grumbled, he still sounded a little angry that Sam wouldn't talk to him, he isn't going to pay attention to that for a very long time, “I think this whole thing might level out over some time” Dean even knows deep down that's not the way it works- but he's trying to hope
The Angel’s eyes raised up towards Dean, if he thought Cas was oblivious of the temptation he just had to shove a piece of the pie himself would go unnoticed by Cas. He is naive and it sort of made the angel smile. As for the idea Jack threw out of the blue, it made Cas almost gasp but he only tensed up even more, the more the thought about though. The more he wanted to go with Dean...maybe he could insist “No, Dean.” He said, and after weeks of no words to each other, Castiel finally pushed himself to take a few steps closer to Dean, blue soft eyes focused on the man's calloused shaped face, a Greek God, a sculpture that was made to perfection...The angel has truly missed looking at the hunter's details “I'll go with you…” He said with a gentle voice, the same way he called out Dean back in the day, softly...lovingly even, Castiel's purpose was not to make things awkward but he wants to at least start talking with him again
Castiel knows this posture, this soft eyebrow movement this Dean makes because he has seen it before more than once. Every time he does see it, Cas knows Dean is not okay, he knows how ashamed of such emotions he has them buried deep down Dean feels right there and then. How devastated this man is right now, and the story on its own got Cas to feel strong chills. Like a feather caressing the line of his spine but instead, it felt like a sharp knife grazing his naked spine, it was so painful. Cas had the urge to look away from this Dean take a look towards his own but he couldn't. Cas is lost to every word this Dean said...he had to bury his other self, they were together, they loved each other, that brought a bit of hope in Cas but also questions. What would have happened if he were to take Dean's mark? would the outcome be this? Does his Dean even love him that way? because this dean loved him that doesn't mean his dean loves him. The differences between the two are tremendously huge.
