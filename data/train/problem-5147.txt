“Yeah. Well.” Older Dean opens his eyes and sighs again. “No use arguing with my pigheaded self, I guess. Let’s head on back. We’ll talk about this again, when it comes to it.”
Dean lets out a long breath. The stars have always filled him with a deep aching sensation he didn't fully understand. In Heaven, he thinks he does. What he was really feeling was the
"A year off? Like from hunting?" Dean raises his eyebrows, speaking through his mouthful of melted cheese. "Wait, what's YouTube?"

"That's, uh…" Dean is usually so good at being charming, at keeping the conversation going. Maybe that's the problem, that whatever this is, it's the opposite of small talk. "I guess it's good to know at least we've got you on our side, then. Um. What are we looking for, anyway?"
"You understand what you have to do," Cas says. It's not a question. "Seven doors, seven demons of your past, as it were, to conquer, before you can "set foot in the kingdom of the Lord."" Cas is getting better at air-quotes. "If you don't, you'll stay trapped here and your body will die."
"You have to understand that I'm much older than you think, Dean," Cas says. "I have existed for millenia. I have seen the best and worst of humanity. And you… You are the most caring person that I have ever known. You are so full of love, it spills over into everything you do. You care ferociously and with total disregard for yourself. You care about the world, about Sam, about Jack and me. You always do what you believe is the right thing, regardless of the consequences. Even when we have not agreed on what the right thing is, I have always admired your conviction. When I fell from Heaven, it was because I believed in your conviction of love and humanity. I do believe in it."
The part Dean
“It’s kinda heavy handed, considering the time it was written. Euphorion was writing during an age of pre-Socratic philosophy, which…” Sam glances at the blank looks on Dean and older Dean’s faces and says “Never mind. It’s probably not important. Anyway, they’re talking a lot about souls and the meaning of human life, but that’s like a whole separate part of the play that isn’t interacting with the main story. In the main story, some king of Crete sees Clesus in the woods and wants him to marry one of his daughters because he’s so pretty - which isn’t creepy at all. And obviously, Clesus is in love with Xerodicus, which was totally fine at the time, but also homosocial norms didn’t necessarily mean you couldn’t have male lovers and be married to a woman at the same time.
"Don't
"I'm just saying, you didn't like the future version you met of yourself either."
Dean pulls the demon knife out of the inside pocket of his jacket.
"Cas?" Sam prompts.
“It’s got the Enochian word for ‘echo’ inscribed on it,” Cas says. “Some other things I can’t read. It’s all burnt up.”
He knows that when he goes to check on the fragmented vase they’ve been keeping in the armory, a piece of it will be missing. Because this is the kind of shit Dean does, and he was saying goodbye to Sam the night before too. Sam had recognized the warning signs, but he thought Dean was just resigning himself to dying or at worst thinking about pulling some last minute martyrdom crap if their plan didn’t work.
Sam shakes his head. "He'll grow on you, I swear. But you're welcome to use the range if you want. Maybe, uh, give other Dean a little time to blow off some steam first."
Dean claps his brother on the back and lets go. “Yeah,” he says, thinking about how there hasn’t been a single demonic sign in three months and his tentative prayers to Jack seem to be floating unanswered in the ether. “Yeah, it’s weird.”
Cas blinks in surprise, which maybe should offend Dean but he's just too worn out to care. Cas turns to him and sees that he's crying, again, and he makes as if to reach out for Dean, but then stops. Like he's not sure if he's supposed to. Like he's not sure he's allowed to.
There is something hungry in Cas' gaze, but his eyes aren't trying to peel off Dean's clothes. They're going straight through him instead, like he wants to confirm that he knows Dean. Like he left a handprint on his Dean's soul and he wants to know if Dean can feel it too. It's weird and personal and Dean just doesn't know what to do with it.
“Yeah, okay.” Dean didn’t come here for an argument either. He looks down at Cas, at his handsome, tired face. He’s spent more of the last eleven years staring at this face than he cares to consider, but he never gets over looking at him. That alone should have been a big fucking warning sign in the beginning. “Listen, can we talk?”
“Oh hey,” he says. “What? Oh, yeah.” He looks down at himself and doesn’t look a bit self-conscious about his nice patterned apron. Dean has no idea how his brother does it, how Sammy has always just been so acutely himself.
"That's what it was like trying to teach you about being human." Dean chuckled.
Dean frowns at him. "Okay," he says. He decides not to bring up the fact that his only experience with video sharing websites in 2005 was to find free amateur porn in front of Eileen and Cas. "So you took a year off and taught yourself to cook."
"Christ." Sam leans forward and puts his face in his hands for a minute.
“I think, in order to get enough wood to make a shield, we would need one of the trunks,” Cas says a little sadly, gazing around them now too.
him like this. Not that Dean doesn't cry - he cries kind of a lot, actually, but mostly just around Cas, the fact of which he's always managed not to touch with a ten foot pole - but it's like Sammy ordering coffee for him the way Dean likes it even when Dean doesn't bother to make it for himself that way. It's sweet. Sappy. Kind. Whatever.
There’s John’s voice in his head too, derisive and disappointed. John Winchester never needed therapy. John Winchester only ever needed the mission.
He wonders distantly if he's so broken that even this most fundamental panic button doesn't work anymore.
“Dean…”
But there isn’t anything to say after that. Sam knows his excuses, and Dean is suddenly tired of saying them. He’s always tired.
Or it's like driving in the Impala, Sam asleep in the passenger seat, classic rock in the tape deck, nothing but the empty road stretched out before Dean, his heart full and beating in his chest as he speeds down the highway, letting him know he's alive.
And Dean… this isn't the first time grown men have said things to him. John's always leaving them at skeevy motels and hanging out in seedy bars. But it's the first time he's been cornered like this, actually been afraid. He slips his hand further under the pillow, but… Dean doesn't know if he could kill a human. He's already killed plenty of
"I'm going in after him."
John punches the wall, and twenty-two-year-old Dean jumps. Now-Dean winces at how painfully obvious his past self is, how like a dog just waiting to be kicked.
"What?" Cas' glare deepens.
Sam laughs as he leads Dean up a flight of stairs. "Oh man. I don't know where to start unpacking that. Yeah, Cas lives with us. Most of the time, anyway. He's, uh, a friend. Our best friend, honestly. And I'll tell you what he is, but you're not going to believe me."
Sam hadn’t said anything when they’d been in Arizona that weekend, and Dean honestly couldn’t tell if he was thinking about it or not. It was Sam’s Heaven, after all, or it had been. Dean has wondered for a long time if those memories of freedom and autonomy are still part of what Sam’s Heaven would look like now. Dean is too scared to ask, to find out if he’s given Sam enough in the last fifteen years to at least make it into his repertoire of best memories as more than a conspicuous absence.
Dean scowls at him. "Oh come on. You and Sam keep saying that, but it's not like the guy's feeling too chatty towards me. This is your relationship or whatever too, how come I've got to hear it from future me?"
me," older Dean spits out, straightening up from the wall and taking a step towards Dean. "I told you. I fucking told you not to go off -"
Jack just frowns harder.
The last time Dean had seen Sam was probably the worst night of his life, truth be told.
big question, really. The whole friggin’ A plot of Chuck’s show, and subsequently Dean’s life, and no matter what else happens for the rest of his life, Dean is pretty sure that he is always, always, going to be looking out for his baby brother. It doesn’t even matter, in the end, if that was how Chuck made him. How John made him. It doesn’t matter, because Dean loves Sam, and that love is still
"Yeah, well, 'Apocalypse Me' was a dick."
about it no matter how much Sam pokes at that door, but it's true. There is barely anyone who's ever loved Dean who hasn't also put a fist in his face. And yeah, yeah, Bobby was possessed, and for the worst times Sam had been hopped up on demon blood or was being ridden by Lucifer, and Cas was being frikkin' mind-controlled by Heaven, and dad was sometimes drunk… but sometimes he wasn't. And Dean and Sam have punched each other up pretty good all on their own. And Cas beat him up in an alleyway years before the crypt. And Dean has started some of these fights, he's deserved some of them. Even now, what he's doing here, the way he treats Cas and Sam and Jack, he knows it's too close to all the parts of John he was afraid of growing into. He wants to stop hurting his family, wishes he knew how to stop, but this freight train just keeps barreling forward and Dean gets pissed or scared or stuck inside himself, and he lashes out all over again. Not physically, maybe, but it isn't the bruises on his body Dean remembers most anyway.
to look out for him. He just… sometimes he just wasn't big enough or smart enough.
Dean does what he has to in order to survive or to take care of his family. That's it. What he wants, especially what his body wants, doesn't really factor into the equation.
"Dean," Cas had whispered, his voice so full of that same undone wonder that Dean felt a stab of guilt that he'd made it impossible for Cas to voice his feelings.
"No," younger Dean murmurs, pushing weakly at Cas' hand. "Cas, don't. This is too much."
And what does that mean, anyway, if they were in love with each other the whole damn time?
Dean finds his younger self down in the gun range. He's about as good of a shot as Dean, honestly. Dean puts on a pair of noise-cancelling headphones and joins him, and for a while as both of them empty clips into paper silhouettes there isn't a thought in Dean's head.

Watching John die this time, though, Dean's barely even there.
Sam's face - all that gentle fondness and recognition had felt like a slap. And Cas…
Sam puts in Celine Dion’s
"Home sweet home," Dean had said sarcastically, spilling his bedroll onto a less-grotty bit of living room floor. "I'll see if I can get the power back online."
Dean looked up at the back of his father's leather jacket. It shouldn't have stung after all this time, but it did.
or perhaps
Dean sighs and lays his head down on top of his arms on the table. “Cas. We’ve been over this. The whole point of kicking you under the table is subtlety. You’re rambling again, man.”
Dean repeats his apologies in sobs as Cas coughs and sits up, massaging his all too human neck. He keeps saying it over and over as Cas kneels in front of him and pulls him into his arms.
Cas puts one hand on Dean’s jaw, cupping his face, the other on the small of Dean’s back, pulling him close, so Dean loops his arms around Cas’ neck and pushes both hands up into his windswept hair. Cas’ hand on his cheek is warm, his calluses rough
So Dean hasn't dealt with this moment before it arrived. All of a sudden, he's sitting in a therapist's waiting room with the faux-calming soft jazz pricking at his nerves, about to sit in front of a stranger who will probably expect him to talk about his parents and childhood and sexuality or whatever, and he's looking down at an intake form boldy asking him a series of questions he's never answered in his fucking life.
"I have something I need to tell you both," Sam says. He twists his hands together before tucking them behind his back.
Dean has to bite his lip and breathe for a second to get himself under control. "It's what?" he asks in a forcibly level voice.
The poem is
Turns out maybe Sammi was right all along. Dean's not good at letting go of things. Even in Heaven.
"Dean," Cas says, eyebrows raised. "I trust your perspective on our living arrangements. If you think you could be happy here, then I will be happy here. I don't know anything about 'househunting.'" Cas lets go of Dean with one hand in order to make air quotes and Dean feels his mouth twitching out of habit.
Dean takes off his flannel and hangs it over the bedpost. He strips off his t-shirt too, folding it automatically. He doesn’t let himself shake. He’s not a fucking baby. He deserves this. He’s earned it.
Cas, who has emerged from the shelves to peer critically at Dean, looks entirely unscathed. His blue eyes rake over Dean, full of a deep concern that Dean is just… he's not used to this much care and attention from anyone.
Hank, as usual, is silent for a moment in the wake of this statement. “Why is it on you?” he asks finally.
"Uh, no," Sam says. "No. I just. Uh. I like your shirt."
Dean knows in a detached sort of way that being four years older in traumatizing circumstances does not the most stable parent make, knows that he's not a kid anymore, but he remembers all of the ways he's failed Sam and it makes his gut clench and twist. He remembers shoving Ben, remembers the desperate grief in him when Ben and Lisa were hurt, that desperation that drove him to make such an invasive, unconscionable decision to wipe their memories. He remembers how deeply he had known, in his bones, that they would be better off without him.
But this Sam just keeps crushing him in his arms, and he smells like off-brand shampoo and the Impala and, just, like Sammy. It's weird and a little awkward, and it makes Dean feel small. It makes him feel like there's a hook in his chest.
“Why not?”
is one of the deepest and most desperate desires of his heart.
“Hey,” Dean says to Jack, who is sitting at his computer at the kitchen table again, watching traffic cams for reasons Dean can’t bring himself to ask about. “I know we’re in the middle of nowhere, but besides the bar we went to, what is there to do around here?”
Mary hugs Dean with all the familiar strength and he holds her tight, closing his eyes and breathing in the smell of his mom.
Sam laughs a little. “I will be. Next time I see you, just call it when you want it. We owe you.”
something like
It's not fair. He didn't ask for this. He was coping fine. It should get to be his choice, one goddamn thing about all of this should get to be his choice, and that agency has been ripped away from him again, his darkest parts split open and his insides turned out without his consent.
at all. Cas used to think that this shame was about wanting things with another man, and that’s a part of it, but he suspects that Dean’s relationship to his own desires is warped beyond sexual orientation or intimacy.
But Sam cracks the door to Dean's room open, and it's just his brother there, chest heaving, fighting against something Sam can't see, and Dean made him promise, made Sam swear after the last time that Sam wouldn't try to wake him anymore.
It was a handful of touches in quiet mornings in strangers' living rooms, before Sam woke up, gruff whispers telling him to be careful not to wake the baby, or being groped in the dark corner of a bar when he went out to hustle pool money, or a hunter as old as their father with tobacco on his breath whispering all the things he'd like to do to a pretty boy like Dean for a full half hour before John had come back.
A little while later, Cas let out a deep sigh and made to get up. Dean’s hand shot out, catching his arm.
And, because apparently Cas’ world had tipped upside down, Dean had let Cas hold him. Dean
Jack beams at him.
Before anything, Dean still feels the need to hold him, to make sure Cas is solid and, well, not
They can't make him do this.
And then…
Things had been bad since Sam left. There was a hollowness where he had been, a look to the left always expecting to find him there having their backs. Dean had gotten used to their father's abandonment, because there wasn't anything else he could do about it, but Sam… Dean would never have left Sam. Never. Not after everything they'd been through. Finding out that Sam didn't feel the same had been a low blow.
Cas kissed him everywhere. Dean’s skin was warm to the touch, but he shivered under the brush of Cas’ breath, making little noises every so often that Cas couldn’t quite identify. He wanted to learn them. He wanted to memorize every inch of this man, every sound he made.
“I’m fine, Jack. Just… A bit stretched thin.”
"Dean," Sam says, half-rising. "I didn't think you'd wake up for hours. How are you feeling?"
Eileen shakes his hand, beaming.
Cas clears his throat. His eyes are slightly wild. "I…" he tries, then starts again. "Dean, I'm sorry."
Dean snorts. He wants to say something stupid and mean, like that at twenty-six years old he was basically clueless, that he has no idea what's ahead of him. But of course that's the point.
“Not right enough.”
And to Dean, who still isn't feeling anything, this actually makes sense. Sometimes there is an automated survival in the numbness, and sometimes Dean would rather sink into it than feel anything, but…
“Okay, thanks. Same to you, kid.”
Dean looks away from the beauty surrounding them and stares at Bobby. “Jack did all of this?”
Sam would have been guilty too, would have blamed himself for Dean putting his neck out to protect him, Dean taking the brunt of John’s anger for Sam running away.
John comes down from the rage and fear, and instead of burning hot the way he does when he’s drunk, he becomes like ice.
I was doing the right thing, but I know what a hypocrite that makes me. I mean, Jesus, Cas, there's so much blood on my hands sometimes I think another hunter ought to just take me out."
"Are you going to tell me what's going on here?"
“Yeah, sure, Cas.” Dean is a little disappointed that it doesn’t look like there’s going to be a fight. He keeps an eye out as they walk anyway, looking out for anything following them, because it just feels too easy.
John looks up, finally. His face gets blotchy when he's mad-drunk. "Excuse me?"
“Look, you know I’m no good at this. Talking. Feelings. Any of it. I’m not… I don’t know, man. Something’s broken in here, and I don’t know how to fix it. I never have. You know me, it’s like my anger. I don’t know where it comes from or why there’s so much of it inside of me. I don’t know when to put it away.
Dean is used to taking orders without question. He figures if there's a reason behind his dad's authoritarian doctrine, there's probably much more to God's.

Is this what he wants? Him and Cas, business partners, the other kind of partners?
Dean had forgiven John because it was easier, because it hurt less, because Dean had to hold on to the idea that someone loved him. It was easier, if being hurt was his fault. He’d internalized all of it, vacuum-sealed all that pain and fear and betrayal into his core.  There’s no fucking way he’s unzipping all of that after ten minutes of angelic headshrink bullshit, but…
Sam says it's partly to do with whatever new system Charlie and Garth have got going on, partly a general decline in monster stuff since Chuck's been gone. Dean doesn't know anything about the new hunter network - he could ask, he supposes, if he wanted to. He and Charlie video-call about once a month, but they talk about music and books and the new
Dean's not sure how he feels about this, honestly. He's never really been a believer, but there was always a certain comfort in thinking about good people going to Heaven and bad people going to Hell. He's not sure he can get behind this idea that there is no inherent moral value to the soul.
Sam blinks down at the screen, typing out a quick reply before he shoves it back in his pocket.
Dean tinkers there occasionally, finding himself turning up whenever Bobby needs an extra pair of hands. Some indeterminable time after their last roadhouse dinner, Dean shows up early in the morning and habitually starts cleaning up the tools Bobby's left out. He's run a rag over everything and just slid under an old 1955 Ford F100 when the side door creaks and he hears Bobby's familiar heavy footsteps.
That's the
Dean is aware that he's an alcoholic, he just doesn't see the problem. It was the same with John, the same with Bobby. Same with Ellen. If you make it past a certain age as a hunter, Dean figures, that's your reward.
"I'll be fine," Sam says. This is almost always a lie, but he's used to saying it. "We've taken bigger risks."
Cas gives him a tiny, fond smile. "I know you do. I suppose I am rather more attached to
"I'll take a piece of the marionberry pie, please," Dean says, giving her the same easy smile he flashes at every waitress, before he remembers Cas is watching him. The smile falters a bit. His default, his defense, is to flirt. But it feels wrong in front of Cas, somehow.
Rhonda just laughs some more and shakes her head as she sees them out the door. “Give my best to Sam, and the rest of the family. Be sure to pop back in here when you’re on the road again.”
Older Dean leans an elbow against the doorbell, and now-Dean knows, remembering forward again, that he has keys to this place, but his hands are full.
me?! When have you ever protected me and Dean from anything?"
Everything Dean thinks he's getting a grip on the situation, he ends up staring at Sam in another level of disbelief.
"Cas?" Sam prods again. He tries not to needle Cas or Dean about their relationship because it's like poking at an armed explosive device, but there are times when it's just ridiculous that Sam has to pretend not to know about them.
"Hey, bud," older Dean says, one hand gently touching Cas' face. "Hey, you with us, Cas?"
Cas turns his head back to look at him, the lines in his forehead wrinkled in confusion. “What about me?”
Dean stops. Cas tries to piece together what he's saying, but he's drawing a total blank. Dean is still near enough to smell - gunpowder, whiskey, and leather seats. Dean always smells like the job.
Cas didn’t know at the time that this was the kind of question that people in relationships ask each other, the same way he didn’t imbue any extra meaning into the way Dean had started to turn to him sometimes on long drives and ask him what he was thinking.
"I'm gonna make it real nice for you, promise," Dean mumbles into Cas' hair. He's been
Now-Dean watches demon-Dean look up at Crowley and smirk, watches Crowley's smug smile in response.
Cas sighs and shifts a little, somehow wrapping even tighter around Dean so that he is basically sinking into the crack of the leather seats.
“He was doing the best he could,” Dean says, as the air around them turns hot and arid, a shimmering asphalt parking lot forming beneath their feet. The words come out rote, the line he’s said a hundred times. Dean believes it. In his heart of heart, he truly believes John was doing everything he could to protect his boys, raise them right. It’s just…
"Yes," Cas says. "This was a sacred place. A place of worship."
Of course they did, though. Dean and Charlie cannot possibly fill that role and Sam's involved, but he's not always around to offer his sad, understanding eyes. Plus, Dean is good at finding the kids who've been through the worst, and he's not self-centered enough to think that he can really help them with their trauma. Not in that way.
“No.”
When the water started to run cold, Dean turned it off and stood up. He nearly blacked out from the effort, grabbing the shower door frame for balance and wanting desperately to dry heave again. A little while and some dizziness later, Dean pulled dry clothes from his duffle onto his still dripping wet body. He left the wet clothes in the shower, left the puddle of vomit on the living room floor. He took what was left of the Jim Beam, even though it made him queasy to look at it.
Flying down the Kansas roads on a BMW R 69 isn’t the same thrill as stabbing a monster, but it lets him feel less like his skin is crawling.
Dean nods. He figured as much. "But, eventually…"
"So do you just know, like, all the languages?" Dean asks Cas.
"You really don't sleep? Ever?"
"You feeling okay?" Sam asks, his brow all furrowed, puppy-dog eyes wide and concerned.
The look on Cas' face is worth how stupid and vulnerable Dean feels echoing his words back to him.
Dean sniffled into the fabric of Cas’ dress pants. “You know, most people just say ‘it’s okay’ or ‘there, there,’” he said, a little wetly, not raising his head.
Older Dean blinks and stares at him blankly for a couple of seconds. “Huh indeed,” he says finally. “I thought you’d be freaking out more.”
Dean had stayed silent on the line for probably a full minute. Sam had waited, just breathing with him.
It burrowed inside him.
On days when Dean works at the hospital, or just knows he's going to be standing a lot, he wears a knee brace on his left leg. Dean's not self-conscious of it at work, he secretly thinks it looks kind of cool against his scrubs, but he left it behind for the case. No good circling your weaknesses with a nice target if you can avoid it. One kick to the damn thing, and Dean thinks he'd probably go down.
Cas shrugs. He’s smiling. “Something like that. I’m here to take you on, at any rate.”
Cas thought about the request seriously. “I don’t know that any of them were boring, Dean.”
Dean’s looking at the floor, refusing to cry, hating himself. He nods. “Yes, sir.”
“I’d like you to try, Dean,” Cas says, quiet, gentle. “I told you once that you deserved to be saved. I think that now, difficult as it may be, you deserve every chance to save yourself.”
The now-Dean being hit by these memories, bombarded with them one after another, feels Cas shift uncomfortably beside him, but Dean keeps his eyes on the burning god-Castiel of his memory and they don't speak.
There's probably a joke in there about popping cherries, and Dean is just putting his mind to the task of pulling it together, when Cas steps right into Dean's personal space and Dean's breathing seems to go completely erratic without his control.
“Huh,” Deans says, not moving from Cas’ chest so that his mouth tickles the fabric of Cas’ shirt. “Sometimes I forget, you know.”
It is unbearable.
raise a kid - he can't bring a child into this world. Not like this. Probably not ever. He's too… he's fucked up. And the world's fucked up too. And all Dean can see, looking at this baby, is the look on Sammy's face when he'd dropped dead on his knees that first time.
Dean shoots him a scowl. "Oh come on. It's a movie franchise about space and droids. Leave proselytizing out of it."
Dean doesn't remember his dad changing this fast.
"Jesus fucking Christ," younger Dean says into the table.
Cas surveys him for another moment and then nods slowly. "I'm afraid I'm a rather poor viewing companion, but of course. I'd be glad to join you."
But so much for that.
Dean nods, quiet for a moment as he digests this. When he was alive, he was angrier. Angry enough to think that maybe there were souls that deserved endless torment. But he still remembers Hell. Not just what he did there - and if any soul is stained, surely his is one of them - but who he did it to. Some of them were so young. He remembers that. Surely, they had died too young to have proven themselves so unworthy of Heaven.
"Dean…"
“You said some things last week that I’d like to come back to,” Hank starts with. “Why don’t you tell me a little bit about your relationship with your brother Sam?”
Cas tried to explain this to Dean, to Sam, to Jack, but each of them in turn had rolled their eyes or agreed dismissively without really understanding the impact of this statement.
“Oh.” Sam is quiet for a second. “Oh. Fuck. I didn’t think about that. Are you…?”
The quiet absence is too much to take again. Dean can hear his own heartbeat in his ears. He tries turning on Guns N’ Roses but that only makes it worse somehow. Deans sits on the bed and just tries to breathe, but he can’t stand it. He slides to the floor.
When Dean reaches the part about Alistair offering him a way off the rack, his voice breaks and he has to put his head in his hands for a moment. He tries to keep going, not because he wants to talk about it, but because he thinks Hank has a right to know who Dean really is, but he can’t seem to make his voice work.
Dean opens his mouth to say that he was never a child, that it doesn’t matter, but the old tagline gets stuck in his throat.
Dean and Sam exchange glances. Cas is looking at the woman with a slight furrow between his brows.
"Cas…"
So I just let him and I never told anyone.”
It's Sam's turn to laugh in disbelief. "Easy? None of it's easy. Did you not hear me before? Of course I'm always waiting for shit to go sideways. Every fucking day. That weighs on me as much as you. But, look, there are things that help, it's just, you're not…"
Dean doesn’t forgive himself for the things that he did. He is never going to feel absolved. But at least he can separate Hell Dean from the choices he makes in his life. A man does desperate, horrible things in eternal damnation.
Dean digs in his wallet for the small wad of cash he has in there, but Cas is already handing over a credit card. When he notices Dean's raised eyebrows, he shrugs a little apologetically.
"It's cruel. You shouldn't have to bare your soul like this. You shouldn't be forced to relive your trauma or talk about it until you're ready. That should be your choice, even if you're never ready. It's not fair, but you can do this. I know that you can."
Dean lets out a humorless laugh. "Or what, Sam? We get distracted from our impossible task of fighting God? I hate to break it to you, but losing Cas again doesn't change a damn thing about how hopeless this is. I mean, we're crazy! We're fighting
“All I want to ask you is how you would feel about what you’ve just seen if these events were something that had happened to Sam instead of you?”
And if Dean had nuzzled his face deeper into Cas' chest, well, who was ever going to know?
So this is Heaven.
It was a dusty sort of path, this particular part of the forest being close to the semi-desert climate of red rock and sagebrush. The trees were hardy things here, growing more sparsely than Cas had anticipated. Millions of years watching over this planet and there was still so much of it that Cas had never really experienced.
They pass the afternoon like this, and it's really fucking nice. Dean's a grownup now with an apparently limitless credit card so when they come to the first of the overpriced food carts scattered along the path, he stops and buys a churro for him and Jack to share. It's messy and delicious, and there's something simplistic and delightful in licking the cinnamon-sugar mixture off his fingers. He catches Jack copying him and it makes his chest feel weird and warm.
Constantine's hands are warm and he tastes like whiskey as he lays Dean down on the couch.
Now-Dean swallows, hit with the nostalgia of it, with how beautiful she is. God. He hasn't thought about Cassie in a long-time. Years, probably. He doesn't let himself think about any of this stuff. Maybe that's what this ward is trying to tell him.
"You're being ridiculous." Cas does that shifty, squinting sort of thing with his face. Dean jabs a finger in his chest.
Dean's stomach drops and he wipes grease off his hands on a rag, a gray smear lingering on his fingertips. "Hey," he returns. He tries to school his expression into something bland and neutral.
"But what if we do?" Jack says stubbornly. "We wouldn't give up our Dean for this one. Would we?"
"But mostly me," Dean finishes for him, still with no emotion in his voice. He's looking for one, he really is.
"Thanks," Dean says, offering him his most rakish smile. He stops himself from adding a sarcastic "sweetheart", but only for Sam's sake.
"Ha!" Dean pokes Cas in the chest again. "I knew it! You fucking asshole, you
Asking the question is admitting just how lonely he’d been back then - how starved for any drop of affection. Of course he’d fallen for Cassie, when she was the first person to really
The reason they’re always watching, waiting, never able to relax, is because to be a hunter means knowing that any day could be your last, any job could be the one that takes you out. It could have been anything, anytime, any place.
Something about that sound made Cas’ chest ache in a way that felt all too human. He cupped the hand on Dean’s side to the shape of his ribs, thumb tracing along the bone. Cas let go of his book and pushed his other hand into Dean’s hair, already rumpled from tossing and turning.
Dean can tell that Sam is giving him a weird look in his periphery.

Dean rushes after him, gun still loose in hand, and catches the door before it closes. Sam looks back at the foot of the steps and pauses, but they don't say anything, just look at each other in the full dark of evening.
"Dean, of course it does. It's got everything to do with everything. How do you think we got here? We've both been through so much shit since, but just because we went to actual Hell, that doesn't erase what came first. And I think… sometimes I think that, like, every shitty awful thing, every apocalypse and loss and torture, that's happened in the last eleven years, I dealt with as an adult, right? And that doesn't make them less intense or scarring, I guess, but I had the - the coping mechanisms or whatever to make sense of what I'd been through. But the shit we went through as kids… I didn't have any context, any idea of how to process. Everything was so raw and - and foundational. Growing up the way we did
“Hey Sammi,” Dean says. He embraces Sam, and they hold each other more than they hug. The last time Dean held his baby brother like this was when he was dying. Before that, probably when Sam was five or younger.
Dean closes his eyes and tries to think about nothing but the darkness, the quiet, the softness of his mattress. Not Heaven, not Hell. He has this horrible feeling in his stomach like something is coming - a feeling he has more often than not these days. There's so much shit to wade through here in this life.
Dean is the only person Cas has ever really been able to do this with.
Soon, Dean was snoring lightly, his shoulders finally relaxed, his face softened in sleep. Dean's raw soul was beyond physical attributes, but Dean the man, the whole of him, was beautiful.
It doesn’t matter. Dean can’t say it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Older Dean just turns away and starts plodding up the rise. Cas shoots an apologetic look over his shoulder as he follows him.
Sam narrows his eyes at Dean because he knows his brother, and this is not the way he acts when he is just trying to be nice. This is Dean
In spite of himself, Dean turns around to see Sam's expression. It's less surprised than Dean would have liked. "He told me he loved me, and then he died, like everyone else who’s ever given a damn about us. Mom, dad, Jesse, Bobby, Cas, Kevin, mom again.”
“But why?” young Dean asks. He sounds annoyed, more than worried. “This is stupid. Why would he…” he trails off, eyeing Jack with too much shrewdness for Sam’s liking. “Ah. Is this about whatever it is y’all don’t want to tell me about Jack?”
Sam pushes Dean into taking Jack out to the local bar one night. His brother is obvious about it, but he doesn’t need to apply much pressure. There’s a little bit of tension there, between Dean and Jack, but Dean thinks he likes him. He’s certain that he likes Jack when he agrees to Sam’s meddling and they actually make it out to the bar.
"I'm not his keeper," Cas says testily, not meeting Sam's eyes, his hands gripped too tight around his mug.
“And that’s kind of how it ends.” Sam shrugs. “I don’t know how much of it is historical, but he makes a reference to “black-eyed” creatures beneath the earth a couple of times, and talks about losing his soul after Clesus died, so it sounds a lot like Xerodicus might have made some kind of deal.”
Dean watches Cas lean against the rail that looks down on the sunken enclosure, tipping forward with his head tilted to one side.
Dean is going to fall in love with Cas. Dean is going to want him. Maybe even to need him. It’s love crossing time - it is, it was, it will be. It’s more profound than Dean knows how to deal with, more powerful than he can deny right now.
Jo comes over some afternoons and they play cards on the porch or she lets him teach her how to grill, or they just drink beer and watch all of the little growing things in Dean's yard. It helps to have someone who feels like a little sibling.
and he let it go because he was barely keeping his own words in by then.
"Cas, this is taking too long."
“Cas, you absolute legend. I’m so proud of you.” Dean grinned at him. “I know, I know. You saved an innocent life and it was harrowing and you did good, but please tell me I’m allowed to be proud of your sheer cosmic chaos.”
They leave the bunker on a drizzling day in June. It should be more momentous than it is, but the fact is that other people have been bustling in and out for weeks and it's started to feel like someone else's place already.
“You try explaining Sukkot or Tu B'Shevat to your classmates," she says. "Trees and Judaism is a whole thing."
, Crowley told him once. That's Dean's whole M.O. right there. His two fundamental truths are that it is his job to save everyone, and that no matter how many people he saves it will never change the fact that he is 90% crap.
“Yeah, okay, buddy. Take all the time you need.”
Hank nods, but he says “Aren’t there others doing it? Hunting, that is.”

"Sam."
"Yeah." Sam can't bring himself to get up. He feels like if he can't actually wake Dean, the best he can do is stay near him. He hates leaving Dean.
“Can’t believe you two are signing up to do it all over again,” Dean says lightly, elbowing his brother in the side to be clear that he’s teasing. “You’re already too old to be running around after Jude.”
Humans, though, have so many gendered words. In some languages, the word itself may have an explicit gender but the object carries little or no connotation. In others, like English, many words have a hidden gender, invisible, something you have to have a  deep cultural knowledge of to understand.
"Yes, ma'am," older Dean says, and his flash of charm is more genuine than usual. "Insurance claims don't file themselves."
It starts to rain as he stands there, a light warm summer rain with the sun still shining through the clouds, turning droplets into sparkling dew as it settles in the flowers and his hair.
Sam can't repay that. He can't forgive that.
"Dad," Dean says, trying to keep his voice rationale instead of pleading, desperate.
"Not like this," Cas says. His stupid, gravel voice comes out even hoarser than usual. "Not as a way for you to hurt yourself. I won't be that for you."
“Do you want to go into town tomorrow? I need more diatomaceous earth and the dogs are almost out of food.”
Sam puts on the kettle, ignoring Dean's muttered "okay, grandma," as Dean pulls a beer out of the fridge and settles on a stool at the breakfast nook. Sam has a small collection of teas that he and Cas hide from their Dean - too many pranks have been made to trust him with their loose-leaf - and Sam settles on rooibos.
"... Was that a yes, Cas?"
“Albert Einstein played piano to worms,” Cas said haughtily, and Dean didn’t have any argument to that so he’d just built him a gazebo to keep the rain off.
"Yeah. And then he told me didn't care what I did with myself so long he didn't have to know about it and I didn't get AIDS, because I'd be no use to him dying out in a hospital somewhere."
There is an aggressive knock on the motel door and forty-one year-old Dean doesn't really need to check the peephole to know who is standing on the other side. He opens the door with a sigh.
"It should be me. Dean would want it to be me."
“Yeah, okay, but, Dean, don’t you think maybe that was more about how we grew up then about school itself? You’re emotionally dense about a lot of things, but don’t try to tell me that you’re not smart. Moving from place to place, never staying anywhere longer than a few weeks, getting dragged out on late night stake outs with dad, or having to worry about me, or working any odd jobs you could find after school… Don’t you think that might have had a little something to do with it?”
Sam gives a tired little laugh. He's abandoned his own beer. "Not an angel. Angel. From Buffy the Vampire Slayer?" When both Dean and Jack tilt their heads at him, Sam sighs. "Look, it's just, in Buffy, the character named Angel is cursed to lose his soul after a moment of true happiness. And that happens when he and Buffy, you know…" Sam glances at Jack. "Uh. Make love."
But Older Dean just parks the Impala in a spot outside the building and unlocks its front door with one of the keys on his keychain.
Dean shakes his head. He closes his mouth and turns away from Sam, that goddamn weight back in his stomach, heavier than it’s been in months.
But Dean can't. He can't do this with Sam watching. It's too intimate, too vulnerable, too needy.
"It's 5:00 somewhere."
"Not from me or from anyone. You have always and will always deserve salvation."
Dean smiles a little, touching the grace beneath his shirt self-consciously. "I imagine you will, eventually."
They come up the stairs into a huge living room with hardwood floors and furniture that looks like it's been set up for researching. Books and newspapers are scattered across various surfaces, Manila folders stacked on coffee tables and dusty volumes left piled in an armchair. The living room opens out into the dining room/kitchen area and Dean feels a stab of jealousy. He never really gets to cook in a full kitchen, not one that's actually working and properly stocked and isn't just a toaster and a hotplate. He wonders furtively if he'll be here long enough to convince Sam to let him make a meal. This might not be
need help, it’s the act of admitting it. Which is maybe the root of the problem, anyway, that there is a duality in Dean of the things he knows but doesn’t admit to himself.
"Cas, you idiot." The emotion Dean is struggling with is too big for his concave chest. It's flickering out along his exposed nerves, electricity crackling in his live wires, potent with potential.
The man now tossing aside his machete is holding a shovel in his other hand. Which explains the way Dean's head is now pounding.
Every so often, Sam and Dean go on a hunt. Charlie and Garth, who have formed what Dean finds to be an incomprehensible and yet terrifying alliance as figureheads of the USA hunter network, refuse to send them any cases, but that doesn’t stop them from hearing local news. If it’s more than a day’s drive, Sam sends it to Charlie, but occasionally they deal with something in their neck of the woods. Usually, it’s a ghost or a vampire or something of that nature. All of the big players seem to have exited the stage, which makes Dean a little nervous. On the one hand, maybe Jack took care of them, or maybe the only reason they kept popping up in the first place was because the longer the narrative went on, the bigger and badder an antagonist needed to be in order to up the stakes and escalate the tension. Without Chuck, maybe life isn’t some hellish funhouse of increasingly diabolical villains and loss.
This is how it always is. The brothers in this car, the smell of gunpowder, leather, and whiskey wrapped around them like a home, waiting through the darkness for whatever comes next. The world always promises to end and then it
“We asked you for leads on the curse,” Sam says. “Not to… to copy Dean.”
Dean groans and lays his head on the table, peering sideways at older Dean, who is staring blankly into space, not even pretending to read.
Things aren't quite right with Mary. They never have been. But here, in Heaven, Dean understands that there is nothing but time to fix that, if he wants to. Already, without a word, Dean understands more about who his mother really is than he could ever let himself on earth.
Dean lets go instantly, scrambling off of Cas, a dozen different types of panic competing in his head.
“God,” Sam says, looking nauseated. “What’s that for?”
Dean spends most of the first year driving as he looks for the dark side of this place. He doesn't need to sleep, but sometimes he can make time pass just by laying down in the Impala and thinking about nothing.
"Sam, I can't let you do that."
? That one's gotta hold up, even for you."
"Dude. Like a homicidal Groundhog Day?"
"Of course it does!" Sam snaps back. He makes a frustrated little groaning noise and tugs at his hair. When he lets go, his face has smoothed back out and his voice is gentle again. Dean hates it.
The phone, however, is not.
"Maybe have Crowley re-fuse them?" Sam suggests, frowning.
Dean scratches the back of his neck. He feels out of his depth here in every possible way. He's grown up with the supernatural, but time travel? Angels? That's above his pay grade. Not his division. Older Dean and Sam seem to be taking this all in stride - like yeah, it's weird and inconvenient to have a Dean from the past running around in their timeline, but not at all unbelievable.
“Hey,” Dean says, shutting the door behind him and heading over to flop down on the opposite arm chair. Because what the hell, right? “Couldn’t sleep either, huh?”
"About how you'd expect. He's down at the range. I don't imagine he'll be up any time soon."
"You want a drink?" this Dean asks.
“You can’t go out like this, man. You can’t. You can’t just leave like this. Cas, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Dean stops. He’s crying again. It feels like he hasn’t stopped crying since Cas was taken.
Those were John's words in his mouth. Dean knows exactly how hard they must have hit, knows what it felt like at twenty-six to never be good enough.
"Really?" Dean says again, looking up at the sky. "Abandonment issues? That's what you got for me?"
Cas and Jack both look at Sam, confused, but young Dean is nodding.
"No. Ganked. Killed. Took out."
“Yeah, of course.” Sam sounds a little startled, but he doesn’t press it.
living together in this scenario? That sounds like an expectation."
"Okay," Cas said, knowing he was lying.
Dean's thinking about the militaristic quality of the bunker, about dad, with his military training and his military discipline. He's thinking about fucking up, over and over again, about dad threatening to leave him behind if Dean didn't get faster, tougher, man up. About how he
The diner at the very edge of the downtown strip smells exactly right, and they have several pies displayed beneath glass that Dean agonizes over while Cas orders them coffees to go. He gets his black and Dean's with sugar, no cream. It's such a small thing for him to know, but it means something to Dean.
Dean looks down at his hands. He has no feelings about them, the way he does about Cas’ hands. Dean knows, objectively, he’s still good-looking or whatever, but he’s getting older and grumpier by the day, and he doesn’t look in mirrors too long if he can help it. The only time he sees himself anymore is… It’s stupid, and he’d hate it if anyone else came up with this shit, but sometimes when he and Cas are having one of their little staring contests, Dean feels like Cas is actually seeing him, and even so still wanting him, and Dean can almost bear the thought of what he might look like these days.
Dean. I'm here, and so is Sam, and we're not much, but we're Team Free Will, right? I know I'm an invasion on your privacy right now, and you don't need me to tell you how much you've lost or how you feel about it, but Dean, the fact that you even get up in the morning after everything you've been through is admirable.
Dean doesn't press that. He thinks about it, wonders what Tom Selleck looks like these days. He’s guessing pretty fine.
Dean made a noise that was muffled into his pillow and arched back against Cas. He muttered something incoherent and Cas pressed his tongue into him, Cas’ hands tight on the spaces where ass and thigh met.
When it happens, Dean’s first thought is
"Rise and shine, Dean."
If it had just been beer on his dad's breath… if he hadn't just said "followed me from the bar," which meant he'd just come from drinking, which meant, from Dean's calculations over the years, that not only was John still drunk, he likely hadn't even hit the worst of it yet.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas doesn't like it, but even Sam agrees that being a "workaholic" in his new job is probably the healthiest Dean's ever been. And Cas doesn't have a leg to stand on, the filthy hypocrite, he constantly loses track of time and ends up spending all day with his plants and the animals. Not that Dean and Cas aren't spending time with each other. Dean took the part-time job so he could keep helping out around their place, or take care of Jude, or just go where he's needed.
“And what’s brought you in to seek therapy now?” Hank asks.
Because when shit goes south, and it always does, this is their lives, and one or both of them fucks up, they don't work through it or consider the rationality or the ramifications of it. They hunker down further into that fundamental need to believe and trust in each other.
John gets into the passenger seat, not looking at Dean. He notices the way Sam is glaring at the back of his head though.
Dean pulls Cas into him, kisses him hard and tries out the word
Dean snorted. “C’mon, you were around when there was nothing but primordial soup. You must have been pretty bored watching that.”
There are seven doors in this room. One of them has an X burned above it and the door is turned black. The others are innocuous. Where the X is over the first door they are numbered 2-7.
“Cas.”
Dean's trying to get pissed, because the anger is usually what gets him through.
Really? You think any of that came from your noggin?"
Hank keeps on looking at him in patient silence and Dean thinks about Cas waiting in the lobby for him - about Cas, asking Dean to try. About Sam’s big brown eyes looking at him in silent sadness over the top of Jude’s curls the last time Dean and Cas made it down for dinner.
Cas sits up, older Dean’s hand hovering surreptitiously at his back. Cas looks as tired as Sam has ever seen him.
Dean looks at Cas solemnly nodding along to Jude’s babbling, and he thinks
Something twitches and shifts in Sam's face. His shoulders drop. He almost looks relieved, like maybe Dean hasn't worked up to admitting even that much since it happened.
"What do you mean?" Cas asked warily.
Dean lays the blood-stained jacket handprint up in the hole, dumps salt and a little kerosene on it, and kneels there for a moment before he drops in the match.
Dean buries his face in the crook of Cas’ neck. Cas’ large hands are steadying on his hips as Dean pushes, too fast and too forceful, back onto his lap.
It still hurts, a little more at this angle and pace than Dean normally looks for, but he leans into it. He has to do something to shut out the song or he’ll never get there.
“Sammy, are those
John and Sam were in Missoula, looking for books on demon lineage or something, and Dean had just been supposed to do some reconnaissance a few towns over. But then he'd run into Constantine, and together they'd run into the demon. It fled before they could exorcise it, black smoke billowing from the poor victim's mouth. The guy he'd been possessing hadn't made it. Dean and Constantine had salted and burned the body at the edge of Constantine's property, where his cabin sat in the middle of an acre of land.
Cas sits there for what feels like a long time, holding Dean tight with both arms now, rubbing up and down his spine with one hand. Dean doesn't cry. He just breathes heavy and sometimes brokenly into Cas' shirt.
In the end, it took Cas two joints and almost an entire dime worth of butter to join them. Mary had put on some Fleetwood Mac, and Dean was just starting to feel it, laughing with Sam as Mary told them between hits about all the lies she used to tell to get out of hunting, and how she used to sneak out of the house to meet John and go dancing.
Back before Chuck and Heaven and Hell and a destiny that burned out before Dean did.
Sam was slumped on Dean's other side, fast asleep with his face smashed into Dean's shoulder. Sam was holding Dean's hand - which, when had that happened? - just like he used to when he was a little kid and couldn't fall asleep in a strange place. Dean felt like he should probably extract that hand, but he also desperately didn't want to.
Honestly, it would be funny, if Dean had the energy to unwrap that pile of irony.
Dean turns back to the job, searching older Dean's room on autopilot with numb fingers. He finds the photo of him and mom that he always keeps in his wallet. There is something beneath the numbness that wants to be felt at the sight of these photos sitting out there, somewhere permanent, somewhere older Dean expects to stay, somewhere he expects to come back to. He doesn't have to carry his home around in his back pocket or slung around his neck.
Dean thinks this plan sure has a lot of unknowns and holes, but he doesn’t have any better ideas other than just taking the bullet - so to speak - so he doesn’t argue too much.
“What happened when your father came home?” Hank prompts gently.
angels die?" Dean asks as they turn into the main part of the tiny Kansas town. He's thinking about the voicemail on Cas' phone, his own future voice angry with fear.
"I'm good, Dean. Listen…" John kept his eyes on the floor for a moment before he looked up fixing his gaze just beyond Dean. He wouldn't look him in the eye and his voice was gruff. "You still taking care of that car, boy?"
"I'm afraid so."
"Oh yes, you did. It was like your first word, man."
How strange it is, Cas thinks, to dissect the word "home." He had never called Heaven that, certainly never called anywhere on Earth that, before Dean. Humans are so odd with their languages - their euphemisms and colloquialisms have always baffled Cas. It's impossible to keep up with, the rate at which language evolves. So Cas doesn't know when the word "home" developed from a house or other dwelling in which one lives to have the connotations of feeling, to have it understood that home was people. In the same way that Cas doesn't know when his own understanding of "home" became "family".
The Winchester boys are alone, crying, loving so hard it hurts.
It didn’t, and eventually the smell was what drove Dean to move his leadened limbs. He tried to throw up again first, but there was absolutely nothing to heave out of his quietly protesting stomach. Everything hurt. His limbs were heavy and his head swam as he’d dragged himself into the bathroom. The mirror above the sink was broken - he had the faint idea that he might have broken it before he went under.
The thing chewed through his skin, then slipped in, deep into him. Dean could feel it sliding through him, feel it eating its way into his stomach. He felt it growing in him as it devoured his insides, felt it when it seemed to split in two, then as it multiplied.
"Why do I feel like that's always an appropriate goodbye?" Dean mutters, but he smiles as he watches Eileen embrace Sam. They don't kiss or anything, but the hug lingers.
God, he's like a little kid throwing a temper tantrum. Dean hates himself, hates this loss of control. His heart is beating so hard and he feels like he is practically out of his body.
Sam flashes that half-nervous grin at Dean, and it's clear that he's trying to reign in his real excitement. It makes Dean's stomach lurch. Sam turns to John who is sitting silent and still at the kitchen table.
It's been a long time since Dean's primary relationship to food was hunger. Even at twenty-six, when he was grifting his way to his next meal, adept at hustling poker and coasting on a few fake credit cards, he hadn't been secure day to day.
"I can't take him back," Cas says finally. His voice is even more gravelly than older Dean's. "He's not missing from the timeline."
They talk about Star Wars. Sam showed Dean the newest trilogy over the last couple of nights in what Sam and older Dean call “the cave”, and has promised to sit through the stand alone films with him too, albeit in a long-suffering sort of way. Dean was blown away by the special effects at first - he was never going to admit it to Sam or anyone, but he’d gotten an uneasy, nervous sort of feeling watching the first movie because everything looked so real. But then he’d gotten over it and just enjoyed being back in one of his favorite sci-fi worlds.
The apartment was empty, but the building still had tenants and the water blessedly turned on. Dean had gotten in the shower fully clothed, still sweating and shaking, and sat on the tile. He’d slowly peeled off his clothing and tried to scrub the feeling of warmth from the water into his skin. He’d stayed there, leaning against the modern glass shower wall and swaying in and out of the edge of consciousness.
Sam just rolls his eyes as he settles back onto the hood. “I didn’t say we had to tell them the whole truth and nothing but the truth. But I’m serious.”
Dean can feel his face heating up. At least Jack is only looking at him with the same general puzzlement as before, but it’s a pretty rough put down from his own future self. No wonder this Dean hates him.
It isn't
"No, shut up, I mean it. And I mean you as you are right now, as well as in your future. I've always known that. I always looked up to you, you know? Wasn't great at showing it, but I did. I do. You're a man who saves the world, Dean, more than once. You're just also a self-deprecating bastard."
Dean hears Sam getting out of the car too, and dammit, can't his brother for once just leave things alone?
All he can see is that last time, the ash of Cas' wings spread out from his body, Dean on his knees as if to pray, coming up empty.
Dean swallowed. His green eyes were so bright in the sunlight. There were already new freckles across his nose and the span of cheeks. Cas knew, because he knew those freckles like the constellations.
Dean glances at Cas. Cas is also staring at four-year-old Dean, but his expression is…
"Yeah, maybe, but let's do it. Come on. We've got a full tank of gas, we can get a few states over and then pick up a new car. We could do it, now, today."
“It’s not like I want to die,” older Dean says between gritted teeth. “Okay? But we’re talking about one of us having to make that choice, and it’s not gonna be you. You’re just a -”
"Dean, I have literally never heard you say that name. Who the hell is Damian?"
Dean thinks these are reassuring, and he shares them with the table. Jack seems relieved, but Cas’ face drifts back to blankness. Dean hates that.
Then it's the hospital, John splayed out on the floor, twenty-six-year-old Dean back from the grave, leaning on Sam and feeling the world cave in.
Dean drank a glass of whiskey while they worked, his heart hammering as he skimmed over missing persons reports and news articles about crop failings. It was the first case they'd taken together, alone, since the night they'd spent in Dean's room. Sam had been caught up in a Men of Letters thing, and it wasn't far from the bunker, and Dean had kind of… he'd been kind of hoping Sam would stay behind.
There is a pulsing in what might be the space behind his eyes.
Sam has paused outside the diner doors, looking bewildered. "What did I do?"
Cas nods, and Dean opens the fifth door.
"I'm open-minded," Dean said. His fingers, unfairly, trailed down to Cas' nipples, tracing circles there. "What is it? Feet stuff? Leather? Oh, I know, it's gonna be roleplay, isn't it?"
Dean - the now Dean - drops the blue ball back into four-year-old Dean's hands, where it belongs, and backs up to the farthest edge of the memory. He leans back against the window and crosses his arms over his chest. Cas stays by his side, and Dean doesn't look at him.
He puts his hand on the door knob behind him, closes his eyes again.
Being battered with all this shit, having it parsed out into sections and handed to him one clump after another like a series of mental health pamphlets in a doctor's waiting room, it's stretching Dean's ability to stay remotely present.
"We'll get you one. Kind of necessary these days. Here, you can take mine for now. You'll just have to answer it if anyone calls, could be a case."
He and Cas watch the lover's quarrel as it plays out, the smell of the farm ripe but not unpleasant around them in the evening air.
In the world of these books, humans have a physical manifestation of their soul that appears at their side as an animal, called a dæmon. Children's dæmons change shape until they are older and settle into whatever form they will take for the rest of their lives. For the two protagonists of the novels, their souls settle when they first lay a hand on one another's dæmons. They couldn't bear to change shape after being touched by the person they love.
"I gotta know, are there any other kids? I mean, have you or I had…?"
“So,” Sam says as they walk back toward the Impala parked a block away.
Dean doesn’t let go of Cas’ hand, but he has to look away. The crack in Cas’ voice breaks him down, right down to the center of his being. It’s awful. It’s much worse than he thought it would be to watch himself die.
It's Cas this time. He actually steps forward, half in front of Dean, like he's ready to defend him. There is a note of steel in his voice. "Don't speak to him like that."
Dean hesitates another second, turns halfway back. "Cas. Just..."
“Like I said, strange.” Cas’ mouth quirks up though.
John might have named a few things he hated more than emotional or psychological weakness, but Dean was pretty sure it’d be up there on the list. So what if Dean was depressed? That was a natural side effect of hunting, of knowing the truth about the world. Everything feels meaningless? That’s a betrayal of the mission.
"What-" Dean says, looking between Sam and older Dean. "What the fuck was that?"
came on as Dean threw back the last of his whiskey and he smiled to himself. He got up and stretched, and he didn't miss the way Cas' eyes flicked briefly to his torso and away again.
"Or what?" Sam takes a step forward, chest out, arms spread. "Come on, do it, take a shot."
“C’mon,” Dean says again, laughing a little. “Dude, I didn’t even finish highschool. I don’t think I ever got a grade above a C in my life.”
For a brief period after this, Dean refuses to sleep in their bed. He sleeps out on the couch where Earp and Cap, the german shepherd, fight over the right to lay on top of him. The couch is comfortable, if not really big enough for a german shepherd to curl up between Dean’s legs without one foot dangling off the edge, but it makes Dean and Cas both miserable not to sleep together now that they’ve finally allowed themselves to have it after so long. Cas keeps trying to tell Dean it’s alright, that they can handle it, but Dean knows that he, at least, can’t.
that? Sammy. What in the world are you thinking?"
Mary gave up on Cas and let him go. Cas staggered back and then he too was curling up on the couch on Dean's other side, taking up two cushions to curl up like a cat. His head wasn't quite in Dean's lap, but rested right up against his thigh. Dean found his hand in Cas' hair with no idea how it had gotten there, but he didn't remove it. He didn't think Cas was asleep exactly, but his eyes were slitted and he was breathing deep and even.
“Kiss your brothers on the cheek for me. Make it awkward. Let me know how the spell goes.”
“That’s part of it.” Hank shifts a little in his chair, settling in with his hands folded together on his lap. Dean doesn’t understand how he manages to stay so relatively still.
His hand twitches to his jacket pocket automatically, checking that the god-killing stake is still an easy reach.
Dean clears his throat. “Uh. So. Charlie’s a cosplayer, huh?” he looks between them. “What the hell is a cosplayer?”
Dean had never considered himself a tourist. He was there to work, afterall. No matter where he went, there were always the great open roads of America, and the road was his home.
But it's Cas, and it's true.
"Huh?"
“No, I know. I know.” Dean shuts his eyes, rubs a hand over his face again and forces himself to meet his therapist’s gaze. “I was a kid, Sam is his own person, my dad was angry at himself that he wasn’t able to take care of Sam, okay, I know.”
“Jack,” he says. “Have you been to Wichita?”
There is exactly one personal effect that Dean can find. It's a note from Eileen, folded and tucked away into the topmost book on Sam's nightstand. Dean opens it, scans it and folds it right back up.
“Uh. Not unless they hurt me first. Or, you know, they’re a monster.”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Hank says. “No child should have to make that kind of choice.”
"Cas," younger Dean murmurs. "Time to… say goodbye, buddy. S'okay. Promise. S'okay."
"Sam, I swear, if you say we need to talk about this one more time, I will leave you to wait alone. Okay? There's nothing to talk about."
"Is that… grace?" Mary, sitting across from them looks at the bottle with wide, slightly worried eyes. Everyone's looking at Dean now and he's afraid his ears are turning pink.
"You're a fucking trainwreck, Dean."
The heartbreak of it had torn Dean to pieces. He’d nearly gotten himself offed a few days later by a witch because he’d been half-drunk from binging himself into a blackout the night before. But he’d shoved all that down too. He always did. No point being a girl about it, dad would have said.
Dean just keeps shoving it all down, refusing to break, yes, but also refusing to bend. It changes him, but it pushes him farther inside himself. All that guilt, the anguish, the fear, it sits there and rots. Dean won't let it breathe. To him, being vulnerable to his past is a weakness.
And that's not
It's Cas who nods and moves past Sam to the open door. He glances back once at Dean, his eyes still intense on him, before he disappears, footsteps echoing down the hall.
"Yeah," Dean says, feeling grumpy for no reason he can really identify. "Yeah, okay."
“I’m just saying, if it comes to it, prioritize the kid.”
Cas took his time, and it seemed to calm Dean in a way, perhaps the relief of some more tangible sexual release, perhaps just the break from Cas’ words pouring over him like sacrament. When Cas finally pulled back, he kissed the backs of Dean’s thighs, running his tongue lightly over the skin just a little. Dean made a muffled little noise of protest, but Cas ignored him. He kissed the backs of Dean’s knees, telling him that the veins there were like the trails of minerals in the Redcliffs of the Mojave desert. He caressed the tight muscles of his calves, cupped his ankles in his hands, ran his fingers feather-light over the soles of his feet and between his toes.
"Whatever. It's no big deal, Sammy. We never talked about it again, and all things considered it could have gone a lot worse."
Older Dean runs his hand along the bar as he comes around to the front. "Sure, she's coming along just fine. Just need to get our license up, set up the last tables, and we'll be good to go."
"That was different," Sam insists. "Chuck was never going to let either of us leave. It wasn't good storytelling. He couldn't exactly have a season of his favorite show where we sat around being all domestic, could he? And besides, we've always talked about this normal life like it means just one thing. Like it's the platonic ideal of American middle-class life - wife and kids, house and a white picket fence, boring job, all of that. And maybe that's not for us, I don't know, but that's not all life is. We can still help people. I could go back to school for law, you could become a volunteer firefighter or something, whatever, I'm just saying, it's not all meaningless. I mean, even if you never helped another person in any way for the rest of your life, you still deserve to live. Why do we have this stupid idea engrained in us that it's better to die hunting then to retire when we know we're out of our prime? We'll all stop one way or another, eventually. Why do we think we’re only allowed to stop when we die?”
Castiel's true form tumbling out of heaven, burning like a celestial death, like a cosmic event.
"Uh, that's Cas," Dean says. A part of him always feels like this should be enough, like it is all too evident in the way he says Cas' name that Cas is just
Dean reaches into his pocket before he realizes he must have left his phones - all of them - in the Impala back in 2005.
"Oh. Oh, no, little one," Cas says under his breath, hand reaching down over the rail. "I'm so sorry. Not me. I can't. I'm sorry."
Cas wasn’t particularly aware of this cosmic event at the time. He was primarily occupied as an electromagnetic wavelength of radiation humming around an outpost in Antartica. A scientific technician there by the name of Brandy Makov needed to make it out of his service on an expedition with only minor electrical burns, in order to return home and - well, actually, Cas hadn’t known the details of what important function Brandy Makov served in The Plan. He wasn’t sure he’d even asked, believing at that moment that his orders were enough.
Sam never got to be an older brother - Adam doesn't really count - but he feels this strange near inverse of feelings for younger Dean. It's a role reversal neither of them is totally comfortable with, but it's deep and real too. It's strange to think of twenty-six year-old Dean as a separate person from Sam's Dean, because they are a part of each other, but somehow they are so wholly individual.
Nina Simone’s
If Cas can be this gentle, and also rebel against Heaven, also be a warrior who dragged older Dean from the pits of Hell, who has apparently fought and died at his side, then maybe all this time that Dean spends fighting that duality in himself is just…
(Don't worry, it still has smooches and angst)
Cas wasn’t entirely sure if they were talking about the moment or something more, but he settled back into the bed, unbothered by the extremely human mess they’d made if Dean wasn’t. “Of course, Dean. I’m here as long as you’ll have me.”
doesn’t care, and dad’s dead, so what does it matter?
- two years, but Cas doesn't touch him any differently. He still caresses Dean like he's the most holy thing he's ever been allowed to touch, still mumbles into his neck that he is
Dean straddles Cas’ lap and get his hands up in Cas’ stupid windswept hair, leaning in to press their mouths back together. He can feel the surprise in Cas’ body as Dean settles on top of him, feels his hands nevertheless come up to grip his hips. Dean is usually more careful than this, cautious of getting caught out anywhere but behind the closed doors of their own rooms.
"Lemme ask you something," Dean says into the uncomfortable silence. "You're an angel and heaven and everything is real, right? What about God?"
And Dean is not, of all things, stable. Not now. Not for a long time.
"Oh, I'm pretty sure dad knew," he says quietly.
He had never even imagined, and could not have comprehended, how the energy would magnify between his and Dean’s naked bodies. How it would feel to cross that last line between them and become a part of each other; encased and casing. How it would feel to know Dean wanted him too.
It's older Dean, still holding the camera out away from his body, arm wrapped around Cas' shoulder, hands still tangled. Dean is kissing Cas' cheek, his smile still evident even with his mouth pressed to Cas' skin. Cas is looking at the camera this time, a surprised grin just starting, eyes crinkling with his smile.
"Dean," he whispers. It's barely a sound. "Are you awake?"
At least it's quick.
There's a hot feeling in Dean's eyes and the back of his throat for some reason as he awkwardly pats Sam on the back. "Whoa, okay, big guy," he says. "Don't make this all chick flick on me, dude."
Dean is shaking a little and he stays on his knees, even though Cas has managed to remain on his feet and he’s standing there with his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Dean hesitates, torn with desire. It feels almost like cheating on his car, but… "Only if you promise not to tell baby," Dean says, pointing at Cas in warning.
“You think you might want kids?”
Upstairs, the door to the library opens. Cas and Jack emerge, Cas blinking in surprise to see them up, Jack's eyes lingering warily on young Dean.
And Cas had just tried, in every way he knew how, to tell Dean that it wasn't his fault, that he hadn't deserved it, that he was a good man who was worthy of love without having to earn it.
"A moment of true happiness? What could have made Cas happy while you were being hunted by Death?" Sam's eyebrows crease together and he looks to Dean. Dean looks up at the ceiling and closes his eyes, takes a deep breath.
"So, you rescued me from Hell, huh? Kinda left that out of our origin story earlier."
Sam stands up too, unfolding towards the sky like he always does, still the little brother Dean would, and has, give everything for. But not this. He can't do this.
“Um,” Dean said, letting go of Levi’s hips. He was expecting the white noise, or screeching silence, or John’s voice in his head calling him any number of slurs, but instead there seemed to be a dry voice that might have belonged to Sam, asking him if he might want to reevaluate his obsession with Dr. Sexy.
you."
Dean stares at him, caught off guard by the question. He’s never thought about it that way - not exactly. John would have been disgusted by the idea of pills to deal with something as trivial as mental health, but hadn’t he been leaning on Hunter’s Helper all of Dean’s life?
Dean’s eyes widened in delighted disbelief. “Shut up,” he said. “No. You are not telling me that you being a chaotic little shit and disobeying Heaven is directly responsible for the band Queen.”
Cas wonders if he should take Dean's hand again or touch his shoulder, but he doesn't. Touch is a strange human thing, too. Cas' understanding of physical affection and comfort is limited, but he knows Dean's relationship with it is volatile. He understands why better now with a sick, burning anger.
Dean didn't tell Cas that he put the information together based on patterns, on the relationship of clues, on gut feelings that had developed over decades of doing this. He didn't tell him off at all.
"Most forests will have some type of this communication set up, provided deforestation has not damaged the networks too badly." Cas sighs, all the weight of millenia on his breath. "It's part of the reason why all of this is so detrimental, and why you cannot simply plant new trees to pave over the damage done to old ones. I mean, Dean, trees are such complex beings, you have no idea, none of you do. The networks here are ancient, strong. The groves have deep alliances with each other that they've kept for centuries, some longer than that. They share resources and send distress signals. The mountain ash, the common hazel, and the cornelian cherry all operate on the same network here to the east, and the firs and the pine operate on another. They are collaborative."
“Back at you, boys,” Garth says, and hangs up.
Now-Dean can't help but think how much the first part of his speech sounded like he was trying to come out to them, which, isn't that laden with irony?
Now-Dean remembers, it had practically been Sammy's first word. He remembers Sam's first steps too, how he'd stood braced against a coffee table and then toddled straight to Dean. And Dean remembers the rush of warmth he'd felt even then, the protectiveness and pride. Dad had been there too, but Sam had chosen Dean, had always gone to Dean first, even when his brother was just a runty little five or six years old.
Sam takes his jacket off the hook by the door, pulls the strap of his duffel bag back over it, and walks out.
"Dean." Cas' thumbs stroke along his shoulders.
Now-Dean watches it happen, detached. He remembers the absolute desolation of that grief, how it came in waves that threatened to kill him, the loss so intense that he wanted to rip his own skin off. He remembers the way it had all been subsumed by anger, transmuted into rage, taking it out on the cars in Bobby's junkyard.
"Dean." Sam gives yet another sigh, this one followed by a stifled yawn. "I really wish you'd give it a try, man. I'd help you find someone, maybe even put out feelers for someone who knows about monsters. I've been thinking about that, and there have to be more of us. There's gotta be people who know about this shit who didn't become hunters."
“Great,” older Dean says, pushing what remains of his food around on his plate. “Awesome.”
No one has ever looked at Dean like that. Maybe Sam, but certainly not recently.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know,” Cas said, his voice low and hoarse. He leaned down, craning his neck, to kiss into Dean’s hair. Dean smelled like home. Like love and absolution.
Charlie says goodnight after the movie, hugs Dean and whispers in his ear “Just remember… it’s okay to be Takei!”
“So, supposedly it’s over,” Dean concludes, after an abridged account of their defeat of Chuck. “But how am I supposed to believe that? And even if Chuck… If he’s really gone, our name is still out there. There’s any number of sons of bitches who’d like to kill us. So if I… I already worry about the people I’ve got. It feels like inviting people into the freaking shadow of Death just to have a passing good opinion of them. I don’t need anyone else, and I don’t want the burden of anyone else’s death on my shoulders. I’m just… I’m tired of losing people, man.”
Cas’ hands cupped his cheeks. “Dean?”
Dean eventually finds the willpower to crawl off Cas’ lap. He can’t help wincing as he slides off and he knows Cas notices. They flop back onto the mattress and Dean stays on his back looking up at the ceiling as Cas curls around him.
"Um, look, it's probably better if we don't tell you. Time travel is tricky. We don't want to screw up the timeline."
Cas had sat down next to Dean on the bed, glass of whiskey forgotten in his hand and he'd actually slowed down enough to
Dean scowls. "I'm the one pointing the gun, I ask the questions here."
- Funeral Bell - Phildel
"Eventually, yes."
They stay like that for a while, kissing gently, tenderly, beneath the stars while the fire dies out.
"If you like this one, then I like it. That's all I really care about."
Sam gives it a beat. He takes a breath, closes his eyes, opens them again.
Dean had stood there in his kitchen, blinking at his reflection in the darkened windowpane. It felt like the words took a long time to reach his brain.
So they stand there, Cas leaning heavily into Dean and breathing hard, Dean supporting his weight and aggressively not thinking about it. The sky gets a little brighter around the edges.
"Sorry."
The receptionist smiles brightly and slides over a clipboard. "Sure thing, Mr. Boon. It looks like you faxed over all of your insurance information last night, so I'll just need a co-pay of fifteen dollars from you and for you to fill out these intake forms for new clients."
"I'm not… I can't do this right now."
him and hurting him would hurt Sam and that's the whole goddamn start of this story, but he thinks what they've been doing over all these years is mainly their codependency and partly a result of "the backfire effect."
Sam laughs. "I'm nearly forty, dude."
“Well. We think so, but… After all of that, how do any of us know what’s real? For all I know, Chuck is just waiting to pop back up the second I become complacent. You know, he took everything there was to take away from us, the worst thing he could do would be to let us build it back up, to think that we’re safe, and then…” Dean gestures vaguely.
There may be a slightly longer wait between this chapter and the next, but hopefully not much longer.
"Well. Yes. And I don't know, man, I wasn't there. I get that it was bad and we both made some choices. But I know you. I still know you. And you'll always be the boy who stayed after school to tutor the kids who were struggling, the kid who dragged me to volunteer at animal shelters, the frikkin' toddler who brought me a baby bird that fell out of its nest and cried until we put it back. You're not evil, man. You don't have it in you."
“Thing is, ma’am,” Sam says. “Ghosts might start out, uh, nice, but the longer the spirit stays here after death, the more tortured and vengeful they become. He’ll turn eventually and he might hurt you then.”
Cas took his time, greedy now that he was allowed to linger over Dean’s body, filled with the desire, the
Now-Dean remembers the panic when dad didn't meet up when he said he would, when he wasn't where he said he'd be.
Cas stays frozen for a second, and Dean sure as hell can't look at him, so he wraps his arms around his stomach and looks at the floor, just trying to get air into his lungs.
"Hey, idle hands lead to idle minds or whatever."
"Does he know that he does this?"
John snorts. "Sure. For other people. But they don't know what we do. We have a responsibility-"
"Cas?" Older Dean asks. Even in the silence of the woods, they're all speaking in low voices.
“That’s what I’m worried about.” Dean loosens his grip around his knees a bit.
"Look, it's not like we… We never called it that or went to a courthouse or whatever, but he was my…" Dean trails off, the lump in his throat too hard to speak around.

“Dammit, Cas, don’t make me say it.” Dean struggles with the words, feeling like the prayer has already gotten away from him. “I need you. I need you here. We’ll work out the rest. I…”
Sam graciously pretends not to notice that Dean has to wipe his eyes, so Dean socks him roughly on the shoulder just to restore some kind of balance.
Jack is saying “It’s just Charlie. I don’t see what’s wrong with mac n’ cheese.”
“I gotta go, I left Cas unsupervised in the kitchen with a stew, and the dogs gang up on him if he cooks alone.”
Dean spends the first year hunting down all the corners and cracks in Heaven, trying to find something wrong, something he needs to kill or fix. He can't help it. Even in the tranquility, even though emotions are different here and nothing feels particularly urgent or threatening anymore, Dean is still himself. Everyone just kind of lets him work through it. Most of them went through something similar, although maybe for Dean it's that he can't quite accept that good things do happen. Not to him. Not indefinitely.
Then it's Sam leaving him when he was possessed.
Dean's never talked about it with Cas, either.
Cas sighs. "I promise not to tell one inanimate object about your use of another inanimate object," he says, and this time Dean can tell he is teasing a little.
"Dad,
The priest had sighed then, a little rustling coming from the other side of the screen as he shifted on the hard wooden seats. "What I hear in you is something I hear from many others. You're lost because you aren't honoring, or if you would prefer, perhaps acknowledging, all those parts of yourself. If you cannot allow yourself to feel these things that you so deeply crave, cannot build up love and trust, ask yourself if you truly consider them weaker, dispensable. Can you truly do what needs doing if you do not undertake it for love?"
"Nah, man, don't worry about it. Don't want to ruin your, uh, your research flow." Dean glances at Eileen, who is watching his lips move. She offers him a smile and winks. Yeah, Dean likes her.
but he’s out.”
"This might be a dumb question," Dean says. He usually starts his questions about space this way. "But is there actually a center to the universe? Do you know?"
Which is partly why Sam is surprised by just how many of Cas’ tapes seem to have snuck into the Impala. He can tell immediately which ones belong to Cas, of course. The shoebox stuffed into the glove compartment is separated into two parts by a piece of cardboard, with Dean’s side considerably fuller and intimately familiar to Sam. But the other side still has a respectable number of tapes: Enya, Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Florence + The Machine, Fleetwood Mac, Simon and Garfunkel, Leonard Cohen...
Dean was back to normal the day after. He woke up, opened one eye, blinked blearily up at Cas and said “Listen, man, you ever touch my feet outside of your little kink, I will kick you out of bed so fast it’ll make you motion sick.”
Cas lets his hand drop. "I know," he says, which isn't fair, because Dean doesn't even know what he was going to say.
Dean likes it that way. He thought maybe he’d want to be a full-time pediatric nurse, but dealing with sick and injured kids every day takes its toll. The emergency room is its own form of stress, of course, but it’s a good distraction. The nurse manager shuffles him around and lets him request assignments most of the time.
Older Dean rubs at his eyes then nods, as if steeling himself. Sam sets the duffle bag down, and pulls out two sheathed machetes. He hands one to Dean, who hefts it, testing the balance. When he unsheathes it, the edge of the blade glints, shiny and sharp.
The memory twists and tumbles and spits them out once more into the room with the doors. Dean lets the weight of it all bring him to his knees, and then he's laying down, flat on his back, covering his face with his hands and feeling the whole world tilting.
"I do not want to do anything that you do not want," Cas said. "I am not asking for anything, you will not be depriving me of something by not wanting this. I know it might be… difficult for you."
Of course, sometimes they do anyway.
Dean doesn’t
"No what?" Sam says, his chest puffed up a little, his jaw set.
"Yeah, well, look me up in a few years," past-Dean says.
Lately though… well.
At least something is right with this world.
"Ask me for something," Dean whispers into the silence of their new home. "Anything."
"No," Dean says. "I'm not sorry."
If you are interested in more info on some of the random facts I've squeezed in here, also see the end notes.
"But not crap you've dealt with." Cas isn't trying to be cruel, with his blunt, matter of fact words. Dean knows that, but it still stings. "You keep it all locked up and you never… You never let anyone help you."
"What kind of argument are we talking here? Like it was a few months ago or like one of you left your socks somewhere they weren't supposed to be?"
The next thing Dean knows, Sam is pulling him into a hug, crushing Dean into his chest with those Sasquatchian arms, chin pressed to his shoulder. Dean blinks, too stunned to reciprocate at first. He and Sam don't do this. Or, they do, okay, but only when one of them has been seriously injured or something.
Dean gasps in shallow breaths, knees bent, head bowed toward the floor.
"Yeah."
The hallway creaks. Eight-year-old Dean reaches a hand under his pillow and touches the handle of a hunting knife. When he and Sammy are alone in motel rooms he usually sleeps with a sawed-off shotgun, but they're staying with a hunter friend of dad's while he's out working a job, and Dean had felt weird about bringing a firearm to bed in someone else's home. Not weird enough to go totally weaponless, though.
"Seriously, it's all good. Don't leave your girl alone in there, younger me's an idiot, remember?"
at him in what felt like years. It was the first modicum of comfort he’d found since Sam left.
Cas watches intently, like he's going to be quizzed later. Dean can't help glancing at him out of the corner of his eye.
Garth calls Sam a couple of weeks after Dean and Cas return from Michigan. Dean and Sam chat with Garth occasionally, but it’s always social or research-related. He hasn’t sent them a case in years, determined along with Charlie to leave them out of the life. But he’s got something weird in Bellemont, Arizona he says, and wants them to take it.
And Dean was back there, back with those hooks digging into him, stretching him out and open like a painter stretches a canvas. He was back with the claws scraping over his belly, not cutting in yet, more of a caress than anything, the thing that was one of Alastair’s apprentices appraising him with its smokey black eyes. It wasn’t human. They were sometimes, they could be, but this one was smoke and fire, solid but changing the parameters of its form even as it looked Dean over and licked its approximate lips.
Are you that willing to leave Sam? Are you really willing to just walk out on all your friends? Cas too?”
When they’d gone back to the cave, the music was still playing and Mary was dancing. She pulled Dean and Cas in and made them dance with her, Sam collapsed on the couch laughing at all of them until Dean forcibly dragged his little brother up to join them.
"Right. Uh. Sorry. Just… feels kinda like I haven't seen you in fifteen years."
“Your father?”
Sam laughs. "Oh God, no. No, man, you're safe."
him, that's still a mess he can't untangle, but Cas seems like he'd be fun to tease.
Dean had laughed and told her about getting so paranoid one night that John would smell the weed on his breath that he’d drunk a bunch of bourbon to try and wash out the scent and ended up deliriously cross-faded.
It kind of makes Dean feel a weird sort of affection towards them both.
"What's next? Are we still heading out to the crop failures in Illinois?"
"Yeah. Well."
"That's one of Apollo's trees. Or at least, there was a grove near Mount Ida that was supposedly sacred to him. Do you think…?"
Dean slaps his brother on the back. "Wow, kiddo, look at you."
in front of Sam, especially this older, more experienced Sam who apparently does not share any of Dean's allergies to feelings.
"Dean -" Sam starts to complain, then stops. He looks at Dean's face, then away. "You're not doing anything stupid, are you?"
Sam shakes his head, still smiling softly, and bends over the stroller, checking that everything's in order. "Thanks for watching him, anyway."
Okay. So. It was definitely a
It isn't like Dean woke up with the ability to just walk away from his brother for the first time in his life. He knows if Sam doesn't follow him, he'll probably end up back in the bunker in a few months. But in the moment, Dean has to get out. Has to be anywhere else. He browsed through houses for sale across the Midwest, just scrolling until something popped out at him. The first picture sort of took his breath away.
Dean wakes up in the bunker. His first impression is of a stabbing pain in his right arm and when he opens his eyes, it's to find his arm neatly bandaged and pulled up to his chest in a sling.
him rolling his eyes. "Get in the shower with me."
It’s a good three hour drive to Wichita, but so what? This is Dean’s starting argument, but it turns out that he doesn’t actually have to argue with Jack or Cas at all. He gets the impression that he’s not the only one feeling restless, that these two strange angelic men are feeling helpless in the moment, wishing for something to do. It’s not like Dean can give them anything important, he can’t just whip a case out of his ass to take their mind off things, but he does remember the things he used to do to keep Sammy entertained when they were younger.
Dean leans over, feeling a little sick, mostly just so goddamn sad, not really wanting to hear his own twenty-six year-old self’s last words.
Dean grins. He knows all about experimental cooking. "My brother, Sam, he
"The point," Dean says hastily. "Is that even if we never made it legal, we were… I mean, we were basically an old married couple. If… if things had ever calmed down, maybe we would have… But yeah. We were in love, and now he's dead. So. I figure common law works for widowship or whatever, right?"
It's an effort to meet his eyes.
"You said Cas summoned the Empty." Sam drums his fingers on the table. "How? It doesn't make sense. How could he just call it at will? And why did it take him and Death, but not you?"
Dean groans. "Cas, Jesus, I was just trying to tease you, you fucking sap. Fine, whatever. I'm just saying, I'd get it. I don't want to hear about it, but do what you need to do."
He's always accepted Dean's boundaries, even when he didn't understand them, even when it hurt to leave or be left. But this…
Dean kind of figured, hey, he's broken in a dozen other ways, whatever, so what if he goes numb sometimes? It's not the worst thing. After Hell, he would have given anything to be able to control it, to give up feeling anything for good if he could forget what that place had made him.
"Cas," Sam says simply, because it's not like Charlie doesn't know. "Dean, past Dean, was asking about him and then he asked me if he was seeing anyone and…"
Dean meets Sam's confused and worried face and for all the years and wrinkles, Dean is still protecting his little brother. He's still doing his job.
Sam knows better than anyone, maybe even better than Dean himself, how much Cas cares.
Sam narrows his eyes in a way that makes Dean suspect he's carefully filing this information away for future use, but he nods.
Maybe Dean's fixation on his younger self's softness, on what he'd still managed to hold onto at twenty-six was about more than Hell. That it was about the suspicion he's had for a long time now that it was this softness about him that set John off, that his dad had looked at Dean and seen how pretty he was, how much he looked like Mary, how men looked at Dean and maybe sometimes Dean looked back, that John had seen all that and felt the need to toughen his son up. Not beat the gay out of him, not really, but make sure Dean understood that the world ate up soft, pretty boys and spat them back out in pieces. But dad didn't know, didn't understand that Dean already knew all about that.
Dean has to agree with Eileen on this one.
"He just turned four this summer. I swear, he's just like his dad at that age."
Levi smelled like Old Spice and tasted like lemon liquor. His mouth was soft. His fingers had been gentle as he’d pressed a hand to the back of Dean’s neck and then slid it up into his short hair. Dean had grabbed his hips out of instinct, not trying to press anything, just holding on, and he’d kissed back. And he’d liked it. Fuck, but he’d really liked it.
Dean's asleep the moment he hits the pillow, crashing into unconsciousness and dreams of blue.
At the end of six months, Dean wakes up one morning from his alcohol-induced stupor. He's still mildly intoxicated, which is a pleasant surprise. He sits up in a pile of dirty sheets and clothes, books and beer bottles, and looks around his trashed bedroom. There are books and printouts everywhere, bits of spell work, several spots of drying blood from whatever he'd cut his hand open over last. His memory is fuzzy on that one; he thinks it might have been some sort of communication spell. It doesn't matter, it didn't work. Nothing has worked.
“Mm. Sure.”
Her eyes land on Dean and widen, her lipsticked stained mouth falling open. "Now hold on just a minute. Who's this? I know you ain't old enough or honest enough to have a son his age, Dean, have you two been keeping another brother secret from the girls in town?"
Twenty-six year-old Dean can't sleep. He thought he would, when Sam showed him to an empty bedroom and said goodnight, ruffling his hair in a fond gesture that surprised both of them. He was exhausted, definitely, but his head was just too full of spinning thoughts - of time travel, death, sex, and the broken look on his own future self's face.
Sam only knows a little French, but he hums along, some of his irritation fading now that the itch to be on the move is sated. He thinks about what he should say to Dean when he finds him, how much to hold back, how much to force on him.
“It’s a greek myth imbued with demonic energy, Dean. I wasn’t expecting a comedy.” Sam rakes a hand through his hair and sighs. They all do that a lot these days. “I suppose we’ve put it off long enough. We should probably summon Crowley back, don’t you think?”
It's the only time Cas has said it. He's wanted to a hundred times before and since, but he knows Dean can't return it. Cas doesn't mind that, but Dean would. Cas is pretty sure the guilt of it would make Dean bolt.
Dean shoves his hands into his pockets. “I dunno. Fine.”
Dean used to call the angels "junkless" as a harmless insult - a quip, Cas knows now, to mask his initial fear and awe of them. He's not exactly wrong or exactly right.

"Whoa, whoa, Dean, hey."
“Fair enough. I had to ask. Well, Dean, I’m glad that you came in today. I know that there’s a lot we didn’t talk about, and I do hope you’ll come back. You may think I’m being sentimental, but it really does take effort and courage to come to therapy. How are you feeling about giving another session a chance?”
Sam, instead of going all puppy-eyed at this hint of verbalized emotion from Dean, frowns harder, forehead fully wrinkling now. “This sounds like one of your death talks. Why does this sound like one of your death talks?”
“Well,” Sam says into the gaping silence. “At least we know.”

Cas recognized the teasing inflection in Dean's voice and rolled his eyes. "We live together now, Dean."

“Why does it seem stupid?”
"Because you couldn't follow a simple fucking direction," older Dean continues as if Sam hasn't spoken. He's yelling outright now, his hands balled into fists, and Dean can see where his knuckles have cracked open again and begun to bleed through his bandage.
Dean ditched Cas to moodily shoot at targets for awhile, but his skin itched just knowing the other Dean was in the same building. So he snuck out to the garage and now he's driving the Impala in the unlit night of backwoods Kansas, black asphalt, black trees, and the deepening purple-blue of the sky. His phone stopped ringing an hour ago and now it's just him and Metallica. The music is soothing. So is the road.
It’s something that Dean recognizes he never would have let himself have on earth. It is too vulnerable, too sweet. He could imagine a living version of this with desperate physicality, of kissing Cas with urgency, of clinging to him like to a buoy out at sea. But the gentleness of Cas’s hands on Dean’s lower back, the kisses on the forehead, their fingers tangled together under the starlight, the laughter between them over beers leaning against the Impala, the glow of knowing one another…
has been making that empty promise to himself for years. But after this curse, there will be Chuck. Another end-of-the-world Hail Mary shitshow that they have no guarentee of surviving. They’ve been keeping that from young Dean, at first in unspoken trepidation of telling him too much to either overwhelm him or upset the timeline, and now in a briefly whispered agreement to deal with that
"Yeah, and you're going to warm them up, buttercup," Dean said, running his fingers up Cas' chest and back, pinning him between his hands.
"No, but neither do you." Dean's arms squeezed gently around him.
It’s also that Dean doesn’t know how to do therapy - he doesn’t understand how any of it is supposed to work. But Sam had said it was okay not to tell the whole truth, he’d said he altered the narrative and kept the “emotional truth,” whatever the hell that was supposed to mean. Dean wishes now that he’d asked Sam about his cover story. But then, Dean thinks, digging his fingernails into his palms, maybe he doesn’t want to know the kind of allegory Sam would choose for their lives.
“Yeah, actually, you might be right.” Dean shrugs. “It’s probably what I’d do. Somewhere you know I’d never intentionally go.”
Cassie calls him on every last piece of crap, and really, it's one of the things Dean had liked so much about her.
"That's too much advertisement to everyone else. Besides, it's
Dean doesn't quite have the gumption to ask Cas if
As dawn starts to break over the horizon in pink and pale yellow light, they can see the signs of deep deforestation for miles near the base of the mountain. There’s a bed of sawdust and litter around the fresh sites, low trenches of turned up mud and broken stumps in places where the work has been long-abandoned. Closer to the mountain itself, there are still clumps of trees and other growing things, but as Dean looks out at the surrounding area, he thinks that it looks like a blight upon the land.
Dean had groaned and put his head in his hands. "I don't know why I bother," he muttered.
Sam shrugs. “I don’t know. But like I said, we survive this, we’re gonna go to therapy and find out.”
Dean yawns and clicks the little camera icon on the screen. Cas has, unsurprisingly, taken very few photos. There are what seem to be some accidental blurry shots of the floor, and one selfie of Cas and older Dean.
I really appreciate all of your lovely and thoughtful comments! I have many that I have not replied to yet, but I do read them and they do bring that good, good serotonin.
Andy shifts and the bed makes little popping noises. He doesn't say anything for a minute, and then his fingers, which have been moving over the covers, find Dean's leg.
Dean shakes and gasps and gives in, because there's no alternative, because he never gave in when Cas was alive, and now all he can do is this. He stays until he's so low his forehead is touching the ground and he's reduced to periodic muscle spasms. Until everything in him is quiet and spent. Until the suns starts to dip in the sky and the light turns that golden liminal shade that makes everything a little more beautiful, a little more calm.
and the sudden knowledge that there was a deficit, a famine, before this thing was known.
Dean wanted kids of his own once. He'd liked Lisa a lot, of course, maybe even loved her, but half of loving Lisa was in being something like a dad again. When he'd moved in with them, he'd just lost Sam, and spending time with Ben had hurt and healed him at the same time. He'd kept thinking how he'd do it right this time, how this time he wasn't just a four-year-old struggling to hold his baby brother. And then the thoughts of Sam would shut him down and he'd end up closing off Ben anyway.
Dean rolls his eyes. Cas is definitely fucking weird, but Dean thinks, in spite of himself, that he kinda likes the guy. Not
Cas doesn't remember that much. Just a hand of one of his brothers, Gabriel, he thinks, pointing the wet, sloppy thing out to him.
It doesn’t actually kill humans, it insists.
A week or two after Cas tried to explain about the complicated and mostly colonized idea of gender, Dean comes out to the kitchen one morning in a gray and pink flannel shirt. Sam is sitting at the breakfast nook in his t-shirt and sweatpants, drinking a green smoothie and flipping through newspapers. He looks up at Dean's entrance and frowns, forehead creasing as he takes in his brother.
Chapter title from
The memory blurs and twists, and twenty-six-year-old Dean is saying "I could come with you," as John packs up a bag.
Dean steps between them, puts his hand on Sam's shoulder and presses him gently back.
Years ago, a couple of decades, maybe, he'd picked up another children's series supposedly promoting the devil. This one had been a little different than the others. Usually, Cas found all the censorship and talk of heresy to be nothing more than projection and hypocrisy.
It might be the first time in the last two years that Dean has had a proper internalized moment of presence.
"See you Friday." Dean stands and gives his brother a quick one-armed hug. Now-Dean thinks about how easy it looks, quick and affectionate and familial. There's usually something desperate and grieving in touch for Dean. There's a lump in his throat at the thought that he and Sammy are somewhere in life that lets them both trust this won't be the last hug.
Dean tried. He tried so damn hard. He'd given everything for his family, everything he ever had to offer.
"It's complicated, Dean. Sentient as in experiencing emotions? Sentient as in able to comprehend God?" Cas shrugs. "I can't answer that. I only know that they are conscious and complex. Human science has tried for so long to study trees as individuals, or on human time, but that simply isn't how they operate. We're talking about individual trees that work together as a wholly different kind of organism, that form symbiotic relationships with the natural world around them to the extent that they play a part in other organisms' evolutionary tracts. We're talking about hundreds or thousands of years, living on a scale outside of what scientists have been able to study. So, sentient? Perhaps not. Perhaps it's all chemicals. But then, so are you."
When he looks back up, he's not expecting to see grief in Cas' eyes.
Those thoughts always left Dean feeling guilty and a little ashamed. He'd always tried to quash them, always told himself he wasn't allowed.
desire on more than an intellectual plain since… Well, it’s been a long goddamn time. He swallows and looks away from Cas, taking a sip of his coffee. It’s hot and strong. He’ll finish it in the sleepy companionable silence with Cas, maybe have some toast, and then he’ll go do some small repairs on the chicken coop while Cas busies himself in the newest raised bed. Dean will make them lunch, and they might spend part of the afternoon together doing nothing, or playing checkers now that Cas has discovered an aptitude for it, or maybe they’ll have sex with the full height of the afternoon sun streaming through their window and making Cas’ eyes shine bluer than ever.
"Twenty-six," Dean says grudgingly. He doesn't add that he can't imagine how he would end up at Stanford anytime soon. He and Sam haven't spoken in about three years. The first year, Sam tried to stay in touch, but Dean was still angry and hurt and he'd made those conversations short and stilted. Now, Sam calls Bobby once a year and Bobby calls Dean, who eventually drops into the conversation with his dad the fact that Sam is still alive and, apparently, doing well.
Door number two is still whole, still has its number clearly visible above the door frame.
Sam didn't need to give the excruciating details, he'd just, haltingly, sketched out what it was like in the cage, to be at the focus of all that wrath. He'd told Eileen that, in the beginning, he'd just tried to do what Dean would have done, what Dean had taught him by example their whole life. Sam had tried to stay between Lucifer and Adam, for all the difference it made. Lucifer wasn't interested in him, and Michael would have protected him if he was, just on principle.
"Name one, dumbass."
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean muttered. He’d have laughed it off if they were both sober, but it felt too big like this, and Dean was too opened to it. He wanted Cas to want him.
“You’re doing good, Jack,” Sam says, because it’s all he knows how to say. “We’re going to do this.”
There is a soft glow around Cas' hands and a quick burst of warmth over Dean's knees, and it's done. The dull ache is gone. Dean takes an experimental step backward, rubs both hands over his jeans. He can't feel any sensitivity there at all.
house, but it's got a little backyard and the neighborhood doesn't look too rough. Now-Dean and Cas watch as other-Dean opens up the trunk of the Impala.
"Get your toothbrush, Sammy," Dean says to his brother, who hasn't moved from the bed. Sam is frowning down at his book, but at Dean's words he sighs and tosses it into his own bag. While he's grabbing their toiletries, Dean turns to their dad to ask him something, and that's when he realizes.
“He doesn’t treat you right,” Dean says, and he’s surprised by the words and their ferocity. He hadn’t really meant to say it, hadn’t known how angry it would sound. He doesn’t add anything stupid, like
It does not escape Sam’s notice that this is the very reversal of Dean protecting Sam by keeping him in the dark about what their dad was really doing during their childhood. Of course, Sam doesn’t like any parallels that place John next to Chuck, but it can’t be helped.
Rhonda clears her throat. "How exactly did you get a rescue lobster in the first place?"
Young Dean ends up going back to bed, so when Sam returns to the bunker just as dawn light is creeping into the navy Kansas sky, he finds only Jack in the kitchen. Jack is waiting for him, coffee percolating in the background, and Sam's tired and spilling over with fondness. He ruffles Jack's hair too, on his way to the fridge.
Dean has a vague recollection of the number four being associated with death in some cultures, but he can't remember where or why. Sam would know.
Hot, angry, jealous tears spill down now-Dean's cheeks and he bites his tongue, trying to hold it all in.
They'd driven back to the sign for the road leading to the Gila National Forest entrance, Dean regalling Cas with stories of his old school days truancy.
“Okay, well did he eat anything today?”
Dean heaves in a breath, lets it out. “Look, don’t laugh.”
Dean presses his forehead to Cas’ and closes his eyes for a moment. When his voice comes out it’s choked. It’s as raw as he’s feeling. “I’m living in the light.”
The day after Dean’s emotionally turbulent snooping efforts, Eileen stops by in the evening. Sam and older Dean are holed up doing
Dean has no idea when was the last time someone held him.
Levi’s eyebrows lifted higher. “Oh,” he said, laughing. “Oh, you didn’t realize? Bro, pretty much everyone here is gay, or bicurious or whatever. And if they’re not, then they’re cool with it. This is kind of like the unofficial GSA house for the university.”
"Oh, hey," Dean says, reaching automatically to wipe the blood away with the sleeve of his jacket. He stops himself just in time, flustered again and annoyed with himself for feeling like some jittery schoolboy on a first date. He digs in his pockets and finds some wadded up napkins that don't appear to be too gross. "Uh, here, you've got a nosebleed." He shoves the napkins at Cas.
After lunch, they get back to researching. Dean finds it a little easier to sit still now that he's had a couple of meals, but not much. He reads at the table, then in one of the comfier chairs in the living room area, then lying on the floor with his feet up on the chair, book held directly above his face. Which is how Sam finds him when he checks in again several hours later.
An indulgent note: The playlist for this fic is just the songs "My Ghost" by The Shondes, and "Pray to God" by Calvin Harris/HAIM played on repeat, if you're interested in that sort of thing.
"Pansexual. It's - you know what? Nevermind, it's not important. The point is that literally no one cares, except you - I mean, future you. The other Dean. God this is still weird. I'm just saying, I'm sorry I'm bringing it up, I know you're not ready to talk about it and we don't have to. Just. Try not to have a crisis over it in front of Dean? Please."
"I know. But happiness isn't just in the having."
"Are you sure?" Cas managed to get out, escaping from Dean's mouth just long enough to breathe out the words. His fingers were already reaching down to touch Dean, already finding that point of heat and rubbing tantalizingly against it.
a reference to The Magicians
Dean thinks, not for the first time, that he should probably compliment Cas more. He’s tried in the past, but the only way it comes out is sarcastic. Besides, there’s a lot of “shoulds” when it comes to Cas, too many to ever really make up at this point. He should take Cas out on an actual date, should hold his hand in public, should be open about their relationship or whatever it is they’re doing, should tell Cas he loves him with actual words. Not that Cas doesn’t know, but that’s not the point.
Earp licks Dean's hand in response, and Dean can't help grinning at her. Sometimes he's half-convinced Earp understands him.
It takes a few more minutes of convincing before they leave the ladies disappointed but resigned to salt and burn.
Sam rolls his eyes. “C’mon, Dean. You guys are weird, but you’re weird in like an intense, compatible way.”
There's a moment of silence that hangs heavy between them.
For an indeterminable stretch of time, there is just the creaking noises of the older heater and the thud of the ball.
“What?” Jack looks between the two Deans, his eyebrows drawn together. Dean can see the resemblance to Cas in that sort of innocent confusion, even if Cas isn’t his biological father.
Dean talks about Sam in a way he rarely has. Once he starts in earnest, he can’t really stop. He tells Hank about carrying Sammy out of their burning house at four years old, his arms barely strong enough to support a six-month-old’s weight, about how from that night on he’d had to be a caregiver, how he’d known it was his job to look out for his little brother but that he didn’t always know how to do it.
