John set that aside with a sigh. Shane looked at him questioningly, but John looked away. Why bother trying to explain? It didn’t really matter anyway.
“I should get some sleep.” John said, swinging his legs off the bed. “Hey – you might want to reassure Victor that your affair didn't harm you. He feels very guilty.”
“Yes, John!” Sherlock stared up at me, our eyes locked. I was starting to sweat with the effort and our bodies slid together. I felt his prick between us and reached a hand down, jacked him as I fucked him. Watching his face was beautiful, seeing the play of pleasure, of emotion, on his features. His eyes were dark with arousal, his lips parted, and I saw it, I saw the exact moment he gave in to me, trusted that I could keep him safe. That he could let go, because I had him. His orgasm began, washing over him, through him. I felt it in his body, the tightening, the shuddering wracking his entire being. His prick jumped in my hand and his seed wet my fingers, wet our bodies as I continued to move. “John! Yesss... John...” He cried.
Shane shrugged. "Since you slept with him..." His manner turned sincere, his eyes sad. "I don't know if this will work. Sherlock... he doesn't make it easy to like him... but I... I don't want to lose you, John..."
Lestrade sighed, got a glove from a tech and gave it to Sherlock who snapped it on. With his gloved hand, Sherlock opened her mouth. “Some dentistry but no orthodontia.” He remarked. He pulled up an eyelid and peered at her eyes one at a time. “No petechiae… distinct chafing on her neck and… under her arms… here by her shoulder...”
He was feeling better, that was obvious. His cough no longer left him breathless and exhausted. And he'd got dressed. But he was in a mood.
John felt his smile grow. He picked up the pint carton of milk and poured the right amount into his tea and stirred it. It was hot, but he sipped anyway. It was heaven.
She closed her eyes and ruminated for a long moment. “We went to Venice, just the two of us.” She said finally. “This was before he met Seb, before smartphones and GPS. Venice is a maze, a puzzle, a wonderful place to get lost...
John laughed. There was semen on his chest. I leaned over and licked it, savouring the bleachy bitterness of it. I didn’t know if it was his or mine or both, but I loved the thought of our DNA comingled. I swallowed and licked his chest again, tasting the salt of sweat along with the pearly seed.
My cry roused him and he looked up at me with such sadness and longing it took my breath away. Then he blinked and the sadness was gone. Hidden.
And he HAD Sherlock! John was unprepared for the fierce joy that gave him. Between his anger, Shane, and his fear of Sherlock's selfishness, he'd not let himself consider what it would be like to HAVE him, to really be together.
“Do you want me to go?” Shane asked. He didn’t look upset or disappointed. Had John imagined that earlier?
I let Greg do the talking inside the hospital. A profound numbness was overtaking me, my brain buzzed with it.
I nodded and took her head in my hands, at chin and temple. Her eyes followed my movements – that was good. “Can you tell me who the prime minister is?” I asked her.
My execution. It was easy to forget about it – it would happen some indeterminate time in the future and before then there was heroin. But when I remembered – usually when I was painfully sober – it was a great comfort. I would die and the pain would stop and John would never see what I had become.
Walter's laugh is an unamused bark. "You think I don't know?! After almost thirty years, I STILL find myself looking for ways to score."
John didn’t question. He used the wall and someone’s back to clamber up and jump… they grabbed at each other, hands desperately entwining, clinging. Then the Omega started hauling John up. John got his fingertips then his hands then his arms over the top… someone started yanking on his feet, trying to pull him back down. The Omega wrapped his arms around his torso and John kicked at the grabbing hands. He lost a shoe, but somehow, he managed to gain the top.
Sherlock shuddered. “Every Alpha’s wet dream, an Omega in heat.” He looked at Lestrade thoughtfully. “Your parents… you must have moved a lot when you were a child.”
“I said stay out of it.” John didn’t raise his voice, but he didn’t have to. He used his command voice, his ‘Captain Watson’ voice. He sounded dangerous. John waited until Sherlock nodded.
I froze. A tidal wave of pain crashed over me, obliterating the numbness and pushing me to my knees. A great sob ripped through me, choked me. I heard a keening, and realized it came from my own throat.
He’d also played unrefereed rugby for years, wrestled all through college, taken mixed martial arts classes and been through hand-to-hand combat training in the RAMC. John could handle himself in a fight.
They’d also started going to the shooting range again. Even injured and shooting with his non-dominant hand, the Alpha was a better shot than Sherlock. It was irritating.
John was working on letting go of his absurd overprotectiveness. It was easier now that the heat pheromones were fading. Still, his instincts were telling him to get between this person and his mate. They were telling him to threaten the Beta and force him out the door. They were telling him to put a proprietary hand on his Omega and snarl at the outsider. John did none of those things. He cleared his throat. “Ahem... who are you?”
I wanted to tell him not to call me 'kid'... but no one had ever said I was beautiful... HE was beautiful, chocolate brown all over and so strong! I loved how his big hands felt on me, how our skin felt against each other...
Long minutes later, the coppers finally arrived and the thieves were handed over. John, Mike and the other men who had acted were taken to a station house to give statements, along with the bartender and a few of the other patrons. When John looked around, the blonde man in the unusual dark green overcoat was not among them.
“Oh, erm, this is D.C. Lestrade of Scotland Yard and this is my bondmate, Sherlock Holmes – he consults for the police. This is Dr. Murray – he was a year ahead of me in medical school.” Bill shook Lestrade’s hand and nodded respectfully at Sherlock.
I lay back at a loss. “It’s... it’s everything. You love women – you desire women. I don’t even know what you’re doing in my bed.”
He touched Sherlock's hand, then batted at it restlessly. "Angus said something about you and a dead man?"
Sherlock sunk back into depression. He slept a lot, ate little and spoke less. He missed the lovely reprieve that heroin had allowed, but he found it difficult to care really. Nothing mattered.
It seemed that Sherlock – whether due to his Omega instinct or his observational genius – had sussed more of Moriarty’s true self than Mycroft or Mummy…
The man picked him up – he was strong! – and carried John into the light. He dropped John onto some sort of hammock that cradled him. He was still incredibly uncomfortable, the bindings rubbing his skin raw, his buttocks inflamed and starting to bruise, but it felt immensely better than the hard floor.
Sherlock bolted the door – noting the heavy-duty security bar that fit across it – and followed the voice.
“Yeah.” John said feeling confused – through their link, Sherlock projected no feelings about the boy. None of the fear-tinged tension he felt around his family, no dread and loathing as he had with Moriarty, no interest or irritation as with Lestrade and Gregson and the other police, none of the fondness and lust he felt for John. Nothing.
“Ah yes.” Mycroft did not look ready to forgive the oversight, but he tucked the emotion away. “You were ambitious.”
“I want you to be comfortable.” I said, jacking his long, slim prick with one hand and brushing an errant curl from his cheek with the other.
I found him waiting for me the next day. He pressed me against a tree and snogged me whilst we rubbed our cocks together – mine was as long as his, but his was wider. I wanted to suck him again, but I didn't know how to ask.
“Sherlock doesn’t really have anyone else.” John told Angus. “He’s… challenging. Most people don’t take to him. That’s all it is.”
Nazer made an impatient noise and stood up. I cowered – he was prone to lashing out when frustrated. But he just threw some things into a mesh bag, flung a towel over my shoulder and pushed me out of his cell.
Finally, finally he was all the way in. He caressed Sherlock's back, murmuring encouragements, then pulled back until only the head remained, and smoothly pushed back in.
I was stunned – and suddenly completely exhausted. “I don’t need an OBE, Mycroft.” I said. “I just want to see Sherlock.”
Sherlock collapsed, arms around John's neck as his softening cock slipped out of the stretched hole.
John heaved the stocky woman into the knot of flailing, fighting bodies. It gave him two or three seconds – he turned back to the Omega and bending, laced his fingers together. “Come on.” John gritted. “I’ll boost you over the wall.”
The gunfire had thinned overnight. Now there was the occasional crack of a pistol or the bup-bup-bup of an automatic rifle, but mostly it was eerily silent — no traffic, no trains, no sirens, no voices or strains of music. Nothing.
Hiding that from Moriarty had been paramount, which unfortunately meant hiding it from John. Needs must and all, but it chafed. I knew a relationship such as ours thrived on honesty...
“Gregory, you have made me the happiest of men.” Mycroft said. “But no, it’s not proper to feel so lucky, so delighted, during a national crisis of this magnitude.”
She laughed again, a merry sound like the tinkling of little bells. It made me feel warm inside, and happy... suddenly I saw how right Sherlock was – Mary WAS exactly the type of woman I had always been drawn to. I HAD to question everything I knew about her – was she really like this? Or was she playing a role, trying to get me to like her? Had she been cast in this role? Coached, taught, to be someone I found attractive?
I snapped on my lamp and cringed from the sudden blast of light. As my eyes adjusted, I discovered John had put a glass of water and a bottle of ibuprofen on my bed table. He'd also plugged my phone into the charger and put that in its usual spot there too.
And maybe he’d left a sniper behind to kill me. To rub salt in Sherlock’s mortal wounds from beyond the grave – he forced Sherlock over the edge of the roof to save me (Because what else would have convinced him? Sherlock didn’t give a shit if people thought he was a fake.) and now he’d have me killed anyway. The sniper could have me in his crosshairs this very moment.
“Ok.” I said. I distanced myself from the hurt. I wondered coldly where this was going. Had he seduced the boss? Taken advantage of a crush one of the villains had had?
John was loath to let him go, but he yielded, backing up to give himself enough room to maneuver if Victor tried anything – Victor was taller and had thirty pounds of muscle on John, yet I was completely confident that John could handle him.
I stopped myself from rolling my eyes. “Is that his photo?” I asked turning her phone so I could see. “That’s a good one – airdrop it to me.” She did and I checked my smartphone to make sure I’d gotten it. (Too bad I had to go on a date with the man for the cops to get almost exactly this!)
Sherlock protested when I pulled him to his feet again. “Just a little farther.” I assured him. “Just up to your room.” But he was done in. Victor helped me carry him up the two flights and settle him gently in an overstuffed chair in front of a roaring fire where I could undress him.
"Yeah. Yes. Go check out the labs on the third floor..." The nurse visibly made a decision, his face becoming determined. "Ask for Peter Smythe. He's a friend, I'll let him know you're coming by. You're not his type, but he likes it if you flirt with him anyway."
I shook off the restraining hands, my shout echoing through my mind. <> I knelt in the gutter, sick with shock, dizzy and nauseous, and threw up. I’d eaten very little since Sherlock and I had been arrested – and escaped – but my body heaved and heaved long after there was anything to expel. They’d taken him away on a stretcher... maybe he survived the fall... I needed to follow them (no pulse in his limp arm)... I needed to be certain.
John just stared at him. He looked serious. They both did. John looked down at the carton of Pad Thai. His reviving mood sank again. How was he supposed to take a portion of the bloody Pad Thai with only one hand!?
There were seven corpses in the cooler. Sherlock unzipped the closest – an elderly woman. He zipped her bag back up and unzipped the next. The third bag contained Simon Fraser. Sherlock completely opened the body bag. Simon Fraser's body was nude and untouched – an autopsy had not yet been performed. He examined the body closely, Fraser appeared to have been physical fit and well-muscled. He had a bit of softness at the belly, but was otherwise trim. Sherlock checked the eyes for petechial hemorrhaging indicative of suffocation, but found nothing. He looked for any bruising – there was the expected discoloration on the inside of the left arm where the I.V. had been, but no other bruising. Sherlock searched for needle marks – as a user of heroin, Sherlock knew all the places to look: between the fingers and toes, behind the knees... then he found it, a single puncture under the scrotum with the barest of blue shading around it.
Mycroft was wearing a three-piece suit in a muted tartan and a tie with the tightest, straightest Windsor knot Lestrade had ever seen. He wanted to peel it off the other man, piece by bloody, bespoke piece, and run his hands over the vulnerable skin underneath.
Sherlock put those thoughts away – regret changed nothing. Instead he leaned back in his chair and watched John. He'd shed the tartan shirt and donned the prosthetic. He was using the hook mostly as a counter – to steady the pan whilst he stirred, to hold veg still as he cut, to press a bottle to his hip as he unscrewed the cap. Sherlock could see his delts and lats rippling under the cotton vest, see his biceps flexing casually as he worked. John had lost the softness around his middle that he'd had before Sherlock left, and he'd apparently turned to exercise to combat his grief. He looked amazing. Sherlock wanted to peel the jeans off and watch his glutes flex and firm as he moved from counter to stove. Sherlock felt sparks of interest from his cock – it was like watching porn (if Sherlock watched porn). He could unbutton his trousers and stroke himself watching the dance of John's muscles. He imagined John's expression if Sherlock climaxed sitting here in the kitchen whilst John cooked – the combination of surprise, disapproval, irritation and bemusement would be delightful.
I was desperate to calm him, to show him how much I loved him. How much I wanted him! I didn’t expect sex at that point, I just wanted to reassure him somehow. But he had become aroused again and I had taken him in hand – taken us both in hand – and made love to him best I knew how.
“To win? To beat ME? His nemesis. His obsession. Of course, he would. You KNOW he would. After everything he did to engineer my disgrace, my suicide, the lengths he went to. You were part of it. You knew him. You know he would have done whatever it took.”
There was a shot from inside the house and Anwen screamed. As we ran, I heard shouting inside the house.
Mycroft was startled — he really hadn’t thought Lestrade knew? But he recovered quickly, the smallest upturn of his lips saying so much: rue at being caught out, pleasure in Lestrade’s response, an invitation for more...
“Sure.” The nurse put his hand on John’s shoulder. “I know this bloody well sucks, but you are going to be OK.”
“Promise me, Sherlock, promise me that IF Moriarty is somehow set free, we will deal with him together.”
John jogged confidently through turning after turning, looking back for us before disappearing around each one. I wondered if he was just getting us lost. The last thing we wanted was to be trapped in a dead end with a gunman behind us.
John knew what Shane liked, how to tease him, how to kiss him – where to kiss him. It didn't surprise John to feel Shane's prick jutting firmly against his inner thigh. He flexed his legs, applying pressure and Shane moaned through their kiss.
in thirty years. He grinned at Mycroft, taking in his kiss-red lips and mussed hair, the disarrangement of his clothes. Seeing him without a tie was… shocking. Lestrade thought he could get used to it. He could grow to quite like it.
“We were at an impasse.” I interjected forcefully. “Jim and me. I knew he could call you off – you and the other snipers. He knew that I could work out how, that I could make him tell me. Jim understood me – my genius – better than anyone. He understood what I am capable of – that I am capable of everything he was. Everything. He shot himself, killed himself, so I couldn’t make him tell me how to stop you killing my friends, so I’d HAVE to jump. He killed himself because it was the only way he could win.”
He reached and turned off the light then pressed himself against me. Our bodies fit together so perfectly.
He felt Shane's hand in his hair and smiled. John pulled him down for a kiss. "Mm – you both look much better. I'm starving, do you think you can organize some takeaway? I'd give my left hand for a curry."
It took a moment for his words to sink in and then it took everything in me not to pull away from him. Sherlock felt the tension in my body regardless and his misery increased. He moved to stand up, but I held him more tightly.
Without thinking, Sherlock stepped forward and embraced John, seeking only to comfort him. And for long seconds, John WAS comforted – he wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist and held him tightly.
"Take your shirt off – carefully, there's probably glass on it." Sherlock dutifully unbuttoned his shirt. When he pulled it off, there was a sharp pain in his shoulder – the glass pulling out with the cloth – and a wave of nausea. "You have a couple nicks." John said. "Only the shoulder is deep. Take your trousers off."
Sherlock was admitted. The process took several hours – John stayed with him, fretting about what damage the GBH and the concussion together could wreak on Sherlock's brain.
“No talking!” Angus boomed. He didn’t seem worried at all that someone might hear him. The thick accumulation of dust and grit told why – this sub level of this hospital was all but forgotten. Someone must maintain the mechanicals, but no one ventured far into the mountains of junk.
But they wouldn't come. Eventually he turned off the water. A few minutes later, he realized he was still standing in the shower when the shivers started. He was wet and cold.
“Fine.” I said, calculating instantly that a hit of heroin cost £4.45 here, and slouched out of our cell. I idly wondered how many deliveries I’d have to make to earn £4.45.
Sherlock looked at Shane, really looked at him. He saw the set of his jaw, the way his eyes kept sliding towards John, the way he hid behind his tousled flop of hair and hunched into his rumpled shirt.
Sherlock paused before opening the door. He turned to John and reached out and touched his face. Then he pushed John's back to the wall, pinning John's wrists and shoving his pelvis forward to grind against his groin. John struggled half-heartedly, but didn't resist Sherlock's kiss.
“Oh!” John mumbled. Shane kissed him once more, then slipped off the couch onto his knees. He was tugging at John’s pants – John sat up and helped him.
Lestrade ducked his head. “Yeah. She manages.” He mumbled. “Anyway, I’d be curious to know if this is something all Omegas can do.”
What must it be like in Sherlock's head? What must it be like to see so much all the time? To know so much about everyone with a glance –the good, the bad, the distasteful. His brilliance made him different from other people – he must have developed defenses against information overload... defenses that included turning off his own emotions, never letting anyone in. Never getting close.
John caught sight of the Omega. He was beautiful. Tall and slim with a mass of dark curls and flashing silver eyes. His neck was bared, a long, ivory expanse that John longed to press his mouth against, to taste.
That’s what Sherlock was afraid of. Bonding with Jim would be like sinking into black tar. Jim wanted to break him,
The shower was nirvana. He washed away the horror of the last twenty-four hours, scrubbing himself with soap and a flannel, sudsing the crisp bits out of his hair... some of the things that he’d done…
Lestrade got his way — and he got a few hours’ restless sleep on Sherlock’s bed, next to Mrs Hudson.
Sherlock turned back to me and let me caress his jaw – he leaned into my hand. “I wouldn’t seek it out. John, I don’t want anyone else.”
I scoffed and shared another portentous smile with him. “Would you like to get a drink with me sometime?” I asked, feeling nervous sweat blooming under my arms. “This week maybe?”
“That has nothing to do with HIM.” I scoffed. “Most people are simply too dull to spend an hour with – let alone enough time to qualify as a relationship. I have standards.” I told him loftily. “I couldn’t bear to settle for just any Mariah or Brenda or Jan.” These were the names of John’s last three girlfriends, and it pissed him off.
John's heart sank. Shane WOULD give up Sherlock to trying and help John. He should have anticipated something like this - he should have prepared Shane.
…until a paramedic was bitten, infected, and turned on the coppers around him, biting two before they could restrain him. Lestrade watched as those two began to bite their fellows — then it was a melee, fighting the infected — other coppers! — with batons...
Bruno wasn't the sort of gay man who went in for decorating, apparently. The sparse furnishings had all seen better days, but they had been expensive once, well-made. The openness of the space was pleasing. The only bit of clutter in the room was Bruno's desk – he was a writer. True crime, Sherlock recalled with slight distaste. Of course the one book he'd read had been exhaustively researched, well-written, accurate and compelling. Sherlock hadn't been able to find fault with it. That didn't change the fact that most copies were sold in drugstores and airports, Sherlock reminded himself with petty satisfaction.
“I know I’m arrogant – too arrogant.” My voice broke but I got myself under control quickly. “One look and I knew I could help you. I did it for my vanity at first... but very quickly, I knew I had to do everything I could to keep you near me.”
What had I been thinking? John chased after anything in a skirt – he'd pulled on three continents! He was getting a leg over with Mariah... how had I thought I might tempt him away... I was an idiot.
“Congratulations, John.” James Sholto didn’t bother covering his surprise – Alphas of John’s class and social standing never bonded. “How did that come about?”
I couldn't get enough of him – and he never seemed to tire of me. Amazing in retrospect, knowing how tiresome most people are.
I returned to the closed door – the loo, it had to be. I stood aside and twisted the nob, flinging the door inward, as I had at the front door. I flashed my gun then swung into the room – I almost pulled the trigger! A figure lurked behind the closed shower curtain. But at the last millisecond I recognised it was unmoving. And I recognised the odour. I pulled back the curtain, still pointing the gun directly at what I discovered to be a shovel and empty quicklime bags sitting on top of a corpse packed in the stuff. The flat’s unfortunate tenant.
Moran dropped a pile of clothes at Sherlock’s feet. “Those are his.” He said. Then he plugged in the kettle and readied the teapot.
More importantly, this Alpha – whilst marinating in a sea of Alpha testosterone – had managed to push aside his deeply ingrained base instincts long enough to see Sherlock’s fear, to help him escape. Sherlock wasn’t stupid enough to think he would be safe with the man, he was an Alpha and Sherlock was an unbonded Omega on the very brink of his heat, but when he’d set his foot in the man’s hands and balanced himself with fingers on the man’s shoulder, he’d caught the Alpha’s individual scent. He’d liked it immediately.
John reached around for Sherlock’s penis and caressing it, found it erect and only slightly damp at the tip. The Omega’s climax had been entirely internal. John was astonished and delighted and just a little bit proud of himself.
But John… John was different. Sherlock had known he was different the moment he’d caught his scent. And now the empathetic bond reinforced his impression. Yes, John had the aggression and ambition of every Alpha. But in him, they weren’t alarming – they were exciting!  John was
“Oh! Good! What do I… Hey! Erm… what…” Sherlock grabbed the Alpha’s cock and started stroking. “Sherlock!”
“I was about your age when I bonded with my Virginia. Everyone knows that new bondmates need to spend a week or two together after the heat – and you’ve had two and a half – but honestly, Watson, I think that’s bullshit.”
“Why don’t you shower first.” John suggested. It was time to end this tiny oasis of love and making love in the desert of betrayal and pain that was his relationship with Sherlock. He’d put it off as long as he could.

John had never heard Sherlock play. The Omega had mentioned it briefly during the heady, lust-addled conversation before they bonded, but John had not thought of it since.
He handed me the spyglass and pointed. I followed his direction and after a moment, found myself looking down on the front windows of our flat. The curtains were drawn as I had left them. “It’s our flat. But it’s just the curtains…”
“Oh? Yes! I too am pleased.” Mycroft simply stared at him for a moment, holding his hand. Then his face fell again and he cleared his throat. “Whilst it is
The other suspects… no one was standing out. Sherlock wanted to talk it through with John again, that often jump started his brain. Although it hadn’t thus far… what was the motive? Why had the killer chosen THESE patients? Sherlock had managed to comb through the morgue records, these were the only two suspicious deaths, the only two to die of GBH poisoning who hadn’t come into the A&E with it.
Sherlock shot a glance over his shoulder at Lestrade and observed that the policeman was just about to get to his point. Sherlock waited.
“It won’t make any difference, John.” Sherlock said, starting to pace. “You heard him, he doesn’t get his hands dirty. He’ll be out there – he’s a spider in the middle of a vast web...”
Shane laughed out loud. "He's incredibly selfish!" His laughter died and he touched John's face gently. "Maybe that's why you SHOULD keep me around – to have something of your own, something that has nothing to do with him."
"Oh yes, I remember it, sir. He said his friend had been killed by that detective who committed suicide. You remember that, sir, it was in all the papers."
"I'm not making it up, am I." The stocky northerner said, concern on his face. He put his hand on John's shoulder. "Have there been other  instances of forgetfulness?"

to search that office.” Sherlock said. “It’s empty right now, this is the perfect time – before anyone has a chance to destroy files or erase hard drives. You can find Molly.”
He was a shite father. Lestrade had no idea how John Watson did it alone. Even with Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson to help, he couldn’t fathom it.
a baby at all, not when he thought about everything that entailed. Not just the pregnancy and birth but caring for it. Infants were needy and messy and disruptive and incredibly time-consuming. And they didn’t grow out of it, not for years and years. Sherlock
Eventually I heard John climbing the stairs. He paused in the doorway. "Sherlock?" He asked, blind in the dark room.
As a matter of fact, they had – or rather, we’d agreed it wasn’t a good fit, the clinic and I. It’s too bad, I rather liked it there. Camden has more than its share of interesting patients. When I spend all day taking temperatures and dispensing paracetamol, a stabbing now and again livens things up.
“Sherlock came by my office about a week ago.” Lestrade said, pouring a measure of whisky in each of our glasses.
I couldn’t breathe. All the oxygen had been sucked out of the world. I stood there gasping desperately like a fish out of water. The vacuum around me was the entire universe, the planets and the stars, asteroids, comets, everything. It was beautiful. And it was all made of pain.
I kissed him, relearning his mouth – lush bottom lip, teeth, searching tongue, faint stubble on his cheek, the outrageous divot that defined his upper lip...
“No.” Mycroft replied. “Most of Sherlock’s estate is part of the family holding and reverts to me as the family heir. But he left you everything else.”
If he’d been along, the whole thing would have been a grand adventure – a romantic vacation even – instead of a slog. Instead of struggling for my life, John would be there with his gun and his impressive fighting skills....
He caught up to his bondmate at the rusted hull of the derelict barge. It was unclear if the barge was part of the tip or if it had simply pulled up one day to take garbage downriver and been subsumed.
"I don't know. Men are more apt to be violent. Women are more likely to be angels of mercy killers... since I ruled out Nurse Measing, I have to go back over everyone who had opportunity both nights."
“Ha!” I swept him awkwardly into my lap – John laughed and caressed my cheek. “It’s not the sex.” I said, staring into his hazel-gray eyes. “Well, it’s not JUST the sex.”
Could he send a message? He didn’t know. John had heard all sorts of things about what empathetic links could and couldn’t do. He hadn’t thought about any of it since his link with Sherlock was formed – it had seemed completely natural, not invasive or overwhelming. It felt like a part of himself he’d been missing.
"No, he can't. He THINKS he can, but he's shite at it. Jesus! I have to go back! I have to help him!"
But at home, when we were alone, John would touch my shoulder or my hair when he walked by. He would kiss me chastely, his warm lips pressed against mine, when he got home – or even if he had been out of the room. When I spoke to him, John would look up from whatever he’d been doing and smile warmly, his eyes crinkling in a way I’d never seen before. He was ... vulnerable... with me in such... precious ways. I was vulnerable with him too... no, I was honest with him now.
Shane had been fantastic all that day. He had pointed out what John had missed in the coppers' expressions: wonder; approbation; RESPECT. John, unarmed, had taken down a villain one handed that most of them wouldn't have the first idea how to take down with two.
3. Political. Arrested at a demonstration. Convicted on trumped up charges. Relatively smart. Knows how to fight. Bottom bunk.
“What are you doing?” Mycroft demanded. He had access to all the CCTV in the country (and quite a bit from the continent) on his laptop – which I was busily making use of. Mycroft commandeered the screen. “I should have known!” He said disapprovingly. “You have to rid yourself of this morbid curiosity and get to work!”
John scraped his teeth down my neck. I tried to follow him, but he had a fistful of my hair and held me back. He tongued my nipple – the one without the piercing – then bit into it savagely. I shuddered in pleasure. John lengthened his strokes on my cock to drag over the Prince Albert, pulling at the stainless steel ring, tugging it and my cockhead to and fro with brutal indifference.
It wasn’t a playful, lingering fuck as we were wont to do, he didn’t ride my cock, all hot and horny, or bend over the bed and wiggle his perfect arse. He didn’t joke about fucking me again – an experiment that hadn’t gone wrong, exactly, but hadn’t been quite right either. He was somber and intense, even a bit tearful as I brought him to orgasm with all the skill I could muster.
Every corridor looked exactly the same! No matter how many turnings I took, I was in an identical alley, still-sodden grass beneath my feet, five meter shrubbery walls to either side. Goddamn Gereth Llewellyn to hell! What had possessed me to follow him into this bloody hedge maze!? And where had he disappeared to?!
“How did you manage to jab him where you did?” Shane interjected, his curiosity momentarily outweighing caution. “Under his testicles?”
Using the momentum of her punch, John twisted her arm over his back, throwing her to the floor. She landed hard, the breath knocked out of her – that gave John the second he needed. He kicked her in the head before she could start to get up and she dropped with a moan. He stomped and kicked her over and over and over until he felt her skull turn soft under his boot.
"It takes as long as it takes." John told him. "I was still mourning Sherlock two years after he left."
John was very tempted. He felt GOOD right now, better than he had in fifteen months, maybe more. He wanted to hold onto that feeling.
Mary paused, searching for the right words. “Fun.” She said. “He was tremendous fun. He had adventures... he loved games – he played them all the time... that’s how we met, he got me involved in a game he was playing. I think if I‘d met him any other way, I would have told him to naff off. But I was completely charmed.”
John turned around. “We can’t split up.” He said preemptively. “Don’t ask me to leave you alone in this place.
There had been three Omegas in the tent, each strapped to a gurney. John hadn’t stopped to examine the equipment or the supplies surrounding his sister, he’d simply grabbed Harry and bolted. Bill Murray had taken one of the other Omegas and then gone back for the third whilst John had rung the cops from a public call box and reported the location of the whorehouse. If he’d also happened to say it was on fire, well, he’d wanted to be certain the place would be shut down.
I cut him off. “Mary’s better suited than I could ever be.” I felt the heaviness of truth in those words. “I’ve only brought you trouble. Pain.”
John had bounced back after his other kidnappings. There were nightmares, especially after Moriarty and the semtex vest, but John never mentioned them and they faded over time.
Selfishly, I had not wanted to tell him anything, or at least I thought I could wait to tell him, put off the difficult conversation as long as possible. But I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t be intimate with him with infidelity on my conscience.
I'd thought I would die out there in the wet and cold, and I knew that my own idiocy was to blame. I'd been stubborn, pushing on longer than any reasonable person would have. I couldn't believe I was dying without ever having told John how much I loved him – or at the very least telling him how much I had valued our association. I'm not given to declarations of sentiment, but I regretted not making at least one as I slowly lost feeling in my feet.
The Omega hesitated barely an instant before he fluidly stepped into John’s hands. John shoved upwards with all his strength and the Omega got an arm over the concrete cap of the wall. He scrabbled upwards, avoiding grasping hands by millimeters.
John disappeared but quickly returned with clothes for Sherlock. "Here." John said, holding out a t-shirt.
"My love." John murmured, holding Sherlock's sweaty, sticky body against his own and slowly letting down his legs.
Sherlock was ill – I felt guilty, I should be with him. He had looked seriously peaky and I feared it would get worse before it got better.
“Yes, of course you’re right.” Sherlock said. “Come here.” He leaned into my embrace and pulled me close. He kissed me, opening my mouth with his tongue. His sudden passion surprised me, but delighted me as well. “I need you right now.” He told me.
"Mmmm." Sherlock had forgotten how much he liked the thing with the peas. John's appetite was much improved as well, Sherlock was happy to see. For a few moments they savoured the meal in companionable silence.
As he stood, Moran took firm hold of Sherlock’s upper arm and started marching him towards the hall. “Let’s go see who’s come calling.” He said. “There will be plenty of time to play afterwards.”
The shadows of the drugs and, more alarming still, death was heavy upon him. I could see them swirling around, distracting him, preying on his mind...
“Why?” I asked. I set down my fork. “You’re hardly closeted.... or ARE you? Is it so important that people think you’re asexual?” I was confused and surprised.
I forced myself to meet his gaze. “No?” I asked. I wondered if I could forgive him. I had been so lonely without him...
“Food! – this is ridiculous.” He muttered, heaving himself to his feet. “Stop playing silly buggers and…” He trailed off as he entered the bedroom. His mate lay stretched across the bed, his long, lithe body wrapped in a sheet. “Jeeesusss.”
It was growing dark and I was on the verge of contacting Mycroft to demand that he locate John via CCTV when I heard the front door. It was John’s tread on the stair – even as I sighed with relief and lay my violin in its case, I girded myself for the final blow. I would have my dignity, I resolved, if nothing else.
I didn’t even know I was capable of loving so deeply, capable of caring so much, of feeling so happy – until you showed me, John.
It was dark, but there was still a fire burning. John was dozing in the overstuffed chair by the hearth, the remains of a dinner tray on a small table next to him. He was wearing clothes, but he'd pressed his bare skin against mine.
They met for a late lunch near John's flat, then went to 221b together. Shane had been there before, many times of course, but John saw him looking at the flat differently now.
In seconds a lorry squealed around the corner and sped down Baker Street, coming to an abrupt shrieking halt in front of them. Several men jumped out of the truck and grabbed Sherlock. They hustled him into the back of the lorry. As they were duct taping his hands together, Shane was ushered in as well.
"Just let me alone." John snapped, pulling away from Shane's touch. "In fact, get out. Both of you, I'm tired. I want to sleep."
Alone in the flat, Sherlock approached the corpse, keeping his face turned away. I stood back, taking in the room. The window wall must be stunning in the daytime. I went to it and pressed myself against the glass, trying to see the view. I looked out over the city – I could make out the Tate Modern with the Thames beyond, several other high rises amongst the lower, older buildings dense on the ground.
“Suki.” She said. “Thought you’d never get to me.” Her eyes flashed with challenge and John grinned at her, happy that at least one Omega retained her spirit. She grinned back and hopped off the exam bench.
And that was it. Lestrade had shoved his dresser into the closet. If Mycroft opened the door, he’d find a jumble of shoes and laundry on the floor below the hanging suits and shirts in dry-cleaner's bags, Lestrade’s secret clutter.
Suddenly he pulled out entirely. I moaned and tried to follow, but his hands in my hair held me back.
It didn’t hurt that the former delivery boy, the man who’d attacked me, had ended up in the spartan infirmary whilst I appeared unscathed. After I broke his knee with a vicious kick, the fight was over. Unfortunately for him, I had a reputation for sadism to live up to. (Fortunately for both of us, I didn’t have a skinning knife.) Before the smuggler had someone pull me off him, I dislocated his broken knee to get him screaming, broke a few of his ribs with savage kicks and scuffed his head with the heel of my boot, opening a cut that bled all over the place. It did not appear that I was being careful to avoid damaging his head or internal organs.
Moran's head dropped in momentary frustration, but he pushed himself away from the table and turned towards John.
Sherlock told himself not to want more, to cherish the memory of having been loved, but to accept that that part of his life, so briefly ignited, was finished. But returning to celibacy was more difficult than he could have anticipated. His body yearned to be touched.
"I'm sorry, John. It's hard not to be a fan." Shane shook his head apologetically. "I'm sorry, I'm reminding you of him too, now. Let's just be us." He put his arms around John and kissed his head. "Cinema? Or a blow job?"
I don’t recall ever arguing with Victor, and I had no reason to have a disagreement with a trick, or any reason to bother if I did. I was not used to CARING about the person I argued with – I’d never been invested in the other person’s point of view.
Sherlock moaned and stood up, making his way quickly to the loo – apparently too distracted to focus on his Alpha’s brief despondency. John had been vaguely aware of a feeling of pressure through the link, but he hadn’t associated it with a need to slash. He laughed and felt Sherlock return his amusement.
This morning he'd woken next to John – his entire body deliciously sore from the intense and unaccustomed exertions of the day before – with the knowledge that it wasn't the last (only) time. He'd watched John sleep, studied how the careworn lines on his face relaxed. He didn't look younger really, he looked like a man without worries, a man who had set down his burdens. But it was still a strong face filled with character.
"Mm hmm. You are distracted by your feelings for John because you DO want a physical relationship with him."
"Would John have been in ANY danger at all if he didn't know you? Can you really take credit for saving someone YOU put in danger?"
“Nothing. Selwyn talks about taking an advanced degree… but I don’t see him going back to Uni. G rides horses with Bess and shoots, drives fast cars and plays racquetball.”
“Yep.” Lestrade grinned. Surreptitiously he brushed his knuckles against Mycroft’s hand, letting their fingers tangle. He heard Mycroft’s breath hitch.
“Yeah, erm, he’s still here. Do you want a cuppa?” John turned back to the teapot as Shane released him.
Sherlock looked like he was about to argue, but after one look at my face he acquiesced and retreated.
“Oh.” Suddenly I felt weighed down, defeated. I’d thought being with someone else who missed him would lighten the load, but it was having the opposite effect. I went home soon after.
“Your chin is beautiful.” I said, kissing the small cleft that resided there. “And your jaw...” I nibbled his stubbled flesh. “I love this cowlick.” I bussed my lips over the crown of his head where his hair spiraled outward. “And this cowlick...” I touched my lips at his hairline and John made a small sound of complaint under his breath – I knew he fought that cowlick daily, that he hated it. But I loved it, I loved how it disrupted his fringe, made it impossible for him to brush his hair to the left. “This cowlick is perfect.” I told him.
“Why bother?” I said miserably. “You’ve made your decision. Nothing I say now will prevent this idiocy.”
John pulled his phone from his pocket and looked at it. "Sorry, I SHOULD get this." He smiled apologetically. "Don't go anywhere." He slid away and stood up.
I looked at him dubiously. The last thing I wanted was to get closer to the rotting, crawling horror on the couch. But when Sherlock raised his eyebrows in an irritated question, I sighed and approached suddenly grateful to be swathed in protective paper and latex.
“What are you doing!?” The Alpha cried frantically, holding up his hands in a warding-off gesture. “You understand, you aren’t safe with me.” His eyes, Sherlock noted, were a dark, stormy blue and though short, his compact form was strong and well-made.
“I have plans for you.” John’s hand wandered down to my prick, hard and straining against the fabric of my kimono. “As soon as I recover...”
"I haven't seen him." John said, adjusting the bed so he could sit up. "It's ridiculous that I'm laying in bed all bloody day." He muttered. It WAS ridiculous. Yeah, he needed more rest to promote healing, but this was just dumb.
“You aren’t!” Mary cried, her voice soft but firm. I had to agree with her, John was far from average – average was his camouflage. “You’re courageous and kind and capable! You’re handsome and… and so strong! People don’t look at you because HE’s so ridiculous.” She gestured towards me with her gun. “They’re stupid. You’re so much better than he is.”
“A big, tall Alpha, brown coat, short blond hair, pink face, smoking a cigarette, with his trousers tucked into rubber boots. Anything else you remember, Auntie?”
“It has to be him.” I told Lestrade, sotto voce. “It has to be. There are too many coincidences – a well-dressed, blonde gambler with sniper training? How many men in London fit that description? How many in the world?”
"Sherlock." John called. He shouldn't be asleep if he was concussed. And he was lying on his back, the wound on his head pressed into the pillow. "Sherlock!" John shook him and got no response. He slapped Sherlock's cheeks and pinched his arm. Nothing.
I wore it still. It was sodden and heavy on my hand, and I was reminded that it ached. I would forget again in the agony of withdrawal.
I came back to myself slowly. We were lying in an untidy heap on my bed, sticky and damp. I pulled out carefully – Sherlock hissed quietly – and rolled off his chest. I took off the condom and tied it off. I forced myself out of bed and threw the thing away, then looked around for a suitable cum rag.
Not that he would characterize Shane as 'quiet.' Certainly not during sex anyway. John smirked to himself thinking about last night. He had introduced Molly Hooper to one of Shane's single friends at a dinner party and they seemed to hit it off. She liked Shane too – but then who wouldn't? He was interesting, articulate, witty, well-read, fluent in three languages AND laid-back, comfortable, an all-around regular bloke.
"No, it would only endanger you. As it is, you should be cautious – don't speak of this to anyone. We don't want to tip off our murderer."
"He traded himself...” John was almost sobbing. “…for our freedom. He made some kind of deal with Moran... he doesn't know! He doesn't know what he's in for...!"
He shoved that thought away hard — it was inappropriate at the best of times and it was downright criminal now.
…he caught Mycroft awkwardly, hugging him to his chest, feeling the man’s weight cascading down, piling onto him, heavy...
“We should talk to an agent tomorrow about finding our own flat. Mine’s not livable anymore – and I know you don’t want to go back there anyway. But we can’t stay here.” John laughed. “Mummy’s rubbing off on me, I’m making wild assumptions –
Afterwards I kissed him tenderly. He’d cum on the floor and the towel he’d grabbed to cushion his knees, stroking himself as he sucked me, cumming as I came in his throat. His shivers of pleasure had only heightened my own – I’d been with women who enjoyed sucking cock, but none who’d enjoyed it to the point of orgasm. It was quite the ego boost, to be sure.
John dug his heels into the bed and fucked upwards into his mate’s tight arse, jackhammering. He gripped Sherlock’s hips, they moved together like a piston, his Omega crying out with each thrust. Sherlock’s fingers dug into his chest, his face shone damp and lovely, his eyes flashing mercury.
(Had he trimmed in anticipation of this? Coupling with ME? The rest of his body was natural – John wasn't much for manscaping... or had he done it for HER? I put her out of my mind. There would be time for that later.)
The nurse hadn't answered the question. Sherlock looked him over – mid-thirties, gay, burly and hirsute, a thick layer of fat padding his strong, mesomorph frame. He wore purple scrubs, same as all the nurses, but his strained across his broad shoulders... and they were soiled by more than one wearing. On the inside of his forearm, he had a tattoo of an owl on a shield. His thumb worried at the base of his ring finger, rubbing the bit of pale skin there endlessly. He was clean, but his hair was shaggy around his bald pate and his face stubbled with several days growth. His eyes were bloodshot. His I.D. hung around his neck – reading upside down, Sherlock could just make out his name: Angus Church.
Then the Omega’s weight was lifting off his shoulders. John looked up and saw that he’d gotten hold of the ladder and was pulling himself upwards. It was a strain, the young man’s terror and efforts thus far had weakened him, but through what seemed to be sheer will alone, he got a leg up onto the platform and squirmed onto it. He lay there momentarily, on his belly, panting.
“Indeed. We are formulating plans to mount a rescue of uninfected Londoners whilst containing the infected — without shooting them willy-nilly like those trigger-happy marines.” Mycroft said testily.
“Fizzy water.” He said and I grabbed the bottle of sparkling from the fridge. We sat together on the couch, legs touching from knee to ankle, and started opening takeaway containers.
But tonight was different. Tonight Shane was taking control. And John was more than content to lay back and watch Shane's thighs flex and his prick bounce as they made love. It was slower and sweeter than usual and it was exactly what John needed. When he came, jacking Shane's cock to bring him off simultaneously, he felt some tears fall – he loved Shane so much! He was so lucky to have such a caring man.
Shane leaned back and met John's eye. "Why not? John... you slept with him before. I thought it would bother me, but it really didn't. It just made me want you more... maybe that means I'm... strange... or a bad person..."
Sherlock smiled briefly. "You unconsciously touch the place where your ring used to be – recent breakup. You show obvious signs of depression – you've stopped taking care of yourself, you look tired as if you aren't sleeping well. So, he left you. Sheffield, well it's obvious. Who else would be a big enough fan of the Wednesday to have their crest tattooed on their arm?"
“I wanted to be a detective.” Lestrade agreed, thinking that his definition of ‘ambitious’ might not line up with Mycroft’s. “Seriously, you didn’t know that I fancied you?”
It wasn't until someone knocked on the stall door that John realized he was slumped against it, unmoving.
"Come back here." John said gently, holding out his hand. He scooted up the bed to lie on it length wise. I stretched out next to him.
But my limitations have not stopped me from dreaming of you, dreaming of being with you. Something as simple as walking down the street next to you fills me with such joy. To be with you carnally – I've barely even dared to dream. The power of those feelings is shocking. I understand now why people kill for love – I would not hesitate to kill if you were threatened.
At the second overlook, Ianto turned to Victor and me and shouted. “We’ve come three K.”  I nodded and we continued on wondering how in hell we were going to get Sherlock all the way back
"This will feel strange." John warned, and Sherlock felt something moving, crawling up his airway, scraping against his interior walls. It hurt! He tried not to scream – but it only came out as a moan anyway. "Almost there." John said. Sherlock gagged on the thing, choked and retched and then it was gone from his body, but Sherlock couldn't stop heaving. He tasted vomit and thought sadly that it was the thing with the peas. It seemed wrong his body should reject the thing with the peas.
Lady Anwen smiled – pleased that Sherlock wanted to get right down to business. “Come into the study, then.” She said and led us to one of the doors farther down the hall.
Sherlock’s hands caressed John’s chest. “I was tested in rehab – I’m clean. I’ve never shared needles. I’ve never been with anyone else. I want YOU.”
“A lot of them, yeah. But there have to be people out there, uninfected, hiding out. We have to do something for them.”
“Wait here, yeah?” John said. He went to the next gurney and freed the girl there and then the next. Though weak and frightened, all the young Omegas worked hard to release their fellows, and the work went quickly.
"No! It's just... Sherlock doesn't... Sherlock didn't... " What was I going to say? Sherlock doesn't have sex? Obviously he does – or did, at least. "...mention you."
I pulled him to me, relief and shame that I had doubted him, even a little, washing through me. He lay down with me, kissing my neck, my jaw, his deft hands running over my torso and my arms. He began unbuttoning my shirt, pushing it aside to caress my skin, his fingers hot. I felt my hunger for him returning, my blood running high, hardening my prick. I kissed him, my hands finding their way under his t-shirt, stroking his muscular chest. I found a nipple and circled it with my thumb, delighting in how hard it became, how John moaned into my mouth.
"I'm a grownup, Shane. I don't need you – either of you – to babysit me. Spending the night in hospital doesn't give ME ridiculous panic attacks."
“I will. Thank you for your help, Auntie.” Sherlock handed her the money and it disappeared into her rags.
He didn't want to take his coat off – that would surely call attention to his prosthesis. John forced himself as Shane slipped out of his shabby trench. He kept his left arm down as their coats were taken and they were led through the restaurant.
“For YOU, Sherlock. You were also washed and dressed, and a number of tests were performed that were unpleasantly... invasive.”
"Me too." John said into Shane's hair. Shane kissed his neck and chest, then reached over for the lubricant. "Let me." John said, holding out his hand.
“Christ.” Someone, not the doctor, muttered. She shushed him. I felt her hands gently touch my back and I remembered the caning.
back. Brazenly. He caught Mycroft’s eye and held it, smiling lazily and letting his hand travel over his abdomen leading Mycroft’s attention downwards...
“Would repeating myself make it any more clear?” Sherlock didn’t even try to reign in his impatience.
Mycroft huffed unhappily. “No, better you call me than die in some Eastern European drugs den. Mummy would be distraught.” Mycroft regarded Sherlock for a moment. “If you aren’t ‘ready’ for London, where are you going to go?”
Hamish Watson had been – and probably still was, the twat – a classic Alpha, an Alphas Alpha. He was charming and charismatic, everybody liked him, so it had been hard to see.
The iPad contained the ‘menu’ – the Omegas on offer that evening. They crowded around it and Sherlock flipped through the pages. There were seventeen Omegas listed, fourteen currently in heat. All the Omegas in heat had a queue indicated on the iPad – four Alphas in line for this one, one Alpha in line for the next, two Alphas in line for that one. The three not in heat didn’t have a lineup of Alphas waiting, but two were currently engaged.
He needed another hit. Sherlock needed to score, but he was out of cash, out of things to trade or pawn. His hands were shaking with his need... if he could still them for a few seconds... in the market, the stink of meat in the air, of sweat and garlic, incense and patchouli, he could pass through the crowd, hands steady, bump-hand-in-bulging-pocket-take-wallet-feather-light-apologize-in-plumby-posh-tones-slip-away-disappear...
“I don’t think he is! All this –“ Sherlock gestured widely. “The ridiculously public crimes, the trial, it’s theater. Don’t you see, John? He’s called me out: ‘Get Sherlock.’ That’s what he intends to do, ‘get’ me. I don’t know how, but I feel certain Moriarty doesn’t plan on going to prison.”
“What did someone so amazing see in YOU?!” Their eyes accused. I couldn’t blame them, I’d asked the same question myself.
“But you didn’t.” Mary said bitterly. “So, we knew Sherlock was alive. Sooner or later he would come back. Or you would lead us to him. All we had to do was wait.”
For the first time, Sherlock considered what seducing Sebastian Moran would mean. Sherlock had had sex once with the only person he'd ever desired. To go from that to being strapped down spread eagled on a table or cross – or to the bench attached to the fucking machine! – and allow this stranger to do whatever he wanted to him... for a second Sherlock quailed.
“Let’s don’t start something I can’t finish.” I said, doing nothing to stop him. “I have work today. So do you, if I’m not mistaken.”
“Hey!” The scent of the Omega was suddenly stronger. John looked up. The young man was still on top of the wall. Why hadn’t he gone over? Escaped? He reached down with a long, skinny arm, locking eyes with John. “Hey!” he shouted again.
"Shane... you're amazing." John roused himself from the recliner, stretched feeling the myriad aches and kinks from sleeping on the hospital chair, and poured a cup of coffee from the thermos.
But Sherlock had been held hostage. He had been kidnapped, taken forcibly. He had been beaten and tortured. He had been raped – gang raped almost certainly. Possibly more than once. He had been injected with heroin against his will, addicted to a drug he had tried so hard to put behind him.
John scoffed. "You're looking forward to sleeping in your own bed instead of crowding into this thing. Besides, hospital gives you the heebie-jeebies."
“Tomorrow morning I need to go to St. Barts to examine a bit of mud I found today.” Sherlock told me scraping the last bit of mussaman curry from the carton. “I’m hopeful its chemical makeup will yield clues to where our sniper spends his time. I’ve done extensive studies of the dirt in different London neighborhoods, it’s been helpful in a number of cases.”
With a latex glove, I opened one of the windows. It pushed out approximately 25 centimeters. This explained the angle of the shot – to avoid breaking a window in this building and attracting attention, he had worked out which flat he could shoot Jones from the small opening.
For all that, John was still beautiful. When Sherlock went through into the psychiatrist's office for their appointment, he found John standing in the sunlight. His hair shone orange and silver, and his whole form was backlit with a bright halo. He stepped forward to greet Sherlock, something akin to welcome on his expressive face, and Sherlock couldn't help but smile with the simple joy of being with John.
WTF Mary Morstan!? Are you an innocent pawn in all this or are you a bad actor? Does Moran KNOW that John KNOWS? Or does he want to get closer to John simply to find out what, if anything, he knows?
“It is, yeah.” The flat gaze he fixed on me made me want to squirm. I forced myself to stand still. “Greg.” I called Lestrade over to show him the missing weapon.
"It does! I care about John, his suffering affects me. I want to protect him from insufferable cocks who hurt him."
Moran understood perfectly now, he understood that Sherlock was playing him, offering himself – his time and attention – in exchange for John’s safety. But he still wanted it. When Sherlock had said his name, the man’s eyes had dilated. Maybe Jim Moriarty had called him ‘Seb.’ Maybe Sebastian Moran had only wished that Jim would call him that.
They arrived at street level and Shane half-carried John out and onto the pavement. "I'll flag a cab and you can use his phone while we go to hospital. What did he do, John? Why can't you walk?"
I considered. "I never injected heroin before. I smoked it ... a lot... and snorted. And I had a significant cocaine habit. Mainlining heroin... it's so much more intense... it's difficult not to want it."
This time when he smiled, there was real humour sparkling in his eyes. "No." He said. "I don't need it."
Lestrade looked dubiously at the photo on my phone. "Even if we find the dry cleaners, we'd have to narrow down the customers somehow."
I caressed him, my hands on his chest and neck then up into his hair. I missed his unruly curls, missed the way it felt to comb my fingers through them, to grab a fistful.
John strode in the door, shedding his coat and tossing it on the couch. He walked directly to me and grabbed me by the arms. He pulled me into a kiss – it was demanding.
While on my knees, I discovered a bit of dried mud in the carpet. It smelled earthy... and possibly a bit chemical. I put part of it in my own evidence bag then called a CSI over to bag and tag the rest and flag where it had lay. I wanted to discover the properties of this mud. Perhaps it would give us a location.
He heard Lestrade breathing, groping around. “Erm... ouch! Bloody hell! ... er... Bill started a fight... I was trying to stay out of it... don’t like Alphas touching me... oohh...” He swallowed audibly. “Police came in the front... broke down the door... there was an alarm... bloody deafening alarm...” Lestrade panted. “Is there water?” He asked.
Suddenly John’s movements became more staccato. He cried out and pushed hard into Sherlock’s throat. He pulled back and shot cum across Sherlock’s tongue and Sherlock understood. He tried to swallow it, but John thrust into his throat again. Sherlock stroked himself harder and felt the inevitability of his own climax. At John’s next thrust into his throat, Sherlock moaned and came, cumming into his hand… is orgasm seemed to go on and on, he shuddered and sucked on John’s cock, tonguing the last drops from the head, savouring the bitter taste in his mouth as his limbs became weak and rubbery. His legs refused to support him and he felt himself sliding sideways. John slipped out of his mouth, out of his grasp...
"No, don't apologize. With what you've been through... what I'm trying to say... very awkwardly...." Shane chuckled self-deprecatingly, then stopped and took a deep breath. "John, you don't have to choose between Sherlock and me. You can be with him, I don't mind. I know you love him."
He paused his bobbing to suckle just the head, licking up the bitter pre-cum, then sucked it down again. Sherlock pulled on John’s hair, saying something unintelligible. The Alpha ignored it in favour of increasing the speed and pressure of his mouth on his Omega’s prick.
A tear trickled from the corner of one blue eye and disappeared into his ear. I leaned over, pushing his hips upward so I could reach, and kissed him. His mouth was hot, a sheen of sweat on his upper lip – he moaned into our kiss and I fucked him harder, pistoning in and out with devastating force. He gripped my shoulders, his prick hard between us.
“You’re an idiot.” John said. But he said it fondly. “You really need me to explain it to you? You’re amazing, Sherlock! How could I not love you?” John kissed my temple. “You said I was shattered, you saved my life – I wouldn’t have lasted much longer the way I was before we met. You saved my life and you became my best friend...and all of a sudden I had the best life.
"No. I only had a few minutes before your friend Nurse Church came in – I don't think he's been negligent by the way, I took a look at the duty roster and he came on shift at 9 a.m. – I'm going to the morgue later for a closer look."
Lestrade carefully cleaned the brown leather gloves, thinking he might need them again before this was all over. He discovered teeth marks up near his wrist.
"I'm here." John told the still figure when they were alone, taking his hand. "It's John, I'm here with you, Sherlock. I'll be with you the whole time. You're safe now. No one will hurt you while I'm here.
"Oh." I sat there trying to wrap my mind around it – Sherlock... MY Sherlock... asexual Sherlock ... had had sex with this man. More than once.
“Good, Johnny boy!” The Alpha gloated. “Good!” He climbed slowly to his feet. “He’s a feisty one, Sherlock. I see why you like him.”
"Oh, he's ok. He's pants at riding and shooting, but the dogs like him. What about you, d'you shoot?"
“Oi!” John called. “I came in with Lestrade – get these to safety, yeah?” He waved the young people to go with the cops and stood back. Molly huddled into his side, clinging to his arm as John counted the Omegas rushing past. They went in twos and threes, holding hands, arms around each other, shrinking from even the Betas’ touch. “42... 43... 44... Suki, anyone else? No – just the Omegas in heat. They’re on the second, third and fourth floors. Might be Alphas with them.”
Sherlock ate most of his curry and a bit of John’s, then he set down his plate and picked the laptop back up. He’d been without a phone or computer for a week and suddenly he couldn’t imagine how he’d managed. He heard John chuckling softly, felt his amusement. He received a detailed image of himself on his hands and knees with his face pressed into the mattress and his arse up, begging to be fucked. He elbowed his mate in the stomach.
"Just great." I muttered. I had to wait for the lift to come back up before I could escape the stench of rotting flesh. I was feeling put out when I emerged into the lobby, wiping the Vick's from under my nose with my handkerchief. Sherlock wasn't in the lobby.
“Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. How could he NOT have it after everything...” Mycroft had told me a bit of what the inmates we’d taken to Uzbekistan had said about Sherlock’s imprisonment. “It was nightmarish, what happened to him. He’s not just suffering physically.”
This grim reverie was interrupted by Sherlock. "Fuck me! Uhh, John! Fuck me harder! I need your cock! I need you inside me! Fuck! John! John!" He was louder, more insistent this time – John, in the small part of his brain that cared, worried he'd bring Mrs. Hudson up the stairs.
Mycroft raised his eyebrows in surprise. “You’ve always cared about his feelings before...” He studied me carefully. “You still do... but you’re ashamed. Sherlock, John knows they forced the drugs on you. He knows you didn’t want them.”
An agonising jolt. Sherlock cried out, the sound echoing. It was dark. Vibration… movement... he was moving... hard, cold metal under his hip and arm, his leg... he lay on his side in the back of a lorry.
"Gereth, what are you doing?" I glanced back and saw Victor standing in the center of the hallway, intercepting his hotheaded lover.
When I heard him on the stairs, I sprang out of my chair full of nervous energy. I was already half-hard.
Sherlock curled further into John’s sturdy arms, allowing himself to relax and revel in their bond. It was so tempting to believe it, believe it could be that simple – John would kill anyone who threatened them.
“More.” John supplied. He pulled back and shoved himself into the Omega, earning a lewd cry. “You need more of this.” He began thrusting in earnest, harder than he ever would have with one of his Beta girlfriends. He didn’t know if it was because Sherlock was a man or because he was an Omega, or both, but John could – needed to – fuck him roughly, urgently, almost violently. He pressed on the small of the Omega’s back, changing the angle of penetration and suddenly Sherlock was gasping and shaking below him. He’d found it, John realised, the Omega’s pearl – that sensitive spot deep within that gave him intense pleasure. John growled happily and continued striking Sherlock’s pearl with his long cock.
But he WAS sick. And I couldn't stop thinking about Victor. Victor with his broad chest and big biceps, with thighs bigger round than both of mine together... how could Sherlock look at me when he could have someone like Victor? When he'd HAD Victor.
Moran approached hesitantly, but was emboldened by their eye contact. He stood between Sherlock's legs and after another long moment looking into each other's eyes, Moran placed his hand on the table between Sherlock's legs and leaned in.
I sat between Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson at the funeral. I’d worn my best suit, such as it was, but I should have worn a jumper. Sherlock had said that my jumpers were one of the things he’d loved about me, the silly fool. I barely heard the service.
"I'm a doctor." John snapped and resumed the compressions, shaking off the fatigue in his shoulders. "He needs to be intubated – he needs a respirator!"
I didn't dare pull away, I didn't want him falling back and hurting himself. As it was he was slipping and sloshing the water over the edge. I was drenched.
With frightening speed, he leapt forward and reached under the couch. “Ah!” He was triumphant as he pulled Dusette out by her ankle.
John felt ALIVE. For the first time in a year, the heaviness on his spirit was simply GONE. Everything appeared brighter and more real.
I felt confused for a moment – John had... I remembered the smell of his hair, the scratch of it on my face... his lips pressing into my neck...
He smiled at me – not for the first time, I felt bewildered that this amazing person loved ME. John could so easily find someone better than the skinny, irritating, arrogant detective who had left him alone for the last year.
Sherlock found himself outside. The evening air was crisp, it felt good against his face. He walked aimlessly for a while – he would have to go back to hospital, although Sherlock didn't know if would be more selfish to go back to be with John or to stay away. He couldn't think clearly about this.
"Don't give me that! You have casual sex as often as you can get it! How many times have you brought a girl home for the night?! Well, I can get it anytime I want it! In the Underground, on the street, through the internet, and, yes, at a crime scene! Men don't need convincing."
I missed his touch immediately. I climbed to the third floor, to John's bedroom before we shared the larger one downstairs. I crouched down before opening the door, to be certain the blinds were closed. They were. I knelt there a moment, letting my eyes adjust to the darkness. The room was crowded with... my things. I examined them, squinting in the darkness. There were stacks of books that had been on the shelves by my desk, my chemistry equipment - some in open boxes, some not, my music stand, the case for my microscope with, presumably, my microscope in it, and several large cartons piled atop each other shoved behind the rest of the mess. I examined them, one was labeled 'shoes/socks,' another 'clothes,' yet another 'music.' Perched on top was the Cluedo game with my knife stuck into it and my skull.
Gereth was tall and thin as a reed with that particular beauty that some men have before they reach physical maturity. He resembled his sister both in handsomeness and inherent elegance, but it was offset by his teenaged gangling awkwardness. John had reported that the boy was ridiculously, almost cartoonishly, prejudiced... the misdirection of the closeted queer, perhaps? The kid pinged my gaydar.
I had NEVER deserved him. That was clearer to me than ever. All I’d done was endanger him and cause him pain!
“You’re too skinny.” He said. “I don’t like it. If you aren’t pretty anymore, why would I waste good drugs on you?”
“It’s a competitive school.” Molly said, girding herself for eventual disappointment. “You must be very good to have been accepted here, Mr. Watson.”
Sherlock’s elegant hands ranged over my chest, running his fingers through the ginger fur – I knew he liked it, he had his hands in it whenever he could. He traced my abdomen with one finger.
A finger of depression touched my heart – a taste of the emptiness that had consumed me after I was invalided home. Once again I was wounded, alone, staring at a Tube map...
He tightened his fist around my cock as he stroked. "Oh yeah. Let me suck you, Sherlock. I need to taste you."
Eventually, though, John roused himself and went upstairs to sleep in his own bed. I kipped on the couch again, forlorn and abandoned. I didn't know what to make of him – attentive one moment, texting with Mariah the next, and disappearing from the flat for six or eight hours, returning drawn and footsore.
John had witnessed the exchange – his eyes were as big as saucers. He looked away and began to clumsily and painstakingly dress, drying himself with his t-shirt, covering his battered nudity as hastily as he could, keeping his grimaces and groans of pain to the bare minimum possible. Sherlock longed to help him, but he kept his eyes and his attention on Moran. He took the cup of tea he was offered.
"Everybody out." Lestrade called, raising his voice above the buzz of conversation and insects. "Come on." He turned to Sherlock. "You have five minutes."
I kicked off my shoes and took off the belted trench and my suit jacket, draping them over my music stand. I stretched out on John's bed - it was made, but was a bit dusty, forgotten like everything else up here. Apropos that I should be here too, I thought mournfully, wondering what was taking him so long. "I accept the things I can't change…"
“Clearly. I’ve assured Mrs. Hudson that I can keep her husband locked up in Florida in exchange for a good deal on the second floor flat in her building.”
He easily found the register where corpses were signed in, and found Simon Fraser. His body was stored in one of the big coolers. When attendants brought another body in, Sherlock used the distraction to locate and enter the cooler.
And then I did, my back locking up and my knees giving out, pleasure like electric shocks jolting my body. I let out a long gasping wail and shot great ropes under the table.
That desire frightened me so much that I have stayed away for too long. I now realize that by running away from you, I have almost certainly lost any chance I might have had. But if you are safe and happy in your life, I can learn to bear my regrets and disappointments. They are of my own making, after all. But please know that I am sincerely sorry for the pain that I have caused you. I know I am an idiot for not seeing how my actions would hurt you. I’ve been selfish and stupid.
The address John had texted took them to a café in Shoreditch. John and his friend met them on the pavement in front. Sherlock felt his mate’s confusion blossom as soon as they were close enough for John to scent him.
Sherlock climbed up to the third floor. The bedroom was dark, but there was a light on elsewhere in the flat that shone through the doorway. Sherlock waited. He attempted to let his mind focus on the real problem – the hunter, Moran – rather than the cold metal under his hands and the strain on his muscles to stay still on the ladder for so long. But it was difficult. Moran was a sniper, how long could he stand on this bloody ladder? Indefinitely, Sherlock guessed. Although he'd want a more comfortable hide for a long-term position. And he would have brought gloves.
Suddenly I was exhausted. I sat down in Mrs. Hudson's kitchen chairs and listened - the stillness around me betrayed the flat's emptiness... the whole building's emptiness. I was disappointed, I'd hoped to see John... hold him... feel his arms around me...
“No, it doesn’t spell it out – it should, but it doesn’t. But all indications point to her having had a baby.”
"Shane I can almost understand – he's just as homely and boring as John, isn't he. But you! You cut such a dashing figure! You could have anyone, you could have your pick!"
He curled up on one end of the couch and opened it. There were two pages of a legal pad covered in longhand. John took a sip of his tea, set down the mug and began to read.
Poor Alfred, he’d been upset by the concept of rejecting someone chosen for him, of choosing for himself. Sherlock almost lost patience with him, but John’s steady kindness flowed through their link and he’d kept his temper in check. Instead he challenged Alfred – challenged all of them – to practice saying ‘no’ to Mummy.
But members of the gang had returned whilst we were searching and we’d been obliged to huddle together at the back of a closet, bodies pressed against one another, John’s breath soft on my neck... after a quarter hour, we’d been discovered and had had to fight our way out. John was magnificent! I’m handy with my fists, and I have a number of street-fighting skills that serve me well, but John’s hand-to-hand combat is second to none. He unerringly uses his attackers' weight and momentum against them, even after they realise this short, regular-looking bloke isn’t an easy mark.
John had been covering Victor, just in case. He made a concerned noise and both he and Victor moved to help me up.
“That’s right.” The big man taunted. “You bonded with that doctor.” He gripped Sherlock’s shoulder, digging his fingers in. Sherlock gasped and staggered at the pain. “He got shot.” The Alpha said.
Mycroft actually reached out to me, his hand hovering hear my arm as I shrank from it. “Oh please! We aren’t going to start HUGGING now, are we?!”
“Yeah. As soon as I can find a place. I’m going to sleep on Stamford’s couch for a few days in the interim.”
“Yes.” And Sherlock told him a short version of how Shane and Dusette had killed Moran while Sherlock was shackled in the center of the room.
Victor had watched our interaction with interest, taking in every detail. He watched John leave the room.
I touched his face and he looked up at me with uncomprehending eyes. “John?” His lips formed the word. His skin was grey and cold – he wasn't even shivering. This was bad.
Was he going to do to Shane what Angus' boyfriend had done to him? It wasn't exactly analogous – Angus had been with Taz for many years, John had been seeing Shane for a year. They hadn't made any commitments stronger than an agreement that they were boyfriends. That they were exclusive.
God! It felt wonderful to be back in London! Sherlock was glad John had gone for a walk, he was enjoying HIS city again. In his depression, he hadn't realized how much he'd missed London.
“What’s this about then.” John asked coolly. Having an enemy to focus on was calming. John focused on Moran like a laser.
I nodded and handed the gun back to him. His hand brushed mine as he took it. I looked into his eyes, held his gaze for a long, electric moment.
Should he pretend it was John? Sherlock didn’t want to. He didn’t want to desecrate his feelings for John this way. But John would want him to do it if it made this any less horrible. Would it? Would it help to think of the grabby hands bruising his flesh as John’s? Sherlock’s entire being revolted at the idea.
I swallowed my laughter. (I was wearing a gray hoodie after all, given me by the agent in the loo. He’d urged me to cover my hair.) “What’s next then? Where are we going?”
I floated away into John’s arms. I loved the way he kissed me – hungry and fierce, as if he wanted to consume me. I loved the feeling of his hands on my body, strong and so very capable. The pleasure he could wring from me with one hand alone! I loved the way he spoke to me, amazed at my deductions, challenging me to be better, full of desire... and the way he looked at me... with utter confidence. John believed in me, believed I could do anything...
That's where I met Victor. I'd brought my analytical chemistry book along that day – as an excuse if anyone wanted to know what I was doing out there. Studying. Just studying. There was a log in a little clearing with used condoms to one side. There was no doubt I was in the right place.
That's when John realized how unfair he was being to Shane, how selfish. Having him was a comfort and a distraction. But he pined for Sherlock. He was ashamed of himself for using Shane like this and that made him angrier with Sherlock. All of this was Sherlock's fault. How could he leave John thinking him dead and buried for TWO YEARS!?
Moran pulled a pocket knife out and unfolded a wicked looking blade. He knelt in front of the sling, wrinkling his nose in disgust at the stench. "Jesus, he pissed himself."
“I thought they were getting equal shares, about fifty million apiece. As you can see...” Anwen pointed at a line in the will. “Geraint is left sixty million,  Selwyn eighty million and Gereth fifty – and the terms of Gereth's trust was changed.”
Wee Ruggers was for six to eight-year-olds – it was not a competitive league. It was mostly young Alphas (and a few Betas) blowing off steam, learning the form and feel of rugby. Scrums were more goose piles than anything else – the sort of thing for which Yakety-Sax was composed. Sometimes the ball hardly moved. John's first game ended nil-nil.
"I went for a scan." He admitted. "Hip fracture – all the sprinting and tackling made it worse, I guess. No running, no cycling, no long walks. I have to use the cane for the next three weeks at least."
“I ‘eard you were bonded.” Bill said in an undertone to John. “You’re the last Alpha I thought would take a dinner plate.*”
"No - John has everything password protected. He said something about living with you got him in the habit."
“This is it.” John announced. He mounted the stairs of a gimcrack Victorian monstrosity and knocked on the door. “I too love the sandwich.” He said to the tough looking Alpha female who opened the door.
He saw John dashing across a wide street into a park where a man with dark, floppy hair had a hand raised in greeting. John ran up to the man and they kissed. It wasn't a passionate kiss, but it wasn't just a cheek kiss you might give your friend from the continent either - it was the kiss people who are intimate give to say hello – full on the mouth, but brief. Then John and this person smiled at each other and walked into the park together.
Without looking up, Mycroft addressed the other Alpha. “Perhaps in a week or two, when you’re both feeling up to it, we can have dinner. Mummy is eager to meet you.” Sherlock huffed impatiently. “And… there are some… legal matters to discuss.”
Omega with breeding, beauty and the legendary Holmes intellect to pass on to his children, she could have asked, and gotten, almost anything: vast sums of money, prestige, iconic gems or works of art, invaluable favours and preferences for the family… Despite Sherlock’s excess of education and shockingly bad attitude – Mycroft was sentimental about the boy and had spoiled him shamelessly – Sherlock was a priceless asset.
I stood out in the hall wondering what Sherlock had to tell Mycroft. He must have some vital information about Moriarty’s web... I prayed Vinokourov had truly been the end of it.
“Where were we?” I asked, cupping his jaw to kiss him. He was passionate – fiercely so – and I felt myself responding quickly. It was heaven just to touch him again, to run my hands over his chest, down his thigh, to kiss the shell of his ear and feel his shiver of delight. I pushed him down onto his back, rolling on top of him.
Before I was distracted, I had been composing. It was easier to do with my violin, but I hadn't touched an instrument in over two years. I composed in my head, letting the melody flow through my brain, seeing the notes... it kept my mind busy, kept me from dwelling on my situation.
Vaguely, he saw Mrs. Hudson fussing over him, picking up her teapot, moving the rolling table away from the bed, calling for assistance…
"That feels nice." John said, then began to cry. Sherlock could feel the great, gasping breaths shake his friend's body as his sorrow poured out.
Victor put his hand on my arm. “You don’t know the trail. In this weather, it’ll be treacherous.” He saw me blanch. “Sorry, John, don’t worry. I’m sure Sherlock…”
When she talked about Marcas it had a ring of authenticity. Mary HAD been in Venice on holiday, she had pet an adorable dog and spent time at the Peggy Guggenheim. She had found the note – there was more to that story, I was certain. But in all that, I’d learned very little about Marcas. She’d talked more about herself in relation to him, than about him directly.
"No, no... I appreciate you telling me... here we are." The cab had pulled up at the posh three-flat Sherlock had traced him to before. He had an unwelcome flash of memory – Shane kissing John's chest, his neck, his hands traveling over John's body, John's pleasure evident on his face... he banished the image to the garbage heap behind his memory palace.
I felt his strong, square hands on my arms, on my back, as John held me. “No.” He murmured into my neck. “No, it was my fault. I was being a wanker...”
Why were they being killed? It had to be more than just a taunt from Moriarty. Why those specific Omegas?
Mycroft complied, his ear near my mouth. When I didn’t speak, he looked up questioningly. “What is it?” He asked.
"Gun room." He said. "This way." As he showed me where the gun room was, he put his hand on the small of my back. He'd done that sometimes when we were together and the possessiveness of it had thrilled me. Now it felt intrusive.
Shane grabbed a fistful of Sherlock's shirt, his other fist cocked and ready. "Get that 'superior mind' ready for some competition."
I was forced to shower and change into civvies in Uzbekistan before I was allowed on the plane to Rammstein that Mycroft had sent for me. And I forced myself to spend a grudging three minutes cleaning and bandaging the throbbing puncture in my shoulder. But once in Germany, I was ushered immediately into a waiting car without any bother with customs, and whisked to hospital.
"That would be his decision to make." Bob had regarded John. "I think Sherlock might surprise you. He's shown he's able to compromise when sufficiently motivated."
I was in hospital. The regular buzz and bip of machinery a counterpoint to Mycroft’s drone. I thought hard about how I had got here... and remembered the aeroplane, the young doctor. I’d been upset that I was still alive... no one should have to survive what I’d been through...
"No. I'm fine." John didn't need a babysitter. He continued to pore over the autopsy reports looking for commonalities, for a smoking gun. He read about Fraser's illness and Krazinsky's injuries. Fraser had taken blood pressure medication in life and Krazinsky took the same antidepressant that John was currently prescribed. He found the injection marks Sherlock had mentioned – both the suspicious ones and the ones Sherlock himself had inflicted to take blood samples. Fraser's was under his testicles, Krazinsky's between her toes. John remembered the odd night nurse who had uncovered his feet and shuddered.
But if he could save his dearest John from this nightmare... there was no other choice. Sherlock would deal with the consequences later.
John surfed channels while I drank the soup, finally settling on a nature documentary about dung beetles that was mildly interesting.
“You’re eating.” John said. “You didn’t eat your banana this morning.” He started toast in the toaster and opened a can of beans to heat. He put the kettle on for tea and by the time it was ready, his Omega was in the kitchen poking at the beans.
“They must have met – Shane and Sherlock. I can’t imagine Sherlock staying away when you’re in hospital.”
**John, I love you more than I can express. I want nothing more than to be with you in Baker Street again.**
“No. It’s completely unlike him! He texts me almost every day. And he’s never stood me up!” Her lip trembled and I knew she was trying to hold back tears. I took her hand – but I was thinking of Ravi Vaachaspati lying in a filthy alley, slowly bleeding out from gut wounds.
"I know." John sighed. "I know. I forgot what it's like with him, the force of his personality. I thought my anger would insulate me. But it didn't." He stared out the window resolutely, grateful that Shane's arms held him so tightly. "I can't be around him, it's... too painful. He's... the same as he was... completely infuriating and...glorious... and I wanted him. I gave in because I wanted him. I REALLY wanted him. But it was goodbye. We both knew it."
I had the dishes washed, dried and put away within twenty minutes. I dished out the curry and heated it in the microwave. I carried John's up to his room.
The men dragged me forward to the block. Someone pulled my t-shirt off. I didn’t like that – I was so skinny and ugly now, covered in welts and sores. Even at the last, my vanity wouldn’t be denied. John would laugh...
After that, John didn't hug his sister no matter if Dad were around not. He didn't snuggle up when they read books or watched telly. And if she had a nightmare, John would walk her to the kitchen and give her a glass of water. After she'd calmed down, she went back to her own bed.
“Well....” I said slowly, draining my glass and signaling for another. “After I was shot, I got sick. I was pretty out of it for a long time. I ended up discharged – invalided. I was still weak, still recovering... it was a shock, going from a war zone where I was needed, where I was a surgeon... to London where I had nothing. I sustained some nerve damage from the injury that meant I couldn’t perform surgery any more. I wasn’t a doctor. I wasn’t a soldier. I wasn’t needed. I’m not complaining, I’m just trying to explain how it was.” Mary put a sympathetic hand on my arm. “I was trying to reconcile myself to this new life in which nothing ever happened. I was depressed. Obviously.”
“Next time we’ll remember to undress beforehand.” John mumbled, kissing his mate deeply. He quickly unfastened his trousers and freed his turgid Alpha cock, his sac pendulous and heavy.
Sherlock sprang off the couch away from his mate. "Put your Alpha ego back in your pants, John." He said. "And
I was running a chemical experiment right now – the effects of John Watson on my brain chemistry. Having him in the same room was distracting... and wonderful. I loved having him close. But the uncertainty... I couldn't stop thinking about what our relationship was now, what it might become. I knew what I wanted. I had never thought to have it... but John had dangled the possibility in front of me and, sucker that I am, I'd reached for it with both hands.
Then I saw you blinking S.O.S., and you opened the coat so I could see the semtex. The world righted itself and I knew I would do ANYTHING to defeat the monster that had done that to you.
Yes, I was tired. I hadn’t slept in almost 24 hours at that point. But I was a soldier – a surgeon! I was used to sleeplessness, to keeping my head despite it.
My joints hurt. My skin twitched restlessly. I ached all over and my stomach cramped. I retched. Someone put a cool flannel on my brow.
“All day.” I said. This morning I had cleaned myself out and lubed up. I’d played with my butt plugs until I could take the biggest one, the one that was almost as wide as John’s fireplug cock.
I needed to work on the case. I had run off foolishly yesterday, but I had learned several things about the Cliffside Trail – I was out there in a bloody great storm, never having traversed it before, and I was never in danger of going over the edge. The overlooks might have been treacherous to a child or an inattentive idiot – but Sir Afan, in good weather, could only have jumped purposely, been pushed or been chased off. Chances were, someone had confronted him on the Cliffside Trail – but who and why?
I laid on my bed and listened to him in the kitchen. Then I listened to him get ready and then I listened to him leave the flat, laboriously descending the stairs.
I struggled. More proof, if I needed it, that I wasn't myself. I am generally quite adept at keeping myself awake and alert for long periods.
“Vic and the boys are around somewhere.” She said. “They’ll be at dinner. Do you want to settle into your rooms...?”
“Someday.” Mycroft agreed. He paused, his face assuming the considered blankness Lestrade knew so well. “Gregory, when I asked if you were disappointed… I wasn’t speaking of the accommodations. I meant… about this.” He touched his jaw, his fingers lingering on the green smudge. He avoided Lestrade’s eyes, studying his soup instead.
If I could go back, would I? If I could have him alive in all his prickly, infuriating glory, would I? My heart says YES! In an instant. He's mine! My best friend, my closest companion, the man that knows everything about me and loves me - ME! As average and unspectacular as I am, that magnificent creature loves me! I love him too.
"You faked your death and let him mourn for a year and a half. His feelings for you ... will be complicated. But if he DOES still return your feelings – why would that be bad?"
Mycroft’s house is a wonder of spycraft. It’s a modest brick house in Mayfair – not the posh part, but the anonymously middle-class part. Like the still-standing facades of row houses demolished to accommodate the Underground, the homes neighboring Mycroft’s are actually part of his complex, insulating him from contact with punters and rubes. The whole place is wired to the gills, infiltration would be impossible (I know, I’ve tried often enough). There’s a control room where Mycroft’s security detail is camped and an excellent kitchen staffed with a very accommodating cook. But the real marvel is the basement. Or the basements. There are three levels below the first floor, each serving a specific purpose
The fire escape led to the roof. Sherlock dashed across barely glancing to see if the short Alpha followed. He leapt onto another building and then another, stopping only to get his bearings. He heard sirens – the police were finally coming to break up the riot. Sherlock hoped they only sent Betas. Surely the police were intelligent enough to work out what had happened.
The empathetic link was ever-present. They might be kilometers apart, and the low hum of Sherlock's concentration or excitement or irritation would wend its way through John's emotions. He could separate his own feelings if he thought about it, but the world was so much richer with his mate's sharp sensations mingling with his own. It gave John new perspectives, new contexts. The link even brought them together in sleep, their dreams mingling, blending, coalescing into strange and wonderful vistas they shared together.
They rode back to hospital in companionable silence, the tension between them gone for the moment. As long as John needed them, they were on the same team.
Fully detoxed, Sherlock remembered why he had turned to heroin in the first place. The unrelenting misery of his situation – time and distance had done nothing to dull the pain. Only opiates had done that.
But now his knot was planted in his Omega and the position was less comfortable to sustain. At least he wasn’t bent in half, knees to his chest, like Sherlock. John hoped the question would distract them both from their discomfiture.
It's update Wednesday! I've been so excited about this that I almost posted it several times this past week.
“You are mine.” He sighed finally, resting his forehead against the back of Sherlock’s neck. “We are bonded.” He could feel the Omega’s restless pleasure through the newly made empathetic link. It was strong – stronger than John had expected. It was almost as if he could read his Omega’s thoughts.
John pushed the two Omegas behind him and flexed his hands anticipatorily. He thought he could catch her by surprise as she walked past. But the Alpha stopped suddenly. She’d found her colleague that John had beaten unconscious.
John looked into my eyes. So much love in his deep, blue-gray gaze. "Scoot up, then." He suggested, laying back. "Sit on my chest and fuck my mouth."
“Good.” Sherlock said. “You would be foolish not to be afraid of her. When I heard she had taken you in, I was afraid for you.”
He was right to be cautious – the small woman in spandex let fly a roundhouse kick that sent the briefcase clattering to the ground. Instantly the man in the suit was on the stocky woman, punching her in the face. They fell to the ground grappling. The small woman stalked towards the Omega hungrily. John moved to stop her, (
I needed to feel in my body how much he wanted me – I believed he loved me, why else had he extended our friendship into the physical? John wasn’t selfish or capricious, not in that way. He HAD to want me for our affair to continue.
John screamed and squirmed, tried to get away from the evil whip. He felt like his scalp was being ripped off through his nuts. His ears were ringing and every nerve ending in his body was spontaneously immolating. He registered that someone was screaming "Stop it! Stop it! STOP IT STOPITSTOPSTOPSTOP!" seconds before he realized it was himself. Moran didn’t take any notice he was wholly focused on his task. It didn’t require much movement, just a constant flicking of his wrist – something John saw through the haze of pain. He recoiled deep into his mind, burrowing under the torture to a place where he was only dully aware of the crop digging into his bollocks, turning them ruby red, making them swell.
Sherlock didn't comment as John went directly to the sink and drank from the tap. He got a glass down from the cupboard and handed it to John.
Sherlock turned – a nurse had entered and was looking at him with alarm and belligerence. "Trying to work out how a man could be in rigor mortis before anyone noticed he was dead." Sherlock said, demonstrating the corpse's stiffness by trying to lift the arm by the wrist.
The burly nurse laughed. "I didn't realize I had this much competition, John. You shoulda warned me." He gently helped John back into his bed.
I shrugged. "I was younger than you. And my brother is a very dangerous man – I knew he could hurt Victor, he could disappear Victor if he wanted to. I promised not to see Victor again as long as Mycroft left him alone." I took another step towards the boy. "Maybe I should've let Mycroft deal with him. Maybe you wouldn't be pointing a gun at me if I had. But I loved him too much to let Mycroft have his way." I took another step. "But no one can keep Victor out of prison this time. Your sister already called the police, they're on their way. Now Victor has a... a pattern of seducing under aged teens – I know he didn't seduce you, he didn't have to seduce you. He didn't have to seduce ME either. But the police won't see it that way."
John wasn’t sure when Harry started drinking. But liquor was the only thing that brought her out of her room. She was as belligerent a drunk as their father, screaming at Mum and belittling John caustically, blaming him for letting them take her, for not finding her sooner, for being an Alpha…
Sherlock nodded weakly. He noted that he was naked under the thin gown. He scrabbled at it, and then at the circular sensors stuck to his chest. He wanted it all off!
“Sherlock. He’s alive.” He watched her face – the incredulity, the disbelief, the pity that John was so deluded resolving into a fierce joy.
Sherlock watched him finish with the gun and set it aside without commenting. Anything he said would betray his deep anxiety over John's state of health.
John sighed and showed him the story on his phone. "I haven't read it yet. It just... I don't know how they can print this crap." John was getting angry now.
But right now he kissed me and I kissed him back, amazed at my good fortune. I cupped his face, John’s wonderful, expressive face. I loved John’s face. I kissed his brow, his cheek, the tip of his nose.
I wasn’t hungry, but the mess was the best place to discover who was who and how to make myself invaluable to Vinokourov. I was careful to queue with the smuggler and the up-and-comer – one is always judged by the company he keeps.
"John, I'm doing this." He preempted my argument with an impatient gesture. "It's not strenuous. Just a stakeout."
Sherlock helped John don the glove. John found rubbing alcohol in the medicine cabinet and doused himself. "Sherlock, can you hold this tubing straight?" John inserted the syringe in the balloon port and sucked out the fluid. He pinched the tubing close to the urethra and pulled. The catheter came out easily. "Can you throw this away?" It was a relief to have it out of his body. He ripped the glove off his hand with his teeth.
I left him spread out on the futon and made my way to the bathroom. I stopped momentarily to admire it – futons are shite (how I wished for a mattress with some spring beneath us when we fucked), but the Japanese don’t skimp on cleanliness – then I wet a flannel with a sinfully high thread count and grabbed an equally sinful towel.
“I know.” Sherlock said, his head resting on John’s shoulder, inhaling John’s scent. Joy coursed through him, throbbing and pulsing. He knew he should be wary, be careful to expect nothing and to not to hope for too much. He knew John was still angry with him, rightfully, and John was involved with someone else and it was a difficult situation for everyone and it was all Sherlock’s fault.
My sister stared at me, the words slowly penetrating her truculence. “This has something to do with Sherlock.” She observed.
As he limped away, I wished I could follow him, wrap my arms around him and hold him tightly – comfort him best I could. But I was leaking infectious yellow mucous and coughing germs from my shredded lungs... and we hadn't talked, hadn't worked out any of those 'details' John had referred to at Wallog. As far as what our relationship was evolving into, I was in the dark.
Sherlock’s lips twitched with – amusement? Approval? Probably both. He had always enjoyed my contentious relationship with Mycroft. “402’s tenant hasn’t been seen in weeks.”
“Do you?” I asked, my hand stroking his abdomen, seeking downwards, finding his half-hard cock. “I love your ginger bush.” I said and buried my nose in it, his groin hot against my cheek. “I LOVE the smell of you!” He was full hard now, and already damp at the tip. “Sometimes I dream of sucking you.” I told him, glancing up and meeting his eyes. He was staring at me, rapt, indulgent. “Such beautiful dreams.” Without breaking eye contact, I went down on him.
Sherlock had deduced the boyfriend's harmlessness immediately – the man had John's best interests at heart, goddamn him. That DIDN'T mean he was GOOD for John....
He meant that it wouldn’t be long before Sherlock was again overtaken by his heat, desperate for John’s cock, for his knot, his body determined to be bred, impregnated by his Alpha. Heats lasted anywhere from three days to a week – and newly bonded Omega heats tended to be on the longer side – so it was wise to grab sleep and food in the short intervals between frenzied fuck sessions.
And this wasn't really Sherlock's home anymore, no matter how 'at home' he felt. He had forfeited his right to call it home when he'd left on his two-year jaunt through Moriarty’s gang, heroin dens and rehab.
I looked around. A smaller force remained, herding prisoners with their hands zip-tied behind their backs into kneeling positions facing the wall – I noted that there were a number of dead or unconscious inmates in the chamber – many more than those dead at my hand. I fell in with the other soldiers grudgingly, aching to be with Sherlock. I didn’t know how I’d missed his being freed and taken away.
Sherlock had looked confused at first. He’d dropped the bartitsu stick he’d been wielding and stared at his hand. Lestrade had had to be quick on his feet, jumping in front of the consulting detective and using the cricket bat to smash the skulls of the approaching quartet. It had been a near thing, taking out all four by himself.
The nurses treated his rope burns and cuts. He caught one of them looking at the welts on his penis, scrotum and buttocks disapprovingly and slowly John realized the nurse thought he had been injured during consensual sex play gone wrong. He didn't have the wherewithal to contradict the assumption. They placed hot packs on his arms and legs and wrapped him in warm blankets.
Sherlock shrugged. “I’ve only known three – no...” He said, locking eyes with Lestrade. “...make that four – Omegas, including my father.”
"...just grab it for you, or would you like to come in for a drink? Erm... I don't have much, come to think of it. Tea. Maybe a beer... I wasn't expecting company."
"I don't like it." John's hand caressed Sherlock's cheek - Sherlock closed his eyes and savoured the sensation. John's fingers felt wonderful. John pulled him forward and kissed him.
Clearly Sholto didn’t want to talk about his marriage. (Privately John thought the 'problem' was that Mr. Sholto only dated other Alphas. That was always fraught.) He sighed and nodded. “It’s getting away from me, James.”
“Shezzer.” Nazer elbowed me and I remembered that that was my name here. I looked up. Vinokourov was speaking to me.
“Police are on the way. Betas.” He helped her to stand up, keeping his touch professional. “Can you unstrap him?” John gestured at the Omega on the next gurney.
“Disappointed? Mycroft, we’re safe, we have food and protection… showers and beds. There are scientists working on a cure… John is being treated humanely… Anthea says there’s even a gym… I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else at the end of the world. I only wish…”
“If I hadn’t refused the Alpha she chose for me, I wouldn’t be with John now.” Several of them reacted with shock at the very thought of them not together. “I ran away from Sherrinford, from Mummy and the Alpha she and my brother had chosen. If I hadn’t, I never would have found John. I met him accidentally.”
The Omegas loved Virginia. Most of them had never seen an Omega older than 22 – their families weren't affluent and they had all been born to Beta dams – so the mid-thirties Omega was a revelation.
Some time later, the tears had stopped and his stump began to throb. He stood, it took a moment to get his bearings, to feel steady on his feet – he still felt the effects of the compromised circulation in his left leg. He carefully walked back to his bed and lay down. He pressed the call button for a nurse.
"That's the question. We know how – doubtless the sniper set up in that building adjacent – but who and why. I need to know more about Luther Jones." Sherlock studied the laptop. "It appears undamaged." He remarked.
“No!” John cut him off with a furious glare. “Moran would have taken me anyway. He didn’t know you were alive. If you hadn’t come back, you wouldn’t have been there to get me out. There’s only one person to blame for any of this. And he’s dead now.”
Moriarty was my excuse to run from you – that night you kissed me I threw him between us and kept him there. I have no excuse for returning now other than I want to be home in London, and more than anything, I want to see you. I don’t expect that you’ll forgive me easily if at all. Rationally I know you must have moved on by now. But I still love you and I want to try to atone somehow.
“Oh.” I was disappointed. It was a letdown to finally get here and have to wait even longer. “Minor? You’re certain?”
They had kissed?! I felt ill. “Y-you didn’t say that you’d kissed her.” I said to John, working to keep my voice steady. “You didn’t tell me.”
"Your hands are shaking." John said, taking hold of them. He brought them to his lips and kissed them, first one and then the other. "You're shaking all over." He observed.
He looked around. The other thief was on the ground, face down, the man John had made eye contact with and a man in a dark green overcoat were on top of him. Mike was gingerly holding both guns.
As soon as they entered, Sherlock could feel John’s Alpha instincts flip into high gear. The pheromones of multiple Omegas must be difficult to contain. He realised that he and Lestrade had to appear as bothered and pugilistic as the authentic Alphas. He shoved Lestrade off. “Need space.” He growled.
Roaring with rage, the American doctor leapt at John, raining blows down on his head. He took more than a few hits, struggling to do more than defend himself. He was tired and weakening... with the last of his strength he grabbed for her arm as she jabbed... and caught it easily!
His back was tense and I could feel him shaking. “Love, if that’s what you’re feeling badly about – don’t. If you need me to forgive you, I forgive you. In fact, you have my blessing to do whatever you need to do to come back to me in one piece. I don’t care if you fuck your way across three continents, as long as you come home.”
“Several ideas.” Sherlock replied. “I have to run some tests.” Then he was sweeping away, startling John, who jumped up and trailed after him.
“A lot of bodies come through here. I’ve seen a lot of dead Alphas, done their postmortems studied their brains… most of them don’t have bondmates, but the ones that did, their brains are different. Their limbic systems are better developed. Noticeably so.
My dream was still close, the panic and fear still dragging at the edges of my consciousness. I went to Sherlock and touched his forehead, feeling for his temperature.
Perhaps if he’d grabbed her any other way, she could have gotten the upper hand. As it was, she almost killed him immediately – as soon as her face emerged she hurled a stiletto at Moran’s neck. With that lightning speed, he got an arm between himself and the knife and it embedded itself deeply near his elbow. In the seconds it took him to pluck it out, Dusette was on her feet and dancing away, another knife in her hand.
“John...” It was all I could manage as I burrowed my face into his chest and clung to him, all the fear and guilt and hurt of the past two weeks – of the past fourteen months! – came gushing out of me through torturous sobs. John held me, his arms and legs around me, his face pressed to my head, and shushed soothingly, a cool balm on the white hot inferno of my shame.
