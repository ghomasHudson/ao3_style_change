John suppressed a chuckle when Sherlock unceremoniously buried his head into his hair, he briefly felt the other man’s tongue press to his scalp in a part he had made with his nose. The urge to chuckle disappeared when Sherlock moved behind his ear, his tongue coming out and dragging down the crease of it before lingering at the joint of his jaw. Sherlock nipped him gently and John sighed, melting into the bed.
"How is distracting me helpful for you?" Mycroft asked, turning his head in an attempt to look back at him, a halfhearted scowl affixed to his face. Greg was having none of it and removed a hand to gently push Mycroft's chin until he was looking forward again.
There was also the fear, not helping matters anyway. If John found out, though more than likely it was a 'when,' he'd have every right to do whatever he wanted to her. She'd betrayed him, badly. Even she saw that now. But it wasn't just John anymore, she's also betrayed Willa, and that was where John would gather most of his righteous fury from. He'd no doubt take the time to make her feel smaller than a cockroach, less desirable too, before very possibly ending her life.
Sherlock pushed past John and leaned over the rail, he could just barely make out Lestrade’s head in one of the halls below.
Sherlock peeled back the wrapping paper and found a mahogany box beneath. He looked up at John with a questioning glance. John just gave him a knowing smile and nodded to the present.
Ernie was the old man from the assisted living facility. Everything he had eaten in the week leading up to his death had been served to over forty other people as well. None of them had died, well of Thallium poisoning anyway.
He’d considered returning once. Stood on a beach in East London, South Africa (hateful place, didn’t even deserve the title of
Greg had known John for eleven years and Sherlock even longer and he’d truly never seen them this unwound. There had been a few incidents, like when Sherlock jumped off a damn building or John got married, that had come close, but this was something way beyond even that.
So this fic is going to be wrapping up. I'd give you a chapter count but this chapter and the next one were meant to be one but as this approached 6k I had to split it so I'm unreliable with that lol.
Sherlock carefully took John’s hands and pulled him away from the counter. The contact was enough to bring John entirely back to the real world. He looked down and startled, surprised to see blood staining both of their hands where they met. A small droplet welling up and then falling to the floor.
Mycroft nodded. “I do not come here to get your hopes up, John. But an offer has been made to Sherlock. One more mission and he will be pardoned and allowed to return home.”
Sherlock snorted and rolled his eyes. Willa had most certainly picked up that something was worrying them.
Before John could even think to say something Sherlock was out of his chair and bounding up the stairs. “It’s alright, Watson. I’m here.” His voice came over the monitor only a few seconds later.
“John, is that necessary?” Sherlock asked from the door way as he watched his partner tuck his gun into the waist band of his trousers.
John took a steadying breath and looked down at his empty glass. “Mycroft abducted us in May and brought us to his office. It was the first time I’d seen him in months, I was mad at him for not finding a way to keep you here. As it turns out Mary had decided being a mum wasn’t what she’d wanted after all. She was working again as an assassin.”
She told him all the little details and when they hung up John was left standing in the hall feeling… numb. He finished up with his patient before seeking out one of the other doctors to ask if they could cover the rest of his patients.
It was such a difference from three months ago when John had nearly had his wrist broken while trying to wake him.
“I can...” the words stuck in his throat and he was forced to swallow twice before being able to continue. “Identify… her,” he managed to choke out.
“Maybe if you went to bed every night like a normal person.” John teased and he couldn’t resist kissing him again.
“You’re very lively today.” Sherlock commented to Willa who was still bouncing up and down where she stood.
During the walk back to the car John glanced over at Anthea who was back on her mobile, typing furiously.  “What did you say to her back there?”
“No you weren’t, but this is different. Willa will figure it out on her own and she’ll understand it’s like a game.” John insisted.
The girl had been in the press with her father since she’d been a preteen and she enjoyed every moment of it.
Greg turned to go find John and Sherlock in an effort to make sure they were okay and hadn’t somehow managed to raze half of London in the five minutes since they’d disappeared.
“Well I’m not supposed to be talking about it. I mean Erik’s lawyers put out a gag order on Emma when they heard she wanted to go to the press. They said it would affect his trial.” Lukas admitted. “But when I saw you two with your daughter at the funeral I just couldn’t get it out of my head.”
“But you’ve always been straight.” Harry repeated. “That was you. The good one. Straight as a line in everything.”
He turned to his brother and pleaded with him not to make him ask the questions. Not to make him say it out loud.
“Gregory was… unable to determine,” Mycroft spoke up, an unusual amount of tenderness in his voice when he did.
Now Willa was asking him, obviously with John’s approval, to adopt her. It was something beyond his wildest imaginings and only now did he realize how badly he wanted it.
Despite his best attempts to behave like a professional John found he was distracted all day worrying about the other man at work. Trying to figure out exactly what he could have done to upset Sherlock that much. Wondering where he was now and what he was doing. It was just like being in a bloody relationship
She reluctantly followed him into the kitchen where she suffered through hand washing before darting back out into the living room. Molly gestured for her to sit in the arm chair, she climbed up into it quickly and sat with her hands on her knees eyeing the baby.
Janine had cut and cut at her hair until the ends of it didn’t even brush her shoulders, the floor beneath her was still carpeted in the fallen locks. Willa hadn’t been able to control the sniffling as she watched the first strands of her hair fall away. She’d tried though, telling herself she was being silly, it was hair, and it would grow back.
Willa shrugged unapologetically. “Just because you don’t like something doesn’t mean it isn’t true.” She was parroting words John had said to her dozens of times.
Mycroft looked up from his desk perplexed, obviously having expected Sherlock to leave. “It’s our weekend with them but I also believe Deborah is planning a trip with her newest toy. We’ll take an extended weekend in March before the hearing.”
Once the rubbish had been cleared away, the two men settled onto the sofa together. Mycroft checked on the whereabouts of Sherlock and John, apparently terrorizing the homeless population of Peckham, while Gregory called into the Yard looking for an update on the forensics from the site of the fire.
Mycroft’s love of Agatha Christie novels was a secret he was prepared to kill for in order to keep it out of Sherlock’s knowledge. The only person on Earth who knew about it was Gregory and he never teased, he would just get a goofy smile on his face whenever Mycroft grabbed a well-worn book from the shelves. Mycroft lived for that smile, it was the one that told him Gregory Lestrade was madly in love with him for reasons even he had not managed to comprehend.
At noon he heard footsteps on the stairs. It wasn’t John or Mrs. Hudson. Pulling himself out of the room Sherlock shut the door and went to see who it was.
The sofa had been replaced with a larger cloth one and the chair that had been next to it had been exchanged for a wooden rocker. The coffee table had completely disappeared and the rug on the floor was new. There was a proper desk that fit too perfectly between the windows to have been anything but custom built, it was definitely something of Mycroft’s doing though because John would never have splurged for custom furniture.
“Thank you, Sherlock. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.” Willa repeated, she was obviously trying not to squeal for fear of spooking the kitten.
There was a gaping black pit in his gut as he drove. The extent of the fire would have made sense if they’d murdered someone (her) in the room and were trying to hide evidence. It was the dumping of the body in such a place that made him wonder what the hell they were up to.
“You really didn’t have to.” Molly protested but she was already over at it, running her hands over the handles. “But this is exactly what I had wanted, thank you.”
Sherlock’s cock twitched and John watched a small bead of precome well up. He darted his tongue out and licked it. Sherlock moaned louder, fingers gripping the duvet now.
John had protested loudly when he opened his present from Sherlock, a new laptop, until both Sherlock and Willa chose to ignore him for several minutes. He hugged Willa until she complained when he opened the tea cups they had painted. She proudly told him Sherlock had helped her make them. John had leaned his head against his side and whispered a thanks, as Willa continued to open her gifts he didn’t move away.
“Yeah but why? She’s got like four boxes of cereal, not to mention the cereal bars.” John asked again.
For Willa’s first Christmas John had not planned on playing around with Father Christmas. She wouldn’t remember and frankly he’d gotten her a large amount of gifts on his own. But on Christmas morning he’d walked out of the bedroom (once Sherlock’s, now his) and was greeted by the site of a pile presents stacked under the tree and a text.
“Greg is letting everyone know about Janine and they’re sending someone over now to speak to Harry.” John said after regaining his composure.
Sherlock had met sixty-four men named ‘John’ since starting his exile, he called every one by their surname.
Sherlock was making his way to her desk to examine the papers covering it when his phone buzzed in his pocket.
Mycroft had shifted uncomfortably while talking of the dullest things, like there was something he truly wanted to say. For once Sherlock didn’t pick at it until he gave in. He was too busy trying to catalog the changes that had occurred in his brother.
“Alright.” John sighed rolling his eyes slightly. “Just remember for next time.” John called over his shoulder as he went to the bedroom to change.
Sherlock heard the crying several feet from the door and he immediately passed the nurse now knowing where he was going.
“It’s hardly an experts telescope John but if we want her to learn anything she’ll need decent equipment.” Sherlock said in an exasperated tone.
Sherlock took over scrolling and before the timestamp had even switched to 7:30, about five minutes before John and Sherlock had even realized Willa was missing, the three of them headed off the left side of the screen.
Sherlock heard the door open and then the sound of John speaking to someone. Sherlock could tell by the pitch it wasn’t Lestrade.  What surprised him, though, was the sound of footsteps ascending on the stairs. John and the someone who had rang the bell.
Lukas sat as instructed. He leaned forward and looked nervously between John and Sherlock. “I’m Noah’s uncle.” Lukas told them and his eyes were drawn to the shelves of Willa’s things. “Erik is my brother and, I know how this sounds but, he’s not guilty.”
Sherlock couldn’t resist moving closer to John, laying a hand on his arm. “I think that is a good idea.”
Mycroft allowed him a moment of comforting his daughter before finally speaking. “You will go home tonight-“
Erik Wolfe looked like a perfectly respectable man, even in his prison attire. Sherlock could tell John was thinking the same thing. A perfectly respectable, heartbroken, man.
“Thrilled to have the children for two weeks but less thrilled at her choice as to how the spend the holidays.” Mycroft said diplomatically though his loathing for the woman was clear when he spoke about her. “We were thinking doing dinner on Christmas day at around four since we don’t have to return them.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at John, he knew what he was doing. John had been absolutely delighted to discover he could effectively halt all trains of thought by referring to Willa as Sherlock’s daughter or even their daughter. It was a dirty trick and John used it constantly the first week. There was something about the idea that Willa was now
“You know those are meant to be for Willa’s birthday.” John teased nudging Sherlock’s leg with his toe.
Sherlock smiled and hugged her against him again, not missing the fact that John’s phone had reappeared and he was certainly taking their picture.
“As always, fantastic timing, Sherlock.” Mycroft muttered to himself as he thumbed the call button. “Brother dear, to what do I owe this call?” He asked in the sickeningly sweet tone that he knew Sherlock abhorred, Gregory grinned down at his laptop.
“Fuck, oh, fuck.” Sherlock gasped. The word sounded absolutely filthy and foreign in his mouth and John loved it.
John shoved the door open into Harry’s room with far more force than necessary. She started at the noise and all it took was for their eyes to lock for just a second and John knew, without a doubt, that what Mycroft had been saying was true. Harry was sitting in the hospital bed but when John had entered one hand crept up to worry the necklace she wore. Her eyes were wide and she was very obviously afraid of him (rightly so). He could feel the rage building in his chest at an alarming pace.
“John’s only just figured it out. Haven’t you John?” Irene called into the kitchen. “Of course I had to help him along to the notion. Have you figured it out yet Sherlock?”
Suggesting a therapist was entirely out of the question. John was, to his knowledge, the only doctor Sherlock had ever truly trusted and it wasn’t like John had exactly had success with his own therapist. So it was up to John and Mycroft (though the latter would no doubt be met with derision) to watch over Sherlock’s mental state.
“Miss Watson has never communicated with that number before, Sir.” Jessica began informing him even before she was entirely through the door. “The number is registered to a disposable phone that was sold in Chengdu, China.”
John cringed and moved faster. Willa had never woken Sherlock before. John had always been the one to do it given his reactions the first few times he’d done it. John had just never been willing to risk Sherlock accidently hurting her. She wouldn’t have understood.
It was the fact that Mycroft was pacing that was the worrying part, Greg had seen him juggle several devices at once more times than he could count. Except in the past, all of the feats of multitasking had been performed behind a desk, never pacing the floor.
“I’m aware, and yes that too.” John said and sat on the bed to look it over. “But really I would have been more than fine with dropping Willa off and then going home to spend a weekend alone.”
Sherlock laughed. The fact that he had no desire to correct John’s assertions about alcohol and warmth might have attested to his own level of sobriety. “You don’t drink like this anymore.”
Willa was surprised and Sherlock downed his pills quickly. “Willa, go get your brush. Your hair is a mess.” He interrupted.
Lestrade pressed his lips together and seemed to think about it before shaking his head. “Not that I can think of, we’ve just been letting these places slide lately. We sweep out the squatters and they just set up somewhere else.”
Just past midnight he confirmed Willa was indeed asleep and sent the text to Mycroft. Upon reaching the living room again John was confused to find more presents had appeared in the five minutes he’d been upstairs. Sherlock was standing by the table eating one of the cookies left out for Santa.
Sherlock didn’t like Willa crying. She wasn’t a dramatic child who threw tantrums when she didn’t get her way so to have her sobbing on his lap was unacceptable.
Sherlock did slow his stride but didn’t stop walking until a hand wrapped around his wrist in a viselike grip.
John made a mental note to ask how exactly Sherlock got hold of Willa’s last round of allergy testing. “But you didn’t ask me.” He insisted.
There were sirens in the distance, growing louder by the second, no doubt the ambulance coming for Harry. John inhaled sharply, ignoring the ever-growing desire to just give into his own terror.
John smirked again when he noticed Sherlock had managed to angle his hips as far away as possible. “Promise?”
“Roy Turner, forty-two, a disgruntled former bottling plant employee.” Mycroft said as he entered the room.
“No. Please.” John pleaded and he dipped his head down far enough Sherlock could no longer see his face.
John, oblivious to Sherlock’s split attention, began scrolling through the pictures. With a small shake of his head, Sherlock returned his focus to the screen… back to the case, though he allowed John to continue the navigation.
“It’s alright love, that’s Cole and he’s not going to hurt you. Right Cole?” The woman asked, her voice was hard at the end like she was warning him he’d better agree with her.
And then ice flowed through his veins. Not just John but John and Mary. They were together on Baker street. It was wrong. It was beyond wrong, it was repulsive in a way Sherlock couldn’t even begin to explain. Did she sit in his chair? They had probably taken his room, it was bigger after all. She was touching John in his bedroom. They were fucking in his bedroom.
He managed to exchange a few more pleasantries with Molly before she left. He was too busy watching Sherlock and Willa to engage in their conversation properly. Willa had resumed reading and Sherlock really seemed to be paying attention to her.
John had been forced to keep his hands busy for fear of who he would strike when the time came and he lashed out. He was currently making his second kettle of tea since Irene had arrived in order to distract himself from their ridiculousness.
He stood rubbing John’s back for minutes until the door to the restaurant squeaked open. Lestrade pushed his way out of the door and he stopped short at the scene before him. Sherlock watched him over the top of John’s head, he was holding John’s mobile in his hand.
He was drawn once more back to Baker Street. This time Mrs. Hudson caught his arrival. Sherlock was once again impressed by her lack of surprise over the situation, she hadn’t even seemed surprised. She hugged him fiercely for a moment before ushering him into her flat where she poured tea down his throat. Between her and John Sherlock had had more tea in the past twenty-four hours than he’d had in the last two years.
An hour later, after getting dressed and washing Willa’s face, Sherlock found himself with phone in hand waiting for Willa to get her coat on. He needed to warn John both about the cut and about the fact that they were leaving the flat for a while.
She turned and then bolted in their direction grinning madly. She passed them in no time and as she did Sherlock saw the jogger change route as well.
“Let’s go!” Willa shouted at them from the doorway, as if she hadn’t been the whole reason they were still at home.
“No. You will sit next to her and pretend to enjoy this.” John whispered and pushed him over towards Willa.
John raised a hand to cut her off. “No, it was my fault. I made the choice to seclude us from everyone.”
John sighed heavily, completely understanding now. “But she didn’t know, I mean most people don’t. And if it was in the insulin, it would have just kept raising his blood sugar and then he’d get more, a vicious cycle until the dosage was fatal.”
He’d been mortified when his eleven-month-old had broken out in hives at the tree lot. He’d had this grand image of letting her pick the tree and perhaps one day they’d be able to cut down their own. Born out of the desire to make everything perfect for his daughter since she was missing a parent. Instead they’d had to go to the store and pick a tree there.
Sherlock folded his hands under his chin and stared at the hardwood of the desk in front of him. “I’ll have to tell John.”
Sherlock’s hand covered the gap to the top of his thigh. His thumb began gently rubbing circles along the shaft of John’s cock. John’s head dropped back and he let out a soft moan.
Sherlock didn’t know why John found that so pleasing but he was just glad that he’d been able to make John happy.
in the middle of an experiment involving hydrochloric acid and tissue samples but it was rare for John to call him like this.
Lestrade groaned. “Look, he uses his omniscient powers to find us a poisoner in a haystack, the least you can do is help.”
“Sherlock if you insist on continuing to do that I’m taking you to a hospital instead.” Mycroft intoned tiredly.
Once she was done Janine refilled the cup with more water, this time there was nothing crushed into it so Willa drank it more willingly.
Willa bent over the bathtub as she was told, watching the woman out of the corner of her eye. She grabbed one of the jugs of water and turned back to her. “It won’t hurt if you keep your eyes shut,” she warned.
John had finished retching but both hands were on the wall in front of him, bracing himself. He was breathing heavily, one step away from a panic attack. Sherlock stood back and watched him silently.
John, as it turned out, was not wrong in his assumption that Willa would hog the baby. She spent the next hour doing nothing but holding Teddy. John turned on the television after twenty minutes just to give her something to look at if she got bored. She barely paid attention.
That night they didn’t talk after Willa went to bed. Sherlock was in his chair, fingers folded beneath his chin, just staring at the tree obviously lost in thought. John left him to it and decided Sherlock would let him in on what he was thinking if he wanted.
They were all in the living room. Willa was constructing an elaborate tower out of her Legos, Sherlock was typing away furiously on John’s laptop (thought at this point it might as well be
John frowned. He’d taught her years ago that Santa didn’t come until everyone was tucked up in their bed. If she realized Sherlock slept on the sofa she’d be skeptical. “Alright uhm… Willa will ask questions if you sleep on the sofa so I’ll sleep in her room, you can have the bedroom.”
John sensed him and began rubbing his finger tip in soft circles against the muscle. “Relax, Sherlock it’s just me.”
“I won’t if you promise to stick to buying ugly jumpers when you’re emotional.” Sherlock agreed even though he knew it would be much more difficult than that.
Ten years ago Sherlock had been coming off the end of a fairly intense danger night after believing The Woman to be dead. Despite Sherlock’s protests, he had cared about her, whether it was true affection or interest in the puzzle she presented it didn’t matter. Her ‘death’ had affected Sherlock. John had sat with him that night dealing with the emotional whiplash a hurt Sherlock could be. Never once did he imagine Sherlock could be this way.
Sherlock’s heart clenched when he looked at the black screen, he knew what picture was just one button away from lighting up. Willa and Mrs. Hudson had recently emptied her camera’s memory card onto the computer and then proceeded to email John over two hundred photos. John had instantly set one of the three of them from Willa’s birthday as the background of his lock screen. He’d recently started saying that he needed a new picture of the three of them because that one was nearly six months old.
“You were in mourning.” Molly said softly but the way Sherlock’s face broke and he turned away John knew he’d heard the comment.
The bed was unmade and Sherlock smiled at it wondering how long it had taken before John had abandoned the military need to make his bed every morning, or if he was at work twitching uncomfortably remembering his messy bedroom. The sheets were a light yellow and the duvet navy blue, upon further inspection they were both of a surprisingly good quality.
“You’re brother.” John began quietly as they waited for the cast to dry. “Someone came and pulled me from the room and told me Willa was at the hospital and there was a helicopter waiting for me. Nothing else just ‘your daughter’s in the hospital and here’s a ride to London.’”
Sherlock groaned when he realized Mycroft wouldn’t get to the point quickly and finally sat. “You would know how John is, you seem to be close now.”
Harry swallowed at the implication and even Greg looked away. This whole thing was turning to utter shit.
Greg went to argue but realized there was no point in it. Mycroft would no doubt find a way to be there; whether in person, through one of his spooks, or even via CCTV. It was easier just to meet him halfway than try and pretend if he told him to stay that he actually would.
“This is she.” John agreed bouncing Rosie slightly, she wasn’t terribly interested in being introduced.
“Sherlock that’s a cat.” John said looking at the ball of white and grey fluff snuggled up against Sherlock’s chest.
Sherlock immediately felt relieved, John wasn’t upset about the injury, though he doubted there was any way to enjoy oneself at a shopping centre two days before Christmas.
Mycroft did not flinch even the slightest as he took her tie-dyed hand in his and allowed himself to be lead into Baker Street.
“John, I doubt there’s anything you could tell me now that would make me not want this.” Sherlock insisted vehemently.
Greg knew that promise came not from the good parts of Mycroft’s heart but from the part of him who felt Greg didn’t actually know what he was capable of and wanted to keep him in the dark.
The state of Willa’s bedroom made sense now with all the information. John was no doubt terrified Mary would do something and take her away from him. Sherlock made a note to ask Mycroft about the gifts, he’d would have investigated them. Even if his brother hadn’t found out how the gifts were coming Sherlock was determined he would. He would then find Mary and remove her as a threat to John and Willa.
He loaded the cupcakes in a tray while Sherlock fixed her hair into another braided crown. She reminded them she was now six at least five times before they left the house. Because of the cupcakes they took a cab.
John went to pick up Willa that day and by the time they returned home Sherlock had been through the case file twice. He’d managed come up with two solid hypotheses as to what happened but he
Sherlock’s blood began boiling as he watched each of the short videos. Not a single one of the dozens of people they passed had even looked twice. Everyone just saw a sweet family heading home after dinner, the little one exhausted. No one noticed that Willa had only one sandal or that her head was being jostled about in a manner that would surely have woken any other child.
John then turned and ran down the hall to find Sherlock standing just inside what amounted to a massive walk in closet. His eyes found Isabelle almost as soon as he walked in behind him.
Sherlock was so elated he felt his heart begin to pound again. All was well. John was on Baker Street.
“John, they’ve just taken me off intake,” she continued even though she couldn’t bring her voice much above a whisper, “there was a little girl’s body found by the river.”
They’d been oddly specific about where he was to dispose of her body: on the south bank of the Thames just past the Waterloo Bridge. He’d even been sent photos of the exact location. Typically when you were dumping a body you wouldn’t leave it in such an open spot, even if you were looking to make a statement. Doing that in an area that open was a risk for the person doing the dumping (him) especially if they were forced to do it during daylight light he’d been.
Molly straightened up so quickly that something in her back actually popped. “How could you?” She asked
She’d last been seen by her boyfriend and manager on the evening of the thirteenth though no one reported her missing until the fifteenth when she didn’t show up for a massage she had scheduled.
Willa was in love with Mycroft’s estate. She was a city child through and through, thriving on the motion and the noise, but the large home and immaculate gardens captured her attention. Christmas made it even more spectacular. Mycroft was never showy or over the top about decoration but the whole place came alive with lights and warmth. Every year it looked like the front of a postcard.
“You will, John.” Mycroft snapped, this was enough to keep John from protesting again. “You will go home and tomorrow morning you will go to work.”
“Fair point.” John agreed. “But you also have to tell me if you want to do something. Even if it’s not about Willa. I’m trying not to ask too much of you but I’m just guessing at what you’re ready for. So if you want something tell me.”
Sherlock seemed to grow more quiet and tense as they drew closer. John felt a pang of sympathy for him. The two Christmases they’d spent together hadn’t been exactly the best and from the sounds of it neither had been the ones they spent apart. He felt a bit guilty too. He’d had friends and family (who he’d only gained from knowing Sherlock) to help ease the sense of loss and absence but Sherlock had had only himself.
“Go get yourself breakfast.” John told her after his head had come up slightly, also checking the time.
Greg sat back down next to Mycroft and looked sheepish. “Deb’s new job means she can’t pick them up after school and David’s got practice so apparently some days Addy’s been going home on her own.”
“You wanted children.” Sherlock said once he was sure John was fully awake. John still woke surprisingly quickly to a presence in the bedroom.
As the holidays approached John felt the familiar itching return to his veins. If it wasn’t for Willa’s absolute joy over the season he wouldn’t have celebrated them at all. Too many things had happened during this season for him to enjoy them much.
Seeing the mobile reminded Greg of something and he pulled his own out and quickly dialed the morgue.
It took a bit longer before he was capable of processing the words. “I love you, you’re gorgeous. I love you.” John was whispering on repeat, hand drawing calming circles on Sherlock’s chest.
John walked into the flat and found Sherlock and Willa curled up on the sofa, Willa leaning into his side reading to him. Molly was sitting in his own chair watching them.
“I need oxygen, sometimes.” John whispered afraid that speaking would break the moment, though he doubted a bomb could by this point.
John nearly laughed at the palpable relief on Sherlock’s face when he informed him that he’d never perpetuated the Easter bunny myth.
“I was too much of a coward to do it.” John continued as he found one of Sherlock’s hands with his own.
Willa did, sinking further back into Sherlock’s chair. Once John was certain her eyes were properly shut he came into the room.
“Oh no I’m not.” Molly waved her free hand towards herself. “Aaron and I decided to adopt. We were matched with a birth mother a few weeks ago and she didn’t want to find out what the baby was until he had a family.”
“You just bought a six-year-old a two hundred and fifty pound telescope.” John said incredulously as they were leaving the store. Said telescope under Sherlock’s arm.
After the divorce she moved into the bottom of a bottle, only working when the situation got dire and John refused to help her out. Only in 2015, after an ultimatum issued by John, she managed to maintain a functional level of alcoholism in order to be able to see her niece, this included a steady job.
On the days John worked Sherlock would pick Willa up from school, it made more sense than John trying to rush through patients at the end of the day. On Monday and Friday her tutor (who Sherlock only barely managed to tolerate) would be waiting for them when they got home and on Wednesday they went to her French teacher’s house.
John just grinned at the both of them on the screen, not caring if he looked like a sentimental old fool.
John wasn’t sure if he was amused that Willa had not only absconded with Sherlock’s phone but she’d gotten into it to text him or terrified. There was also the matter where she was actually signing her texts the way Sherlock did.
On of my friends is actually in London right now and is actually going to see the fireworks. I'm beyond jealous and that *might* have played into this chapter some.
Mycroft had been at work for a few hours when Sherlock arrived, his coffee had been refilled twice and the second batch had gone cold in his cup.
Irene looked between the three men and realized what John was saying. She felt terribly for John and Sherlock. “When?”
“Sherlock. I wanted to ask you…” She trailed off until John squeezed her hand and gave her an encouraging smile.
They took a cab to the Benihana in Chelsea, it was closer to Harry’s flat, and only managed to be ten minutes late. As Sherlock had predicted Harry wasn’t even there yet. John scowled at the sidewalk and checked his phone, there were no texts warning that she’d be late. John decided to text her to see if she was even going to bother showing up.
Sherlock quickly and carefully recaptured John’s wrists. “No, it’s alright. Just a cup, not yours,” he soothed.
The three of them ate dinner together. Sherlock ate an entire serving without cajoling or complaint and he didn’t even comment on the fact that Willa spent most of the meal talking. John was impressed with his restraint.
I ended up having to read some of my old fics to remind myself that I actually know how to write porn.
Harry looked up, seemingly just as surprised that there were other people in the room too. “I don’t know.”
Sherlock made a scoffing noise and sat up, his hair was wild and frankly adorable. John wanted to reach out and smooth it down. “Of course it is.”
John gently began rocking the chair. “Willa starts Christmas break tomorrow and I’ve got work. I wondered if you’d watch her.”
Greg had resolutely kept John at the pub for no less than three hours and valiantly put up with the fact that John literally had nothing to talk about other than Willa.
“Oh come now we need a picture of the four of you.” Mrs. Hudson said as she came over to them and all but shoved them towards Willa.
Sherlock found John leaning against the wall of the alley, emptying the contents of his dinner onto the dirty street below him.
“Was that the last straw then?” John asked. He’d not gotten the full story as to why Greg had, after five years of the same custody agreement, decided to fight for its change.
A bark-like laughed echoed down the hallway and from the way everyone, including some of the nurses, were looking at him John realized he’d been the one to make the sound. “Jesus,” he groaned and scrubbed a hand over his face.
John really did spend the next few hours cleaning the house while simultaneously worrying about Sherlock. He knew how difficult it could be to readjust to civilian life. Sherlock might not have been a soldier the way John had been but no doubt he’d been fighting a private war for the last six years, longer really.
Oh boy, howdy folks. I'm gunna drop in and post this chapter and pretend like it HASN'T been well over two years, okay? Good. I mean after all we're all in the Sherlock fandom so we're used to it... right?
John supposed he should have minded Sherlock asleep in his bed during the middle of the day but he didn’t. Something about the scene tugged at his heart and he had told him he was welcome at anytime. Sherlock had clearly not been sleeping well, the bags under his eyes the previous day had been shocking so John had no desire to kick him from his bed. Instead he quietly gathered up his clothing and went into the bathroom to change.
“You want to be like everyone? That’s boring.” Sherlock informed her. From the corner of his eye he could see John watching the exchange cautiously.
Lunch left them just enough time to make use of the shower before they left. John was delighted at the bench seat under one of the water jets. His mouth filthier than usual when Sherlock rode him there. It was enough to make Sherlock flush and his cock even harder.
“I’m sure he does feel guilty about that but he was only a child himself Sherlock.” John reminded him gently.
Sherlock turned down the drive to Mycroft’s house and John pretended to sulk. “You two ganging up on me.” He teased.
John sent three more texts just after seven the next morning asking where Sherlock was. Sherlock ignored him. He intentionally spent the morning away from Baker Street. He found he was frequently wondering what Willa was doing with Molly. He lasted until three before hailing a cab.
“Yeah, because our bodies make us sick before we can smoke more but with that e-cigarette sshit it’s like pure nicotine.” John concluded.
After lunch she and Sherlock took a nap in front of the television, this time Willa was curled into Sherlock’s side. John joined them after tidying the kitchen. Curling up at the other end of the couch he fell asleep watching their chests rise and fall in sync.
Well, as free as he could get while stuffed in the back of one of Mycroft’s cars. They were leaving Heathrow and heading towards London.
After a lively argument for and against olives, in which John realized both Holmeses and Willa were on the same wide while he and Greg were opposing, Willa was instructed that David and Addison were in the media room. She bounced off in that direction.
He’d been just seventeen in 2001 and with the same righteous fury that most American’s seemed to carry at the time he’d enlisted in the army on his eighteenth birthday in the spring of the following year. It seemed like every boy from his graduating class was going straight from the ceremony into basic training. It had made him proud.
Greg watched as Mycroft paced in front of his desk, one mobile wedged between his shoulder and ear with another being furiously pecked at in his hands.
For a moment, all Sherlock did was give John an odd look before he pulled out the disinfectant. He was quiet as he set to work, his talent in triage had increased over the years and he was able to stitch and bandage nearly as well as John could.
“Well he’ll need a name so you think on that.” John told her with a nod. Sherlock stood and walked over to him.
“Uh. Thank you. This is mostly Belle. She completely redid the flat when we bought it, turned an entire bedroom upstairs into a closet for herself.” Greer said stumbling valiantly through the mental whiplash Sherlock had imposed with his sudden topic change.
It wasn’t until Sherlock and John were standing shoulder to shoulder, Willa in front of them, that she finally stopped trying to push them closer.
Sherlock jerked back, offense written all over his face. Greg even made an aborted motion to come between them.
“Website?” John repeated and put down his book. “Please tell me you’ve not started updating ‘The Science of Deduction’ again.”
“Hello lovelies.” He said when Sherlock and Willa’s faces appeared on the screen. They were up in her room.
At the beginning of his familiarity with the flat Mycroft was confident that it would never know such a thing as silence. Sherlock was always winging about something (usually Mycroft) and John, so eager to please in those days, would be following him about trying to find the neutral ground between Mycroft and his younger brother. As time marched on John worried less about pleasing Mycroft and the noise became jokes cracked at his expense.
“I know, damn my brother.” Sherlock’s voice was flat which John knew meant he was paying more attention to the book than to him.
She’d known, of course, who innocent little Nurse Mary Morstan was. Jim had been so terribly fond of her and her skills as an assassin. She was very surprised when Sherlock didn’t object once to the little farce that had been John and Mary’s wedding, surely he’d been able to see right through her. Then again, Sherlock was always so blind when it came to John, love did that to a person.
John understood now. He’d heard about the Wolfe’s divorce through second hand child gossip, it was enough to know it had turned ugly and Mr. Wolfe was seeking sole custody of the children.
John went out of his way to offer his condolences to the older woman he assumed to be Noah’s paternal grandmother. He felt Emma’s glares as he walked away.
“Ten years ago if someone had said Sherlock Holmes would one day willingly braid my daughters hair I would have asked them what drugs they’d taken.” John announced as he peered into the bathroom after her.
John was sure whatever pieces of his heart that were intact shattered at the look on Sherlock’s face.
He and Harry had never been close, even growing up. She was the one to push all the buttons and break all the rules. John for the most part managed to keep himself out of trouble. Her drinking didn’t help any and despite all the constant claims to want to quit she never managed. He found if he just contented himself with the fact she managed sobriety three nights a year it made his life easier.
“A bicycle?” John asked as the girls squealed and darted towards them. It was obvious just by the size which one belonged to which girl but the smaller one also had training wheels. John had honestly never thought to buy Willa a bike, which was stupid because he used to bike everywhere.
“Captain John Watson, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.” Sherlock clarified, hands now slowly making their way down John’s back as if mapping him.
Sherlock stood and went to John who was leaning against the wall into the living room. “You would never let Mary do anything to hurt Willa and I will never let her do anything to hurt either of you.”
Harry shrugged, finger twisting around a gold chain she was wearing. “Well… yes,” she admitted finally.
“In the week before June got sick what did she eat… or take.” Sherlock was positive the Thallium wasn’t in drugs but he had to ask.
Willa jumped up and ran into the bathroom to check her hair in the mirror. John winced as the sound of her sandals echoed off the tile. It was only mid-June but he’d finally given into her pleas to wear the horrible things. She hated the routine of shoes and socks, taking them off as soon as she could which made winters difficult, so when the weather began to creep just the slightest bit towards warm she would beg John for her sandals.
“But the master is on the first floor?” Sherlock asked even though he was already across the room flinging open the doors to said room.
Suddenly there were a pair of hands pulling him around and he found himself with his face buried in Sherlock’s shirt. “I’m sorry. I’m sure you think I’m being stupid.” He apologized
It took just a moment too long before she remembered herself and laughed in the face of Sherlock’s rage. “Fine, I’ll look for her, but I won’t be sticking my neck out for nothing,” near the door she paused and turned to narrow her eyes at John, “you will owe me, John Watson.”
John’s lips were on his, then. They were cold from standing outside but soft against his own. He felt a sound escape his throat, thankfully drowned out by the noises around them, and then he remembered to kiss back. John pulled away minutely after he did.
This chapter was horrifically Frankensteined to life. I edited it and it seems smooth to me but if it has weird transitions I apologize.
Getting those words out was possibly one of the hardest things she’d done. Listening to John’s choked half sob down the was a close second.
Sherlock had been out of bed before he’d woken the next morning but the empty space was still warm. Neither man mentioned it and John decided just to go about their day as usual.
If they were at home Greg could have found a way to occupy himself, to feel useful. Whether that was making tea or pacing around his own bedroom. Hell, he'd probably feel more useful in the near-empty flat Mycroft insisted on keeping because it was nearly center between their offices. So instead of being able to find something to do, Greg was forced to sit on his hands and watch his husband try and control the world.
He looked up to see John smiling at them, there were tears in the corners of his eyes. As though suddenly made aware of tears Sherlock became cognizant of ones of his own forming.
Mycroft had insisted on looking at several schools instead of just sending her to the local school, citing her above average intelligence as a factor. So John spent weeks touring different schools until he finally found one that was the right mix of advanced lessons and play. He put in their application on a Tuesday and on Friday afternoon John was informed of her place.
After she had left the bathroom and joined him in the kitchen he gave her a glass of juice. She still looked tired and he figured the sugar would help wake her up. She drank it quickly.
“We could leave if Harry and Willa would just get back.” John said as he impatiently checked his watch for the third time in the last fifteen minutes. He never understood females and their ability to spend half an hour in the toilets.
“April.” John answered giving Irene a dark look. “When I was in Cardiff, she approached me at a pub.”
He was in serious danger of losing all vocabulary past John’s name when the lube clicked a second time. He forced his eyes open to watch John slick himself. He would gladly replace all 243 types of tobacco ash with this image.
She nodded excitedly. John was thrilled to see her happy again, she’d spent a few days after Noah’s funeral very quiet and tearful. It was only now, two weeks later, that she was finally beginning to act herself again. It helped that she’d spent Saturday playing with Addison while Mycroft and Greg met with lawyers concerning their own custody hearing.
He traveled back up this side in much the same fashion as the first. When he reached John’s arse he nipped at it again and shifted back.
“John?” Sherlock breathed after Hayley and Luke had disappeared for the moment off to save a stranger’s child from the clutches of their mischievous twins.
Sherlock scowled and dropped himself roughly into one of the chairs. “Stalking people is rude, Mycroft, and probably not a very appropriate use of government funds.”
Janine pushed the door open just then and smiled, though it didn’t seem friendly. “What do you think?” She asked.
Irene smirked. “I’d heard someone managed to melt your brother down, I can now see why.” She winked at Gregory Lestrade and he colored but took a step back.
She was seated at the table eating breakfast, her hair had been messily pulled back by John so it wouldn’t dip into the milk when she ate. She seemed half asleep still, though she’d flashed Sherlock a huge smile when John told her who was staying with her today.
On his part time salary at the surgery he’d be able to afford the rent, the other bills and some food but there was no way he’d be able to pay Willa’s school tuition or her tutor’s fee. Even if he went full time he would only be just able to cover the tutor and the rest would go to better quality food. Things would be tight unless he got a job at a proper hospital and worked overtime.
“His name is Hadeon Wolanski. Known ties to the Ukrainian Mafia. Previous charges for extortion, money laundering, and theft to name a few.” Mycroft recited handing over a paper to John.
Sherlock stood abruptly. “I’ll make him the offer and let you know.” He was about to leave when, for reasons unknown to him, turned and asked. “Why do you have the children then? Shouldn’t you and Lestrade be off…” He trailed off unable to finish the sentence.
John shrugged. “I missed you. All I wanted was for you to know Willa and for her to know you. Since I couldn’t bring you back I was going to make damned sure she knew all about you. So, I brought her into London at barely three weeks old.”
Harry couldn’t blame the woman, John was always so obviously in love with Sherlock from the moment they met that competing for his affections must have been exhausting.
Sherlock would have, he meant to, but it never seemed to be the right time. “I didn’t want to ask in front of Willa since I don’t think she knows.”
I'm a lazy writer and draw most of my case ideas from real life cases. That being said my google search history is concerning.
“June Olsen’s girlfriend gave her the spare soda she got out of a vending machine, a nursing aide who was fond of Mr. Tash shared the extra soda she received at the machine outside her house with him, Karen Miller’s son forgot to bring a water bottle to football practice and when she bought him one she drank the soda that fell out with it.” Sherlock explained and stopped when he saw the comprehension drawing on Lestrade’s face.
Erik sighed and looked up at the florescent light fixed to the ceiling above him, all of the fight drained from his body. “What’s the point? I didn’t kill him but everyone swears I did. What’s the point?”
Willa stopped reading and looked up at him. “Daddy you’re home!” She exclaimed but didn’t move from her spot.
The kitten was surprisingly amenable to having a collar put around his neck. As soon as John fastened it Sherlock pulled out a blue bow roughly the size of the kitten’s head and fastened it to the back of the collar.
She continued to grow much to John’s dismay and by Christmas she was seriously considering taking her first steps. As she grew so did her family. Mrs. Hudson had become Nana, Greg Lestrade became another uncle (and with him she gained two cousins), and by the second time Molly babysat she had become an Aunt.
, six days after Sherlock stepped on a plane and after sixteen hours of labor, Willa Louise Watson was born. Being just over six pounds and 48 centimeters long she was just a tiny thing in the doctors palm but her lungs were anything but. She screamed her displeasure at the world while being held up and announced, she screamed while John cut the cord, she screamed during her assessments, and when she was finally wrapped up and placed in her father’s arms she squinted at him from beneath red lids and promptly screamed louder.
He huffed into Mycroft’s office wishing he hadn’t been dressed for the day when they came. It irritated Mycroft greatly when he came in in a dressing gown.
It would have been nothing to place a gun back into John’s hand, wave a paper in his face, and ship him off to parts unknown. But Sherlock was so taken with the little doctor that he allowed their friendship to grow. Because even if some of it was at his expense, Mycroft enjoyed watching Sherlock experience the joys and tragedies of friendship.
John continued to hesitate. “Sherlock I know we’ve taken over the whole flat but this is still your home. You’re always welcome here whenever, at two in the afternoon or two in the morning. If you want, we can find a way for you to move back be it Willa and I moving out or-”
“I am going,” Greg said as firmly as he could manage, “and until we, meaning Scotland Yard, decided there is sufficient enough evidence no one is going to contact John or Sherlock, understand?”
John’s heart stuttered in his chest and it took him a moment to speak. “One of the first things I did when we met was shoot a man for you because you needed protecting. You were perfectly capable of doing it yourself but I knew the moment I saw you in that room that you wouldn’t. You would have killed yourself to prove a point.”
“Six years,” Mycroft said more sharply than he’d meant to but he held any apologies and watched her until she began to turn. “And please make sure someone is trying to track this number,” he called out as she reached for the door.
“You can toss her out on her arse.” John finished for him. Sherlock was satisfied and planned to do just that, even if she’d only had one glass of wine.
John spent the entire day worrying about Sherlock. His leaving in the middle of the afternoon had been odd enough but then to not return home, even for a little, had caused John to worry. The only thing that had stopped him from dropping into a full blown panic was a text from Greg saying Sherlock was at their house.
After a while of assuring herself they’d find her soon Janine came back in. “Let’s see your hair,” she said cheerfully.
“Why are you so nervous?” John asked and Sherlock was irrationally proud of him for having noticed that.
When Willa got home Monday night she surveyed the state of the kitchen and living room. “We should do our bedrooms next, as a surprise for daddy.” She suggested.
“The man, he was American and he was maybe that one’s height.” Harry answered and pointed at Sherlock. “Brown hair, white. I didn’t really look at his face. She was Irish, I think, taller than me but shorter than the man. Dark brown hair, very pretty.”
I LIED HE'S A FUCKING CINNAMON ROLL OF LIGHT AND GOODNESS AND WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING BAD.  (seethes at the television)
“Do you think it wise?” Sherlock was worrying too. Just because they had no proof this year was different didn’t mean he couldn’t stop imagining Mary taking Willa while she was out from under their protection.
“She’s missing right?” John had seen some of the coverage playing on the television in the waiting room.
Willa let out a moan of exasperation. She grabbed Sherlock’s hand and began swinging it in an effort to amuse herself. Sherlock allowed her to do so.
Mycroft didn’t want to admit how little he knew he’d actually given his brother so instead he opted to warn him. “She’s clever, Sherlock. This isn’t some bumbling fool we’re dealing with, this is a woman who has already successfully duped us all.”
Slowly he pressed one finger into himself. He looked up to find John watching his face, intent and hungry. Sherlock kept eye contact as he leisurely began fucking the finger into himself. He carried on for far longer than necessary.
John huffed out a chuckle and settled back into his own chair deciding it really wasn’t the end of the world if Rosie still woke a few times during the night.
Willa was circling the microscope with, what John could only describe as, hungry eyes. Sherlock noticed and went over to her.
Also I was mapping out future chapters and realized that everything I want to do cannot be done in this one fic. Mostly because it'll be just as huge and feature multiple points of view. Also, I want to give you all a chance to hop off the train while it's mostly rainbows and fluff. There will be angst and more badassery in the next one.
“The college, the museum, the planetarium and then we get to eat dinner at Angelo’s.” Willa rattled of sounding especially excited about dinner.
“I’m sorry who is this?” The third man asked, Irene recognized him as someone she’d seen in photos with Sherlock.
“He gave us nothing new on Mary before his death.” Mycroft said, he almost sounded apologetic about that fact.
“Aunt Molly helped me paint a tea cup for daddy’s Christmas present.” Willa explained. “I hid it in my desk but I didn’t have a box for it. I was going to ask you but I tripped.” She did begin crying this time, burying her face in his chest.
This finally got his brother to look up. “Of course I do.” He said in his best ‘don’t be silly, Sherlock’ voice. “John has become a brother to me. He stood up at my wedding for me, he trusted me to keep them safe and he gave me a niece.”
John did a double take after he said that. “Are you sure? You hate Christmas shopping and well… Christmas.”
Sherlock managed to get Willa to stop crying just in time for them to want her in radiology. She remained stoic through the trip to the room, gripping his hand tightly with her uninjured arm. When they removed the splint Sherlock had to school his face, knowing she was watching his reaction.
He jumped when Molly deliberately let the door shut loudly behind her but she refused to move from the doorway. Here she really couldn’t see anything taking place in the room.
John realized his mistake then. Not even science and facts could touch the parts of Sherlock’s mind that were pure and raw emotion.
He’d hesitated a little remembering the sting of losing Redbeard but cats lived longer than dogs, at sixteen or older Willa would be able to cope with losing her pet. Deciding on a Siamese was the easy part, locating a reputable breeder with a flawless history and kittens ready for homes was more of a challenge. He’d found a breeder in Cambridge with one male kitten who had been returned after a new owner’s allergy.
Sherlock’s fingers itched to reach out and take it. To open it and read over everything John had been doing for the past five years. But he couldn’t. He hadn’t let himself think of John since his drugs binge, hadn’t even the guts to say the name out loud which made things difficult given the popularity of it.
On Wednesday night the forecast had called for more snow. Willa had jumped up and ran into the kitchen upon hearing the news. She’d pulled out bowls and set them on the table before climbing into John’s lap excitedly, nearly knocking his laptop to the floor.
“You want to go out On New Year’s Eve,” Sherlock said slowly as he slid the game towards himself. “With me?”
“Sherlock this is- thank you.” John said. He had to be yelling for Sherlock to hear him but his voice was soft.
John was doing his best not to smile at Sherlock’s antics. “You can intimidate her other teachers later, today we’ve got to meet with the head teacher.”
Sherlock returned the kiss albeit a little reluctantly. “It’s a Benihana, hardly a hotbed of crime.”
I have gone back and edited the prologue and ch 1. No content has changed but I cleaned up the wording and fixed some errors.
Sherlock found himself smiling fondly at the other man. John was always especially gorgeous like this. Sated and sweaty lying naked across the bed, completely unashamed of himself. The sunlight in the room made this moment especially endearing, as this normally happened late at night.
John felt like he was living on the edge of a razor for the next few weeks until he realized it could be months or years to complete an MI6 mission. So he began to occupy himself with more urgent matters, like the fact that Willa was due to start primary school in the fall and he’d been avoiding thinking about it.
Before anyone could say anything else John took another deep breath and continued. “I’m sure you’re aware that without it I can’t afford the school. Going full time I can probably just afford her tutor if I drop her down to once a week. It wouldn’t be ideal but the local school does have a gifted-“
They followed Mycroft through the halls and into the lift, Sherlock was silent the entire time. When the lift stopped, back on the ground floor, Mycroft stepped out and gestured down a hall to where bathrooms were clearly marked.
Sherlock sighed at his brother’s oversight, he tugged John’s arm to move him so he could hug him. “I’m sorry. No wonder you were so worried.”
As he watched John struggle with the emotions he’d dragged up, Sherlock was filled with a similar compulsion to the one he’d had while helping tuck Willa in. He wanted to cross the room and kiss John.
Greg raised an eyebrow at that, though he couldn't help but smile a little at Mycroft's perhaps excessive use of the title husband.
When Sherlock opened the door John realized it had been a lot more work than just removing mould and painting the walls.
“Me? That’s your problem with this? You let me believe she was dead for a decade!” John shouted clenching his fists, Lestrade took one step towards them.
“I’ll get it.” John volunteered softly and he went out of his way to lean down and kiss the top of Sherlock’s head.
John went and sat in his chair to watch. Sherlock hesitated by in doorway before sitting on the arm of John’s chair, his own chair was too close to the action and facing entirely the wrong way. John seemed surprised for a moment but then relaxed back again.
Willa grew and grew and as she grew John missed Sherlock even more. Mycroft had promised once that he would never let John remain in the dark if Sherlock died, that he would know as soon as Mycroft did. So every month that passed John had to live content with the knowledge that Sherlock was alive somewhere that wasn’t here.
Sherlock realized he couldn’t tell her how bothered he actually was about Wolanski’s death so he shrugged. “I know we’ll find another lead.”
John had brought it up for the first time only a few days after her birthday. He’d only told Sherlock that their lives had settled and it was time for Rosie to develop a healthier sleep schedule. That same night she woke at midnight and Sherlock was in the room by her second cry. The next morning John had armed himself with studies on infant sleep patterns in an effort to appeal to Sherlock’s scientific nature.
Sherlock took the opportunity to look. He’d only realized he’d licked his lips when John surged forward kissing him fiercely. Sherlock allowed it and then pulled away, holding John’s waist to keep him at a distance. John crossed his arms over his chest.
John let his breath out through his nose. “It’s alright.” He wasn’t very good at being reassuring. “What did they look like? Anything you noticed? Birthmarks, scars? Anything.”
When he’d gotten out Willa was sitting on the table watching as Sherlock made eggs, from the looks of it this was at least the second attempt at doing it.
As soon as they stepped off the train John took Rosie and carried her, as if she was a shield between himself and the rest of the world. He didn’t bother to ask where they were going, John wasn’t going to tell him. Instead, Sherlock followed quietly into a cab.
“And besides. He’s moved back into the flat and I know for a fact there are only two bedrooms up there.” She smirked at him like the Cheshire cat.
While still satisfied that he’d thought ahead to covering Willa’s hair Sherlock had not thought about his own. He showered while the fifth batch was in the oven, instructing Willa to alert him if it smelled like burning.
They spent the weekend coming up with several ideas for further experiments, Willa brainstorming and Sherlock helping her expand the ideas or just writing them onto the list if he felt they were developed enough. The list was stuck to the refrigerator Sunday night after dinner.
John rolled his eyes and wandered into the kitchen. The room is basically the same. A half refrigerator, a small table for eating with two chairs, a sink, a range and a handful of cupboards. John suspected the only reason the range had stayed was due to the kettle sitting atop it.
He’d been so confused the day before when he walked into Willa’s room as she was slamming her cast off the edge of her desk. It just wasn’t like her, she wasn’t a self-destructive child, but he didn’t have time to deduce what was going on. He’d had to stop her from hurting herself further.
Sherlock turned off the kitchen light with more force than necessary. “No go ahead.” He made sure John knew he wasn’t buying John’s claims of being okay.
John was lucky, she left him over half of her chips and several bites of burger. He ordered her an ice cream while he finished.
“What do you have, Mycroft?” John asked Sherlock didn’t have to look behind him to see he had risen from his chair and was moving across the room. John wasn’t a fool, he would have already reached the same conclusion Sherlock had.
She looked up at John with a curious gaze, fork still trying to twirl up as much fettucine as possible.
By the time John got back home the original cup was swept up, the new cups painted and carefully hidden away in Mrs. Hudson’s flat. The table had been cleared and the only evidence of their afternoon craft was the paint brushes drying by the side of the sink. Only after Sherlock promised that he would personally do the baking of them the next day did Willa stopped fretting over it.
“I said I had to check with you.” Sherlock said as he stood and wandered into the kitchen to see what John was making.
John sucked in a breath, he knew the ‘offshore account’ was no doubt accessible by Sherlock wherever he was. This was the first time Mycroft even came close to admitting he was still looking after his younger brother. “Yes, yes. Fine. I get it we’ll look into a tutor.”
“Really?” Mycroft wasn’t really as surprised as he sounded. He knew Reinette was a terribly clever girl and would no doubt try and leave as many clues behind as she could, it was the fact that the fire had truly been connected to her that had surprised him.
John only let up slightly still pressing into his prostate, milking him for everything he could give and then some. Just as Sherlock was about to beg him to stop, that it was too much, John came. His fingernails digging so hard into his hips that there would be blood.
This had her nodding and moving into the room. John’s altruistic values had clearly been instilled in her.
John nodded and looked away from Sherlock, he was obviously feeling guilty from the way he now glued his eyes to the floor. “For how long?”
Willa put the brush back into the bottle as she finished Molly’s nails. “I’m going to have a baby cousin soon.”
“This year we thought it might go better if we got them each one larger gift.” Greg interrupted Mycroft’s speech. Mycroft didn’t look too put out, he simply nodded.
“Yes it is.” She agreed. “We’re going to be having an assembly this afternoon to let the children know and we’re calling to invite parents to come if they feel their child might need extra emotional support.”
John hummed in agreement and then rewarded Sherlock by bringing up his other hand to fondle his balls. Sherlock’s head dropped back and he was glad he got it right.
Anthea looked up from her phone and sighed. “You are aware you applied for a spot nearly six months after everyone else had, right?”
Willa was content to push around the 2 centimeters of snow with her little shovel while John sat in the doorway nursing a cup of tea and a novel. Mrs. Hudson, who was recovering splendidly from her surgery, joined him every now and then to chat.
Sherlock nodded. “I promise you she’s not going to come down with botulism. It’s for her allergies.”
John let the dig about his writing slide and picked his book back up. He didn’t get any farther in reading it, finding himself oddly touched by Sherlock’s gesture of creating them a joint blog.
Just as he hit send John heard her slide into the booth with him anyway. He looked up and sighed, this really wasn’t how he wanted to spend his evening.
Sherlock then found himself picking out gifts as they wandered from shop to shop. Willa (and John) were correct. There were very few people in his life that he cared to make happy and if buying them a few gifts a couple times a year did that it wasn’t like it was exactly a drain on his accounts. By the time an hour had passed he had found something for everyone, including Willa though he decided it would be best to brave the crowds the following day to get it.
Sherlock stood this time and when John leaned forward to stand he found himself nearly face first in Sherlock’s lap.
John found the pub and located a quiet corner where he could still see the telly. The pint was nice and the burger was decent but he still found himself texting Sherlock. He decided sending him a photo of proof that he was eating wasn’t terribly pathetic. Willa had asked if he was eating after all.
Then he leaned up and pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s lips. It was warmer than last night’s kiss and sweeter too.
John grinned at the text and Sherlock’s teasing, at least he was working under the assumption it was a tease.
“The fire?” Mycroft asked, feeling annoyed that he hadn’t stayed awake long enough to discover what the ruling had been.
The next day John allowed her to skip school, mostly because he didn’t think Mr. West would appreciate the giant ball of sulk Willa would turn into if she learned John was going to meet the baby without her.
As the car slowed John’s head snapped up and his arm made an aborted move towards his back. He relaxed after making eye contact with the driver. He was still used to Mycroft’s employees.
“I was thinking.” John said after Sherlock had risen, gone around to his side and gotten under the covers.
Sherlock managed to remain polite throughout their late lunch and continuously nauseating small talk. He didn’t even snap at the man across from them on the train who kept popping his chewing gum on their ride home. He managed to keep everything calm and normal until they’d fed, bathed and put Rosie into her bed.
He wanted to reassure John that they’d find her soon, that everything would be alright again and as soon as she was home they’d take a new photo of the three of them for his mobile.
Chelsea was on the other side of London from their house but Greg hadn’t chosen the Mercedes just for fun. He pushed the engine over 200 KMH safe in the knowledge that no one would ever pull this particular vehicle over.
Sherlock was still standing, watching Willa with a soft look on his face. John leaned over the arm of the seat and tugged on the sleeve of his Belstaff to get him to move.
“He’s a pure bread blue point Siamese. He’s already been neutered and had his first shots, he’s litter trained. His parents have excellent health histories as do all of their litters, so he’s likely to live until she’s sixteen or even longer. They’re a very intelligent breed, playful, and they don’t shed a lot.” Sherlock argued quickly like he was afraid to let John speak.
Lestrade was of course, still there, toiling away late into the night over the eight murders. “Alright and I care why?”
John considered the plan quietly for a moment, he still desperately wanted to rage against the idea of leaving Willa with Mary but there was no better way. “You will watch very closely tomorrow and if she does anything and I mean
Sherlock slid to the floor with her still in his arms. John followed them to the floor and crawled towards them.
“She’s such a pretty girl your daughter. Do you think the elder Holmes has managed to truly keep her safe? Or is mummy dearest still watching over her?”
Willa didn’t want to drink, she didn’t know who this woman was, but her mouth was so dry and her head hurt. The woman didn’t seem bad, she was talking soft and was trying to make Willa feel better. Her hands were even gentle as she helped Willa sit up so she could drink properly.
He also knew John would never agree to it. John wanted her to have peer interactions, to learn how to mingle with those of different intelligence levels without being arrogant.
Harry looked down at the photo. It was older and the woman had her hair pulled only partially up but it was definitely the same woman. “Yes… wait, hold on, I’ve seen that photo before.” But before she could look at it any longer Sherlock handed the phone to John.
Still, when Lestrade returned twenty-one minutes later, he was juggling five cups of coffee. He had a bag stuck between his teeth too.
Sherlock followed her into the hall and John strained to hear her feet on the stairs, a knock and then the door open.
“No,” John interrupted before Sherlock had a chance to assure him that wasn’t true at all. “No,” he repeated, softer this time, “give me someone to fight, or shoot at, or run after and then I’ll be helpful.”
There were a few more people in Regent’s park, mostly family out enjoying a walk together. There were a few people, Sherlock noted, making their way home undoubtedly from a night of sex. Sherlock nudged John and pointed out one such man.
He was one of the lucky ones. Noticed early on in basic for his steady aim and true shot. They’d sent him off for sniper training where he earned some of the highest marks. He’d been so ridiculously proud to call home and tell his mother all about his budding skills as a marksman. He’d been only a fraction less proud two years later sweating his way through the Afghan desert in full armor.
A particularly young DS had asked them to write up a list of any people who might wish to harm them. This had gotten Sherlock’s attention from whatever argument he’d been having with Irene. He’d just stared at the boy like he’d lost his mind, speechless by his stupidity.
Harry quickly decided to tell them the truth about that, after all Sherlock would be able to tell if she were lying to them. That would only make him suspicious of her.
It took less than a minute for her pulse to drop from a less concerning level but John kept making her breathe. After five minutes her eyes began dropping and John stopped counting out her breaths for her. Another five minutes and she was asleep, still in Sherlock’s lap on the floor.
If I don't update tomorrow before 8:30 EST I doubt I will be updating before Tuesday. I will no doubt need time to process.
Jessica continued to read from the file she was holding, this time it truly was an entire file. “But since January of 2012, she has been in semi-regular communication with a mobile phone from Santa Clara, California.”
“Daddy doesn’t like Christmas either.” Willa said as they passed a pile of jumpers. Sherlock smirked knowing the association she had made, perhaps subconsciously.
Not that a sex weekend with John hadn’t been splendid but there was a sense of calm he felt with Willa in his arms and John standing next to him. It was something he hadn’t noticed before now.
“Sherlock this is Luke Cooper.” John introduced once he’d finally let go of Luke’s hand. “Luke, Sherlock Holmes.”
John sat straighter in the chair, Sherlock was still leaning over him, and he grabbed for his narrow hips and pulled until the other man’s knees gave. He slid to the floor between John’s legs, hands resting on his thighs.
But once again, the lack of clues was drawing him in making him doubt that this wasn’t just a random thing. The entire building had been emptied, for several days it appeared judging by the amount of dust that had settled in the rooms on the lower floors. An abandoned building of this size would certainly have been a homeless camp.
John stepped in after her. “At the restaurant, someone attacked Harry and took Willa.” He cursed himself for the tremor in his own voice.
Willa tore her attention from the book and looked past John at Sherlock. She climbed off her chair and stood next to John. John nudged her shoulder forward. “Introduce yourself, love.”
Sherlock made a distressed noise and then buried his entire face in the spot. “You should really stop getting hurt.”
Things went on very much the same as they had been for the next few weeks. There was more physical contact but it was hard to determine if things had been naturally building up to this level of casual touching or if it was directly related to their conversation.
“Oh yes. Sorry, I found it up here. I thought I’d taken it down with me last year.” John apologized, holding up the book.
John woke to the sound of someone shouting. It was the kind of wakeup call that had him on his feet in seconds, he ran from the bedroom into the living room just in time to hear the front door slam. Then his mobile began ringing.
“Neurology will do an exam but you know it’s the only option in terms of pain management.” Doctor Treyford said and then he looked over at Sherlock and quickly added. “Of course you and your partner can be with her the entire time.”
They were so perversely obsessed with one another. The constant need to outwit, outdo, and even out speak one another. It seemed like a lifetime ago, the first time they’d met, John had mistaken that obsession for lust, for attraction, and not just the compulsive need to always be right.
John shook his head. His birthday was at the end of the month and one of the three yearly occasions he and Harry interacted. Harry came for dinner on Willa’s birthday, they went out for John’s and Harry picked either at her flat or out for her birthday. Fortunately or unfortunately all of their birthdays fell between January and June. So while he had to see her three times in six months he also got a six month reprieve from her.
“No, I need to go tell Mrs. Hudson. No one’s told her.” John said and he sounded distant. “She doesn’t even know yet.” He repeated, his voice cracking.
John was dressed for bed in pants and a vest, his hair mussed by the sixty minutes of tossing and turning.
“Not so fun is it?” John grumbled under his breath before shaking her again. “Come on Willa, we’ve got to get ready.”
“Right. Next for me then. Drugs. I know you’re clean now but I won’t ever tolerate her seeing you high. The same rule applies for you as it does for Harry, I will kick you out on your arse.” John looked him in the eyes as he spoke. Sherlock could tell he wasn’t bluffing, he really would throw him out.
“Breathe, Sherlock.” Mycroft said tersely. Sherlock hadn’t even been aware he was hyperventilating until he drew attention to it. “Mrs. Hudson still owns the building, she had hip replacement surgery over the summer and the doctors are impressed with her recovery.”
Mycroft called over again this time sounding exasperated. “If she is my niece, would that not make you my brother?”
Sherlock was the one to pull back although he seemed reluctant about it, one hand was gripping John’s coat at his side. “Not going to hit me this time?” He tried to joke but his voice was terribly unsteady.
Sherlock was awkwardly trying to avoid shaking the man’s hand (at least he’d noticed) when John’s phone began ringing. His heart did a funny thing where it simultaneously rose in his throat, fluttering like a panicked bird, and sank into his stomach like a stone. He tried to ignore the feeling as he switched the carrier in his hands and went fumbling into his pocket to get it.
“It was probably fatal long before Erik even thought to take him off the pump.” Sherlock concluded. “We need to test the pump to be sure. He wouldn’t have been buried with it.”
Willa nodded. “Yes, the machine didn’t have Dr. Pepper and it only gave us one bottle so we had to buy two” She pouted slightly at her misfortune.
“Now that that nonsense is settled.” Mycroft said drawing both Sherlock and John’s attention to him. “We have another matter to discuss. Brother dear you cannot go on with your current… living arrangement.”
Irene let out a laugh, it was fake and overly dramatic. “Oh Sherlock you misunderstand me, it isn’t Mummy Mary I’m interested in. The woman with the most power, right now? It isn’t her and it isn’t me.”
Sherlock was about to throw himself on the sofa when the stairs up to Willa’s room caught his attention. Despite having been living in the flat for nearly two weeks he hadn’t ever been up to her room. He could remember exactly what it had looked like when it had been John’s, down to the titles of the books he’d kept on his nightstand.
Mrs. Hudson, unable to attend the first day due to her hip surgery, had plaited Willa’s hair and insisted on dozens of photos before she let them out of the house. John wasn’t exactly surprised when he opened the front door to find a black limousine parked out front.
Sherlock looked up, unshed tears shining in his eyes. “They... they cut her hair,” he told John after a while. “Probably so she wouldn’t match the pictures that we have of her.”
“Gregory has decided to apply for majority custody. She’s digging in her heals, of course, so there must be a hearing.” Mycroft explained.
Willa was seven months old when one of Mycroft’s agents finally managed to snap a photo of Mary strolling through a South American market.
In reality he knew exactly where the described book was and it wasn’t in their bedroom. He just needed Sherlock out of the room so he could reassure Willa he’d gotten Sherlock’s birthday cookie.
to speak to Mr. Wolfe. TShe police had pegged him as their murderer as soon as the hospital had called them. Their biases were leaking through into their investigation left and right.
John grinned broadly and reached forward grabbing Sherlock’s hands and yanking him forward off his chair. Sherlock barely had time to settle his knees beneath him before John was tilting the detectives chin up towards him and pressing their lips together. They kissed until Sherlock was dizzy and panting from both the fact they were kissing, finally
“I do hope you don’t mind but I know that you aren’t fond of the pushchair you’ve gotten for Theodore.” Mycroft said and gestured towards the pram.
John sighed after a moment, his hand stilling. “Alright, you can ask her tomorrow if she’d like to stay home. You two can make her cupcakes or something.” John relented.
“Then don’t say anything to him until I tell you.” John instructed her as he was pulling out his phone.
Mycroft passed it to him. “Now, Detective Inspector, I would suggest sending one of your sergeants after Mr. Turner. I have it on good authority your husband would like to see you sometime this week.”
“He looks… healthy.” Sherlock said in an attempt to complement Molly on her new baby. John wondered if Sherlock had ever interacted with an infant so young before.
Barely twenty-five minutes had passed when the sound of something shattering upstairs drew Sherlock’s attention from the newspaper archives. He flew up the stairs not even seconds later. Willa was sitting in the hall with something shattered at her feet.
“You’re not wrong.” John said finally. “It’s not that I don’t want to, I do. God, I want to so badly but I can’t… we can’t.”
John needed to listen though because he was certain Sherlock would never open up to anyone else this way. So he drank a little more to keep his courage whereas the other man seemed to need less as he told his story.
“Well I do hope you’ve managed to bring us something useful,” he bemoaned finally sliding the memory stick into the computer.
John made a noise in the kitchen. “You can tell her to go away. I won’t be offended.” He called to Sherlock.
John had shaken his head before realizing that Mycroft couldn’t see him, well probably couldn’t. “No. I didn’t want to put Willa in care after Mary so I just figured it would be best if I didn’t look a gift horse in the mouth. Jesus Mycroft that’s more than I’d make full time at the surgery. Why the hell did he need a flat mate?”
Sherlock shrugged and leaned forward to steal a piece of the pepper John was chopping. “Valentine’s day is meant to be romantic. I would not be opposed to spending some time alone without Willa overhead.”
She reminded him of Sherlock at that age, perhaps because he’d had little to do with any other babies. Even then, when Mycroft was eight and found his little brother mostly tiresome, a giggle from the little boy had always managed to coax a smile onto his face.
“Lately I’ve been happier than I’ve been in a long time.” Sherlock confessed. “You’re to blame for that, John. You
For eighteen months they ran back to back successful missions until the day their luck caught up with them. Three men died and Cole had taken two bullets to the gut. He’d nearly died on the way to the hospital and then again during the surgery to remove the bullet that hadn’t passed through him. He’d been shipped out to Germany to recover until he was well enough to be sent stateside.
John noticed that Sherlock was standing in front of Willa, he nodded at him and then Sherlock stepped aside. Willa was oblivious to it all, still playing on Sherlock’s phone.
Willa looked almost relieved when Sherlock told her they would spend the morning away from the flat as she came downstairs. John wasn’t up yet so Sherlock left him not only a note on the refrigerator but sent a text telling him they’d be out. He didn’t need to upset John any further.
“That means you’ll have to be case free for three days.” John paused what he was doing and amended. “Well no major cases, anyway.”
John turned to look at Sherlock in disbelief. The other man was staring so intensely at the book that John was surprised it hadn’t caught fire yet.
“How would you feel if it were Addison?” Molly’s voice was quiet but her words seemed to ring in the hall. It was a low blow but she could see the exact moment that it worked.
Happy New Year everyone! I'm seriously hoping 2017 is a shitton better than 2016. I wrote this chapter while waiting for midnight.
“When we first met you said it was your friend.” John explained. Sherlock glanced up and saw that the other man had a faraway look on his face. “Mycroft had already rescued your violin. So I kept him because of what you said I think.”
Molly arrived with a canvas bag full of god knows what. “I can’t stay in that house too long. He’s so nervous he spent six hours arranging the clothes yesterday. Six!”
John growled, his hands flying up and catching Sherlock’s shoulders. He pulled him down until he could slide his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and then tugged him firmly up towards his face.
Willa noticed a man standing in the corner of the room looking out the window. His back was to them and Willa saw a gun sticking out of the back of his trousers. She must have made a noise because the woman shushed her and held the cup back up to her mouth.
“Of course you do, lovely, that’s very nice of you.” Harry said and awkwardly patted Willa on the back. She let the subject drop then but the look she gave John warned that their conversation wasn’t over.
“You can stay up until midnight if you don’t fall asleep first.” John agreed, so far she’d never made it.
“But you’ve seen him then?” John asked, one hand on top of Willa’s head as she sat at the kitchen table playing with the matryoshka dolls Mycroft had brought back for her.
Mycroft was lounging on the sofa in the library, his very worn copy of ‘The Murder of Roger Ackroyd’ in hand. Gregory was at the other end of the sofa with his laptop balanced on his knees, their legs were entwined in the middle beneath a blanket. Gregory was absentmindedly brushing one of his feet along the outside of Mycroft’s thigh.
“Yes.” John answered without hesitation, Willa beamed. There was no doubt in his mind that Sherlock would turn down the opportunity to adopt Willa, even though it hadn’t quiet been six months since he came back.
“Hello, lovely, are you alright?” The woman asked and she leaned over so Willa could see her without moving her head.
“Sherlock, he was in school this morning.” John hissed after he’d thanked the parents for their help.
The last of the snow had finally melted in London when Mycroft took a trip to Russia. John had only realized the trip was happening because Greg came over more often when Mycroft left, still uncomfortable alone in the sprawling house.
After a few weeks he began to get the distinct feeling that the reason for such a mixed team was that the missions they were running were a little less than approved. He didn’t care though, everything seemed to be for the right reason. Moran never questioned the orders either.
“Sherlock…” John started, about to point out the flaws in that plan, but another frustrated growl ripped from the detective’s throat.
He wasn’t even sure what had made him turn and look at the building, after all they’d just spent nearly an hour inside and Sherlock hadn’t come up with much. Maybe that was what made him look back, he couldn’t stand watching Sherlock both literally and figuratively spinning in circles in some alley.
Willa was still watching Sherlock from the floor. “Why’d you do that?” She ask quietly after a moment.
Willa wanted to throw it, or dump it, anything but take it but she was sure they had more. Probably even more shots so she realized there was really no choice. She drank quickly, trying to ignore the grit as it passed over her tongue.
“I couldn’t find the book.” Sherlock informed John as he got to the room. Crossing his arms over his chest.
Mycroft shook his head, and for a second, even in the presence of company, he looked sad. "You may go, Jessica," Mycroft said finally.
The sound of something shattering only vaguely permeated the thick cloud of fog that had taken up residence in John’s head but he ignored it. He couldn’t be arsed to give a damn about things breaking. Not when his entire world had begun to crumble.
when he felt her hummingbird heart slamming against his hands as he tried to hold her still. He hadn’t meant to shout but she wasn’t listening to either of them. John either hadn’t noticed or didn’t care, it was what finally caught her attention after all.
"How many people have you killed?" Janine snapped, and the bed near Willa's feet bounced. "Were they all soldiers?"
“Yes. It’s mostly been small articles and of course they caught wind of your help with the Soda Slayer case.” John explained.
John spoke to the doctor some more while Sherlock continued to hold Willa. There was a knot in his gut as he listened to them.
They didn’t question when John pulled the boys medical chart from the wall and began looking through it.
“Two hundred and fifty pounds.” John repeated back to the woman in shock, even as Sherlock was handing her a credit card.
“Precisely. You’ve not updated your blog in over five years, mine’s been inactive even longer but we’ll need something now that we’re taking cases again.” Sherlock told him and then turned around the laptop so he could see.
Happy holidays everyone! I desperately wanted to write a Christmas themed chapter but Christmas in the story is a few chapters away :(
Shhh, in my head the tucking in of Willa scene was reminiscent of the scene from the 1982 Annie. Sue me I can't help the fluff sometimes.
By dessert Sherlock realized they were certainly on a date. He’d seen John Watson the lover in action years ago and recognized the treatment. It thrilled him immensely.
That wasn’t to say he tolerated use in the slightest. He’d been so angry and disappointed when he found out Sherlock was using after their wedding. His words had done more damage than Molly’s slaps.
There’d even been dates. They never called them that but what else could it have been when John arranged a sitter and took Sherlock out on Valentine’s day. Sherlock might have generally ignored society’s inane holidays but he knew John paid them heed.
The coffee helped distract him from the oppressive silence and the feeling of uselessness for a while but eventually, the cup was empty. No sooner had he drained the cup, though, did the feelings crawl back up into his throat. He couldn't help but think of John and Sherlock wandering London all night looking for their daughter. He loved Willa immensely but knew whatever he was feeling now, John and Sherlock were going through it tenfold. He didn't even know what he'd do if it were Addy out there missing.
There was something electric about being in the same room as Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler. It was electric, the kind of electricity that you could feel halfway across the room as it raised your hair and made your veins tingle. It was the kind of electricity that set John’s nerves on edge and left him with the itch to punch something,
He learned that week that John wasn’t lying when he said he’d use Willa to get Sherlock to eat and sleep. John sent her down to tell him when it was supper time because he knew Sherlock had trouble telling her he wasn’t hungry, worried about the kind of example he was setting her.
John laughed and replaced the photo on the shelf. “They’re surprisingly good for each other. It was weird as hell at first but it’s good.”
Sherlock stared intently at John’s condemning finger. “I believe that might be due to the ‘shots for warmth’ and those were your idea.” He reminded John but rolled over to climb out of bed anyway.
The sequel is coming but it's going to be a bit more angsty? badassy? than this. It's also going to change POV a whole lot more than just from John to Sherlock and back.
“Yes, she may call.” Sherlock then proceeded to drag John from the room leaving him to shout his goodbyes.
Also I was setting it up to be a bike accident but I just could NOT do that to Sherlock since it would have happened at home. So she did exactly what one of my children did and knocked herself silly on the playground. So this is medically accurate in terms of what happened with that which might not apply elsewhere in the world. *shrug*
“Lamb, Mycroft? Isn’t that a bit sacrilegious?” Sherlock asked as they entered the dining room for lunch. John had to agree, then again, he’d been raised in a household under C and E rule.
Once Janine had finished with the dye she and Cole had gone to the other room, Willa caught a glimpse of the gun Cole carried tucked into the back of his trousers. She sat by herself for forever, still perched on top of the toilet lid. When they began talking again, she cautiously got up, seemingly forgotten for the moment. She took her chance to inspect the room she’d been left in.
John shook his head. “No, he’s busy in court today, he’ll be home later though and I bet he’ll be excited to see you’re arm.”
He nodded and stood. As he brushed by John the other man grabbed his wrist. “I’m sorry for being an arse.”
John laughed and reached under Sherlock, pulling the bottle out. He pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock’s forehead and moved down, once again between his thighs.
John thanked deities he didn’t believe in that Sherlock still refused to wear a vest as he climbed on the bed, knees on either side of Sherlock’s hips. “All this time and I haven’t, I could have but I haven’t.” John lamented leaning down to brush a kiss onto Sherlock’s lips. “All that wasted time.”
“She fell on the playground, we’ve had to send her to A and E in an ambulance.” Drescher admitted after only a second of hesitation.
There was a police scanner built into every single one of their cars and this fact allowed him to slide into the Mercedes coupe they rarely used. Greg often suspected that the scanners would pick up a lot more than the Scotland Yard channels if he knew what codes to push in but right now all he needed was the London emergency channels.
“Didn’t want it.” Lestrade said simply. “I already don’t see my family enough. Going any higher wouldn’t make that better. I’m happy where I am.”
“I feel like I’m walking a thin line between asking you to do too much and insulting you by not asking for help. I’m always worried about overstepping my bounds in this with everyone and it’s no different with you.” John explained taking a sip of his drink.
Sherlock was in court over the Wolfe case, something he hated immensely but John couldn’t do for him. So he’d taken Willa on his own.
Janine saw this. “Yes, that’s right. You need to be good and that means no more questions. Do you understand now?”
“Because this concerns your daughter and you would kill for her.” Mycroft leaned forward and turned on a small intercom.
“There you are love.” The woman said and then she slid her hand away. “That wasn’t too much was it? Angie’ll kill us if we hurt her.”
But there was a dark cloud over his head, one he wasn’t willing to share with Sherlock because he didn’t want to dampen the utter joy the other man was feeling lately. There would be a time, somewhere in the near future where he would have to tell him but now it wasn’t necessary. For now, though, he would bare this on his own.
As he replaced the pages he surreptitiously took stock of the room. A camera wouldn’t have been odd in an infant or toddler room but Willa was nearly six, plus John had confessed to there being a motion detector on the camera as well. There were also bars on the windows and yet there were motion detectors on those, no doubt if he opened a window a security firm would be alerted. There were more security measures in this one room than there were in the rest of the house.
John had assumed it was Sherlock’s unfamiliarity with living with an infant that had him jumping like that, or perhaps he simply didn’t like the crying.
John nodded. “I’m fine it’s just, you don’t expect a six year old to die. At least not one you know.”
He managed to sit still for approximately another two minutes before the urge to do something overwhelmed him. So he stood up from the chair and walked over to Mycroft who was once again wholly immersed in his devices. Despite seemingly being in his own world Mycroft tensed when Greg walked around the desk, but that was the only indication he gave of being aware.
John held out the tray to her teacher. “Why yes you have.” Mr. West said sounding genuinely thrilled at the idea. The notion of feeding twenty first years cupcakes would have caused John to run in another direction.
No sooner had Mycroft put down the mobile he'd been talking on than one of his assistants knocked at the door. Seemingly, becoming aware of himself Mycroft settle himself into his seat behind the desk before calling the person is.
as Willa had said. Yes, he and John had once had that very abstract conversation about more children but it had never gone beyond that.
“Make extra cupcakes for her birthday dinner.” John instructed as he settled back down into the bed, drawing his hand from Sherlock’s face.
Luck, or maybe not, had been on Cole’s side once again. Not a single person had spotted him as he carried the girl’s body to the river bank.
Mycroft outwardly appeared unconcerned by John’s aggressive movements, though Sherlock knew his brother well enough to know when he was worried. It was Lestrade who sat up straighter, mouth drawn into a line. Sherlock was loathed to admit it but it was clear the detective was prepared to defend his husband, even from one of his oldest friends, and that was… not nothing.
Sherlock watched her closely as she walked to stand directly in front of him. She jutted out her chin and extended a brightly colored hand towards him. “Hello, I’m Willa.”
Mycroft and Greg moved at the same time, reaching out to take the present from Mrs. Hudson. John would wonder later that night how much Greg knew about the situation. John had never really told him much but still he seemed to have most of the story.
