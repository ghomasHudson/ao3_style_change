That was the truth, after all, but he omitted just enough so that he wouldn’t get Dean into trouble. Mentioning that he had been in contact with a hunter didn’t seem pertinent anyway. Apart from the fact that the bunker might have played a role in dampening any attempts at contacting him telepathically. But that might also have been due to his low power levels, so not worth mentioning, either.
“Uhm… So, what does the book say?” Cas asked. Maybe that’s why Dean had gone to all the trouble of cooking that delicious meal for him. All for their pup’s sake.
It didn’t take long until Dean filled him up thoroughly, pumping his hot seed deep into his womb. At that point, the alpha was basically the one holding Cas in presenting position because he really couldn’t keep his ass up by himself.
Then it all happened at the same time. The teeth had a real tight grip on his mating gland, the alpha’s cock hit
Of course, they did some scenting before bed and for once, Dean didn’t leave. For once, Cas got exactly what he wanted.
Castiel inhaled one last time before leaving. He couldn’t wait for Gabe to organize something for him to scent.
“So, turns out I killed her on the autumnal equinox or some shit like that, and now she’s tethered to this realm,” Dean finished his story.
that Castiel better not think about molesting him in his sleep.) But his subconscious didn’t understand why he wasn’t allowed to snuggle up to his mate, and Castiel had always been a cuddly sleeper.
“I ran across some alphas,” Cas mumbled. “And one of them might have been about to go into rut or coming off a rut…” He trailed off and then quickly got out, “I can’t stand the scent of rut.”
Seeing the omega whose scent he had been infatuated with had, of course, jump-started his rut. Luckily, Cas was spontaneous enough and agreed to come by tonight.
There was no way for Cas to explain this one away, and in a way, he had knowingly taken that risk the second he had encouraged the scenting.
was in heat now, not his game character, so Impala could fuck his omega all he wanted, it would make no difference.
Yeah. That was his outdoorsy personality coming through. He had heard variations thereof when other people described his scent.
Google quickly suggested some threads where alphas asked all kinds of stupid questions like ‘Is it alphasexual to mate another alpha?’
Huh. Dean kind of liked the idea that his pup wanted him around. He also kind of liked the idea of having
“So, you’re saying that you don’t feel any… mating bond between us?” Castiel asked. “Because you’re the one who came to
“Why didn’t you tell me about Balthazar?” Anna asked. “I would have come sooner. You must be starved.” Before Cas could answer, she leaned back a bit, her hands still holding on to his shoulders, to look him up and down. Then she added, “You don’t look starved. You look
Trying to have that craving sated, he started riding Dean, angling this way and that until he found what he was looking for and couldn’t hold the sounds of pleasure in anymore.
sex shop was the only one where he could get the slick he needed. That really might be sharing too much with his little brother. And while scarring him for life was kind of his job, Dean didn’t want to subject himself to the teasing he might have to endure if he fessed up to the fact that he sort of had a crush on an omega’s slick scent.
“Need someone to carry the stuff, huh?” Dean asked, but he was just teasing. Cas could use him for his alpha strength all he wanted. It actually made his alpha kind of proud, knowing that he was needed.
So, Cas nudged him and raised his eyebrows at him. His ten minutes were almost up and he really hoped they could do this again. He hoped he could afford Dean’s prices.
Peeking out from behind the pedestal, Castiel watched Hannah take out her witch blade. Surely she had to know that it would be of no use. She couldn’t hurt the witch ghost with it.
service?! What kind of a doctor recommended an alpha service to a pregnant omega? Dean grit his teeth, but stayed silent.
The third time they had sex, they ended up sixty-nining until they came down each other’s throats simultaneously. That time didn’t count for obvious reasons.
He had no idea if they were even scent-compatible. He’d have to wait for Cas’ reaction to his scent to figure that out. Just because
“Why wouldn’t I be?” Jimmy asked, squinting at him. “I just successfully seduced the alpha I’m in love with.”
As soon as they had taken in the scents of each other and both their alpha and omega weren’t as scent-starved anymore, the nibbling began.
?” Dean forgot for a second that he was supposed to get rid of Cas as fast as possible so that he could get dressed (no way was he going to finish that jerk-off session after that disruption).
No more pretending. No more applying that awful alpha scent. He was free to do with his life what he wanted now.
“Oh.” Cas finally seemed to catch up to where Dean was in this conversation. “So… If we both enjoyed the kissing, and we both have the feelings that make us want to do more of the kissing…”
That seemed to do the trick. Jimmy showed him his teeth—which seemed more like an awkward smile, but it was a start. Dean definitely had his work cut out for him since Jimmy had to be the most harmless alpha in the world.
Dean’s cock twitched at that and the alpha let out a broken moan before he gently pushed Cas off his dick, probably because he was too sensitive at that point.
This situation was slipping away from him fast. He just wanted to nibble on Jimmy’s neck a bit, what was the big deal? Maybe kiss him again. Just make him feel good. If Jimmy ended up submitting to him again—then all the better.
. I don’t think it’s any different for cuddlibi.”): Some might be okay with having sex. Boundaries varied from person to person.
There was no immediate answer, so Dean looked over at Cas. The omega wasn’t meeting his eyes, though, and unfortunately, Dean had to look back at the road.
“Don’t worry,” Dean said. He had probably picked up on Castiel’s despondent mood. No wonder, Dean was able to smell changes in his scent, after all. “My brother’s the best. You’ll have your sense of smell back in no time.”
So, he just started fucking the fleshlight frantically. He could almost imagine being buried balls deep in the omega who had provided the slick, even though the image was blurry in his mind due to the fact that he had no idea what he actually looked like.
Since he couldn’t get enough of it, he licked over the tip of Dean’s spent dick to get at least some of the taste.
Deciding to take a chance, Dean just went for it. He hesitantly moved his own head closer to Cas’ neck, and when the omega didn’t pull away, he carefully nosed along his scent gland.
“You are not my only charge,” Cas replied. “I don’t sit around thinking about you all day.” There was a strange edge to his voice, and Dean had the distant feeling that he might not want to push the angel’s buttons too much.
Then, when he was sure he was the epitome of cool and collected, he asked offhandedly, “Hey, here’s a question. Do cuddlibi in a cuddle relationship… I mean, does that include other stuff?”
The alphas online had been right. It definitely helped fool his alpha, who calmed down, satisfied to have tried his best to fertilize an omega.
“Nah, I think you’re perfectly reasonable. Don’t worry ’bout it.” Given the choice between a place without a scent and a place with one, however faint, anyone would feel safer where the world wasn’t completely scentless.
“I already took it,” Castiel said, trying to act as if he didn’t care deeply about Dean. Maybe he hadn’t thought this plan all the way through. If he had to act this way around Dean all the time, his heart would always feel like it was incarcerated.
Castiel licked his lips. Those were some XXL knot condoms. Of course, there had been no question as to whether Castiel would get knotted. You made plans to have sex with an alpha in rut, you were better prepared to spend quite some time hanging off his knot. Still, the thought of Dean’s big dick locked inside of him made his ass slick, and he hurried to finally get into presenting position on Dean’s bed.
Okay, so, Dean wasn’t great at relationships. His track record was… well, it wasn’t good, let’s just leave it at that. On top of that, after his own childhood experiences, he had never thought he wanted pups of his own and mess up their lives.
Right now, the mighty Angel of the Lord was all cuddled up against him, seeking those touches any omega in heat craved. Dean was more than willing to provide them.
“Great! It was just about to go down,” Dean grumbled. “You only have yourself to thank if you’re stuck on my knot for a while longer.”
“What about fucking your slick providers?” the alpha asked with a low voice that did things to Castiel’s insides. The alpha didn’t even look in Gabe’s direction, but raised his eyebrows at Castiel instead, who ignored Gabe’s spluttered, “What? No!” to bare his throat further.
Cas ignored him for the moment and, glancing down at his own rumpled clothes, decided that he wasn’t really presentable, but if his neighbors were inconsiderate enough to be banging on his door at the crack of dawn, they would have to accept some sloppiness.
He pushed in, just the tip, and Cas was going wild beneath him. This was the first time a cock breached him, and Dean’s alpha was very content that
It wasn’t until the next day during breakfast that Cas brought up their failed attempt at getting mated by telling him, “I’m not having second thoughts.”
So yes, with his hormones all over the place, he should have seen it coming. The way kissing Dean never failed to make his insides tingle, the way he couldn’t look away when Dean was staring him in the eyes…
account. And if someone is trying to attack you, I’d hope you wouldn’t be too polite to bare your teeth at them, either.”
“I just wanted you to be happy,” he said. “And I’m your cupid; I should let you find that happiness with your designated omega.” Fallen angel or not, Anna was a
This time was different. Not that last time hadn’t been intimate—the fact that Dean’s touches had sent him into heat was proof of that—but this time, they were at Dean’s and Cas could get comfortable on the bed (which offered more space than the couch).
“Yes, really!” Castiel retorted, letting some of his real anger creep into his voice, committed to the lie now. If he weren’t so enraged, he would probably remember that you didn’t talk back at Zachariah.
Finally, Cas started breathing him in, taking little sniffs at first and then, when the trembling began to subside, deeper ones.
Maybe he wasn’t so rational after all. Maybe he was weak, and saying no to being in Dean’s arms was simply impossible. No wonder—it was where he felt safest in the world.
Dean had never had heat sex before and he came from a long line of alphas, so he had to give Charlie that one.
Yes, it was, thank you very much. Although with Jimmy, he shouldn’t be surprised that he’d have to get more specific, so he made another attempt, “How’s that going? You scentin’ each other?”
Cas was watching what he was doing intently, head titled slightly as if he was fascinated by it. If not for the overpowering scent of slick, Dean would think he was watching more out of scientific curiosity than actual arousal on his part. Luckily, he
And that was seemingly too much teasing or maybe it had been too crass for the angel’s sensibilities. In any case, Cas did what he usually did when he felt uncomfortable: fly away. And here Dean had considered sharing his burger with Cas. Oh well, more for him to eat.
Cas looked at him all serious and—oh no! Were his eyes starting to water? Making Cas sad had so not been his intention. On top of that, he didn’t really know how to deal with crying omegas. Or, well, crying people in general, really. Luckily, no tears actually came out.
Anyway, they’d grown accustomed to being in each other’s space to the point where knees touching was not something done by accident, but rather a calculated move designed to get the other one to forfeit. However, most of the time, neither of them gave in, which resulted in a lot of touching and invading each other’s personal space.
hunters going around killing witches in the vicinity of their sleepy little town were not very high. But if he just ratted Dean out, the alpha might have to endure worse curses than the one he was already under.
Somehow, his hands started stroking the alpha’s naked skin of their own accord. Oh yes, Castiel was absolutely ready to help out this needy alpha in rut. He’d let him use his omega in any way he wanted. If that meant he wouldn’t be able to sit comfortably for days to come, all the better.
Cas should probably say something. Tell Dean that he was wrong and what was really going on. Or he could
It was meant as a joke to lighten the mood and distract from the fact that he’d been kind of a jerk, but Cas didn’t pick up on that and instead took the question seriously. “My brother is an assbutt.”
Would all his love for him just… vanish? It seemed impossible. How could he not love the way Dean cared about things? The way he laughed so goofily, the way he was always there for… everyone, helping others because that’s who he was—the most selfless human being he knew.
Disregarding his protests, the alpha insisted on dragging him to his favorite bar, so for the first time, they left Dean’s house together. Castiel offered to fly them there, but Dean refused since apparently, driving to the bar was half the fun.
But then Dean softly, almost tentatively grazed his mating gland with his thumb. Oh. Cas was ready for a mating bite. That was, in fact, the one thing missing from making this moment perfect.
Put on the spot like that, Dean didn’t know how to make this okay, so he finished, a bit lamely, “That comment was uncalled for. Sorry it made you puke.”
“I’m coming for a visit. So, now I did.” Then his nose twitched and his eyes snapped to Dean and narrowed to suspicious slits. “Did you scent-mark my brother?”
“Feelings and emotions. Gotcha.” Made sense that they’d feed on that part of it. In that case, Cas would have
At this point, Dean had become a pro at cuddling. All those cuddle positions Cas had taught him? He knew them all, and could effortlessly switch from one to another mid-cuddle.
He looked at Jimmy, who seemed apprehensive and said, his voice barely above a whisper, “Are you going to leave now?”
As a matter of fact, Cas had never even thought about the implications when he had agreed to extend their scentings to Dean staying the night. Dean hadn’t even done anything when he had been about to go into rut. That’s how much control Dean had over his alpha.
The second the words were out of his mouth and Dean hesitated, he wanted to take them back. He had to have terribly misunderstood.
Dean’s hands felt so nice on his skin, but at the same time, he couldn’t really enjoy them because he was too busy trying to think unsexy thoughts so that his ass would get the message that it wasn’t going to be fucked by the hot alpha.
And then he just went for it. Too drunk on Cas’ scent to think about the implications, he ducked back down and kissed around Cas’ scent gland, slowly making his way along his neck to his jawline and then further up until he could brush his lips oh so softly against Cas’.
In the typical gesture meant to convey that the omega was ready to be taken, Jimmy tilted his head further to the side while simultaneously opening his legs and raising his pelvis. Dean followed the invitation to slip his pants and boxers down, uncovering a beautiful cock that was already well on its way to full hardness.
‘Bother’ was a nice euphemism for ‘arouse.’ He was left ‘hot and bothered’ rather than just ‘bothered.’
That didn’t make any sense, so Cas squinted at him, trying to figure out the logic behind Dean’s statement.
Dean slipped out of him with a wet plopping sound and Cas could feel some of his seed run out of his hole.
When Cas’ nose nudged against his scent gland, Dean abruptly returned to reality and he quickly took a step back. He already hated himself for the moment of weakness because boy was he going to be fucking
Their eyes locked during the moment of penetration. Dean’s rut was really starting now, his eyes red with the need to fuck an omega, and then the alpha proceeded to do just that, pulling out and thrusting back inside with an animalistic growl, seeking out Castiel’s mouth with his own once more before he began fucking him for real.
‘Shortly after an omega’s heat’ was, apparently, relative, since it kept happening days and weeks after Castiel’s heat had ended. Castiel didn’t mind. If it were up to him, ‘shortly after an omega’s heat’ could last for months and years.
Castiel knew how to get Dean hot and bothered, too, of course, but thinking clearly was getting more difficult by the minute, as the only thing he could focus on was getting his alpha to mount him.
Cas took a deep breath and began, “When I was eight years old… I might have inadvertently hugged my grandma to death.”
Balthazar seemed placated by that public display of affection. But just to be sure, Castiel returned the favor and kissed Dean back.
There was a spot right next to his scent gland that—if Dean ‘accidentally’ blew on it—made Cas lose focus, unable to keep his train of thought.
So was Dean, but he kept that part to himself. Sure, he liked hanging with Cas and was in no hurry for their sessions to come to an end. But he also didn’t know if he could keep his… reactions to being scented by Cas under control if this went on too much longer.
That happiness didn’t last long, though, when Hannah untied the message from his leg and looked at it with a frown on her face that grew progressively deeper.
They would be able to ‘fake’ the bite of passion so much better now, even though Castiel wasn’t presenting and Dean wasn’t taking him from behind.
“Well, that was fun. We should do it again sometime,” he said, which was confirmation enough that he was okay.
. You’d be on your belly and I’d be on you and take you by the neck…” God, yes, that sounded just like what he wanted to do!
Plus, it was kind of fun to have another weapon he could use against Cas, to tease him, make him even more desperate while he was getting fucked. Dean certainly enjoyed the power rush it gave him, knowing he could make Cas come all over himself with a simple well-timed touch.
“There’s a hot spring nearby, very secluded, and behind the waterfall, there’s a secret cave with the most beautiful minerals that can store magic. Oh, and sometimes, if you’re very quiet, you can hear the magic sing in the cave’s walls…”
When he had reached the omega’s table, he had to keep himself from staring because—whoa!  That was one sexy omega. If he had met him in a bar, he’d have let him scent him for free. Seriously—easiest twenty bucks an hour,
If Dean picked up on anything, he didn’t mention it, though. Instead, he cradled the back of his neck in the palm of one hand before leaning in to give Cas’ mating gland an experimental lick.
Dean ignored all of that in favor of fucking Cas some more. The more the omega awakened these strange feelings inside of him, the harder he fucked his hole to chase them away. All he had to do is fuck them out of his system.
“We were hugging for one minute and twenty seconds,” Cas said, and of course the geek would have kept count of how long they’d been touching.
He had to know—he just had to, or else he’d go insane wondering about it once he was back home alone, so he asked, “You gonna call an alpha service?”
After the embarrassing incident, Castiel had made sure his head stayed on straight during their sessions.
Apart from hopelessly lusting after his scent-bond partner, having a fully developed scent bond with Cas also had its perks. For one, he didn’t have to stealthily scent-mark him anymore.
Such a shame that this was the end of the road for them. But for just this last moment on their way out of the MCAK headquarters, Castiel let their squabbling wash over him.
The next time Dean saw the lights on in Jimmy’s house in the middle of the night, he decided, after failing to fall back asleep, to just go over there. It was a Friday night anyway. If neither of them could sleep, they could at least not-sleep together.
Since Jimmy probably wouldn’t appreciate the insinuation if Dean invited him to an omega self-defense class, the plan was to go the gym after hours for Dean to give him private lessons.
He looked around for pen and paper, but Dean just chuckled and then distracted him by kissing him again.
He didn’t get to finish that thought because Cas held on to him and interrupted, “Please stay. This feels nice, doesn’t it?” He underlined that by tracing along the skin where he had just scented.
“I’m not hungry in the morning,” Cas declined, but he returned the hug nevertheless, even without feeding on the offered cuddles.
Which was okay. Perfectly fine. If Dean could sleep with an alpha even though he wasn’t alphasexual, then Cas could suck it up, too.
birthday came out of nowhere and brought with it a wave of self-doubt. Where had his thirties gone? Oh, that was right. He’d been focused on his career.
He fucked his fingers into him a few more times before he replaced them with something bigger. Castiel felt the tip of the alpha’s dick nudge against his hole, searching for the entrance to his body, and then the alpha pushed inside of him and he was being penetrated for real.
That’s why when he came home from work on the third day after buying the omega slick, he decided to test it out. It was only reasonable to give it a try, see if it did any good.  After all, if it didn’t, it would be better to know now before he’d end up almost rubbing his dick off during his rut again.
He had only taken a few steps towards it when he locked eyes with Dean, who was just coming out of the kitchen. The alpha next to him—the brother—was even taller than Dean and was looking at him curiously.
One thing had changed, though: Impala was more handsy with him now. Whenever they took a break on their hike north, he’d initiate a scenting, or when they stopped somewhere for the night, he’d rub his belly.
Dean’s nose bumped against the sensitive spot behind his ear in search for his scent gland, which sent every one of his nerve endings aflutter like usual.
That was true. This time was just for them. The only goal was their pleasure. Well, and getting Cas through his heat, of course.
bond, the most profound bond there was, and Dean couldn’t wait to start the rest of his life with Cas—as Cas’ mate.
What he had actually paid for was Dean knocking him up, but pointing out that technicality didn’t seem like the best idea. The last thing he wanted was for Dean to retract his offer.
Soon, all of the stimulation was too much for Cas’ omega to handle. He could almost feel Dean teasing his mating gland into secreting mating hormones and he was sure Dean had to have picked up on the change in scent.
Now, with the scent of his mate all around? There was no way his alpha would keep to his side of the bed if given the opportunity to get even closer to that scent.
While he could feel the scent around him slipping away since he wasn’t actively scenting Dean anymore, he still knew he was in the right place to hold on. He needed to stay right here, as close to Dean as possible.
He had stumbled upon the site by accident (if googling for it could be considered an accident) and he was curious by nature, which was how he had gotten into watching niche porn—namely porn featuring two alphas.
“Look, not everyone is accustomed to hardcore cuddling that doesn’t lead to anything, okay? For humans, kissing, and holding each other and shit… That’s pretty relationshippy. So I think my dick can be excused for being a bit unclear on what’s going on here.”
The alpha sighed in his sleep, but still no vision. (Although, annoyingly enough, he smelled delicious as always.)
He nodded in agreement and went over to the chair. There was something about him that was broken. An angel wasn’t supposed to go into heat. He wasn’t supposed to… feel. Whatever that devastating feeling deep in his chest was. He hoped with all his emotionless heart Uriel could get rid of it.
And then he had gotten all weird when Dean had told him he was planning on cuddling with Inias. Dean had assumed it was because Cas still had this idea that cuddling a cuddlibus could hurt him. But maybe there had been another reason…
“Oh.” He had forgotten for a second there. Cas’ neck looked so ready for another bite, he had simply wanted to give it a little nibble. “Not if I bite
Dean lay down next to him to keep him company. His hands were still glistening with lotion and the grin on his face should have warned Cas for what was to come, but Dean booped his nose, leaving a smear of lotion there.
I am ‘alert,’ you just woke me up. Give me that!” He made grabby hands for the phone until Cas finally handed it over.
One of Dean’s favorite parts (and secretly, Castiel’s too) was the moment he pushed his long cock into his ass. More often than not, he had Castiel on his back so that he could look right at him at the moment of penetration.
He sounded like he really meant it, and so Cas just enjoyed being in heat for once. They made out, let their hands roam over each other’s naked bodies, and all in all engaged in so much foreplay that Cas was starting to worry the nest would be soaked with his slick by the end of it.
It seemed like he had to come at it from another angle. “If the ghost comes back, you won’t be of much help. You know, since you are just a
That’s how Benny wound up playing the part of the alpha predator while Dean observed what Jimmy’s weak points were and gave instructions.
First he thought he could just tell Impala that the pining sickness was back, but with all the touching their game characters had been doing, Impala might figure out that it was a lie, which would be embarrassing to say the least.
Maybe that was because Dean was so casual about it, dropping by for an unannounced visit at his baby brother’s place, putting his feet up on the coffee table while taking a sip from the beer Sam had offered him.
That’s why he made sure that from then on, he applied an extra dosage of the scent before their training sessions (for fear that he’d get aroused around Dean) and took the alpha scent with him every time he went over to Dean’s, just in case he ended up spending more time there than planned and had to reapply it.
Dean made sure to shove every drop of his come deep into Cas’ channel where it belonged, thrusting a few more times until his knot finally locked inside.
Cas’ scent certainly hadn’t helped suppress those instincts. It turned sweet like honey when he was being cuddled and caressed. Not that Dean had
Again—not that he had to seduce him per se, but he might just do it anyway, just for the heck of it.
Then Dean said, “Oh hey, I’ll see you later, right? Looking forward to it,” with such a big, honest smile that there was really nothing Cas could say but, “Yes, me too.”
Cas made some sort of humming sound in response but didn’t seem bothered in the slightest that Dean was still basically lying on top of him.
At least it seemed like he had gotten through this night without giving them away or embarrassing Dean too much.
It was probably just because he knew he wouldn’t get to go back to Purgaytory in at least a few weeks. Too bad they didn’t have a club like that closer to home. Or maybe his rut was coming on…
Dean guessed that they were kind of a thing now? He wasn’t really sure since they hadn’t put a label on it. If nothing else, they were still scent-bond partners. But with the added benefit of doing ‘whatever Cas was comfortable with.’
“I thought you didn’t use ravens,” Dean said from below, distracting Castiel from unrolling the piece of paper.
Castiel couldn’t answer since he had to grit his teeth to keep still and not just fly away from those hands that had groomed him a million times. Probably more. Never had it felt this uncomfortable.
After a few more prayer attempts that went unanswered, Dean finally gave up. Maybe Cas had realized that he was going into heat and didn’t trust Dean to hold back if he came back down in his current state. Some part of Dean had to concede that he might be right about that.
Sam didn’t seem convinced and something inside of him really wanted to tell the truth, so he said, “We were just playing mated.”
Since falling asleep in your normal clothes was inconvenient, they switched to cuddling in their PJs, which had the added benefit of being more comfy and snuggly. Those were the right kind of clothes for an extended cuddle session.
“I thought you preferred the sweater?” Dean said, confused when Cas just latched on to his scent gland and then started scenting up and down his neck.
“Dean, don’t,” Castiel warned, but it was already too late. Having Dean’s fingers on his knot, even that light, tentative touch, was more than he could take.
a hunter before,” Castiel defended himself because at the time, that had seemed like an important piece of information that might deter a hunter.
Dean had him there. He could admit when he was partly at fault for a less than optimal sex position.
He never would have thought he’d get to have any of this, so he took full advantage of it while it lasted, challenging Dean to a rematch whenever the alpha looked especially hot or smelled especially delicious (which, of course, was all the time).
Plus, they were sexually compatible. And then there was the way Cas kept looking at him without blinking as if he could stare right into his soul. Might not be
Looking back down at the list, Castiel noticed the items required to turn a love potion into an anti-love potion.
Even though Dean tried to ration the slick, he was running out by the second day. After all, Gabe had only been able to organize one bottle on such short notice. (At least he had felt bad enough about it to give it to Dean for the normal price, which had seemed rather uncharacteristic of him.)
Dean cleared his throat, making Cas aware of the fact that he had stopped scenting, but had his nose still pressed against his scent gland.
With those words, he opened the door with a wave of his hand, stepping aside to let Castiel have a look. It was just another white room with a single chair in the middle of it. A closer look revealed that it seemed to have straps on the armrests. It certainly wasn’t as homey as Castiel’s cloud. Or better yet Dean’s bedroom.
Somewhere along the line, they migrated to the kitchen for a snack (for Dean—Cas mumbled something about molecules), and suddenly, Dean realized that they’d been talking for a couple of hours and he’d actually had a lot of fun. Maybe losing out on that opportunity to have sex with some random omega hadn’t been the worst thing. Getting to spend time with a real-life angel, who was actually turning out to be really easy to talk to, was a lot more interesting anyway.
They stayed like that for a while until Cas let go of him again. He smelled calmer now; Dean’s comforting pats on the back had obviously done the trick. Well, Dean
“It’s just payback because he didn’t like it when I said I wouldn’t cuddle him to sleep anymore,” Castiel mumbled.
With Dean all around him and inside of him, Castiel felt the pleasure build, curling his toes and making his body spasm as a powerful orgasm washed over him.
Dean still saw the lights on at Jimmy’s place whenever he himself happened to be up at night. He would have assumed that with Dean regularly chasing Jimmy around the gym, he’d be too exhausted to be up at all hours of the night, but apparently not.
He got ready, filled the slick into his fleshlight and got into jerk-off position on his bed. Before he could even begin to open his laptop to look for porn, the scent hit him again and he didn’t have time to think about porn anymore because his dick went from zero to ‘have to nail that omega right now!’ in less than a second.
At least, the more they got into a routine, the more relaxed Cas became during their cuddle sessions. Of course, it might have something to do with the fact that their physical contact wasn’t having any adverse effects on Dean (as he had been telling him from the beginning).
“There’s a private investigator camped out in front of our house,” Dean said when he came home from the garage the next day.
That was one of his favorite tricks, saying just enough to get the conversation started and then letting Cas do the talking.
Still, Impala probably wasn’t as awesome as he appeared when they were playing together online. At least, that’s what he kept telling himself, but it was getting harder to convince himself of that, and his omega certainly didn’t listen to that feeble attempt at an excuse.
Yeah. Good thing Dean was a professional. Since Cas had been oblivious to the fact that he was basically asking Dean’s alpha to come out and play, that whole situation would have gotten awkward pretty fast.
Well, he supposed that was true. Dean really wished Jimmy had said something sooner, though, which would have saved him a lot of trouble trying to figure out
Maybe they could go for a second round before Cas had to drive home. Dean always enjoyed a second round of sex when he could just slip his cock back into the open hole that was still wet with a mixture of lube and Dean’s own spunk. It had to be a bit sore by that point, but Cas never seemed to mind another romp in the sheets.
“Well, it seems like my job here is done,” the officer said, ending the call. “Mister Novak—call back your brother. He was very worried.”
“There’s this chapter on belly rubs,” Dean said as he sat down right next to him, his thigh brushing against Cas’. “It’s supposed to be good for the pup.”
That was, until Dean mentioned casually during a commercial break of Dr. Sexy, “Sam is coming for a visit.”
It sounded like a simple enough plan, but for some reason, Castiel was still nervous and excited at the same time when thinking about his online date on Saturday.
He wondered what the alpha told his friends when they asked about it. It wasn’t like he could say another alpha had marked him.
Cas was halfway out the window when he realized that in his haste to get away, he had completely forgotten to take his wallet. He tried to climb back inside to get it, but slipped and fell down into the bushes.
Deciding to ignore him for the time being, Cas addressed his brother instead, “Gabe—what are you doing here?”
Instinctively, Cas tilted his head even further to the side, offering his neck up for Dean to do with as he pleased. Another broad, slow lick sent a shiver down his spine and goosebumps across his skin.
After, he felt much more satisfied than just using his hand (or sex toys) usually left him. His alpha was appeased just as much as his own sexual frustration was. Normally, his knot didn’t pop when pleasuring himself, but feeling and smelling the slick seemed to have awoken that instinct that made it necessary to give his seed the extra edge to do its job, even though he obviously couldn’t impregnate the fleshlight.
Michael did try to catch them in their lie on more than one occasion, asking personal questions, but Dean always had an answer and somehow made it sound like they were madly in love.
When they were scenting and Dean put his arm around him, he felt safe and cared for and he never wanted to leave the scent-embrace.
But Dean thwarted his plans with a simple, “No,” and a kiss that almost managed to distract Castiel from what he had planned to talk about.
“Oh.” Castiel touched his fake mating bite, suddenly self-conscious about what it might reveal about his feelings for Sam’s brother. He looked at the closed door to make sure he could speak openly, and said, “Well… we were… pretending.”
wanted to get laid as a grand finale to the night, he had also been looking forward to a night out with his bestie.
That’s when it hit him. He had unwittingly weaseled his way into Dean’s friends group. This would not be easy for him when his mating bond to Dean was inevitably broken and he would have to give them up.
“Yeah, but the effect is increased, like, tenfold if it’s a cuddlibus. Anyway, I saved the best part for last.” He pointed at the watch on his left wrist, a wide grin on his face.
When Dean joined him in the bed, the omega had his back turned to him, giving off clear ‘don’t touch me’ vibes. Damn! Dean had hoped for a repeat performance from last night, holding Cas and cuddling for a bit.
Maybe he could pick up a beta for his next rut and use the omega’s slick to lube up the beta’s asshole before fucking it. Yeah, that sounded like a plan.
was the one to get into trouble. Apparently, he hadn’t been authorized to lock a fellow angel up in a room that took away the angel’s powers.
“That doesn’t make any sense,” Castiel protested. “Mates spend an alpha’s rut together. I should take off work and we should hole up together.”
By the next morning, Dean was back on his side of the bed, and Castiel decided not to mention what had happened. He wouldn’t mind being scented to sleep again in the future, and there was no chance of that happening if Dean knew of his unwitting transgression.
Dean let his eyes travel down to where they were touching—Cas was basically lying on top of him. He’d been touching him… kind of a
Dean had probably packed more of Cas’ clothes than his own. He just hoped they would still carry Cas’ scent a couple weeks from now.
“I’m just gonna take my angel friend here and we’ll be on our way,” Dean told Uriel as he approached the chair.
He had imagined how this talk would go more times than he would like to admit, how he would thank Zachariah profoundly and promise him he wouldn’t regret his decision…
Then there were the training sessions that did nothing to diminish his crush. No wonder, during his self-defense lessons he was confronted with Dean, glistening with sweat, muscles defined, the pure musky scent of alpha all around him… Being chased by him was just the icing on the cake and awakened instincts in him he hadn’t even known he
“The doctor said contact can help, too,” he explained, as he motioned for Dean to sit down on the couch.
Cas, meanwhile, was rummaging through Dean’s nightstand with no regard to his privacy as per usual and found the omega slick. Sniffing at it, he scrunched up his nose. Right. An omega’s scent wouldn’t be doing it for him. The omega slick was for
all the time. It was more like a peck when she did it, no lingering, certainly no… nuzzling for lack of a better word.
As it turned out, he didn’t have to worry, seeing as no one was around to observe them anyway since the party had migrated to the living room at that point. Staying in character even when the others weren’t around was a genius move on Dean’s part. After all, they never knew when someone might walk in on them.
“How long?” he asked, snuggling against Dean. (He’d have to fill up on snuggles since he wouldn’t be getting any for a while.)
Once, he had gotten a freshly washed one that had mainly smelled like detergent and fabric softener. That had been rather useless. But ever since he had complained about it to Gabe, the clothes were well-worn, and
a way out as soon as Charlie mentioned a handmaiden outfit Dean apparently possessed. Castiel wouldn’t mind seeing pictures… Or the real thing.
The very next day, he was back in Cas’ shop, a wide grin on his face that told Cas he wasn’t going to like what he had to say.
“Still. It’s weird,” Dean insisted. It was probably the beer that made him say, “Here, I’ll show ya.”
“Dean Winchester.” It was the first name that popped into his head and only a second too late did he realize that he should have just made up a name.
“No, I’m not,” Castiel denied because this tone of voice, he recognized, and he didn’t want Dean to stop whatever it was they were doing here. (Because this had gone further than normal grooming. He had been groomed before and
Just like that, from one second to the next, he had been back there, had felt teeth plunge into his shoulder blade, had smelled an awful alpha scent, could almost taste it… But then, before the gagging could start, there had been another alpha’s scent. One that offered comfort and safety. One he didn’t want to run away from but get closer to.
Castiel knew what that meant. He could almost hear it, too. Almost, but not quite. With most of his powers gone, it was as if he couldn’t tune in to the right frequency.
been the case, the worst that could have happened is I’d have slept through the night, right?” As opposed to being rudely awoken and having to deal with all of
Never had he considered the fact that it could be difficult to say goodbye to the omega he might have knocked up. He really hoped Cas wasn’t pregnant, so that he got to fuck him again because his alpha simply wasn’t ready to let go of this omega forever.
“My brother said I’m supposed to be looking for an old guy, mid-eighties?” the alpha said. After a short pause, he mumbled to himself, “That little shit.”
“That’s the joke part,” Dean said with an eye roll. “Never mind, I’ll write your lines down for you. Can’t mess this up. I’ve been waiting to get back at him for a long time.”
Michael had always just pushed in and begun fucking him immediately without any regard to whether Castiel was comfortable or not. Dean, on the other hand, entered him slowly and gave his ass time to get used to the intrusion.
“Dean,” Cas said, keeping his neck out of reach and ignoring Dean’s pout. “I’m in heat,” the omega reminded him. “You bite me, you mate me.”
“When you first came to me, you were very particular about getting the curse lifted,” Castiel reminded him.
As always, Dean started narrating his mood as soon as Castiel let him in, “Pretty exhausted. I was up half the night, and today was very busy. But the good news is I know a few tricks now that could be helpful.”
Stroking his mating bite in an attempt to fake his mate’s gentle touch, he could already feel his thoughts returning to the alpha’s agility and good looks, and to the way he had made him feel. He wondered whether his mate was feeling that strange pull too, or if that was just the oncoming pining sickness.
“No, you know what? It’s good,” Dean concluded. “’Cause now I know what I want, so I can go find an omega to fall in love with and start a family.”
“Well… Yes,” he admitted. They looked at each other for a long moment, and when Dean didn’t say anything, Cas continued, “There are things… that you don’t know.” He trailed off, unsure of how to continue or if he had said too much already. Getting Dean into trouble was the last thing he wanted to do.
He was a rut companion for tonight. His job was to ‘bend over and present’ as Gabe had so eloquently put it. Provide a hole the alpha could fuck at will. That’s why he got rid of the rest of his clothes—he wouldn’t need them tonight and it gave him something to do besides staring at the handsome alpha.
Bartholomew cursed as he dropped the gun, and while his hand flew to his wounded neck, Cas picked it up and pointed it at the alpha with shaking hands.
He smiled at Dean laughing out loud at a joke Cas had missed due to his musings. A quick look at Sam, who was rolling his eyes, told him that the joke couldn’t have been that funny, though.
Dean looked at him as if he was debating whether to say something or not. Finally, he did, “Yeah, about that…”
When he wasn’t frustrated about being inadvertently teased by Cas, he really enjoyed their evenings together.
Finally, he could grasp a thought long enough to say, “Alphas don’t court each other.” Even as he said it, some part of him realized what a dumb thing it was to say. Because clearly,
, and he was only there because Dean needed someone to fuck and omegas were hard to come by, but there was still, technically, one alpha too many in this equation.
Dean had been too focused on holding his alpha back from fucking Cas to pay attention at the time, but the next day, it occurred to him that he had no idea if Cas had been hard himself, much less if he had gotten off.
Sam turned out to be very nice. He said things like “I’ve heard so much about you,” and when Dean wasn’t there, “You’re making Dean so happy. Thanks for that!” and one time even, “He’s lucky to have found an omega like you.” (At that point, Dean jumped in with, “Stop hitting on my omega.” and Sam rolled his eyes and started telling them about Eileen.)
Once inside, he gave Cas some time to get used to the thickness of his cock filling his ass and leaned down so that he could lick at his neck.
Again, Cas wasn’t quite sure how to answer. He definitely didn’t want Dean to go, that much he knew. But what was the alternative? Was he ready to continue where they had left off? Dean would have questions without a doubt…
As always, Gabe tried to convince him to provide more slick. Apparently, customers had already asked for more. With the scent of the mystery alpha in his nostrils, the thought of producing slick for other alphas raised his hackles.
He had been prepared to throw a blanket on the floor and settle in for an uncomfortable night. But if Dean was willing to share his bed, he wasn’t going to say no.
“Yeah. Anyway, we should buy some rabbit food.” That’s when Dr. Sexy was walking across the screen again and Dean’s attention was back on the TV.
“I need to use the bathroom.” And with those words Cas wiggled out from under him, climbed out of bed and then left the bedroom.
He was really hungry himself, so he dug in, happy to have this moment of contentment to spend with his alpha friend—whose scent seemed somehow… less strong than usual.
Because let’s face it, there was no way Dean would go through another rut without Cas by his side. From now on, Cas was
“We’re sitting ducks here! If your wards fail, there’s nothing between us and that psycho witch. My place is warded against all kinds of evil. I’m taking you there until your powers are back. Or until I know how to gank her.”
good at it, taking a perverse sort of delight in making Castiel grunt, moan, and curse in an undignified way. Castiel had never been one to make a lot of noise in the bedroom, but when he was with Dean, there was no controlling the sounds that came out of his mouth.
Dean’s alpha didn’t appreciate the mocking. “Come on, this isn’t funny. My alpha is trying to show you how tough he is. You making fun of him isn’t really helping to settle my protective instincts here.”
Soon, Dean was running out of ideas, though, and the next time Cas fell asleep when they had been watching a movie in Dean’s room, Dean himself was too tired to come up with a good prank. Plus, Cas seemed so peaceful and innocent, snoring away softly, head resting on Dean’s shoulder, so he just kissed the top of his head—as sort of a joke, of course.
They continued cuddling and kissing and fondling each other, the feeling of skin on skin sensual and intimate, reveling in each other and in the fact that after such a long time apart, they now had all the time in the world to keep scenting and holding each other close.
So he let his hand drift to Cas’ stomach, stroking it softly as he guided the omega’s head back against his neck to give his pup as much of his scent as it needed. And if he got to press Cas against him at the same time, then that was definitely a plus.
Since up to this point Cas had mostly been touched with violent intent, this felt nice. Touches that didn’t hurt, that were a way of saying ‘hey, you’re my friend and I feel comfortable touching you’ were new to Cas, but he found he liked them. He liked them a lot.
Castiel put a hand right over Dean’s heart and let as much healing energy flow into his body as he could. He
The thing was, Castiel wasn’t all that motivated to find a way to lift it. He tried a few things, but mostly, Dean’s dick just ended up in his ass again (or in his mouth or rubbing against Castiel’s) and they had to conclude that the curse still didn’t affect his ability to have sex with Castiel.
This time, Dean did roll his eyes. “Wow. You’re real helpful.” After a beat of silence, he thought of another question, “Does giving a blowjob seem like asexual behavior to you?”
“I wouldn’t know. I couldn’t smell it. To you, it was very obvious that I wanted it, but me, I thought maybe you were mad because I crossed a line…”
This time, Castiel wasn’t surprised when Dean showed up at his cabin late one night. After all, they were bound to meet again since his visions had never been wrong. What
Please no telling me why this sucks, I tagged it as best I could and if it’s not your jam, nobody makes you read. If you liked it, I would love some comments and kudos, though. But I'm not looking for any kind of negative feedback (I believe it's my beta's job to offer criticism. Once I post a story, I'm not interested in negative feedback since at that point it only serves to make me want to stop writing).
As if Dean could read his mind, he started scratching his belly, and Castiel knew his control was slipping. After having slept together too many times to count ever since their bet had started, Dean knew all the buttons to push, all the right ways to make him writhe in pleasure.
Castiel, meanwhile, was making good use of the licking technique, sucking on Dean’s scent gland to get to the source.
“Dean,” Cas said on a soft moan, eyes half-lidded. He looked almost stoned, making Dean wonder if there were different flavors for cuddlibi depending on what kind of cuddles they got.
The longer Castiel was in the presence of this human, the more his feathers got ruffled and not just in the figurative sense. Something weird was going on with his feathers, which puffed up and no doubt made him look utterly ridiculous. Luckily, his wings were invisible to Dean.
As if the alpha had read his mind, he leaned in and whispered, his voice raunchy and his breath hot against Castiel’s neck, “You’re gonna get fucked now.”
There was another moment when Dean didn’t know if he was allowed to spoon Cas, but the omega just snatched his arm and put it around his middle. Well then.
He gave Cas his best reassuring smile but was wholly unprepared for the handful of omega he had in his arms a second later as Cas buried his nose in Dean’s neck.
If he didn’t know better, he’d say he smelled mating hormones mixed in with the scent of the alpha’s arousal. But that was impossible, of course, since alphas couldn’t mate each other.
Since he really wanted to be the one to father Cas’ pup, they were back at it soon, Dean once again taking Cas from behind according to the omega’s plan.
Cas nodded and declared, “My favorite cuddles involve my mouth.” After a moment of contemplation, he added, “And your mouth.”
Cas looked at the spot Dean had described, a forlorn expression on his face. Unable to see his omega suffer because he was separated from his scent-bond partner, Dean decided to do something about it. “Come on, do it.”
It wasn’t always just the five of them. Sometimes, Andrea, the omega Benny was courting, was there, or Charlie brought Gilda along.
After a while, Cas tried to take over and control the rhythm, but that simply wouldn’t do. He had teased Dean enough! Now it was
Why was Jimmy still looking at him as if he had gone insane? The plan was beautiful in its simplicity!
Instead, the thought of the friends he had made here filled him with a nervous energy that made sleep seem like a distant possibility. And then there was Dean who might just have been talking about Cas’ eyes after all. Who had kissed his cheek not too long ago. Who had locked eyes with him when he had been sexually intimate with an omega. Who had sent Cas into heat by touching
him was so much better! There was no mistaking the scent of alpha, earthy, musky, still with the last remnants of arousal, but their scents had started to mix and Dean
He had joined Castiel on his bed when he had started shivering from magic withdrawal and was now idly stroking his arms, even though Castiel wasn’t cold anymore. He wasn’t about to point that out, though, because this was rather comfortable. Dean seemed to have forgiven him for using his magic against him (and almost getting them killed in the process).
But that was okay because at that moment, Dean did what he had originally suggested, and leaned forward to take him by the neck.
Before Impala could react to that, Castiel quickly went on, “I’ll have to look for an alpha to take care of that.”
They were back to their wordless staring ritual, only this time, Dean’s eyes flitted away from his after a few seconds and down to his lips.
Twice more, Dean came by when he was out, and so Castiel suggested they exchange phone numbers so that he could call ahead.
Even though he did everything Dean told him to, it didn’t change his answer once their tests were done.
They were just standing in the hallway, and Cas didn’t make a move to lead them to the living room or the bedroom. Something was up, and Dean’s stomach was tying itself into knots.
Well… it was kind of what Dean wanted. Not the ‘fuck buddy’ thing—thanks very much Gabe for making Cas worry about that. But of course he had had a fantasy or two about the omega that were well above PG-rated.
Dean didn’t much care for Jimmy’s scent, the same way he didn’t care for any alpha’s scent. But this… something? It had to be the scent of scared Jimmy, and as messed up as it was, Dean actually kind of liked that scent.
Seemed like Dean had won as predicted. He released Cas and licked over his mating gland one last time before pulling back a little. The new claim on Cas’ neck looked good, but it would fade all too soon. Something more permanent would be so much better.
“Yeah, right!” Not Dean’s proudest moment, but that was his reaction to his best friend coming out to him one night when they were hanging out at his place, after their second beer. “Since when?”
Of course, he trusted Dean and knew that the alpha wouldn’t break skin but sometimes, when they were lost in each other’s scents and the world around them had all but faded away, Cas kind of wished he would.
Dean didn’t dare move when Cas began writhing around against him, scenting down to his belly button and back up to his pecs.
A prickling sensation at the back of his neck made Castiel look back to where the woman had been moments before. She was gone now.
Cas was looking at him, and if not for his scent, Dean wouldn’t have known if his words were having the intended effect.
Cas immediately opened his mouth to let Dean’s tongue inside, greeting it with his own. A teasing dance ensued, awakening all kinds of chasing instincts within Dean, even though he had Cas right here in his arms.
What was a bit disappointing was that it was always Dean who had to bring it up—Cas was probably still under the impression that it was all for Dean’s benefit. Which was fine. Whatever. He could initiate their cuddle time if it meant the stubborn cuddlibus of a best friend stopped depriving himself of the contact he required.
He had to have failed miserably, though, because the next moment, without another word, Dean was in his personal space, pulling him in for a hug, one hand on the back of his head, the other slung around his back to pull him close. The hand on the back of his neck softly guided him to the nook between Dean’s neck and his shoulder.
He really should get going so that he’d be home in time? Dean didn’t even ask in time for what (good. Cas hadn’t come up with an excuse for that one yet). Instead, he mentioned that Cas would have to wait for Dean anyway because he was his ride.
, but luckily, he was good at thinking on his feet and came up with an acceptable excuse. No one would suspect anything was going on between Dean and Cas if they thought Cas was mated to some omega.
“Won’t know it until we try it,” Dean said, head still tilted so that the long line of his neck was hard to look away from.
Other things they tried, which worked for Dean but apparently not Jimmy, included: listening to relaxing music, turning off all the lights and talking by candlelight, and using calming scents like lavender or content omega.
“I know you’re there,” Dean said. “Look, I’m retired, so go bother someone else before I have to gank you, okay?”
Just to be sure, he ran the calculations multiple times, but the outcome was the same: Lisa was the omega Dean would marry and be happy with for the rest of his life.
Showing an alpha your belly was another way of inviting intimacy. But again, he was already lying on his back with Dean blanketing him.
Dean refrained from pointing that out, though. He would get his chance to scent Jimmy back one day, he was sure.
didn’t have words for. What he knew was that he enjoyed it—all of it. Dean touching his wings, Dean touching him in other ways, and especially Dean tentatively scenting and kissing him and taking him into his arms, showing human affection.
That seemed to be the right thing to say because Cas’ mouth returned, his tongue teasing at his slit.
He took out his cell phone and stared at it for a while, but then he put it away again without texting Cas. What would he even say?
This was the first time Cas was initiating a cuddle session—even though he had to be full after a visit from his sister.
Naturally, Dean was appalled and promised that he would never stab Castiel with a witch blade. Or any other blade, really.
Shortly after the lights went out, he felt the bed dip, but Cas was heeding his warning and staying all the way on the other side of the bed, so far at the edge that he was probably in danger of falling off.
The urgency of the kisses intensified as it became harder for Dean to hold his alpha back from rolling on top of Cas and showing him what usually happened when this level of intimacy was shared between an alpha and an omega.
Instead, he turned Cas around onto his belly, placed a kiss on his shoulder blade and kneaded his ass cheeks before pulling them apart, exposing his pink little hole.
Basically climbing on top of Dean, he started scenting him more aggressively, slipping his hands underneath his shirt for some skin-on-skin contact. Come on, vision!
“Actually, it’s easier for me to feed on you,” Cas replied and proceeded to do just that, snuggling against him more tightly.
When he told Sam that, he said, “I thought so. Well, in that case… There are new omega discrimination laws that will be implemented next year, which should make it easier to take legal action against people like Zachariah. So, you could just wait them out…”
He did, however, bring it up with Benny and Sam when they were hanging out at their usual joint, sitting at the bar and nursing their beers.
Plus, it wasn’t often that he had an omega in his bed who he was this compatible with. He was really glad that it was Cas who’d be carrying his pup.
“So… what do you say?” Dean asked, uncharacteristically shy as if he wasn’t sure what the answer would be.
There had definitely been arousal in the air, but Cas had talked about it as if it had just been another cuddle position. Which was why Dean hadn’t thought about it as ‘sex’ and had kind of dropped the ball on the whole reciprocation thing. Well, that and the fact that he had no idea what Cas was even comfortable with in bed, being asexual and all. Although he might have to rethink some things…
Gabe only lived about an hour’s drive away from Dean, maybe he could crash at his place for a while. After all, his brother had mooched off him in the past plenty of times. Time to collect some favors…
Castiel perked up. “Maybe we can see about that curse you’re under,” he suggested because now that he only had bits and pieces of magic left, he was curious to see if it changed things. (And also, he really wanted to get fucked again. Maybe Dean would do him slow and deep and kiss him lots.)
Castiel asked for the other relevant information, which Dean provided as succinctly as possible, and when he clicked ‘next’ to see who he could send…
The moment Dean’s eyes had zeroed in on her, time caught up with them all at once. Dean jumped up, faster than Castiel had ever seen him move.
“What? I don’t want to get back together with Inias,” he told Dean. Hadn’t the alpha paid attention when he had first explained his plan?
Dean’s fingers in his ass had felt really good last time. Of course, he was prepared for the alpha’s cock, so Dean could just plunge right in, but Castiel was paying for a service, so he might as well ask for what he had liked last time.
Of course, it also had the intended effect: Cas had more energy and wasn’t walking around like some kind of zombie anymore.
Dean,” Castiel amended as he started organizing his books, finding the right place for each of them on the shelf. He didn’t even really know the guy. He only knew bits and pieces—certainly not enough to hate him.
Soon, they tried riling each other up, intent on getting the other one to lose control. Dean started with a slow, deep kiss that turned dirty when he nibbled on Castiel’s lower lip before slipping his tongue into his mouth and lazily stroking Castiel’s tongue with his own.
Not when Dean had an omega in his bed who he was making out with. Especially not if that omega was Cas!
The dazed look went away and now Cas was squinting at him. Oh, right. Dean was supposedly having heat sex for work all the time. Seemed like his brain wasn’t at full capacity, either.
Without taking his eyes off the threat, Cas took a few steps back, almost stumbling over his carpet on his way to get to the burner phone Dean had lent him as a temporary replacement for his old cell phone.
“Yeah, man. Of course,” Dean said, even though that didn’t make any sense. It wasn’t like Jimmy was asking for permission or anything. But maybe it was
Cas rolled his eyes, which was such a Cas thing to do that Dean had to smile. Yeah okay, maybe he really wasn’t having any second thoughts.
Strange non-verbal messages aside, there really was nothing else they could do but experiment around in order to find the underlying cause of why Dean still wasn’t able to get hard on his own.
Cas just sighed, exhausted. It seemed like he was back to worrying about relocation and losing Dean.
“Don’t sweat it,” Dean said. “I’m just really fast. I’ll plan in some cardio for the training sessions.”
Even though he whispered into the phone, Dean could still hear some of what he was saying, “No, everything is okay. It was just a neighbor.”
He had never been invited to an alphas’ night before (mostly because he was an omega), so he had no idea what that would entail. Maybe they’d drink beer, watch porn, and he’d have to make lewd remarks about omegas. But no, Dean thought he was an alphasexual alpha (he was
Cas was left with tingling limbs, a throbbing feeling in his belly, and an empty feeling in his slick-coated ass.
Dean’s favorite way of guaranteeing Cas was turned on enough to take his dick quickly became Cas’ favorite thing too. The first time Dean took his penis into his mouth, Cas thought he was back to dreaming about the alpha. He’d wake up any second and there would be slick all over the bedspread.
It was a bit strange for Gabe to compliment him. Maybe he thought Dean coming back to his shop so often was a sign of interest in him.
taken the potion. But Dean had this look on his face, raw, vulnerable in a way Castiel had never witnessed before.
Cas’ blush expanded down to his neck and he shot Dean a dark look, but didn’t comment one way or another.
Oh, yes! Scent compatibility didn’t even begin to describe what was going on here. Even though he had only meant to take a quick whiff of Dean’s scent, Cas found himself breathing his scent in more deeply, nose pressed tight against the alpha’s scent gland.
“Stupid collar’s in the way,” Dean mumbled. “Mind if I…?” And he opened the top button of Castiel’s shirt and loosened his tie before getting rid of it entirely.
Cas’ heart skipped a beat at the thought that he might have to leave the new life he had found with Dean… that he had found
The alpha grinned and took a step closer. “I was just teasin’,” he said, hand outstretched to offer a handshake. “Dean Winchester.”
The fight took longer than the last one. Having fought each other before, they knew the other’s tricks and could anticipate them.
Dean most likely wouldn’t care, chasing instincts too strong to resist. As an omega in heat, you were never to run away from an alpha unless you wanted to get a ruthless fucking until you were drenched in the alpha’s spunk.
thanks to whoever liked this fic enough to send it in to the Destiel Fan Survey Favs Collection! The fact that this fic is actually someone’s favorite made me squee so hard, and if you want to tell me who you are, I’d be willing to (try to, no promises) write a prompt / request for you because I can never express how much this meant to me! (In the meantime, take this early update as a thank you.)
Oh, yes. And he said stuff like that, in his usual deadpan, wondering why Dean would splutter and reprimand him, “You don’t
Over the years, the store space opposite Cas’ antique shop had been turned from a diner to a book shop, a yoga studio, and most recently a coffee shop. Cas felt bad for the owners when they inevitably had to close and move on. He of all people knew how hard it was to keep a business afloat in such a small town.
Some morning cuddle time (and maybe more) sounded like a fantastic idea, but unfortunately, at that moment, the doorbell rang.
“Breakfast in our nest sounds lovely,” Cas quickly reassured him, and just like that, the bright smile was back on Dean’s face.
“You know, from the Alpha Service? In case I need help during my next heat, too. Might as well go with what I know works.”
Castiel also realized that, as much as he knew about human hormones and the exact balance required to have them fall in love with each other, he really didn’t know a lot about human behavior or even body language. That was especially irritating since he would really like to know what the weird look Dean had fixed him with meant.
The thought of what an alpha like Dean would do to an omega in heat sent another tingly wave through his wings.
“I’m not in the best mood today,” he’d say. And then he’d start talking about the beta he hadn’t been able to save. Another day, it was, “Really happy right now,” followed by the story of a pup they had been able to rescue.
The funny thing was, if they had met under different circumstances, they could totally have been friends. Sure, Cas was a bit nerdy, but in the fun way that made him endearing because of how passionate he got about things.
Why was Dean going around kissing the top of his head? Was that a scenting buddy thing? It seemed like a strange way of saying ‘Don’t worry about the slicking, bro.’
“You’re supposed to kiss it and… stuff,” Castiel instructed him as he sat down next to him on the couch, once again baring his throat in Dean’s presence.
“Uhm… relaxed.” That did not sound like the whole truth, but it wasn’t what Castiel had wanted to know anyway.
That’s when Castiel realized that he didn’t even have a plan of action here. What was he supposed to do? Ask Sam to play along if someone were to mention something to him? Of course, Sam would find out the truth soon enough anyway, so Castiel had no choice but to tell him about the situation he had gotten himself into this time.
When Dean’s scent was so distracting that Cas had trouble concentrating on what the alpha was even saying to him, Dean finally ended the lesson, clapping Cas on the shoulder and telling him that he had done a great job—which Cas assumed was just a pleasantry because he had clearly sucked. Dean had been able to overpower him easily time and time again.
He could understand why his oil glands were starting to secrete oil—it had been a while since he had last groomed his wings. But why was his asshole wet? And why was he feeling hot when he shouldn’t be affected by temperature?
“Okay.” Sam nodded, determined, and turned around to the bookshelf to search for a book. “We don’t have a lot of time till Monday, but let me look into the legal side of things there.” He had finally found the book he was looking for and put it on the desk on the papers he had been working on when Castiel had arrived.
“Balthazar is dead, too,” Hannah said without inflection. “Alfie is the third witch who was killed with his own witch blade. A hunter, no doubt. You should renew your wards.”
When he had double clicked on him, he had thought that his wolf would quickly get on Bees and then get off him again a second later and that would be it. He’d had no idea that he’d get options like speeding up his thrusts or choosing where to come.
Only, not so much, because apparently, his friends had unanimously decided that Cas would stay for game night without so much as consulting Dean.
Since Dean smelled irresistible as turned on as he was, Castiel started scenting him frantically in between kisses.
Cas spent most of the time with Dean’s dick in his ass while they were scenting and making out. Inevitably, Dean would hold him tight as he kissed him through another intense orgasm.
Even though Dean knew he shouldn’t, he kept on trying to get Cas to bare his throat for him again. Given that Cas was positively
Curious as to what her comment about Purgaytory had been all about, he found himself on the website of the club—and swallowed hard when he realized what kind of club it was.
Feeling that naked cock slowly make its way into his ass, submissive instincts suddenly flooded through him. This was the alpha who had won the fight, who was now asserting his dominance over him by shoving his cock all the way up his hole. And all Castiel wanted to do was show him that he accepted his dominance.
“You sure? ’Cause I could give your omega a quick fuck.” Impala sounded amused. Castiel recognized it as teasing. Impala was doing that a lot with him.
Castiel had no idea if he should get up too, but he felt it was safer if he stayed seated for now. “Sam Winchester, in legal, sir,” he told Zachariah’s back.
His job usually didn’t involve getting scented, but from time to time, omega patients scented him to calm down when he arrived on the scene. So yeah, he was no stranger to getting scented by people, and as a professional, he managed to stay calm so that his scent would have the calming effect the patient needed.
The alpha was breathing evenly, looking adorable as ever while asleep, completely unaware of being molested by an omega in his sleep.
“Righting injustices is why I became a lawyer. I’ll just do some research, see what I can find out till Friday.”
That was good because they really needed to pool their resources together. After all, they were dealing with an evil witch stuck in between the realms, trying to steal enough magical power to rejoin the world of the living. If they wanted to stay one step ahead, they had their work cut out for them.
Still, Dean didn’t make much sense as usual. “You’re not too old for sex in the Impala, but you are too old for sex on the floor?”
thing to do. He had to sacrifice his own happiness for Dean’s because at the end of the day, Castiel’s happiness didn’t really matter.
Of course, Dean had no way of knowing that Cas had no experience whatsoever with being in a same-designation relationship, so Cas tried to be vague in his answers. But Dean just kept coming up with ridiculous questions like: did cycles sync for alphas too and wasn’t that weird when both were in rut and wanted to mount the other one? Did they have breeding instincts during their ruts even knowing that it wasn’t possible for them to knock each other up?
Pulling out and ignoring Cas’ protests, he flipped the omega over and then plunged into the squelching ass again without warning.
By that time the alpha scent had to have worn off, so Cas tried to cover his scent with as much cologne as possible before he opened the door to let Dean in.
Once his knot had gone down, he found out how much fun it was to give Cas a bath. His hands were gliding all over the wet, naked omega, and he ended up joining him just so that he could pull him against his chest and kiss his way up and down his neck.
Dean’s pulse was still racing, confused hormones raging through his body. He wouldn’t have been surprised if mating hormones were responsible for the way he felt left behind and the way he wanted to go after Cas.
“Well,” Dean said as he got up off the couch. “I’m sure it’ll work. That—” He pointed at Cas’ mating gland that had to look really red from all the attention Dean had given it. “—will make him jealous and then you can get back together. Everybody wins.” He smiled one of his fake bright smiles, which only served to confuse Cas further.
It had to be the alpha who was standing on a ladder, shirtless, in the process of cleaning the store window. His scent was all alpha, mixed in with the spicy scent of his sweat, which made Cas—probably for the first time in his life—
So now Cas’ dream about the alpha had made him slick all over the mattress he currently shared with said alpha, which brought him back to the matter at hand.
“Let me take care of you,” the alpha said, soothing him with a reassuring hand on the small of his back.
This human was even more stubborn than anticipated. “You would prefer to find your perfect match yourself? Among millions of eligible omegas?” That was ridiculous. There was a reason angels were responsible for that task. Humans, if left to their own devices, tended to choose the wrong mate. Broken marriages and mating bonds were the result, and in the end, the alphas and omegas who had once loved each other would grow to resent each other.
Jimmy didn’t react well to his questions, though. After the day he’d had, Dean could understand that all he wanted to do was lie here and… cuddle a bit. Or, you know, have a manly embrace with each other. As alphas did. Or at least alphas who were madly in love with each other.
They might be playing with fire here a little bit because one inch to the left, and Dean’s teeth might latch onto Cas’ mating gland. With mating on both their minds, they could easily get carried away. Instead, Dean was careful to find a safe spot and finally began nibbling and biting, sending more waves of pleasure through them both.
Luckily, mid-afternoon, Dean left the cabin to ‘stretch his legs,’ which gave Castiel the perfect opportunity to exhaust his magic as much as possible. After all, his powers tended to develop a life of their own when confronted with a supermoon, so he had better make sure nothing strange was going on later.
Cas’ eyes flitted to Dean, who was watching the siblings with barely concealed interest, before focusing on Anna again, mumbling, “I just fed recently,” by way of explanation.
Dean playfully raised his eyebrows at him, prompting him to ask, and since Castiel was in love with this silly alpha, he dutifully said, “What’s the prank, Dean?”
That prompted a groan from Dean. “Are you still on about that?” He rubbed between his eyebrows, probably in an attempt to chase away an alcohol-induced headache. “Cas, not for nothing, but you’re oh for two where finding my perfect mate is concerned. Well, oh for three now I guess, if you’re on about some Anna chick.”
“All sold out. You should be flattered. Come on, this alpha has a real hard-on for your slick, and desperate alphas are the best customers. He offered triple the price.
. If he was being honest with himself, he had wanted to do that ever since that first scenting session.
“I’m just about to look for one,” Castiel lied to get rid of his brother. Since he was rather bad at lying, Gabe would most likely know that he wasn’t telling the truth, which was why he quickly added, “Why don’t you take care of your own charges?”
