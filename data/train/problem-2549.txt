Dean knew that Cas was enjoying this as much as Dean was hating it. It was a damn pain in the ass. “I am a nice pers—“
After the incident with Dr. Roche, things went smoothly for Cas and D. Of course D was mostly unresponsive and distant, but thankfully, there were no further screaming incidents or nightmares. As far as the yogurt and honey, Cas tried his best to get the omega to eat. He tried feeding the kid and Cas was positive that if looks could kill, then he would be six feet under. So, he left the kid to his own devices for the yogurt. It took almost an hour, but D had ate almost exactly half of the yogurt and seemed content to leave it at that. He put the container on the table beside him and rolled over to snuggle with his bee.
Cas came out of Dean's room. He rushed up to Dean, shaking his head. "No, I messed up. I should have told you where I was going. Fuck, you make it hard to remember shit. You are so..." He drug his thumb down Dean's lip and let out a shaky breath, "distracting. You distract me, baby. I was just getting something to fill you up. I knew that if we were to get through even five letters tonight that I needed some help. Go put in your plug, baby." Dean looked to his right as he saw Cas lift up his trusty pink plug and a bottle of lube. He quickly sucked Cas' thumb into his mouth and nodded.
"While we wait for your breakfast, would you like to help me with something?" Castiel could see Dean's shoulders relax, but he didn't respond in any way. "I would really appreciate it, sweet boy."
And then he was on his back with his arms above his head. Cas held down his wrists and kissed and licked on his neck. “I want those little grunts in the morning. The ones you make before you’ve had coffee and can’t quite speak yet.” Cas continued sucking on one spot, definitely leaving a mark while he ground his hips down slowly. Dean could only let out shallow breaths as he continued.
"Wonderful." Cas decided to leave the conversation at that. It was so easy to forget where Dean started just a number of weeks ago. Full conversations, excellent social skills, and introductions to multiple strangers in one day was something that Castiel had originally hoped would happen within the first eighteen months of their therapy. He was overjoyed and beyond proud of Dean. However, every person had their limits and his sweet boy needed some rest. To be honest, he did, too. It is quite difficult to absorb so much new information in one day. Especially information that carries the weight of the news they received today.
Castiel looked over to the young man beside him and smiled. He needed to look over his notes and add the events from the day before. But first, he needed to use the restroom. He stood, stretched his aching back (hospital chairs were not known for their comfort,) and yawned. He already knew that there was no helping his hair before he even looked in a mirror, so he just straightened his sweater and dusted off his jeans. He had to go home later today, but he wanted to let D know before he left.
Cas kept kissing his mating gland and put his finger to Dean's lips. "It's extremely unethical to get paid to treat your Mate. We'll get you a new ORS and get you a nice, permanent mark... right here." Cas let his teeth graze over Dean's neck.
"Okay. Follow me. I'll get the water started. While you shower, I'll move the car, get in our bags, and then I'll join you." Castiel squeezed Dean's hands twice. "If you want that."
Dean looked up at him and winked. "I've heard a lot of it and dished just as much in my day... you're going to have to try pretty hard."
Dean nodded around the fingers and provided Daddy with the most demure smile he could manage. Cas moaned deeply and touched his forehead as he removed his fingers from Dean’s mouth. “I also love your mouth because it’s where your sassiness comes out, it’s how you tell me you love Daddy, that you want more, and it’s where I want my mouth right now.” Dean looked up and shivered. They hadn’t kissed yet. Dean hoped that it would be as good as everything else. It had to be.
Castiel tuned back in to the host's monologue. "Before the likes of Henry Cavill, our Superman was first portrayed by Kirk Alyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, and many others in various franchises..."
Cas shivered. "Unless you want us to get kicked out of here for public indecency, then you need to go help set the table."
Also, thank you all so much for being patient while I deal with work things. At this point in life, I'm living off of kudos, comments, and Mountain Dew.
Dean's eyes drifted shut and he wrapped both of his hands around Castiel's wrist and pulled his fingers in deeper. After a few minutes of whimpering around Cas's fingers, Dean's breathing was back to normal and he seemed obscenely content. "Liked that, Alpha. Felt good. Felt safe. Know you're gonna take care of me."
When they were in the privacy of the kitchen organization aisle, Cas lifted his wrist to Dean. The omega smiled and inhaled deeply. Cas squeezed his hand."Well, we will fix that tonight. How about our first official date night? Westerns with dinner?"
"Take your time, Cas." Dean tried to look optimistic and attempted to smile at Cas, but the alpha could tell that he was feeling a bit apprehensive. After all, the kid had just told Castiel that they were destined to be together and had been from the beginning of time. That wasn't part of a light-hearted conversation. Of course he was apprehensive. Hell, Cas was downright scared.
"Getting bashful, Cas? When you're not my daddy, are you a little shy about how fucking massive your cock is and how badly I want it inside of me? Okay, I'll play along. Our bedroom, huh?" He could feel Cas smile as he continued to trail his mouth around his neck.
The nurse smiled. "I didn't want you to think we were neglecting him." There was that classic care that Castiel had initially expected.
When Daddy did return, he was only wearing his boxer briefs. He slid into bed and wrapped his arms around Dean. “Hey, sweet boy. Want to read a bedtime story?”
Dean didn't respond at first. He just kept trying to taste his Mate. Cas knew that he needed reassurance and acceptance. He needed for his alpha to let him mark him and bond with him. After a few minutes of quiet, almost sacred nips and bites, Dean reached behind him and pushed Cas' hand into the back of his pants. He moved their arms until Cas was touching his most sensitive place. The omega whispered his almost silent whisper, "Inside, alpha. Need you inside."
So, there stood the trio. Cas was in the middle, his breath clouding the glass. Gabe was behind him to his right and held his lollipop high above his head to avoid everyone's hair as he tried to make his way to the front of the group. Bobby was against pressed up against the wall to Cas's right and he looked even grumpier than he had earlier. To be fair, though, he did have one foot on the floor and one knee in Gabe's office chair. That had to be uncomfortable.
When the car came to a stop in the garage, Dean was out in record time and walking into the house. Cas decided to hold back and give him a bit of space. So, he sat in the car for a moment before turning it off. He waited a couple of more seconds to confirm that Officer Hanscum was in her position before closing the garage door. Then he wasted plenty of time on his way into the house.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh at that one. Of course Cas threw that in there. He was always telling Dean to clean up his room and it was always ignored. Now, he knew that Dean would do anything he asked. Sneaky bastard. He wouldn't doubt if vacuuming the hallway wasn't on there somewhere, too.
Last night got Cas thinking a little too hard. He began questioning how wrong it would be to rush into Dean’s room, kiss everything better, and confess everything. His infatuation, love, and very inappropriate fantasies. Surely all of the hints he had picked up on over the years held some bearing. After sitting in the dark, the lamp beside the couch his only light, for far too long, Cas decided to go out. He needed to clear his head of those pesky thoughts. He only needed to be Dean’s friend and to suggest anything else was not only absurd, but arrogant.
Quickly, as he heard Dean rousing from his sleep in the other room, Cas set the table and ran the opposite direction to his room. This was either going to go exceptionally well or absolutely crash and burn.
“Good baby. Now, open your mouth.” Dean furrowed his brow but followed Cas’ instructions. Cas slipped his thumb into Dean’s mouth and held his chin up with the rest of his fingers. Then, he tucked his thumb behind Dean’s bottom teeth and gently tugged him closer. Dean was at eye-level with the cock he had literally been drooling over for five years.
"Actually... I need to discuss something with you, Gabriel." Cas knew that using his full name would make his cousin focus.
Dean cracked his eyes open as sunlight began to make its way through the window. He smiled as he remembered where he was. He was in Cas’ bed… Daddy’s bed. He couldn’t help the slow smile that spread across his face as he stretched as much as he could. His back popped and as he returned to his original position, he could feel Daddy wrap his arms even tighter around his waist. After last night, there was no more doubting or fear. Cas wanted him just much as he wanted him… Everything was reciprocated. Dean’s confidence was through the roof.
"Enough food? For me and you?" Castiel asked while he poured some syrup over his waffle and berries.
"I'm going to give you your first real orgasm." With that, Cas got on his knees and ignored how uncomfortable the shower was. He slowly spread Dean's cheeks apart until he could see his omega's rim. He growled before slowly licking over the tight muscle.
"The sedative will be wearing off in a matter of minutes. He will be fine... physically. I can't speak to the state of his mental condition after he finds that you've been taken again. His precious True Mate. Well, I'm not really taking you, am I? I can't even imagine how neglected your inner-omega has been feeling. Almost three weeks with no cock stuffing your hole. You used to not even be able to withstand an hour. I've heard stories of you needing two or three to satisfy you."
Bobby nodded and read over his notes. "Well, that is all that I need for now. Thank you for sharing this information with me. I know it is an extremely sensitive topic. We have about three weeks before the trial, so I may need to contact you again. This corroborates all of the other testimonies that I have heard so far." The man finally looked up from his notes and gave Cas a small smile. "I think it's time that I stop keeping you from your omega."
"I don't plan on stopping," Cas turned Dean around so his back was to Cas' chest and began massaging his fingers through his hair, "I love you so much, Dean."
Cas attempted a few more conversations, but Dean wouldn't respond. He was too busy with his wall-building and worrying. The alpha understood. Looking through his rehabilitation lens instead of his True Mate lens reminded him of just how significant this meeting was to Dean. It had the potential of making or breaking the progress they were achieving so quickly. Well, that Dean was achieving. Castiel felt that he hadn't done much to actually rehabilitate Dean other than letting him scent to his heart's content, but that was what he needed.
"Yes, please. Tell me anything that I can do to help you put this bastard away for as long as possible."
Cas gave him a small smile. He thought back to the first couple of days that Dean was in the hospital and he would only eat half of his food. He was saving it for someone else who may need it. "Yes, there is plenty of food for other omegas. You can eat as much as you want."
Castiel couldn't argue with that. "Well, do want you can with the name. He still hasn't communicated his age, but the doctor's seem to think he's between 22 and 25. There's probably thousands of people in that age bracket with 'Dean' somewhere in their name. I'll give you any parameters that you need once you get the preliminary stuff in order."
News of Dean's "first words" spread like wildfire around the corridors of the hospital. When Castiel walked to get a drink from the vending machine during the night (which was less than five hours after Dean spoke, mind you,) he could feel eyes on him. He heard hushed tones and sounds of awe as he made his way to his destination. Apparently, this was big deal to everyone in the hospital.
Cas took his plate and glass over to the kitchen. As he was washing them, his eyes were glued to Dean. Dean slowly moved in circles on the dildo. Soft moans escaped his mouth and his head dropped back onto the back of the chair. "F-feels so good, Daddy."
The hand on my wrist loosens, but Castiel uses the grip to pull me in closer. I try to fight him. Try to hit and push. He just holds me tight against his chest, whispering in my ear, “You’re everything to me. I won’t let anything happen to you. I won’t let anyone touch you.”
Castiel’s blush spreads down his neck and across his shoulders. Dean didn’t even know that was possible. He likes it, though. He likes that he can see the boy blush even from behind. “They’re a bit… revealing.”
“I dare you.” Castiel raises an eyebrow. “You certainly won’t be getting laid on our wedding night if you do so, though.”
“Sorry.” I look back at them, rubbing a hand against my chest. The feeling doesn’t go away. “It’s good. I like the slower pace. I could see the moon this weekend, which was beautiful. I almost forgot what it looked like.”
The restaurant Charlie brings him to is on top of a high rise. It's partly inside, but the majority of it is outdoor seating on the roof. They get a spot with a perfect view of the city, and for the strangest few seconds, Castiel finds himself upset that Dean isn't here to appreciate it too. He quickly shakes his head to dislodge that ridiculous thought. Dean probably wouldn't even blink at something like this. That man has seen way too much in his life to be impressed by a view of the city.
Things just get worse when he starts toward us. The sun shines through the tips of his hair, making it nearly glow. Freckles are scattered along his nose and cheeks. And his eyes….
When Dean’s vision finally clears and he realizes who is standing there, he sucks in a breath of relief. “Dammit, dad. Warn a guy.”
I just sort of shrug, because I’m not sure if I believe her. It’d help if someone would tell me what the fuck is happening to me.
“I love you,” Dean whispers without meaning to. He can’t get himself to regret it, though. Not in the least.
“No. God, Cas, no. I just…” Dean releases a shaky breath. Then I feel the door jiggle against my hands. I step back just before he opens it for me. His face is blotchy and red, his cheeks soaked with tears, and his eyes full of more. He’s so god damn beautiful, it takes my breath away. He seems to be affected by seeing me too, since he’s gone speechless, his eyes focused on me as we stare at each other.
"I don't need it. You don't need to be trying anything, understood? You're my fiancé. You have every right to ask me not to cheat. And I have no right to use you for sex because of it." Dean pauses, eyebrows pulling in. "This is very important to me, Castiel. Even once we are married. No matter what. You will always have your consent, and you never have to give it to me. I need you to know that I genuinely mean that."
There’s a man sitting at the table when Dean enters the kitchen. A man that is not Castiel. The sight of him sends Dean to his knees, all of the air expelling from his lungs.
Castiel. Leather paws are put on his hands, rendering them useless. His collar is so tight that the little oxygen he was managing to get before is now gone. There’s a cruel laugh. The Russian.
Castiel stares at him in shock. This is too good to be true. He doesn't trust it. Dean must have an agenda. Castiel's father always did. “What changed your mind?”
I want him to make me his. To claim me and mark me and own me. Even now, with the heat over with, it's a dull longing in my mind. But do I really want that, or is biology tricking me into thinking I want that? What if I don't even like Castiel? What if I don't actually want to be with him, but my body does? How do I know if all those feelings for him were real?
The shower was quick and both of the men were far too tired to waste any more time in the steam. Dean finished drying off first and fell naked onto the bed. Castiel laughed as he ran his towel through his hair on final time. As he turned out the light, Dean repositioned himself to the middle of the bed and spread his legs just enough for Cas to lay on top of him.
Castiel nodded. "All of our stuff is still packed. Grab any toiletries you need and your jeans. I'm going to get our jackets out of the car."
So, he hopped out of bed and walked into the kitchen. Dean was only wearing boxers and had the pacifier in his mouth. He was totally content with this outfit. He supposed he should be having an emotional meltdown about this time, but he couldn’t seem to find a downside to this little game he and Cas had begun to play. He was able to cuddle with his hot-as-fuck roommate and his kinky side was finally getting scratched. Sure, other partners tried some not-so-vanilla things in bed, but he was tired of a few spankings being considered earth-shattering. Cas knew what was up.
On Wednesday afternoon, the two men were playing catch- scratch that, researching a therapy aid- again. This time it was a two-inch diameter ball. Dean was doing fairly well with it, but they were spending longer on it than any other ball so far. Dean' language had progressed quite a bit, as well. He was still struggling with multisyllabic words a bit and was certainly not ready for his speech therapy to end. He could, however, advocate for his needs more completely and his questions for Cas certainly became deeper.
He had an affirmative response before he got to his car. (That is if you consider a thumbs-up emoji and a gif of a dinosaur saying "yea-yuh" an affirmative response.) He suspected that Gabe had been sitting on pins and needles waiting to hear from him.
"Hello, omega-mine. I'm so sorry I left you. I wasn't thinking clearly." Cas walked closer to Roche.
Dean inhaled sharply. He could feel Cas' dominance over him in that text. Zero to sixty is how it is then, huh?
"That is more than okay. We need to get this brother of yours fully mobile again." Dean breathed a sigh of relief and turned to Sam. Cas wanted to tuck him under his arm and hold him until he remembered just how precious of a partner, friend, and omega that he was.
"Holy shit. Yea, good plan. I almost pissed myself," Dean continued to snicker as he stood and stretched his arms above his head. Cas couldn't resist leaning over and popping his ass. "I like this part of waking up, though."
About fifteen minutes later, Cas was returning to the room with his lunch and the yogurt for D. He was thinking about how to spend the rest of the day and had determined that getting the kid to eat most of the yogurt would probably take most of their time. He also thought it was important to communicate the safety of the other omegas to D. If what Charlie said was true, and D took on responsibility for other omegas, then it may calm his nerves a bit to hear that they were doing okay.
"Yes, she was. However, her personality was quite different and she had some lapse in memory. In the three months I shadowed on her case, I saw her have to relearn the names of pets, places, and her sister's name. Her sister was in college at the time. She was much more reserved afterwards and jumpier. She ended up fine, but she was certainly a different child than the one that the other little girl described as her bully."
Castiel figured that he had a few minutes before D would get cranky, so he went over to the nurses' station to find Charlie. "Yoohoo, Ms. Bradbury?"
Dean cackled as he walked away, giving a little sway of his hips as he went. Cas caught up with him and grabbed him around his waist and pulled him flush against his chest. “You need to behave, young man.”
“You didn’t like… Bullshit. Dean, I need you to be honest with me because now I’m beginning to think that something very serious is going on. Please.” Cas gave him that award-winning concerned look; head tilt and little lip pout included. Damn him.
"Do you think he wants it to be positive?" Dean had his hands in his pockets and seemed determined to kick all of the rocks on the sidewalk out of his way. He was looking down and Cas could tell that his anxiousness was getting the best of him.
Cas’ eyes grew dark as he put the pacifier somewhere behind him. “Open, baby.” Dean obeyed and groaned as Cas filled his mouth. Two slender fingers almost choking him was better than any pacifier, any day of the week. “Baby, cum however you need to, okay? You took your punishment so well.”
"Yea, yea. I agree. Just hope that DNA test comes back the way they're hoping or they're going to be crushed." Bobby quickly jerked his head to one side in Sam and Dean's direction.
Sam glanced up at Dean and gave a half-hearted smile. "I don't know what's wrong with the thing. It's given me problems since I bought the thing."
Cas nodded. He suspected his puppy would come crashing down soon. "Of course, love. I think I'll make some lasagna tonight, okay? Finally have that home cooked meal."
When it was just the two of them, D laid his head back on his pillow and sighed a happy sigh. He opened his eye and ducked his head, almost shyly, as Cas scooted closer. "D, I am so proud of you. You did well today, buddy. You did really well." D couldn't take his eyes off of their hands. "If you want, I'll sleep right here in this chair tonight. You don't have to let go of my hand, and Bee can stay between us, okay?"
"I already checked that you signed the proper confidentiality reports. I can tell you anything that you need to know about this kid." She paused and looked down at her shoes.
The omega nodded his head but would not make eye contact with Cas. Cas squeezed his hand and felt D squeeze back. "I'm proud of you. I'll hit the call button to get some pain meds and maybe then we could play a game?"
He filled his bag with the essentials- pens, the case files, a notebook, some picture cards, a stuffed animal, and some crayons. These were usually the materials he used for elementary-aged patients, but someone with no touch would have severe setbacks with their communication. Mentally, they had whatever vocabulary they had before the abuse began. The problem was neurological. The left-hemisphere of their would begin shutting down. The axons and dendrites wouldn't allow them to communicate properly. Aphasia had been recorded in some instances. They could understnad information but they could not communicate back. Sure, they could grow to be what was considered average for their age, sometimes even well-above average, but it would start with short words. And who knew how long that would take?
From there, Castiel could determine what kind of day Dean was going to have. If he curled up on the couch, usually with Bee, after choosing one of Castiel's records to listen to, then it was probably going to be a quiet day. If he turned on the TV and propped up his feet on the coffee table, it was going to be an average day. If he asked Cas "what're we gonna do today," that usually meant he had a lot of energy and needed to get out of the house. He really was like a new puppy sometimes.
I think of him telling me that I smell amazing. Telling me how happy he is that I feel at home here. Telling me he doesn’t want me to leave. Telling me to keep safe for him - again.
Instinct tells me to stop him. To stay here. To talk things out. To crawl into bed and let him hold me.
Just when Castiel thinks everything is finally done, the doctor and Dean exchange a look. Castiel feels his stomach twist as he watches them. The pain gets worse as Dr. Warren says, "Castiel, I need to check your cuts. Just to make sure they're healing properly."
Dean sighed and rolled onto his back. "What?" He cut his eyes over to Castiel. The kid was clearly still upset at their previous conversation, but he wasn't about to shut down on Cas. Good, that was good.
Castiel simply stared. "Gabe, at that point, people don't need rehab, they need a full-time care team."
Ahhh I know that this was a long wait for a chapter that is not my favorite, but it has to happen before we get to one of my favorite parts of the story. Thank you for being patient!!!!!
"Dean says... well... I know... we are True Mates." Castiel waited and held is breath for an answer.
"F..." He snarled. "F..." Another groan of frustration. "Fuck you." It was quiet and strained, but it was unmistakable. Dean lifted his middle finger to the doctor and laughed a short laugh.
Cas knew that Dean still had a long road to travel before he was fully well, but comments like that made him cringe. What archaic expectations were put on his mate? "No, baby. I'm not jealous. I promise you that I'm not. It's wonderful to see you with a friend and you can hang out with whoever you want to hang out with. I'll be happy to contact Sam to find a time that you two can get together this weekend. I'm your soon-to-be-Alpha. Not your boss. I just find it remarkable how quickly you were able to warm up to Sam."
"I promise." Thankfully, any further distractions and contributions to a potential wreck were cut short as Castiel pulled in front of their home. He parked the car in the driveway. He didn't want Dean to have to maneuver his way through Christmas boxes in the garage. "Stay there, okay?" Cas gave Dean a quick peck on the cheek before exiting the car.
Dean pulled out the oil dipstick as he laughed. "Alright, smart guy, look here." Sam leaned over the car. "Never judge how much oil it needs by the first pull, okay? It swishes around a little when you drive and it can be inaccurate. So, wipe it off," He wrapped the shirt around it and pulled. It came out clean, and only left a little stain, but the shirt was officially ruined. Sam didn't seem to mind. "On here are these little grooves. If the oil touches this line, it needs two quarts. If the oil touches this line, it needs one quart." He handed the dipstick to Sam. "Alright, you check it."
By the time Castiel returns from his run, soaked with sweat and panting, Dean has a tentative scene planned in his head. He hands Castiel a bottle of water and tells him he should take a shower because he’s gross. As Castiel starts to laugh, Dean adds a quick, “Oh, and we’re going to scene tonight. I want you naked and kneeling in the playroom at 5 PM sharp. I’ll put a cushion by the door,” over his shoulder.
Already having two of his three lined up, Dean dives into question number one. “What would you like to do after you graduate from the Edlund Institute?"
It's the wrong thing to ask. A wave of grief hits Dean so hard, it manages to even overwhelm me for a few seconds. I cut off my threads to everyone else, ignoring the uneasy shifting of Charlie and Jack nearby, clearly upset with me for breaking our connection. With my focus solely on the paper thin thread just starting to stretch between Dean and I, I try to send him
Instinct also made me want to get knotted and bred like an animal. Instinct wants me pregnant. Instinct wants me to submit to him. To submit to the alpha.
They last four minutes in the ocean, which is impressive considering the cool autumn temperatures. Then they scurry up the beach, ass-naked and laughing so hard they can barely breathe, back to the deck. They use their shirts to haphazardly dry off enough to enter the house again before shutting and locking the doors. Dean looks at the ocean longingly through the glass, but then his stomach growls, and he's back on track.
Castiel puts his hands on the windowsill and hunches over, hanging his head between his shoulders. “And then Dean got away, and was holding him to his chest and comforting him. He was hiding his face so he didn’t have to look at me. Our son was crying. Calling me a monster. Begging Dean to keep him safe from the fucking monster, and Dean promised. He promised to never let the monster touch him.”
The way Castiel's gaze darkens should send Dean running for the hills. Instead he stands his ground. He trusts Castiel. He won't give in to the monster.
Bobby grunts to acknowledge my words. Then he pulls out a handgun and shows it to me, the muzzle pointed at the ceiling. The sharp scent of silver fills the air, burning my nostrils and setting my lungs on fire. "You claim him during this, and I'll put this entire magazine into your chest. We clear?"
. It feels good for a few seconds before I remember what’s happening to me. Before I remember that I’m angry and frustrated.
"That's debatable." Dean takes a slow drag from his cigarette, then leans forward and taps the ashes off the tip onto the man's shoulder. The guy jerks, more out of surprise than pain most likely. "Last chance to introduce yourself."
Castiel sobs as warmth flutters through his gut, unsure if sir is going to give him permission to come or deny him. He can't beg, his mouth full of the panties, but that doesn't mean he can stop himself from coming. He's afraid he'll let sir down. He's afraid he won't be able to stop himself. Desperate to be good, Castiel squeezes his eyes shut and holds his breath, trying not to give in to the pull of his impending orgasm. He tries to say, "Please, sir," but he doesn't think it's coherent enough through the gag. He sobs harder, shaking his head, desperate for sir to understand.
"Gonna fill you up," the dom announces, his voice strangled. Dean flicks his eyes up in time to see the dom drop the sub, letting him lay limp against the mattress, arms and legs still bound like they were in the beginning. Dean's legs shake and his stomach quivers as he watches the helpless sub get fucked.
Unable to speak, Castiel just nods. He waits for Dean to move, but the man doesn't. Dean just pulls back a few inches, enough to look at Castiel's face, and so many emotions are in his expression that Castiel is overwhelmed.
And then it gets worse. He lifts a second band and stretches it around Dean’s sack, the rubber squeezing his balls until they’re reddish-purple and ready to burst.
When Castiel wakes up alone, he’s suddenly overwhelmed by the urge to run. Without Dean right in front of him, acting as some sort of anchor, Castiel is reverting right back to his anxiety from yesterday. His eyes fall on the glass doors that lead to the balcony. Dean never said he couldn’t go out there. It’s probably the closest he could get to freedom. Maybe some fresh air will make him feel better.
“Charlie, have you seen Castiel?” Dean asks a few minutes after the last time he saw the boy. He was just here. Standing by the counter, looking around like he was searching for a way out. The plan was to take him upstairs and call it an early night, considering the big day they had, but Benny had asked Dean another question about Ruby, and he lost his visual.
Things settle when they start at Kripke. Castiel's family backs off. Dean starts getting a handle on his powers. Their relationship sinks back into their normal, easy complacency.
He feels Castiel nod against him as he closes his eyes again and allows himself to finally drift off. Castiel's voice becomes background music as Dean slips blissfully into a dreamless sleep.
This kiss is full of need. Desperation. It's rough, his teeth nipping at my lips in between pushes and pulls. He licks his way into my mouth and groans. I want to ask him what I taste like. I want to ask him why he tastes the way he does. I want to ask him why we can feel each other. How it's possible. How any of this is possible.
Castiel smiles. “It’s not. I think you’ll enjoy it. I plan to use it a lot for edging you. If my memory serves, you enjoy that quite a lot.”
It's not at all what Dean had expected, but he should have. He can easily see it. Castiel, surrounded by instruments, smiling and singing, helping people find their own smiles.
“I know. Don’t apologize. He’s barely my father. More like a warden. That’s actually what Gabriel called him for the first year. We always dreamed of running away and living together. Unrealistic, I know, but it kept me going on the really bad nights.”
Cas nodded and ignored Gabe who was shaking his head with an exaggerated look of disappointment on his face. Cas knew he was teasing, but it made it difficult to focus nonetheless.
He could hear people talking. It must be Gabe or the detail that he had sent over. Stupid, stupid, stupid. He couldn't have waited ten more minutes. The one rationalization that he allowed himself was that Roche should have been on call at the hospital. He should've still been there and his Dean... his Dean should have still been safe. The love of his life was probably back in some hell hole, suffering at the hands of monsters because Cas was what? Cold? Prepared for winter? He wanted to bang his head into the concrete as penance, but figured he would be even less help to Dean if he were dead. Of all of the dumb things he had done in life, he knew that this was the one that he would never recuperate from.
Dean lifts the paddle and hits the center of his ass so both cheeks are partially spanked. When Castiel arches and lifts his ass, two of Dean’s fingers slip back inside him effortlessly. It’s different than before. Like Dean is… searching for something? Trying to make them fit better? Trying to stretch him so more -
The reminder takes the air out of Castiel’s wings. He deflates against Dean, tucking his face into his neck so he doesn’t have to look him in the eye. “Why have you never played with a brat?”
Dean stands then, walking forward. He steps up behind Castiel on the pedestal and rests a hand on his shoulder. In his ear, for just him to hear, Dean asks, "Does he like your panties?"
I sigh in relief, my eyes closing. I keep them that way as he strokes my cheek with his finger and asks, "Are you finished with your homework?"
That’s apparently all of the fight Dean has in him, because he quickly scoops Castiel up and tosses him over his shoulder. Castiel yelps but then giggles to himself as Dean carries him down the hall to the playroom.
Sam is also his moral compass, and Dean doesn’t have to ask to know what he would think of this current situation Dean has found himself in.
What if it is my decision? What if Castiel told me he would love and accept me no matter what? Do I want kids? Do I want to be…
Surprising him again, Castiel takes not one but two bottles from the fridge. Dean wonders if Castiel has ever even had beer. He never saw him drink any back at the compound. None of the other trainers seemed to either. It was all expensive stuff - mostly scotch.
Sam tucks his hair behind his ears, the wheels frantic in his brain. "You're not forcing him here, right? Like he can leave if he wants?"
By the time Castiel hears Dean say his name, it’s clear he’s said it a few times by the slight desperation in his voice. Castiel blinks, that damn tear falling, and he notices that Dean has put his hand over Castiel’s. Which means at some point he took away the menu, too.
Lucifer shoves the human off of his lap in annoyance and stands up with a grin. "Castiel! How was your time up on the mainland?"
“Your wolf needs to run. You can keep coming and checking on him if you need to. Just stay out of sight.”
Dean chuckles. He’s still in his suit he’s been wearing all day, the jacket long gone, his tie loosened. He’ll look ten times better in his tux - Dean can fucking rock a tux, if he does say so himself - but the boy still looks ready to devour him. Dean can’t exactly blame him. He’d like to devour Castiel too.
Whatever happened won't happen with me and Dean. I refuse to allow it. Nothing will take this omega from me. Nothing but Dean himself, if he doesn't want to be with me when his heat is over and his mind is cleared. But if Dean chooses me? If he becomes mine? If he accepts the reality of being true mates? Then I will not lose him. I'll die first.
“What else do you like?” Castiel squeezes his eyes shut beneath the blindfold as if he can escape him. Escape the question. “If you tell me, I’ll let you suck my cock.”
The pure hope in Castiel's question nearly drops Dean to his knees. He has to look away to answer. "No, just taking a quick shower."
"Yeah…" Dean mumbles, staring out the window at the trees they're passing. "I sort of - I didn't - so… I don't think we should - should live together. I found a place."
"Because I'm your dominant and boyfriend, and you know I'm in charge of making you safe and happy and cared for." It isn't until the words are out of his mouth that Castiel realizes he had no right to say any of them. "Sorry, that's not - I know I'm not-"
That smile Dean’s gone far too long without pulls at Castiel’s lips. “Why don’t you sit down before I do something cheesy like pull out the chair for you?”
Uncle Bobby knocks on my bedroom door at 7 Tuesday morning, calling for me to wake up and start getting ready for school. I give him a weak, “Okay,” because there’s nothing else to really say or do. He told me yesterday I needed to go back, and I didn’t have the energy to argue. It’s not like I need to tell him that I’m already awake, anyway. I’ve been awake.
"Promise?" Castiel tightens his grip on Dean, feeling like a desperate fool but unable to care. "Promise me that no matter what, you'll give me a goodbye."
It’s a strange thing, sitting across from a man whose murder you’ve spent your life plotting, sharing a bottle of expensive scotch and smiling. Generations of Novaks and Winchesters are probably rolling in their graves.
“Well, now, what do we have here?” Dean asks, leaning against the doorframe and crossing his arms over his chest.
"It doesn't bother me." Castiel glances over his shoulder at Dean, eyes hooded. "Just keep goin'. Feels good."
“From now on, unless I explicitly tell you to suck, you will only keep me warm,” Sir explains, his voice gentle again. “Like this.”
Castiel wakes up to someone in his bed. He’s half-asleep and disoriented. The only reason he doesn’t freak out is Dean’s whispers, “Cas?” because he recognizes the man’s voice instantly.
When Castiel wakes up, it’s still dark outside. It takes all of ten seconds for the memories from last night to come slamming back into his mind. Then he’s practically diving off the bed and hurrying to grab whatever clothes he can find so he can run as far away from Dean as possible.
"Yes. I'm aware. Do try harder to hide the fact that you're about to shit yourself, yes? We're just two business men having a friendly conversation about the stock market. Smile, Chuck. Smile and nod." Dean smiles and nods as if to show him how. Chuck begins to do the same.
There's drool and snot and tears on his face and chest. His cock is bright red, purple at the tip, and leaking a steady stream of pre-cum. His cheeks are blotchy and flushed, his eyes red-rimmed and wide.
“It’s late.” Castiel rubs a hand over his face. “You need rest. You’ve had a very long, stressful day.”
“Y - you can’t make mistakes, though…” Castiel shifts in his arms, clearly uncomfortable. He doesn’t pull away, though. Not yet, at least. “You - whatever you do is right.”
Dean stares at me for another second or two before blinking rapidly and looking at Benny. He forces a wobbly smile. “I’m okay. Thanks, Benny.”
“No, you said you were a mess, and you said you knocked a kid down and made him cry - something I’m assuming was just an accident, which happens to everyone. You did not, however, say how it went.” Castiel just shrugs, not sure why it even fucking matters. Dr. Edlund turns again. In a slightly louder voice, he asks Dean, “Dean, how do you think grocery shopping went?”
"Of course." I give him that easy-going signature smile I used to have before this omega decided to move to my town and flip my whole world upside down. Then I casually acknowledge Dean. "Hey new kid."
Sir leads him to the bed, his movements gentle, the skin of his hands rough even as his touches are soft.
“Cas!” I yell, unsure if he’ll be able to smell me through all of the blood that must be out there. “Cas, Cas, I’m here!”
“I know you would. Always such a good boy.” Dean licks the shell of Castiel’s ear, then blows on it. He chuckles when it makes Castiel buck against him and whimper. “Think maybe you-”
Dean hikes Castiel's pants back up from where they lay bunched at his ankles and quickly does the top button. A phone is on the ground that he assumes is Castiel's but it's dead. He stuffs it in his pocket and focuses on Castiel again.
Dean pauses just before taking a drink, the rim of his beer bottle less than an inch from his lips. Bright green eyes bore into Castiel from across the table as they become suspended in the moment. A moment that feels
“Water is good for you.” Castiel gives him a fake glare. “If you’d like to be stubborn, as I know you enjoy being, I’ll drink both glasses.”
Dean pulls on a pair of ear protection before placing another on Castiel’s ears. Castiel can’t help but smirk at the
As if he’s sealing the deal with a kiss, Dean lowers his mouth to Castiel’s. Their lips are hesitant at first, feeling each other out, seeing where everything belongs. The kiss is slow. Deliberate. So sweet and tender that Castiel can’t help but shiver, not from arousal, but from feeling loved and cherished. It’s an exceptional feeling.
The thought that sir has separated Castiel the fiance and Castiel the victim in his dungeon just like Castiel has separated Dean and sir should be terrifying.
Dean stands before me with heavy-lidded eyes, his tongue darting out to slick his lips. The hair that curls around his ears and falls on his forehead is already sweaty. His breaths come in shivery and labored.
“Good. Thank you, sir.” Castiel feels all warm and fuzzy, unable to stop himself from grinning like a lovesick idiot. “You don’t have to be so worried ‘bout me all the time.”
Castiel takes that as a good sign to continue. At first it’s just rolling his tongue, but then he begins to lick. Sometimes it’s long stripes. Sometimes little kitten licks. Whenever his tongue gets tired, Castiel resorts to kissing sir’s cock. Only for a few seconds. Then he’ll go back to licking it. There’s a spot he hits from time to time that makes sir choke and he wishes his blindfold was off so he could see where it is. So he can remember it for later. Hopefully he’ll get another shot at this. He can figure it out then.
“Yeah. What else are we gonna do? You can’t sleep, and I slept off my whiskey so now I can’t either.”
Dean parts his lips to say he's good, but no sound comes out. It'd make him panic if he wasn't so sleepy and happy. He can tell that Castiel is slightly concerned by his silence, though. He tries to swim through what feels like a fog - a fog made of laughing gas apparently because he can't stop grinning.
Anna's words swirl in my mind the whole way to the locker room, only fading once my eyes fall on Dean. My chest goes heavy at the sight of the beautiful omega curled up on the bathroom floor, clearly having been sick recently even if he flushed the evidence. He blinks up at me with heavy eyes and sniffles.
“Cheesy,” Dean teases, his blush deepening in color. He ducks his head behind the menu. “What do you think you’re going to eat?”
“Why the fuck aren’t you afraid of me right now?” It’s more the monster asking than Dean. Dean knows deep down it’s because the boy trusts him, the boy loves him, and he’s proud of that. But the monster is indignant. He feels like he’s bringing his A game here, when considering the rules he has to respect, and the boy isn’t afraid.
a perfectionist after all. Castiel twists his ankle and presses harder. The final six crackle as the slave shrieks and shrieks and
"You wouldn't want to come," Dean says with a shrug of his shoulder, not even looking at Castiel. "It's all demons going."
“Dean, that world… its language is money and power.” Castiel looks over at Gabriel, wincing, before looking back at Dean. “Us willingly walking away like we were? That wasn’t something my brother understood. Not something my…
This new feeling lasts about 30 seconds. Up until we’re back in the kitchen, Benny pouring vodka into a plastic cup and asking me what soda I want with it, and I look up to answer only to find myself locking eyes with Castiel across the room.
If this surprises Castiel, it doesn’t show in his expression. “Is there anything you don’t like about it?”
The man’s strong, gentle hands begin to press against his chest. Dean forces himself to continue speaking to keep his mind off of those damn hands. “He’s doin’ real good though.”
Unsure what to do, Dean stays in place and just rocks on his feet, watching him. At some point, Castiel blinks. Then he blinks several more times quickly, as if he is trying to refocus them. He catches Dean then, his body tensing.
“I’m already 18,” Dean tells me, glancing over his shoulder with an adorable frown. “You knew that, didn’t you?”
He keeps his body where it is, his right cheek hovering just an inch from Castiel's left. Every time he exhales, air falling on Castiel's ear, the boy shivers.
“Okay.” He pulls Castiel along, pointing things out as they systematically work through the room. “The paddles can stay, and all the bondage stuff. The fucking machine… it’s - can we maybe talk about rules with it before ever using it?”
“It was my handwriting, dad.” Dean turns back to the vehicle he was working on and pretends to continue. In reality, he just keeps his hand inside of the engine, hiding it as it violently trembles around the wrench he’s holding in a death grip. He stares without blinking, feeling like he might cry.
Benny frowns when he sees them, Castiel’s body leaning heavily against Dean’s, the boy’s eyes only half-open.
Uncle Bobby’s house is only a few blocks from the high school, and it’s one of the last warm days of autumn. Despite his arguing with me, he gives in and lets me walk. He warns me two different times not to talk to strangers. Warns me away from those troublemakers from the grocery store - because that’s all he’ll tell me about them, is that the family is full of troublemakers and I should steer clear. He double-checks that my phone is fully charged.
“Castiel, eyes on me,” he softly orders, a cool undertone to his voice that makes Castiel shiver in the best kind of way. Once he snaps his eyes up to meet Dean’s gaze, Dean smiles. “There you are beautiful.”
Castiel becomes aware enough to realize sir isn’t just nearby. No. Sir is right behind him, the slick sound of lube on skin filling the air. He musters every ounce of energy he has left and asks in a tiny, sad voice, “Sir, you said I’d do that.”
"So good for me, sweetheart. Come now. Take another breath." Dean guides Castiel back, letting him fill his lungs again. Then Dean starts to fuck his face like before. Within seconds, he's feeling his balls tighten and his stomach twist. "Fuck. Gonna come. Swallow it all, understood? Show me how much of a cum slut you are."
Narrowing my eyes at him, I climb onto my bed and settle in the center of it. I move the books and notes that I don’t need anymore and put them on the floor so there’s room for him. With a pat on my literature book, I grin at him. “Good thing we’re in the same Lit class. Come. You can borrow mine.”
Jimmy never has a memory like that again, though sometimes he wakes up convinced he had dreamt of something similar, screams echoing in his mind even as his brain claims he hadn’t dreamt at all. He still gets a strange feeling near Sam, but he’s decided that it’s just because of the memory-that-hopefully-wasn’t-a-memory that came to him when they touched that day.
At some point, while he's drifting between wake and sleep, Dean adjusts so he can look at Castiel's face. Castiel whines and tries to get back to his heartbeat, but Dean keeps him in place. When Castiel looks around, he realizes they're alone again. The ceiling light is off, leaving just the dim lamp beside the bed, and the moon has replaced the sun through the windows.
I carry Dean through the large house, for the first time hating the enormity of the place. It feels like forever before I can get him peacefully in my bed. I tuck him beneath the blankets and brush the hair off his sweaty forehead. He blinks up at me, his eyes foggy and unfocused. “No lea’me.”
“He deserves to know,” Gabriel says softly. He takes Castiel’s other hand. It’d be comical, if Dean wasn’t already on the verge of tears. Maybe bacon and coffee won’t be enough to get through this shit. “If he’s ready to know, he gets to know. We agreed to that the moment he came back to you, remember?”
Hands touch him. Warm. Heavy. Castiel shudders, his mind racing, his stomach filling with an acidic threat of fear.
Castiel sobs openly, tears soaking his blindfold. His whole body shudders against the wall. His cock weeps with him, rock hard and pathetic. A
I pull my hands away from my face but continue to stay focused on my coffee, unable to meet Uncle Bobby’s eyes. “Right…”
Castiel hums in agreement, his tongue and mouth working in unison. Now that he's not worried about trying to get as much of it in his mouth as he can, Castiel allows himself to relax. To
Nodding in understanding, I dip my hands beneath the hem of his shirt and press my fingertips to his sweaty skin. He moans like I’m touching his damn cock instead of his soft belly.
Dean’s defenses fall as he sees the tear that rolls down Castiel’s cheek. He closes the distance between them, pulling Castiel to his chest in a tight hug. “God, babe, I’ve missed you too.”
Dean always liked Cas like this; a little rough around the edges, usually because of some asshole at work, his hair sticking up more than usual, and his glasses on because "those contacts were feeling more and more like sand."
Dean nodded against Cas's shoulder and let out a content sigh. He stood still, letting Cas take comfort from him, for a full ten seconds before he pulled back. "Come talk to Sam!"
Cas' brain was torn between "wrong, patient, unprofessional," and "perfect, omega, mine." He had a few partners in his college years, but he had never once felt a connection to anyone like this. Even without a scent, he knew that Dean would be part of his life forever, in one way or another.
"Thank you, Charlie. I look forward to working with you." Castiel smiled and turned back towards D's room.
Cas let out a breath that he didn't know he was holding and picked up a fluffy towel from the bathroom counter. "I'll warm you up when you get out. I've got some comfy clothes picked out and a bed waiting for snuggles."
"I've never tried it, Daddy. I want to, though. I think it would be the most fun thing to keep Daddy's cock in my mouth while I have my plug inside of me. I keep in my nightstand so it's nice and close, you know. You can fill both my holes at one time. How fun would that be, Daddy?"
Cas smiled and tried to reciprocate, but Dean was already stripping out his shirt and walking across the living room to the bedroom. "Do you mind if I join you?"
On the table was a sectional plate filled with the same meal Cas had, except is was smaller portions and cut up into tiny pieces. His sippy cup was beside it. So... he wasn't going to be taking care of Cas after all, huh?
Gabriel stood and stretched his arms above his head. He ruffled Castiel's hair. "As far as I see it, little cuz, that's all the more reason for you to stay. The kid needs someone in his corner for the long haul. If it becomes a problem down the line, we'll deal with it then. I've got to get going. It's good to see you, though."
Gabriel grunted in agreement. "I'll let you go, man. Best of luck today. I am going to put out some feelers about the letter D lead, though, and see if gets us anywhere."
Cas knew that the trial was just over the horizon. Three days away. The trial would last a while, but this? This perfect omega warming his bed and filling an emptiness that he didn't know existed? That was for the rest of their lives. He could deal with the worries of the trial for a few weeks. This was a a war worth fighting. This was his Dean. This was his best. His best life, his best friend, his best future.
Dean's groan shook him from his wardrobe planning. He was at the bathroom door in a second. "What's wrong, D?"
Dean happily jumped into bed with Bee under his arm. He snuggled up under Cas's outstretched arm and sighed. "Castiel Novak, you sure know how to treat a lady."
"Turn over, baby boy." Cas' breath was hot in his ear as he forced Dean to turn over so his back was pressed against Cas' chest. He moved them around until his cock was between Dean's thighs. Cas then put his arm around Dean and gave him his thumb back. "Much better. Daddy likes those things so much that he had to get closer to your special place."
Cas gave him a small swat on his arm. "Hey. None of that, now. You have the right to feel nervous or unsure about this. It doesn't make you a baby to feel scared. It makes you human."
Castiel sat there with his mouth agape. True mates? As in mates that were bound by the very essence of their fucking souls? He could hear himself trying to talk, but it just came out as short noises that sounded a little bit like words and a little bit like a wounded animal. The idea of true mates was nearly obsolete. There were still cases of true mates, but there were less and less every year. Cas could recall maybe three headlines or so in the news over the past few months. He had never once thought that he may be one of the few in the entire world that found his Mate.
Castiel and Dean looked over. Dean instantly gripped Castiel's hand tighter and his smile faded. He moved so his body was in partially blocking Cas's body and let out a quiet growl. "Hey, it's okay. She is just bringing the food that you wanted, okay? She's nice."
“Then what were you doing?” Cas squinted his eyes, tilted his head even further, and scooted minutely closer to Dean.
Dean just nodded and yawned in response as he settled into his spot on the couch. It really amazed Castiel how flawlessly they worked together. Without speaking a word about it, Dean had just taken the left side of the couch as his own, much like he had claimed the right side of the bed. It didn't bother Cas at all. Quite the opposite. He loved that his omega was making himself comfortable. It was Dean's home, too, after all.
Dean grabbed Cas' chin and turned his head so they were looking at one another. He poked Cas hard in the chest and smiled. "My best Cas."
, do you understand?" Dean whimpered as Cas bent down and chuckled in his ear. "You're all mine, baby. Whether I'm your daddy or not, you need to show me some respect, don't you think? I'm the only one allowed to touch you any more, so if you're looking to get filled up any time soon, I would be careful."
"Okay, so then you probably are further up here in the four or five area. Ten is like the worst pain in the whole world and one is no pain at all."
Cas turned away from the door and let out a breath. If this was what his life with Dean was going to be like everyday, he was beyond happy and grateful, but he was going to have to start taking more expresso in his coffee.
Dean laughed. "Don't apologize for threatening me with a good time. No, alpha, I need to know... what happens when they release me? I heard Roche talking last night about letting me out in a day or two. I'll have to go to a shelter for a while before I can get on my feet and until then, how will I see you? I've... I've been kind of worried about that. I've gotten used to you, Cas."
"Cas... can you... fuck, I don't know. Just do what you think I need." Dean had all but collapsed on the wall during Castiel's onslaught. The alpha smiled and kept slowly licking and sucking all of the slick that he could out of Dean's hole. His Mate was such a trusting omega.
"It is to a degree. Gabe, you have to understand that the letter D is not necessarily even in this omega's name."
Cas leaned back in the recliner and closed his eyes. He tried taking some deep breaths, but it really didn't seem to help anything. He knew he felt a connection to Dean, but this seemed absurd. There was an enormous difference between finding a mate and finding your Mate. That capital 'M' had Castiel's head reeling. Of course, he felt more than he should for Dean, but how in the world could he have a True Mate? How could he, an alpha with no outstanding characteristics, have something that was only known by most to be an awful trope in overly sappy, romantic movies?
"I need a doctor imme-" she stopped her running when she saw the two on the bed. "What the fuck, guys?! Did you forget that homeboy here is hooked up to a damn heart monitor? For the love of all that is holy in this world, I swear, if you scare me like that again-- I will... I don't know." She was huffing and puffing around the room. "I will put laxatives into that damn yogurt you like so much!" She stormed out and they heard her make a muffled "false alarm" announcement.
As Dean turned his back to Castiel, the alpha couldn't help the shiver that ran down his spine. Dean had came such a long way in his recovery, but the scar tissue on his back showed that his pain was far from over. Cas was quite surprised that he was so comfortable undressing with another person in the room. Although, if he was never given a hint of modesty while he was held prisoner, it may feel nice to decide when and where he got to disrobe.
“You’re wrong because,” Cas paused to press closer to Dean and grind his hips against his ass. Shit. That was a big cock. “As badly as you need to be filled, Daddy needs to fill you up. Do you understand that? I need this as much as you do, baby. You make Daddy so fucking happy.”
Dean did as he was told and walked over to his chair. When he pulled it out, his suction-cup dildo was staring back at him.
"Well, I think this is a perfect night to start. Why don't we finish up here, you lay back and let me finish your day off right, hm?"
After reverently drying one another off, Dean and Cas both put on some pajamas. Castiel was in his lounge pants and a t-shirt, while Dean opted for one of Cas's hoodies and his underwear. "What? I happen to smelling like you." Dean retorted when Cas asked why he didn't put on any of the clothes he had asked Cas to buy.
"Boy, you better take ten and get your shit together before you do something stupid like mixing up gas and diesel." As he walked away, Dean was sure that he could hear him mumble "idjit," under his breath.
Sam shrugged. "Not really. I was able to find newspaper articles about two deaths that fit their description, as far as age, location, and the timing of me going into foster care."
"I woke up and I already booted up the computer. I was just waiting on you." Dean spoke so fast that it took Castiel's brain a moment to catch up.
Cas stared for a moment. He put his hand up to Dean’s cheek and stroked it with his thumb. “Dean,” Fuck, he hasn’t called him Dean through this whole thing. “Dean,” he closed his eyes and put his forehead to Dean’s. “I’ve always been yours. You’ll always have me.”
Cas usually had a breakfast and coffee ready for his omega when Dean shuffled out of their room. Sometimes it was only scrambled eggs and toast, but Dean seemed very appreciative either way. They drank their coffee in silence and Dean usually stayed quiet until further into the day. Cas didn't mind. He enjoyed their quiet time together. He valued the companionship and familiarity that allowed them to savor such simple, silent moments.
"That's true. It was kind of crazy. I got kind of crazy." Dean blushed and nuzzled into Cas's chest with Bee under his chin.
"You need to cum when Daddy says that you can cum." Cas leaned against the door jamb of the kitchen and smiled as Dean worked himself up and down.
Thank you all so much for the comments and kudos. I say this in almost every note, but I cannot tell you how happy those notifications make me!
"And I want to fucking believe you, man. But no one stays." He trailed off and let his hands fall to his side. "No one. I feel safe with you, but I'm gonna fuck up sooner or later and you'll see why I'm the one that's always left behind."
I am not planning on updating everyday, but I want to get several chapters out there before I go back to work on Monday! Unlike my first work on here, which is probably going to remain a WIP, I have a very clear plan for this story. Please let me know what you think! Thank you for all of the support!
“Hush.” Castiel gives him a stern look. “I don’t need to hear that voice of yours right now. Unless you need to safeword, you will not speak. No matter what. If I ask a question, you can nod or shake your head. There’s no reason for a pet to talk. Just stand there and look pretty for me.”
"Shh, relax. Lay down," he hears Dean whisper softly. A gentle hand pushes Castiel until he's flat on his back. He doesn't argue. Just that little bit of movement has him nauseous again.
“I really enjoy working with violet wands. Can we look into that together - not in the playroom, but through videos and research - and then you decide if maybe you’d be willing to make it a soft limit?”
"I'm going crazy," I tell myself and the wolf. The wolf just licks my cheek. "I'm officially crazy."
"Don't be sorry, and you're not a burden, Dean. I’m worried about you, though. Maybe you should go home? You look like you’re ready to pass out.”
The man glances at the door of the room as if Dean might barge in on them. He nods when he's sure the coast is clear, eyes darting back to Castiel before away. He scurries over to the rack of tuxes in the room, searching tags before pulling a few and hanging them on hooks beside the large mirror. "We will start with these. Hopefully Mr. Winchester will be satisfied…"
"Keep the apartment. Use it whenever you need it. But please, when you're feeling okay about it… just please stay with me. It can be your safe space, ya know? A place to clear your head or just get some distance when things get overwhelming. It can be
What Dean loves even more, though? The moment when the show ends, smoke filling the air and people clapping, when Castiel turns his head and looks at Dean with a goofy grin. Dean swears in those few seconds every year, they’re back on that roof again, two idiots that had no idea what a beautiful, messy life they were about to get into.
“No. No. It’s fine. I get it. One prison for another. At least this one has a better view.” Castiel tightens his blanket around his shoulders as if it can keep him safe from Dean. “Can I just get this damn security meeting over with so I can go on with my day?”
“I think you’re both horny teenagers who kept me up all last night. Do I think he’s an idiot with a death wish that would have the guts to mate and claim you? No. Do I think you two are only going to kiss and hold hands? No. Do I care? Not really. I’ve abandoned hope. If you want to be with the boy, be with him. I’ll support you. I’ll do whatever you need me to do.” He points a finger at me. “I’m just saying, no funny business is going to be happening under my roof. Go do it at Michael’s place. Make him deal with the two of you.”
Dean’s eyebrows pull in for a few seconds, showing his confusion. “Connor? No. God no. I’d never - no.”
Dean’s house is small and cozy. It has a little wrap around porch that Jimmy thinks would be perfect with a swing. The yard is tidy, and there’s definitely potential for a lot of gardening.
And everyone immediately recognizes me as new. Their eyes are like needles as I walk down the hall with the sheet of paper Uncle Bobby gave me from when he registered me for school. It has my schedule and my locker information. At least the school is small enough to only have two small halls of lockers, one on each side of the little library in between them.
I turn to look at the boy who spoke to me, giving him a friendly smile when I see that he’s smiling at me. “Yeah, that’d be great. I’m, ummm… I’m looking for my locker?”
“S - sorry, sir.” Castiel is panting. Shaking. But it’s not out of fear or pain. It’s out of lust. Need. Want. Desperation.
“Good. That’d be good.” He gives me a wide smile, clearly thrilled that I’m trying to come to his party. That look is why I keep myself from asking him if he knows if Castiel will still be there, considering he’s suddenly gone missing. Instead, I ask, “So, do you play football, then?”
"A toast then!" Lucifer announces, snapping up a pair of champagne flutes and handing one to Castiel. He lifts his in the air. "To my little brother, the genius."
The pad of his thumb presses against the dip below my sharp cheekbone, stroking across it. “I love your freckles.”
“What? No. Not at all, Cas.” Dean’s heart nearly breaks at the amount of relief those words bring to Castiel’s features. It’s like he completely relaxes.
“Shut up,” I grumble. I give him a fake glare that makes him smile harder, which makes me blush harder. I thrust the book at him without even finding the right page so I can avoid further smiles and blushing and giddy butterfly feelings in my stomach that I hate but love all at once. “Read your story.”
. And - and we said we loved each other and I said I trusted you and - and you just… you broke the hand holding rule, even!”
After a quick glance at the glass of red wine, Castiel focuses back on Dean. His hands curl into fists in his lap. He’ll most certainly knock something down if he has to try and navigate between a water glass
“I don’t - I’m not-” Dean hangs his head, tears catching on his eyelashes. “I’m sorry, sir. I wanna be good. I wanna do this. I just can’t - I can’t think of things. I’m sorry.”
“I’m okay. Really.” I force a smile. I start to reach for my sandwich with the intention of taking a small bite to prove to Benny that I really am okay, but I quickly pull my hand back when I realize how badly it’s shaking.
Rendered speechless, Castiel just nods to show his understanding. He wraps his little fingers around the large, throbbing member and brings his tongue to the tip. The sticky substance coming from his alphas slit is different than he expected. Different in a very good way. It's salty but sweet, and the bunny boy thinks it could very quickly become his favorite snack. He coos in appreciation, making his alpha laugh.
"Alright little bro." Gabe pauses the movie, then pries the box of Milk Duds out of Castiel’s hands. Castiel looks up at him with eyes full of tears, and Gabe is honestly shocked that the kid has any tears left in him. “You need to talk to Dean.”
When Jimmy sees Sam for the first time, their hands touching as they shake them in greeting, something jolts along Jimmy’s spine. For the briefest of moments, he’s in a red and black room, screams in the background, a foggy figure speaking words he can’t quite make out. With a gasp, Jimmy lets go and stumbles back from him.
Dean must have forgotten all about the cock ring Castiel had pulled out because he startles when Castiel slides it on him, his green eyes snapping wide open. He whines under his breath and shifts his hips. Clearly, he’s not impressed.
The whole never talking about it again thing works for nearly a month. School starts. Classes begin. There’s Dean, taking a heavy course load and working doubles at the bar, and Castiel, going to school part time but working two jobs and apprenticing as a tattoo artist on the side. They barely even see each other. Most nights, one of them is already passed out by the time the other stumbles in.
"Austin is a great city. I've been there a few times." Dean brings the cloth across Castiel's collarbone, drawing little circles down his chest after. "I'll bring you when you're feeling better. We can go to a festival."
I clean Dean up and carefully remove the knot from his hole before lying down beside him, this time with sweatpants on. I grin as he immediately turns towards me in his sleep, wrapping around me like a koala. He releases a happy little sigh and my decision solidifies.
Dean’s already starting to leak a puddle of precum against his stomach, something Castiel quickly notices when he moves his hand back up to rub his cock some more. “You’re making quite the mess, little slut.”
“He might come. He could jack off. Make his boy suck him off. Or, he might wait until later. This might be all about his sub tonight. He’ll do this scene, give his sub a great scene, take care of him after, and then when he’s free, he’ll deal with himself if he still has a need to.”
A sudden rage overwhelms me, a fire that burns its way through my veins until I feel the urge to throw my head back and scream. Or howl.
There’s a long stretch of nothing but wet dicks getting touched, but then Castiel surprises him by answering. “Me on that fu - m - machine. While you watch.”
Dean takes a photo with his phone, already looking forward to when he will get to show the boy later. Castiel will blush so damn hard at the sight of himself like this.
is here now. You can go,” Castiel says from the doorway, startling the two of us. I look over to find him standing in the doorway, hands pushed into the pockets of his jeans, his flannel sleeves rolled to his elbows. He leans a shoulder against the doorframe and arches an eyebrow at Anna.
His expression crumbles, and the sadness that saturates the air around us and echoes inside my chest is so thick and heavy I can barely breathe beneath it all. “Dean, that’s not at all what you’d be.”
Our thread hums with a peacefulness I’ve never felt. He must feel it too because he releases a breathy sigh and smiles.
“Cas, you couldn’t control who you were raised to be. You were basically raised in a box where your father was law.”
Castiel leans his elbows on the countertop, clasping his hands together. He studies his best friend for a few moments, turning everything over in his mind, trying to make connections. Then he finds himself sporting a stupid grin on his face. “Oh god. It’s Sam, isn’t it?”
“Oh. Okay.” Jimmy feels his stomach flutter and he realizes he finds guys cute. This guy at least. The jury is still out as far as his ‘label’ or whatever goes, but Dean Winchester is definitely pushing all the right buttons for him. “Well, Dean, I’d really like that.”
"No. It's not - he's - I don't want him here right now. I'm good. I'm fine. Just-" Castiel stares down at the table, surprised to find that the menu is gone.
His eyes pull away from mine, focusing on the part of my neck he had used to drive me out of my mind. He straightens my shirt. Gently guides me off of his lap. Nudges my lunch towards me with his hand in the same way the wolf had nudged my bag with its nose.
“I couldn’t care less. Plus, I locked it when I got inside, so screw any boy who tries to get in.” She winks at me, but I don’t have the energy to conjure up a smile or laugh. It doesn’t seem to bother her though as she sinks to the dirty floor to sit beside me. “Not feeling so good, hey?”
It’s quite similar to the example sir used but it seems like sir’s fine with it. All he demands is, “More.”
"I think that I want you to be happy and healthy, and these meds might help, but there are also a shit ton of other pills out there, so if you want to not take them anymore, then I think you shouldn't. Dr. Warren can try you with something else."
The man is younger than Dean had thought he'd be. No older than early 20s. He's hanging by his wrists from the ceiling's restraint system, his tiptoes grazing the cold cement ground. Water is pooled at his feet and his hair is damp, but he's been down here long enough for the rest of the cold water on his body to evaporate. It's a shame the system doesn't allow the room to go beneath freezing temperatures. Maybe Dean should install a meat locker. He wonders if that'd be fun to use. Surely for the ones that stay longer than just a few hours. Hell, maybe even Castiel would be into temperature play. Mmm. That would be fun. Get the boy freezing cold, then overwhelm him with the heat of Dean's mouth and fingers and cock. Maybe some hot wax. He'd whimper so beautifully.
Castiel didn’t come into this room planning to hurt himself, he swears, but his eyes fall on Dean’s razor blades, and he reaches for them. It’s like he’s on auto-pilot. He falls into the routine, letting it wrap around him like a security blanket.
I dig my nails into the dirt and grumble low in my throat, unable to stop myself from imagining Dean getting raped and hurt.
Since he’s madly in love with Castiel, Dean goes easy on him. He loosens his grip on the bunny’s hair and starts guiding him back until he can breathe easier. When the cock pops out of his mouth, Castiel looks up at Dean with glazed eyes and a spit-slick smile.
He shrugs, looking away from me as if the darkness isn't enough cover. Instead of answering my question, he gets off the bed and crosses the room. I watch as he disappears into the bathroom, closing the door behind himself.
I don't ask how he knows that. Our thread has been growing again. Strengthening. I’ve been pretending that I don’t like it.
“Oh my god.” I bury my face in my hands and groan, wishing I could die on the spot. My response makes Uncle Bobby bark a laugh. I can’t decide if I’d rather him just yell at me instead. This might be worse. “Am I in trouble?”
He winks to show he’s just messing around, and I laugh. It feels good. Normal. “I’ll get right on that.”
"We are." Castiel presses a kiss to the top of his head before sighing softly. It's a sigh of content, surprisingly. Dean loves the sound of it. "I'm ready whenever you are, green eyes."
Dean doesn't say anything, which Castiel takes as a win. The two of them sit in silence for a much longer period of time. Minutes pass as they just enjoy the sound of the other breathing.
Unfortunately, no one else decides to leave Dean alone. For the next hour, Dean's forced to deal with a constant stream of people. Some act like they're his best buddy even though he swears he's never seen them before. Others just stop to say hello. Quite a few try to flirt or get him to join them in a secluded area to
That's when Dean lets himself into the dressing room, eyes soft, expression kind but concerned. "Hey baby boy."
“No. That’s what I’m trying to say, son. It hasn’t been triggered yet. He hasn’t been around us long enough. He’s still unpresented.”
"Look at me." Dean releases a breath of relief and lifts his chin until his gaze meets Castiel's. When Castiel gives him an encouraging smile, Dean matches it. He even puffs up a bit with pride and confidence, probably able to see in the way Castiel is looking at him that Castiel is extremely pleased. "Thank you for submitting to me, Dean. I hadn't expected you to kneel for me tonight. You doing so makes me feel very honored. I want you to know I understand how big this is for you and I appreciate your trust in me. You are such a good, sweet boy for me. More perfect than I can express. Thank you for your control."
“Language,” dad says mildly, sounding bored. It’s more of an obligation for him. He’s just backing mom's rules. “And that’s what happens when you meet yours. Your whole world flips upside down.”
Dean releases a pent-up sigh. “I never expected this, Ben. Out of all the issues that could pop up, all of the things that he and I would have to work through, this wasn’t it. I never thought I had to protect him from himself.”
There’s a bondage chair that he checks out next. It’s a lot different than the one in the testing room but still close enough to the one in the black room at the compound that Dean turns away from it too. He had enough time to notice it was the same dark walnut finish and burgundy padding as the bench.
Dean runs a fingertip down Castiel’s spine, making a decision. One more round of pain. Then? Then pleasure. So much pleasure. Until he fucking explodes.
Finally - fucking finally - my boy releases a deep sigh, and our thread softens with relief. His breathing slows and steadies, his eyes fluttering closed. He sniffles when I reach up to his stomach where his three rounds of cum are now mixed with my own spend. I gently rub the warm substance into his skin, smiling when it makes him shudder and coo. He’ll be disgusted when this is over. I can already see his bright red face all scrunched up as he asks, “You rubbed cum into me?!? Like lotion!?!” It doesn’t matter, though, because this is biology. He needs my cum. If he can’t have it in his hole, this and his mouth are the next best thing.
The hand continues moving, stroking him in calming motions. "I know, but anything. Even something in our own kitchen if you'd like. You need food for your pills."
When Castiel looks at the man, he finds Benny looking right back at him. The two stare for a few seconds before Benny gestures to the door. "Go on. It's not me he wants to see."
A growl rips its way through my throat as my body leans forward on instinct. I have to force myself stumbling back to keep from lunging for them. They’re trying to rile me up. I won’t let them. Not while Dean is here.
"Okay. The store. We can do that. Yes. The store." He looks off in the distance as he thinks. "I think there's a grocery store on the main road. About 20 miles south."
“Is that it?” Dean asks, amused by the question. When Castiel nods, Dean chuckles. It’s dark and menacing. Castiel’s entire body shudders in response. “Oh sweetheart, we’re just gettin’ started.”
"I was going to lay you on your stomach and whip you with my belt, but now I don't trust you not to rub your needy little cock against the sheets. Too much of a selfish little slut." Castiel grabs Dean's thighs and yanks him closer, then uses his momentum to flip Dean. The boy cooperates and already knows from Castiel's words what position Castiel wants him in. When he gets up on his hands and knees, Castiel smacks his right ass cheek before patronizingly patting it. "There's a good little slut."
The stranger’s eyes fall on me as he says in a startlingly calm, cold voice, “If he is, then it’s most certainly my business. All of ours.”
“Want to know what’s even crazier?” When Jimmy nods, the Lieutenant says, “I’m out too. My contract’s up. I’m going home in two days.”
Leaning close enough where he's at risk of falling in, Dean whispers, "So? Do you want me to spank you?"
“Good boy. Such a good boy.” Something slides along Castiel’s lips and it takes him a moment to realize what it is. He startles, then pushes forward like a damn puppy chasing a treat. Sir is kind enough to help him out, guiding Castiel until their mouths are together. Then sir holds him still and just… takes. It’s sloppy and heated and Castiel can barely even breathe, but he doesn’t care about that either. Not an ounce.
He feels the smack of leather against his skin. He feels the hot tears on his cheeks. He feels the moans rumbling in his chest. He feels the heavy weight of the gag on his tongue.
“It’s okay,” Dean promises, just now noticing that the douchebag has taken his black vest off. His tie is removed and the first two buttons on his collared shirt are undone, revealing a tanned chest. His hair is slightly mussed now.
through our shared thread. I breathe through my anger, feeling conflicted. Feeling as if I’m being pulled in too many directions. I need to be near Dean, but I need to be running under the moon right now too. I need to have this talk with my dad, but I need to be a wolf. I need to be there for my… for
“I like your attitude.” Dean pauses mid-laugh, his eyes locking on something over my shoulder. His smile freezes before melting into a look of confusion and… fear? Our thread vibrates with anxiety hard enough to make it echo in my chest.
Dean ignores all of Castiel’s calls and texts, so Castiel resorts to cornering him at school. He manages to do it when Dean’s walking down one of the outer halls of the school, the one that only brings you to woodshop and art, the one that’s quiet and secluded.
Whiskey. Jimmy recognizes that. It’s alcohol. Something he has yet to try since coming home. He somehow knows that it makes people foggy, and can even cause loss of memory. Jimmy doesn’t need any extra help with that.
“Ooooh.” Castiel bucks in his restraints but then quickly presses back for more. So much more. “Feels fuckin’ fantastic.”
Castiel bumps into someone, the impact jarring him from his memories. He blinks up to find Charlie smiling down at him.
A hand rests on his hip, then slowly begins to travel up his sides. It's so seductive, and Castiel isn't even naked. A low chuckle makes Castiel finally release that moan he's been holding in.
Sir yanks Dean back and mirrors the couple on the screen, nipping at Dean's earlobe while choking him out. The TV goes fuzzy, and his ears ring.
“Yes what?” he asks, tapping the cane just a little harder to remind him what will happen if he lies.
My dad and Bobby are sitting at the kitchen island when I enter it, both hunched over their drinks, speaking in low voices. I tune their words out even though I’d easily be able to hear them. They stop talking anyway, their focus shifting to me. I can feel their eyes tracking my every move as I collect things.
“I doubt it.” Dean squeezes his eyes shut. “John said he won’t let Sammy near me if I don’t choose them over you.”
By the time Dean goes to collect his boy for the party, he's suffering from a migraine and riddled with guilt.
"You still awake?" Dean whispers. Castiel hums a sleepy affirmative. "I think I want to talk about everything. The compound. J-Jimmy. All of the stuff we've been skirting around."
They go on like this for the rest of dinner, Castiel feeding Dean and giving him sips of water, and Dean humming in pleasure and thanking him. By the time both plates are empty, Dean's half-asleep against Castiel's thigh. Between the public outing, the tense discussion regarding kids, and the time change, his boy is wiped out.
“Alright, let’s get you cleaned up, hmm? Maybe get you a drink? Then we can nap.” Dean knows Castiel isn’t listening but he knows many submissives still subconsciously hear their dom. It’s more of a comfort thing.
“Oh.” Castiel grabs his glass of wine, draining it of every last drop. It can’t be a good sign. Maybe they shouldn’t go tonight. Maybe Charlie was wrong and they need more time. Maybe - “I’m afraid of embarrassing you.”
. The taste. The texture. The smell. It’s like being wrapped up in him. Castiel’s eye roll behind the blindfold as he begins to suck. He thinks there's a good chance he somehow died and went to heaven.
“Well,” Castiel says, licking his very dry mouth. “He’s definitely more attractive that his father was.”
“Our old alpha went about things wrong. He thought if he let Michael mate your daddy, then your daddy would become pack property. When he realized Michael didn’t plan on sharing, he rushed into things. He didn’t
“I love how little this is,” I admit, pressing up close behind him so I can whisper in his ear. He shudders and moans. “My pretty little omega with his pretty little omega cock.”
The man in chains obeys, arching his back as he splatters cum across Dean's front. He cries out in ecstasy.
It takes a second for Castiel to realize the spanking stopped. His wrists are gently freed. Then his mouth. The plug turns off. His pants are pulled up. He’s brought back to his feet, sir’s hands resting on his shoulders to make sure he doesn’t fall. The bullet is taken from his hand.
Stepping forward, Castiel pins Dean to the locker beside his own. “I’m not being naive. I’m fighting for our relationship. Someone has to, since you’re just giving up! I’m going to fix this. We’re going to make this work.”
“Hush!” Dean barks, smacking Castiel’s right ass cheek three times in rapid succession. It makes his boy squirm and sob.
"To before everything got so intense. Like the football game and the party. Talking. Getting to know each other. Flirting." He shrugs, avoiding eye contact. "Back to normal."
It's his third day in the hospital and they still haven't been able to get Jimmy to remember a damn thing. He knows how to speak. Knows the names of everything. He understands how things work. Is aware of bodily needs and functions. He has all of the knowledge a man in his 20s should have, but when it comes to anything personal, anything at all, it's just… blank. A void in his head that he keeps trying to swim through, only to wind up exhausted and drowning.
I’m suddenly regretting letting this conversation get this far. “It wasn’t about you. Don’t worry about it.”
“Still haven’t finished that, hey?” Dean asks as he sits down at the table across from Castiel. Before Castiel gets the chance to hide the paper, Dean gets a good look at it. His understanding smile slips into something concerned. “You haven’t written
The two of them laugh softly in relief. Castiel speaks first afterwards, though it takes him a few minutes of just sitting in silence with Dean in his arms. "If it's what you truly want to do, I'll respect it. But I have to be honest, I don't think it'll be good for us. The more we try to act normal, the more we're going to feel like we're
Speechless and panicking a little, Castiel looks over at Dr. Edlund with wide eyes. Thankfully, the doctor doesn't decide to be a dick and go silent like he sometimes does when he wants Castiel to work something out on his own.
“And I spent two years failing,” Sam says dryly. “Failing at the mission your abuser who you claimed
"Shhh, now. You're not bad. You're good. So very good for me, Dean. You just did one bad thing and now it's over, remember? It's all over now. No more worrying about it."
Since he asked that like a question, Castiel answers it by standing in place and pointing the rest of the things he finds important out. “That tucked in the corner over there is a cage used for puppy play. The chest beside it has other accessories and tools for it.”
