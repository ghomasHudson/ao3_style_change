“What are you doing back here?” John looked around at the empty room. “You picked the farthest possible point from everyone else.”
The last daylight finally vanished entirely. John could see a few points of light far above him, a moon and stars placed there by the Capitol. It grew colder, but not unbearably so. They had had bad winters in the district before, and he had survived those. It was better to be cold than to give yourself away with fire. And for once, John was grateful that he was used to the sensation of hunger. It would make suffering the barren arena a little easier.
As they neared the Capitol the next morning, Sherlock watched John stare out at the skyline. John was trying to not be enthusiastic, but Sherlock could see how impressed he was. Sherlock sat sulking in one of the easy chairs, wishing the train ride would last longer. He wasn't looking forward to the crowds that would be waiting for them at the station, the crowds that would instantly decide which tribute from District 12 they were going to root for. Sherlock knew Adler was right, but he couldn't just turn himself into someone else to suit the masses.
He wanted the crowd to part like the Red Sea. Wanted to eliminate anything standing between them. Wanted to say
They came to a stop on the pavement. Sherlock watched him curiously, his face cut by the lamplight, his eyes briefly running over John's face, his own expression almost sad.
She shrugged, reaching for the backpack and pulling out a couple of packages. “I originally wanted to be a healer, like you, back in the district. But there were always more dead people than living ones, so I ended up working on them instead, when I wasn't in the factories. But the basics are still there, even though I never got a chance to use them much.” She smiled a little. “I've worked with dead people a lot. I'm glad you weren't one of them.”
He paused, trying to cover up what John imagined was an innate awkwardness. “Well. I couldn't be certain about your reaction, could I?”
I wish I could tell you that there was some dark, horrible crisis that first led me to drugs. But in the end, it was only boredom. I had nothing in my life, no one. There was no entertainment or distraction. So I created my own. I won't try to justify it either. It was idiotic. But you never quite realise it at the time.
“I've never found space to be unfeeling, Sherlock, so I can't help you there. Perhaps consult a mathematician like your mother, something along those lines. Why, as a poet, you even expect to find an answer at all is beyond me. Poets only observe. They don't answer.”
Molly signed off on some paperwork before leaving, and as soon as she was out the door, Sherlock was standing in his usual spot by the head of John's bed, looking down at him, hands shoved in his pockets. He couldn't seem to look at John for long. His eyes were darting nervously around the room, never settling on any one place.
"The feeling is mutual, I assure you." Sherlock sat back and searched John's eyes for any hint that he was in for another wild punch tonight. But there was a placid calm on his face, and Sherlock knew that while morning would bring clarity, and with it, no doubt, some amount of argument and anger, that in that single moment, all that passed between them was shared affection and relief. Which was why Sherlock decided that the night was worth one more emotional risk, and so reached out to take John's face in his hands and kiss him. Sherlock felt a hand rest at the base of his neck, pulling him closer. He didn't even think of resisting. A few moments later, in a breathless whisper, he said, "I've wanted to do that for
The news continued to refer to John as Sherlock Holmes' partner, and while the ambiguity of the word had felt like a taunt after Sherlock's “death,” it didn't anymore.
While the town was beautiful in its way, something about it was suspended in a state of gloom, no doubt perpetuated by the gray, sulky English skies that rarely even broke into sun during the warmest summer months.
Sherlock would have killed for a mirror. Mirrors had always been one of his least favorite things, as they showed him the only thing he didn't want to see: himself. But tonight he wanted one, just so he could adjust his own facial expression accordingly, just to make sure that it wasn't written on his face as he felt it surely was. But then, John's face was only barley concealed starvation as well. It was easier to stare down your own desperation through someone else's face.
“John, I already got you out of enough of them. What is the point of being an author if you refuse to do the tours? You have to promote your work.” John could hear Ella's exasperation through the phone. He hit the speakerphone button and leaned his head on his hands.
John jumped, and immediately regretted doing so when he felt the pain that came with moving. "What?"
? Please. It's a naïve notion that people can maintain meaningful and sincere interactions with each other over long periods of time. Mike is an acquaintance I know through my chosen field. I do not have friends.”
John froze, the tension leaving his shoulders. Sherlock wore a challenge on his face. The challenge seemed more and more blatant the longer the silence stretched on.
"Nice is boring. I do hate these social summons. I see these people often enough. There's no reason to see even more of them." He turned back to his laptop.
He could have said anything, something poetic and meaningful, something apologetic. But instead, he grinned, and said, “Come to tell me who Harry is?”
Then the anger vanished. John sat down, his back leaning against the headstone. He rested his arms on his knees and stared up at the sky, his eyes partially glazed over. "Except I don't. That's the problem, Sherlock. I don't hate you at all. I never did. Just the opposite. And that makes it so much worse."
He tuned out most of the talking, turning his eyes to the book in his hand, the pages yellowed with age. These were the best kinds of books. They felt more real, more grounded. All Sherlock had ever used newer books for was to take on long trips because he didn't care if he lost them. Hardback, cloth, green cover with a tattered yellow spine, dust jacket long since gone. An edge of the cover was a bit discolored, like its original owner had spilled coffee on it, but that didn't matter. It had the poem in it.
Sherlock had been thinking over the possible outcomes of the Games. The most likely one was that they would both die, and relatively soon. But he wondered what would happen if it came down to the two of them, or even if they happened across each other in the arena. Would John be able to kill him? Would John really be able to kill anyone? He was a healer after all. Of course, Sherlock knew what people were capable of when it came down to life or death. The bigger question on his mind was would he be able to kill the healer if it came to that? Sherlock, while forbidding, had never killed anyone, and wasn't keen on starting. But he supposed he would do what he had to do to survive, just like anyone else.
“Well, you seem a bit glum, and we haven't taken a real trip together yet. It could be fun, get London out of our lungs for a while.”
– but he was far too tired to care about his assumptions. “About them calling you and Mycroft in on the Hickman case.”
"Clearly." John heard the voice coming from the corner of the room, still sounding slightly distracted. Sherlock had stayed? John had been sure his being there the first time was a fluke. He'd never imagined he'd be here now. "I've temporarily relocated. Blessedly, the hospital has wifi."
“You mean you don't know? Seriously?” She looked between the two of them, laughing a little to herself. “Well, you two should be having an interesting conversation later, then. Long story short, Sherlock, I need to finish what my late boss started, and John is making that very difficult for me.”
Night came quickly in the winter light, slanting sharply through the trees and casting shadows that tricked John's eyes more than once. He had walked all afternoon, feeling like if he stopped he would be found, but he knew walking through the night was not an option. When he found the fallen trees, he took it as a sign. It was a better shelter than he could probably make, and though it offered little space, it offered plenty of camouflage. John could see out well enough, but only very specific angles would allow anyone passing to see in. And while that wasn't ideal, it was better than nothing in an arena that offered very little cover.
“Be more careful next time. No more abandoned houses.” The boy set about checking his eyes, reflexes, looking him over and asking if he could move all his extremities. Sherlock winced more than once. “In pain, I imagine. I'm afraid there's not much we can do for that right now. You'll just have to get some rest.”
Finally everything was the way it was supposed to be, the way it should have been within a week of them meeting each other. Everything was obvious in retrospect.
John hardly remembered any of what they saw at the crime scene. Instead he stood by on the brink of panic, speaking only when asked a direct question, trying to resist the urge to run. It was irrational to worry, since they had no idea who he was, but something primal inside him still worried all the same, filling his head with ridiculous visions of arrests and interrogations.
John laughed a little under his breath, still watching Sherlock, who continued to stare out in front of him.
Mycroft was waiting for them, standing beside a glass coffee table with his usual smug expression. He greeted both of them, but only John replied, and even then, tersely. His patience for Mycroft was not lengthy on the best of days, and lately his involvement with the Hickman case had made his patience even shorter. Mycroft treated it as the most important thing on earth when all John wanted to do was close the case and forget about it.
“Well, not all of us can physically go to space, of course,” Cairns said, moving constellations around on the ceiling above her. “So it's a decent substitute. And I like knowing that the children who come walk away with an appreciation for the universe. Their eyes light up like you wouldn't believe. It makes my science accessible to regular people.”
Sherlock scoffed at the adjective, but he smiled to himself since John couldn't see him do it. "It's structurally sound." He'd been playing the piece in his head for hours, and was pleased to hear that it sounded precisely as he had intended it to.
"I swear, John. You should never be on pain medication. You've a normal person's mind, slow enough as it is, and drugs seem to slow it down to a downright glacial pace."
God forbid they ever find out he had been present that night. Hiding this fact was more an admission of guilt than a direct lie would have been. If they ever found out he had been at the Hickman, they would start asking questions. And then not even Sherlock Holmes would be able to stop them.
“I ended up a novelist by accident, honestly. I had never planned on doing anything serious with my writing. It was just something to do. When I came back from Afghanistan I realized I didn't really know what to say to anyone, so I just started keeping to myself and writing my own conversations.”
sat on his coffee table in Baker Street, ready and waiting, and his hands were already typing out the name “John Watson” on his computer.
exactly, but the longer he sat at the restaurant with him, the more he thought that maybe it didn't matter
He was halfway back when he heard a crashing in the woods. Seconds later, a man burst through the trees, stopping when he saw John's gun pointed at him. The man hadn't come quietly, blundering and nervous. He was wearing glasses, one lens cracked. Mike.
“No, but I've certainly observed enough human interactions to have cataloged quite a bit of information on the subject.”
Clara refused to entertain any of his father's snide remarks. She had always been a kill-them-with-kindness sort of girl. She was the only one of them John was genuinely happy to see, and he allowed himself to be wrapped up in her arms without resistance.
“Hello, Watson.” Who knew how long Sholto had been standing silently in the doorway, who knew what all he'd heard. But John was struck immediately by the lightness with which he carried himself, rather than looking like a man taking his last steps before falling over dead. Subdued still, yes, as always, but happier. “You're looking better than when I last saw you.”
,” he said, far too sharply. Sane men didn't snap at their girlfriends when they were only trying to help.
“Don't poets write entire collections of poetry as a dedication to someone? Like the Brownings? Aren't they the ones who wrote all those sonnets to each other?”
When he was resting at home later that day, Sherlock heard more about the accident at the mines from his mother's friends as they came to talk about it and inquire after Sherlock's well being. And as hard as he tried, he couldn't imagine the blond boy covered in blood from the coal dust tinged bodies of miners.
“A detail. Coming?” John followed. They stepped out into the cold night, an abrupt but not unpleasant shock. “I play the violin. I hope that won't be a problem.”
Sherlock sat down at the edge of the treeline, just enough to not be in plain sight, and rubbed at his eyes. He would get something to drink in a minute when he didn't feel so damn miserable. Was this what normal people felt like all the time? So scattered and useless?
John had grown used to Sherlock picking out details of his life. On the one hand, it could be infuriating, but on the other, at least he never had to make small talk about himself. “If I find you a violin will you quit trying to take apart my laptop?”
He had told himself over and over that no one knew he was at the Hickman the night of the explosion. But there was one person, wasn't there? One person who knew. The man in the white shirt, the one who had been staring at the proceedings with such fascination. The one he had even gone so far as to speak to in his mentally addled state.
John sighed. "I have explained this to you so many times this week. I'm not doing it again unless you're actually going to listen."
“Because it's one of the most important cases in recent history, and yet they gave it to you all. They really should just hand it over to the higher-ups. It would save you the trouble and likely get it solved quicker.” John heard Lestrade sigh in frustration, a reaction he believed Lestrade was well used to having to Sherlock's remarks. And while his comment was rather harsh, it successfully stopped any unfortunate line of inquiry that could have arisen.
Unfortunately, perhaps, so were most of their friends, including Mary. John had said multiple times that they weren't together, and that appeared to be true, given how they were interacting with each other. John didn't show her any more attention than he did Sally or Molly.
Sherlock could draw him so easily, but he couldn't sculpt him. Why was it so much more difficult? It wasn't as if he didn't know every detail of his face and body. Sherlock was even beginning to feel like he had a better grip on The Man than he did on himself.
Sherlock waved a hand to the coffee table before ripping the last of the clay to pieces, dropping it in front of him as if he had no energy left to properly ruin it. “Rough concept art for the painting over there.”
Sherlock looked around the room. It was someone's home, but this room had been set up as a makeshift clinic. There were little hints of what passed for medicine all over: syringes, cloths, various plants, and occasional vials or bottles of highly coveted medication. Sherlock was laid out on a hard wooden table, no doubt one that was originally intended for dining.
Sherlock let the sentence hang in the air, making an active effort to not give himself away in his expression. “I know that poem all too well. And perhaps desperate is an accurate assessment. Auden had his fair share of things to agonize over. If you were going to have a brutal introduction into poetry, you could have done far worse. At least you didn't just start with Shakespeare sonnets like everyone else does.”
“No, you didn't, you idiot. Come here.” He grabbed Sherlock's scarf, pulling him down to his level, and kissed him. Sherlock's hands cupped his face, drawing him as close as he could. And it still wasn't close enough.
John glanced in the direction of his bedroom, wishing he'd carried his gun with him that morning. Not moving from his place in the doorway he said, “Who are you, and what are you doing in my flat? How did you get in here?”
It was late when he arrived, exhausted and almost irritated at the grinning face of the hotel owner behind the front desk. How could anyone be so goddamn chipper at this hour in a place remote enough that one could hear sheep from the front porch?
The driver pointed out good restaurants and shops, highlighting his favorites, telling him all the points of interest that small towns like Bell Song always have.
But he had to have it on paper, a physical form, something he could glare at whenever he felt the need.
And how the hell was he supposed to sit around and answer questions and sign books when he could be somewhere else, somewhere with candlelight and vacant pavement? The black and white of text messages wasn't enough, though he found himself surprised that he wanted more than that at all.
But Sherlock could not look on the drawing with love. All it did was frustrate him. Because while the man was an ideal audience, he was also a figment of his imagination. No amount of Sherlock creating back story and personality would change that.
Sherlock didn't have the time or the energy to respond. He picked up his tools and resumed his work without regarding Mycroft at all.
Sherlock watched him for a moment with an appraising look before breaking out into a smile that John believed bordered on predatory. He began to wonder if he'd made a mistake in coming here, if the younger Holmes brother was some sort of madman. But he couldn't make himself leave.
Sherlock looked up at him, grey eyes mostly obscured by dark pupils. "It's a rare occasion that I improve a situation as opposed to ruining it."
“I haven't been able to go back to any of the museums since,” she said, laughing a little. “I suppose that's not surprising.”
And the most unnerving, three: There was someone else on this earth who shared this ability with him.
John opened his mouth to speak, and Mycroft cut him off, turning to Sherlock. “John decided to open fire on the judges.”
“I'm going to go see what I can find, if anything. Otherwise I'll have to resort to reading on my phone. But listen, Sherlock, when I get back, I want to see you. I really do. Not drunk, not delirious. I need you to understand that. Do you?”
"I thought you and the dull nurse could have an evening out over the holidays. I know you wanted to see that one movie that came out a while back, what was it?"
“I wish Mycroft and I didn't speak sometimes,” he said, a small smile on his lips, a joking attitude.
Glass rained down on them as the lights shattered. Some of them yelped or screamed. They were thrown into half darkness, in partial silhouette from the one intact light in the very back. They stood in the shadows, finally quiet. Some of them stared at him, mouths hanging open. He was sure they thought he was terribly rude, no doubt an insult to their Capitol manners. But he gave no apologies, and he laid the gun back on the table, and left the room without another word.
Something was off. The way she looked around Baker Street was wrong. Much more like the way Sherlock would look at a crime scene. Is that how she saw this place? A crime scene? A place responsible for derailing a piece of her life? Her detached, meticulous visual examination of the rooms fell always on the details. The ashes in the fireplace, the dishes and mugs still sitting on the kitchen counter top above the cabinet that would never quite close correctly, the edges of the sofa, the dusty spines of Sherlock's books. When John visited people's houses, he always took in things with a cursory manner – there's the table, the sofa, the television – not with such attention to things that ultimately didn't matter. If she had wanted to fixate on the details that meant something, she could have examined the nicks in the mantlepiece where Sherlock had knifed it, the test tube tucked in with the rest of the dishes, the glimpse of a cluttered dresser in the bedroom, the dressing gown hanging on the back of a door. But she didn't seem to see any of that.
A while later, John emerged from his room, dressed, but looking very confused, and almost scared. He pinched the bridge of his nose, a simple gesture to give himself a moment before speaking. Sherlock stopped playing.
“You've always been a good man, John. But that's not going to help you now. Remember, when you're in that arena, the people you see there aren't people anymore. They're animals. And we hunt animals. Don't let your healer sympathies get in the way of protecting yourself.”
"Yeah. Well, remember last Christmas? Jeanette, the one you called the boring teacher? She said I was a good boyfriend, and then she said 'Sherlock Holmes is a very lucky man.' We split because she felt like she was competing with you."
She stood in the doorway, nodding, her hands in her pockets. “If you're not careful, the whole London criminal underbelly will get in.”
The world was a noisy place, and unfortunately, that made things rather hard on a jumpy, traumatized soldier. No one quite seemed to understand that, friends coming up and clapping him on the back unannounced, startling him, people dragging him to action movies that were packed with explosions, everyone speaking in such loud voices that every tiny noise seemed thirty times louder, every clink of silverware, every phone, every car engine, all of it deafening and exhausting.
She had become so much worse after Clara died. Clara had worked in the black market for as long as John could remember. One day, there was a raid, and she had been one of the casualties. John had had to drag Harry away. The image of Clara's body being removed was still burned on both their brains.
“Sure,” she said knowingly. “Just a friend, then. Is that who you were talking to this morning? When the television was on?”
They took the route by Hyde Park on their way back. It was like being transported into a Christmas card. The snow crunching under their feet, the blue lights strung around the skeleton branches of the trees. Sherlock waited for John to talk again, to process everything. He was afraid he'd ruin things if he spoke.
“Not much, given that you seem to hardly exist despite being so visible. I've learned more from these conversations tonight than in all my efforts to find information online.”
"A dream version of me would have shown up a long time ago, if at all. Unfortunately the actual me has never been known for good timing."
When Molly walked into the lab early the following morning, she found Sherlock already at his usual place at the bench. He was preparing a set of petri dishes, but seemed too distracted to really accomplish anything.
It hung there between them, all they weren't saying, the elephant in the room that was that fevered kiss in Rome. Both of them were pretending like it had never happened, but both of them were painfully aware that it couldn't be avoided indefinitely.
Still, John couldn't help but make the effort to pretend that everything was fine. So Sherlock wasn't all that surprised when he walked over to stand by him on the edge of the room, looking out at all the other guests.
“I'm going to be out of town for a bit. Have to handle some family matters that have come up. Reschedule tomorrow for when I get back?”
He was enigmatic, rather intriguing, if John was being honest. He felt foolish, though, allowing any part of himself to be so taken with this stranger. But there was
There was a press conference on television later that night, headed by a curly-haired woman named Donovan and a DI named Lestrade. They talked about how the police were classifying the bombing as a terror strike, that threat levels in London were critical and that security would be tightened in what he called “vulnerable places” (other museums, major tourist attractions, government buildings). The police weren't sure who was to blame, and John got the impression that they were almost desperately grasping for leads in a case where no leads were likely to present themselves. They didn't even seem all that sure that it actually
“Well until it comes to that, we might as well be a team. We can survive a whole lot easier working together.”
Who knew where the night went, because before they knew it, it had reached that gray transition from night to dawn. Just yesterday these early morning hours had been a taunt, a cruel reminder, one last moment of unforgiving quiet before trying to survive the day. But this was the easiest early morning he could ever ask for, curled up next to someone he loved who loved him, half asleep and happier than he ever dreamed he'd be.
John couldn't look away from the lavender rose. He didn't understand how anyone, especially the man who created it, could look at it with so much hate.
He fired, startling the tributes and hitting the mine. But the shot hadn't set the mine off. The tributes looked around, confused, even scared for a moment, not knowing where the shot had come from. But then one of them turned and looked up, meeting his eyes. John froze, the man opening his mouth to speak, but jerking his head around when he heard the hissing noise.
He looked around at the walls of the gallery. Some of the paintings were mostly intact, obviously farther away from the blast site. Some walls had been so totally ruined that there was no hope for the art that had hung on them. All that art, blown to pieces.
One day John finally saw him outside, skulking over toward Irene's house. He stopped, locking eyes with John for a few seconds. Sherlock was the one to look away. He did it so easily that John almost believed that everything he had said was true, even though John had his doubts. It had felt more like a coping mechanism than honesty.
“No, it keeps your mind numb. You'll end up dead that way. So should I tell him? I don't think your sweet little healer would be very pleased with you.” Sherlock crossed his arms and sank a little deeper into his seat. “Do you know the big problem with a disguise, Mr. Holmes? However hard you try, it's always a self-portrait.”
Across the room, as the breeze pulled at the filmy curtains swirling at the open French doors, Sherlock's phone buzzed on the side table. Over and over the little sound escaped it, but the two of them ignored it.
One night, John was lying awake on his bed, recently jolted out of sleep by a particularly violent nightmare, when he felt the now familiar internal twist of the second person stopping the world. In between strained and panicked breaths, John silently thanked the stranger. He needed the world to be still and silent for a while, and was unable to focus enough to do it himself. They couldn't know how much he'd needed this, of course, but he still felt so much less alone in that one moment, where he was one of only two people moving in the world. The pause in time gave him just long enough to regain some semblance of calm and mental stability before he heard the cars outside his window again, and the second person went about whatever business had them awake like him.
John could feel Sherlock's eyes on him, staring him down, but not in a cruel or patronizing way. Finally he cleared his throat and said, “If you need anything, let me know. You remember what I told you about the phone?”
Sherlock watched him, but said nothing while John watched the picture flash against the sky. John almost spoke, but he didn't. He just let Sherlock observe him in silence. It was just as well. Because whatever he would have said, Sherlock surely already knew, as he always seemed to know.
Anthea had dressed him sleekly in all black, and if you couldn't see his eyes – the only splash of color he had – he looked sort of strange surrounded by all the Capitol flash and glitz. He was a single frame of black and white film spliced into a color reel.
SH: Because ultimately, the reader will think what the reader wants to think. All readers are biased from the start, regardless of their claims otherwise.
“What makes you think I didn't do this when I got back from Afghanistan? Let me tell you, it is very easy to let your life be ruled by what happened to you when it was something like
“Yeah, regrettably,” he said, and the man chuckled, thinking he was being deliberately sarcastic, rather than dead serious.
“I thought surely it wouldn't be too much of a distraction, even in the 1800s. It's unobtrusive enough.”
Sherlock had multiple greenhouses, and John had been in all of them except the smallest. When he was finally brought into it, he found himself rather surprised. This greenhouse was much less overgrown, neater, set up more like a laboratory. It was still crowded with all sorts of plants, of course, but there was a greater sense of order to it in comparison. All around its edges were daffodils of varying colors and sizes. John didn't even bother to ask how they were still in bloom so late in the year. He had come to blindly accept the fact that everything on the Holmes estate, including Sherlock, was an exception to every known rule.
John looked to Mike for backup, but Mike only said, “He does. He's been messing with things since I started talking to him.”
“Hmm.” Sherlock had already let his attention slip back to the television. John just shook his head as he walked by.
Sherlock began to smile before he could stop himself. “My name is Sherlock Holmes. Address of 221B Baker Street.”
John felt a strange sort of twisting inside him as the world stopped again, without his pleading. There had only been a lapse of less than half an hour since the first time it had happened. John was desperately stitching up one of the injured soldiers when he saw his blood had ceased flowing from the wound on his head. John, breathless, stitched faster, barely able to comprehend the implications. He was too consumed by his chances to save lives.
John stared at his glass, running a finger along its rim. “I guess I can't say anything about you and your zoo trip. One of my best memories from when I was a kid was when we started doing science material in school. I had this one teacher who really encouraged your interests, and when we did the unit on the human body, she saw how fascinated I was, and she gave me this big book to take home and read. It had those layers of pages, so you could put the muscles over the bones, the organs in the abdominal cavity, the skin over the entire body, things like that. And I thought it was the most amazing thing I'd ever seen. At the end of the year, she let me just keep the book. I still have it somewhere.” Unlike John, Sherlock was not quick enough, and when John looked up from his glass, he saw Sherlock watching him, a quiet sort of soft expression on his face.
Sherlock raised one hand up, a simple gesture of surrender. Kitty drew her weapon back just a little. He gave her a look that he hoped came across as resigned and hopeless, like he knew he would soon be dead. It pleased her.
John hated that neither of them had just said it. Although Sherlock did, in his way. Leave it to Sherlock Holmes to spring a kiss in a crisis, and then be incapable of living long enough to follow it up, not even long enough for John to ask
Sherlock threw open the kitchen door and set off into the back section of the estate. John paused in the doorway, looking at the land laid out in front of him that had not been visible from the road. The grass was overgrown in many places, completely missing in others. Some sections were overrun by English ivy and creeping thyme, choking out even the weeds that attempted to grow near them. John stepped carefully outside to follow Sherlock, turning as he walked through the vegetation to look back at the house behind him. The gray stone was broken up by purple, wisteria climbing up as far as it could. John stumbled walking backwards looking at it, and feeling rather like he had been dropped in a jungle, turned to catch up with Sherlock. He carefully dodged a menacing looking shrub covered in thorns that was beginning to push its way onto what passed for a path.
The atmosphere in Karachi was decidedly unpleasant. Hot and dry, and punctuated occasionally by distant shouting or gunfire. I focused instead on the crackle of the fire in front of me. I was intensely grateful for my plethora of mental files. Otherwise there would have been nothing to occupy my time.
John nodded, stepping aside for a pack of children racing past him in their Reaping day best. “All week, really. I mean, you know how little we've been able to bring in lately. There hasn't been enough lying around for her to trade it in for alcohol. I just want her to get through this day. Then I'll strap her down in bed if that's what it takes to get her some rest.”
“I didn't know who else to call. I want as few people to know about this as possible. Just talk to him, tell me if you think he's delusional.”
He grabbed the entire page in one fist, and in a fit of disdain with himself, he crushed it, throwing it across the room.
you're being sarcastic." He quickly and easily bandaged the cut and knelt back down on one knee in front of me, scrutinising his own work. He gave a slow shake of his head. "You are going to hurt like hell tomorrow."
And then he registered the bodies as he pushed himself up on his hands. Pieces of people lying everywhere, bits of skin and skull. Some bodies intact, eyes still wide open and staring at nothing, motionless. Some may have been unconscious, others may have been buried in the rubble, but all John could see were the haunted lifeless faces that seemed to greet him at every turn. Once or twice, the faces were familiar, men he'd known in Afghanistan who hadn't been as lucky as he was, and he had to shut his eyes, hands to his face, to make the images go away.
“No, you're not. You always say you're fine, but you aren't. Look what the Games did to Irene. Look what the Games have done to countless people over the years. You aren't immune to it any more than I am. You're pretending you are. And Sherlock, you can't survive like that. You can't keep pretending everything is fine.”
John shifted uncomfortably on his feet, his hand flexing at his side. “You need to get out of the house, Sherlock.”
She looked at him for a moment before staring at the ground, and after a while she did start singing, quietly, almost under her breath.
John wasn't quite sure he believed him, but still, he threw his bag in the back seat of the car. He had barely sat down in the passenger's seat before the car took off.
“Well,” John said, scoffing, “I don't know that that last one is really that important in the grand scheme of things. But I suppose it's nice to have a home.” When had his own glass become empty?
“Don't I know it. How did you ever manage to have girlfriends before? They must have gone crazy with this whole moody and quiet thing.”
“Well someone has to keep me from assaulting the man on forensics.” He grinned. “Though to be quite honest, you would likely be more help to me than most of the officers on the police force.”
“You tell me.” His face was so open, so incredibly unguarded that John swore it was the first time he'd ever actually
Sholto's house was large for one person, and remote, and the emptiness was palpable. John wished Sholto had a wife, a family, something,
Irene was late to dinner that evening, finally strolling in as she had on the train, with a sort of hazy look in her eyes. John had gone to ask her a question earlier, and walked in on her tying a tourniquet around her arm while holding a syringe between her teeth. She'd looked at him, waiting for him to speak, but he had just turned and walked away. Despite this, she seemed mostly coherent, and as she sat down at the table across from Mycroft, she cast a glance to Sherlock, who had been staring at his plate in silence, and said, “My my, aren't we surly this evening.”
“I don't know. She seems to have hung around for a good while, if you've had this argument as many times as you say. She may very well be in it for the long haul.”
John only ever thought about his gun now in the context of shooting serial killers or Chinese gangsters. He'd wished he'd been able to use one on Moriarty when he'd nearly killed them in the pool. And as much as he hated admitting it, he wouldn't have minded using one on Irene either. She was a risk, a complication. And John was not going to allow her to hurt Sherlock, not after all they'd been through.
When Sherlock finally let himself sleep nearly two days later, he dreamed of painting The Man. His dreams were all colors and life. The Man was not a sketch, but a human being. In the dream, he became real, walked right off the canvas and into Sherlock's arms. His voice was a hearth, and his touch, the fire that burned within it.
It wasn't as if he had stopped writing entirely. Quite the opposite, in fact. It was just that most of what he wrote ended up thrown into the fireplace at home. What was the sense in keeping something that was sub-par?
“Promise me you'll look after Harry while I'm gone. If anything happens to me and I don't come back, please take care of her.”
John knew sleep was unlikely. How could he rest wondering if someone would find him? He tried to form some sort of plan of survival, but his brain felt foggy from the rush of adrenaline that had finally overtaken him in the cornucopia. If the reality of his situation was affecting him this much, then what effect was it having on someone who relied so heavily on logic as Sherlock?
Sherlock leaned against the fence post and watched his new charge. He was a small man named John Watson, a doctor. He was well respected and liked by his fellow troops. Sherlock could see the war wearing on his face. He had seen some horrible things, no doubt. But in all honesty, Sherlock had had no cause to save John thus far. The man was perfectly capable of taking care of himself, very cautious, and there had been little action since Sherlock had arrived. He had spent most of his time avoiding his fellow angels, who kept attempting to make conversation with him during the slow days. Some of their charges had not been so lucky. Some of the men had gone into the nearest town a few days after he arrived, and only half had come back. Sherlock had watched as those angels disappeared, back to Heaven for a new assignment. They wouldn't be following their charges anymore.
He could see Ella in his peripheral vision, making the universal gesture of tapping on the face of her watch. She didn't come to all the signings, but perhaps his odd moods of late provoked her to be present more often, under the pretense of wanting to be
"No. A great many serious lacerations, some burns. On an internal bleeding watch for the blunt trauma. Dull."
“Don't we all look like a happy family.” She looked between them, smiling, completely ignoring Mycroft. “And how did your day go, dear?” She turned to John, mimicking an interested parent.
John rubbed his hands over his face, leaning forward in his seat to rest his elbows on his knees. “Christ, don't be happy for me, I'm fucking miserable.”
John laughed, glancing away for a second as he always did when something amused him. He shook his head, smiling at Sherlock. “It'll have to do, though, won't it?”
He never came up with answers, never could find any sort of rationality behind Moriarty's ideas. He only came to the conclusion that it would have been a blessing, just letting it all end in that room in Rome instead of
John smiled, reaching out for Sherlock's arm, dragging him into step as they walked down the sidewalk.
When John stepped off the train, he nearly tripped when his leg fell out from under him. He assured everyone he was fine, but he walked away trying to hide the limp.
John pulled the book from his pocket, smiling wearily. “Well, actually. Thank you. A friend of mine recommended it to me.”
But it was a bad idea, he told himself. There was no sense in thinking about these things after the two of them had been so stupid. There had been chances. So many chances. And they had missed all of them.
“Probably. But it's also a bit correct. The only thing that people don't tend to realize is that people in our positions don't choose to be attached to our sadness. It's just a fact of life. You can't escape certain things.”
He stopped to examine them, John walking a few more feet before he realized Sherlock wasn't following him anymore. Sherlock picked up one of the hats, a deerstalker, and looked it over disparagingly.
Sherlock watched Moriarty's body fall backwards, splashing as it hit the water, and then disappearing from view as it was pushed over the falls by the current.
“I just don't see the sense in you carrying on with that clinic work. You never seem very fulfilled by it.”
“It was a possibility. By Rome, as far as I knew, I was on a death mission. It was unlikely that there would have been any consequences.”
The ordeal had lasted long into the night, hours and hours of tense jittery nerves and the Roman heat suffocating the crowds outside the gallery. Of course, everyone had thanked Sherlock for figuring it out, but he hardly heard them. He was still more concerned with the text messages on his phone, still coming at steady intervals. Even after the crisis was over, the texts kept coming, still naming names. It had Sherlock worked into a panic.
“Oh god, let's not bring the Brownings into this. I lost patience with them ages ago. But no, writing poetry for someone isn't a dedication. It's a romantic devotional.”
Sherlock expected the shadows to change again and grow darker on his face, but instead he laughed, glancing down the street. And it was only then that Sherlock saw what he'd been holding so gingerly in his hand.
Molly laid one hand on his shoulder, and he could feel it tremble. He had hated to ask this of her, but there had been no one else he could have trusted.
“No. In fact, Mycroft made an active effort to make my life as normal as he could. He found ways to talk our parents into letting him watch me instead of hiring help, for instance. He made excuses about immune systems when we had to go to parties or public functions. We were taught at home, so school wasn't an issue. For a while, I was convinced things would be all right.”
“Sorry to disappoint.” John sat down in his chair, growing steadily more and more annoyed and jittery with her standing in the middle of the room.
booth. It was tucked in against the wall and front windows, and on especially chilly nights one could feel the air slip in from around the panes of glass. But somehow, it still always felt warm there, even though the single candles on each table could provide no real warmth. And all Sherlock could think about was the fact that space appeared so cold despite it being filled with balls of fire.
He left so simply, like a friend saying goodbye after catching up with you, and when he snapped his fingers, the sniper sights vanished.
Mycroft Holmes had to push his way into the flat, feeling terribly undignified as he did so. The door was nearly blocked – as was the norm lately – with a myriad of scattered art supplies. Canvasses and large blocks of clay, paint sets and easels.
John's face appeared. He had his computer sitting just to the side, his head turned to smile at Sherlock.
Had John been standing that close at first? Had he moved and Sherlock hadn't noticed? He certainly seemed awfully close.
Sherlock looked the man in the eyes, almost confused at what he saw there. While he was openly affable, Sherlock could see past that into just how miserable he was. He was polite, but he was crumbling inside. Fascinating.
By the time night truly arrived, they were both on edge. They stopped in what appeared to be a safe place in the woods – a relative term, of course – surrounded by small trees and brush.
He had failed the other day, a fact which continued to buzz around in his mind, a near-constant irritation. Why was he incompetent in this one area? His eyes fell to the computer screen, not actually seeing anything. He forced himself to quit fidgeting with a pen he'd picked up from the tabletop.
The light began to shift, to change, the familiar effect of clouds crossing the sun, of slowly snuffing it out. But no one made a move to leave, seek shelter in a restaurant or shop nearby. Did anyone even really notice the weather? Did they realize they'd get soaked if they stayed much longer?
One night, John sat up in his bedroom in Baker Street, going through messages on his phone before reaching to turn out the light. But he stopped.
If anywhere could offer him answers about his life, surely it would be this liminal and picturesque chalet.
Mycroft reached a pinstriped arm out and picked up the sketch. “This is quite good. They won't be able to tell that your heart isn't in it, though I can.”
It had been the first line to come to mind, and he regretted it as soon as he chose it, his eyes instinctively clamping shut. He sighed to himself quietly enough that the phone would not pick it up, a chorus of
It seemed like a requirement, somehow, going back to the Piazza della Minerva, with its elephant obelisk and white church. It was only around the corner from the Pantheon itself, and John wondered if he'd created the trip to the Pantheon as a way of putting off the piazza or if somewhere in his subconscious he knew he needed to go back, and the only way he'd have the nerve would be to put himself within walking distance of it. The change was abrupt, the Pantheon and the piazza feeling like two different countries in the span of a hundred feet.
Sherlock prickled at the remark, straightening up and meeting John's knowing smile. “When was the last time you talked to Mary?”
“Sherlock.” When he didn't respond, John walked across the room and stood directly in his line of sight. “You've been in here for days. People are starting to worry about you.”
When John looked at him, he was standing on the other side of the bench, confused and holding his file tucked under his arm.
Neither of them had ever been in Athens, never had a reason to be, and while John could manage some intellectual interest even as tired as he was, Sherlock seemed to not care at all that the Acropolis itself could be seen from their balcony. But then again, why
“You should. Better to embrace the oddities in yourself than attempt to fall into the niche the world has created for you. It's the only chance of escaping the tedium.”
?” As he spoke, the twisted smile, the twisted face, it became someone else. The man from District 1, Jim Moriarty. He wore a crown like he had in the parade, and that false grin, that horrible grin, it became his entire field of vision. And the words came out like a hiss, “
When John faced him, when he saw the serious set to his features, all he could do was laugh. “Yeah, I'm sure Mycroft would take 'go to hell' for an answer.”
John didn't know what he expected to feel when he stepped out of the airport, facing Rome again for the first time since everything had gone wrong. But he hadn't expected a creeping sense of contentment. Rage, maybe, or an instant wave of blinding panic, or even sudden crippling sadness. But not this. He caught himself smiling within seconds, believing he'd made all the right decisions for the first time in his life.
John paused, trying to come up with a way to prove it. But he couldn't find his phone to text Sherlock, and any other method of proof available in this flat would likely complicate the situation further.
Later that afternoon, John arrived at the lab, unannounced. As soon as he walked in, Molly walked out, making a quick excuse that John ignored so easily that Sherlock was sure she had something to do with John's presence. The doors fell shut with a slam behind her as she left. Sherlock continued working for as long as he could before the silence became unbearable.
"In that case I'll probably see you in here again, until I leave London, that is." The man held out his hand. "John Watson."
"Hi, John. Sherlock wouldn't let anyone else in. I know I'm technically a pathologist, but I should suffice. He wouldn't even acknowledge any of the other doctors."
Walking home to Baker Street, talking about the Genie case – a wonderfully esoteric point of commonality – Sherlock was half-distracted the entire conversation. The world was slightly blurry from the wine, and even with John so close that they brushed against each other, he was still convinced that things would change rapidly and it would all be a joke at his expense.
this, exactly? What to call it? There had been no discussion of labels just as there had been no discussions about Sherlock's life story.
“My brother works as an executive at a publishing house, so I'm quite familiar with your universe. It's rare that someone from the outside world breaks through. Usually it's populated by people who have always been in the business, not a lot of new faces.”
, respectively?” John turned and met his eyes. “Of course, that's the literal translation. Typically the phrases are used idiomatically, in which case the meaning shifts from 'struck by lightning' to 'love at first sight,' which is troubling in a way. I have yet to understand why anyone thought it would be a good comparison, love and potentially life-threatening nerve and organ damage.”
Sherlock was leaning in the doorway a few feet away, staring into his drink. He was humming the song again as John walked by him into the living room. “Still have that song stuck in your head, do you? How does the rest of it go?” He took a long drink, waiting for Sherlock to say something.
There was one day where John beat Sherlock home. Usually Sherlock had to be dragged from the house, but now and then he would spend a day in the labs working and would be out till all hours of the night. John figured tonight was one such night, and it was just as well. The day had been as terrible as a day in a clinic could be. One patient had to be taken to the hospital after going into a dangerous heart rhythm. There were hoards of screaming children, it had seemed, letting out piercing yells every few minutes. The patients in general were all in terrible moods and a great many of them decided to challenge both John and Sarah's medical opinions, as if they knew the first thing about pharmaceuticals. It had been so miserable that John and Sarah weren't even capable of speech during lunch, and both of them audibly sighed in relief when they were done for the day.
John had grown more and more convinced that The Man had saved his life. Against all logic and rationality, he believed someone had saved him before the harried surgeons at the army hospital had sewn him up.
“I believe the saying is 'one day at a time,' which aside from being so horribly commonplace, is also probably not that good really, since it doesn't take into account the benefits of careful planning and foresight –”
He took his first tentative step toward the exit, trying to make the room quit spinning, reaching out for handholds and finding nothing more than what appeared to be a section of caved in ceiling. Two steps later and John found a person in his way, a dark-skinned man lying on the floor, a piece of the ceiling jutting out of one of his legs. The other leg, however, was missing almost entirely, blown off above the knee, flesh and bone exposed and charred. It was such a horrible warlike image that John forced a few deep breaths – which stung,
John stood in his place, watching as Jim Moriarty and Kitty Riley from District 1 were both awarded tens. Sherlock frowned at the screen as Moriarty's score was read, and then he slipped into thought while they went through the other districts.
"I don't know what I'd do, Sherlock!" John sounded more angry than he was. He was just tired and worried. He couldn't expect Sherlock Holmes to understand something like this brand of concern. "And, no, worrying won't change it, but neither will pretending everything is fine."
.” Unbelievable. They were willing to send him to die the least they could do was pay attention. His patience wore thinner.
John let out one shuddering breath and went back to the main menu. He opened up the calls section and clicked on "calls received." There were some from Lestrade, some from Mycroft, but nearly every call Sherlock had ever had was from John. And under "calls dialed," there it was, the last call. It was just a few minutes on the time stamp, a few agonizingly long and horrifying minutes. In the last moments of his life, Sherlock had only spoken to him. There were no other dialed calls around that time. Just the one to John.
John paused, feeling like he should protest, but knowing Sherlock would catch the halfhearted lie. “I really don't.”
He and Mary had hardly spoken since John stormed out on her, and really, he didn't mind. She was one less person he had to pretend to be okay for, one less person to ask him all those nagging little day to day questions like
For a split second, John's face changed, and Sherlock worried that the light had played tricks on his eyes, that the man was still just as irritated with him as he had been the night they met. But he recognized the gesture, the hand rubbing the back of his neck, the quick glance down at the pavement, that almost guilty expression that Sherlock was sure he had on his own face as well. He could feel the book in his pocket, almost on fire. Could John read his face, too, despite his efforts to appear neutral?
He sat next to me, a hand on my shoulder. "What the hell were you thinking? You can't just run off like that, Sherlock. You could have gotten yourself killed."
John closed the distance in seconds, wrapping him in a hug. Sherlock stiffened in surprise, but finally laid a hand on John's back.
John wanted her out of there, didn't want her to ever meet Sherlock. He wanted this untainted, untouched, never sullied by her presence in these rooms. All he could think of was the quickest way to make her leave so he could catch a few hours of light sleep in their bed.
It was all fine, initially. They had gone to the Borghese and canvassed the place, Sherlock attempting to not become distracted by the works of art and failing. The day had been so calm, so easy and worry free that John had laughed at the very idea of
John swallowed hard, walking past him into the kitchen under the pretense of seeing what Mrs. Hudson had brought. The reality was that he simply needed a moment to figure out what the hell was going on. He stood at the counter, forcing his breathing to slow down, waiting until he could no longer hear his heart in his ears before turning around.
John was still trying to sort it out, having gone through the remainder of the conversation on autopilot when The Man said, “The name's Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221B Baker Street. Afternoon!” And he left with a great flourish of his coat.
There would be a hundred problems tomorrow. The secret was out. The world's only consulting detective would have to find another way to cut the strings of the spider's web. But as he stood there, hands on the doctor's face, and saying hello rather than goodbye, Sherlock found he didn't care. For now, they had a still world, a quiet place where no one could reach them. There would be so much to figure out. But they had all the time in the world. Every second that was stolen from them because of Moriarty would be returned in full.
As soon as Sherlock stepped out of sight of the cameras, the smile evaporated and it was replaced with a look of pure distaste. He came and stood by John, glancing up at the screen before rolling his eyes.
It would have been so easy to cross the room and shut the door on the rest of the world, to try to reclaim some of the quiet privacy they'd had in Baker Street. It could have been easy enough to forget there had just been a wedding, and that there was a bride out there somewhere waiting for her new groom. But it was too late for such things.
John hated that he couldn't argue with him. Because it was true that if Sherlock had brought it up sooner, he would have spent every waking minute of his day thinking about it instead of focusing on their current cases. He almost hated how well Sherlock knew him. In a white flag of defeat, John crossed his arms over his chest and begrudgingly walked to the desk to join the conversation. Mycroft waited until he was convinced that John would listen before he spoke.
“You're not going to ask me why I'm here?” John asked, swallowing a significant portion of the second drink.
Sherlock stared as the blue orb slowly grew and burst, in slow-motion, without the addition of the audio track, and suddenly the planetarium felt cold.
Sherlock huffed out a sigh. "Fine." He crossed his arms over his chest and stared up at the ceiling.
John looked around the woods, looking even to the sky, hoping the cannon would sound, hoping they would come and take her body away like vultures. But the bleed was too slow to draw them in. It could be hours before they finally came.
John had no idea what to do with himself when he was back in London. The nights were long and full of nightmares. The days were longer.
“No. Because they felt that they were living under the shadow of it all. In fact, they had no idea about what happened in Afghanistan, they didn't know I was a common name in the news reports. All they knew was that something in the war had destroyed me from the inside out, and I could never pretend I was okay. Apparently it's difficult for someone to spend time with someone who is constantly reliving terrible things. People who haven't been in situations like ours, they don't know what to make of somebody living ruled by their own pasts. It puts a strain on things. This person told me that it felt like I was more attached to my own sadness than I was to them.”
John sat down in his chair and cast a disapproving glance at the Christmas tree. Mrs. Hudson had more or less insisted on putting one up. Its lights were on, and they cast their multicolored spotlights on the floor, so cheerful on such a cold and dreary night. He stayed hypnotized by them for a while before he gave up and went to bed. He didn't sleep upstairs anymore. His old room was usually shut off to conserve heat. It was easier to use the other bedroom. And even though the one downstairs had long since been his room, somehow it still felt like Sherlock's, the periodic table even still in place on the wall. John hadn't had the heart to remove it.
“I believe the term for this sort of fight is 'a losing battle.' Goodnight.” He pushed his chair back and calmly walked out of the room.
“Maybe it isn't all false. We don't know what sort of arena we'll have, or what sort of sponsors. We may still have a chance.”
But Sherlock was not so happy. It couldn't be a good sign, things lining up this way. If he'd been truly human and had a heart beat, he was sure it would have been racing.
John didn't recognize the lines the students began to throw around, of course. But Sherlock did. Their contest with each other to prove to everyone that
While he was just on the verge of sleep nearly an hour later, he jolted awake, his memory throwing him a harsh reminder.
“And you know how to make an impression with these people, then?” Sherlock asked, his voice tinged with condescension.
He couldn't decide if he should risk using the gun today. It was the morning of the Reaping, and his hand was a little shaky. There would be more people coming in and out of the District, a greater chance of the gunfire being heard, and a greater chance of being seen with whatever he killed.
“Good publicity can wipe out all sorts of unpleasant details of personality,” Mycroft said. “Though I'm not sure there's ever enough in some cases.”
Still, he felt jittery as he picked up first aid supplies, feeling like any second someone would question him or worse, recognize him as having been at the Hickman. But that was irrational, he kept telling himself, grabbing a small home sewing kit and hunting down the aisles for easy food.
“She found out about Afghanistan, about what happened and who I am. I've had to hire some new people lately because of it. They always find out in the end. Lila called me a monster and quit.” He shrugged one shoulder, the one that felt no creeping paralysis. “I'm trying to hire fewer people. I'd like to do away with it entirely, but that's not really plausible.” John thought it was a massive understatement. Absolutely not plausible for an agoraphobic, disabled, traumatized army veteran. He hated that hiring staff who didn't despise him was even something he had to worry about. Sholto had internalized and normalized his own self-loathing.
Harry looked down at her brother as he wrapped his hands around the glass. She'd never seen him in such bad shape. He looked angry and destroyed at the same time. Usually
He glared at it, sitting quietly in its pot out of the way of its poisonous neighbors. The great experimental failure. He had never hated something so much as he did that innocent flower. The creation of a blue rose had preoccupied him for so long, and all it had gotten him was a shade of lavender and a single plant that couldn't stand up to his poison. Generation after generation of the purple roses, dead on contact, a final insult to the folly of his experiments.
“God, especially after we really deal with the press. I keep getting calls from people wanting to interview us. And I would much rather disappear, maybe let your brother fill in some of the blanks for the papers so we don't have to fool with it. So now it's just a question of
“When did you get assigned to this case, Sherlock?” The two brothers stopped and stared at him, pausing at his interruption. Mycroft then shot Sherlock a condescending sort of look. John was so totally out of his element. The Holmes brothers, for all their clashing with the room itself, were still more suited to this place than he was. Why couldn't they have done this, of all things, at Baker Street where he would be safe?
“Sherlock, remember, whether you like it or not, you were born an angel. And part of that involves looking after human beings. You don't have to care about them. You don't have to enjoy it. But it is part of your job.”
Some of the tributes were children, and the very sight of them up there on stage made John feel sick. They couldn't have been older than ten, and they were going to be competing against adults who didn't care that they had only just entered the world. There was no way they would make it; those children were going to die.
He rapidly assessed his situation, finding no way to undo the bonds that held him. No amount of time would help. Moriarty had done an efficient job. His thoughts turned to Sherlock, and suddenly he realized he was the bait.
There was a boy sitting across the room from him. He was maybe a few years older than Sherlock, but he had the tired expression of someone who has already seen a lifetime's worth of sad things.
A grueling eighteen hours later, John and Sherlock were sitting in Baker Street's living room, laughing and exhausted. They hadn't slept or eaten, but they had caught a serial killer. Sherlock's earlier theories were confirmed. Five hours in, the cane had disappeared, as had the hand tremor. Seven hours in, John had realized this, and seemed confused but relieved.
John had hoped that when morning came, the pack of tributes would leave, but sunrise came and went and they still stayed, talking amongst themselves about the Games, eating leisurely. They knew they were a force to be reckoned with, and it made them indifferent. Why should they leave when they could just kill whoever came along instead?
Lestrade was quiet for a few minutes, before asking softly, "You were on the phone with him before he jumped, right?" John nodded. "What did he tell you?"
doubted him. Not once." John's anger had broken, and now he just sounded defeated. He didn't want to feel betrayed, but that was what it had come to. Betrayed by the Met, yes, but betrayed by Sherlock as well. "What exactly do you want from me? He called me, gave me a voice suicide note, and made me watch him kill himself. He had no pulse. I checked."
Of course, looking back, John wondered how innocent his own invitation really would have been, and was painfully aware of the fact that any ulterior meanings Sherlock might have deduced from such a thing would have, in fact, been spot on.
Sholto paused, the analyzing expression momentarily taking John back to the front lines. It was the same look he would use as he went over mission plans. “And how is that?”
Midnight came. As did one. John hadn't even moved to change out of his clothes. His legs still hung over the edge of the bed, shoes still on. There was a certain paralysis that came with dreading an obligation that was fast approaching. He should have come out a day or two early to give him adequate time to prepare himself, but he had wanted to stay in town as little as he could, partly due to his loathing of his hometown, partly because he would much rather spend the days with Sherlock. There had been a split-second moment during which John had almost asked him to come as well, for moral support. But that would have appeared too intensely desperate, wouldn't it? Bringing someone in to all his baggage so quickly and in such a bleak way. But it was true that the room would have felt more like home with Sherlock in it, even though neither of them made it a habit to stay in each other's London homes for very long. They had a tendency to occupy neutral ground. But John was beyond neutrality.
He hated his sentimentality, hated how much he missed those other numbered days, back in the Capitol. Even then it was hard to forget that they were pretending, that it was all a pageant before a slaughter, but those few moments when they could forget, those were what he missed. The thought that even that would be taken away from them in the end made him bitter.
"Reason your way through it. Your mind needs the exercise." Sherlock sat his violin down and started scribbling down the music from memory onto some blank sheets. He would neaten it up later. He was hoping John would come to his own conclusions. Sherlock didn't want to have to tell him out loud. Such emotional confrontations were not his strong suit. Any time he opened his mouth, he usually just made things worse. "Think about the tone."
What a scene it must have been to him, John thought. Walk inside your home and finding someone held at gunpoint by an ex. In a different world, John might have found the whole thing comical, but all he could do with Mary glancing at Sherlock was wish that Sherlock had never come home to this at all.
John crossed the room, reaching into the pocket of the coat, pulling the ring out. Safe and sound. He rinsed the blood off of it in the bathroom and held it up to the light. It was pretty, gold band with a red stone. Not a wedding ring, just a regular piece of jewelry. But pretty. He walked back into his room, setting the ring down on his bedside table, trying to remember what the man had said to him in the gallery. Baker Street. 220-something.
And as soon as he walked inside, Mycroft opened his mouth, but he was cut off by Irene bursting into a laughing fit from her place on the couch.
“The world is at a standstill,” she said, dragging a chair in front of him and sitting down, legs crossed.
John squinted in the sun. The Square was filled to the brim. He could see the bowl of names on the stage, not separated into male or female this year. Just one containing every name of every person in the District old enough to walk. He saw an old woman leading a child to the appropriate line and tried to push away the mental image of the woman fighting anyone to the death.
It was a while before John lowered the gun, and when he did, the full effect of what he'd done completely took over him. He walked out of the water, standing over the body of the animal, his finger still on the trigger should it come to life again. But when he saw that it really was dead, blood flowing from its shattered skull, he stepped away and sank to his knees, setting his gun down beside him on the ground. He clapped his hand over his mouth and stared at the hound.
Sherlock smirked. “But so entertaining.” He backed his face away from the microscope, John laughing to himself.
This was all fine and good until he was older, and looking for something to fill the empty hours he was left with when he stopped time. He could never bring anyone with him. He was always trapped, the only motion in a still world. And while some days he relished in the solitude, others the emptiness of the world was so staggering that he despised it. Of course, he alone controlled when he invoked this silence, but often he only did so because it was preferable to the moving world.
He had heard the reports from his men, that they'd lost three soldiers in the attack. His friend Bill had said that they thought they'd lost him as well. When John heard that, it jogged his memory.
“I don't know if I should take that as a compliment or if it should make me worried about the competency of the force.”
. I was protecting my charge! If you had kept that lunatic locked up, I wouldn't have had to do that!”
The book of Neruda was so small; even Sherlock admitted that. But he also said that even though it was small that it “contained multitudes.” John was sure that description was yet another reference escaping him. But it rang true.
tributes just to have someone here who knew how I felt that I could turn to. Kate couldn't understand. She still doesn't, really. I scared her to death so many times right after I got back. No one can understand what people like us have been through except those who have experienced it first hand.” She sat back a little in her seat, but she was still leaning forward toward him. “You two have been afforded a rare opportunity. And you're throwing it away for what? A sense of superiority?” She shook her head. “You have the rest of your life ahead of you, and you will be miserable trying to get through it alone. No, don't open your mouth, don't say a word to me. You
Mike Stamford's bookshop had always been one of Sherlock's favorites. It had both new and used books, stayed open late, and was designed in such a way that one could get lost entirely in the shelves like an animal camouflaged in leaves.
Sherlock lifted his eyes from the wood grain, but refused to make eye contact. “I don't know when exactly. My parents were rarely home, so it isn't as if there was a great deal of physical contact. It could have technically started before I was aware of it. But one day, I reached for Mycroft, and burns erupted on his skin. The woman our parents had watching us at the time was scared to death. She quit after that, understandably. Mycroft scarred rather badly, finger marks. Perhaps you've seen them?” John nodded. “I suppose we both believed it was a fluke, since that seemed statistically more likely. But nearly a month later, we wanted to see if that was the case. Mycroft wanted to know more than I did. He had me touch him, one fingertip on his forearm. It scarred too, looked something like a cigarette burn. By all logic, your face should be mangled right now.”
Sherlock woke up on a hillside in the forest, covered in leaves and dirt and god knows what else. He sat up, brushing himself off, his head pounding. Where in the arena had he ended up?
He propped himself up on his hands and looked at the other side of his bed. Sherlock had curled up on top of the blankets next to him, practically in a ball, facing the other direction.
He didn't sleep well at all after that. And for days after, he jumped at every noise, his heart skipping beats any time he saw lights outside his window, thinking that the police had somehow found him, were coming to take him away. Once or twice Sherlock even noticed how distracted he was, and he looked concerned (or rather, what passed for concern with Sherlock). John always shrugged it off, but in the back of his mind, all he heard was a chorus of:
The flight to Rome was a way of shutting London off. For a while, it and all its baggage didn't exist, and even those hours of limbo in the plane still felt oddly peaceful.
“Right. And what do those two have that none of the others do?” There was silence. John and Sherlock glanced at each other, not knowing what she was getting at. “Money. Money earns you an image long before you're even selected as a tribute. And an image gets your sponsors. The Careers are in the limelight from the second they're chosen. Since we have none of the money and so none of the publicity, it's harder for us to make an impression. And we must make an impression. Otherwise, you may as well be in the arena without a weapon. So creating the right image for you is vital.”
He almost missed the end of the countdown, as did many of them, distracted by the woman's death. But then it became a blur of running figures, of screams and battle cries. He saw Sherlock grab something and bolt for the woods, another tribute narrowly missing him with an arrow. John whirled around, his eyes finding the harsh metallic glint of a gun. He ran for it even as another tribute came from the other direction, trying to beat him to it. But the tribute stopped suddenly, only feet from John, eyes wide in shock, and then she fell to her knees, a spear sticking out of her back. The boy who had thrown it, maybe seventeen if that, came forward, wrenching it out of her. John reached forward, grabbing the gun and a knife beside it, and without a second thought for the dead woman, he ran.
He laid a hand across the statue's chest as he leaned his forehead against its own. Near tears, he was bordering on some sort of ecstatic hysteria. He whispered the name
What he did not consider was the fact that London offered him invisibility. He was not a physically imposing man, and the sheer volume of people in London guaranteed that he could, say, safely go to the store without people coming up to him asking if he was
“Spouse, boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever? No, it's not. But this isn't a normal situation is it? Besides Sherlock, I never
“Earlier this evening, during the opening of the Lost Vermeer exhibit, disaster struck the up and coming Hickman Gallery when a bomb went off in the museum. When emergency services arrived on the scene, a second bomb was found, and crews are still working to make sure that the second bomb is properly defused. This has resulted in nearly all emergency personnel being removed from the building. It is unknown at this time how many victims are still inside, and whether those still inside are alive or dead. Emergency personnel have already reported three deaths, and many more taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. Little else is known at this time.” Behind the reporter, John could still see the hordes of people, which had only grown since he'd left the scene.
that are starting to worry about you Sherlock. I'm starting to worry about you. What we survived, it breaks people. It's broken people far stronger than either of us.”
“You tell me all the others are poisonous, even though I know that moonflowers and lilies usually aren't.”
“Then how do you ever find someone who won't walk out on you or have the same argument about it all a hundred times?”
“There are no ways out, John. One person leaves. People need you back home far worse than they need me. It's the only rational choice.”
Sherlock was in his cramped flat when he felt the strange tug that always accompanied the world stopping. Except this time, he hadn't willed it to. He looked around his living room, frowning in a rare case of confusion. When he left the flat, he found London frozen as always, but he was intensely disturbed instead of pleased to see the stopped cars and poised pedestrians.
The warmth of blood continued to spread over his face. He wiped some away with his wet hand, his fingers coming back red.
Once the blood was cleared away, John could properly see the wound. It was a nasty gash, but probably looked worse than it was, given how heads wounds were. Still, it annoyed him that he couldn't at least put some stitches on it for good measure.
The girl reached out a bloody hand and grabbed his wrist, her fingerprints smearing on John's skin. She pulled his hand closer, her fingers trying to grab hold of the metal of the gun, but the blood made it too slick. Finally her hand dropped, and tears welled up in her eyes. She choked out a few words, her voice breaking, “Make it stop. It hurts.
of what they see. It's all well and good to make a record of something's appearance, but a poet will ask the point of it.” There was something soothing in the way he talked, the way he said each word like he'd already planned this speech out before. It quieted the ringing in John's ears, the horrible knee jerk reaction to the Vermeer. It even crossed a bit into the endearing, that someone who loved logic and science so much still couldn't manage to not wax poetic about the stars. “But it doesn't really matter, does it? It's all just space and physics, anyway.”
“A golden chain tree.” Sherlock's voice startled him. He had stopped walking and was staring off at the tree as well. “Usually seen in southern Europe. A lovely poisonous tree, though it's often used as an ornamental. Why people believe that using poisonous trees for such a purpose has never ceased to baffle me.” He waved for John to follow, and left the nearly nonexistent path to cross the yard, approaching a large, rundown greenhouse. It was an ornate building with a high ceiling, the top of it decorated with iron work made to look like vines. Several panes of glass were missing throughout, the intact glass a bluish green underneath a blurry accumulation of dirt and grime. The weeds were beginning to encroach upon it as well, and the door was long since gone. Sherlock strode through the empty doorway into the greenhouse.
People always think of a sunrise as a timed event that you can pinpoint to the second, when the reality is that it is a slow progression from darkness to light. There is no sudden burst of color in the sky, no instantaneous coming to life of the world. No clear bold lines, but instead, a softened fading. The sunrise crept into Athens as it had for thousands of years. John wasn't sure when he noticed it, the way the light from the hotel room didn't cut so sharply out onto the darker balcony, the muted grayness that always seemed to encapsulate these early morning hours. He couldn't see the sun itself yet, but evidence of its appearance was painted on every building, every tree, every balcony just like theirs up the side of the hotel.
The hallway at the back of the building had few people in it aside from them, and Sherlock could almost suspend disbelief enough to feel like they were completely alone. He hummed a little as they walked.
John reached out for Sherlock's hand. “Here, let me see.” Sherlock pulled his hand back, one quick abrupt motion. He shook his head. “I'm a doctor, Sherlock.”
He had heard the stories about sophomore slumps from every writer or filmmaker he had ever met, but for the longest time he didn't believe the phenomenon really existed. He still didn't, really. The problem was perception. The world had reached a point where it almost expected an artist to fail on their second venture. So the quality of the work was irrelevant; the world would see failure no matter what the artist produced.
Who knew what Sherlock was feeling, if anything at all. Maybe he had locked up the human part of himself for a while, to get through his work. But he couldn't get rid of it entirely. John had seen it too many times, and somewhere behind his composure, John was sure he was at least half as much a mess as John himself.
Holding out the book to John without even checking the table of contents, he said, “The fifth one, page fifteen.”
He sat paralyzed for a moment, plagued by the thought that he hadn't made it, that the hovercraft had long since come for his body while he was unconscious.
When he finally ran from the horrible scene, some of the birds followed him, singing and singing. He wanted to shoot them, to silence them, to stop drawing attention toward him. But he couldn't. He could only run as they sang, hating the song. The birds finally abandoned him, one by one, the deeper he got into the woods.
John took a drink of his scotch. “Yeah. It still does. That's why we don't talk. I got into a big argument with them about it some years back, among other things. It didn't help the situation.”
His face crumpled some, and his eyes were glazed with tears. “We were together, at the beginning of it. We got separated. I couldn't protect her.”
He ran his hands through the leaves around him and felt the cold metal of his knife blade. He must have dropped it when he blacked out. Small blessings. He held it up to the light, staring at it, and then he heard the bang of a cannon, once, and then again a minute later. He looked off in the direction of the faint sound. More competition had been eliminated. It was a miracle that no one had found Sherlock. He'd come very close to being another forgotten face.
“You can tell them as much as you'd like. Just don't expect them to have the faintest idea of what you are actually saying. People are only marginally intelligent on the best of days. Usually they're incapable of understanding the simplest of concepts. So none of us can expect them to understand this.”
She said nothing back to that. He rolled over and glanced at the analog alarm clock on the bedside table. It was eleven at night. Noon felt practically five minutes away. Five minutes until he had to see his father. Ten until he had to see Harry.
Sherlock was quiet through most of these early hours in their trip, acting as if he thought himself a mere background character in John's pilgrimage. He seemed to know that many of the ghosts John was putting to rest involved him, and had likely wondered if John really wanted him there at all. But Rome was tied permanently to Sherlock Holmes, and John refused to let dark memories cloud it for the rest of their lives.
I survived war, he would tell himself, I can survive this. But so many nights he wasn't so sure, and he grew to wonder how he survived the war at all.
John stepped down the narrow aisle of the plane, his eyes scanning for his seat. When he found it, he stopped, and stared in disbelief at the person sitting in the window seat. Sherlock didn't look at him. He was too preoccupied watching something outside the window. John attempted to be inconspicuous as he sat down.
Taking careful, quiet steps, he finally reached the edge of the clearing. The tributes had set themselves up for the night, a large man standing guard for the first watch. He took cover immediately, crouching down behind some evergreen branches, watching the man, making sure he hadn't been heard. The man stood unmoving, oblivious to Sherlock's presence. Sherlock considered killing him, of sneaking up and slitting his throat, maybe even killing the others in their sleep. But it was too big a risk, a battle that he couldn't guarantee he'd win, and Sherlock still didn't
Sherlock stopped playing, looking over his shoulder to find John standing behind his chair, bags on the kitchen table behind him.
. You're doing all of this for a painting? You're part of Moriarty's crime network and you're obviously, what? A contract killer? Don't you have better uses of your time?”
Mrs. Hudson stopped John before he left, asking if he needed anything. Jokingly, he said, “Just a violin.”
"Don't even start," Sherlock replied, failing to suppress his grin. He pushed the door open and stepped out into the cold with John.
For those of you who don't know about this book, this fic is based on a novel called The Goldfinch, which I have been constantly preoccupied with for the last nine solid fucking months. I started this fic because of how badly
John glanced back up at her, annoyance returning. Logically he knew that anyone would be angry in her position. But still he wanted to lead her to the door and not speak to her for a while. It was problematic. She was a decent person, really didn't deserve to be caught in the Sherlock Holmes fallout, and John probably
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, but paused. In his head was a string of words, admissions that he probably shouldn't make for the sake of his own dignity.
John flipped to the table of contents, scanning the titles, his eye latching on to one that was titled “Children of Adam.”
In a voice softer than the shadows outside Baker Street, softer than the music at the restaurant, softer than the worn binding of the returned book of Auden, John said to him:
“English detective Sherlock Holmes has made a name for himself here in Italy in a matter of days. It is no wonder the sleuth is so well-known and widely loved in his home country. After a series of threats made against the Borghese were connected to the bombing at the Hickman Gallery in London earlier this year, Holmes made the trip to Italy in hopes of preventing another wide scale disaster. And he succeeded.” The subtitles continued to scroll at the bottom of the television as footage from the Borghese played, all the worried men and women in their gowns and suits, Sherlock front and center talking to the bomb squad. It looked like a helpful collaboration. The reality was that Sherlock was ripping into them for not doing a better job scanning the place for explosives before the event. John was never mentioned in these news reports. Now and then a magazine would include his name back in London, but for the most part, he was an almost invisible man, though if he was being honest with himself, he didn't really mind.
Some days John could barely keep up with him, true. He seemed to operate on limitless energy when the situation called for it, only lapsing into exhaustion when all loose ends were properly tied up. But god, even when John was running on no sleep for days, even when he went without eating, when he lived on nothing but adrenaline and Sherlock, even then he was happier than he had been as a doctor, as a soldier, and even simply as a regular human being. Because you couldn't be a regular human being with Sherlock Holmes. You became something different, something stronger, something more miraculous than anyone could fathom. His world was not like everyone else's world. His world was magic.
He didn't even hesitate before standing and walking out of her flat, letting the door slam behind him.
As he approached, standing beside Sherlock, he took a good look at the two officers. And as their faces registered with his memory, he felt the familiar sensation of the ground disappearing from beneath his feet, of the ringing drowning out everyone's voices, of the overwhelming paralysis of both mind and body.
The taxi pulled up to the curb, and Sherlock tucked the paperback back in his pocket, reaching out a gloved hand to open the car door. Baker Street was already growing still around them, a domestic silence leaving little outside except pools of light from street lamps and the occasional sound of tires on asphalt.
." I doubted that I could have looked Victor in the eye had he been there. "Sherlock, what were you thinking? You nearly got yourself killed."
“Does all of this really bother you? What they say? How I maintain my interactions with others? I don't understand. Why would it bother
“Sherlock, this could be an important commission for you. These are not clients you can turn down. They're too high up. And they've heard so much about you.”
The room had waited for Harry's response, but none came. No words, no physicality, no tears. Her silence was louder than any other options could ever have been.
John sat in his chair in Baker Street that night, the seat across from him noticeably empty. The flat was too quiet without Sherlock. Time passed more quickly in his absence. John would look at the clock and find an hour had passed when it seemed to only have been minutes. He had tried to read, to watch television, but nothing helped. He gave in to the crushing silence, and didn't come out of it until very late.
“I may as well save the battery since the reception at this hotel is deplorable,” he said, setting the phone back down on the table, the dead screen dull.
Another night, wasted. Another night with no updates, no productivity, no words put to paper. But it wasn't as if he could force the words out, however much he may have wanted to. Instead he was forced to turn in, and as he tried so desperately to sleep, he found that all he saw when he shut his eyes were the typed out words from the poem, still trapped in the forgotten book and yet still taunting him even now:
“You said we essentially run a business, yeah? I'm not going to abandon my partner because the case could throw life into chaos. I don't do that.”
She sighed, her patience thinning as she crossed the room and sat down in a nearby easy chair. “You've got five minutes.”
Sholto hesitated, but finally said, “Well, I know that while you were working that case in Italy that that detective of yours got killed. Shot down, if I recall. I honestly don't really know much about the case itself, but I remember that he was killed.”
He'd never been one to watch the Games much when he was home. But he knew many people who watched religiously, even though the death and bloodshed always made them cringe and cry, always made them feel sick. If they were on screen now, piped into everyone's homes, were the people watching touched with a sense of safety and privacy too, just as they were touched by fear when they watched people die?
John turned around and looked at him, playing as he always did, with his back to John. “On the Street Where You Live” filled up every corner of the room. John walked into the living room, standing behind his chair with his hands resting on its back as Sherlock played the song.
“You...you told me once...that you weren't a hero. Um, there were times I didn't even think you were human.” John gave a shuddering breath. He touched the granite and all he could feel was the memory of the skin of Sherlock's wrist, and the absent pulse that had told him his angel's wings had broken.
Sholto had never looked at John with as much kindness as he had in that moment. He had seen him at his lowest point, and for once his life was in a good enough state that he could be happy for John without thinking in the back of his head
Mary talked him into a short hunting trip in the woods the next morning. She had been visibly unsure when she asked him, thinking perhaps of every possible trigger he could encounter. But John decided the return to his routine might do him good.
Jim looked him in the eye, raising his eyebrows. “You're just getting that now?” He feigned a dramatic sigh. “All my life I've been searching for distractions. You were the best distraction and now I don't even have you. Because I've
Sherlock was already mentally preparing for another quiet evening. His brain was beginning to rot down here.
He was about to leave when he saw John stand, resting his hand on the tombstone as he'd done many times. But this time he said in a choked voice, "Merry Christmas, Sherlock. I love you." He turned and walked away, back in the direction of Baker Street.
John stared at the closed door for a minute, considering going back to sleep. But Sherlock would just keep pestering him till he got up. So he stood and went to open the door. Sherlock was standing on the other side, hands in the pockets of his dressing gown.
But when his conscience asked what he should do about the painting, he ignored it, and did his best to try to fall asleep.
But why couldn't she do some of that sitting down? Her pacing wasn't like Sherlock's, which always came across as urgent and wired, the physical manifestation of a brain operating faster than anyone else's. Hers was slow, easy, controlled. John had seen soldiers walk like that, but usually they weren't captains or majors. Usually they were the ones who ended up going AWOL.
John had spent hours preparing to leave, originally intending to go early that morning, but by the time he finally worked up the nerve, it was already later in the afternoon. He walked down the street, the ring heavy in his pocket, the pain in his leg breaking through despite the painkillers he'd taken earlier.
That night, the sky came to life showing the fallen tributes. And while John was grateful to not see Sherlock's face, he felt like he was being strangled when they showed the little girl. Her name, he'd never even known her name till he saw it beneath her picture – Claudette Bruhl.
“I consult with the police when they need help, which is relatively often, unfortunately. They made it longer without my assistance than they usually do, these last few weeks. Normally they've called me in multiple times, much to their chagrin. We're going to meet a DI I work with on a regular basis.”
,” Sherlock said. He stood a few feet away from John, the wind tearing at his coat. At his feet, a bed of yellow English primrose. In his bare hand, the heavy pale pink bloom of a camellia bush. “Certain varieties are used for tea, while the oils from some of the plants are used to clean blades. Lovely contrast, don't you think?” The bloom looked like it physically weighted down Sherlock's hand, even though Sherlock himself looked so captured by the wind that it seemed as if he was lighter than air itself.
They drove past an estate with a large country house situated at the top of one of the hills. It was gray and bleak washed out stone, with no lights visible in any of the windows. But the house had extensive gardens, some open, some behind fences and low walls, some in greenhouses. And they seemed almost wild.
John slowly shoved himself to his feet, his cane gone. But he was relatively steady, too disoriented to even notice if his leg was hurting at all. He turned in a circle –
A flicker of movement farther up the cliff drew his gaze away from the man. He squinted in the faint moonlight, thinking the Capitol had inserted some wild animals into their arena. But there was a small glimmer as light hit something metallic. Sherlock's thoughts instantly went back to the guillotines, the blades hung in the trees. Was this more of that tribute's work? The one who had “sponsored” the old man?
