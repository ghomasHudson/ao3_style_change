“I know what you said, and you weren’t wrong, so shut the hell up about it. Why're you here? Figured you went back to...” He jerks his head toward the ceiling, deliberately trying to not think about the reality of a single angel meaning that Heaven and God must exist, too. He’s been edging around the thought for weeks and he’s going to keep doing it for as long as life will allow it.
Dean shakes his head. Sam debates pulling his phone out and checking if there’s a good enough signal to check the weather reports, but Dean pulls to a stop between the fence and an RV. He puts the car in park and pockets the keys, ducking out into the rain and leaving Sam to scramble out of the passenger side to follow him.
He feels the warmth when Dean blushes and doesn’t hold back his giggle when Dean tries to shove him away. Just grabs him by the sleeve of his shirt to keep him from moving too far away. It's gonna be annoying if they have to redraw the chalk lines because he couldn’t resist poking at Dean’s stupid machismo.
“Have faith, Mrs. Rourke,” Sue Ann calls from the door, and all of them look up toward her as she pushes it open. “Elijah, come inside.”
“He lit them up from the inside,” Sam spits out. “Bobby, we can’t wait until we get back. We have to do it now.”
“Which one? When you called me a hooker or when you fucking branded me?”
Bingo. Sam widens his eyes and gets up from his seat to look down at the page she’s reading through.
take the car. Go to Lincoln and poke around the university. I’ll stay here.”
“Yeah, right. Besides, I thought we were going with Elijah being behind the murders. Aren’t angels all Michael Landon, It’s a Wonderful Life, harps on a cloud? This ain’t exactly angelic behavior here, Sam.”
Dean's stomach sinks. “Shit, look, that was… was kind of your fault with the choking thing, okay, but… Sorry?” he offers halfheartedly. Cas reaches out and wraps his fingers around his wrist. Dean imagines pressing his hand over Cas' and his palm itches with the desire. He folds another shirt.
Cas holds back his laughter until they round the corner at the bottom of the stairs, then lets go. By the time Dean returns upstairs from tucking Ben in again, Cas is still chuckling and Dean is still flushed. “Can it, Cas,” he snaps, but there’s no heat behind his words. They stare at each other for a moment before they both bust out laughing again.
Meg and Dean eat in silence while Cas stares out the window at the flaming azalea blooming in the garden. The bright red flowers had been one of his mother’s favorites. He doesn’t react when Dean sets a mug of tea in front of him.
, the first song that played in his head after the accident. In the past week, Dean and Castiel have spent hours cataloging the music Dean has played, and that was the first song Castiel had added to the list.
Walking away, out of the studio, and through the front door is the hardest thing Dean has ever done, and Dean’s life has thrown a lot of hard things his way. He locks the door behind him and replaces the key behind the loose brick before climbing into the car. He pulls out his phone and sends a text to Meg.
Dean chuckles affectionately. “Seriously, dude? That’s, um . . .
“This is Mrs. Johnson, the principal at your son’s school. He’s fine, Mr. Winchester,” she assures, but the pause before she continues tells Dean that the situation is anything but fine. “Ben had some difficulty in his class today. He became upset when he was asked to stop an activity before he was ready, but he’s calm now.”
Cas smirks, rocking into the friction. “She’s very distracting.”
“Me too,” Will returns, not appearing to handle the self-consciousness any better.
sad, right? His mother is dead and his father is dead and he’s an orphan. He and Gabriel are both orphans now. That should make him cry. He raises one hand and rubs at his dry eyes.
Dean and Cas both munch on cookies while they wait for Ben to finish, the atmosphere so light and mellow that Dean’s phone startles him when it goes off, the first few notes of an old Foghat song indicating a text.
Dean loses track of time the same way he did the first day. When the last crisp, clear tone rings through the store, he buries his hands in his hair and presses his forehead to the cool polished wood. Dean takes a few deep breaths to steady himself and shoves the bench back a few inches. When he turns, he almost jumps out of his skin.
“And you, Dean?” Candace says, drawing Dean’s attention away from watching Cas. “What are your plans for Christmas?” Thankfully, Cas’ presence seems to curb her flirtation a little.
Something loosens in Cas’ chest at the admission. Dean left out the part where Ash kissed him, but it doesn’t seem important now. Not if what Ash says is true and Dean didn’t return it. How far can he trust Ash to be truthful? How far is he willing to go? “Did you sleep with him at Christmas?”
Meg chuckles as she continues to prepare the salmon and apple-kale salad she planned for, knowing better than to get between them. Considering that Castiel is a disaster in the kitchen, he finds it fitting that his best friend can take advantage of the state-of-the-art appliances. He doesn’t remember how their monthly tradition of Meg cooking for the three of them came to be, but he cherishes these evenings.
Thankfully Ben agrees and they exit the showroom before Carl shows his face. Dean isn’t sure he could control himself if he came face to face with the smug bastard. When they reach the Impala, Dean helps Ben set up his headphones, then rests his head against the steering wheel, praying for the cold leather to calm his anger. Bigoted assholes are a dime a dozen, but it’s been years since he had to deal with one. He forgot how much it hurts.
Putting the last book on the shelf, Becky virtually bounces over to them, her lank blond hair draped over her ears. She isn’t a particularly pretty girl, but what she lacks in conventional attractiveness, she more than makes up for in natural good will. “All done, Mr. Novak,” she practically squeals. “I think we’re all ready to start shaping young minds tomorrow.”
Despite his discomfort, Dean lets out a bark of laughter. “Jo? Holy hell, man. That would be like dating my sister.”
They listen as the shower comes on and Gabriel starts singing an old ‘80s pop song. When he hits an especially high note they both chuckle, and then Kali tilts her head and says, "You can talk to me, you know. He can't hear you."
It’s a late Saturday afternoon near campus, so the store is packed. Unlike the fancy chain stores, Supersonic is a mishmash of recorded music, memorabilia, and instruments. You’re likely to find an original Cyndi Lauper album from the '80s next to the guitar strings beside a pair of Zildjian cymbals. There’s really no recognizable organization that Dean has ever noticed, but that doesn’t mean Garth doesn’t know exactly where every item in the store is.
“For the record,” Castiel whispers, speaking so softly that Dean has to lean back in to hear him. “You’re not screwing anything up.” He shifts, pressing soft, warm lips to Dean’s cheek.
Dean slides his hand around to squeeze the back of his neck. “You’re confusin’ the hell outta me, man. You’re telling me to go after Cas, but what about you movin’ home? What am I supposed to do with all this?”
Dean rolls his eyes. “He’s talking about a video game,” he says again. “Team Fortress 2.”
Ash presses the knuckles of one hand into his eye and yawns. “Gettin’ fucking late. I should get out of your way.”
“Every time I’ve walked somewhere in town by myself. It doesn’t happen in the house.” Dean waves his hand through the air as if it will help him explain. “I’m not just sitting in my room and suddenly don’t know where I am. But often enough I programmed the address of the house and the pool into my GPS just in case.”
Despite Meg’s insistence, he’d left the club without exchanging numbers with the other man. Since he was working, Will had to spend the majority of the evening helping the band but managed to slip away for a song or two several more times. Rather than stressing over what he should do or where it was going, Castiel took Meg’s advice and just enjoyed dancing with a good-looking man who was obviously interested in him. It was completely outside of his comfort zone, but he had a good enough time that he’s been thinking all week about doing it again.
Two of the younger girls in the first row pull Dean’s attention away from Justin. They both clearly enjoy swimming, but the taller brunette needs to pay attention to the angle her arms hit the water or she’ll pull a muscle. Dean points it out to Garth, who says he’s been trying to correct the habit for weeks. He’s walking back to the bleachers when a hushed voice, clipped in anger, draws his attention.
“The meatballs are already in the oven. I’m just making the rest of these to freeze, but you can throw the cauliflower in.” He motions toward a large plastic bag on the counter. “I already mixed it up. Just dump it in the casserole dish there and put it in the oven.”
Ben nods and turns back to Cas. “Okay, so at school I’ll call you Mr. Novak and at home, I’ll call you Cas. Is that okay?”
“Huh,” Dean says as if not knowing one’s neighbors is a situation that has never occurred to him before. “Well, anyway, this sexy nurse is my sister-in-law, Jess, and that giant pirate dork is my brother, Sam. They’ll try and tell you they came out with us for Ben, but really they just wanted an excuse to dress up and steal Ben's candy,” Dean jokes, earning him an elbow in the ribs from Jess.
The wait after they check in is longer than Dean appreciates. Even though he loves Jody, he has had it with the whole medical field. He sits back, resting his head on the wall, and closes his eyes. The song is completely different from the one stuck in his head before. This one is softer, more ethereal. The tune seems familiar, but he can’t place it.
A spiral of depression and partying followed, until the night a month later when he woke in a hospital bed hooked up to monitors with an IV in his arm and a tube down his throat. Meg sat beside the bed, looking even tinier than usual in a pair of black tights and a baggy sweater, pale and drained. When she saw he was awake, she crawled onto the bed with him and curled against his chest. With a voice that trembled, she explained how the hospital had called because she was listed as his emergency contact in his phone. A customer at the club where he’d been partying found him passed out in the hallway to the bathroom and called 911. The ER doctor had already diagnosed alcohol poisoning and started treatment by the time Meg arrived. She explained, voice thick with unshed tears, that he’d started having convulsions shortly after the ambulance arrived. The nurse had told her that if he hadn’t been found when he had, he would likely have died or had lasting brain damage. The last drink before he passed out, one he doesn’t even remember, is the last one he’s ever had.
the reason,” Dr. Harris says. He and Charlie share an unimpressed look over Dean’s head. “How long do the dizzy spells last? Have you lost consciousness or fallen because of them?”
“You really should join us in the twenty-first century, Castiel. The grunge era is over,” Balthazar throws back, stretching his arms over his head. His movements cause Meg to roll more firmly onto his lap, but she doesn’t react.
Dean’s eyes narrow at that. “That’s what he does? He teaches kids with Autism?” he asks sharply. At her nod, he forces out a breath. “He knew? They all knew. All these weeks, everyone at the school knew what was going on and they never said anything. That’s why they didn’t tell me what his special classroom was.”
“Hey, this is Castiel, Gabriel, and Kali,” Dean announces, attracting everyone’s attention. He motions around the room, introducing each person in turn. Dean’s father appears younger than Castiel pictured him from Dean’s description, but Bobby is exactly as he imagined, snarled baseball cap and all. He smiles at Sam, Jess, and Jo in turn, but Castiel’s eyes linger on the man in the dining room when Dean introduces him as Ash.
Dean glances over to where his son, Ben, sits in a corner booth, his dark head bent over the latest in a long line of coloring books about planets and outer space. His ever-present stuffed dog, Benson, is sitting on the table next to him. The first day of kindergarten is tomorrow; the first of thirteen years of school nights Dean is going to have to face. That deserves another long swallow if anything does.
Dean turns to stare out the side window, but he knows John will keep badgering him until Dean gives him something. “Last weekend, when you kicked me out of the pool, I wandered into this music shop downtown, and there was a piano. That’s all.”
Castiel raises one eyebrow. “Are you?”
While Cas boots up his computer and Ben transfers all the pieces for his robot into the living room, Dean runs out to the garage to throw a load of laundry in the wash. No matter what else is happening, the day-to-day things need to get done. While he loads the washing machine, Dean tries to imagine Cas at his house, doing all the little chores that make the house run. Washing clothes, cleaning the bathroom, dusting, and vacuuming. For some reason, he has a hard time picturing Cas doing such mundane things.
Ben and Cas get the drinks while Dean brings the serving dishes to the table. Dean serves each of them before taking his seat, earning another small smile from Cas. He’s quiet while they eat though Ben and Dean fill the silence with stories about school, work, and their last game night with Charlie. Sitting down to dinner as a family was never a positive memory for him before Dean. With Ben and Dean chattering him around him as he eats, Cas finds himself smiling again for no reason other than that he’s happy.
Dean swallows hard. “I want to be that person for him.”
Cas is grinning when he turns back around in the seat, but he falters when he sees the scowl on Dean’s face. “What’s wrong?”
An answering smile tugs at Cas’ lips and he responds to Dean’s greeting by leaning forward to kiss him softly. He isn’t expecting Dean to roll into him, one hand coming up to bury in Cas’ hair as he anchors them together, the kiss turning passionate in less than the time it takes for Cas to pull in a ragged breath.
But it’s also not as hard as he was expecting. So he’s a spectator now. Sam was right; it isn’t the end of the world. What he’s gained has more than made up for what he lost.
“Nothing is wrong, Bobby. I swear.” He sighs and looks through the window. “Look, can I get back out there? We’re gonna get behind, and the guys will have my ass.”
Cas sets the bag on the floor at the end of the couch and leans back, letting his head rest against Dean’s shoulder. “I did. I’m glad I could work here so I still got to see you. I hate that we’re so busy.”
Dean slaps his phone and throws it across the room when the alarm goes off. Charlie’s footsteps stop outside his door, and he buries his head under his pillow so he can’t hear her walk away. He didn’t go to the pool last night either. Instead, he burrowed under the covers and pretended to be asleep. Hiding in his room was easier than dealing with whatever was happening to him.
Jody looks straight at Dean. “That what happened?”
Natalie finally tears her eyes away and leans over to bump his arm. “He’s never brought someone to a show before.”
Dean barely pays attention to the first few events. The phantom music isn’t as loud today, but his legs are antsier than usual. After Dean presses on his thigh for the fourth time to stop it from bouncing, Cas turns his hand over and lays it on Dean’s leg palm up. Dean glances at him out of the corner of his eye, but Cas appears to be engrossed in the women’s 150m freestyle event going on in the pool. Cas’ palm is callused from his drum sticks and hauling equipment, and Dean traces the rough skin with his fingertips for a few moments.
as it is an
Boyfriend is something else Dean hasn’t experienced. He’s gone out with people, sure—men and women—but boyfriend implies more than casual hookups and drinks a few times per month. It’s cooking for two and not going to bed alone, even when they’re just sleeping. It’s also kissing whenever he wants.
into the cassette player and it picks up on
but it’s not quite right,” Ash says, stroking his chin. “A different arrangement maybe? Whatever it is, you’re good.”
“Nah, leaving the door open in case there are any eligible bachelorettes here today,” she returns with a grin that almost immediately clouds. “Honestly, though, everything with Dorothy really wore me out. Not sure I’m ready to jump back on the horse just yet.”
He wanders for a while, talking a little bit with each knot of people he passes. Who would have thought that he and Cas have so many friends? It’s both startling and a little humbling how many people came to celebrate this new chapter of their lives.
Jody motions him to a seat at the round table in the corner of the room and she takes the chair next to him. Mrs. Johnson sits across from them. “First, I want to assure you again, Mr. Winchester—”
Jenny chuckles. “A little. But it makes sure your arm is nice and clean.”
Ash sighs, sliding one hand over to rest on Dean’s knee. “I don’t know. We gotta talk this out, I know, but we’ve got a whole house full of people waitin’ for us. Now isn’t the time.”
“What the hell?” Dean barks. He winces at the sharpness of his tone, but Cas’ words are like a punch to the chest. Confusion overtakes him. Why would Cas want that?
Cas’ protest is a breathy whisper when Dean rocks forward, pressing until his whole body is one hard, hot line pinning Cas to the door. “Dean,” he tries again urgently, but he’s cut off when Dean covers his mouth with a kiss that goes from teasing to filthy within seconds.
“Look at the spacesuits, Mr. Novak,” Ben calls, tugging his father over to the display and leaving Castiel to trail behind. “They used two different suits for the Apollo mission. They used the A7L and the A7L-B.” He reads the information off the sign next to the glass, but Castiel has no doubt Ben already knew it. Normally, he’s attentive and interested in anything Ben has to say, as he finds the child’s intellect to be fascinating. This afternoon, however, is becoming a struggle and the reason is standing less than a foot away.
Next, Castiel started replacing the manicured formal landscaping with a chaotic cottage garden filled with any kind of flower or accessory that caught his eye. The riot of colors and wild menagerie of stone, glass, and metal creatures made Castiel very happy. The transformation was finally completed this summer when Castiel finished the backyard by adding a pond and beehives. Now, when Castiel sits on the back patio with his tea, he feels peaceful rather than boxed in. After all, it isn’t as if the matriarch of the Novak family will be visiting him in Lawrence anyway. He is expected to return home to Pontiac, Illinois on the appropriate holidays and special occasions instead.
Ben seemed happy and relaxed when he came out of Pamela’s office though Dean was slightly on edge because of the four cups of coffee he downed during the three hours he was waiting. Pam told him he could go explore the neighborhood or get something to eat while she was working with Ben, but Dean was too anxious to leave Ben alone. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Pam, but what if Ben got upset about something? What if he got angry and Pam didn’t know what to do? Dean would feel horrible if Ben hurt her. So Dean sat in the office just in case, drinking coffee, watching the co-eds stroll past the windows, and playing with his phone.
Castiel lets himself out of the car and the walk through the cold night air to his front door is less than comfortable with the tightness of his pants. Dean waits until he lets himself in and closes the door behind him before he backs out of the driveway. Physically exhausted, but running on a wave of energy that thrums through his blood stream, Castiel climbs the stairs to his room. Although Juliet tries to weave her way in front of him, he gently nudges her back into the hallway before he closes the door.
When Castiel opens the door, Dean looks slightly apprehensive, but his face lights up immediately. He steps through the door and pulls Castiel into a quick kiss before setting down the backpack he had slung over his shoulder and giving Juliet a pat on the head. So he’d taken Castiel’s advice to pack a bag seriously.
Cas’ eyes widen at his words. He stares, blue irises a thin ring around his pupils, right into Dean’s eyes, their chests rising and falling in time with each other. Finally, after what feels like forever, Cas swallows, throat working hard, and he nods with a slight dip of his head.
“You’re nuts, man. You’re gonna get hit by a car.”
Ben drags his heels on the way into the clinic, but at least he’s not melting down. Dean puts his arm around Ben’s shoulder to keep him moving and Ben leans into him. He hums under his breath as they walk, but it’s so soft no one else will even notice.
Dean doesn’t answer for a moment, but he thinks about what Cas said. Shit, this is complicated. Give in, don’t give in. How is he supposed to know what the right answer is? Well, if Cas says it’s better to stop, they’ll stop. After all, it’s kind of nice to have someone else tell him what to do for a change.
Charlie slants him a look. “The guy’s been all over you since you met and you weren’t sure he was into guys? Geez. You look so much smarter than you are.”
It’s been seven years since he’s heard those words from Ash, words he never thought he’d hear again. They rip through him like a jagged knife, carving him open to allow all the pain that he’s buried to seep out. “I can’t. I can’t fucking do this. It’s, fuck, Ash, why are you doing this to me?” Dean pleads, his voice breaking as he bites back a sob. He will not cry over this. It’s not fucking worth it.
Castiel watches her go, aware that she’s adding a little extra sashay to her walk.
Dean surges forward and captures Cas’ face in the palms of his hands. He presses a kiss to Cas’ forehead, lips warm against Cas’ skin. “Look at me,” he says, forcing Cas to meet his eyes. When Cas finally raises his gaze to meet Dean’s vibrant green eyes, Dean pulls in a shaky breath. “Castiel Novak, that is never going to happen. You are who I want. Ash is my past, but you’re my future. I know you’re not in a good place right now, but I need you to trust me. No matter what Ash thinks he wants, I want to be with you and that is what matters.”
The car comes to a smooth stop in the middle of the bay and Cas kills the engine before climbing out. He has changed out of his school clothes into jeans and a soft brown long sleeved t-shirt. His ridiculous tan trench coat falls to his knees when he stands up. He closes the door behind him and turns to Dean as the garage door slides back into place. “Hello, Dean,” he says softly, eyes searching Dean’s face, but Dean isn’t sure what he’s looking for.
He can see the Woodlawn Elementary booth less than fifty yards ahead and even from this distance he can tell that Meg and Balthazar are arguing about something. The two of them have been testier with each other than usual for the last month. Cas is almost certain that something happened between them but neither is talking about it.
Sam pushes back. “I’m not sure Cas knows that you two are just friends, Dean. The guy looks upset. You need to talk to him.” Dean shoves again and Sam turns to the side to let him pass. “Just think about it,” he adds as Dean reaches the top of the stairs.
Ash swings back around and meets Cas’ eyes. “Like I said, I know how to push his buttons. It wasn’t hard to play him enough to get him to swing back to me, just like he does every time.”
Dean takes stock of his body, face burning at the thought of needing this stranger’s help to piss. “No, I’m good.”
Dean swam, and John studied with great coaches all over the United States and passed what he learned on to Dean. John had been on the swim team in high-school, so he wasn’t starting from scratch, but he lacked the collegiate level experience most of the other coaches had. He threw himself into it, pushing himself just as hard as he pushed Dean. Eventually, the work paid off, and Dean ranked number one in the state by 10th grade and was being scouted for the Olympics.
Carl is standing behind Cas, so he can’t see the salesman roll his eyes. “I’m sure you could get used to it,” he starts, but Dean cuts him off.
Juliet shoves against him as he fills her food and water dishes and he chuckles softly. He doesn’t have time for belly-rubs if he’s going to make it to the bakery and over to Dean’s before Bobby arrives. Given that it’s been beautiful for the last week, he opts to take the Camaro rather than the SUV and he enjoys the way the car purrs as he pulls out of the garage.
That’s the rub, isn’t it? The last fifteen years have been a winding road that always ends up right back at Michael. Maybe he’s not as afraid of Dean hurting him as he is of him hurting Dean. The pain in Michael’s gray eyes when Cas turned away and walked out the door still haunts him. “I just need to be sure,” he chokes out.
“Too bad. I like that little spitfire,” Gabriel declares, rubbing his hands together. He leans up between the seats, then pulls a piece of gum from his pocket. He unwraps it, pops it in his mouth, and then chews in the most annoying way possible for a few minutes. “We shoulda’ come for Thanksgiving so we could get a taste of the bird she whipped up for you and Balthazar,” he adds before popping and cracking the gum noisily.
Dean cringes internally and looks at the picture Ben has clearly just started. He intended to stop Ben once the last picture was done, but the uncomfortable conversation with Ellen distracted him. Dean glances up at Bobby and their eyes meet in the shared knowledge that Dean has a decision to make. Dean knows that Bobby will back his play either way, but he’s not sure what to do. Let Ben finish the picture, making them way later getting home than Dean wanted? Or insist he finish it another time, taking the crayons and sparking a meltdown that will end with Ben in tears and Dean mentally and emotionally exhausted? Neither is a stellar option.
“You okay?” Dean asks, breaking him out of his increasingly panicked cycle of thoughts.
The muffled sounds of little feet on the carpeting warn Dean just before Ben launches himself at the bed. He lands on top of Dean, drawing a gasp as his elbow catches Dean in the stomach. “Daddy, daddy, daddy,” Ben calls, shaking Dean and burrowing his face against Dean’s cheek.
Sam clears his throat awkwardly. “Hey, I think your mom said she needed someone to run to the Roadhouse and pick up drinks and stuff for tomorrow. You wanna take my car and head over?” he asks Ash. He’s doing that thing where he flicks his eyes from Dean to Ash and it’s obvious that he’s trying to separate them before something bursts wide open.
“Is that it? I’m not allowed to give you things you want anymore because we’re not together, because there’s a different cute, blue-eyed guy sitting next to you at dinner? You never cared how much money I spent on you or Ben when Lisa was comin’ around.”
“Gone?”
He turns the TV on. The signal’s good enough that Hogan’s Heroes is almost watchable. It makes for good background noise while he sorts through his and Sam’s clothes to determine what’s worth saving. Sometimes, not even Dean can get the blood splatters off a pair of jeans or shirt and regular wear breaks down everything eventually. Which is why Dean isn’t prepared for John Banner’s voice to fade into static and the bed to dip with extra weight as feathers rustle through the air.
“Dean?” Sam bursts out of the house a second later. “Dean!”
Dean gawks at her, incapable of answering. She turns away from him in disgust and leads Layla back towards their car. He waits until they’ve driven away, and the rain starts to soak through the outer layer of his coat and to the lining, before walking to his car.
“Hey,” he squeezes out and slips an easy smile on his face, aiming for lecherousness and landing closer to desperate. She shoots him a politely amused smile and then ignores him when Elijah steps forward and reaches out for her hands, wrapping them gently into his.
Because nothing good in their lives comes for free, and Dean’s been waiting for something to come up.
Sam drops his bag onto the far bed, frowning, and Dean shrugs into his jacket, checking he’s got his wallet and cash on him before offering Sam a salute and walking back out.
Cas has the decency to look a little embarrassed, and his pupils widen when he dips his gaze down to the scar before looking back up guiltily. Dean holsters the gun and picks up the blue flannel shirt he’s been tearing the seams out of for the last few minutes. He rips the sleeve in half a little more viciously than necessary and tosses the stained piece into the garbage can at his feet.
instead of some
It’s so unbelievably Sam to come back at someone with a fucking scripture one liner that Dean huffs in stunned amazement. Then Sue Ann tries to tear away from Sam with a scream and the room erupts.
“Some place safe, idiot.”
“I was checking out demons in Tennessee, and out of nowhere, they took a hard left. Booked it up here,” Sam explains. Dean’s hope that finding Sam would explain something—
Tipping his head from one side to another to examine it, he feels the taut pull that’s been bothering him since the house. Four fingers spread across the skin over his jugular on the left side and the tip of the thumb sits right in the dip where the bottom corner of his jaw meets his neck on the other side. The imprint of Cas’ palm is a wide spread of tissue pressed over his larynx and trachea.
“The first one,” Cas answers decisively. “Though I didn’t call you a hooker. I said—"
Seven hours and change after leaving Bobby’s, they pull into the parking lot of a motel on the outskirts of Jefferson City. Dean lets the car roll to a stop outside the office so Sam can slide out and get them a room. They haven’t talked much, Sam buried in one of the books he’d taken from Bobby’s house, which, weird as hell. Bobby’s always been so protective of the books in his home and there’s no telling when they’ll be back around to his place. No guarantee the thing is gonna make it back in one piece.
Elijah doesn’t react to the nickname. He leans forward as if he could cross the space between them without thinking about it.
“I don’t buy anything,” Elijah corrects irritably. It’s an odd enough statement that Dean slows down his pissed-off retreat long enough to wait for Elijah to say more. “The painting.”
Dean chokes on the angel’s name.
“We have a lot of planning to do for our next service,” she says. Her eyes are cold when she lifts them back up to meet Dean's, and he knows he's being dismissed. He shoves himself up onto his feet and makes his own excuses to leave. Sue Ann though, she looks back at Elijah, her expression hard. Roy doesn't seem to have noticed the change in his wife's demeanor and tells him not to be a stranger.
“Killing? We can’t kill him!” He snaps the book shut with a dull thunk of leather against parchment.
—shrivels away into nothing. He exhales shakily through his nose, and lets the conversation happen around him until a hand grabs his shoulder.
“Shut your pie hole.” Dean leans over and twists the volume knob on the tape deck up, effectively ending the conversation.
“Dean!” Sam shouts and he covers the distance between them, throwing an arm out to brace Dean before he hits the floor. Distantly, he’s aware of Bobby hurrying over to them.
“Don’t,” he chokes out, the sound catching on his teeth, too quiet for Sam to hear. His vision clears with a rush of white blue heat and he can’t tell if it’s memory or Castiel, but he shoves Cas back and away from him with a vicious flare of anger anyway. The angel’s presence fades to white noise and then silence. Dean knows he’s still there, lurking somewhere he can’t feel him. He grits his teeth and asks Sam, “Anything else I should know?”
“Well, yeah, that’s why I—me and Sam,” he corrects hastily, “had to give it back to you.”
Sam shakes Dean by the shoulder. “What about the angels? Dean, what’s happening?”
“Dean, you gonna order?”
He pushes away from Castiel, clearing his throat and clenching his jaws with a hard swallow as he meets the angel’s steady gaze. Without waiting for the angel to say anything, Sam puts out his hand.
“Dean?” Bobby tries.
“Remember that thing about ideas?” Dean asks. Cas dips his chin once in a quick nod. “Well, I got a couple to pass the time before Sam gets back if you’re interested. Consider it a welcome to Earth freebie for saving my brother’s life.”
After a few minutes, he forces himself to walk away from the safety of the grave, hoping whatever's followed him at least waits until he has a weapon in hand before showing itself. He's been alive for a few precious minutes and desperately wants to stay that way.
“Bobby, is this…?” he asks, feeling a grin starting as he scrapes his knuckles against the wall, feeling the rough texture against them.
“Excuse me, psychic wonder, but from where I was kneeling, it looked like the guy had wings.”
She looks up at him suspiciously. “What about him?”
“Yeah? Well, what are you then?”
The TV on the shelf to his left clicks on with a hiss of static and the light from outside is bright enough that when he turns to shut it off, he can see the shadow of wings on the wall behind him.
“Well, there goes my theory,” Dean grouses, throwing up his hands. “Thought maybe we had a reaper on our hands, but nothing adds up. The times of death should have been the same.”
“Dude. Brad Pitt.” Sam watches him wave a hand and gesture at his own body like he’s trying to make him see something that's clearly only in Dean's imagination. “Black suit, deva— uh, doesn’t know how to act like a person?”
“Hi, Sam,” Henriksen says casually. “It’s been a while.”
He blinks and the tent sharpens back into focus around him. Elijah is just a man, pulling his hand away and stepping back so Sam can haul Dean back to his feet.
It’s about willpower, Missouri said. The words and accessories are just extra. Useful for the folks who need them, but not necessary, and don’t be ashamed if you use them. His power’s right there, simmering under the surface, waiting to be used. He doesn’t need to be passive and wait for a thing to happen. He just needs to reach out and grab it.
“I’m going to reach down your throat and rip out your lungs,” she threatens. Dean leans forward and smiles.
“So, instead of Castiel…?”
“Sure thing.”
Footsteps. Fast and heavy behind him. He tenses, preparing for a blow—but it doesn't come. Sam shoulders past him and toward Sue Ann. His brother grabs her by the arm, his face ugly with fury, and the verse drips with sarcasm as he spits it into her face, “With his mouth the impious man destroyeth his neighbor; But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered.”
“Yeah… and so are the deaths. Six of them. Usually the next day. All of them blamed on electrical fires or lightning strikes. Guess what else they have in common.”
“Chanukah,” Dean replies sarcastically before looking sheepish. “It’s a cellphone. Call me. Me and Sam. Our cell numbers are already programmed in, and I can show you how to add more minutes if you want.”
He walks the perimeter of the store, checking aisles as he passes them. Partway down the back wall, the hairs on his arms and neck stand up. He whips around, reaching for the gun holstered at the small of his back, and finds Elijah observing him from a few paces away. He looks just as windswept and wild as before, eyes over bright in the fluorescent lights as they flicker above them. Dean’s heart lurches uncomfortably against his ribs and he smothers his body’s reaction when Elijah’s eyes drift downward, sweeping over his chest and body.
“You check the house,” Dean instructs, slamming the door behind him and pulling up the collar of his canvas coat. “Spell books, altars, anything that might look important. I’ll keep an eye on Eli.”
Dean’s silent on the other end and then, “The guy in the parking lot?”
, a voice whispers behind him and Dean whips around and slams his shoulders into the wall.
Zachariah’s expression sinks into something neutral and reasonable. He grips Castiel’s shoulder amiably. “Consider it a temporary reassignment. Oh, don’t worry, we’ll have you back on the field soon enough. God has big plans for Winchester.”
“Dean…” he starts, only to stop and look at him more carefully, and Dean realizes he’s digging into him a little. Prying where Dean can’t exactly stop him and getting ready to pull his ‘I know things’ crap. Cas nods like he’s figured something out. “I understand.”
Dusty shelves filled with books, a filing cabinet in one corner, and a desk with a wicker back chair behind it. Bingo. Sam eases his way into the room and shuts the door behind him. There’s a book on the desk that turns out to be some old translation of the Bible and a notebook filled with cramped handwriting. He skims the page and decides Roy must be working on a new sermon. Nothing more sinister than the usual stuff guys like him preach.
Sam sighs. There it is: the Dad part of the equation to Dean’s bullshit.
“Okay, walk me through that shot,” Dean says, pitching his voice so that the words won’t carry through the nearly empty hall.
Sam’s eyebrows shoot up and he chokes back a laugh. “You gave him a nickname?”
“Normally I’d be really, uh… honored to meet. An angel. You. Especially since you—but,” he manages awkwardly. This is an angel wearing his brother’s body.
Lying to Dean isn’t as hard as Sam thought it would be. Either Dean’s too exhausted to call him out on his line about a specialist in some podunk city in Nebraska, or Sam hasn’t lied to him enough. Not about the things that matter, anyway. Dean’s in the passenger seat, so there’s not much he can do about it when Sam turns west when they hit I-80. He spends the first part of the drive trying to explain car maintenance between bouts of coughing and paging tiredly through a shockingly well-read copy of Hocus Pocus that Sam saw him pull out from under the front bench while they were passing through Lincoln. There’s a white library sticker with 813.54 in bold black Arial font on the spine under the cracked and yellow vinyl wrapped around the cover.
Turning away is easier this time, though Dean has to force himself to walk casually. He is not fleeing the conversation. The cashier doesn’t acknowledge him when he walks past her and out the door.
Dean’s chest thuds painlessly and the icy cold of his extremities floods with blood as his heart pumps, healthy and strong. His cheeks and neck flush warm under the cool touch of Elijah’s hand and heat settles between his legs. He’s never been more glad to be wearing loose-fitted clothes.
Cas kisses the center of his chest in reply, and the tips of his fingers skim down across the smooth keloid tissue on his throat. Things blur a little after that. Dean pulls and pushes Cas until he stretches out across the bed, and Cas lets Dean pin him down by one wrist and curl a fist into his hair to pull his head back and suck a mark high up his neck. Payback for the scar, he jokes, and Cas grits his teeth and goes tense under him until he’s satisfied. The mark fades in a flicker of white energy that makes his skin momentarily transparent. Cas tells him to do it again. Dean chuckles and leaves a fading trail of them down Cas' body, then shoulders between Cas’ thighs to put his mouth to gentler use.
“I didn’t think you’d let me in after our last talk,” Cas admits, blue eyes flicking away from the gun and to Dean’s face, pinning him with the intensity of it.
“A miracle,” Dean repeats.
Halfway from the car to the door, Castiel grabs him and hauls his body to a stumbling stop. Wings flare out behind him with an audible flutter of feathers and then wrap around him and what the hell? It’s the second or third time tonight Dean’s sure he’s spotted them, but unlike the transparent shadows from before, the damn things are nearly opaque now. If he weren’t already reaching for his gun, he might have reached out to touch one of them.
If it's still there, Dean's sure it's waiting for something, but he can’t consider that possibility yet. His mind shies away from it like a horse afraid of its own shadow.
“I had… another vessel. I’d been speaking to him for months in preparation for returning to Earth,” Castiel answers and he straightens up. “Dean asked me to stay with him and I could not deny him. He’s told you this.”
Missouri presses on. “If you have something else he touched…”
“Right, yeah, he mentioned that. Said I should ask you about that, Reverend—”
Joshua laughs, a little unkindly, and Sam debates the value of hanging up on him. The plastic casing creaks under his fingers, and he clears his throat.
“Uh, well…” Not here in front of all these people and helping them fall a little bit more for the shit Le Grange’s preaching. He glances around, eyes landing on people struggling to breathe even with the help of oxygen masks, and then looks back up at the healer. “Maybe you should pick someone else, Eli.”
“It’ll what? Make you realize you’re just as much of a monster as I am?” Dean demands. It’s not what he means to say, but when is half the shit that comes out of his mouth what he really means?
“Nice job,” says Bobby.
“So, there’s a guy out in Nebraska. Hooked up with a reverend and his wife last summer, claiming he could heal people.”
Fuck, he needs answers. Sam must have done something to get him back, which means he needs to track down his brother. The register still has cash in it. Dean counts it and guesses that it might be enough for gas or food for a few days. He’s not hungry yet, though he feels like he should be. It’s been four—no, forty—
“Meg.”
“Is there something wrong with my orders, Castiel?” Zachariah asks. He doesn't turn around.
Elijah grimaces and looks out across the lawn toward the tent. “When I look at people, I see everything they are. I can’t necessarily understand it all, but I know them.”
Castiel praises him anyway and Dean’s body flushes with heat.
“So what’d it cost?” Dean demands from the corner where he’s put himself, so he doesn’t put his fist through Sam’s teeth.
“Is there anything in there about how to break the seal? Er, pentacle?” Sam asks. Interesting as the bit about the Aramaic is, it doesn’t help right now. “I could definitely use something like this in a book I’m writing, but I’d like to be a little accurate, you know.”
Sam frowns, but pulls a notebook out of his bag. He reaches for the pen on the bedside table and uncaps it with his teeth, scribbling a few lines and watching the ink go from faded to dark blue in a few strokes.
She whips around to face him. “Is it true an angel saved you brother?”
“I’m fine.” Dean keeps shaking his head, like he’s trying to dislodge something from it. “Gotta… I know, Cas, it’s okay. We’ll go.”
“I don’t know,” Dean grinds out.
“Ain’t afraid of God here,” Dean snipes, ripping his arm out of the older cop's hands and crossing over to where Sam’s waiting for him. Sam's rattling out of his skin and desperate to talk.
“Couple of hours ago, you were saying I wasn't," Dean throws back at him.
“Okay, Dean. Hey, listen, are you sure you wanna go tonight? I don’t mind,” Sam asks when they get into the room and Dean starts looking around. He flips the blankets up on the corner of his bed and squints at the sheets before pulling those up and looking at the mattress. The last thing they need is bedbugs. Or hex bags.
“Did you see anything when he healed me?” he demands.
He angles the paper when it’s complete.
“Good, then you can put this one back where it belongs.” Zachariah pulls his hand back, the matter settled, and starts to walk away. His wings pull up in preparation for flight, and Castiel can’t let him leave. He can’t disobey, but perhaps he can convince Zachariah. His brother has always been reasonable. Castiel's boots scuff the pavement when he steps forward.
“What, you think I don’t have caller ID?” she asks, and Sam laughs at himself. “You boys really put your foot in it out there. I’m not gonna be able to do much from where I’m at.”
Cas swipes his thumb across Dean's jugular and is gone with a rustle of feathers when Dean blinks. Dean's clenches his hand shut around empty air.
“Or it’s a trap.” There’s steel in Dean’s voice. A mimicry of John Winchester, down to the way Dean’s posture and expression changes. It makes Sam want to punch him. “A monster’s a monster, Sam.”
“There’s probably a place we can stop at in Ford City when we get there. His place doesn’t open until 11 tomorrow.”
Dean nods, tucks himself back against the door, and waits.
“Okay, lesson number one: Don’t sniff people unless they’re into it.”
“What the hell happened?” he demands, reaching out to cup his brother’s face in one hand. Castiel stirs in the corner of his mind and twists down his arm and into his hand, icy under his skin and then nothing but heat against his palm. Light pours from his hand and his vision whites out briefly, focus slipping as Cas nudges him gently to the side. He feels Sam flinch and when he’s pulled firmly back into himself again, Sam is blinking at him in surprise. Dean drops his hand and checks Sam's face again. The bruises and lacerations are gone.
Sam scoffs. “He told me angels need consent.”
Zachariah considers him for a long stretch of time.
“This body’s a no fly zone until further notice.”
. So, he’s been hunting Lilith instead.
“Our orders were wrong,” Uriel reasons.
Dean taps the eraser against his bottom lip and tries to remember if he's missing anything. He comes up empty. Which means this is it. The value of Dean Winchester’s life, scribbled into the margins on page thirty-two of a stolen Vonnegut novel.
“Ever heard of knocking?” he demands, following the wave of dark hair across Cas’ forehead, where it frames the curiously indifferent expression he’s wearing at the weapon pointed right at him. Dean’s not even sure it would sting if he pulled the trigger.
“Whoa, hey,” he stammers and steps back. Elijah’s hand drops away with a reluctant slide down his arm that ends with fingers brushing the back of Dean’s wrist. He takes another step back and directly into the edge of a bookshelf, jarring his elbow and shoulder hard enough to rattle the display. “Getting ideas. I’m not…”
“So, what did you find?” Dean asks finally, and Sam bursts, twisting towards him in the passenger seat and pulling out Sue Ann’s book.
This is not what he wants to happen. Especially with the way Layla and her mother both straighten up in their seats in front of him. He’s so used to being able to get away with making a snide remark without consequence that it’s damn fucking embarrassing to have the attention of the entire tent on him. Real easy for the reverend to draw attention to him when he’s only a couple weeks off from being dead. He probably looks about as intimidating as a teddy bear right now.
“That shouldn’t be an issue,” Cas assures, and he reaches out to touch the sleeve of Dean’s flannel. “I’ve observed Earth for millions of years. Just because I’ve never engaged in sex, doesn’t mean I don’t know what it involves. What would you like to do?”
means something to this complete stranger who might be something not human if Sam digs up anything to connect the dots being placed down before them.
“Bullshit, Sam. You and your demon hiding in the dark.” His stomach drops, staring at her in shock. She lashes out at him again, hitting him so hard in the chest that he goes careening back into the floor behind the desk. She stalks closer. “How many innocent people has Ruby burned through for kicks, huh, Sam? Girls just like me. And you don’t send her back to Hell?”
“What the hell?” Bobby demands.
Sam watches him pace the motel room. Ruby’s knife is laying in the middle of the floor where he dropped it when Castiel knocked him out and Bobby’s sitting on the edge of the bed, though Sam's barely paying attention to him. He’s still trying to wrap his head around the story Dean’s telling them. Castiel, actual very real Angel of the Lord, pulled Dean from Hell, remade his body, and then shoved him back into it. Castiel then apparently shoved himself in there too. Not that Sam’s going to word it exactly like that to Dean.
“Sam?”
“I’ve been on Earth for a year. I know what a cellphone is.” Cas pockets the phone with a pleased smile. “Thank you, Dean.”
“Sounds like you’ve got a plan then,” he manages, when the quiet settles into something too comfortable. Cas looks thoughtfully down at where he’s still clasping Dean’s wrist.
"Pretty sure he's not a bird.”
Sam shoves his laptop into Dean’s face and lets him look at the electrical storm map. It could be naturally occurring, but Castiel rises up while he reads, so Dean finds himself nodding and passing the laptop back up.
“If you’d told me about this, Sam, maybe I wouldn’t be dead,” says a voice behind him. He nearly drops the hex box in surprise and shoves the box back into place on the shelf and looks back towards the stairs. Jess smiles at him, brittle and unhappy.
“He’s hanging around inside my head. Gonna wind up figuring it out anyway,” he says defensively. “Not like it’s a secret.”
“You said six people died in the last year, right? But it’s been picking up.” Dean waits for Sam to hum in affirmation before going on. “Then let's hope Sue Ann’s not gonna risk letting Elijah off his leash on someone else too soon after that light show in the yard, so we—no,
The last thing Sam sees is the pitch-dark imprint of wings burning into his pupils as they stretch through the air above.
“Watch it,” he chastises with a gasp of laughter. Dean mutters something rude at him and screws his eyes up so they’re not looking at each other. “Oh my God, Dean, get a grip.”
“I…” Elijah glances back into the house from where he’s hovering in the doorway and swallows, eyebrows knitting together. “Dig. Please.”
“You got a pen?”
Dean swallows and nods. “You too.”
They’ll figure it out. Dean has the time.
“This might be a little above our pay grade,” Sam says eventually, voice raw and tight with old grief. He’s settled back into place on the couch, neck on the armrest and beer tucked between his hip and the back cushion. Dean’s laid out on the floor, staring at the ceiling and wondering why the beer hasn’t even given him a buzz. He can’t even tell he drank it.
“Sonuvabitch, really, Sam?” he grouses, sitting up and flinging one of his discarded socks in Sam’s direction. His brother splutters in disgust and flings the offending garment away.
When she’s out of the room, Dean drops the pretense and turns the full force of his attention onto Sam, who’s trying to pretend he didn’t hear anything, flipping through a pamphlet with fake interest.
Cas pockets the necklace and starts toward Sue Ann, something silver and sharp dropping into his hand as he advances. She shrieks and tries to press herself back into the books, and Dean's almost tempted to let Cas have his way, but they can't afford more deaths here. Not even this bitch, shitty as she is, should wind up a smear on the wall. He catches Cas by the arm, expecting the angel to break his hold without even flinching, but Cas halts his rampage and twists around to face him, aiming the full force of his wrath at Dean, who blinks stupidly at him in surprise.
Sam retreats and Dean relaxes a little. He and Bobby have been a pain in the ass all day, lurking when they think Dean won’t notice, but he’s always been a paranoid asshole and Hell only made it worse. Add a hyper vigilant angel on his shoulder and Dean knows they keep watching him. He's not worried they're gonna try to gank him anymore. Mostly. Doesn't make him any less irritated at the babysitting though.
The room goes deathly quiet and Bobby looks over at Dean. The monster wearing Dean's face is standing there, head tilted at him. Dean’s green eyes are lit up with power, too bright and cold. Staring into him like he's a particularly interesting insect. Sam lurches back up from the floor beside him and pulls the knife out. Bobby flinches, sure he’s going to stab Dean, but Dean grabs Sam by the arm without even blinking, and reaches up to press two fingers to the center of his forehead. Sam crumples to the floor. It turns that laser focus back on him.
He twists around and knees up onto the mattress and into Cas’ space. A thrill of satisfaction zips up his spine when Cas widens his eyes and sits back, letting Dean push him back until he hits the headboard with a thump. The deep blue of his eyes darkens as he narrows them in a wordless question. Dean straddles his thighs and grabs the shorten end of Cas’ hoodie string between his fingers. He reaches back through Cas' hair to keep the hood in place while he pulls until they're even.
Dean waits until the bartender brings him a beer. It’s cool and soothing, but the taste breaks down just enough to make it yeasty and heavy on his tongue. It’s better than the beer at Bobby’s though and that seems to cheer Dean up a little as he looks for an empty table. He doesn’t explain the game to Castiel, just starts play by himself, asking one of the servers to bring him another beer when he finishes the first one. By the time he’s started his third, Castiel thinks he has a grasp of the idea of the game, though he’s not certain of the rules being used at the other tables.
Sam nods. “Are you… staying?”
Castiel focuses on the parts of himself and his grace tucked into the spaces between Dean’s atoms and extends his power outward. He moves Dean’s body, bending him over the table and fixing his grip on the pool cue. Dean’s thoughts fragment and for a moment Castiel worries.
“What do you remember?” Bobby asks when he pulls away.
“Uriel,” Castiel greets his brother warmly. It’s only been a few days since they last saw each other, but time on Earth moves strangely and being with Dean makes him aware of every moment as it passes, marching firmly forward.
He throws himself forward and grabs the angel by the arm, thinking only that he has to stop him from killing Wright and give Dean enough time to figure out how to stop Roy. His phone rings in his pocket, barely audible over the wind and rain gusting around them.
him. Castiel loves him, from the deepest core of his soul where it presses against Castiel's grace, to the highway of nerves curving through his spine and branching across his body like wings.
Dean sparks with exasperation and nudges at Castiel, wanting back in control of his body. Castiel slips back and feels Dean shake himself out, cracking his neck and rolling his shoulders, sinking comfortably back into his body in a way that Castiel hasn’t a hope of mimicking. He twirls the pool cue through the air and moves the remaining billiard balls on the table, sliding the white one back towards him. Castiel curls his wings back around Dean’s shoulders and waits to see what Dean’s going to do.
“Bobby, it’s me!” he yells, dodging the blade and grabbing his arm. The fight leads them both further and further into the house and Dean’s certain Bobby is trying to corral him towards a devil’s trap somewhere. He manages to get hold of the knife and backs into the kitchen. “If I were a revenant or a shapeshifter, could I do this—with a silver knife?”
“Fine!” Dean snaps and Castiel pushes him aside, gripping Dean close and letting him listen in.
They drive back to the Le Grange house for hopefully the last time, Dean parking on the edge of the property to avoid attracting attention. It means having to hike the rest of the way on foot and creep through the sea of vehicles. There’s a few new cars and a dingy RV pulled up into the grassy parking lot. Roy’s starting to get attention, just like Sue Ann wanted.
“I,” Castiel hesitates, tilting his head slightly, eyes breaking from Sam’s, “
The words settled uncomfortably in Castiel’s arms and back and winds its ways into his grace, curling and twisting into knots. Zachariah inhales unnecessarily through his nose and closes his eyes. Castiel realizes that he doesn’t know what he’ll do if this isn’t enough to convince Zachariah. He feels his wings readying to move him and wonders where he'll go.
“And the rest?” Dean asks.
“With the knife?” Bobby knows Sam wouldn’t be ready to throw Dean across the room if he'd used the damn knife, but he has to ask.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Of course,” Zachariah says finally, and he seems barely contained within his vessel, on the verge of lashing out, but unwilling to do so. Castiel appreciates his control. “And
Sam stop his explanation short and nods, flipping through the pages. “There's passages about King Solomon and a seal, but the parts I think we want are in Enochian and Aramaic. I’d need at least a couple reference books to take a shot at translating any of it.”
Dean hunches his shoulders and pouts. Sam wants to find it funny, but all he can do is feel exasperated and swallow, his throat tight.
Castiel pulses, clearly even more perplexed than earlier and Dean scrubs his fingers through his hair.
“You didn’t think!” she snarls, standing in front of him. “I was trapped in my own body after that demon jumped me. Do you have any idea what that was like? Screaming for help and no one listening while I watched her murder people.”
“Shit,” she gasps when he finishes talking. “It was nice knowing you, Sam.”
The question slaps him in the face and he chokes on a denial—his brother went to hell for him, he wouldn’t let that happen—but Ruby’s gone before he can get the words out, leaving him alone with the thought that he might know his brother, but he doesn’t know Castiel. The memory of those burned out bodies haunts him. His cell phone goes off, pulling him out of his thoughts and back into the present. He checks the caller ID before flipping it open and pressing it to his ear. “Bobby?”
“Okay,” Sam agrees. He doesn’t even look surprised. They load up the Impala in silence.
The house is dead quiet save for the hum of an AC unit in the window of the living room. Dean strains to hear something else, lifting his hand up and then slowly lowering it down, palm facing the floor, as Sam clambers in after him. He reaches back for his gun and lets Sam lead them through the door into the hall and back towards the lit-up, open doorway ahead of them.
“Dude, this is kinda gay,” Dean mutters uncomfortably, jaw bouncing off the heel of Sam’s palm.
He pulls his hand away from his gun and back into view. “My eyes are up here,” he cracks.
Sam can’t help but look down at him, blinking in surprise. He and Dean have never really talked about religion outside of learning what works for killing the monsters that are tied to one or another. Christo works on demons, but not all of them, apparently. Just the ones that believe in it enough to be frightened. The ones that don't, though, well, Pastor Jim had said they'd been lucky it had.
Dean shakes his head. He tries to shrug out of Sam’s arms, but Sam tightens his grip. “They’re looking for him.” He sounds out of breath, tipping his head up to look at Sam. Blood is dripping steadily from his nose. Fear drops Sam’s stomach.
“It’s just Cas, now.”
“Dean,” Sam says a little louder and more insistent than before. “Dean, you’re glowing.”
“Then what is it, Sam? How do you explain that?” The front door opens and Dean watches Bobby start down toward them. He looks up and down the street, wondering if he could get away fast enough if they decide he's too dangerous.
Dean absolutely does.
That’s something all three of them can agree on, at least.
“It’s okay, you know I’m—”
He has the sense to lower his voice before continuing. “You don’t know shit about me or my dad. I might be a whore, but at least I ain’t a murderer.
It’s the look a kid gives an ant hill before putting their foot through it.
“We don’t know that,” Sam assures him hurriedly. His eyes are blown wide with panic. “You’re not possessed, Dean. You can’t be. We checked.”
He’s nice enough to leave off the implied ‘after you nearly killed him’, but there’s a guilty bow in Cas’ eyebrows that lasts long enough for Dean to notice.
“Ugh, what was in that stuff?” he asks. It tastes worse than the water he’d drunk in the fill-up station.
Castiel does not want to leave. In another story, Castiel might have the strength to pull away and seek out another vessel. This is not that story.
A woman ducks in front of Dean and is nearly bowled over in the process when Dean is just a little too quick for her to get out of the way in time. The drink she’s holding sloshes over the rim of the glass to the floor and all over her hand. Dean reaches out to steady her arm.
Dean spends five minutes scrubbing at a blood stain on the dashboard before Castiel hovers at the edge of his mind, asking permission to try something.
“You have new orders, Castiel.”
“I know what Passover is, but it still doesn’t make any damn sense,” Dean insists, and Sam looks up from the screen at him, perplexed. It makes more sense than reapers.
“Mom—” Layla pleads.
He hangs up and bolts across the lawn. The rain starts coming down harder, making his clothes heavier and his skin clammy. There are cars lined up and blocking his view, and Sam hits his leg against the bumper of an Oldsmobile as he passes a little too closely by it in order to keep on his current trajectory towards where he last saw the protestor.
“Uh, Cas?”
He adds in the last few credit cards—the limits on those aren't even that high, a few hundred a piece—but it doesn't help much.
“He’s talking to you right now?” Dean doesn’t look at him, scowling at thin air and shaking his head fiercely. “Dean?”
“Castiel,” he presses, “if you wou—”
“Ain’t about what
“You should…” Elijah starts and stops, clutching the edge of the lectern in one white knuckled hand as he turns back toward Sue Ann. Dean can’t see his face anymore, but the angle of his shoulders is high and tense, dropping only when Sue Ann dips her chin slightly. Elijah twists back toward him and it’s only then that Dean sees how blue his eyes are, wide and curious. “You should come up here.”
“You think so, young man?” Le Grange asks, looking straight at him. Dean’s chest pulls painfully with each rapid beat as he pulls his legs up under the chair and sits up, muttering an apology. The reverend waves it off with a smile and asks for his name.
Something massive lurks there in the darkness between Dean and the angel. Not even the light from the link is enough to illuminate it, but Sam gets a sense of how insignificantly small it makes him feel. He strains to see how far out it stretches from where it’s pinned in place. The chains binding it are different than the one he’s grabbed onto, choking it and holding it place where it struggles like a mouse in a glue trap. The connection with Dean goes straight through it, light piercing through the hidden cavity of its form, and Sam realizes with a start that this isn’t between him and the angel. It
. I’ll drag you back to hell myself,” the demon snarls. Sam starts to get up. Dean holds up a hand to stop him and Sam drops back into his seat without hesitation. It doesn’t keep him from glaring daggers at her.
“Angels,” Dean grits out, his body bowing forward in pain. “Ah fuck, make it stop. Cas, please.”
“No. I considered it, but it’s likely that would require submitting myself for… re-education, and I’m not certain it would work after what you did.”
“You know, Sue Ann’s necklace had something like this etched on it,” he says. Sam studies the upside-down triangle drawn inside a double circle and the letters around it, unable to identify what any of it means.
Her fingers slide up the inside of his thigh. Dean jerks back.
“Great. His own personal attack dog.”
will let me.”
“You came to be healed,” Elijah says and there’s no question in his voice. He says it with the same surety he had when he said Dean’s name.
He’s gone before Sam can muster up another word. Maybe he can write a list or something of stuff to ask Cas about when he, uh, apparently flies back in. There’s so much more they could add to Dad’s journal, including a new entry about angels.
“What? Where are we going?”
They pass by a white guy with neatly cut hair who’s standing in the rain and handing out papers, yelling about fraud. Dean grunts in agreement with him and gets a dirty look from a woman with a cane and a wide brimmed hat keeping the rain out of her face. Sam grimaces in apology at her.
“I sure as hell don’t deserve you riding me around like a puppet.”
“For what, Eli?”
“Doing a little shopping?”
The ground vibrates under his feet, and it rolls through like the earth might tear open under their feet. Wright turns towards the sedan and starts digging into his pocket. A bolt of lightning flashes, making Sam jerk to a stop and close his eyes shut against it.
Once they’re back at Bobby’s a few hours later and Dean’s pulled a out couple of beers, handing one of them to Sam like a peace offering, Sam decides to broach the subject again. “I know we asked why Castiel is possessing you—” he holds his hands up when Dean opens his mouth to protest, “—but why did he save you in the first place?”
“Maybe we could get it from her?” he suggests.
Sam doesn’t question the reality of Lucifer. There’s demons, there’s angels, there’s God, and that must mean Lucifer exists. Of course. He feels warm from the trembling in his arms and legs.
“You got any ideas?” he asks.
“You’ll let him die just like you did me.”
“I think I know who’s next. Remember the protestor?”
Dean shoves away from Sam and gets to his feet. He teeters for a moment and Sam thinks that he’ll pitch backwards to the floor. He starts to reach for him again, but gets waved off when Dean finds his footing. He walks back to the sink and turns on the water, splashing his face. The helplessness hits Sam between the ribs. Is this what Dean felt when his vision had first started?
He considers taking a look at what Sam’s reading, but Sam’s ducking out of the office with a pair of room keys before he can flip the book over and get a proper look at the cover.
“The girl?” Sam smiles as he hauls his boots on and starts lacing them. “I don’t pay, Dean.”
Layla looks away and through the window of the pharmacy, wearing an expression Dean’s seen on a hundred people with something to tell and the fear that they won’t be believed. He eases into an approachable slouch, unclenching the muscles of his jaw and neck and loosening his shoulders. Nonjudgmental and trustworthy.
There’s three people on the stage. Dean figures the older guy standing at the pulpit and talking down to a few people in the front row is Reverend Le Grange. Dressed in a white button down and black tie, he looks like the kinda guy most folks don’t notice on the street. Nice and friendly. The woman sitting in the chair behind him has to be his wife. She’s just as unassuming, but there’s an edge of falseness to her smiles that makes Dean’s jaw clench from looking at her.
“Dean.” Cas sighs and tips his head back against the wall.
“There were demons at the restaurant, Bobby,” Dean answers. “I killed them.”
The last thing Sam expects when he unlocks the motel door is to find Castiel sitting on the end of Dean’s bed, legs folded up like a pretzel with his elbows on his knees and watching TV. Wearing a hoodie. An angel in a hoodie. Sam tries to imagine that one in stained glass in some church in Rome and has to take a second. Mostly to absorb the fact that the angel’s watching MASH reruns while Dean field strips and cleans their guns on the rest of the untaken mattress space.
The gas station he finds is somehow empty despite being appearing well stocked and still in use, so he breaks in. He stumbles immediately toward the water bottles and grimaces when the water tastes disgusting. Oily and slick as he swallows it down. He puts the bottle down with a twist of his mouth and smacks his lips. At least the dirt taste is gone.
He has a plan.
“Enough,” he warns.
He relaxes, grateful he doesn’t need to convince her to talk to him. “Since he got here, has anything…” he shifts back on his heels and tries to look like he’s not desperate for whatever information she'll give him. “Strange happened? Beside the healings.”
“Yeah, just, uh, tripped. I’m good, Bobby.”
“It’s rained almost every day since he got here,” she admits, glancing at him to see how he’ll react. Dean nods encouragingly. “No one wants to say anything, but I’m not the only person who’s noticed and well, I think we’re all a little afraid to find out what it means.”
“He’s safe with me,” Castiel answers. He looks up at Sam, pinning him into place with a look. “Lilith is attempting to break another seal. Be ready.”
“I knew you’d come.”
“Think I might need to owe you a couple more with those abysmal oral skills, Cas,” Dean says amiably while he watches Cas dress. He's still dripping water into the shitty motel carpet, but he doesn't seem to care if his clothes get damp, he just pulls them on. Maybe he can use his mojo on that too. “Never left a customer or a partner unsatisfied and neither should you.”
“If you or Sam need me for anything—” he starts.
Righteous fury. Like something out of a Renaissance painting. Except for all the denim.
Yeah, right. It’s so painfully normal that Sam can’t muster up the energy to be pissed off. Dean’s been acting off since the heart attack and only gotten more worked up since all this stuff with Elijah started. Especially after he went to the house and talked to him. Sam flips through the book, looking at various pages and trying to decide which ones to prioritize when he gets to Lincoln. Dean reaches out to tap one of the sigils drawn on the side of the page he’s currently on.
“Why?” he asks. The anger’s still there, but he tamps it down and focuses on Elijah offering a piece of the bigger picture. He won’t leave the damn job undone.
“Ask around,” Dean says defensively. “Someone’s gotta know something useful. Maybe that Layla chick?”
“God rewards the good, and He punishes the corrupt,” Le Grange continues, and the tent fills with exalted cheers and prayers. The self-satisfied smile on Le Grange’s face curls up a little more and he gestures back with one hand toward the healer. “And it is the Lord who sent Elijah to us. To work through him so that He may see into the hearts of the people and heal them.”
So he goes with Sam, waiting the extra time it takes for the cops to clear the area around the house, and they go through the same window Sam used to break in on their last visit.
“Bobby, how many times do I have to prove I’m me? I’m fine.”
There’s a reflection in the passenger side window over his shoulder.
“All right, so how do we figure out Rumpelstiltskin’s name?” Dean asks, which is how they wind up sitting across from one another in the middle of the floor, a chalk pentagram drawn around them, Sam’s right hand cradling the side of Dean’s face.
“I would heal you if I could,” Elijah promises quietly.
Dean sniffs and leans towards Sam to whisper, “More like their wallets.”
“Shield of God,” Cas translates, tipping the medallion so Dean can see his, apparently old, name more fully. “Now I’m the shield of nothing.”
Sam squeezes past him, shoving him aside more carefully than he would normally, and hopes Dean won’t notice. “Yeah, sure. Tell that to my bladder.”
Cas glances down at Dean’s hands wrapped around his, and Dean tightens his grip, waiting for a reaction. The angel could break all his fingers and throw him across the room if he wanted. He probably should. Instead, he awkwardly rolls his shoulders and admits, “I’ve never done this.”
Dean chokes on a wet laugh. He knows that one now. Only took a couple Hebrew to English dictionary searches and one put-upon rabbi to do it.
“If you two are done with your little heart to heart, I could use some help in here,” Bobby calls from the library. Sam looks back at him and watches him drop a stack of books onto the desk. Dean puts the undrunk beer into the sink and pushes away from the counter. He knocks the back of his knuckles into Sam’s shoulder as he passes and Sam files away the tiny gesture somewhere safe. Time for research. He’s halfway across the kitchen when Dean stumbles, hands flying up to clutch at his head.
“If—If God really exists than what the hell does he want with me?” The words burst out of Dean with a toss of his head and wide sweep of one hand through the air. “Why do I deserve to get saved over everybody else down there?”
“You think Sam made a deal.”
Sam passes over the orange juice and tosses a sandwich into his lap without comment.
She goes back to a section of text near the beginning and points with a pale green fingernail to part of it.
Sam nods.
It’s still raining when Dean pulls up to the Le Granges' farmhouse; a steady deluge of water that plasters his hair to his skull in the time it takes to walk from the car to the front steps. The crowd of vehicles in the yard has thinned since yesterday, but the RVs are still sitting where they were, and he spots at least one person sleeping in their car when he passes by. All these people have probably been here for weeks, maybe months even, hoping they’ll get lucky, and Dean strolled in and scored without even trying.
“That turned out great,” she scoffs, rolling her eyes and starting toward him. “Do it, Sam. Shoot me.”
“Dean… Castiel? Is he?” Sam chokes on the question.
“The circumstances of our first meeting were unfortunate,” Castiel says. Sam flinches slightly at the rough gravel quality of his voice. Like Dean when he’s trying harder than usual to sound like Dad, but utterly alien with the way it reverberates in the air. Castiel reaches out and takes Sam’s hand in both of his, pressing it between his palms gently. “Excellent job with the witnesses.”
“Can I ask you a question, Elijah?” Quick as a blink, the healer focuses all his attention back on Dean. “Why me? Out of everyone in that tent, why save me?”
Sam backs away towards the fireplace, ankle catching on a pile of books deliberately, so he can stumble back and put more space between them. “If we’d known—”
Winged figure. Sam lets out a breathless laugh. Angel. It’s an angel. He has to be right. Flipping a few pages further reveals a collection of folded newspaper clippings. He pulls them out and pockets the book. They’re articles about the victims, from the openly gay teacher, Marshall Hall, who died the same day Dean was healed, to a woman, Patricia Wine, trying to open an abortion clinic in the area before her untimely death by lightning strike a few weeks before they got here. The most recent one is an interview with a guy named David Wright about Le Grange Ministries and his firm belief that they’re swindlers trying to take advantage of the good people of Ford City.
Sam twists a little on the bench to face his brother, pulling his elbow up onto the backrest. If Dean wants to talk then Sam’s more than happy to do it. “It’s kind of amazing. What’s it even like being possessed by an angel?”
“Yeah, sure. Try to get the six in the corner pocket,” Dean says, gesturing to the far left corner from where they’re standing. Castiel slip instinctively to the forefront and the room settles into something a little more physical as he shifts his awareness fully into this dimension, his grace reflecting off the bottle still in his hand when it flashes behind Dean’s eyes.
“Dean,” Sam presses, hoisting the duffel bag up onto his shoulder. “Are you okay?”
“You okay?” he asks tentatively. The sink turns on in response, but it doesn’t do much to cover the sound of Dean gasping for air between coughs. Sam rolls his eyes and gets out of bed so he can get dressed.
That’s the part Sam was puzzling over before he spent some time in the university’s library.
Bobby doesn’t confirm anything, but there’s a guilty distant look in his eyes.
“I’m surprised you’re still in town,” she says after they exchange a couple pleasantries. “What were you thinking, attacking Sue Ann like that?”
Elijah flinches back at his tone. “Aren’t you?” He starts, and the social incompetence sloughs off. He lifts his chin and meets Dean’s glare straight on. There’s something calculating and seething behind the steady calm of his eyes. “Knowing good and evil and having the freedom to choose between them are vastly different things. You may be tzadik, but that doesn’t absolve you of your actions.”
“You’re the one looking for miracles, Sam. I just happened to find one. Was gonna send a hunter up there to see what was going on, eventually. Make sure the guy was Kosher, so to speak, but haven’t had the time. Hell, even Singer’s not having much luck getting folks to do milk runs these days. Had two exorcisms last month alone. Figure you and Dean can kill two birds with one stone if this guy’s legit, and if he’s full of shit, well…” Joshua leaves the sentence unfinished.
, Castiel answers when the weak and tortured soul pulses with question after question. It flickers in Castiel’s grip.
trust, Castiel? Your faith?”
“And it’s—he’s possessing you?” he asks, wanting to make sure he understands.
“Eyes burned out?”
She kicks him in the stomach and reaches down to rip into him with her hands. In the light from the window, Sam sees the mark, same as Henriksen’s, and he swings the poker out of the rack and through her body. The rest of the tools tip over with a crash, and Meg’s ghostly form disappears in a wisp of smoke. He stays on the floor until he catches his breath.
“Because Elijah all but told me there was.”
“What the fuck?” he hisses.
“What’s this for?” Cas asks.
A blast of humid rain is his answer. He forces his eyes back open and starts running. There’s a furious crack of sound, and Elijah snaps into view in the empty air just as Sam reaches Wright’s side. There’s nothing of the plain unassuming man Sam remembers from the day before. Elijah is a pillar of light and Heavenly wrath pouring itself down on to this muddy patch of land in Nebraska.
, then it may make him unwilling to cooperate later. Especially with the Host’s concerns over his brother’s connection with Azazel and his extracurricular activities. We still don’t know what Azazel's endgame is, Zachariah.”
Sam’s surprised Dean even remembers to introduce him to Layla Rourke before her mother comes up along and leads her away into the tent.
“This is Sam,” he says between one deep breath and the next, when the quick movement catches up to him and makes his head spin.
Dean clutches at him harder. “She’s done.”
Actually, that had been a pretty good day. He likes his spine.
He jumps, jerking back guiltily and twisting to look down the steps towards Layla as she climbs up to them.
“I’m still me, damn it!” Dean yells. Bobby debates putting himself between Dean and the windows or Dean and Sam. Before he can decide, Sam breaks out of his grip and launches himself at Dean, grabbing the collar of Dean's shirt and hauling him up. Bobby braces for the impending brawl and takes a step toward them. The TV on the dresser snaps on and fills the room with a blast of static, and something shoves him away from Dean. It's like being struck by a car. Bobby hits the dresser and rolls onto his side as the mirror on the ceiling and windows crack and shatter. He lifts his arms up to protect his head and neck from the falling glass.
“What did you do to Sam and Bobby?”
“The hell?” he rasps, grinding his teeth from the pain and sucking in air until it passes. When the world settles back into whatever is passing as the new normal, Dean spots the newspaper and grabs it to stare at the date. That’s something he can wrap his head around, right? Dates and times and the steady tick of a clock and not a ring of bomb blasted trees and a voice whispering science class vocab into his ear.
“And Roy's flock just swelled overnight,” Sue Ann breaks in excitedly, picking up her own glass and taking a deep sip. “This is only the beginning.”
“Easy. We’ve actually seen them.”
“Maybe yeah,” Sam says with a shrug. His throat clicks, shoes scuffing the tiles next to Dean’s leg as Dean settles back under the sink with the wrench. “Listen, Dean…”
But on the other hand, who could help them better against a demon than an angel?
“You okay?” he ask. Sam reaches up gingerly to check his face and tears up, blinking rapidly against the sting of blood running into his eyes.
Bobby raps on the door a second later.
Professor Rebecca Callaghan of Lincoln University had been extremely happy to help Sam out when he’d approached her after her class on Christian history had ended. She’s been poring over the book for an hour in silence while Sam stews from a chair in her office.
“If angels existed, Dad would have told us.”
“Angels,” he clarifies. “Angels perform miracles all the time in scripture. It’s kinda what they’re known for.”
Dean scoffs, aiming his eyes toward the ceiling and away from the deep blue trying to search out something he isn’t at all prepared to give.
Dean’s holding as still as he can in the silence, still pissed about Sam’s teasing, but trembling with bored energy. Sam concentrates on the spot where Elijah laid his hand and only feels the scratchy stubble Dean’s too lazy to take a razor to. He exhales with frustration when nothing happens.
When it’s light enough outside, Dean goes out and starts sweeping the glass out of the Impala. He shoves an AC/DC tape into the deck and cranks the volume all the way up, pulls on gloves to keep glass from his fingers, and gets lost in the utterly mundane task of car repair. There’s still a scattering of shards glittering on the vinyl when he’s done and he gets Bobby’s shop vac and an extension cord. Castiel slips into his awareness, brimming with idle curiosity that Dean figures is more about this being the only thing he’s got to look at from behind Dean’s eyes than any real interest in detailing. Not that it stops him from opening his mouth and explaining what he’s doing. Even if Castiel isn’t another person standing around watching him work, Dean still feels the instinctive need to fill the silence between them. The angel nudges the occasional question at him while Dean sorts through the shit that’s collected in the glove box, wondering about the importance of every item Dean puts back versus the pile of old receipts and wrappers that wind up in the trash.
Cas’ expression hardens on the last part.
“A faith healer?”
“He’s not possessing me,” Dean protests again, and Sam nearly bitches him out for it because semantics about Dean’s level of awareness or whatever don’t really mean much when he’s still got some sort of entity riding shotgun in his body.
The burnt pattern of Nanael’s wings stains the pavement under Arariel’s knees.
Bobby nods, conceding the point, but Sam can see him chewing his words. Probably a little more carefully than Sam has so far.
He brings it to his mouth—and it is his mouth, for the moment—and enjoys the awareness of Dean’s body. The steady beat of the heart under his ribs, the smoke filled air that he breathes into his borrowed lungs, and Dean, pure and bright within the safety of Castiel’s grace.
Dean glances at him warily and Sam chews the inside of his cheek, thinking. They haven’t talked about anything that happened with Sue Ann, but Sam’s been wondering about what he knows of Dean's relationship history—especially now that he's met Cassie—and trying to find a way to tell Dean they’re gonna be okay without getting called a girl in the process. He hasn’t managed to figure it out, yet.
Dean scoffs, kicking up gravel with the heel of one boot when he shifts to turn the music back on. He checks the window over one last time and settles into the passenger seat when he’s satisfied and let’s a few minutes of music go by before working up the nerve to say, “So, uh, the eating thing.”
“You caught me, doc.”
Sam drops the pamphlet into his lap.
“Think I broke my nose.”
For now, though, he’s stuck here, walking the three miles from the hotel to the little ten block area that makes up what this place probably calls a downtown. Layla’s standing under an umbrella outside the pharmacy on Main Street, exactly where she said she’d be. He walks a little faster and ducks down under the wide curve of plastic when she tips it up to accommodate him.
“I’m alive, ain’t I?” Dean's voice is raspy with sleep and lack of oxygen. He reaches out for the cup in Sam’s hand. “Gimme.”
Dean drives them back to Bobby’s while Sam looks at his phone and pretends there’s something interesting on the screen. It’s mostly old emails from his college friends, who he stopped replying to in May, and a couple messages from Jo that have already been answered. There’s a missed call from Ruby. He's still looking at it when Dean suddenly mentions her. Sam snaps his phone shut guiltily. The lie comes naturally, but it eats at him when the conversation falters again. He rests his head on the back of the seat and stares out the window at the trees.
this? What did he
“It was,” Cas agrees. He glances over at Dean, and Sam watches his expression relax even further before he snaps his gaze toward the door. Sam realizes Cas was waiting for him to get back before leaving. It’s a humbling feeling. “There’s several things I still need to do. I already told Dean, but I wanted to—”
A key turns in the lock and Dean shoves his way through it, Sam hot at his heels. Well, shit.
“Why are you so dead set on believing there’s something wrong here?”
“Hey, you’re one to talk,” Balthazar breaks in, forced cheer in his voice. He slides the last of the blades from their dead siblings up his sleeve. “I thought we were told to save the Righteous Man, not put him on.”
“Are you into it?”
“Good talk,” he sighs.
“Solid iron,” Bobby grunts, hauling the heavy door shut and locking it from the inside. “Completely coated in salt. Hundred percent ghost proof.”
Uriel subsides, but the glitter of anger and blasphemy in his mouth sticks, held back only by his deference to Castiel’s rank.
.” She rolls her eyes. “King Solomon had a signet ring with a six-pointed star on it, but stories do as they do, and things take a turn for the magical. Multiple pentacles written into a text called the Key of Solomon. All with different uses. Typical Renaissance Era magic, if you ask me, which you did.”
Castiel’s been hard to read so far, but he’s in Dean’s body, so his reactions must be getting filtered through Dean’s long learned habits and body language. Sam’s seen the way Dean’s picked up the strange stillness from the angel already. So when Castiel draws back and looks away, Sam spots the look of someone caught.
“Nah, I got it. You can study more or whatever.”
“Just get on with it, psychic wonder. Your hands are cold.”
“In more ways than you meant to, I’m sure." Cas' cool indifference cracks into a brittle smile as he pulls Sue Ann’s necklace from the pocket of his oversized hoodie. The silver circle hanging from the chain catches the light as Cas flips it over in his palm and brushes his thumb across the Hebrew letters spelling out his name. “Mixing magics can have unforeseen consequences. Her work was desperate and sloppy, based off the already sloppy work before her. That priest never should have stolen what he did. She didn’t just bind my name, she stripped it from me.”
“You had a kidney stone,” Cas mumbles into his collarbone. Dean muffles a curse into his hair and starts pulling at his belt. He’s not sure if he’s exasperated or some other muddle of emotions.
The doctor nods, rambling a little when she explains. “Young guy around your age. Athletic. Paper reported it as a heart attack, but…” She hesitates, and Dean forces a guilty smile, ducking his chin down bashfully.
“Gross.”
Elijah’s eyes flick back up to his face. “You’re following me,” he states, simple as you please, like Dean didn’t just nearly shoot him in a bookstore. Dean doesn’t have an explanation, and he sure doesn’t feel like giving one either, so he shrugs, daring Elijah to complain about it by lifting his chin and staring him down. Instead of backing up or looking away, Elijah just keeps puzzling over Dean, a problem he can’t solve. “I think this is where I should say something about getting ideas, yes?”
Dean gapes at him. Elijah raises his eyebrows and waits patiently for a reaction, looking pleased and just a little smug at being able to throw Dean’s earlier words back at him. It occurs to him that Elijah does know what’s being implied and by whom, which makes it nearly impossible to resist coming back with, “Only if you’ve got the budget for them.”
Dean drops his eyes to the open collar of his shirt and takes another breath, the air in the room suddenly too thick to breathe.
“Pretty sure he didn’t touch me there," he manages, keeping his voice as light as he can. Pamela grins at him as he bares his arm, and the hand print, to the room instead. He has to force himself not to pull away from her hand when she touches it. Not only does it still aches, but it makes Dean feel like the thing burrowed into him and left a brand. Marking him like prized cattle. Her hand feels like a violation. Touching something deeper than his skin. He almost tells her to go back to trying to touch his dick.
That’s easy. Dean kicks off from the clinic bed and shrugs back into his jacket before declaring, “I’m going to check out the healer. You look into the dead guy.”
“You should have brought him to me, Zachariah.”
Castiel stays crouched over the prone body. This is not how... he—yes, that will do,
“So, the guy you think might be killing people told you… what? What’d he tell you?”
“Uh.” Dean tears his eyes away from Elijah and to the reverend. “Just… trying to get a sense of what happened.”
“This does not have to be a transaction, Dean, but if you need it to be.” Dean blinks hard, his vision blurring unexpectedly as pressure between his eyes makes him twist his face up to hold it in. The last person to use the room must have had a cat with them, he’s sure of it, and it’s only now that his body started to react. He slaps Cas’ hands away and pins them to the mattress.
“Our orders are not at fault here, Uriel,” he insists, the words automatic. He wants to mean them. “This is my mistake.”
“Well, there’s me, but there’s also… Dean.”
Six of Castiel’s siblings are dead, the second seal broken, and he doesn’t know how Lilith or her demons have managed it. The reconnaissance performed before the battle, his orders, his own battle strategy. He examines all of them over again, searching for the flaw, and finding nothing. This should have worked. They should have won. Yet, here he stands, in the middle of a street in San Antonio, in front of the building where Lilith raised the Witnesses, and watching it burn to the ground.
“So, we just gonna sit and ignore each other the whole ride?” Dean demands.
Beginning of what? Dean doesn’t dare ask, but the question hangs there in his silence while he absorbs Roy’s story. What it might mean for his and Sam’s investigation. Was the reservoir important or just somewhere Sue Ann happened to be at the time? The plans for their little tent church don't have anything to do with Dean’s job. Let that pamphlet guy handle stopping the human monsters.
Who the fuck is this guy? Dean’s picked up a smattering of Hebrew and Yiddish over the years, but the word Elijah just called him isn’t part of his limited vocabulary. There’s a weight behind it. Like it means something. Like
He tucks the pencil between the pages and closes the book, deciding he’s done reading for the day.
“That’s not funny, Sam,” he snaps, and all the emotion he’s struggling to contain for the last few hours let loose. It’s so much easier than letting himself feel the fear. He pushes at Sam with his words, and shouts and eventually, Dean gives in and grabs him, shaking Sam in his anger until finally,
“We survive our friends out there.” Bobby motions Sam over to the table so they can put together a plan. Somehow, there's a spell to put the witnesses back down. It's simple, aside from the fact that they need the fireplace in the library, and half their ingredients are upstairs.
Sam wobbles his head back and forth, scrunching his face up trying to find an answer that won’t make Dean’s hackles raise further. “I mean… you kind of said he was talking to you, so, uh.” He knows it’s the wrong thing to say because Dean twists away from him, all teeth and angry shoulders, and stalks into the bathroom, slamming the door shut behind him.
“Something like that. You’re not supposed to question God,” she insists. Dean doesn’t argue, not wanting to alienate her any more than he already has at this point, but he knows down to the marrow in his bones that if there’s a God then questioning the bastard’s half the point. “Elijah’s wanted to heal me for months, but God hasn’t—it’s not the right time. My mother talks so much about how I deserve to be healed, but I’m starting to think it’s only putting off the inevitable.”
Sam shakes his head, smiling a little. “Bet he can’t really stretch his wings in a car, Dean,” he says thoughtfully. “Do you think he could have flown us here?”
“Jesus,” Bobby mutters.
Sam doesn’t remark on the nickname—it probably doesn't mean anything anyway—but he tucks the information away for later, and heads towards the house. The protester is still outside, holding a stack of pamphlets and looking sullen. Sam walks past him and up the steps as quickly as possible and starts checking windows. One of them is bound to be unlocked, and sure enough, the fourth window he tries opens with a smooth slide.
“S-sssttop.” Dean slurs as he’s dragged back, awareness creeping back. He wrenches away from Pamela’s hand, out of Sam's grip, and stands. The chair clatters across the floor behind him. Bobby and Sam are looking at him and there's fear in their eyes. Dean wonders what he said—what
“I surprised you?” Sam echoes.
Castiel is quiet for a very long time, thinking. He feels Dean’s soul nudging at the corona of his being and reluctantly pulls the tendrils of his grace from Dean’s limbs, surrendering control. He slips back into the recesses of Dean's mind.
Her mother barrels up the steps toward Elijah, crowding close to Layla’s side in the process, desperation trembling through her body. “This is the sixth time. Elijah, please.”
Like him. She doesn’t even know him. It’s aggravating on every level even while Dean’s agreeing with her. Especially because he is.
Sam's woken up by the sound of Dean coughing in the bathroom. The window he’s facing is fogged up from the rain drizzling down outside. Sam shoves himself up and wipes his mouth, listening to Dean through the door.
“We? Do you mean Dean?” Castiel nods. “Is he okay?”
"That was before you lit up a couple of demons with your hands!"
“Yeah.” The whole story spills out before he can stop himself. The bright light living under Dean’s skin, reaching out to burn demons from their bodies without any consideration for the humans it leaves behind. The fact that his brother’s been dragged off to God knows where. Sam’s happiness at his brother being alive is incandescent, but he’s afraid. He wants to beret himself for trusting Ruby with this, but he can’t put it into words with Bobby and he needs to talk to someone. He and Ruby have their secrets already. What’s one more?
months since the last time he ate anything.
Dean retreats into the bathroom and pulls a towel down to scrub through his hair. “So, they’re happening closer together?”
Cas pulls his hoodie back on and the illusion of humanity completes itself a little, except for the intensity in his eyes when he looks at Dean. Nothing human about that level of focus being directed at him. That’s gonna take some getting used to.
“All right, we’ve got a name,” Bobby says, and he and Sam exchange a look, having a conversation around him. Dean tilts his head and watches their body language. Tries to see if there's an attack coming. “Let’s head back to Pontiac.”
“Think you might have turned me around on the subject,” Dean says, trying for sincere and falling flat when she laughs at him.
It’s only the firm hands on his face that keep him from leaping up.
“Like hell,” he snaps and he shoves a hand into the wing directly in front of him to move it. The thing snaps back with a slither of alarm from Castiel before he can touch it and then fades away when he unlocks the door and opens it to find a stranger standing in the middle of the room. The angel gazes at Dean and his lips curl up in barely contained disgust as he looks Dean up and down. Like he’s something he found on the bottom of his shoe. It’s not an expression Dean sees directed his way often, but it makes his anger just a little sharper.
“You’re teaching him car stuff now?” Sam asks, after Dean leans over to twist the volume down. There’s a tense draw to his shoulders and his jaw is clenched. Dean opens his mouth to make a crack about Sam getting jealous, but the narrow look Sam gives him stops him. So much for working Sam’s shit out.
Castiel answers without hesitation.
,” Elijah answers flatly. “You have to understand. If I do, it’ll—” He clenches his jaw and jerks his head away from Dean.
“What am I supposed to say, Bobby?” he hisses. “You didn’t see him in the diner, okay. He was glowing like a Christmas tree—the way he took out those demons was…”
He and Sam stop for food at a diner in Pontiac on the way back to the hotel.
“That’s it, sweetheart. You look so good. Come on. You want my mouth or you wanna come like this?” Dean murmurs, the words bubbling up instinctively while Cas keeps tugging at his clothes. He manages to wrestle Dean out of his layers and down to his jeans and undershirt. Dean expects Cas to let him get back to the business of getting him off, but Cas lifts Dean’s free arm and kisses his knuckles. The bones shift effortlessly back into place without pain, and Dean sucks in a breath. There’s no ache in the joints when he clenches his hand into a fist until the skin turns white.
A flicker of recognition and fear twists the pale face above him, and Dean reaches up to grab at the sleeve of his suit jacket and pulls. Something skitters across the floor and hits him in the hip. He thinks Sam is yelling his name, but everything has narrowed down to the conflicted figure above him and the necklace now lying on the floor beside him.
“Piss outside, next time!”
“Yes, you do. Tell me your name,” Sam demands. He draws closer, the light burning so bright he can feel it ache behind his eyes, and there’s the sound of wings bursting open in the space above him. The angel makes a shrill rattling sound of pain.
Seeing Cassie again is what he thinks falling in love must feel like: quick, painful, and over way sooner than Dean wants. She’s still as quick witted and gorgeous as Dean remembers, and falling back into her orbit is an old habit he doesn’t want to break. That she helps fill the empty space gnawing at him since Nebraska helps, and neither she nor Sam notice the way he throws himself at her just a little bit harder than necessary. It feels good, being the sort of man he tells himself he wants to be.
Elijah glances at him, face blank, and something flickers and tightens in his expression. The muscle under Sam's hand winds tight, and Sam pulls harder, shoulder straining with the force. For one fraction of an instant, he thinks wildly that he’s succeeded, and whatever’s compelling Elijah forward has lost. The next moment, he crashes to the ground and Wright hits the gravel a few feet away with a scream, Elijah on top of him.
“Whatever, let’s just find him.”
,” Sam corrects. “Are you…?”
It’s gone when he blinks. Dean stares at himself, jaw clenching and grinding painfully, and tries to calm the pounding in his chest.
“You wanna talk about feelings and braid hair, Cas, I’ll put on Lifetime and call Sam to bring some beads and nail polish when he comes back.”
“Enjoy your fucking bible or whatever weird crap you’re buying. I gotta… I gotta go.”
“I’m sure.”
“I’m a demon, Sam! Angels aren’t gonna care if I’m being helpful. Smite first, ask questions later.” It's not a vision, but the clarity of it makes Sam almost think it could be when the image of Dean clasping a hand to Ruby’s face and Castiel incinerating her from the inside out bubbles up from nowhere. He grips Ruby's arm tighter and vows to keep her away from Dean when—not if—he comes back.
Halfway through his shower, he realizes the cut on his arm from Bobby's knife is gone. As if the flesh had knit itself back together when he wasn’t looking. His hands shake and he stumbles out from under the water and trips on the lip of the tub in his rush toward the mirror. He catches himself on the edge of the sink and it cracks under the force of his grip, a piece breaking away and crashing to the floor. He goes down onto his knees with it, his hand bloody from where it scraped against the broken porcelain.
Sam squints suspiciously at him. They’ve been on too many hunts where he’s found a way to wiggle out of research so he can mess around.
“Let me go,” Cas orders.
Elijah shakes his head fiercely, jaw set. He reaches out and grips Dean's left shoulder hard enough he can feel the pressure of his fingertips through the heavy leather of his coat. “I can’t,” he grinds out. “I’m sorry. Keep digging.”
“I said he was a specialist,” Sam says defensively, cutting off Dean’s breathless complaints. “Didn’t say in what. The guy’s supposed to be the real deal.”
“You’re kidding?” he asks, rubbing quickly at the wetness around his eyes that he didn’t manage to blink away. Cas’ gaze drops. “Holy shit. You’re not kidding.”
do that, except Sam’s been hovering over him every time they pull over—because needing to piss every ten minutes is just another problem Dean’s gotta deal with, now. Which leaves Dean with nothing to do but tally up the loose cash he’s been depositing into the Bank of Impala since Dad gave him the keys and got himself a truck. Two thousand from a few nights in Springfield shoved under the loose corner of carpet on the driver's side by the brake. Nine hundred left over from the lesbian couple who had insisted on paying him for saving their daughter's life from a ghoul back in '99 that he hadn't been too prideful to deny after two and a half weeks of eating nothing but peanut butter and half-rotten apples. Five hundred in the barrel of a 12 gauge that got cracked in half by a Chupacabra in New Mexico. Six grand that Dean's been earning for years, mostly on his knees. Sam's deposited his own money despite Dean's protests and hell, there might still be some of the cash Dad left him tucked away where the vinyl cracked on the backseat.
“No.” Dean cuts him off quickly, then tries to smooth it over with a hastily added, “It’s cool. Find yourself or whatever. We’ll keep in touch.”
“Easy, son.” Bobby hauls Sam around to look at him. “What happened?”
“Trying to figure out how hands on I can get until you figure out this timeshare shit. I’m not gonna have you lurking around getting your rocks off watching me in the shower. It’s creepy.”
She smiles, self-assured in her faith. “And to punish the wicked. And you are wicked, Dean. Blasphemy. Theft.”
“Divining a name isn’t something just anyone can do,” she says once he’s finished. “The memory loss isn’t a problem. Your angel’s gonna know its name if you can dig deep enough.”
“Hey, hey, Eli, easy,” Dean reassures, raising his hand.
“No!” Dean answers defensively.
“That’s odd,” he accuses.
“Clean up and then we’ll see if we can track him down,” Bobby instructs and he draws back and puts space between them, sucking air in between his teeth. “I’m gonna… look something up.”
“I know the M.E. and believe me, it was a freak accident. There’ll be a correction in the paper tomorrow about it. Electrical fire. Burned his eyes out and everything.” She grimaces, and Dean nods in understanding, sucking in air between his teeth to feign disgust. “You’re fine.”
Elijah arches one thick eyebrow at him and cants his head to the side. Dean takes another step away from him. Something behind Elijah’s eyes clears, like he’s slotted some piece about Dean into place.
“You’ll have your chance, Naomi. For now, we do this my way. There’s more than one way to temper a sword.”
“Well, we don’t know for sure he’s killing people, but let’s go with that theory for a second.” He debates over search terms before he starts typing. There’s got to be some monsters that have wings and make a habit of setting people on fire. The internet takes its sweet time loading, but the first few results look promising when Sam starts clicking through them. “Hey, what about a phoenix? They're associated with healing, right?”
Castiel presses the soul down into the body and Dean scrambles and fights against it. The force of Castiel’s power flattens the space around them and the flesh of Dean’s arm burns under Castiel’s touch where he grips him. Castiel lifts one wing to protect the still closed eyes from the light.
“You think Sue Ann gave it to him, then?”
“I can sense your appreciation. You don’t need to tell me so vividly,” Cas says, low and easy against the pulse point of Dean’s wrist, clearly thinking it’s okay to talk like that. Dean shudders and sinks into the tingling sensation that sweeps down his spine with warm breath and soft lips following the median vein up his arm.
Wright’s standing between a silver Chevy truck and a red sedan near the fence by the tent, the collar of his coat pulled up to keep the rain away from his neck. Sam can hear Roy through the tent fabric and the congregation's reply to the muffled sermon swells. Static crawls up his spine and down his arms. The sky rips open with a peal of thunder.
“Bobby'll know what to do,” he says into the silent vehicle a few minutes later while he stares at the hazy shadow of limbs and faces and wings in the rear view mirror. They look like they’re sprouting from his own body and a high pitched whining rises up in his ears that he could almost dismiss as tinnitus if the radio didn't start spitting static at him. The windows vibrate with the sound and Dean feels like he’s about to burst apart at the seams. He drums his fingers on the wheel and twitches his shoulders back. “Can we not with the hallucinations right now? I need to drive.”
Dean doesn’t offer a single complaint about Sam getting mud all over the vinyl and floorboards when they get into the car. Sam shoves his coat down by his feet and tries to ignore the mud in his hair as he waits until they’re a few miles down the road.
“What?” He doesn’t want to have this conversation right now and pulls the wrench a little more viciously than necessary, having to jerk back to avoid clocking himself in the face.
Dean drags him into the shower after Cas cleans them up with some clever bit of magic. Because apparently a year on Earth didn’t teach him a damn thing about the joys of a passable water heater.
“The hell kinda name is that?”
“You put me to sleep when you went all hi ho angel-o in my body, right, and last night you fucking disappeared off my radar after… I couldn’t feel you at all. Where the hell were you?”
Castiel levels a steady look at him and answers, “Mine.”
“I thought not telling you would…” he falters, squeezes his eyes shut and breathes. When he opens them again, she’s frowning at him. “I thought it would keep you safe.”
“That’s it?”
“Mind your tone with me,
“The triumph of the wicked is short,” she quotes, reaching up to touch the silver chain hanging around her neck with the tips of her fingers. At least, Dean assumes she’s quoting something. It sure sounds pretentious enough. When she finishes, she looks back up at him. “The Lord led me to this when He sickened my husband. He sent me an angel to command so I could reward the just.”
“Huh?” Dean blinks and the thing—Castiel?—pulls back into some space between his liver and kidneys. The colors of the room fade and there’s silence in his head, his question unanswered. Dean lets Sam move him and they leave.
“Nah. That’s later,” Dean quips back without missing a beat.
Roy nods. “Yep, and that’s exactly what happened. I went into a coma and the doctor was sure I wouldn’t wake up, but Sue Ann kept on praying, and one day she found Elijah out near the reservoir. Hit him with her car and everything. Well, she hustled him off the hospital and that’s where he found me.”
“Yeah, what?” he asks.
“No,” he answers firmly. The heart in his chest races, muscles aching in a way he doesn’t understand. He’s certain Dean must feel it down in the place where Castiel has hidden his conscience away. “Dean asked me to stay with him. If I leave now… when he’s still trying to decide if he trusts me—
“Has it stopped raining at all since we got here?” Sam asks, breaking the silence.
“Found it,” Bobby says finally and he launches off into an explanation that leaves Sam feeling cold. The rising of the witnesses. Signs of the apocalypse. It’s… too much. Sam has to put the shell he was working on down. It tips over, rolling along the wood grain on the table and spilling salt in its wake.
“I don’t really—” Sam sighs, reaching up to rub at the bridge of his nose. Conversations with Dean are like trying to stroll through a minefield sometimes and every one they’ve had in the last several hours makes him feel like he’s talking to a nuclear bomb. “This is a lot. You were dead yesterday, okay. Really dead. And now you’re… not. And it wasn’t even me that did it.”
Sam's almost afraid to ask, but he makes himself do it. “A cage? What’s in the cage?”
“Why, a miracle, Dean,” Sue Ann says cheerfully as she pours a glass and sets it down in front of Dean. She sits down in the chair in front of Elijah. She doesn’t offer anything to him. “Miracles have been coming to us ever since Elijah arrived.”
The inside of the tent gives Dean the heebie-jeebies. Signs with bible quotes hang on the walls. ‘He sent forth His Word and healed them; He rescued them from the Pit’. Dean ignores the rest, focusing instead on the sick and dying people trying to find seats in the rows of metal chairs sunk into the grass in front of a wooden stage. it doesn't take long to spot the camera mounted to a support beam just over Sam’s shoulders. He points it out wordlessly.
Dean looks up quickly at him. “Freeing you?”
Castiel sets the beer down so he can pick up the cue, eyeing the table critically. Dean’s mind buzzes impatiently, thoughts a flickering distraction that makes Castiel want to grasp the threads and lose himself trying to puzzle out the connections from one scattered idea to the next. He leans over the table instead and contemplates the best way to make the shot Dean has given him.
In the mirror, a keloid scar wraps securely around his neck in the shape of a hand.
Well, he
“Jess. Please.”
He climbs through and into the sitting room. There’s not much of a chance he’ll find anything in here, but he gives the room a quick look over, picking up a few interesting looking relics that turn out to be decorative and setting them carefully back into place. Satisfied there’s nothing here, he moves into the hall and checks rooms—kitchen, dining room—until he finds a room that clearly doubles as a study and library.
The ambulance pulls into the driveway slowly, and one of the cops tries his best to look intimidating as he threatens Dean. “We catch you 'round here again and we’ll put the fear of God in you. Understand?”
“More like Joe Black,” Dean mutters and then scowls when Sam stares blankly at him, waiting for more information.
Dean looks steadily at him and straightens his shirt.
“Still don’t think you need that x-ray when your physical exam didn’t suggest any problem with your knees.” She peers at him from over the top edge of her clipboard. “Is this because of that guy in the paper?”
Sam tips his head in concern and waits until she’s walked away before leaning towards him.
Everything stops. Dean puts the car in drive and wipes the fear sweat from his face with the sleeve of his shirt.
He looks at the shelves. There’s an entire section of books that Sam knows are all related to Christian eschatology just from scanning the spines. None of them have been touched in years, judging by the thick dust layered along the front edge—except where a thick volume called ‘A History of Christianity’ is shelved. He pulls it down and flips it open to page after page of Latin. It’s an interesting find for sure, but there’s nothing supernatural about it.
“People see a thing they can’t explain,” Sam argues, catching hold of Dean’s arm when he wobbles unsteadily. It gets Sam an ungrateful elbow to the rib while Dean glances around them nervously. Sam tightens his grip and pulls Dean closer to his side to keep him on his feet, not caring how it looks. “They want to have a little faith in something bigger. Maybe you should, too.”
Impulsively, Dean wants to ask him to come with them. Cas has more than proved capable of handling himself, so there’s no fear he’d be out of his depth. Except he’d probably be an awkward bastard around people. A year in a shitty fundie town ain’t socializing, and their last conversation showed that Cas is about as smooth as the back end of a porcupine.
“Dean—”
“I’m not going to risk you damaging him before we’re ready. We’ve only broken two seals and Michael’s angry enough over Castiel touching his things, without you frying his cortex a few more times. We tread lightly, or this whole apocalypse falls apart.”
“I don’t remember anything before I came here, but Roy can tell you how I healed him and learned about my powers if you want,” he says. Dean nods, following Elijah to the screen door as he pulls it open with a rusty creak. Elijah touches the tips of his right pointer and middle finger to his mouth and presses them lightly to the door jamb before stepping inside. Dean blinks after him, startled, and then follows quickly after. It’s not… not something someone who lives in a house with a cross hanging in the entry hall would know how to do. Is it something left over from whatever he’s not remembering?
Damn it. He’d expected a threat. Maybe an ‘I’ll put the fear of God in you if you don’t respect me’, that kinda crap. Or a stern warning that he’d overstayed his welcome and should get out of town. The kind of thing that lets Dean know he’s on the right track pressing an issue. But this… he’s being asked for help. By the guy they’re fucking investigating.
He straightens up in the seat and fumbles the phone, nearly dropping it in his haste to protest. “Wait what? No, I can’t—I’ve had a couple visions, Missouri. I don’t have any kind of control to read an angel or whatever.”
Elijah goes back to staring at Le Grange. Dean tunes out the sermon and focuses on studying him instead. He only looks at Dean once, when Le Grange takes a moment to actually preach something about love and trust. Dean doesn’t bother keeping the disbelieving sound he makes to himself this time.
“Yeah well, I don’t have to like it.”
“You reading my thoughts?” Dean asks, and the same anger that had him pushing Castiel away when he had tried to soothe away the memory from Hell runs through him again along the corona of his soul. Castiel flicks his wings and pulls them away from where he has them curved against Dean’s shoulders, uncertain. Dean sighs and there’s a tremor of emotion that Castiel can’t untangle. Feelings he doesn't know. “You ever play pool?”
“Uh,” Sam says. Dean hears him swallow down the last of his beer. “One of the windows on the car might be broken.”
“No, but you certainly do to me,” Zachariah says genially from just behind Castiel’s shoulder. All of them go still at his arrival, waiting for orders. It's been centuries since Zachariah took a vessel. “Arariel, Uriel, why don’t you two return to the garrison for now. Balthazar? Take those blades to the arsenal.” The other three angels fly and Castiel draws his wings into a neutral position at his back, folding the pairs into place nervously. Zachariah circles around him, face splitting with a toothy smile that makes Castiel hesitate to offer up the now practiced explanation. “Now, I happen to know that you were testing a vessel in Pontiac before your garrison was assigned to pull—” Zachariah drops his hand onto Castiel’s shoulder with a heavy clap. It resonates through his grace and into his true form. “—Dean here out of Hell.”
“Kill for something with a little less grease next time,” Dean adds on forty minutes later, tossing the empty cup and wrapper into the backseat.
‘Whoa! Hey wait, wait! What?” Sam grabs her by the arm before she can spin away and out of his life.
“Not exactly.”
He’s been dead for four months. Only four months. How? God, he feels stretched and worn thin at the edges thinking about how long it's really been.
“How many exorcisms do you know, Bobby?” Sam asks a few days later. He’s slumped on the couch in the library, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders and a book of angel lore digging into his thigh. So far, he hasn’t found anything they don't already know. Bobby’s put in calls to a few hunters nearby, but no one’s gotten back to them, yet.
“No, you won’t," he says with confidence. Whatever dragged him out of the pit isn’t something she’s going to risk pissing off. She wants answers and if she can't hurt him, she'll probably try torturing Sam instead. If she could get to him. The thing that pulled him out is pressing against the roof of Dean's mouth, coiled up tight in his chest and arms, and ready to strike at the slightest provocation. The knowledge of it sends a thrill of heat up his spine. He doesn't just want to kill her, he wants to make it hurt.
, Sam breaks. Sam didn’t resurrect him.
“A freebie.” Cas tests the word out and reaches up to push Dean’s hands away from his collar so he can cup Dean’s face in his hands. Dean stills, heart thudding heavy in his throat at the intimacy of the action. “Do you want this?”
Dean's thoughts skid to a halt at the conviction in Cas’ voice and he stares back at him, waiting for some explanation that makes more sense.
“Yeah,” he admits grudgingly.
“That’s it?” Dean demands, forcing the hysteria in his voice to sound angrier than he really is. “What the hell did I say in there?”
“Angels don’t exist.”
Sam flinches, twists his face away, and a whisper of sound brushes against the shell of his ear. Claws rip him free from the connection and push him away and he slams into the awareness of his own body. Sweat and blood drips down his face, soaking the collar of his shirt, and his hands are ice cold. He opens his eyes and grins victoriously at the question Dean’s asking with his eyes.
He could have called Sam if Sam hadn’t disconnected his damn number. Dean tries to remember another phone number and calls Bobby instead, memories from before coming back into focus if he focuses on them enough. Unfortunately, Bobby has the good sense not to believe a man that’s been dead for months is calling him on the phone, but he answers, which means he’s still at the salvage yard. There’s a car parked a few yards away from the phone booth and Dean's known how to hot wire a car since he was in middle school.
“Dean. If what you’re saying is right, then… maybe he needs help.”
“I’m sorry,” he says carefully when Dean unlocks the door and strips off his rain-soaked jacket, throwing it over the back of the chair on the other side of the table from where Sam’s sitting. Dean lifts his eyebrows at him. “Elijah’s healed six people in the last year. Two of them in the last month, including you.”
“How the hell do you give back a name?” Dean grouses. “He’s already fucking got it, right?”
Sam lifts his chin and frowns, worry narrowing his mouth and Dean can see the gears turning in his brother’s mind before something clicks into place with a twitch of his nose and eyebrows. “Okay, Dean.” Sam nods and turns back to the house.
“It’s familiar. In a way that most things since coming here haven’t been,” Elijah answers, looking at Dean again, and that scraped out feeling slinks back full force.
He shoves Sam off him with a groan when he tries to help him out of the car.
A gunshot echoes through the air and Sam slumps to the ground with a wheeze of air. Bobby comes running across the lawn toward him and hauls Sam back to his feet.
“Sure is.”
The air in his lungs leaves his body in a rush and blood, thick and salty, fills his mouth. He forces his eyes open and looks up into a nest of wavy dark hair and vivid blue eyes. His breath hitches when he tries to inhale, jaw aching, and realizes there's a hand around his neck, and it's squeezing. Barely contained power pulses against his skin and the blood trickling down his throat start to burn.
And then she’s not quite Jess anymore, energy pouring off her as she reaches out to grab him and rip his heart from his chest. Sam stumbles back a step, face wet as he raises the gun up, closes his eyes, and pulls the trigger.
“Shit,” Dean slurs when Cas cradles the side of his face. “You really like doing that, don’t you?”
Cas’ expression shutters when he looks up at Dean’s face.
“Yeah, okay, then get back here. We’ve got until tomorrow to figure this out.”
He closes the distance between them in a few steps, his heart rate spiking and making his chest hurt hard enough that he questions if Elijah healed him right. Elijah tips his head up to keep their gazes locked.
Dean’s irritation over the comment unfolds when he spots the source. She steps politely around Sam and into their path, pulling them both up short. She’s attractive. White-skinned and smiling with forced politeness while Dean leers. Sam rolls his eyes and lets Dean push away to have his moment. It’s the least he can do.
Cas is perched on the edge of the bed like he belongs there, and it’s enough to make Dean grind his teeth together. He drinks in the sight of the angel helplessly. Somewhere in the weeks since Nebraska, he’s lost the black suit in favor of a pair of dark jeans and a faded white button down layered over a plain black t-shirt. The dark red hoodie almost pulls the whole thing together, except the strings for it are hanging at completely different lengths down his chest. Dean flexes his fingers around the hilt of his gun and glares at him from down the barrel.
“So did Meg and Henriksen, uh,” Sam squints, trying to remember the design. He reaches out a hand as Bobby digs around for paper and pencil, sliding them over silently. Sam leans over the desk and sketches out a rough design. “It was like a brand.”
Tucked away in the space where it was, however, is another, smaller book with no discernible title. Sam reaches for it and tucks the encyclopedia back into place. The leather bound text is a lot older than everything else in here. In fact, it might be older than most of the reference books he and Dean use. There are whole pages in languages Sam recognizes but doesn’t know, including a page with a drawing of a winged figure kneeling at someone’s feet.
“Right. Sure, okay, so Dean asked you to stay and you just decide possessing him was the way to do it? You couldn’t have gone for your other vessel and come back, maybe? It would have been really nice if Dean had been here while hunters were being torn apart the last couple of days, Castiel.”
Elijah remains beside him, blue eyes fixed in the direction Dean went. There’s a coiled energy under the skin containing him, and Sam doesn't look away from him even as voices, one of them Dean’s, start rising. He can’t make out what’s being said, but Sue Ann makes a shrill shout for help, and Elijah strikes. A warm palm presses to his forehead.
Dean realizes he might be making a bigger deal of this than is strictly necessary. It’s a damn small price to pay to carry a figurative nuclear arsenal against demons around with him. He can deal with this.
“Oh!” Sam laughs a little helplessly. “You’re welcome, Cas.”
“Fucking show off.”
“Look, Layla, if anyone deserves it, it’s you,” Dean says, believing it as much as he does anything.
“Call me, huh?” he asks with a grin that he knows is full of shit. Dean barks at him to finish cleaning the guns if he wants to be a little bitch. Sam yells good-naturedly after him when he slams the bathroom door behind him. “Screw you too, jerk!”
“We are not like demons.”
“Save the history lesson, Sam,” Dean cuts in.
Too late to chicken out now. He pushes open the door and blinks uncomfortably at the shelf of VeggieTales DVDs that greets him. Yeah, okay, he should have expected that one. He kicks water off his boots and into the floor mat, scanning the store for his quarry. There’s a middle-aged woman reading a book while leaning over the counter by the register, ignoring the two customers that just walked into the building. Only, Dean can’t seem to find the other one from where he’s standing.
It’s simple once he figures out the balance and weight of the stick. He bounces the six ball off the edge of the table and sinks it into the corner pocket with one smooth motion. Dean colors in surprise.
“Yeah, Dean, that’s it,” he insists. “I’ve been seeing a lot of awful stuff lately, okay. I’d have told you if I saw something, I swear.”
Sam bolts up the stairs without looking back, gun firmly in hand. He starts pulling open doors. The half finished guest room he and Dean used to share before it got filled with stuff, the locked door they dare not open, and—he jerks one of the doors halfway down on the left open and sees neatly folded towels and sheets—the linen closet.
Bobby shrugs. “I had a weekend off.”
“Our cash reserves are running low,” Sam says as he slides back into the passenger seat and points Dean toward their room so Dean can park. “We passed a pool hall a few blocks back that’s probably still open.”
Instead of answering right away, Dean goes and retrieves his jacket. He slips it on, then dumps the hotel room keys on the bedside table. He pauses. “We’re not telling Dad.”
“Very few psychics can speak to me in my true form.”
“Oh?” Sam doesn’t bother to pretend he isn’t enjoying every second of Dean’s obvious discomfort. “How gay was it when the guy who isn’t your brother did this while you were on your knees?”
The book tumbles to the floor as Sam throws himself bodily up onto his feet, closing the space between them in two steps. Dean looks up at him just as Sam reaches him and his eyes widen in alarm when Sam throws his arms around him. Tension coils in Dean’s back and shoulders and he sways backwards, away from Sam, only to jerk to a stop and go so still that Sam almost believes he’s holding a statue. Not Dean.
“Who hasn’t, Sam?” There’s an edge of hysteria in her voice, eyes blow wide with barely concealed panic. “Is it?”
She doesn’t touch his neck, either, after his expression shutters when she asks about it. Dean’s more grateful than he wants to be. Whatever emotions are wrapped up into that, he’s not going to deal with, yet.
“They’re all people we know,” he says, rubbing his side and hoping it’s only bruised. At least he’s not laid out on the floor with his chest ripped open. “Meg, Henriksen… those kids.”
“Oh, is that the problem?” Sam asks, widening his eyes and lifting his eyebrows in a guileless expression. Dean scowls. “Want me to warm them up for you?”
“Uh…” he starts eloquently, then Castiel is unfolding and walking over to him with intent. Sam freezes. The angel. The one he talked to in his head. He musters up words. “Hey, it’s you! Castiel. You came back.”
“This is how I held you when I healed your heart,” Cas answers, voice a deep purr. Dean thinks of long drives in the Impala with the windows down, the vibration of the engine in his bones and the open road to anywhere at his fingertips. “I can’t see most human souls when I’m envesseled, but you shone so brightly, Tzadik.”
Castiel tilts their head and closes their eyes. They snap back open under Dean’s command and Castiel frowns. Emotions prickle at the edges of his grace from Dean’s soul.
“They’re locks to a cage.”
“No kidding.”
He loses track of what he’s supposed to be doing for Cas in the wake of the angel’s studious exploration, mind gone hazy and distracted. Cas finishes with a wet kiss to his collarbone that leaves Dean shivering when the old break corrects itself, and then Cas unwraps Dean’s fingers from around his dick and does the whole thing over with the right arm.
“There are more battles than this one. More seals. As a hunter, you should understand that there’s a much bigger picture here. I did what I thought necessary.” Castiel stalks over to him. “Show me the respect I deserve, Sam. I'm not your enemy.”
“I’ve never been here before,” Castiel settles on saying, a little more quickly than he wants, but Will is looking at him expectantly, waiting for him to speak. He feels caught out, awkward in a way that goes behind physical. Instead of examining that, he walks around the table, Dean’s thoughts—three into the middle pocket—an easy guide, the rules of the game falling into place with each shot.
“You don’t believe there’s any good to balance out all the evil out there?”
catches on that he’s stepped in it. Elijah doesn’t catch on though. He just keeps staring intensely at him, like he doesn’t understand why Dean’s angry.
