The two retreated back upstairs to change and Aria shot Pepper an awkward sideways look. "I think he's giving Sam Wilson his shield. He's been talking about it. I don't think he thinks he deserves it anymore, or whatever. Besides, he can't even use it now anyway I guess..."
"Yeah.  It is. He paid five hundred thousand dollars just for you to walk out here tonight with me," said Rhodey, hoping guilt would do the trick.
He sent Phil the name, asking if he could look her up. He got a reply ten minutes later, after he'd had a shower.
"Got it," Steve hummed, still determined to function.  They'd been gone about twelve hours, that was all, but it felt like longer. He was relieved as soon as they stepped inside the house. Steve instantly felt safer. "Don't be too long," he told him and kissed Tony's (well, the suit's) forehead before he pulled away into the kitchen, where he could hear Gleason and Pepper talking.
"Oh, sure, after twenty-nine years," said Boswell with a wave of his hand.  "We learned to love each other. But the first few years were the hardest." He took a thoughtful sip of his drink.  "Times change. Just look at what your Steve is doing, now. And Tom's been pretty involved in Status Alliance ever since Ryan moved out-- that's my son--" he added, for Tony's benefit.  Tony understood immediately that Ryan wasn't Banksy's, that Banksy was a stepmother. He tried to grasp the concept of Banksy helping to raise a kid who was probably close to his own age.  "--which makes him happy, I guess, and I said, well, Tommy, if it makes you happy, go for it," Boswell continued. He nodded, then added with a small smile, "No doubt Tommy's recruiting Steve now."
an omega are very different things.  What you see here is an omega that was given rewards out of pity but never required to earn them.  Rewards and punishments should both always be
Then the baby started crying and Aria stood, rocking the baby gently in her arms as she cooed at it. Aria certainly didn't go all gooey-eyed at the babies like Pepper and Ty but she knew what she was doing with them.
Now super models… they were a whole new problem. They were honestly a little intimidating and way too handsy. Steve felt bad for keeping making excuses to get away from them.
"How come you nearly die every week?!"
"I'm going to die.  I'm in hell," repeated Tony, dazed
"I don't hate him," said the omega.  "Just Stark. Stark is a murderer. The Captain..."  He shrugged a little, then scowled. "He's only an ignorant American.  He's as brainwashed as you are. But he is right about one thing. Us rabbits... we should be treated better."
What was Tony so afraid of?
Steve took a deep breath, reminding himself that he was here to make big changes, not small ones, and getting kicked out wasn't something he wanted.  At least not before he got to talk to the omegas who were being auctioned.
He reached for Tony's hand and pulled him down to peck him on the lips. Tony's intelligence would never cease to be attractive.  Overwhelming, but attractive.
, because it's still your fault for being bonded to another Alpha in the first place."
Steve hit the ball way too hard and it pinged up, hitting a glass on a table nearby and smashing it.
care,
"Fuck," hissed Tony.  "Fuck... fuck... fuck..."  He'd never before felt so helpless in one of his suits.  He looked up.  His enemy was all smiles.
Steve knew he had time to get about five hours sleep. So he did. He would need it and then, he would be ready for them. Steve had been ready for this for a long time and now he had nothing else to lose, did he? Tony didn't want him. If he died, oh well. Who would care? America would, but fuck America. That country hadn't done shit for him as an omega.
Eric looked uncomfortable whenever Steve asked him questions. "Stuff like how to discipline your omega when he acts out."
of sex in the next few days. they just didn't like to think about it. Like you don't wanna think about your significant other taking a shit."
"...about what?" demanded Tony.
Tony took his card, leaving an ample tip, and walked with Steve outside.  It was even colder. Tony hunched his shoulders and shoved his free hand into his pocket, still holding Steve's in the other.
An ugly lie.  Tony knew they both owed Fury, big time.  They had their freedom, sort of. Tony had his suits.  Steve had Project 84. And Tony suspected that Fury was probably the mastermind behind keeping Bucky somewhere safe.
DeSoto looked delighted at this tiny semblance of praise.
"Hey, is it true you're going to be on Saturday Night Live?" Marcus asked.
Charlotte grabbed a pool stick and began chalking it up with practiced ease.  Clearly, Tony had misjudged her. Despite being tipsy, she looked ready to kick some ass.  Alphas had a natural tendency to get competitive, which is one reason "Alpha v. omega" was considered a good idea; if all the Alphas were on one team, they were far less likely to get worked up at each other.
"Absolutely not," said Tony immediately, putting his hands in his lap like the man might try to grab one of them.
The moment Tony and Steve walked into the lobby, the concierge approached them.  "Captain Rogers, there's been a series of phone calls for you... it seems very urgent... the line is on hold for you in your room."
A pause.
"Oh my gosh, don't
Unlike Steve, Clint's inducer experiences lasted days, and Steve didn't know how in hell he'd dealt with that. But when Clint found out his only lasted a few hours he whistled low:
"Look, I have a few buddies here at the port.  We could go now and just meet him there," suggested Charlie.  "I doubt
Tony had automatically taken his half of the bed, leaving the other half open for Steve if he wanted it.  But maybe Steve wanted to sleep on the couch. Maybe he didn't want to sleep with Tony anymore, because Tony wasn't as good an Alpha as Bucky and couldn't even mate him properly.  Tony didn't know and so he didn't want to push Steve. He didn't pat the bed invitingly or make any motion for Steve to join him, not wanting to be pushy. Every time he asked anything of Steve, it backfired.  Steve was clearly going to do whatever Steve wanted anyway, so Tony saw no point in directing him. He wasn't dominant enough.
And then, just like that, Steve was gone, and Bucky was suddenly enveloped in a dark, empty place, an echo-chamber without any windows.
Steve thought dryly. "Loving the get-up, Stark. Scared of being late?"
He held up his arm and heard the bullet ping off it, felt the vibration all the way up to his teeth.
He wondered if he was the only person in this room whose mate had somehow been bonded without also being raped.
There was a quiver in his voice and the old Captain America was in the room for a brief second, a glint in his eyes... but then he was gone and he was plain old Steve Rogers again.
Steve couldn't help but return the doctor's smile as Tony's fussing. Honestly, at that point, Steve didn't really care who saw what. But it was sweet that Tony did. He took the robe gratefully before Tony bent down to get started on his shoes.
Sam shuddered as a breeze blew through; the papers in the lab fluttered around like a million white bats.
"Absolutely not," said Sitwell.
!  Steve, these are-- are these what I think they are?" asked Tony, turning around.
"...legislation for public safe spaces, starting with state universities," the first lady was saying.  Steve was nodding.  Tony nodded too even though he couldn't care less and didn't know what they were talking about.  "Oh, you really have to meet Irshad, she's on the draft committee-- Irshad, come here, meet Captain Rogers..."
He had nothing else to say.  For some reason, leaving the hand on pavement had been the worst part.  Like it was already garbage or something.
Natasha made a
"You got it.  Mushrooms and pineapple.  JARVIS! Order us two larges... Steve, will that be enough?  I know you eat like a freakin' bear. JARVIS, give preference to Domino's, tell them there's a nice tip in it for them if they get it to us through that mob.  And throw up
Jarvis had never, in Tony's memory, said no to Howard.  Theirs was a different generation.  Howard loved Jarvis but ordered him around without a second though, and Jarvis obeyed; he never said a word against Howard, not when Howard got drunk and told Tony was a worthless, stupid sissy he was.  He'd comfort Tony with a kind of neutral diplomacy worthy of a UN ambassador.  Tony remembered how hurt he'd felt, not only by his father's words, but how Jarvis wouldn't ever say anything against him.  He wanted Jarvis to say that Howard was the stupid one, that he was wrong, and a drunk, and that Tony deserved better in a father.  But he never heard that.  Jarvis seemed almost incapable of even thinking such thoughts against Howard.  Tony had forgiven him long ago, and now, knowing that they were bonded, Tony could appreciate why Jarvis had been so reluctant to take sides.
Steve didn't like disturbing him. The lab was Tony's space and when he was working he never liked being interrupted. But Steve knew he hadn't eaten anything for far too many hours so took the pizza box downstairs.
She seemed serious enough that Tony shut up and played quietly with the 1974 Expo model for the rest of the ride to his home.
"-I like cats more than dogs," said Tony quietly.  "I think black licorice is great, gets a bad rap for no reason.  My favorite actress is Salma Hayek.  Or Amy Nuttall.  Oh!  Or Phoebe Cates.  Hers were the first breasts I ever saw.
They'd warned him about Gene Bennett, but Rhodey was still surprised when they met.  Gene was easily the most pleasant, charming person he'd ever met.
"Why don't you go into the kitchen and Maria can make everyone some cocoa, or something?"
"Oh, yes.  Any omega can be trained... if the Alpha is willing," said Maggie, staring pointedly at Tony.  She checked her watch. "Well, it's nearly time for us to start. If you want to sit in, Stark, you're more than welcome.  But you'll have to take that collar off."
Steve swallowed thickly. "This isn't about what I want. This is about what's
"Well, just so you know, you could honestly be Barnes's stunt double.  Just get a shave and a haircut, and people would start calling you Bucky!"  She was still smiling. Apparently she was complimenting him.
"Where is he?" Steve asked softly, meeting Danielle's gaze.
side, spunky!"
.  That was the childish thought that was keeping Tony from dropping.  He had to be wrong.  There had to be a mistake.  Tony's brain was already scrambling for an explanation.  Maybe Steve hadn't really miscarried, maybe he was wrong somehow.  Maybe it wasn't Bucky, it was just... just a guy who looked like him, a HYDRA trick...
Tony reached for Steve's hand, surprised to discover nervousness creeping up on him.
"Omegas don't have to serve.  Steve doesn't serve."
"Slow down," protested Agent Simmons.  She and Tony got into an unmarked car; she slapped a siren on the roof.  "How bad is he?"
He'd almost forgotten about Project 84 for the day, but it was one month until the shit hit the fan and he didn't know how to feel about that.
Maybe he could tell him without telling him, somehow.  It was certainly enticing, and Bucky was already so close to Steve, caressing him, nosing his neck, just behind his ears, where the scent glands were...
Steve followed the link he sent her. "Are you serious?" He turned the phone around to show Tony and slid it across the table.
Tony put a lazy hand out over the edge of the marble bath.  "Perfect, thank you," he said dismissively.
"That we can't consent! Yes, that's a big one. That's garbage." Steve said, slowly eating the newly delivered grapes. He'd written a list of important things to bring up because he knew he'd need a mental list. Right now all he really wanted to think or talk about was sex. And he wasn't supposed to do that... why, exactly?
"You got me flowers," he repeated, dumbfounded.  Steve was correct. Tony had never received flowers before, unless you counted all the fucking orchids they had gotten from mating.
Donner frowned.  He was doing a puzzle on the coffee table.  "I don't think it's cold. If anything, it's really hot in here already."
. Steve had eaten the whole basket before he'd even realised it. He often consumed entire bowls of stuff and didn't even pay attention until it was too late. But before Steve could feel sheepish about how much he'd eaten Tony set down a box between them. It was small, innocent looking. But Tony looked nervous.
The waiter came by and placed a salad in front of them; Tony unfurled a napkin (the waiter has replaced the one Tony had drenched earlier), placed it on his lap, and proceeded to pick at the food, uninterested, chasing leaves of arugula around the plate with his fork without actually eating anything.
He wasn't an Alpha at all.
"I find it uprising you've never been court-martialed before, to be honest," admitted Steve.
Yeah. Steve would never get it.
Okay. So Trey was high, or at least...seemed a little high (Steve wasn't very good at deciphering this sort of thing). His pupils certainly looked a little too big and too dark to be normal.  Then again, he was wearing sunglasses and so maybe his pupils were like that because of the tint.
"My name is Sitwell. I'm from SHIELD."
Tony frowned and tossed the pamphlet onto a nearby end table.  "...be careful out there," he warned.
"Maybe," said Natasha.  "If that's what they're doing then they have no idea what they're up against."  She gave Steve a gentle smile and put a hand on his arm. "You can't let them get to you."
"Steve, can you just come out for a quick word first?" It was Pepper or Aria; he was still too asleep to tell.
"We're pretty certain we've identified Karpov as one of the men Steve saw and spoke to," Sam piped up and Fury nodded.
"You're going to get us all killed," Steve told him and he was being more than confrontational.
"You lied to me. "
. His hands fisted in the sheets again and his eyes screwed shut. His eyes were watering again for entirely different reasons. The pain got worse as Gleason drew the excess liquid out of the wound and Steve let out a strangled sound.
"You hurt a lot of your friends in the backlas.h Steve," Hill said.
parties, whatever that means."
The drive went quicker than Steve would have liked it to.
Tony looked shocked and offended at the suggestion.
"I swear to Turing..." growled Tony as he and Donner drove north on the Pacific Coast Highway.  His hackles were up and he wasn't bothering to try to flatten them. They were in one of Tony's convertibles, a sleek sunburst-orange Corvette.  It was a lovely, clear, blue-skied day. Donner looked absolutely mortified; he was shrunk into his seat, unhappy at being in such close proximity to an aggressive Alpha.
"You wanna talk impractical?  Your suit's bright red."
"I love this," said Tony, relaxing on the couch, sipping a glass of Malbec.  "Don't you love this, Rhodey?"
!" yelled the Alpha, struggling to get up, his mouth tinged with blood.  "You're not a spade... you're an abomination, that's what you are! That's why you're not bonded!  No Alpha would want you! Because you're a
"They won't stop touching my arms," Steve said. "They're very... excited."
DeSoto cocked his head when Steve mentioned the forties.  It was weird to be reminded Steve was technically older than him; Steve still looked like he was in his twenties.
"Don't," said Phil.
in charge.  If you want to play, play."
Tony felt a whack on his shoulder, the suit vibrating around him; he set Steve down on the front steps of the Expo, but kept his hands on the other man's shoulders, as if terrified he might fall into pieces if Tony weren't holding him.
"I don't see what we're supposed to do once they bring him to us.  We already have the isolated compound from the '86 mission. What more do they want?" asked the older of the two men, leg jiggling, tapping his pencil on his knee.
"Did something happen to Steve?" she asked.
"...JARVIS?"  His voice cracked when he said the familiar name.
For Tony, the whole evening passed in a blink.  It seemed like he'd only been sitting for a little bit when Aria came up looking for Steve to sing
Tony growled without meaning to and a moment later he and Hammer were inches from each other's faces.  He didn't even realize he was doing it until he was there, teeth bared, ready to tear Justin limb from limb.  Justin dropped Steve's hand in a flash.
Ace came home with some other omega... well,
"The Winter Soldier has woken up
"He's supposed to be asleep."
"I remember being stuck in traffic for two hours because of it," said Phil grumpily.  He seemed even more humorless and passive-aggressive during heat. He turned up the music slightly, as if telling them to shut up.
The state of Nevada, which had desperately hoped to make an example out of Tony, had in the end found him not guilty of all charges, but had required him to pay back the Bellagio for damages and had also permanently revoked his license, stating that Tony's "temporary Les Vegas insanity" clearly demonstrated that he could not be trusted to drive while within the borders of the state.
Steve hoped they wouldn't see him any differently after today.
Tony shook his head out a little, trying to figure out what had just happened.  Had he been daydreaming?  It was the middle of the day and he was crouched in the courtyard of a tiny villa.  The house was a pale yellow color with red roof tiles and there was jungle around them, beyond the low stone walls of the courtyard.  Bright flowers and tile mosaics were everywhere.  Tony was reminded of the scene in
She was talking to him like a normal human being and Steve wanted to hug her.
"Is that town receiving any government money by any chance?"
Why hadn't Iron Man been there?  Why the fuck hadn't he realized what Steve was going through?  He had spent all day drinking and dicking around.
Wait a moment.
Tony's hands clenched onto the fabric of the sofa as Steve began rolling his balls around in his hand.
"Oh.  That.  All good things," agreed Tony.  He hadn't been aware he was getting awarded or that Hammer had an upcoming trial.  He sipped his drink, letting the world soften around him, trying not to think about Steve covered in blood or getting shot at or--
him leave us alone?" asked Tony.  It was a distasteful idea to him. He felt that, as the Alpha in the relationship, he ought to be the one to tell Bucky not back off, not Steve.  But blah blah blah, civil rights and stuff, equality, et cetera.
Pepper looked surprised; she deposited her papers onto the broken countertop.  "What do you mean? Tiberius Stone went to school at Pine Hills."
"Goddammit,
"What is that, like an old dog toy you fished out of the trash or something?  Is this an inside joke?" asked Aria.
"Thanks," Steve mumbled and then closed his eyes.
"Well, then, making out in the parking garage probably isn't the best use of your time, is it?" said Kate teasingly.
The soldier realized the omega meant him.
Tony stuck out a hand glibly.
"The... the insurgents, that's who!  The... people who fired the missile!" said Tony, who seemed a bit taken back by her question.  "You know...
"The man in that photo didn't do it, Tony," Steve disagreed softly. "He's been dead a long time."
.  Wake up, you goddamn horseshoe."
Steve cracked open the second room looking grateful that he didn't have to look at Athena anymore; his blush wasn't fading.  The omegas in the second room-- there were two of them-- shrieked and gripped each other. They had identical blue eyes and straight, strawberry-blonde hair that came down to their shoulders.  Aside from one being male and one being female, they were shockingly matched.
Cooper's excitement was infectious; Lila shrieked with delight and grabbed a fistful of Natasha's shirt.  Laura passed her over; Lila babbled "Aunna Natnasha!
Fury looked back out the window.  Tony was still sitting there, unconscious, and the monitors were still blank.
He saw two guys go down but wasn't sure if he'd gotten the other two targets before a moment later they were engulfed in smoke and Steve was charging in, and Tony couldn't fire if Steve was in the middle of that.
"Hal!"  A woman was waving to her.  "Hal, come here..."
It was a scary thought...what was he going to do now? He thought about the eighty-four omega conversion camps out there and what had happened to Ty-- no.  Nott now. Not today. Steve could afford distractions for a day.
it, I fucking
"Actually, I might, lemme check..."  Eric began rooting through his pockets.  Onstage, Gail was giving a lengthy intro.  Tony pretended to seem interested because he didn't want to seem desperate.  Yet behind his sunglasses, he was watching anxiously. He didn't feel like Eric was checking too hard, frankly.  Eric had a stack of cards (of course he did, damned collar-maker and all).
Pepper's face twisted a little.  "...you're... not really his primary Alpha anymore, though.  I mean, he just admitted that to the entire world this morning."
"Tony, take a few deep breaths.  I know this is scary but I'm sure--"
or rather Steve's formal posting address, so I would pass it on to Steve but addressed it
One of the crew passed Steve a full glass, which he downed immediately.  He was swaying a little, like he was dunk. Louis clasped his hands in his lap.
Pepper stared at him, dumbfounded.  "Because they're
Just fine, as it turned out.  Steve had been taken under Hal's wing and was feeling far less self-conscious than he had before, although he was still well-aware that he was head and shoulders taller tan every other omega there.
The two of them chuckled, and Randy changed the channel.
"That's how Dad always read it," said Tony, looking down at the tablet and squinting at the text.
The man was laughing.  "You lose, Stark!"
"Captain America, drunk?" Danielle tilted her head curiously as they began to walk. "I didn't think such a thing was possible."
"I wonder, how did you two meet?" Pierce asked warmly from their left, the conversation drifting away to something else at the other side of the table. "When I heard you two had bonded, I had to admit I was quite surprised. You strike me as very different people."
"....would it really be so bad if they did?"
In the parking garage, Tony was sitting on the back of a car, swinging his legs and eating a sandwich.  Tony was wearing what appeared to be a grey fleece onesie, the hood pulled up; the hood had an overly cutesy face printed on it and Steve realized it was a squirrel costume.
sexy. Steve was not a naturally seductive or smooth person; he was clumsy and awkward. If he wasn't on the battlefield then he didn't know where he was going. He honestly couldn't really imagine what Clint did to 'stroke Natasha's ego' but he didn't think he really wanted to know either.
"Uh... sure.  Here's our volunteer tent; we have some Status Alliance volunteers who came all the way from Birmingham-- Barb here is a rape counselor, hello, Barb-- come meet the volunteers, all the counselors are dying to meet you, Captain..."
Steve's posture was very, very slightly hunched and it took Tony a moment to recognize it as self-consciousness.  Why the hell would Steve of all people be self-conscious?  His body looked like a Greek statue.  Tony was the one who should be embarrassed, with the arc reactor stuck in the middle of his chest like some sort of grotesque night light, and the heavy scarring surrounding it, and with numerous faint scars marking him.  But he hadn't felt self-conscious about any of that for a long time.  He was, after all, Tony goddamn Stark and he had a "playboy" reputation to maintain.  Three months after his ordeal overseas, he had resumed his usual lifestyle, powering through any misgivings with a ferocious desire to be normal again.  Or at least as normal as someone like him could ever be.
She checked her watch.  "My shift ends in about twenty minutes.  There's a Starbucks across the street. How's that?"
Steve tried to take the pills. He struggled, a lot. He dropped about five white pills in the blankets somewhere before finally managed to swallow ten. It was hard work and he had to drink at least two bottles of water to get them down.  That was the last of their water; a small pile of empty bottles was beside the couch. He was still shaking and Tony was still inside of him. Steve let out a withered breath and dropped the second, crumpled bottle. It landed on the floor noisily.
"Clearly," said Natasha with a friendly eye-roll.  She and Sam herded Tony and Steve out of the cafeteria.  Tony had barely touched his food at all.  His grip on Steve's hand remained there, like a steel trap.
Tony was sure he'd be able to sort it all out later.  Currently, his brain was panicking quietly about Ivan Vanko.  He made a note to talk to Pepper about it on Friday, when he saw her at the Expo.
In the bright blue sky above them, a jet moved eastward, and Wanda wondered if it was carrying Stark and his mate (it was too high up to tell), and if he ever felt guilty for all the destruction he'd caused and lives he'd reaped, and if they would ever be forgiven by Steve for killing his Alpha.  She found she didn't care; forgiveness was a luxury she'd long since given up on.
Tony's mood was turning darker by the minute.  He'd had a brief, unhappy childhood, isolated by money and intelligence and his father's reputation.  It had ended with his parents' sudden deaths; at the age of 16, he was the CEO of a company worth more money than he could possibly imagine.  His only family had been Stane and Jarvis, but Jarvis had passed two years later, eaten away by grief for his father.  Tony hadn't cried at his parents' funeral, too shell-shocked, but had made up for it at Jarvis's.
"He was the eldest of four children."
Steve went back upstairs. He just grabbed a dressing gown and sat by Tony's bedside, stroking through his hair gently as he slept before he reached for the phone. He ordered them a proper breakfast, with waffles and everything, hoping Tony would manage to eat some of it.
He licked Steve's neck, mostly out of instinct.  It tasted like blood but there was none of the bitterness that it had once had.  Steve still had on the collar, and every time Tony looked at it, thought about how
It required a bit of clever thinking.  The slot in the door was too narrow to allow a proper cup, but managed to procure a wide, flash dish, not unlike a pie tin, and fill that with water.  He took it very carefully back downstairs so that he didn't spill any of it.
She didn't need to point out that Tony, despite his snarky posturing in public, was someone who had been deeply affected by his experience in Afghanistan.  Steve knew it better than anyone. During the year they'd lived together, he'd witnessed things that only a precious few were privy to: the panic attacks and the night terrors, the occasional off-hand remark, the drinking.  Tony's intelligence made him remarkably good at masking his trauma, but it came out in strange ways, and living with him, the patterns resolved clear and bright and unmistakable, like a picture suddenly jumping out from one of those "hidden eye" images that initially looks like static.  Once seen, it was impossible to miss.
Brooke laughed again. The noise was sweet. "Did you just call me
Steve stared incredulously as Tony continued to ramble about Bucky, about what the media thought, about a couple named Sony and Cher.  As usual, Tony was burying the heavy stuff under pop culture references.
"It's me, Barton, your favorite Avenger!" said Tony cheerfully.
Pepper and Aria lunged together, shoving Wanda to the ground, pining her hands behind her back.  "Gleason! Sedate them!" demanded Pepper.
"Look her up.  Is she an Alpha?"
"Who's Rhodey?" asked Kerry.
Ten years ago, Nick Fury had helped Clint and Laura Barton buy a farm in Montana.  The farm was not in any SHIELD records. Now, over a decade later, he had been called upon for a similar task.  He didn't owe Steve or Natasha or Clint anything. But Nick Fury was a practical man. Bucky was not safe out in the world alone, where HYDRA could snatch him up.  Bucky was also not safe in SHIELD, which was infiltrated. They did not know the extent to which it was. Jasper Sitwell was the only known mole, and because Natasha and Clint and Sam and Phil and Tony hadn't gone through due process, he had been let go.  Fury had had every intention to go after him and arrest him properly, after reading him his Miranda rights. But in the couple of hours between his release and the arrest, he had slipped away, slippery little eel that he was. SHIELD was compromised and the Avengers Initiative was dead.  But Bucky needed contained. Those were the simple facts.
he would have wanted to be knotted to his omega. This was nice, not embarrassing; after all, they were bonded and it was perfectly natural to--
"I hope your pride in your loneliness is enough to keep you warm at night," she said softly, coldly, before lowering her arm and jerking her head  "Captain?  Agents Barton, Coulson...?"
"Tony, you were there.  I can take your statement separately--" offered Maria.  Tony let out a snarl-wail, clinging harder to Steve. "...or not," she finished.
Bucky stood around in the exhibit for another twenty minutes before he went to find Cece.  Someone mistook him for a wax statue of "POW Bucky" and then apologized profusely when they realized he was alive.
Yes.  There was a man.  Or maybe an angel.  Tony didn't believe in such things, but the man approaching him had wings, wings of electricity.  No.  That didn't make sense.  Tony's brain tried to figure it out.  Was he dead?  That couldn't be right.  If he was dead, why did he feel nauseous?
"Steve, were you talking with Donner Malick earlier?  ...you know he
Tony didn't protest; he took the water and drank it gratefully.  "Okay.  Fine.  ...what's your problem with Pierce and Malick?  I can feel you, you know.  If you were an Alpha, your dander would've been up."  (Omegas lacked the muscles Alphas had on the back of their necks; if they'd had them, breaking the bonding gland would have been rendered impossible.)  "Aren't they SHIELD guys?  Or something?  I think they're Fury's bosses."  He leaned into Steve, throwing an arm around his waist for stability.  "...is he gonna be okay?" he asked worriedly.
"Alright," said Steve, feeling slightly better.  "Thanks."
Tony dragged himself out after the blond, grabbing Happy for support.
Tony gritted his teeth.  Was Steve
"Don't look now, Steve, but you're got a couple of admirers," said Natasha, changing the subject. She was rarely emotional and rarely spoke much about her and Clint; clearly, she wanted them to forget it.
"Didn't know you had to talk to him to do that."
He reached up to touch his chest, check the reactor.  It was still there, of course. His hands were shaking.  His heart was pounding. Had he just had a panic attack? Entirely possible.  How much time had passed? All day, from the looks of it. He wasn't high anymore; he felt weary, his muscles stiff.
Pietro was at Bucky's side in a flash.
He grabbed the trousers off the bed.
He rubbed a hand over his face and leaned back, or rather, onto his side. His neck hurt too much to lean on. He shaking with a strange sense of gratitude. He remembered what Natasha said, about how she found them... but still. This was something. Bucky hadn't been far gone enough to actually go through with it.  There was still some Bucky in the Winter Soldier, after all.
"But he smelled-"
"...did you bring him?" asked Fury.  All three of them wore identical masks; there was no hint of sympathy, anger, or anything else.  Just mild, professional detachment. Steve's demands for handing him over had been simple: he wanted Bucky to be safe.  No one in the world could promise that. But Natasha and Fury were the closest there were.
!-- she was handing Tony a black card printed on heavy paper stock.
Steve laughed gently when their gaze met. He didn't think Tony could quite believe it either.
Since Dr. Ludheim had directed Colonel Karpov not to do any more retraining sessions, Karpov had begun giving Bucky medicine instead.
She stopped in the middle of her sentence, staring down.
special effects were shit so you knew they weren't real. I don't like yours." Steve honestly didn't get how it was entertainment. He'd seen plenty of men die and it was never
"Don't get be wrong, Steve has an incredible body.  I mean, he's drop-dead gorgeous. But he doesn't look like an omega.  How's he supposed to model omega clothes for omegas when he's like six feet tall and two hundred pounds?"
"No, no, it's fine, really," she insisted.  She reached for the baby in Tiberius's arms, but Tiberius gave such a desperate look of pleading that her arms dropped.  Tiberius had gotten strangely quiet since the baby had been passed to him and Tony wondered suddenly if he could have children.  Did you need a bonding gland to do that? Another question for Dr. Gleason.
"I didn't, erm, actually realize until..."
"Go!" yelled Carter, opening her door and charging.
Piper and Five appeared.  "See, here's Steve," she said.  She and Five had linked arms.
Steve's entrance was tight, warm, and moist; he pushed against it, softly growling into Steve's neck, the mark that was half-his inside his mouth.
For once, his status was becoming a liability.  He was on the verge of getting cuffed when a woman shouldered her way in a flashed a badge.  "SHIELD, Agent Simmons, I'll take him from here."
Did Steve even know what Takotsubo syndrome was?  Could you get Takosubo syndrome if you weren't bonded?  Would he have ever agreed to go undercover if he knew he'd end up killing Tony this way?  Because Tony was sure he was dying.  How ironic.  He'd saved his life, he'd replaced the reactor... now he was alive... but he was dying, suffering... pining for Steve... and, conveniently, he'd already put all his affairs in order, expecting to die... he had given away the company and the suit and made provisions in his will for what remained of his art collection, his cars, his guitars... which had been destroyed today, anyway...
just fall to his death," said the tech, and with that, she turned and clicked smartly out of the room, leaving them to stare at Tony's sleeping form beyond the glass.
"...he's a good guy, though," said Tony quickly.  "...I think it's hard for betas to really get it, y'know?  Beta presidents never really address status issues much."  He didn't say what both of them were probably thinking.  That there had never been an omega president.  That omegas were woefully under-represented.  That, with the exception of banning arranged bonding, there hadn't been any new leaps forward for equality in Tony's lifetime.
"Incredible. Sure," Steve hummed, amusedly as he leaned in the doorway. Tony was efficient and well practised as he sorted out his facial hair into the perfect Stark look. Steve was sort of grateful he was an omega; the growth of facial hair, for him, was glacial.  He didn't have the patience for it anyway.  He only had to shave once a month. Steve liked the way Tony's beard scratched gently against his cheek when he kissed him though. "There's some general cardio stuff. But nothing you can't handle."
"So glad you're back.  So glad," murmured Tony, tracing Steve's lips with a finger.  They were so pink and plump and soft. He leaned down to kiss them.  "Never gonna let you go again... I swear... love you so much..." He kissed Steve's throat, pressing himself a little more insistently between Steve's legs.
This was the first time in years he'd done anything even remotely like the old stuff he'd used to enjoy, and he sure as hell wasn't going to ruin it by admitting to Steve that the idea of calling him
don't mind, but I kinda do."
Banjo frowned. "I don't know what you're talking about."
Tony paused, feeling like he'd misunderstood.  "Excuse me?" he prompted when T'Chaka didn't elaborate.
The two of them let go of each other's hands, and Malick left the room, talking calmly with the other DoD rep.
"Don't call your father by his first name. It's crass," said Jarvis without missing a beat.
Three rapid shots.  One, two, three.  One went wide, two hit their mark.  Not in the head, though.  One on the shoulder and one in the back.  Non-lethal.  He would have sworn but that would have been a waste of energy; he was already moving, stalking forward, wanting to find a better position.
"We should do a background check," Ian piped up.
Tony appeared just after Steve began answering.  His tie was undone (typical) but otherwise he looked well-groomed.  Frankly it might have been just another business day; he was in a black suit and in a burgundy tie, but aside from the demure colors, he looked fairly well put-together.  He'd thrown on a pair of sunglasses already, which indicated he probably hadn't put in contacts. His beard and hair were neat and he was fiddling with a watch as he descended the stairs.
"Steve," Tony managed to croak out.
"Yeah, I'm so glad I have a regular name," interjected George.  "Seriously, it's old-fashioned to name kids differently if they're omegas."  He was speaking a little too loudly and quickly.
Tony woke from a sleep that had been dreamless.  He hadn't been bothered by the other Alpha in at least a couple of weeks, for which he was immensely grateful.
Brooke reached over to run a hand down his arm.  "...I think it's sweet how humble you are. I'm sure you hear this all the time, but there's a lot of omegas out there you're really helping."  She pressed a little closer. "...you're probably sick of getting thanked... but here I am... wanting to thank you just like everyone else... wanting to..."  She leaned in a little more. "...show my gratitude..." She tangled her hand into Steve's. Her fingers were the opposite of Tony's; his were rough and calloused.  Hers were impossibly soft.
come from?
"You're ruining these children's lives."
"This isn't the worst bite I've ever seen," said Dr. Gleason, tilting Steve's head back and forth gently.  "...normally it's younger Alphas that cause the most damage. I suppose he's got a lot of time to make up for, eh?"  He smiled a little and began pulling out gloves and wipes to clean off the back of Steve's neck.
sus Christ!" he said.  He looked like he was about fifteen and his smell was neutral, beta-like.  He had dark brown hair that flopped into his eyes and he sat up against his pillow in his blue hospital gown, looking alarmed at Steve's presence.  "...MELINDA?" he hollered.
But it didn't make sense.
"Where's your friend?  Do you need a few more minutes?"
Everyone wished Rhodey good luck and he strode off to drive to meet Gene, feeling somewhat awkward knowing that every movement and word and noise he made from here on out was going to be monitored, recorded, and watched by a group of people.
Fury held up a handgun and squeezed off six rounds in rapid succession.
Aria shook her head, and then offered Steve a small, sad smile.  "Now you know how Tony feels," she said quietly.  It was rare for her to stand up for Tony, and Tony pretended not to overhear her, although Steve saw him clutch his hand a little tighter, and he thought he did understand, at least a little more, why Tony spent so much time down in his shop.
? Maybe he would finally be getting some of the mysterious Barton backstory. He knew Clint didn't get serious often, but this felt like one of those times. If he just wanted to see Steve it was probably for a reason, not just a dislike of Tony- though Steve couldn't rule out that possibility entirely.
"This is actually one of the best birthdays I've ever had," he said to Steve.  Steve was sitting next to him, also with cucumbers over his eyes. They were holding hands.  Steve had been informed he didn't really need a face mask ("Your skin is already so youthful!") but Tony had insisted just because he liked seeing Steve treated.
"He means with our lives," Twelve said impatiently. "Not our evening plans." And suddenly all eyes were on Steve again.
him. He'd more just... decided to neglect Steve's entire existence as of late.  They were still bonded; Steve could feel him, faintly, in the back of his mind.
"...Tony's still got a lot of problems."
"Lead the way," Steve whispered and squeezed his hand lightly.  Tony threw on boxers and a wifebeater before they headed downstairs to find Pepper and the doctor chatting in the breakfast nook on stools, as if they started every day like this. Pepper had coffee and half eaten waffles in front of her. The doctor had just a coffee and he honestly looked a little awkward, a suitcase by his feet.
Steve fell quiet again and leaned his side against the back of the couch, glancing around the eerily quiet workshop as he felt Tony's breathing slowly evening out alongside the pace of his own. "Do you think one of your suits would be stronger than me?" he asked curiously and abruptly, the thought popping into Steve's head; a convenient, and lighter, change of topic.
It took every ounce of Steve’s being not to snap back around and lift Tony up by his collar and ask him what the hell he thought he was doing.
"Yeah, no, he was pretty clear about that," said Tony, tossing back his drink.  He reached for more vodka and orange juice. "So why are you mad at me again?"
Tony had killed men before.  Lots of men, actually.  They said you never forgot.  But Tony's first slaughter had been in the Mark 1, which lacked any of the fancy HUD display of the later models.  Functionally, it had pretty much been a weaponized medieval suit of armor.  Tony had been mostly blind and deaf in it, and he'd crunched through bodies and wasted a whole camp with missiles and fire, and never given it a second thought.  He'd easily wasted like, a hundred, two hundred people.  Maybe more. Who knew?  Tony didn't really feel like a person in the suit.  He didn't consider that blood on his hands.  The six people who had died at the Expo... those lives mattered a hell of a lot more to him than the hundreds left dead in the desert, somewhere near Kunar.
"I'm old-fashioned myself," said Rhodey.  Lying didn't come as easily to him as it did to Tony; Tony was a master of duplicity, someone who could smooth-talk his way through anything.
tell Nat," he added.  It wasn't a joke.  He hoped Steve would have the decency not to tell anyone about this outpouring of sincerity.  He'd never live it down.  Tony had been known for being sarcastic and uncaring for decades.  It was an image he'd cultivated since he was a teenager, even since he was fifteen and someone asked him what he was going to do in college and he'd answered "drugs," which had been worth the blow-out fight it had caused with Howard.
"What about your omega civil rights campaign?"
"Sober?" Dr. Martin echoed and raised a brow. Her hair was jet black. "Are you an alcoholic, Mr Stark?" she asked bluntly.
"Yeah," Steve breathed. "I could do this all day."
Fury took the opportunity to turn to Steve.  "Let's get something straight,
"You need to get out," Brennan snapped. "All of you. Before he has a panic attack!"
...how did he end up on the floor?
"Coop, you know who this is?" asked Clint.
Tony peered at Steve over the top of his sunglasses.
with you, present. When you touch me there it's like I'm dreaming or something."
?  When
"...that's one of his," said Natasha with a roll of her eyes.  Sure enough, Steve caught a glimpse of STARK printed on the gun.  Tony handled every weapon with a loving familiarity.  He hadn't merely shot these weapons before; he had designed them.  In fact, he'd demonstrated more than half of them personally at the very same base.  "He still hasn't beaten Clint's record," added Natasha with a slight hint of annoyance.  It probably had something to do with Tony showing off; he was talking shop with several of the enlisted men who had wandered down to hear him talk about the guns, and it was turning into an ad hoc demonstration.  Tony may not have made weapons anymore, but he was clearly still proud of anything with his name stamped on it.

"I am JARVIS, Mr. Stark's automated personal assistant.  Please be aware that your unauthorized entry to Mr. Stark's private residence has forced me to alert the authorities, and that further actions may be taken to ensure Mr. Stark's safety, pursuant to California Penal Code Section 198.5."
"We... I don't think we
"Hello, Nadine Garland speaking."
"That's not up to you.  He's your assistant on behalf of Fury," said Natasha.
"Stable."
"An omega boy killed himself in one of the camps," Stone said flatly. "He was fourteen years old.  They raided the camp and found a lot of instances of illegitimate surgical procedures and unlicensed practitioners.”
But then, his Alpha was MIA. He had no family. There would have been no one to miss him. He felt a strange sensation in his belly.
He sipped the cool liquor, enjoying the burn that curled in his stomach.
Tony opened his mouth to make some sarcastic remark.  But his wit failed him; maybe it was Steve's sincerity.
"Hey, look-- Steve, look, this isn't a bad thing," said Tony, sitting down next to Steve and putting an arm around his shoulders.  "He seems... happy. We'll get him a therapist, like Gleason said-- thanks, by the way, David--"
"He punched a wall. Well, we don't know if it was him," Pepper said quietly. "Some people messed with his head. They-"
"Three
"I should go check on Tony first," Steve said. "He needs food too." Jed nodded, following behind Steve. He tapped away at his phone as he walked, downloading the soundbite.
"Oh, good boy," praised Tony, who could see how taut Steve's muscles were.  "Good boy, taking it all in for your Alpha... yes... just like that... the whole thing, Steve.  Let me fill you up. Let me see you take this whole dick, just for me..."
"Who is this guy?  What does he do?"
"So, how we getting inside?"
..."  He wiggled again but it didn't matter.  Tony's knot was too big at the moment. "This is Pepper's fault, I
"Nightclubs are very different to the kind of dancing I'm used to," Steve pointed out, smiling a little. "We used to dance to the beat and with proper moves and everything. Now there's just... a lot of grinding. Not sure it counts as real dancing."
His own cock was pulsing deliciously against Steve's leg and he was trying not to orgasm before Steve because the idea of doing so made him feel a little bit pathetic (he was giving a blowjob, not receiving one, after all), but admittedly, the feeling of Steve clenching wetly around his fingers was driving him crazy.
One rubbed a hand over their face. "I don't wanna fight anyone..."
was the real Bucky; complaining about not having smoke for a while, even when they'd be getting goddamn shot at. Dum-Dum would find it hilarious. Steve sometimes found Bucky's priorities worrying.
"Pretty sure only SHIELD's got that.  All people know is that there was an assassination attempt, Captain America was shot, and a bunch of armed gunmen did a lot of damage in downtown LA.  The news is saying it's a hate crime, because of his work with omega rights."
"Oh, hello, Mrs. Hogan," said Tony perkily.
!" Steve winced as the needle pierced the gland. It
"Knock 'em dead, Steve.  I love you," said Tony quietly, looking smug.  He reached up and touched the pin consciously, clearly proud of himself for doing at least one thing right today.
He looked down at Tony's lap and then back up at his face again. Steve wanted-- he wanted so badly in ways he didn't even understand. "I want--" Steve stopped himself, cheeks turning a tinge pink. He swallowed and then sighed.  "Tony, that felt really good," he whispered like it was a secret.
knew where these goddamn glands are..."  Tony couldn't keep the bitterness out of his voice.  "How the hell is it that I'm forty and you're ninety-four and neither of us knows any of this stuff?  These guys are supposed to be the backwards ones, not us." He paused. "...you gonna spend tonight with the other omegas?  You should try to talk to Rex... did you hear he was at the same place as Ty? I wonder if they knew each other."
The worst part was thinking, feeling, that Steve had maybe liked him.
"Surely he should be the one worrying about that," Tiberius pointed out. "He did... well, you know."
Pepper looked over.  She had known Tony for more than ten years and never seen him quite this feral.  Tony had been largely uncommunicative the entire time since she had arrived; Tony haven't moved away from Steve and remained on top of him, snarling at everyone who came by, his only words mumbles of comfort toward Steve.
"Tell us the name of your omega."
"Sorry?"
"Okay, okay, okay, I gotta ask, though--" said the woman on the counter, sipping her cocktail delicately.  "--your ex-mate, or first mate, whatever, what's the deal with that? He's, like, ninety years old, right? Do you and Tony, like, go visit him a nursing home somewhere, or like--"
Everything was murky.
"Yeah, but we're bonded, and we
Steve's hurt curdled into anger.  Anger he'd probably take out on the next guy that shot him.
But there was an age difference. And one day Tony would be sick and maybe... maybe one day he'd be making a call to Banksy just like this one. It was a chilling thought.
Tony flipped his open and pulled a pen out of his front pocket.
Throughout dinner, everyone was talking politely and pleasantly about various aspects of their lives.  Rodriguez's daughter had taken up flute lessons.  Louisa Ellis had a funny story about her sister, also an omega, who had bonded to an Alpha and gotten a very rare emerald orchid that, it turned out, was merely a white orchid that someone had dyed.  Irshad had recently given a lecture at Culver University, where General Ross had a daughter.  Everyone was very careful not to ask why, exactly, Steve had shown up an hour late and covered in blood.  It just wasn't polite.  The conversation touched lightly a few times on omega rights, which Tony struggled to look interested in even though he could barely follow.
Hawley looked up to meet his gaze. "You will never have any contact with the Winter Soldier ever again. You were with him for six hours, totally unmonitored and that is absolutely unacceptable. Do you understand that?"
about?" she demanded, referring to the altercation between Tony and Justin.
Steve couldn't believe that Tony chose now to talk about something so trivial. While Tony began arguing with Pepper, Steve turned and left. He didn't even think Tony noticed, hearing a final "
"You guys related or anything?"
He offered the waiter a pleasant look when he finally turned to him. "Do you do pizza?" he asked. "I'm starving."
Around one in the morning Steve passed out from exhaustion, his misery and guilt keeping him awake until then. Then he slept heavily. His body was dead from all the driving and his mind exhausted from all the turmoil. He needed the sleep and slept away well into the late hours of the morning, not even waking when the sun bled through the cracks in the curtains and spilled out onto the bed.
Barton had to be a super-common name, right?  There was no possible relation there, right?  He strained to listen to the muffled conversation going on in the bedroom.
"No, he's just letting-- oh!  Oh, I'm doing it! I'm doing it!"
"...you don't say," said Tony, trying to play it cool.  His body was betraying him; he was shivering with anticipation.  Steve's fingertips were roaming over his skin and Steve was staring at him with those sharp blue eyes and Tony was melting into the bed.  He liked how Steve teased him, how Steve sometimes paused before responding, as if he was considering whether or not he really would.  He always did but seeing Steve think about it, knowing he was his own person... Tony liked it.
.  Most of them were unbonded, not a part of this world. "Captain America," one girl whispered. "I saw you in the lobby; did you really got shot
Tony stared at a display case for several long, silent moments before Natasha grabbed four and then dragged him over to a table in the corner.  "Here.  Eat," she demanded, setting a muffin in front on him on the table.  Tony picked listlessly at it, his face pale.
"I got it." Holiday hunting would be a nice thing for Steve to get into. He needed something get his head out of that conference. He was still somewhat horrified by the whole experience. "Thanks Aria."
."  Tony obediently pulled off the lid and huffed the coffee.  It smelled great.
So the word was spreading.
"Is it because of my smell?" asked Tiberius bluntly.
This originally started as a one-shot but ended up in the RP.  As a resident of Los Angeles, I pictured Bucky's location as most likely Venice Beach.  The people he meets are based on three of my real-life friends, whose names I didn't change, who stated that they were "honored" to be featured in a fanfic as hippie stoners. - T
"I see.  Were you interested in attending one of our meetings?  We'd love to have you."
The words washed over Steve and he stopped understanding them after the word 'quotient' and zoned out. Tony was certainly vert excited about it and that was very cute but that was where it kind of stopped for Steve. He didn't get it. He wasn't sure he wanted to. Math and science had never been his thing and it never would be. "Very cool," Steve hummed, looking slightly bemused.
"Just let me carry you and I'll tell you everything you wanna know about your brother."
"My God, how did you get this far without knowing any of this?  ...you know, Captain America is actually pushing for omega education--"
"Get this.  He convinced them not to tag Clint, because they said he was... what did they say again, Clint?"
in jeans. Before, when he was small, Steve hadn't ever felt 'good' in anything. It felt nice to, well, feel nice. He headed down to the workshop, having already laid out Tony's selection of outfits on the bed for him depending on how smart/casual he wanted to go.
Tony would have liked to continue but he couldn't help laughing at Steve squeal of surprise, and also he had to pull away because Steve had nearly kicked him in the face.  Steve's reflexes made it damn near impossible to ever really surprise him, and even if Tony managed to, it often ended in Steve going full soldier on him; Tony had been shoved against a wall a couple of times when he jumped out at Steve.
"Sure, babe," said Tony, watching Steve with concern.  He was a bit nervous about lying down with Steve, considering Steve had just thrown a cup across the room and also attacked him earlier.  But he emphasized with the flashbacks and he was feeling depressed about how Christmas Eve was turning out... not to mention Pepper's rejection.
"Steve.  You just tap anywhere on the screen," said Tony after a moment.
Several people were nodding.
"So do you want us to induce a heat or not?"
Happy didn't look convinced.  He put the tabloid into the glove box for later and drove them west, looking into the mirror curiously at them.
Everything froze.
There was a long pause.  "Not with each other, no."
"Fine," Steve sighed. Shame. He preferred bikes but admittedly Bucky knew a lot more about all this than he did. Steve might have been more mentally stable but he didn't have the expertise.
"Stark Industries always had a pretty open attitude, historically," said Tony with a small shrug.  "It's not that Dad was a raging liberal or anything  He just believed in hiring the best candidate for a job, regardless of what they were.  You know, he went into business with Stane in the forties, and Stane was Jewish... Everyone thought that was weird, at the time.  But Dad didn't care.  He said Stane was one of the smartest businessmen he'd ever met and he would have been a fool not to partner up with him."
"Keep going!" hollered Tony.  He gave a yank to the valve wheel on top of the chamber.
"Let's get something straight.  We're an integrated special operations team.  We're not here to help you hug things out when you get into a fight with your honey bun.  You told us you could go undercover and that you could do so without getting in too deep.  We didn't say anything when you bonded, because we understand these things happen.  But we can't ignore that your bond has compromised our organization and what we stand for and what we're here to protect.  You're on thin ice, Rogers.  You want to be the face of omega rights?  Then get up off that floor and start acting like it.  We hire omegas because we believe anyone can be strong, but what you're doing right now?  It's not the behavior we expect from Captain America.  This isn't a damn dating service.  This is an elite team that I've fought for years to keep integrated, and shit like this from omegas makes us all look bad."
"Yeah, sorry."  Donner let out another very soft, tiny groan of pain, clearly trying to keep it down for Steve and Tony.
Tony was shivering hard, uncontrollably.  He wasn't cold, though.
"...right," said Tony.  Steve was giving him a weird look.  Like he should know how heats worked.
think it would be swell," huffed Donner.
"Go north!  No, east! We gotta find him before Bucky does!  Please!"
"I'll pass you on Gene's details," Steve told Brent, pulling out his phone. Since the conference Piper hadn't messaged him once. He wasn't sure if it was a bad sign or not.
Unlike Richard's audience, this one was made up of Alphas who were clearly hostile toward Tony.  There were chairs taking up three-fourths of the room, but then, in the back, there was a corner devoid of chairs, and there were several omegas sitting here.  Tony's stomach turned a little. Was Steve expected to sit here with these other sad-looking omegas?
Tony resisted the urge to slap DeSoto.  It wasn't his fault he was like this; no doubt seeing Trickshot disappear had been traumatizing.  Ron probably threatened DeSoto with the same fate, all the time; no wonder DeSoto was so meek. "But he got rid of Trickshot, didn't he?  He had to take him somewhere, didn't he?"
Riley's words washed over Tony like water and he was suddenly aware that he was covered in sweat. So much sweat he might as well have been plunged into a swimming pool.  His fingers were wrinkled with it.  His mouth was dry as if it had been stuffed with cotton all night.  He tried to swallow, but his throat was like sand.  Had he had a panic attack in his sleep?  He felt terrified and he didn't know why.
"Tony!"  Pepper was calling him.
The twenty-first century was very strange sometimes.
Yasic leaned his elbows on the railing and inhaled, looking out over the dark city below them.  "...is it true that he'll do anything?"
"Yeah, well-- I can't let down Ty again," muttered Tony, toying with his empty tumbler.
"...why did you shush me to smell--"  Pepper stopped.  Her eyes widened marginally.  "...Tony, sit down," she commanded, forcing her voice to be calm.
A picture caught his eye.  There was a blond man and a man with dark hair and a small beard sitting in a restaurant together.  He stared at them.
Sam looked troubled so Steve prompted him as Gleason soon became busy getting out tubes and swabs and anti-bacterial wipes. It was a distraction, at least.  "What about Yemen?" he asked.
They had food on the plane (Tony always kept his plane as well-stocked as any of his residences, because he spent so much time there) but for once Steve wasn't devouring sandwiches at lightning speed. He didn't like flying on a full stomach; it still made him nervous.  When he'd been undercover with Tony he'd had had to get used to flying pretty quickly. But Steve had hated initially. It was probably because he'd sort of died in a plane that one time and had crash landed it into the ocean... so Steve didn't really think he could do anything about the negative connotations that came with flying.  He'd never like flying as much as he once had.  That was just another small thing the war had ruined for him.
This had led to a minor scandal back in the early eighties, when Howard Stark had tried to start up a charity to give every child in Wakanda a StarkTech version of a Palm Pilot, which was, at the time, not yet released on the market and considered absolutely cutting-edge, technologically speaking.  (Howard didn't believe in traditional aid but felt that education was the key to success.)  Wakanda had refused to accept his offer; in a fit of irate offense, he had flown a plane over their country and dropped the technology himself by the crateful, which had led to a bout of furious UN meetings.  (Wakanda was very weird about having their airspace invaded, for some reason.)  Howard had missed Tony's twelfth birthday over the whole debacle.
losing it . This is what I was
Steve was about to offer his hand out to Danielle to shake when prawns were shoved into his hand. She had bright green eyes that pierced right through him. Her presence reminded Steve of Natasha. He certainly didn't want to get on her bad side.
"And Tony, you're with me, the board wants you," said Pepper, rising.
Right on cue, the doctor arrived.
?" Steve was so far removed from the captain on the battlefield it was eerie. The man who knew just how far he could bend back a knee without breaking it was gone and a shivering omega who was desperate for validation was in his place.
Steve moved carefully into the room, each movement oddly graceful and thought out as he knelt down in front of Tony. And then he moved to practically bow, his forehead pressed to the floor and his back arched over in an utter gesture of submission. He let his eyes slip shut. Steve exhaled. He didn't feel Bucky's bond, but he felt Tony's. He felt it burning hot inside of him like a furnace. It felt like passion and confusion and fury. Steve wanted to make it clear he was
