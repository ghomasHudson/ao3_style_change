“Not one of my better one’s unfortunately. Simply my body and its redundant, inefficient needs. I do what I must to keep it functioning, but no more. I can go days with out food or sleep. Or speaking.”
This was getting into the weeds of bullshit much faster than James had planned, and he couldn’t let Parker skew their perception of John.
“If such a thing could be done, I would welcome it gladly. Though I suspect Trevor would not enjoy Watson’s long deployments. It would seem kinder to both to find another arrangement.” John hadn’t asked, hadn’t even suggested he wanted James to do this, but he wasn’t going to walk away without even trying. John Watson deserved a better alpha than the one he’d been saddled with, and well, in for a penny. If they could revert his ownership back to his sister, James was sure John wouldn’t let her commit such abuses again.
Emancipation, when an omega held their own papers, wasn’t unheard of. It regularly occurred when a bonded omega’s alpha died, and if any unbonded omega could manage it, it would be John Watson. But James knew better than to ask for such. He put on his most placating voice. “I would never suggest something like that. I simply feel that returning his ownership to his sister would be best for all involved. It was a foolish, possibly inebriated, error on her part to give her brother up.”
Instead she pressed her breasts against his exposed chest and whispered in his ear, “So far, what makes you think anything I’ve said is untrue, John? Sherlock isn’t contradicting me because he doesn’t want me to stop. And I don't think you do either, based on this.” She cupped his growing arousal through his trousers.
Sherlock scowled, “You are being predictably unreasonable about this, John. But I shouldn’t have expected better.” The hot lead in John’s stomach burned white
“Retired Colonel Sebastian Moran, which again I’m sure John said. As with all things I put my mind to, I excelled at matchmaking. Moran is respected, well paid, and very supportive of John’s military career.”
“Ah, while it may be one of his patients or brothers in arms, I suspect you are picking up traces of my younger brother, Sherlock. My brother is a private detective and has been using the good doctor’s medical knowledge to assist with cases for Scotland Yard.”
“Afghanistan,” John replied, and after a beat, “How much has Mycroft told you? Because he hasn’t even given me your name.”
“It’s not the orders that bother me, not from a competent leader. It’s the ownership. And civilian alphas don’t have you shoot, or travel, or generally do interesting and dangerous things.” John came up short at that, thinking over the last few hours with Sherlock. “You’re one of the rare exceptions, but then I suppose that’s the case generally for you.”
John was chuffed. “Thanks for that, mate, means a lot. I’m at Kensington Central Library, but don’t rush. I need time to look into appealing the withdrawal. And on that, can you think of anyone I should call to get the request binned?”
John couldn’t figure out how this discussion had lasted so long. “You said it yourself, it’s just transport, so I’m not going to get worked up over it. He wanted it and he asked me first. It was a mutual act. End of story.”
“Yes, most omegas don’t put it off as long as you have by accident. Or at all. Your army training would have helped counteract the issue of your scent.”
Mycroft only responded with a small, ‘hmm,’ before gesturing for John to walk before him, out of the conference room. “If you will join me, we can get you situated. You will, of course, be moving into my home. Must keep up appearances. I’ve had your possessions relocated from Mr. Trevor’s flat, and if there are any other items you shall need, please let me know.”
It was Bill who made John start the blog. “I redeploy before you do, you berk, and if you get to do interesting things while stationed home, I want to be able to read about it in the middle of bum-fuck-nowhere.” John thought that was a fair point, and it wasn’t like he ever said no to Bill. Reading his comments would make the effort absolutely worth it, anyway.
“Which means you bullied them. This-” did he have an adequate word? “is unsanitary, Sherlock. You can’t keep this in with your food.”
Sherlock’s hungry noise drew John’s gaze without him thinking. Their eyes met, and John saw him shudder, gasp, and finish. He’d meant to give Sherlock some privacy in that moment.
Sholto’s voice was urgent now. “Have- Watson, have you been assaulted? Have you sought medical treatment?”
John felt her fingers tug again as she sucked hard on his neck, increasing the pace of her bouncing.
The subsequent row in the shop changing room had been loud and public, all originating from Sherlock’s exasperation with John for thinking the linen shirt would be acceptable.
Sherlock made an uncommitted sound at the outfit presented. It was only a marginal improvement, but apparently John was intractable in his wantonness.
Sherlock considered, but no. John always got surly when he was secretly drugged. A direct approach would be better. Feel less violating, in the long run.
John turned back to see the offender on the screen. “I warned you it was shit telly before I put it on, don’t get too invested.”
It had been some months since Sherlock first touched himself to the thought of the Woman. And John. The three of them together. Several months of exploring his fantasies and his body. Allowing his desire for them to percolate. But in recent weeks he found he needed more. His mind’s eye took him as far as it could, it seemed, and perhaps impulsively, he decided to take the plunge.
“Dr. Watson isn’t a guest, Lestrade, he’s an experienced medical opinion and I need his input. You’ve saddled me with the likes of Anderson, what else was I supposed to do?”
aware that Sherlock’s sexual interests extended anywhere beyond the woman before him. But he knew Sherlock possessed some form of sexuality and explaining the specifics would be challenging. A demonstration would be perfectly effective. He had never known John to respond poorly to a beautiful woman, and so long as Sherlock refrained from directly participating, John’s physical response shouldn’t be inhibited. Which was more than enough to be getting on with for the time being.
“Harmlessly. My brother is not interested in biological matters. I assure you, Captain Watson remains fully unattached. You are free to ask him yourself. Or my brother for that matter.”
She leaned back to look at Sherlock, and John found himself coming up short as he followed her gaze.
Sherlock dismissed that. “John, you have survived battle, yes? Do you think a crime scene crawling with police on a Sunday afternoon in London is likely to be too taxing for you?”
I know the case was weak, but I have reasons for saving a study in pink. Also, my complete lack of planning for the chapter titles is starting to catch up with me. I think I'll have to go back and redo them.
With no sign of incoming intervention from Sherlock, John tried fruitlessly to knock Irene's hand away. "Stop it. Seriously, Sherlock, get her off me. I'm done contributing to your foreplay. Say something."
But Miller cut him off, shaking her head. “No, I agree with Winifred. The precedent is not acceptable, and I will not support a resolution of this council that results in Ms. Watson regaining her claim. Frankly, I do not see that she is a better choice. And at least Trevor wants him and intends to bond him.”
The blurred heat was growing, John’s scent was intoxicating, and the omega was meeting his pace with gorgeous ferocity. This was skidding past his planned limits of the night, and Sebastian’s considered restraint was slipping. He sacrificed one arm to support more of his weight so he could lift off John’s pelvis (lips never leaving that dangerously talented mouth) while the other hand made the dive for John’s trousers. He got John’s cock free with practiced speed and the omega pulled back with a gasp that could mean either thrill or alarm. John’s eyes flashed open and his hands quickly left their places at Sebastian’s back. One flew to stop Sebastian from pushing John’s pants and trousers completely off his hips, while the other struggled at Sebastian’s fly. Sebastian understood and redirected his hand to free his own aching prick.
James gritted his teeth. “The government is already involved. If current policy did not allow his fate to be so easily manipulated, I do not imagine there would be a mess to begin with. The omega in question applied himself to a rigorous field of study and dedicated his talents to Queen and country with distinction. Meanwhile our laws have blindly embowered unemployed addicts to run his life amok simply because they are alphas. It saddens me greatly to know there are those who would defer to their biology over his accomplishments, but I didn’t come here to debate politics.”
“John, I am going to be completely straight with you. I don’t know of any mechanism to prevent an alpha from withdrawing their omega. But I promise you, I will do everything in my power to keep you enlisted.”
Suddenly John felt quite self-conscious of his sartorial choices for the day, under the look Sherlock was giving him. It was not ideal given his body’s current response.
John quickly zigzagged his way through the now familiar wind of corridors and cubicles. It had been the mature thing to do, stop the escalation before he had a proper excuse to strike back. He was walking past a glass walled conference room when a hand touched his elbow. He turned, stupidly expecting Anthea, but it was the strange alpha again, who was now pressing him against the glass, nosing at his neck. “You didn’t even give me your name. Bad way to play hard to get.”
“My name is Victor. Don’t you remember Harry introducing me at the pub last night, John? You’re here, in my flat, because your sister was in a spot of trouble. But don’t get upset, you’ve gone and mopped up her mess. She owed me quite a lot of money, but mentioned she was the legal alpha of an unbonded omega and aren’t you just the tastiest thing?”
As for his new Alpha, things continued in the same distant manner. Mycroft seemed partial to a shared breakfast over other meals, and morning was the only time John regularly saw him. His alpha seemed to have a ‘many hands make labors light’ stance toward those in his court, and John was now a member. He received occasional phone contact from Mycroft or his main assistant, Anthea, (famously of his phone’s contact list), with instructions or errands. Anthea also had a habit of coming up behind John in public and plucking his elbow to get his attention before collecting him from the location. Again, he had a perfectly good phone, but her presence apparently better ensured speedy compliance, over a suggestion. The bulk of John’s errands involved coming to an office so Mycroft could introduce an alpha. But other than that, John was as free as he’d been with Harry. He relished the disinterest, knowing it wouldn’t likely be shared by his future mate. And it was well into his stay before Mycroft commissioned his medical expertise.
“That is a very prudent idea, Major Sholto.” Holmes intoned. “It would be a shame, if not a waste for this fate to befall an individual of Watson’s caliber, and for reasons so outside his control. Excellent grades at university, top of his class in medical school, frequent and earned commendations in his military career. I am familiar with Victor Trevor. Old money and a selfish disposition, he would reduce the captain’s life to one of nothing but frivolities, stifling his promise. I doubt Trevor would even allow the man locum work as a physician. To have one unstable figure as the captain’s legal representative was a wrinkle of genetics. To be sold to another is a misfortune within our capabilities to rectify. I seem to recall a clause in the omega ownership doctrine about greater societal responsibility and benefit which certainly applies here.”
John found his presumed patient pouting on the couch, cradling a badly cut forearm in a stained flannel. Must have been told a doctor was coming, he didn’t look distressed. John glanced around. Nice place, bit messy. As for the patient, late twenties or early thirties, pale, curly black hair, sharp features, alpha. John wondered if this was an audition with one of Mycroft’s candidates. If it was, the man didn’t look keen. Good. That meant John was excused from any weak attempts to be a respectable show dog and could focus on patching him up. The man’s glare made John doubtful he’d even agree to let the injury be treated, but that was fine. John could handle unruly patients.
Mycroft continued. “I am glad. And with you now here, I would like to review my plans regarding your future. I have assembled a sizable list of potential suitors for you-” John nearly choked on his apple turnover at that. Mycroft had been his alpha for less than a day, how many suitors could he have possibly found? “-and I would like to introduce these, let us call them candidates, to you very casually. As the situation is in flux, I don’t want you getting attached to anyone before things are settled. These introductions will simply give them a chance to see and smell you properly but will be no more cumbersome than that. I would advise you always try to make a good impression, they could be your future bondmate, but thankfully you aren’t the sort who needs such a reminder.”
“No, but you going around wearing those ridiculous trousers is one. And that shirt. You know what you are doing.”
John was wearing those jeans again. The flattering ones. And he never could be bothered to wear a coat long enough to cover his whole form. Sherlock pulled his own coat around himself tighter, annoyed. Why did John do these things in front of him? He had no intent of attracting Sherlock, his dating history had made that clear.
“Yeah I figured as much. He hardly seems like one for charity work. But I don’t begrudge him that. Moran doesn’t have many demands, and at least he’s not terrible like Victor, so I’m grateful to Mycroft. I even get to keep my full pension. Can keep Harry in her flat in town because of that.”
Sherlock cleared his throat. "Yes.” John waited for more. “I had a dilemma, and I elected to use Ms. Adler’s expertise to resolve it.”
It was late that night when John was finally free of the restraints, and Victor was still out cold. John ached and hadn’t eaten in nearly 24 hours so felt no guilt gorging himself on what food he could find and pocketing some money as well. He trusted the trust fund could bear the blow. After all, this was just Victor providing for him just like a proper alpha should. John laughed aloud at the idea. The fucker. His own money, and everything else important was in the safe, and though he’d ransacked the apartment for a code there’d been nothing. Victor’s phone and computer were password protected as well, and John’s highest priority was researching the withdrawal request. Which meant he needed to be well out of this place come daylight.
Sherlock lurked moodily, refusing to reply. Mycroft chewed on his annoyance. “And if you are referring to the transfer, yes, I successfully found John a suitable alpha. As I know he already told you.”
John let out a short humorless laugh. Irene's manicured hands were now unbuttoning his shirt, and his efforts to buck her off were not working. “Right. Well if Sherlock feels that way, he’s welcome to say so himself. Get off me. Now.”
So, his future oddly relegated, John did the things he had planned when he originally scheduled his leave, got things set up for his next few months working at the military medical center in London, and eventually visited a post office to ship the borrowed supplies and money back to Victor, restocked as needed. He didn’t want to be in his debt. The one bad night was becoming a memory and John was happy to put it, and his souvenirs in the past. He kept the razor blade though, as he’d grown attached. It had saved him, after all, before any of the rest had, and like him, it deserved a better life than that as Victor Trevor’s tool. He would have hung it with his dog tags if it didn’t risk cutting his chest. Instead it found a home in his wallet, and John was content with that.
Sherlock had long legs and John hadn’t quite caught up by the time he was at the scene perimeter. The rude officer from earlier caught John’s arm as he tried to pass her. “How do you know Sherlock Holmes?”
“Is you, yes. I have a very demanding work life, as do you. I appreciate the prospect of being with someone who could relate to my field and wouldn’t mind frequent, sometimes long separations. If you are interested, I think this could work. I would want to take things slow, but yes, that is my intent.”
The summit, as James Sholto had come to think of it, was boiling down to a face-off between too many stuffed shirts vs a small handful of military officers. Following his petition, it was decided that the ultimate outcome would be deferred to this council. The whole thing had been thrown together with top speed, but he thought the dossier his team had put together was compelling. Representing John’s interests in person, aside from James, were only those few who could be spared on such short notice. It meant his three co-representatives were not fully prepped for the battering that was about to unfold. James told them to just look like they agreed with anything he said and not speak unless he directed them to.
“These standards are a new, based on your dating history and I can’t be expected to keep track of your fickle tastes. Blaming me for your arbitrary reactions to essentially the same activity you prioritize every other day is exhausting, John.”
John got out a mumbled, “Sorry mate,” as he tried to orient himself. The footsteps belonged to an alpha, posh, like the flat, with light blond hair and John didn’t recognize him. Must be a friend of a friend. “Thanks’ for letting me crash, I’ll be getting out of your hair now,” John said, voice still a little slurred with sleep as he made to sit up. God, he felt terrible. Like he was moving through syrup and sore as hell. Well he had slept on a hard, stone floor. It took him longer than it should have to realize his limbs were restrained.
Being forced to watch the two of them shag in his own living room sounded nothing short of hellish, actually; but he was certain Sherlock wouldn’t let it come to that.
John was curious to see the space where Victor should have signed giving him to Mycroft. He had wondered if it would be blank, but all it bore was a very official looking government stamp, similar to the one next to Harry’s name when she’d been next alpha of kin. Idiots romanticized the legality.
“Fuck. I mean call your CO, obviously, but as far as people with pull, I don’t know. I’ll need to think.”
Consulting the Woman was essential. There was strong evidence she already knew what he wanted, (she once offered to give him John for Christmas) but he needed to confirm that she was still interested and would participate on his terms.
However, that was still hours away and John couldn’t chance sleep, so he made a pot of the overpriced coffee in the cabinet and quietly killed time. He took a hot shower, tried to ignore the hickies on his neck, and cleaned Victor’s cum off his clothes, as best he could. That left him feeling more normal. Then John collected supplies, planed his contacts, and penned a letter to his new alpha.
“Moran is many orders of magnitude better than the scoundrel John would have been trapped with if not for my intervention. Moran was chosen from a sizeable list of competitive candidates, I assure you.”
John gave a wry smile. “That’s beyond the scope of this interview, I’m afraid.” John wasn’t cross, just opportunistic. “I’m not certainly not spilling, when I didn’t get to hear how you got your cut.”
John was properly baffled by that, and almost forgot his frustration in the process. He looked down at himself. “What’s wrong with these clothes? Just because I don’t want to risk ruining suits when we run around back alleys doesn’t make them ridiculous.” He looked back at Sherlock, pure innocence (and very mild hurt) written in his face.
Watson gave him an appraising look before deciding on an honest answer. “In a perfect world, I would continue the career I have and there would be no alpha to control me. We don’t live in a perfect world.”
Irene rose. “Noted, love. Now, you must let me finish. As I said, Sherlock and I have some business that we will be taking care of today, and I would like to clarify your role.” She walked toward him, “Clear communication is rather vital to keeping the stress out of these situations. That way we can all have a marvelous time.”
Clara was lovely, as always, promising to ask around after Harry at their regular digs, and saying she’d give him an update. He’d always liked Clara so much. Why couldn’t Harry pull her head out of her arse for someone like this?
Sherlock paused and gave a slight nod. “A good observation, John. Likely a tattoo affiliating him with the gangster who sent his killers. Though not to protect his identity. The tattoo was removed to mark his break with the mob, and his killers were sent to punish him for trying to walk away. That also explains them forcing him to undress and come into the shower. They wanted to see the proof of his treachery.” He turned to the DI. “Lestrade, please note it is possible to find capable people, and stop your weak defenses of Anderson’s idiocy.”
Deep inhale, slow exhale. “Sir, have you ever heard of a withdrawal filing being overturned, by an omega, or by a review board of some kind?”
My earliest idea of this story was just a one off of this scene, where it was Sherlock who had John's papers, and Sholto was debating Mycroft to try to free John. But then I realized I could use Victor, because I love Sherlock and wanted him to be a good guy, which kicked everything into a bigger arc. Once that was decided, it made more sense to pull back Mycroft's role (gotta give the man a sense of drama) and provide other characters to fight it out with Sholto. Hope this wasn't too annoying.
But his violent need to punch something was stifled by the realization that he was still tied to the godforsaken chair. His eyes narrowed darkly. “Are you afraid to untie me?”
God give him patience. “As my memo detailed, Victor Trevor is not Captain Watson’s bondmate, nor was he his legal Alpha until a week ago, when Captain Watson’s sister, and former legal alpha, Harriet Watson, signed him over. Trevor filed for Watson’s withdrawal later that same day, which also happened to be the first time he ever met the captain. Persuasion would have been difficult, I imagine, under such a timeframe.”
When he returned, hands washed and needed materials collected, the man’s face was possibly more severe. “How did you know all that, if he hasn’t mentioned anything?” John asked, sitting on the coffee table. He angled the man’s arm over the bowl, pulled on his gloves and began irrigating the wound.
I felt the first chapter got a little bogged in exposition at times, so hopefully this one starts things rolling more. And Bill Murray will never let you down.
“Yes, Ms. Miller, that is correct. I, along with a number of my ranking colleagues, petitioned for the filing to be suspended.”
She knelt before him, smiling irreverently as she began to stroke his thigh and John gave her up as a lost cause.
John scowled at him. “If I tell you, will you drop this, please?” Sherlock nodded. The information was oddly pressing to him. John sighed and looked anywhere but Sherlock as he went on, “It’s just another responsibility, and I don’t shirk my obligations. I wouldn’t say I want to write up charts either, but I still do them properly. Same with pulling Harry out of pubs at 2:00 in the morning. This is just one of my alpha duties. It has to get done either way and if he’s not going to be vicious, I’m not going to make it a fight. Then it can even feel nice.”
The next day, John wore a plain grey jumper over a high collared white button down, and black jeans (because he couldn’t figure out what was so unseemly about the regular ones but was trying to be sensitive). Talking could make it hard for Sherlock to do the work, so it wasn’t exactly shocking that clothes could disrupt him as well. But now he had no flashy colors, no immodest collar bones showing.
Mycroft remembered the fleeting kindness he had considered, to give John to his brother, but no. While the pair had gotten on oddly well, Mycroft had needed something extra to recruit the sniper to the Secret Intelligence Service, and Moran was an excellent choice of bondmate. A former military man himself, Moran was very inclined toward John’s continued career, and Mycroft’s detailed background checks raised no flags for mistreatment. The alpha was also physically acceptable, welt built, with auburn hair, and grey eyes; the desire shouldn’t be difficult for John to muster. Moran was unbonded, dangerously capable, and other factions had been looking to add him to their ranks, but Mycroft swept in with the perfect offer to entice him. He would be an invaluable addition to the SIS, and with the track laid, Mycroft might be able to recruit John down the line as well, when it was truly time for his retirement from the army.
“Sounds like you’re in a good position to have a long, successful career, Captain. It frustrates me to think you might have been prevented from pursuing it.”
He wrapped things up with Bill, who would pick him up later in the day. John decided to give himself the next three hours to research before calling Major Sholto. He’d prefer to come to the Major with a plan, not a problem, but by the end of his time limit he’d knew he’d failed that goal. He could barely stand to picture what the Major would think of him after this.
“Me. If you want to wear this,” Sherlock gestured roughly at John’s attire, “on dates, fine. But you have no cause to do so in front of me.”
“I haven’t, but that doesn’t mean he won’t ask, which is fine. It was informative to learn the weight of Holmes’s pull. I don’t mind telling you we were in some hot water before he made his opinion clear. The rest fell in line after that. So, keep your wits about you with him.”
As he came down, John kept his eyes closed. He focused on his breathing. His adrenaline was going to kick back in soon and he needed to think, now that his head was finally clear.
Sebastian grunted his assent, pressed back into John’s mouth, and put both hands on John’s arse and thighs, hoisting him up to carry him there. He was limiting himself to kissing for the night but wasn’t giving up valuable momentum by stopping when he could avoid it. If the move startled John, the man took it in stride, bearing his weight on Sebastian’s shoulders and hips while his tongue lavished the alpha’s mouth.
They talked at length and were wrapping things up when John said, “And sir? I truly mean it. Thank you. Things would have been a bit bleak without your help, and this outcome is more than I could’ve hoped for. I don’t know how I’ll every repay what you’ve done for me.”
A picky omega was one thing, and at least this one had the qualifications to warrant it but Mycroft felt that abstaining from a bond entirely was untenable for the solider. It occurred to him that Sherlock would be an ideal solution. His brother had no interest whatsoever in omegas or sex of any kind. They could couple for one heat to form the bond, and after would be free to go their separate ways. Watson could serve to his heart’s content on his dosage of military suppressants while Sherlock’s discretionary fund could grow steadily off the military pension. The captain would be thrilled.
Parker looked outraged. “And if the omega was forcibly bought out from Trevor? What would happen to Watson then? He cannot be left to his own devices. Or are you so radical as to suggest he be completely emancipated, unbonded as he is?”
May as well get this started. “Thank you all for joining us,” he began, and the tense room quieted at once. James knew his deep voice carried and was helpful in commanding an audience. He’d need that today, dealing with the massive egos in this room. “As I believe you’ve all been briefed, we are here to find a resolution to the matter of John Watson, a Royal Army Medical Corps captain under my command, and the attempted withdrawal request made on his behalf.”
A man called Gordon scoffed. “This whole drama is why we should have kept omegas out of the military in the first place. All this fuss for-”
John huffed a laugh. “He’s currently hunting for his replacement. Seems like a perfectionist, though, I doubt it will a terrible option.”
“No, I wouldn’t want him to be my alpha,” John said with undisguised vehemence. “Though I did like the independence.”
“No, of course.” The Major looked moderately embarrassed by the idea. “Though I think using an alpha of Watson’s acquaintance would be sensible. Nevertheless, I would be satisfied with any honorable executor of this summit’s decision. I certainly do not insist it be me, only someone with his interests in mind.”
“Indeed, John. Why does this host not notice the clear markers of shared linage? The shoes alone could tell you they are half-sisters, whatever the mother says.”
“No, luckily Mr. Elliot is not on my list, so I will excuse your lapse of composure. Now, if you will follow me, I would like to introduce Erica Valencia.”
Yes, he probably did harbor something of a flame for John, but he gave himself permission not to be guilt ridden over it. If it had helped him persuade Mycroft, and thus the summit, to get John out of his bind then he couldn’t pretend to think it was a bad thing.
“I thought this was your place of work, Anderson, little pride though you can take in such. Try to be a professional and put in a minimum effort before stating inaccuracies. This murder was committed by a team of professional killers, not a short-tempered economist. Also, quit ogling John, he’s assessing the level of your incompetence and doesn’t need distractions.”
“Indeed. I never thought Mycroft would take an omega, and I wouldn’t have imagined him sending you about, doing his bidding like the other henchmen. He is very lazy though, and you would have been convenient.”
“Absolutely thrilled to learn you’re both exhibitionists,” John said lightly, “but I think you can find someone else to be your audience. Glad to be considered, and all that, but it’s not how I’d like to spend my afternoon.” This had to be an experiment (to test how irritated they could make him or some such). If they were serious about this, then just knowing he had been nominated to be their voyeur was more detail than John ever wanted. Either way, he hadn’t volunteered.
“Also, you’ll want to be careful, John, living in that house. You look fit enough, but letting Mycroft dictate your diet will put an end to that quickly.”
V-necks were common club attire as they did nothing to stifle one’s scent. They also made John look like a right prat, in his own opinion. The damn things might look flattering on people like Sherlock, but he also wouldn’t have to answer for the flock of omegas throwing themselves at him all night. John’s limited experience with the garment had only ever ended in one-sided heavy petting followed by violence. He sported a crewneck instead, paired with his highest collared coat. Even so, John received attention, and just for good measure, veritable bucket loads of pheromones tossed on him by alphas drunk enough to think that was a smart idea.
Also, I am unduly proud to tell you that London Container Terminal ltd is a real company located in the Port of Tilbury. #nonsponsored #johnneedsahug #iknowao3doesn'tusehashtags #thisiswhatyougetforreadingthenotes
“Yes, sir, I am. But I- I’m in a bad situation sir, and I am reaching out to see if I have any recourse, or options that my research didn’t turn up. Sir, do you know of a way to stop a withdrawal request from going through? When an alpha submits one for their omega?”
John placed his hand on the back of Sebastian’s neck, and pulled him in for the kiss. He closed his eyes as their lips touched.
However, he found the presence of what could only be Sebastian Moran’s scent to be far more unwelcome still. Along with the marks on John’s neck. Sherlock felt something prickle him mentally. Together they walked toward the Port of Tilbury to follow up on the lead from the club and John did not appear injured or sore as he moved. It was possible from this evidence that Moran had only marked territory. Not that he’d forced John to mate to show his claim. Or as a punishment. The prickle sharpened.
Over the first few weeks of living together, John learned that Sebastian wasn’t too controlling. They'd settled on John switching to pill suppressants, because John would never consider going completely off them, but could agree to have a heat every few months at a scheduled time. And as for his free time, it helped that Sebastian would leave for business every few days. He did want to be kept informed of John’s activities, which irked slightly. He also wanted to share meals with John when possible. Doable. And though John still slept in the guest room alone, Sebastian liked affections: putting his hand on the small of John’s back, touching John’s hand or knee, leaning in to whisper when not necessary, inhaling deeply as he did. That was fine. It was somewhat commendable, really. The eye-fucking and blatant lip licking that had begun during their first lunch made John wonder if the man had the restraint. But the behavior was not inappropriate given the circumstances and it was downright gentlemanly compared to some.
Mycroft debated denying it, but it was better to head off his brother’s curiosity. “He is taking a post with the SIS. He had competitive offers from other global agencies, and his skill set is very valuable. I will be able to keep a close eye on him, and John, and your nation will retain a very skillful asset.” Mycroft thought the entire endeavor had been so successful, he was considering setting up an off the books omega exchange system. John, after all, could hardly be the only one in such a predicament. He’d drafted a little piece of legislation that wouldn’t ruffle feathers but could give him an elegant legal loop hole to go ahead with such a thing, just in case.
John was baffled by that. “How do you work that out? We didn’t even know each other. I didn’t even know Mycroft back then.”
John breathed, realizing what was about to happen. This was inevitable. Overdue. The fair deal he had agreed to. Sebastian had been clear and kept his word, so John would do the same. Fulfill his role as partner, not some fuck-toy to pity.
John’s temper spiked. “Yeah, Sherlock, I know that. And that’s a damn sight better than the way other alphas react to me. At least he just gets off, rather than violently or psychotically trying to put me in my place beforehand.”
“I am open to the suggestions of this council. But I think between all the minds in this room, some solution could be found that would be agreeable.”
That appeared to arm Parker with a new line of attack. “Hmm, yes, and quite a desirable location that residence is in. You have attempted to portray Watson as a victim, but Trevor is more than financially secure, from the information you have provided, and has no criminal record, only recreational indiscretions. The captain sounds like he is facing nothing more dangerous than a comfortable retirement. Some would call that lucky. Aren’t most omegas hoping to lure a wealthy alpha to bond with them?”
“Sherlock Holmes, and I’m surprised Mycroft didn’t demand more pomp and circumstance for our introduction, if you’ll be joining the family. It was a mistake, by the way, for you to select my meddling elder brother after successfully avoiding a bond for so long.”
“Right, Sherlock, I’ve been trying to respect your sensibilities, but it’s too hot for it today.” He pulled the navy jumper off, which had the unintended consequence of mussing his hair and causing his shirt to briefly ride high. Sherlock could momentarily see the top of his hips, and the bottom of his flat stomach. The trail of hair. He scowled furiously at John for what was tantamount to a burlesque show.
Lestrade hesitated only a moment before taking it with an exasperated, “Greg Lestrade. And Detective Inspector, not that you’d know from the way this one acts. Right, come on then, let’s keep this quick.”
John hated when alphas called him that. He didn’t know why they did it, but hypothesized they were only programed to dish six rote phrases. John was many things and he didn’t think pretty was one of them.
The alpha still looked too pleased with himself. “Don’t answer so fast. I’m a powerful person, and I could show you a good time.”
Sherlock simply maintained his maddening silence, so John (stupidly) continued giving him the benefit of the doubt. “Cheers for that, but I doubt this was a team decision.”
“Mycroft’s been courteous. I think I’ll get on here fine, though I hope you haven’t agreed to any favors for him on my behalf, sir.”
“Like I would ever volunteer to be under your thumb.” And with that, Sherlock spun on his heal and strode out of the office, leaving Mycroft no time for a parting shot.
“Sherlock,” John said, ignoring Anderson entirely. “I think you should look at this. He’s had something identifying taken off his inner arm, maybe a tattoo, and its healed over. It must have been on purpose, the lines are too clean, and removing this much skin would have called for grafts, but he clearly hasn’t had any.”
“For our first session, you will not be allowed to speak for the duration. Only when I direct you, may you look at John’s face, touch John’s body, or touch yourself. If I give you any command, you will follow it. If you disobey these rules, or any order I give you, I will stop touching John and leave. If I do cross a line with John, you are to say my name once, and I will relent.”
She smiled, “Who knew you could be such a flatterer, Sherlock. But if John is like to ‘fuss’ as you put it, will restraints be necessary?”
John let out a short laugh, “Are you accusing me of being inappropriate? For wearing a crewneck top?”
“Harry, it’s John.” He was proud for not shouting ‘how could you do this,’ though he badly wanted to.
John smiled at that. Though he thought the police didn’t consult amateurs, Sherlock hardly seemed like one. He finished with disinfectant and bandaging. With the regained freedom of movement Sherlock snatched his phone up close to his face and began typing rapidly. It forcibly reminded John of Victor and he tried to shake the unpleasant memory while he repacked his kit.
Watching John orgasm was damn sexy on its own and it could have finished Sebastian if he weren’t already spent. He’d have to make John come first next time. He released John’s wrists and leveraged his body off the other, wedging himself in the space between John and the back of the couch. He brought a hand to rest on John’s other side, ensuring he didn’t get pushed onto the floor.
“I’m glad he has kept you abreast of the situation. Yes, Colonel Moran is very supportive, it should be a successful match.”
On the street John relished the cool early morning air. He wandered for a bit before coming across a wayfinding sign, which told him he was klicks away from Harry or Bill’s apartments. It also showed a nearby library, which would serve him fine.
“And why is that bad? I spent years in the army with no privacy whatsoever and I’m not ashamed of anything. You’re the one with the problem, so deal with it. I’m keeping this on for the day, and after, I’m wearing whatever the hell I like. You’ll just have to cope.”
“I did tell you of Captain Watson’s willfulness. He is not a submissive omega. I was under the impression that you found such characteristics attractive.”
“And what does your good doctor think about this? Or are you still working on a strategy to ring out every straight impulse from his fine form?”
Sherlock spit out a derisive sound. “Until he decides his own legacy is more important and forces John to retire and have his brats.”
Mycroft looked up from his desk to find his younger brother skulking around the shadowed corners of his home office. How was he always so quiet? “Do come in Sherlock. As always, a pleasure to see you. I thought you were meeting John at a crime scene. Rude of you to stand him up.”
The leftovers were tasty and shouldn’t be wasted. John finished them himself and then caved, grabbing supplies from under the sink and set about exerting his will for cleanliness on the rest of the flat since the fridge was off limits.
John’s stomach twisted, and he dropped his head in disbelief. He saw the woman’s green robe pooled at his feet and his stomach fell another inch (he would have to get rid of that). He noticed the knife in Sherlock’s hand, surely to cut him free. His eyes finally landed back on the impossibly calm face above him.
“Seriously, what part of this is bad?” John pressed, plucking at his shirt. “And who exactly am I disturbing with it?”
This ruffled the elder Holmes. “Then why are you here?” John doubted anyone got the drop on Mycroft regularly and was entertained to see that Sherlock had managed it.
“I do not suggest we rush any decision making.” James pretended to heave a sigh. “But failing to find a path towards stability for the captain among our current choices, perhaps an intermediary alpha could be found. Someone other than his sister to hold Watson’s paperwork while a permanent alpha is sought. A temporary guardian, to get him out from Trevor’s control while we decide the next step.”
“Right, I think you’re confused. This is an office building, not a club. So please keep your hands to yourself.” He said it evenly and pulled his arm from the other’s grasp.
“I’m not faking it. I’m genuinely confused. I really don’t know how I could dress any more- I don’t even know, plainly? How am I meant to dress, if not like this?”
“This is how I’ve always dressed in front of you. I’ve had this shirt since I was in the army. What’s wrong with it now? And Mrs. Hudson bought me the cologne, I’m not chucking it.”
“You know I am the reason this happened.” Sherlock paused, then softer, “You know that. You saw me.”
Also, If you've read my other fic, Attention, you will know I have a bad habit of putting John in crewnecks, though I did write this chapter before that story.
“But that would be tantamount to the army forgiving Harriet Watson of an irresponsibly accumulated debt,” the beta woman from earlier said, just as calm as before. “Surely you agree that would be a dangerous precedent to set.”
Lestrade stepped away to speak with a crime tech who had appeared on the landing, which gave John the chance to privately ask Sherlock, “Right, what medical advice I’m I meant to provide for this corpse then?”
Miller was first off the draw. “’Attempted’ being the operative word, as I understand it, Major Sholto. There was nothing wrong with the paperwork mister, ah,” the alpha flipped through her dossier for a moment, “Mr. Victor Trevor submitted for Captain Watson was there? It was due to your request that the withdrawal was held up?”
“Then explain this to me.” John’s adrenaline, reliably, was picking back up. “You’ve been authorized to speak again, so I suggest you do so.”
“I want to kiss you John, have wanted to since I first laid eyes on you. But I’m not angling for a headlock.”
“I am charged with John’s welfare, as we well know you are not. I do not know if I approve of you absconding with him.”
John hated the sound of that. “You won’t be able to lift them. They’re military grade, and I still have months before I need a new shot.”
That made Sebastian chuckle. “Mycroft didn’t whitewash your character when he described you, John. He described a fighter, and I liked what I heard.” He allowed himself to give John a look up and down that clearly said he liked what he saw too. “A quivering wallflower is not what turns me on.” He leaned in and lowered his voice. “I want someone who can keep up. That means a partner, not a trinket.”
“Of course.” John had to hold back from adding ‘sir,’ or speculating on the excess of posh in a family that opted for names like Mycroft. “John’s fine for me as well. And I’m happy to reimburse you for this, by the way,” he said tapping the phone.
His breath hitched involuntarily as her robe slipped from her shoulders, but his eyes never left hers. “Your preferences, or activities, are none of my business, Ms. Adler. The tolling of the cheekbones can commence for as long as you two like, I just don’t want to be here for it.”
That annoyed Sherlock too. John playing dumb. Or being dumb. Not knowing the affect he had on Sherlock. It had to be intentional.
“Oh, I’ll definitely want to keep you soldier, don’t fret about that.” He continued typing on his phone, filling out the information.
“No, I’d prefer he keep a clear head. And am quite satisfied to observe your considerable skill bring about his undoing.”
By the time he was done it was wasn’t quite yet dawn. John reviewed his supplies. They included the money, a pen and note pad, an itemized list of everything of his he could remember being in the safe, a piece of mail with Victor’s full name and address on it, which John had checked against the ID in Victor’s wallet, some granola bars and bottled water from the pantry, ibuprofen, disinfectant, replacement bandages for the ones currently covering his wrists and ankles, his very best friend, the razor blade, now cleaned, and a courier bag he found in the closet to carry everything.
John groaned as he woke up. No more pub crawls, they weren’t bloody worth it. He was still exhausted, and neither body nor mind wanted to embrace the day. How late was it? Could he justify a lie in? He cracked an eye. Not Harry’s flat, or Bill’s. Too nice. Must’ve slept in his clothes, on some private’s floor, then. Celebrating the first night of leave was often like this but it was a bit embarrassing he hadn’t made it home. Not that Harry would get too worked up. He was on the verge of realizing something when he heard footsteps.
“I think you will receive a call from a Miss Clara Hawthorn today informing you that your sister is alive and relatively well. Which I hope alleviates your worries.”
“Uh, I don’t really think of it in those terms,” John said, hands deep in his pockets. “What’s the shipping terminal we’re looking for called again? London Container or something equally unhelpful, yeah?”
“Don’t decide anything yet. Think on it, and in the meantime, can I book you for another date? It’s critical I learn your taste in steak and have a place in mind to test you.”
Now John was fully in sociologist mode. Which was a calmer state, set on getting to the bottom of Sherlock’s sideways logic.
“Not every straight impulse. I would rather like to watch him with you, to begin things.” She raised an eyebrow and he went on. “You did once say you would like to see me beg. Twice. This endeavor would provide you with many opportunities to do that and more. And I am given to understand, as you have no doubt surmised yourself, that John is remarkably clever with his tongue, should his generous endowments not pique your interest.”
James stifled an unhelpful sound of disgust. “That’s hardly a stereotype we can hope to see defied when the wishes of omegas like Watson are ignored. He greatly values his military career and is adamant in his desire not to ‘abandon his unit’ as he puts it.”
As they walked out the of front door, John chanced a glance back at Mycroft, who had fixed them with a penetrating look. Not a nice thing to be on the receiving end of, and John couldn’t gather what conclusion he’d come to.
“It’s how they got him into the shower. He is nude but has none of his bathing supplies. He was forced in here at gunpoint and was so focused on the gun, he probably didn’t see the knife. Three deep, confident cuts in quick succession from the other assailant would have surprised him before he had time to fight and were enough to make him bleed out while the gunman kept him from running.”
“Indeed John, and a perfectly sound analysis, though you’ve missed the crucial parts. There were two killers, one with a gun, and we certainly know none of the people living on this floor are guilty.”
Was that all? Silly John for getting upset. He nodded sarcastically. “Reasonable enough. You wanted to masturbate and needed some live entertainment.”
She addressed Sherlock, “When I close the door, you may speak.” As she walked past, she paused to kiss John, briefly. “Thanks for a lovely time, Dr. Watson. ‘til the next appointment, then.” And she was gone.
“I know, never thought I’d get such a good outcome. Seems impossible they’d let me dodge a life sentence with that sod. Still don’t really know how they managed it, but I’m not about push, if it means the ordeal was just a short and painful one off.”
John smiled as he rose to leave. “I’ll keep that in mind. The morning pastry routine is a bit much. Go easy with that arm. Keep it dry and change out the bandaging tomorrow.” He deposited disinfectant and a sealed package of gauze on the coffee table. At the door he turned. “It was nice meeting you Sherlock.”
Sherlock Holmes must be an idiot, whatever the boss said. He’d have to request something interesting as a thank you to the man for his utter failure to make a claim.
“I have considered it, he would excel there. But I may find another need for him one day, so I am leaving my options open. And don’t feel left out. You know my offer for your employ there always stands.
Sebastian sighed with mock reluctance. “I don’t know. I also get turned on by the idea of you roughing other alphas up, and you might not get the chance if I scent you. But I can be persuaded. If you ask nicely.”
Tamped down approval practically radiated off John, but physically he only gave a nod, and fell into silence, gazing at the scenery unseeing, but Sebastian thought it was going well. John was open to the match and Sebastian had to fight the impulse to press his advantage, to lock the other man down. Not that John had much say, given Mycroft wanted it to go through, but everything in his body wanted to win him over. He even considered telling John he could keep helping the Yard but couldn’t quite stomach that concession yet. He might allow it but wasn’t going to make any promises he couldn’t keep. Once they’d mated, he’d feel better about the situation with the brother.
Lestrade directed them to the shared shower room and explained, “These are the quarters for LSE’s international graduate students. And this,” he gestured to the prone figure on the tiled floor, “is our victim, twenty-five-year-old beta, Ramone Ricci, of New Jersey, according to the school’s records. Hang on a mo.”
“Mhm,” Sebastian replied vaguely as he nuzzled his face into John’s neck. “Next time I want to see you naked.”
“I don’t mind.” John dropped in, though he suspected his opinion didn’t matter. Sherlock however looked triumphant. “Excellent, there you go. We must be off.”
Finding the razor blade on Victor’s inert form ranked as one of the happiest discoveries of John’s life. Victor had used it to cut the drugs, and if he hadn’t been the source of misery to begin with, John could have kissed him for it. It took ages to work the razor into a usable place with John’s limited range of motion, but it wasn’t like he had any other options available. That spurred his pig-headed problem solving effectively.
Mycroft resisted the urge to bristle. This was classic alpha preening and he needn’t rise to it. Moran was an asset and his concerns needed to be diffused. “I understand you do not trust in my brother’s intentions, but if it offers you any comfort, the captain is remarkably capable of defending himself from unwanted advances. I have witnessed this myself, though not on the receiving end. Given his life of evading aggressive suitors, and his near entrapment by a practical vagabond, I do not believe my brother could have gained Watson’s assistance had there been anything untoward. Watson’s history shows it would have put the him completely off. I understand he merely enjoys having companionship free of overtures for once.”
Then Victor turned back to face him, movements disjointed, and grinned stupidly at John. He was high. That was great. Just perfect. Who wants the RAMC when you could have a motherfucking cokehead of your very own? John felt slightly hysterical. How had he let it come to this? He didn’t even know what Victor was loaded on and didn’t bother to ask. Victor stumbled over to him, eventually crawling, before tucking his face into the crook of John’s neck and inhaling deeply. (Tragically the angle didn’t give John any leverage to cause him pain).
When John initiated the kiss, firm and insistent, Sebastian could have ignited from the approval of it. His soldier didn’t back down from a challenge, and he would come up with ways to leverage that. John’s hands were at his neck and waist pulling him in, closer, and Sebastian sunk into the heat of his mouth, the heaven of his scent, the skill of his tongue, until he had John fully pinned to the door. His own hands began roving, groping, till one was in John’s hair and the other cupped his arse. He’d need to put the brakes on this eventually, but his body screamed in retaliation at the thought. It was John who eventually pulled back to gasp out the word. “Couch?”
John just shrugged, eyes still closed, breathing hard. “Spent most of my life shagging betas. Can’t let your scent do all the work with them.”
Victor just snorted. “I don’t care about your pension. What good is that if I can’t have you here when I want you? And it wouldn’t make a dent next to what my trust fund pays out. Congratulations, by the way, you just graduated to the ranks of the gainfully unemployed.”
John didn’t mask his venom. “How long am I to stay here then? Do you like seeing me half-naked and covered in dried cum as much as you do with your girlfriend on my lap? Am I just on retainer ‘til you want your next orgasm?”
“No, and I’ve been clean for years. She only knows about it because they like to spring drug busts on me if I annoy them too much.”
“John does not know the full scope of my desires. But I have always found him to be amenable to my plans. Your presence, while very welcome, is sure to be something of a sticking point initially, as will the concept of a
Mycroft exhaled his frustrations. This tantrum held strong echoes of Redbeard. “I know you find this affair distasteful, Sherlock, but I have never had the intention of doing wrong by John. I have no reason to think my selection would mistreat him, or I would not have made the offer. You will recall, the previous option was Victor Trevor and I believe John felt nearly any choice would be preferable to that.”
And that was apparently the end of that. John decided not to let himself get bothered over it. Well, much. He didn’t want a bondmate at all and had gone to some lengths in life to avoid one, but Harry had shoved him well past that option now. He’d already agreed to accept whoever Mycroft chose and everything he’d seen suggested his new alpha wouldn’t accept anything substandard, just as a matter of principle. Whoever Mycroft picked would be perfectly bearable, and that was as warm a position on the matter as John was like to reach.
“My, my, John. You’ve been driving alphas mad tonight, haven’t you?” Sebastian leered over him, nose brushing his hair as John stood with his back to the door. Not good for a retreat.
John chuckled, unable to help himself. “You’re right.” The wound was now clean, and John picked up the  lidocaine to numb it, looking at his patient in a new light. “That was amazing, by the way. All that you just worked out?”
“No, I couldn’t.” John filled Bill in on the events of the last day and a half. The information sobered him.
Still riding his cock, John felt her do that thing with her fingers again, and he knew it would be over soon.
“I saw how it affected you.” John corrected. “I never saw why you didn’t stop her when I asked you to. Why you wouldn’t speak to me. Being threatened seemed like the most reasonable explanation.”
John was present, conscious, and smartly outfitted in a suit of Mycroft’s choosing for the transfer, as these things were conventionally done. In keeping with similar, formal tradition, John would return with Mycroft that evening, and not move in with Sebastian until the end of the week. The practice arose from the time and threat of bayonet transfers and was considered a civil way of demonstrating that the affair was above board.
Their destination was a London School of Economics’ student housing complex in Butler’s Wharf, accurately decked with the police of Sherlock’s description. Any lingering apprehension John felt about the alpha’s intents dissipated, permanently. One of the officers, however, was not of the same mind as John.
“No sir, not- not exactly. At least I don’t think he did anything when I was unconscious. I was dressed when I woke up.” John didn’t want to leave an opening for the Major to ask about what had happened when he was conscious, so he pushed on. “The alpha said he was trying to find a way to lift my suppressants first. And in any case, I can’t file charges, against him, can I, sir?”
Irene cooed sympathetically and stroked John’s hair. “I think you’ve underestimated his appetite, John. Not that I can blame you. He’s difficult to read”
He looked at Sherlock skeptically but obeyed. He wasn’t the expert. “Cause of death was probably blood loss, based on the size of this pool, and those stab wounds aren’t superficial. It’s weird he doesn’t have defensive marks.” John took a knee to feel the neck and jaw of the body. “Rigor mortis has only just started to set in here, but not at the torso yet, so he’s only been dead a few hours.” He looked up at Sherlock, “How long does it take the police to get set up? He must have been found relatively soon after the attack.”
The chat was brief and unexceptional, but when he rang off, Mycroft pondered a moment over Sholto’s hesitation. Perhaps the Major was simply annoyed that he’d had no say in John’s alpha. Whatever the reason, Mycroft earmarked the memory in his mind palace. Just in case.
John arrived promptly at one of several impressive government buildings where he regularly met Mycroft. Behind him in the security queue, an alpha was talking loudly on his phone, and John was close enough to hear both sides of the conversation (a boon to national security this one is). John didn’t step forward though, lest he crowd the beta in front of him, and once through the machines, he joined the others flocking onto the lift.
“Believe me when I say I wouldn’t have cut a very impressive figure tied to his floor. Are you done dragging through this shit with my alphas now?”
“Mycroft is your brother?” It delighted John stupidly to know that Mycroft was an actual big brother as well a figurative one, and got sidetracked by the news. “That figures, it’s the only time he’s sent me on a house call.”
“No, I am the only one capable of what I do. I assist the police when they are out of their depth. Which is always.”
Sherlock did not enjoy scenting John. The purpose was to mark one’s territory, dissuade other alphas, but it left John smelling like Sherlock rather than himself. The notes of John’s own scent were very pleasant, and Sherlock did not relish stifling them.
Mycroft liked his brusque manner and felt the impure desire to forcibly master the boldness, but contained it. “Not crucial, though the details are needlessly tedious. Suffice it to say, the legal groundwork is solid, Mr. Trevor has been compensated, and I have your papers here.” He produced them and went on. “As for the Major, I am simply open to well-reasoned arguments. And he made a compelling case on your behalf.”
But it was for naught. He snapped when another grope was made of his arse and John kicked out the back of the alpha’s knee before folding him into a choke hold. Just as the stranger slipped from consciousness, John heard his own name. He carefully lowered the figure to the floor, and faced Mycroft, unabashed. He was glad he hadn’t punched the stranger though, or he would currently look like a Neanderthal.
When they left the morgue, he pointed the injustice out. “Why do I have to go around like a vicar when she’s allowed to wear that?”
“No, I just don’t need you putting this situation under a microscope. You are not an omega. No one will ever be able to turn your life upside down by signing a paper. So come off it. I won’t apologize to you or anyone else for holding up my end of an agreement and being glad things aren’t far worse than they could be.”
“Oi, food is necessary, quit tempting me to force feed you. But you don’t date or court at all, then?”
“Since our first case, when you said his name. I didn’t know he had you there by force when he asked for my help. He said his new omega had very strong suppressants that needed to be lifted. I merely saw it as a challenging piece of chemistry.”
“How long have you known it was the same Victor? No, sod that, you would have agreed to help that filth bond me?”
John felt ashamed to say it out loud. “My sister is, was, my legal alpha, and yesterday she signed my papers away.” He schooled himself. “The alpha she signed them over to filed to have me retire against my will, sir. I don’t want to abandon my unit, my career, like this. If there is any way, any appeal that I can submit, anything at all I can do, I will.”
John cut him off. “Look, I know you like to point out when the police are shagging each other, but can you not, please? I know what happened, no deductions needed. He didn’t go feral or anything, didn’t even want me to stop going on cases so it’s fine.”
Victor scooped the papers off John. “Submitted a copy to the registry’s office this morning. Should be getting my confirmation email any time now,” he wiggled his phone and strolled over to a safe in the corner, opening it for John to see. “Heard you have a bit of a behavior problem, which I like, but I’ve got your things right here, lover. If you want to be good, I’ll let you use them again.” He dropped John’s papers on the safe shelf. Below it, John could see his own rucksack and laptop. Victor closed the safe door with a thunk.
John’s smirk was unappreciated by Mycroft and Sherlock looked especially smug when he followed it up with, “I think I can stay out of trouble for a few hours. I’ll just get my coat then, shall I?” and slipped off before Mycroft could stop him. Mycroft might be worried that John was going to spoil his bondmate schemes, but John wouldn’t break his word, and wasn’t tempted to. He was just curious to see what this consulting detective did on a case. Besides Sherlock didn’t seem the type to hassle him.
“He’ll do. He’s what I’ve got. And we’re done with this conversation. Tell me what it is we’re looking for here, or I’m going home.”
“Sir, he-” John wanted to catch fire from the indignity of the words, “said he wanted me available, for him. I mentioned the pension when I asked him not to withdraw me, but he said he didn’t care about the money. I was restrained, sir, or I would have stopped him,” John felt the need to add. To explain himself for letting it come to this.
He was moderately outraged when Molly’s red scoop-neck top did not warrant an outburst from Sherlock.
Fuck. Fuck! How could she do this!? No- she’d promised- dammit, she had the alpha portion of his pay for debts, what the hell had she been thinking? John put his full strength against his restraints now, testing their hold on all four limbs. This was not good. The bindings were secure and anchored to the floor. John kept his voice level, but he was calculating, slowly, thanks to whatever they drugged him with, “How long are you planning to keep me like this?”
John shoved the man back. “Look, I said I wasn’t interested, and I’m not playing games.” John’s already insubstantial patience was wafer thin, and he was forming a fist, before invoking his new patron saint, Molly Hooper. He was sure she never threw fists to deal with alphas, and she’d managed just fine in life so far.
“Yes, and therein lies the misfortune. John, we can take our leave now.” He strode off with purpose and John had to hasten to follow him.
“Yeah, he’s next on my list. If anyone occurs to you, write their name down for me, or drop them a line. I want to do as much as possible to put the brakes on this thing today, and I’m not above begging strangers for help.”
Mycroft frowned. “You have plenty of resources at your disposal, there is no need for you to bother John.”
, while pulling at John’s coat ineffectively. He was more focused on sucking that divine neck for everything he was worth, but John managed to roll them, straddling Sebastian a moment while he sat up to divest himself of the coat before leaning back into the kiss. Sebastian smiled against John’s lips and flipped him back into position. He loved to see his omega eager, but John could be on top some other time. Tonight, Sebastian wanted to control when they were done.
“Indeed,” Parker cut in with a silky smile. “You make an impassioned case, Major Sholto, and we can all agree there are many sides to the matter of ownership laws, but it is definitively not your area.”
It wasn’t funny, but it made Sebastian laugh. He couldn’t picture John lying back and letting anyone or anything do all the work, not after tonight. “If I’d known going in, I would have asked for a kiss the first night.”
John felt himself harden further. “Sherlock isn’t doing anything because he is a prat running an experiment.”
The fondness crinkled over John’s face. “Ta for that. You’re the only one of them who does. But that’s life as an omega for you. I should have known I couldn’t put it off forever. At least this one pretended I had a choice. That’s better than loads of people get.”
Parker did not back down. “The nature of the transfer is simply salacious detail, and not pertinent to the withdrawal. I suspect it is being presented here in the worst possible light, as well.”
There was a pause on the other end. “No, if he has your papers, unfortunately I do not believe you can.”
That did seem to mollify the Colonel slightly, and Mycroft pressed on. “As you are positively inclined toward John’s appearance, perhaps we might discuss your courting him before the transfer.”
James nearly gagged as he finished the statement. The rush of alpha pheromones his comment had elicited from the room was staggering. The alphas’ scents clearly said they wanted to prove they were up to the challenge of this feisty, desirable omega. Weren’t these types supposed to like the delicate ones? And these people hadn’t even met John. Massive egos indeed, though perhaps he should have avoided phrases like ‘bed warming.’ Still, it gave him an idea.
“It is up to the omega to persuade his bondmate over career moves, not the government,” the red-faced man blustered.
“Not interested in that. My civilian work has been lucrative, and as I said, I’m planning to take an offer with the SIS very soon, which will also pay handsomely.”
“Then I’ll be glad to have my deployments. Better than being stuck with someone like that year-round.”
The gears of John’s brain were fighting any effort to move. Was it afternoon? How’d he been asleep that long? He frantically tried to recall how he’d gotten here but nothing after his check in with Harry and her friend midway through the bar crawl last night was coming up-
“He asked politely so I agreed, but I should have mentioned, we’re not a couple. He’s only my newest legal alpha. Hence the lack of pomp.”
The beta wilted slightly, but another filled the vacuum in his stead. “That is irrelevant, Major. The law clearly authorized his sister to act as she did, and Mr. Parker is right, his new alpha is financially capable of supporting him. If this Mr. Trevor fellow doesn’t want his omega employed, it is none of our concern. The circumstances may be messy, as you say, but the government shouldn’t be getting involved,” she concluded calmly.
They lay there together for a moment, feeling the mutual high ebb, before Sebastian finally panted, “Where the fuck’d you learn to snog like that?”
There was an unexpected pause from the other line. “Well, it is good to hear that he supports Watson’s career.”
The scents pouring over John were pleased, aroused, and a touch possessive but oddly not angry or feral. But John didn’t want to lower his guard. “Don’t alphas normally get worked up over this sort of thing?”
“A crime of passion from one of these academics would have been a struggle, but as you say there are no defensive wounds, not even tentative cuts to his chest, only these deep incisions. If they had lived here, once their adrenaline subsided, they would have panicked, used the shower to try to clean up, but there’s been no attempt made, not even to rinse the blood down the drains.”
She set down her tea delicately. “I have conditions, naturally. And rules. For the content of these sessions and your behavior during them.”
“I sometimes must fake it for a case, but no, the whole thing, sentiment, mating, and the like.” He waved a hand as if to dismiss the silly notions. “I don’t engage in such.”
“Must have been one of the other students. Tension from living in close quarters, and they attacked him while he was getting in the shower- Oh. Hello, there. I don’t think we’ve been introduced.” The crime tech was giving John an unnecessary looking over.
Bill was first, because the call was so much easier to face, and John knew he was itching for news. It had been Bill’s brilliant idea to place the tip that landed Victor in ‘rehab.’ Unfortunately, it wasn’t the proper kind, but one for rich assholes, which amounted to little better than a spa featuring only slightly fewer controlled drugs than Victor preferred. Still, it had gotten him out of the way beautifully for the week and a couple to follow as well.
“I have not encountered a case like this. The legal alpha is usually at liberty to make these sorts of requests, but I cannot imagine these circumstances would be considered usual. Did the alpha say why he was withdrawing you? He would receive a portion of your pension after all. Or did he file while you were unconscious?”
The stranger glowered a minute more but finally nodded and watched closely as John approached. He set down his kit and phone to inspect the wound.
Fuck, it was all over him. Standing at the sink, John tried to rinse off the scents, but the effect was negligible. They were in his clothes, his hair, his sodding pores, it felt like. He wondered if it would look worse that he’d even tried to wash them off. Like he was attempting to hide. He growled at that.
. If Sebastian was going to blame him that wasn’t his problem. John took a deep breath. There was a stupid thought. It was his problem. A feral alpha was going to be a peach to deal with, cut off from reason and driven to a rage by their hormones, and his was built like a bloody ox.
Irene chuckled softly as Sherlock cleared his throat and turned from the window, but he would not meet John’s eyes. Rather, Sherlock began removing his own suit jacket, which left John with the common feeling that he was too thick to discern why this sodding git had let things go so far. Sherlock couldn't possibly want what she was implying, and annoyingly, Irene’s antics were beginning to have the desired effect on John.
When Sherlock emerged from his room, John was in his usual armchair, reading the newspaper, in nothing but a vest and boxers. He did not acknowledge Sherlock’s ludicrous exclamations.
“Excellent. Then if there are no objections from the rest of this council,” Mycroft gave only the most cursory pause to let such air, knowing none would be forthcoming, “I think that can conclude this discussion. My office will be happy to clean up the loose ends. Oh, and I shall like to speak with you, Major, about arranging a meeting with the captain before I take over his paperwork.”
Charts are very important, and all doctors hate doing them. They are the notes doctors write for patient medical records and they are not the fun part of medicine. I have it on extremely good authority that they royally suck and take lots of time. I suspect John’s charts are beautiful and thorough, cause that is just how he copes with stuff he doesn’t want to do.
“There you go! That’s submitted. How shall we celebrate? I’ve got a few things here to get a good party started.”
A horrible thought occurred to John. “Oh god, please don’t tell me this was the alpha you wanted me to meet.”
He doubted that she fully saw but did not want to dampen her enthusiasm. Molly was his backup, but he knew that would be fraught. John may loathe the Woman, but he pitied Molly, which, quite aside from failing to stoke his ardor, would make him very cross with Sherlock.
Sherlock made another outraged remark which brought a chuckle from John as he packed away the leftovers. A moment later he nearly dropped them when he opened the fridge. He closed it again. Processing. And opened it once more.
The man was caught off guard. “Ah,” his eyes flicked to meet John’s and held there a moment, before darting away, “yes, I did. But that’s not what people normally say.”
Bill’s stupid cracks and gleeful relief were infectious and had John properly laughing by the time he finally told the man to bugger off. He immediately rung the Major, because, well, how do you go about telling a man you respect beyond measure that you are eternally grateful to him without letting things get unacceptably soppy? John certainly didn’t know and giving himself time to think about it wasn’t bound to help.
The man’s eyes widened at that, gleaning something other than John’s meaning from the words. What, John couldn’t reckon, so he pulled out supplies from his kit while the stranger elaborated. “He hasn’t told me anything. But you are a ranking military doctor, recently returned for leave, newly and somewhat closely affiliated with him.” A statement, not a question. The stranger’s eyes narrowed, as if doing so would bring John’s history into clearer focus. “You don’t work for Mycroft.”
The idea alone was making it hard for Sherlock to master his arousal. But he did need to clarify. “I will not be touching John during our first session. That would hinder his physiological response.”
“Basically. You know the classic set up. Most alphas want to come home to someone submissive. I can’t play act at that, never could or wanted to, which is naturally a turn off. But there’s a type of alpha who goes for pushback. Loves the idea they managed to pin down a challenge. Absolute gits, usually idiots.” He smirked at Sherlock, “Well, more than the average population, by your standards. Anyway, I draw ‘em like flies.”
“Baring abuse, what more is there?” Ultimately, they would own him, and for John, a cage was going to be a cage, no matter who held it. The next stage of his life was all about managing expectations. “They’re all going to want the same thing, give or take, and I care about my career.” He shrugged, taking another bite of kebab. “It’s not that I can’t be attracted to alphas, even if I don’t want a relationship with one. The kind I attract are tossers, though hopefully Mycroft’s choice won’t be my usual ‘type.’ The one before Mycroft, Victor, was a bastard, but only an extreme example of a common trend for me.”
Sebastian only took a moment to look at John when he dumped him on the couch, to take in the debauched state of him. Normally so unassumingly presentable, now with his hair and clothes disheveled, blood pounding, and lips wet, all because of him. All his. Sebastian dropped back over him and resumed his post, attacking his neck,
“Fucking hell John, you had me in a right state, slagging off from the pub crawl like that. Couldn’t have dropped a line yesterday morning, when I was nearly having heart failure over your dumb arse?”
“I don’t mind. I know you’re mine. And they should be aching for you, if they have any sense.” His voice rumbled, “I know I am.”
John just stared at him numbly. It could not be that easy. There was no possible way. All the years of study and training and work. The literal blood and sweat. There was no way it could be over. Over for nothing. It wasn’t. John simply refused. There was something he could do, he just needed to find out what it was. It must take time for the request to officially process and there had to be a work around. He would find it. It was called a ‘request’ for god’s sake, why call it that if there was no way to deny it? There would be something, he was sure. As he made up his mind, he realized peripherally that the alpha was doing something at the bar, but John really couldn’t give a flying fuck what it was.
Then John said they were not a together and had left Sherlock with other missing details besides. The omega was an interesting enough puzzle that he was still on Sherlock’s mind a few days later when Lestrade mentioned there would be no suitable assistance at the crime scene. But Sherlock now knew the location of a perfectly serviceable aid, with helpful medical knowledge and a high tolerance for violence and its aftermaths. He had made John laugh. The man might not be opposed to joining him. Just this once. And after Sherlock would be able to close the file on John Watson, a second pass being more than enough to collect the outstanding details that kept Sherlock temperately intrigued.
Sherlock had obediently circled them for some time, eyes raking every inch before being directed to sit. Now he was settled in his armchair, stroking himself ardently.
John didn’t know what’d he’d ever done to earn that kind of promise, but he was overwhelmed with gratitude all the same.
“Interesting you would so enjoy your military life if you don’t like being bossed around by alphas.”
“Right, that is usually a good way to go about things. Though if you, or ah, any of your assistants see her, could you let me know? She’s not usually this good at staying underground.”
John raised his eyebrows and she pressed on. “He’s not paid to be here you know. He does it for fun. Because he’s a psychopath.”
John responded singularly to Sherlock’s deductions. Appreciatively. Sincerely. A rare and pleasant occurrence. Sherlock could recognize the traces of deeper appeal there. He was unprepared to like any future in-law that would select Mycroft but quickly switched tact; omegas had few rights in this area, certainly it had been Mycroft that chose John. At his age, John must have put effort into remaining unbonded and would not have squandered it on the likes of Mycroft. His brother, meanwhile, was bound to demonstrate some taste on occasion.
“No, seriously, can you please just wait? You don’t even know me, you might not want to keep me, but I won’t be able to reenlist if you take me out!”
“The name is John, actually. And I volunteered. If you’ll excuse us, Sherlock’s been asked to consult here.” He marched past her under the police tape and Sherlock had to feign an air of expecting nothing less, while Donovan scowled in surprise. Sherlock sidled up to match John’s pace, and the latter whispered, “Thank god you didn’t stay to chat with her. I have no idea where I’m going.” That drew a smile from Sherlock, who thought his recruit was doing very nicely so far.
They were his omega rights. And on the middle of the page was a line with Harry’s signature next to what could only be Victor’s. John felt the groan escape him, more that he heard it. She couldn’t- she wouldn’t-
“No, that will not be necessary,” was all the response he got to that. John couldn’t think how to press the matter without being rude, so decided to let it go. He thumbed through the phone and saw that his contacts were already populated with ‘William Murray,’ ‘Harriet Watson,’ ‘Maj. James Sholto,’ ‘Mycroft,’ and someone called ‘Anthea.’ He couldn’t stop the chuckle as he muttered, “Airstrip One has Wi-Fi.” He didn’t see the small smile that won from Mycroft, who was typing on his own phone. John prepared for a quiet remainder of the ride, but it ended before he’d really had the chance.
“Is that your way of saying you want us to pressure the alpha into letting Watson serve?” Her tone was hard.
“Selected after you decided he would be the most helpful to you. What is Moran giving you, in exchange for his prize?”
John tapped open a new message from Sherlock as he waited for his floor to arrive, and nearly started when he felt the pressure on his arse. He didn’t want to cause a scene, so he shifted to dislodge the contact (not necessarily groping, the lift was crowded, he wouldn’t make assumptions), and gave a half look behind him hoping for an innocent cause. It was the sort of thing Bill would do if they were in the same place and John hadn’t noticed him, the lovable git, but no such luck. The alpha from the queue was behind him and his hand returned, more firmly, to its place on John. Right, sod this. John was plotting his retaliation when they arrived at Mycroft’s floor. He sighed. The prat wasn’t worth it, John needed to behave, and he shouldered past the lift’s other occupants. But the man followed him.
