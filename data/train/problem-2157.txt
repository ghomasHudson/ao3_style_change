“Beauty is, they say, in the eye of the beholder”, I said equably. “I have seen many relationships between men in my time, some of which would raise more than an eyebrow to outsiders. Yet what matters is not age or beauty, or for that matter a surfeit or absence of years and/or looks. What matters is love.”
“The people of Mousehole wish the bus service to be extended to them?” I asked. To my surprise he shook his head.
“I looked it up”, Master Bigglesworth said calmly. “His grandfather was German; they changed the family name from Holstein when he came to England. It had to be him.”
I caught my father's blush at that, and my mother taking his hand. Much as I loved them both, they really were a pair of saps!
Over one hundred and forty medals, more than fifty of them gold, marked the Olympic Games being held in London that summer. We had received an invitation but did not go; I found that I increasingly disliked crowds, preferring the quiet of our cottage. Or at least the quiet when Sherlock was not making me scream, that was! The knowing look that I got from the vicar one particular Sunday was frankly mortifying, especially when he mentioned how much he enjoyed 'the peace and quiet of walking in the countryside,
I was sure that I caught the station staff exchanging money as we left. I considered glaring at them but it would have taken too much effort.
We quickly reached the small cottage by the river. There was no road here, just a rather rickety-looking wooden bridge over the river to a path on the other side that almost immediately passed across the single-track line to Kirkcudbright. Mr. Creighton Dallas was out in his garden repairing a bench; he was a large brown-haired fellow, very solidly built unlike his wiry late brother. He stood up as we approached, regarding us warily as if preparing for battle.
The 'A' was topped with Sherlock's deer-stalker and had a pipe hanging out, while the 'L' had a red cross and a stethoscope wrapped around it. I pulled my love into my arms and held him as he cried tears of happiness. It was just possible that I may or may not have shed a tear myself (although of course mine were manly tears) and that I generously allowed Sherlock a lot of that manly embracing that he liked for much of the rest of that day. But then that was my job, to keep him as happy as he had been when he had seen that sampler.
“It is a Chevrolet AC”, Sherlock smiled. “The latest model and more efficient that our old one, which only your skilled hands have kept going till now.”
“Pray tell me about it”, I urged. After all this was John’s friend. I owed it to him to do what I could.
“I still love it when you pout!” he whispered as we walked to the end of the quiet street, to presumably find a cab.
“She passed last year”, I said. “They had a son, George, but he died when he was five. Scarlet fever.”
The young fellow reddened. I was reminded of his prodigious Westmorland cousin who also blushed very easily.
“Sandy has split loyalties”, Lord Fleet said, “being my employee and Charlotte’s cousin. But I made it clear that at times like these his place is with family, not business.”
Former president of the small but strategically important Republic of San Quentin, he made the mistake of insulting his very large, muscular bodyguard at exactly the wrong moment. Rodrigo knocked him out with a single punch, and the sudden and terrible hailstorm that broke seconds later left him in a quandary. Rodrigo sent his lady-friend to seek shelter then left his master's unconscious body up against the door of the nearby chapel, which he locked.
I had visited Edgeware on the Thursday, so on Friday I decided to play a hunch and make a call on the young Mr. David Cooper who lived in nearby Stanmore. If I was correct in what I thought was behind all this, then there was one way that I could be sure.
Mr. Cooper was pleased to see me although I did wonder whether this had anything to do with my arrival necessitating his removal from a Latin lesson. He was a pleasant enough young fellow although he was unfortunately passing through the phase that so many teenage boys experience when they think that a moustache makes them look older and more serious, and not like a caterpillar had crawled halfway across their upper lip and then died.....
We doubled back at Mark Lane as Lion had suggested and were soon heading towards Baker Street, both of us counting down the number of stops to go. We reached Euston Square when I saw Lion smile for possibly the first time that day.
But when he looked at me I hurried over anyway. I even left behind my nice new Milky Way chocolate bar because I loved him so much! That was true love!
“Jones is back with the regiment in Hereford now”, he said. “Wellington Barracks. You will inform me of your progress. Make it soon.”
After a short journey we reached Savernake (High Level) Station where I gestured to John that we should get out.
“Look John”, he said, sounding desperate, “I think I know what this thing is that the boys have got, and if I am right it is at least treatable. But if I go blundering in there and tell poor Harry then all hell is going to break loose for everyone –
I nodded. I could see that divulging the close shot would imply that the victim must likely have known his killer, which would only lead to further speculation. The distant shot left open the possibility that the dead man might have been killed by a shot from the hunting-party in the woods, but somehow I doubted that that was the case.
John was clearly horrified by such a suggestion, and after our visitors had gone spent a long evening determined to fuck me into not even considering it. In fact my only consideration was how I was going to pay Tiny the money I owed him before he left England!
“Harrumph!” she said looking disapprovingly first at Sherlock and then at me. “I have no time for men in general but I suppose that I have seen worse. You will do.”
Postscriptum: The service to Newlyn did not last long, barely seeing in the new year, although it was replaced by one to St. Just and Land's End. The Marazion service was discontinued in 1916, and under government pressure the Great Western Railway Company divested itself of its omnibus services between 1929 and 1933.
“Yes, he has”, he said. “That his former wife and her new husband were presented to the King-Emperor seems to have driven him to do something extremely foolish, even by his low standards. He has done an interview for a weekly magazine called 'Tatler'. A society magazine.”
He was still gasping for breath, and giving us both a look of utter hatred. But he knew that he had been defeated, and stormed from the room slamming the door behind him.
“The woman was awful!” Mr. Malone agreed. “First week she argued over everything and her voice carried right through the dividing wall, it was so damn shrill.”
door of his house and hence his reference meant a door to the left of that as you entered. When you emerged into the hallway from the opposite direction and saw a door open to
Mr. Hereward Buckingham, whose brother Lion we had saved from himself back in 1903, had gone to live in the United States where he had become an engineer for one of the railroad companies over there. I was not sure about his preference for the new-fangled diesel and electric locomotives over reliable steam ones, but his well-designed trains had proven very popular and his promotion was surely deserved. His brother had become an accountant at a major company in London and after just a few short years had already secured his first promotion.
What made it even more so was that the fellow before us, Mr. Thomas Sullivan Magnum (the Fourth, apparently; so much for the Good Lord not repeating mistakes!) was stuck here until I could find a way to get rid of him. A tall, charming and handsome fellow in his thirties, he had most unwisely used his charms on the American deputy ambassador's wife.
“Most obligingly her letter this morning gave the address of Lowen's molly-house”, I grinned. “He is waiting there with a dozen of his 'boys', several doses of chloroform and a photographer renowned for being able to develop his work very quickly. We shall be able to confront the woman with evidence of exactly what she was hoping to accuse her husband of doing, visiting a molly-house – and with rather more besides!”
We made ourselves fairly decent and I only had to kiss John twice to stop him grumbling before we descended to let my nephew in. I should point out (because several of John's readers asked and he did not mention the fact) that after the rebuilding we had ordered it had two full-sized bedrooms, one upstairs and one down because.....
“The house trap will take you to Darsham in time to catch a train to Ipswich”, he said, and I noted with concern that he had not answered my question, “then you will have to go to Chelmsford and take a long carriage-ride to the home of his brother Mr. Hereward who lives in a place called Chipping Ongar. You will need him for what is to come. Two more things before you go, brother.”
“He is an Austrian by birth”, Mr. Benson said, “but he has lived here since he was twelve. I believe that he is estranged from his father who still lives in Vienna.”
He did not hesitate in his delivery, yet again there was something in his tone which suggested that he knew rather more than he was saying. I began to have a bad feeling that I knew what was behind recent events here, which if I was right would mean that finding a resolution would not be easy.
“Sorry, Low”, the newcomer said, leering most shamefully even for someone who was wearing what seemed to be about ten per cent of a gentleman's bathing-costume. “Didn't know you had visitors.”
“No way”, he said flatly. “It wasn’t just that Alan kept a good house; even the drunks he threw out respected him for keeping order. He hadn’t an enemy in the world.”
“He is a lawyer representing a young gentleman accused of industrial espionage at the place of his employment”, our visitor explained. “His client's name is Mr. Ivan Leeds.”
Sherlock's great-uncle. Knowing that he was fated to soon contract a horrible wasting disease, Edmund's adopted son Sherrinford encouraged him to go for one last burst of passion with a lady-friend – and it was indeed his last!
“This is all lies, father!” Lord Daniel said hotly. “What proof is there? The word of this man and his hired thief?”
“I got a job working around the estate and that was how I met Bren. It was sheer chance; I was supposed to get a train back to Alnwick but it was cancelled so I ended up waiting on the station platform at Tweedmouth. There was some sort of problem with the bridge, I remember, so there were several trains and ours was not due out for a while, so I decided to stretch my legs. I saw him – and that was that!”
I placed my hand over his in thanks. He had not even hesitated. I was sure that I could not love him any more, but I would try.
I winced. I did not wish to leave London on a sour note nor to have my friend's reputation marred in that way. The Edwardian attitude towards homosexuality was much the same as the Victorian one; fine provided that everyone can pretend not to know about it. Indeed the King-Emperor himself had put it most excellently when he had remarked that he did not mind what people did behind closed doors 'provided that it did not frighten the horses'! Mr. Mycroft Holmes broadcasting his accusations across London in some society rag could damage us greatly.
1909. Poor John. After the 'loss' of his son Ivan, he gets the sort of curveball that only he could be on the receiving end of. Except in this case the delivery will be passing on to strike the man who he loves above all else – and there is absolutely nothing that he can do to stop it.
Ah. He was looking at the mounted St. George's Flag panties (remnants thereof) with the plaque below stating 'Mount Watson, Conquered New Year's Day 1907'. Oops!
Postscriptum: The earl kept his word and his two oldest sons were dispatched on the 'Cameroon' to the Dark Continent. It seems however that once again a higher power decided on a rather greater punishment for they went down with that ship off the coast of Liberia. The earl himself died soon after and Lord Thomas succeeded to the title and the estate at Stalwarton, where he and his redoubtable wife continue to prosper.
What made it worse was the letter that my friend had sent to me, marked 'Confidential: Patient's Records'. They had indeed been inside, but there had been a note from Peter telling me to make sure that I did not bring Sherlock with me. Considering how well they got on with each other I found this worrying but given my love's susceptibility to catching anything going I had been able to persuade him to let me go alone, although I missed him terribly. I was really worried about that note, though. It was so unlike Peter.
“I remember just how not jealous you were, John”, said someone who did not want to get laid or be doing any laying this month.
“That is good”, he said. “Hopefully the good citizens of Lewes will not hear your screams when I fuck you on this blanket.”
He went upstairs to search there and I let out a ragged breath. This was seriously embarrassing. Though I loved being scented by my man I still felt embarrassed at my having been reduced to holding my mate's dirty clothes at night to stop me from crying. I would have to take the damn jumper to be washed somewhere else and get it back without his noticing.
“Unfortunately the couple were returning home from a wedding where Mr. Ollerton had had more than a bit to drink”, Ginger said with a sigh. “I am sure that that coward was there but I cannot break his alibi.”
“I dare say that the company here is much more pleasant”, Sherlock smiled. “I assume that Mr. LeStrade is very independent-minded and most definitely the sort of person who wishes to achieve what he does on his own merits?”
We spent only a short time at Mr. Laurence Trevelyan's house, although it seemed a lot longer as far as I was concerned. The fellow promised that he would make inquiries and would have a definite answer by the end of the day (although I was sure that I caught him leering at Sherlock's backside again, which was off limits to everyone except me!). And 'someone' definitely smirked when I accidentally coughed, damn him!
“Greetings, gentlemen”, the prince smiled. “My brother wished that he too could come to England but with the political situation as it is just now he cannot leave our island home.”
My love also kept me updated regularly thereafter although the news was mixed; the time of the wedding and reception meant that he could not make the afternoon ferry back to the mainland but the hotel owner in Achnacroish had put him in contact with a local fisherman who could take him over to Connel (on the line into Oban and slightly nearer to the island) on Sunday morning from where he could get a train connecting with the night sleeper to London. Further telegrams on his way back from Glasgow and London only heightened my expectations and the welcome-home sex was amazing for two men in their fifties!
One of the lesser problems of having money was knowing when to help out people without seeming like one was interfering. John and had both kept an eye out for our friend LeStrade's grandson Galahad whose physical prowess (of which John had not been the least bit jealous, of course!) had brought us our penultimate case from Baker Street. We knew that he had just finished training to be a doctor but we both suspected that his family background might make gaining a foothold in his chosen profession more difficult than it should have done, even in so cosmopolitan a city as London. Our good friend Ginger helped monitor him for us and told us that this was indeed the case so we arranged for Lady Radnor, patroness of one of the most prestigious surgeries in the West End, to see the picture that he and his friend Mr. West had done as 'Gladiators At The Baths' (we had both seen said picture and it was safe to say that it had left almost
“Never mind”, he said consolingly. “As least you had someone to cud... comfort you with a manly embrace.”
that is the key – a person could imbibe either with little if any effect, but as you have seen, together they lead to what your poor husband has been suffering as of late. Which brings me to the matter in hand. I would assume that your brothers-in-law would want to administer it away from your eyes to be on the safe side, so one presumes it would be done when the gentlemen adjourn after dinner. You said that your husband does not like alcohol, so what does he take when the gentlemen retire after dinner?”
“I am sorry”, Sherlock said quietly, “but there is every probability that he did, and that that was one reason for your being disinherited.”
We returned (raced back) to the house on a Tuesday; I had provisionally reserved a first-class compartment back to London a week thence. I was sure that we might find some way to fill the time – and that first Tuesday John filled me repeatedly! One of the things he did when he was jealous (and that I loved) was to sleep with his bulkier if slightly shorter form on top of mine, as if he was afraid that I might disappear in some way. As if I would ever want to do such a thing!
“Can you find a pretext to take him somewhere away from Brunton for the day, to Marlborough maybe?” I asked.
I recognized the young pilot from the photograph that Luke had sent me. He was battered and bruised, but alive and recovering with the help of young Master Bigglesworth.
The year was also marked by three major events. In the War, the Germans finally challenged the British at sea but the Battle of Jutland was inconclusive; we lost more ships but it was they who fled back to their ports with their tails between their legs. Also at sea and as a consequence of the War there was the loss of the ill-fated Titanic's sister ship 'Britannic' which hit a German mine in the Mediterranean and sank in under an hour despite the design changes implemented after the loss of her sister. Fortunately this disaster occurred close to the coast and all but thirty of the over one thousand people on board were rescued.
I was stressed after Mr. Guilford Holmes's visit, so much so that for once I did not notice that Sherlock was not by my side. When I came to that realization, there was a brief moment of panic before I heard the bath running. An odd time for a soak in the middle of the day I thought, and stuck my head round the door to ask him why.
“The exact wording of the will, which I am sure your father's most talented solicitor read as commanded and told you that he was doing the same, was that the room containing the three items set aside for your cousins was, and I quote, 'to the left of my door'”, I said. “You did not mention that when he told you that, you all went out and found that the door with the items behind it had been opened during the reading.”
I decided that I needed to speak with the unseen Mr. Jukes and, given the delicacy of the matter, it might for once be better if I did so alone. Fortunately John was perfectly understanding when I explained that to him the following morning.
“In the murder of Mr. Alan Dallas we know that there were two shots, one at close-range and one at a distance that was most likely from the edge of the field. They key to understanding this solution of the crime hinges on which of those came first. I believe that it had to have been the distant one because we know that the victim instinctively drew his knife if he sensed the remotest hint of danger. I did consider whether Mr. Creighton Dallas had killed him as he would have been able to get close but there was clearly no motive; all that he inherited under his late brother's will were a few small family items. Miss Dallas, I quickly discovered, had never fired a gun in her life. So the distant shot
I had little time to revel in his praise before he removed the plug and began thrusting in, easing home with practised skill and, bastard that he was, deliberately ignoring my prostate. I writhed on the bed beneath him but he held me down easily with his hips alone his arms supporting his weight as he arched his back above me. My muscles felt like jelly and he must have taken pity on me for he suddenly reached down and pulled my legs up, striking my prostate full-on. I cried with happiness wishing both that this could last forever and yet that I could come. The latter happened within seconds and my eruption took Sherlock over the edge with me before he tumbled on top of me, smearing my come into both our chests.
“Because”, I said, “we follow justice before the law. I do not believe that you have had a good life up to now Mr. McCall, but I rather think that working here on the farm will remedy that.
Prince Pale collected our two guests the following day. Mrs. Rockland, bless her, told us that meals would be left outside the door for a week and that I was to try not to break anything. Except the doctor.
“Surely he cannot”, I said. “I thought that the rules about serving set times were tightened last year?”
Our former landlady gave him a dirty look; we had timed our visit to overlap that of the Rocklands and their six children. Yes,
I turned fifty-five this year and Sherlock duly marked the day in an appropriate and restrained manner. Safe to say that I was still aching when we went to church three days later and the vicar gave me the sort of look that told me his ultimate superior had probably tipped him off as to why. I made a larger than usual donation to the plate and sent a few extra prayers heavenwards, just to be on the safe side. Thank heavens for the ladies who put those embroidered cushions on those rock-hard pews even if they did smirk knowingly as I lowered myself onto said cushions very gingerly!
“Elizabeth has conceived some frankly idiotic notion that she is in love with a soldier based on – well, of all things, on a
He grinned at me and slid elegantly out of the vehicle before walking round to me. I stared in awe at the sleek blue-black automobile.
I did not pout, but Sherlock still gave me a look that said.... no, not with company present. Later, definitely!
I was feeling doubly happy that day because I had finally completed my final additions to the now extensive Sherlock canon and tomorrow Nick would take 'Elementary 160' with its forty new cases to the publishers for a final check. It had been hard work choosing the cases to be included and in the end we had put aside notes from well over a hundred other cases (including the several dozen those that my love had undertaken during my time in Egypt) that we had deemed not yet suitable for publication yet, although we would leave those to a later generation. Also the good news from London had been that the awful King Edward the Eighth who had become King-Emperor on his father's death in January had abdicated because, he had claimed, 'I cannot do my job without the woman that I love by my side'. Hah! I had been proven all too right about his shallow character† but the good thing was that his much more suitable brother Albert would replace him and would reign as King George the Sixth. With his only having had two daughters so far that made a new Elizabethan Age likely in the future too.
“Are you alright?” Sherlock turned his head to look John in the eye. There was a pink blush to his cheeks now, his eyes were brighter, and he looked the least dead John had ever seen him.
“Siger can’t know about this,” Sherlock said, making John flinch. “If he realises we’re moving to get hold of John’s guardianship, he could mount a defence for that.”
John’s heart tightened and throbbed. He put a hand to his chest, half-expecting it to come away covered in blood.
Sherlock closed his eyes. “This is just for your heat. Ok? I don’t want you to die. This… We can’t go from nothing to this and expect everything to be ok. This isn't like a film, we need to have a proper discussion about...”
‘He kissed me,’ Sherlock said, drowning in misery. ‘He kissed me, and – and it was my fault. He could have told everyone, Mycroft. But he didn’t. He kept it a secret, and – and I tried so hard not to mess up like that again.’
He looked into the long mirror that ran over the mantelpiece, and smiled as he held the outfit to his stomach, folding it slightly into the pose of a baby inside him. The suit suddenly looked rather large, and he grinned at the thought of his belly getting so big with baby, giving the sleep-suit a little stroke of affection.
John moaned softly, tension in his body building at the same rate as relaxation, making him tremble.
“What are my options, then?” he asked. “I was told anything I used might mess me up, and that might have already happened… seems like a bit of a catch-22.”
Sholto’s fist gripped at John’s shoulder, though the doctor didn’t flinch. "Not while he's under your spell. He's coming with me."
His alpha didn’t answer aloud, just gave a quick nod, and John wondered what wasn’t being said. There was a peal of laughter from one corner, then, and the mood broke a little. Sherrinford and his mate excused themselves, and John reclined back on the sofa for a moment, scanning the room for Sherlock.
Sherlock could be that close, and sink his teeth into John’s flesh, and do… other things to other parts of him.
Sherlock scoffed. “I lost my chance to play in an orchestra. I all-but flunked my degree, through trying to help Molly, and then started taking substances to enhance my existence. I pointed out the obvious to Lestrade, who could have –”
Sherlock strode beside him. He looked ill, drawn and pale, and John wondered if he’d slept at all. He must have been so angry. Maybe he still was. John had gone behind his back to see Eurus, after all. “Three pounds and three ounces.”
“You’re a menace,” he whispered to the baby, who dug her head down onto his cervix in response, making him groan.
He’d known a few, of course. Molly, the pathologist at St Bart’s, was one. There were a few others working for the police, usually in the science departments, not on the beat.
Sherlock went slowly down the steps, aware his face was streaked with tears and snot, aware he was holding a carrier bag with new shoes in it, aware the policeman was looking at him with concern.
He didn’t answer it. He didn’t trust himself to speak. He felt as if a bear trap had closed on his throat and around his chest.
“We are in a warehouse,” Sherlock shrugged. “I think it needs taking to the lab. Are you alright, Molly?”
He sat up sharply, too fast, his head swimming. A fly buzzed past his face again, and he wafted it away – or tried to. He smacked the insect directly and it fell dead to the floor.
“Yeah, turns out exercising for twenty hours a day takes a toll on you. And yeah, the hair,” John ran a hand over his very short haircut.
John moaned, his cock straining in his pants already. “Get – get up. Get up, Sherlock,” he tried to use his medical authority voice, but it came out like an alpha’s snarl.
Sherlock laughed, and took his phone out, signalling his participation in the meal was over. John was tempted to nag him again, but thought better of it. Sherlock clearly had an issue with food, but now wasn’t the time to start giving him a lecture.
“Our house was back from the road, though,” Sherlock hadn’t touched any of the food or drink, yet. “That might be why it seems noisy, here…”
“A passing fancy like you’ve been staring in the fridge for half an hour,” James pulled his coat on. “Don’t worry about it, there’s a Tesco Metro down the road, they’ll have it.”
“She’s put weight on,” John said, unable to hold back a flash of pride. Indeed, it was all he had after losing out on a lot of sleep the past few days. The baby liked to feed around the clock, and John ended up sleeping in the NICU one night, he was too exhausted and in pain to make it back down the lift.
“You… how… and you’ve been… since… but how…” Greg rubbed his forehead as if trying to get some more blood into his brain. “Jesus Christ, John. Tell me this is some sort of dream. Or joke.”
Sherlock’s graduation ceremony was to be held at the end of August. There was some argument about who should go. Sherlock could only get two tickets to the ceremony, and he was adamant that John was entitled to one of them, but was less enthusiastic about Mycroft having the other.
“Thank you,” Sherlock muttered, pulling them up over his thighs as he stood. He started to towel his hair, and John stole a look at his belly whilst his head was covered.
John smiled, pulling one of the pink baby blankets around himself to keep warm. “I love you, you know?”
in such a way when he really was powerless to resist. He could never have fought off a vampire even when he was fit, but the idea of not having his full strength for a moment was both frightening and exhilarating. Sherlock would never hurt him. But he could, and that was what made John’s cock throb again, threatening to spill over.
“I have to,” John forced out between gritted teeth. “I have to…” he tensed again, moaning in pain as his bunched muscles tightened and then relaxed. “Oh god,” he whispered, barely audible with the fangs scraping his lower lip. “Oh god.”
What felt like a block of concrete struck Sherlock around the head. He let go of Lestrade and fell to the floor hard.
John curled the covers around himself. Sherlock’s insistence that they wouldn’t be able to be as close, anymore, had unnerved him. He couldn’t imagine summers without him, couldn’t imagine Christmas without taking Sherlock’s present round on Boxing Day (because it made Christmas last longer) and the two of them drinking the hot chocolate Mycroft made, with golden syrup and marshmallows.
– wipes, bibs, dummies, muslin squares in scrunched-up bundles. He picked up a couple of used wipes, and dropped them into the bin as he passed, making his way to the bedroom.
“Tonight, I mean. Please?” Sherlock’s eyes found his own, and John was struggling to remember why this was a bad idea, why he should go, why… anything.
John shook his head. “He was… perfectly understanding. And that’s it. Pretty much said he wasn’t interested until my scent started coming back. So. More fool me, I guess.”
Sherlock tore open the envelope, and pulled out some folded papers, which he read, and then looked up in shock. “Father?”
‘Oh god, yeah,’ Faye laughed, then half-shut her eyes, opened her mouth slightly and gave a sensual sigh that made Sherlock flinch, and his blood suddenly tingle through his body.
“Yes. He’s clever, but his parents aren’t well off, and what he wants to do in life… isn’t going to be easy.”
John sighed. He'd asked himself the same question many times. "I guess because when it started it was just... I don't know. Release. I didn't even think I liked men, at that point."
The panics soon wore off, though, and Ryan came out of his sulky shell, taking four days off a month from then on, so routine it became boring.
“Sherlock dislikes omegas, now,” John said. “He never used to. But now… he resents the fact I am one, because it keeps us bonded. I can see it. But Mycroft says he wouldn’t tell him that. Who else is there?”
Siger cleared his throat. “Well, Sherlock, I stopped working for Cam for a long time. A few hard feelings developed, but that’s changed now. He doesn’t have any children, and he always liked you and Mycroft when you were little, he used to see you fairly often. I think he feel he owes you for a few Christmasses.”
“It’s no bother,” Mycroft shrugged, then looked at Sherlock. “Have you been mooching off my electricity all day?”
“Sure,” John smiled up at him, and felt Sherlock’s low rumble of anger, vibrating through the closeness of their arms. He ignored it. “I’ll be back for dinner, yeah?”
“Just a moment, darling,” Molly looked back at Sherlock. “I’m sorry, I don’t recognise you, you must have made a mistake.”
John, eyes still on the glass in front of him, gently leaned his head against Sherlock’s chest and allowed himself to be held, touched, gentled, and led over to the sofa, where they clung to one another.
John nodded at him, and watched Victor’s eyes flick down to the stretch of his jumper, the roundness just visible beneath. The beta man’s eyes glowed with something not unlike envy.
John followed Sherlock if only to escape from the eyes watching him out of the room. Christ, this was embarrassing. He never should have had sex with Sherlock. It was so stupid of him -
He drew a wobbly line, and frowned at it. It was more difficult than it appeared. And John had captured his image by doing this? He must be skilled.
“Yes, and the crowds will be gathering already,” Mycroft said. “We’re not standing all day to watch the London Eye be lit up by posh lightbulbs.”
“When do you think the new –” he started to ask, just as a removals van thundered up the street. It mounted the pavement, and crashed down onto the road again, outside the house next door.
Sherlock had to look back at the screen, he was in danger of bursting into laughter, or maybe a scream, at any moment. His heart was pounding in his ears, and black was throbbing at the edges of his vision as he dared not hope for anything more than this half-confession from the boy he wanted so badly, beside him.
John surveyed him, taking his time to look over the alpha’s head, face, neck, shoulders, arms, wrists, hands, fingers, chest… down and over every surface and body-part, making Sherlock very aware that he had nowhere to hide.
“Yes,” John clicked the slideshow open, showing an alpha man, face distorted, full erect and flushed red at the chest. “And how do we define rut?”
If the paramedic noticed the pronoun, she didn’t bother commenting, just kept on taking care of Sherlock as the ambulance sped into the city, blue lights blazing.
“I’m not going to adopt Sherlock, he already has a family,” John sighed. “And – and I haven’t ruled out the possibility of… one day. But not for
“Sherlock…” his mother said gently. “Would you like me to run you a bath? I bought some –” she hesitated, “some bath stuff that’s supposed to be good for muscle pain.”
“Out of rehab,” John said, forcing a smile. “She has a wife, now. They met in rehab. She’s a nurse.” He looked at his decaf coffee. “It’ll never work out. Harry’s not cut out for an LTR.”
“You could try a bottle,” a midwife said, but John refused. He knew it was guilt keeping him going with that side of things, but he wasn’t ready to share that job with a tin of powder quite yet.
He answered the first page, and turned over as a wave of nausea and cramp hit his torso. He grimaced in silence, hunching to try and fight off the feeling. It passed.
Murdered because the government needed a dead body that resembled a policeman that they had just killed (Abbas Parva case, 1890).
“That makes sense”, I said as we walked away from the big house. “What do you think of the case so far?”
I had seen the company models from the past two years in a motoring magazine and not been that impressed, but the 490 was in another league and I had been quite tempted by the reduced price despite the shipping costs. Now I had one!
Some people believe that they have a guardian angel watching over them. I am not that religious (although I would never say as much to Mother or I would get a clip round the ear) but if that is true then our family's guardian angel was in the human form of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who had assisted our family on more than one occasion. The last two times were when Father sought his help to try (unsuccessfully, alas!) to prevent Lion's father from murdering his mother, although he was able to secure justice there in the end, and more recently when that harridan Miss Reinelde Medlow had levelled false accusations against me. In both cases Mr. Holmes had ridden to the rescue and settled matters as much as they could be settled, and I know how truly grateful Father was even if he did complain (a lot) about Mother simpering at the fellow, which despite her denials she did indeed do. Three times, one of which was when Father had been standing right next to her!
The town of Edgeware was quite small and had only one ladies’ outfitters. The lady at the counter seemed at first mortified that a
“Miss St. Leger's ever-efficient organization has been finding out rather a lot about that young man for me”, Sherlock said. “Not only did his father provide him with a course of shooting lessons but the fellow also has expensive tastes which not even an actor of his talent's income could not possibly support. His bank account has received several mysterious deposits of late and it may be that with time they can be traced to the country which employed him.”
"It was not your grandfather who got you that job on the railway, was it?" I pressed. "It was your mother, Lady Eleanor."
At Doncaster there was the usual wait as the Great Northern Railway locomotive was replaced by a North Eastern one. We had just started off again when to my intense annoyance someone slid open the door, blatantly ignoring the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the blinds.....
“The excellent condition of your own teeth states that you do not smoke a pipe”, Sherlock said, “but someone has knocked out old tobacco dregs into a fire and one or two did not quite make it. I take it that your 'friend' is in the habit of collapsing onto the couch in an untidy heap to the detriment of the poor cushion, and the indentations thereon suggest that he does not always rest there unaccompanied. The markings are.... familiar.”
“McCullough, who is in the same barracks as my son”, the general sneered. “Saw him one time the rat; the family is Irish which figures. Disgusting filth! I sent their sergeant-major a letter demanding to know what the hell was going on and saying that I was coming to see him pretty damn quick, and he wrote back to say that the rat denied it was him and by the way my son had run off when he had mentioned my coming. I want my boy dragged back to his regiment and made a man; you can go sort it out for me and I will be there this weekend to see your findings. My card.”
I was about to wonder at how he had gotten from cinematography to sexual aids when I saw what had presumably come in the post that morning. I gulped in fear.
“This is from our friend Ginger up in London”, he said. “It seems that among the passengers on the ship was a lady travelling second-class with a 'friend'. Her name was Mrs. Emma-Jane Watson.”
“Swordland's is as efficient as ever under the prodigious Mr. Tudor”, Sherlock smiled. “Although I understand that Miss St. Leger – sorry, Mrs. Zeuson now – still maintains a strong interest in things. Retirement does not seem to have slowed her down at all. Like quite a few people.”
“He seemed unable to stand or even sit up”, Miss Kelley said. “It was most worrisome but, as I said, he seemed right as rain the next day so we just thought it was something that he had eaten. His brothers had taken him to a new restaurant the night before – Argentinian, I think he said – and he had not liked it much.”
noticed of late was that he had become very highly-strung. He had always been a nervous young fellow but of late it had become notably worse, and he had resisted Father's attempts to train him in handling a gun. Not that England was the sort of place where a gentleman
“Back to Mr. Aeneas who was, I believe the saying is, ‘the apple of his father's eye’. He was charismatic, outgoing and popular with all who knew him. He even took part in competitive athletic events when younger. He married well, but sadly there were no children. It was a great tragedy when he caught a particularly virulent strain of influenza while visiting with a friend in France and died this past January. His father was of course heart-broken.”
Our guide round the air-base was Captain John Henderson, a dashing blond fellow of about twenty-five years of age who was the archetypal British soldier. He was it turned out a pilot himself but had not applied to fly the new service.
Which was why the telegram that was delivered later that day came as something of a surprise. Having just been told that our friends were still in England, I was confused to receive a message signed 'S. Holmes' from a place called Lincoln, Nebraska in the United States. That state was, if I remembered correctly, one of the middle states, so nowhere near Tennessee where we were heading. The message was short and to the point; it told me to do what my love wanted.
1916. Sherlock and John take a holiday in Scotland, revisiting someone they once helped, seeing somewhere far out and just enjoying time on the beach admiring the beautiful scenery.
Postscriptum: One day very soon, he did. Mr. James Bigglesworth became arguably Great Britain's most famous fighter ace in the Great War, which against all the odds he somehow survived. The last flight of Captain Henderson, whose plane and body were found not far from Heath Row where we had assisted Queen Molly's niece Miss Ferrers, brought an end to the experimental air-service, but the massively improved planes that emerged from the Great War led to its resumption once that terrible conflict was over. Even if John still shudders at the idea of flying.
“I have come across Mrs. Bollinger in the course of my inquiries into another matter, over in Harringay”, I said. “In that case an elderly gentleman rewrote his will in her favour despite her frankly weak protestations against such a move, and she inherited a large sum of money as a result. I had an inquiry in this neighbourhood for another case and I thought that I would do you the courtesy of informing you that I shall speak to your grandfather at the first opportunity.”
my managers not to take any retribution against my employees”, Sherlock said firmly. “Those instructions were delivered to you by registered post, so I know for a fact that you received them.”
our friend 'Ginger', would bring a swift result even though I knew that the lady was back in East Suffolk sorting out her new home in which she planned to 'semi-retire' as she called it with the impossibly muscular Mr. Harry Zeuson, one of my brother Sherrinford's helpers. John had threatened to send his notes from our adventure in that area to my mother 'so that she might feel inspired', and I had been horrified! One does not feed a forest fire!
Mr. Guilford Holmes had taken over the administration of our 'retirement' a few years back when his brother Randall had been dispatched to south-east Europe to monitor the increasingly dangerous situation there (he had not been shot yet, despite all those prayers!). In first Morocco, then Bosnia, then Morocco again war between the two political blocks had looked set to erupt only for cooler heads to prevail on each occasion. But that luck could not last forever – and the assassination last month of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire) by a Serb had exacerbated the already high tensions between Vienna and Belgrade. It was indeed less a question of whether war would break out and more one of whether Great Britain and the Empire would be drawn into it.
1913. John is horrified by something in the newspaper (not of course in the social pages, which he never looks at). The dynamic duo's godsons are doing well for themselves while those young gentlemen's father Valiant LeStrade has his twentieth – TWENTIETH! – and last child. And someone chooses between the devil and the deep blue sea.
Not for the last time I gave silent thanks that Baker Street was so near to Paddington Station. The last cab-drive back between the two had been utter agony after Sherlock had had his way with me all the way back from Oxford, and I had even had to rest for a moment before attempting to climb Mount Everest, or as he insisted on calling them, the stairs back up to our rooms.
1903. The truth, they say, is black and white – but in this case it was the shades between that led to an attempted cover-up which Sherlock, despite a frankly terrible client, managed to expose.
“Would you rather he thinks that you are someone who would break up a gentleman's marriage just so that you might sleep with him?” I asked dryly.
For some reason he looked pointedly at Doctor Watson as he said that, and his friend blushed deeply.
“I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you have decided to help with this case, gentlemen”, the lawyer said, wiping his forehead. He was a short almost round fellow in his late forties, with a small birthmark on his cheek and rapidly receding blond hair. “Frankly I had my doubts when my client claimed an acquaintanceship with Doctor Watson here – it has been my bitter experience that some accused people will claim anything when under duress – but it was all true.”
Although sadly not including the one which prevented Sherlock from giving me a warning look when I thought but did not say things like that!
1903. The unknowing half-great-nephew of a certain consulting detective, Mr. Hereward Buckingham's life seems set fair – but his concerns about his adoptive brother prove all too accurate. Fortunately his other family is set to ride to the rescue.
Sorry this has been so long coming... I've had to take on more paid work to try and cover some unexpected bad news, and that's taken a lot out of me emotionally, too. Writing things I love, like fic, has had to take a back-seat, and that's just made me feel worse. But hopefully things are turning around, now! Apologies again for keeping you all waiting.
“Oh god…” John adjusted his seat on Sherlock’s thighs, and Sherlock felt the wetness over his skin. John’s wetness. Even as John let go of Sherlock’s spent cock, the alpha longed to sink into that wetness. It was inbuilt. The feeling would go away, feelings always did, but right now…
They all looked at one another for a moment, then burst out laughing, John stepping into Alfie’s space, and exchanging a gentle brush of cheeks. Alfie smelled of some expensive cologne, and his dark skin was soft. John had no trouble seeing what Sherry saw in his mate, even if he was pleased to notice he felt no interest in the man aside from being the future uncle of his baby.
“Uh…” Sherlock put his hands on John’s shoulders, and pushed him back, so he could no longer reach him. “Sorry, you…” He glanced down at the fake bump. “That should be illegal!”
“Take a leaflet, boys, there you go,” the careers fair was in full swing on the first day of September. John and Ryan were the only two omegas attending Sixth Form, and they collected flyers as they walked through the hallways, not really paying attention to what was on them.
“But…” Sherlock looked up, his eyes rather glassy, “if they tell me they don’t… I don’t know how to…”
“He did it to be funny – it made him laugh,” Sherlock said, taking a deep breath. “He found it… funny, that I was trying to figure out who he was, and everything he said confused me more. He knew I was vulnerable, and trying to figure out new ideas, and I was struggling. So, he fed me lies, and misinformation, and he was amused by it. More than that, he found it hysterical that he could be in a relationship with a
Sherlock shoved himself hard between John’s legs, slotting their pelvises together. John let out a sound as the vampire’s hard cock made itself known, rutting over the inside of his thigh, his crotch, meeting his own cock as John groaned in need.
“You did invite yourself back into his house. If he wanted to be rid of you, he would have said ‘no’ to that.”
“Looks extreme, yes, but remember that this is a crucial part of birthing. At this point, a midwife will likely tell the mother not to push, or risk an injury.”
“Alright,” Sherlock said. “We’ll lock you in. And you can call me every step of the way, if you like.”
. Could you love a baby you hadn’t sired? And why didn’t he mind her being in the flat? She had her own scent now, something like John’s only with added notes of something he didn’t recognise, mixed together to be her own baby omega smell. Sherlock’s alpha brain recognised that she was not his. She was, technically, an intruder. Then why did he keep carrying her around and kissing her nose? It made no sense.
James gave a smile, or a half-smile, at any rate. He picked up his coffee, and came to join John at his table. John swept his things to one side, trying not to stare, but wanting to stare so much it was like trying to hold back a sneeze.
John bent down and kissed Sherlock, taking his lips in a firm, possessive kiss that made the young man go pliant, and hitch a knee to get John’s pelvis closer. John’s hips rolled, his hard cock rubbing against Sherlock’s still-covered one so the student cried out, right into John’s mouth.
The drive didn’t take long, and they were soon getting out of the car. Cam’s house looked grand in the frost and leftover snow, and there was a large Christmas tree looming in one window.
Jim went purple. “I am not making this up. Sherlock is a transsexual. At our old school, she was wearing a skirt and had long hair. That’s why Watson isn’t gay – he’s with a girl playing dress-up!”
John was furious, and fierce, and scenting Sherlock like an alpha possessed. He was driven by hormones and jealousy, and for the first time, Sherlock was almost afraid of him. “You’re mine.”
Sherlock nodded. “I’d gone a long time without seeing her. I thought… perhaps seeing my family might.. help me.”
The porter smiled, and cooed at Lucy before plating up what John was allowed – eggs, beans, toast and tomatoes. And tea.
“Please,” Victor took his hands. “Please, Sherlock, listen to me. I don’t want this other omega. I want you. I
The vampire walked through the carriage, the remaining passengers parting like the red sea for him, until he stopped in front of John.
“Now, we just need to cut a door, and a window,” John said, holding up the serrated knife. “Do you have a pen?”
“Oh, that reminds me,” Sherlock said, “Mummy is going to ask you to come to France with us, next week.”
“She was like me… well, not like me… but she was…” Sherlock made a gesture at himself that John couldn’t quite interpret. “She died, and her parents buried her in a suit, and they cut her long hair off. Her brother told me. And… and I…” he went very red, and John saw his hands clench. “I don’t want that to be me. I don’t want – don’t want to die, Mycroft, not really. I…”
“We need an on-call, actually,” Greg Lestrade said, not shaking hands as his arms were full of files. John was grateful. The detective inspector wasn’t John’s type, but he had the sort of easy attractiveness of any alpha, and John’s hormones were enough of a mess as it was. The detective nodded to himself. “This could work out quite well… any police experience, Doctor Watson?”
"Best not to wake me. I tend to get punchy." He drank again, and looked down at himself, apparently self-conscious about his state of undress.
“You can stay here,” John said, thinking fast. “You’ll have to. Legally, you live here, now. There’s a bedroom upstairs, you can have that and keep your things in it. Do you have a suitcase, or anything?”
And it happened swiftly. John turned Sherlock over and lifted him onto all-fours as he weighed nothing. Sherlock pressed his face into the pillow for a moment to hide the burn of embarrassment in his face, before he felt John’s cock pushing against his hole, and he gasped for air. ‘Yes, John,’ he managed to force out, ‘god yes, please, fuck me…’
“Mycroft Holmes,” the tall alpha introduced himself. “I had assumed I’d be greeting my brother in law, but as of yet…” he inhaled, scenting, “nothing to report.”
“John, Sherlock, this is Tabitha and Poppy,” Mycroft did quick introductions. “They’re establishing the guardianship case.”
“He’s had to, for self-preservation. He’s got a mate. Every other person he’s ever looked at is now a footnote. I’m sorry, Sherlock. That’s devotion that only comes from a bond. I am so, so sorry.”
“You let him. You fucking let him,” John kept repeating as he pressed hard against the omega and inhaled his skin, his hair, all reeking of another alpha who wasn’t even sexually mature. “You let him!”
“Not the bat as much as his behaviour causing it,” Sherlock said. “He’s not attracted to omegas, on the day to day, but that was… an unforeseen event.”
John was already breathing a touch harder than usual (nothing anyone would have like noticed) as he took off his shoes. He also hadn’t shouted to ask if Sherlock was in.
“I know.” John took the bottle back. He looked serious. “I think, realistically, your parents would skin me if they thought we were… more than friends.”
“No. Like you, I never wanted the patter of tiny feet. Nor the mess, nor the crumbs. No, it’s difficult to find an omega who doesn’t want children. A companion, is what I crave. Someone of equal intelligence, who accepts what I have to offer, and makes the most of it. Have you thought about Oxford?”
Sherlock appeared beside him, back in his own clothes of a long-sleeved baseball top and skinny jeans. “That’s expensive,” he noticed the register.
"I did it for my family," she seethed. "So my daughter could live a good life, even if I'm not there. The money I made from that war will give her a comfortable life."
The nurses got John and his daughter settled, positioning the baby on John’s chest so she was close to one of his nipples, and Sherlock could sort of see her if he peeped down John’s top.
“Unnecessary?!” Sherlock spat. “You have no idea what’s brought me here, so shut your mouth and fuck off home, why don’t you?”
John covered his mouth to hide a smile as Greg didn't know where to look or how to help, choosing to wander away. Pregnant omegas didn't frequent crime scenes. And Sherlock was still at uni, to boot. Newly bonded, pregnant and beautiful... What was he doing squinting down at dead bodies?
“Fuck that,” John muttered, grabbing the two tests and putting them together. There was a barely-there line on both of them, now. He grabbed his wallet, and left the sticks on the desk, heading out to get a cab.
“Just little things that give you away,” Sherlock smiled, going back to kiss at John’s jaw, feeling him tense. “It’s alright. I knew the first time we met, but you never seemed to want to discuss it, and you always chose to present as a beta, so…”
“Ha. You’re on the edge, I can fucking smell it. Never thought Toby’d beat you to it, mind…” the alpha inhaled, and shuddered. “What – you think you’ll have a nice quiet first heat at home with your alpha-fiancé? You’re at school more than you’re at home. And if you have it in the middle of lunch, or in P.E…. You’d be begging for a knot.”
“Have a shock blanket ready,” John sighed, opening the door. “If I’m not back in two hours, ring the police.”
Sherlock was biting his lip, looking somewhere between afraid and eager, his chest rising and falling fast under his cotton t-shirt, his pyjama bottoms betraying the fact he was at least semi-hard.
Still thinking about his injury claim, John bought a pack of two tests from the supermarket, not wanting to risk seeing Victor at the chemist’s, grabbing the first box he saw and gruffly throwing it onto the conveyer with a fierce blush.
Sherlock hadn’t bitten him. Hadn’t even made a move for John’s throat, though John had been ready to thump him one if he’d gotten carried away. Alphas did. They couldn’t control themselves, omegas made them lose a grip…
He took a deep breath. “Jim… at least, I think it was him… Sent me a photo of you. You, before you… transitioned,” he whispered.
“Polite little thing, isn’t he?” the alpha laughed, though there was no malice behind it. “Sherry told me you were sweet.”
“Goodnight,” he took the glass of water, and went to his bedroom, locking the door before getting under the covers.
“John…” Sherlock sniffed, snuggling into his alpha’s shoulder and neck, inhaling the scent of him. Woodsmoke and orange chocolate and masculinity. Sherlock could feel John’s hard cock pressing against his stomach, against his own erection, and he wanted to rock himself to climax right there. Why not?
Sherlock ran away from the angel – the man – until he was out of sight. He stood, catching his breath at a street corner, trying to think what to do. He should go back to his flat, and sleep off this… whatever this was. This trip, or hallucination…
Sorry for the delay, and thank you so much to everyone who had downloaded my ebook. You're all my favourites. xxx
“True,” John pulled a face. Alphas could father children for much longer than omegas could mother them. “It doesn’t matter, I was just… wondering.”
"I've never had a… relationship. At least, not the way relationships are carried out in this day and age," Sherlock said. "And I've never really been open to one, before. Not really my area, since murdering the only person I've ever loved.”
Sherlock, in what was probably a moment of kindness, had locked the front doors. John knew they were properly locked. He’d tried to get out, on the second day, when he was seeing stars. Even the windows wouldn’t smash – Mycroft had some sort of security glass in that wouldn’t give.
“Enough is enough,” he said, sitting John and Sherlock down in the lounge. “As fun as this festive season has been, you are not squatting in my flat. John, you are welcome to stay as long as you need, but Sherlock – what is happening with Baker Street?”
“Sh…..” John slurred, clapping a hand onto his face, co-ordination way off, and dislodging the oxygen mask, which was quickly put back on as he threatened to nod again.
They left the office with no more answers than they arrived with. John felt exhausted, and just sat in the back of the car and listened as Mycroft promised to look into the application process, and Sherlock started listing MPs and people in government he would write to.
what if John figured out that it was Sherlock who had driven Cam to kiss and touch him that time? What if John found out that it had been Sherlock’s fault?
Sherlock’s tongue slipped hesitantly into John’s mouth, and John thought he might explode from the touch as it swept over his own, followed by a small kiss to the lips, like a full stop, or an ellipsis, because the kisses kept coming, and Sherlock’s hands were roaming John’s hair, and shoulders, and arms.
He thanked the man, shook his hand, and walked slowly back to their waiting area. He paused to add some gel to his hands on the way. He washed his hands so much that the skin on his knuckles was dry and cracked. Sometimes, it bled. And that was what the latex gloves had to come out, and what might have been a simple mopping up procedure became dramatic and distressing.
“Congratulations!” Sherry beamed, thrusting a huge bouquet of flowers into John’s arms, and inviting himself in, along with several fancy-looking bags from shops John’s didn’t recognise the names of.
He suddenly felt sick, and tore his hand away, shuddering. He pulled his pyjamas on quickly, hiding his body, and going quickly to his room, to bed.
John listened, head against the banister rails, letting the soft music drift up through the floorboards to his ears. He relaxed, inch by inch, until he stood, and walked slowly down the steps, turning at the bottom to get to the music room. He knocked.
“And no doubt I’ll be a late one if we wait,” Sherlock snorted. He turned, looking them both over, noticing how much they had changed in these few weeks. At least, how much Victor had changed. His face was slightly broader, with a more defined jaw and he was shaving every other day. His chest was more defined, and he was taller again, heavier and more muscular than Sherlock, who still had a boy’s body, all thin arms and legs, a tiny chest and no beard whatsoever.
John hands are clenched on bunches of shirt and dressing gown, and Sherlock is holding him fast, like a dancer, like when they danced, in secret, behind closed curtains, and John had been so sure the sparks struck between their bodies were all in his mind.
“He won’t,” John said, with a certainty that sent a thrill through Sherlock’s bones. “But this marriage was never meant to exist. It was never meant to happen, Sherlock. Your tutoring of Molly, and saving her experiment, meant that she was able to train as a pathologist. You gave her a focus that wasn’t a relationship. In so many ways, you saved her, Sherlock.”
“No, rest assured that Sherlock continues to attempt to keep me in the dark about anything and everything remotely connected to his life.”
And the next time John opened his eyes, it was Christmas Morning, and Harry was throwing a stocking at his face.
John traces his fingertips, feather-light, up over Sherlock’s ribs – he isn’t ticklish it seems - to the worst of the yellow-and-black stains he kicked into that white skin.
“No, I’m not old enough,” John picked up his shirt and pulled it on, leaving the buttons undone as the cotton stuck to his sweating back. “But I… My parents were in an accident, and… They’re like, my next of kin…” he stopped talking, feeling Sholto’s eyes on him, and wishing he’d never started. “Yeah, it’s extreme.”
“I know so.” John kissed Sherlock again, on the cheek, lingering, nosing at his jaw, inhaling the non-scent of him. “It’ll take more than your mother to get me away from you.”
He ran a hand over his body, feeling the softness, the slightly damp and sweaty skin from his fight with the binder.
He pressed hard at his stomach – it felt as if his stomach, or something lower down – was stretching and distending inside him. He had the urge to do things to himself that he’d only ever heard about in lewd whispers, and as much as he tried to tell himself that he didn’t want to, that it was dirty, he ended up doing them anyway.
They left the pub, and Greg gave John a lift home in the squad car. John didn’t say much, just stared ahead out of the window, letting the cold air conditioning wash over his face, and wondered why he hadn’t put two and two together before now. That strange sensation wasn’t just his insides protesting. For god’s sake, he was closing in on being halfway through this whole experience. He was definitely showing, now. Not enough to need new jeans, but when he stood in the mirror he could see the start of something that would probably be passed off as a paunch, given his age. His hips were narrow – he was old  - very old – for his first pregnancy, and if he had been younger his hips would have spread to cope with the pregnancy. As it was, John’s bones were long-since fused into place, and he could already tell he would struggle when the time came to actually deliver the baby.
After the service, Sherlock stopped behind in the yard with Mycroft as their parents talked to some of the friends they only saw at these sorts of events, being overly polite and cheery.
"I'm not done. Just holding off," Sherlock said, massaging John's firm backside, spreading his cheeks and dragging a dry finger over the entrance.
Sherlock cut him off. "In short, my affairs are not yours to control. See yourself out," he said coldly, stepping between Mycroft and John, his eyes staring, unblinking, into Mycroft's.
“Who could he take?” Violet asked, as if Sherlock wasn’t there. “He’s never mentioned anyone from school.”
“You’ll be going on research leave,” Greg handed him a folder. “Working with a private detective. And then, parental leave.”
John’s hips rolled up, and Sherlock felt the much larger erection press against him. He pressed back, the two of them working into a sort of thrusting rhythm, back and forth, John’s pants being worked down so the pink head of his cock was exposed.
He didn’t feel any better the next morning, at breakfast. He sat at the table in the kitchen, looking at the photo again, at the face of the figure in it, at their smooth face and rounded cheeks.
She smiled. “That sounds like something we can work towards. I’m not saying it’ll be quick, John, but it’s something we can work on, together.”
And shrieked in horror at the sight before his eyes. Terror flooding his veins and he was certain he was facing his own death because something was… good god above something
He decided to risk it, creeping down the stairs and into the deserted living room. The kitchen was empty, too. In more ways than one. Mycroft had teabags, and milk, but nothing else.
“Well, I think I have a clear list of issues to work through, and if more come to us, we will work on those, too,” Melody said. “Now… let’s get you back to your family.”
“And you’re alright with that, are you? Your omega trying to protect another alpha?” James laughed, sickeningly. “Can’t you see what he’s doing?” He let go of John’s hair, and John stepped back, out of reach, limbs tense in case he had to defend himself.
"Sorry," Sherlock shook himself. "Just thinking... Erm... D'you want to stay over, Friday? You said you wanted to watch that film that's on the movie channel."
He wanted to stay and solve mysteries with the fascinating, irritating human man called John Watson. How stupid. He was so eager to make the same stupid mistakes he had when he was human, and that... had made him into more of a monster than being turned ever had.
A few days later, Mycroft came over for a visit. They sat in the common room, afforded privacy because they were family, and Mycroft elaborated on the damning letter.
“Don’t say that,” Sherlock pushed himself off the door, hearing footsteps approaching. “You’ve barely scratched the surface, John.”
John pressed his mouth tight for a moment. “But… last time you were here, you said you didn’t want to… do anything with me. And then you text me.”
“There’s a few side-effects. Some serious ones, yes, for immature omegas it can affect fertility, and all sorts… We can look into it. If it’s something you’re genuinely afraid of… I don’t want you living in fear.”
“Thank you, Sherlock,” John held the door open for him and showed him out, feeling quite bizarre as he smelled that empty scent, again. He’d been wrong, before. It didn’t smell child-like, at all. It smelled of intrigue, and curiosity, and… John’s finger slipped on the keys as he tried to lock up. He turned around, and Sherlock – the mystery boy – was gone.
Pants came off, then, both pairs at once, kicked off in a sort of frenzy that left them both naked and lay on their sides, glancing down to compare their bodies in a silent, shocked and delighted way.
“I meant you don’t have to stay… here. In this,” Sherlock gestured between the two of them. “I… You’ve seen the… the
“I’ve found a school walking distance from here,” John said as he took the lids off the takeaway containers. “I thought we could go and look at it, tomorrow? After your brother drops your things off, of course.”
“We probably do,” Sherlock said softly. “But…” he moved his fingers again, to cover more of John’s. “I don’t want you to not want me.”
Sherlock sat up, and shook his head. "You will die if you get too cold, you primitive idiot. Do yo understand what that means? Get back over here you stupid thing."
Sherlock opened his mouth immediately to call John out on his lie. Even through his hospital uniform the man’s strength and fitness was obvious in how he carried himself. But Sherlock realised the lie was a kindness.
“Right, Sholto’s team are skins, and they’re batting first,” a Year Eleven had nominated himself as referee. “We’ll do all ten of you, then we can do a straight swap, ok?”
“Sometimes I dream about it. Less now, but I used to a lot. I’d wake up and be sick. Sometimes, now, when Sherlock and I… sometimes it feels the same.”
Sherlock seemed struck speechless, his eyes popping at the sight of a mature alpha cock pressed against his stomach.
“So, how’s it really going?” Molly asked, once she and John had got to the front of the bar queue and placed their large order. “I couldn’t really ask you in the car with Sherlock there.”
“John, you were delivered a baby omega girl, by caesarean,” a doctor said, taking control of the situation. “She was taken straight to Neonatal ICU, and she’s stable.”
“Morning,” John said, hopefully in the same voice as ever. Sherlock looked wonderfully dishevelled this morning, and John could see red patches on his collar-bones. “Do you want a tea, or are you showering?”
“But what a fitting punishment, don’t you think?” Sherlock raised his red eyes. “You could argue I deserve it, but you do not. I will find him, the one who caused this.”
“And he looked shocked? You think this was a mistake? A slip of the tongue? Or something he feels, but did not mean to say?”
“You ruined me,” Siger snarled. A drop of saliva dripped from his ragged lip onto John’s cheek. “Seems only fair I get to ruin you. And this time,” he lowered his face to John’s, “there’s no one here to come and save you.”
“First rut passes in around forty-eight hours,” John went on, “and is generally painful, unless the alpha does mate. For males, their knot has get extremely sore, without compression, and for females, internal cramps are, I’m told, bone-wrackingly bad.” John saw a couple of alpha girls nodding. “Once the rut is over, alpha men will be able to fertilise beta and omega people with functional ovaries. Alpha women can conceive, it has been recorded, but it is difficult, and alpha women naturally seek out betas and omegas as preferable mates, or, indeed, other alpha women. Though, it has to be said, women are much more likely to present beta or omega, for reasons we’re not quite sure about.”
“You’ve not thrown up, that’s admirable,” Oliver laughed. “So many kids go green when they try it. Or grey.”
Theakston nodded. “Go for walks, get your strength back up, eat proper meals… Just stay out of the sea, won’t you.”
,” Sherlock forced out. “Anything, except – fucking – fear, alright? I can be angry with you later, but right now I’ve got my…” he stopped, and puffed out a breath, looking at the ceiling tiles, fighting off tears. “I just want to stay here, with John, and I can’t even do that. What if…”
With two other sons and a daughter by this time, the squire had formally disinherited Ivan not knowing of course that the boy was my blood, not his. Even when Anne had given birth to two boys there had been no reconciliation and I had wondered if one of the reasons that Ivan had enlisted might have been in an attempt to regain his father's approval. If so he had failed.
do?” I said. “The train is so packed, I doubt that he can risk anything until Baker Street where quite a few people will alight. Did he get into our carriage or another one?”
1911. The Malones have finally got what they wanted (six times over), and there is a death in the Holmes family which leads to all sorts of complications. Meanwhile poor John has more of the sort of family problems that not even Sherlock can help him with.
The Charger rolled forward smoothly and just moments later was parked outside a very familiar cottage. We kissed before getting out and went inside, into a perfect copy of our old home down to the bees and the blue shed (complete with its light). Sherlock and John, together forever. It was as it always would be... elementary!
“Apparently Randall chose to have some of his men break into the shop to obtain the negative, then break back in the next night to replace it”, he said. “I would wager that the idea of using more conventional means did not even occur to him!”
The journey to the cottage seemed interminably long – some bastard insisted that we could not have sex on the train as 'we would need our energy for later' – and we finally rolled into Berwick Station where the carriage Sherlock had arranged took us the remaining miles to our new home.
A son of the family who virtually owned Kincardineshire and had both the local police and the judges in their pocket. This encouraged him to rape a local girl, thinking that there would be no repercussions. There were repercussions; he was ambushed by the locals, raped himself by the smith (the largest man in the village) and then murdered, his body being thrown down the castle well at Kincardine near to where his cottage was.
“I do not know if five days will be enough”, he said. “It is all rather bizarre, almost supernatural, although I myself fear that more earthly forces are behind it all.”
I remember this visit because Jack, who had become a journalist at the 'Times' with only a little help from Sherlock, mentioned that the recent
I pouted, secure in the knowledge that I had my back to him. He was mean, using that word when I was too comfortable to move away.
His two friends snickered at each other, especially when he realized how what he had just said might be misinterpreted. He looked mortified!
“Mr. Leeds is the son of a former acquaintance of John's, a Mrs. Elizabeth Leeds”, Sherlock said calmly. “We happened across them in a case back in 1889 when the lady's husband was wrongly suspected of trying to drive his grandfather mad. John also knew the young gentleman's father out in Egypt.”
“Strafford Island is a small but strategically important nation roughly equidistant between the Hawaiian Islands and the Equator”, Captain Higgins said dryly. “A most excellent move if I may be allowed to say, sir.”
“There has been a further killing at the Mazarin Stone”, he said. “Two deaths this time. Miss Dallas and Mr. Heston.”
That explained the accent then. The Galvidians had been a late edition to the Scottish kingdom having been wrested from the ancient English kingdom of Northumbria and then retained some degree of independence because of their relative isolation. Sherlock and I had passed through the area after our sole Irish adventure many years back and again not long after his return when we had visited the Isle of Whithorn (Vich Ian Vor). Most memorably of all, of course, after our Gretna case (Murder Over The Border) and just prior to our moonlight encounter in the smith there. I had liked the area a lot and only wished that it had been warmer, otherwise it might well have rivalled the Sussex Downs as a possible place for our retirement.
“You know that we would not have called on you for help unless things were desperate”, he said. “Well, they are now really,
“I shall be informing your father that I have that information”, I went on, “and that if her persists in his current bad ways then I shall feel perfectly entitled to share it with the whole world. I have also found out that he has been making covert efforts to destroy his daughter's medical career, which he will be told to desist from. Should he decide that he knows better – something that I consider all too likely given his actions thus far – then I shall arrange for some friends of mine to 'chance to bump into him' of an evening and to make sure that he fully understands the way things are now. Much as I might wish it to be otherwise bullies like him often only understand one language in my experience, that of the violence they themselves use.
“The event concerning my client occurred up to and over the weekend of the fourteenth and the fifteenth”, the lawyer went on. “Without wishing to deviate into technicalities which I find confusing if not incomprehensible, the men at the works were building an auto-mobile powered not by steam as is usual but by this new-fangled diesel engine. I should also say that the technological side of the business is relatively small and consists of precisely three developers, one of whom was Mr. Leeds.”
“I know a little about the photography business”, he said. “The shop owner may have handed his customer the print but he will retain the negative in case the lieutenant required any further copies. We shall just have to persuade him to part with it.”
“Mrs. Hawke will likely remain married to her poor husband until she finds something better or he divorces her”, I explained. “The latter is fraught with social problems but she may be persuaded to sue for a divorce herself if she thinks that she would win a large cash settlement from it, either as a pay-off or through the courts. A sizeable enough large divorce settlement would offer her the chance to marry some other poor su.... gentleman who might be prepared to overlook her many failings.”
My hulk of a father towered over both me and my pest of a brother Edgar, and I wondered if I might actually make it to manhood. He had grown ever more like our impossible great-grandfather as he had gotten older, and had the sort of physicality that suggested he could bury both of our bodies without so much as breaking a sweat. But hell, I was in the right here!
at home, so Mother and Muriel agreed that he should translate their entire combined works”, he grinned. “In a choice between facing a horde of raging Slavs and two lots of literary 'masterpieces', there was only ever going to be one winner!”
That was until we came back to the house and found something neatly folded on the table. Sherlock’s jumper. I stared at it incredulously while he read the note that had been left beside it.
“The doctor has found certain irregularities concerning the death of your brother”, he said. “Naturally we have not made these public as yet given people's propensity to gossip, but as his close kin we feel that you should be apprised of them. It appears that he was shot at some distance, yet there are also indications that he was shot close at hand. Apart from yourself and his daughter is there anyone else he would allow to get close to him, or for that matter who might have had motive to do such a thing?”
Born in 1842, his father resigned the title to him on his eighteenth birthday. Very sadly however his planned marriage to Miss Alice Olney fell through when his wife eloped on her way to the service! The disgrace proved too much and some months later he took his own life but not before fathering a boy Harry off another lady, a boy who would subsequently be raised as the son of his sister Mary hence preserving his potential right of succession. Tobias met his half-brother Sherlock when he was nineteen and the latter only seven, but left an indelible impression on him especially when he bequeathed two items to him in his will – his pipe and his deer-stalker hat. They became Sherlock's most treasured possessions; he had copies made of both and always kept the originals safely locked away.
“They will have thought of that”, I said. “I remember reading one of Doctor Watson's stories where someone had people in place to stop telegrams reaching their quarry. No, we shall have to go in person.”
I led the way out into the corridor and we hurried towards the rear end of the coach where there was a lavatory and hence no window outside. But it was only a three-coach train and the fellow would soon be just yards away from us.
“That does not sound much better!” I said. “Our friend says that is is something to do with an inheritance, but he would prefer to discuss it in person if we can come.”
He really should have. I know that I was the blood Buckingham and he was adopted, but Father had always made it clear that he treated us as equals, even if I had been the one who was originally supposed to have inherited the family business one day. However my marriage last year to Sarah and the fact that she will inherit a fair-sized chunk of Morayshire one day meant that it had been agreed he would be the one who....
I let out a manly expression of surprise as my blue-eyed genius somehow managed to materialize right next to me, and glared at him.
I duly came again, this time more feebly but catching him across the face. He grinned at me then removed it and began to rub it into his skin scenting himself from me.
As the huge man broke down again I thought of how lucky I was that, unlike poor Luke, I had never had to make that terrible decision. Of course I would have given John up if he had found greater happiness elsewhere, but it would surely have killed me.
He followed me through to the main room in silence. We sat down opposite each other. His gaze had dropped some way below what was anywhere near appropriate.
“An essential part of her plans is that the attack has to take place on a Saturday. It is here however that she has her first piece of bad luck. Perhaps nettled by her temporary beau's happiness at his success, she makes a comment about his overly long hair and he decides to cut it without telling her. The lion loses his mane on Friday, the consequences of which will shortly become clear.”
1911. Sherlock 'forgets his keys', the duo meet up again with an even more exhausted Mr. Bronn Blackwater, and John becomes a grandfather – but he will likely never know his grandson as such.
I tensed and looked across at Sherlock who immediately got up and came over to stand next to me, placing his hand reassuringly on my shoulder.
“You're right about my mother, sir”, he said, “though my grandfather does live just north of Newcastle. His son whose name I bear was Lady Eleanor's footman and they..... you know. I was lucky that there are so few family members around just now; the old duke decided to keep me by 'as a spare'. Not that he's have dared cross my mother!”
This was so embarrassing. I did not think anything could make it worse, until Sherlock suddenly got out of bed and went across to his dressing-table, returning with a large glass cologne bottle. He sprayed a little on his hand and offered it to me.
“No you are not, John”, he said showing that freaky and not at all endearing mind-reading ability of his. “Get a move on old fellow!”
“I would rather have the conversation that we are about to undertake in private, if you do not mind”, Sherlock said carefully. “It is not something that I believe you would wish one of your valued customers to walk in on.”
It was damnable unfair of him to use The Voice on me just then, especially as Nick was right there cleaning the room and rolling his eyes at our usual ridiculousness. My life was so hard.
“Whatever it was, it seems to have come over our great-nephew as well”, I teased prodding Dane out of his trance and earning myself a sharp glare and the sort of teenage huff that could have moved mountains. “Since you have come all this way I am sure you that you can find time to stop for some refreshments, then maybe 'someone' can show you around.”
“I should also like to see the play beforehand”, Sherlock said. “Are there any viewings before the royal performance?”
“I quit after an injury last year”, the giant explained. “Thirty-two is getting on a bit for someone in my position, where we get the worst of it. When Ned had all this blow up he, uh, asked me to come and support him.”
“We would like to be there too”, young Trelawney Hawke suddenly spoke up. “Doctor, this is our grandfather who does not even know that we are his grandsons. Grandsons that he must have thought he could never have.”
I winced as I realized. At least Mr. Blackwater had been able to have rests while both his lovers' 'heats' were in remission. But with them now alternating.... poor, poor man.
I was still not seething when we arrived back at Baker Street to find a worried Mr. Guilford Holmes waiting for us. He did not even give us time to take our coats off.
“But she has now unwittingly made her second mistake. She resumed her appearance before Kettering but she forgot to resume her
I pouted and they all laughed. But Sherlock arranged a box of chocolate muffins for me to take so I forgave him.
“John is sixty next year”, chirped a certain blue-eyed genius who wasn’t getting lucky that evening. I glared at him.
He looked worried but nodded. The train was already slowing and we walked quickly to the very front. It seemed like an eternity as we waited for the guard's whistle but finally it came and we all but tumbled out of the coach, earning ourselves an angry yell from a passing porter. Luckily the footbridge was nearby and we were already on the stairs as the train pulled out.
I had several scores to settle with Sergeant Craig Whitefeather, and had I not been busy planning for my future happiness with John then his time would surely have come. And there was also his inactivity over my nephew Mr. Frensberg's problems which I owed him for. I looked at our guest shrewdly.
I may have let out a whimper of happiness judging from the faint quirk to his lips but he ignored me and carried on with his book. I frowned and moved to the side of the bed, kneeling down before starting to kiss his ankle which I knew was one of the spots that turned him on. He shuddered slightly but did not put his book down although I noted there were definite stirrings further up.
Throughout the first half of that year we had again been working on our still copious notes, in order that we could release more of Sherlock's cases to a general public still demanding them at a level that was exceeding even my publisher's expectations. Again the process took rather longer than expected and there were several that I was disappointed not to be able to include, but we still increased the total by a further twenty to one hundred and twenty, again to the benefit of our favoured charities.
The two gentleman looked at each other. My sense of apprehension only increased. I did not like their expressions one little bit.
Although the prices in this store were eye-wateringly high (and someone's constant touches on the way there were also making my eyes water!) I did on occasion grace its palatine floors as it was one of the few places that I could be sure to obtain certain of the very rare flavours of barley-sugars that my friend loved. Sherlock could easily have bought them himself but he knew that I enjoyed treating him to them and he always rewarded me for my consideration....
After all these years he still looked uncertainly at me when I said things like that. I knew that he thought nothing of his looks but it was like I had read somewhere; with some people the goodness just shone through. I continued to play with him and he smiled goofily at me.
Galleron Lestrade (born 1870) is the fourth son of The Great Cake-Detector (Mark One), and elder twin brother to Iseult.
“No”, Sherlock said. “One of the survivors reported that he stayed with him on the ship when they ran out of lifeboat space. Apparently they only had room for about half the number of people they were carrying.”
“By the way”, he said, “I have a case coming up soon on the sea-front at Marseilles. Would you be able to accompany me?”
A financier, murdered by Mr. Rupert Agar. He had evidence of the latter's illegal activities; Mr. Agar killed him in the back garden of his father's house, then hung his body on a tree that had been decked with presents to mark St. Oswald's Day.
“That is good, is it not?” I asked thinking that a day in bed might have its upsides. Provided that I did not have to do anything complicated like moving.
“Today Mr. Gable said that after Christmas he intends to rewrite his will”, he said. “I very much fear the worst.”
in short order. You will move out of the Hall tonight; do not take more than one handbag or these pictures –
“Tan?” I yawned, looking down at my nephew. I still thought of him as such even through there were no actual blood ties between us, and he had kept his last name he said to honour me and what he had called his 'inimitable mother of my mother's former husband'; he knew as well as I did how Mother would respond to anyone using the g-word in her hearing. It would be Pompeii and Vesuvius all over again, except a hundred times worse.
He was attending Sandhurst as an assistant to his 'preferred' fellow Japanese Riichi whom he loathed for his status and popularity. Knowing his preference for handsome men he tried to first blackmail and then murder him but was stopped; Sherlock offered him the unusual way out in order to spare his family back in Japan from dishonour.
Looking back, my first thought when it happened was that I had abjectly failed as a brother. Whatever anyone said, I should have seen the warning signs. Thank the Lord that things turned out the way they did or I would have found it difficult to have lived with myself over such dreadful behaviour.
Sherlock seemed unusually thoughtful and did not answer. Instead he led me back to the field in order to begin our examination of the area. The place was not even and the slope down to where it met the wood was a notable one, so I doubted that anyone could have shot the victim from there. We then worked our way along one side of the field without finding anything.
“He cannot get enough of it”, she said. “The local doctor has warned him about his weight, but when he accompanied his father down to Cornwall he brought back a ton of the dreadful stuff. I have insisted he purchase a rowing-machine from London and that he works out on it every day, much as he does not like it. He hides the stuff all around the house though – one of the estate workers even told me he had offered to pay her to keep a box in her cottage! – so preventing him from consuming it is nigh on impossible!”
“Heaven does not leave quite everything to chance, brother”, he smiled. “Someone who was set to do as much good as you for Mankind – we decided to give you your own guardian angel, a wise precaution given your tendency to endanger both you and your beloved at every opportunity.“
1925. Technology continues to baffle, there are yet more new family members, and John's memory is actually not wrong as he is about to find out what lies behind the green door.
I could see how torn John was. Part of him wanted to see his brother and his family but part did not want to be separated from me. When it became clear that I would have to remain ‘on call’ for much of the last month of the year I finally snapped and had a blazing row with Randall, during which much was said that should not have been said. He accused me of putting my own interests first and I reminded him of the many times that I had helped him out at my own expense and often at danger to my own person. It ended with me forcibly removing him from Baker Street and telling him not to show his face there ever again no matter what. I do not think that I have ever been so angry with him, and given his dreadful track record that said a lot!
A gentleman emerged on to the platform and I recognized my grandson who was immediately greeted by his nephew and led away down the platform from us. The first-class carriages on this train were always at the rear we had been told, so we would for once be travelling second-class to follow them.
“I have but two questions for him”, Sherlock said with a smile. “Thank you, sir. You have been extremely helpful.”
“For who else?” I asked sitting down very slowly and ignoring someone's seriously annoying smirk as best I could. At least there were some pieces of that strange but delicious new white chocolate on a small saucer by my coffee-cup; I had initially been wary of such a strange invention but had come to rather like it. Or at least not to waste it; those three other bars would have gone off had I not have eaten them.
“I shall have to wire Father and get him to check my room”, he said. “Those jumpers are wonderfully warm and I do not want to be without even one of them with winter coming.”
There was a certain irony in the fact that our next case began on the day that it did, October the eleventh. I had been reading in the 'Times' about the establishment of the Women’s Social and Political Union, a splinter group from the suffragist movement which had been pushing for equal rights for women for decades now. This new body promised – or rather threatened – ‘deeds, not words’ and I was concerned that the general movement (which I tacitly supported) might well be set back by such un-English aggression. Time would indeed prove me right; the new tactics would only serve to harden opposition against extending the franchise and it would be the essential part played by the fairer sex in the Great War which would result in women eventually and deservedly obtaining the vote.
“Maybe not all the way”, Mr. Dayne admitted, also blushing for reasons I could well guess. “Bronn, love?”
The policeman eased himself carefully down into our fireside chair, wincing as he did so. On the other hand some things did not change.
It was the summer of 1907 when our tranquil life was disturbed by the arrival of an unexpected visitor. It was June and, a little coincidentally as it turned out, England had just seen its first motor-racing track opened at Brooklands in nearby Surrey. Our caller was Sherlock's brother Guilford, now sixty-four years of age and thankfully rather less annoying. His marriage to Miss Petra Shepherd had turned him into something perilously approaching a respected Victorian gentleman which I supposed proved that miracles did indeed happen.
See it we did. Lieutenant Anderson’s fears proved less than groundless, and Miss Woodhouse made it clear to his half-brother that his skin colour interested her marginally less than the average July rainfall figures for northern Outer Mongolia. They were married at the end of the following year, emigrated to live near her American friend a few months after that and had their first child in 1906.
“Not the American ambassador in London”, I said. “The Straffordian ambassador for the Hawaiian Islands.”
There was something unspoken between the two men but I could not tell what it was. We made our farewells and left.
I got a bit of a ticking-off from St. Peter for arriving before I was due, but he explained that I had been given the Sight for the specific reason of keeping an eye on my clever twin who was due here in a few years' time. It would have been longer but he like me had prayed not to be parted from the man he loved for even a day, and without my advantages Heaven had very generously agreed to that request (although of course they had not communicated that fact to him). Like the painting which he had seen just before his retirement had begun, it would indeed be the eve of the war when he left Earth for the last time.
“I wish that you could come with me”, he smiled. “But Trelawney is your grandson and a most excellent young man. You have to be there for him.”
One day in early December I was busy decorating the cottage (and avoiding my lover's smirk at my wincing every time I stretched!) when we had an unexpected visitor. It was General Carlyon Holmes.
“You are referring to Tom and his problem, I suppose”, he said. “Harrumph! What business is that of yours, sir?”
I shuddered at such a horrible end and almost without realizing it ran over to Sherlock, who wrapped his dressing-gown around us both and held me tight. I shivered, the warmth of my personal human heater for once not enough to keep me warm.
I think that that is a very wise decision”, I said. “I have taken the presumption to arrange for Mr. Ireland to call here this afternoon, should you wish to put certain arrangements in place. Thank you for seeing me, sir. Good day.”
For the first time in two years we came to London for a long visit, mainly to see two new establishments; a plush new department store called Selfridge's and the new Victoria & Albert Museum. I had always thought that the museum was one of the greatest Victorian contributions to society, enabling people to learn about different things in peace and tranquillity. That was also the year of the famous (or infamous) People's Budget, the first to levy large taxes on the wealthy. Personally I thought that this was a bad idea, not because it would hit Sherlock's family (many of whom I had little regard for anyway) but because those affected might well depart for another country leaving England worse off than before. I also suspected, correctly as it turned out, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer the wayward Mr. David Lloyd George and his on-off ally the equally unpredictable President of the Board of Trade Mr. Winston Churchill were using it as a way to secure control over the House of Lords for their Liberal government.
I quickly examined the two bodies. Mr. Heston had been shot in the chest at a fairly short range as there was no scorching, while Miss Dallas some two yards away had been shot in the back presumably while trying to flee. Sherlock looked at the two bodies with that expressionless look on his face that told me he was hiding something. I knew him well by now.
This woman lived in Lauder with her husband in the country idyll which she had come to utterly detest. She was having an affair with a man in Edinburgh and, unbeknown to her, her husband had found out and their having insured each other's lives he provoked her into an attack on him.
Apart from Lieutenant Anderson the others in the picture turned out to be Lieutenants Bellingham, Feilding and Addleford, the last of these being the target of our inquiry. A week passed and although Sherlock did not ostensibly do much with regard to the case I knew that he was up to something. He was receiving regular reports from somebody by telegram each evening and he seemed generally satisfied with their content.
I may have coughed pointedly – several times! – before this Adon.... this only moderately good-looking personage finally let go of someone who had not exactly tried to get away from him, and smiled beatifically at us both.
“I am sorry for all this”, I said soothingly, “but it is important that you know the truth. It was your extreme good fortune that your lawyer is a friend to my colleague Doctor Watson, which was how I became involved in the case. I very much fear for your grandson’s future if he carries on the way he is, but perhaps allowing the uncle he hates to manage his affairs for a further five years might go some way towards punishing him.”
1913. A practical joker dies and bequeaths his beneficiaries some very strange items indeed. One of them is the lover of a relation of Sherlock’s whom he and John have helped before, so the dynamic duo head back to John's native Northumberland to try to unravel a most puzzling legacy.
“The landlady, ever eager to save a penny here and a ha'penny there, picks many mushrooms”, Sherlock said, “and begins to use her supply over the next few days. Almost immediately she notices a change in all her guests, notably in the loudest and most unpleasant of them. Being a lady of
“I do not believe it!” I said firmly. “Some dinosaur that happened to have survived all those millions of years found lurking in the depths of Loch Ness? Someone is pulling a fast one.”
“My father died four years ago and I cherish the facts that I made lieutenant shortly and had three sons of my own to secure the dynasty before he passed on. Except that in his will I learned that he left me a somewhat unexpected bequest.”
It was September and Sherlock’s birthday (his seventy-fifth), which meant that he got to pick everything that warm late summer's day. After a long slow and sensual start to the day he decided that he wanted to load up the Charger and head to one of our favourite spots by the nearby River Ouse for a picnic, which he had ordered from one of the great London stores to be delivered to the cottage before lunch-time. And of course there was chocolate!
He would clearly say no more, nor did I have the time to press him. I stood, shook his hand, wished him well and hurried out to join John.
“That was what you meant when you said that the two gentlemen worked 'around the back'?” I asked. “They work here and that gives LeStrade's grandson the extra money.”
; I wondered idly if he might go up in flames if he stood too near the fire. One 'accidental' trip.....
“It is from Mrs. Whitlow”, he said. “Apparently it got separated from the other items in the wash and she only found it yesterday so she brought it with her today.” His eyes narrowed. “That is odd. I do not remember her carrying anything when she arrived earlier.”
“That is unfair, sir”, I said firmly. “He is a good friend to you. If he had not besought himself to approach me for aid, you might well have been duped.”
“Once we ascertain the illness we can then decide upon the treatment”, Sherlock said. “If it is the mild strain then there is no risk of contagion; indeed that manifests itself as little more than a common cold, sometimes with a sore throat. But a blanched face like you describe.... that does
“This is about your certain ruination if you keep interrupting me!” Sherlock snapped, which was quite unlike him. “My time is my own and I am putting myself at risk by coming here today. Now listen!”
“I would have expected little better from cretins who think that standing in the street and yelling at people somehow constitutes a living”, he said dryly. “If you had any sense in those thick skulls of yours, gentlemen, you would know that this is
My nephew Jack himself had been ill at the end of last year though mercifully not with the horrible flu, and in one of those ironic twists of Fate which life is apparently fond of throwing at people that illness had brought in the lady who was to help him through the dark days ahead. A nurse called Miss Antonia Belvedere (Toni to her friends) helped my poor nephew through all his travails and I for one was not the least bit surprised when Jack subsequently proposed to her, their marriage taking place on Midsummer's Day.
Born in 1668, he was the second of five son of Jane and King Charles the Second. A dull, ponderous fellow, his succession was unexpected as his elder brother Charles had converted to Roman Catholicism and had then fled with James the Second during the Glorious Revolution just one week before his mother's passing. Stephen was at least able to steer the family through the turbulent times around the end of the seventeenth century if only by being too much of a dolt to get involved. His eldest son and heir Paul was a complete rake but predeceased him, dying in a hunting-accident in 1722.
Some time later we returned to our room to arrange our former bodies and I smiled across at my love. He crossed to the panty draw, opened it and waggled his eyebrows again.
“The play is called 'Before 221B'”, he said. “It is all about the two of you meeting in London three years before Bargate and solving the theft of the Crown Jewels. I know, I know; I feel much the same about some of your so-called 'fans' as you do, but our prisons and asylums are full enough as it is! The French president is an ardent fan of 'Johnlock' – I loathe that word as much as I know both of you do – and he has asked if he might meet you. Of course the King-Emperor cannot command your attendance, but the country needs it.”
The first few months of that year saw two events of interest, the first of which was the one foretold by those knowing ladies whom we had met a few years back on the Isle of Wight (and who still sent Sherlock various knitwear, some of which.... seriously, 'Bee Outstanding!'?). The famous 'H.M.S. Dreadnought' was launched and duly revolutionized naval warfare, but the inevitable result was an arms race as other nations scrambled to catch up; as the ladies had also foretold the most powerful ship in the world would end up barely lasting a decade. The other event was the first international rugby match in which England beat France, which I only mention because I told Sherlock about it one day, he dug out that rugby kit from Bamburgh and....... and I could not make it to church the following Sunday. Talk about a scrum-down!
“There is a small but fiercely territorial tribe in the south-eastern corner of my little realm”, he explained. “A micro-nation as they call it but like Arbir itself, strategically important; the sole road in from the Ottoman Empire passes through their lands and they do not appreciate anyone using it without the appropriate payment. The last time Imperial forces tried so to do, two thousand of the interlopers ended up dead.”
He got it in under a second, as I had known he would. That date, the one that he had always assumed was only of his son's birth, was now that of his daughter. His late daughter.
One thing that I should say here, especially since so many modern historians insist on claiming that Great Britain did not need to get involved in this conflict, is to remind the reader of German ambitions in this war which were later revealed to the world as the September Programme, so-called because it was drafted in that month. While our Nation would not have ostensibly been made to suffer as a losing party in Germany's then seemingly likely victory, Berlin would secure Belgium, cripple France, take that country's imperial possessions to establish an empire to rival our own, and with the new vassal states carved out of its gains from Russia would be poised to take us on on far better terms at a future date. Anyone who thinks that this war was unnecessary on our Nation's part is frankly a fool!
“No, that is someone else's job”, he said. “They are a good bunch, although what with all this anti-German feeling there was some muttering against poor Hal because of that African rigmarole earlier this year. Stuff and nonsense in my opinion; we are all Germanic if you go back to our Anglo-Saxon forbears and no man can help his family.”
I tried to make the described motion but ye... uttered a manly exclamation of surprise at the pain before blushing. It had taken me quite a few goes to grasp that manoeuvre, during which Sherlock had been grasping....”
I supposed that that was true. And I had seen in our Presteign case with Mr. Dai Davies just what the late arrival of the railway could do to a place.
I would have used quite a different adjective at that point, one both shorter and decidedly more Anglo-Saxon in tone. Mr. Benson squinted at Sherlock over the top of his round glasses clearly suspecting sarcasm, but as ever no-one was ever going to able to out-stare my blue-eyed genius. The director blinked several times as his eyes watered.
Master Colsterworth's arrival to Sussex had been arranged with his father when he had rather unfortunately ended up dating a young lady in Scotland who was in fact his half-sister. Hence Mr. Lannister had asked if we might find some post for his son who wished to become a mechanic. Fortunately the young gentleman rapidly took up with Beattie Turley, the grand-daughter of Mrs. Turley who owned the sweet-shop and always seemed to give Sherlock more barley-sugars that he paid for for some reason (yes, and to simper at him!). Luckily I was not the least bit jealous of our new houseboy's lantern-jawed looks or his stunning muscular physique.
“As we go forward from the shadow of the Great War, we know that we are at an important stage in the history of the world”, I went on. “Much criticism has been levied at the politicians at Versailles last year in that they did not invite Germany in to discuss terms but merely presented them at the end as a
The works that that 'inimitable' (God we so hope!) lady-writer gave the world. The world is still in therapy!
“I drive very well”, I said loftily, “although I have noticed that the roads are definitely a lot busier these days.”
“Dad asked me to stand in for him at the reception”, Ben asked, eyeing me shrewdly. “I think we both know where he's gone, don't we?”
“Then I would follow that up by suggesting to Mother that she pursues her most excellent idea of having you and Muriel move in with her.”
“We desperately need to speak with Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson”, I said. “I only hope we are in time.”
“We asked one of our agents in Berlin to check up on him and he has been gone for three days”, his brother groaned. “He has taken his passport with him. He could easily be here right now.”
The rest of the Sabbath was spent mostly sleeping, which John wrapped around me still occasionally growling about tolerably passable-looking Cornishmen who wanted what was his. I made sure that I only smirked when I knew he could not see me, but somehow he knew that I was doing it anyway, which made him cross. Which.... you get it.
1934. There is something long and monstrous (kindly get your mind out of that gutter!), as well as a new man at 'Elementary'.
of a play! Sherlock seemed amused at the young actor portraying him (accurately) as an untidy genius after whom I was forever cleaning up, but me? Hah!
Outside the station I was concerned to see that the three ruffians had followed us from the restaurant. I wished that I had brought my revolver, now in my bag at the local hotel where we had booked in for the night. To my surprise Sherlock left my side and walked over to them. There was some muted conversation then he returned; the three men hurried away.
“Hector always wanted to be in the army”, our host explained, “but he has something wrong with his principal arm which means that he cannot fire a gun. We played this charade for him, little knowing just what trouble it might bring us.”
I glared at my seriously unfunny friend. Last night in the middle of our fun and games there had been a small earthquake in the North Sea, and although it had not affected us, it might well have done given how 'someone' had really gone for it. Another pair of panties gone west, which meant another smirking postman a few days hence. Certain London shops really could learn to master the art of plain packaging!
He pulled me into an embrace and we lay there on the couch, both naked as the day we were born but happy in each other's arms. This was absolutely....
“How did you know that?” he asked. “There was only us the five of us there; I was not even allowed to have my Jumbo!”
“Before we proceed to business I must offer my congratulations”, I smiled. “I read the other week that your dear wife has given birth to a son.”
“Toby is a very open-minded boy”, Sherlock smiled. “He did not even flinch when he saw those trophy panties of mine.”
An unpleasant major landowner in Redhampton, Northamptonshire. He was murdered by the Reverend Dowdeswell during a historical re-enactment; the vicar coated the inside of his costume's collar with monkshood but Sherlock found him out, and he committed suicide.
“I was thinking rather the man who first trained him, Mr. Heston”, he said. “I believe that the two shots were
“I moved to London some years back”, he began, “and am now full partner in a successful practice up in Camden Town. This affair concerns a client of mine, an elderly gentleman by the name of Mr. Percy Gable. He owns a large property with copious grounds in Golders Green which is an important part of my story as it is in an area being scheduled for development. You may have read that there was a fuss over the new railway being built up from Charing Cross and Euston over Hampstead Heath which has only just been resolved; because of that there will soon be a railway station near the house† there which will increase the value of Mr. Gable's property still further. I understand that he has already been offered and has rejected several large sums for the place.”
It had been a long and trying journey from London to the Welsh March, especially for John who had been fucked about a dozen times and had had to have a sit-down at Hereford Station before he could make it out to a cab. Although his face when one of the porters had offered him a wheelchair – hah! Before we had left London I had had time to read the copious notes on our client that Miss St. Leger had managed to assemble in the short time available to her. Very interesting; they opened up several possibilities to resolve matters to the satisfaction of just about everyone. Except of course our deeply unpleasant client.
Named for builder William Baker who designed it and built 'Glendower Mansion' (221-221B), this road starts at the north-east corner of Portman Square and runs north-north-west for about a mile before it is crossed by the busy A501 Marylebone Road. Up to this point is it colloquially called Lower Baker Street. 'Upper Baker Street' or the A41 (Liverpool-Birkenhead road) continues past Sherlock's and John's house on the left (western) side of the road; at the junction just a few yards further north Park Road veering off to the north-west becomes the A41 while Baker Street continues only for another few dozen yards before ending at the Outer Circle of Regent's Park, where Sherlock and John often walked. It was very slightly the furthest of the four addresses from the Surgery at nearly 1¼ miles. In their time it was a high-class residential area but today it is mostly commercial. The Metropolitan Railway's station lies a short distance back down the road on the other side; they were fortunate that it only became a busy junction station the year after they left.
“Which given the poor visibility that morning implies a most skilled shooter”, Sherlock said. “And the edge of the field borders at one point on the wood where the shooting was going on. I need your professional opinion here, John. Would the local doctor have spotted that had he been allowed to examine the body?”
“Ask Mr. Leeds that question”, Sherlock said tearing a sheet out of his notepad and passing it over. “We are for the local railway station. Let us hope that Lady Luck is with is!”
Mr. Drake Hale seemed uncertain but nodded and led the way inside, although I noted that he kept his huge frame between us and his charges. Inside he poured drinks and we sat on opposite sides of a table, his son and his son's friend either side of him.
“I told Lowen that I would give a letter from him to his nephew”, I said. “He works on a boat here so we shall have to ask which one.”
I was also concerned for my own grandsons Tobias and Trelawney, now twenty-two years of age. As both heir to a large estate and someone who had just married Toby was mercifully excluded, and his father's reputation for fairness and honesty stood him in good stead in Wiltshire. But Trelawney was another problem entirely; my nephew Tantalus (in between moaning that the young nobleman was trying to kill him through sex and, for some reason, he understood how John felt (?) was I knew terrified of guns yet determined to still do his bit. As well as his administrative job (at which he proved excellent, as it turned out) I owed my friend 'Ginger' a great debt for his excellent suggestion as to how to sort matters, and several of his agents paid surreptitious visits to the Bourne Valley which were 'somehow' noticed by the locals and caused all sorts of rumours as to what important role that Mr. Trevelyan and/or his brother was secretly undertaking for the War Effort.
Closer to home we lost my cousin Luke, who had been ill on and off for some time. His passing too necessitated a departure from the cottage, and we headed up to London where my brother Guilford had booked us into a hotel where we could remain undetected.
I was so damn lucky! So I set to work to make sure that he did not even have the energy left to manage a smile!
“Day lives in a small cottage just beyond the southern edge of the village”, he smiled. “We all know how the dear doctor is always worried about his age, especially just now when he is in his fifties while the man that he loves is not. So this is what I suggest....”
“That is somewhat difficult to explain”, Sherlock said. “It concerns a certain photograph that was taken of you and two of your fellow officers.”
Sherlock was putting his clean clothes away when I came back from my walk later that day and I sat down to read my paper. After a while however I became aware that he was looking for something. I put the paper down.
“Stealing clothes?” he grinned. “Conspiring with the villagers to keep your 'crime' covered up? Openly lying to me?”
I was about to see such aggression in the New Woman first-hand that very morning. Miss Holston Radley-Barnham was about thirty years of age, dressed in what was almost a manly-like set of clothes and clearly thought a great deal of herself on what as far as I could see were precious little grounds. She was also American and like rather too many of her countryfolk did not seem to realize we were sat in the same room, not several miles away across the plains.
The general election in January of that year solved nothing; the Liberals lost over a hundred seats but clung on to power with the support of the Irish parties. Thus Mr. Asquith remained as prime minister and was still determined to force through the Parliament Act, giving the lower house supremacy in all matters. The king then promised to create enough new peers to change the balance of the Upper House and the Lords had to withdraw their opposition. Even the death that May of 'Edward the Caresser' – without whom to be fair we might well not have secured our
“It is very obviously a set-up”, Sherlock said as we drove to the police-station. “What sort of attackers mug a man, leave him unconscious but not dead,  then contrive to not search his house for the money that they were presumably after? Unfortunately the pressure is always on the police to find a solution, and less obvious things than that have been overlooked in the past. Do not worry, John. You saved him once before and we shall save him this time.”
He looked frankly constipated. He may have been aiming for pitiful, but he missed it by several miles.
“Mr. Watkin”, he said gravely, “there is a very strong likelihood that when he visited your shop that day the fourth man in that fateful photograph was in the early stages of a most horrible and deadly disease that he had contracted from the regiment's time in India. It has an unusually long gestation period – about three months, is that not right doctor?”
“Not more than a few days”, his brother said firmly. “The old battle-axe wants a visit, not for us to stand around waiting for her to peg out!”
I stared at him incredulously. My brother had died nearly three years ago, just after the terrible Abdication Crisis that had spared us from the vile King Edward the Eighth; I remembered the telegram saying that he and Victor had been found holding each other on a mountainside and the letter left for me, telling me that he would....”
“He is some distance away and we can hide in the corridor”, I said. “But he will likely join the back coach and then walk through; that evil nurse must have gotten him a telegram to tell him that this is likely our train. Quick!”
By the time that our guest left, John's pout was almost reaching across the street, especially after the prince had come and sat next to me to go through the details of our plan.
I have to admit that I had been surprised when our utterly useless prime minister Mr. Neville Chamberlain had finally if belatedly made a stand against the rapacious Herr Hitler of Germany, the scum who had gobbled up the Rhineland, his native Austria, the Sudetenland and the rump Czechoslovakia unopposed, and was now threatening Poland. I suspected (cynically, Anne said, but accurately) that Chamberlain had only acted in the belief that Berlin would never attack Warsaw because of the threat from Soviet Russia beyond it. But if the rumours coming out of eastern Europe about a deal between the rival vermin were to be believed, that theory was about to go up in smoke along with the all too brief peace after what should have been the war to end all wars - and which had so nearly ended me.
“While we are gone”, he said writing something on his notepad, “you could do me one extra favour if you would.”
“Be not afraid”, Sherlock assured him. “Your mother was merely concerned that you were making your contribution to your father's hospital bills by selling your body in, ahem, rather less desirable ways.”
I too remembered the boy, similar in appearance to the man before us but a fraction of his build, all knees and elbows as only a teenage boy can be. And of course the case, one of our more unusual ones (and there was plenty of competition for that title) after which Sherlock and I.....
The shop in question was Watkin & Sons, Professional Photographers. Inside we were met by a bearded fellow of about forty years of age who introduced himself as the owner, Mr. Edward Watkin.

Born in 1818 and the younger son of Lord Alexander; his elder brother Tobias had died in 1830. Sheridan's uncle Henry steered things through his minority, but although the new lord was a competent administrator his main failing was the ladies – very plural. He married twice but was rightly said to have been able to have supplied a football team, their opposition, the substitutes, the officials and a fair-sized crowd with his bastard offspring. On the right side of the blanket he did less well; his first marriage produced a son Tobias and daughters Mary and Elizabeth, while his second much later one produced a son Theobald. He resigned the title when Tobias reached eighteen in 1860 but had to at least nominally resume his duties after the young man's death in 1862. Around the end of 1853 Lord Sheridan had an affair with one Lady Aelfrida Holmes which produced twin sons Sherrinford and Sherlock Holmes, both of whom bore part of his name.
“They will rely on a quick victory against France, or failing that to seize its major industries in the north-east of the country”, Mr. Guilford Holmes explained. “They believe that the Russians will be slow to mobilize with their infrastructure still fairly poor, the Italians will attack south-eastern France and the Austrians will secure their own eastern borders. They also think, perhaps with more justification, that despite all we have done to prop up the Ottoman Empire they too might be brought on side or at least kept neutral. It is not so much whether they are right or wrong on all those but what the Kaiser
My great-nephew whined in protest and Sherlock made sure to keep the two apart as we all went inside. Ah, to be young and in love, happy and....
“She said four o' clock in the afternoon on the next Full Moon because that was the moment her brother was hanged”, he said. “When is that? It has been cloudy every night recently.”
“She may have signed up to rather more”, Sherlock said when I pointed this out. “The way that his elder brother is carrying on with all those married women of other gentlemen who keep getting told to look the other way, young Albert or his progeny may rule this Nation one day.”
“The telegram that came before we left this morning was from Carl”, he said, trying to pat down his impossible hair. “Or from Danny; he says what is left of my elder brother cannot hold a pen just now, the bad boy! They say that Mycroft did take legal advice on challenging the will but was told that he was certain to fail.”
Sherlock looked between the two women, and of course being Sherlock he got it. Which was more than I did.
“Then it is to the sergeant that we must address ourselves”, Sherlock said. “Mr. Delaware, may I ask you a somewhat impertinent question to finish? You do not of course have to answer.”
“The pilots normally fly straight to the landing-area by the Postmaster-General's house in Windsor”, he said. “But His Majesty is hosting a garden-party that day and the pilot has been asked to fly over so he can give the great and the good something to gawp at.”
“A lot of superstitious mumbo-jumbo”, Mr. Thomas Fleet snorted. “This is the twentieth century for Heaven’s sake, yet they still believe in that rubbish. Father has been trying to buy the field for ages but the owner refused to sell right up to his death last year. Fortunately his executors accepted a more than fair price for it, but of course the villagers then started whining that they had lost access to the Sands.”
I frowned. I did not like Mr. Patterson and I knew that he was friends with the sergeant, which poor judgement further devalued him as a human being. But the American was for all his manifold failings a deeply moral man, even if his morality like his patriotism had to be forced down everyone's throat at every opportunity.
“Reality conforming to the pressure of expectations”, my brother explained. “This is the special entrance; we have a second for most people and a third with a special trap-door for those we want to make suffer by showing them what they could have got had they been a better person before they take the long drop to the nether regions.”
“Father, my uncles and Chummy are talking about moving to the United States soon”, the young man said, putting his walking-stick aside as he sat down. “I wish them well, but after marrying Edie I am settling in London. We are going to name two of our sons after Grandfather and Chatton, assuming that we have boys.”
“I asked Mr. Leeds your question, sir”, the sergeant said. “He said it was the day before the attack. Apparently Miss Ockham did not like his long hair so he thought he would surprise her with cutting it. Like Samson.”
The only slight ripple in our existence had been the matter of my friend Lowen who, bad boy as he was, had sent me a letter to say that he, Solario and Salerio were thinking of retiring to the coast themselves some day, and I had got another very thorough fucking out of John as he had attempted to talk me out of suggesting how nice Sussex was. I somehow never quite got round to telling him they had in fact settled on Cornwall.
By my reckoning we had had four cases since our retirement (if one included the hilarious Bogus Laundry incident which John always pouts so adorably over when I remind him of it!), so we had three to go. This, in our ninth year of heaven on the Downs, certainly looked like one of them.
“Well we do keep such things, sir”, she admitted looking over her shoulder as if she feared the police were about to raid her premises for such an egregious offence. “But the demand for them is quite low. Indeed we have only sold one to my knowledge in all the years that I have been here. I keep the sales register so I can be sure of that.”
He looked at me pointedly. I knew from Miss St. Leger folder just what he was not telling me there, namely what the general had likely done in taking a strap to his own son at times. Perhaps a nice trip to the country for some of Sweyn's boys to help 'remind' said general what was and what was not acceptable behaviour. Some people could only ever learn life's lessons the hard way.
Retired and utterly ghastly ex-military man who was found dead in Remington churchyard near Richmond having seemingly been struck down by God. In fact the Reverend Ian Candy, upset at the way the newcomer was behaving, had thrown his aluminium crotch at him from his position on the church tower. Be careful what you pray for.....
“Our cultures differences can sometimes be played to an advantage”, he said. “I am sure that the likes of these bullies who torment innocent ladies and gentlemen while trying to force someone out of business for the basest of reasons, will not be among the most intelligent of humanity, to put it mildly. I also remember the doctor remarking on what that formidable lady Mrs. Maude Findlay once said, namely that when you have them by the balls, their hearts and minds will surely follow.”
of the two has a most striking effect. The unlucky person who has the resultant mixture in their bloodstream loses all muscular control for a period of approximately twelve hours, and the growth of their body hair increases substantially.”
“When Ursula came and told me, I realized that it had happened with me first”, she said. “June the twenty-seventh. It was just after the earl had fully recovered. Tom came down to London for the weekend.”
He kissed me long and hard and I could feel his erection even through his trousers and mine. He removed his and my clothes quickly enough and eased my naked form down onto the seat, pulling down the arm-rests to give me something to grip onto. To my surprise he slipped a cock-ring onto me, before quickly working me open. I groaned pleasurably as he pushed in, until he was seated inside of me and attacking my prostate like he was determined to destroy it. I wondered briefly if I could do as he had done more than once, and break the confining steel ring, but all too soon he was coming inside of me, panting with the exertion. Then he leaned forward and kissed me.
“Some people are quite insatiable”, I said innocently. Sherlock looked pointedly at me. I may or may not have gulped.
Sherlock's inimitable mother had died at the end of August and some members of his family had been as supportive and understanding as one would have expected (i.e. I had very unfairly been forbidden from bringing my gun to the funeral now matter how much I scowled). We had both needed an escape after that ordeal, so to mark Sherlock's sixty-fifth birthday he had treated me to a trip north further even than Caithness, scene of our adventure at Foulkes Rath. The war may have been over but the country was still reeling from the events of some two weeks ago when the German fleet which had been impounded in Scapa Flow (the large natural bay sheltered by several of the Orkney Islands) had been largely scuttled by its crews. That we had fought for four years against a nation with so little honour was not so much a shock, more a disappointment.
“My 'Bee Loved!' jumper that you got me from the Isle of Wight”, he said, looking adorably frustrated. “I did not take it to London with me as I feared that it might somehow 'inspire' Mother to write something even worse, and I am sure that it was in the pile to be washed that I left behind. But it is not here with the washing.”
I shuddered. John sending any of this to my mother was becoming a more terrifying prospect by the hour!
“The good doctor was fated to die shortly after Vic”, he explained, “and you would have outlived him by nearly six years. So Heaven 'averaged things out' in order that you could leave this world together. Talking of which....”
“All is well”, I smiled. “My grandson's staff have very generously made us up rooms for the night, so we will fill you in on all the details tomorrow morning.”
“My own gallant knight!” he purred and I could feel myself beginning to grow hard. “All you have to do is wait for me to finish this drawing so that we can have sex.”
of course) to cosmopolitan Brighton because some bastard had said that there was an art exhibition that he wanted to see. I had not suspected anything until we were stood in front of the statue of two masked men who were both quite well-known to us, Mr. Ettore West and Mr. Galahad LeStrade. Leaning against each other and with with little more than a bed-sheet that did next to nothing to hide... you know what.
“No, our local eunuchs have become wonderfully popular with everyone in the village and surrounding area”, Tantalus grinned. “Remember that deal I had with Cal?”
It was just over two weeks later and after a bright start to the day – for once it had been me leaving my beloved sleeping off a sex coma for which I felt quite proud – I strode(ish) down to the village to collect the morning paper. What with all the good food that Sherlock and I ate, I needed regular exercise.
“We have come to an understanding with them that works for now”, the sheikh said. “They are obliged to send tribute of some sort every ten years and also every time there is a new sheikh, so when my father acceded they sent two handsome young princes of their own dynasty to wait on him, Bill and Ben. He had them castrated and.... I do not think there is an English word for it but they were stripped of their names before being thrown into a dungeon. Ironically that was one of the acts that convinced people my father was some way beyond
“Miss Dallas made it home unseen and soon after took her regular morning constitutional, 'finding' her father's body. She insisted on no examination even though she was fairly sure that the local doctor would not find anything, or even if he did he would keep quiet and say nothing. Imagine her annoyance when the local vicar, whom she had likely learned was seeking my aid and had therefore hastened her own plans as a result, returned far sooner than expected. She had hoped to have had her father laid to rest long before we arrived.”
“Technology is wonderful these days”, he said. “Who knows what they will produce next. Maybe some sort of dildo shaped in such a way as to deliberately keep pressing on the male prostate, so the poor sap who has to wear it out and about is in constant agony.”
Some teasing bastard of my acquaintance had remarked the previous year that gentlemen of our moderately advanced age (shut up!) should consider getting someone in to help with the chores. This unexpectedly became a reality at the start of this year with the advent to Chuffingden of Master Nicholas Colsterworth, one of the many sons of the gentleman formerly known as Mr. Jaime Lannister, one of our friend Mr. Bronn Blackwater's lovers (although for some reason he persisted in using the term 'tormentors' in his shakily-written letters). Young Master Colsterworth was seventeen years of age and the image of his randy father who was currently augmenting the population of Kincardineshire along with his friend Mr. Dayne. And despite being young enough to be his great-grandson, the horny young bastard had within seconds of arriving here leered at my Sherlock! Harrumph!
“Ladies first”, he said. “Miss Alexandra Ockham, aged twenty-one. One of those aggressive, modern women; I would not call her a lady if only because she would I am sure take offence! She lives with her mother and two sisters at a house in Irchester close to the railway station. She has been dating Mr. Leeds pretty much since he came here in July. He was due to meet her at the station on Sunday but of course failed to show. She waited a little while then walked to his house and found it empty. A neighbour told her that Mr. Leeds had not been home the day before – I love nosy neighbours! – and she started worrying. She came to the station and we initiated the search that found him just under an hour later. It would have been sooner but he took the riverside walk home rather than the more direct route past the edge of town. They are digging up the road in town just now and it is very dusty that way.”
“Yes, some of my ladies use Mr. Frensberg”, the handsome young ruler said, “although I was not aware that he was a relative of yours. He is a most sound fellow, and I do not like to hear of his difficulties.”
“My ladies wear British attire when they go shopping”, the sheikh said, “and given the general uselessness of the police service in the area I employed a private company to track you down. That makes two lots of people in this country who need to learn their manners. Tom, what is it
Born in 1862, the natural son of Lord Tobias Hawke II but ostensibly that of Mary Hawke so entitled to succeed (although his 'half-uncle' Sherlock had to help ensure that). A quiet but well-meaning fellow, he steered the estate through the First World Wars and the increasingly punitive taxes levied on his lands. In 1892 he married his first cousin Alice Smith (Sherlock's illegitimate daughter; she somehow 'forgot' to mention her origins to him but they came out upon her death in 1909).
We had another visitor at the cottage just before Christmas. Sherlock's nephew Mr. Tantalus Holmes looked around the place and smiled before sitting down very carefully.
“I am investigating a lady who is – I am sure that I can trust your discretion on this matter, sir, madam – on the run”, I said gravely. “I should make clear that she herself has not committed any crime but certain people have, through a most calamitous alignment of the Fates, come to believe that she may have witnessed something quite serious and that it would be preferable to remove her from the earthly realm as a matter of urgency. It is highly unlikely that she would have come to
“I also have to thank you again for sorting out that ghastly woman who tried to blackmail our grandson”, the superintendent smiled.
Born in 1622 as Freewill Hawke to a Puritan family whose roots were in Lincolnshire but who were already in the Bourne Valley, their current home in Wiltshire. He took his new name at the start of the English Civil War in 1642 when he left the family home. His father and elder brother both died in the Battle of Langport (1645) and as a Royalist he was debarred from inheriting, the lands being seized by Parliament. He assisted the future King Charles the Second's flight after the disastrous Battle of Worcester in 1651 and regained the family lands on the Restoration in 1660 due to the timely (possibly too timely?) death of the new owner. After his daughter Jane became the king's mistress he was elevated to a lordship.
Which was why he had to steady his breathing just moments before we met Mr. Derek Hale – and Mr. Scott McCall, late of His Majesty's Loyal Shropshire Regiment.
When you love someone as much as I loved Vic, the one cloud that always lurks in the blue skies of your happiness is what will happen when, inevitably, one of you gets taken before the other. Fortunately having the Sight enabled me to prepare for and effectively counter that, especially when my love, despite having just passed eighty, decided on a long walk up the steep hill near our home. I knew what that would do to him so I insisted on going with him, and when his brave heart gave out having made the summit, I lay there with him and waited for the final sleep to claim us both. Which it did.
Typically the weather now decided to frustrate my plans, the squally December rains continuing all day which meant that it would take a long time for the jumper to dry properly. I spent some time in the village tavern but when I returned to Mrs. Smith, she told me that it would not be dry until the following day. So I had to return without it.
I gulped. Still, at least I would get some release from the intense pressure down.... oh Lord no! He could not be that cruel!
“Our Mr. Dallas”, the constable said. “Found shot dead in the field this morning right by the Mazarin Stone.”
wearing the frilly white panties which I felt ridiculous in at my age but so what?). We also had some of those new Crunchie bars which he would always eat in an obscene manner that would make me hard in..... come on, I was in my late seventies!
“What do you think, doctor?” Mr. Guilford Holmes asked edging past us. “It is basically a 'Johnlock' Museum. Your publishers rented the place off Mrs. Rockland after you moved out and they also took Room Four for someone to keep an eye on the place. Her, ahem, copious family takes up all the other rooms. People want to see where the great Mr. Sherlock Holmes solved all those cases you wrote about; some even pay to spend the night here then come away with a commemorative certificate.”
1905. There is a delicious new type of chocolate bar for John to enjoy, a trip to London that looks to the future rather than the past, and a six-course meal that proves one course too many for someone eminently unmissable.
It hardly seemed possible that it was over twenty years since I had been waiting at Tweedmouth Station, a train had pulled in, and the most perfect example of manhood filling his own railway uniform like a Greek god had stepped out onto the platform. My beautiful blushing Jumbo, now Sir Brencis Bassett-Evans, Baronet.
I nodded. Ivan must have cut his lion's mane recently I noticed, and he looked as miserable as I felt. Sherlock also looked at the photo, frowned for some reason, then turned to the sergeant.
“My unpleasant brother Mycroft is, like the late and unlamented Torver, bitterly against that idea”, Sherlock said with a smile. “He thinks that the franchise is far too wide already, although I assume that he has not yet voiced those opinions in our parents' house.”
“One shot was fired at close range; I found scorching around the entry wound and the bullet must still be inside him as there was no matching exit wound. But he was also shot at some considerable distance; I found a single exit-wound on his back. Judging from the size of the wound I would estimate it must have been from at least the edge of the field. Unfortunately I cannot say which shot came first although logically the distant one is more likely.”
Mr. Bennet was a cousin to Lord Tankerville who had unwisely placed him in charge of the Tankerville Club. He had turned it into a place where old men could physically and mentally abuse young (including underage) black men for their 'pleasure', but he was found out by Sherlock. He and his accomplice Mr. Blake were offered a choice; plead guilty or go to their lawyers and try for a short sentence. Rather unwisely they chose the latter; both men were picked up within minutes and then deposited on the streets where the men they had abducted came from – with the families of those they had abducted waiting for them. What was left of their bodies was found in the Thames the following morning.
The war was brought home to us rather too vividly when German airships bombed the ports of Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn that January. That the Hun would go after civilians was regrettable but unsurprising; we really were dealing with the lowest of the low. The rain of terror from the skies would continue for over a year as the damn Zeppelins could fly higher than any aeroplane of the time, but by 1916 the development of exploding bullets would bring these behemoths crashing to earth with their murderous crews.
I knew to what he was referring, as the Americans had recently and quite foully engineered the overthrown of the Hawaiian monarchy and seized their lands as a new territory. This had given them an important base halfway across the Pacific and there had been subtle pressure from Washington D.C. that they would really appreciate it if the British might end their relationship with nearby Strafford Island. To their credit London had responded with a very firm 'No'.
A black-haired valet who fatally conspired with Lady Antonia Moreton-Coles in the theft of her beryl coronet as she wanted a divorce from her husband. She had likely promised to marry him once her divorce came through, but she shot him dead instead.
However that warm October day we went there as per usual and found that the nearby farm was up for sale. The owners Mr. and Mrs. Saddleworth told us that they were retiring and had had an offer for the place from some developers.
I suppose that, for a man over eighty years old (a great age for those times) I should have been more prepared. But when I went to our bedroom that evening and found the man that I loved more than life itself lying cold and still, I broke. I knew that John was two and half years older than me and logically I supposed that I had expected him to go first, but now what? How was I meant to carry on without him? I could not, I just could not!
“A horrible fellow, Mr. Patterson”, he said. “Poor Peter had to call on him for a check-up one time when he was covering for the fellow's usual doctor, and he made him wait because he was in the middle of breakfast.”
At least it had been a good start to the day as we had been blessed with some good news. Ivan's son Luke who was training to be a doctor had last year married a most attractive brunette called Miss Sarah Wickham, and was now the proud father of a baby boy – my first great-grandson. And best of all they were calling him Sherlock, after a certain blue-eyed genius who had cried when I had told him the news. Sherlock Watson!
“You said that he took the train to Castle Douglas to connect through to Portpatrick”, Sherlock said. “He did, but then alighted at the first station, Crossmichael, and walked back here. It is but a few miles across country, nothing to someone with his stamina. After the killing he would have time to return to Crossmichael and slip into the first train of the day 'on the blind side', and of course with a valid ticket; my research revealed that those on that railway do not bear a date as they are colour-coded to distinguish between on the day and period tickets. A near-perfect alibi.”
The actors lined up on the stage with Mr. Cumberbatch and Mr. Freeman in the middle, and all bowed to the audience. Then a light suddenly switched to illuminate the royal box and everyone saw who had been watching them all evening, the audience rising as one to their feet. I assumed logically enough that the orchestra was going to play the National Anthem – but they did not. Because something else happened first.
“You mean that everything she told the constable may have been true, but that she did not tell the constable everything”, Sherlock said. “A sharp fellow indeed; in our long years of work far too many people have tried that trick. What was Miss Ockham doing when Mr. Leeds was attacked?”
“Greetings”, I said. “We have come from Sergeant-Major Jones. May we go inside to escape this shower and talk things over like gentlemen?”
“There is one thing that your nephew does not know”, John said to me as we stood on the northbound platform of an otherwise deserted Collingbourne Kingston Station in Wiltshire, awaiting the arrival of Lord Trelawney. We had not told my grandson that we were coming and we were well hidden behind some quite impressive station topiary.
“What motive could young Mr. Fleet have had?” I wondered as we walked back to the corner of the fatal field. It was almost lunch-time but a fog hung over the place blotting out much of the light, and the stone stood out eerily against the skyline. “Or do you think that there was something between him and Miss Dallas, and that her father objected?”
He slowly began to wash me down with the ivory soap that he still preferred, and I leaned into the scent of it. It brought back a brief memory of the time when that scent had been all I had left of Sherlock, those terrible years after Reichenbach when I had thought him dead, but that only served to remind me of his return and our happiness since and I smiled lazily. He stood me up and lathered me all over then held the soap out to me to do the same for him. Still neither of us was hard and I was not surprised. This, not sex, was what I needed right now. Trust the man with whom I held the closest of bonds to know that without my even saying a word.
“The gentleman in the picture is one Mr. Ennis O'Callahan, also an Irishman”, I went on, determined to not let him speak any more than was necessary. “He hales from the same town as Mr. McCullough so I suppose that they may be distant cousins of some sort, but only Mr. O'Callahan has the distinctive pattern of three moles in a line across his brazenly-displayed thigh. I saw Private McCullough and he was prepared to strip for me; he has no such marks. Mr. O'Callahan is, you should also know, distantly related to the Earl of Cavan who, I am sure I do not need to remind you, is renowned for his litigious ways. Had you accused even a distant relative of his, you would most certainly have found yourself in an expensive court case.”
“As you know I went to Arbir with Cal for the fourth time at the end of last year”, my nephew said sipping his coffee and still looking worried. “It still worked out very well; he had a lot of very satisfied wives, he and Elizabeth now have four sons of their own the eldest of whom, his namesake, will succeed him one day, and his other wives were all very happy with what they thought of as his, uh, performance. They called me something quite unpronounceable and Cal laughed when I told him because it actually meant 'he who waxes mightily'.”
“I shall be decamping to the United States soon so we shall not meet again”, he said, “although thanks to the wonders of modern technology I shall keep in touch. And when it comes to your final case, your last bow so to speak, remember something important. Not all blessings are good ones.”
A countdown of the authors' top twelve most curious ways of ceasing to exist, either for the way they happened or what ensued. Plus some 'honourable mentions'.
“I would like to ask something at this point”, I said. “Why did Private McCall choose to disappear so near to his father's home? Was it because of the general's discovery of the photograph?”
Ten long days apart from Sherlock and at the end it had been just too much to bear. When the telegram had arrived telling me that he would be on the first train up from London that Monday morning and indeed was probably already on his way, I felt like a little boy whose Christmases had all come at once. My brother put up with me for an impressive ten minutes before telling me I was being an idiot and taking me down to the station where he put me on the first southbound train for Doncaster (I could have just reached Peterborough but would only have had five minutes in hand and I had this terrible fear that I might miss the love of my life and have to wait even longer). Finding Sherlock in that compartment had been like coming home.
This house is as much my homeland as the British ambassador's residence in my capital back home is part of Great Britain. I can do what I like to you within these walls, and the English justice system will not lift a finger to stop me. As you have offended at least six of my wives, I am minded to do rather a lot!”
The lieutenant looked terrified at that prospect. I silently thought that he would probably rather return to India and face some of the fiercer native tribes there. Come to that, so would I!
Despite his brutal ending Mr. Holme, the excrescence who was paid by Torver Holmes to throw acid over his brother Sherlock, cannot be placed higher as his remains were found in either eleven or twelve places across the East End so his actual means of death is unclear (the number of places is also unclear because one part was too small to be officially recognised as his, although there can be no doubt that it was male).
1909. There is a new museum, a new shop, and a new conquest for Mankind. Sherlock and John are able to help out more of their friends, while at Westminster the political shenanigans continue as ever (see piscine creatures defecating in a marine environment).
“The Charger lives!” I all but shouted. I made to open the door only to find a restraining hand on my wrist.
“Gentlemen”, Sherlock said firmly, “I think that we are achieving little out here other than to get soused by your Stewartry weather. May I suggest that we adjourn to somewhere drier, and we can discuss what has happened? Also  for the doctor to examine the body.”
