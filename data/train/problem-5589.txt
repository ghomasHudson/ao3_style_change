Tony, careful not to touch the gun, pointed out each and every feature, carefully explaining how to use it with a patience he didn't usually have. If it had been anyone else, he'd have made Bruce do it, but it was Steve, and Tony was going to make damn sure that the blonde understood everything. "You don't need full power to do what needs to be done. Just about fifty percent. Just a few seconds. We don’t-" Tony's voice shook and faded into an odd half-sigh, half-whimper as he tried to get control of his emotions. "We don't know what, exactly, it'll do to you." He glanced up, looking lost. "Or how much you'll be able to take."
"Just part of it," Steve assured, feeling giddy with relief. He felt a touch on his shoulder and finally turned to see Pepper smiling kindly down at him.
"We could have Jarvis tell them," Bruce decided with a smile. He doubted that Coulson, Nat, or Clint would come to the party. They'd all likely had enough of the god. He wondered if Scott and Logan would allow themselves to be dragged into it, as well. "I don't want to give them a guilt trip. Just see who shows up. We can even invite Ward and May since they definitely pulled their weight on this one. I guess if nothing else, the three of us could have a quiet night of popcorn and high fantasy. And actually going to sleep and not waking up until we're done."
The glance in his direction had set his nerves and temper on edge. How much did Steve know? Clint knew that Fury kept Rogers briefed on most goings-on, but wondered just how much of his own fuck-ups had been transmitted and in what detail. "I'm fine," he grated raggedly, looking more raw than he really should have. He was still rubbing at his wrists, grateful to have the cuffs off. "I'm not broken. Fury's just being his usual paranoid self." Realizing that Steve could've just been sympathizing based on Nat's predicament, Clint's expression softened faintly. "Nat's doing a bit better. I don't know if she's getting used to being in pain or if it's backing off some, though."
"We're the exception to the rule," Coulson agreed with a warm smile. He loved the act of just settling in and enjoying their time together. It was a gentler side of Clint than the one he knew, and it was fantastic to see it. Compelling as Clint's usual brash manner was - it had, after all, been what caught his eye to start with - it was also nice to know they could share slow, lazy nights at home too. "I think we already knew that after the club. I'm fairly certain that was at least part ambush."
"He's alive! Oh, this..." Jemma could think of no other way to express how she felt but with a broad smile.
Tony couldn't deny how odd it was to pull Steve against him and have the man's head resting against his chest, but he gladly gathered his lover close, hooking his chin protectively over Steve's head. "I'll even throw in an extra minute since you're a regular customer," Tony said, pressing a kiss to blonde hair. Tony realized after a minute that he was so desperate to make sure Steve was comfortable that he was scared to death of doing or saying the wrong thing, of hurting or upsetting Steve. Trying to calm his nerves, Tony offered, "I can make an omelette. Or pancakes. I think I've got some sandwich materials around, too."
"Next date was dinner, anyway," Bruce reminded her, winking over his mug of coffee. He glanced towards Fitz, wondering if the engineer was deliberately giving them space or really just absorbed in what he was doing. "Besides, I'm interested to see what we get and talk it over." And he wanted to see Jemma's eyes light up. "You know, they caught Loki. Guess that means I get to watch you two scare him."
Though it wasn't a surprise, Natasha still felt her stomach roll at the confession, at the tears and the way Clint leaned into Phil like he was the only person in the world who could fix it all. She rose and moved over to kneel in front of Clint, taking the hand that wasn't desperately wrapped around Phil's. Even as she'd moved, their handler had wrapped an arm around Clint's shoulders, pulling him in close. "It isn't your fault. Either of you," she added with a sober glance at Phil. Despite the man remaining slightly more controlled on the outside, she hadn't missed the tremor of the man's hands as Clint spoke or the glossy sheen in his eyes.
That was all it took to get the blood flowing soundly south of Phil's belt. He took a slow breath on and let it out before he trusted himself to speak. "I think I'll take a rain check. I’d like next time to be just for us." He still found himself wondering if Fury had seen the security footage yet and hoping not. He still had to look the man in the eye later.
Victor looked entirely calm about the threat. "Maybe you're bein' too indirect?" he suggested. He actually smirked faintly at the sharp look he got from the god. "I mean, elaborate plans are great, but maybe you should just kill a few of 'em. Or some good ol' fashioned torture. I could help with that. I'm good at it," he said, smirking. "Especially that little shit agent of theirs and his pet archer. Or the little bastard in the tin can. Like to see how he'll do without his spangly sidekick."
"No, boy scout, I'm afraid not, given that you don't even know my boss." She glanced to the woods from which she'd appeared. "Why don't you come out in introduce yourselves." Turning her attention back to the group, the woman added, "I'm Mystique."
"Because I'm an animal and I was raised by wolves," Clint replied, giving Phil a smirk. He let the first batch of bacon crisp up as requested, then made some slightly soggier for himself as he started the eggs in a separate pan. Once he had a good pile of both, he shoved the food and a pair of cups and plates onto the bar and settled next to Phil with silverware and napkins. He let his leg press against the other man's from hip hinge to knee as he loaded his plate up and poured himself some coffee. He took a bite, then smiled fondly at his handler. "I like this," he decided, his eyes drifting back to his food as he blushed a little at the simple confession. "Feels good."
Logan wasn't sure how far Scott would let him push the limits, but he wasn't afraid to find out. The feral mutant slid his hand under Scott's shirt tail, teasingly running his thumb along the outline of the man's abs and then dipping a couple fingertips into Scott's waistband. All the while, his tongue stroked slowly along Scott's in mimicry of a far more intimate act.
"Love you, too," Tony murmured, his voice shaking. It still scared the shit out of him to say it, but he'd be damned if he was going to let Steve go do something that might actually kill him outright without saying it. He stole another kiss from the blonde, then let his lover help him back to his wheelchair.
"Pretty. Terrifying. Also, pretty terrifying," Bruce concluded. He shrugged. "It was really fascinating, honestly. I'd love to know the underlying components. It looked to be made of light, but it resonated like metal." He smiled faintly. "I may or may not have waited for the others to cross first." Bruce didn't consider himself overly brave. "Heimdall was interesting, too. He apparently sees everything. Like, everything, everything. I'm sure Fury's jealous."
Natasha opened her eyes and met Clint's gaze. "She should. Melinda May could kill you in your sleep before you even go to sleep."
Victor looked mildly surprised that he'd been taken up on his offer but was far from thrown off his game. "Y'know, it's a little disconcerting when you do that," he pointed out, but stepped closer to Loki nonetheless. "I was saying we could have a good fuck if you wanted. Assuming you do that kind of thing." Victor was still out on whether Loki was a real god or not but was certainly willing to believe he was from another planet considering the stuff that had gone down on the news.
Victor gladly obliged, releasing Loki's hips and digging claws and fingers into the mattress to give him purchase. He began pounding Loki with abandon, using his willing body with relish. He cursed and moaned with nearly every thrust as his climax built, until he finally sank razor sharp teeth into Loki's neck and growled as he came.
Tony was silent until Bruce nudged him. "Huh? Mm. Yeah. That'd be a good idea." He looked up at Simmons. "So you're smart enough to figure it all out. Look, I'm not planning to take one for the team, but if Logan doesn't want to or something just doesn't work out, we need a backup plan. We've gotta be ready next time Loki turns up. Like, *really* ready."
Clint was pretty sure it was starting to get weird. First, the PJs, then... "So, I have t-shirts, too, huh?" he asked, smirking faintly, his hands shoved securely in his jean pockets as he leaned against Phil's kitchen counter. "Keep this up, and you're gonna make Rogers jealous. And Stark and Banner, too. Pretty sure they've got some merchandise. Looks good, though." It really did. Phil was lean, far from the athlete that Clint was, but he looked good dressed down. Much less intimidating, much more the geeky guy he was. //Whoa, wait. Where's that coming from, again?// Feeling slightly confused by the random tangent his brain had taken, Clint focused on their plans for a movie. "Ready?"
As the silence stretched out and Steve tried to control the fact that he was blushing like an idiot in the wake of Tony's brief, simple gesture of attention, Steve finally found his voice, "You know, I admire you. Not... not all this," he waved a hand to the car around them, "but your confidence. Whatever you do, whatever happens, it's like it was always planned that way. Like you saw it coming and you were ready before it even thought about happening. It reminds me of your father."
For his part, Tony was awestruck. He realized after a moment that he wasn't really breathing as he anticipated the next move. //Gonna have enough fap fodder for the rest of my life right here// he reflected with a faint smirk as he reached down to touch his cock. He wondered idly if Steve was any good at oral and resolved to find out.
"He's relieved. And still trying to wrap his head around it, I think. Both of them are," Bruce said, still amused to see the pair so excited. "And you should definitely hold it over his head. If he threatens anyone, I'll explain to him why that's not okay." He glanced at Jemma, giving her a smile that he was sure looked a little dopey. "I don't suppose there's coffee? I could use some. Especially if we're going rooting through telemetry."
Phil shook his head, but he didn't say anything. Sleep-rumpled and bleary, Natasha looked younger than usual as she made her way out. It made him hate even more the thought of what they'd be doing that day and the brand new chance for all of them to get hurt. Just because it was part of the job didn't mean he had to like it. Clint's words filtered through the fog, and Phil kissed him again, gently, whispering, "Just be careful. I know it maybe goes without saying, but I need to say it, and you need to agree to it. Be careful."
Natasha stared back at the man before finally smiling. "Why don't you come in and let me show you how I like to play?" She even tugged down the zipper on her uniform. "C'mon... not scared, are you?"
Darien felt a sense of relief as well even through the awkwardness of the situation. While the brief encounter the night before hadn't left him feeling one way or another about Natasha, he could tell easily how Clint felt about her. They didn't qualify as a couple, but he did care what Clint was going through. "Sounds like good news."
Banner allowed the faintest glimmer of green to flicker in his eyes before he offered an oddly restrained smirk. "Well, I find that spending time around you raises my tolerance for trolling; maybe we could start with that," he remarked as they climbed into their plane.
"Oh, don't apologize on my account," Natasha drawled with a smile. "I like it. You two are adorable." None of her usual cynicism colored words. Instead they sounded utterly and entirely sincere. And they were. It warmed her from the inside out to see Clint being taken care of by someone who could handle it. Even shaken and haunted, Phil Coulson would always protect him. She would do her best to protect them both.
Scott blushed. "I... that... I didn't exactly expect to get off on that," he answered, sounding almost nervous. It was one thing knowing that Logan liked it, but it was still strange. He still felt somehow less than knowing that he enjoyed being debased like that. At least, he worried that Logan might look at him that way. All it took was actually meeting Logan's gaze and some of the worry unfurled. "Kind of finding a lot of new things lately."
"I don't think we want to play blackmail games, Barton. Somewhere I have footage of Natasha putting you in women's underwear. My choice of sleepwear is pretty far down the list," Coulson countered with a smile. He had no such footage, of course, but it felt like a safe bet to say it had happened. Besides, he enjoyed the fact that Clint was willing to have fun with him. He loved Natasha too in a very different way, but Phil would never have tried the sort of verbal sparring with her that he engaged in so freely with Clint. "You're just jealous because you don't think I have a pair with little arrows on them too."
Tony tilted his head. "I don't really do things on a specific plan. Well, not more than a few months out. Five year plans? Not my thing. Life plans even less so," Tony replied. He shrugged. "I've changed courses a few times. Went from being a playboy weapons dealer to a playboy superhero. I discovered a clean energy source." He hadn't missed the shift in Loki's skin tone, and he wondered what that meant for the god. Or for him. Tony had halfway figured on the blue going away, not getting worse. "I have someone I love." It felt weird to word it in the present tense, but Tony sure as hell couldn't bring himself to speak in the past tense. He swallowed hard, doing his best not to show the pain that thought caused him. "I feel like I'm doing pretty well," he said, dark eyes meeting icy blue defiantly in spite of the slight roughness in his voice.
"Me too," Scott agreed. He shifted and grabbed Logan by the front of his shirt to drag the man into a kiss. It started out soft but grew a bit more intense than he'd meant for it to until Scott finally paused. "Sorry. But, yeah, if he hadn't done whatever the hell it was both of you did, I might not have gotten you back. Or me." He stretched and shifted. "Want to eat something? I could use food that isn't delivered by someone who seems to expect me to kill them any second. That's surprisingly off putting when it comes to meals."
Tony's mind was still firmly in his suite with Steve when he got to the lab, and he barely said anything to anyone for several minutes as he settled into his desk. When Bruce cleared his throat at him, Tony looked up sharply. "Oh, uh... Anything new, kids?"
Clint nodded gratefully. "Your suite? Don't think I'd survive the elevator ride up to mine." He was pretty sure that if he so much as leaned against something, he'd be out like a light. He followed Phil gratefully back to the man's room, tossing his equipment and vest aside and crawling back onto the couch. Already laying down, he realized it was a bit chilly in the room, and managed to mumble, "Any chance there's a blanket? S'cold."
Clint didn't want to leave her. Not remotely. He also knew better than to think Nat would tolerate him babysitting her when he had something important to take care of. Anxiously, he squeezed her hand and kissed the back of it before he stood. "I'll be back later," he said before disappearing through the doors.
"Much better," Victor rumbled, pressing one hand and all his weight into the center of Clint's chest, holding him down as he brushed the backs of his claws against Clint's cheek and watched the man shudder. "Responsive." He glanced up to Phil and smirked tauntingly. "Bet I could play him like a violin, sensitive as he is."
Steve couldn't help a soft sigh at the words. "You're evil. Apparently I like that in a guy," he assured before closing the distance between them to kiss Tony. It was less tentative than their kisses the night before or even that morning. Against all odds, Tony seemed to really mean it, seemed to really want him despite it all. The implications of that, the thought of what he actually hadn't lost, left Steve's mind reeling. "Think maybe we can get you another science break tonight? I'm pretty sure it would be a rip off to get out of the hospital bed and then still have to sleep alone. At least a nap... maybe... a little extra time for us?"
Logan grinned broadly. He liked this Sif lady already. "Hell no, you ain't," he agreed. He hadn't even understood half of what Sif had said, but he was ready to break some faces, and knowing Magneto was involved made him that much more anxious to do so.
“Me too,” Steve agreed solemnly. He thought of what Tony had confessed and felt the taste of bile in the back of his mouth. Bucky Barnes was the best man he’d ever known, and he was beyond furious over what Hydra had done to him. “If they don’t let you out… I mean, I was supposed to, uh… to see Tony tonight, but we can reschedule.” The idea of doing that made him feel like the worst potential boyfriend in the world. The idea of not doing that made him feel like the worst friend in the world. “I want to make sure you’re okay, Buck.”
Normally Phil might have objected. Normally he wouldn't have reached over and put a hand on Clint's thigh just to feel the additional point of contact. The night wasn't normal and neither was the situation. He returned Ward's gaze, silently challenging the flicker of surprise in the agent's eyes. It was gratifying that Ward glanced away first. Phil let the tension seep from his body and closed his eyes, trusting May to get them back safely.
The pair of them were impossibly cute, and Simmons shook her head at the lingering parting. "We could do with a big of magic," she agreed quietly to Bruce as they all got back on task.
“Yes. Thank you,” Phil added as the man stepped aside to let him in. “I apologize for the lack of notice, but… well, to be honest, I wanted to speak with you while Captain Rogers was otherwise engaged. I want to discuss what you’ve been through, and the more your memory comes back, the more likely you are to remember things you may not be comfortable discussing around him. You may display symptoms that are similarly… distressing, shall we say.” Coulson took a seat at the kitchen table and gestured for Bucky to join him. “Sometimes it’s easier to talk to someone who isn’t a friend. You can’t disappoint the expectations of a near stranger.”
Logan shook his head. "Nothin' I recognize... Some high-pitched hum... Kinda irritating." It was giving him a headache as they drew closer. "Don't smell anything, though."
"Easy," Logan soothed, holding the other man tight against him. He could tell that it was a bit too much. He held Scott still against him, not wanting the man to start moving just yet, not before he'd had a chance to adjust. He took the moment to nip and lick at Scott's throat, to relish the way the man heaved for air and wriggled against him. When Scott tried to move again, Logan grabbed him firmly by the hips and held him down. "Not yet. Just need you to feel me for a second," he murmured.
Bruce sighed. "We're still working on it. But we don't have forever. The second Loki sticks his head up, Fury's gonna want us to try and chop it off."
Tony's eyes widened with genuine fear at the suggestion, and he reached out to grab onto Steve's shoulder, letting go a second later when it occurred that the contact might not be welcome just then. "Don't leave. Please, god, Steve, don't leave," he begged, desperate and scared. "I swear, I thought... I thought I was never gonna see you again and... Oh." He realized suddenly how it looked, him insisting on Loki being spared, on him joining the team. "Steve..." He shook his head, looking almost hurt. "Steve, baby... I didn't bring him here because I wanted to..." He reached out, his hand sliding gently to the side of the blonde's neck as he looked into bright blue eyes. "I love you, Steve. I did something stupid because I was scared and I thought I was as good as dead. Please... forgive me?"
Logan woke to the sound of running water. He stretched lazily and kicked the covers off, smirking as he padded into the bathroom. With zero warning for his lover, he slipped into the shower with the other man and pressed him against the wall, his lips immediately finding Scott's neck and working a few of the sweet spots there before he drew back and gave Scott a casual peck on the lips. "'Mornin'," he said as if nothing had happened.
Logan nodded. "Yeah. And I won't share the news, believe me. Just figured someone with a good head on their shoulders should know what was going on," he said, giving Nat's shoulder a squeeze. "See you later, darlin'."
"Damn you being so damn sexy." Steve nipped gently at Tony's neck and then forced himself to stop. "I'm gonna take good care of you... in every possible way. Though for now that's mostly going to mean meds and rest." His phone buzzed and Steve grabbed it. "Clint's in talking to her. She's pretty wiped. Maybe no visits tonight, so...." Steve grinned wickedly and pulled the covers off of Tony. "Still up for some fun?"
Scott blinked slowly. His mind was dimmed, awash with alcohol, which let him think in an entirely different - and ultimately less effective - way. Logan was still talking about them sleeping together. He hadn't gone running in the other direction at the mention of other guys. He'd just been worried about Scott picking up the wrong one. He'd been complimentary. He'd been nice. He was barely able to meet Scott's gaze, which normally wouldn't have been that strange but considering he wasn't wearing his shades for once was noteworthy. It all tumbled together while Scott sat silently staring. He knew he was probably making Logan uncomfortable, but it didn't matter for the moment. He needed to put it all together before he did anything. In the end, Scott gave up on thinking. Instead he darted forward with speed and coordination surprising for someone who could hardly sit up straight in his chair and grabbed the front of Logan's shirt. The kiss wasn't kind or gentle, and it was more sloppy than sweet, but Scott needed to know one way or another whether the pieces had all fallen together right.
Victor smirked up at Phil. "Drop the gun," he growled. His fingers tightened on Clint's neck, claws drawing pinpricks of blood. "I mean it."
"Stark? Too much info," Logan decided. He briefly wondered if the idea had been to get the three of them in a pile in the same bed. He had to admit he wouldn't mind giving Steve a try, but the guy seemed a little too conservative or self conscious to try just a fling. Honestly, the idea had merit. //And then I'd *have* to kill Stark afterwards. Won't be able to put up with whatever random commentary he'd have.//
"Good boy. You might be useful after all." Nat turned her attention to Clint. "Tell me what you want. We both know I won't necessarily give it to you... but tell me."
Though Scott was smart enough to feel nervous, he groaned aloud at Logan's touch. "First time with a guy," he reassured breathlessly, "not my first time. I'm good." He was more than good, actually, turned on beyond anything in recent memory. Scott did his best to relax so that getting things started could go well for both of them. "Believe me, I'd be broken by now if I was that delicate."
At the first sound of the buzzer, Coulson had groaned and pulled a pillow over his head. When he heard Clint's voice, however, he dragged himself up out of a happy, drugged sleep and stumbled over to the door. That he was wearing nothing but a pair of sleep pants didn't really occur to him. The part of Coulson's mind that was working wanted to be sure there wasn't an emergency first and foremost. He opened the door and stared for a moment. Once he felt relatively certain that Clint was alive and healthy, he stepped aside. "C'm'in," he mumbled, still blinking the sleep from his eyes. "Are you okay? Hurt?" He paused and tried to breathe through some of the fuzziness from the pain medication. "Should I make coffee?" Because if there was anything that actually required thought, he definitely needed coffee.
Tony cocked an eyebrow at the woman, pursing his lips thoughtfully. "He's fine," he said slowly. Staring at her contemplatively, he finally stood up and moved over to her and Fitz's corner. Tony checked to make sure Bruce was thoroughly eyeballs deep in whatever he was looking at before he fixed his attention more intently on the two younger scientists. "So, I'm guessing you two probably have access to samples and whatnot on it all, but... I don't suppose you'd be up for the challenge of trying to help Steve get back to being Captain America? I think he's kind of attached to the whole superheroing thing, and I really just can't tell him no these days."
Steve sighed as he started plating up dinner. “I will be, but if something’s going to happen, I’d rather be the one here. I can handle it better than just about anybody else.” Of course, Coulson had handled himself just fine, but Steve wasn’t really looking to get Tony worried all over again by describing the incident in detail. If Coulson wanted to disclose anything, he could do that on his own. Steve set Tony’s plate down with a bright smile and took the closest seat. “Like you said, I can look after myself. I’ll be just fine, Tony. Honestly.” For a moment, he slid a hand over Tony’s, his heart fluttering at the casual contact, “Thank you for worrying, though.”
"I should certainly be honored to say a few words," Thor immediately volunteered, his voice gentle as he finally settled into a seat near Steve. "The Man of Iron was a valiant teammate. I shall be sure to talk to the Lady Pepper about this." The god frowned, looking increasingly heartbroken. Perhaps even on the verge of tears. "Poor Lady Pepper. To lose such a noble warrior..."
Instinct overrode reserve and Coulson reached for Clint's hand and drew it away. He held on just a second longer than was appropriate before dropping it again. "Don't. You know we'll have guards present. You won't be one of them."
A trip to the bathroom and a quick reapplication of the salve from medical topped off with a clean, pressed suit left Phil feeling close to normal. At least as close as he was capable of feeling after what they'd been through. He emerged and hesitated for only a second before taking Clint's hand. He caught a brief look of surprise at the gesture, then shrugged. "I don't feel like taking any shit from anybody at the moment. I want to hold your hand. I may hold your hand the whole meeting... if you're okay with it." They walked out together, and it helped. Silly as it was, that small bit of connection made it a thousand times easier.
There weren't many moments where Phil Coulson found himself genuinely considering anything resembling running off and joining the circus, but it was hard to think about going back to work when the alternative was sitting out on the soft grass with Clint tucked up against him. "At the moment, I can't picture a lot of missions that would make me want to move." He rested a hand on Clint's leg, not pushing the boundaries, really, just establishing an additional point of contact. "This is kind of more fun than saving the world."
Steve recovered somewhat, mostly because he was starving. He ate in silence until he felt like he was less beet red and then ventured quietly to Tony, "Y'know we will be talking about this later, right?" He smiled in spite of the words, hopeful that he could talk Tony down from the ledge of even considering using the weapon. "Meanwhile, though," Steve continued more loudly, "it's nice to see you guys are getting along so well."
Logan nodded thoughtfully, taking a big swig from his beer bottle. "Yeah, I can see that, but that's the good thing about you," he said, chancing a glance at the other man and then just as quickly looking away. He couldn't quite bring himself to tell Scott why he liked him and look at the other man at the same time. "You're stable. You always had your shit together. You weren't out chasin' ghosts whenever you felt like it. And you knew how to think things through." He looked at Scott and grinned a little. "Y'know, before you were ass-deep in trouble."
Tony grumbled, opening one eye to peer at Steve from the depths of his pillow. "Feed me?" he requested, not moving a muscle. When he didn't get compliance, he grudgingly sat up, his hair a definite mess. The sight of Steve cleaned up and wearing his usual forties-style button-down was enough of a reward for getting up, and Tony smiled despite himself. "Okay, this is worth getting up for. A hot guy, coffee, pastries, and also a hot guy," he admitted, yawning a little as he looked through the bag Steve had brought back. "My favorite coffee shop, too." He glanced up and smiled at his lover, pecking a kiss to the blonde's cheek. "You're the best."
“It's one of your most charming qualities," Phil answered. He couldn't keep from grinning at Clint as they walked. He felt stupidly young and happy and honestly satisfied. The coffee shop was a hole in the wall - it literally occupied the space between two stores and was long, narrow, and had only a wall of stools and a bar as a place to sit, save for a single table at the front window. Phil let Clint order, then got a decaf herbal tea for himself before grabbing both and carrying them over to the front table. "It's a nice place to watch the city without being part of it for a few minutes."
Coulson bit his tongue just in time to keep from saying anything he'd regret a few minutes later. "I'm sure Stark would be happy to come up with a new design made out of some bizarre compound he fashioned out of toilet paper and dental floss." The beauty of Stark, of course, was that he could do exactly that. The man was an ass, but he was an incredibly talented ass. "In the meantime, we'll just keep up the moratorium of playing any teen pop sensations who surfaced after, say, the 60s. When we get back, you should grab your boyfriend and pretend the two of you haven't left your room. If Fury's mad, I'll take the hit. He still owes me."
Logan pushed Clint back, smirking mockingly when the man knocked his hand away. "Nothin', kid. Just 'cause you got compromised don't mean we're all that easy."
Bruce made sure to grab a hug from Tony and tell the man he was glad he was alive before he headed back to his suite. He took a few moments to put on clothes that didn't smell like the inside of a cargo plane and put himself back together. He knew he should probably be resting, but he didn't feel tired. Far from it. He was anxious to see if Tony's nanosuit had uploaded it's information once they'd gotten back to the tower. If Jarvis was on his game, it would have been. He was even more anxious, though, to just see Jemma and give her some good news.
Clint had been half asleep against Phil's chest when the knock had come, and he was still on the couch, really hating the idea of talking to people. Seeing it was Nat, though, drove him to his feet, and he grabbed her and pulled her into a quick hug. He glanced at Thor, who was holding Phil like the man was his favorite teddy bear that he'd lost months ago, and it was hard to suppress the instinct to pry the god away. Thor's bulk momentarily reminded him a little too much of Creed, and Clint had to very carefully will that impression away. Thor was definitely not hostile. He might have posed a little threat, though. "Uh, Thor... He's got a few bruises you're probably crushing," Clint said, trying to keep his tone from sounding like a death threat.
When Mystique made to pursue Steve, Hank caught her by the ankle and tugged her back towards him. "Now, Raven," he chided, "I think he might be a tad young for you."
Loki swallowed his pride and resigned himself to long days under the scrutiny of the man he loathed most in the world. "Understood." It would be worth it. It could be worth it. "Now, I believe Agent Barton is in need of some of my 'sorcery' as you put it, brother." He arched an eyebrow at Fury, silently requesting permission.
"Don't you dare," Darien answered, turning in Clint's arms and kissing him hard on the mouth. "Don't you fucking dare leave me like this unless you want me finding somebody else to take care of it." He knew it was playing with fire to even think about making Clint jealous - assuming he could be jealous. "You sure you're not the man for the job?"
Bruce's expression darkened momentarily, but Simmons' haggard appearance along with her words served to keep him from chasing her off. He was silent for a long moment before he nodded slowly. "Alright, fine," he said, reaching back to grab his glasses case and stepping out to follow the young woman to the lab. "Maybe... maybe there are some things we can try." He felt terrified at the idea of playing with the serum, but maybe, just maybe, Fitz-Simmons would be the key to making it work. Simmons was right. The Avengers needed Steve to be the Cap again. Everyone in the tower did, in fact.
Getting stared down had served to calm Tony's anger. Steve might have been hard pressed to claim five feet tall, but he was still every bit Captain America. It was never more clear to Tony than in that moment why Doc Erskine had chosen Steve. "Fine," he sighed, finally looking up. "Fine, we can do that." He glanced at Natasha. "And you can call your boy toy off."
"Not what I needed," Loki answered, working through a strong desire to reduce Creed to ash for being a smug bastard. "Not nearly what I needed." The instinct to kill Creed passed slowly, and he broke his gaze away from the mutant to give it a moment to move entirely from his mind. Erik would be less than pleased if he destroyed one of the man's favorite toys. "Asgardian weapons affect me differently. It will be days even with my not inconsiderable skills." The whole thing was humiliating and infuriating to the highest degree. "Do you have anything constructive to add, or shall I assume you're comfortable with the idea of me tearing you limb from limb to ease my nerves?"
Clint started to argue, then shut his mouth. "Fair. Maybe I could ask?" he suggested, pulling out his cellphone.
Coulson arched an eyebrow and stared evently at Clint. “I remember Fury saying something very similar about you once upon a time. Some people are worth the extra effort,” he cautioned. He understood precisely what Clint was saying, but that didn’t mean he intended to give up on Barnes. The man had been through hell and lived to tell the tale. “As for whether the arm can be removed, I don’t know. I’d like to ask Stark to consider the problem, but that… doesn’t seem like the most diplomatic solution. I’m thinking someone from SHIELD might be better suited. Someone less personally involved.”
The thought hit Steve hard, but he was too happy actually talking to Bucky to let it drag the mood down. He grabbed a stool and pulled it over to Bucky’s bed. There was one thing he needed to get off his chest to have any chance of feeling better about it all. “I’m sorry I didn’t come after you. When you fell...”
Loki returned to the man's grasp readily. He wanted to be touched, found himself aching for it when he caught sight of the desire in Tony's eyes. Mortal or not, Tony was lovely and pleasantly distracting. He groaned as he straddled Tony's lap again and their bare cocks rubbed together. "There's plenty of oil in that bottle on the night stand. I suspect you know precisely what to do with it." Their roles had been reversed before to accommodate what he presumed were Steve Rogers' preferences. Loki had other ideas, ideas that involved riding Stark until he screamed.
Steve nodded, too tense to even respond to the thought of seeing what the suit might have caught and been unable to send thanks to Loki blinking them halfway across the world. The trip back was tense and mostly silent. Creed was thankfully unconscious, but Loki's presence was enough to make them all feel uneasy. Somehow it was made worse by the fact that instead of snarking at them, the god sat in his seat looking almost ill. Steve struggled with every breath against the urge to get out of the suit. It was protection, safety, and they needed that even if he didn't want it as a barrier. Tony didn't exactly look fine, but he didn't look bad either, didn't look mistreated or miserable or like he was in desperate pain. He looked normal. Which meant that whatever Loki had done, he hadn't tortured Tony. Maybe he'd even helped him to be okay, and that meshed even less with anything Steve knew about the god.
Steve arched an eyebrow but couldn't bring himself to dress Tony down. Their relationship had changed, but Tony hadn't, and frankly he would've felt weird if the man suddenly started treating him like someone above the usual ribbing.
Clint glowered at Logan but stood down. "There's something off about him, Coulson. He's been compromised." The archer looked somewhere between scared and wishing he had his bow with him. //Not that it'd do much against that guy,// Clint realized.
"No... no, sit," Steve urged, already at the man's side and pressing a hand gently against his chest to keep him from doing himself any further harm. Realizing it was unnecessary and probably a bit too intimate, he quickly withdrew his hand and sank into the nearest chair. "Pepper got a good picture of the guy who tried to kill you. It was like he wanted to be seen... and..." He shook his head to clear it and held his phone up. He'd spent a lot of his time while waiting for Tony just staring at the image, sure that eventually his brain would come up with a really good explanation. "That's Bucky. I don't know how much of my file you looked through. He's... he was my best friend. He died. I saw... but he was there. That's him."
"Mmm..." Steve hummed his approval and leaned his head back to rest on Tony's arm for a long, blissful moment. Long nights of nothing but Tony and a roaring fire and no one asking them for anything sounded like a pretty perfect approximation of heaven. "Definitely. Can't wait to see Fury's face when we tell him we're both disappearing for an undisclosed amount of time. And that I'll be smashing my cell phone into a million pieces before we leave so he can't contact us."
"Oh, fuck, Logan," he hissed, fingers scrabbling at the couch. He'd been uncomfortably close to the edge even before Logan started. The unexpected heat and stimulation made him groan and gasp, his hips still only because of Logan's grip. It should have hurt with the bruises already dotting his skin, but Scott cried out in pure pleasure instead and came hard down his lover's throat before he had a chance to warn the man.
"I think we might owe her a whole bottle of the finest vodka I can steal from Tony's bar," Clint decided, smiling at the pink tinge still lingering in Phil's ears. If he hadn't known the other man, he would have missed those little cues, and he suddenly felt lucky to have a chance with someone he knew so well. "He still hasn't noticed his missing rum, so..." He smirked, leaning in closer to Phil, fingers lightly running over the top of one of his handler's thighs. It was strange spending time quietly talking with someone. It occurred to Clint that he hadn't even just sat on a couch and made out with someone in years. He took the coffee cup from Phil's hands and put it on the end table behind him. Still smiling coyly, he lightly brushed his lips to Phil's, then drew back enough to look into the man's eyes. "I think I'd like to just touch you... if that's alright." It seemed silly considering what they'd done in the club earlier, but the quiet, unhurried moment seemed to call for more than simply pouncing on the other man.
"Sometimes not being a big idiot's an advantage," Clint shot back, driving a boot into Victor's face and taking the second of distraction to yank at the releases at his waistline, detaching the vest from his load bearing belt. There was a loud crack as he deliberately twisted one of his own shoulders out of socket and slipped out of the vest. He managed to get his quiver before he rolled away from one of Victor's swipes.  Clint winced as he rolled his arm back into place but didn't even pause before he lodged an arrow right in his opponent's ribcage. "Phil," he grunted as he dodged another attack,  "do NOT come out of that ductwork."
Nat looked more wary than relieved at their presence. "I'm not sure if I'm in for a reprieve or an execution at the moment, gentlemen."
Tony was already looking at the two younger scientists. "Dumb and Dumber, I need you to get over your Harvard diplomas, or whatever it is, and dig up the arc reactor specs and find a way to hook it up to - "
Tony smoothed his free hand over Loki's skin, tracing a few of the lines as he wondered what the change meant. He nipped at Loki's chest, letting his nimble tongue flick against one of the god's nipples before he withdrew his fingers and grasped Loki's hips and his own cock.. He tugged at the god, guiding him forward as his eyes drifted up to Loki's face. "Ride me. Please," he added as an afterthought, his voice barely above a whisper.
Steve found himself torn between laughing and crying. “Are you... how are you feeling?” The man sounded shockingly normal given everything that had happened. He sounded utterly and completely like the man Steve knew.
The pace of the music picked up, and Natasha drifted a little further away. "Come on. I think we've reached the point in the evening where shots are appropriate." She beckoned to a waitress and had a tray of shots on the way quickly. "Jello shots. We're going classic today, boys."
Director Nicholas J. Fury didn't often look surprised. There were people in SHIELD who claimed he wasn't capable of it. In reality, he just usually had the intel before anyone else. Hearing that Tony had actually defended Loki from the Avengers, even verbally, was enough to leave the Director looking earnestly shocked. He glanced at Steve. "And you're sure it's him?" Getting a nod, he looked back to Tony. "Okay, I need to hear this one, Stark."
Bruce rolled his eyes. Leave it to Tony to troll people even in that moment. Speaking of uncomfortable... Bruce cleared his throat. "Uh, Tony, have you and the good Captain considered investing in some concealer?" He was pretty sure that Steve hadn't bitten himself shaving that morning. Four times.
Logan pushed Scott away, shoving him onto his back on the couch. Before Scott could protest or assume that Logan was rejecting him, though, the feral mutant had knelt between his lover's knees. Logan unceremoniously wrapped his mouth around Scott's cock. He knew the other man wouldn't last long at all, but he wanted to give Scott something more than simple touching. Dark eyes drifted up to Scott's face as his hands clamped down on Scott's hips and his lover's shaft slowly slid down his throat.
Bruce sighed, grudgingly dragging the phone out of his pocket, positive he was being recalled right then and there. Thankfully, it was just an update. "Looks like we roll out before dawn," he said, then glanced up at Jemma. "But I guess I get to finish our date, at least." He had to breathe carefully to knock back the edge of anxiety he felt at the thought of the upcoming confrontation. Letting the Hulk loose was on his list of things he least enjoyed, right under root canals, and there was added anxiety as well. "Looks like Barton's going to be bringing the hammer."
Clint was honestly surprised. He'd gotten the impression that Scott and Logan were actually pretty damn happy together. //Well, not everything's a happy ending,// he reflected. He could certainly relate to falling into bed with someone just for the sake of having some kind of connection. Even a shitty one. He found himself wondering if the bruises Logan had given Scott were really related to the man being compromised. Scott's question jarred Clint back to the present. "I... well, I don't know for sure. Guess it depends on what the docs find. But... I mean, there's a fair shot at it. And Fury... well, he might give the order to put you away even if the docs clear you. Hard to say," he admitted, taking another thoughtful sip of beer.
"But we don't know what," Clint put in. He had his war face on, but internally he was near panic. He still had nightmares of losing it and killing other agents, other Avengers.
Steve couldn't help but linger close to Tony as they got their food. The casual contact of elbows bumping and arms brushing together comforted him. It reminded him that Tony was there. "Would anyone mind if I stayed down here for awhile this afternoon? I brought my sketchbook."
"Fuck you, Mystique," Victor growled. The Hulk managed to catch him by the ankle and smack him against the pavement a few times before he clawed his way loose. He knew he'd survive all this and then some. That didn't mean he was enjoying it.
Steve couldn't help smiling at the scene. There weren't many people who would be that indulgent with Tony on a first meeting, but Logan took it in stride. He was well aware that it was something like watching a parent trying to put their unruly child to bed, but no one would ever claim that Tony Stark was anything but an overgrown man-child most of the time. "Thanks for not adding any extra perforations," Steve said with a smile when Logan rejoined him. "He's a crazy drunk, but he's our crazy drunk. Hey, if you need any spare clothes, I've got some things that might fit." At the skeptical look on the man's face, Steve crossed to his suitcase and flipped it open to reveal a few casual button downs and well-pressed jeans. "You could try Tony's if you'd rather, but I can't see you in a blazer."
Tony had been trying to keep himself busy. Constantly busy, in fact. Anything to stop him from thinking too long. He had completed work on a new prototype armor and started on upgrading its weapons system. Having given specific instructions he was not to be disturbed, Tony glanced up with irritated surprise at the sound of a knock at the door. His first instinct was to simply ignore it, then he realized it might be Natasha, and Tony thought better of it. If he didn't answer, she would find some way past the security locks and that would not be pleasant.  Abandoning his work for the moment, Tony padded across the room and answered the door. "You don't have to keep checking on me," he was saying mid-stride, only to stop, the blood draining out of his face when he realized his guest wasn't Romanoff.
Steve resisted with an effort the urge to roll his eyes. Tony came onto their prospective new coworker the same way he came onto women, and Logan was definitely in a different class than the girls Tony tended to sucker into bed. "I realize your past experiences with the government might not have all been positive, but that doesn't mean that working with us can't be. SHIELD is a little more... um... avant garde." It was the way Clint liked to put it, anyway, and it sounded as good as anything else. "Director Fury asked us to come and speak with you. We don't do a lot of direct recruiting. Actually, this is the first time since the Avengers initiative went live. That means you're something special, and that's saying something with the roster we've got," Steve added with a bright smile. To say they were a motley crew would have been kind. They were a bizarre collection of freaks and rejects that for reasons Steve would probably never understand were closer than any unit he'd ever been a part of despite spending so much time scattered to the winds between missions.
Logan climbed into the cab as it rolled up at the end of the alleyway. "I won't mention what *you* smell like, moneybags. Get your ass into the cab before the Cap and I throw you in the trunk."
Steve smiled back, expression sympathetic as he took the seat Coulson had vacated. The man slipped away as if he’d never been there, though Steve knew after spending so long at the tower that he would be somewhere nearby. “I’ll see about that. Think Captain America gets to pass out any get out of jail free cards?” Steve reached out and took one of Bucky’s hands even though it didn’t seem like he was in any immediate danger. It still felt better. “I should’ve made you come in after that headache you got this morning.”
After three or four tries and insistently rejecting Coulson's offers of help, Clint managed to get the door open. A little too drunk to care or remember to secure the door, he wobbled inside, tossing his bow on the chair and staggering to the couch. Quiver, field gear, and uniform still firmly in place, he flopped face-down onto the couch. He reached up and dragged a poorly-folded fleece throw from the back of it down onto himself, but didn't really manage to pull it out evenly or properly cover himself before passing out.
Deciding that he had probably teased Steve more than enough, Tony smiled and thanked the other man for the compliment. "You know, we're really going to have to see about getting you better acclimated to the 21st century," he decided, pulling off onto a road next to the coast. "I wouldn't mind teaching you a thing or two if you're willing to learn from me." The drive wound its way toward the Stark mansion which faced the roaring waves of the ocean. "It's a bit much," he conceded before Steve could remark on the home, “but it suits me just fine."
"I like it too." It was why he was terrified not only of the idea of Tony charging into battle but the idea of Tony charging off into battle without him. It wasn't a lack of faith in Tony's skill or his bravery or anything else. Steve knew firsthand that he'd do anything and everything to protect people. No matter how often he protested the title, Tony Stark was a hero through and through. Steve just wanted to be there. He wanted to be close. If something went wrong or god forbid Tony actually used the damn gun, Steve wanted to be right beside his lover. He wanted to be strong enough to take that burden on himself so that Tony didn't have to. "Maybe I'll try to come down more often when you're working on your suits. It's nice having some quiet time to sketch. Better when it's with you," Steve agreed, sealing the words with a lingering kiss that tasted of bittersweet grape.
Bruce watched the pair go. "Good thing they have each other," he muttered to himself. It was painful to see someone so strong suffering so much, and Phil looked no better off; he just hid it better. Bruce could see the hurt in the agent, though, especially when Coulson looked at Clint. He glanced at Jemma, trying to focus more on the positive. "So, you gonna be alright with Loki tomorrow? I'm sure Thor will help me back you up. Should be interesting." He glanced at Fitz. "You two get to be the first people on the planet to examine a living, breathing Asgardian up close that isn’t Thor."
It wasn't artfully put, but it was succinct. Steve nodded his agreement with the sentiment. "When it comes to Loki, he could be up to just about anything. It could be plain old head games, or he could be working with somebody else. Until he shows up, we don't know. We need to be ready for anything, and considering everything you've done, it seems like you're ready for just that."
The warm greeting and the real smile on Steve's face made Phil feel genuinely better. The man was going through hell, and he was still willing to spare what little happiness he possessed with them. "Thank you. It's very good to be back." Again he found himself on the verge of reaching out for Clint's hand and barely stopped. "How about we all get some food and reconvene?"
Bucky sank back into the sofa cushions, exhaling heavily. He pressed his fingers to his temples, massaging lightly. It did little to ease his headache. He didn’t want to talk about the flashes he’d seen, but Steve seemed so insistent that he reluctantly gave in. “I saw people… dying,” Bucky replied hesitantly. “I think… I think I was… killing them.” He glanced up at Steve, his eyes dark and haunted. “But… I couldn’t have… I don’t remember ever hurting anyone.”
"Oh, he definitely is," Natasha panted as Scott's tongue slipped inside of her and then back to her clit. "He's... done this... once or twice." She wasn't sure what was sexier, Scott's oral skills or Logan's hard body and strong hands on hers. The night was playing out better than she'd let herself hope, and they were just getting started.
"If you'll excuse me, I'm here for someone in particular." Quickly the Winter Soldier raised a tranq gun and fired.
Clint sighed and sagged back against the couch. "That's right. You don't do the girl thing. You do the manipulative spy thing," he remembered. He looked at Nat. "You've gotta tell me when you're going to use your scary mind powers on me. That's not fair." When she kept looking at him expectantly, he shrugged. "I... guess it never crossed my mind? I mean, he's the handler, I'm the asset. Sometimes I sleep on his office couch, and he makes good coffee. He's nice and all," //and has a pretty amazing bulge in his PJs//, "but I don't really date..." He said, trailing off self-consciously. The one person he'd considered dating was sitting next to him, pushing him at someone else, and he couldn't decide if he resented that or found it sort of amusing.
Clint shifted uncomfortably as he looked to Nat. He knew she could probably see his anxiety, even if most people wouldn't have. He started to tell her he was fine anyway, knowing that she'd take it as a signal to leave him alone if nothing else. He realized, though, that shutting out one of his closest friends was probably not the best route to recovery. "I... We're not. Not really," he said quietly, averting his gaze uneasily. He knew intellectually that he had nothing to fear from Nat, but it was still uncomfortable telling her. "Maybe... maybe we can talk when we have some privacy. The three of us." He didn't want Phil left out. The man had a right to know what was said and give his own perspective if he felt like it.
Bruce's eyebrows raised a little. He hadn't thought of it that way. "Well, strange as it sounds, that would be more reassuring than the alternative." When the pair looked at him, Bruce shrugged. "That being that Tony Stark has Stockholm syndrome and that Thor's even dumber than we initially thought." He smiled faintly. "But you're right, Jemma." He'd completely forgotten that he probably should have at least called her by her last name in front of Fitz. "If he wanted to get away or at least make sure he wasn't killed, he could have done a lot of things differently. Hell, he could have posed as Tony."
Loki sighed and ran a hand through the woman's flame-red hair. She shuddered, eyes still squeezed shut, but didn't lash out. "This could have been so much easier. I told you that fighting would only hurt you." He continued to stroke her hair for a moment and then rose. The Avengers would be less than pleased. Loki couldn't help but smile faintly at the thought. After what they'd done to him, the humiliation he'd endured at their hands, it was the least he could do to pay back the favor. "I'll still send you home, my dear. What's left of you." Loki cast his gaze over the Widow once more and strode away from the cell, not so much as glancing back.
Scott hesitated, glancing at Logan, then nodded more certainly. "Yes, sir." He didn't like it, but it made a lot of sense.
"You could talk to Coulson. He does field work sometimes, but a lot of his thing is coordinating. I think you'd still get plenty of work done and use your usual skillset without having to risk someone rearrangin' your brain again," Logan said. For his part, Logan couldn't imagine giving up the work they did. His life felt strangely pointless without conflict, but he couldn't blame Scott. The man had reached his limit, at least for the time being. "But I wouldn't object to you tendin' bar, either. 'Specially if I could get ya to wear a low-cut shirt while you handed me a beer. You'd get all the tips you wanted," he teased, grinning into Scott's hair and placing a kiss to the top of his head.
Phil's mouth was pressed into a tight line. He managed to hold himself together just barely, and only because they were standing in the hall. Without a word, he slid an arm around Clint's waist and led the man back to his room. The second they were through the door, Phil pulled Clint in tight and took a series of shaky breaths. "Sorry, just... I just needed to be here first." He'd needed to know it was just the two of them. He loathed the idea of sharing anything with a shrink, but he also knew the danger of coming to depend too heavily on Clint as the only other person who understood. That was stupid and short sighted. They needed to be able to function independently to do their jobs, and despite the danger and the risk, Phil loved his job. "We can try to behave like rational adults later. Right now I want to keep touching you and being close. It reminds me to breathe."
Tony's gaze had been flicking back and forth between the two, and it finally rest on Bruce. "Is there seriously absolutely no alcohol whatsoever down here?"
"That... that's what I understood as well, Sir," Coulson managed. The idea of Logan lying to them was one thing, but Coulson hadn't honestly expected Summers to be an issue. On the contrary, he'd hoped the man might help them to keep an eye on his former teammate.
"Steve?" Pepper had found Steve's room entirely empty, so the natural progression had been to try Tony's suite. Despite the fact that the medical staff assured her they'd left him safe and sound in his own bed, she wasn't surprised to find him curled up in Tony's, his face buried in the man's pillow. He wasn't asleep either, despite their assurances that he should sleep through the night without difficulty thanks to the pills they’d given him. It was the first time she'd seen him since the serum went on the fritz, but that didn't strike Pepper half as hard as the sorrow radiating out from him. "Hi."
Scott shrugged. "People only see what's obvious." It was true of a lot of different things. For a long time he'd done himself the same disservice, never really exploring what he wanted enough to be sure about it. He'd accepted his life as it was, no questions asked. It hadn't been bad, but it hadn't fit him in every way it should have either. "I'm not making any decisions about the future right now," Scott observed as he clinked his bottle against Logan's, "except that I want you in it."
Steve let out a long, slow breath. Tony had been trying to shut Fury up, but the truth was that he had a point. Tony doing lewd things in public was nothing new. Fury was mad at him. For once he'd let himself relax and have some fun without thinking about anyone's image - including his own - and it hadn't even taken a whole night for it to bite him in the ass. He supposed that for Fury and a lot of other people, his sexual orientation was a foregone conclusion. Captain America had to be straight. Steve rubbed his forehead as if it might ease away the growing sense of disappointment that the whole incident was even considered an incident. "If it had been Natasha, he wouldn't have called, would he?"
Clint looked up sharply. He'd been a mercenary set heavily against SHIELD when he'd been selected as an asset. If he'd been labeled a liability, SHIELD would have put him in a holding facility until they could decide what to do with him, which likely wouldn't have been anything pleasant. If Phil hadn't fought for him... "I had no idea," he said. He'd known it was a risk bringing Natasha back, leaving her alive. A big risk. Nat was dangerous, no one could deny that. That was why SHIELD had earmarked  her for death in the first place. Clint had always assumed the reason he'd gotten off with just a warning was that they'd convinced Nat to joint them. "Thank you. For keeping me. And standing up for me."
Though Clint shifting around actually did rouse Phil from sleep, he didn't open his eyes. He gave it a second, and soon Clint was pressed in tightly against him again, warm and apparently relaxed. They needed the time to regenerate.
Tony screwed his mouth up, trying to remain stoic while pushing the memories out of his mind. The thought of talking to someone about what had happened made him feel sick all over again. "Well, you'll have to forgive me, but somehow I don't believe that," he murmured, tossing the bottled water he'd been handling across the room. Tony scored an impromptu goal when the bottle landed in a waste paper basket. "Right now I don't think I'll ever be able to talk about... anything." He glanced up at Natasha, almost worriedly. "Steve... has he been by?"
Fury settled back in his chair, then shoved a folder that had been sitting next to his elbow toward Coulson. "Sounds like it's time to clean out the Fridge," he said.
Tony smiled as he opened a can of organic tomato bisque and put it on the stove to heat. "You say that like you're the only one who was writing 'Steve and Tony' over and over in the margins their research notes," he replied as he squashed the grilled cheese into the pan. He looked over his shoulder at Steve. "You think they'd notice if I snuck you in with me tomorrow?"
In the meantime, Logan had no doubts to match Stark's. The shift in Steve's scent, the little skip in his pulse, the slight change in his posture: one of it escaped Logan's animal keen senses. The feral mutant knew now that he'd get what he wanted, and the animal side of him couldn't have been more content or confident. The idea of a chance at fucking someone who was his equal was an exciting and uncommon prospect, and he fully intended to take the opportunity. Logan let his fingers slip further between Steve's buttocks, slowly stroking at the man's opening.
It occurred to Tony, however briefly, that he was pretty profoundly lucky to have people willing to pull together for him. For Steve, as well, no doubt. Maybe moreso because of him. But it didn't really matter in the moment. "I love 'im, y'know," he muttered thickly, then took a sharp breath in, trying to gather his nerves. He looked first at Nat and then to Coulson. "Thank you. Both of you." His eyes flicked to Clint, still keeping his distance, hands in his pockets. "Even you."
Bucky gave a small grimace at the mention of Tony Stark's name. Although he remained in the dark over exactly what his attack on the billionaire had entailed, Bucky wasn't keen on asking Stark for a favor. He feared there would always be bad blood between them. "I think I'll just stick with this, then," Bucky decided. He glanced distastefully at the metal arm. "This is going to sound crazy," he confided in Agent Coulson, "but I wondered if maybe this," he lifted the replaced limb, “was causing me to black out and attack people."
"Good, then! We shall have to drink and tell tales when things are less grim," Thor replied with a nod. He turned his attention to Lady Frigga, standing again. He knew he might well be taken as hostile, but the sight of his mother so obviously weakened wouldn't stand unheeded. He stepped toward her, holding his hand out. "Mother... are you well? Did Loki hurt you? I swear, this time I will not be so lenient with him when he is found."
Tony managed to slip free from Steve as soon as they got in the doorway. "Oh, hey, forgot we had a wet bar--"
"Thank you, sir." It was a big offer, giving him that much control, and he appreciated the gesture greatly.
“Well, since I get a chauffeur out of the deal, I’m not gonna complain. Much,” Tony allowed with a smirk. “Take me away, Jeeves!”
It was a tease, but they both knew it, and that was just fine. A little teasing could be very nice when well applied. "I should probably note that the expansive permissions in regard to touching also extend to undressing. Again, with the provision that it not be done at the office unless there's a locked door between us and the world." He'd never been more thankful for having a private office. Never. With the shirt partially undone, the scar across his chest was clearly visible, and he caught Clint’s gaze lingering on it. "I guess there are worse ways to pick up new scars than being skewered by a deity from another world."
That brought Steve up short, and he finally shook his head and shrugged. “I don’t even know what I think right now.”
Scott tensed at the contact despite it being irrational to see the moment as anything but Steve trying to persuade Logan.
"Love you, too," Tony said with a smile. "I'd offer myself as a body pillow, but I'm told the reactor's kinda pokey." He pushed himself up as well, glancing at the aftermath of their coupling. "Yeah, we're gonna have some cleaning to do. And then some mystery stains to make the cleanup crew take care of." He pulled Steve in for another kiss. "Worth it. I like making you all messy."
"Not a bad plan. Just be sure you know how to use it so it helps you and not them," Phil cautioned, the desire to make sure that everyone around him was safe overriding even the strong urge to sink to the floor, wrap his arms around Clint, and sleep. He was about to give in to the impulse when he heard the sound of rotors outside and breathed a sigh of relief. "I think that's us." There was nothing but landing space around them, so there was no real worry about having to hike to the chopper. Phil gave Donna a wave and an additional, "Thank you," before he forced himself to let go of Clint's hand and start walking.
The feral mutant groaned, torn. He wanted to slam his mouth to Scott's and pick right back up where they'd left off. He also wanted things to be normal for them, and he wasn't sure that this was the way to go about it. The muscles in his jaw worked as he fought the urge. Scott's pleading blue eyes and his almost broken-sounding plea were making it nearly impossible to resist. His hands slid up to thread through Scott's hair, tangling tightly in the soft strands as if he was going to pull Scott away from him. "Scott..." He was painfully aware of the man's hands on his thighs, the scent of his sweat. He growled, whether in frustration or out of arousal was unclear. He leaned in, lips a breath away from Scott's before he finally withdrew, side-stepping out from between Scott and the kitchen counter. He realized then that his 'interest' was definitely still clear. "I wanna do this the right way. Not sure what the 'right' way is, but it don't involve you bein' drunk the first time around."
"That sounds good." Phil hadn't had time for any sort of structured physical activity in days, and he was starting to feel the absence. "It's too nice out not to enjoy it. Not quite ready to suit up and be an adult again." In the absence of solutions to any of their issues it all just hurt to think about. The light breeze outside smelled of rain, but the air wasn't heavy enough to suggest a storm coming. "I love weather like this."
As Nat relaxed, Clint sat up a little, unceremoniously wiping his mouth on the back of his hand and glancing at Darien. He gave the man a knowing smirk. //Nobody's that gay,// he thought to himself, watching his newest toy fondle himself. Nat in the throes of passion was a sight to behold, and being anything like human was qualifier enough to find the show arousing. He braced his hands on either side of her waist, but he knew better than to do anything too presumptuous. Instead, he submissively brushed his cheek against her stomach as if silently asking for whatever pleasure she was willing to throw his way.
Logan dropped his head, giving Scott an obligingly predatory look as he leaned it to bite at the man's collarbone. "Do I have to pick?" he rumbled. Scott opening up for him was more than enough to break whatever discipline he had left, and he withdrew his fingers rather suddenly, grasping Scott's hip. He leaned up, biting at his lover's neck, breath puffing against Scott's ear as he growled, "'Cause you're makin' me wanna do both." With a slight shift, he was slowly sinking into his lover, dark hazel eyes fixed on the man's face as he took him.
"Bruce isn't always gonna be there to save you," Steve teased in return, kissing Tony slowly, softly, lingering there against him. Weariness from the day was starting to set in despite his nap, and Steve drew back and turned the water off before grabbing fluffy towels for the both of them. "C'mon, dry off and let's get in bed." It felt like heaven when they finally climbed into bed, curling up against each other. "This... this is exactly what I've been missing. God, so much." Steve lazily kissed Tony's shoulder and his neck.
Bruce looked significantly less comfortable. "Guys, I don't think there's enough room in here for the big guy, if you get my drift."
"Mmm, maybe," Steve allowed as he melted into the embrace. Reluctantly, he leaned over and turned the water on. "I do need a shower first." Showering just to get more disgusting was questionable, but that didn't mean that it was a bad idea. "You need to do something about those suits. Sweaty. Also, I think every inch of me is bruised." He paused and allowed, "Okay, that may be partially my fault for being pretty bad with the thrusters." Even as he began to kiss his way down the side of Tony's neck, he muttered, "Saw your first go 'round with them, though. Comforting."
Logan's expression shifted to one of fear, and he pulled Scott closer to him, holding him with protective gentility that belied his aggression the moment before. It was his fault. He knew it was. And now he'd brutalized the man he'd set out to protect, as well as having invited some psychotic alien to muddle with his lover's thoughts. "Maybe... look, you don't know that. Maybe it's just me. I'll go turn myself in and... and you'll be fine, darlin'."
Logan gave Nat a look that was so full of lust that he barely seemed human even as a glint of humor flickered behind his eyes. Still holding her gaze, he placed another bite on Scott's shoulder, then refocused fully on his lover. He stopped thrusting almost completely, letting Scott writhe for a moment before he started moving, redoubling his pace. He growled, low and deep as his shaft pistoned in and out of Scott's hole, his hand clamping down hard on his lover's lean hip.
"Mmm... I hope so." The dream was promptly dashed by Tony's phone ringing on the nightstand. Steve reluctantly picked it up when he saw Coulson's face on the screen. "Agent? He's here. Are you- yes, of course." Steve offered his lover a rueful smile. "Phil needs to talk to you."
"Huh. Well, good luck to him." On the scale of unlikely matches, that sounded way up there. Scott smiled faintly to himself.
Logan tilted his head at Clint and then shifted his gaze to Nat. "Startin' to get a little uncomfortable, how you people seem to know more about me than I do."
Clint's arched back slightly against Phil to get that perfect angle. Clint was fairly certain that no one had pushed his buttons so easily since he was barely into his twenties, but the gentle caresses, the careful slide of Phil's tongue against his lips were more than enough to leave Clint tingling from head to toe. He let Phil's tongue into his mouth with a soft whimper, barely remembering where they were as he was lost in the firm press of his handler's body against his own, the fingers subconsciously squeezing his, the feel of Phil's heartbeat thumping a little faster against his shoulder.
Logan turned away so Scott wouldn't see him blush faintly but nodded his agreement nonetheless. "Deal," he grunted, stretching and listening to his back pop. //Stark'd never let me live it down.// Logan quickly got up and started tugging on jeans and a white t-shirt. He paused. "Though, uh, they might ask some questions if you tell 'em you're stayin' and don't need a room o' your own." He shrugged. "Though I guess you don't really haveta tell 'em."
Steve reached across the table at once and took Tony's hand. "Don't do that to yourself. I made the decision to go ahead, and I still think it was the right one. The serum gave me a lot of things. It saved my life more often than I can count and helped me get the tessaract away from Hydra, and it let me live long enough to get to meet you. Maybe I just reached the end of the line getting so much extra help."
Bruce raised an eyebrow, then shook his head with a smirk. "Well, hopefully we won't be doing any vivisection, at any rate. I think that might be a little unethical. Even on Loki," he pointed out. He chuckled. "Not to mention, I don't think I could handle all the complaining Fitz would do." He nudged Jemma with his shoulder. "I'm sure if he's still alive when you do get that close to him, his brother will be there to make sure you're safe. Or me." 'Safe' would be a lot more relative if the Hulk had to protect Jemma, but Bruce couldn't resist the impulse to be a little protective.
Coulson smiled faintly at that. The fact that Tony was composed and looked halfway like himself again did his heart good. If Tony looked like he was handling things, it meant maybe Steve was too. "You’ve got it." He spent a few selfish seconds bemoaning the fact that Natasha's return meant Clint would be with her for the foreseeable future. He wouldn't wake up to coffee and Clint curled up on his couch and the man's surprisingly adorable, sleepy smile. He filed the thought away to think about after pretty much never and pushed Tony toward the elevator. "How's he doing?"
Logan didn't take too much note of the random voice, figuring out easily that it was some sort of A.I. Besides, there were better things to focus on. He grabbed Steve and pulled the blonde into a long, eager kiss. When he withdrew, he grinned and opened his mouth to give the man a compliment when a blue glow caught his attention. "Woah... What the hell...?"
Though he had taken the SHIELD agents who greeted them up on their offer of new clothes, in the end Scott had changed into a comfy pair of pants and kept Logan's t-shirt on. It felt more comfortable somehow. "Finished," he informed Logan when he emerged into the sitting room of what he presumed was Logan's personal suite. The whole place was pretty posh. From what Scott could tell, everybody had their own living area for the most part with a communal floor for meals and meetings. It didn't seem like Logan's kind of place at all, and yet he read a sort of comfort in the man that he'd never seen at the mansion. //Comfort isn't always about the place.// "Like I said, just let me know if they're not clear on anything, but I think I got it all."
"Let's make this interesting. We play a round of I've Never Ever. I say something I've done, and if either of you have, you do a shot, then you say something... basically until we're too drunk to remember how to form sentences," Natasha explained. She got a nod of approval from Scott and thought it through. "I've never fought in an actual war."
Though the god deflated visibly, he nodded just the same. "The offer stands. I'm not going anywhere, and until someone is willing to trust me to do something, I suspect I won't be terribly busy." Less flippantly, he added, "I owe a debt to all of you. You may come to me with any need you see fit."
Clint gave Nat a look when she implied that Logan might have to take the keys from him, then grinned a little, his eyes watching her every move. He was a little disappointed when she left shotgun to Phil, but he didn't argue. He glanced over at his handler and then glanced in the rearview mirror at Scott's question. "Nice, modern place. Not too loud, not too quiet. All kinds of booze on tap, good wings, and comfy booths," he said, easing the SUV out of the garage. His eyes slid back to Phil, who still looked a little wound up, as the vehicle eased out onto the street. "You better relax, or I'm gonna find some other way to make you forget what's eating you." He meant the threat in terms of finding something else to harass the other man, but he blushed faintly as he realized the comment could've been taken a lot differently.
"Not all of them, my lady," Sif assured. "You will find that there are many to whom we have spoken. Once Thor is returned to himself, all will be well."
"Uh, are you saying that in the sense that you're not planning to leave any witnesses, 'cause I think that may be a tad extreme?" He held up his thumb and forefinger to illustrate. "Just a little," he added as they grabbed their trays.
"Don't tell me you accidentally discovered porn?" Tony was only half-joking. After all, even typing in the most innocent words into a search engine could produce the most lascivious of images. "It can be a little tricky at first, but I have no doubt you'll get the hang of it." He finished his breakfast and drained the last drop from his coffee cup. "A shower's in order," Tony decided, straightening and getting up on his feet. "How about you?"
"Fuckyes," Clint breathed, powerful hands gripping Darien's hips and guiding them in a slow rocking motion. The marksman stared into Darien's eyes, relishing the eagerness he saw there. His hands slid around to squeeze Darien's ass, then up to his waist as Clint leaned forward to lick and then none-too-gently nip at one of the man's nipples. Clint was testing the waters, but it almost seemed unnecessary. Darien seemed to be begging for all of Clint's aggressive, dominating tendencies, and the archer was more than glad to deliver.
Clint gulped, opening his mouth a few times. "I... he... I thought that..." The archer felt himself panicking a little. It was stupid. And it felt even dumber in retrospect. "He seemed like he was alright. Just... upset. He wanted a drink to calm down, and... and then..." Clint ran a hand through his hair, trying to decide if he was more upset by what he'd done or the fact that Phil knew about it. Finally he looked up. "H-how much did you see?"
Scott hated the idea of Steve being hurt or even worse while they hid in his room. He sighed and ventured, "Think we should check in with somebody?" Given that the only people he knew in the place were likely to be at the man's bedside, he had no idea who to contact. "I don't know... text Coulson or something?" At least it would show that they cared.
Scott ducked his head. "Tell him I love him too... and that he doesn't have anything to be sorry about."
"Oh, no, I'm sorry, I believe you misunderstood the terms of our arrangement. You obey me and they live. I never promised to release them, though I may once Victor's had his fun. I'm afraid that much was already promised to him, and he's done everything I asked of him." Loki smiled, feeling more like himself than he had in awhile. Weak or not, knowing that he held Tony so firmly in the palm of his hand made him feel powerful in every way he truly needed it. He hadn't noticed that the pallor of his skin seemed to be blending more and more consistently toward blue, an icy cast that left him looking as if he'd just been fished out of the lake after too long underwater. "If you submit, they live, Mr. Stark. I don't let Victor tear our their throats or use their skin to decorate his room or whatever in the world it is he does with his toys."
Tony yawned, "You should get sleep, too. I mean, serum aside, you're cranky when you don't. I mean, relatively. You're still excessively nice, though. Even when you're... cranky..." Between the drugs and the rough day, Tony didn't have much consciousness left in him. Finally giving up on proving he was fine, he let himself fall asleep.
Clint tilted his head. He didn't like the idea he was thinking the same way as Fury. "Well, look at it this way: if Fury was doing some kind of crazy hocus-pocus to get you back, he must think a lot of you." Fury had called Coulson his 'one good eye'. That had been rather telling in and of itself. "I'm sure he'll tell you when you need to know. That's his thing," Clint assured, giving Phil a faint smile as if to reassure the man.
The archer subsided and flicked a glance at Coulson, wondering if the Agent had reported him or if Fury had found out on his own. "Fine. But then what the hell do we do next? Rogers, Banner, and the two of us are about all we have left. Maybe some of the X-Men if any are willing to help and aren’t already tangled up in their own shit. I feel like continuing to wait is just going to lose more people. Loki's managed to decimate the team worse than last time."
Curious, Logan kept his grip on Steve's waist but reached out to touch the device through Tony's tank top. He curiously slipped his fingers under the shirt. He'd only ever seen Stark in fancy suits that did a good job of hiding the miniaturized reactor. Of course, Logan couldn't help but note as he explored that Tony was in pretty amazing shape as well. His fingertips traced their way up to the faintly warm energy source, but then Tony shifted away a little, leaning in to press his lips to Steve's.
"Though perhaps an insanity defense could help my situation," Loki protested as he pulled his long coat on. He left the helmet aside. If the Avengers were coming in with guns blazing, it would do little good, and if he intended to surrender, looking more vulnerable would likely help. He took a deep breath. The reality of the situation was that if Barton had the hammer, he might not survive long enough to even ask for terms of surrender. "I'll leave the door unlocked. You're free to come out whenever you feel it will be safest. I would... I would recommend waiting until the Brotherhood is properly distracted."
"See, Cap, you're not the only one who's aged well," Tony said, reaching across and under the bar to grab whichever liquor bottle he could find and helping himself to its contents.
Logan nodded, tugging Scott close again and pressing a kiss to his neck. "Think they'll let me have conjugal visits? Not sure I'd be okay missin' out on that until they manage to set me right," he rumbled, pulling Scott close. He knew that he should have gone straight to Coulson, but Scott was right there, and that was damn hard to ignore.
It took very little to get him to the edge. Phil had been close since the first kiss, and soon he was gasping, his hips losing all sense of proper rhythm  as he let go of Clint's head in favor of his shoulder again. He braced his other hand flat against the wall to keep from tumbling to the floor. He came hard but did his best to keep mostly quiet. Bringing in the whole damn club didn't sound like the right way to end things. Instead Phil found himself letting go with an intensity that left him fighting to breathe and moaning Clint's name.
Everyone froze mid-swing. Except Hulk, who gave his opponent one last smack against the floor before releasing the trembling man to scowl at Thor.
Clint settled at one of the counter stools and shook his head. "Not much. Loki sent Logan back but still has Nat. Logan said he was going to send her back. I'm just afraid of how he's gonna send her back," he said, playing absently with one of the salt shakers. The lights in the kitchen felt unpleasantly intense, and he pulled his hood up with a grumble of discomfort. "Coulson seems to think we'll get her back. He usually knows stuff," he mumbled.
Clint closed his eyes as Phil's hand cupped his cheek. It felt good in a way that was almost surprising in its intensity. Touch meant a lot to Clint. While it usually meant either seriously hurting someone or just fucking them for the sake of release, true, tender contact was a rare gift, and Phil's hands were gentle and caring in ways that words couldn't express. "I can definitely do the not sharing thing," he said. It wasn't a hard decision to make. If Nat had been around more, had been willing to commit to him, the other partners wouldn't have been in the picture. Blue eyes flicked open and he smiled faintly, resting his hand on the back of Phil's and pressing a kiss to the palm. "Not as big a deal as you might think." He knew Phil had probably seen a parade of guys - and Nat - wander through his suite when he'd been required to keep an eye on him. He knew it'd probably be tough for Phil to believe it was that easy.
Tony moaned, his hips pushing uselessly against Steve's grip. It hurt his stitches a bit, but not enough to make him want to stop. The restraining hands pressing down on him were a strange turn-on. The thought of the restrained strength his lover used to keep him pinned made Tony that much hotter for the man. "F-for a guy that didn't get a lot of... practice... you're good at this," he managed.
Natasha whispered back, "Not much farther. We can drop down just outside the main room up here. Should give us the advantage of not being seen right away."
It took Logan a second to recognize Hawkeye. He'd only seen the man a couple of times, and this was the first seeing him in his SHIELD gear. Still more than a little irritated at having such an intimate moment interrupted, he didn't immediately put the claws away. "This better be fucking good, Barton. Don't remember givin' you the key."
Nat pulled away, but it was only so she could shed her shirt and step out of her jeans. Beneath she wore a matching set of lacy black bra and panties. "You never know when you're going to need to look good naked," the woman explained with a shrug before closing the distance again to tug off Scott's shirt. "Oh, very nice..." Natasha's soft fingers ran over Scott's arms and his chest with a smile of obvious pleasure. "The two of you are quite the matched set." Where Scott looked soft, gentle somehow despite his muscle tone, Logan was all massive muscles and obvious strength. "I suppose it bears asking ahead of time what you boys might be looking for tonight. Any ideas?"
Logan growled faintly, glaring at Coulson. "Thought I smelled suits." He flicked his eyes back to Scott, the same unsettling edge in his gaze as before. "His buddy's down the hallway." Back to Coulson. "Expect him to put up a fight over his clearances, or didja have somethin' else you needed to talk about?" he asked, pointedly staying between the agent and the door.
"But we aren't sure." Steve watched the needle go in without flinching and let himself believe for a moment that it might really work. It hadn't come in time for him to step in and save Tony, but maybe it would be in time for him to save Clint and Coulson. "Thank you."
Tony knew how to take an order when it really mattered. Steve's head fell back against the wall, and he let himself enjoy the simple pleasure of the act. Tony had the softest lips he'd ever kissed, and they felt just as good below the belt as above. He gently carded his fingers through the man's curly hair, inadvertently ruining all of Tony's efforts to look presentable. Their press was done, and Steve didn't care anymore whether either of them looked presentable.
Clint held out his hands for the massive triple shot mocha like a kid reaching for a candy bar. He smiled as he took the first sip, then nodded his approval. "Okay, this place is definitely acceptable. Maybe even awesome. I also may have to get some kind of revenge, though, for you not telling me about it sooner."
"Tony!" Steve knew that screaming into everyone's comm wasn't helping. "Tony, please, I love you, please..." He felt someone take his microphone and dimly registered a lanky form at his side and a hand on his shoulder. It was done. He knew without having to be told, and he found himself entirely unable to hold back the enormity of the moment. It was too much to handle, and he sat in the chair, face blank.
There was  a brief ripple of chuckles, then, "Captain America, do you plan to use your status to further the gay agenda?"
Tony squirmed, then winced a little as it aggravated his stitches. Reminding himself that he'd likely get completely deprived of what was coming if Steve decided Tony couldn't hold still, the billionaire forced himself to subside, instead pushing himself up on his elbows as much as he could and watching the blonde intently. Steve was entrancing to watch. The man's perfect lips on Tony's skin, that perfect blonde hair just mussed enough to lightly drape over bright blue eyes... Tony couldn't imagine anyone sexier. "You know you look amazing, right?" he murmured breathlessly, the reactor on his chest bobbing slightly as he panted in anticipation.
The corner of Phil's lips quirked up into a smile at the husky sound of Clint's voice. He wasn't about to break their plan of not rushing, but he looked forward to hearing that a lot more in the future. "I might. Then again, I think I like the idea of seeing you a little jealous better. Maybe I need more with tiny shields on them." He'd done his fair share of being jealous when it came to Clint. Phil wondered if he could inspire the same sort of emotion, if Clint would ever see any need to worry on that count. He shouldn't, of course. For one thing Phil was monogamous by nature, for another he was already more than half crazy about Clint. Phil set a plate down in front of Clint and slid onto the closest stool with another plate for himself. "Steve's a really good guy, but just for the record, I've never wanted to date him."
Phil followed at a safe distance, sometimes pausing to urge the man back into the right track. "Almost there," he informed Clint. The archer didn't seem likely to recognize his own room in his current state. "Stumble to your right. No, the other door."
It was absolutely overwhelming in the best sense of the word. Steve reached down and gave his own cock a few quick jerks. The oversensitive flesh protested but not enough to keep him from coming again as he sucked down the evidence of Tony's release. Steve was thankful for the harsh grip of Logan's hands keeping him from collapsing unceremoniously onto the mattress. As it was, he cursed softly but appreciatively and pressed a lazy kiss to Tony's hip.
The file on the monitor immediately flashed that it was ready for reading. Fury typed in a search string. A few seconds of reading, and the Director shot up out of his chair. "Shit!"
"Fuck," Clint hissed, watching his cock disappear down Scott's throat. His hand tightened in Scott's hair, controlling the man's movements, his pace. The archer used Scott's throat for several minutes before finally drawing away, trailing a string of precum over the man's full lower lip. "Leave it," he ordered when Scott looked like he might lick it away. Clint grabbed Scott's chin, watching his blue eyes for several moments before leaning down to kiss away the mess, his tongue thrusting savagely into Scott's mouth in mimicry of what Clint planned to do to the man's body. "Unzip your pants and push them down to your knees," he growled, moving to stand behind Scott.
Just thinking about it made Natasha edgy, though she hid the reaction well. The only tell was a sideways glance at Clint as if to reassure herself that he was there and safe and himself.
Logan sighed contentedly at the words, "Good," nuzzling Scott's throat before he brushed a few gentle kisses to his lover's full lips. Reluctantly, he pulled back, shrugging off his shirt a more deliberately than he'd originally set out to before settled on the couch and he tugged his lover down to sit beside him, assuming a position similar to what they'd taken in the park, his arm behind Scott's shoulders and his other hand on the man's knee. Pulling Scott into another, much more passionate kiss, Logan let his hand trail up Scott's abs and over his chest, intent on quietly exploring the man's body in a way he hadn't yet taken the time to do.
Tony moaned softly, tightening his grip on the couch and Steve's cock as he started thrusting harder, faster, driving his lover's throbbing shaft into his fist with each forward stroke. "You look so good like this. Love how much you need it, how you move, like you can't get enough," he panted, angling his hips to hit the spot inside Steve that he knew would drive the most irresistible sounds from his lover.
Clint's face twisted into a sadistic smirk at that idea. "I like that plan. Wonder how many times I can put him down before he begs me to stop," the archer muttered. He'd tied the hammer to his belt but he kept a hand on it, fingers idly tracing the runes on the handle as they walked. His eyes shimmered strangely. "I wanna see him break. Both of them."
Clint rolled his eyes in frustration. "How about where the fuck is he, for starters? What aren't you telling us?" Clint growled, at the end of his patience and deference to authority.
Fury scowled. "Not much. Though our systems are pointing to one of Stark's files as having some information we should be aware of." He pointed at a screen which appeared to be monitoring some sort of decryption process. "Trouble is getting into it."
"First..." Tony pulled Steve against him, burying his face in soft blonde hair and holding him tight. "This may be a little clingy, but I missed you." It had been hard enough being away from Steve when the man was nearly invincible. Knowing how vulnerable he was now, Tony hated being away from his lover for even a second. Tony finally made himself let go of the blonde and smiled down at him. "I've eaten. But I'd be willing to make you something."
Although Tony had fantasized about kissing Steve too many times to count, nothing could have prepared him for the bliss of the real thing. Steve's lips were soft and warm, his mouth sweet and inviting. Tony could have easily lost himself right then and there. A huge part of him wanted to forget about the idea of returning to his suite. It seemed foolish to leave when everything felt so right. The rational part of his brain not clouded with reckless thoughts reminded him it was too soon. Tony contented himself with the kiss, cupping Steve's handsome face in his hands as he deepened the contact.
It was the answer he'd expected, and somehow that made Scott feel better. He still knew Logan. The feral mutant was still the ultimately trustworthy man who'd brought Rogue safely to Xavier's school without laying a hand on her and who had risked his life for the team more times than Scott could count. He let out a slow breath. Scott reached for Logan's hand with his free one and threaded their fingers together. "Good. And, y'know, if you happened to show up and crawl in bed with me too every now and then, I probably wouldn't mind."
"I don't have a cell phone." Logan noted that that wasn't enough to distract Steve into letting it drop, and he sighed internally. "Yeah." He glanced to one side and clenched his jaw for a second as he thought about Jean, then nodded. "I get a roll in the hay once in awhile, but I don't seem to have much luck with keepin’ anyone around." He shrugged. "The kinda lifestyle I lead, girls ain't exactly linin' up to do much more than hit it an' quit it," he said with a faint grin, falling silent as the waitress dropped off their drinks and then moved away.
The thought was enough to bring the smile back to Phil's face. It was nice to know that more than laziness had brought Clint back to him. "I'm glad you didn't. I don't honestly know what I would've done otherwise. No offense to Natasha, but the team is... it's pretty perfect the way it is. I wouldn't want it to change." The three of them had a rhythm together that not many SHIELD teams could match. "I would've hated not to come home to you, anyway. It wouldn't have felt right." Stupid as it was on some levels for them to stay together professionally, Phil wouldn't trade it unless he was forced to. He wouldn't have wanted anyone else guiding Clint through missions or listening to the painful silences while they waited for confirmations of success or failure. "We should sleep soon. Hopefully we can have our psych evals and prove we're not too broken to work. Or that we are for awhile." Badly as Phil wanted to be part of taking Loki down, he knew there was a chance that a shrink would hear the catch in his voice, see the tremors in his hands, and tell him to stay the hell away from missions for awhile. He frankly didn't know what he'd do with himself in that case.
"Your uniform is your business," Steve answered. "We've all got our own style. As Tony mentioned, he prefers to be the center of attention. Actually, I think Natasha and Clint are the only ones who wear leather," he mused, thinking it over for a moment before finishing off his coffee. "If you're good to go in a t-shirt and jeans, that's fine. For most of us it's about protection and comfort. You've got a little less need for that first one." From what he'd seen in the clips that Tony showed him, Logan could take a beating that would leave most men dead or at the very least unconscious and wind up barely injured and more pissed off than he started out. "If you don't have any extra stops to make, we can get going after breakfast. I'm sure Director Fury would like the chance to talk with you." That was if the man didn't opt out and send Coulson in to brief their newest member. He'd done it often enough lately that Steve was starting to wonder if it was some kind of payback for how much complaining the agent had done about Fury ruining his trading cards.
"Nice to know he's not easily frightened." Clint's exploits were legendary in the right circles. The man's attention always returned to Natasha, but he never seemed shy about using any port in the storm when she was otherwise engaged. "I knew it was a good sign when he was able to walk when he showed up for his shift. Well, mostly."
Scott nodded his agreement as he felt Logan's hands moving over his sensitive skin. He knew that he wouldn't be able to have Logan inside him. It was too soon on a lot of levels. Thankfully there were still a thousand other ways that they could make each other feel good. Scott was grateful to see the anger sliding away from Logan's face. Clint didn't deserve to have Logan pissed off at him. //He should be pissed at me.// Since he didn't want that either, Scott kept the thought to himself. "I like slow too... especially the way you touch me."
Tony was in agony, physically and emotionally. He wrenched at his bonds, his muscles bulging as he hoped to either break his wrists or the manacles, but it was to no avail. The Soldier plowed into him relentlessly, and the mocking gleam in his eyes chilled Tony's blood. "He'll hate me!" he cried out, his jaw clenched. "Is that... what you want? Is that... what all this's about?" A ragged groan tore itself from his throat as the other man rammed into him so forcefully it rattled Tony to his core.
The god resisted the urge to roll his eyes at the crumpled form on the floor. He'd tried to relay orders through the ranks to stand down, but naturally Creed hadn't listened. //It's on his own head, then.// Given that they'd bothered to bind the mutant, he apparently wasn't dead, though Loki couldn't profess any deep concern either way. Loki held his hands up in a universal gesture that he hoped would be understood and acknowledged. "I do not seek to fight you."
Steve's breath had caught at the lurid suggestion, and he was half disappointed that Tony backed down. It was the right thing to do, but it was still disappointing. He sighed and couldn't help smiling at the suggestion. "That's probably a good idea, yeah. I don't think you can help the looking pretty part, but quieter might be better." Tony was great at dealing with the press if loud and unabashed was what the event called for. This cried out for something more delicate. Still stroking his fingers through Tony's hair, he added, "And maybe we can talk about that blow job thing after?"
More than anything in that moment, Coulson wanted to reach over and take Clint's hand. He resisted the effort since as much as it would have been a way to soothe them both, it might also have carried connotations he wasn't ready to explore. "Thank you," he answered instead. "You're right, really. It's exactly what Fury says. It doesn't matter." His gaze narrowed briefly. "The more he says it, the less I believe it." Something was wrong. Something more than some surgery and a long vacation had gone on, but Phil couldn't for the life of him figure out what. "I guess I'll just feel better once I'm sure..." He trailed off, not sure what assurance he needed or wanted. "It doesn't matter."
Jemma smiled sweetly in return. "Make him think that? No. That would be cruel... to science. I think we owe the community the real thing." It was nice seeing Bruce laughing, to see some of the worry lifting from his shoulders even if it was only for a moment. There would be a new mission and a new problem and new worries in the near future. A warmer smile broke the threat, and she shook her head. "I'm coward enough that I hope I don't get that close to him either way unless I absolutely have to. Or he is dead. Then it would be rather fascinating, actually."
Clint couldn't help but laugh a little about that. He had to deal with his own jealousy issues regarding their far from monogamous relationship. It just felt weird knowing that she and Coulson had slept together and that Clint had never caught onto it. //Well, I guess I don't see everything,// he thought with a smirk. "Poor guy. I bet none of the other agents believed him, either," he remarked with a smirk. While Phil Coulson was hardly bad on the eyes - and apparently he was hung - he also didn't strike a person as the sort who'd be able to convince Nat to sleep with them. At least, not without some thought. Coulson had nerves of steel and enough confidence to stand up to gods, so in a way it made perfect sense. //Still awkward.// "I'm still going to have to fight to look him in the eye for the next few days."
The contact was gentle. It wasn't right, though. Not quite. It wasn't quite Steve. It was, however, the closest he'd ever have again, and Tony was willing to cling to that in the moment. He couldn't quite shake the sense of wrongness, and he had to fight to keep his breathing level. The internal tremor was easy to ignore as his hands moved slowly over Loki's body. "You feel so good," he murmured shakily, sounding half surprised. Tony felt tears threaten as he realized in frustration that the illusion wasn't perfect and wouldn't be. But it was close enough. If Loki was going to use him, the illusion made it easier.
Clint offered Nat a wan smile. He liked the idea of unwinding on the range too. He would've rather not had company, but he wasn't going to argue. He figured the relative intimacy of the night before had probably filled the woman's quota for the month. "We still have those Loki-shaped targets? I think that'd make me feel even better."
"Someone does," the woman answered easily. She unfolded herself into the closest chair with ease and grace, then looked him over. "You need a friend. Since letting Steve or Bruce know what happened would be a bad idea for obvious reasons and Clint has even worse bedside manner than I do..." Natasha smiled faintly at the man in the bed, but the expression flickered away just as quickly. "You'd be surprised how well I understand."
Tony finally let Steve's hand draw him away, his tongue flicking over the drooling head of Steve's cock before he sat back. Recalling that Steve had seemed rather intrigued by the idea of feeling it later, Tony grabbed his lover's hips and roughly flipped him onto his stomach. His hand gently but firmly pressed into the middle of the blonde's slim lower back as Tony leaned forward, his cock in his free hand and pressing against Steve's entrance. “I’m going to make sure you can feel me for days.” For once he kept prep to a minimum, two fingers doing a quick job of scissoring Steve open and slicking his hole with lube. He pressed forward, moving slowly. Being a little rougher was one thing; hurting either one of them too much was another matter entirely.
Scott's hand twitched on the seat. It was the last thing he'd expected to hear. "You spoke to Jean?"
The girl behind the counter began scanning the whole mess, listless and barely paying attention, but perked up slightly when she took in her customers, especially Steve. "Hey... hey, you're that superhero guy, right?"
A diagram popped up, illustrating Tony's injuries to him. "You've narrowly missed losing what's left of your liver, sir, and you've got a torn muscle wall, but that seems to be the worst of it."
"It was just the once," Natasha explained, tone casual. She acted as if it was nothing strange at all to confess that she'd slept with their handler. "There wasn't a lot of time to find out much about kinks or I'd give you a heads up. Just in case." Natasha continued eating, ignoring Clint sputtering and looking as if he was going to pass out any second. "It was a slow mission, a long night... it wasn't a big deal."
"Rather what I've been thinking, actually," Loki agreed, sounding surprised that they might be on the same page. "We'll give them time. Enough to think they're safe. Enough for us to find the best way to make sure they're not." Loki paced back and forth despite the way it jostled his ribs. "Coulson and the archer are first. Barton and his pet agent are trying my patience. You'd think killing the man once would be sufficient."
Tony felt goosebumps erupt on his skin at the grip on his hair. Steve was being gentle but forceful, and it was the kind of interaction Tony had been craving for a long while. His pulse hammering in his ears, Tony tugged Steve's underwear out of the way and ran his tongue over the head of the man's swelling cock. The smaller man moaned softly at the taste of his partner on his tongue, his hands moving to rest on Steve's thighs and his fingertips curling against solid muscle.
Logan grinned broadly. Maybe he couldn't get drunk, but he was definitely convinced that alcohol was an amazing substance. "Oh, I know it could be fun," he rumbled, leaning in to press his lips to Scott's. He wasn't sure if he owed Scott or Nat more for this one. "Pretty sure you won't regret it. Especially considerin' the company." He wondered absently about the remark regarding Clint's freedom of choice but decided to let the comment lie. He had a feeling that Nat and Clint had a relationship on a whole other level of complicated.
Tony groaned in perfect ecstasy as Loki moved inside him, hitting all the right spots, his cock slamming into Tony's prostate with each movement. His strangled cries and whimpers of pleasure filled the room as he neared the edge. Loki moved differently, but the lips against Tony's felt just like Steve's, tasted like his. Tony clung to that, lavished all his affection on the creature pressed against him and let the pleasure wash away the hesitation. His mouth blazed a trail down Loki's throat, and he nuzzled the god's neck as he panted for air.
The agents outside barely blinked at their odd-looking shirts or rumpled appearances. "You two alright?"
Natasha watched, mute, as Loki placed his palms flat on the sides of Logan's face. She had no idea what he was looking for, but it definitely wasn't in SHIELD's best interest for him to find it.
Clint more or less purred, a content sort of murmur as Phil's lips brushed reassuringly against his palm. He leaned up to gently kiss the man's neck before letting his fingers tangle around Phil's, idly tracing the shapes of his lover's hand, his knuckles, his fingers. He was only half tuned into the movie, enjoying instead the security and quiet he was feeling with Nat and Phil pressed securely against him. His free hand idly stroked through the woman's red locks without his realizing it, and he almost stopped before changing his mind. The few times they'd had to reassure one another, Clint had usually found himself doing the same thing. He figured if either she or Phil had an objection, they could voice it, but the contact was calming for the archer too.
Fury continued with barely a glance at the man. "Stark has the lead on this. Banner, I know you don't like to suit up..."
Tony drank the issue down gladly, then wiped his mouth on the back of his hand. He grinned up at Steve, "Couldn't've said it better myself." Standing, he pressed against the blonde, helping him stay on his feet and leaning up to press their lips together. "Feels fucking good to hear you call out for me like that. You're beautiful when you cum." He grinned and nipped at Steve's lip, then ground the aching bulge in his pants against his partner's thigh. "Of course, I think you made me a promise earlier."
Tony gulped in a couple more breaths before he returned the kiss, then sagged to the mattress next to Steve, keeping them tangled closely together. "Well, I couldn't do it without my biggest fan," he replied with a smirk that only lasted a second or two before he was forced to go back to trying to catch his breath. "And I have to say, you're pretty freaking amazing, yourself. I think I could get addicted to the way you look when you cum. More addicted. But I don't admit that I have a problem, so I'm completely not salvageable."
Although the evening had initially been arranged as a means to get Tony back into the land of the living, it was turning out to be the best date he ever had. "Well, the mystic sceptre of doom didn't help with first impressions," Tony pointed out. "Thank you, but I was wrong about you too." He sat back in his chair, cleared his throat and proposed, "How about we start over? Hi, I'm Tony Stark, and you are?" he offered his hand, his eyes warm and welcoming.
"Quality over quantity," Pepper answered with a wavering smile. "Anyone who saw the two of you together knew what you meant to each other. It doesn't matter if it was a week or fifty years, Steve."
The sound of pain made Clint redouble his efforts, but all he got for it was bloodied wrists, and he finally subsided when he felt warm fluid trickling down his forearm. He didn't look. He knew better than to look. He already wanted to puke, and he knew he wouldn't be able to handle the memories of seeing what he knew was happening a few feet away. //I'm sorry, Phil...//
Thor tensed at the words but didn't bother debating them. As badly as it hurt to think so, the Widow was correct. Loki had to be dealt with. "Come, my friends. We have a task to accomplish."
"Right. Fan out, let's get looking. Since the place is still standing, we must've beat Loki here, which hopefully means we get first crack at finding the hammer." Steve gave everyone a beat to make sure they were on the same page and then started for the nearest shelf. "Let's do this."
Clint shrugged. "I can crash on your couch - Wait." Something had caught his eye on the monitor already. "How do you rewind it?" he demanded, waiting until Coulson did so and having him stop at a key point. "Look at that. The arm grab, the look on his face," he said, pointing to Logan. "Run it forward a little. There... see? Completely different body language. Like nothing happened." He glanced at Phil. "It's not proof, but I think we've got reason to keep watching." He moved to the overstuffed leather sofa nearby. "You play creeping Tom; I'll make sure this couch stays secure." He yawned. It was getting close to three days with no real sleep to show for it. Clint knew that he couldn't hold out much longer without at least a nap.
"Y'know, that he isn't being himself," Natasha chimed in. She couldn't help smiling faintly. They were her team. The Avengers were an odd group, but she loved it. She loved every second of it. Even the parts that hurt like hell. Leaning back until she was resting against the wall, her gaze shifted to Coulson. "Take care of him for me."
Scott was still busy staring at Logan like he was speaking Greek, but finally he snorted and took the shot that Natasha had handed him. "I think I'm flattered. You slept with Iron Man and Captain America, and you still thought I was worth picking up." He shrugged and made sure they all had something to drink in hand. "That's worth drinking to."
"Mother! Did I not order you to stay with the metalmancer for your safety? Why are you here?" Thor growled, glowering at them.
"Well, nothing you have to worry about now," Tony pointed out. "We'll... I don't know... do something outrageously extravagant. Eat an endangered animal or something." Thinking about all the things Steve had never had made him want to present the man the world on a silver plate. "Good thing you didn't get left behind. Then we wouldn't be cuddling."
Though he blushed furiously at the compliment, Steve smiled. “I don’t mind at all.” Hearing Tony flirting and teasing made him feel like they might settle into something like normalcy with time. The feeling of peace made Steve bold enough to venture, “I was thinking maybe after we eat, we could watch a movie or something? I understand if you aren’t up for it, but… well, to be honest, I kind of don’t want the evening to be over too early. I’ve missed you.”
"I... I don't... it..." Steve sank down onto a stool and managed an amused snort. "Leave it to Tony to still be able to surprise me even..."
"C-careful," Steve stuttered even as all the blood rushed away from his head. He wanted Tony's mouth on him so bad it was difficult not to grab him by the hair and take what he needed. Instead of taking, though, Steve managed a few shuddering breaths and stayed as still as possible. In as steady a voice as he could manage, he said more certainly, "Be careful. Stop when... stop if you... if you need to, okay?"
Tony had often been compared to his father, especially the older he got. Sometimes he didn't know whether to take it as a compliment or to be offended. Hearing Steve admit that he genuinely held admiration for him brought a smile to Tony's face. Deciding to yank Steve's chain a little more, Tony remarked with mock seriousness, "So, are you saying I'm the 'daddy' type?" He wondered what kind of reaction that would elicit from the other man, who still seemed naive about the ways of the modern world.
Tony watched the god quietly, chewing his food deliberately. "I think there might be a stick or two in the spokes of those wheels. Like the fact that the Avengers still have your hammer. Or that if the good guys up in Asgard aren't headed here to help us out, that Bruce and the wonder twins are already working on a way to get up there." He gestured accusingly at Loki with the apple in his hand. "You don't even believe your own hype." He was starting to pick up on the god's tics, and he'd seen the flash of uncertainty.
For a moment the image of Tony naked in the shower was so distracting that Steve forgot he was supposed to answer. "Oh. No. I'll get the boxes first." He was almost glad to have a reason to leave. It wasn't that he didn't trust himself, exactly, but he wasn't sure how to deal with Tony's teasing sometimes, and when his mind was already wandering to places he'd rather it didn't... Things were already complicated. If he didn't keep hold of his own feelings, they would only get worse. Steve buried his concerns in packing and notifying Director Fury of the change only to find that JARVIS had already done it for him.
"Go fuck yourself." Logan fixed his attention on the small television on the shelf behind the bar. "Had enough of you government spooks."
"Love you too. Love you, Tony," Steve panted against the man as he stopped kissing to move his hips. His cock slid against Tony's, wet and just a little bit too rough. "Love you, and I don't ever want... don't want to not have you with me..." He wasn't worrying about making sense, but Steve finally did coax one of his hands away from Tony's skin long enough to grab blindly, finding conditioner and using it as makeshift lube. Steve's hand curled around them both, not large enough yet to do it with ease, but enough to increase the pressure as they rutted against one another.
Coulson had to admit they'd gotten a little off track. More than a little. He nodded his agreement and rose just in time to hear a knock at the door. Opening it, he found himself staring at Steve, who had his serious leader face on, and Logan, who looked ready to run at any moment. "Barton, we have guests."
"That's an understatement," Steve answered with a smile before lifting his head long enough to look at the other man's face. "I didn't know you made those." Exhaustion soon made him drop his head back against Tony's shoulder. He shifted his weight to the side to keep from crushing Tony but couldn't give up the contact. It didn't surprise him that Logan wasn't one for cuddling. It did surprise him that Tony was. Thankfully it was a pleasant surprise. "Mmm... your arm okay?"
"Well, that's good, at least, but I detect a giant 'but' in that statement," Clint said as he helped himself to the coffee. It was still a little surreal knowing Tony and Steve were involved. Clint didn't give two shits about them both being guys, not too long before they’d both been constantly on the edge of suiting up and duking it out over every student argument. Then again, hatesex wasn't unfamiliar to Clint, but he figured it'd gone past that if the place Rogers wanted to be while he recovered was Stark's suite. "I mean, if Rogers is still recovering, that's already a bad sign."
Natasha hadn't been flattering Scott for nothing. He knew exactly what he was doing, and soon her breathy moans turned into a sharp cry of pleasure as her hips jerked against Logan's hand and Scott's tongue. Instead of stopping, Scott worked her through the release and licked at the juices dripping down her thighs. "If you ever get tired of him," she ground herself back against Logan, "call me."
"She's... focused," Coulson explained with a faint smile. May wasn't what anyone would consider a people person, but she was also one of the rare people he trusted implicitly. "It's good to hear we'll have some additional back up. Whether we find Loki there or not, I'd rather have a few extra pairs of eyes covering our collective asses."
"I'm not sure he wants to see your fun," Steve countered, though he had to admit that Tony had a point. He wasn't eager to get back into the Tower either, and he had absolutely no defenses against the other man's proximity. He looked around and felt his heart pounding in his chest. Dancing in public was one thing, but someone could come out to one of the few cars scattered throughout the garage at any moment. //That's the point,// Steve told himself as he caught the smirk on Tony's face. "After the other night, I guess it's a little late to pretend I'm not that kind of guy." Normally he was anything but that kind of guy, but Steve doubted many people could refuse Tony. Instead of trying, Steve closed the distance between them and brushed his lips gently against Tony's.
Logan growled as if in answer, squeezing Scott's shaft a little tighter. He worked to stretch Scott further before finally withdrawing his hand and using it to hook his lover's knee up onto the bed next to Logan's hip. Letting go of Scott's cock, Logan took himself in hand and looked up at his lover with fierce, demanding eyes. "C'mon... Sit on it," he demanded, sounding almost impatient. They were moving fast. Too fast, really. But Logan wanted Scott too much, too immediately to go slow.
The implications of what Logan was saying filtered in to even Scott's increasingly bleary mind. "Wait... around here? You... wait, you... since you got here?" he hissed in what was meant to be a whisper but didn't quite drop low enough to manage it.
Darien stared blankly for a moment and finally nodded. "I'm guessing the political answer is no, but I think you already know the answer anyway, and I'm not looking to take an extra knife to the throat today." He looked around at the carnage and tried to breathe deeply. Freaking out around a crazy person would be bad. Being an asshole to a crazy person would be even worse. Finally Darien settled for asking the most obvious question on his mind, "So are you a good ninja or a bad ninja?"
Phil laughed but wasn't willing to play along with Clint's usual downplaying of his abilities. "I've seen you in the field, so I know it wasn't cheesy. It was probably beautiful." Natasha and Melinda May were probably the only two other people in the world he knew who even came into the realm of being competition when it came to skill and grace. Clint moved like he was floating. Coulson had been on the line while the man crawled through metal duct work without making a damn sound. "Besides, maybe I just wanted to see you in the spandex."
"No, he isn't." Coulson stared down at the hammer. "It repulsed his staff, the energy he was using. The magic." Using the word as a part of reality still threw him for a loop even after everything. "If we figure out how, it might help Logan and Summers and Natasha. We might be able to use it."
Nat frowned, gaze narrowed. "He's showing off. He got away from Thor, he damn near beat us last time, and he's showing off. Drawing attention. Our attention."
"Little of both," Phil answered honestly, kicking Clint's foot off of the rung of the stool in retaliation. "We started off going a hundred down the interstate, now we're backing it down to neutral. I think it's only fair if we both have a few time outs to call while we ease in." There was a difference between a fling and a relationship, and it didn't take someone who'd had a lot of success with either to see the distinctions. "Good to know my cooking affects you so deeply, though. Wait until I introduce you to hand made pasta. You'll never leave."
Hearing Scott's shaky pleas was almost too much. "You can... nng... cum when I do," he managed, shivering as his next few thrusts put him over his limit. His hips slammed upward into the other man, his arms pulling Scott down into him as Clint cried out in unbridled pleasure. He bit into Scott's shoulder, stifling his cries as he spilled himself inside Scott's tight body.
The archer closed his eyes and leaned into Nat's hand, relishing the praise, before grasping her wrist and placing a kiss on her palm. He kissed his way down the sinuous limb to her collarbone. Looking up at her with hungry eyes, he slowly closed his lips around her nipple, tugging at it lightly with his teeth before he closed his eyes once more and suckled at the hardened flesh. His hips still kept a steady rhythm, though it was getting more and more difficult to refrain from picking up the pace.
Coulson gazed mildly at Tony until the silence became slightly uncomfortable. "It might be better if Captain Rogers handled this alone."
Logan nodded. He had to keep reminding himself of that. It was tough to get past the delicate state he'd found Scott in, but he had to remember that most people put in Scott's place would've been just as likely to end up dead or permanently crazy. Logan pressed himself close to Scott, letting his own throbbing shaft rest against his lover's thigh as he slowly pressed one finger into Scott's body. Logan watched himr closely, relishing the sight of those full lips parted in pleasure, and the hooded blue eyes that Logan couldn't get enough of.
Clint rumbled his approval of the move, planting a few more bites on Darien's chest. His hands tangled tightly into the other man's hair, and Clint dragged Darien in for another rough kiss. His hands moved down Darien’s sides, pulling him forward a bit so that his cock was sliding between Darien's buttocks, lubing him up with precum. He fumbled in his vest and managed to find some oil intended for gear. It was the best they were going to get, and he slicked it over his cock. After a few moments, Clint grasped his aching length and pressed it against Darien's entrance. "Sit on it... go on," he rumbled, his voice husky and anxious.
"Me, sure, I’ll be in one piece. I hope Asgard's as resilient," Bruce remarked with a quirk of a smile. He reached out and gave Jemma's shoulder a squeeze. "We'll definitely get that coffee. I'll take pictures. Maybe a selfie of me and Heimdall."
Natasha stumbled happily inside, latching herself onto Logan again as soon as his shirt was gone. "Why do you even wear shirts?" she muttered, fingers running down his chest to explore the muscular planes. "You really shouldn't."
"I actually highlighted that in your file," Phil answered, reluctantly rolling away and getting out of bed. "I have a spare toothbrush." There was only so long that they could carefully avoid the issue, and he preferred to get the mundane things out of the way as quickly as possible. Phil went through his morning routine quickly and left the spare toothbrush in its plastic on the edge of the sink. "All yours. Also? That note in your file? I may have made that note in your file. Sorry."
"Oh, if I'm allowed to be a jerk based on how pretty I am, I guess I better pump up the volume," Tony decided. He knew he'd gotten away with near murder on not just a few occasions because people - especially Pepper - had very little resistance to his puppy dog eyes. "And here I thought you'd be immune."
Bruce was pretty sure he hadn't put more than two seconds' thought into what he was going to wear in years. Going through his wardrobe, it was hard to feel like he had any decent options. He finally settled on his typical button-down shirt tucked into his jeans, then spent what felt like forever fooling with his hair before leaving his room looking more or less the way he always did. He was also painfully early, and he couldn't help but smile when he caught sight of Jemma already waiting for him. //Wow.// "You look nice," he said, feeling oddly nervous. That was an understatement. Jemma looked incredible in the sun dress with her hair down. Bruce suddenly felt woefully sloppy in spite of having a fresh shave, but still managed a smile. "So, you know all the coffee shops within five miles of here. Any recommendations?"
Not entirely pleased with the fact that the bloodlust seemed to be bleeding out of the group at the revelation of Stark's apparent wellness, Sif broke in, "Now is the time for action. We have put off this sentence too long."
"You make a good point." Coulson found himself unable to keep from laughing at the mental image. "Sorry, I'm sorry, that just..." He trailed off, still chuckling, and then got himself more under control. "No, that probably wouldn't be good for anyone's self confidence. Besides, there's no reason to. I told you before, the door's open. I meant it. Still do. Even at two in the morning, you're welcome. I can even get you a key if you want to crash here sometimes when I'm on assignment."
Coulson took all of two seconds to process the information, file away what he couldn't handle, and formulate the best plan. "Barton, go make sure Romanov is okay. Get the cuffs off first. If anyone says anything, tell them they're welcome to come and speak with me directly." He paused. "Point out that right now would be a terrible time for them to come and speak to me directly. You know where we'll be." There was no way Tony could get himself to the infirmary. He was shaking and looked on the verge of passing out himself. Coulson had never seen the man so emotional about anything, so broken up and out of his element. It hurt, but Coulson pushed the hurt off to the side, made sure Clint knew what to do, and began pushing Tony's chair toward medical.
Logan knew by the disturbingly face-splitting grin on Clint's face that whatever the archer was about to say was probably going to upset Phil in ways heretofore unheard of. Naturally Logan couldn't help but find his own sadistic grin at the thought.
Clint glanced at Nat. "You don't have to," he said. "I mean, I don't mind, but..." He sighed. "Well, I guess I did promise you an explanation, anyway." He leaned a little closer to Phil as if for reassurance. "And I'm not doing it here, not in the cafeteria."
"Yeah, stuff's potentially toxic at the right levels. Kind of like too many iron pills. Or having an iron skeleton. I'm sure your healing factor takes care of that, though."
"Sure. I'll dip 'em in your Scotch collection," Logan assured. He tossed his dirty clothes in one corner of the room, pleased to note a small kit of toiletries sitting on the corner of the sink in the small bathroom as he took a second to make sure he didn't look like a complete wreck from the flight. Stepping back out, he nodded to Tony and Steve. "Alright, let's go see what Phil has to say." //It's gonna be hard takin' him seriously with a name like 'Phil'.//
"You should keep an eye on Stark. We should get going." He smiled slyly at Clint. "I'll drive." All Clint had to do to dent a car was look at it. "Nobody touches Lola but me." He nodded to Steve. "I'll text you when we're on the way back."
They'd agreed that in case Magneto did happen to be there with Loki, it was best that no one remain trapped on the plane. Though she'd protested that she wasn't interested in combat detail, May had ultimately agreed to land them and come in with the team anyway. Coulson was glad of it. If it came to a fight, she would be a smooth addition in Natasha's absence. "Understood. We all ready to go?"
The drag of the mortal's blunt nails sent fireworks of pleasure singing through him. Loki threw his head back and gasped, then met Tony's gaze again. Those black eyes were gorgeously wicked, and he sighed. It would be an easy addiction to cultivate, having Tony Stark at his beck and call. "Do you think that you can be trusted to get us both to the edge, Mr. Stark?" The words were meant to be a challenge. He knew well how Stark responded to challenges, had watched him enough to spot that pattern without even trying.
Between the feel of Phil's hands on his shoulders and the words, Clint couldn't help the low sound of pleasure that rumbled in his throat. "Well, lemme know when you're ready to collect payment, boss," he murmured thickly, dipping his fingers into Phil's waistband. It was a tease. Mostly. Well, if Clint were honest with himself, he'd have gone right for it right then if Phil had given him the green light. //Let's hope he has more self restraint than I do.//
Don't panic. Well, about a long wait, anyway. I have the first five chapters of Part 2 edited already, so it should be going up in a timely fashion.
Though Phil rolled his eyes, he was willing to allow, "Okay, maybe I deserve it. A little. But you didn't exactly offer to help me out either." He brought Clint's hand up to his lips and placed a kiss on it. "It's getting late, the mosquitoes are coming out, and I need to stand up for awhile or my legs are going to be permanently numb. There's a little shop not too far away - coffee, tea, that kind of thing. We could walk it and then head back for the car when we're done." The shop was one of his hideouts, a place to retreat from the Tower without being so impossibly far that he'd get berated by Fury for being out of touch or unreachable.
Another short one that's more of an interlude. Sorry, sometimes that's just how these things happen ;)
The sound of his name on Nat's lips sent a jolt through Clint that was equal parts arousal and pride. The feeling of her squeezing his shoulders made him all the more desperate to feel those strong, supple thighs around his waist, and Clint groaned as the woman's juices flooded his mouth.
Having been given a series of painkillers while his broken body was tended, Tony was feeling more loopy than he cared to admit. He wasn't too out of it to notice that Steve had plastered on a smile, which to Tony spelled out trouble. "Pains meds are doing their job," he replied, lifting his hand to show the I.V. sticking in him. "You're not fooling anyone with that forced grin. I know what a real smile on the pretty face of yours looks like, and that ain't it." Tony tried to sit up, but it proved too much of an effort. Instead, he fixed Steve with a serious gaze. "Now, are you gonna tell me what's going on, or do I have to get up and find out for myself?"
The words alone made Steve groan. He wanted that too, almost desperately, but Steve still met Tony's gaze and tried to think clearly enough to ask if it was alright. Coherency eluded him for a moment as he stroked Tony's cock and felt Logan thrusting carefully against him. He shuddered and then smiled as he looked into Tony's eyes. "That okay with you? Because it would be really, really okay with me." He was fine with the idea of returning the favor afterward too, but they could talk about that when they were both able to form a more complex series of thoughts.
Though Steve felt the tears pricking his eyes again, he ignored them in favor of clinging to Tony and trying to soothe him through his pain. He could only imagine the fear he'd felt and didn't even want to ask what Loki might have done or said while they were alone. Shivering, he clung to his lover and tried to forget everything but the fact that Tony was safe and alive and in his arms. "You're here, and I'm here, and I'm not letting you go again. I won't, Tony. Not ever. I swear to God, I won't ever let you go." His voice broke, and he stopped trying to talk or do anything but hang on for dear life.
Phil reached out, his hand closing over one of Clint's and drawing it away from the cup. He felt the rough, calloused spots on the fingers and smiled at the touch. "It was friends spending time together. The last thing I want is for you to feel bad about any of the time we've spent together in the past. Believe me when I say that I don't regret a second of it." Regardless of his crush, Phil had never felt bad about getting extra time in with Clint be it at work or in their spare time - rare as that was. "I'm glad you wanted any of that time with me. I'm glad you want this time with me."
"We're our own ancient weapon of mass destruction," Scott agreed with a laugh. That the mansion was standing was a testament both to Xavier's leadership and its solid construction. "Lesser houses would have fallen." He was pretty sure Stark had built his foundations just as well, though the thought brought with it a reminder of the day that drew the smile from Scott's face. "How long until Fury pulls us all back in and tries to convince us we're not as fucked as we think we are?"
Had it been anyone else at his side, Coulson would have taken their hand and sat closer. Since it was Clint and the man looked skittish as it was, he kept his distance and tried to keep conversation light. It was a markedly difficult task when he wanted to grab Clint and kiss him senseless while the cab took them closer to the tower. When they arrived, Phil led the way to his suite and let them both in. He started some coffee and suggested, "You can put on some music if you like." He nodded toward a shelf that contained one of the Stark Industries-issued mp3 player/satellite radio outfits they'd all been given. "Unless you put on particularly whiny country music, there's not much I really hate."
Logan howled in pain as the force of the shot bore him into the wall, lancing him through with acid. He tore at the wound like a wild animal, trying to extract the shaft. The carbon nanotube structure wouldn't give, though, and Logan gasped in pain, compromised lungs gurgling as he struggled to draw breath.
Steve wasn't an idiot. He'd kept his gaze low for a reason. He could barely look at himself in the mirror, so he wasn't going to get mad at them for feeling shell-shocked about it. He let them look, let them take it in while he pretended it took him a lot longer than necessary to polish off a few signatures and pass the paperwork back to Coulson. They shared a smile, and Steve quietly began, "I think it's fair to say that this meeting is my fault." He saw Bruce's jaw twitch but didn't take the words back. The man was fighting so hard not to look at Tony that they couldn't even make eye contact. "Bruce and Tony and Fitz-Simmons did a pretty amazing thing. They found a way to save our teammates. It was just a little more... a little more complicated than anybody would've liked." It was easier addressing everyone than he'd thought it would be even if all the eyes on him made Steve's skin crawl. He glanced over at Natasha and smiled faintly. "It was worth it. Director, if anybody needs to get in trouble for this... well, obviously, I think I'm going to need to be on modified duty for awhile anyway."
Having only caught the last sentence of the conversation, Tony couldn't know for sure what was up, but he had a fair idea. Still, he wasn't above pushing Fury's buttons. "Cellphones, I'm not so sure, but I know I saw a few iPads. Those're hard to mi-"
