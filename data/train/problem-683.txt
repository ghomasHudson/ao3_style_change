"No!" Sherlock interjected quickly, his heart thumping encouragement in his chest. "Of course I still want you. I… thank you."
The younger man nodded perfunctorily. "And it was you who found her first?" he asked.
," he promised.
The hand on his abdomen moved south as John's lips moved forward, and both made contact with their respective goals at the same time; Sherlock pressed into the gentle kiss as John's hand slid over his groin, cupping and squeezing tentatively. A small contented noise escaped his mouth and he rocked his hips forward lazily.
it wasn't healthy. He was besotted. Everything the gladiator did made Sherlock admire him even more: the previous night, when he had expected that Sherlock simply intended to put the city lawkeepers back to finding Mary's killers and barely lift a finger himself – and he had still agreed! The loyalty that he showed to his late wife made Sherlock in awe of John, jealous of Mary and guilty for trying to take her place all at once.
to see the hurt on the younger man's face. "What is it?" Sherlock asked. "I do sincerely believe that you and I are equals, John. Please tell me what I have done to make you think otherwise."
John stared at the other man. He had been taken by surprise, but that did not mean that his loss was excusable, and the hot and ugly feeling of disappointment at himself bubbled up at his stomach. The trident rose and John fought the urge to close his eyes, expecting it to land – likely harder than necessary, judging by the previous moves from the slave – at his throat in the typical demand for surrender.
Oh, Hercules, that is enough training for today. They all know I am fidgeting with impatience for the morning to end as it is, an early finish will earn me only amused smiles, and then I will be free to run to you as fast as I can, the hum of the last training exercise not yet faded from my blood.
He was rewarded with a grating sort of laugh from the lanista and a solid hand on his back. "Just be sure you do not get overconfident. The men in my arena know how to fight better than the rag-tag bunch in Dimmock's." The silver-haired fighter drew his sword again, moving away from John but not taking a preparatory stance, his face calm with contemplation. "I have never seen his Excellency react to anyone quite the way he seemed to react to you," he said slowly.
Sherlock's fists clenched at the slight. "Excuse me?" he asked hotly, even as John's hand closed around his upper arm, pleading him to leave it.
No such luck; he could definitely
." He closed his mouth at Sherlock's languid drawl and purposeful rock of his hips upward, driving his erection persistently against John's rear. "I only ask this once, that I may at least experience it and judge it for myself. Only you and I will know, and by now the both of us have accepted that
For the briefest of moments, the smaller man looked as though he was struggling. Then he said quickly, "You fought well. I was pleasantly surprised. But what you did to the two men you did not kill was unnecessarily cruel."
John Watson smiled. "Well, you are, if I may say it again. Extremely." He bent his head again, narrowing his eyes at the organ in front of him. "I… I have never done this before, so…"
John smiled at him. "In that case, I have a very large amount of gratitude I would like to express," he said lazily, leaning down to find Sherlock's lips again. This time the Emperor succumbed to the kiss, clutching at John's back, his dark curls shifting gently against the linen of his bedclothes with the movements of his head.
The silver-haired man sighed. "Yes, my Lord," he replied quietly, turning away.
, was almost as good as an
The Emperor sat up and yanked the toga over his head, wincing as the forgotten pin holding it together snagged on a thick strand of his dark curly hair. John couldn't help but watch it as it flew over the side of the bed with an impatient sigh from Sherlock; fabric would be softer, more forgiving around his wrists than rope.
combat to a level that none of the others do."
Sherlock remembered being relieved when his father had offered Lestrade the position of lanista. Relieved that he did not have to worry that each time he saw his only friend it would be the last time. Could he apply the same thinking to John? "Would it be… exciting enough for him?" he asked slowly, feeling a tendril of hope begin to uncoil in his stomach.
"Stop, please," Lestrade interrupted, holding up a careworn hand between them, his nose wrinkled again as though at a foul smell. "You are speaking of a man I remember teaching when he was five years old. I do not wish to know what he is like in the bedchamber."
The dimachaerus grinned, looking delighted at the prospect. Sherlock gently excused them both and led Lestrade back out into the empty arena to sit on the tiers. "Are you certain you are all right?" he asked. "I have never seen you looking so flustered."
Lestrade took a sharp breath in beside him. "Interesting. I have never seen that before." Sherlock quirked a grin at him, noticing that even Mycroft was on the edge of his seat as the crowd screamed. Most of them were yelling for the Briton to pull himself together, but that was to be expected. Auctorati were always unpopular when they started out; the city was disinclined to like someone who had chosen this life instead of one among them, and it took time to regain their favour.
grow up to rule, so perhaps my worries for propriety were less. I came to the court when I was twenty. Even at five years old, Sherlock -
John fell still, watching him with an odd expression on his face. "This is what you do, I know," he said softly. "With those children, the jerky and the sestertii and sending them to Mrs Hudson – you try to protect people, to keep them safe, and you think that it's a part of being Emperor, but it's a part of being
rhythm like the march of a soldier.
Sherlock actually snarled, ducking around Angelo and boarding the nearest sloop, snapping his fingers at the hapless fisherman, who dropped his net in surprise. "Follow them," he snapped at the man. "It is imperative that we catch those two thieving murderers."
trust him. Apparently, though, he hadn't been quite clear enough in his declarations. And yet – if this was what Sherlock needed to make that step, then John was more than willing to give it to him.
. How simple it would be to reach for the dagger hidden in the folds of his loincloth and take his revenge for the State's inaction over Mary's murder.
Sherlock tilted his head to one side as though considering. "Tempting," he admitted. "Perhaps to avoid your own trial we should attempt to capture the both of them and make their death sentence a public affair."
feel the same, surely?"
Sherlock did not bring up the subject until they had stowed John's clothing beside his own in the trunk at the foot of his bed and settled back onto the bed with a decanter of wine between them. A warm, glowing sensation was settling on Sherlock's stomach and John's fingers were carding through his hair, pulling and tugging in terrifically pleasant ways.
The younger man huffed a breath against John's lips. "I trust you," he murmured in return. "I had never done it before when I did it to you – did I hurt you?"
Huge thanks to Mr_CSI, who wasn't expecting about half of this chapter. Similar-sized thanks to Alex, my Latin tutor, for hearing that I was writing something set in ancient Rome and immediately teaching me the Latin for 'penis' and 'blowjob', as though it was read that I would need them. One day I will use them, I promise.
"All right," Lestrade barked as they assembled around him. John's eyes were still on Sherlock; the silver-haired lanista snapped his fingers in front of his face irritably. "John, over here."
and covering you in the smell and surroundings of gladiator life, reducing you to sweat and leather and incoherence – it has a certain appeal."
He wasn't sure how, but it looked as though he might have begun to win the gladiator's heart already. Sherlock held his breath, and nodded.
However, I will freely admit that I have no knowledge whatsoever of sailing, be it our time or theirs, so I've taken a lot of artistic license with this chapter.
So. Two things.
John climbed over Sherlock nonetheless, carefully resting his weight on the narrow hips and reaching out with the rope. His bare knees caught the fabric of Sherlock's toga, lifting it up his hips; frowning at it, John raised himself onto his knees and slid down until his face was level with the base of the toga. "First," he mumbled, his voice slightly hoarse, "we must get rid of
"Do not make friends with barbarians, John Watson," Small wheezed. His voice was rickety, his throat destroyed by the effort of coughing up water and breathing while he was drowning, and John almost had to lean closer to hear the words. "I promised him sestertii for saving my life after Ctesiphon. I swear it, I did not want to kill Mary. But she would not co-operate, and Tonga grew angry, please, Watson, please, please save me…" his voice trailed off into tiny, painful-sounding coughs, at the end of which he struggled to draw a breath that was clearly not enough.
John Watson shifted until he could look his Emperor in the eye. The movement caused the hand not continuing lazy caresses up and down his back to slip from his hip and rest heavily on his abdomen instead. Sherlock bit his lip as John looked at him seriously. "Would you…
His thigh twinged again; he propped his leg on the seat of a chair as he entered the cage under the arena stands to examine the wound. It did not look as though it had hit anything important, although it would probably require some form of stitching to force the flesh to knit together again. John sighed and put his leg down. He wanted comfort, wanted someone to tell him that he performed well and quiet the fury bubbling in his stomach – he wanted
You see how quickly things get done when I'm the one doing them?
Sherlock sent a scornful glance at the lawkeepers now swarming over Small's corpse, hoping that his lanista would not see how violently he was still trembling. "Is that – Jupiter. The man from the arena."
Angelo chuckled and slung the prone body of Mary's killer over his back. "Well played, John," he rumbled. "Next stop for this one, the Circus Maximus."
Sherlock trapped him between his knees and rolled until John was on his back and Sherlock could slide down his body and press their lips together languidly. "Perhaps you should move your belongings here," he suggested. "I am sure Lestrade will not mind."
They were barely two streets away from the court when someone's gruff shout made them stop and turn, dropping each other's hands.
John's hand asserted itself by gripping onto his elbow; Sherlock looked up to see his eyes fixed on the man making steady progress across the deck of the fishing-boat with a heavy wooden crutch. His face was twisted into an expression Sherlock would give away a considerable amount to never see on it again. This man had murdered John's wife; Sherlock would kill him himself if John wanted him to, and wasn't that a terrifying thought – that he was perfectly willing to drive his broadsword through a man he did not know simply because he had once made John unhappy.
Tentatively, pausing every few moments as though the gesture was a struggle against nature, the Emperor reached out and wrapped his long fingers around John's penis. John gasped – Sherlock's fingers were thinner and more dextrous than his own, and they caught on his foreskin on every upstroke in a way that made him shudder and groan. When, after a few minutes, Sherlock placed his tongue between his teeth in concentration and employed his other hand to heft and cup John's testicles, he gave a final grunt of his
Gods, my every inch of skin tingles. Your lips stretch so prettily around me, my rough hands buried in your beautiful damp hair, and the heat of your mouth feels
John turned and rearranged himself so that his warm, strong hands were both resting on the small of Sherlock's back. "Please," he said, shifting so that the two of them were comfortable and bringing the sheets up to cover them. "I have missed this. Being intimate, being close to someone like this."
He tried to step back, but the slashed thigh protested and he almost fell; off balance, he registered that the slave was upon him, trident outstretched, and jerked his head backwards to avoid another sweeping slash at his neck.
"I am sorry," Holmes was saying, his other hand mirroring the first in clutching at John's arm. Were those tears glistening in his pale eyes, or were they simply swimming in the distortion from his own? John shook his head. "I am so sorry, John."
"Oh, she was in a dreadful hurry. She said the man you were looking for with one leg was at the docks again, but, Sherlock, he was getting into a boat and she said it looked as though he were making to sail –"
Sherlock returned the smile. "Any more than that and I will not be able to feed mine," he lied.
Sherlock let out an almighty groan, throwing his head back onto the bed with a
John shook his head stubbornly, his nose bumping Sherlock's clavicle. "Nor was I," he admitted. "After Mary died I never thought I would want to say
still staring down at them from the wall. "What do we do now?"
He surveyed the children in front of him; two of them he had not seen before, and these he smiled at reassuringly. "And –
Sherlock whimpered. "John," he repeated. "
"I should go," John said dully. "It is almost dawn."
" he murmured. "Your skin – every part of your body is soft, even the parts that have no business being so."
, and then John rolled easily out of the way as the slave crumpled forwards, the trident falling out of his hands as he lost consciousness.
It was Lestrade who spoke next, making John jump – he had almost forgotten that the lanista was still in the alley with them. "
"Enough!"
"You imagine trying to sleep with that thing staring at you," he continued idly, standing up from his desk and grinning at the shorter man. "Please, come in."
To cover his own discomfort, John leaned down and took Sherlock back into his mouth, loosing a startled cry from the younger man's throat. Sherlock keened desperately as John's lips advanced, and he could feel the muscles and tendons in the Emperor's thighs straining in an effort to thrust upwards without using his hands as leverage.
It was only John's second appearance in the Circus arena, but the people remembered him.
John held him tightly as he came, keeping him all in one place so that he could piece himself together afterwards. Panting helplessly, they sank to the ground, John's loincloth tangled around his feet and Sherlock's own uncomfortably tight around his thighs, still clutching each other close. Sherlock felt as though someone had taken him apart and not quite finished putting him back together.
"Erased it?" John repeated incredulously.
The echo of the man's heartbeat in his throat was faint; John knew from men who had fallen into the Tigris at Ctesiphon that even if he managed to expel the water from his lungs he may not recover. Even so, he pressed and thumped at Small's chest, praying to Juno and all her gods and goddesses to give him just five more minutes, just so that he could see John one more time. He had things he wanted to say, and things he wanted to hear.
Then quite suddenly, the two short swords flicked up to block the blow from the Briton. Watson moved so quickly it was difficult to keep track, the blade in his left hand disengaging from the block to a quick stab at his opponent's stomach. The Briton was lucky he was quick, jumping back hurriedly out of the reach of the swinging blades, but Watson was quicker; his two swords flicked without pause, driving the Briton backwards, further and further. Sherlock tried to think back to the moment where Watson had paused to consider his strategy, but couldn't find it; the shadowed eyes had seemed rather blissfully blank.
The arenarius looked up at him, his eyes wide. "I… I will stay if you wish me to, Sherlock."
He grabbed Tonga's huge hand at the base of the sword and tugged him sharply forwards, unbalancing him, stepping to the side so that the sword travelled under his arm and bringing his own blade down to plunge into the depths of abdominal muscle and catch there until momentum snatched them apart and Tonga hit the sand so hard the arena shook under John's feet.
John did so, tilting his head inquiringly as Sherlock struggled to breathe. The curly-haired ruler smiled weakly at him. "Another moment and it would all have been over," he admitted. John kissed him to hide his smile.
" he called to them. With much chatter among the new children, the group slowly fell into a line facing him. Sherlock pulled his arms behind his back and watched them, ostensibly critical. "This," he said slowly, "is Watson. He served in the military at the battle for Ctesiphon. You will address him as 'sir'. Is that understood?"
He sighed, stretching out his legs and looking briskly out around the arena. "I suppose I must find myself a new lanista," he said forlornly, already dreading the thought of having to promote someone like Dimmock. He would take one of his gladiators, just as Lestrade had come from the court arena, and at least know that he would get along with them.
I could not have helped it, Sherlock, not with you standing there with that fire in your eyes, fidgeting your hands as though you have been forcibly keeping them from yourself waiting for me. Your body feels so fragile and yet so deceptively strong, trapped there between me and the harsh stone wall, chest heaving, not trying in the slightest increment to fight me.
. Most people would linger for a moment on pity for Claudia before jumping straight into that chain of reasoning."
A smile tugged at the corner of John's mouth as he nodded. "It was Mary," he said quietly. "That little girl was Mary."
I am."
? But that could mean anything. Four bodies, four days, four months – "
He squeezed back. "I suppose you could."
They half-lay against the alley wall for a long time, until Sherlock's head had mostly stopped spinning and his breathing had evened out. Then John stood carefully and retied his loincloth, shaking out the dirt first. Sherlock made a few half-hearted attempts to rise, but it was easily apparent that his legs would not work without outside help; John chuckled at his plight and then gently pulled him up and set him on his feet before untying and re-affixing his loincloth. Sherlock watched him wrap the fabric with brisk efficiency, and when it was done John carefully tipped Sherlock's face downwards and kissed him chastely on the lips. "Do not think that I could leave you, Sherlock," he said quietly.
John smiled back at him. "I do not think he has it in him to be rough," he replied. "He is ever the perfect gentleman."
He curled his fingers downwards accidentally and bumped something inside; Sherlock's sharp cry of bewildered pleasure caught him by surprise. "All right?" he asked lightly, stopping the movement of his fingers until his lover pushed his hips down against them in protest.
"Sssh," he comforted. "I will be gentle, I promise, but it may still hurt you a little. If you are uncomfortable, we can do this another night. There are other ways of finding pleasure."
the hound bounded after it, gracelessly shoving his nose at the hole in the wall it capered into.
," Sherlock retorted. He smiled at Claudia. "I occasionally assist the city lawkeepers," he told her. "They share John's inability to see what has been laid in front of them, and I find the puzzle of working it out a welcome change from the drone of politicians."
He couldn't help but moan. John's mouth was warm and soft and slick, and the slide of his tongue sent shivers of pleasure rippling out through his body, curling his toes and tensing his abdomen. "Oh, John," he groaned, sliding a hand down his belly to card his fingers through the gladiator's hair. John hummed, a deep noise of contentment. Sherlock's hips twitched helplessly upwards, pressing desperately against the constraint of the fighter's arm pressed against his hipbones, holding him down.
Sherlock watched as the arenarius slowly headed closer across the room, hands held firmly behind his back, face carefully arranged in an expression of polite deference. He smiled as the older man looked up at him, stopping a safe distance away from the desk. "How are you settling into the court?" he asked, tapping his stylus innocuously between finger and thumb.
Mycroft looked up warily. "Who?" Evidently he was choosing to disregard the previous conversation.
"Of course, my Lord," Lestrade demurred; Sherlock instantly dropped John's hand in favour of clapping his own together excitedly. John frowned; he wasn't quite prepared to see the body of an old army comrade without wearing a loincloth. The silvery-haired man smiled at him. "Would you wait a moment, my Lord?" he asked wryly. "I believe John would like to change first."
Sherlock looked slightly dazed. "Your loincloth," he repeated.
He wanted to look up to the Emperor's box, to see whether Sherlock was angry, but he knew that Tonga would jump at the slightest diversion. He knew that he
, an outcast of society. Sherlock was the
His next jab at the man's chest was deflected quickly and John had to dart out of the way of a smooth strike to his thigh – the one that had been injured the last time that he and Tonga had fought. It still ached slightly when he woke up in the mornings, but he'd been training as normal since it had stopped opening and bleeding when he lunged, so Lestrade had judged him fit to compete in the Saturnalia festival and they had left it at that.
And he strode away, leaving John to trot after him, shaking his head in amazement. There was evidently more to Sherlock Holmes than met the eye, and the eye did not want for much. John wondered if he should be alarmed at the sudden desire to find out what else the Emperor did not know, and what he knew more about than John could ever hope to remember.
understand what it means to have someone in a life where you are used to having no-one."
John arrived at the door to Sherlock's bedchamber almost trembling with nervous anticipation. He was not certain that the Emperor had the same intentions for the night as he did; they had simply agreed to meet, not what they would be doing. It was possible – even likely, considering his enthusiasm the previous night – that Sherlock had entirely forgotten that there
The criminal's smile widened. "I am good with my hands," he bragged calmly. "And the manner of my death is not ultimately your decision."
"In a way," he responded, leaning over Sherlock's chest to wrap the fabric around his wrists. The loincloth was longer than the rope, as well, enabling him to wrap Sherlock's wrists on their own before securing them to the bar so that the wood did not injure them. He stroked the exposed skin of his forearms gently as he tied the final knot and retreated to the foot of the bed, sitting himself cross-legged with his knees brushing the fragile soles of Sherlock's feet. "Now," he considered slowly, letting the smile show on his face. "I think I shall begin
easily. Just the thought of you sitting in this room with your own fingers stretching yourself for me forces a moan from my lips.
John laughed as they rejoined the crowd. Sherlock couldn't help but smile; John's laugh was a wonderful sound, a kind of helpless peal of giggles that he couldn't hold back. There was something childish, pure, joyful about it. "How do you even know how to haggle?" John asked incredulously.
in the Circus Maximus. Even
," John repeated. "Please let me look at it." He took another step until he was right beside the taller man, a hand gently asserting itself against his lower back.
"I will replace it," Sherlock promised the cowering fisherman, who looked to be frozen in utter shock. "In fact, once I have ascertained that Small did not steal this boat, and I do not believe it likely that he did, you may have it if you wish, to keep or sell as you please."
He wasn't sure whether Angelo's grin made him proud that John was so comfortable with what they were, or uncomfortable that his desires were so obvious to an outsider, that someone he respected knew exactly what he hoped would happen right next to the room where he slept. "With pleasure, my Lord."
"Does it hurt?" he asked quietly, licking the sweat from the patch of skin on which his mouth resided.
John did not speak to the Emperor for three days.
"John," Sherlock murmured, his grey eyes glowing orange in the low torchlight. "Look there."
about the way the younger man was staring at him. In the face of it his earlier arguments seemed to lose their relevance. This man
Sherlock smiled as reassuringly as he could – the thought of sending John back out into the arena caused a similar reaction in himself. "I do try, Mrs Morstan," he assured her. "Being in the arena makes him feel alive. I recognise the feeling, loath as I am to continue allowing him to risk his life. If I could find a way to give him both… but I am afraid no such option exists."
off the side of the boat, clinging onto the box of sestertii to pull him under. Then he flipped the catch on the box and flung the sestertii away from him. The silvery coins spun through the air, glinting in the midday sun as though laughing at John, and landed with almost gleeful plunking sounds in the river Tiber.
"He does that," Angelo agreed. "He likes to be certain of people's loyalty, even when he does not have such demands as he made of you. I would have been executed if he had not stepped in to speak for me." John raised a curious eyebrow; he had never asked how Angelo, who had plainly been born and raised in Rome and even used language seldom heard away from the Palatine Hill, had come to be a gladiator. The big man smiled. "I used to work in the court kitchens," he expanded. "I cooked for the Emperor for a while. Sometimes I miss it." John was working very hard at keeping his jaw from dropping; the
"No," Sherlock cut off quickly. "I wonder… I wish to… would you do something for me?"
It was frantic, as though John had been drowning without him and could not breathe him in deeply enough; Sherlock melted against the wall and tugged him closer, so close that it felt like one further pull might see his chest begin to swallow John's completely. John's hands were harsh in his hair and around his hip, and Sherlock's mind surrendered to the scraping of his fingernails, the unbearable sensation of a fast-growing hardness against his thigh.
"Oi!" A deep, rough voice boomed. "What're you two doing? Thieving scum!"
"Are you interested?" he asked, sitting up properly so that their chests were flush together, looking up a tiny increment into John's eyes.
"Thank you."
And then they were gone, and Sherlock was alone with John amid the hustle and bustle of the docks. His first impulse was to throw himself on the shorter man and hold him as tightly as he could until John protested that he could not breathe, but he held back. The case was over now; he had no right to ask or expect John to react positively to his romantic attention.
Sherlock's eyes flicked almost guiltily to his face; at seeing the amused look on John's face, his own twisted into a smile. "I certainly see something I
"If it is good quality, it may be worth two," Sherlock pressed. John gave a small snort beside him, sounding highly amused. The vendor, however, curled his lips into a wry smile.
Once again, his good humour was infectious, and John found himself grinning and chuckling along with the older man. Lestrade quickly broke that good humour by interjecting with, "Oh, and I should warn you, you are likely to meet the Emperor at some point soon. He has a certain fondness for the games, and likes to know each of his gladiators by name."
John grimaced. "I am afraid saying 'no' has never been a strength of mine," he admitted.
through the folds of his loincloth. He may be on his way faster than anticipated to owning John's heart, but John already
John tried: his whole face screwed up in concentration. Sherlock watched in consternation; thinking that difficult looked almost painful. He felt a sudden spasm of crippling fondness for the man in front of him. "I am sorry."
in a way it was highly possible he'd never get. "I will continue to investigate Mary's death until we discover who it was that killed her, but I will not ask you to give me everything you gave to her in return."
him, then at least he may know more about who it may be. And hopefully they could find him and move him to safety before the real murderer did. "I would still like to speak to him."
I saw a few glances between the two of them. Well, that is fantastic, is it not?" Sherlock made an affirming noise that was only a tiny bit sarcastic. He
Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose in a gesture of extreme restraint. "You cannot know that, Sherlock."
And then Sherlock was gone. His hips thrust forward sharply, completely beyond his control, and even his toes tingled with sensation. He'd been inside people before - women mostly, but there had been the occasional young man and nothing had
John pressed two fingers firmly against Sherlock's lips. "I needed
Watson? The woman whose stomach had been –"
"They are gladiators," Sherlock returned. "By definition, none of them are innocent."
Lestrade smiled, wide and so happy that Sherlock couldn't help but smile back. "Thank you, Sherlock."
He tried not to pant as he answered. "It depends how much further ahead of us he is," he explained, cursing his voice as it broke on him. "Whether he is prepared to sail by the time we get there."
Utterly mortified, John tried to keep his shoulders back he stalked off to his quarters.
Forgive me. I must admit I find their relationship somewhat amusing, although the thought of them engaged in the sorts of activities I fantasise about with you is desperately unappealing.
"One auctoratus," Lestrade added at the prompt. Sherlock looked at him in interest; auctorati, the volunteer gladiators, were always interesting. "You might have heard of him, actually. John Watson, his wife was murdered five months ago. It is his first bout as an arenarius."
Sherlock tutted in exasperation, dropping John's hand and turning to the stocky lanista instead. "Yes,
Sherlock nodded sharply, smiling. "I would like that very much."
"Can I ask who your friend is?" she asked, eyeing the hood.
"Fine," the Emperor gasped. "That – that thing, please do that again –
," Sherlock reprimanded, but his voice held no real irritation. John smirked and pressed a kiss to the soft arch.
He had half a mind to bring up how little his Emperor seemed to trust him. He had promised to be Sherlock's
"That was incredibly quick thinking and reacting, though, John," he said bracingly as they set off. John was still holding his hand, and he didn't know how he was supposed to react to that – could the gladiator have had a different reason for refusing his embrace than not wanting him, or was the hand-holding only an attempt to let him down gently?
before it is trapped."
Laughing, he reached for the gladiator, who was doubled up and wheezing but straightened as Sherlock's arms encroached on his line of sight. John laughed and stepped closer, and then they were kissing, adrenaline still bubbling beneath the surface of Sherlock's skin, and every slide of lips on lips set fire to his nerves.
Another chorus of
. I think it may be a feud between the four of them, a secret betrayed or a keepsake stolen, and one of them believes they are owed by the others, wants revenge for the injustice. Or someone else feels betrayed by the four of them. Either way, the obvious next step in the investigation would be to find the last two men, only John cannot remember their names. We were hoping perhaps your husband mentioned them, or you may have met them and remembered them."
At the expression on John's face, Sherlock stopped smiling. He'd seen that expression on Mycroft's face before, and he didn't like it. "It can't possibly be unrelated," he said uncertainly. "It gives us another clue, we are one step closer to discovering why Mary died, is that not good?" The gladiator's eyebrows pinched closer together, but otherwise he did not react. Sherlock floundered. "Look, the most likely explanation,
person without being absolutely certain that you will come out again. I could not stop it last time, but I can and I
The boy scrambled to do as he had asked. Sherlock gave Mycroft a perfunctory smile. "Do enjoy the rest of training, Mycroft," he smirked.
Lestrade pushed him until the two men were covered in a light sheen of sweat and the old wound etched into John's shoulder had started up a low, throbbing ache. After a while, he wondered if he would need to train like this every day; wondered, for a moment or two, whether he would be able to handle the Emperor's court after all.
fought with two swords and no shield, against men with often longer weapons and heavy shields. Sherlock smiled again. This could get interesting.
Lestrade frowned harder. "Where are you going?"
John nodded perfunctorily. "Rest has been thin on the ground recently, I admit, with all of our nocturnal activities."
Gradually, under the onslaught of John's lips and tongue, the skin beneath his stroking fingertips relaxed enough that John felt comfortable enough to slip his index finger past the ring of muscle and into the warmth beyond. Sherlock gasped, his hips arching off the bed so that John's finger immediately withdrew, his hands moving to Sherlock's hips to soothe and still him.
The crowd fell silent; John imagined they were all holding their breath. He knew Sherlock certainly would be. For the space of three careful breaths, he contemplated not disappointing him.
The man's head snapped up and his lips immediately curled into a snarl. "
as he climaxed and that he himself was climaxing now, bent over as his entire body convulsed with pleasure even as the older man's erection continued to throb and spend itself. Each wave of pleasure surpassed the one before until Sherlock screamed with it, wondered if it were possible to die of it, wondered if he would
The taller man seemed to hesitate for a moment, his smile faltering, before it hitched up into a grin to match his own. "See that you do," he said, his deep voice rumbling with good nature. "I look forward to it." His sharp eyes flicked quickly back up to the lanista behind him, the smile widening for an instant before vanishing. "Thank you, Lestrade. You may continue."
For a few steps John was unsure whether to laugh at his straightforward reasoning or be indignant at his insistence on setting this rather punishing pace; laughter won out fairly quickly. "All right," he growled, forcing his legs to give one final push until he stood beside the taller man. "You win, Sherlock."
the Emperor would notice. "I... find it interesting, my Lord. I always have. When I was younger I insisted the physician on our street teach me the things that he knew. I have learned more since then from study. I served in the military for a very short period of time where I had the opportunity to better my anatomical and medical knowledge."

The boy shrugged sullenly. "Me an' Tiger were down there yesserday begging, sir. I 'member seeing them down by the boat building. Jus' hanging round, sir."

I am not permitted to know the identity of your friend?" she asked, her voice slightly frosty.
For a moment, John thought he would throw
"I… yes – I want…" John stuttered in reply. Grinning like a fool, Sherlock reached up to the small jar of oil on the table by the bed and nuzzled his face into John's neck.
"I am sorry," John told him. "I never had much to do with them, other than Mary's father. I only knew Sholto's name because that woman mentioned it first."
The Emperor chuckled. "No. You have been more than careful, John, and now I want – I
, but John still flinched at his phrasing. Sherlock didn't appear to notice, busy as he was arranging his face in a thinking expression. "Lestrade," he said finally, his deep voice absent and slow. "Contact the city lawkeepers. Have
After a few minutes that stretched out endlessly between them, Sherlock stepped forwards and rapped on the door again, the same pattern of five knocks. They waited for another minute or so before John sighed. "Perhaps he
John chuckled. He almost pointed out that Sherlock was not in a position to dictate when it was
The new lanista laughed, and Sherlock felt his heart would burst. "Come," John said brightly, kissing him again and clambering off him, picking up their two abandoned cups of wine and handing one to Sherlock, holding out his own in a salute. "To us. Until we are so old that we can barely see one another."
Sherlock actually rolled his eyes. "I hardly think Jonathan Small and whatever accomplices he has managed to gain himself will dare an attempt to penetrate
Lestrade looked down at the tablet in his hands, frowning. "There will be a lot of inexperience out there, my Lord. Many of them have never fought before." He had protested rather hard over their attending this bout in the first place, probably for this reason. Sherlock smirked. "You may be interested in Anderson, though, my Lord – he has apparently survived this far by running away."
He looked up quickly to see Wiggins running towards him. "Your Excellency!" the boy shouted as he approached. "The one-legged man is leaving! They are leaving on a boat!"
" he said finally, looking uncertainly up at Sherlock. "Within two days of meeting you I felt as comfortable in your company as I do with people I have known for decades. Now, I feel as though I have known you all my life, and yet there is so much about you that I want to
He shook his head slightly to dispel the image. "Um, the man John and I had begun to suspect had his leg severed in the battle of Ctesiphon," he explained clumsily. "The evidence mounts against Jonathan Small…"
And if the Emperor does not follow the laws of his Empire, why should the rest of his citizens? If you are seen to disregard it, everyone will use it as an excuse to break the law.
Sherlock shook his head quickly to get rid of the somewhat alarming notion that a fair amount of who he was seemed to rest in the hands of a volunteer gladiator. "No matter. There is nothing more we can do until morning. I can put out the word that I am looking for Bartholomew Sholto and it should not take long until we find him. For now I think we should go back to the court and get some rest."
could not read your intentions before you carried them out.
," John gasped, his hips bucking upwards before Sherlock held them down. "You are so incredible, and beautiful, and the cleverest man I have ever met – there is not one man in the known world like you. You are amazing, and brilliant, and I – Sherlock, I think I –
Eventually the gladiator pulled back, glancing reluctantly around the alleyway. "We ought to –"
"Sorry," he said quickly, picking up the hood of his cloak and casting it back over his head. "I was… carried away, I should have asked before forcing you into anything."
"What you are," John assured him, a slight smile fighting its way onto his face, "is
Sherlock hesitated. "Would she mind, do you think? If we visited her and brought it up again?"
Unsurprisingly, Sherlock was gathering the black cloaks from the trunk in preparation to leave the room with his back presented to the door. John cleared his throat tentatively, unable to stop his eyes raking down the line of the Emperor's toga, interrupted as it was by the lush swell of his backside. As Sherlock straightened and turned around, though, John's breath left him in a worried huff.
take up the offer,
when they arrived at the arena; the image in his mind of John dressed for the arena, still panting and covered in sweat and oil and approaching him, would certainly not have allowed him to last the morning had he
Sherlock smiled softly and squeezed John's hand in his. He remembered the panic he had felt as a teenager on that street, watching the little redhead girl dressed in rags screaming at her mother and knowing that neither his father nor Mycroft would do anything to help them.
Slowly, he let go of John to put two fingers to his lips and whistle, high and piercing, three long, shrill notes.
John screamed. Pain seared through his leg and he almost fell, the muscles twitching and spasming. Tonga's deep laugh rang in his ears as he staggered; he was showing the man his back, he couldn't stand up properly, couldn't turn around, couldn't do anything to protect himself. He didn't want to
He shook his head, smiling. "I do not think that you would," he said. "And besides, as I said – I have never seen anyone fight the way that you do. I console myself with the knowledge that you are
Holmes led him with unerring certainty through the back-alleys right back to three streets away from the home he had left. John's heart started to pound uncomfortably; around this next corner was where he had found his wife's mangled body. Was he ready to see it again?
Immediately, John detached his mouth from the soft warmth of Sherlock's neck and pushed up onto his elbows over the taller man. "Are you all right?" he asked carefully.
Sherlock raised a cool eyebrow. "I am the Emperor of Rome and all her colonies," he pronounced clearly. "There is nowhere you can run where I will not find you."
Lestrade already knew that Holmes wanted him to, and while he had

as informally as I have been," he admitted. "But I have tried nonetheless, because for this to work, I must believe that wherever in society we each were born and live, as
Sherlock blinked. "I am sorry? I just offered you a chance to completely escape, to gain everything you want from me and give nothing in return, and you are saying
He considered it for the barest of seconds. "This room is my sanctuary. I would like it to be yours, too." He ran his fingers over John's scalp, feeling his hair part under them.
" There were so many reasons he could not that he could barely imagine doing as he was asked. What Sherlock was asking no man could endure without becoming
There was something about Sherlock that contradicted his age, a naiveté that shone through his grey-green eyes that squeezed at John's heart. There were so many things he did not know, brilliant though John believed his mind to be. Things that every child in the city was taught or simply learned themselves through trial and error Sherlock did not seem to know; astrology, mythology,
" he gasped out, his hands clenching into fists full of bedlinen. The other man smiled up at him, licked his lips, and then wrapped his lips around the top half of Sherlock's penis, his tongue squirming firmly around the underside.
He hesitated for a moment, drawing a deep breath and preparing himself for the worst. He wasn't sure what he was supposed to be looking at, but he filled his mind with images of the bloody and rotten remains of a woman's stomach nonetheless. But when he finally did draw the courage to follow the Emperor's long fingers into a shady corner of the street, beside the refuse-pile of the house opposite, he squinted at the dirt for long minutes before turning back to the younger man. "What?" he asked.
It came down to the fact that if he watched enough of their training sessions, the gladiators
John snorted. "Right. Get used to the Emperor. That will happen."
were the Emperor and someone were speaking to him like that, even someone he loved, he would have thrown them to the gladiators in the Circus. He forced himself to smile and toss the fabric over his shoulder with an affectation of carelessness. "Fortunately for you, I enjoy the sound of your voice and I want you to watch me."
The Emperor paused at the corner, looking back at John with a concerned look gracing his face. "Are you sure you wish to look at this?" he asked softly. John took a deep breath and nodded. Holmes smiled at him. "If you wish to leave, please say so," he said gently. "I do not want to cause you pain."
Sherlock kissed him again, quickly, and then brought out the big question. "I went to hold you, before, at the docks, and you turned me away," he said softly. "If you do not want –"
the smile in the older man's voice as he spoke again. "
And there was Sherlock, sitting on the platform reserved for the Emperor and his party. John looked up at him, his swords held carefully point-downwards in the traditional mark of respect, and Sherlock smiled hesitantly at him, as though afraid John would not meet his eyes.
He looked up at John suddenly. "Sorry. I think sometimes that I really have lived a remarkable life." The hand holding his sword began to twist and flick the blade nervously as the lanista seemed to churn something around in his mind. "What did you think of him?" he asked finally.
he wanted it. What he wanted was to divest his lover of the leather skirt he was wearing and take him, to lick the taste of sweat and leather from every inch of his skin. And he
"There were four of them," the auctorati said after a moment. "I forget the names of the others, but they were the most tightly knit group I had ever seen. They went everywhere together."
up and down his cheek, stopping briefly to plant a kiss on his closed eyelid and trail up one eyebrow.
He couldn't help but smile, reaching down to link their fingers together again. "Would you come inside with me? Just for a while."
, Lestrade," he said testily. "Under the circumstances, though, I think the answer should be obvious. John, you said there were four of them, in the army? Mary's father, Sholto, and two others, yes?"
After a moment, he shifted in exaggerated discomfort and looked up at the taller Holmes. Mycroft was still watching him with an ugly sort of leer; Sherlock leaned back against the edge of the bench and steadily gave his brother a smug, satisfied smile.
"John," Sherlock protested, the movement of throwing his head back in frustration accidentally pressing their groins together and making them recoil into one another with a tiny mewling noise from the younger. "The investigation…"
John pulled up short beside him, looking bewildered. "He… liked the dice. I do not think he realised quite how much he was losing until they imprisoned him, but once he discovered that his family knew, he paid his debt in service in the military."
not leave, that this inexplicable bond between them went both ways.
, and John could not be the cause of such slander.
He sounded so sure, so confident. "Would it be hypocritical of me to ask why?" he said, smiling because he knew the answer. John laughed shortly.
It hit him all over again then, just how much he had
Angelo shrugged. "In another life. But the fact remains that every gladiator in the Emperor's court owes his life to Sherlock Holmes. That is what he does – he gives us something incredible so that we will want to please him because of who he is as a person, not as a ruler."
John shrugged. "Perhaps," he conceded. "Perhaps we should go without loincloths. It would make it easier for me to take you in my old bedchamber."
Sherlock lifted his head to meet John's eyes, gleaming with blue-grey excitement. "A crutch," he repeated. "The intruder had one leg."
to grow old with him. John was holding him and breathing in the smell of his hair and settling in, apparently, for the long haul.
And yet, in this one thing, John would far rather he did not. He had stopped himself from snapping harshly at his lover by asking himself how he would feel were it Sherlock in his place, and yet the circumstances were not the same. Though he had not seen Sherlock actually wield the broad blade he strapped to his hip when they went out at night, he was not a fighter, he was the
"Good luck, Watson," he said shortly. Lestrade's mouth twitched slightly as John stepped away from Dimmock, joining him at the door. The Emperor's lanista cocked a lazy half-salute at the smaller man, and then led John out of the gate and across the arena.
The man's manner was infectious. It was extremely difficult not to smile back as he turned to Dimmock. "Thank you, sir," he said quietly. However grudgingly, the lanista had taken him in and trained him, and gratitude was due. Dimmock raised an eyebrow and nodded.
knows how he got into the cages without one of the fighters noticing he was not supposed to be there. I have people searching, my Lord, but I am not sure it is likely they will find him."
John frowned. "You must know. I was taught the map of the stars when I was just a child. Surely as
Sherlock felt himself smiling in delight. "And if I..." he rocked forwards gently, driving himself deeper into the auctoratus. John gasped. Sherlock buried his face in the stocky gladiator's neck, forcing himself to still; the movement had felt like fire. He could only imagine what a firmer motion would do. "You know, the Greeks believe such a bond between men is sacred," he remarked. "It seems they had the right idea about something."
defeat the other man, but the promise of a difficult fight was exhilarating and he couldn't let his attention stray.
"How much?" Sherlock asked the butcher, gesturing towards the hanging strips of meat.
Sherlock quirked a reluctant smile. Much as he disliked his brother, he could not deny anyone the opportunity to have what he and John had discovered. "You are my oldest friend, Lestrade," he said softly. "I want you to be happy."
Sherlock went to spin out of John's room, laughing, only to narrowly avoid tripping over Lestrade coming in the other direction. "Oh! My Lord," the lanista gasped. Sherlock frowned. He had the look of a man so deep in troubling thoughts he had ceased to pay attention to his surroundings.
John was perfectly fine with this development; he bent his back to slide his lips into a more favourable position alongside Sherlock's and kissed him hard, trying to convey his need to stay here and just do this to the other man, firmly manipulating his lips and tongue until Sherlock was whimpering, his hands sliding up and down John's chest and scratching enticingly against his nipples.
John tried to smile. Sherlock's fingers were considerably more delicate than his own. "Not irrecoverably," he replied wryly.
"Dunno," Wiggins replied, shrugging again. "Most like still at Mrs Hudson's. She likes to check up on us when we visit, you know."
John squeezed his hand once for reassurance before he dropped it; Sherlock smiled briefly at his lover and crossed back to the door. It was usually obvious when houses had been broken into, but besides the damage Lestrade had done when he had mercilessly kicked it in, the door bore no signs of forced entry. Sherlock frowned. "Interesting," he muttered.
understand how much your interventions will mean to these children."
"In return, then, I will do everything in my power to find and bring justice upon the men who killed your wife."
There was a vicious-sounding
He was still treating John as though he commanded him – John had commented on that once. It felt like so long ago, but it was really only a matter of weeks. And it had been true then, Sherlock supposed; he had treated John as though he were some kind of ancient, lascivious Greek pottery because he had been trying so hard to avoid the fact that he
"No," Holmes said softly, straightening and adjusting the hood over his head. "It would be better to avoid confrontation. Take my hand." He held it out palm-up, warm and large and masculine. John took it, feeling the dry slide of their palms together.
"Yes, my Lord," John said firmly. "I hold myself a fairly decent judge of character, and you… I am comfortable being intimate with you. But I am not comfortable with you giving me something I want so badly without taking anything in return."
Claudia Morstan nodded slowly. "And… you seem to have made a great deal more progress in finding my daughter's attacker than the city lawkeepers, my Lord. Do you often follow these investigations?"
him, into his fears and desires and secrets. "Forgive me," the man concluded finally. "Enjoy the rest of your evening."
The vendor paused, turned back to him. "For you, three," he amended.
John's head snapped back around in order to catch Sherlock's lips with his own. "I am infinitely grateful that you allow me this, Sherlock," he said.
John barely had any time to settle before he was summoned out to the court arena, the noon bell ringing in his ears. He was surprised to find when he arrived that the arena was empty but for Lestrade, standing in the middle of the sand and twisting a sword around in one hand. The arena itself was smaller than he expected, too, the stone tiers of the stands only three rows high. He wondered how many people were expected to watch.
Lestrade hummed agreement. "More likely some sort of crutch," he said, his knees cracking as he stood.
we?" he asked.
what he wanted made his blood sing through his body. The idea of
There was a pause as John shifted hesitantly. "I… there is no training in the morning. If you like, I could stay."
Holmes looked at it for a moment, his eyes narrowed critically. "I can tell you she did not die here," he said slowly.
Wiggins stopped dead in the middle of the boarded path; Sherlock, eyes fixed on the boats and attempting to scan them for the black imposter and the one-legged Small, would have barrelled straight into him had Angelo not flung out a hand to stop him. "Apologies, my Lord," he smiled, once Sherlock had realised what he had done.
"He was almost…
He nodded slowly. "I will speak to him about it," he agreed, unable to keep the smile off his face. "Thank you, Lestrade. Take care of my brother – and make certain that he takes care of
The shorter man looked sharply at him. "You will allow me to kill him?" he asked, sounding surprised.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at the delay in his answer. The expression brought back something the younger man had said earlier
John smiled. "A little, my Lord, but I am certain it did not affect today's exercises."
, John," Sherlock interrupted, not sure he liked the way John was describing him. Mind-reading sounded terribly invasive.
. "You can stay here tonight, at least," he said practically, "but then you must leave until training is over and you can come back."
, and he was a wonder and a prodigy and John was completely in awe of him, and it was
You are so demanding. Evidently I must try harder to reduce you to incoherence.
John smiled as politely as he could manage. "Yes, sir."
John chuckled. "Are you certain that you will be able to stand this?" he asked, lifting his head and resting it on the bump of Sherlock's thigh. "Once your hands are tied, if I wish to do this slowly you cannot encourage me to do otherwise."
John Watson stared up at him for a moment, apparently lost for words. "You would do that, my Lord?"
"You cannot outrow us," Sherlock called out, in the same calm, ringing, authoritative voice he had used on Small. The big man's strokes faltered minutely, but otherwise he gave no indication that he had heard. Sherlock frowned; when he spoke again, John was mildly surprised to hear the words in smooth Greek. "You saw what we did to your acquaintance."
The elder Holmes frowned at him. "What is it you can offer him?"
John swallowed thickly, staring at Sherlock with wide, disbelieving, even slightly mistrustful eyes. "
Sherlock nodded again. "We are looking for two men. One of them is a big black-skinned man with an injured foot – he may be walking with a limp. The other is slightly more distinctive – he only has one leg and he walks using a thick wooden crutch. These two men are very dangerous and you are
John gaped at him, his jaw hanging obviously open until Sherlock's eyebrow made a wry skywards bid. "A-are you certain?" he stuttered helplessly.
Sherlock sighed. "I had not thought. I understand that there are risks, Lestrade. Simply his agreeing is less likely than I have allowed myself to think."
The sails were only loosely fixed to the base of the mast, and so when the wind attempted to catch on them and push them forwards they flapped out towards Sherlock before the ropes caught and they stretched taught. Even so, the little boat trembled and jumped forwards, gliding smoothly alongside the larger craft and beginning, too swiftly, to overtake it entirely. John hastily drew his oar inside the boat, but it was not enough, they were going too fast –
"Is everything all right, Lestrade?" he asked gently, placing a steadying hand on his friend's arm.
Then he bowed to the Emperor, turned a full circle for the crowd, and watched the ebony-skinned killer lope easily out of the cage and into the arena.
. "And you have not even met him yet."
John's frown turned into a curious half-smile. "Indeed - I cannot imagine you standing still for a sculptor, actually. You are too full of energy and vitality." His hand reached up to trail fingers down Sherlock's chest, between the gentle swells of his pectorals. "You would make a stunning marble, though."
He knew it was, but he shook his head helplessly. It was important to him, too. "I cannot," he said, his voice catching on the long vowel. Angelo smiled sympathetically.
It felt as though the world was falling away from him; he didn't think anything could be more difficult. Holmes' eyes anchored him, just the glint of them in his face visible in the dark, serious and sympathetic. There was a large hand on his arm, gripping below the shoulder-blade, and John lifted his own hand to hold it in place, because without it he felt sure he would fall.
Dimmock dipped his head in acknowledgement, his own smile oddly incongruent to the harshness in his eyes. "But an exceptional gladiator."
"Indeed." Sherlock held the silence for a moment, struggling for the protocol. "Very different from Dimmock, I have heard."
John was fiddling with the hilt of the sword tucked against his left hip. "I simply feel as though you and I

part," he agreed. He put down the Emperor's foot and shifted onto his knees, only to bend over and suckle a faint mark into the side of first one knee, then the other. Sherlock closed his eyes, his head tipping back onto the bed, his curls fanning out against the off-white linen. John's breath stuttered in his chest.
The Emperor's eyes gleamed. "Yes, I think so," he said.
"And that would be where you gained the wound to your shoulder?" the Emperor asked, one dark eyebrow arching into his hairline.
John crouched to the same level – ignoring the screaming pain in his leg – and placed a finger over his lips. "I know," he said quietly. "And I am sorry for the way I reacted. I do know that you care, and it means a lot to me."
At the sound, Holmes' head snapped around, the hood slipping further back and allowing a few curls to protrude over the lip. "Are you all right? If you need to leave, just say."
I can hardly breathe. Imagine what the public would think if they could see you like this, on your knees for one of your slaves with my hot, throbbing arousal buried halfway down your throat.
). Yesterday I had the privilege of attending a lecture from Stephen Orgell, renowned Shakespeare scholar, on the eroticism of the boy actors who used to play women. It was absolutely fascinating stuff and I am not looking into the fact that I came out of it determined to write a Johnlock Lord Chamberlain's Men AU wherein Sherlock is one of those men who played women. My dilemma is which Shakespeare to make the crux of the story. I was thinking
If only so that they could all know that you are mine, and I am not sharing you with any of them. What is between us is for you and me alone. The rest of the Empire has no right to see you the way I do. The force with which I want to keep you would frighten me if I were not sure that I
The silver-haired warrior coughed lightly. "If I might make a suggestion as to my replacement, my Lord?" he asked, frowning as though what he were about to say had weight beyond the surface.
John clenched his fists to curb the overpowering urge to strangle the man and instead dropped into his chosen language. "You have killed two people who did nothing wrong," he replied coolly.
John Watson deliberated for a few moments. Sherlock could see the moral obligation, his loyalty to Mary, battling with the human desire for comfort in the kind wrinkles around his eyes. Then the gladiator nodded to himself. "I would. If it is your wish, Sherlock."
Sherlock smiled at him. "Gladly. If you would be my lover."
We now have a tumblr! Follow us at mr-csi.tumblr.com.
John chuckled, and with a last brief tug at each other's clothes they started back down the alley. "What will you do with Tonga, now?" he asked as they turned back into the street. A woman carrying a box of apples shot them a startled look before scampering away with a murmured, "Your Excellency". Sherlock smiled at her, wondering if it was obvious that he had just had John's genitalia in his mouth.
of the Empire."
I think they understand exactly
Sherlock reached up to the hood again. "Someone might see," he protested.
Claudia was frowning mightily now. "I am not sure," she said. "I remember him. He visited me when Mark died – he was also wounded at Ctesiphon. I am not sure he is capable of such brutal murder with only one leg."
John sat up with a huff. "Do you honestly believe that?" he asked. "With all the opportunities you have given me to leave, to take what I want and give nothing in return, do you really still think that I would still be here if I did not want to be?" He reached out to touch Sherlock again, and ended up grasping his hand. "I
Of course, my love. Your body is so warm underneath mine, so comfortable. I love you, Sherlock, the taste of sweat under your jaw and the ticklishness you try to hide from me when I lick there, the feeling of your renewed arousal slick with oil throbbing against my own between our legs and the noises you make when I move my hips, the fact that I can do this forever and ever and ever.
Sure enough, a demanding shout of, "John!" summoned him from around the corner. Breathing deeply to stay calm, John ventured back into the alley. Sherlock was crouched over the body, but his attention was on the symbol that had been daubed in blood on the wall of the nearest house. "John," he continued as he heard their footsteps behind him. "Do you think –"
, John," he said, though the dignity of the words was somewhat lost when they devolved into a broken moan at the renewed feeling of John's mouth on his prick.
"Sherlock!" John gasped. "What if someone sees?"
Watson nodded slowly to show that he understood. Sherlock took in a few deep breaths; this was the important part, the make-it-or-break-it line. "As such, I believe I would owe you a generous favour in return," he said evenly. "I do not wish to degrade you by paying for your... time," he decided, trying to avoid the word 'services'.
"I do not care." Mycroft tried to look stern, but the tiny fond smile was obvious behind his eyes.
They caught up to each other just outside the walls, in the shadow of the arched entranceway. A few people who had not been able to find seats inside the arena milled around outside, but none of them noticed the Emperor as he stopped, breathless, two feet from John. Unwilling to speak, they stared at each other. Sherlock didn't

could barely believe it had worked.
What John wanted to know was
Sherlock smiled brilliantly, feeling his heart swell impossibly larger, feeling the time when he had believed that he did not have one vanish from his memory. "To us," he agreed, tapping their cups lightly together before letting the spiced fluid flow over his tongue, warm and full of sunshine. "To us."

"Magnificent," he called, his deep voice resonating incredibly through the space. "From both of you. I did not know you still had it in you, old man."
John rolled his eyes. "Humour me," he pleaded. With a
was the 'dominant' partner and Sherlock must be lower-status. Sherlock would have smiled had he not been so worried by the way the stocky gladiator had set his feet as though preparing for a fight. "Leave him alone," John snarled.
John woke slowly in someone's arms, long toes digging into his lower calf and thick curls halfway up his nostrils. It should not have been pleasant, but he smiled and clutched his Emperor tighter to him nonetheless.
He turned then to look at him, and John must not have kept his face clear enough, because the Emperor's fell quickly into an expression of utter horror. "Oh, John," he said, approaching him hesitantly. "I am so sorry. I did not think – if you need to leave…"
, and John was staring right at him, and the tall, dashing man was staring right back, his breath fast in his chest, eyes wide, so
The man's companion was pulling at his toga, and at the uttered threat he relented; without another word, the two of them turned and sprinted off down the alleyway. Instantly, John was crowding up to him, prying his fingers away from his face to squint at it in the dark. "Are you all right?" he asked frantically.
"Terrible, is it not?" he commented loudly.
him. If he were around them enough, they began to treat him in much the same manner as they treated Lestrade; with the respect owing to their superior, but a certain degree of comfortable affection that all the noble men in Rome could not seem to bring themselves to show him. He felt as though he had
"Would you race me back?" he asked suddenly, feeling as though he could beat the fastest sprinters in the old Olympian track games.
"That would certainly make the job easier," Sherlock agreed warily. "I value your opinion a great deal, you know that."
Remembering Sherlock's various comments about the footprints in the other alley, John stepped closer and bent over the patch of sand he was being directed at. "It… is normal. There are no footprints, it looks barely disturbed. A clear patch of fresh sand."
The gladiator looked as though he was expecting a reply, but Sherlock couldn't muster one. He was entirely out of words; in reply to the slightly worried frown developing on John's delightful face he tried to push some out regardless. "I… you…"
, wanted to forgive and be forgiven.
After a confirming glance at John, who nodded slowly, Sherlock lowered his hands from his lips. "Thank you," he said to her. "I will set people to find him tomorrow."
," he said gravely. John's heart made a strange thumping motion – of dread or elation, he could not tell – at the sound of his first name in that voice. "This next question will be difficult, but if you can… I need you to describe her injuries."
"A woman?" Sherlock frowned.
you can see it is actually fresher than the surrounding sand. Someone has replaced the sand in this particular area but not even the street surrounding it. Can you think of a valid reason to do so that does not involve covering something on the sand below?"
He looked down at himself; he had thought that the dagger was hidden from the outside eye. He had placed it carefully, in case Holmes became too rough or threatening. Knowing that the Emperor must have spotted it immediately, John felt his face flush with embarrassment. One thick eyebrow arched upwards, tugging the corner of Holmes' cupid's-bow with it. "Do not mistake me, Watson. I am pleased you still
The younger man smiled. "Apparently not," he replied easily. "Or, if I ever was, I erased it. It is not exactly relevant."
Gently – always so
John became aware that his mouth was open and closed it hurriedly. Then opened it again. "Brilliant," he said softly. "That… I could not have come up with that logic on my own."
of a man touching him so gently, in control while Sherlock lay back and closed his eyes against the sensations John's mouth and hands were flooding his body with.
Sherlock was frowning. John could see it from the arena; not the precise expression, not from this distance, but the way he was sitting close to the edge of the box and the awkward slump of his body betrayed him. The pinched, worried expression on his angular face was very easy to picture. John wanted to go up there and kiss it off his face, but there were things he had to do first.
John nodded. "Yes."
The Emperor rolled his eyes. "Why would someone attempt to murder your wife, or your old military friend? We must be on the right track in our investigations. Had I not been so fearful for your life, I would be delighted."
"John," Sherlock panted, his hands turning to grip at John's shoulders, pulling him away. "John, stop."
"My Lord Emperor, I am afraid I must insist –" the guard broke off mid-sentence; there was a flurry of activity outside the door, a low, insistent voice, and then a clatter of armour as the guards moved away from the door. He looked up into his lover's face and frowned.

Again, John chuckled. "I hardly think Mary would complain, Sherlock. If you wish to please me, I am in no position to argue."

asking.
John tried to swallow the lump in his throat, but it stubbornly stayed put. "I know," he murmured back. "Thank you." He bent to kiss Sherlock, gentle and caring – he couldn't say it, he just
It was true that Sherlock was unlikely to be hurt with two extremely capable gladiators at his side – especially given that Angelo would be focussed only on Sherlock's safety, even where John might forget about it in favour of Small. Even so, he still felt vulnerable without the weight of his familiar weapon at his hip. He shifted uncomfortably. "How long have they been preparing to sail, Wiggins?" he asked, watching Small flap his hands at his surly-looking black accomplice, leaning heavily on his crutch.
A smile found its way across Sherlock's face. "An old widow who lives just outside the court. Her husband was not a man I would want anyone to be attached to for any length of time, and I managed to prove that he had murdered his brother and have him thrown to wild animals. Now she helps me to take care of the children when they need it – her daughter works in the court kitchens so she has an excuse to come into the court and find me. The perfect middlewoman." John smiled weakly – the same smile, Sherlock noticed, as he had given when Sherlock had introduced him to the collection of orphans. "She would treat me as though I were her own child," he added wistfully. "Far more than my mother ever did."
He raised an eyebrow at this somewhat obvious statement, but he was not yet certain that he trusted his voice to speak. John, smiling softly but still tense, his shoulders hunched uncomfortably and his fists clenched, voiced the slightly sarcastic, "Yes," that was in his mind anyway.
Holmes smiled slowly. "Evidently." He took a tentative step forwards. "If you wish to postpone… if you are not ready to revisit the place where she was found…"

Sherlock nodded. "Thank you, Wiggins." He drew a small pouch from the folds of his cloak. "I can trust you to distribute this, can I not?" he asked the boy, who nodded sullenly. "Do any of you need the attentions of a physician?"
His hands were trembling a little nonetheless, though from nerves or the intense, impatient arousal still throbbing through his body he could not quite tell, and when he went to pour a small amount over his fingers it ended up dripping over the Emperor's pectorals, sliding innocently between them and further down towards his stomach with each gasping breath.
"Who is it?" John tried to ask, but the Emperor was already sitting up, twisting away from him, his face scrunched into a petulant frown.
The tiniest flash of panic surged through his veins, but the pause was enough; the slave jabbed his trident into the thick leather of John's gloves, scraping the skin underneath before yanking it free again.
Lestrade shrugged in acquiescence, looking dejected. John smiled softly. Sherlock nodded. "I did not expect so," he said, a tiny note of comfort in his voice. "Take John to have that wound checked," he continued, not letting go of John's hand. "Tomorrow evening we will revisit Bartholomew Sholto's house. We will require Cerberus."
pleasure. If you wish to touch me, to bring me to completion, I should be thanking
There was a pause before Sherlock replied, his hand stroking hopefully up John's back. "I… suppose not," he said slowly.
They stopped before the final door to the court; Sherlock ducked quickly into a side-passage that John had not even noticed was there and returned with two torches. John took one; he had not entirely finished processing that the Emperor had left his side before he was back and already darting on ahead. He shook his head as he picked up his footsteps to catch up: he supposed it was a part of the role of Emperor and
He frowned. "We need further help," he said, looking down at John. "Help that for various reasons I would prefer Lestrade and Quintus not to know about."
The stringy, pale man's creeping led him backwards towards Watson; the auctoratus flicked his sword into an upright position. Seeing what he intended, Sherlock let out a dry laugh; after a moment, Anderson's retreating back gently prodded into the point of the sword. Jumping, the taller man spun around. Watson cracked a sudden, jovial smile; snarling, Anderson hefted his shield and swung his sword into an offensive position, leaving his back unguarded against the Briton he'd been running from in the first place.
John and Angelo, used to rhythmic training exercises in the arena – Lestrade was particularly fond of them – fell into an easy rhythm together fairly quickly, and for a few moments it seemed they were gaining on Small. The fisherman, however, turned to Sherlock. "Your Excellency, please forgive me, but if they catch the wind we will not be able to reach them."
, which I adore but I'm not sure serves the purpose of bringing John and Sherlock together the way I want it to. The point of my mentioning this here is that if anyone has any suggestions I'd be delighted to hear them. Thanks so much!
on fanfictiondotnet. You have made this story an absolute joy.
Silence settled between them again as John smiled gratefully. Sherlock looked as though there were words stuck in his throat and he could not cough hard enough to dislodge them. It looked rather painful. John took a deep breath – there was something that he, too, ought to have said several days ago. He cleared his own throat, gently, wondering if what came out of it would be right.
The murderer had stopped rowing when the sails fell; now he dropped the oars entirely and folded his arms sullenly over his chest. John glanced at Sherlock, who had raised an eyebrow at the criminal as if to say,
Sherlock's breath caught. "Say that again," he pleaded.
Inside, the house was beginning to smell of disuse; Sherlock noted a mouse scrambling frantically across the floor when Lestrade bent to light the candles on the dresser with his torch. Cerberus saw the mouse an instant after Sherlock did; with a deep

for sitting beside me while I lay there – I'm not sure you know how much it means to me just to have someone else in the same room.
John smiled, so softly Sherlock could actually see it trembling a little in its earnest. "With pleasure, Sherlock."
Without clothes, my dearest, you would have difficulty hiding your inappropriate reactions from everyone who glanced in your direction while you were watching the gladiators train.
. Sherlock nodded. "Thank you. Keep an eye out for those men – someone at the docks at all times, is that understood? And make sure you spend those sestertii on food."
John grinned again. "I said I would walk you home. All the way to your bedchamber doors."
John's hands shifted from his scalp to his neck. "So," he breathed into his hair. "You will need to find a new lanista."
Sherlock tried to smile patiently instead of roll his eyes at her blustering. "What did she say?"
Sherlock returned his timid smile. "I do not wish to upset her," he replied, also keeping his voice down in case she was about to answer the door. "But the questions I wish to ask are about upsetting matters. And…" he paused, not sure if his other worry was valid or whether John would laugh. "You were married to her daughter, and I am your lover. That naturally makes me the enemy, does it not?"
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply, but John got there first. "He is
Sherlock frowned. "I ought to be angry," he said, but his voice shook.
John Watson entered Sherlock's bedchamber hesitantly, looking around in what seemed to be wonder at the paintings on the walls and the awful bust of his father on a side-table by the door. Sherlock smirked as he saw John's gaze linger on the marble bust.
Sherlock shrugged, conceding the point: it would seem that they
that he has. You have seen it, my Lord – he understands the art of the arena, understands what move his opponent will make before they make it and how to counter it. That is something that very few fighters truly have, and I believe it makes up for his comparative lack of experience in the arena."
Sherlock made a noise of frustration. "No. No, he cannot be. We would have woken him by now, in any case –"
Sherlock had buried his face in John's chest until John could feel his eyelashes fluttering against his sternum. "I
Angelo dropped his oar, letting it be carried over the side of the boat and swallowed by the river, and instead drew a knife from his loincloth and plunged it into the wooden prow of Small's boat and held on. The boat lurched again, water slapping over the sides as their progress was abruptly held back.

. His pride in the eyes of the city of Rome was already destroyed; the only thing he had left was his pride in his own eyes, and those of Lestrade, and the Emperor himself.
The younger man looked at him in surprise. "I…" His pale eyes gazed at John almost suspiciously, as though trying to find a gap in his eager mask. John grinned. "Would it be too much tomorrow? No doubt Lestrade will make you work hard in the morning."
with which he wielded the sword and dipped and dived with it, that had Sherlock on edge and fidgeting on his seat. He wondered briefly whether he would have to stop watching the gladiators train or spend the rest of his days in a sort of perpetual state of arousal.
The lanista smiled at the lie. John shook his head. He
, John realised. He looked up at the slave, still poised and grinning.
John sat up, worried. "Did I…"
They wandered through the square idly so as to blend in better with the other people packed into the city centre; a few people glanced at Sherlock more than once, looking puzzled, but most dismissed him. He could feel John fidgeting beside him, clearly itching to argue the point Sherlock had made earlier. It was somewhat comforting to know that he had the last word over this matter, that John could not risk his life here again if Sherlock did not wish it.

Sherlock caught his breath as John positioned himself over him, his grey-green eyes wide. "Are you ready?" John asked him steadily, wondering what he would do now if Sherlock answered in the negative.

Surprised, Sherlock took it and let their joined hands rest on the tabletop. Claudia's eyes caught on them, but to Sherlock's further surprise, she merely smiled further and said nothing. "…But, seeing you now I will not worry about that," she finished softly. "I can see that you are happy. I cannot understand why you would choose the life of a gladiator, but I can accept that it seems to be what you want."
"I did get that impression," John remarked, turning back to see the lanista grinning at him. "I cannot imagine why."

"Jonathan Small."
He allowed himself to breathe again, unlocking his muscles from their defensive positions. "Fine," he agreed. "Thank you, Angelo."
Will you go?
He shrugged. It seemed careless, but the two of them both knew that it was anything but. "I wish to grow old with you," John said quietly. "I cannot do that if I am killed in the arena."
For a few moments the only sounds echoing through John's ears were his own heartbeat and their heavy, desperate breathing. Sherlock shifted his newly-freed arms to John's back and squeezed them, pulling him uncomfortably closer. John just chuckled lazily, too exhausted to protest, and kissed the nearest part of him, feeling slightly dazed, as though observing everything from underwater.
The wind made a brilliant searing sound as it sped past his ears and the cloak billowed out behind him, completely useless as the shield it was supposed to be against any passers-by as the hood blew violently off his face, leaving him vulnerable to a freshening burst of wind on his face, and he was laughing out loud with the joy of it all, feeling the burn in his legs as he caught up to the gladiator and then overtook him, sending a shouted "Keep up, John!" back at him that was almost lost in the wind. Evidently the gist of it survived, though, because John was laughing back and putting on an extra burst of speed; they were neck and neck, and the wall of the palace caught up with them so fast Sherlock almost didn't see it coming until it was right in front of him. There was just enough time for him to stick out his hands to brace himself for impact before he hit the wall, barely a moment before John did the same.
that Sherlock's heart kept forgetting when to beat. When finally he could handle the sight no longer, he carefully slid his fingers out and feverishly removed his own loincloth, running his hands down and up John's thigh, grazing against his groin before winding up to his face, careful not to touch John's face with the hand he had just removed from the gladiator's arse.
The Emperor laughed helplessly. "Yes, very
"Actually, Lestrade made a suggestion," Sherlock told him. "And I agree with him."
another side to their agreement than the investigation. But John did not mind putting the investigation aside for one night now that it felt so keenly as though they were making progress; especially not if he then spent that night showing his gratitude to the man who had made it happen.
Sherlock peered cautiously at the house to which the refuse pile belonged. "Shall we find out?" he said briskly, pulling the hood of his black cloak over his face further and gesturing towards the house.
John chuckled again, his fingers fiddling with a loose curl adventuring across Sherlock's forehead. "You
John looked down at himself in confusion. He had assumed that they would not be spending terribly long in clothing at all, and had worn only a simple chiton over his loincloth. "My Lord?" he questioned, frowning up at the taller man.
Sherlock sat back on his heels and reached for the tie on John's loincloth. He had thought in the past that thinner undergarments should be a serious point of investigation with the court seamstresses, especially in regard to ease of removal. And yet right now lifting John's hips and unwrapping the fabric of his loincloth slowly, like unwrapping a gift or a sword, seemed the most delightful thing in the world and made him shudder with anticipation. "Lift," he whispered against John's belly – firm when he kissed it and the older man chuckled, soft when he nosed against it and the muscles relaxed – and John did, arching his back until his hips were off the bed and Sherlock could reach under, untie his loincloth and unwind the layers of fabric from under him, exposing him bit by bit.
He imagined, suddenly, what it would be like to
John frowned at the sudden downgrade in familiarity. "Whatever happened to calling me 'John'?" he asked indignantly, once again picking up the pace before he was left behind.
-Mr CSI
"Under the torchlight we should easily follow the droplets. Even the footprints are visible. Are you ready?" he stopped for another brief concerned look before John forced his shoulders back and nodded.
He bent quickly to an animal skin adorning the floor underneath a low table. "Lestrade," he called. "What would you say made these marks?" He gestured to a series of scuff marks on the pelt – some exotic animal most likely killed abroad in his time in the military, Sherlock dismissed. "A staff, or spear, perhaps?"
John ignored him. So he tried again. "She screamed when I cut open her stomach. It is incredible, how quickly people stop being brave when you hurt them."
"I love you," he gasped out.
" Small screamed at his companion, hobbling back to the sails to direct them into the wind while the black fighter took up oars and began to haul them away.
The dimachaerus nodded, his smile struggling not to break out into something that might be considered rude, although Sherlock wished he could see it. "Of course, my Lord."
Sherlock Holmes was sitting at his desk again when John knocked gently on the door; at the sight of him, the Emperor stood up hastily. "Watson," he said, his voice suddenly breathy. John smiled.
I had intended to get this out to you much sooner, but it was my first time writing anything quite this pointedly smutty. It was by turns the most challenging and the most intensely erotic thing I have ever done, and I now regret the years I spent laughing at erotic fanfiction authors. I'd tip my hat to you all if I hadn't already eaten it as per a previous statement.
"I am not sure I approve of this kind of fighter in your court," the silvery voice interjected from the corner of the box. Sherlock turned a long-suffering expression on his brother. "Although, you already know my opinion on having fighters in the court at all."
, and I cannot possibly repay you for the things you have done, right from the first moment you –
The sword from John's left hand sank neatly into the sand between the convict's legs. The big man looked at him for another heartbeat before he bent to pick it up. He didn't seem surprised at the move.
means nothing. There is nothing
Somehow, when they had spun and he had almost fallen, John had ended up facing the Emperor's box. Sherlock was standing up, one hand in front of his mouth, the other held behind him, Lestrade's tanned fingers wrapped around his wrist as though to stop him from jumping out of the box and into the crowd.
The dimachaerus stood for a few more moments, breathing shallowly, his face carefully blank. Then he nodded sharply. "I know," he admitted, stepping forwards and collapsing into Sherlock's arms. "You have done far more than I had any right to expect."
John swallowed. Sherlock's hand found his again, clasping it tightly. "Can you read, John?" the Emperor asked quietly.
die, hopefully you will look on me with some sort of fondness. A seasoned gladiator can be a handy man to have on your side. I should know, I am one."
many laws, so I put it to the back of my mind and left it there. And then… well, you and John made it work, made it look so
He forced himself to slow down, to not accept the response straight off, tempting as it was to seal the arrangement without ensuring the other man was certain. "You must take some time to think about it, Watson. To be sure that you can give me all I ask for, because it is a great deal to ask. I would hate for you to be uncomfortable, but feel that after giving your word you could not back out."
And they ran; John's blood pounded in his veins, the adrenaline spurring him to keep up with the Emperor as he sped around corners and down alleys, not seeming to look where he was going and yet somehow appearing to know exactly where they were. When the sounds of pursuit faded, John began to laugh, the excitement bubbling out of his chest. Once, Sherlock Holmes looked back at him, his own face alight with the thrill of the run and beaming.
After another, more languid kiss, John pulled away and stared down the alley at the patch of sand that had been re-swept to erase the signs of Sholto's blood, at the gaudy
He cut off abruptly as Watson finally lunged, the sun glancing briefly off his twin blades as they swung around, before the opponent shrieked and dropped his weapon. Blood spurted out of his wrist; Lestrade made a noise of extreme interest. The blow had cut the tendon that controlled the thumb: the gladiator would never fight again.
He placed one foot on Tonga's huge chest, bent, and slashed his throat open with a slightly over-dramatic sweep of the sword.
John trailed off, waiting for Sherlock to finish the sentence. He smiled eagerly. "Yes." He shifted hesitantly, unable to stop his eyes from flickering to the bed.
The other gladiator grinned up at him. "It was my pleasure," he said earnestly, digging his knee into his captive's back. "Here –" he passed his knife to Sherlock, who handed it to John. "Stick that back in her side and we should be able to lash the boats together – this one only has one oar now, I am afraid."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "He has an interest in the human anatomy. He sought the knowledge he has on his own terms, not through his profession. He saved lives at Ctesiphon."
John's face softened minutely, and he leaned forwards to place a gentle kiss on Sherlock's lips. Sherlock deepened it, trying to apologise with lips and tongue where he couldn't quite form them into the right words, but John was not fully participating and it was an empty kiss from which he emerged disappointed.
"The docks, John, the docks!" Sherlock shouted, ignoring the second question as obvious. "Small is making a break for it, there is no time to waste!"
Sherlock was proud of owning John like this.
The Emperor's mouth flinched into a tiny knowing smile. "I can see through the window into the kitchen," he said smugly. John stood on his tiptoes, praying Sherlock would not notice this was necessary to peer through the window, but he could see nothing that explicitly told the younger man any of the things he had said.
They couldn't keep up the pace forever, but neither could their adversary; surely at this pace they would come close enough to board the larger boat before the strain of rowing became overwhelming. And yet, John was very aware that the huge fighter was now in a position where he had absolutely nothing to lose, and that could do wonders for a man's stamina. There was the tiniest sliver of possibility that this extra burst of frantic energy might come to the man just as John and Angelo began to flag, and it might just be enough to let him pull away from them. It was of course the merest of possibilities, but John could not help but let it fester in his mind; his own thirst for revenge might enable him to match the fevered strokes of the desperate man, but Angelo would surely not be able to keep up.
It was Sherlock's turn to laugh. "Do not worry; the few times I met Dimmock he struck me as a boring and pompous simpleton. I hardly think 'respect' is the aim of his style of authority."
"I am not simply looking for a body to fill my bed. I would wish you to... participate. Were I seeking simple gratification, there are many people here who have made it their trade. I wish to feel as though my desire is returned." He was completely aware of how pathetic the words sounded, but he had to make it clear what he wanted to avoid disappointment later. "I ask for a lot more than a sexual partner."
was interested in everything, us gladiators no exception. When he was ten he begged me to teach him how to handle a sword. Had I known then that he would become Emperor perhaps I would not have done it." The smile on his face adopted a faraway quality; John could not help but smile with him, thinking of a young, gangly Sherlock Holmes with unruly dark curls struggling to hold up a sword. "I thought it best he knew how to handle himself. He ran around with no thought for his own safety. And I think I liked that he seemed to find me...
. Sherlock scrambled back up John's body to press their lips together feverishly, lowering his hips until their erections bumped together and Sherlock's whole body burned. He whimpered into John's mouth and thrust his hips helplessly a few times, feeling the gladiator's chest heave and his breath puff past his cheek. "John," he gasped out. "May I…"
And then they were there, standing perfectly openly in the street where Mary died, where he'd found her bloody and broken, where his life as he had known it had ended. Holmes was crouching over the smear of blood across the packed dirt of the alley that was all that remained, his hand poised above it, the hood of the cloak draped over his curls and pooling on his shoulders like obsidian. It was such juxtaposition that John felt dizzy.
There was a pause, but John did not believe that Sherlock had expected the command to be obeyed, and the voice spoke again, firmer this time. "Sherlock Holmes," it said sharply, "Emperor or not, you will open this door right now or I will have it broken in."
. Because you are kinder than your father, and you care about us."
For a while he had thought that the tall ruler would attempt to limit the weapons that he sent John into the arena with, or send someone else out with him in case the fight began to look evenly-matched. But it was with his two short blades in hand that John stood underneath the cages, frowning out at the convicted prisoners attempting to outrun the three unfamiliar gladiators in the Circus arena, the sweat from a previous contest cooling on his chest.
John nodded thoughtfully. "I never knew you were a cook," he said.
First of all, thank you so much to everyone who took a personal interest in the development of this story:
Slowly, his eyes never leaving John's, Sherlock's hands moved to grip John's hips tightly and push him another inch backwards. Then the lanky ruler whimpered, tipped his head back, and started to thrust.
