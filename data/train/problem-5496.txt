But it was obvious that Steve didn’t believe him, thought Tony was saying it for Steve’s benefit, but not because it was true.
For the prompts “Handcuffed together” (cap_ironman bingo) and “you had me at hello” (avengers_tables).
“You are one kinky motherfucker,” Steve hears dimly as he opens his eyes, and he groans, immediately shutting them again.  His whole body aches, muscles throbbing, his throat devastatingly dry and somehow . . . furry . . . or something. He feels
It’d been easier to avoid Tony and thinking about Tony keeping Project Insight from him, to avoid thinking about what it meant for them, than to actually talk to him about it. And then, once Steve found out about Bucky, he really had been too caught up in finding him to think about Tony. Tony probably would’ve even understood. If Steve had made an effort to explain it to him.
He wants to wince at his own words, realizes they sound like he’s lying, like he’s crazy actually, even though he really does need to go home. As soon as possible. He keeps hearing a phantom Dr. Stark tell him
“I’m sorry for interrupting you,” he blurted out, belatedly realizing that Tony could interpret his actions differently than he’d meant them. There was a pinched look around Tony’s eyes that Steve didn’t know if he should attribute to the past few days or to his most recent actions, but either way, he hated the fact that it was there. “I wanted to hear what you—I
Like me, Steve thinks and watches his character die on screen again for the third time without killing anyone. His K/D ratio is going all to hell.
“But why not?”  And he’s not whining.  Yet.  He's still got a few tricks up his sleeve before he has to resort to the whining.
Sometimes, Bucky had been a huge asshole, he thought, his heart aching for all the things they’d never share again.
Luckily, that part is over with quickly, and Steve doesn’t react to anything Dr. Stark does until he puts the flashlight away and lightly places his hands back on Steve’s neck. As soon as they reach his glands, Steve hisses and instinctively jerks back.
“Yes, sorry!” Steve said, scrambling up, and it was one more lash to Tony’s heart when he caught the glimpse of disappointment and hurt on Steve’s face before Steve hid them away. He had to scrape for the dregs of his control to keep from reacting to them. “I’m sorry, I should’ve—”
So it’d be up to him to whether or not he got fucked. It’d be his fault. Steve thought back on holding the ottoman over his head. He didn’t know how long it’d taken his muscles to fatigue, but eventually even the Serum hadn’t been able to save him, and he knew that it’d happen again. He closed his eyes for a moment.
“I love you,” he said as Tony’s lips parted in a silent moan, brow crinkling in pleasure. “So much, Tony, love you,” and he said it again and again as they moved, couldn’t say it enough, would never be able to. He wanted to tell him even more, that he was so sorry for hurting Tony, for letting the distance between them stretch out so long, for not being strong enough to keep the gauntlet from Thanos so that Tony—
The word “table” comes out a little strangled, but at least Steve manages to say it. He still can’t force himself to stop kissing Tony as he reaches for a drawer (or let go of his buckle, but that’s neither here nor there), but he makes do with Tony’s neck, his shoulder, his chest—Steve lets out another gush of slick as the feel of how defined Tony’s chest is, and he can’t decide whether it’s better or worse that Tony’s still wearing his shirt.
Steve didn’t bother looking up from gathering firewood.  It was not, sadly enough, the most outrageous thing Tony had ever said to him.
“What … what happened?” Steve breathed, almost too softly to hear, and Tony wished it’d been quieter still so he could deny it for that much longer.
Stark had already told him that he expected Steve to not embarrass him in public. Rule number two. Would this count?
,” Tony breathed, and Steve closed his eyes peacefully and kept going, curling around Tony’s fingers, tracing the lines along his palm, curving around the jut of Tony’s bones until the only thing left was the mild taste of Tony’s skin on his tongue, and only then did he reluctantly pull away.
“Have you found your other controller, Steve?” Tony asks, and he’s valiantly been trying to pick up Steve’s slack, but the game has respawned Steve in two different places, and Steve keeps dying before Tony can get there.
He didn’t think he’d ever been with someone who enjoyed being rimmed as much as Steve did, and it spurred Tony on to new heights as he fucked Steve on his tongue, as Steve started grinding against his face to get him even deeper.
Steve clutches the blanket to his face, taking a deep breath of Dr. Stark’s scent. As Dr. Stark’s fingers try to wear down his resistance, he can’t help but think that he wouldn’t care if Dr. Stark knotted him on the first thrust as long as he promised to keep fucking him afterwards, that Steve would be happy just to be a warm place for Dr. Stark’s knot until he was ready to go again—
“You know damn well why, back off!” Steve said, knocking Tony’s hand off of his shoulder. Tony had never been one for casual contact. Steve wasn’t going to accept it now, especially not in some sort of gesture of camaraderie that didn’t exist.
“Huh,” Tony said. “Really? Every day?” Then he shrugged. “Maybe you just need to be milked. We can experiment with that if you’d like, but it’s fine if you don’t want to. There are tons of other things we can do instead that I think you’d appreciate and that I’d enjoy just as much.”
A lot of responses popped into his head, from “I told you, things are different now” to “You damn well better believe it” to even “I’d have to give a fuck about what you do in order to tell you to stop” but he didn’t say any of them.
Other people might have felt weird about having an ex in the bathroom with them, but he could barely remember a time when Pepper hadn’t been in his life, and even if the romantic feelings between them had faded, it still felt completely natural for her to be there.
needed, the only way they could work through the snarl of hurt between them. Tony might’ve convinced himself he wasn’t angry with Steve anymore, but that was because Tony had been exhausted and in physical pain and off-balance from Steve’s confession. The anger wasn’t really gone, just buried under everything else.
“I’m not as good as you make me out to be.” It was the second time that Steve had said Tony was a better man than he actually was. He wanted to claim that Steve was right, that he was that selfless, that he could forgive and forget that easily. But he wasn’t. He wasn’t ready to just move past everything that had happened, and he knew from experience that the emotional scars never went away.
Tony had said, and it had been the first time he’d ever said anything like that. Even now, Steve could feel himself blush at the sincerity in Tony’s voice—although it could also be blamed on his response.
He’s gotten used to this body, being able to run without breaking a sweat, ducking whenever he walks under a low doorway, holding onto cups and pens and what-have-you with a soft and careful grip, it’s all second nature to him now.
Is this the life they’re going to have together? Only able to live on the boundary of their two worlds?
“Did you go to all this effort with your appearance for me?” Tony asked, flicking at one of Steve’s buttons.
to do it—because it was the right thing to do, because even if he and Stark didn’t get along always, taking care of Steve still
Stark moved around the coffee table until he was next to Steve. “Let your hair down a little, Steve! Let me show you around New York.”
“So what made you decide to become a doctor, Tony?” Steve asks, throwing the question out there in desperation to move the attention away from him, and it’s not until it’s out of his mouth that he really thinks about what he’s just done. Asking about someone’s professions wouldn’t normally be a bad thing. Except for the fact that Steve gets off on Tony’s job, and talking about it probably isn’t the best idea he’s ever had considering he’s trying to not think about anything too exciting.
, he doesn’t know why it sounds so reasonable, but it does, and there’s no expectation of questioning or defiance, just simple obedience, and that’s what he does, he obeys, not even thinking about it until he’s in the middle of doing whatever it is Tony wants him to do.
There was no hiding the tremor in his hands anymore, and he found himself having to drag his gaze back to Tony’s, again and again.
“I love you, Tony,” Steve rasped, his voice cracking, and he might have said more, but it was lost in the roar that filled Tony’s ears.
“I know, I should have,” Steve said, reaching out to Tony, wanting him to understand. “I was going to, Tony, but then Nick was—”
“So you’re going to feel my hand on your thigh,” Dr. Stark tells him, putting his words to action, and ohhh, Steve hopes he mistakes the way he twitches for nervousness, “and I’m going to move towards the juncture of your legs and insert one finger inside of you, all right, Steve?”
have fallen in love with Tony. He’d always demanded Steve’s attention whenever they’d been in a room together and even when they hadn’t, Steve’s thoughts following after him long after he was gone. Truthfully, Steve had had to put an artificial distance between the two of them more than once when he’d realized just how much he looked forward to seeing Tony.
“Mmph!” Steve is going to suffocate himself at this rate, bunching the blanket over his mouth to minimize the noises as much as possible.
Steve’s face burned, and he wanted to say that Tony had told him not to, that he would have if Tony had let him … but he couldn’t blame Tony for his disbelief, not really, not after the past few days. Although he couldn’t help but selfishly wish that Tony would take into account his previous actions, all the things he’d done in the past—
. He knew it was unfair, however. They wouldn’t even be in this situation if it weren’t for him, and he shouldn’t be upset that Tony was taking some time for himself. Steve should just be grateful that he’d gotten what he wanted in the end: Tony was letting him stay.
“Oh, Steve,” Tony said, smiling as he slid two fingers into him effortlessly.  “You can take whatever I can dish out and more.”
He zoomed in on Steve’s face, not even meaning to, the move automatic as his phone tracked his eye movements and enlarged anything he focused on for more than a few seconds. It was a long time before he could look away.
He hadn’t wanted to come live with Stark, it was true. He hadn’t wanted to, and he hated the necessity and the reason behind it; but he could admit to himself if to no one else that he didn’t want to be sent back either.
His breath hitched audibly when Tony soaped his neck, and Tony’s mouth quirked, but he didn’t say anything. He rubbed Steve’s shoulders, sure and firm, even with all the slipperiness, and Steve made a sound when Tony found a particularly tight spot, blushing right afterward. It seemed . . . decadent . . . to sit there and let Tony take care of him, and he didn’t know what to do with himself.
said my safeword before,” Tony said after a short silence, and it felt like every muscle in Steve’s body went rigid. “Woah, calm down, Tiger. It wasn’t anything bad. I thought I’d like something that I really, really didn’t. The Dom I was with stopped immediately and nearly fell over himself, apologizing, even though it’d been my idea, and that was that.”
By all rights, Tony should be bored out of his mind, but it’s actually kind of nice holding the Angel now that they’ve got a rhythm going. He’s really warm, which is soothing, and from what little Tony can see of his face, Tony’s beginning to suspect he might also be kind of beautiful. Tony hadn’t noticed before, what with trying to figure out logistics and the fact that the Angel’s hair had been plastered to his skin, hiding a lot of his features. It’s somewhat dry now, though, enough to mostly slide off his face, and Tony finds himself looking behind him less and less frequently in favor of trying to get a better look at him.
Tony’s lips quirked. “Honor. So about last night,” Tony said, his hands starting a slow stroke down Steve’s back.
“You don’t need to thank me. I told you there’d always be a place for you here,” he said, remembering he’d told Steve that right before he’d gotten on his motorcycle and driven away. “G’night.”
He hadn’t fallen in love with her then, but it’d been a short ride down from there, each encounter solidifying the image in his head of the two of them after the war, him on his knees beside her, her collar around his neck.
He’d never enjoyed it quite like this, however, the weight of Tony’s gaze like hands roaming over his body, the knowledge that there was almost nothing Tony could ask him in this moment that he would say no to making him feel almost helpless to his and Tony’s desire.
It had been a stupid idea anyway, a way for him to avoid having to make himself too vulnerable. Dr. Saunders had helped him realize that he always kept people at a distance, protecting himself and minimizing any potential to get hurt. He’d nearly done that again with Tony, habit and fear dictating his actions, and he’d only barely managed to stop himself, choosing instead to be frighteningly honest.
The lab was in ruins. There were papers scattered everywhere and machinery lying on its side, smeared outlines of dust to mark where things used to be, and in the corner sat DUM-E, not moving.
Steve closed his eyes, resting his head on his forearm and then trying to keep as still as possible.  He gave a sigh of relief as Tony worked the plug into him, grateful for the extra security.
Dom,” he said, stung by the suggestion that he was failing, especially from her, because out of anyone, she would know the best—
He glanced at Natasha, wondering if she’d told Clint about him and Tony, but from the way she raised her eyebrows ever so slightly, he guessed she was giving him the option of telling Clint or not. He cleared his throat. It wasn’t the first time he’d told someone by any means—Dr. Saunders, Nick, Natasha, even Peggy—but it still made his heart speed up a little whenever he announced it, the fact that he and Tony were finally together. “Well, Tony’s here.”
JARVIS directs him to the nearest florist, and luckily, it’s next to a restaurant with an actual parking lot. Convenient, and besides, he’s only going to be a couple of minutes; no one’s going to notice.
It was that cheekiness that had gotten Tony to ask for him again.  And then one thing had led to another, and suddenly they’re spending nearly every day in each other’s company, and they’re fucking over every conceivable surface, and Tony has to remind himself that they’re not dating, he’s paying for this, and Steve’s smiles aren’t meant just for him.
Something … good? But then why—? Steve had to struggle against the urge to open his eyes. He didn’t know why Tony had told him to close them, but he desperately wanted to know what expression Tony was wearing at that moment.
do something. So he reached out with one hand, slowly and obviously, and he laid it on top of Steve’s—and then breathed a sigh of relief when Steve turned his own over so they were holding onto each other.
He doesn’t know why he’s like this. His omega friends all roll their eyes when they talk about their checkups and complain how uncomfortable they are, or how cold the doctor’s hands are, or how invasive the whole thing is, but Steve …
“I expect you to follow me around from room to room. I’ve already had pillows put in the areas I’m going to be in, so you can lay on them when you’re tired or when I can’t play with you. You can choose to not use them, if you prefer, but they’re there if you want. There are also bowls for water and food in the kitchen. You don’t need my permission to get a drink if you’re thirsty, but if you’re hungry aside from meals, you’ll have to beg for treats.”
. Steve hadn’t realized how much he needed Tony on top of him until he gave it to him, and his own arms ached with the urge to be able to hold Tony in return.
“How quickly they forget!” the guy says, placing the back on his hand on his forehead.  “No worries, though.  You had enough alcohol to knock out an elephant.  Tony Stark at your service, oh-husband-of-mine.”
“Smile, Steve,” he says pointing the camcorder at him as he walks out of the bathroom, still wet from a shower because he’d decided to sneak some twenty-five mile run or something awful like that while Tony’d been busy.
“I won’t,” Steve promised, clutching Tony a little closer. “I’ve got you, Tony.  We’ll get out of here together.”
It’s not even thirty minutes later that he’s dragging Steve into the bedroom. No time like the present after all, especially since Steve’s leaving in about eighteen hours.  And besides, the lighting’s good right now.
Except Tony actually hadn’t. Tony had said “Subs,” plural, like Steve was one of many, replaceable and easily forgotten, and while he knew it wasn’t true, knew Tony had only been with one other person as long as he’d been with Steve, it didn’t make him feel any better. If anything, it made him feel worse.
Tony had been trying to earn his trust from the very beginning, and Steve hadn’t even bothered to notice.
He dreamt of Tony again that night, but this time, Tony didn’t touch him, and no matter how he tried, he couldn’t touch Tony either, could barely move at all. It was an odd dream, and Steve would’ve thought the inability to reach out would’ve been frustrating, but when he woke up, it was to a sense of safety of all things. Like nothing could hurt him. He lay in bed for a long time, unwilling to let go of that feeling of security, and when he closed his eyes, he saw Tony’s face.
It made him wonder what it’d feel like when Tony went all the way. He’d only ever had anal sex the once—well, a few times with one person—and it’d been nice. Good.
But only in a fantasy sort of way. He knows he’d be disappointed if that were the type of alpha Tony actually turned out to be.
Things weren’t the same between them. Steve knew that he shouldn’t expect them to be, and he didn’t miss the tension that had always lurked in their interactions before, but . . .
“You can put it down now,” Tony said, and Steve let out a sob as he set the ottoman down as gently as he could manage, nearly falling to his knees in the process.
“Do you?” He ran a hand through his hair. “Look, if it’s for you, then we can talk about it. If you seriously think I should hurt you somehow because you-you hurt me and that not punishing you will actually make it worse instead of better, then you can tell me that. But if it’s for me,” he said, his expression softening without permission, “if you think this will somehow make
“That’s perfectly understandable,” Dr. Stark says, roughly rolling his finger in an attempt to stretch Steve out, and it hurts. It hurts but he doesn’t care. He wouldn’t say he likes it but …
gets Tony’s belt and then pants undone, and just as he’s starting to shove them down, Tony runs a hand down his thigh. Steve can’t help the way he instinctively spreads his legs open that much more and squeezes whatever he’s holding, which is Tony’s pants in this case, and then Tony’s slipping a finger inside.
in front of him, no matter that it clearly wasn’t a formal bonding collar, made his heart clench so painfully that each successive heartbeat swept the ache further and further along his body.
“Well, that and my good looks,” Tony teased, which was unfair since Tony had a streak of gray in his hair that did things to Steve’s stomach he could never have anticipated. “But it was a whole system of twins basically. Everyone is born with a twin, and they can only have offspring after a four-way sexual fertilization. Murdering half the population would’ve eventually resulted in complete genocide if Bruce hadn’t brought them back, but since I was the one to finally get rid of Thanos …” He shrugged.
It’s just a game. Steve knows there’s nothing really special about it except maybe slightly better graphics than the current standard. It’s just one first-person shooter out of hundreds, but he’s addicted. He hasn’t gone so far as to set his alarm early in order to get some time in before work–not yet anyway–but he thinks about it during random moments in the day, and he always races home and wolfs down dinner in order to get on as soon as possible.
Okay. So getting closer to Steve was obviously a mistake. A stupid mistake. An incredibly stupid, terrible mistake. What he needs to do right now is turn around, march right into the elevator, and then lock himself in his lab until this thing is over.
“I would think that would be obvious.  Your father was instrumental in creating him after all,” Fury said, watching him, although if he was expecting Tony to give something away, then he was going to be disappointed.  Tony had plenty of practice not reacting when anyone mentioned his dad.
Or he tried to at least, although the way a furrow appeared on Tony’s brow indicated he hadn’t succeeded.
When he’d moved, it’d seemed reasonable to only bring clothes and those few items that he actually cared about since Tony’s place was already furnished and decorated. Tony had told him to bring more, but there hadn’t seemed to be much of a point. They were just
of him … it was as if Steve’s body was demanding he make up for all the days without, for the days when the only relief had come from his own hand.
Maybe Tony didn’t love him yet, and Steve had to close his eyes for a second at the thoughts that followed, that Tony never would, that Steve had already ruined everything beyond salvation.
“Come here,” Tony said when he saw Steve the next morning. He hadn’t gotten much sleep, thoughts going too fast to ever properly settle, but he felt better than he had in a while. Things between him and Steve weren’t ever going to be what he wanted them to be, but they could still be good. After all the shit that had gone on and all the mistakes, they were finally on the same page, and yeah, Steve was going to leave again—in a few weeks, a few months, soon, whenever it was. In the meantime, however, Tony was going to do his best by him, and he was determined to leave his mark on Steve, just like Steve had left one on him.
He can’t really blame them for freezing, though. Kissing his Angel is like nothing he’s ever experienced before. He almost feels jealous of his tentacles getting to taste him first, but they haven’t had a chance to experience his mouth yet, so if anything, they should be jealous of him.
He’d gone from living in an orphanage to living in a boarding house to living in the barracks, and comfort had never been the highest priority in any of those places. He’d slept on twin beds with thin mattresses and had counted himself lucky if he’d had a blanket thick enough to keep out most of the chill; had waited for his turn to use the bathroom and kept track of the passing minutes as he stood under the lukewarm or cool water; had  eaten food that had the consistency of mush or jerky during some of the harder times of his life and been grateful for it; and that had been fine, that had been expected, but here . . .
get a full night’s sleep?” he asked and dodged the hand that had been reaching for his forehead. “I’m not sick,
that Tony was giving him the chance to make it up to him. He’d wait for hours if he had to, if it meant Tony would be happy with him.
“But I—” Steve slammed his mouth shut and bit back the protest that tried to escape. Looking back, he realized Tony had never implied his punishment was going to be physical in nature, but Steve had just assumed. He’d wanted it after seeing Tony’s back and knowing Tony had gotten hurt because of him. He’d imagined what it’d be like, Tony tying him down or ordering him to stay still to further prove his remorse, taking all his frustration and anger out on Steve’s body, not once but multiple times, the pain managing to lance Steve’s guilt for all the hurt he’d caused Tony.
“And I’ve been thinking about what I did wrong. All of it. All the things I’d take back if I could, all the things I’d do better if I could just get one more chance,” Steve said his voice breaking, and Tony didn’t have the strength to stop the tears that welled up at the hopelessness in Steve’s words.
Okay. He could … he could handle this. He hadn’t planned on Steve finding out, but he could … he could …
Of course that meant that Tony let out a huff and started straightening his hind legs, and Steve yelped, toes sliding against the floor as he rushed to shift his weight from his knees to his feet, Tony’s knot forcing him to lift his ass higher into the air.
They were corralled into the medical wing and separated into different examination rooms. Steve’s nurse was embarrassingly fervid in her thanks, as if he’d single-handedly saved the world, when in reality, he’d been one of the minor players. In the end, he managed to change the subject by asking her if he needed to change.
. He would swear that Dr. Edwards would’ve been done by now, but Dr. Stark rubs against him again and again and again, his fingers trying to get deeper and deeper, so much so that Steve has to push back in order to keep from moving away from the pressure.
“Tony?” Steve said, or thought he did. It was impossible to tell over the frantic pounding of his heart.
As if Tony leaving him weren’t going to break Steve more surely than anything else Tony could ever do.
“—ve you and I … believe me … acted like we … I do, Tony,” Steve said, eyes still cracked with red and wet streaks drying on his skin, and Tony desperately wanted to know what he was saying, but he couldn’t concentrate, couldn’t—
“No one’s forcing you to do this,” Nick said, and he seemed out of place standing in the middle of Tony’s living room, bright sunlight streaming in through the windows as he spoke of the potential annihilation of the entire human race. “But we could use your help.”
Tony’s eyebrows lifted slightly.  People had a tendency to mistype Tony.  He was on the short side of average, which didn’t mean anything since height had no bearing on being a Dom or a Sub, but Hollywood had messed people up enough that they assumed under six foot tall meant Sub.  Also, he was sarcastic, but in a cheeky way rather than a domineering way, so once again, Sub.  (If he had a dollar for every time a Dom had said they’d planned to beat the disrespect out of him, he’d be a . . . well, let’s just say he’d be even richer than he already was.)  And he was talkative.  And loud.  And he smiled a lot.  And was kind of handsy without even realizing it.  And he pouted when he didn’t get his way.  And he liked to wear stylish clothes when he was out.  And got his hair and nails done and went in for massages.  And maybe if it’d been just one or two things, it would’ve been fine, but when added up all together?
Steve’s rudeness whenever it reared up. Stark was . . . he was persistent. Determined. And it appeared that he had set his sights on taking care of Steve.
“As in intercourse, Barton,” Dr. Strange said, and Steve couldn’t see him roll his eyes, but he could hear it in his voice. He understood that he’d been an incredibly brilliant neurosurgeon before becoming Sorcerer Supreme, but once again, Tony had been turned into a huge wolf. Questions were going to happen.
It made him angry that Tony didn’t take care of himself better, that he only had JARVIS around to watch over him when JARVIS enabled his bad habits. It made him angrier that Tony had hidden this from him, even though he knew he was being unfair, because Tony had probably restrained himself for Steve’s sake, so he wouldn’t be left alone. But what made him angriest of all was that the Steve from before wouldn’t have even cared if Tony had locked himself away for hours on end, would’ve preferred it in fact. If Tony
Because it sounds to him like Tony’s building a … well, a fucking machine, and he tries to wrap his mind around the concept.
When Steve woke up, it was to see Tony looking at a tablet as he lay on his side, facing Steve. It was so normal that Steve let himself just watch for a few seconds, not thinking, not remembering anything, just appreciating the fact that he was there, next to Tony. That he was still allowed this. For however much longer.
-kay.  This wasn’t really what Tony had signed on for.  It was one thing to talk about taking on a new Sub—which wasn’t he’d signed on for either.  Fury had just requested a meeting about one of his dad’s old projects, and he’d stupidly agreed—another thing entirely to watch someone being taken apart right in front of him, and maybe he should go—
It wasn’t a conscious decision, but he found himself breathing hard and squirming in order to get out of the way of whatever it was that was
He’d thought he’d gotten to the point where he didn’t automatically assume the worst about Stark, but he’d been wrong.
“Come here,” Tony said, his voice low and gravelly, and he held his hand out to Steve, spreading his legs.
Steve could feel his eyebrows do something strange, but he honestly had no idea how to respond to that, so he answered Tony’s question intead. “I, um, got back a few hours ago.”
?” he said, nearly shouting, and apparently he’d gotten over the paranoia. “If you think for one second that I’m going to drag Steve into another ambush, then it’s time for you to retire as head of an army of spies, because you are batshit insane! Steve isn’t setting foot on SHIELD territory until I have a fucking guarantee that something like this won’t happen again! That
“You want more, Steve?” Tony asked, pushing in a bit further, careful to only go as far as Steve’s body seemed ready for—which wasn’t very far actually; Steve was tight, and the soap had washed off long ago.
Tony's eyes gleam for a moment like he knows exactly what Steve's thinking, but then he's back to business.  "Just sometimes, huh?  Didn't the army teach you to be a good little soldier?"
Tony was feeling better now, though, and he knew that Steve loved him, that Steve was sorry for all of it and would welcome anything Tony chose to do to him. It’d be different from the last time, when Steve had been afraid Tony didn’t want him anymore and had panicked as a result. Once Tony got started, once he let loose and realized how good it felt to make Steve regret hurting him and how grateful Steve was for him doing it, he’d punish Steve for real. And afterwards, when Tony saw how much Steve had suffered for him, how much Tony meant to him, then he’d
Now, however, he couldn’t manage even that much, couldn’t think about anything other than Tony, on what had happened yesterday and the days before it, on what Tony had been doing last night without him. He was ashamed of himself for being wrapped up in his own problems when Bucky was out there, alone. If Steve were better, he’d have found Bucky before Hydra did, or somehow realized that he was still alive, or done more to make him recognize him. But he hadn’t. He’d failed. Just like he’d failed Tony.
It's my birthday (again--I can't believe I've had six birthdays over the course of this fic wtf) in a few days, and I thought, what better way to celebrate than to post a chapter! Yay chapter! Feel free to give me all the kudos and comments as a present! *hopeful eyes*
“I know you are.” Steve didn’t know how Tony managed it, but he gave Steve a small smile that looked completely genuine. “And you’re going to make it up to me, aren’t you?” he said, and Steve inhaled sharply, his heartbeat quickening.
And at his feet were the bags Steve had brought when he moved into the penthouse, everything already packed, neatly and precisely.
“I’ve thought it over, Steve, and after the way you were acting in the coffee shop, I really think I’d feel better if I examined you after all.” A flicker of uncertainty passes over his face. “If that’s—if that’s alright with you?”
Which was why he groaned when Tony said, “Unbutton your pants,” and it took him three tries before he could get it right.
“Can you look at me?” Tony asked in a raspy voice, and Steve wanted to say no. Please. Don’t make me.
“Shhh,” he whispered, stroking blond hair away from his face, leaving behind streaks of vivid, gleaming red.  He’d put up such a fight, even though Tony had taken him completely by surprise.  And while Tony had won in the end, it had been more luck than skill, the fallen leaves and recent rain making everything slippery.  As it was, he was going to have to get medical treatment for the cut on his chest, and something told him he’d carry the scar for the rest of his life.
man, and he had no desire to be controlled by biology, to lose any and all coherent thought and be a slave to unpredictable heats where the most—the
"And before you say anything, yes, I have pictures and other videos of you, but it’s not the same, not even close.  I realize that this is a purely selfish thing that I’m asking, but I don't care.  Do you know how much I’m going to miss you?  So much, Steve,” he says, his grip tightening, and Steve holds his hand back just as firmly.  “I understand why you have to go, why it has to be you and not someone else, and I won’t argue with you about it—
Steve saw how he started to raise his arm as if to lay it across Steve’s shoulders but checked himself mid-motion, using the momentum to gesture out the floor-to-ceiling windows instead. While Stark touched him all the time—hitting or defending or trying to get him in some sort of hold—it would’ve been only the second time Stark had ever tried to touch him in friendship, the third if he counted when they first met. Steve didn’t know which surprised him the most: that he’d been keeping track, that Stark respected his boundaries, or that he almost wished Stark had gone through with it after all.
“Sleep is for wimps,” Tony said, handing Steve a blueberry muffin and a cup of chai tea and simultaneously avoiding the question.
“But anyway, we were in the middle of getting clean. Up on your feet now and face the wall. I want to wash your back.”
“If you really think that’s necessary, then go ahead,” Steve says, his stomach rolling nervously, and he grips the table even harder.
He hated the idea that he was always being observed, but if he were honest with himself, it was barely different than the way the Army or SHIELD had treated him after the Super Serum and then being virtually resurrected. There had always been people around, watching and assessing, and if Stark wanted to look at him in his bedroom, well, Steve remembered giving him permission to do so in their contract. He’d agreed to voyeurism and exhibitionism and a long list of things he didn’t know the definitions of, and it hadn’t mattered when he’d been standing there, numb and feeling betrayed. Steve told himself that it still didn’t.
Not to say it couldn’t be better, because Tony apparently hadn’t been expecting that, so the kiss is messy and all over the place and they only manage to avoid knocking heads through a combination of luck and Tony’s quick reflexes.
The doctor drew himself up. “Unless it’s escaped your attention, Mr. Stark, Captain Rogers is still a member of the United States’ armed forces, an obligation which supersedes your contract. I can have you brought up on charges of interfering with—”
“I thought of a safeword,” Steve said, feeling like an idiot for bringing it up out of the blue, but Tony had asked that he choose one, and for once, he didn’t want to wait before doing something Tony requested.
,” he said at last, wishing he’d never opened his damn mouth, but refusing to keep quiet because he wouldn’t hurt Steve again, not if he could help it. “It’s about doing what’s right.”
It was hard to not think about it, though, the weight of Tony on his tongue, the way Tony had sighed as he’d carded his fingers through Steve’s hair, the sight of Tony as he lay on the bed afterwards, sleepy and content.
“I’ll just do a quick visual inspection and then perform a physical examination for any internal bleeding. If you don’t mind lying back and scooting down to the edge of the table . . .” Dr. Reynolds pulled out stirrups from the corners of the table and frowned at Steve when he remained sitting in place.
Steve remembered the way Tony had used to look at him, the warmth in his brown eyes that Steve had taken for granted, and it seemed like the simplest thing in the world to pick up the vibrator.
“But I have extremely high clearance,” Tony said, letting his jacket fall to the ground to join the tie.  “How else could I have gotten to your room?”
Swimming like this gets monotonous after a while. Since he’s above water, it’s just sun, sun, sun, and the Angel is still unconscious, so there’s nothing to do but watch him or the horizon and occasionally turn his head to check that they’re not going to bump into any debris. He’s made this trip a few times, admittedly underwater, but he can feel where he is in relation to the land, so there’s no danger of getting lost.
“How long are you going to be gone?” Tony asked in the garage as Steve loaded his pack and shield on his motorcycle.
Steve gets ready to say … something … who knows what, but then he makes the mistake of raising his head to look at Dr. Stark—only to realize Dr. Stark is looking at
Well, obviously that was what Tony wanted him to wear, since Tony had packed the bag and was showing it to him.
“I don’t even know why I called you,” he said, putting the screwdriver down and picking up a torque wrench in its place.
He looked over at the helicopter, but it was far away, and the pilot’s attention wasn’t on them. It didn’t stop him from feeling more than a little exposed. He took a fortifying breath.
Still, he’s alive, and Tony discards the half-formed idea he had of taking him to Bruce’s lab and dissecting him. He can always revisit it if the Angel doesn’t get better, maybe save some of the more choice bits for eating. He wonders how Angels taste. He’d discovered that humans are just meh after a shipwreck once, but he hasn’t let his tentacles touch the body in front of him to get much of a sense of flavor.
Thankfully, Happy chose that moment to lower the privacy window, because who knew what Steve would’ve said to that.
As if it Stark saying the word meant it were actually true.  As if Steve could forget closing his eyes right before he died and then opening them to a sense of
“I finally decided that even if you did agree with Nick, we could figure it out. Together. But then I—I kept wondering if you’d been hiding it from me, if you’d known and just not told me. That was what stopped me the most, because I couldn’t be with someone who’d do that, but I wanted—I
“But the machine was mostly supposed to be a reward for how well you’ve been doing. For how good you’ve been trying to be for me,” Tony said, his fingers coming down to curl just under Steve’s chin, cradling his jaw. If Tony had exerted pressure for him to lift his head, he would’ve done it … but Steve was unbearably grateful that Tony didn’t as he struggled to hide the pain and the relief that flooded him at his words.
Someone knocked on his front door, and he shook his head to clear the image, banishing his odd thoughts.
He could sense Tony’s gaze on him, and it took a tremendous amount of strength to lift his chin, needing to convey his determination to stay where he was. He didn’t want to go against Tony’s wishes, felt like a million butterflies were battering against his stomach at the knowledge that he was defying him, but he couldn’t let Tony walk away without even trying to stop him.
“What?” he tries to say, so, so confused, and he doesn’t understand how he’s gone from being so happy and in love to feeling stupid and devastated in such a short amount of time.
He anticipated a variety of reactions, from Tony watching him calmly, to bursting out laughing, to even making a joke at his expense (the last was unlikely, but he felt he should be prepared). What he hadn’t expected, however, was the …
They’d had lunch, and then Stark had given him a tour of the floor and gently bullied him into choosing a bedroom by verbally redecorating every room they walked into in order to suit Steve’s supposed tastes—including, but not limited to, tearing down walls and adding target dummies in case Steve wanted to practice throwing his shield around.
Tony’s back was rigid. He didn’t turn around, and Steve was all too conscious of the seconds ticking away, of how little time he had left.
Steve had done that. To him, to them. He’d ruined all of it, and he couldn’t help but wonder if any amount of suffering on his part would ever be enough to fix it.
That being said, I really dreaded writing this chapter. I didn't start it until a few days ago, and luckily, the muse was still cooperating, but for a while there, I was afraid this was going to be the beginning of another hiatus. >_>
“You,” Steve said quietly, and Tony gaped at him before shaking his head in disbelief. He walked by him, shouldering him aside in order to get to the elevator. He didn’t look back.
for my birthday. Please go give it love. She's so freaking talented, and she inspired me to write another chapter.
Oh look, I found another one! And from last year at exactly around this time. Might as well slap it up here...
“I’m sorry,” Stark said at last, his voice much softer than it’d been seconds before. He didn’t turn around. “I should’ve been paying more attention.”
Listening to the jangle of Tony’s belt and the crinkle of the condom wrapper is another form of torture, and Steve doesn’t mean to bite at Tony’s mouth, but he can’t stop, aching with want. Tony positions the head of his cock against him, and as Steve feels the large, blunt pressure, he has a fraction of a second to realize maybe Tony stretching him might have been a good idea after all, and then Tony starts pushing in.
ETA: I have never been in a bdsm relationship, and obviously there is a power imbalance here because of the set up of this fic, so please take everything I write with a grain of salt. This is not meant to portray real life.
It wouldn’t solve everything. It might not solve … anything actually, because Tony knew that loving someone didn’t guarantee that it’d all work out, knew that guilt could eat away at the best of intentions and that they’d hurt each other to the point that other people might have decided to cut their losses and walk away. That wasn’t an option for Tony, though. Steve wasn’t someone he could just
“My afternoon is free tomorrow, if you don’t mind waiting,” Tony said right before he walked out the kitchen door, his plate held high and close to his chest.
Welp. I wasn't actually planning to add another chapter because this didn't get very many kudos, but Eggums wrote such a nice comment that I got inspired. I hope you enjoy this small chapter, Eggums!
him want you! What, you’ve lost your ability to charm people now?” she asked at his expression, her words laced with challenge. “You’re so used to everyone coming to you that you can’t seduce someone anymore? I’ve seen how much effort you put into one-night stands, Tony, and you don’t even
(“Cock” is such a strange word, especially considering it can also refer to roosters and to something done poorly and to who knows what else, but the Human military men swear by it, insisting “penis” is only for polite company, and who’s Tony to argue?)
waiting on Steve to prove himself, he couldn’t blame him. He was right to. Steve didn’t deserve his trust.
Steve’s thighs are starting to ache with how tense he is and how wide he’s spread. He wants to blame the tremor of his muscles on that, but he suspects it has a lot more to do with the fact that he’s about to come than anything else. He doesn’t know how to prevent it without telling Dr. Stark, but there’s no way he can do that. Right now Dr. Stark thinks he has a condition that’s causing him to produce enough slick to drown a man, but if Steve comes, Dr. Stark is going to look back on everything they’ve done so far and realize Steve’s been getting off on his touches; that Steve’s been
It hadn’t dismissed the anger, but Stark’s rambling had given Steve time to contain it. At least until after his time on the computer was up, because he hadn’t wanted to lose his chance to learn about modern life by blowing up at Stark and having it rescinded, especially since Stark hadn’t
His legs almost gave out completely when Tony stroked all the way down the shaft of his cock and then back up, and he thought Tony’s grip might have been all that kept from upright as he cried out, embarrassingly loud as orgasm took him completely by surprise. He squeezed his eyes shut, his body turned traitor as it twitched and trembled without his permission, the pleasure bursting through him in waves.
“There haven’t been,” Steve interrupted, and if Tony had thought he’d been stiff before, it was nothing to the way he was holding himself then.
He’s feels grateful when Tony curses and comes, humiliatingly so, and it almost feels like another orgasm, he’s so filled with pride and pleasure, although nowhere as powerful as the first. He doesn’t … that’s never happened to him before, he’s never felt like that before, but the thought of Tony coming inside of him, of being
“Mr. Stark is frequently in the habit of spending multiple, consecutive days in the lab when inspiration strikes.”
Steve nodded. Of course Tony would have a solution. And it wasn’t as if Tony had to beat Steve himself, he rationalized, but his stomach clenched at the thought of Tony not personally wielding whatever instrument he planned on using on Steve. Tony had probably already created a machine to discipline unruly Subs, and as long as Tony didn’t leave him or refused to let Steve watch Tony watching him, then Steve wouldn’t complain.
He opened the book, wondering if he could tape it back in, and it was only then that he noticed that it wasn’t actually a page at all, the paper folded into fourths.  It looked like someone had wedged it into the crease and then forgotten about it.
; that’s not why I accepted!” he said, insulted that she’d think so little of him, even if he had been the one to imply that had been what happened.
He’s got a little handheld camcorder, nothing fancy, although the image quality is the best money can buy.  He could’ve gone more high-tech, gotten lights and cameras set up as well as sound equipment and all that and still had time to spare, but for this . . . for this, he likes the idea of having the camcorder in his hand, being able to direct it to wherever he wants and focus on each part of Steve as he touches him.  He likes that it won’t be perfectly polished (although technically he supposes they’ve done several rehearsals by now so that part of it should be five stars), that there’ll be moments when they’ll laugh and maybe he’ll accidentally record a few seconds of the sheets or something because Steve has always had the power to distract him.  Call him a romantic, but he wants more than just the sex.
yet, and at this rate, Dr. Stark is going to have to open all the doors and windows of the entire office in order to air it out and not offend all the patients who have appointments the next day.
Steve hadn’t realized how much he missed training with someone else. Which was odd when he thought about it, because he didn’t actually have that much practice doing it.
“We terminated it on the grounds that you didn’t give proper consent and therefore couldn’t be bound by the terms of the contract.” He decided glasses were for pussies. Who needed glasses anyway? He took a long swig of scotch.
Needless to say, he was a little nervous. Tim was young enough that he was more excited than worried, and Damian … well, Dick might have to do a last-minute search for traps or something, because who knew what Damian’s expectations were about meeting Superman’s mom.
“Are you kidding me?”  Tony moved closer until he could whisper in Steve’s ear.  “That looks like it’d fall apart the first time you tried to fuck me over the back of it.  We need something . . . sturdier.”
sensitive. He stares up at Dr. Stark in shock and gets a surprised look in return before Dr. Stark starts to frown.
“Why do any of us have to do it?” Clint burst out and held up a hand when they both stared at him. “I just mean that there are people who would love an opportunity like this. I can get on the phone, and I bet with a few calls, we can find someone—”
whenever Steve had needed him, and it was selfish of Steve to want Tony to still be in New York, but he’d begun to think of Tony’s apartment as home. It didn’t work, however, if Tony wasn’t there.
as he stared at Tony, “and Nick’s been after me to stop moping and come by for months now, so I thought I’d finally do it.  Look where it got me though.”
“Oh, Steve,” Tony says, laughing softly, his expression turning embarrassed. “I’ve been head over heels for as long as I’ve known you. How can I
Stark smiled when he didn’t respond, if a person could call it that, the corner of his mouth twisting up.
When he’d seen Loki for the first time, he’d thought their marriage would be the end of him.  Now that he knew him better, he wondered even more if it would be true.
Steve knew that Dr. Strange kept talking, but he couldn’t hear it over the static in his ears. He and Tony were together now, and Steve was quite happy with their love life, more than happy as a matter of fact. Tony was an inventive and attentive partner, and he threw himself into sex with the same passion he showed everything he loved.
And it wasn’t like it was common knowledge that he was back, otherwise Tony would’ve been getting all sorts of questions from the press, because yes, Tony was a Stark, but Steve Rogers had been Howard’s favored son.
He’d never felt anything like it before—had never responded to anyone else like that before—and he reached out blindly, clinging to Tony to help him through it.
Tony enjoyed sex in all its various forms and couldn’t say that he had a particular favorite, because there were advantages to handjobs, just like there were for blowjobs and frottage and penetration. But Steve wanted it
“What can he possibly be working on that requires this kind of effort?” Steve asked, because unless something sinister were coming towards New York—which he was sure he would’ve heard about—there was no justifiable reason for Tony to be working himself to the bone.
Steve hurried to the living room and back, then paused just inside the door, not knowing where Tony wanted the ottoman, wondering how long Tony would make him wait this time before telling him. He wasn’t even upset by the idea, was just …
Was it … was it wrong of him to like it? To wish he could see himself in a mirror? To want to see the proof of Tony’s claim written so boldly on his body? This was supposed to be a punishment after all.
“No, ma’am,” he said and didn’t complain at the desperate clutch of her fingers. “We didn’t forget.”
Steve was too close not to finish, too close to even make his way out of the bed, so he did it right there, curled on his side with his hand working frantically while he muffled his groans and pretended that he didn’t miss the bite of pain.
He tried to keep most of his weight off of Tony’s legs, but Tony just rolled his eyes, saying, “Will you sit down already?” as he slid his hands up Steve’s back in order to grab his shoulders, yanking him down.
Maybe he’d just been especially sensitive that day due to how effortlessly Steve had been tossing him around—not that Steve was the typical Sub either—or maybe it’d been because no matter how much he tried to ignore it, Steve was still Captain America, and that meant something to Tony. Whatever the reason, when he’d caught that flash of contempt in Steve’s eyes, he’d instantly gone on the defensive, and he’d been harsher than he would’ve liked.
“I don’t like repeating myself,” Stark said in a voice that dripped dominance, and Steve’s eyebrows came up in surprise. He’d known that Stark was a Dom, of course, had even seen flashes of it under the lackadaisical exterior, but there was knowing, and then there was
“Oh really?  What if I don’t want to go?” he asked out of curiosity, although he had no intention of really resisting.  He’d only gotten to see it for a few seconds when he walked into the room, but man, he would follow that ass anywhere.  “Are you planning to carry me out here?”
He was glorious.  Even now, he was still trying to push Tony away.  No matter how many people Tony killed, he knew that he was never going to forget him.
Tony wasn’t even naked. Although . . . there was something a little exciting about that fact, that Steve was just on display. That he could feel fabric and leather against every inch of his back and buttocks. That Tony had access to any part of him he wanted . . .
Bruce took a step forward, and it was all Clark could do to hold his ground. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see people looking at them, and he was sure there was a reason Bruce was doing this in the middle of a crowded ballroom where a fundraiser for the governor was being held, but for the life of him, he couldn’t think why.
It’s not like Steve wants Tony to go all “rawr, I am Alpha!” on him, fall into some sort of pheromone-induced haze, and be so overcome with lust that he tries to fuck Steve up against the door, Steve’s jeans tight around his thighs because they can’t be bothered to take off any clothes, the door shuddering with each and every thrust so all of his neighbors know exactly what they’re up to.
“Tony, that’s great news,” he said, and it was, the memory of Tony’s empty lab flashing before his eyes, but …
Truth be told, it was what Tony would’ve done if their situations had been reversed.  There was something extremely satisfying in testing to see how far a person could be pushed, not to mention the fact that even forcing a punishment was a type of control, which Steve had absolutely none of right now.
“I’ve heard that getting naked and cuddling in a sleeping bag together is a great way to stay warm.”
Sure, he realizes it’d be completely unprofessional for Dr. Stark to ask him out, but once again, Steve has literally
He wasn’t sure what to expect when he saw Tony: anger or disappointment, or even worse, more of that nothingness that had been so common in the past day.
“Start with your fingers,” Tony said, resting his elbows on his knees and leaning forward, hiding the lower part of his face behind his clasped hands.
Tony snarled, his tongue vibrating against Steve’s skin, and Steve cursed and smacked his hand against the ground loudly as he tried to control himself. It didn’t help that Tony rubbed against the tip of Steve’s cock again and again, like he was chasing the taste of Steve’s precome, and that thought had him shoving Tony’s head away in a panic before he made the whole argument pointless.
He hadn’t. The thought of his first time being with someone who had no interest in his submission as anything other than his due was abhorrent, even if he’d already given his consent. He was grateful Stark had kept his distance.
He settled in to wait, depending on the hum of the repulsors to announce Tony’s presence, but even though he should’ve been considering ways to beat Tony, it wasn’t thoughts of strategy that filled his mind.
“You are a fool,” Loki said, and Thor couldn’t help himself.  He reached out, cupping his precious face in his hand, marveling at the ability to do so freely and without harm.  He mourned the loss of blue, even though Loki had informed him it was not a permanent change.  Still, it felt almost a betrayal to find this pink-skinned version of him as appealing as he did.  “And I, doubly so, for your idiocy excuses you, but I previously had no such failing to blame for my feelings for you.  Perchance it is madness.  Or your brand of foolishness is contagious perhaps.”
come on, don’t look at me like that!  But I want . . .”  He takes a deep breath.  “I'm the only person who'll ever see it, who'll ever even know about it besides you.  I won’t ever mention it to anyone else, and it won’t ever,
to go. Not without at least trying to explain.” Tony had always been so careful to make sure Steve had what he needed, even when Steve hadn’t known he needed it himself. He had to believe that Tony would do it one more time. Just once more. “Please, Tony.”
And there were those damn puppy eyes again. “Tony,” he said, and Tony could tell he wasn’t going to let it go.
As if he were a skittish animal that needed calming, Steve thought dully. Or a feral one that would attack at the first opportunity.
Still, it wasn’t as if he hadn’t masturbated in front of Tony before. Of course, it’d always been a way to tease Steve, to make him want Tony all that much more. Steve had never actually come from it in front of Tony, or from ever using a sex toy. The only time he’d ever orgasmed without a hand on his cock had been with Tony. Five days ago. Before everything with Insight had happened.
he was there and headed upstairs. He should’ve phoned to tell Tony he was in town, or at least sent a text. Hell, he probably should’ve contacted Tony after the mission was over. With the time difference, it wouldn’t have even been that late, and he could’ve told him approximately what time he’d be in New York. He hadn’t given Tony any kind of ETA about when he’d get in, though, just said it’d be a three day mission, so he had no one but himself to blame that Tony was occupied.
The water isn’t cold anymore, but it’s still cool against his heated skin, and Steve would like to say that it makes his erection go down, but it really, really doesn’t.
The only way it could be better would be if Dr. Stark didn’t have any gloves on, if it were just bare skin instead of the unnatural smoothness of vinyl. It’s a funny thing to regret, considering Steve normally enjoys the gloves
a Dom, but if he had to have one temporarily, then it was good that it was someone who could take care of himself.
Steve settled against the back of the couch, letting his shoes rest on top of the pristine coffee table as he glanced from the floor-to-ceiling windows that showed a horizon he didn’t recognize, to the screen on the wall that was bigger than the bed he used to sleep in, to the fireplace and chandelier and all the decorations and little touches that reeked of wealth and excess.
It garnered a quick laugh out of Steve, although he didn’t say anything in response. He did, however, tilt his hips up so his buttocks came to rest perfectly in Tony’s palms, and that was—wow.
Steve set everything out on the coffee table carefully, doing his best to ignore the mess of guilt and nerves that made his hands want to tremble. It became exponentially harder when the first thing Tony did, before he sat down, before he moved around the table even, was offer him an opened bar of chocolate, and Steve realized that although Tony had gotten more than enough for the both of them, the
He’d gotten up that morning after a restless night and gone running on the treadmill—one of the most frustrating pieces of machinery he’d ever had the bad luck of encountering. All that running, just to go nowhere. It had seemed all too fitting for the state of his life. He’d swum afterward, back and forth, again and again, before finally taking a shower and heading toward the kitchen to wait for Stark to make an appearance.
Steve had the mental image of trying to get away from the fucking machine with the dildo still attached, of the dildo malfunctioning somehow because of it, and he flinched.
“Let’s find out how quickly you can come again,” he said, but even though he’d given himself permission, it wasn’t the same anymore.
“Okay,” Tony said, and Steve jumped slightly, glancing back, although the jeans were still mostly in the way, bunched up around his groin, impeded by the spread of Tony’s thighs.
That resolution lasts for a whole two seconds as Steve unsuccessfully tries to release the death-grip he has on Tony’s belt buckle until Tony murmurs, “Condoms?” against Steve’s lips, and Steve nearly cries in relief.
“Look at you,” Tony said, his hands once again reaching out to Steve’s stomach as if he couldn’t help himself, his touch tender and worshipful. “Fuck, you’re so beautiful like this, Steve.”
“There was another patient who used to urinate during an exam. One time could be excused, even twice, but three times in a row?” Dr. Stark doesn’t stop what he’s doing as he talks, and Steve doesn’t know how long Dr. Stark is going to keep trying, doesn’t know how long he’ll be able to stand it if he doesn’t give up soon.
“But this can’t exactly be comfortable for you,” Steve says, finally scrounging up the courage to look Dr. Stark in the face.
“You don’t have to apologize,” he says, plucking at the thin hospital blankets.  “You saved my life—”
Oh, he’s heard stories of the bird men from soldiers and dignitaries, even studied a few pictures, but he’s always been a little dubious. People that can fly? People that
Frequently, he’d be accompanied by Sam or Scott and Cassie, Clint had even brought his kids out a couple of times, and when Pepper and Morgan moved back into the city, it became even easier to make it routine.
, shocked and so, so loud when Tony spread him open, pressing his lips around Steve’s hole and licking with the flat of his tongue. Sure, he could’ve eased him into it a little more instead of diving in, so to speak, but Steve was already keyed up, and besides, where was the fun in that?
Rather than admitting the only gorgeous person or view he wanted was the one right in front of him, Steve said, “Tony, you know I don’t care about that sort of thing.”
“What’s your safeword?” he asked as he ran the stream of water over Steve, getting rid of whatever remaining soap there might be.
Steve was too concerned with things like decorum and respecting other people’s property—or bodies in this case—to engage in a little nookie while they were waiting to see if their situation was reversible.  Seriously, it was amazing that the two of them had ever gotten together.
“Good morning,” he says as he walks into the kitchen.  Bruce waves at him groggily, and Clint grunts from the table where he’s working on the crossword puzzle.  Tony doesn’t answer at all, but he’s huddled over something on the counter, working on who knows what, so Steve’s not surprised.
How wroth he’d been with Loki at the time, accusing him of cheating and muttering vile deprecations of his honor, but months after, when he’d thought back to the stripling of a boy that had defeated him, he’d found himself smiling.
“I know,” he said and sighed, long and drawn out, because he didn’t doubt that much at least, that Steve regretted the way things had gone down. Everything ached, the lines on his back throbbing harshly, and assuming Steve hadn’t moved much—and Tony knew without needing to confirm with JARVIS that he hadn’t—he had to be feeling just as bad, if not worse. “C’mon, let’s … let’s get off the floor and—”
. I got two pieces of fanart in the past couple of months, and I want them to get the appreciation they deserve. *puppy dog eyes*
“Just wait a little longer,” Tony said, pulling out and slapping Steve on the ass, once, twice, a third time just because he wanted to and because Steve sobbed so prettily and somehow always managed to spread his legs that much wider for it. “You’re so damn greedy,” he said, sounding too pleased by far, but perhaps he could be forgiven, considering how he felt for the first time in ages. “I love it,” he said and watched Steve melt into the bed.
“I like to approach each day with a smile on my face and a song in my heart,” he said lightly. “But who says I’m kidding? I’d give you this room if you wanted it.”
He knew she’d try to engage him soon on the chance that he’d either be more open to confiding in her than he’d been in previous sessions, or in the hopes that casual conversation would eventually lead to deeper revelations, and he resignedly waited for her to begin.
day, however, Tony was going to stick with what worked and just avoid the motherfuckers for as long as he could.
There’s a slight pause, like Steve’s debating with himself whether or not to actually do this, but then his shoulders loosen, and Tony captures the “whatever, fuck it” moment as Steve whips his towel off, bridging the distance between them with intent.
Steve supposes that every doctor must have a preference on how to arrange their patient during an exam, and if Dr. Edwards had put him in this position, Steve probably wouldn’t have given it another thought. It’s Dr. Stark putting him on display, though. Dr. Stark, who he now realizes has to already be getting a lungful of Steve’s desire with his legs the way they are, who might even be seeing evidence of how wet Steve has gotten if the sheet has ridden up enough.
,” Tony snapped, anger filling his voice at the way he was being treated, because maybe he wasn’t the knight in shining armor in this story, but he sure as hell wasn’t the villain either.
think … but of course, you would,” Tony said, his voice getting quieter. “After yesterday and after … I’m sorry,” he said, low and strained, somehow willing to take the blame onto himself, even though it was Steve’s fault. “I wanted to make up for … and I thought you’d want it, that you’d…”
Alpha pheromones could trigger a heat (and he totally didn't understand the evolutionary cause of that unless they were hoping suddenly going into heat would make an Alpha appear or something, but whatever, not his gig); too many Omegas in close quarters with each other could trigger a heat; the list went on and on.
His white shirt, which is absolutely plastered to his skin from the rain and aggressively showing his nipples.
Tony shivers at the thought and bites at Steve’s neck, his shoulder, focuses on that instead of how good Steve feels around him. He wishes he could use his hands more to touch and caress, but they’re too busy keeping Steve close and supporting him, so it’s up to his tentacles to do all the work.
What if Tony needed help taking care of his back? Or what if he fell? Steve had put bandages on him in order to prevent ointment from smearing all over his sheets and clothes, but there’d been a spattering of tiny scabs from where the person Tony had gone to had broken skin. Not many perhaps, but too much all the same.
I take you upstairs and said if I wasn’t going to do it, you’d find someone who would.  What could I do?  It was my duty as a good citizen to make sure you didn’t go off with some wackjob and get hurt.  You
Dr. Stark says it like he’s worried about Steve’s schedule and not that Steve is keeping him after-hours, even though it has to be frustrating for him. He probably thought he was going to be done by now, but here Steve is, dragging things out.
The sound of Tony’s footsteps makes him jump, and Steve almost drops the ring before putting it back on the cleaning cloth. He yells hoarsely, “Be back in a bit!” and leaves the room, the house, and then he runs for miles and miles and tries to come up with a good reason why Tony would have something that Steve now realizes looks an awful lot like a wedding ring.
. No matter how damaged his heart might be, his love for Steve had become entwined with every fiber, and it always would be.
Even the rules he had laid down hadn’t been unreasonable, even if Steve didn’t like them. He hadn’t demanded Steve walk three steps behind him, or be silent unless spoken to directly, or even to kneel at his feet in public, something Steve had seen plenty of Subs do in his day. He hadn’t even discussed punishment, and Steve didn’t know if that was because he honestly thought he wouldn’t disobey or because of some other reason, but it made Steve want to respect the trust given him and follow Stark’s rules; simultaneously, it also made him want to break each and every one of them, because who was Stark to assume that Steve would bow down to his law?
like it was. It had been his last chance to be good for Tony, to prove himself after … after all of it, and it seemed like Tony had set Steve up to fail. And even as he thought it, he knew it wasn’t true, but it didn’t make it hurt any less, didn’t close up the hole in his chest that kept getting bigger and bigger.
He’d never wanted to be the type of Sub that needed to be handled with kid gloves, but even with the Serum, he’d become one anyway.
was the one falling to his knees, reaching for Tony’s belt, fingers almost useless in his desperation.  Tony had to undo them for him, hands steadier, although it was all relative really, and then Steve was shoving Tony’s boxers down.  The sound he made when he got Tony’s cock into his mouth was filled with such utter satisfaction that Tony looked down and wondered if he’d come again, and fuck, if that wasn’t one of the hottest things ever: Captain America gagging for Tony’s cock, coming from just the feel of it in his mouth.
“Hi, Steve,” Tony says, stopping a couple of feet in front of him, cheeks slightly flushed from the walk, the top couple of buttons of his shirt undone and no tie in sight. He’s gorgeous, and Steve has to stifle the small sigh that wants to slip out.
Yes, he’d given Dr. Stark the go-ahead, but Steve had expected him to do the bare minimum for each step before moving on, not fingerfuck him so thoroughly that he can feel his slick splashing against his ass with each thrust of his hand. That Dr. Stark doesn’t even warn him, acts like Steve’s body is his to do whatever he wants to it, even if it’s just to save them both time, like an object he can manipulate instead of being a person …
“Steve,” he gasped, his hands fisting at his sides, already teetering on the fine edge of control from something as simple as the warmth of Tony’s hand through his shorts, and
“Of course not.  I wouldn’t dream of asking you to,” Tony said, adjusting his sunglasses and avoiding Steve’s gaze.  He eventually pulled out his phone and started tapping away at it, leaving Steve to entertain himself.
came out of nowhere, and his cock, which had gradually been softening while he pondered potential sleeping arrangements, decided to perk up once again, slapping against his stomach at the recollection of Tony’s words.
“You’re . . . you’re Captain America,” gasped Dr. Martin when he walked inside, but she looked more frightened to see him than relieved.
Fuck, he wants Tony’s knot so much, and he doesn’t even care if he comes—although who’s he kidding? Of course he’ll come. He’s about to come again as it is, his approaching orgasm makes him tense up so hard he thinks he’s going to shatter when it finally hits, and if Tony were to knot him, he’d come over and over again, get knot-drunk on Tony’s cock and keep coming from the aftershocks long after Tony was finished with him.
The last tentacle, his favorite if he’s being absolutely honest although he’d deny it to anyone else, he rewards by giving it free reign of Steve’s cock.
But then, what choice had Tony had in what he lost? Steve thought, horribly conscious of the emptiness of Tony’s lab behind him, and he took a shuddering breath and did what he’d been told.
This has been sitting on my computer for like a year, and I realized I'm never going to write more, so why not post it as short fic?  Yay, short fic!
to complain. Very much. But . . . it would’ve been selfish. And rude. Of the two of them, he’d been the one to have the most orgasms—although he’d tried to give Tony another one—and Tony had been an extremely generous lover.
“Alright, so why don’t you take a look around and then let’s talk punishment,” Tony said as he and Steve walked into the house they’d be staying in for the next few days. Tony had been very secretive after coming back out of his study the previous day, just warning Steve that the penthouse wasn’t equipped for what he’d planned and that they’d be flying to a property he owned upstate.
“Yes,” Steve said, and it took Tony a second to comprehend he was responding to his question, but when he did, he immediately looked over at him. Steve, however, was focused on his plate and didn’t meet his eyes.
There was a moment when Steve was returning the Stones that he realized … he didn’t have to go back. He could stay.
my back!” Tony growled, immediately faltering as Steve’s gaze met his, his expression stealing whatever else he might have said.
He envied Tony his lack of self-consciousness, his unblemished skin that suggested he’d never given his heart away and had it trampled on.  It was the main reason he started sleeping with him.  Tony knew how to protect his heart.  He wouldn’t be stupid enough to fall in love with Steve, and Steve, well, he’d already learned his lesson.
“Alright. I won’t then. Do you want to tell me why? The option is still open for you to talk, so we don’t misunderstand each other again.”
Except then Stark had started talking again, and it’d been painfully obvious that he’d known the direction of Steve’s thoughts from the way he’d turned from him then, his expression becoming pained and tight, but not angry. He’d never once looked angry.
Steve doesn’t know if that’s a step up or a step down from his normal state of finding Tony attractive, but it’s not like he has a say in the matter either way.  Tony has a habit of getting under a person’s skin and then making himself at home, and Steve is not immune.
Tony doesn’t mind that Steve’s … peculiar about this sort of thing. Even growing up, he’s always been more eager to go to a doctor than he maybe should’ve been, and he’s been known to masturbate a time or two (or twenty) after his semi-annual visits, but the doctors in his fantasies have always been faceless. Nameless. Until Tony. Until Tony had him on his table and proceeded to give Steve one of the most intense orgasms in his life.
There was still a hint of skepticism on Captain America’s face, so Tony wasn’t surprised by his vague answer of, “There was an . . . accident.  I’m having a . . . bad reaction to it.”
“All right, why don’t you scoot down a couple of inches,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve does it without comment or, shockingly, any kind of inappropriate bodily secretions, and he wonders if he’s reached the point where he can’t feel shame anymore.
“What? No. No, Steve, there’s nothing to be sorry for, Sweetheart,” Tony tells him, taking Steve’s hands and squeezing them gently, and Steve is so caught off-guard by Tony touching him and being affectionate that he can only stare. “I mean, I was pretty surprised, and I know it’s not how either of us expected today to go, but that was just … an accident,” he says, as if Steve spilled his coffee on him instead of becoming extremely and inappropriately turned on. “Now I know not to talk shop, and the next time should go much smoother.”
There was the longest pause, and Steve thought he might’ve heard Tony swallowing, but he couldn’t be certain over the thudding in his ears. “Is she?” Tony said, his voice sounding strange. “Well, I wouldn’t want to keep SHIELD waiting now, would I? I’ll take it in the lab, JARVIS.”
Steve knew Tony was still talking, but he was stuck on the “milked” thing. Tony wanted to milk him. That was . . .
For a moment, he was almost regretful that he’d chosen him for his latest victim, that this would be all they’d ever have together.  But then again, who was to say that he would ever have met him in the real world?  That even if they
Tony walked past the table set for two without comment, and Steve followed, at a loss as Tony got two large mugs down, leaving one coffee black but doctoring the second with cream and sugar. Steve only took cream in his, so he doubted either of them were for him, and Tony didn’t ask if he wanted one of his own.
him, let alone done anything that would require a doctor, but would explaining that make things better or worse? How would the doctor and SHIELD handle finding out that the contract hadn’t been . . . invoked?
“What?” Steve asked, completely forgetting for a second that he hadn’t answered Tony yet in the face of Tony’s words. Wait up? Did that mean—?
“Alright, what about just boyfriends then?” Tony said, giving in so easily that Steve had the irritating certainty that that had been exactly what Tony had been hoping for all along.  “That’s not really lying.  We’re friends.  And we’re boys.  Well, men.  Manly men even.  So manfriends then.  Except manfriends sounds a little raunchy, but maybe that’s just me.”
Steve should be extremely concerned that he’s waking up next to a man whose voice he doesn’t recognize.  The guy doesn’t
“No, don’t tense up now. Let me in,” Dr. Stark orders, thrusting, all but battering his hand against Steve’s poor hole, and Steve tears up at the thought of disappointing him. He tries, he tries to relax, but Dr. Stark keeps rubbing and shoving into him, every thrust sending shocks through his body, each one stronger than the last.
Steve made sure Tony wasn’t holding anything flammable or explosive, and then he stuck the sandwiches under Tony’s face. “Tony, it’s time to eat.”
“Don’t you think he’s laying it on a little thick?” Peter muttered next to him, tension running like a current through his body. Steve had to resist the urge to pat him on the back. They were in uniform, and it wouldn’t be appropriate to show anything that might come off as a weakness in front of an unknown entity. Even if it
Steve glared at him, but it just didn’t have the same effect on him when it was coming from Thor’s face.  That probably wouldn’t last if Steve spent much more time in Thor’s body, but now that Tony knew Steve couldn’t guilt him into acting better with just a look, he planned to take advantage of it for as long as he could.
He understood that Tony thought he’d kept something from Steve, but so what if he hadn’t told him? Yes, Steve was relieved that Tony was going to get his equipment back, and it did bring him a small level of comfort, but it didn’t change the fact that SHIELD had taken it away from Tony because of Steve in the first place.
“This isn’t a job for a civilian, no matter how much they might want it to be,” he said, frowning when Clint looked like he was going to argue again. “If Tony loses control, I have a better chance of stopping him, and I’ll be able to heal a hell of a lot faster than either of you. It should be me.”
Steve had hoped that Tony’s increasingly frequent visits meant that Tony had begun to feel the same way about him, but apparently, Tony’d had a much darker motive that had nothing to do with Steve.
“C’mon, let’s get out of here,” he said roughly, pulling the curtain around Steve’s bed so he was outside of it, and Steve could see his body outlined in the fabric, standing guard until he came out.
I’ve been writing so much angst recently that I decided to take the crack road with this one. Okay, okay, it got a little angsty at the end, but only a little bit.
Steve keeps waiting for the other shoe to drop, because you don't have a conversation like that with Tony Stark and then think everything's going to be alright.  And sure enough, Tony starts making demands, ordering Steve around and watching expectantly, like he really thinks Steve's going to go along with it.
Steve nodded again, not quite trusting his voice, but he raised his head back up to meet Tony’s eyes and squared his shoulders.
Evidently, Dr. Stark does, because he picks up where he left off, and Steve manages to control himself for the next part of the exam—until he hears Dr. Stark pull out a stirrup, and then Steve releases enough slick that he semi-seriously wonders if it’s going to start sliding across the leather because of how wet he’s making it.
“I … I didn’t,” Steve said, taking in but not understanding the smear of red on the top of Tony’s collar, the slight stumble to Tony’s steps. Had Tony been out all night? He must have if he were dressed like that—although when had he changed and where? And did that mean Tony hadn’t slept at all? Or had he—?
Tony backed away, not far, but giving Steve enough room to pull his shirt off and tug the shorts and underwear down. He kept the extra lube that he’d stowed in the pocket, although he was still dripping from how much he’d used earlier, and then he tossed the clothes far away from them both.
honest with me. Don’t tell me what you think I want to hear or think you should say, just … just tell me the truth.”
Of course, if asked, he wouldn’t have thought Nick would agree either; had thought Nick was a good man as well. Still did, although Nick had obviously been blinded by all the wrongs he’d seen during his years at SHIELD.
“I don’t think so,” he says, but it’s almost a question. He knows some omegas really like being bitten on their necks during their heats, but he can take it or leave it. The way he feels right now, though, the thought of some dark-haired alpha biting him, pinning him down and holding him in place as he’s forced to take his knot—
It hadn’t been enough. He hadn’t been. He knew that already. It was why they were in this situation. Because for all his good intentions, he’d never done half the things he should’ve.
Steve’s thighs clench, tilting inward, but it’s too late for any attempt at modesty, was too late the moment Steve called the office and made an appointment this morning. Steve is literally going to pay to have Dr. Stark clinically slide those long, capable fingers inside of him, and it’ll be impossible for Dr. Stark to miss how hard Steve gets in response or how much slick he gushes as Dr. Stark works him open.
not when he was around since it’d make mutually ignoring it that much harder later on, and if that meant pushing Steve a little bit harder than necessary, so be it. “How do you feel about about going up against the suit for our workout today? Great!” he said, not waiting for an answer. “I’ll meet you at the elevator in thirty minutes,” he told him and firmly closed the door before Steve’s heels had even touched the ground.
It takes a moment for Steve’s brain to catch up with what’s just happened, slowing down the quick, deft movements until it seems like Tony is virtually stroking his arms, and Steve stares and stares at the revealed skin, barely blinking.
Welp, I was recently plagiarized. (Many, many thanks to Ella for bringing it to my attention) Same words except different fandom and different pairing. It's the second time that it's happened to me, and I still really don't know how to feel about it. I mean, it's kind of back-handed compliment, right? Although it's very annoying too. And I feel defensive about the fact that it didn't do as well in that other fandom--even though obviously the characterizations are different so it really
When Steve tensed, he hurried on to say, “We don’t have to say you’re my Sub—it might even be better if we don’t, since I know your identity is still a secret, and it’ll be incredibly fishy for Tony Stark to get a new Sub and then for Iron Man to suddenly start showing up places with Captain America. You could always be my new assistant maybe, but we can figure out the details later. SHIELD and I still have to work on setting up a fake past for you—”
The first thing Tony smells when he walks into the door is the heavy, almost-sour smell of an omega in heat.
Steve has seen the way Dr. Stark interacts with his staff and with other patients, and he knows he’s funny and smart and kind. Steve also knows that he’s unbearably attracted to him and that no matter how inappropriately excited Steve might get during an exam, he’d want to talk to Dr. Stark even if he weren’t in the medical field. What he doesn’t know, however, is how Dr. Stark feels about him.
It’s not the first time Steve’s come on Dr. Stark’s table, his breath trapped in his throat and his back curved off the table, and it’s probably not going to be the last.
“That’s all well and good for you, but what’s in it for me?” he asked, like the answer wasn’t obvious.  He’d watched the reels.  No one could watch Captain America in action and not go a little gaga for him.  Even without all the shared (but not really) history they had, Captain America was a prize all on his own.
A wave of relief rushes over Steve, so big that his limbs actually feel a little rubbery in the aftermath.
Steve blinks down at the towels, lightly touching the evidence that Tony had worried about protecting Steve’s bed, about taking care of Steve, and he just—
” It was too much sensation all at once, and he wasn’t ready for them, for how strong the vibrations were, how fast, and Steve convulsed, yelling—
“Yes,” she said, and he started to turn away. “Not because you’re Captain America, but because you’re Steve Rogers, and you’re good, and you’re kind, and you don’t deserve to be lonely.”
“Yeah,” Tony said slowly, wondering what the hell was up with the guy.  “You gotta make sure you get a car that can handle all these mountains.”  He could feel his eye start twitching, and fuck, he hoped one of his headaches wasn’t coming on.
He already knew that he couldn’t get around the law, but Stark might be willing to be his Dom in name only, especially if Steve could prove to him and Nick that he didn’t
Tony looked at him for a long time, although if he were trying to find some sign of doubt, there was none.
“Yes?” Steve asked, uncertain, but he came over, and Tony smiled reassuringly at him. This was the first step, getting Steve to be comfortable around him. They wouldn’t get anywhere if Steve was nervous.
Dr. Stark just smiles, and maybe the drape won’t be so bad after all because at least Steve will be able to hide just how bright red he gets every time he sticks his foot into his mouth (it’s the only thing that’s going to be shoved into his mouth tonight at this rate, and that thought is way more depressing than it has any right to be).
, his loud growls rumbling against Steve’s back, and Steve whispered, “Oh fuck,” as Tony began knotting him.
Except he’d kept thinking about it, the argument popping up at odd times over the following week.  Intimacy implied exposure, implied being open and vulnerable and that really was only fun during sex, and even then, it was better when he was on the other ends of things.
“No, it’s my dad’s sixtieth birthday.  They’re throwing a big party, everyone’s invited, and as the only child, I’m expected to show up.  We’d fly out tomorrow, be back the day after that.  If you agreed,” he added, and Steve knew, just
“I need you to punish me,” he said, his voice cracking, and fuck, he wanted to hear what Tony had been about to say, but he couldn’t, not until Tony knew how sincere he was, how sorry he was, not until he’d earned the privilege of Tony’s forgiveness. “Please, Tony.”
“There’s no one who wants to see me,” he said harshly, and stood up, walking to the window. He’d become very familiar with the view outside, although he’d been depending less on it in the past couple of months.
wants to be fucked for hours at a time regularly. Right?” Tony said, and even without Tony’s hand under his chin, Steve didn’t think he could’ve looked away at that moment.
Inasmuch as Steve had a schedule, he typically spent his mornings with Stark: a late breakfast, and then the two of them talking—or Stark talking at him, and then working out before coming back for another shower and lunch. They’d even gone from spending one hour in the gym together to longer, neither of them keeping track of the time other than Steve counting how frequently Stark would complain that he was either going to be in the best shape of his life or suffer a heart attack from Steve’s exercise regime.
Stark had five guest bedrooms, and Steve had finally chosen one that was neither too far nor too close to the master suite in a mix of rebellion (he wouldn’t let Stark think he was hiding from him and whatever he had in store for Steve) and bull-headedness (but he wouldn’t be at his beck and call, sidling up close like he was anxious to be used) that he wouldn’t have been able to explain if Stark had asked. Not that he had.
to give up. No matter what life threw at him, he always came back swinging and won. Captain America was larger than life, a symbol of everything Americans should be. He didn’t . . .
Any other day, Tony would’ve happy to oblige him, but it was already all he could do to keep himself together. No matter how much he tried to prevent it, his mind kept trying to dissect every scene he’d ever had with Steve, looking for any other time he’d pushed him further than he’d wanted to go. He knew he’d eventually be unable to stop himself, but he couldn’t afford to get lost in his own thoughts now when Steve needed him to be present. It didn’t help that he was starting to feel shaky, not horribly so, but enough that he was afraid Steve would notice the occasional tremor in his knees, and the thought of trying to yell it out in addition to all the rest of it made his chest feel like it was caving in.
But of course Steve had known that. It was why Tony had used his safeword. Because Steve had pushed him there, because Steve wasn’t any good. Because Tony had realized just how bad he was and had given up on him.
“Okay, one more now,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve shoves away his thoughts, lets himself get lost in the burn of being opened up for larger things, the sounds of his own strained breathing and the faint squelch of Dr. Stark’s latex-covered fingers ramping his arousal higher. He wonders if his slick is leaking down Dr. Stark’s glove, if the scent-blockers Dr. Stark wears are enough to cover up the cloud of Steve’s desire, so thick that he can taste himself on his tongue, and if not, how Dr. Stark stands it.
Of course, Tony only has morning appointments on Saturdays, so they could always decide to grab lunch afterwards, maybe catch a movie or take a walk around, let the date run long and possibly …
Later on, most of his physicals had been done in the presence of so many other people—potential enlistees or soldiers or a roomful of doctors eager to poke and prod him for themselves—that it hadn’t mattered he didn’t have someone there specifically for him. But now there was Stark, someone who barely knew him—barely
Maybe it was too much to ask for, maybe he was sabotaging himself so the knife would sink that much deeper later on, but then, he’d always been the king of bad decisions.
to sub, not with him anyway, maybe not with anyone, not for a long time. And two looks didn’t change that, especially not when Tony was the only semi-familiar landmark that Steve had.
“I could tell you were deep beneath the surface, and I tried diving, which is how I lost all my things, but I couldn’t get very far, so I just kept flying in circles until I couldn’t anymore.”
“No, it’s not. You came back,” Tony said, and Steve squeezed his fingers convulsively, his head ducking down. “You apologized, and you explained
“Oh, sorry,” Dr. Stark says, raising his voice, and Steve wishes again that he could see his face instead of the drape. “I asked if you have anywhere you have to be after this. I know we started late—”
He sighed, opening his eyes, and even though the windows were shaded, the lights from the buildings outside provided enough illumination to see the outlines of “his” furniture.
a place that big? He could fit another bedroom—two even, three—inside his, and still have room left over, and there were four more guest rooms and Stark’s room besides. What was the
I think I said I wasn't going to pull in the events of TWS, but I've changed my mind, so that's coming up next. I've changed the ending in my head at least 3 times by now, ugh.
He switched to his first two fingers, leisurely thrusting them in and out, and waited until Steve was moaning, was tensing up, his arm going faster, and only then did Tony say, “Don’t come. But don’t stop either,” he said, smiling down at the expression on Steve’s face, and he slid his fingers out from between red lips.
“Steve …”  Tony sighed again. “Okay.” His head seemed to rest heavier against Steve for an instant before it lifted away. “Okay.”
, and truthfully, that’s good enough for him right now.  He doesn’t want to think anymore.  He just wants to smother himself in his pillow and demand sympathy.  Possibly a head rub.
The only saving grace is that Dr. Stark isn’t touching the nipples themselves, just the areolas, which is bad enough to make Steve wonder if he can grind his hands down onto his cock without Dr. Stark noticing somehow, but not so bad that he can’t cling to his self-control and resist the urge.
One and a half years later, they had the keys to each other’s homes, saw each other two to three times a week, and texted who knew how many times a day.
“Hold it above your head, arms straight but don’t lock your elbows. I’ll tell you when you can put it down.”
He blinks, lifting his head from Tony’s hair where he’s … apparently been trying to catch Tony’s scent, oh crap, even though he knows that Tony has to wear blockers for work. He doesn’t know why scenting Tony is more embarrassing than anything else they’ve been doing, but it really, really is.
He didn’t know why his subconscious chose the good memories over the bad, but they’d appear over and over again, a filmstrip of might-have-beens that cut worse than even the look on Tony’s face the last time they’d been alone. When had Tony stopped being a means to end and become someone he actually wanted to be with? How could he never have realized how much he’d come to depend on him until after it was already too late?
“Yes,” Steve breathed, licking his lips before taking Tony’s thumb in, sucking and rolling his tongue around it.
Tony didn’t say anything, just blinked once, slow and heavy, and then his fingers went to the top of his jeans, undoing the button and sliding the zipper down, and Steve realized he was staring.
“Did you just—?” Tony started to laugh, his forehead coming to rest against Steve’s thigh, and Steve found himself smiling sheepishly as well, even as he wanted to cover his face in embarrassment. He couldn’t believe he’d done that.
The first thought Tony had when he saw Captain America was that he wanted to climb him like a tree.  The second was that it was a good thing Captain America’s ass wasn't any rounder, because otherwise, Tony would've had to get down on his knees and bite it.  The third was that he was so fucking screwed.
“I want to,” he said, forcing himself to sit up, but Tony’s hand on his shoulder kept him from rising any further.
He slowed down after that, however, drawing out his lunch until he would’ve had to lick the crumbs off his plate to get anything else and Steve was pushing his stool back to get up, and it was only then that he finally managed to force himself to blurt, “I think you should choose a safeword.”
“I’m not—” Steve could hear Tony swallow, felt the fine tremble in his hand. “I’m not in the right headspace for this. Honestly, I don’t think you are either, and if we had kept going, I’m not sure either of us would’ve been okay.”
He’d thought he’d known what Steve wanted. He’d thought that he would give Steve a safe harbor, somewhere he could catch up on the life that had passed him by while he regained a degree of control that SHIELD would never have allowed him.  But was that enough?
“Please,” Steve said, his voice coming out broken.  He didn’t know how long they’d been having sex, but it felt like hours, like
that was why Steve had come back, so there was no reason to feel like someone had taken a hammer and tried to pry out the arc reactor from his chest. It didn’t change anything.
“Look,” Tony said, reaching out to put a calming hand on Captain America’s arm, “I don’t know what Dom/Sub dynamics were like back then, or your past relationships, but nowadays—”
Except it was a lot … wetter … than he’d expected, and he jerked back to his feet, his cheeks blazing as he realized what the problem was. The problem that was starting to drip down his thigh.
Steve goes to sleep with cat-Tony asleep on the pillow next to him, and he wakes with a very naked, very affectionate human-Tony on his chest, licking up Steve’s neck and making rumbly sounds in the back of his throat.
He honestly didn’t know who was more startled by the moan Steve made then, although from the expression on Steve’s face, it might have been Steve.
The latter was spiteful of him, he knew, especially considering how little Stark had actually done to earn that reaction. That could change at any second, of course, and Steve wouldn’t be surprised if Stark
Except after a few meals and several hours of sleep, after waking up again and again just to see Steve still there across from him, Tony had started to wonder. Why would Steve say something like that if he didn’t mean it? What purpose could it possibly serve? Could Steve really feel so guilty that he’d tell Tony he loved him as an … apology of some sort? Tony knew just how much it could panic a Sub when their Dom was furious with them, but Steve wouldn’t have just thrown that out there with nothing behind it.
“Why don’t you lie down, Steve,” Tony says, his voice filled with a heat that makes a fresh surge of slick drip down Steve’s thighs, and yes, okay, lying down sounds like a great idea.
He does mind. He minds so, so much, because he wants to do it, wants Dr. Stark to strap him down and make Steve take his fingers, his cock, he wants Dr. Stark to come inside of him and then slide the speculum in and watch all his come leak back out—
Tony blinked. “You’re not DUM-E,” he said blankly and tugged his hand free. “When did you get back?” he asked, reaching up to pull out—
And now, instead of being with her, he was with Stark.  Another link to his past, but one he hadn’t wanted.
Except he doesn’t want to go to Tony, sticky and smelling of dried slick and sweat. It feels like he’s done everything wrong up until this point, so he can wait ten more—eight—five more minutes and do at least this much right.
Dick had the insane and sudden urge to bow, but instead he reached out a hand and smiled, maybe a bit too widely, but it counted nonetheless. “Hello, Mrs. Kent. We’re so glad you could come.”
This was going to happen. He just had to get through it, and then he’d be that much closer to earning Tony’s forgiveness. It was fine. He was fine. Steve believed that.
Two out of three became five out of seven and then nine out of eleven. By the end of the day, Steve was covered in paint—and he’d been wrong: paintballs stung—and wet and he kept finding leaves in interesting places.
It wasn’t that he wished Stark had seen more hardship during his life, but Steve had no idea what to do with all of this abundance.
But Tony just kept softly stroking his hair, letting the strands slide off his fingers again and again, and eventually Steve was able to grate out, “Stopping seemed like giving up. Like I’d be saying you weren’t worth fighting for, and I couldn’t do that.”
“Thank you,” he whispered, the muscles in his thighs and stomach spasming as he fought to not move. And then Tony’s other hand slid up from his hip to close over his neck, not pressing down, just resting against his skin, and Steve’s voice shook. “Thank you. Thank you, thank you,” he chanted, utterly sincere, his fingers digging into his palms. “Thank—”
“Just because we’re not in a contract anymore doesn’t mean I’m not going to keep the promises I made,” Tony said, and it took a lot more time and willpower than Steve would admit to for him to tear his eyes away.
“I never meant …” He clasped his hands, fingers twisting. “I’m so sorry,” he said once again, the latest in a long line of meaningless apologies.
“I’m not hurt,” Steve managed to say, but it came out strangled as Tony got up on his elbow, as he pulled Steve closer until his legs were hitting the mattress.
“Sorry for falling asleep,” Steve said, faltering as Tony got closer and wrapped his arm around Steve’s waist. He had just enough time to think, “Why didn’t I brush my teeth?” before Tony was pressing an open-mouthed kiss to his neck, making his eyes flutter closed.
“Tony, you don’t …” He refuses to let himself get distracted by the fact that they’re touching. For the first time. Somewhere other than their hands and Steve’s—
He managed to get down another sandwich, although it was tough by the end. He felt like he kept chewing and chewing, but the food never became easier to swallow.
“You’ll meet her sometime here in the next couple of days, once you’ve had a chance to settle in a little bit, her and Happy both. Please don’t comment on Happy’s obvious hero worship. He thinks he’s subtle, and we like to humor him.”
,” Steve said, lowering his hands so they hovered over his mouth. He blinked rapidly, and even though Tony’s view was obstructed, he could see Steve’s fragile attempt at a smile. “The very best, Tony.”
For @t0nystark1er’s prompt, which I have lost cause Tumblr deletes messages you respond to but it was along the lines of Ma Kent meeting the Wayne family. I hope you like it!
“I’m heavier than I look,” he said finally, and it wasn’t that he didn’t think Tony could support him, but he wasn’t sure Tony would really want to once he sat down.
He reached for the lube and dripped some directly on Steve’s hole, just to see to squirm, before lubing up his cock. It wasn’t that he didn’t still have concerns about taking this step with Steve, but they just … they didn’t seem to matter half as much as they used to, seemed foolish in the light of Steve’s willingness to be open about him and their relationship together.
Through the tears, Steve could tell Tony looked awful, his face still too pale with weary lines etched deep into his skin, and Steve knew it was his fault, knew that he was hurting Tony, had already hurt Tony, time and time again, had been ever since he’d selfishly come back into Tony’s life—no, longer than that. For as long as Steve had known him.
But Stark had already been awake and had even made breakfast—bagels, fruit, and yogurt, because he and cooking really didn’t mesh well together. Other than a subdued “good morning,” he hadn’t had much to say to Steve, and at the time, Steve had actually been grateful that Stark wasn’t as verbose as normal.
But he’d never taken an unwilling Sub, or one whose kinks didn’t line up with his, because it was all too easy to do something you’d regret the next day when you were in the middle of a scene, and he didn’t want to be that kind of memory for anyone.  He much preferred to be the type of memory that someone brought out in the middle of masturbating, thank you very much, the one that made people blush and squeeze their thighs together because of the pulse of arousal they got from the recollection.  He didn’t think it was asking too much to be considered a sex god was all.
He reviewed the footage of breakfast after she left, wrestling with his conscience for a brief second before telling JARVIS to bring it up on screen. He’d told Steve he didn’t monitor the bedroom cameras, and he didn’t, but the kitchen and living room were virtually public domain.
He discovered that last bit when he’d been sent out on a two-day mission, and Tony had been delighted when Steve had told him, so obnoxiously pleased with himself that Steve almost regretted saying anything. Except then Tony had decided they needed to increase Steve’s minimum to
“Fuck, you should always look like this,” Tony panted, sliding back into his mouth, his thrusts losing rhythm as he neared climax, and Steve wondered if he’d always feel like this, aching and wanting and being desperate to finish but unwilling to stop.
, and yup, there it was, Steve’s hand in his face. It was gone a second later at Tony’s look, and Steve took a few obliging steps back in order to give him space, his hands up in the air.
, and Steve’s body apparently wants to make sure no one can ever use these blankets again without smelling the two of them together. He tries to feel guilty about it as he clamps his legs together in order to hopefully contain the latest barrage of scent, but truthfully, what he mostly feels is embarrassed down to his very bones and simultaneously terribly smug.
“So are you,” Steve said breathily, and Tony grinned at the compliment, slid his thumb up so it was barely parting Steve’s lips.
“Yes,” he said, and he had no doubt that Tony could manage without giving any indication of how much it actually hurt. After all, Steve hadn’t suspected anything was wrong until he’d seen the evidence laid out before in angry, horrific lines.
For a second, there’s nothing but the thunder of Steve’s heartbeat and the faint sounds of Dr. Stark moving in and out of him and
Because Steve did. He was starting to suspect that he wanted everything Tony was willing to give him.
“Yeah, see, I don’t own anything that could keep you trapped for long,” he said, at least, not yet anyway. He had some orders in. “Not to say you
He finally just settles on, “How are you doing?” in his blandest voice possible, going for nonchalant and succeeding if he does say so himself.
“Thank you,” Tony said, his fingers ghosting down Steve’s cheek before dropping away completely, and Steve missed them fiercely as soon as they were gone. “Keep them closed until I tell you otherwise.”
“It’s okay, Dad,” Joe said, looking like he was going to reach out and touch Steve.  “Now that I know the time machine works, you can go back and save Pops—”
a Dom, more like someone who’d had an unwanted guest drop in on him out of the blue and felt obligated to keep a close eye on him as a result. And when Steve thought about it like that, that he was a guest in Stark’s home and of course expected to adhere to the wishes of his host, then it almost felt like he could breathe again.
“Maybe he doesn’t mean to do it,” she said, so carefully blank that it obvious how likely she thought that was, “but he does it anyway, and what are you going to do when he leaves again? When this whole learning period of his is over?”
Tony watched with interest as Steve hesitated.  The thing about locking the two of them together was that it required some cooperation on Tony’s part unless Steve was planning to get rough, something Tony was betting he wasn’t willing to do.  At least, not with someone who wasn’t posting a threat of any kind. Those muscles couldn’t all be for show after all.
He blames Steve completely.  It’s his fault for being so good-looking and funny and kind and hell, stubborn and opinionated and sexy—did he mention the sexy?  Because damn.
Steve could swear that he heard Tony’s voice, but that made no sense.  Tony hadn’t been in the ice with him, hadn’t even known Tony existed then.  He’d been alone, forgotten and unnecessary.
ETA: I totally forgot to give a shout-out to Anchanee who gave me the idea of Steve asking Tony out on a date. Thank you so much!
“Oh come on,” Dr. Strange said as he steps through his portal, back from whatever dimension he’d been in for the past few months. “Aren’t you guys done with all your idiotic tests yet?” He turned his back on all of them in obvious dismissal. “It’s good to see you again, Stark. I meant to be here for your arrival, but I got stuck in—”
Steve shouted when Tony shoved into him, back bowing off the bed as Tony started a fast rhythm of deep, powerful thrusts.  He was going to be so sore later, could already feel the ache growing and growing, but it didn’t matter when compared to the pleasure that tore through him, to the feeling of Tony taking what he wanted and giving Steve everything he needed in the process.
He hadn’t considered, however, how his sudden revelation would affect Tony. Although if he had, he would’ve hoped Tony’d be happy … except that wasn’t what had happened.
“I don’t think naughty boys get presents,” Steve said, wondering how his life had come to the point that he sounded like a character out of one of those porn movies Tony liked so much.
bad,” he said, and Steve had to resist the urge to tell him that as long as Tony forgave him for real, it could be as bad as he wanted it to be.
Tony had barely touched him as he’d helped take off his clothes, but Steve’s cock was already hard against his stomach, and his heart was pounding like it was trying to escape the confines of his chest.  If this was how he felt before they even got started, how was he going to feel by the time he’d gotten Tony’s invention inside of him?
But either Tony hadn’t thought of that in the heat of the moment, or Tony had decided the risk of Thanos stopping him was too high, and after all, what did one life matter against billions?
The first time he drinks is right after he wakes up from a nightmare. He’s dreamed about killing Tony before, but never quite like this, crushing the arc reactor with the edge of his shield, Tony getting paler and paler as he gasps, clawing at his chest, Steve gloating over him, watching him die.
“Ah, there you go, just like that. Hold still now,” Dr. Stark tells him, and fuck, fuck, fuck. Steve doesn’t know if the partial praise is to blame or if it’s the command, but he’s getting lightheaded with pleasure.
“JARVIS is my AI. He’s a computer—he’s actually much more than a computer—but for your purposes, you can think of him as a computer. If you need something when I’m not around, you can ask him. Say hello to Steve, JARVIS.”
I was actually planning to write more of this, but I ran out of time.  I still might though.  We'll see.
But all Tony says is, "Interesting," and he hums a little as he takes his drink and walks out the room.
I wasn’t necessary at the Compound, Tony.  There was nothing I could do except guard duty, and considering the outposts keep Them back, it just meant standing around, doing nothing.  That’s not the type of person I am.  I can’t stand back and let other people get hurt for me.  Please understand.
He feels guilty for making Tony take care of his mess, for not even being able to help because he has to go to the bathroom and arrange things in order to keep from being arrested for indecency, and just for being the way he is around Tony. It manages to kill the arousal at long last, and it leaves him drained and unhappy.
Sorry for the spammage, guys.  Just try to get all these prompts finished.  Just 7 more to go.  *dies*
him, occasionally thrusting into him when Steve least expects it, or pushing against his hole as he reaches inside of him so Steve is virtually grinding against his hand. All of that plus the fact that Steve doesn’t know what Dr. Stark learned in med school, but whatever he’s doing to his prostate should be illegal in all fifty states, and Steve’s going to come again.
Tony blinked.  A chance to do what?  It was true that Steve had been making various offers to do something together in recent weeks, but he’d been doing that with all the Avengers.  While Tony appreciated Steve’s need to establish ties between their members in order to form a more cohesive unit, blah, blah, blah, Tony wasn’t much for group retreats and singing “Kumbaya” around the campfire, and he didn’t know why his refusals would make Steve sound so resigned.
He’d devoted a few more hours to looking for Bucky when Tony finally appeared, but it wasn’t the sound of Tony’s bedroom door opening that startled Steve but the sound of the elevator.
That thought gets swept away like flotsam in a current as he discovers the tip of his tentacle can actually dip
, and Steve had always thought Tony was kind, but it turns out he can be undeniably cruel as well. Steve whines miserably low in his throat when Tony adds another finger, even now refusing to stop kissing him, and he adamantly twists away when Tony tries to add a third, his thighs clenching around Tony’s hips as he attempts to rub against the hard curve of his cock.
“You’re just saying that so you can have first pick for yourself.” Tony winked. “Sneaky, but it won’t work. No one should stand between a man and his breakfast pastry.”
“As a matter of fact, there might be times when I don’t let you come at all. Not for days,” Tony said, his tone contemplative. “I think I’d really like to see you desperate.”
“Mr. Rogers?” Nurse Grace calls, and he inhales sharply before standing up to follow her into the back.
He stood over the toilet and pushed down his clothes, taking himself in hand. Although there were many benefits to his new body, there were disadvantages as well—not that he’d considered it one until after he’d woken up in a new century, alone and adrift.
Tony’s companion was blonde, but her face was in profile and partially obscured, and Steve couldn’t tell if it was Pepper or someone completely different. He told himself that it didn’t matter either way. He didn’t believe it, though.
“Hi, can I help you?” tall, blond, and handsome asks, and what are with those ridiculous arm muscles? Florists aren’t supposed to have biceps like that.
“Alright,” Tony said, like it still didn’t make his heart pound every time he heard Steve say it. “Honor.”
The lights turned on as soon as they stepped past the doorway, and he guided Tony to the bed, trying not to look around. He’d never been in Tony’s room before, but he hadn’t exactly been invited, so it felt wrong to satisfy his curiosity. He focused instead on Tony and had him sit down on the mattress, finally letting go of him. He ignored how empty his hand felt and worked on helping Tony pull of his shirt—he’d seen at least two dollops of a combination of mustard and mayonnaise fall on it—but he was careful to leave the undershirt on.
They have to look ridiculous, he’s sure, and Pepper would probably laugh her fins right off if she could see them make their oh-so-slow way to a tiny island where the Angel can potentially recuperate. At this pace, it should take about an hour to get there.There’s not too much on it other than some coconut trees, but somewhat past that is a bigger island where he can move the Angel later if need be, and that one has more things for the Angel to potentially eat, as well as a freshwater lake.
Never let it be said that Tony Stark hadn’t suffered for a cause. This rule inconvenienced him the most on a day-to-day basis, but he needed to monitor that Steve was eating well, and furthermore, sharing meals was a way to bring people closer together. Even if they’d prefer to be apart.
“Right, wrong holiday.  Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!  With rum,” Tony added as an afterthought, wrapping his hand around Steve’s neck, his thumb caressing his jaw.  “Look, we’re under the mistletoe.”
“This is actually more of a Christmas present to myself.  You just happen to be the messenger.  The deliveryman.  Don’t worry, I won’t ask you to wear those cute shorts those guys always have on—”
“What’s your safe word?” he asked, checking with JARVIS that he was picking up on Steve’s vitals now that they were so close. There was a definite element of risk to what Tony wanted to do, and while he trusted Steve to tell him if something was wrong, he had no intention of hurting Steve accidentally.
affected, much more than he would’ve thought possible considering the idea of doing this for Tony hadn’t aroused him.  The reality, however, was a little different.
“Hug me back, damn it,” he rasped, and Steve did, wrapping his arms around Tony with a shudder and curving into him.
,” Tony assured him, interrupting again because seriously. It would’ve been one thing if either of them had been enjoying the self-flagellation, but it was entirely another when neither of them wanted it.
Not that Steve deserved sensitivity when he was basically an asshole incarnate, but fine, Tony had always wanted to say he’d acted like the better man, and now he could.
Steve hadn’t realized he’d come to a stop until he saw Tony stumble in front of him, just out of arm’s reach, unbalanced enough that Steve reacted without thinking, jumping forward and grabbing Tony’s shoulder to steady him—
. He can go for short periods, and he’s practiced enough that he can even run for a bit, but afterwards, he needs a nap, because that shit’s draining.
Tony blinked down at the crumbs on his plate, his brain stumbling and stopping before starting up again.
Steve hadn’t waited up for Tony. He hadn’t gone to sleep as early as he might have normally, spending the time going through files on the Winter Soldier, on Hydra, piecing together what information he could and trying to figure out ways to find Bucky, but it hadn’t exactly been a productive exercise. He’d kept being distracted by the memory of Tony’s anger, by his own guilt, and by the fear that Tony would change his mind to be able to concentrate fully. Steve had finally gone to sleep, determined not to have the first act he committed upon coming back to be disobeying Tony, but he’d tossed and turned the whole night, his thoughts too crowded with everything that had happened to find rest.
So it’s horrible of him to suddenly wish otherwise, and he tries to stop himself from imagining what it’d be like to walk into Dr. Stark’s office and tell him his heats are giving him problems—
Fury stared at him thoughtfully with his one good eye for a long time before nodding and saying, “Alright.  Come with me.”
. He wasn’t strong enough for that. “Can you tell me—” He stopped, the words becoming stuck in his throat, and he swallowed desperately. It seemed wrong to talk. It
“You seemed comfortable enough this morning,” she said. Pepper and Happy had both come by during breakfast for the meet-and-greet, and Steve had been incredibly polite and gentlemanly throughout, completely unlike the first time he’d met Tony. Not that he was bitter or anything.
But what it boils down to is that there is a teenage version of himself from an alternate reality running around, and he spends about eighty percent of his time hitting on Tony.
. Close enough for Steve to reach out and grab. Held up like Steve could just ask for it and Tony would—
But he hadn’t even thought about it. He’d followed Tony and done what he’d said, and he hadn’t even thought about
What if he’d been wrong though? What if Steve wanted more? And if so, what was Tony going to do about it?
