The detective grimaced, squeezing viciously hard at the base of his cock, but a dormant, hands-free, and painfully drawn-out and lazy orgasm seeped through, unusually unsatisfying.
"…How am I meant to sustain the energy for rampant sex with no food?" Sherlock mumbled to his absent lover, feeling entirely put-out and cranky- John was supposed to take care of him. He began slump - dragging himself toward the kitchen, intent on making tea- when he saw John's laptop sat in his armchair, out of its usual place. Sherlock's eyes narrowed.
"Um..." John glanced at Sherlock's mobile, the screening lighting up with a new message. "What about the-"
John didn't waste any time, sinking to his knees as Sherlock fumbled with his own zipper and flies. His cock hit John in the face, bouncing wetly against his chin before he engulfed it artlessly in his mouth.
Shaun laughed, pulling away, already unfastening his own trousers. "Care to return the favour, Watson?"
There followed a long thirty seconds of swollen silence and Sherlock's laboured breathing. "...What did you want?" He asked, sounding distinctly troubled and irritable. John shrugged.
Mycroft's lips tightened. "This isn't a time for you to be childish, Sherlock. This mission is of vital importance-"
Sherlock either didn't notice or chose not to comment, but he did drop John's hand and, burying his own in the pockets of his coat, stalked over to where Jason stood. John hurried to follow him, ready to protect Sherlock if he needed to.
"Want to try it?" John asked, perfectly serious, and Sherlock literally gasped, his jaw dropping. In another situation, it would have almost been comical.
It was the work of some minutes- and failing a few times as memories of Sherlock rutting against him in the sitting room and Sherlock asking John to fuck him kept intruding- but finally, John was soft again and he breathed a sigh of relief as Sherlock snuggled closer, snuffling against John's skin. He pushed his head against John's scarred shoulder, rubbing his cheek against it like a selfish cat and John made another attempt to shift himself away (though he was running out of mattress).
"Maybe." He frowned down at his phone, swallowing, distracted, as his fingers tried to make sense of the on-screen keyboard, a problem he had not previously experienced.
John slowly blinked awake, disoriented, unsure of where he was. A regular beeping played havoc with his brain for a few seconds before he identified it as a pulse monitor. It took him even longer to realize it was his own pulse monitor. The room around him was familiar, was the surgery they kept patients in, but John couldn't remember why he would be there, in a bed, his body throbbing in pain.
He heard the heart monitor start beeping faster, his chest rising and falling as he started to pant, panicking. Each breath hurt, made something on his chest pull and smart and sting. The door suddenly opened and a nurse hurried in. "Watson, you'll have to relax."
"Who invited him," John murmured, and was greeted by a few faint noises. Furious, but determined to restrain himself as long as possible, he snarled deafeningly at his comrades. "WHO INVITED HIM?!"
All the breath whooshed from Sherlock's lungs as he landed on his back on the ground, John a heavy but wonderful weight on top of him. He was surrounded by stimuli- the scent of fresh cut grass, the shouts of children not far off, laughter and happy screams, the hard, compact earth beneath him, smelling of dead leaves and a rich, dark smell he couldn't place. The sunlight speared through the foliage overhead, dappling all around them, turning John's hair wheat gold by turns. John's erection dug into Sherlock's hip, his own nestled snugly against John's thigh, finally able to seek the relief he craved.
"...Is that why you're here? You knew, and you wanted to take the piss out of me?" John asked, his voice sounding more hurt than angered. "I should've known that you'd worked it out."
"Shut up, Sherlock." John huffed as they waited for the lift, before he bit the inside of his cheek and sighed heavily. "Sorry. It's just...I've been here too many times before."
"I don't want you to do this again." John murmured, doing up Sherlock's jeans with infinite care, taking his hands in his own and squeezing them. "You're all right now, sweetheart. You're fine."
.” The taller man ran frustrated hands through his already-wild curls, dazzling John with a wave of golden glints amongst tumultuous black twists. “I’m going to delete it. This clearly needs…further thought.”
"You're amazing." He said, watching as Sherlock's eyes sparkled back at him. "Now, shall we go and view the exhibit, Mr. Holmes?" He asked, offering Sherlock his arm.
Sherlock stabbed his hard, clothed cock painfully into John’s stomach a few times, his fingernails digging viciously deep into John’s palm and lower back respectively. The hot, wet exhales that exploded against John’s throat were soon chilled by the heaving gasps that were fuelling Sherlock’s climax.
Hence this, his clandestine visit. Sherlock closed his eyes, losing himself in the tingling sensations he was provoking in his own body. The fabric of his pyjamas rubbed distractingly over the head of his cock with each motion of his hand, brushing along the sensitive skin and making Sherlock shudder in increasing desire. He nibbled on his plump bottom lip, grimacing in pleasure, eyes still tightly closed. It was a risk he was well aware of- John could wake at any moment and catch Sherlock unaware- but he couldn't resist as his strong fingers continued to tease and tug on his tumescent shaft. Sherlock's staggered inhales, growing heavier the faster he moved his hand, tasted of John's sweet, sleeping, nocturnal, delicious, irresistible scent...Sherlock choked down a lustful growl as the sexual adjectives regarding his doctor- of which he had many- began to spin and mount into lascivious stacks and engage in vivid, flesh-coloured orgies in his Mind Palace.
"Listen to me," John uttered, swallowing hard and noisily, the sound oddly organic and notable against the far-distant hum of the live classical band and the tiniest buzz of conversation in the main room. He bumped suggestively against Sherlock, hard. "You have to listen to
Sherlock squirmed at the tickle of John's seed running down his arse and thigh, and John released him, apologizing.
John swallowed thickly at the burst of sudden, thick arousal. He took a shuddering breath, thoughts swirling through his head- Sherlock bent over, his gorgeous arse on display while John spanked him, making the white globes glow red...John with his belt...John himself bent over while Sherlock purred everything he'd got wrong in his deductions and giving him a sharp slap each time he reminded John of his mistake.
..." John muttered feverishly, closing his eyes and trying to get control of himself but he'd reached the limit of his patience. He couldn't believe what Sherlock had done. Everything that day came tumbling back, raising his blood pressure and making the ringing in his ears worse.
“Follow me, there’s a good boy,” John uttered calmly, before picking up the new toy and striding unselfconsciously to their bedroom. There followed a substantial couple of actionless seconds, before Sherlock found his feet and hastened to accompany his doctor.
John swore before Sherlock tugged him into a kiss with too much teeth, painfully nipping on John's lips.
"I'd give my life for you." Sherlock answered truthfully, wondering where John was going with this, what bearing it had on their conversation-
"Because it makes me happy. That's what best friends do," John teased, heading back out and towards the kitchen. "I'm pouring you a drink."
Tuning out the rest of John's well-known and oft-recited speech, Sherlock glanced down to where John's smaller but undeniably strong fingers gripped his slim hips and he swallowed at the pressure which was being exerted on the ghosts of bruises which the same army doctor had created time after time in the past during less angry, but equally-heated encounters.
"Shut it, you." John giggled as he grabbed Sherlock and stumbled into the appointed closet. It was pitch black when the door closed and there was a moment of disorientation before Sherlock staggered against John and they groped at each other trying to find cocks and lips.
“I’m very amenable.” John winked, easing himself off Sherlock and standing, chuckling to himself at the twinge of his thigh muscles. He instinctively moved a fist to smear away the semen on his face, but paused. "Sherlock, would you like it if I kept it on?"
White-hot, sizzling sun was drenching the room, and John tilted his rickety monitor away from the most piercing rays, tutting irritably. Taking a swig from the scuffed, lukewarm bottle of water on his desk, he tried to focus on his computer screen once and for all and stop getting distracted by soft, mini-tornadoes of heated dust motes.
"Fuck...Sherlock..." His voice was high and breathy. The sound of it did things to Sherlock's own cock which bounced in time to his heartbeat.
"One of them though, seriously, I have to wonder how she got into the medical profession. Like, beautiful but completely... just empty," he shook his head, tapping his temple to accentuate his point.
He turned his head and huffed with laughter at the disgruntled grimace on the detective’s face at being seen as anything but a brain.
Sherlock marvelled silently at the sensation and weight of John's arm across his own bare, vulnerable body. He couldn't fathom how people could do this on a regular basis. "I suppose this takes time to get used to it." he pondered aloud, voice stiff with confusion.
"Well, I'm gonna make a brave start. Now that I'm here, I feel like a twat," John admitted, fiddling with his empty glass, watching it smear sticky puddles across the bar.
"Mmmm..." John purred, giving Sherlock his own cheeky grin which lit up his eyes and made his face look years younger. "Something I can have a lot of fun peeling you out of later."
They both inadvertently jerked as another brutal shock of deep, deafening thunder and startling blue lightning pervaded the flat.
"Need to what?" Sherlock asked innocently, a wicked, pleased gleam in his eyes as he watched John writhe, his painfully erect cock jumping above his stomach. "I must ask that you exercise a little...
"Mmm…according to what Sherlock told Elaine John's quite the firecracker in the sheets. Begging and writhing in blissful, homosexual ecstasy." Jason chuckled, eyes glinting maliciously.
Luke staggered away from the weapon he wasn't accustomed to, holding his hands above his head and muttering in supplication, eyes lowered.
He had to keep dialling the number- the amount of missed calls on John's mobile increasing rapidly- and still Sherlock could find no release. Even after many minutes, focussed as hard as he could on pursuing his dormant orgasm, which he could sense was going to be particularly powerful, there was no luck. Even replacing his two fingers inside himself and rather vigorously fucking himself didn't quite do the job.
John, taking his hand away, delivered a few more well-aimed smacks to Sherlock's arse and Sherlock jolted with each one, moaning unabashedly, his hips jumping back as if encouraging John for more.
"You can, you know. It's you, Sherlock. Just you. Always you." He vowed fervently, and then grinned. "Now, are you ready for me to fuck you? "
"You should have said something." Sherlock attempted jokily, smiling, the twinkle in his eyes almost visible in the gloom.
"Yeah, well it would. And you're making it worse storming around throwing a tantrum like a three year old. Sit down. Your body needs rest, not...whatever it is you're doing to it." John sat in his chair, levelling a stern look at the seething man across the room from him. "This is why I said you couldn't take the case-"
John, averting his eyes self-consciously, was suddenly brought back into Sherlock's line of sight with infinitely-talented, yet shakily-shy fingers gripping his cheeks. Striking eyes peered quizzically at him, brows crumpled uncertainly. "Ten
The detective groaned out a faint little noise when John's feather-light touch skimmed his bare testicles, weighing them carefully in his knowledgeable palm.
"I understand if you don't accept it. If you don't want to hear it. But I won't take it back, because it's the truth, and fuck knows I'm sick and tired of keeping it to myself, and sick and tired of not letting you know how much you mean to me."
"Shaun...what are you hoping for?" he asked in a deceptively calm tone, his face passive. "Just John? A threesome, perhaps?"
John's head went back, teeth gritted hard enough to hurt his jaw, and he yowled, coughing out high-pitched sobs, and fucking into Sherlock hard enough to bruise both of them while he blessedly, finally climaxed.
-" He broke off, body straining to the slickened strokes of his own hand. "...I...I've never been inside anyone...but...I want to..." Sherlock grimaced, tugging at himself even more harshly, his fist a silken blur beneath his pyjamas. "Oh...
"I need to get to bed." Sherlock whispered, his pale, dilated eyes flicking over John's shoulder to the lumpy hotel bed. His slim hips pumped unconsciously, needily, against John's steady hand.
"As if you need it. You've probably got about four blokes on the go," John muttered, trying not to let Shaun get to him - he had been having a really good time and didn’t want to spoil his mood. He nodded gratefully as Bill came back with a fresh tray of shots, and grabbed one possessively. He tried to pay attention to the others as they carried on gossiping the way only grown men can.
John stilled, and stared at the petulant detective who now huddled childishly on the sofa, glaring intently at his phone.
"I'd never get bored of you." Sherlock admitted quietly as John threaded their fingers together. "...So...you agree to stay with me, here, in the flat with stomach-churning specimens, pineapples, and tenuous sexual endeavours?"
John frowned, glancing around the empty flat. Sherlock had been gone all day yesterday. All night last night. And there was still no sign of him this morning. John wasn't exactly worried. Sherlock sometimes forgot himself when he was working on an experiment at Bart's, or maybe he was down by the river looking at mud under his magnifying glass. He'd probably forgotten about the time.
The bubbling bitter brew ran down John’s parched throat, leaving an icy trail to his lungs that hit a spot inside him to make him groan gratefully. He set the cold glass on the bar before licking his lips, turning to Lestrade who was watching him with a small grin.
squash, anyway? Tennis for people who had no friends? Sherlock sighed, absently watching the squash players shaking hands, glaring when the camera cut to one of their girlfriends in the stands, pretty and blonde, applauding her boyfriend and beaming proudly.
"...Fine, John." Sherlock got up with a slight, pained exhale, and picked up his discarded sheet, flinging it over his shoulder and wandering in the direction of the bathroom.
Sherlock snuggled closer to John, sealing their bodies warmly together, and sighed contentedly. He was tired. Exhausted. He felt that, for once, he could immediately drift off to sleep.
He still had hope that Shaun loved him back. He rather thought he did. They spent a lot of time together and Shaun seemed to like him. It didn't sit well with John to think that all Shaun thought of him was as a useful cock.
when he was nude. It made Sherlock hate John's ugly jumpers even more, that they covered up such beauty.
John shivered, teeth bared and his lined face squeezed into a picture of agony. "Sherlock...god...Fucking kiss me!" John practically screamed, frightening Sherlock into stillness and silence for a few seconds. He quickly obeyed, falling on John like a wild thing and pressing their lips together, inadvertently grinding his cock against John's prostate. John jerked, screaming against Sherlock's lips as he came. Sherlock struggled valiantly against John's body, which bucked and twisted sharply, loosening Sherlock's station within his lover, his shaft slipping free with the most modest of slippery sounds. He hissed in pain as John's right hand seized a prize of his sweat-damp hair, yanking thoughtlessly as he howled out what appeared to be a terrific orgasm.
," John grimaced. "New rule...no talking about your brother in the bedroom." He grasped Sherlock's swollen pink shaft and weighed it, feeling it twitch. "You could do some damage with this."
Sherlock sucked in a sharp, excited breath and reached down, squeezing his firming cock through his pyjamas. Instead of getting angry, would John maybe smile? Give Sherlock a lazy, seductive grin and pull back the covers, invite Sherlock into bed with him? Would he kiss Sherlock- not the chaste pecks Sherlock was already addicted to- but kiss him
." Sherlock's cock bottomed out and he held his position, frozen, for a few seconds before slowly withdrawing. John hissed, spine bowing at the pleasurable burn and friction. "Does it feel good?" Sherlock asked as he attempted a few, deep thrusts, clearly inexperienced and awkward in his movements. John nodded, fisting himself quicker.
"Yes, he's very amazing. He has so many talents. You can tell John's an ex-soldier - he can throw me down - and hold me down, too - with practically no effort. He has
Passing the ancient archway of the main building, John felt that he was the only one in attendance who actually paused to appreciate, however briefly, the beautiful architecture and history of the manor.
"No. That's…no, I can." He took a shuddering breath, still slightly confused and disappointed. He'd thought…well. Never mind. "...I can try that."
"Sherl...sweetheart, stop thinking. Just for a second. I don't care who..." he tapped a gentle finger pointedly against Sherlock's temple, "...'in there' is telling you that you're losing me. Don't listen to them."
His fellow employees exchanged worried, uneasy looks. Jason ruffled a hand through his gelled spikes and grinned.
"Sherlock." John's low voice broke in and Sherlock faltered in his rapid-fire deductions. He blinked, taking in John's shuttered, angry face and Molly's flushed cheeks and shamed, averted eyes.
John was glad, later that night as he reclined on his thin, hard bunk, that none of the other twenty men in the same barracks were snorers. It would've distracted him from picking apart the details of his encounter earlier which been plaguing him all day.
Greg noticed his gaze, and mirrored it, a bit hazily. "Yeah, looking a bit dire, isn't it. Have you got to get back yet? If not, I was fixing a curry tonight. Spicy as fuck if you like that sort of thing."
. Heat. Wetness. Pressure. Sherlock's hips made tiny, abortive little thrusts into John's mouth and John, for the most part, let him and- oh god. He was going to come. Sherlock could feel it, tingling at the base of his cock, surging through his testicles-
“By ‘terrible,’ I assume you mean, ‘brilliant and irresistible,” John whispered coarsely against the pillow. His voice deepened exponentially as he continued to soothe the detective, who was clearly on edge. John didn’t need to hear his stuttered, self-conscious breaths or see the bone-white knuckles tighten sharply around a wet, darkened shaft. He could read it like braille in every telling twitch of Sherlock’s firm thigh muscles, a delicious personal code that he could translate down to the minutest, silent utterance of pleasure.
Jason blinked rapidly, visibly angry and stunned his face suffused with colour, lips thinned down and white. When he spoke, it was through tightly gritted teeth. "You...you fucking...you fucking don't know
"I..." Sherlock blinked wetly up at the ceiling as he struggled to find the words. "I...t-treated you badly when we got ba-back to the f-flat. Said more things...I shouldn't have. It was wrong. I was wrong. Oh-
"Not much to talk through." He said breathlessly, eyes closing as he circled his hips slowly. "Just...keep your legs tight together...Ahhh..
"Please what? Is this what you want, Sherlock?" John asked again, ducking his head to nip and tug at Sherlock's earlobe. "Because if it is...I'd let you. I'd let you
He held the scalding tea to one side for a second, and abruptly gave John a gentle kiss. "We did...it.” He informed John, as if conferring a naughty secret.
–" Sherlock started tetchily…but trailed off as his eyes, widening in shock, took in John's suddenly naked body.
Eyeing John's innocent, annoyingly-kissable face with a calculating pout, he cleared his throat. "Actually, you can help me with something." He abruptly opened the heavy bolted doors in a corner, leading out into a grimy, half-lit alley full of skips , bashed-up cardboard boxes, and bits of plastic wrapping. He opened the chilled lid of a discoloured green skip, and made a pondering noise as he examined the contents. "Ah yes, here we go," he announced calmly, before reaching gently into the container. Cradling something in his large hands, he half-turned towards John. "Evidence. Put it somewhere safe." he said noncommittally.
out, taking with it a gushing, shocking prize of hot blood. He stared down at himself in shock, rapidly becoming numb to what was going on around him- the young men running away, the angry shouts of the police, someone screaming.
"I think that means they're technologically incompetent," Sherlock said, reading every message as John scrolled down the page. Some of them were like John said- ridiculous and narrow-minded. People shouting things about how disgusting they were to have publicly came out as homosexuals. Sherlock easily dismissed them.
hurts, John," Sherlock seethed, losing his mind at the sensation of bruises on his thighs, arms and torso, the stinging cuts on his face, wrists, and ankles.
Sherlock cleared his throat, and read from the grease-stained scrap of paper. He squinted a little at the small font. " 'If we're going to be together I'm going to set some PROPER ground rules. BTW I don't know what I'd do without you.' "
"Um. Uh...y-yeah. Sure, sweetheart." John said, heart suddenly thrumming in his chest. "Whatever you want."
Sherlock didn't meet his eyes, but hesitantly raised his voice. "Maybe we can try, you know. Me on the...you know...you on top," he muttered.
.” Sherlock glanced at him and shuddered with a rolling lift of his hips, moving to hold onto any part of John that he could reach.
"What, specifically, are you sorry for?" John asked, gently tugging Sherlock's hand away from his cock and holding Sherlock's arms at his sides as he lowered his head and gave Sherlock's cock a quick, teasing lick. "Tell me, Sherlock."
"Life would be simple if my 'fancies' extended merely to breaking into your fridge, Mrs. Hudson. I have an emergency. It requires maternal advice."
He was also reasonably sure that if he managed to persuade John to engage in some light bondage, then he might find less resistance. The doctor seemed to be irritatingly-conscious of his secret plan though, and 'kinky stuff' had been relegated to the ambiguous, hazy timeline too.
Jason's eyes comically widened and he physically rocked back on his heels, his cheeks flushing as he looked from Sherlock to John. "What...what the fuck are you talking about? I'm not gay."
Sherlock's eyes narrowed. He didn't need John to point out how appealing she was. He could see it for himself. It was rude besides, for John to be ogling her in such a fashion. They were together now. Did John...did John want her? Sherlock swallowed thickly against the well of jealousy.
John didn't know his name, but he put aside his own gun and pressed a firm hand upon the shoulder of the hyper-ventilating recruit. "Get a hold of yourself!” he demanded, as loud as he could above the terrifying cracks and pops of bullet impacts nearby.
Before John could reply, a generous slick of pleasantly-cool oil was drizzled upon his shoulder-blades and the length of his spine, and his detective wasted no time in getting to work.
"What do you want?" He asked, making sure to keep his voice low in case people happened to walk by. It was thrilling, doing this where they could get caught, and it added to the atmosphere.
Sherlock scrambled to the side and snatched up the lube, excited. "I want to see if I can milk you." He stated. John's eyes went wide.
with you. I just thought...well you were asleep and I didn't want to bother you. You always get stroppy first thing in the morning-"
"I'm not giving up until we've both had fucking spectacular orgasms." John declared, scooting closer to Sherlock and pressing their lips together again. "We just need to rethink what we're doing. You're good at that."
have," John added, chewing on his bottom lip anxiously, convinced he had tarnished Sherlock in some invisible, unspeakable way.
"He's been living under my roof the past few months- I think I know a good deal about him." Mrs. Hudson protested, crossing her arms. "Now. What is this about, Sherlock?"
John politely rubbed his back and waited for him to get his breath back, smiling clownishly to himself.
John ignored him, sitting on the mattress and rubbing at his calf, which had decided to start to twinge. "What are you writing?" he asked again.
"I want to suck you while I...open you." The words were almost stuck in his throat and Sherlock flushed at saying something so filthy and graphic. John nodded enthusiastically, a clownish grin brightening his previously tear-stained face, hardly averse to the idea. He nibbled the inside of his mouth indulgently as he watched the totally naked, flawed yet flawless detective make his way down his body, peppering it with little kisses. The interlude was interrupted when Sherlock grimaced and leveraged himself off the bed without a word, dashing across the room with an impressive erection bobbing between his thighs, and rooted around in their bags for the lubricant. He returned, triumphant, flushed, and still aroused, and knelt between John's legs.
"You sound disappointed," Lestrade said tiredly. "I haven't got time for dramatics, Sherlock, if you can give me anything, do it quickly. This woman's a fucking Peer of the Realm and my superiors are breathing down my neck to get this wrapped up and solved."
Sherlock's eyes flicked around John's face, trying to pick up clues as to how he was supposed to follow through with that suggestion. What would that entail? What did John expect? What did he himself expect? Sherlock finally reached the conclusion that they should probably both be naked and plucked at his clothes, tossing them to the side before devoting himself to gently removing John's towel and helping him slide backward on the bed, resting his head against the pillows.
"Sherlock, I can't do that. My friends...and-" he halted, briefly, but tellingly. "No, I can't. Do you want to introduce yourself as a slut? Because that's what it'll look like if you choose to go out there covered in come. Let me...prove you're mine in a more conventional way, okay?"
“Why do we have sand in the kitchen?” John asked, packing away his kit efficiently, already anticipating and preparing himself for the sarcastic response.
His fingers shook as he reached out and took the rose from John, plucking it from his fingers and staring at it as if he'd never seen one properly before.
, Sherlock - calm down and shut up for a second," John tutted, though he acquiesced and eased off Sherlock's lap to sit beside him, one hand on his warm thigh. "
"I...I don't know exactly," Molly said, and Sherlock could tell she was gnawing on her thumb as she hesitantly continued. "I just...I just wanted to let you know, I didn't think...well..."
!" John frantically reached for his abandoned cock, quickly jacking himself through the rest of his almost-ruined orgasm, gasping as the last shocks rippled through his body. "Oh...Jesus..." He blinked his eyes open to find Sherlock staring at him, his cheek smeared with a bit of come and pale eyes widened almost comically, lips parted in shock.
Without his consent, John's brain insisted on furnishing his mind's eye with colourful memories of Shaun, and their time together, in super-high definition and surround sound. Wincing unconsciously into the fervent kiss, he guiltily allowed a few of them to play out in full.
"Ah, god." John moaned, head falling back- before he hissed, the movement pulling on his wound and making pain flare up again. He brought his head forward, watching as Sherlock glanced up at him, concern brightening his eyes and chasing away the lust of before. "I'm fine." John whispered, caressing Sherlock's head. He winced as his injured arm twinged and he swallowed down a grunt of pain. He distracted himself by fingering Sherlock’s glossy curls with his good hand, pulling at them hard enough to make Sherlock’s eyelids flutter.
"Sh-Sherlock." John gently disengaged him from his cock, running his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "You really don't have to do that. I was...being ridiculous. Stupid. That was too forceful."
“Anyway, those things cost a fortune,” John said airily, scrolling through his emails. “You might be flip with your money but you’d be more likely to, I dunno, borrow someone else’s. You’d be too lazy to set it up yourself, and you wouldn’t ask me to do it.”
And suddenly, that seemed like the best idea John had had since he'd decided he loved Sherlock and wanted to spend the rest of his life with him.
"Of course." John said, hastening to get him some, clattering things around in the kitchen. "Maybe you can eat some biscuits too? Sugar would be good for you. Keep you from going into shock."
"Spare me your drunken platitudes." He said as soon as he sensed John's footsteps entering the living room. If they were going to fight, it was best to start off being prickly and mean instead of soft and embarrassed.
"No." Sherlock lied. "I...hardly notice it. It's just my body, John. It's become used to regular orgasms, for the release. But I'm in control of myself. I...am perfectly fine."
"Yeah but...you didn't tell me you had one-" John grimaced as the tarantula stirred in his hand, sluggishly tapping its legs on his hand.
There was a slam as the front door opened and closed, and John's determined steps powered up the steps to 221B. Sherlock paled and his eyes darted pleadingly to Mrs. Hudson.
“But I-“ John had started speaking before his brain could catch up with this unsurprising revelation.  “Oh……are you sure?” He asked awkwardly, before wincing at the idiocy of the question.
"You've been thinking about it," John chuckled, biting gently under Shaun's ear. He wanted to say it again, he really did. He had offered it, without response, a handful of times since the first instance that he had declared his feelings. He had soon realised that it was best to avoid enunciating the taboo words, for the sake of his own sanity.
“For anything. – Schedules you need to make or keep, things you need to remember, notes you wish to take, evidence you want to document, private cases you want to write…I know you prefer the old fashioned way. You aren’t so keen, or conversant, when it comes to computers and keyboards. You type horrendously slow, but write incredibly swift and proficient,” Sherlock told him and tilted his head, peering into his face with a hopeful expression and a grin of his own.
John cursed and strode over to the sofa, snatching the laptop out of Sherlock's hands, his face a black thundercloud. "Because it's
minute,” John flared, sitting up quickly and meeting Sherlock’s eyes with a challenging fire. He was briefly gratified to see Sherlock recoil back a little, looking cautious. “Who says I don’t love you? And how on
“It’s been seven months. Not ten. You’re exaggerating. As usual,” Sherlock said with a rumbling voice, still sounding somewhat entertained by their conversation. “Interesting to know that your heterosexuality goes out the window after seven months though. Very interesting.”
John stared openly at the flustered pink-faced detective in front of him, his exponentially-increasing discomfort. “Wow. I  - God-”
"Ta, Sherlock." John replied sarcastically, pulling himself out with relief and giving himself a few quick strokes.
Sherlock worried a little when John pulled back after a second, but gave a silly grin when the smaller man murmured against his plump lips, "I love you."
John moved into the living room, grabbing his leather jacket from the back of the chair and pulling it on as he heard a chime from his pocket. He pulled out his phone and let out a small sigh of relief.
"Thought you might have done." John said, nudging at Sherlock until he had room to lay down and spending the next few minutes instructing a blushing, nervous Sherlock into position: on his hands and knees above John's body, his head hovering over John's cock and his own dangling enticingly over John's face. Sherlock was thoroughly humiliated by the position. He was also incredibly turned on by it.
John flexed his hips forward, easing himself inside. They both gasped when the head of his cock popped past the first ring of muscles and Sherlock's grip on his cock tightened. It looked as if he were trying to choke it.
A grating howl tore itself from Sherlock's throat as he shuddered through his climax, his teeth gritted and eyes squinched shut, pumping ejaculate into the warm, wet, tight receptacle that encompassed him. John tried to swallow as much as he could, his abused throat working frantically, but couldn't get it all. He choked, coughing around Sherlock's still twitching penis, eyes watering as he struggled to breathe. He heaved his body up, thrashing, and Sherlock mistook the movement as John wanting him to resume sucking his cock, which he fell on with lazy gusto now that his own orgasm was through.
John chuckled warmly, setting the skunk aside before getting up and going to kneel on the floor beside the sofa, cupping Sherlock's sculptured, hard cheekbones and kissing him on the tip of his nose. Keith trotted away, out of sight, into their bedroom.
John was surprised when Shaun plopped down in the seat beside him that night in the mess tent. The dull roar of talking and laughter surging all around him had been background noise to the bang and clatter of his own thoughts. Now, the object of his musings grinned at him, snagging a piece of chicken from his plate, and wiggling his eyebrows.
Sherlock obliged, and his pale face eased and crinkled delightfully in an honest grin when John gritted his teeth and squirmed against the bed, hips grinding, and his hands scratching the vaguest of troughs in the thin mattress. Sherlock worked methodically, his fingers stretched and scissoring, brow furrowed as he watched himself work, forgetting his promise to suck John while he did it and John, moaning, didn't want to break Sherlock's rhythm by reminding him. If he did, it was entirely possible that Sherlock would lose his train of thought and mess it up. He wanted to give Sherlock confidence in himself. Besides, being the center of Sherlock’s focus, having his fingers manipulating inside him, was almost as good as being sucked off. Almost. He could see where Sherlock was hard between his thighs and was faintly surprised at Sherlock's self-control.
After a few more exasperating minutes, Sherlock shuddered in utter frustration and reluctantly gave up his efforts. With shaky, wet fingers, heaving for breath and sweating profusely, he abandoned the insufficient mobile and dialled the number of the reception of the surgery that John worked at.
“First of all- John, I need you to confirm that her acupuncture treatment in this spa was in fact the last treatment she had before she died, and also that she had never received that particular treatment before. She comes here for relaxation and pampering, as opposed to actively seeking respite from any chronic pain or other physiological problems. The actual cause of death was asphyxiation, however there are no signs of manual strangulation, no evidence of water in the lungs, no bruising on her face which would suggest a pillow held over her face, and she was found relatively-peacefully after the acupuncturist completed the therapy. He left her alone for half an hour to rest. The causation was clearly chemical, then.”
"I heard you orgasm last night," Sherlock explained, "just after John had gone down on me, and I had fingered him to climax. Well...I say '
He was rudely interrupted as Sherlock stiffened as though in pain and stung him with a frigid glare, a long finger pressing abruptly against his thin lips.
He ruffled his hair the way John did when he couldn't resist just plunging his hand into his curls and rummaging. His doctor mostly did it first thing in the morning, and as soon as he came in from work. Or indeed, any time where John presumably considered that their time apart had just been too long for comfort.
John sighed. "I wouldn't care if you lasted two seconds or two hours, love. Just so long as you're letting me shag you, I'm happy.”
"I'm sure you speak from experience." John muttered, unpacking his meagre belongings and spreading them on the bed…before he flung his bag against the wall, his temper simmering dangerously.
He eased back the door, one wet hand cupping himself self-consciously, as if he was trying to avoid making a mess on the floor. To be honest, it wasn't entirely an act - Sherlock had been edging himself repeatedly, relentlessly, and had produced an almost unsurpassed amount of pre-come.
"Well. I'll just...shall I?" Sherlock gestured at the towel and John grinned, letting him carefully remove it and place it to the side. John's cock, half hard in anticipation, flexed at the sudden rush of air and Sherlock sat back on his heels, watching, extending one finger to give the organ a speculative tap.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed as he watched John stroll into their sitting room, mobile pressed to his ear.
John picked up the pace, slamming his cock into Sherlock as much as he was able, the slick slap of his hips hitting Sherlock's skin loud and obscene and Sherlock's breath hitched again and again with every thrust. He set his teeth in a snarl, feeling sweat beading at his forehead, and his heart leaped in his chest as he pounded into his lover.
John used the glare of his phone screen to search his table for the glass of water he had left there earlier in the evening. It was nowhere to be seen. He was unsure whether he felt surprised by this or not. He definitely felt angry. Clearly Sherlock had taken it.
He moaned as he came, hips pumping up, pushing Shaun's cock deeper into his arse. It was nothing like coming on his own. This was bone deep, sharp pleasure that was suddenly too much. John hissed from oversensitivity as Shaun started a series of quick, desperate thrusts, grunting, chasing after his own orgasm with selfish determination.
The detective’s eyes sped very briefly over his doctor’s naked body, pupils dilating and eyelids flickering slightly, before he cleared his throat and spoke in a deep voice made of honey and gravel.
Then, John had caught a glimpse of Patricia, one of the regular nurses, as his office door swung closed behind one of his patients. She'd been wide-eyed, positively craning her neck to get a look at John as if he were an attraction in a zoo.
"...You can...what do you mean, 'bruises?' You're just kissing me hard. I don't quite...understand." Sherlock admitted, groaning as John bit gently at his right pectoral. John hummed, coming back to kiss Sherlock, biting at his bottom lip and drinking in Sherlock's pained little grunt.
Molly shivered at the soft, deep exclamation which could have only come from one of the men in the next room. Ears straining, she heard a gasp and quickly sat up, scrabbling in her bedside drawer for her vibrator. Settling back breathlessly, elbowing her cuddly toy out of the way, she circled the toy around her clitoris, spreading her wetness around the tip, before penetrating herself slowly but firmly with the bulbous rubber shaft, the fingers of her right hand tapping and nudging teasingly over her sensitive little nodule. She shuddered, spine arching a bit at the delicious intrusion.
." Sherlock smiled and Chaucer laughed. "If you're buying it for the reason I think…" He lowered his voice, leaning closer to Sherlock. "You may want to purchase a bigger size…to make room for obvious growth. They're not as...accommodating as your usual cotton." He added with a knowing wink and a lascivious glance at Sherlock's groin.
was the way of it, was it? John enjoyed the view, biting his lip, before throwing off the covers and hurrying to the shower. He washed quickly, not taking the usual time he would to leisurely soap his genitals and maybe wank. It was worth it when he came out of the loo and saw Sherlock peeking around the door to the sitting room, wide eyes taking in John's body and widening when he found that John hadn't got himself off yet.
John froze, more in naive surprise than discomfort, at the sensation of male hips rutting against him, solid and needy and hot. His own abated erection surged back to wakefulness, having become soft and quiescent after some minutes in the previously-platonic snuggle.
Not bothering to say anything, anticipating a stubborn acknowledgement of perfect health, John grabbed Sherlock’s surprisingly cool hand, and immediately caught sight of the angry-looking, but uninfected scalpel cut on his palm.
John gave a startled laugh, checking to see that yes, Sherlock had been completely serious, and shook his head. "We'll see."
That was the best thing Sherlock had heard John say in seven days. He seized John's smaller hand greedily and dragged him forcibly to the sofa. "Spread me, take me," he murmured, lying down on the sofa and staring up at John expectantly.
Sherlock didn't respond. He took a deep breath, eyes wide, blinking at John in total surprise. It appeared his brain was having a malfunction. John stroked his hair, trying to soothe him, and Sherlock's eyes narrowed.
Greg used his pint to stop his mouth from speaking, trying to keep his attention on his friend's problem rather than imagining the stoic Sherlock Holmes...horny.
"Mmh...it's good to finally look at you," John admitted dizzily, fondling Sherlock's shaft for a second or two before frowning at its softness. "Sorry, I thought you were...you know..."
Sighing, but not ready to give up, he changed tack, thumbing through his phone for a slightly different kind of favour.
worked. Nor has gentle persuasion, aggressive persuasion, begging... I fear I'm running out of options."
John swallowed, his throat dry and sore. Blearily, he sat up, kicking away the unpleasantly-hot duvet from his chest and leaning back against the cool headboard. Rubbing his eyes and ruffling his hair, he listened vaguely to Sherlock perform his ablutions whilst he himself slowly entered the land of the living. He glanced down thoughtfully at his covered lap, his left hand slowly, comfortingly taking hold of himself and stroking slightly.
, if all goes well," John laughed, slowly retracting his numb and wrinkled fingers, subtly wiping them on the crisp white bed sheets, and then pausing. "What position would you like? On all fours?"
“Then I won’t do it again. Come on, you,” John announced, still holding Sherlock’s injured hand gently, tugging him away from the flat.
And then he was coming- shouting at the top of his lungs - thick spurts of come erupting from his cock to land on his chest, his face, even making it as far as his hair before the pressure eased, his cock still twitching wildly as pulses of come flooded out.
John gently and reluctantly shook his dozing detective until the sweat-drenched, come-covered, and slightly bloodied brunette stirred dazedly. Sherlock groaned and, grabbing onto John's arms to keep him from moving away, attempted to burrow his head further into John's chest.
“Still waiting,” John whispered tantalisingly, breaking Sherlock’s brief reverie, and the detective abruptly picked at the fiddly plastic wrap securing the lid of the bottle with short fingernails. Swearing quietly, he ended up tearing at the stiff sheath with his teeth, spitting out the remnants, and mounting John’s naked backside carefully.
John was shattered, heaving for breath, and lay prone, unaware of his own ejaculate on his face and ruined hair. He let Sherlock lean over him, reeking of sweat and heat and sex, feeling the detective kiss and suck at his scalp and jaw hungrily. The doctor could feel his own thighs and stomach quivering faintly with exertion, and he let out an immense, shaky sigh.
He had great hopes for this day in particular - being an 'anniversary' of sorts (and having been the one to impregnate John with the idea that it was a vastly important one), and knowing that his flatmate was sentimental about such things.
John fidgeted under his stare and opened his mouth- but just as quickly shut it, knowing he'd only say something and give it all away.
John moaned, pressing against him, thrusting his hard cock a few times against Sherlock's sinfully plush arse. He nipped at his neck, wanting to leave a visible, unambiguous mark.
"Come on." He offered Sherlock his hand, helping him into the shower and easing him into the spray of water. "Tip your head back, I'll wash your hair."
do like to fictitiously exaggerate the most smallest of things.” He pushed his fingers through John’s hair, dragging his nails across his scalp. “I don’t set up secret bloody hidden cameras. You’re mistaking me for someone else. Someone pompous and horridly frustrating, who carries an umbrella.”
"There's sometimes nothing else on late at night." Warm lips sucked and nipped at the column of Sherlock's throat. "God,
.” Sherlock shuddered with a barely stifled gasp of pleasure, wetting John’s fingers with another bloom of obvious interest, and shifted up a little on his forearms. Peeking back, Sherlock gave him a wonky smile, the muscles in his back flexing and rippling as he pushed the coiled, sweaty curls from his temples.
He hissed frustratedly at this surprising mental sentiment, and groaned with all the melodrama of the hammy actor he was born to be, if the consulting detective thing didn’t work out. At least, that what John had told him once.
Sherlock half-grinned but John could see residual paranoia in his tense features. He wanted to thumb away the moisture on his face - the sweat glistening beautifully on his flushed cheekbones, and in the sweet dent of his cupid's-bow upper lip. He knew however, that Sherlock would freak out when he realised John was actually trying to erase the visible wetness around his eyes. So instead he kissed him, reassuring Sherlock through wordless gestures and the gentle skid of his hands against his skin how beautiful he thought he was. The point was driven home, though, when John rocked his own erection, forgotten about in the heat of pleasuring Sherlock, against Sherlock's hip, moaning.
"What?" John asked, his seduction derailed, hands pausing with the towel over his chest where he'd been needlessly rubbing at his nipples.
John laughed too, before raising his head and pulling Sherlock into a wet, passionate kiss. Sherlock eagerly reciprocated until John pulled away, giving him a vulnerable and yet scorching look.
"I-" Sherlock broke off when John leaned forward, rubbing at his trapped erection teasingly. Sherlock shuddered, closing his eyes as John indulgently mouthed at his ever-hardening shaft like a hungry puppy at a teat. His hands gripped John's shoulders, in a schizophrenic display of both trying to restrain him and wanting to pull him forward.
"It won't be for a few weeks." Shaun said softly. "This," He nodded to John's leg. "This isn't going away. And...I'm not cut out to be your nurse the rest of my life…And," Shaun added, "I've never...
"Just shut the fuck up, Watson, and fuck me the way I goddamn want." Shaun commanded breathlessly and John, gripping the base of the condom, held his breath and pushed inside, ready to stop at any second when it got too painful for Shaun.
Shaun was panting, chest heaving, and he spared John a half-smile, chuckling when he caught him staring. "That was incredible. Come on, then. Your turn."
“What are we doing here?” Sherlock asked suddenly, glancing up at the bustling Bridge as though he hadn’t really registered its hulking yet classical presence before. The furrow between his eyebrows deepened incredulously as it occurred to him that the muted blue accents of the Bridge matched that of the shirt that John was wearing at the moment, which was crisp and new and not quite yet imbued with the synaesthesic scent of warm tea and cheerful middle-of-the-range musk.
The hotel was grotty, in an unfashionable part of the city. Sherlock took a sick pleasure in informing John- after he'd vetoed every place Sherlock had suggested as too expensive- that no less than three murders had been committed in John's chosen hotel, one on the very floor their room was situated on.
. He keeps going on about having these new experiences with me that he's never known before. When they run out, I don't see what more he'd need from me. In
Sherlock obediently rolled over, letting John grasp at his arms and shoulders when the movement almost made him fall off the bed, and tugged the smaller man closer to him. John let himself be pulled against Sherlock's chest and quickly attacked his detective's plump, heart-shaped lips with a powerful kiss, a faint groan stuttering hungrily in the darkness. John groped gently between Sherlock's legs and when his fingers closed around Sherlock's cock, it was John's turn to groan into their kiss. Sherlock was already hard- had obviously been laying with John and thinking about what they were going to do and that...was
" John shouted, turning to fumble with the taps and turn the water off, brushing past Sherlock to get his towel, "I was just having a wank, Sherlock. It's what every male does when they want to let off a little stress. When they just want to get off quick. You don't have to be present for every single one of my fucking orgasms."
In one quick movement, John punched the crook of Shaun’s elbow, shoved his unwanted hand away, and rather shockingly, undid a few buttons of own his shirt and yanked down the left shoulder, exposing the raw, red, damp scar from his recent knife wound. "Remind you of anything?!"
"I wish to..." Sherlock searched for the right phrase- then remembered John wanted him to use his own words. "I want to pleasure you manually as well and I believe the best position for that would be you lying down on the sofa." He tried to keep his voice firm and in-control, as if he knew what he were doing, and, from the way John's eyes went dark and his mouth went all pursed, Sherlock thought he achieved it.
“COME IN!” Sherlock yelled at an unnecessarily deafening volume, before curling himself up on the sofa and snuggling the cushion against his crotch, smirking indulgently. John tutted and double-checked his attire as their landlady opened and peeked through their door with a sweet grin.
With a puff of laughter, Sherlock coyly glanced away and then shifted closer, leaning in to kiss John’s cheek, and then his jaw, breathing in against his skin, “There’d be a
John, though, pulled away and reached for the lube he knew Sherlock kept hidden in the bread box. He unclicked the cap as he reached between Sherlock's arsecheeks-
Happy Valentine's Day to all you lovely, lovely people! We hope you enjoy our present to you- an early posting of our story. Enjoy! :D
Sherlock was squirming as subtly as he could on his seat at the scarred, wobbly table made sticky by years of ineffectual wipe-downs with a damp dishcloth. It had been an hour and a half since his and John's little rendezvous, and after acknowledging with some shock that he had ended up staying in the toilet for nearly twelve minutes to reduce suspicion, he was reluctant to make his way back there again.
," John added fiendishly, avoiding Sherlock's tender prostate but maintaining a tiny thrusting rhythm with his finger, keeping him open.
"Please...John..." Sherlock gasped, fisting his cock slowly. It wasn't enough. He needed more. "I need batteries."
"Oh, god, yes." John scrambled up Sherlock's body, letting Sherlock wrap his fingers around his erection and start stroking, even though his hands were trembling.
"Unreasonable? When the man knows how big your prick is and drops hints about how thick you are...I don't think that's unreasonable." John halted and rounded on Sherlock. They were at the entrance of a lusciously green park, with multitudes of thick, healthy trees, beds of flowers which made the term 'rainbow' seem redundant, and a small lake inhabited by over-fed waterfowl.
Sherlock opened bleary eyes late the next morning, fumbling into semi-awareness in the cool, bright morning sunshine from the trippy series of dreams he had (sort-of) awoken from. John was kissing his cheekbone, murmuring comfortingly.
"You still...you've still pissed me off," Sherlock uttered a little tremulously, eagerly stepping forward, his dormant, righteous anger currently being swamped by utter desire.
John was always there. Looking handsome. Stretching and groaning as his muscles pulled. Throwing Sherlock dirty looks. Licking his lips. Reminding Sherlock of all he could have if only he hadn’t been so rash and started this stupid bet.
can't we?" He asked, grimacing with irritation. "Your...your women- I'm not some...virgin who's going to shatter." He spat angrily. John pulled even further away, frowning.
"You are! Maybe not in a classic sense. In the way the rest of society thinks of and defines beauty. Your nose is too big. And you have grey hair. And there are lines and wrinkles on your face. But," He desperately said, watching John's smile melt away, "I think you're...you're the most gorgeous, stunning man I've ever met."
Shaun licked his lips, staring at Sherlock before his eyes strayed to John. "Maybe I was a bit wrong about your boyfriend, John. Seems like he's just as freaky as you used to be."
Sherlock choked and squeezed his eyes tightly shut, invigorating his right wrist into reckless, blurry action, his arm muscles rapidly beginning to ache with the fruitless, manic exertion. "John!" he beseeched desperately, his hips jerking, his face contorting, teeth gritting needily.
John opened his eyes, looking down to where Sherlock was on his knees, eyes gazing up trustingly at John, mouth slack around his cock even as he choked on it.
John panted, his face wrinkled with the exertion of multiple orgasms, his thin lips parted to suck in the cool, home-tasting air of the bedroom, and his bare, damp chest heaving.
"Is that what we are?" All the lovely, lazy lassitude was gone from Sherlock's face, leaving behind a fragile sharpness that made John regret ever bringing it up. "Are we just...just...fuck buddies? Someone you can have a quick one-off with and not worry about entanglements?"
Looking a bit like a fish out of water, Sherlock shrugged off his dressing gown and made his way closer to John who smirked and pressed something on the CD player to make the 'sex song' play on repeat. He turned the volume up a fair bit too, as the rainstorm became almost deafening, battering the windows and hissing against the walls of the flat.
There was no dimmer switch, and John seemed adamant. Sherlock winced and his eyes slid shut reluctantly. "John, just...don't say anything. Okay? Not a thing." He muttered, taking a deep breath and, steeling his resolve, picking open his shirt, dropping the sumptuous material to the sparse carpet, before undoing his trousers, letting them fall, biting the inside of his mouth. Sherlock tried to pretend he was alone, that John wasn't sitting just feet from him on the bed, an expectant look on his face as he watched Sherlock undress.
He frowned when his surroundings were unfamiliar- until he remembered where he was, and why...and why he was alone. Sherlock shrank back onto the lilo, the heavy feeling which had evaporated when his needy body had slipped into sleep descending onto his chest again. It crowded up through his throat and choked him. He never wanted to leave the lilo again after such an embarrassing incident. He should have known better than to do that earlier- thrusting into John's mouth as if he had no self-control and coming down his throat- without even telling John. He was lucky John wasn't seriously injured. He could have been.
“Fine. Move,” Sherlock said brusquely, shooing John until he could vault through the window and land elegantly on John’s office floor.
John returned to their bedroom some fifteen minutes later after his shower, ruffling his short hair, and rummaging through the wardrobe. Sherlock, feeling as if his entire body were throbbing in pain, still snuggled under the wonderfully-cosy red blanket. He cleared his throat, his deep baritone sounding out lazily.
Gritting his teeth, he trembled through the agony as he focussed on the young man ebbing away beneath him. It took a surprisingly short amount of time for him to begin to swoon, his vision to darken, his movements to feel numb. The last thing he remembered before passing out, was the fact of a cooling, pulse-less young man under his own care, and a vague recollection of his own blood-soaked, dripping shirt and urgent yells in the background.
John shuddered, getting used to the overfull feeling of Sherlock's blood-hot length taking him, pressing inside him inexorably and leaving him panting and squirming.
"Would you mind spending the rest of your life with me?" Sherlock blurted out, his heart thrumming in a way that made him light-headed and giddy.
John sobbed, his drunken consciousness reluctant to believe such sweet talk. Generally, Shaun spouted enticing filth and made a lot of delicious noises. "...Hurts a bit." He managed, peering dizzily at the man above him, his own face crinkled in discomfort.
"Oh...wow...that's...very good," John managed, before whining in panic, finding himself suddenly on the brink of a monumental climax. "Sherlock...I'm gonna come...ah, fuck," he whispered, trying to force himself over the edge, panting exhaustedly.
John relinquished his tender grip and strode purposefully from the lift, face set in a determined visage of denial. It was an obvious act. His arm was heavily bandaged and held stiffly at his side in a sling. Sherlock could see the pain every step caused in the tiny wince of John's eyes, the clenching of his jaw. Sherlock tried to get the door for him but John beat him to it, giving Sherlock a Look as he did.
He was still struggling, trying to save the life flickering beneath his palms, when fiery pain shot through his shoulder. It was excruciating. John had never felt or imagined such pain in his life.
"I...I…" Sherlock seemed incoherent, blinking rapidly as he stared sightlessly at the ceiling. "I…I can't…think," He confessed quietly as his body gave a violent shudder and he closed his eyes, whimpering.
It felt amazing as John crawled over his body, hovering above Sherlock on hands and knees, licking at Sherlock's lips and kissing him filthily, with definite purpose. Sherlock's hands came up, circling John's biceps and digging his fingernails into the skin, shivering when John moaned. Swallowing thickly, he pawed at John's upper arms - firm, hard and strong under those bloody deceptive jumpers. Their naked bodies nudged together in a thousand mind-blowing places, and Sherlock had a difficult job holding back the involuntary noises that wanted to embarrass him by leaving his throat.
"Undress me. Want you to see what you'll be dealing with," the businessman instructed, eyelids heavy and body anticipating.
Three floors up, shivering in the spring coolness, exacerbated by grim, concrete walls, Luke  fiddled dizzily with Sherlock's phone. A few good swigs of the potent home-made gin nestled between him and his colleague had already had an effect, and he squinted at the smartphone. "So where's...where's he going? I thought the last batch was going to Japan?"
Shaun looked like he was about to argue, then closed his mouth, shrugging. "It would've ended anyway. You want all that romantic shit and I'm not that way."
"John, you're driving me to distraction," Sherlock muttered, grinding his hips in the tiniest unconscious increments as he watched the doctor penetrate himself, buried irresponsibly under hateful bedclothes.
Sherlock gifted him with an honest, quick grin, and peeled off his clothes, grumbling a little as he struggled with the skin-tight leather trousers, leaning one hand on the wall for support . "...You'd never manage a striptease in these...bloody things," he mumbled.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about,” John said airily, indigo eyes on his bright screen. A rogue, feeble breeze seeped into the room, tasting of exhaust fumes and the strong, hot perfume of next door’s over-planted window box. Sherlock let the silence tick away patiently, his striking face without expression.
"Sorry if that's not what you- I didn't mean it like that, Sherlock." John back-pedalled as quickly as he could, his insides sinking at the stunned look on Sherlock's face. "I don't expect you to stay with me that long or anything. I don't want you to feel obligated just because I said- It was just a thought-"
to be fucked into oblivion," John murmured casually, taking his lunch and re-constituted orange juice over to the grubby barracks table.
' came the eager reply, smeared haphazardly against John's hip…before Sherlock began to climax. John watched Sherlock's cock dribble out semen inside the flesh jack, fascinated by the unfamiliar sight. Urgent, smothered groans from Sherlock's throat vibrated unbearably against his shaft. After the doctor had forced his weight down against the singularly vicious bucks of the younger man's damp hips, and the shivers had worked their way out of Sherlock's body, John immediately raised up, his cock slipping free of Sherlock's mouth with a wet pop.
"Wait, wait, wait!" He hissed and John immediately stopped, dropping the belt, his hands smoothing over the welts on Shaun's body.
“……Fine. Perhaps I was being…a little unreasonable.” Sherlock cast his pale eyes briefly, inscrutably, into John’s before steeling himself and leaning down for a quick peck on the lips.
"S'okay...carry on," Sherlock uttered in a consoling, if distant, tone, back arching as the tip of John's finger slipped into his body, wincing. He writhed, body burning at the intrusion, trying to relax.
"John, you are already seven minutes behind schedule. If you don't want to be fired, you'd better get dressed. You've already been late four times in the last fortnight. Oh, and you missed a spot," the detective instructed, pointing at his own jaw, the same spot that John had failed to raze while shaving.
“Maybe deep down, you just don’t want to. Maybe you should stop being so stubborn. Maybe you should get out of your Mind Palace a bit more. No wonder you’re so pale, you’re always indoors.”
"That was roleplaying." Sherlock dismissed his earlier, forced apology with a wave of his hand. "That was...for fun. We were playing. This time...I really mean it, John." He gave John his best apologetic stare. "I am sorry."
And the fact, John thought as he tugged Sherlock's trousers down, relishing the ripping tear he heard as he yanked at them, that Sherlock had goaded him into this, had manipulated John the whole time- all day long- was just...it made him... Christ...it made him want to spank the little brat.
John's hands smoothed down his legs, eyes dark and hot against his skin. "Y-yeah. That's perfect, Sherlock." He murmured, throat bobbing as he swallowed. "Perfect. Is it...is this alright for you? I didn't ask...I just assumed you wouldn't care-"
“Y…Um…if it’s so troublesome to have my clothes lying around in your Mind Palace, you could always just clean up a bit,” John quipped, trying for humour. It sounded as flat and awkward as it felt.
"Talk about what?" Sherlock hated the way his voice came out- breathy and unsteady and betraying all the unease he felt. John's hands on him, instead of feeling pleasurable and nice, felt judging. Running around over his flaws and taking stock of all the areas he fell short in. The setting sun, and its exposing, yellow beams filtered onto Sherlock's abdomen. The warm light picked up motes of dust that were doing nothing, regretfully, to distract John's intent gaze from his whippet-like body.
In fact, he might photocopy it and also store it on a couple of flesh-coloured USB's in the shape of John's manhood, just to be sure.
"Why not?" John replied airily, shrugging, casually setting aside his phone and distracting his detective with the scalp massage he knew made Sherlock melt.
Sherlock was laying lazily on their bed a little while later when he heard the door slam and his doctor stomp downstairs. Sherlock had dispensed with the duvet, and also the sheets of the bed, and was sprawled prostrate, completely naked, and suffering a wonderfully indistinct and passive, yet insistent, arousal.
He let John freely roam over his body, hands skimming lightly over his skin, mouth following right after. He gasped, spine arching, when John brushed a finger over his nipple, pleasure fizzing through his body.
The sound of soft panting was the first thing he heard, followed by an angry growl. "You haven't told your co-workers you have a boyfriend?"
"Put them on." John gasped, the visual in his head stunning and his prick tried fruitlessly to get hard again.
"Brace yourself against the wall. You'll be glad you did," John ordered quietly, and Shaun obeyed, licking his lips in anticipation. This was going to be good.
"But I want to sleep with you. I want to consummate 'us.' It would...reassure me." Sherlock was still talking to him from the floor, his eyes tired but imploring.
When Sherlock dripped once more onto the doctor’s lower back, he didn’t bother to smear it away, just moved his owns hips forward briefly to grind into his own lukewarm wetness, leaning down quickly to nip hard at the tender, thin skin behind John’s ear with imperfect, sharp teeth, before kissing it soothingly.
She panted, her heart racing, brow creasing in concentration as she felt her orgasm start to build between her legs, tingling sweetly through her abdomen and down into her groin.
It seemed to him that there was hardly any difference between using your fingers or a toy to penetrate somebody, and using a penis. But there must have been a distinction, and quite a considerable one, otherwise John would presumably have made love to him a score of times by now. There also was the troubling consideration of John's prior eagerness to jump into bed with women he barely knew, and have full sex with them.
"Doctor Waston. Know Sherlock well, do you?" His smile, ostensibly friendly, was like a huge, poorly-fused, dangerous flare.
"That was a stroke of luck," the doctor confessed, starting to openly twiddle his fingers, the digits of his left hand still a little stiff and intransigent to his brains' commands after his injury.
"I'm not drunk." John replied, his voice low and...apologetic? "I'm sorry for the pub, Sherlock. That wasn't...we shouldn't have laughed like we did.
“Oh.” Sherlock muttered at the explanation, tilting his head on the pillow. “Had a lot of experience in that then?”
"My phone isn't enough? You still need to..."John gulped as another shuddering moan ghosted down the line, suddenly realizing what Sherlock was doing. "You're getting yourself off?"
John yelped out before he could stop himself with the shock and delight of being crushed even tighter within Sherlock, and knew that he couldn't have pulled out even if he'd wanted to. Biting his lip, John strained to hear where their landlady was and what she was doing, but Sherlock's loud breaths were dampening and heating his palm, and he had to fight, and fight hard, to concentrate enough and focus on her location.
Feeling apprehensive, Sherlock stood beside John's chair, looking down at the expanse of his chest, wondering if John's nipples were as sensitive as his own. John had rubbed them earlier but with no visible signs of enjoying it- his cock had remained only semi-hard. Perhaps if Sherlock licked them…
people are." He wriggled his eyebrows at Sherlock, chuckling at the way he blushed. "Doesn't mean I still can't satisfy you. If that's what you want?"
"You forgot…that when you wake me for no legitimate reason at a godforsaken hour in the morning, you owe me an orgasm."
"...Sherlock...give me twenty seconds to tell you why you're wrong? Before you storm off in an unfounded huff?" John asked, smiling. He crossed the room, placing his hands on Sherlock's red-hot cheekbones, his palms actually heating up with the embarrassed fire that was kindled in them.
John mewed out a little confused noise, insistently bumping his bare backside against Sherlock. “Sherl? Why’d you stop? You were just getting to the good part,” and the dirty smirk was evident in his voice, even though his face was muffled by the warm pillow.
. It hadn't waned in his short trek to the bedroom and had, if anything, got even harder at the sight of John stripping off his clothes and throwing Sherlock dark, seductive looks.
John turned to cuddle him tight, fondly rubbing his toes against the sleeping detective's calves. "Goodnight Sherlock."
Sherlock sighed dramatically, promptly blowing his sheet music off of his face and all over the floor. Grumpily, tiredly, he rolled to face the back of the sofa, and let Mrs. Hudson pat his head supportively.
“God, John, the sight of you,” Sherlock expressed suddenly and inadvertently, his voice sinfully deep and gravelly. John sometimes fancied that Sherlock’s larynx was comprised entirely of sandpaper, nectar and pheromones.
“Don’t you remember? You said, ‘John, I think I’d like to take the river air in your scintillating company.’”
"...What can I say, cheap jewellery on expensive men just gets me worked up," John murmured, squeezing Sherlock's hand one last time before settling properly on top of him, sternum to ankles.
Well, he'll just have to stay angry, John thought. He can't have expected me to remain celibate my whole life, just on the off chance we'd meet and have it off together. Besides, Sherlock could have slept with half of London and I wouldn't care. It wouldn't make one bit of sodding difference if he had. They were together now. John didn't want anyone else.
John paused, momentarily made wordless before he snorted, shaking his head and laughing incredulously. "Oh, Sherlock...You really don't want to get off today, do you?" he asked, seizing Sherlock's slim wrists and, clutching them in one hand, pulling them behind Sherlock's back and held them there at the small of his back, trapped.
." John sighed, wrapping his hand more firmly around Sherlock's cock and squeezing. "Fuck - just fucking touch me, Sherlock. I want- I want your hand, wrapped around my cock, stroking-" John broke off when Sherlock's fingers did just that, wrapping around John's erection and carefully moving up and down. John huffed out a breath. "Just like that...slow...
bored (he'd been bored the whole time)- when John brought their still-joined hands up and kissed Sherlock's knuckles.
It only took a few strokes of his hand and another dozen, snapping, wild thrusts before Sherlock was going taut in orgasm and spilling copiously over John’s fingers and up the bed. He cried out, erratically rutting without control, taken up and consumed by pleasure as his muscles locked tight in a rough, convulsive spasm that seemed somehow endless.
John accepted his self-conscious silence with a knowing grin, before settling back onto the bed with a languid, happy groan. "Oh," he suddenly uttered, propping himself up slightly. "Get me something to wear while you're at it. I'm coming with you."
"Go on," Greg said encouragingly, a boyish grin on his face. "You're doing well. I might even return the favour."
!" Mrs. Watson was just as effusive in her greeting of Sherlock as she was of John, giving him a bosomy hug and engulfing him in a cloud of sickly sweet, flowery perfume. "I'm so glad to finally meet you. I've heard so much about you." She turned to John and gave a vulgar, exaggerated wink. "He
Sherlock let out a grumpy, petulant mumble and scowled like a toddler but, after a minute or so, he reluctantly stood and stalked to the bathroom.
"John and I are bored and want to go and have sex now." Sherlock clarified calmly, giving them both a pleasant smile.
"Yes..." John disturbingly said, settling down and listening as Sherlock flirted with their suspect.
"Do you really want to know?" John asked, grinning and Sherlock nodded, looking expectantly at him. "Then next time, I'll fuck you. And you'll know first-hand."
have a row- a bad one- and break up. Then she could comfort Sherlock. She'd be the good friend, the shoulder to cry on, the one to offer comfort, and Sherlock may fall in love with her.
After a few wonderful minutes of gentle, questing smooching, John pulled back, slightly breathless, giggling soundlessly as Sherlock frowned and tried to follow him with a kiss-bitten mouth.
With a strangled, surprised moan, Sherlock suddenly found himself being shoved back forcefully across the room, supported completely by John's strong arms, and slammed down roughly into his armchair. His sight weakened in the darkness, making him dizzy with blind excitement, Sherlock heard John chuckle before settling himself in Sherlock's lap, his legs spread to either side of Sherlock's thighs, and ground his hips down in a few excruciating rotations.
John groaned partly with shock, wishing he could reach to muffle his lover, who yelled loudly enough to ruin eardrums. Sherlock gritted his teeth and writhed sensuously through his lengthy orgasm, before abruptly sinking to his knees, shivering.
John shrugged. "Photographs of the crime scenes too. Everything. You don't need to be there in person to solve it. You're smart enough."
"I don't think - it's going to help now," the detective said plaintively, before casting a cool glare at Greg.
With shaking hands, he started the taps, mechanically checking the temperature before stripping off his clothes. It was difficult and under normal circumstances he'd have called Sherlock for help and made a few cheesy innuendos while he got undressed...but Sherlock didn't want him. Probably didn't want to see him naked.
Greg had been sipping at his drink, but his snort of humour sent a dash of foam into his face and he pulled back, coughing up a laugh.
-" Sherlock said warningly and John sat back on his heels, his fingers still moving inside Sherlock's body.
It wasn't as if the entire Yard hadn't caught on, but Greg was the only one he had confirmed it to. As far as he knew, the rest of them were just going off speculation. But despite Sherlock's odd comment about people knowing, it had been pretty good.
"Y-yes..." Sherlock stuttered, breath speeding up, inching closer to John on the bed. "I enjoyed controlling your movements while you were...while you were engaging in sexual intercourse of the anal variety with me."
“Are you certain? Because I’m getting so many mixed messages from you I feel like bloody autocorrect,” John muttered without malice. He ran a firm thumb over the soft blue veins that pulsed warmly on the back of Sherlock’s pale hand. The late-afternoon grimy sun was low in a grey summer sky, and induced frowns and watery eyes with its bright heat.
“You know as well as I do that lying around here sulking isn’t going to change a single thing, except make you more harassed and angry. I know you like to think that you thrive on chaos, but that’s only because you’ve got someone who shields you from it.”
John cleared his throat diligently, frowning a little, and trying to express himself in a manner that would maintain Sherlock's notably short-lived attention span, as well as articulating what he wanted to say.
?" John asked, licking his lips and wishing he was at the right angle to lap up the translucent fluid that was puddled on Sherlock's white stomach.
“Untrue,” Sherlock replied, his feet touching John’s leg again as he shifted and yawned noisily. “I ask for things. Occasionally.”
"We're not supposed to be in here together." Sherlock whispered shakily, staring down at his dominating boyfriend with wide eyes.
“The massage oil. Anniversary present,“  Sherlock uttered in a tone that suggested he was bored of anything that would cause him to make excessive use of his vocal chords. He purred pleasurably when John suckled at his throat enthusiastically, birthing a dark, red bruise with his lips and tongue.
"I...it's just," Sherlock muttered, mindless. "That might make me come," he admitted throatily, before suffering a full-body shiver.
"Sherlock." John's voice was closer, muffled from the other side of the door. "Come out right now. We're going to talk about this like adults."
"Okay." John murmured. "Relax, Sherlock. Do you...need something to hold on to?" He asked with surprising intuition, offering his right hand to his partner. Sherlock breathed out a thankful breath and, disengaging a hand from the sheets, gripped John's offered hand. He thought he saw John wince in the darkness but couldn't be sure, and a moment later John gripped his hand back tightly, stoically. Sherlock breathed in and out, letting the contact ground him. "You're doing great, love. So great. I'm going to start now...ok?"
"…'Mazing," John sighed, chest forcing out a few, overwhelmed exhales. He sighed, laying back heavily and gazing groggily up at the clear night sky. "Just...been fucked." he grinned. "S'good." He grabbed at Shaun, seeking his mouth for another kiss.
"We don't have to rush things." John's thumb traced over Sherlock's sharp cheekbone, his eyes soft and reassuring…and Sherlock wanted to pull his hair out in frustration.
John lowered his voice as a group of their comrades strode by, chatting and ribbing each other. He leaned closer, keeping his hands innocuously by his sides. "Don't worry. It's okay. We've got at least an hour. I found a new spot on patrol...no-one will be going past there again till 2. I'm gagging for it." He murmured, buzzing with anticipation. Shaun chuckled dirtily.
"Didn't it hurt?" John asked cautiously, though a small, dark part of his psyche goaded him by letting him know, like a vindictive little gremlin at the back of his brain, that he was more than happy to fuck Sherlock's throat raw if his lover were amenable to the idea. Sherlock shrugged.
Shaun's eyes closed as if in ecstasy, and he tongued the barrel of the handgun, sighing and shuddering in bliss. It was only a few seconds before he gulped down the cool metal barrel. He salaciously touched himself, an act that he knew from sheer experience could turn John from ice-cold to red-hot in a matter of seconds.
Sherlock could feel himself trembling beneath John's body, collapsed, hot and sweaty, on top of him, and he wrapped his arms and legs around John, trying to anchor himself. He was shaking, his chest tight, and felt as if he were about to fly off in a million directions. John seemed to sense his discomfort and pressed a kiss against Sherlock's cheek, choosing to ignore the moisture he found there- for which Sherlock was grateful.
"Now see here-" Mr. Watson started angrily as Mrs. Watson covered her mouth and John began trying to apologize for him, chagrined.
John's face fell in a visage of shock, before he huffed out a sharp, brief gasp of amusement, his brows raised, his face crinkling delightfully.
With an indulgent, strained gasp, Sherlock managed to get up on shaky legs, shrug on John's discarded dressing gown, and wander out in the living room, yawning mightily. His stomach rumbled and Sherlock, massaging it curiously, discovered that he actually felt hungry. He frowned, suddenly realizing John had left without first cooking something for him to eat.
?’ expression in response to his his pun, before Sherlock pulled back and knelt uncertainly beside his partner.
Sherlock was drifting into a comfortably dreamless doze when his phone beeped noisily from his trouser pocket. Groaning, he dragged his upper body from the bed, scrabbled for it in the crumpled mass of expensive fabric, and retrieved it. John glanced at him and huffed at the sight of his naked hips and legs anchored on the bed, whilst he balanced awkwardly on one hand on the carpet.
He blinked, stomach sinking and John must have seen something of his disquiet on his face because he wrapped his arms around Sherlock's frame.
"Mmm." John moaned in agreement, dropping down onto his elbows and Sherlock shakily opened the bottle of lube and poured a large amount onto his palm, sliding the slick fluid along John's inner thigh, first one and then the other, huffing at the feel of coarse hair beneath his sensitive palm. John groaned and Sherlock watched his cock twitch in front of him before John crossed his legs at the calves, hooking his ankles together and creating a tight place for Sherlock to fuck...if he could make himself do it.
"Should've known you'd be good at this." John said awkwardly, as Sherlock bound his arms to the slats in the headboard with deft, no-nonsense movements. Sherlock bit his lip with malicious glee, eyes focused on John's barely-clad, obviously aroused body which was now spread out for his perusal. He swallowed and tried to tamp down on his own burgeoning arousal, which was barely hidden by his thin silk pyjamas.
Down the hall, the loo door opened and John stuck his wet, dripping head out. Soap bubbles clung around his face and slid down his neck. "What?" He shouted back, eyes squinted closed to avoid getting soap in them and Sherlock held up the almost-dead rose, holding it aloft so John could see.
yet, Sherlock, and if running around the flat winds you so much how do you expect to run round a crime scene?"
. John seemed happy. He wasn't mad at Sherlock and Sherlock had made sure to do nothing to provoke him. He hadn't left any disgusting experiments on the table, no body parts in the fridge, and he'd even gone so far as to tidy his things in the sitting room…a bit. But John still refused to take things further- or even take them back to what they'd already done (Sherlock was very happy with handjobs- John was pleasingly skilled in that area).
"Oh, I'm sure it'll...perk right back up in a minute." Sherlock said dismissively, not caring in the least if it did or not. Either way, he needed John distracted. "You're...very skilled at doing that." He said, as John started gently stroking his soft cock.
After a minute of kisses which were of a short-circuiting intensity, Sherlock pulled back, huffing inelegantly for breath, and quite frankly lost for words. "You, um...we were…I'm...what?"
"So, what do you want for breakfast? We've already got almost everything made. Should have known you'd lay in bed until it was all done, lazy sod." John said fondly, pulling away and returning to tending the bacon. Sherlock stared after him, trying to assimilate how things were different from what he'd envisioned in the bedroom. He still felt on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Was it possible John had
