The news that the nurses and doctors brought them about their friend, the biological mother to their baby, was one of the worst things they heard that night. She had died after birth, and while trying to process it, they learned they would have to keep the baby there, for breathing problems and his time to develop.
“I think I’m gonna need a minute.” Steve went to leave, but before he could take one step, he felt a tug on his hand. No words were spoken, but Steve had spent the rest of the day listening to his ex-boyfriend’s broken cries and doubts. His stories, and his confusion. In the end, as hard as it was, they discussed Siberia. They both answered and asked questions. Cleared things up. Tony understood the friendship with Bucky, similar to his friendship with Rhodey. Steve understood the lack of trust that he'd have to gain back.
“She contacted me a while ago. She wanted to see what we were up to. We haven’t talked to her in ages, so I thought maybe we could invite her over. She hasn’t met Peter yet, and he’s not sensitive to anything anymore, so…”
Tony quickly interrupted. “Now, before we commence our mission, I’d just like to say that if this ends up not working and I come back to my kid as an angsty teenager that’s in a constant state of ‘nobody understands me’ it’s on you guys.” Everybody smiled at his joke, something the original six had oddly missed. Steve took Tony’s hand in his, reassuringly. “You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green.”
His face turned from confusion to worry when he saw all the missing posters, abandoned belongings on the streets, and homes that looked like nobody had stepped into them in years. Then, he saw a kid on a bike that seemed to be used to the environment around him pass by.
“Nat!” Steve walked into the living room, his hands dry of the soap and water from the sink. “I’m so glad you came, and I see you’ve met Pete.”
“Only when your ego gets too high.” Natasha remarked, her teasing gaze turning soft when Peter started babbling to her.
“Indeed, I have, mini Captain Stark. One day I’ll take you away from the fossil and can man for a secret trip.” Natasha smiled deviously.
As the ship landed, Steve ran out of the compound, his face completely free of the beard that was once there, toward everyone else. There, Natasha was waiting for him, smiling as she beckoned him over. Everyone was looking up, and when Steve followed their eyes, he saw it. The ship was being carried by Carol Danvers, who Steve had contacted about Tony. He hadn't really spoken to her about anything else, but she was willing to help and she did it.
Nebula looked away, speaking into her earpiece. “Rhodey, be careful on reentry. There’s an idiot in the landing zone.” She walked away confidently, and Scott shrugged. That's when he got startled by a figure landing right near him, making him drop his taco.
heroes were back. The grass seemed greener, mountains were at their highest, all the grey in the world was gone.
The genius took a second to think. He had spent so many years protecting the Earth. Protecting families not unlike his own. And now a majority of those families were torn apart by the Snap, and he couldn’t imagine the pain he’d go through if he had lost Peter like other parents lost their children. His husband, as happy as he seemed to be, was still grieving his friend, his family. He lived to see his love and his son happy.
“Give me the eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That’s gonna take a second.” he said, observing the hologram in front of him.
“Happy isn’t really the word I would use. Smug would be more appropriate. Complacent. Wisenheimer. Schadenfreude.”
Not because of pride either. Pride is not and has never been an issue between Tony and Pepper and Rhodey. Pepper and Rhodey (and Happy, but that still kind of hurts to think of) have seen Tony drink his entire life’s work down the drain, seen him at his most villainous during the Superhero Civil War, seen him at his most twisted and broken and stood by him even during the very worst and the lowest points of his life. Tony can be as prideful as he wants with everyone – everyone except them.
“Tones.” Rhodey’s dark eyes are soft and understanding. “Call us, okay? Every week just to let us know you’re alive. And we’ll visit when you’re ready to see us again.”
. I have a family now, an amazing husband, and a beautiful son, but I can’t help but feel like there’s still hope.”
“I think daddy and papa are going to be superheroes, like what they tell me at night. He was fixing his iron man suit last night, I saw. And he put papa’s shield in a box.” the child said excitedly.
Peter grunted, sometimes leaning on one side and almost falling, but then balancing himself again. He was almost there.
“Listen, fur-face, I’m covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets.” Carol bristled.
Natasha took a breath, trying to hold in her tears when her phone rang. She looked at the contact, seeing the name Steve and collected herself.
"Tony. Oh my god, Tony. You're okay. You're here." Steve muttered into Tony's hair, while the other man laid his head on Steve's shoulder.
“Oh, look.” Rocket cooed mockingly. “It’s like a little puppy. All happy and everything. Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I’ll get you to space.”
“How can I calm down?” Tony yelled. “What if Peter doesn’t like his nursery? What if he decides that he hates me when he’s older? What if I start acting like- well, you know.”
Tony walked down the stairs, seeing Steve sketching something in front of the fire. He made his way over to his husband.
“Okay, when I say kill the power, kill the power.” Bruce told her, causing her to rapidly move toward the generator.
“These are Pym Particles, alright?” Scott yelled, holding the red tube. “And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We’re not making any more!”
“Mexico. The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.” he answered.
“Sorry. We got enough for one round trip each. That’s it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs.” He accidentally pressed the button on his suit, shrinking and going back to his regular size. “One rest run.”
have everyone. We have an opportunity. And I would never put you or Peter in danger, god knows I don’t want to lose what I’ve been given, but this is bigger than the both of us. You know I lost people too.”
“Oh, come on. I can jazz to a few tunes, as you’d probably say it. Right, Pete?” Tony pokes Peter’s belly, causing him to grab his finger and start shaking it around. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
As the man called for anyone to let him in on the footage, Natasha told her friend on the phone, “I’ll call you later. I’ve got some things to manage.”
Tony and Steve choose to move on together and they seem to need an anchor to pull them back to Earth, and that happens to be Peter.
“But we gotta give him a name, ‘cause I want to be able to stop referring to him as ‘he.’” Tony pointed out.
Nebula let out a yell, holding out her arms in a fighting stance when Tony flicked the paper at her.
He threw the baseball glove he had taken from his past and tossed it to Tony. “Yeah. It worked. It worked.”
“I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job… this family. And I was… I was better because of it. And even though they’re gone, I’m still trying to be better.”
Bruce scratched his head, looking around at the different buttons in front of him. “What’s going on?”
The older man raised his eyebrow, turning around to see his son sitting on the steps of the stairs and smiling at him.
Tony tilted his head nonchalantly. “Well, I’d substitute the word encounter with damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.” Steve looked at Tony with sadness.
“No need,” he interrupted. “Just had to get that out of the house before Peter decided to use it on one of his LEGO weapons. Keep it on the downlow, though okay? I didn’t bring presents for the whole team.” He paused. “We are getting the whole team, right?”
“Oh, right. Tony and I were thinking of having a small get together with Rhodey, Pepper, Happy and you. A day to catch up. Tony has been dying to see everyone again, even though Pepper and Happy visited a week ago. Peter’s also been begging to see his Aunt.”
“Come on, baby. Come to Papa. I’m right here. It’s okay if you can’t do it, just try.” Steve encouraged.
“No, no, Cassie, no. Please, please, please…” he trailed off, his eyes widening at shock at the name in front of him.
“Aunt Pep, do you know when daddy and papa are coming home?” Peter asked, his hands busy with his toys.
“Oh, thank you, thank you.” Tony slid over to where Steve was sitting with a huge smile on his face.
Steve couldn't calm his heart. He was pretty sure that if he stopped bouncing his leg, he would collapse. Tony would be arriving tonight, and for the first time in what felt like forever, he was excited. Scared, but excited. He hadn't seen Tony in, what, two years? Of course there were news reports about him, but on-screen Tony was never the same. He still regretted his actions- the punches he threw, to the man he loved. Whenever he thought back to it he was disgusted. Was this what Dr. Erskine wanted him to become? A hero gone rogue? A man who would hurt his own love?
It turns out Bruce and Rocket we’re going to New Asgard, in the countryside of Norway, to collect Thor and convince him to help them with their plan. Everything hadn’t gone exactly right, Thor had suffered greatly from the losses of the Snap and the destruction Thanos brought upon his home and his people. He had agreed to come because of alcohol apparently, but it was enough.
He looks down and swirls the whiskey in his glass. He watches the tiny vortex made by the golden liquid and whishes to disappear inside of it. But he remains standing there, alone, a hole made by loss deepening in his chest.
There is a feather-light touch on his arm and he almost jumps out of his skin. The woman, Amanda, is looking at him with head slightly cocked. This close her eyes look golden as the sun shines into them.
She snapped her eyes back at her husband. He looked back apologetically, his blue eyes saying sorry.
He sobers up too. He follows her gaze till his too settles onto the city once more. Then as she glances to the side, she sees that his blue eyes start to glow with the artificial blue color of the arc reactor. Zigg-sagging lights appear on his skin around his orbs. He is searching, so she waits for the results.
He did it somehow, then he was left with one, absurd thought swirling in his head like the snake around Eve’s ankles. He could stay in the past. Stay with someone he loves. He could find happiness. He seriously started planning. He went and found a quiet library in the city, sat down and started planning. He had everything ready, knew when he wanted to go.
"Much better!" she hums as he pulls his arm back. "By the way. You know the saying, you have to love yourself before you c---"
Her speech comes to a sudden halt and she blinks up at him owlishly. A technic he has learned with Tony. Sudden, not related questions are good ways to stop his famous rantings. Were. His brain probably shortcircuited. It works like magic on this lady too.
"A garage? How do you expect us to get a garage, oh sorry, not just a garage, but a working garage, preferably with a good reputation in two days?" he asks, his incredulity is clear in his voice.
Pepper is dealing with everything. He should help out. She should be able to mourn, not manage everything again. He has been told that there will be cremation. There won't be a coffin, there will be an urn. Peggy's was so heavy on his shoulder, this one would mockingly light. Not that they will actually have a chance to even glance at the urn. It will be Pepper's and no one else will ever know where his final resting place will be. Just her. His request. There is a logical explanation behind it all, of course. In their world, supervillains would do anything to create something super bad and his DNA with his stupidly smart brain ...
"As much as I hate this idea, " her husband spoke up again still looking oh so apologetic, "You are the best choice. He will listen to you."
She sits up straight and this time there is nothing easy in her posture. She is rigid, battle-ready. Her brown eyes flash at him.
He remembers the Snap. He remembers Hill. He remembers his own body disintegrating. Then out of nowhere, he is back, Hill is back. Two people he cared about so much are gone.
By some miracle, the AI has decided to accompany him everywhere through his phone. It is a Stark phone, one that was a present from Tony, when he agreed to the Timeheist.
However, the arrival of Pepper, Morgan, Happy, Harley and Peter was what really warmed and pained Steve’s heart.
She shrugs even though the man on the other end of the line can’t see her. “I recognized you,” she explains.
The tone that Nick used sounded off. It said more than his actual words. She frowned. "Like what..." she swallowed down the lump in her throat. It was not her version of Stever, but still, it was Steve!
Her shoes almost slipped on the wet ground as she made her way down the stairs that led to the secret door of their bunker. She cast another wary glance around, despite her instincts saying that it was okay, no one was around. You can never be careful enough. When she was sure that it was clear, she pulled the cover plate away with her glove covered fingers and punched in her entrance code. As soon as the door opened wide enough, she slipped inside and the sensors closed the door behind her. She sighed heavily as the elevator started downstairs smoothly. After a few minutes, the elevator came to a halt and she stepped into the living room of their secret bunker/shelter.
But Natasha isn't paying attention to their banter anymore. The looming threat against this Universe swims into focus as suddenly as usually her and Tony's ideas appear.
He sighs heavily and rubs his eyes. Experts say that denial is one of the most primitive but for a certain period of time the most effective and strongest way to cope. There must be something wrong with him because he is just not capable of it. Like his mind just wants to actually deal with it. Or destroy him. Who knows.
Then Pepper came. Pepper, a human female without any kind of superpower shut down their whatever this shithole was with only one shouted "enough". They froze, everyone where they stood. It looked probably comical how from one arm Clint from the other Sam was hanging off him, while the kid was wrapped in Rhodes' not relenting arms. Strange just looked miserable and defeated.
He blinks at the source of the voice, then quickly looks around, but there is no one else in this corner, so the "You" has been aimed at him.
The rest of the fight after that is a livid red haze. Tony thinks he might have thrown his Char Kway Teow at Steve. Steve holds fast to his moral high ground and doesn’t throw anything back.
“Yeah,” Tony chokes out. He’s sure he looks a sight, sniveling all over the place, but Steve doesn’t seem to care. Tony manages a watery smile. “I want it too.”
hard, I think. And the harder I tried, the more errors I seemed to make, the more people got hurt. And the harder I tried to fix it, the worse it all seemed to get.” Steve takes a deep, shuddering breath, eyes closed. “So, my answer is no.”
“Worse. I’ve been a lot of fucked-up, no-win, doomsday-esque situations – fought my way out of more of them than I can count – and I’m telling you now, this could be it. This is the worst one yet.”
“It sometimes surprises me too.” Steve tilts Tony’s chin up, fingers swiping the moisture on his cheeks. “I want this, Tony. After all these years, all our history, I don’t think I could bear to leave it like this between us. I want to try, at least. Don’t you?”
Tony’s vibrating in his seat. He’s metaphorically bouncing off the walls. He doesn’t know how long he’s been stuck in this cramped, confined space. The wait is the most horrible part of it. The drawn-out uncertainty, the restlessness and the ambivalence, like a miniature python swimming through his veins, coiling round and round his chest and heart and lungs, squeezing, constricting his windpipe, cutting off his airflow.
“An allergic reaction to the sound of my voice. I assure you, you’re not alone. You all should start a club.”
Through the large windows of the bakery, Tony catches Jamelia’s eye. The dark-skinned woman has her long shining black hair in a ponytail and wears a shapeless bakery apron that would look ugly and unflattering on just about anyone else. Jamelia’s sensuous lips curve up into a gleaming white smile. Tony responds with a charming grin of his own, pointing at his phone, then splaying all five fingers:
Tony has a lot of labyrinthine feelings about Steve Rogers, none of which he feels at all feels emotionally ready to deal with now.
The puppy barks joyously and runs circles around Tony’s ankles, wanting to play. Tony buries his head in his hands, accidentally poking himself in the eye with the frames of his sunglasses. Dismayed and injured, he gives serious thought to hiding indoors until Steve takes the hint and goes away. Gerald blasely goes back to gnawing on Tony’s white trainers, planting his furry behind on Tony’s feet to stop him escaping, the puppy’s furry tail tickling his skin.
Steve’s motorbike is still in his front yard (although thankfully at a tolerable distance from Tony’s potatoes) by the time he finally clocks off. Knowing that they have to have this talk sooner or later, Tony still feels his heart sink down to somewhere in the vicinity of his toes. He half-hoped that Steve would be called away by a conveniently timed alien invasion or HYDRA raid. But no such luck.
Now, Tony presses his shoulder against Rhodey’s reassuringly and sneaks a sideways glance. At the small amount of contact, Rhodey’s face changes from homicidal plotting to vaguely constipated. Tony chalks it up as a win.
“You don’t go back to someone the way you and Sharon go back to each other if there’s nothing there,” Tony finally says. “Obviously, what you have with her is something you both think is worth fighting for.”
Still, it beats being a drunk homeless person. Tony has been there, donated the T-shirt to Goodwill. Zero stars. Would not recommend.
But the things that he’d loved about being Hogan Potts are the same parts that he likes about his life
They’re sitting facing each other. Apparently, their combined weight is too much for the swing-set, whose mechanical joints squeak in protest, or maybe they just need oiling. The summer air smells of fresh pine and ripe fruit. Above them, the pale blue sky is steadily being enshrouded by a thin veil of pale grey clouds. Pepper is indoors, taking a call from one of SI’s major shareholders. Rhodey is otherwise occupied. Tony has bribed Gerald with the dessert of his choice from the pet bakery if the puppy distracts Rhodey long enough for Tony and Steve to speak alone, a task which Gerald effectuates meritoriously by stealing the homing device for Rhodey’s War Machine armor and running off into the wilderness with it. Tony doesn’t envisage seeing Rhodey or Gerald again for at least a few hours.
The residents of the nearest town – Conception Bay South – don’t seem to recognize or give much thought to the melancholic blond clean-shaven man who stays a week at their fanciest hotel (thank God for small mercies, room service, and a steady hot water supply).
“Talk about something easy than.” she offers after a few minutes. “There must be something not that complicated in your life.”
She and her husband groaned in unison this time. The black cat on the table meowed with mirth. Man... they would never live this one down...
As his legs carry him through the empty streets his thoughts assault him mercilessly. The argument crept upon them, then made its presence known through an explosion of emotions.
“No!” Tony orders. He unclenches his fist and brushes everything to the ground. He stands and walks to the farthest shelf of the workshop. He stares at the golden liquid taunting him through the crystal-clear glass.
In every universe that she had visited Stark had the very smart idea of creating this place and no one else knew about it. Not even Pepper, not even Rogers. Or Rhodey. Or Happy. Or... Really anyone.
"I don't know. I'm keeping eyes on the satellites and every public camera. I keep searching the Internet for his prints or any sign of him. So far, nothing." He sounds as frustrated as she feels. It is understandable. After all, their enemy keeps being at least one step ahead of them, bringing death and destruction to every universe he has visited.
It took them a while, but finally, they understood. With the Time Stone, Strange was able to see the future. He knew what would happen.
She hums as she laces her fingers together and rests her chin on the top of them. Well, no pressure at all.
She decides that they are childish and not worthy of her time, so, she attacks her breakfast, omelet made by her husband with gusto.
The black-furred cheetah jumps in front of him, effectively blocking his way. The green eyes that are looking at him are both disapproving and worried. It pisses him off even more.
She is looking at him with a searching gaze when he dares to turn back. There is that emotion on her face that he still can’t name, but it’s not pity which for he is oh so thankful.
The garage is in Queens which means a tiny road trip for Steve. He tried not to look, tried to firmly keep his attention on the road, but it turned out to be impossible. There are painful reminders everywhere. The people are mourning too, he tries to remind himself. However, there is an ugly thing deep in him, which keeps asking:
The night sky is still cloudy and everything around her is still wet, but she ignores it. The city lights in the distance look beautiful and shooting. It creates an air of nostalgia. A silent reminder of her own, long lost universe. Something dear burnt up in hellfire. She shakes her head to chase away the dark thoughts. As she said it before, long lost.
She lets go of his arm and walks away. Red coat, like a cape swirling after her. Something bright in the black world.
It started badly too. As soon as he was close enough, his eyes found the stones, this time locked in their case. It brought up thoughts. Rhodes and FRIDAY, removal of the stones, Tony’s lifeless eyes staring and not seeing, the fact of cremation, flashes of a long-gone war and the smells… He turned, hurried away from the others to a remote and tree-covered part of the farm and threw up. He stayed there, leaning against a tree, shaking like the leaves above him till Bucky found him. Then he cried on his best friend’s shoulder. Bucky didn’t say anything, didn’t try to comfort him with meaningless words and he has never been so grateful.
Still, when Natasha’s burner phone rings, everyone settles into a nervous silence. She sighs heavily when she sees the number on the display, then clears her throat and answers it.
Now, he runs like there is no tomorrow, which is bullshit because there will be tomorrow and there will be a funeral which he doesn't want to attend. But will.
This time he doesn't hurry forward to take her coat. He crosses his arms in front of him because this is not the time for a warm hug, but for damage control. He has an impossible wife after all.
They held a commemoration for Natasha this morning. They wanted to keep it separate from Tony’s. A morning just for her. They planned for just the original Avengers to be present. The remaining four of them. Jesus.
"There is oil everywhere! When was the last time... Wait don't answer that! I don't want to know! Holly cow! What... This! Do you see this? This is a crack! How could... you... Argh!"
Then he remembered his Harley. The house of cards had fallen. He remembered his bike, Amanda, then the avalanche started rolling… Pepper and Morgan, Rhodes and Happy, his team and family. Peggy and Tony.
He punches the button of the elevator angrily. He has a bad day. No particular reason for it, but it’s bad. The doors barely open, but he is already stepping out. He strides through the living quarter. There is a storm raging outside, and he needs to get out. The storm is the perfect cover. Someone else though has different ideas. Just like every fucking time.
"Amazing! It's settled!" Pietro appeared out of nowhere. His curling, silver hair fell into his mischievous blue eyes. "We are totally naming this mission Wooing Captain America!"
He almost forgets about his anger, about his bad day as he ponders on the subject. He is almost out of the bunker when something lends on his shoulder. He looks up and comes face to face with a green-eyed raven. They stare at each other unblinkingly for a long moment.
“Sir, FRIDAY has started a background check on Amanda Armstrong,” Jarvis reported. Tony looks up from his newest project with a hum. Was that… fondness in the AI’s voice? It’s not impossible, but surprising. He chooses not to point it out in the end. Though, he puts the observation in a tiny mental box and catalogs it as “Check it later”.
Dr. Strange. The Wizard. The Anomaly. Someone who seemed to hate Steve with passion. Someone who traded the Time Stone for Tony's life. According to Nebula at least. Tony never confirmed it.
And Thor? His depression hasn't gone away magically. During their Timeheist, he sought out Tony's company as much as he could. Rhodes said that Tony had PTSD and he suffered from depression too. He recognized it and knew how to deal with it. He was safe for the Norse God.
It took him some time but somehow, he found the courage and the strength to do what had to be done. He traveled back in time again.
"You could dress up as this Universe's Fury, he looks way cooler by the way," she commented as she turned her attention back to Nick, who despite her best efforts, didn't even roll his eyes.
"You should have seen your face." she hisses, then there is confusion. "Or his face. Whatever. But Steve, Honey! He is lost. He has nothing to lose. And he wants to lose that nothing too."
“Shit!” he hisses, but he manages to take the next turn and with the AI’s help, he soon finds himself on the right path again.
"Waaait!" she calls and grabs his arm stilling his movements. He looks back at her disapprovingly, blue eyes as piercing as cold ice. "I was just messing around. You know, being frustrated and all and not allowed to tinker. It messes with the mind." she explains while making quick circling motions at her temple with her now empty cup.
The night has covered the city with the blanket of darkness, but he doesn’t feel the need to turn the lights on. The dark fits him quite well nowadays. He sits on the edge of his bed, elbows resting on his knees, his long fingers holding a tiny vial between them. Pym particles. He snorts to himself. Truth be told, he planned his day very differently than how it turned out in the end.
He keeps his eyes on the running figure so far away from him. He sees him collapse. He sees the sobs shaking the body.
“Want to talk about it? There are studies that say it helps.” she offers as she turns back to the bike. “they also mention that it’s easier with strangers.”
She looks up to see a dark figure approaching her. She relaxes as she recognizes her own male version. Tony sits down next to her and peeks at her from under his black hoodie. Black. The color of their disaster trio. Tony, Pietro and that devilish monster that is still lying on their conference tables in a cat form love it. She finds it too much personally.
They meet up in their room this time. There is an exciting intensity to Natasha’s eyes as she storms through the door. She tugs harshly against her ponytail and soon her messy, dark hair falls to her shoulder. He meets her halfway. His fingers dart under her T-shirt and dance on her skin. She fists a handful of his shirt and tugs on it too, uncaring of the fragile buttons. Some of them land on the floor with a tiny clatter. Their lips meet and she bites then he too. They tumble onto the bed, somehow Steve ends up on the bottom. She looks fierce, hot and hungry above him.
Of course, it's her solution. He can't really blame her though. She grew up with this option always present. His wedding gift from her was Area 51 after all. But they are not at home. Not anymore.
"Of course, I want coffee! Stupid question!" she grabs the cup out of his hand and is already sipping it as he starts rolling his eyes.
He really should be with his team ... he likes calling them family... but are they? Is the right his? After ... all? For example... where was he during those five years? Why was it Nat and Rhodey who became the godparents? Where was he?
She lets out a frustrated sound and throws her arms up. He has to blink because of this, it is so... so Tony. He shakes his head.
"You know. Stupid husband thinking that I need sleep before the big mission. Tinker means I probably have to cut back on sleep. Hence the veto on the subject. But man! I have ideas! Ideas!" she whines.
“Uncle Happy!” Peter squealed, running towards him. The man couldn’t help but let out a smile at seeing the kid.
“Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them- Thanos doesn’t have the stones. Problem solved.” Scott said easily.
After a while of talking, everyone was sitting around the table, still discussing the stones, while Rocket paced on the table.
Tony quickly ran to the living room when he heard Steve yell for him, wondering if they were in danger, hurt, or worse. What he walked in on though, made his worried face turn into a happy one.
Clint gasped, taking deep breaths as quickly as he could as he came back to the Compound, tears finding their way to his eyes.
“I’m sure he misses you too. You can’t forget your best friend.” Steve knew she was still upset about Clint.
“Are you okay?” Natasha asked after she brough Scott in, who was pacing around the room as if struggling to say something.
“Okay, so the how works. We gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.” Steve led.
Meanwhile, Clint observed his surroundings, and the memory of his loving family hit him painfully. The helmet retreated, and he noticed a baseball glove that he knew belonged to his son. He looked up when a noise came from the stairs. A familiar voice he loved followed.
When Steve first laid eyes on his son, he let out a huge smile. He was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. The sight of his son made him feel like that scrawny kid from Brooklyn again, his dreams of a family life coming true. He had thought he found the love of his life when he met Peggy Carter, and when those dreams were crushed and he woke up to a new world, he told himself the family life wasn’t for him. He was destined to be the hero everyone knew him to be, and that only. All daydreams he had when he was younger would stay dreams. But now- now he had a man he loved so much by his side while he looked at his son for the first time. He knew he’d do everything and anything for the two loves of his life.
Natasha listened as Rocket reported his activities so far. She cut her peanut butter sandwich in a triangle, nodding.
Before anyone could say anything more, someone interrupted. Camera footage suddenly popped up in front of Natasha, and she saw a man in front of her she swore had been declared one of the victims of the Snap.
Steve smiled knowingly. “We both know that once you start you won’t stop. We have the chance to help people. You know what we have to do.”
Natasha smiled. She was nervous too. But she knew Tony, and he didn't forget about Steve either. He was good at doing that; pretending he forgot, that he doesn't care. It was funny, how Steve was oblivious to the fact that Tony missed him too. On the other hand, she also knew that Tony would need time in order to forgive his former teammate, and former boyfriend. He had been betrayed before, and the aftermath would always end in chaos.
Right before he fully closed the door, he couldn’t help but smile at the giggles that came from the room.
“That’s the EPR paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might’ve wound up pushing time through Lang. It’s tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should’ve cautioned you against it.” he said, ignoring her question and looking cocky.
She looks up when she hears an engine, and maybe it was because of the quiet environment, but it was unusually loud. She saw a surely expensive car zooming into the driveway and pulling up a little ahead of her. She smiled when it backed up and the window rolled down to reveal two friendly faces.
His aunt smiled, picking him up and settling him on a chair to eat. “Yup, you found out the little secret. They’re going off to save the universe. And when they come back, your dad said he’d fly you to get ice cream.” As disapproving as she was about that, she knew it would make Peter happy for the time being. He had been missing his parents for a while. He had even, for the first time ever, refused to go to sleep because he didn’t know where his fathers were. “How did you connect the dots? You must be really smart.”
“Sure was. That’s extortion. There’s a new word for you. Great minds think alike.” He looked back at the model he was working on, then turned back to Peter. “Juice pops was exactly on my mind.”
“Are you done?” he asked, wiping the sticky red substance on Peter’s lips away, and eating the rest of what was left on the stick. “Now you are.” He pushes the boy’s face with his whole hand down onto the bed. “That face goes there.”
Tony tapped his helmet, causing the eyes to light that familiar shade of blue. "This thing on?" He sighed. He was thinner than when he came to space, and with everything that happened, it wasn't just the lack of food that caused him to look this way. "Hey Cap. Steve. If you find this recording, don't show it to anyone. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I'm not sure you'll get this message. I'm not even sure if you're still-" He couldn't finish that sentence. It would shatter the little hope he had left. "Oh god, I hope so. Today is day... 21. No, 22." He looked out into the darkness.
“Oh, did I? Thank god I’m here. Regardless, I fixed it.” he joked, pulling out a device. “Fully functioning time space GPS. I just want peace.” He said nonchalantly, holding up a peace sign. “Turns out, resentment is corrosive and I hate it.”
Steve groaned at being awakened at such a late time. He rubbed his eyes, sitting up slowly and focusing on the figure in front of him.
“Why do I feel like you’ve been spending too much time with Tony?” Happy sighed, sitting at the table. “Old Pepper wouldn’t do this to me.”
He shook his head. “No. But what about- we have everyone. We have Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, Peter. I have you. What if we could pretend this never happened?”
Peter’s sad face broke into a grin with two bottom teeth showing. His small hands started clapping too, and his giggles filled the excited room.
"Keep bouncing your knee and you won't be able to run to Tony when you see him." Natasha raised her eyebrow at the super soldier.
Bruce nodded, pressing the side of a button pad and hoping for the best. The old man was sucked back in, and instead of what they wanted, they got a baby, again, Scott.
Peter let out an exaggerated gasp, his eyes lighting up, when he saw through the window a familiar car.
“Guess my approval isn’t important, right?” Tony raised his arms, away from his cereal bowl he was making for himself. “But if it is, I agree.”
Steve chuckled, pushing Tony’s shoulder teasingly and giving him a scolding look that looked eerily similar to the one their son had given him a few days earlier.
Natasha paused. “Wait, he lived in New York?” she asked, gathering all the information they had in her head quickly.
“Oof.” Peter fell on his knees and hands, sitting himself on the carpet, and when he looked up at his dads, his eyes were watery.
This should have been updated on Sunday or Saturday, so I’m so sorry! I had trouble writing this for some reason, and it might be bad. I need to start working on the next chapter ASAP.
"And Steve... I know we had a rough couple of years," Tony took a breath, eyes squeezing shut at the memory that haunted his dreams, "but I hope you forgive me. For lashing out like that. He's your best friend. Your war buddy. I was just angry, confused, scared. I think I've come to terms with it. The whole mind-control thing.  HYDRA is one son of a bitch. I see why you did it, and I respect you, Steve. As both Captain America and Steve Rogers. I don't know if I can fully forgive you for anything, but I know we could've gone past it. I used to hope that we could go back to what we were someday. I'm not sure if that's gonna happen; unless you send a god more powerful than Thor. But since we know there isn't a big chance of that happening, know that I don't blame you for anything. Maybe just for the destroyed suit and shield part, but we both could've talked it out. So when I'm gone... don't feel bad about it. Don't blame yourself. We all know you have an enormous guilt complex sometimes. I just want you to know that I love you. And when I drift off, I'll be thinking about you.
“Alright. Uh, well, this channel is always active. So if anything goes sideways, anyone is making trouble where they shouldn’t, comes through me.” the redhead told them.
He quickly scribbled the words “HELP” on a board he found, directing it to a camera he had seen while moving around. After he had been taken out, he decided to go find out what time it was. Really, what he had missed since time in the quantum realm could be different from time in reality.
The helmet on Peter’s head was removed, and Tony smoothed out Peter’s ruffled brown hair. “There you go. Thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.”
He chuckled. “You like going to the garage, huh?” He picked up Peter and started walking to the house. “Well so does daddy. It’s fine, actually. Just don’t tell your pops or he’ll launch me into the Mariana Trench and run away with you.”
The other man’s face fell immediately. “You’re kidding, right?” He studied Steve’s face. “You’re not kidding.”
“I hope he doesn’t dance like you when he’s older,” Steve said from the kitchen where he was washing dishes.
Not three seconds after, they had all shrunk and entered the Quantum Realm, many of them separating and going to different times in their history. They couldn’t mess this up- it might be their second chance but that was all they were going to get.
“Bring back what we lost? We hope so.” Steve continued. “Keep what we have? We’ve got to, at all costs.”
Tony put Peter on his mat and went to open the door. “You’re lucky I love you, Rogers.” When he opened the door, he beamed.
Tony looked shocked. Last time, he was 1,208. “Wow,” he marveled silently, turning off the lamp. “3000… that’s crazy.” He pulled the door, almost closing it. “Go to bed. Or I’ll sell all your legos. Night night.”
In the first week of having Peter at home, Tony was constantly worrying. He didn’t stop until Steve convinced him that he was already a great dad and that Peter needed his dad to be able to have a good childhood. At this, Tony realized if he kept worrying about hurting Peter and avoiding touching him in case, he would become
Tony pulled apart to face Steve, his eyes full of unshed tears and shame. "I let them down. I lost."
Scott, confused, looked between the two men. “I haven’t. I don’t even know what the hell you're talking about.”
Pepper shook her head, watching as Peter gobbled down his last bite, and patiently waited. He was passed the bag by Happy, and when he took out what was inside his jaw dropped.
“Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski.” Tony called to Thor. He turned his attention to Rocket. “Ratchet, how’s it going?”
"I mean, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection has run its course, thanks to the blue meanie back there. I think you'd like her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we found a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time. But its now dead in the water. We're 1,000 lightyears from the nearest 7/11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it.
“What I’m saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem right now, is we don’t have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can’t stop thinking about it. What if we could somehow control the chaos, and navigate it? What if there was some way we could enter the Quantum Realm at one point in time and exit at another point in time? Like before Thanos.” he suggested.
“Let’s start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?” Steve asked the god, who was sitting on a chair, sunglasses on and a can in hand.
Natasha felt her own eyes well up with tears, pushing them down, and apologizing. “I’m sorry I couldn’t give it to you sooner.”
Scott opened the portal, and Natasha double checked everything around Bruce. A week after talking to Bruce, they had figured
I wrote all of it on my phone, so there might be grammar mistakes, sorry! I’m also so pissed because I had started writing and it all got deleted so I had to redo it😤
Steve stared at the baby, thinking hard. They had thought of names before, but so far some of them didn’t seem to fit, and he’d forgotten some.
you can imagine. But the parts that still work are trying to take a census. It looks like he did what he said he was going to do.” Natasha added.
"Damn, that's harsh!" he grins. There is no amount of empathy present in his features. The bastard! He is probably already planning his full night long tinkering in one of the bunker's labs. Because of course, it has multiple of that. Stark's creation after all.
“Oh… But come on! You gotta be clearer about your questioning…. So, other Stark and our shapeshifting buddy have gone on a field trip. At least according to Jarvis.”
Her husband jumped to his feet and hurried towards her. He swiftly gathered her bags into his arms and pecked her lips gently.
The rain falls so heavily that it’s like walking through a thick curtain nonstop. The occasional flashes of lightning don’t give enough light to create better visibility. There is barely anyone outside and those who are unlucky enough to be there don’t care about anything else, just to get to their destination as fast as possible. No one pays attention to the lone, darkly dressed, hooded figure walking around slowly. And finally, after so many days, Tony can walk around freely and not think. He follows the black raven that hops from a rooftop to a garbage can, then onto the lamppost. His mind is finally blank.
He chuckles without mirth and closes his fingers around the tiny vial. He came back to 2023 because a woman got angry on behalf of his bike. He stands up and walks to the nightstand. He pulls a drawer out and gently puts the vial inside. He has still time after all. Quite literally actually.
“Oh, you here!” he hears and turns towards the source. Amanda just stepped out of the office that belongs to the main room. She looks completely different than last time. She is wearing worn and faded jeans, sneakers, a black T-shirt and there is nothing neat about her ponytails this time. Without her makeup, she looks older too. In her late thirties maybe.
Steve agrees. He still sounds a bit hesitant, but a notch better than before. She ends the call after a curt “bye” and dares a glance at her teammates. They don’t look too happy with her.
He spots the garage two buildings away from him. He parks his bike in front of it and stares at it hesitantly. There is no one in sight, but the door is open. In the end, he enters on foot. The garage is almost filled with equipment, car parts, a skeleton of a motorcycle. Despite that, everything looks clean. Somehow this also reminds him of Tony. His lab was always a mess, but still clean.
. But then Wanda, Sam, and Bucky appeared almost out of nowhere and the three stood in line right behind Clint. Rocket and Nebula accompanied Thor. Carol and Rhodes came from the sky, the Colonel in his suit, Danvers wrapped in her magical light. Fury's and Hill's presence was no surprise at all.
“It’s night and raining! Shitty weather with zero visibility! What more do you want? I can’t be kept under lockdown here. I’m not like that! Not like you!” he spats. And immediately regrets it when the cat flinches and curls a little on itself.
“He will change the world!” Howard had insisted. The bastard was right despite being a horrible father.
eyes looking back at him… That has been the hardest thing. He stood next to Pepper and Thor, watched the projection with them. Broke his own heart into million tiny pieces next to them.
“Are you sure about this?” he asks. The raven snaps his beak impatiently and flies ahead, leading the way. Tony finds himself grinning as he pulls his hoodie over his head.
They were facing each other, deeply immersed in a conversation. Steve couldn’t stop himself, he stared. Tony’s intelligent eyes were still vibrant, full of life. However, there was wisdom too. Some kind of mature aura to him that even Howard seemed to sense and seek. Tony’s father was leaning forward slightly and seemed to actually listen to the other man in front of him. A rarity considering the man’s nature.
But they knew about it. This was not their first rodeo after all. She just blessed this universe's Stark for it.
"We have the money you know." she huffs. "Coffee? Tell me we have coffee. There must be coffee. I've been shopping yesterday!"
“Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, by the sound of it, not that I was listening on it, but you know… something about coitus?” he grins. She just rolls her eyes.
"Be prepared, a shitstorm is coming!" Her male version from another universe spoke up. At least he was using a chair like a normal person. He didn't turn towards her though. His intense blue eyes were regarding a hologram in front of him with great interest.
"He could do it!" the new arriver huffed as she pointed at the black cat that was also resting on the top of the table. Everyone in the room turned towards the dark-furred feline, who looked back at them with unimpressed green eyes.
He glances at his bike with confusion. It has seen better times, yes, way back then Tony took care of it almost maniacally.

It turns out that their team can create their own garage in one and half day indeed. Jarvis found the perfect place on sale and he was the one who did the transaction online too. Pietro isn’t as famous here as in his own, original universe, so, he was the one who accompanied Natasha to check the place out and sign the contacts. Do some charming to hurry things up. Tony, Jarvis, and Widow created a background for Amanda Armstrong and her garage.
The rain is falling when he steps out of their temporary shelter. He doesn't care. It's fitting after all. All he needs are few claps of thunder here and there and everything would be fucking perfect.
"He most likely talks with that Nick. It would be a total failure. No, it has to be you. You have enough experience, knowledge and you wouldn't be recognized. Perfect combination."
It takes a while, but he finds a topic. He tells her about the whales he saw right before their last mission. She listens intently as she works. There is a half-smile on her lips as he goes into details about the way they splashed the water, how they sang to each other. By the end of the story, he feels lighter and starts into another story of strange animal sightings he heard about.
He sits on the top of the bunker, just like how he did it last night with his female twin. This time though it's not coffee in his glass, but whiskey. His eyes glow with blue artificial light as his connection with a satellite is in place.
Her coffeemaker works with capsules and it takes a few tries to actually get something other than hot water out of it, but Steve has been called stubborn for a reason. Eventually, he manages to produce two espressos and takes one of them to Amanda who by this time almost totally dissembled his bike.
“Swear to God, Facebook is a nuisance!” Tony huffed after creating the hundredth account just for a single comment. Romanoff laughs at his annoyed expression, then drinks the rest of his coffee just for the hell of it.
He remembers staring at the man as he stepped out of his black SUV. He started preparing for agents, bullets, the Raft. Ross just looked at him and he seemed oh so tired.
“A friend of mine used to tinker on it.” he falters on the word friend because of so many reasons he can’t actually count, but then he soldiers on through the sentence. He swallows and turns away because his mind comes up with images that hurt hurt hurt. “He can’t anymore.”
Then the elevator arrived and took the pair away, leaving Steve behind to finish his mission in a daze.
The tributes sometimes feel dishonest. He can’t forget how these people used to dunk Tony's name into the mud. It hasn't been that long. Now, everyone hangs black flags everywhere, there is red and gold painted on buildings, walls, monuments. Even the Statue of Liberty.
But then the Universe does what it loves to do, to remind him that technically this is a bad day and he can’t let his guard down on bad days. This is the first thought in his mind as something orange appears in front of him and it turns into an oh so familiar portal. The raven calls out to him warningly, but his legs are rooted to the ground. He watches the emerging figure with a morbid fascination.
"Nat!" he warns her. She blinks at him with a mixture of annoyance and exasperation. He ignores it. "Ther emergency fund is not for this."
No one knows that Nick Fury has the same mantra running on a loop in his own head. He sips his drink. He has so much shit to do.
“Not here,” Pietro shrugs. She knows twenty-seven ways to kill him on the spot. Scratch that. Twenty-eight.
He spins and as soon as he ends the movement, his gun is already aimed at the intruder. He almost drops it though. The person who dared to sneak up on him looks exactly like him. Only the doppelganger is dressed ridiculously. Knitted jumper over a white shirt and is that a baseball cap?
Faces swim in front of him. Faces of people who are doing their best to prepare while he is doing nothing. Pepper buying a tiny black dress for her daughter. Bruce rebuilding their time machine. Clint and Sam cutting the grass and taking care of that menacing alpaca.
Her features are channeling an emotion which he can't name. It's not pity. Not even the universal pain the whole world seems to wear like the newest trend.
He looks down. His last project is in ruins. Broken, melted. His clenched fist sits snuggly between the pieces. It’s glowing red-orange.
Or watch out for Peter. He took it so badly. This is not something that the kid should be dealing with at such a young age. At least he still has his Aunt. But. He should be there. And what about Harley? The other youngling under Tony's broken wings? Who is taking care of that kid?
Widow rubs her forehead with a frustrated sigh. Just perfect. Stark and his restlessness. This can end disastrously. When did she sign up to be a babysitter? Seriously!?
He remembers the first time he met Rogers after that day. The former Captain looked shell-shocked as he wandered the corridors of their temporal shelter. However, as soon as their eyes met, the supersoldier broke down.
It isn’t anything resembling the time they lived together in the Avengers Mansion, sleeping just down the hall from each other and hanging out at all hours of the day and night in the library and TV room and the kitchen and the gym and the lab.
Tony blames the dregs of his disorientation for what comes spewing out of his mouth next. “They’re sleeping with me.”
“Getting some mixed signals here, Cap.” Tony feels light-headed, exposing his neck to give Steve better access.
(“What do I pay you for?” Tony complains to her. He feels pride that even in bumfuck Newfoundland, he still gets full bars. Stark-phones are the
“You’re wearing that?” Tony asks hoarsely, the wind expelled from his lungs like he’s just been sucker-punched.
“Hard standard you’re asking me to live up to here,” Rhodey says, an edge of plaintiveness in his voice.
“Not Commander Rogers,” Steve elucidates. He’s watching Tony’s reaction very closely, waiting for… something. “As of today, SHIELD answers to Director Nick Fury and Deputy Director Sharon Carter.”
“So, you’re really black under all this dirt.” The tiny black puppy barks and laps at the soapy water, then whines at the taste. Tony scrubs its back. “Doesn’t it feel good to be clean?” The puppy’s tail wags. “You good-” Tony lifts the puppy up for a look. “-boy. Who’s a good boy?”
“They’re asking about you guys. They wanna know where their heroes went. Don’t worry, I told them you both are living your private lives, retired from the hero duty. Nothing about Peter.” Natasha assured them.
“Wait, wait a second,” Rhodey interrupted. “Let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don’t we just find baby Thanos, you know, and…” the man trailed off, making a tying gesture with his hands around his neck.
Tony quickly got up. “Did you get the stones? Can we bring them back? Is he dead? Please tell me the universe is free from him and his ballsack of a chin.”
When Nebula made another goal, Tony said, "We're tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun." Nebula let a small smile sneak up on her face at her accomplishment.
Steve and Tony hugged and shared a kiss, and Steve picked up Peter, spinning him around, only stopping when he heard his son making noises.
“May!” Pepper laughed. “You’ve got to invite her over sometime. I’m surprised you haven’t told Tony. And you were going all off about him not telling you about leaving on his mission. Even though technically he tried to.”
Tony walked toward the small tent that Peter and Steve built together because Peter had a sudden interest in pretending that he was camping outdoors since his fourth birthday.
When he heard Peter’s even breaths and it was quiet enough to hear Tony’s small snores, Steve fell back asleep himself.
Happy looked to a smiling, but tired Pepper, and an unfinished sandwich at the table. “You’ll see. But only if you finish your lunch.”
“Did I mention that he started to imitate noises he hears about 2 weeks earlier than he’s supposed to? I’ve done my research, and he’s a little mastermind, so I think I have a right to be proud.” Tony pointed a finger at Natasha.
“Who told you that? I didn’t fight him. No. He wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the stone. That’s what happened. There was no fight.” Tony said. “He’s unbeatable.”
Bruce looked around and whispered back. “I have no idea! We’re talking about time travel here. Either it’s all a joke, or none of it is.” He looked back to Scott and gave him a thumbs up. “We’re good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I’m gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in ten seconds. Makes sense?”
“I trust you two to not ruin the kitchen!” Steve said from the living room where he started watching television.
Steve’s heart broke at the sight of Tony’s watery eyes, tears spilling and making their way to the white sheets of his bed.
“First of all, Pops doesn’t like that language, remember? Don’t make me call him down here.” Tony warned.
“Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. Today we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn’t mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we’re gonna win.” He shared a smile with his husband. “Whatever it takes. Good luck.”
Steve was about to go on a rant about how when Peter could walk, he’d show him how to actually dance to music, when their doorbell rang. The baby had jumped slightly at the noise, his brown eyes widening in surprise. Tony sighed, thank the gods that the doorbell hadn’t scared Peter enough to start crying. He hated seeing his baby in distress, and getting him to calm down could prove to be difficult.
“‘Cause I got some important shit going on here! What do you think?” Peter gave Tony a scolding look. “I just got something on my mind. Something on my mind.”
It's short, I know. I didn't have that much time and I really wanted to get it out. I'll start working on the next one asap, I promise.
The usually put-together man sighed shakily, leaning back into Steve. "Did everyone- the team, did they-"
The woman turned to see what he was looking at, and when she saw she sighed tiredly. Getting the boy to stay in one place and eat was hard enough without his fathers there. Now there was one more distraction.
“You love that story!” Tony argued. He pulled the blanket up to Peter’s neck, and kissed his forehead. “I love you tons.”
The hologram in front of the Avengers presented the Infinity Stones. Tony, Bruce and Steve found themselves pacing at the front of the table.
“Then it’s settled! As soon as your little man turns one, he’s going to have the time of his life with his new Aunt Natasha.” she crossed her arms.
“In the count of three. Three… two...one!” He pressed the same button, but instead of Scott appearing in front of them, a teenager did.
Pepper chuckled, smiling slyly. “I recall them telling me they tried you four times. You were probably asleep.” She turned to pour apple juice in a plastic blue cup. “Or,” she took the cup to the table and set it in front of Peter, then turning to Happy again, “you were busy with that nurse you met at the hospital.” Happy’s eyes widened, his cheeks going pink. It surprised Pepper, but she basked in his flustered state.
Natasha sat near the Compound, and she would be lying if she said she wasn’t a bit disappointed by the outcome of the time travel experiment. She believes in Bruce, but he was probably right when he told them he wasn’t an expert in time travel or the science surrounding it.
Peter nodded. “Don’t look!” He was sitting on the counter and holding a spatula, his shirt covered in batter.
Thor suddenly jolted awake, getting up. “Where to start? The Aether, first, is not a stone. Someone called it a stone before. It’s more of a...an angry sludge thing, so someone’s gonna need to amend that. Here’s an interesting story though…” Thor stumbled around, going on an adventurous rant that became pitiful at the end, mentioning black elves, Jane, his home, and his mother’s death. “-and oh, you know, Jane and I aren’t even dating anymore, these things happen though, you know, nothing lasts forever…” he seemed close to tears and Tony decided to guide him back to his chair. “No, I’m not done yet…” Thor argued. “The only thing permanent in life is impermanence!”
His fiancé changed the topic before they could keep talking about Tony’s ego. “We still have some chicken, rice, and caesar salad if you’re hungry.”
“And don’t worry if it doesn’t pan out. I’m just kinda-“ he stopped, eyes wide at what he’d just discovered.
Their 5 month old baby had started reacting to sounds a little early, and now he loved AC/DC as much as his dad. As small as he was, he could squeal pretty loud when he was excited.
. They wanted to be able to bond, and fix their relationship in peace. Tony had said he would talk to Pepper about their plans, and how she would be happy enough to take over without him there, as she was already the CEO. They talked about a lake house, a quiet life, a small, private wedding, and a child. Steve wished he could have recorded the look on Tony’s face when he mentioned a child. His face had lit up with a smile, his eyes already dreaming of it. It was a look Steve knew, a look of excitement, doubt, unsureness, and hope.
"We need to get to Steve before he can," Tony speaks. His eyes turn back to normal, and the glowing lines disappear too. "We need him if we want to save this one. And we need everyone if we want to stop him for good."
She looked between them with suspicion clear on her face. Her husband shifted from one foot to the other when she glanced at him.
"Threat is coming, this is why we are here," Nick spoke. She swallowed down her snort. Threat sounded understatement. She glanced at her male version. His grimace told its own tale too. Upcoming doom would have been better.
Pepper, looked at Strange and thanked him for her daughter and the five years that he had given her. That was it. The new perspective they all needed.
