The fumble and crash of tweezers and soldering iron would have been comical if Cas wasn’t already on edge. Dean’s eyes move to his. Cas isn’t fond of the protective eyewear he uses when soldering because they hide his face, but Dean flings them away carelessly before he can suggest it himself. His human stands and approaches predatorily. He turns the chair Cas’s spirit inhabits roughly, making him face Dean. Cas has to look up at him, and the disparity in height makes something squeeze in a chest that isn’t really there.
“I’m not comparing you to other humans, Dean. I’m comparing you to all other creatures that I know.”
His back seat is filled with defibrillators, stolen from a closed medical supply store. He might be a clueless, selfish asshole, but he draws the line at stealing life-saving equipment from a hospital.
Before he can make contact, he hears what can only be described as a heartbreaking sob. He can’t think about it for long, though, because the instant his hands connect with the statue, the sway of the boat becomes a solid floor.
He hears Cas laugh. It’s a kind, gentle laugh, but it still makes Dean look up. “You forget that I hear your thoughts when I’m in your head.”
Dean is ready to start his journey. Dean is going to show his family proof that they can’t deny. Cas has become quiet in the days leading up to his big reveal. Dean has insisted on practicing his portal jumps several times. He has to make sure that the real one, the one that matters, goes off without a hitch. He’s sure that Cas is just going to miss him while he’s gone, and that’s why he’s been so withdrawn.
Propping his feet up on the table, he picks out a few melodies before settling on an old Eagles song, Seven Bridges Road. He isn’t a fan of the Eagles, but they got that song right. He loves the galloping beat of the guitar and the harmonizing that he can’t manage with a single voice, but he can still hear it in his head.
“Me, too.” Dean’s tone is as lewd as his thoughts, but he doesn’t think his angel picks up on it. “I just wish that you weren’t just to look at. I wish I could touch you.”
“Everything. Everything you’re showing me.” His angel is writhing next to him, muscles clenched and needy. Dean is trembling, holding himself back, knowing that Cas isn’t there even if his form is.
Dean jerks awake from his lengthy contemplation. That’s it! Cas isn’t trapped because of the stone, he’s trapped because he is devoid of the energy that must fill his body for him to function. Dean whoops and hollers and bangs his free hand on the roof of the compact car, celebrating the huge breakthrough.
Dean could give the flippant answer, but Cas is nothing if not earnest, so he wants to repay him by being the same. “Honestly, it’s the way we’re made. Our bodies are programmed to want sex as soon as we’re old enough to procreate.”
“Never! Don’t be ridiculous.” Cas looks as offended as he sounds, which allows Dean to continue breathing. That was the worst case scenario that he could think of. Everything else is manageable.
“You were serious about that?” Dean is glad there is a screen between them. Otherwise, he would have punched his little brother right in the face for being a smug prick.
“I hope you don’t mind that I’m in your space, Angel,” Dean mutters. He’s tied a rope around his body that is also secured to the porch of his cabin. He doesn’t trust an anchor because he could easily drift right into the statue, and while he wants to know how it makes objects disappear, he doesn’t want to be the guinea pig.
“Yeah, Cas. Exactly like that. Later on, when we have some experience together, there will be times when we will get lost in wanting each other and we’ll have rough, frantic sex.”
“Name what?” Cas replies from his place on the porch. He has been sitting on the floor, hanging his legs over the edge since Dean started his preparations.
Cas gives him a secretive look. “It was supposed to be a surprise for you. I guess now it’s just breakfast for you.”
“Oh, shit. Cas. You’ve been inside of that thing for thousands of years?” Dean can’t keep the dismay out of his voice. He can’t imagine being held immobile for hours, let along for centuries upon centuries.
He envisions Cas crawling up his body, dropping kisses along the way. When he pictures Cas grinding down on him, the projected version of him huffs out an agonized sound.
He sits up and has a difficult time making his vision make sense. The statue is gone. It’s not in pieces, it’s simply gone. There might be some debris under the water that he can’t see, but he doesn’t think so.
Dean realizes that he can’t ask Cas for anal sex at this point, but he’s almost desperate to feel Cas sink inside of him. He clenches his internal muscles in an effort to satisfy the urges, which only makes them worse. His angel’s hands seem to drift unerringly to the places that drive him mad. He is thumbing his cheeks apart, plumping them, and even running a finger down the crevice between them.
The creature is gaining on him again, the swooping sound of it swinging from plant to plant sounding like his death knell. He doesn’t want to die here.
There is a long pause before the vision says, “Fine, Dean. If you don’t want to tell me, just say so.”
“Can I kiss you, Cas? I’ve been wanting to do that since the moment you arrived on that bizarro world.”
His angel has never looked this pissed off, and Dean hesitates to speak. With eyes of blue flame, perfect jaw biting back curses, Cas advances on him. “Did you really just tell me not to go anywhere?”
“Castiel,” Dean moans and closes his eyes. His hand grips tighter on himself and he pulls slowly, making the sensations linger.
He brings his cup of coffee out on the patio and sits down to observe. Clyde is absent, but he usually is in the morning. The fish are back, he notices. They can’t help but bump and jostle the lily pads and grasses as they feed on the bugs and larvae. Nice. That’s a disgusting thought that might just put him off fish for a while.
“I’m not happy. I’ve been living a life that’s a shell of what I want, but doing this is a start. Coming here, following my heart and listening to my instincts. It’s a damn good step in the right direction. Everyone in my life thinks I’ve gone off the reservation, but I know I’m on to something.”
He trips over the sheets he’s twisting around himself and because he didn’t let go of his rapidly deflating erection, he falls directly on the side of his face.
Cas is lying on the bed next to him now, just a few inches from his own body. The only reminder that he’s not really here is the lack of body heat radiating from him. Dean turns closer into him, as close as he dares. He doesn’t try to touch him because he can’t imagine breaking the illusion right now.
Dean ends the song and switches to another in honor of his latest epiphany. Being a simple man is a whole lot more peaceful than he’d ever realized.
Dean turns the water off and grabs his towel. “Well, it isn’t an intellectual thing. It’s an emotional and physical thing, so it’s difficult to explain without experiencing. But I’ll try.”
He swallows around an uncomfortable knot of emotion. “Sorry. Dad and I were arguing about moving into management and he said something kind of heartless. It just got under my skin.”
Cas wouldn’t cut off communication with him if he was just angry. He’d be lighting up all the neurons in his brain, berating him for being an idiot. He knows this because it’s happened once or twice already. Okay, at least a dozen times, but the point remains. This silence goes deeper than anger.
In response, Dean plunders his mouth, aggressively taking and ramping up the intensity lightning quick. He licks into Cas’s mouth, and his angel groans at the contact. Nipping and sucking on Cas’s lips, he leaves them both breathless and filled with lust when he breaks away. Cas’s eyes are a blue-rimmed black, and he whimpers at the loss of contact.
“Cas?” he calls immediately as he tries to roll down the window. Of course, he can’t make it budge, but he keeps yelling for Cas.  The other window is equally useless, so he looks up and sees the sun roof. Raising his foot up to the ceiling, he kicks the small pane of glass out of the way. When he pops up through the roof, he sees Cas’s spirit on his porch, his arms crossed over his chest, and a look of overwhelming sorrow on his face.
Cas peeks into Dean’s mind again, just to be sure that he is no longer suffering. “Are you okay, Dean?”
Towering above him, his pursuer appears. It has been moving through the dense plants, hanging securely by several limbs of varying lengths. Its skin is darker than any color Dean has seen. In fact, the glow of the vegetation seems to bend in unnatural ways when it gets close.
In the morning, Dean makes passably edible pancakes with a shaker bottle and his last bottle of water. For his first night, he feels pretty good about roughing it. He has been camping a hundred times, but this is different. He’s going to not only be living out here, potentially for months, but working, too.
The human gives an exasperated gesture with his eyes. “I knew you wouldn’t believe it. I don’t know why I thought you might even try to think beyond the textbook.”
When Dean clicks the key to discharge the electrical pulses, the entire sky goes brilliant white. He is glad that he had put on protective glasses and shut his eyes because even so, there are white tracer spots forming behind his lids.
“Cas, this is amazing!!” He rolls out of bed and rushes to his small architect’s desk. Grabbing a legal pad and a pen, he starts jotting down ideas for how to adapt this knowledge so that it is usable by humankind. “It’s so elegant and simple.”
His first task is to set up a pulley system from the materials he brought earlier. There’s no way he’ll be able to get the heavy generator out of the boat otherwise. The power tools he uses capture the interest of the intrepid gator, and he comes uncomfortably close to check out what Dean is up to.
There’s no cell service out here, but he has added a satellite Internet connection so that he’s able to reach the outside world and use the KU online library for research. Tying up the boat, he uses his newly constructed ladder to carry the samples into his lab. Now that he is keeping electronics and scientific equipment in his cabin, he’s made the interior climate-controlled. He’s blowing through his savings at an alarming rate, but if anything at all comes from this project, it will be worth it.
Dean has been hurting Cas, over and over again, and he just let him. Why? What would possess him to let Dean have the power to destroy him and not tell him?
As the man works, Castiel hears him hum little bits of song. The beautiful man surprises him again with such a rich, melodic voice. Is there nothing this man can’t do?
Amid the staticky feedback, he hears the word shelter. “No shit, Cas. Of course I’m looking for shelter.”
Clearing his throat, he nods and looks up at his friend. He lets the entire conversation come out, and watches the familiar protective rage appear on Benny’s face. “How could he be so callous? Does he not know how devastated I was when he left?”
“It’s a fantastic ass.” Cas admits and gives it a firm squeeze just to hear Dean squeak. When he also gasps, Cas takes advantage and plunders his mouth. The deep, wet kisses go on for dizzying minutes, escalating their need for each other back into the stratosphere.
He chuckles and shrugs. “I hope so. I mean, that’s why I’m setting up out there. I need to know how that rock disappeared and I need to know where it went.”
He has already started a list of essential improvements to the shack. He needs to patch any holes the local inhabitants are using to let themselves in and put in an airtight window. He needs a heavy duty water filtration system immediately because he’s not taking a shower in swamp water, and he’s definitely not going to drink it or cook with it. A small air conditioner would make everything so much easier.
Their mental connection gets stronger by the day, so he isn’t surprised that he can pick up on Cas’s feelings when they are strong enough. There is a definite tint of embarrassment coming across the line.
Castiel is understanding more and more of his language. He got enough to know that his human’s name is Dean. Sammy is the one on the box. Dean is working here, studying him. The other human was not happy about it. He needs just a little more time to get the nuances.
“Not feeling this way all the time.” Cas is fidgety and flickering, his connection to his body, for lack of a better word, frazzled by the lust he’s obviously feeling through his connection to Dean.
He isn’t sure why he believed that these men would be reasonable, that they would take his demonstration as proof, and work with him to create a bold future for transportation.
Cas shakes his head while staring at Dean’s lips, which are settled in a smirk. Cas pulls him back in for another deep kiss, this time with him taking the helm. Dean adjusts the angle of their heads, but other than that, Cas is a quick study. Dean finds his knees going weak when Cas grips the short hair on the back of his head and pulls. A hiss slips out and Cas ceases everything full stop.
Dean had explained the complex banking systems to the best of his ability when they were first getting to know each other, but Cas hadn’t thought about them since. He flies back to the cabin, pulls Dean’s wallet out of his pants’ pocket, and takes out the shiny plastic card. In a breath, he is in New Orleans. Dean had raved about a little bakery in the Quarter, so Cas seeks it out, a smile on his face at doing something entirely for his Dean. Inside, the sweet smells welcome him.
When the tip of his finger rubs delicately over his hole, Dean sucks in a surprised breath and huffs a curse. That touch feels a little too targeted to be an accident, so he makes eye contact to figure out what Cas is up to. There is a spark of electricity that shoots through them both at the desperation and desire arcing in the tiny amount of space between them.
When the first pulse hits him, he whispers Cas’s name. His angel whimpers and then his mouth drops open.
Cas pushes forward, breaching Dean’s miraculously softened and stretched opening. His eyes are burning with lust and confidence, and Dean has never seen anything sexier in his life. “I’ve watched your fantasies and dreams for months, Dean. I know what will please you.”
Cranking up the generator gives Dean a sense of satisfaction that he hasn’t felt in ages. He spends most of his days in an office rather than a lab or garage now, so the only work his hands get is typing. Getting dirty and using his hands to solve problems are the primary reasons that Dean has forgone several promotions. He doesn’t want to be management, no matter how adamantly his father insists. In fact, this is the exact topic that started the fight that brought him here.
“No!” Dean stops him before he completely disappears. “Don’t go, please. It’s an expression. I meant that I can’t stop thinking about you.”
Actually, there is one thing that he could do for Cas. He could actually solve this puzzle and give the angel his freedom.
Well, that answers that nagging question. Souls are definitely on his angel’s kink list. He can’t say that he is disappointed. He might be a lowly human, but there is something about him that Cas finds desirable.
“You’re welcome, Dean.” Cas takes a long, last look at his lovely human. First at his beautiful face, and then at the radiant soul beneath.
Dean forgets the awkwardness and gives his cock a few light strokes. Cas moves closer and sits on the edge of the bed which shocks Dean. “Are you physically here?”
“Come on, Dean. I don’t know what nonsense you and dad are fighting over this time, but it has nothing to do with me.”
“When, Dad? When will I have the time? I see the hours you and Granddad work. I lived my childhood thinking that we were the second most important part of your life. I don’t want that for my family.”
Benny had warned him on his last trip into town that his purchases and deliveries had garnered some attention from some less than upstanding locals. He’d suggested keeping a gun and reinforcing the lock on the rickety door. Dean had done one better. He’d installed a high tech metal door with a retina scanner. The alarm system inside would alert him immediately if the windows or door were tampered with, and he’d bolted and locked the generator and filtration system to the cabin. Let those rednecks come after what was his. They’ll be sorry they tried.
“Dean, perhaps we got started poorly. I do not want any information that you are not willing to give.”
“You and me both, Cas.” Snapping himself out of the distracting closeness, Dean turns all business. “Why don’t you get back to yourself so that we don’t separate you.”
The return trip through the statue is horrible. He feels stretched and tenderized like a cheap cut of meat. It doesn’t help that he lands in the swamp face first. Thankfully, Clyde isn’t there to worry about. Just the snakes and leeches. Fucking fantastic.
He’s heard music in heaven, of course, and even on earth, but those sounds were barbaric screams compared to the resonant beauty of Dean’s voice. Castiel listens enraptured while he plays and sings. Dean’s heart is heavy, and this is soothing for him. Castiel is having a difficult time staying angry with him. This creature can’t be harming angels. He hopes his assumption isn’t naive, and based solely on his strong reactions to Dean.
His old friend rubs a thumb over the corner of his mouth while he thinks. “This is all just a little crazy, Dean. I didn’t think my fairy tale was going to keep you here in town. Not for research.”
“It’s nice, but what about this?” Dean adds his own erection to Cas’s, the soft, slick foreskin rubbing along his head. It is sinfully good, and then Cas adds the motion of his hips to the equation. Everything feels more. Better. Fucking amazing.
Especially because all of his cuts from the bizarre forest are now letting in who knows what kind of bacteria.
Dean keeps his distance from the stony angel; tying his low, little boat to the porch railing of the ancient fishing shack nearby. He couldn’t believe his luck when he’d checked on the ownership of the tiny building. The owners were long dead and no one else had bothered to claim it. Forfeited property goes to the county, and it was the work of an afternoon to contact the right person in the right office. Now, Dean Winchester is the proud owner of a barely livable shack in LaFourche Parish.
“I can’t, but do you really think that you can? Do you really believe that something is going to come of this?”
“Son of a -” Dean’s overwhelmed brain does its job and sends another jolt of adrenaline through his body. He’s off the bed and out the door, his shotgun in his hand. Pointing it out into the bayou, he strains to see any shadows that shouldn’t be there.
The snide look on his father’s face makes something in him snap. This man is supposed to love him. He’s supposed to want the best for him, and yet time and time again, John Winchester has done nothing but put him down, push him away, and laugh at his failures. How could he believe that this is what love looks like?
“Dean, if it’s none of my business, tell me so and I’ll shut up, but please don’t lie to me. We’ve been friends way too long for that.”
He doesn’t even know what equipment he will need because he knows nothing about the statue other than objects disappear when they get too close to it. That’s not a lot to go on, he knows, but where he differs from the rest of his family is that he believes it’s enough.
He hears impressions of words, but nothing solid like it was earlier. Is Cas going in the wrong direction? Could he be getting further away?
Dean shakes his head, and climbs out onto the roof. “No, I didn’t give them anything. Well, almost anything. Nothing they can use anyway.”
Dean lands on a mossy ground, not in water. He takes two very rapid breaths before he looks up. “Oh, fuck.”
That is one of the innumerable reasons that he loves Cas. He always knows when Dean’s getting lost in the probable future, and he inevitably brings him back to the present, asking only that he be with him. He has no expectation that Dean should be working on solving the problem of his imprisonment. He would rather they play chess together or listen to Dean read or play his guitar.
Dean could feel his eyes getting heavier, his body dropping loose and relaxed to the ground. “You called me ‘sweetheart’,” he grins dopey and slack.
Cas offers a gentle smile as he takes another few steps. “I’m great. I’m better than I’ve ever been.”
The sleepy scent of Dean is his favorite perfume, even with the not so fresh morning breath added into the mix. He wants to do something nice for Dean, maybe make sustenance for him. He pads down the hall into the kitchen and tries to remember how he had watched Dean cook. The gaps in his knowledge are too big of a hurdle, he realizes with a frown. He can fly to any place in the world, though.
The booming voice comes out of nowhere, shocking Dean into panic. He screams, and then the next five things happen all at once. He tightens his grip painfully on his dick, turns away from the voice, which is everywhere, opens his eyes wide to locate the intruder, sits up, and tries to cover himself. The result is similar to watching a frightened animal try to extract itself from a net, and just as bound for success.
“Cas, please! I can’t.” Dean is completely out of control, twisting and writhing and screaming for his help. Cas feels more helpless now than he ever did inside that stone prison.
“You are shaped differently than my vessel. I am surprised that you had such specific thoughts about what this body should look like when it is different from your own.”
He’s not in the bayou. He’s pretty sure that he’s not on earth, either. The air is heavy and it smells oily and pungent. High above him, there is an abrupt end to the atmosphere, where it looks like unctuous waves roll. It reminds him of being underwater, but he’s definitely breathing air.
Dean scowls at the statue, looking it directly in the eyes. “I wouldn’t have to keep guessing at what propels objects out of the air and where it sends them if I knew the answers, now would I?”
Thankfully, he didn’t have to make the choice. After being trapped and left for dead for eons, heaven was only too willing to let him fill his remaining days here on earth. He might have insinuated that it was the only way that he wouldn’t actively try to do damage to heaven, but still, he’s content that they didn’t put up the kind of fight they are notorious for.
“Okay, Cas. Here we go.” He doesn’t feel the typical buzz of Cas in his mind, but he chalks it up to nerves. “I love you, angel. I’ll see you soon.”
“Yes,” Dean murmurs as he grips himself tighter, picturing the lovely pink mouth wrapping around him. Blue eyes pin him while he swallows the rest of Dean’s cock. He moans low and throaty, his mouth dropping open. “Oh, shit.”
“This has nothing to do with Devin,” he snaps, and can’t help but meet Cas’s eyes over the top of the screen. His angel’s brow is furrowed. He taps the side of his head and pushes thoughts to Cas. “We’ll talk about it in a minute.”
Cas growls and pushes him back onto the bed and crawls into his lap. Dean sits up and kisses him with abandon while he wraps himself around Dean. Chest to chest, Dean nuzzles into his jawline with his nose, lips dragging along his neck. There isn’t a part of Cas that isn’t his ideal. He is the epitome of desirable and Dean is lost to the perfection in his arms.
Dean shakes his head. He’s not surprised to hear his dad’s thoughts parroted back at him through his brother. He’s often thought that Sam was a puppet for John Winchester to use to control him.
Dean isn’t afraid of the crowd of reporters gathered from news agencies all over the globe. He isn’t worried about what he’ll say to them. He isn’t concerned at all if they’ll believe the shocking revelation he’s here to deliver. The only thing that he’s fretting over is how this moment is going to change their lives. One thing he is sure of is that they will never be able to be anonymous again. They are going to completely change the transportation industry overnight.
Taking Dean’s hand in his, he interlocks their fingers. The exchange of their life forces is flowing now like a tidal force, tangling together in Cas’s body and then flowing like a wave into Dean’s. The movements of their bodies are almost inconsequential, an afterthought now that they are connected at this elemental level.
He wasn’t teasing Cas about wanting to go slow. Part of him really does. The rest of him? The rest of him is ready to throw Cas down on his bed and take him apart with just his hands and mouth. If his gorgeous angel presses him too hard, he isn’t sure that he will have the willpower to keep to his convictions.
“Hmm?”  Cas has been staring at the side of his head for close to an hour. He’s been building a circuit board out of tiny components for some reason that he didn’t bother to fully explain to Cas. The soldering tool he’s using is causing a weird flurry of smoke to puff up between his hands. Narrowing his eyes, Cas realizes that there’s just one thing that will rip Dean’s attention away from his task.
Having only the fireflies for company got old fast, so he’s taken to reading out loud after dinner. At least once a night, his neighbor, who Dean’s named Clyde, shows up around the edges of his light source.
He looks around, in and outside of the cabin. There’s no sign of him. Dean stops moving, closes his eyes to concentrate. “Castiel? Can you hear me?”
Dean wants to argue. Cas can see the fidgeting in his body, but he fights through it and simply nods.
“You might not, but I definitely do.” The human sputters in response and takes Cas’s cock in his hand. “If you want to put this inside me, lube is necessary.
Castiel watches the thick, pearly ribbons of come jet out of Dean’s sex and onto his stomach and chest. He isn’t sure where the impulse comes from, but he wants to lean over his human’s body and lap up every drop. He’s still feeling the heat, the chaos of pleasure, and it slips into sated, content happiness.
Castiel wants to console Dean, wants to reassure him that his eyes are seeing him. But he isn’t sure if he would be ready for the intrusion. He’s heard that it is quite jarring for a human to have an angel speak to them. He doesn’t want to add to his misery.
“You were staring at my ass like you wanted to take a bite. Totally pervy.” Dean crawls back into the narrow cot, arranging himself around the sprawling man. A few bumped elbows into foreheads and ribs aside, he slips into place quite nicely given the limited space.
Dean has been working on taking the defibrillators apart and re-wiring them to work together for the entire day. He has already planted the tall posts into the bottom of the bayou, hammering them down with some truly impressive swings of the mallet. As an extra precaution, he added braces of wood so that none of the posts could slide from their mooring and fall into the statue.
Reeling himself back toward his cabin, he sings a song under his breath. As the days have worn on and he’s run out of chit chat, singing has been a way to fill the quiet. Before this trip, he’d really only sung in the shower. He’s pleasantly content with his singing voice, not that he would ever sing in front of other people. The angel and Clyde don’t complain, though, so he serenades them frequently.
The soft edge to John’s voice is gone instantly, “Dean, I was letting this nonsense go on because I felt bad for what I said in the lab. But I’m done coddling you. Get your ass back home and back to work, or you might just find yourself without a job.”
“You don’t want to kiss me?” The pouty lip confirms Dean’s guess. Cas is a lot better at playing human than he lets on.
The more he puzzles over what that difference could mean, the more he believes that it could be his first viable clue. After a simple dinner of a burger and homemade fries, Dean brings his new guitar out on the porch with his nightly beer. Well, the guitar is only new to him. He’d found it at a thrift store when he’d been looking for some used dishes. Paper plates were wasteful and it wasn’t like he had curbside trash pickup. Whatever he brought into the bayou had to be hauled back out again.
Sam rolls his eyes and moves the laptop into the conference room and puts it in the corner of the table next to him. He’s sure that the proximity is just to make sure that if things get out of control, he can shut Dean down quickly.
“Never mind.” Dean sits back down on the bed, completely flummoxed and reeling. He drops his head in his hands to think through the past few minutes. The voice gratefully lets him process in silence.
“How is it that you’re so huge and so strong, and you can’t break out of stone? Even the strongest rock can’t possibly be stronger than you, right?”
“Cas!” Dean shouts as his body erupts in unexpected release. Cas continues the long strokes into his body, feeling the squeezing pulses around his erection milk him of his own release. As soon as Dean’s cock is spent, Cas grins. He knows something that Dean isn’t going to expect.
It’s the first time that Sam has stood up to his father in any capacity. He receives a look that could melt steel in return. Sam just clears his throat and looks away. Okay, so that didn’t last long, but it’s still a start.
“What do you want?” Dean asks gently, which leaves Cas gaping and blinking at him. With a smile, Dean pushes his mouth closed with his index finger.
When he pushes forward, that confidence wavers. The compressing heat is marvelous, but it is the connection with Dean that takes his breath away. Part of his body is buried inside of Dean’s, and it makes his new heart hammer in his chest.
There are a handful of seconds that pass, Dean’s heart beating so loud in his ears that he can’t determine if it’s over. And then suddenly, Dean is hit by a force that he can only equate to being knocked into the air by a moving car. He keeps his eyes shut, at least until he blacks out.
Sam huffs in the way that Dean remembers from when Sam was a kid. It makes him want to laugh and shove all of this work nonsense away. When was the last time they talked about Sam’s life? When was the last time they talked about Eileen? Are they trying to have kids yet? Dean is shocked to think that he works with his only brother and he doesn’t really know anything about his life outside of the office.
“Cas, I’m never leaving you, I just don’t want you to get overstimulated.” Cas lets go and lets Dean get about a foot away.
“Are you seriously going to throw your career away because I hurt your feelings? I didn’t think you were that much of a princess.”
“Just joining the meeting, Sam. I can’t be there physically, so I’m conferencing in. I’d think that you’d appreciate the modernization.”
He puts clothing on his body with a thought, cleaning and grooming himself back to immaculate. He remembers at the last second that he needs to bring something to pay for the food. Modern humans have come so far. They hadn’t even figured out bartering when he was last aware of them.
Dean takes cautious steps forward while Cas does the same. “You’re okay? That explosion scared the shit out of me.”
He’s kept himself so busy since he arrived in Louisiana that he hardly thinks of his body’s needs. Tonight, though, he needs the release. Once he strips down to his boxers and flops onto his bed, the sneaky little insinuations and desires from his brain get his attention. He runs light fingers over his chest as he thinks of what he might want in a lover. Devin had been a complete deviation from his typical type. That should have been a red flag, but hindsight and all that. So, he builds his dream man from snippets of men he’s admired in the past.
Dean shakes his head violently, banging the heel of his hand into his temple. When he speaks, “No” is the only sound, and it is on repeat.
“No,” Dean shakes his head. That’s a great perk, but that isn’t what has truly captured his attention. He gestures between them. “This…magic. Is this always the way it is with angels?”
Dean blinks awake and the first thing he realizes is that he’s looking up at the roof of his cabin. It’s daylight, which it hadn’t been when he was knocked out. Cas!
They get as close as they can to each other, a mimic of a kiss. They can’t connect, but it still sends a thrill through Cas. “I hope this works.”
So, he tentatively peeks into the man’s space, watching as he prepares food. The device he uses inside contains heat without fire. Interesting. He had always thought humans were the most ingenious of all creatures, even more so than angels. It seems he was right.
“No one.” Dean pushes more thoughts to Cas, hoping he is still listening. “Would he be able to see you?”
Dean rubs a hand over his mouth. “You know, John, it’s that kind of thinking that makes you a dinosaur. You could be staring at something revolutionary, and you’d never know it because you have no imagination and no curiosity.”
A quick smirk flickers on his lips and his pupils dilate. “Would you like me to describe it for you?”
By his calculations, he’s been locked in this mineralized hell for over ten thousand years. After the first few excruciating times that the Gorgons used him as a portal, he knew that it would be futile to fight his fate. Instead, he had locked himself away in his mind, shutting out the world around him for millenia.
“But, this feeling is eating me alive, Dean. Don’t you feel it?” Cas is panting, crowding him against the wall.
Cas looks down at him and seeing his gorgeous Dean at his feet makes him feel powerful in a way he’s never experienced.
Or potentially worse, what if they did find a way out of this trap and left him here anyway? No. He might have been rebellious, but his fellow celestial beings didn’t harbor him any ill will. They would have returned for him if they’d been able to. That is the shred of hope he must cling to.
Laying here with Dean curled around him, giving him his devotion and care, is undeniably worth dying for. He would choose to be with him, despite the cost, each and every time the choice was given.
“I don’t know. This magic is alien to me. It came from the Gorgons, who were not made by the same creator.”
Cas sags in relief, though filled with confusion. He’s never heard of a situation like this before. Even in the rare occurrences throughout time when angels and humans have been together, there has never been a documented case of a human soul wanting to stay with the angel’s grace.
The blue eyes pop up to meet his, wonder and interest are evident. “I’m sorry, Dean. I thought it might offend you to discuss your sex organs.”
“I’m doing research. Me being here has nothing at all to do with you or the company. I am on sabbatical doing a personal research project.”
Seeing the tears in Dean’s eyes forces him to relent. He can’t be the cause of his sadness. “Okay. Okay. I won’t give up, Dean.”
When the song ends, Dean leans his head back against the little home and just watches Castiel. Tears are in his eyes, but they don’t fall, nor does he make any outward acknowledgment of them. Stoically, he sits. As desperately as he wants to know what is bothering Dean, he refuses to listen in right now. That would be going too far.
Dean is exhausted and his sides ache. Calling him wrung out is a kindness. Still, he is disgusted with himself. There isn’t anything he can do to make it up to Cas except go back to the bayou, fall on his knees, and beg for his forgiveness.
Dean doesn’t mention Cas’s origin story again for a few days. He isn’t in the mood for another power display if the angel becomes agitated again. He is sitting on the porch after dinner, strumming on his guitar when a stray thought causes him to stop.
He opens the call to his dad’s office and smirks when his father squints into the screen. “What in the hell are you doing, Dean? We’re about to step into a meeting. You know, the one that you’re supposed to attend?”
“What made you think of that, Cas?” Dean’s voice is low and purring, a tone that only comes out when he is aroused.
Looking up into the eyes that look porous with erosion at this distance, Dean smiles sadly. “I’ll bet you were something to behold in your glory days. You’re still fierce and awesome.”
The bubbling motor of the john boat pushes Dean through the massive Cypress forest in the bayou of Southern Louisiana. This is the fourth trip he’s made today, so he’s relying less and less on his GPS, and more on the subtle landmarks that guide him to his temporary home. The next turn is marked by a fallen log, suspended at an angle by its neighbors, which he has to duck under in order to make it to the last leg of his journey.
“Several ways, and I want to show you every one.” Dean is losing the rhythm, close to the climax already. He’s pretty sure that just watching Cas be pulled under by what he’s feeling would be enough to make him come. The sight is breathtaking.
“I’m glad you’re enthusiastic about the idea, though. I wasn’t sure if you would freeze me out like the last time I asked about angels.”
“Cas, I’m so sorry. I was stupid and selfish. I didn’t stop to think about what I was doing, what it would mean for you.”
“I know, angel. But you’re in a human body, which is complicated and intricate and unique. What I liked about you tugging on my hair was that it felt like you were losing control, like you wanted me so much that you got carried away. That’s incredibly sexy.”
Cas leans over to reach Dean’s lips and run fingertips over his cheekbones. He is so beautifully made. There isn’t anyone or anything in the universe that Cas would prefer to look at.
“I can’t leave you in there, Cas. I can’t stop searching for a way, not when I might be able to get you out.”
Dean blinks up in amazement at Cas as he processes the concept. They are linked together, as close as two beings have ever been. It’s everything he didn’t know he needed, and he suddenly has to kiss the breath from those lips and merge them in every possible way. Cas whimpers into the intensity.
He nods and is about to shut his laptop when a Skype window pops up. It’s Sam, and he hasn’t talked to the kid in weeks. He looks up at Cas with a raised brow, and he nods his permission to answer while he’s there.
The hesitant pause sets his teeth on edge. C’mon, Sam. Spit it out. “Some of the projects you’ve taken on have been bizarre, Dean.”
Cas huffs at the cheesy line, but lets Dean cozy up to him anyway. Dean kisses down the column of his neck, letting his hands roam over his back.  “You don’t ever need help getting my attention, though. It’s yours, every minute of every day.”
“I must truly be a sucker for impossible relationships. I move out here and start feeling something for a hunk of stone.”
Pondering the possibility that this human is using him as a portal makes Castiel furious. How could this obviously enlightened age still use and abuse another being for travel. There are so many easier ways, as he tried to convince Euryale, the Gorgon who turned him to stone.
Standing toe to toe, Dean can finally feel the heat of his angel’s body mixing with his own. He can feel his breath on his face. “Can I touch you?”
Immediately, Dean’s entire body feels like it’s fresh off the factory floor. He can’t feel any of the signs that he’s actively living in his body. His mouth isn’t dry; there’s no sweat on his body. It’s pristine, in never before used condition. “What did you…”
“Wonderful,” he mutters, climbing down the ladder and into the boat. “So are you going to join me on my shrimping expedition?”
Dean’s brow furrows. He’s going to miss Cas, too, but it will only be for a few days. For someone who’s lived since the beginning of time, a few days shouldn’t cause that kind of drama. He shrugs it off. He has to catch his dad and Sam while they are in their weekly board meeting. He’ll talk to Cas later.
The look on Cas’s face makes Dean take a step back. “Okay, that’s not a good one. How about ‘Port Chester’?”
The substance looks vile, but he hears the swooping behind him getting closer, so he dives forward. The landing knocks the air from his lungs, but he can’t stop until his entire body is in the burrow. Dragging and pulling himself along the mossy ground stirs up more tiny creatures that push some type of bioluminescent fog into the air. Blooms of it rise and swirl together, shimmering like gold with vivid pink underneath.
The images come more easily now that he has filled in so many details for his fantasy man. He grips the sheets that are bunched near his groin, filling in the thought of his fingers fisted in raven dark hair. He pushes his hips up to meet his grip, grinding against it shamelessly.
Dean opens the heavy metal door and guides Cas through it. He looks around as if it was the first time. The angel has been inside the cabin dozens of times, but it must seem so different now that he’s able to use all of his senses. Even in a human vessel, there is something ethereal and otherworldly about Cas. He seems to glow from within, his movements are graceful, and he is the most beautiful sight Dean has ever seen.
“Oh, it’s no worse than it was before. I can take a human form for decades without feeling compressed, as you called it.”
“Why wouldn’t it be? I love you to the very depths of my being, Dean. Why is sharing this secret more than giving you my heart?”
Digging into his eggs, Dean contemplates the dreaded statue holding Cas hostage. “I’ve been doing some thinking,” he begins.
His first thought had been to test whether or not the statue put out any kind of electromagnetic reading. It didn’t. He had then tried a Geiger counter, an infrared sensor, and even a gas chromatograph.Honestly, he wasn’t above using any and all instruments that might give his research any type of direction. Nothing had yielded the slightest reading or abnormality.
For the next several days, Dean works on the problem with singularity of purpose. Working alone most of the time, he is trying to will an answer into being by brute force. He’s not sleeping, eating junk convenience foods, and getting himself worked into a foul mood.
He’s never been in such a hurry to get somewhere and so frustrated by how slow human technology is. He laughs bitterly at the irony.
“I know,” Dean pants, jerking himself while watching the beautiful muscles of Cas’s body twist and buck against nothing. “I would give anything to get my mouth on you, sweetheart.”
“Why? I want you. I want you so much.” Cas is practically climbing his body as he tries to get Dean’s clothes off.
“Hey, hey, hey. Cas. It’s okay. I’m going to stop you right there, because that was a very happy sound.” Dean knows this is going to be a strange concept for the newly corporeal which is confirmed when confusion clouds Cas’s features.
“Science? Dad, science is all about inquiry. Asking ‘what if?’ You’re all about playing it safe and profit margin.”
Dean has already set his notes aside when Cas appears. “I think I smelled that before I heard your wings.”
He shouldn’t have brought this knowledge here. They will exploit and take until there’s nothing left. He swallows hard.
“Mmm,” Dean hums, nipping at the thick tendon on his neck. “Have you thought about my lips wrapped around your cock, Cas?”
When he shifts his perception to look at the human’s soul, he goes weak. He has never seen such pure radiance. It is the colors of creation, the shimmering consistency of magic, and luminous like the stars. It is perfection, and this human holds it within him.
“The hydrogen project made sense, but the others…and what you’re doing now? It’s straight up crazy.”
Castiel is horrified that Dean is cowering away from him. “Oh no. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, my light.”
“I might be able to get you out of there if I have all of the information, Cas. Do you really want to hold out on me?”
Dean’s solution to the distance issue is to build a structure of posts all the way to the cabin for the wires to attach to so that he’s not at risk of electrocuting himself or the entire bayou. He’s gone over the procedure numerous times, and they both feel that it’s as safe as possible.
When the human’s eyes lock on him, his words uttered directly to him, Castiel desperately wants to understand him. This language is similar to other human languages in its form, but it isn’t one that existed before he slept. He will need to hear more of it before he will be able to decode it. It feels like a shameful waste that his words are falling on what might as well be deaf ears. He wishes that he could gather them up and save them for a time when he can understand them.
The next day dawns despite the mere minutes of sleep that Dean was able to cobble together. He couldn’t get past the idea that he was being watched like a medical experiment. In fact, Castiel had been watching him for a while, from the sound of it. How else would he have picked up English so fast?
Dean spends the next couple of weeks working on the shack that he’s taken to calling a cabin now that it has some truly luxurious amenities. When he installed the filtration system, he had replaced the flooring and upgraded the shower. He called time of death on the ancient stove about a week in, and now has a little convection oven that he can cook real meals in. Tonight, he is going to enjoy his homemade cassoulet out on the porch table he built out of reclaimed wood.
Letting the thoughts flow over him, he tries to find patterns. He hears a few of the same words repeating. Sam. Benny. Dad. Angel. Clyde. Devin. The last one is always accompanied by sadness. It might be a name? Castiel continues with his study for hours. The man sits with a small, shining box and taps on it at odd intervals. Looking closer, he sees that each square has a symbol on it. Is this their language? He gets even more excited when he notices that when the square is pressed, the same symbol appears on the top of the open  box. His mind reels at the realization that humans are communicating at this level of sophistication. How far can these messages go? How are they sent?
Luckily, the car went into the water at an angle that kept them above the waterline and dry. Dean had to swim for the boat, which was still where he’d left it, and then retrieve all of the portable electrical devices. Cas isn’t sure what his human has planned, but he’s going to trust that he knows what he’s doing. It’s not like the statue came with a manual.
“Dean, stop!” Cas is frantically trying to grab Dean’s hands and hold them away so he can’t do himself any more harm.
It’s only a few days into their new venture when Cas can feel Dean thinking about his brother, Sam more frequently. He doesn’t mention it because Dean doesn’t, but Cas is compelled to fix whatever is bothering him.
There is an awkward pause between them that Dean fills with an unspoken desire while he worries his plump bottom lip. Cas hears it drift through their connection and is eager to comply. He appears in front of Dean and receives a very suggestive smile. “Hey there, angel.”
Dean can’t find it in himself to say no. He should, but he wants it too much. He just nods and is leaning over the bed to reach his practically full bottle of lube, when Cas stops him. “I don’t need that.”
“Of course, Dean. I would be happy to meet anyone important in your life.” Dean gives him a shy smile.
Thick, polyp-like, glowing plants wave to a rhythm he can’t hear or see. Reminiscent of anemones, they make him cautious of getting too close in case the similarities don’t end with their shape.
“Dean, come sit with me for a while,” Cas says from outside the cabin. Dean opens the door and sees his angel sitting at the table. Reluctantly, he leaves his work behind and sits. Cas gestures to his guitar, which had been left there forgotten.
“What’s wrong, Cas?” He shakes his head where it is buried against Dean’s neck. Dean pulls back just enough to see Cas’s face. His eyes are huge and fixed. His lips are parted.
Watching his father’s face fall is almost as good as the shock from earlier. Dean shakes his head, pushes the hand from his body and grabs the door handle.
“If you follow the path I’ve set for you, you can tinker to your heart’s content on your personal projects.” Dean thinks that John’s volume must be directly related to how much of an idiot he thinks Dean is.
He drives through the afternoon, past sunset, and into deep night with only the music on the radio for companionship. His mind doesn’t drift from its purpose even once. He’s approached this problem from several angles, but he’s never contemplated that it might be his grace that was powering the portal. From a biological standpoint, he must be made of cells, or photons, or a similar building block. Those cells require energy to function. If grace is being tapped, it might be that the cells are frozen because they are deprived of their energy.
All around him, there is a whirlwind of movement and a cacophony of noise. Men jump up from their chairs, papers are dropped, glasses get knocked over. Through it all, Sam sits frozen, his jaw hanging open.
“Okay. Sure. I’ll talk.” He laughs nervously when another shriek sounds. “I think something here wants to eat me, Cas. I’m out in the open.”
“Who’s there?” he yells from the floor, trying to sound menacing while upside down with his ass in the air.
He encourages Cas to move while his hips begin to lift as a counterpoint. In a few dragging thrusts, their bodies are trembling, the tension ramping up faster than Dean can believe. Their eyes don’t break from each other, despite how close they are and how hard it is to focus at this distance.
The joking takes a little of the sting out of the memory, but it’s mostly out of habit and it’s a balm for other people, not for himself. He swallows hard against the thought of his ex and shoves him out of mind.
Dean searches Cas’s face and then calls him up to his arms. They kiss gently and nuzzle into each other’s soft spaces. “I’m afraid that when I’m not being fueled by your angelic battery anymore that my very human body is going to be hurting. We should probably exercise a bit of caution until we understand this better.”
Dean had hung his head, not wanting to show the pain in his eyes. “Ah, you know. I needed to take Baby out and stretch her legs,” he said with a shrug.
Cas responds by pulling Dean into a firm embrace. They sag into each other, burying their faces into each other’s necks. Dean moans at all of the sensory input he’s receiving. The scrape of stubble against his, the silky strands of hair sifting through his fingers, the strong hands holding him like he is the most precious thing in the world, the scent of sunshine, damp forest, and rich spices.
When he loses his footing, he staggers into one of the pillowy plants. Its surface is sticky, reminding Dean of sap. Immediately, his skin burns. The predator reaches out with one of its dozens of appendages and just before it can wrap around Dean’s arm, he pushes back to his feet and keeps running. Feeling a throbbing sting, Dean looks down to see the sap changing color and pulsating. Underneath, his skin is turning a deep red. Dammit, this stuff is trying to digest him. He swipes it against the only thing he knows he can trust; his shirt.
The gator blinks, but Dean gets no further response. Not that he expected one from the giant reptile, but he was hoping for some type of acknowledgment. Dean goes back to creating the framework for the pulleys, but this time with his back to the building instead of the water. He doesn’t want to take his eyes off his new sidekick, even for a second.
Dean rinses off and throws a towel around his hips again. He gets up close to his angel’s spirit before he murmurs, “Better?”
“True. Come downstairs and eat. I’m not getting in that bed with you later if there’s barbecue sauce on it.”
“You’re going to come really soon, so I don’t want you to fight it. It will be your instinct because it feels like losing control. Just let it happen. I’ve got you.”
Dean feels the tightening in his belly, the lift that occurs right before the fall. “Oh, Cas. I’m gonna come. Pay attention, angel. This is the good part.”
“Freak out? I haven’t freaked out.” Dean’s scowl is over the top, but he loves to banter with his angel.
Dean dives into the water, hoping that he isn’t about to go from surviving a car wreck to becoming alligator chow. He pulls himself up onto the porch in record time. He’s sloshing around in his clothes and he is fairly certain there are water grasses and algae tucked into some fairly uncomfortable crevices, but he’s closer to Cas now.
The flattened human makes a sour face. “I don’t think it’s fair to assume what reaction I would have to an idea.”
The fire pit and mosquito netting, Benny’s suggestions, help keep the little swamp angels away while he enjoys the company of the only angel he’s interested in. There’s no entertainment out in this wilderness, so Dean has been checking out and voraciously reading books from the Port Fourchon Library.
Just like always, it escalates from a simple disagreement to screaming without even meaning to. Dean knows he’s saying the words, but his dad never hears them. When he doesn’t get his way, his father stops trying to resolve the conflict and instead tries to win at all costs.
Intense blue focuses on him like a laser. “Yes, please. Dean.” Cas pleads with him, but his voice trails off as Dean thumbs over his frenulum. Now that Cas is in his head, he stops teasing and gets down to business. He uses all of his best tricks to get himself off.
“I have it in me?” Dean drops a hand to his chest and immediately raises is again with a hiss. The raw wounds are agonizing to touch. He still can’t believe that he did this to himself. He’s never felt that kind of raw desperation before.
For the first time, the sound Cas makes isn’t melodic; it isn’t heavenly. It sounds like he’s actively choking on his tongue. Dean chuckles and flips Cas over, much easier when the angel isn’t fighting him at all. “Sit up against the pillows, sweetheart. I want you to watch.”
Dean continues the languid strokes, waiting for Cas to make up his mind. Finally, he feels the tickle in his consciousness and sees the responding pleasure break across Cas’s face. His eyes slip shut as he mutters what must be curses under his breath. They’re in a language that Dean has never heard, but it sounds ancient and foreboding.
“Uh, Cas? When someone reveals their most intimate parts to you, a response is appropriate. A nice one would be particularly welcome right now.”
“Damn, I wish you could feel my touch. I would blow your mind right now.” Dean licks his lips and tells Cas to hold his erection out and still.
“Let me give you some space,” Dean tries to step out of his reach, but Cas is having none of it. He pulls Dean back to his chest.
Cas watches the clench of Dean’s jaw tighten with every word his father speaks. He would love to have a corporeal form right now just so he could punch Mr. Winchester right in his smug mouth.
Is he really going to do this? He’s cautiously settling into a slouch that shows off his body to its best advantage. Cas’s eyes haven’t left his, so he slowly untucks the towel and lets it fall open. Just having the audience, this audience, is enough to have his cock filling in record time. He isn’t sure how to respond when the expression on the angel’s face doesn’t change.
“This information is what caused the eradication of my species, Dean. Can you understand why I might be a little protective of it?”
The instrument he plays is beautiful, but again, it is Dean’s skill that makes it so. Dean keeps singing to him, a haunting song filled with regret and longing. “Why don’t your eyes see me? Could it be you’ve found another game to play?”
“Yeah,” is his sheepish reply. “It sounds really good to me. You might think my soul is pretty, but that laugh could bring me to my knees, Cas.”
Shrimp tastes better anyway. One of his first weekends down here, Benny had come out to check on him and they had followed the bayou out to its natural conclusion, and then continued out into the Gulf of Mexico. Benny’s boat wasn’t much bigger than Dean’s tiny one, and neither of them tempt fate by going too far out in the ocean. Benny had taught him how to cast and haul in a net, how to make the fish meal concoction that the shrimp go crazy for, and even how to shell them and get them ready to freeze.
Benny wouldn’t get close enough to the angel for Dean’s taste, but he had to know if he was on the right track. Looking around in the bottom of the fishing boat, Dean grabbed a beer bottle.
Over a few too many beers at Benny’s favorite local bar, they had caught up on their lives since graduation. Of course they are Instagram friends, so they have kept up with their mundane, everyday lives. Dean is a firm believer that it takes being face to face with a friend to get into the epiphanies and existential truths that are changing their paths in life. Those kinds of talks are rare and priceless, and it was during one of these heart to hearts that Benny gave Dean the first shred of hope that he might just find an entirely new type of transport.
“You know that and yet you continue to get closer?” Cas isn’t too angry yet, but he’s definitely stirring up the air. The hairs on Dean’s body are all standing up like they’re rubbed by static electricity.
Cas sputters in indignation, but Dean rolls out of bed and wanders into the kitchen area. Cas is fascinated by him walking away, his beautiful ass bouncing. When he bends over to grab a bottle of water, Cas croaks out a pitiful sound. Dean glances over his shoulder with a wink.
Dean feels the breeze on his skin before he can finish the sentence. A lop-sided grin eases onto his face. “Why didn’t you do that in the first place?”
“I don’t feel comfortable with that,” Dean reiterates. He’s been shocked at quite a few of their ideas. He’s skirted away from some of them, and outright balked at others. “I’m not going to put the statue at risk like that.”
Dean scowls. “Why are you just telling me now? I’ve been trying to discover how to use them since before you first talked to me.”
“Can’t you just clean it with your mojo thing?” Dean asks as he follows the delicious smells downstairs. His mouth is watering.
He wakes in a rush, sitting up and looking around for some clue of what had happened during his drugged slumber. He’s near a little light source, but he can’t make out what it is. Across from it is a man, who’s turning his way. Holy shit. It’s his fantasy man. His jaw drops open, and his mouth dries up. He can’t speak in front of this mesmerizing vision.
“Of course I care, Cas.” Dean paces a few steps and then returns. “Is there a way to get you out of there?”
“Fuck, Dean!” Cas grips the back of the chair with hands that aren’t really there. The sound of his angel cursing and lost in lust makes him mightily pleased.
Dean can’t stand the pitying look on Benny’s face, so he shakes off the wallowing and gives him an impish grin. “So, tell me about life in the bayou.”
“It would make you happy to have this great discovery? To prove to your family that you’re not crazy?”
Dean comes out of his home, this time with something wooden in his hand. He sits on the edge of the outside floor and crosses his legs in front of him. He plucks his fingers along the metal strings, and the sound is exquisite. After a few more, he adds his voice to the mix and Castiel is mesmerized.
Before he feels any response coming, Cas is standing there at the end of the bed. Dean sighs and gives him a flirty grin. “You chose this form well, Cas. You are gorgeous.”
“So, where are we?” Dean asks as he and Cas walk through the mystifying landscape. One of the planet's suns is coming up, and most of the sappy, glowing plants have curled in on themselves, leaving a much wider path. Cas is searching for a weakened spot in the fabric of spacetime, which is way above Dean’s pay grade, so he just follows the angel. He’s enjoying having the time to commit Cas to memory while he has the opportunity.
“You’re just saying that because I saved you from another fall on your face during sex,” Cas teases. Dean throws his head back to laugh, which makes his soul blossom and expand even while it is still mingled with Cas’s, and it spreads between both of their bodies. Cas can’t help but join in his mirth.
“I…suppose it is, yes.” Honestly, Cas had never thought about it before. It was just the way that he traveled. Thinking of the various ways that humans must rely on to travel, he can see why they would find his ability incredible. They’d probably do just about anything to have it. He ignores the proverbial red flags in his mind, and he chooses instead to trust Dean.
He’s pleasantly surprised to find that he isn’t too badly damaged, so he immediately reaches out to his brothers and sisters to discover their fates. He receives only soul-crushing silence. Every other angel that was captured with him is gone. There were hundreds of them scattered over the globe. How can it be that they are all gone? Is he truly the only survivor?
Every time Dean has approached the statue, he’s been just as awestruck as the very first time. It towers over him even as a great deal of its height is wedged into the muck under the water. The look of agony on the face is unique and heartbreaking. He can’t imagine why an artist would choose to render such a painful expression on an otherwise beautiful creature. There is a palpable energy coming from it, a hum that buzzes under Dean’s skin. Benny hadn’t felt that energy when he brought Dean here. He’d clearly been uneasy around the statue all the same, though. It had surprised Dean, especially after his friend’s less than concerned reaction to the very live gator.
Dean catches the look on his father’s face, and it makes him wish that he had a camera. He is gobsmacked, flabbergasted. It is a beautiful thing to render John Winchester speechless. He doesn’t even interrupt when Dean continues the meeting without his input.
A worse thought tickles at the back of his brain, but he refuses to acknowledge it. Not yet. He can’t start down the path of doubting himself and his own senses. For a man of science, there is no greater fear than losing his faculties.
He stops speaking when he hears the most delightful sound in the world. Cas is laughing. Not a huff of amusement, not a little chuckle. His head is thrown back and he’s belly laughing.
Cas grins and touches Dean’s forehead with two fingers. “I’m not suggesting that I do anything to hurt you, Dean. I’m telling you that I have a better solution.”
John’s face is halfway to apoplectic. He yells for Sam and gestures toward the screen. He only hears the words “handle it” before his father walks away to press the flesh with his cronies.
“Cas, please! Please. You have to be there. I can’t do this alone. I don’t want to be alone here. I don’t want to be without you.”
“Look, Sam. I know that you weren’t in on this round, but the fight isn’t why I’ve gone radio silent. I’m working on something that I know for a fact that you would scoff at. Just thought I’d save myself the pain.”
It might have worked, this slick used car salesman voice. It really might have, if Dean hadn’t grown up with John. “Now you call me son?”
Apparently, the local police aren’t as impressed with his ethical stance. He has a few cruisers following him, bathing him in the red and blue of guilt. He’s heading for the nearest Louisiana town because there’s no way he’s going to lose them on an open straight away.
“Oh, god,” he says with dread, horror at his actions follows close behind. He can’t keep the bile down this time. He launches himself out of the car and falls to his hands and knees. The sickness erupts from him. and for the first time in his life, he doesn’t wish it away. He deserves this.
“You’re an angel?” He walks to the point of the porch that is closest to the statue, suddenly wanting to feel the buzz of proximity.
Most people wouldn’t take too kindly to friends giving them less than four hours to announce a visit, but like always, Benny was all smiles and welcoming hugs.
“Dean, when was the last time you dated?” Sam asks it quietly, like he doesn’t want to rile up his lunatic brother, but the fact that it even comes up snaps the last straw.
Over the past couple of weeks, Dean’s constant companion has been the voice in his head that he is now somewhat certain is not a figment of his failing mind.
The fireflies are dancing in the distance, seeming to explore the new open area where the statue stood for ages. It would be beautiful if he wasn’t so lost. Cas would appreciate the view, which makes it all the more painful. The pristine little lights edge closer to him as the minutes pass, and soon they are mobbing the entire porch. They’ve never ventured anywhere near the cabin, so Dean can only take this as a sign. As the pin pricks flicker for him, he lets out the first sob.
He trails off again when Cas kisses him. The kiss is chaste and simple, but it affects Dean like the filthiest and raunchiest of them. He squirms beneath Cas, who has rolled to lean over him and lift his legs around his hips. Dean moans to feel Cas line himself up along the crevice of his cheeks. “How-how do you?”
The breath blows out through Dean’s lips, along with a moan. Resting his head against Cas’s, they both breathe harshly. “We might have to take the edge off after all, Cas.”
Immediately, the human scowls. “You just ruined so many thoughts I had about the heavens being filled with little cherubic winged babies.”
Dean puts on his sunglasses and baseball hat and shakes his head. “I can’t believe you learned to speak English from listening to me.”
Dean steers his aggravation away. He can’t be upset with any assistance at this point. This mess is his fault. Several yards ahead, he sees a frothing foam. “Can you see? Is that it, Cas?”
“I’m looking for new methods of travel, Sam. Would it make sense to look at the things that already work?”
“So, what brings you down to the edges of the country on a Thursday morning?” Benny had finally asked after a day of hard work at his fabrication shop, a delicious dinner of shrimp etouffee, and a few beers out on his porch.
