"Didn't tell you to be a host, just put her up on the couch for a day." Dean clapped a hand on Castiel's shoulder and strolled back outside.
"Hang on a sec." Layla stepped away to grab her jacket and then unlocked the door. Dean Winchester grinned at her.
Bobby said, "Definitely infected. Dean, you got the- yes that." He took a bottle and gauze from Dean. Wetting a sheet of gauze he dabbed at the wound. Layla flinched.
She blinked and her eyes returned to normal. Dean though was staring at her with a crook in his smile.
He reeled, holding his jaw. Layla lunged in, hitting him a second time. He smashed through the table.
"It's what it sounds like. Do you think you're the first people to think just because you've got experience it makes you different? My first partner was a human. He died bloody at the hands of a demon. And he was experienced, in his fucking prime. I've seen good people crushed, shot, burnt, hacked up and torn to pieces. You are not special."
The god laughed victory. "No worries, handsome. You're a bit old for my taste, but I'll get to you eventually."
Layla rolled to her feet, burn marks already fading. She twisted her hand in a throwing motion. Dean's knife jumped off the dirt and sliced through the plant holding him upside-down. He fell back down with a grunt.
Layla turned on her toes and slammed her fist into the guy's face. He sputtered and fell out of his chair. His beer broke as it bounced off his chair onto the floor.
"Hey, take it easy," Bobby protested, snatching the bottle out of her hand. "This is no time to be getting drunk."
Layla started to laugh, but it quickly turned into coughs. Once the fit passed, she answered, "That was my wife, Amelia. You would have hated her."
"Like I got wasted last night, but fine." Layla pointed with her thumb at Castiel. "Angel hands hurt like a bitch, but after a bit of rest and alcohol, I'll be back to normal."
Layla scooped up the stake and charged. The god started to turn, throwing off her aim so she struck his shoulder instead of his heart.
Layla muttered, asking to be put down. Dean stepped around a cluttered table and laid her down on a couch that smelled like smoke and beer.
“I guess I kinda deserved that.” He sighed. “Look, honest truth? My little brother, he figured out he was ace recently, but he’s a sophomore in high school and...it’s been rough for him. I just...you're the only other ace person I know, and I thought...I thought you might be able to help him. You know, if you don't mind, of course." Dean finished quickly.
Dean spent the next day distracting Mom and Bobby from how absent Cas and Sam were as they researched; Bobby was definitely giving him some looks, but let it go, while his mom was more oblivious. Not that it was any sort of chore for Dean to spend time with them; he hadn’t realized how much he had missed their company until he was back home.
As Valentine’s Day rolled closer, Dean was struck with a brilliant idea. He had a bunch of extra cash from working in the garage; why not buy himself a little treat? Despite his nerves, he visited the local mall with a mission in mind – a visit to Victoria’s Secret.
Cas blinked. That was not the tack he had expected, so his answer came out more bluntly than intended. “No.”
After dinner, while Dean was helping Bobby and Mary clean up, Cas pulled Sam aside. “Is everything okay?” he whispered.
Dean snorted. “Probably for the best. She didn’t even like pop art – pop art, Cas! Guess I should’ve taken that as a sign and broke things off earlier,” he sighed.
Castiel paused. This was not the direction he had expected, but… “Yes, Dean, your dating history has made that pretty clear.”
“Hey, hey,” Dean comforted, grabbing his hand and interlocking their fingers. “I can take some parental nastiness.”
Dean was nodding and humming in all the right places, but he wasn’t fully listening – listening enough to pay attention, but he also couldn’t stop thinking about how nice it was to see Cas so happy, so talkative. If it wasn’t about art, Dean had such a hard time getting Cas to talk to him; but now, now Dean had a secret weapon. And he was going to use it as often as he could.
Cas shook his head rapidly. “Yes, definitely different rooms, you distraction you,” he replied, flapping his hands in Dean’s general direction. “Now shoo.”
Cas sat and stared as his mind spun with possibilities. Finally, he cleared his throat and Dean’s eyes whipped up to meet his.
Cas hugged her back, tears prickling at his eyes. “I…yes, that sounds wonderful,” he replied after clearing his throat.
Bobby grunted. “I taught them how to play, and I definitely didn’t explain it that way, but next thing I know, these two idjits have started talking like that, and…”  Bobby shrugged. “You get used to it.”
Currently invisible inside the old Men of Letters bunker the Cupid snuck down the winding hallways. He phased through the closed door, sneaking into Sam Winchester's bedroom.
“C’mon Dean. You know it’s the right coordinates. This is where she said to meet up. Might as well knock.” Sam cajoled from the passenger side, before reaching for the side handle.
Chuck eyed his son, not denying the accusation. But what Bertie had shown him wasn’t how he wanted this story to end. And clearly his future self didn’t want it to end either. He had seen his own choice of sending her back this far, unknown to her. He had seen that he wanted to change what had been happening but had been too late and powerless to stop it. He had seen his own Death.
The older man, scruffy and wearing a beat-up and well used baseball cap kept his shotgun trained on her. He narrowed his eyes at her choice of curse. The other man, much younger than the first backed up just far enough so she could shift on the ground into a sitting position.
“It’s our home.” Her response was simple and heartbreaking. Dean’s gaze caught hers. She blinked and cleared her throat. “We’re legacies. Great grandpa Henry was a Man of Letters. This was one of their main bunkers. In a few years, you guys will meet him. That part hasn’t changed. He was the one to lead you both here the first time around.”
Gabriel shouldn’t have been so surprised that Sam’s verbal beat down on his idiot older brother worked. He had put his faith in Sam fucking Winchester to stop the apocalypse, of course the moose would have been able to get through to his brother.
Castiel tensed as his superior glanced around mockingly. He scoffed. “And yet I don’t see our brother anywhere. He’s still locked in the Cage. Forever. All because we lost the key.”
“I’ll tell you guys later. Let me show you your rooms first. I know you probably want to rest after you drive down.” Bertie had no idea why she was acting like a nervous hostess. She already knew that the brothers loved this bunker, that they would live here and have a family here for years to come.
After returning to Kansas a little bruised and banged up, Bertie was able to get holed away in her future-old room at the bunker. She spent all of one day using her mojo to snap things clean, preparing for her family to eventually move in. Including stocking the kitchen with several pies to bribe Dean if need be.
Castiel decided to step into the fray. Stepping closer to Dean, he placed two fingers on the man's forehead, healing his injuries and cleaning him up of the blood staining his clothing. Changing what was clearly a sensitive subject, he asked the hunter. "Why were you hunting demons?"
The door swung open, revealing a short man –average by non-Winchester standards- with golden, whiskey eyes. On the surface he looked like a plain man having just got home from work as a custodian. That wasn’t what Bertie saw however.
Automatically, the Cupid marked the younger hunter. Sam. Sam Winchester. At least he got that one correct. But it also meant that the arrow meant for Dean had been used on a former angel of the Lord.
He realized his mistake almost as soon as he went to check in to the motel. The clerk working the night shift turned out to be a demon. A demon who had friends. Friends who knew how to contact Lilith.
They arrived in a blink, Bertie transporting her Dad and uncle in a snap. They made their way through the headstones, weapons at the ready. In the middle of the abandoned cemetery stood Michael, impatient and pompous as always, fidgeting with his blade.
Dean narrowed his green eyes. “To be fair, we don’t have to trust you. You appeared out of nowhere, claimed to be mine and Cas’ kid from some future that’s falling apart at the seams.”
Dean stared up in disbelief at the dilapidated building. It was in the middle of nowhere and looking worn down around the edges. Graffiti decorated the cement walls and broken bottles lined the side of the cracked driveway. There was no way that this was the place Bertie wanted the hunters to see. He drummed his fingers along the ridge of Baby’s steering wheel, debating whether he should turn the car around now and head back to Bobby’s.
I want to know why you two mud monkeys were able to divert the apocalypse. I want to know how you did it. I want to know how one little seraph was able to be resurrected. I want to know who
“I wasn’t talking about Gramps. You know, God. I was talking about Father, my father. Castiel. He needs to hear this too.” Closing her eyes, she sent out a prayer, bypassing angel radio, for Castiel to come to Bobby’s.
The fallout from learning Castiel had been killed by his own superiors had not gone over well. Losing a friend was never easy, losing Castiel was even worse. Gabriel going full on Archangel on them in retribution however did make a slight dent in the pain.
Jumping down from the hood of the Impala, Dean started gathering up his empty bottles. He avoided Castiel’s penetrating gaze. He didn’t have to see it to know that he was doing that stupid head tilt of his when trying to understand something inanely human.
Slightly expositional chapter, but necessary. Spoilers if you haven't watched season 13. Bertie is from a different timeline, but I'm blatantly using things that happened this past season. Beware of feels...
Long after Sam had gone to bed for the night, Gabriel slipped away, invisible, to check on the other occupants of the bunker. He found them alright. In Dean’s bed.
“If I can’t get Cas to respond, he sure as hell ain’t gonna come when Sam prays to him.” Dean said snidely.
For the first time in eons –quickly turning into a bad habit since Bertie arrived- the Archangel Gabriel used his grace to heal one of the Chosen One’s.
play if Cas had bothered to get back to him the past couple of days. The angel hadn’t been answering phone calls or prayers. Dean hated to admit it, but he was worried about the blue eyed angel.
"The life I've lived gave me the right. My Gramps gave me the right. My older brother helped. Besides if Gramps is behind my decision to change this... Well I'm going to do it."
? Overall, it sucks. Maybe it’s time to grab on to what little bit of joy we can. And for you? Dude, that’s Cas. I want you to be happy Dean. Why don’t you want that for yourself?”
"Killing Ruby." Dean's brow raised at Bertie's bluntness. "That bitch is great at hiding when she needs to, but she needs to die."
Her green eyes met his. Slightly bashful she ran a hand through her short, black hair. "Yeah. I Marty McFly'd myself. Didn't mean to go back this far though. But maybe..."
"We aren't gonna tell you anything until you start talking." Bobby narrowed his eyes in an intimidating glare. He had set the shotgun down on top of the table, exchanging it for the open beer he had been drinking before she appeared.
Gabriel was surprised by his attitude. The moose had gone to college after all. “What? Is two men making out disturbing you? I thought you were more open minded than that, Samsquatch?”
Dean hung up the phone, stopping his brother's judgment midsentence. He sighed with relief. He turned to the couple sitting next to him in the bar. "Thanks for that."
“Dean?” Sam opened the door to his brother’s room a few minutes later, expecting him to be either drinking or sleeping. He was surprised when he saw Dean rushing around the room in a panic, packing one of his duffel bags. Clothes were tossed in, weapons carefully stored in the canvas bag. “Hey man. What’s going on?”
Cuddling the dog to his naked chest, Sam glanced down into the golden eyes. A sense of familiarity hit him, pulling him deeper. The corgi licked at his chin, happy to be held. Sam choked back a wave of loss. He had never told anyone all of his thoughts about the menace they once knew.
"You just did it because your 'daughter' told you too! How do you even know she is who she claims? Huh? She could just be another big bad demon herself." Sam argued, giving voice to the thought that they had all had at some point during the past day.
“Uriel? Why have I been summoned?” The blue eyed angel eyed his brother warily. They weren’t meeting in one of their usual spots. Instead Castiel had been called to an abandoned amusement park, long forgotten by the humans who lived nearby. The rusted Ferris wheel was overgrown by the forest trying to reclaim it back into its natural elements. Shoots of ivy and wild grape vines inched ever higher around the dilapidated structure.
After an unknown amount of word vomit, Dean just buried his face in his hands. “Please say something and put me out of my misery,” he moaned.
“Joanna Beth! I think Cas has some very good points that you may want to think about,” Ellen scolded, appearing over her shoulder.
Rowena shrugged. “This is a high school play, darling – not many options for those who can step into the leading man’s shoes once all the other roles are filled.”
When Dean heard about the Arcimboldo painting exhibit that was coming to the National Gallery, he was delighted. “Mom, Mom, we *have* to go! And we gotta bring Cas, he’d love it!!”
Dean pouted, but brightened when Cas promised to make them to the best of his ability in the dorm kitchen at a later date.
And to Castiel’s surprise, Dean proceeded to sing, almost perfectly, every single song Link sang in – including the ones where he only sang parts of them.
After Zachariah stormed off, the festive atmosphere slowly returned, even if Cas could feel everyone sneaking glances at him, trying to see if he was really okay as he said he was – but, surprisingly, he really did feel fine. Not even just fine – he finally felt free. His parents were finally out of his life, and his grandmother was making sure that little fact wouldn’t mean having to drop out of school; it didn’t get much better than that, right?
To which Charlie cackled, “Define good!” and the rest of the group groaned but quickly settled in. As Cas made to go sit away from the table – away from all the rowdiness, observing from a distance – Dean touched his arm lightly. “Do you want to try watching from here?” Dean asked quietly, gesturing to the seat next to him, still empty despite the closely clustered group.
Cas’ smile morphed into a smug smirk. “Get used to it,” he teased as he sat up. “And we should get to researching…maybe in different rooms,” he added quietly as he stared at Dean’s full-body stretch.
“Awww, that’s it?” Donna pouted as Jody scooped a decent-sized but not all that large portion of sweet potatoes onto her plate.
“What?” Dean blurted, whirling around to face her. Mary wiggled her phone at him, the time prominently displayed.
This year, both Dean and Cas were taking art history. They both loved it, even if Cas had to help Dean memorize all the dates and years and names that they covered.
“Oh.” Mary replied blankly before hugging the boys again. “That’s – really great, kids, I’m happy for you!” She then stepped back. “This means a celebration! Let me head into town and get something nice, the fridge is pretty much empty here,” she laughed into the sudden awkward tension. Dean and Cas took that as their cue to escape further into the house.
Sam and Cas both turned to look at him, as his chuckle had come at a rather dramatic moment. “Just a funny thought, guys, keep watching,” Dean quickly explained, so the other two turned back to the screen. Cas took the opportunity to snuggle a little bit closer to Dean, and Dean felt incandescently happy. His family knew about Cas and nothing had changed; nothing, absolutely nothing was going to ruin this night.
“Neither did Castiel,” Sammy smirked. “Gabriel’s probably an audio learner, not visual like you, and it didn’t even occur to him that a new actor might need a different method of learning. Talk to Castiel about it tomorrow – ten bucks says you’ll have the choreo down in no time.”
Dean scarfed his lunch in record time and asked to be excused, running straight to his room and locking the door behind him before pulling the box back out from under his bed.
Sam sighed after they all let go. “Now I just need to tell Mom. Any ideas how best to do that, Bobby?”
“My only cousin,” Cas explained. “She’s only a couple years younger than we are, but she’s…recently had some friction with her parents. If she reached out to me, it was bad – and I’d rather her be somewhere I know is safe.”
Unfortunately, the boys were old enough to have strong opinions of their own – and they did not want to move to South Dakota with their mother. They wanted to stay at the same schools, keep their same friends and their same rooms in the same house.
She whipped around to see a nasty smile on her uncle Zachariah’s face. “Well, well, well – wouldn’t have expected you to succumb to such base desires, niece,” he chided. “Unless, you have an explanation…?”
It became a pattern, Lee dragging him into corners and kissing him senseless, but neither boy ever really talked about it. It just kept happening.
For those of you who are reading on...this is my first attempt at writing anything like this, so please keep that in mind >_<
Finally, on the last day of school, one of the guys got Lee in a headlock and wouldn’t let him out until he told them *something.*
Cas shrugged. “Here in town, maybe. But you could attract out-of-towners much more easily with a proper web presence.”
Dean sighed and smiled reassuringly. “Cas. If sex is not something you want, then I’m not going to pressure you about it. I mean, I might end up getting to know my right hand a lot better, but – I want to make you happy the way you make me happy. You, not any specific thing we do together. As for messing up with we have together - if it helps, I’ve now dated two of my friends and gone back to friendship afterwards pretty easily. On the off chance we break up, it’s not going to be enough for me to lose having you in my life.”
Cas had been about to meet Dean for dinner when he heard his phone ringing. He immediately answered when he saw the caller ID. “Claire?”
He was almost certain she had no idea her older son wasn’t completely straight, and he wasn’t so sure how she’d react to the news that Dean was definitely not. Taking Cas home to his mom as his boyfriend would be…a huge step. One that he couldn’t come back from. And if his mom reacted badly…he was stuck dealing with the fallout all break. Although, he and Cas could always escape to Bobby’s for the remainder of their time off, should everything end badly. Not that it would, but…Dean couldn’t help worrying.
Dean. Link is a leading role, you have a hell of a lot of lines and choreography and plenty of other little things to learn. This is not something that can be squeezed into a couple hours.
He had to admit, his previous solution of just – not thinking about Lee only worked until the name came up again; now that Lee was back in his thoughts, haunting him again, he…couldn’t forget. And he had no other defenses. Maybe Sammy was right, maybe talking about it, purging some of his feelings would help.
Krissy and Claire kept talking about FMA until the warning bell rang. “Hey, give me your number?” Krissy asked as they pulled out their phone.
So the next chance Dean got alone with Sammy, he took it. “Anything you want to talk to me about, Sammy?”
He eyed it carefully before taking a sip. It was…surprisingly good. Thick, milky and sweet. He took a longer sip and sucked up a sphere – which was chewy and sweet. “Okay, this is pretty great,” Dean admitted, taking an ever longer sip.
“Too bad, Cas – we should get up early so your cousin and her friend don’t have to face Sam and Bobby on their own.”
“Yeah, he’s being a self-sacrificing idiot, which means any brother-to-brother confidentiality goes out the window until he snaps out of it. Dean’s gotten it into his head that you’re interested in dating – other people. Not him. And so, he doesn’t want your closeness with him to scare anyone off. That’s why he started acting so weird.”
Dean could always tell when his anxiety was starting to get out of hand and distracted him with a movie night, or an evening out with Charlie to discuss character ideas for the next D&D campaign. Cas always made sure Dean knew how grateful he was for the quiet intervention afterwards.
Mary quickly swept him into a bone-cracking hug. “Maybe so, but as your mother, I have the right to request hugs. I carried you for nine months, kiddo, not to mention – ”
“I know, and I feel bad, but – it would be un-Christian to leave Claire alone, on her first Christmas without her family, and – and perhaps I would be able to convince her to see the light, renounce her sins and come home!” Cas lied.
And if it wasn’t for Bobby, maybe he never would have. Sam’s logic and his mom’s attempts at understanding fell flat because – as much as they loved him and really tried to see where he was coming from, Dean was at a point where he just couldn’t explain anything properly and didn’t have the energy to try and meet his family halfway, no matter how much he needed to. Sam and Mary needed Dean to reach out to them to help him; Bobby came up with a different solution.
Dean turned away as Cas went silent. His little brother was probably spilling his guts (and Dean’s. Mostly Dean’s, in fact) and the little shit was going to pay later.
His mom smiled at him. “You think so? I can call Irene, see when she and Cas might free to come with us…”
Cas growled. “Those things may be important, but so is my time! It’s *my* responsibility to whip him into shape now, and that is going to take more than a random schedule based on his whims and limited free time!”
“Alright, alright,” Charlie called. “Don’t be jealous of Dorothy’s skillz with the dice, Dean, it’s not a good look,” Charlie chided, leaving Dean sputtering.
“So,” Dean continued, deciding to change the subject before Claire got any more ideas, “don’t suppose you’d be willing to tell us why you two are here and not home?”
Claire nodded silently, awed. The Adler-Novak Thanksgivings had always been quiet, formal affairs, not much beyond small talk and an elegant dinner that never seemed to actually fill your stomach.
Cassie smiled. “Sam’s harmless; the worst he’ll do is pepper you with too many questions. Which, if he does, just set Mary or Dean on him,” Cassie confided. “As for Bobby…his bark is a hell of a lot worse than his bite. He’s gruff at first, but I think he’ll warm up to you two quickly. He probably won’t come over until tomorrow, though, you won’t have to worry about him for a while,” Cassie continued quickly as Kaia visibly grew more nervous.
Dean rolled his eyes as Cas fairly leapt into Mary’s arms, always up for her maternal affection. Mary gave him a good squeeze. “Don’t worry, Cas, we’ll take good care of them,” she whispered in his ear.
Dean was so focused on crushing his (cheating) little brother into the ground that he didn’t give Cas knowing the secret burger recipe another thought until they were actually sitting down to eat. Then he continued to hold in his indignation until Cas had mostly finished eating; after which Dean started his interrogation.
This is Castiel, previous understudy for Link and apparently your new teacher, god help me. When would be a good time to do our first run-through of the script lines?
And then there wasn’t any time to think, with the whirlwind of costume fittings, performing on stage for the first time – performing with fellow actors instead of just Cas – but Dean took it one day at a time and the next thing he knew, it was opening night. Sammy and his mom were in the audience, hopefully his team had been joking about showing up too, and Cas – Cas was backstage with him, helping ease the last-minute nerves. “You’ve got this,” Cas reassured as he smoothed the collar of Dean’s shirt. “You can perform your part backwards and forwards, you’re going to go out there and absolutely kill it.”
“Promise,” Cas chuckled as he started to unpack his travel bag. He did look around at all the posters and knick-knacks around the room while Dean was occupied – of course Dean had a vast collection, some featuring characters or images he recognized, but many of them still unfamiliar to him. There was a poster that had the now-familiar Captain America along with a number of other characters; Cas figured he would be introduced to them in subsequent Marvel movies.
Dean pursed his lips. Okay, game plan time. Basically, divide and conquer – get Bobby alone and tell him first, then deal with telling Mom. But before telling Bobby, it was critical to do some groundwork; get the man some material to read and research.
Bobby was right, as much as Dean hated to admit it. Better to talk to Cas now, get it all out and – well, see what Cas thought about it all. Dean just had to force himself to say everything he wanted to say…and maybe ask Cas not to say anything until he had forced out everything he wanted to say. Yeah.
Castiel sighed and smiled weakly. “Truly, Dean, I’m sorry, I – I had no idea you were thinking that, and – you’re right, we should talk about this.”
…That. That actually sounded pretty great, now that Dean was thinking about it. Not that this was a topic he would ever enjoy discussing, but at least…at least he got that much. He could work with that.
Cas looked surprised, but Sammy immediately replied in the affirmative, shooing them both off. Dean made sure to warn him about Bobby’s conversation with their mom before leading Cas to his room.
Cas sat down on the bed as Dean paced nervously. “Okay. Okay. This – I have a lot I want to talk about, but – some of it is…a lot, okay? Just give me a chance to try and get it all out without interrupting?”
And as much as it hurt to separate from her boys, Mary knew she needed to get away from John. So she moved to South Dakota by herself. At least John had agreed to the boys spending their summers with her.
…But as he suspected, his silence was enough of an answer for Cas, as he felt Cas’ hands leave his face. This was it, this was going to be the moment Cas finally –
Dean frowned at him. “Yeah? I know. You made it pretty clear when you came out to me – you think I didn’t do my homework after that? Look into what it’s like for an allosexual person to date an ace one?”
They’d ended up at different colleges, to the surprise of many who knew them. Dean planned to major in either physics or architecture at Cornell (or maybe both, he could if he really put his mind to it) and took art history (again) his first semester to fulfill a requirement (not to mention adding a little bit of familiarity to help ease him into this wild new world of college life). Cas, on the other hand, was planning to major in comp sci at MIT – and continue to work as a theatre tech behind the scenes of school plays (he was considering a minor in theatre or drama). Despite meeting so many new people and juggling such different schedules, Dean and Cas still kept in close contact through texting and video chats – and while Thanksgiving break had been too short and chaotic to properly meet up, they made surefire plans to do so over winter break, when they would have plenty of time.
...Not that Cas’ responses were quite as clear-cut as Dean had hoped, but they were still good to know. Cas did seem to have a few things he was certain about – handholding and cuddling seemed to be at the top of his list, as long as clothing was on; the rest he wasn’t as sure about, but like Dean said: as long as Cas was open and honest about his feelings and desires, they would find out what Cas liked together – and only at the pace Cas set.
Speaking of – Charlie grinned over at him as she started to pack up her materials. “Pretty amazing, isn’t it?”
It did get him kicked out of his own room, but it was so worth it. He could procrastinate on his research by going to check in with Sammy.
Bertie simply laughed. “Actually, the whole Munchkin thing isn’t that far off.” Her parents had told her how Charlie had gone to Oz from the bunker after they had read her
“Hey, there buddy. How’d you get in there?” Sam let the animal sniff his hand, letting the dog know he could trust him. As gently as he could, Sam untangled the branches from the pup’s fur. The corgi was covered in mud and shivering with cold. Sam unzipped his hoodie, wrapping the small animal in it before picking him up. Sam checked but there was no collar. “Easy buddy. I got ya.”
“The lady asked you a question. What do you want with us?” Sam gripped the demon blade tighter. He was more than prepared to use it.
Sam raced into the room in time to watch his brother catch the angel. He rolled his eyes as the pair stared into each other’s eyes, despite being less than an inch away. Moving past them, he lifted the corgi into his arms. “You, bud, are definitely a troublemaker. Think I finally figured out what to call you.”
Continuing to give the dog reassurances, even though Sam knew the animal couldn’t really understand him, he began walking back to the bunker. He knew that his brother was going to put up a fuss about the Sam bringing the corgi into the bunker, but he would just have to deal with it. He smirked and looked down at the animal in his arms. He laughed when he got a lick to the cheek in return. “You know what, buddy? If Dean gets to keep Cas, I get to keep you.”
’.” Gabriel appeared directly in front of the tall hunter. He ran his hand up over the plaid covered chest, before linking it around his neck to pull him closer. “Just kidding. It’s actually
Gabriel landed silently. Using his pagan tricks over his mojo to sneak into heaven was draining as hell, but he was less likely to be discovered. He remained invisible, doubting that even Michael would be able to sense him at this point. It wouldn’t be easily explained away why a presumed dead archangel was sneaking into his former home. The younger tiers of seraphs wouldn’t understand why he had left, and Gabriel wasn’t in the mood to explain it to them.
“Man, I’m exhausted. And starving. And sore as hell,” Dean rubbed at his shoulder. That last ghost had been one mean sonofabitch. It had thrown the brothers into the wall repeatedly while Bertie had been hunting down it’s remains. “Why were we the ones who had to play distraction each time? You could’ve taken a turn. Gender equality and all that.”
"Do I even want to know what you've been up to? Or is that some big secret that you can't tell me?" Dean glared at his daughter. Now that he had some time to come to terms with it, he could see it. She definitely had some of his features. Definitely had his attitude.
Castiel shrugged off the blankets, and stood from the bed. "If Dean is in trouble, perhaps we should go help him."
A large metal door opened on the side of the building. Its hinges creaked and groaned, grating from disuse. Bertie stepped out, smiling when she saw the hunters. They had said they would come, but she knew how they could be when they weren’t sure of something.
"What? No. No, you've completely got the wrong idea." Dean denied out loud. Internally he had to agree. But the hell he would ever admit it to a stranger or his brother or, well... anyone else. "Just like messing with my brother."
“I can’t believe you’re keeping that mutt Sam. What are you going to do with him when we have to go out on a case? You know we can’t take him with us.” Dean shook his head. He slapped the top piece of bread down for the final sandwich. He had been in the middle of preparing lunch for everyone when the argument started. Well, when
As he rounded the path, Sam slowed. This was one of his favorite spots on the trail, heavily wooded but with a great view of the river at the turn. He jogged in place, measuring his pulse and slightly zoning out when he heard it.
Layla briefed, "The missing people all vanish in the months of June and July. Prime vacation months, but its also right before the harvest. You guys thought vampires, but there's nothing that tracks with the usual signs of vampires. I've been talking to folks in town and this place is an agricultural hub. There's an old church on the city limits that no one uses anymore."
"Amelia, she was a fallen angel. Had one of your special knives." She lurched coughing again. "Does that answer your question?"
"Like I said. No one's home." Dean strolled right in, eyes scanning the walls. Layla picked up one of the clay jars on the mantle piece and took a sniff. She smelled char and iron.
It was a nice enough town with a lively night life. The people she had talked to couldn't imagine anyone being able to kill another person. They spoke well of their neighbors, even the police. It bothered Layla.
"I know she's tough as nails. Born in 1914 and been fighting monsters for most of her life. I know she's annoying and bossy, but she could have left me and my brother for God chow last night and didn't. In fact, she did all she could to keep us from getting ourselves killed."
So Dean stretched, making sure Cas got an eyeful as he did so. Cas’ stare was hot and achieved his revenge for making him do research on his break – win-win.
Once they were in the exhibit, Dean and Cas separated – Cas liked to take his time with the all the plaques before looking at the art, while Dean was the opposite. (And if this way, Dean got to make sure he had already picked out pieces he knew Cas would like, and made sure that Cas got to see them first – well, Dean certainly wasn’t going to tell Cas that.)
After Ellen disappeared back into the kitchen, it wasn’t long before the D&D group showed up – they had carpooled from campus together. Cas and Dean were happy to see their friends, but Dean was surprised to see Charlie and Dorothy holding hands. He stared for a minute before shooting Charlie a raised eyebrow.
Dean was so distracted he didn’t hear Sam’s yell up the stairs that Lee had arrived, Lee’s clomping run, or the perfunctory knock that heralded Lee’s entrance – but he sure heard the door open, just in time to whirl around and face Lee head-on. Definitely no time to hide what he was wearing – or, more to the point, what he wasn’t wearing.
Dean shook his head, teeth gritted. “No. Or, well, yes, but – it was more than that. I – Lee was military, Dad was military. I never felt like I was good enough for Dad, and then – then I wasn’t good enough for Lee. They were both homophobic dickwads, in their own ways, and – ”  Dean waved a hand helplessly.
It didn’t take long for him to call Charlie. “Do *you* think I’m in love with Cas?” he blurted when she picked up.
…And even if the boys didn’t notice how quickly they had become so comfortable with each other, their friends certainly did.
While he gave Cas some looks at first, Dean soon adjusted to the new normal and started initiating his own platonic touches, to the point that even in public, the two were almost constantly touching.
“Oh, the Winchester household,” Cas jumped in to explain. “Dean’s mother, Mary, and his younger brother, Sam, both live there – Sam’s around your age – and Bobby Singer is a friend of Mary’s who lives next door; he’s often around as well. They’re…wonderful,” Cas smiled as he remembered the rollercoaster adventure of his last trip. “Very kind and welcoming people.”
“I don’t want to hear it, Lee, that was below the belt and you know it. *You’re* the one who wanted to keep this quiet, not me!”
Cas offered to help, but Ellen shut that down quickly. “No idea what your skill level is, hon, and we’ve got more than enough cooks in here already. Shoo,” was her command, and Cas shooed. He spent some time with Sam, since they hadn’t been texting much with Cas in the middle of midterms right before break.
Cas noticed that Dorothy winked at Charlie behind Dean’s back, and Charlie had to clear her throat before fiddling with something behind the screen she had set up.
He wasn’t sure what was coming out of his mouth as he slid down the wall and curled up, hiding from Cas’ view, but he assumed it was as scrambled to Cas as it was to him. In the darkness of his closed eyes, Dean just took the chance to breathe.
Castiel put his head in his hands. Maybe he was tired, maybe he was just a soft touch, but he found himself deciding to agree to talk to Dean’s little brother about being ace in high school, which – oof. Whether you knew or not, being ace in high school was not easy and Castiel figured that even if he wasn’t certain he would be all that helpful, at least the kid would have someone to talk with who got it.
But as Claire watched, she swallowed and stood up. “I’m Krissy, uh…they/them. I’m, uh…genderfluid.” She was interrupted by one of the other girls (Claire couldn’t remember her name, but she was blonde and sneering, so Claire dubbed her Regina) laughing rudely.
He mulled over what it could possibly be while in the shower – porn magazines, perhaps? That would explain the rustling sound and some of Dean’s reaction, but not all of it, nor the lack of weight. Nothing else really occurred to Cas, though, so he focused on getting out of the shower and getting ready for bed instead.
Dean gave advice mostly on autopilot, vaguely registering Sammy’s happy tone at the conclusion of their conversation and that he must have done a good job; but most of his brain was processing that ace people did date. Maybe…maybe he and Cas weren’t quite as bad of an idea as he had originally thought?
This was something that, even during the heights of his infatuation with Lee, had always felt…a bit burdensome, more like a chore than anything. Dean had a little brother to worry about, and his dates weren’t always the best conversational partners, especially when that topic came up.
Dean frowned and opened his mouth again, but Castiel merely scowled back and made the shooing motion more firmly this time. Whatever Dean wanted to say, it would have to wait.
“My brother’s name is Sam, that’s his phone number. And if there’s anything you want to ask me, or anything you think I should know about Sam, that’s my phone number.” Dean held up a hand before Castiel could say anything. “You don’t have to use it if you really don’t want to, but...just in case. For my peace of mind?”
Then he put his head in his hands. That was dumb, now Sam was going to be all suspicious, but…he just couldn’t handle the tiny hope Sam was starting to give him. He wasn’t going to fall for it again, dammit; dating male friends led to nothing but trouble, and adding Cas’ asexuality into the mix was not going to help.
“Fine,” Rowena huffed, “technically there *is* an understudy but he absolutely refuses to go on stage. He has agreed to help you learn your lines and choreography, however.”
“You’ve got plenty on your plate,” Jody replied gruffly, and Claire thought that was the end of it – but she also saw Jody sneak some of her own sweet potatoes onto Donna’s plate later.
...Her insistence made sense when Dean found himself locked in a room with Castiel, he of the picky tastebuds. At first Dean thought Cas was in on it, but Cas was quick to defend himself and Dean had to admit, it wouldn’t be the first time Charlie had gone rogue and betrayed him. (Probably wouldn’t be the last either, if Dean was being honest with himself. Which he wasn’t, at the moment, so he could shove that thought aside for another day.)
"Nope." Bobby cautiously peeled off the bandage on her stomach. Layla hissed, clenching a fist tight around the corner of the couch cushion. He grimaced.
The rumble of the road masked the sound of the guitar coming in over the radio, the wheels skipping over bumps in the road. A deep bass voice joined in, terribly off tune, but boisterous and unapologetic.
She was looking into a series of missing people; young men in their twenties that came through every summer with their girlfriends and never make it out of town. No one ever found bodies.
thank you for waiting. Took me awhile to get back to this and polish out the ending. I am currently finishing up the next section which takes place right after this.
Bobby pointed at Sam with his beer. "You guys came across a chick named Layla a couple years back. The one with the monster friends."
Sam gave Dean a look. His eyebrows climbed and his chin came down. Dean scrunched up half his face and threw his hands up. Sam motioned to the door and jerked his nose in that direction. Dean rolled his eyes.
She settled on the bed with her notes and news clippings spread out around her later, with the pizza on the pillow.
The door opened, issuing in the three men. Dean and Sam still looked like they'd been in a scrap and Castiel wrinkled his nose at the sight of Layla.
She shook her head and sat back. "Not yet. I was going to go take a look at the church tomorrow morning."
"You're the one that's always rushing in despite being the exact type this god goes for." She reached up and adjusted the mirror so she could look into it. "Just because it looks empty, doesn't mean it is."
Layla found the pack of cigarettes in her jacket pocket and groaned; The pack was soaked with her blood. "Seriously, I need a light."
The god clicked his tongue and picked up the dropped knife. "Now, now. This'll be easier if you stop fighting."
"I always knew you lacked brains, but I guess, Sam really did get the whole bucket," Layla quipped, following him into the greasy atmosphere.
"Hell yeah," Dean exclaimed. "No epic battle. No being angel vessels. No apocalypse. What's not worth it about that?"
Dean was in Castiel's face now. Inches between them. "I watched her kill other Gods a couple months back. The whole room was in flames in an instant."
Root tendrils pierced her like spears from the back, holding her in place. Layla choked, feeling the blood filling her lungs. The god grinned and stabbed her in the stomach with the stake. Pain flooded her mind unlike anything else.
"Dude, stop. You sound horrible." A lighter voice said. There was a ring of familiarity to the tone.
The radio buzzed for a moment as they slowed down for the turn. Then the sound of Brittany Spears came through clear as ever. Layla glared at the radio for a second and it shut off. Dean looked at the console and then at Layla.
The inside smelled like the cooking stew. The orange glow threw shadows over the walls and the empty dinner table.
Layla slowly came to, wrenching herself miserably out of her sweeter memories. Sam helped her to sit up.
When Castiel touched Layla, she blacked out for a moment. Light rippled through her body, searing the toxins from her bloodstream.
Dean hung from the ceiling, tied up in roots, his shirt torn open and a deep scratch down his chest. He was yelling still at the god with long yellow hair. Sam hung next to him in the same manner, only with five extra gouges in his skin.
Layla kept watching the football game. She didn't really care for the sport, but it was on and Jack liked pretending they were normal. Didn't change that the owners of the house were tied up in the basement, or that they had warded the house against unwanted surprises. But they could pretend for a night.
She peered through the peephole. Brown hair and a clean shave wearing a brown jacket over plaid stood in front of her door. She could see the shadow of someone just out of sight. She put a hand on the door and rested her head.
"Shit," Layla groaned and made her way up to the door. On the other side, the neat interior had been ravaged by vines and tree roots. Jars were overturned and broken on the dirt floor. She put her hand to her hair again, dragging her fingers through the wet strands.
It was a one story building made of planks and reeds. The only sign of the modern world was the electric lamp post that illuminated a rough beaten path up to the front door. Though the grass grew tall, it was neat and orderly as if someone regularly maintained the land and home. A farmland spread out on the other side of the house.
He helped her up, but her legs barely held her weight. Dean put his arm around her back and scooped her up by the knees.
"Not that I can remember what the hell happened." Bobby squinted at Layla. "You wouldn't have happened to be in Arravelle, Wyoming twenty years ago?"
"Oh, right." She got out of the car and started walking up to the house. Dean swore and rushed to open his door.
"What!" Layla shoved off him, stumbling to find her balance. "You let that feathery bastard touch me?"
The screen door clanged shut and boots stomped down the steps. Castiel leaned on an '89 truck missing it's wheels by the side of the driveway. He had his hands in his pockets and the grumpy look on his face might as well have been carved out of stone.
Dean scrambled to his feet, only to be pulled off them by a tendril around his ankle. His head banged  off the ground as he was yanked up. His knife bounced across the dirt.
"No." Layla cut him short with a glare. "He'd have killed you on principal. I wouldn't have argued too much in the end. Anyway, turned out to be vampires. Pretty standard raid. Problem was, some of the nest were out hunting. They got back and saw you first."
"Well, we're not your average hunters," Dean said. "We've killed dozens of demons like Lilith and Azaezal. I've been to Hell and back. We don't die easy."
Castiel moved back, stoic. He frowned down on Layla as her eyelids fluttered. He then turned his frown on Dean. "Happy?" he asked. "She'll live."
Light flashed over the grass. Layla tried to get up and felt her arm fix itself. She choked on the pain.
Layla shook her head. "First place, I'm not a girl. I'm ninety years old. Second, they're the ones that wanted to walk into this death trap in the first place. Third, I hate old farts like you that are addicted to human meat."
"You could say that." Layla didn't look back. She pulled out her knife and stalked up to the door. There was no noise inside. A wreath hung on the door that smelled faintly like wheat and poppy. Layla pinched her nose and pushed the door open.
"There it is." Layla pointed to the house along side the road and Dean hit the brakes. "Looks cozy."
The man pulled a sheet of paper from his desk and handed it over. Layla took it and went to her room.
Dark and moody looking, Jack leaned into vision of the couch where Layla lounged on the couch in front of the television.
Sam opened the door for Dean and frowned at Castiel. "Cass, drop it. She's our friend and nearly died helping us."
Bobby tossed back the rest of his glass. "I remember waking up and thinking I'd gone on another bender."
A wooden crack interrupted them. About to break free, Dean found himself bound once more, but more tightly.
"Half God half demon remember? I don't age like the rest of you. I'll be looking young and spry for another three hundred years most likely, if not longer. Hey, what does this look like to you?" She turned the camera around.
"Agreed." Layla cleaned her plate. "Can you boys find out how to kill this God? I'm going to go scope the place out."
Layla braced herself on the bookshelf. "Whatever. It explains why I feel hungover. Haven't felt like this in decades."
"Besides the church? There's a farm house out in the middle of nowhere. A museum in town. Used to be a blacksmith's up until fifty years ago. That's it."
"You should not be helping this woman," Castiel advised. "She is a plague on the world and a danger to us all."
Sam caught himself on the arm of the couch. Bobby steadied him and argued, "You were dying and there was nothing any of us could do. You should be saying thank you, not yelling at us for it."
Sam somehow got loose, dropping weakly to his knees. Layla risked a glance his way and got wacked in the arm for it. She yelled, jolting back into the cabinet. Sam crawled forward, his fingers wrapping around a wooden stake.
Outside, she lit up a cigarette and took a drag. The sky cracked and opened up. Raindrops hit her shoulders. Layla stood there a moment longer and then ground out the cigarette in the nearby trash can.
Jack came back with two open bottles of beer and sat down on the couch next to her. She took a bottle and scooted closer. He put an arm around her shoulders.
Her eyes turned black and the mirror fogged over. An image of a fire pit with a cauldron hanging over it filled her mind. The image rotated, showing the rest of the inside like a slow moving camera.
"So, you're thinking this is a pagan god? Like the ones you torched?" Dean took a closer look at the map. "Do you know which one?"
"Thank you," Layla said to the tall and skinny bartender as she shut her notebook. "If you hear anything, let me know?" She dug out a business card and slid it across the counter.
"Well that was a waste of time," Dean complained as he parked outside the burger joint. The car door creaked and slammed behind him. "All we know is it was the first church built in this town and it used to be a farming town."
"So long as you harbor this creature, I will not 'lighten up' as you say. We should finish killing it and go."
"If you get free," The god corrected. "And even then, I'll just restrain you again. Poor hunters. Thinking you could kill me. So many have tried over the centuries."
"Any of them still standing?" Layla asked between bites. Dean gave her a funny look as she scarfed up fries.
Castiel stood like a statue in the corner, furious eyes fixed on Layla as if it were his duty to keep an eye on her. She looked at him a couple times and then laid her head back and stared at the ceiling.
"I'm being serious here," he burst, turning half way. Before he could say or do anything else, a thick root thrust up out of the dirt and slammed him into the table. Layla whirled, knife flying into her hand. The root hit fast as lightning, throwing her into the side of the cauldron. The heat burned through her shirt and scalded her skin.
Dean tried to laugh. "Sorry about that. We got turned around on the road and were looking for directions."
More tendrils sprouted, growing in the blink of an eye. Layla pushed a few of them away, but more grew in their place, wrapping up her legs and then her arms. The roots pulled her into a kneeling position with her hands pulled back.
"Are you a fucking idiot?" Layla swore at Dean. "This thing goes after young men in their twenties. Exactly what you are. No one is going there at night, much less the dinner plate."
"The fact that black flames are the kind of thing that could tear creation apart. They're not a gift from God or Hell, Dean. It's a mistake."
Layla could hear Bobby berating the boys in the other room through her sedated haze. Bobby had done what he could and cleaned up the wound, stitched it up and re bandaged it, but none of that had taken away the pain or the migraine.
Layla nodded. "Of course you turned on me. I don't blame you for that. Anyway, I knocked you out and carried you back to the hotel room."
Layla glanced at Dean to confirm he was working his way through his bindings. "My father was a demon. I inherited his power. Makes hunting creeps like you easy, though. How many have you killed?"
"Where are we?" Castiel asked as Dean came to a stop in a dusty lot packed with broken down cars and trucks.
Layla sat in the chair, waiting for her head to clear up. Sam made his way outside after a couple of quiet exchanges with Bobby. Then the grumpy old man grabbed a bottle of whiskey and poured himself a drink.
"It tastes like crap, but it'll help with the pain," Dean said, pouring out a shot's worth. He gave her the glass.
"Wyoming," She muttered. "Wyoming. Oh, right. You were that fake US Marshall that insisted on working a hunt with me."
She slowly found her feet in the field of prairie grass. A pattern had been pressed down, showing how she had been thrown from the innocent looking house meters away. The light from the street lamp shone over wet dark patches on the ground.
A thick branch broke through the wall of the house and skewered Layla like a kabob. The flames vanished as she choked. The branch flexed, dragging her outside and flinging her into the air. She landed with a soggy crunch in the field of corner a hundred meters out.
Behind his back, Dean's knife floated into his palm. Dean started to feel the smooth wood in his fingers. He glanced up, but the god didn't look down at him. He turned the knife in his grip and began sawing at the plants holding him.
She looked out the window and saw trees going by as they drove on an old asphalt road. They were passing pine tress and blackberry bushes, pushing through a light fog.
There was a smell, light and fluffy, and then suddenly a man wearing a tan trenchcoat appeared in the back seat next to Layla. She flinched back and immediately felt her insides start burning. She melted into the corner with a whimper.
She shrugged. "They were going to kill you. I killed them first. Then," she made a face, "you freaked on me. So I erased your memory."
"Willow dipped in rabbit's blood. Thought it doesn't look like it was enough to kill you." Sam glanced back at the road for a moment.
Sam had been hesitant about having Bertie drive Baby. Dean didn’t even like having people touch the impala, let alone drive it. Then he realized that she had probably been driving it for more years than Dean even had. Sam still got to ride shotgun at least. The only downside of the trip being Gabriel randomly kicking the back of his seat. Compared though to the cold, stoic archangel that had returned from Heaven, Sam would take the petulant child-like Trickster instead.
Bertie took a deep breath. She hoped this would work. Having them both on Team Free Will would be a great benefit. She gestured for them to sit, this would take a while getting it all out. “I got some things to tell you.”
Bertie shot a determined look at Gabriel. “You can stay here like a coward if you want. Right now I’m going to go help my family. Help Sam.”
“Shit. Please tell me that all that blood soaking you is from the demons? Please tell me that, Sammy.” When Sam avoided his gaze, Dean turned to confront his daughter about it. She ignored his gaze as well, picking leftover demon bits out of her nailbed.
Bobby just grunted, hitting his hat against his thigh. "Family reunion apparently. Meet Bertie. Time traveler. Here to save the universe."
Dean blinked. Sarcasm oozed out of his pours. "Of course. Just save the universe. That seems simple enough. It's not like we don't already have enough to deal with trying to stop the apocalypse or anything."
"No. No you cannot show me that!" Castiel clasped his head, trying to block out the scene, the overwhelming pain it caused.
She fell forward, knees smacking against Gabriel’s coffee table. She grasped her head from the pain the prayer was causing. No. Not the prayer. She was feeling what he was feeling. What Sam was feeling.
They appeared back in the Impala as soon as Chuck had snapped his fingers. Not only that, but he had sent them all the way back to Lebanon. The car shook, rocking the suspension as it settled in front of the bunker.
Naomi choked back a sob. Gabriel was alive! She barely knew what to think. She had been in this position for over a millennia. Ordered by Michael himself as to her directive, and she always followed his orders. But Gabriel, the once playful and kind angel she once admired from afar was alive before her, demanding answers to questions she dare not ask herself. She nodded tearfully and began.
But first she needed to find out was when she was before she started to change anything, and damn the consequences.
Zachariah yanked at the back of the young Seraph’s head. He put his face within a breath’s space of Castiel’s, tongue licking the scruff of his cheek. Castiel grimaced. Dean was right, angels really were douche-bags.
After locking the door, Layla emptied her pockets. She was tired and needed a break after searching the town for information. She called out for a pizza and pasta off the menu and stepped in the shower.
"Human flesh," Layla murmured, bending down to inspect the floor. It was flat dirt, woven with old plant matter.
"Aravelle, Wyoming, 1986," Layla began. "People were going missing. You showed up after me and you took me for a hunter like yourself. Lucky you my boyfriend was out of town."
"Do you know what they hit me with?" Layla looked down and felt the bandage taped to her abdomen. "Doesn't even hurt." She started to peel off the tape and choked on a spike of pain. She cringed, "Nevermind."
"Keep it down, ya Idjit." A grumpy older man stomped down the stairs, wiping his hands on a towel. "What's with all the hollering?"
Castiel glared at her. "If it were not the boys' wishes, I would end your existence for the good of the cosmos."
A knock at the door interrupted her musings. She licked the grease from her fingers and got up from the bed.
Dean slowed down to take a turn. The wheels rumbled onto packed dirt. Layla squeezed her eyes shut with a moan, curling in on herself.
Layla gasped as her bones cracked and grated, fusing themselves back together. She could taste metal in her mouth.
"Don't you touch him," she heard him yell in a fit of rage. She wondered if it was Dean and then saw the car parked behind hers.
A yell rang out. Layla squinted, trying to see in the dark. The lights blurred, gaining halos for a moment. She eased her eyes closed and touched the side of her head. She could feel the stickiness in her hair.
"Killed? No, they were sacrifices." He knelt to look right in her eyes. "Used to be, the locals would offer something up: the outcasts, the weak, the deformed. I even accepted the odd goat in old times. Now, I have to find my own. A few people die and the town thrives. Is that so bad?"
Layla pulled out the city map she'd bought earlier and laid it out. She tapped the spot on the map. "Locals don't go there. Rumors are that it was used as a temple back in the 1700's, before the town turned Christian. Now it's a bit of a scenic tourist location. Bit of history for travelers to go look at. I'm betting that's how they go missing."
Flames rushed up from her fist, turning the god into ash the same as the roots and the stake, but the holes stayed. Layla stood there a moment, feeling split between walking out the door and falling down on her face.
