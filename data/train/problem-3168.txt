Sam was blushing like a twelve year old, also something that Gabe always seemed to make him do. “Yes, Gabe, I’m inviting you back to where I’m staying. It’s actually Dean’s place, but since he seems rather occupied at the moment, I’m pretty sure that he won’t mind.”
“I actually thought that it would be as well, but when I checked, would you believe it, there was nothing in the rules about it. So, the officials had a meeting and decided that since there is no precedent for it, that it would be allowed. They both made it to the finals on their own volition, so they are both eligible to be in the round. Electing to join as a team doesn’t negate that.” He wasn’t being rude, but he was a little confused himself at why they would do such a thing. It was unheard of.
“Please tell me that you are pretending to be this dense.” After a moment of Sam just looking back at him in response Gabe huffed out a chuckle. “Well, maybe not. I thought that there was no way that you hadn’t picked up on it considering the side eye that your brother has been giving me all afternoon. I thought you were the smart one, maybe it’s just because he’s got those rose colored glasses going for him right now.”
“You are probably right. So why don’t you distract me, moose man?” Gabe’s grin was almost leering, and Sam was pretty sure he wasn’t mistaking the signals he was getting, but he was the kind who liked to double check everything.
After several hours, Dean decided that Cas had received enough training for one night. It wasn’t the best bread Dean had ever tasted, but he couldn’t handle being this close to Cas. There were too many things Dean had noticed, not only about Cas, but about himself, as well. It wouldn’t do his prospects of expanding the business any good if he started letting himself slip. He had managed to keep his desires for the same sex under wrap for most of his life. Letting them  show only once, and his mom berating him about it, was enough for Dean. Funnily enough, it was over Cas then, as well.
“Uh Dean, I don’t dance.” Cas wasn’t a very good dancer, but he was having fun with Dean and decided that he would at least try. Dean wasn’t really trying to do anything fancy, so he thought that he might not cause any harm.
We all get up and head down to the town center for the choosing ceremony. Sam has been really quiet today. I can’t tell if he’s nervous or worried. That in itself worries me, because I have always been able to read Sam like a book. He is closed off today. I’m worried that he thinks I will disagree with his choice, and that to me says he is going to choose Erudite. I can’t judge him though. Even if him choosing Erudite would mean that he will be closer to Lucifer, it would be a good fit for him. He’s so smart. I really don’t see him going somewhere else.  Nothing came to me during the night, so I guess when I get up there and have to choose, I will wing it. That is kind of the way I see my life, just winging it and seeing what happens. I mean if I end up factionless, maybe I can find my parents. What if they are why I am divergent? If they were divergent and didn’t make it in their chosen factions that would explain why they were factionless. Not knowing who they are makes that seem like a pipe dream though, who knows?
Dean had known the bakery was a little run down, but he didn’t realize it was doing that badly. Now he felt bad because there was no way Castiel even had a chance at winning the bake off with the abilities he possessed. He had an idea, though. Castiel had mentioned the books. He had a degree in business, so maybe they could help each other out. No one would have to know, they could still keep up the feud for all intents and purposes, but that didn’t mean that they had to actually be feuding when they weren’t in public.
Sam scoffs. "Don't be such a jerk about it, I'm just tryna help."
Dean relaxes into the hug, content to just stand there with Cas' arms around him for a minute, "Well I'd rather have you, cursed or not," he says with a laugh, "so I guess you're not getting rid of me any time soon."
Dean frowns again, before slowly saying, "Have you two? Is that why Cas is saying you're an untrustworthy asshole?" He can feel anger dancing inside him, but he pushes it down, he doesn't know that it's true.
"Yeah, come on then, we'll choose something off Netflix when we get there."
"Hey!" Dean calls in fake annoyance, "I'll have you know I'm a pleasure to be stuck in a dorm with. I’m a flat-out joy to be around."
Sam stared at him. "Your brother? Uh- okay, sure. Why not."
Cas finishes his phone call, rubbing his eyes, and tosses Dean's phone back on his bed. "You're fine, now. The money's coming straight out of my account, your car won't be affected at all."
"That's true," Dean laughs, "should we head back to our room and we can figure stuff out from there?"
Cas smiles. He thinks he'd like to hear that laugh forever. "That sounds great."
#~+~#
"Shit," Dean repeats, "fuck, damn, shit."
Cas smiles tightly. "It's alright. Not big on high school texts, then?"
Sam sighs. "I'm not as pushy as you make me out to be."
"I'd recommend not," Dean says quickly - possibly too quickly - but that doesn't matter. Cas can't ask Sam, because if he does then Cas will learn the truth about Dean, and even if the earlier fuck up hadn't been enough to scare him off, after a minute of talking with Sam, Cas would be long gone, never to speak to Dean again. Dean can't let that happen.
"As I'm sure I've said before, I hate your family. But don't worry, my dad's are helping pay for my tuition, I'm sure they won't mind me helping out a friend."
"I hope for their sakes that I never do meet them," Dean says, his voice dripping with hate, "because I can promise you, that wouldn't get out of that alive."
"You ok?" Dean asks after the sixth failed conversation starter. He understands that not everyone is particularly chatty, but Cas seems quieter, more reserved, than he did earlier.
“That doesn’t exist.”
"Morning bro," Gabe replies, raising an eyebrow at the apparent shoving match, but not saying anything.
Cas nods and kisses him hard, hands moving down Dean's body to his waist. "Just a warning, never done this before," he breathes. "So be prepared for inexperience."
"Yeah I'm fine," Dean assures, "You just seemed quiet, I was making sure you were ok." He walks into the bathroom and locks the door behind him, trying to shake the concern which still pestered him.
"Hi, I'm Joan," says a dark-haired girl. "And this is Noah and Raife." She extends the hand that isn't holding booze.
Dean bristles, but doesn't argue, instead just opening his own menu and tensely reading it.
approached
Cas knocks gently on the window and recoils slightly when Dean's head whips up. "Can you unlock it?" he asks timidly through the door.
His voice is somehow seriously gorgeous. He is looking directly at Dean. Dean’s going to explode.
"Ok, breakfast time," Dean announces, his stomach rumbling.
"You have a brother called Lucifer?" Dean asks, a strange mix of awe and shock in his voice, "That's so cool! I mean - it's sad that he doesn't speak to you anymore - but you and your siblings are named after angels. I've only got one brother, and he has a normal, boring, non-biblical, non-satanic name of Sam."
Sam fights down his smile and squeezes back. "Eggs, over hard, and hash browns, please."
happened."
Cas reaches out to grab Dean's arm so he doesn't lose him and he sees the letters
"We slept," Dean replies shortly.
He trails off, trying to figure out how to say what he wants to say. "You're his older brother," he finally says. "You're his
"Mechanical engineering," Dean says, pushing the box into the corner as he claps his hands together and spinning around to face Cas, "do you have any plans for tonight?" he asks because he's planning to go out and meet some new people. He wonders whether he and Cas will become good friends, he hopes so. He can already tell that Cas is the kind of person he could spend hours with, without getting tired.
Dean picks his burger back up, staring at it for a moment before dutifully starting to nibble on it. He's hungry, he knows that, yet somehow even just the small nibble he's taken feels like it's sitting heavy in his stomach and weighing him down.
That’s what his identity has always been associated with – pain.
All too soon, Dean pulls into the college parking lot and they have to get out. Dean doesn't have any lectures with Cas, so he won't see him until the end of the day. It should not hurt as much as it does. "I'll see you later," he says, climbing out slowly.
"I'm not offended," Cas replies. "It's just- my father died, last week."
"You- what?"
Dean almost falls backwards when Cas kisses him, but he just about manages to catch himself before he ends up with his head well acquainted with the floor. He leans into the kiss, sighing happily and not even bothering to think about how sudden that topic change had been.
"No," Cas says instantly. "I want to hear about 'wild things you've done that rank above not dying from appendicitis'."
Cas is punching something into the karaoke machine and he’s gonna sing.
"I'm saying I don't qualify as a good enough friend for you to buy me clothes."
Cas grins and follows Dean. This is easy and uncomplicated, this rhythm he's fallen into with Dean. He can learn to settle for this because this is all it will ever be.
"Oh yeah, don't worry. I was definitely talking about Gabriel. Michael didn't even mean to give that money to you. I was planning to murder him slowly and painfully and that has not changed."
Cas nods as Dean pulls into a parking spot. "Yeah. Exactly."
"Both?"
Cas nods, shoving Dean down underneath himself. He doesn't know what they're doing but he loves Dean and he loves this and he wants to keep going until Dean inevitably pulls away from him and tells him he was wrong.
"Well yeah," Dean replies, "why do you sound so surprised? I've already said I would murder for you, dying is pretty much the next step up."
"Hey," Dean says, not looking up from his phone. He knows that his eyes are probably still a little bit raw, and there is no point letting Cas know about that.
"Don't go," Dean says before he can think his actions through, reaching out to grab Cas' arm.
"Hmmmm," Dean starts, thinking through what he wants today, "I think I'll get Pepperoni, ham, sausage and extra cheese," he decides. Today is a meaty kind of day.
Cas glances at those lips and he can't tear his eyes away. "What?" he whispers shakily.
Cas inhaled shakily. "What did he do to you?"
"You're free to go," says a nurse from the doorway.
Dean sighs happily into the kiss, everything feeling like it's slipping back into place now that he has his soulmate back.
Cas laughs out loud. "Then I guess I'll have to carry you again."
Sam purses his lips. "We made you extra. Go."
"I don't believe that you won't hurt him again," Gabriel tells him.
Finally, Cas pulls away, carefully not touching or looking at Dean.
Cleaning can wait.
"Well at least I have a safety net," Gabe says, "then again, I'm fairly sure that as a witness or whatever, you wouldn't be able to be my lawyer."
"Great," Dean smiles, leading the way out the door and locking the door behind them. He is unable to stop himself from giving Cas a quick look over, but the guy looks good. The jeans show off his legs, and the blue top makes his eyes look even bluer than Dean ever thought possible. It's a good look, made even nice by the fact it's Cas wearing it. He wants to make a joke about how the girls - or boys in this case - will be swooning over Cas, but he can't bring himself to. Not when it's a little too close t Dean's truth, or when the very though of any boy getting any where near Cas makes Dean bristle in what might just be jealousy.
"You do that," Dean laughs, "but please keep it PG, I have nowhere to escape to."
"He called you Castiel. He called your brother Gabriel. I don't need to know him."
"What?" Dean asks, "no, I- I need to sort this out."
"Seems like your brother understands you pretty well," Cas replies.
"Liar," Sam mutters. "But whatever. That's not why we're here."
He sighs, rolls his suitcase into the room, and starts to unpack on his side. He has yet to see or hear of his roommate.
"He's in the music department. You'd never know it from looking at him but he's a music nerd."
Joan looked Cas up and down appreciatively. "Now you are one sexy thing," she said, grinning.
Cas glanced at him. "I hope so."
"Then we're going home and you're gonna talk and we're gonna... probably bone," Sam decides.
Cas pulls him over to sit down on the bed. His eyes are brimming over. "I'm so sorry."
"Ok yeah, that happened," Dean agrees, "but that wasn't a bonding moment or anything, that was just me realizing you really are as boring as you seem to think you are, at certain times and your knowledge of herbs is one of those times."
"Okay," Dean says hesitantly. He has no idea where this is going, and he's ever so slightly worried. He knows it can't be anything bad, Cas said it was 'awesome' and he doubts Sam would call Cas over something super personal.
“Get to the part that you want me to do,” Dean grumbles.
"Sure, do you want to look at jeans, tops or sweaters first?"
"Because I'm the one who did all this. I'm the one who started this whole mess and I'm the one who didn't look after myself."
“Cas,” Dean whispers. “Do you love me?”
"If you want."
Cas rolls his eyes and shoves him gently as he sticks the toothbrush in his mouth. "You're a jerk."
"I- I need to call my dads," Dean says, in lieu of an answer. He fumbles with his phone, picking it up on his second attempt and quickly dials Bobby's number.
"Think they're soulmates?" Sam asks, grinning.
Dean wanted to tell Cas that it wasn’t any problem. Of course they were coming. His throat closed and opened. Cas didn’t care about that shit. “Anytime,” he told Cas dismissively, only it was true. “Sam taking good care of you?”
It made Dean need to quash his impulse to shove the coffee table over on its side. Dean didn’t want that kind of movie.
So Dean had the mag in one hand ‘cause Dean was feeling sentimental or what the fuck ever and his dick in the other
“The look out?” Sam asked. “Dean, you’re one good surveillance kit away from full blown big brother on a good day --”
In the end, the audit revealed that the patient but sexy nurse had been poisoning Doctor Sexy as revenge for when she thought Doctor Sexy was cheating on the sexy-but-naïve new Doctor from season two. It had, of course, been Doctor Sexy’s identical twin. It was, the director of the episode said in the DVD commentary, a fun callback.
“I trusted him with yours, though.” Cas has been so honest. Dean owes him something. Maybe he had bared his neck a bit for Benny, letting him protect Cas like he did. “That mattered. So, I guess I get it. But it wasn’t like we were in love or anything.”
Dean sometimes thought he felt something. Some sort of -- and it wasn’t that Dean didn’t fuck men. He wasn’t -- he didn’t talk about it or think about it, but. Only so many times you could pop a stiffy down on your knees, sucking another man’s cock before you had to admit a few harsh truths to yourself.
Dean was moved. Dean’s penis, on the other hand, was not.
Fuck. Dean curled his hand into a fist. “Nice going asshole,” he told Sam.
He’d started building up a community of hunters. He loved Eileen and Eileen loved hunting and him and Sam went on walks with other hunters. Shot the shit. Sam then superimposed on Sam now flickered briefly in Dean’s mind but it was like the two images couldn’t reconcile and instead they both vanished.
“So, Dean,” Sam said in his gratingly smug Stanford Educated voice, “you know what I thought when I first met Cas?”
Cas’ forehead wrinkled under Dean’s. “Is that helping?”
He doesn't want to sleep yet. It’s better to be awake when Cas calls, not waking up. His stomach is still sloshing around from earlier, so Dean sits on the kitchen floor, against the fridge, instead of at the table. The fridge is stiff and blocky against his back. Dean waits, and lets himself drift.
“Right,” Dean said, and swallowed. “So, genius, how do people frigging see me?”
Dean was sleeping when Rowena finally found a spell in the translated page of some codex Sam apparently thought was safe for the Queen of Hell to keep that was supposedly going to get Cas back.
The nurse he was in bed with was encouraging, and said all the right things. It didn’t help. Doctor Sexy left her place and headed into work, but he couldn’t focus on the job. He kept finding other couples making out in the supply closet, or taking pregnancy tests in the bathroom, or breaking up in the OR, hands tangled up in someone’s guts sewing the life back into some poor schmuck while pulling it right out of their relationships.
“Good fucking job there, buddy.” Dean snorted and stood up. Cas stood up with him, face going stony and flat. Dean bit in the inside of his lip. Fuck. Dude went and died for him and Dean was just sitting here spewing his usual bullshit.
Oddly, it made his bones feel hollow, while his stomach tossed and turned. Dean should visit him. He knew that. Sam didn’t know near enough about caring for the nearly dead or dying and Dean wanted to. He did. But Dean was tired and Cas probably was too and he didn’t want to risk the upchuck.
Cas sounds frustrated. “I believe I am familiar with … following someone else’s pace,” he tells Dean through his shitty four years out of date phone speakers. Yeah, Dean thinks. He supposes Cas is. Meg -- and April -- didn’t really seem like the slow down and talk it out types.
Cas smiled slightly down into his coffee mug. “I am looking forward to it.” Well, that made one of them. It was hard enough navigating his way around Cas with only Sam to watch him fumble through it.
“Hi boys,” Eileen said, causing Sam to spin around. The tension in his shoulders -- the tension Dean put in his shoulders -- seemed to drain away.
Dean nodded dumbly. Jack looked around the cemetery before settling back on Dean. Dean resisted the urge to duck his head, forcing himself to make eye contact with Jack.
Dean thinks he might throw up again. He leans his head back against the wall behind him. The ceiling of the bunker is endless. He moves the phone down from his ear and puts it on the ground.
Cas tried to summon up a smile. “Don’t worry,” he said. “I am very grateful to you and your brother.”
Cas looked Dean in the eye. “He’s very attractive,” Cas said, then turned back to the screen. Dean’s mouth went dry. His eyes flickered over to Cas, but Cas wasn’t paying attention to him anymore. Cas was paying attention to the man on the screen. The shirtless man on the screen.
“Can I come in?” Dean asked, glancing around. “Don’t wanna have this discussion out here. But I will,” he added, grin fading as Cas continued not speaking. “I get it if you don’t want to let me in right now. I was -- am -- pretty terrible. But, uh, I’ve been talking to a few people, you know, online. About my dick problems. And then Sam kinda talked to me and then I kinda talked to Jack and --”
Dean went on a date earlier but had to leave halfway through. He’d had to pull the impala over just before the Bunker and empty his stomach on the ground. He'd wiped his chin with the back of his hand, gotten back in the impala, and tried to ignore the queasiness. So what. He wasn’t feeling well.
, “and I want you to understand you’re the only one who sees yourself the way you do.”
“Yeah,” Dean told Sam quietly, because Sam was right. Dean didn’t have anything to offer. He didn’t think he’d ever really had much, but now he couldn’t even summon up the pretense. Bad knees, a bad back, and a man who couldn’t sustain a conversation much less an erection. Hands that had done things that weren’t forgivable. He knew that. Sam forgave him anyway, but that was just because Sammy was too big hearted to know better and Dean too piss poor terrified to make him learn. Cas -- cared. Dean knew Cas cared. But this. It was too big. No one cared about Dean that much. No one could. Dean didn’t make it possible.
Absentmindedly, Dean rubbed at his pinky finger. It was going a little numb, which was worrying but more pleasant. “So?” he asked roughly.
“Oh.”
He was in the kitchen by six -- before the sun -- drinking coffee when Sam dragged himself in, fully decked head to toe in his girlish neon running gear.
“He’s an angel,” Dean snapped. “He doesn’t -- feel like us.”
Okay. That was fine. Dean wasn’t panicking. Dean wouldn’t panic about something like this because things like this didn’t happen. Dean’d never had whiskey dick in this life. Dean’s body ran cold. Was that fucking Chuck? The entire time? Keeping him fucking -- virile? His stupid little action hero killer -- fuck. Fuck! He pulled the air in through his teeth, and dropped his hands, all thoughts of getting off gone.
“The kind,” Cas replied, starting to sound actually mad at Dean, “that loves you. Maybe you enjoy hurting the people you love. I don’t.”
“Gee, you think?” Dean said harshly, and then immediately regretted it.
It took Sam and Dean three months to get Cas back. It took Dean nearly the same amount of time to realize his dick wasn’t working.
“And your prostate massager.”
“What the fuck are you trying to say?”
But Cas did what he always did and put the ball down and quit the game. “I wish you would let me understand.”
Dean closed it and gave the magazine back to Miss Marbel. “Okay,” he said. “I took a look. What now?”
Cas loved him but Cas was just picking up some bad habits from Dean. Dean was nothing but a collection of bad habits, when it came down to it, and Cas would be better off losing all of them.
“Dean?”
When people didn’t say what they meant, you learned to read the spaces.
“No!” Dean said, then took a calming breath. It didn’t fucking work, which is another reason doctors (fine, WebMD, whatever) were bullshit. “That’s why we can’t --” he gestured rudely in the air. “It’s not ‘cause I don’t -- it’s cause, you know.” He glanced meaningfully down at his dick.
Nothing happened. Dean logged on to his computer and watched seven videos all the way through without a twitch from his noblest soldier. Guy on girl. Blowjobs. Girl on girl. Even guy on guy at the end. Not a single stirring.
Cas looked out the couch for a second and it was as if the air in the room got heavier. Oh. This might be a mistake. Dean barely had time to think about scrambling up to a corner of the couch but not wanting Cas to feel -- unwelcome -- before Cas was sitting down next to him.
Sam looked tired. Sam should rest, but Dean wasn’t feeling very generous. “I don’t -- sometimes I don’t know you at all, Dean. Because you don’t let anyone know you. You don’t even let you know you.”
“When’s the last time you slept in your bed?” Cas asked. He’s smiling, though, like he’s teasing Dean, and it’s all wrong because Dean is breaking his heart. Cas shouldn’t be smiling while Dean sets up the trip wire.
Cas smiled. “Thank you,” he told Dean. “But even if it wasn’t, I would still want to stay. Even back at the Bunker I was -- I didn’t want -- you are particular about your space. And I didn’t understand, really, until I was human, what that meant. But filling a space, it’s more than that. It’s very human. It’s building up a life. You were trying to create a future. I understand now. And this is just pieces now, but it’s … something I’m building.”
Dean was already shaking his head. “Buddy,” Dean said, “these kinds of shows? They always have feelings for the vampires. Or monsters.” Then, because it looks like Cas still didn’t understand, Dean added, “besides, you don’t fight like that when you want to kill someone.”
“No. Well, yeah.” Dean held up his laptop. He took a fortifying mental breath. He was here. He was starting this. No backing down. “Thought maybe we could watch on my laptop.”
“Say something!” Dean exploded.
Heat flared behind Dean’s eyes. “Exactly.”
“What?” Claire crossed her arms. “Alex talked about it all the time. For, like, months.”
It’d gotten soaked through with blood a few years back and Dean’d had to throw it away; he should’ve known better. Had to stop letting whatever was there under his nails and stretched skin pump ideas out instead of his brain. Crying over spilt milk instead of scrubbing it, dad used to tell him. Sam was better at the scrubbing, but it seemed like Dean did all the cleaning anyway.
Cas pursed his lips. “I wasn’t sure what I was allowed to put up.”
"I don't know," Dean mutters, "Probably with food if I'm being honest."
"Good, anyone who isn't attached to her after a drive in her, is not to be trusted."
Sam pulls his bitchface. "No, you're not a real baby, but you act like one. And you have the emotional health of one. Now chill."
Dean allows himself to be manhandled down, allowing Cas' touch and his taste to be like a drug and block out everything else. He knows that if Cas regrets this again, it's going to break Dean even more than before, but he couldn't stop himself even if he wanted to. He loves Cas, and he will take what he can get.
Gabriel wraps his hand around Dean's elbow and drags him inside. Sam's already there. Cas is nowhere to be seen. "Hey, kid," Gabriel greets happily, kissing Sam's forehead. "Take care of the big guy while I make food."
Dean feels himself freeze. He can feel Cas next to him in hyper focus and he can barely seem to breathe properly anymore. "Great," he says, trying to figure out why on earth he's reacting like this.
"My classes start the same day as yours, so I'll be leaving tonight and on my way back every day starting in... four days."
"You're welcome," Dean replies, dragging his eyes away from Cas' lips, "come on, pick out some tees you like," he gestures at the racks of tees surrounding them.
Sam sets up plates and cups for everyone, plus napkins, and goes to check on Dean.
"You don't believe me, do you?"
Dean laughs again, stopping right in front of his Baby. "Here she is," he says with a smile.
"Cas is obviously lying about the last part and look at Dean's dumb face, he's totally in love. Not at all," Sam replies.
Dean doesn't know what to say, so for a moment, he just doesn't say anything. He blinks and thinks and stares and blinks. "I- I" he tries, cursing himself when he can't force the words out, "you kissed me because of what I was saying about myself?"
Dean definitely doesn't squeak when Cas picks him up. Dean Winchester doesn't squeak. He is a little - well, a lot - surprised by it, and he maybe clings around Cas' neck a little- just so he doesn't get dropped of course - but he doesn't squeak.
"What happened?" Dean asks, his voice cracks slightly but he hopes Cas is too distracted to notice.
Dean frowned, "are you saying that asexuals wouldn't want to jump your bones? Or are you saying that you personally are asexual?"
"Since when are you qualified to make points?"
GREEN EYES GREEN EYES GREEN EYES GREEN EYES GREEN EYES
Dean sort of stops moving, and Cas looks at him confusedly as the person behind the counter asks for his order. "Uh... Dean?" he says hesitantly. "Dean? Are you alright?"
"Thanks," Gabe calls, smiling softly at his boyfriend's retreating back.
“Alright, so what’s the plan?” Dean asks the following day.
"Dialectology," Cas replies. "You?"
“You can’t be that.”
Cas laughs, almost wanting to hug Dean before remembering they just met and that's probably weird. He doesn't even know why he feels as if he's known this man forever. "Yeah, right," he mocks.
"I have two hundred fifty thousand dollars. I'll pay for your Baby. I know what she means to you."
"Yeah," Dean says as they walk past, "where are you spending the night? Because I'm assuming that you're not planning on driving home now."
"What are you studying?" Dean asks, just to make conversation and definitely not so he can hear more of that gravelly voice. Nope. Just a conversation between roommates.
"He can't resist me," Cas joked.
Cas gently strokes his hair, soothing him into sleep. When Dean's breathing evens out, he brushes his lips across Dean's temple and curls around him, quickly falling asleep himself.
“Our relationship was not built on a lie,” is the first thing Dean whispers. “And we have never had a problem. You and I, Cas, we’re made to last. We fight, yeah, who doesn’t fight with their spouse? We’ve never even really been in danger, though. Cas, you and I are okay. We’ve always been okay and we’re always gonna be okay. Don’t you dare forget that. And please, Cas, for the love of all that is holy, don’t give up on me.”
It's Green-Eyes from the pictures, but he's about 80 times hotter in person.
"Thank you," Dean whispers, "I don't how on earth I ended up with a soulmate as amazing as you, but I'm glad I did."
"Yeah I'm fine," Dean says, shaking himself out if his head and turning to the counter, "thanks," he says, ordering his pizza and hoping that he hasn't made Cas too worried.
Sam smirks at him. "That is what I was getting at." He kisses Gabriel's lips this time. "I want to."
"Are you okay?" Cas asks again, seriously concerned. "You were... thrashing and screaming. I think you were having a nightmare. What can I do for you right now? do you need anything?"
"Ok," Dean says, making a mental note to stand with Cas in social situations. Cas always seemed fairly realized around Dean, and if he could help him, he would. "Well come on, we have clothes to buy."
"You don't drink alcohol either?" Dean shouts over the party.
"Yeah, sorry," Dean muttered, unlocking the door and leaning back against the head rest, closing his eyes so he won't have to look Cas in the eyes.
"Dean. You are in pain. Let me examine you." Cas gently stretches Dean out on the couch. "Where does it hurt?"
Then Sam brushes it off. "Can we exchange numbers? You're gonna be around him all the time, so I need you to video all the embarrassing shit he does for blackmail." Sam glances around, then lowers his voice. "Actually that's a total fabrication, I need you to keep an eye on him and make sure he's emotionally stable. Every morning and every afternoon you gotta check in, you hear? And I need to know what's going on with him."
Dean frowns. Neither of those nicknames worked for the beautiful man standing in front of him. His bright blue eyes, his dark hair, his otherworldliness. No, neither of those would do.
Dean opens his door, climbing out and asking with a grin, "movie or something else?"
Dean stares out the window, watching the streets fly by as his brother drives towards the bar. He gets himself ready for an afternoon of fake smiling because he knows that's what's going to happen now. He's going to smile for Sam's benefit, but inside he is definitely not going to be smiling.
"You left for a reason," Dean points out quietly, "and that was my fault."
"Mod," Cas replies.
"Yeah that's the one," Dean confirms slowly, "you want to watch that one?"
Dean knows his face is probably as pale as a ghost, but he can't change that. He hates hospitals, he hates feeling helpless and he hates anesthesia. It's the forced unconsciousness, the fact that anyone could do anything, and he would just be asleep, unable to protect himself. He leans his head backwards, trying to find where Cas is standing, hoping that his friend will be able to calm him slightly.
"Well seeing as we were kissing at the time, I would expect that to clear it up," Dean says, his voice slightly hostile. He doesn't know what Cas saw that as, and he's starting to think he vastly misunderstood this entire situation.
me. And I never got to thank you for that. So just... just let me....”
Miracle soon follows behind Jack, running through his legs and straight towards Dean. He’s wearing a festive outfit too, a dog sweater that makes him look like a present wrapped in wool.
, his mind helpfully supplies.
"Then I guess I won't try," Cas replies. "Not until I find a way you'll be willing to hear."
"Possibly the most impressive thing I've ever done was assist Gabriel in waging prank war on our older brother Luci."
Dean walks out of the bathroom 3 minutes later wearing clean clothes and with slightly damp hair. He grabs his own shoes but pauses when he sees Cas. "What have you done to your hair?"
Sam scoffs. "Whatever."
"Close enough," Dean argues, "lunch, dinner, you pay, I pay. It's all food and money in the end."
Dean pauses for just a moment before following Cas upstairs, sitting down on the sofa with his hands between his legs as soon as he's up there.
Cas shrugs his bag onto his shoulder and smiles at Dean before making his way back toward their dorm, choosing to assume that Dean will follow.
"I'm fine," Cas tells him for the thirtieth time. "I am fantastic, in fact. I'm simply... processing some news that I got just now."
"Not really," Cas replies. "I'm not exactly a busy person, I don't know if you've noticed that yet."
"You wouldn't be a burden," Dean says quickly before adding, "it would probably save money to just drive together, you can ride with me."
"That's it," Cas says. "I can't." He walks past the man who used to be his friend and sighs. "I'll see you at Sam's graduation, Dean," he says sadly, not quite making eye contact. "Until then, stay out of my way."
to do my job or he might go crazy and if he goes crazy, I'm as good as dead. Take care of him." He handed Cas back his phone.
"Well now you've told me," Cas points out. "And I want to help you, Dean."
When Dean takes his hand Cas sighs in relief and pulls him onto the bed. "You want to tell me?"
Sam catches the keys Gabriel tosses him and follows, sliding into the driver's side and winking at Dean in the rearview before idling the engine and waiting for his soulmate. "Pick up the pace!" he shouts.
"If course he can't," Gabe laughs. "Who would be able to resist those baby blues?"
"Um," Cas looked down. "I'm paying my own college tuition. My family won't help. So I don't exactly have a lot of money for clothes."
Dean laughs, grabbing Cas' arm and pulling him towards a nearby circle, where a red headed girl appears to be telling an animated story.
"You pranked Lucifer?" Dean laughs, "now I really want to hear what happened. How do you even prank the devil?"
"You have nothing to apologize for," Dean assures quickly, "But I will be glad to get out of here as soon as I can."
Dean smiles, internally partying. Cas thought that Baby was beautiful! He doesn't know why he cares so much about Cas' opinion, but he does.
wanted to. I expected you to shove me off."
"Woah, alright. I was just coming to drag you to Sam's celebrating getting into Stanford party."
Cas shrugs. "Alright, if you say so." He moves on to his third slice of pizza. "So, then, tell me about Sam."
"I don't think anything you count as a problem could count as stupid," Dean replies with an easy smile, "you don't seem to think that being stuck with me is a problem, so clearly all your problems must be huge."
Cas nods. "Okay, if you say so, Dean." He picks up the phone and calls the number Dean pulled up.
Dean stares after Cas, with absolutely no idea what just happened but a sinking feeling that he doesn't want to know. "I'm going to go catch up with him," Dean says hesitantly, already following after Cas before he's even finished speaking.
Dean frowns, getting more and more concerned at what Gabe is talking about. Something is going on, and he really hopes Cas passes on the information, because if he doesn't find out his is not going to be pleased. He doesn't interrupt, planning to wait unto Cas is finished with the phone call to ask what's happening.
"Because -" Dean starts, unsure if quite how he should explain it. He finally settles on, "because it's a fucking trench coat." He hopes the rest goes without saying, or else he's really going to be questioning what rock Cas lives under.
Dean picks at the blanket, thinking. He's tired and wants to go to sleep, and if he can't then he needs to pay attention to the movie. Instead, he's paying attention to the gap between him and Cas and feeling the void within him opening up even more the longer they spend not touching. He holds his breath for a moment, shifting ever so slightly so that he can feel Cas' warmth against his side.
"To be fair we did technically just have dinner," Dean points out with a grin, "also you don't get to decide when I go to war. I can go to war whenever I want."
"Two reasons," Cas tells him. "Asexual and autistic."
to meet. Because of... God, or Destiny, whatever you choose to believe."
"A stack of pancakes with syrup please," Dean says, trying - and mainly failing - to ignore Sam and Gabe's clasped hands, "and a cup of coffee."
“College can wait five minutes,” Cas growls, snatching the book out of his hand. “Look at me.”
“My sister is coming for Christmas. She just got engaged. I haven’t seen her in years. I am going to be miserable and lonely.”
Sam nods. "Come sit at the table, Gabe's serving it up as we speak."
Dean gasps, his brain jumping into overdrive as it tries to figure out whether he should kiss back or pull away. On one hand, this is Cas. This is his soulmate. On the other hand, he isn't Cas' soulmate. Cas has some lucky guy out there, just waiting for Cas to turn up.
“Why wouldn’t I be the one asking
Cas shrugs. "You'd be surprised how dedicated I am." He grabs his bag. "Let's go back."
"Selfish," Dean echoes back helplessly, feeling his world crumbling around him. Cas isn't his soulmate - despite Cas being his - and now this? Everything he's done for Sam in all his 'miserable' life and he's still selfish? He tries his best to put everyone else first, he thought he was managing, but apparently not. Apparently, no matter how hard he tries, he can't change anything. The apple really doesn't fall far from the tree.
Cas bites his bottom lip and glances at the floor. "He's my soulmate."
Cas glances away. "Of course, Dean."
"I don't know," Dean laughs, feeling giddy which is probably due to the pain medication, but who's looking into that, "I've done some pretty wild stuff in my life which probably ranks just above not dying from appendicitis."
"Cas?" Dean asks hesitantly, the name just spilling from his lips. The same lips Cas had just been kissing.
Dean pauses for a second, "how can someone as hot as you be a virgin?" he asks incredulously, "I would expect everyone on this planet to be trying to jump your bones."
Once he gets to the hospital, they put Dean on a stretcher, and Cas breathes a sigh of relief.
"No it's fine, don't cancel on my account," Dean says, "I'll be fine, you go meet with your brother."
Cas smiles. "Comedies?"
Cas nods again.
Cas shrugs. "It's good. I enjoy it. As I said, I'm supposedly unsettling."
Dean gapes after Cas for a moment. Seriously? What is up with that kid? One moment he's acting all innocent, the next he's being a smug bastard. "I wasn't being as rude as you," Dean argues.
"I don't know," Cas told him. "I'm autistic. I don't know how to talk to people."
"Come on then," Dean shouts, grabbing Cas' arm again - just so he doesn't get lost of course - and practically dragging him through the crowd and over to where their brothers are standing.
Cas takes a deep breath. "I can't say what I want to say, Dean, because I will ruin everything that matters to me. I can't
Cas set the book down at sat down on his bed. "Why not, if you don't mind my asking?"
Sam and Gabriel are already sitting at a table waiting for them.
Gabriel drags them to his own apartment where the party is already in full swing. Cas turns around to say something to Dean only to discover that he's gone. "Great," he mutters. "Just fantastic."
Cas spends the day pretending to buy things from a variety of stores and coffee shops and when he returns, Dean is still at their room. "Hi," he says timidly.
"I didn't care much for him, but my older brother has become an even bigger douchebag since he died because he's in charge now, and I just- sometimes I want to punch him." Cas clenched his jaw. "Never mind. Forget I said anything. Let's just buy these things and get out of here."
"Really?" Dean asks, confusion spilling into his voice, "well I don't think you're unsettling," he assures his new friend, "and I don't know why anyone else would."
"Yep," Dean agreed. "And for fuck's sake, you can't just sleep with older guys- how much older than you is he? Do you even know? What's he majoring in? How many siblings does he have?"
Dean feels the tension in his body release as Cas leans back against him. He doesn't say anything, but a smile creeps across his face.
"No I'm not," Cas whispered. "But you're mine. You have some other lucky girl out there just waiting for you. That's why I never said anything."
"Apparently," Dean replies, not moving from where he is laying on the bed, "definitely on the outside. The inside is slightly more questionable."
Dean thinks about it for a moment, before crawling forwards and into Cas' open arms. His nightmare was even worse than normal, and he needs the reassurance of his soulmate, even if he has to be sneaky about it. "I'll try to remember that."
"Thanks," Cas mutters, suddenly aware that he's managed to make Sam uncomfortable. Shit, how does he always manage to do this? Clearly Dean is wrong. He said that he couldn't see how Cas could make anyone uncomfortable and here Cas is, making someone uncomfortable.
"That's a good point," Gabe says with a smile, "Cas has no powers that I know off, but apparently your brother deems him incredibly trustworthy."
"Tell me about yourself," Cas suggests as they eat. "Where are you from? What do you enjoy? What's your family like?"
Dean said.
"Great," Dean says happily as he picks through his box, pulling some of his items out to put away and leaving some of the others in the box to deal with later, "Cas it is then."
Cas leans in to kiss him again, pulling him close and keeping him
Cas pulls just slightly away from him. "I... yeah. Sure," he whispers, feeling subdued and spurned.
"Sorry," Dean whispers, "I don't mean to, I just - it's just how I deal with things I guess," he says, being as honest as he can with Cas. Dean trusts Cas, so he deserves to know what's up with Dean.
Cas smiles and digs into his food, effectively ending the conversation.
"I did," Sam's voice says, muffled by the speaker. "He didn't answer."
Sam laughs. "I have some classes here this semester. I was gonna meet with the TA to make sure I've got everything nailed down for it."
"Yep. You'll love it."
"That might be a good idea," Dean hums, pressing even closer to Cas.
"Thanks, I'll add it to my list of achievements," Dean says with an eye roll and a grin.
Cas nods. “Okay,” he whispers. He glances at the clock. “It’s late. I’m going to head to sleep. You can shower if you like.”
Cas darts to Dean's side. "I'm right here," he says. "Are you going to be alright?"
Cas nods. "Crowley. That's an interesting name."
“Okay. Why?”
"I'll protect you," Cas swears. "If he shows up I'll blow his brains onto our wall."
"I didn't say we were going to the same house," Sam informs him.
"Suck it, jerk," Sam mutters, flipping him off.
"You never change in front of people," Cas reminds him, tracing the pentagram inked into his left pec. "That's cool."
"Really? What do you pay attention to then?" he asks, trying to figure out why Cas always joins him watching movies if not for the movies.
"Blue?" Cas asked quizzically. "Why?"
Cas nods, then before he can lose his courage, pulls Dean against him and hugs him tightly.
"Great," Cas replied, combing his hair and pulling on a pair of shoes.
"Well yeah," Dean says with a laugh, "meeting new people normally involves seeing actual people you know."
Cas doesn't know what to say. Again. English is hard, talking is hard. It's harder for him. He sighs.
Sam takes a deep breath and very deliberately takes Gabriel's hand, still not looking away from his menu. He intertwines their fingers just as the waiter comes over. "What can I get you boys?" she asks.
Cas thinks if Dean weren't dragging him out of the room he might stand there, blushing and stammering forever. Dean thinks he's
"Anything would do," Dean whispers, quickly taking the lid off - which luckily wasn't on too tightly - and drinking it. The lukewarm water felt amazing in his parched throat, and he hadn't realized how thirsty he was, until he drank something.
"Hey Gabe," Dean says tiredly. He has dark bags under his eyes and he has the feeling he's probably lost weight, but he doesn't care. His soulmate doesn't want him, what reason is left to look after himself?
"Holy. Fuck," Cas says when he hangs up. He sits down on his bed, looking stunned. "Holy fuck."
"It's still none of your damn business," Dean replies, "friend or not, I'm not telling you."
"why are you just stripping in the middle of our room?" Dean asks, trying to hide his
"Not... really," Cas murmurs.
"Ok great," Dean says, heading to his car, spinning the keys around, "alright, hop in," he calls to Cas, climbing into the driver's seat.
"Right," Cas says, chuckling. "I had nearly forgotten the prime directive of our outing."
Cas makes to retract his hand. If Dean wants to sit on his ass on the floor, he can do that. "Your dad?" he asks hesitantly.
"Come on then," Dean says with a smile, "we should probably head off as well. Any plans for the rest of the day?"
"Usually," Cas admits. "It's not like I don't watch, but you're more interesting."
Cas bends down slowly, holding out a hand he doesn't expect Dean to take. "Are you alright?" he asks, Dean's only illumination in the dark the light from the screen.
"Ok," Dean says slowly, turning back to his pancakes and trying to avoid the weight of Cas' gaze which he was still sure he could feel, even though he was sure that Cas had turned away.
Cas looks up at him. "I just received a quarter million dollars."
"Okay," Dean says slowly, "so what do you look at anyway?"
Cas brushes his teeth in record time and is in his bed before Dean's done getting his things together. He rolls over to face the wall and mentally berates himself for being such an idiot in front of such a hot guy.
Cas's smile grew wider. "Talk to Sam... what's your last name? Because this is the first item on my To-Do list."
"You've never asked," Dean mumbles against Cas' lips, "and I'm not an artist. I just draw shit from time to time."
Cas smiles. "Good. Now who do I have to pay to allow you to keep your car?"
"Cas," Dean mutters breathlessly, looking up into the bright blue eyes of his soulmate, pushing at Cas' shirt to try and get him to take off.
Dean looks.
"Don't go," Cas says quickly, knowing that Dean doesn't want his brother to go, not yet anyway, "we haven't even got our food yet and I still want to get to know you." Dean scowls down at the table, but doesn't argue.
discomfort behind exasperation.
Cas scoffs, rolls his eyes, pulls on his coat, and sprints after Dean. "You can't just leave me like that."
Dean wakes slowly. He feels like he had just had the weirdest dream, but he can't quite remember what it was. He also feels like something was off, like there was something he was missing. He kept his eyes closed, listening out to try and figure out what was going on.
"Yeah, the dads who were helping us yesterday are our adopted dads," Dean explains uncomfortably. Just mentioning their bio dad makes his scars itch and he really wants to change the subject. Luckily before anyone else can ask anything, like Dean can see Cas wants to, the waiter walks over with some plates.
Cas slows. "That would be wonderful," he breathes. He points at one on Dean's shoulder. It's some sort of dragon or something, twisting around the base of his neck with the letters SJW on it. Slightly smaller, underneath, it says DMW.
They carry their bags out to the Impala and load her up, and as Cas settles into the front seat, Dean looks at him. “Thanks for lettin’ me come,” he mumbles. Cas smiles.
Cas smiles and takes the sweater from him. He was right; it is soft. He takes it over to the counter, then falters. "How are we paying for this?" he asks.
"Yeah I'm fine," Dean lies with a fake smile.
Cas can’t meet his eyes. "My father wrote a series of books. They spawned a very large online community. I may have... participated in some of the online community's discussion. And creation."
"My ungrateful mouth!" Gabe gasps dramatically, "what am I ungrateful for?"
Dean finishes brushing he teeth, rinsing his mouth out before turning to the door, "you better be decent out there Cas, in coming out," he calls, slowly turning the door handle.
Dean nods, picking up the first burger and looking at it uneasily. He hadn't realized how long it'd been since he ate anything proper, until he had real, solid food in front of him. His stomach was already revolting, but he knew that he had to at least try.
Cas tries to fight off his smile. "I suppose if that's the only good thing I get out of being stuck in a dorm with you for a year."
"That's it?" Sam laughed, eyebrows raised. "Cause you seem pretty damn intimate."
"It's called empathy, Dean," Cas tells him. "And I- I love you. I'm horrible, but I love you."
"The... animated film about superheroes?" Cas says uncertainly.
"Well we should look around, get to know the area, find the best food places and stuff. And we need to get you some casual clothes."
Cas avoids looking at Dean for any length of time longer than two seconds for the duration of the drive. It's quiet and peaceful. It's easier than talking.
Cas frowns. Dean hadn't said anything about dropping out of high school, but then again why would he? It probably isn't something he wants absolutely everyone to know. "Wait," he suddenly says, Sam's words catching up with him, "what's the TA's name? The one you're meeting with."
"Ok, ready?" Dean asks, emerging from the bathroom and starting to pull his shoes on.
"Yeah," Dean says, unsure why Cas looks quite so... shocked? Dean doesn't know, but Cas looks something. And for some reason, it hurts Dean to see it.
Dean bites his tongue to avoid saying what he wants to say. "No I'm not your dad," he says slowly, glaring at Sam as though his eyes could convey his message well enough, "that doesn't mean I can't worry about you and make sure you are certain about your bad decisions."
Cas can almost read his whole thought process on his face. "We'll see. Maybe I'll be his soulmate. Maybe then we'll
He turns around and runs into someone carrying a large box. "Oh, I'm sorry," he says practically springing out of the way. "I didn't mean to- hi." His lungs stop working when he catches sight of this man's face.
Cas feels unexpectedly touched by this. "I rarely get called something so mild as 'weird'. I'm often called 'freak' and 'nerd' and 'other'. I like it, I think." He smiles at Dean as he orders his pizza.
"Good news?"
"Perfect," Dean says with a smile, "I'm starving," he announces happily, standing up and then wincing as he looks down at himself and realizes how accurate his previous statement had been.
Cas shrugs. "Well. Sometimes it's as if we're both autistic."
Cas smiles and stands up, following him to the door.
"Do you want to watch a movie with me?" Dean asks. He knows it's a bad idea, the only way they could watch a movie will be on a computer, which will mean sitting pressed up next to each other to see the screen. But right now, Dean feels kinda fragile - not that he would ever edmit it out loud - he guesses that appendicitis will do that to a guy, and he kind of just wants the reassuring touch of his soulmate. Even if Cas doesn't know. And even if this makes Dean pathetic. And even if this can never be anything more than just this.
Cas’s face wrinkles in confusion. “Then..... as a friend—“
“Cas.” Kelly insists with a lighthearted laugh. “You can’t hide stuff from me. What’s on your mind?”
— but he had orders to follow. If those orders involved him being here to monitor the outside of the bar, that was what he would do. Cas was starting to wonder if Jack had set him up, wanting him to finally confront Dean after all these years of avoiding him. The thing was that he
Dean narrows his eyebrows at Cas and Cas is pouting back at him. How can an angel taking the vessel of a middle aged business man be so adorable at times?
“The Hallmark channel.”
“Well you’ll heal me then, won’t you?” Dean asks. “
“My boy’s been looking for you, you know.”
So what if Dean had been flirting? How else is he supposed to approach the feelings he’s been suppressing for years? He never knew that Cas could
“Why would Cas go on the tree?” Jack asks.
Cas and Jack leave for the Lebanon shops wearing their normal clothes, since angels aren’t affected by the weather. But the parental instincts of Sam, Dean, and Cas had him wearing a scarf around his neck, just in case newfound Gods get cold like humans do.
“I think he likes it.” Jack says, kneeling down next to Miracle and petting him.
Cas freezes.
“Then why haven’t you?”
“What?”
“Bobby.”
“We’re going to take down these walls, so everyone can live together freely. Human souls will not be confined to a memory anymore, but instead, they will create new memories with their loved ones.” Jack explains to the angels that stand before them.
Cas stares blankly at Dean, almost as if there was smoke coming out of his ears and his brain was malfunctioning.
Everyone is at peace, and for the first time in his life, Cas is learning to be more selfish with his desires.
it. You love him in a different way than you love me and Sam. But you don’t think he feels the same way?”
“I miss him, too. But the last time we spoke, I left him in an awkward position. I don’t want to have to face him and make him uncomfortable.”
Dean pats the young boy’s head. “Yeah, ‘course. We gotta make new traditions now that we’re all together as a family again.” Dean says, sparing a glance at Cas.
But Jack has already left the room with the floating holiday trinkets dancing in the air after him.
“What! Sam, he’s an angel! I can’t just —“ Dean waves his hands around dramatically.
“Yeah, it’s ugly alright.”
A quick
“I picked them out.” Cas says with a fond smile.
Sam makes his departure and leaves Cas and Dean alone with each other. Cas feels calm, like he always does when it’s just the two of them together. However, their dynamic has changed this time, and Cas is really hoping that Dean doesn’t think of him any differently. Despite the peace he feels around Dean, he is nervous about that.
Sam smiles proudly at his son. All the teaching about holiday traditions Sammy had been giving him are starting to show. “Yup, you and Cas should go shopping now. Dean and I will go when you get back.”
“Shh! Shhh!! The movie’s starting!” Jack says, and the other hushed voices in the room quiet down. At the opening credits, Jack is already mimicking a sword fight and swinging his arms while making whooshing sounds. Cas and Kelly share a knowing smile during his dramatic imitation.
Cas furrows his eyebrows and swallows the lump in his throat. “I’ve felt it since he arrived.”
you to be his father. You
He can’t stop staring and continues to watch Dean laugh at something Charlie says to him. Even just being able to stare at his back all day would be a privilege to the recently promoted Seraph.
He is in a requited love after all.
“You’re different.” Dean echoes, words from Castiel, from years before.
Cas looks at Dean silently. Dean is staring back at him sincerely, his eyes are so green and serene, and his cheeks are glimmering in the golden sun.
“You know what we’re missing?” Dean says, gesturing to the illuminated tree. “An angel.” He winks, in the direction of Cas.
could feel the same way humans do. You know, I always thought you just loved me and Sam like you love your angel siblings. I didn’t know but... I know now. And I’m glad you told me.” Dean confesses. “Because I’m ready. I’m ready now. I was... I had a hard time getting over your death, and then my own death. I had plans to —“ Dean laughs dryly. “Get a job, and quit the hunting life once and for all. I wanted to live for you, you know. Cuz I know that’s what you’d tell me to do, what you’d want me to do. But then coming here and hearing that you were alive and working with Jack in Heaven made me so..... relieved. I thought you would come, you know, to see me. I waited for you. Why didn’t you come?”
They were all settled in a house that looked eerily similar to Bobby’s old one, with couches and a TV set. They were sitting on a couch that seemed to fit everyone in the room — Sam and Eileen and Jo and Charlie, Bobby and Ellen, with Kelly, Benny, Kevin, and Dean.
“Okay.” Dean says. “Yeah, uh, thanks Sammy. Never thought I’d be asking
“Why?”
“Hey, Cas.” Dean greets, standing next to the man with a sly smile.
Cas stays silent, unsure of what to say.
“Is it something to do with… Dean?”
“You know I love you.” Cas says softly. “I adore you more than you could ever imagine.”
The white walls of Heaven start to crumble to the ground as the angels press their hands against the cold marble, grace seeping out of their palms and disintegrating the long hallway and every single door. Slowly but surely, people began to walk out of their memories from Heaven, lost and confused.
“Oh.” Dean says. “Then, do you still—“
“You have
Kelly nods. “I get that. But, Cas, when the time does come, he
Dean's eyes widen. Shit, did he just say he likes Cas? In a non-romantic way at all? They were talking about Hallmark movies! And he just blurted his feelings out without even realizing. How ironic...
“Looking good, kid.” Dean compliments.
Now in Heaven, a crowd of angels gathered around him and Jack. They listened to every word the nephilim had to say, akin to moths to a glowing light, their awestruck eyes focused onto their new God.
, Cas.” Dean stresses.
Kelly grabs his arm, forcing him to face her. “Cas, why don’t you think you deserve to be happy?”
“So, what’re we watching?” Dean asks.
Sam clears his throat. “I'm gonna go.... see if Ellen or Jo need any help back at the Roadhouse. Catch you later, Cas?”
he commands.
“Cas, will you grow some balls already?” Kelly complains, her hands flailing at her sides.
Cas’s face warms and his chest starts to ache.
“Cas.” Kelly remarks with a grateful smile. “I never got to thank you for raising Jack.”
Cas stares at her wide eyed.
That was too much for Dean’s self-sabotaging heart to process. But, it took time, and it took Cas coming back from the dead for the sixth time for Dean to realize that he has to let Cas know that he loves him too.
“Don’t eat it, Dean, you’ll get sick.”
Cas and Jack have work to do.
“Yet you still managed to die from tetanus? Did you not take your shot, Dean?” Cas asks, in a teasing tone.
Dean mentally prepares himself for whatever teasing Sam has decided to inflict upon him today.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Sam asks with a frown.
“But don’t you feel it?” Jack presses. “The longing?”
Dean grins and he’s glowing pink. He nods against Cas’s cheek and they waste no time kissing again. Out of all the wonderful experiences the world has to offer, Cas has decided that there isn’t a better feeling than Dean’s lips against his. Cas is melting in Dean’s arms, and for the first time, he feels a thrill beyond compare.
Dean grumbles to himself. “So I’m useless, is what you’re saying?”
Dean goes on, nothing is keeping him back from pouring out his heart. “I thought you knew, back then, in Purgatory, I was gonna tell you. I couldn’t bear to part with you then, and I can’t bear to part with you now, so you can’t leave me behind. You can’t make any more deals, goddammit. And don’t freaking sacrifice yourself anymore. Cuz there’s nothing worse in this world than losing you.”
“Do you like it here?” Cas asks.
He sneaks a glance in Cas’s direction and
Dean shuffles his shoes closer to Cas, his hands in his pockets. He leans forward and back, teetering on his heels like a young kid. “Soooo…Cas.”
“I didn’t expect for you to be here so
“Shut up, Sam.” Dean mutters. He glances back at Cas who’s staring straight at him, then quickly looks away. “Give me one of those.” He scoots in between Sam and Cas and takes a cookie cutter in the shape of an elf and starts pressing it into the dough. His cheeks are burning and he tries to hide it by lowering his face and pretending to be concentrated. He feels Sam’s eyes on him, his stupidly over-concerned little brother, and ignores him.
"Fine!" Gabriel shouts. "If you're going to be stubborn like that, I won't help you."
"I could defend you in court," Sam murmurs, glancing at him and laughing. "'Course, I'd have to get my degree first and I'd have to pass the bar exam
"Ok great," Dean says jumping out of bed, grabbing some clean clothes and walking to the bathroom, "I'll be four minutes."
