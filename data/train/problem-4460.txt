Dean watches his eyes flutter shut and can't tell if he wants them to open again or if it would be easier to do this without that piercing gaze staring straight into his soul.
He looks at a loss, shifting back and forth as if he isn’t sure how to proceed. Dean lets him, cracking one eye open to watch.
The bunker still needs to be child proofed, who knew when Jack would start crawling, and they couldn’t leave swords and spells and herbs laying around.
It’s waking up in the morning and finding a case to work on, Cas by his side. It’s saving the day and coming home to his family alive and well.
him, and he thought he couldn't have him. It was a horrifying mirror of everything Dean had felt, two people who think they can't have what they want with each other because they never learned how to communicate properly.
Dean couldn't hurt Jack even if he wanted to at this point. It would feel too much like a betrayal. Cas is gone, he won't care, he won't show up suddenly to judge Dean and all the ways he’s fucked this up already and still Dean can’t go against his final wish.
He also has the trench coat in one hand and Dean sort of already misses him wearing it. Dean grabs it anyway and places it over Jack’s sleeping form the same way he does every night. He lets his finger brush the baby’s cheek.
Finally they meet, and when Sam presses the blade close to his throat, Dean leans into it. He pushes closer until he can feel it bite into the soft skin of his neck. It’s something, anything, besides the ache in his shoulder, and the ants crawling under his skin, and the panic in his gut.
Dean hasn’t been able to see Cas’s wings in over a year, since they had cured him. But sometimes he felt like he could. Like there was an after image seared into the back of his eyelids.
“Cas.” Dean wills his hands not to shake as he pulls a onesie over Jack’s head, doesn’t look up as Cas finally pauses in his pacing to look at him. He can’t meet his eyes, he won’t be able to get through this if he does. Dean opens his mouth again, but nothing comes out, his throat clicking painfully.
Dean wakes up surrounded by warmth. The overwhelming feeling of safety settling over him like a blanket.
They share the responsibility for Jack the same way they have been the past few days, but Dean suddenly realized how helpless he is in the face of Cas caring for Jack.
Him and Sam switch off on driving in six hour shifts. Dean doesn’t sleep for long when it's Sam’s turn to drive. When he closes his eyes he sees flames, blood soaked grass, silver peaking through a white shirt. He doesn't cry.
Sam still isn't awake when they make their way to the kitchen. Or maybe he is, but he already left on one of his runs, doesn't really matter to Dean.
Sometimes it's easy for Dean to forget that Cas isn't human. He lets Dean drag him around by the edge of his coat, moves in tandem with Dean so he can be as close as possible without getting in the way. Dean steps forward and Cas steps back, the same way that he moves in closer as Dean moves away.
Cas carefully pulls Jack from Dean’s hands and Dean notices how much steadier his hands are already as he leans him against his shoulder, a hand on Jack’s back to steady him. He’s already falling into his role of dad and caretaker quickly.
Cas follows him silently, to Dean’s relief. He seemed to be waiting for Dean to continue, a brief glance revealing the pinched look was still marring his features.
Cas trails after him, his hand tightens on Dean’s waist as he pulls away. His eyes flutter open searching Deans for an answer he already knew. Dean just smiles in answer and fully steps away.
He should have been there. Him and Sam could have saved Missouri, together they could have all made it out alive. It could have been the win they needed after such a long run of losses. Because, more than anything, Dean wants to win something. To go into a fight and come out the otherside without losing everything that's important to him.
does right now. It leans closer and closer, pushing into Dean’s space like Cas should, and, even if the eyes still aren’t right, Dean can’t find it in himself to fight back.
While Jack never quite screams the way he did at the pyre, he is suddenly no longer a quiet baby. It seems to have awoken something in him and the only time he had quieted since was while they were driving.
“Don’t you dare leave, not when you know I can't follow you.” Dean growls out. He can’t grab Cas and make him stay here. Not when he has Jack in one hand and a bottle in the other.
“Just because you have a kid now doesn't make you my dad, too.” Dean just leaned back throwing his hands up in surrender. Claire gives him one last glare before turning to look at Sam. “So do we know what this thing is? He was some old dude right? A ghost maybe?”
“No Dean, you're really not.” Sam lets out a frustrated sigh and sits in the chair across from him. Dean tries to glare at him, but Sam keeps giving him the same sad look. “You act like you’re doing fine, but you’re not.”
wake up from a nightmare or a baby crying or some other crisis startling him out of sleep. He hasn't been able to sink into wakefulness like this in far too long.
Dean can feel the lump in his throat, and tries to blink back tears from his eyes. He refuses to get emotional, twice in one day was already enough, he can't do it again.
Dean gently lays Cas on the table, hovers over him for a couple moments, letting his lips brush Cas’s forehead in the whisper of a kiss. Another thing he’s wanted for years, now suddenly obvious in the face of his friends….
It’s not scary, the fact that he doesn't remember his own name, because by the time he thinks on it long enough to feel the fear settle in his gut, it fades from his mind as if it never existed in the first place. He can’t quite remember what he is and isn’t supposed to know.
The hair on the back of his neck stands on end as static fills the hallway. One last throb of pain lances through him as he’s pulled into Cas’s arms. It’s a prayer answered, because if Sam won’t do it Cas will.
“It can't be too hot, just about here is right.”  Dean fills the tub just enough to reach Jack’s belly button. Cas places Jack on the counter, cushioned by a soft mat that Dean had placed there for that very reason, and starts pulling off Jack’s outer clothes.
He tries to breath through the pain in his chest when he wakes up at night to a baby screaming and he has to deal with it by himself. When he looks into Jack's eyes and can only see Cas staring back at him.
Maybe it’s for the best that he wasn’t hunting right now. Who knows how sloppy his grief would make him and he didn’t have the energy to fight for his life.
“I miss him so much, kid.” He takes a sharp breath through his nose and runs his fingers down Jack’s baby soft cheek, lets his hand rest on the trench coat covering himself and the baby. He can feel the tears gathering in his eyes and feels almost ashamed of himself. He thought this was done after the nursery incident. He didn't have time for tears, not now. “I try to be okay for you and Sam, but sometimes I just want to lay down and go to wherever he is.” Jack looks at him as if he understands, he grips Dean’s fingers like a lifeline.
Dean paces a cage that doesn't exist. He drags the king of hell across the country, chasing some sort of relief from the burning in his chest, in his shoulder, centered in a faded handprint that he has no business caring about anymore.
to understand but not enough to see the whole truth, overlapping, merging, the same story told millions of times. His mom curled around the phone in the kitchen, tone haunting as the words spit from her mouth like venom. Jack’s intelligent gold eyes layered over his own green, watching as one of their parents walks out a door, anger in their gait.
like a mantra. He doesn't even get to process the second part of the statement, just awkwardly clearing his throat.
“You don't get to Han Solo me, buddy.” Dean says before leaning back in for another peck. “Say it back.”
“You’re good with him.” Cas comments as Dean starts to dress Jack, warming his feet between his hand before sliding his socks on. Dean can barely hear him over the high pitch cries, still worrying that Jack would let out one of his infamous sonic blasts, but it makes him look up all the same.
They always seem to lose. This is what the fourth, the fifth, time they've lost Cas? Though it was never this final. There was never a flash of light, never an imprint of wings on the ground. Dean can still see the blinding light when he closes his eyes, an afterimage burned onto the back of his eyelids. Just another thing to haunt him.
remember blue eyes. Not the name attached to them, or the exact shade, but he knows that they’re blue. He knows that they’re important.
At one point, while Dean had disappeared with Jack, Jody must have called because Dean returns to Cas hovering over some old lore books, his nose crinkling up as Jody laughed at him through the phone. He looks mildly offended and Dean wants nothing more than to smooth out the crease in his brow, take some of the weight off his shoulders.
“If you want, I’ll finish up here and you can go take the bottle to the kitchen.” He gestures with his free hand towards the bottle on the dresser.
“Hey Cas,” Something catches in Deans throat and he runs one of his fingers down Jack’s cheek. “I want you to meet your son, Jack.”
Jack is a newborn now, but he won’t be for long. It’s good to be close to your kids, and Dean is planning on sticking around for as long as Jack will let him, but he can’t keep going the way that he has. It was evident in the worried looks Sam constantly threw his way and now it’s even more noticeable in glances Cas gives him.
Dean mentally shakes himself out of his thoughts, looking back at Cas. He finds Cas watching him as well with a curious gaze, his head tilted to the side. Dean just shakes his head slightly, and smiles softly before tuning back into Claire and Sam’s conversation.
When he was unsure or upset he would run his hands along it, as if Cas could feel it, as if it would somehow make him appear. It would ease the ache in his chest, calm him when he was angry. When he was halfway to damnation, the mark beating a tattoo in his head, it kept him human. It let him know that Cas wasn't Cas anymore, that Lucifer had stolen his face.
Cas has never been this distant, even before the fall when he was nothing more than a soldier. Cas was always close at hand, lingering within arms reach. It was Dean's job to push and pull him in and out of his personal space. Now, he stands across the room from Dean, stays out of range like there’s a boundary he can’t cross. There’s no brush of hands as they walk, no lingering looks.
The trek upstairs feels as if it takes a lifetime. The silence is telling. There are no more screams or grunts, no yelling or fighting.
his mind sings like a mantra—but finds he can't move. His breath is stuck in his throat as Cas lets out a gasp, silver peaking through tan, red seeping along a white shirt like a leviathan's poison through the thin skin of a neck. For a moment the sight before him blurs, overlaps, black flowing out of every pore, rot crawling up cracking skin, an explosion of blood. White overtakes his vision. Something screams in the distance and it takes him only moments to realize that it was Jack, shrill cries echoing along the water like a siren.
“You would love Cas.” He says one day out of the blue. He had talked to Jack before, but not like this. Never about Cas.
the voice in his head sounds like Chuck, it sounds like John, it sounds too much like the man Dean used to want to be.
Dean can't light the pyre when it comes down to it. He was able to build it; he was able to wrap Cas’s body up for the last time, able to place him so gently on the pile next to Kelly, but actually lighting it? It’s too final, it would mean admitting that Cas is actually….
Dean has to pause when he ties the first slip of fabric around Cas’s feet. The finality of it strikes him and his entire body curls in on itself. He has to grip the table, face turned to bury his nose in the newborn's hair. This may be the last time he ever sees him; there's no coming back from a full salt and burn.
There’s no one else here, no whispers in the distance, just black shadows as far as the eye can see.
The image slips out of his mind as soon as he pictures it, but it leaves a desperate sense of longing in its place.
Jack stares up at him, his eyes seeming more and more intelligent as the days pass. Once he starts talking to him it's as if the dam breaks, words spilling out like a prayer.
Cas has him already, of course. He is tucked against his chest, safe. His wings are out, a testament to just how upset he is, stretching and folding, sparking a dangerous gold where Cas is brushing his fingers through them. It reminds Dean of his nightmare, fire crawling up tanned skin and dark pants. It's enough that he grabs Cas’s hand, stopping his path, pulling him away from the baby's wings. He twines their fingers together, curled back up on his side, nearly a perfect mirror to the night before, his face is buried in Cas’s side.
Kelly had a wrap, folded neatly over the crib bars, directions printed and underlined on the changing table next to it. Dean makes sure the wrap is correct and tight, keeping the baby close to his chest, high enough that he could feel his soft puffs of breath against his chest. The cloth supporting his head. He can already hear the mocking he was going to get from Sam.
Dean doesn't even manage to turn off the impala, barely manages to put it in park before he’s stumbling out. His legs nearly collapse beneath him.
He can’t remember much to be honest, the thoughts flow from his mind like water down a stream, always moving but never exactly the same. Words are spoken to him and lost as soon as he stops thinking about them. Names, places, deeds all disappearing as soon as the next word leaves their mouths.
Blue eyes and black hair that sticks up in wild tufts, like he couldn’t be bothered to fix it. Hands that have healed Dean, that have hurt him and then cradled his face so tenderly.
Cas was going to live a happy life here and Dean would give almost anything, anything to have this for real. To carry Cas over the threshold of the bunker, Sam, Mom, Jody, and the girls laughing in the background. To fight over the colors of the nursery and what toys to get.
“Good.” Dean clears his throat almost awkwardly, taking a step back as Cas gets off the bed, scooping Jack up along with him. “Yeah let’s do that.” Dean does a heel face turn and leads their little group out of his room before pausing abruptly enough that Cas almost bumps into him.
“Dean.” Cas finally spoke, a sigh of annoyance (directed at Dean or himself, didn't really matter) escaping his lips. “I don’t know how to burp him.”
Dean pulled his jeans back up and stepped out. He held the boxers up for everyone to see before dropping them to the floor. The room cheered. He paused at Castiel’s feet and met his friend’s eyes. Castiel was blushing profusely and his gaze skittered away quickly.
“You could have just called out,” Castiel said, grumpily rubbing his eyes. He seemed unconcerned about his nudity, so Dean rolled his eyes and covered him up too.
Castiel pinched another piece of the Philadelphia roll between his fingers and raised it to Dean's mouth. Dean carefully wrapped  his lips around the morsel, taking a good section of Castiel's thumb and index finger into his mouth. He licked his tongue under the roll and between the digits, flicking into the soft spot where they connected at the palm. Castiel's breath hitched.
Castiel groaned. He’d been working at his laptop when he got distracted for the fifteen millionth time that day and tabbed over to Facebook.
“Oh yeah,” Dean told him, casually taking another sip and twirling the bottle in his fingers. “I like a man who can take me to my knees.”
They were two blocks out when the radio started a new song and Castiel sang with it, “Pour some sugar on meee,” and Dean supplied, as if in sub-conscious habit, “in the name of looove.”
God he loved that chest. The little freckle above the right nipple, the curve of chiseled pectorals. Before Castiel could finish pushing Dean’s dress shirt off his shoulders, he shoved Castiel back onto the bed and climbed on top to lick up every angle, every mark he could find.
Cas blinked, his lips parting just slightly. Dean had expected him to smirk, to double down on whatever ploy he was up to, so the confusion was… well, confusing.
Their tools were spread throughout the little area, and Sam and Cas helped retrieve them, getting them resituated in the bag. They took their time, knowing that they’d need to smother the fire and refill the grave before they left, and not wanting to do that until they were certain Gatlin was gone for good.
Abaddon had been his hope, his ticket to the six fingered man. She had connections, hell, she probably knew the man herself. He
Dean sat up so he could look at Castiel more closely and meet his gaze. There was hardly any light in the room, but Castiel’s dark blue eyes still seemed to shine somehow. He wanted to do something huge and meaningful. He settled instead for squeezing Castiel’s folded hands, mumbling, “Good for you,” and laying back down.
It was fine though. Dean just needed to get over his crush. You don’t date your roommate, and that was that. If he could get his dick (and heart, let’s be real) to agree, that would be great.
He didn’t let Dean get another word in. Just turned and stomped off down the street in the direction opposite of the Impala.
“That’s not the story I’m telling,” Dean said. “Though I might if those two don’t stop with the gagging faces.”
“Waking you up,” Charlie said. “The sun’s up, and neither Kevin nor Sam had the balls to come get you.”
“Holy mother—” Castiel’s fingers tightened on his head and Dean’s hand wrapped around the back of Cas’s thighs, urging him to thrust forward.
“Sleep, Dean,” Castiel said, stroking the back of his hand back and forth gently on Dean’s skin. “We will find him. Sooner or later he will pause too long and we will catch up with him. Until then, you still need sleep.”
“Good to know where he falls on your priority list,” Sam said. Dean shot him a look and was met with a pair of amused, raised eyebrows. This, this was why he never tells Sam about hook ups.
"When was the last time you opened your eyes?" Castiel asked, now topless and reaching for his pants. "You didn’t, you wanton mess. You were too desperate for something filling your ass, too needy to come to bother opening your eyes and make sure you were still alone."
Right in front of Dean, a girl tripped. She screamed and covered her head, a demon flying straight at her.
“No,” Castiel agreed. “But that doesn’t mean there wasn’t a kill. The guards could have already discovered a body. Maybe we should check with them.”
Dean took several deep breaths, trying to calm his heart and libido just enough to be able to think properly again.
Sam sighed. Kevin was starting to slide to the ground and he'd already dropped his sword. He reached for Kevin and still had to dodge a punch.
Kevin sighed. “You never mentioned the murdering bit,” he grumbled to himself. “And I didn't much like the kidnapping part in the first place.” He said it so quietly that Dean was sure he was the only one who heard him.
There was chuckling next to Dean’s ear. He wanted to take it and bottle it so he could listen to that laugh forever and always.
The kill, a large raccoon, was roasting over the fire and the delicious smell permeated the cool night air. Dean and Castiel were sitting on separate logs, but on the ends that put them fairly close. Castiel was shirtless still, and while Dean was huddling closer to the fire to chase the chill away, Castiel seemed quite comfortable as he was.
Castiel gasped, fresh pain springing behind his eyes. “Not…” he had to swallow before continuing, “not intentionally.”
He turned to tell Castiel that he had to leave, but Castiel was already there. He handed Dean his shirt, his face pensive.
“Oh,” Kevin said in surprise, moving a hand to the wound. He stumbled, his back eventually colliding with a wall. His stomach hurt like hell, pain radiating everywhere. That was it, he was going to die. “Forgive me mother. I tried.”
Dean screamed as he came. He was barely aware that his arms were suddenly free as Castiel shuddered, pushed in deep, and followed him into bliss.
Of course, Crowley didn't particularly want a partner of any gender. He was a loner. When he wasn't busy with the affairs of state, he was hunting in the woods. Women did not hunt, and men would be intimidated by his prowess. They would become jealous and Crowley didn't have time for any of it.
As Dean crawled in to one side of the bed, Castiel fluffed an animal skin blanket and laid it over him.
“What?” Dean hollered. “If you want it done better, next time ask somebody who gives a shit about all of this stuff.”
“You should stay with me,” Dean said. “Sam and I, we move around a lot, I don’t know how much longer we’ll be here, but. But if you wanted, if you’d come with me…”
“Well that’s just peachy,” Dean responded. Castiel hummed his agreement. “Why didn’t you just tell me?”
Castiel rolled his eyes, reached for Dean’s outer shirt’s collar, and pulled him into a deep, sinful kiss, and pushing him back just as suddenly. “You’re lucky you’re hot when you’re giving orders,” Castiel said.
“I’ve never been,” Castiel admitted in a smooth tone. He was not remotely winded. Well, that figured, he looked like a runner or something. “I’ve never had occasion to go all the way up the path. But I can’t imagine it’s much further.”
So at first light, they packed up the horses and Dean led them all to the edges of the Great Forest. Then he guided them further still into the lands, heading straight East.
Dean backed away, muttered something under his breath and headed to his room. Shaking off the sensation that Dean had been embarrassed, Cas kept scrolling until he found a landscape picture he’d taken on a vacation to the lake. Between the sky and the water, it was filled with blue. And Dean was only barely in it, at the very bottom corner, floating on his back as the warm summer sun swept over his golden skin. Surely he couldn’t protest that choice.
“I'm not a witch, I'm your wife!” Charlie said, smacking her again. “But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.”
“All right. Where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right and who is dead.”
Their hips were flush again and Castiel was grinding Dean into the door. Not that Dean was complaining- his hand that wasn't tight against Castiel's skull was gripping Castiel's ass, pulling him closer.
Dean was pissed. Pissed and freaked. More pissed than freaked though. He spent the entire evening with the guy and even if he hadn’t, he knew within minutes of meeting him that Castiel was not a murderer. He was never in danger, and Dean still believed that. Yet, Castiel had lied and was obviously involved in the case somehow. Mostly though, he was pissed because he’d spent the entire night with the guy and it was all cloaked in lies. At that moment, he didn’t even care that some of them were his own.
“I believe, now that sunlight is breaking and people are starting their day, that someone discovered the body,” Castiel said calmly.
There was a press of lips to the back of Dean’s thigh and then fingers—he had no idea how many at this point—were pulling out of him. Cas reached back into the nightstand and pulled out a condom. He used his teeth to rip it open and slid it on, adding a little more lube with a few strokes. Dean held his legs open as Cas climbed back into position. Pressure was back at his hole and he tensed.
Dean stalks over to the crib ready to feel the snap of wood under his heel before it feels like he's been doused in freezing water.
. He’s not drawn in, there’s no want threating to consume him, just a nauseating mixture of hate and something that thinks it’s love, but isn’t.
By a month in, Dean was crashing and burning, dragged, kicking and screaming into sleep with Jack whether he wanted to or not because he was just so
Jack was currently laying on his thighs, one of Dean’s fingers gripped tightly in one hand as he slept while Dean searched through the news on his phone with his other hand.
Dean move him wherever he wants, evident by the fact that Dean couldn’t shake the hand on his wrist even if he wanted to.
Cas. His mind latches onto that for some reason, the weight of it settles in his mind and it sounds right. The answer to a question that he’s already forgotten.
and they're already fighting again. The thought scares Dean. A nearly forgotten conversation ringing in his head like a fucking gunshot.
Castiel. Sam had said his name was Castiel, but they call him Cas. Cas was important to Dean. He can tell just by the lingering feeling saying his name sends through Dean’s bones. The shiver down his spine when he thinks of soft hands that he can’t even properly remember.
Gently, not to disturb Jack’s sleeping form, Dean picks up Cas. With every step towards the pyre the weight in his arms grows heavier. It settles in Dean’s chest and chokes him.
“Dean, don't.” Dean ignores Sam’s voice, moving to pick up the small body on the bed. Much smaller than Dean remembered Sam being, nothing more than 5 and a half pounds at most. Sam was a big baby, who grew into a much bigger man and Dean can feel the phantom weight of him in his arms. It was far too heavy a weight for a 4 year old to carry.
Dean wanders the aisles of the store and ignores the cooing of the women wandering alongside him. Once or twice he swears the same woman passes by him just to look, ignoring whatever was in the aisle he was in, high chairs or some crap like that.
“What was that?” Michael raises one eyebrow, placing the rest of his hand along the mark. A wave of nausea hits Dean and he lets out a wounded sound.
Cas had said this didn't change anything, but it did. It had to, because Cas loves him. He isn't worried about how other people can use that against him, how
But Dean can feel someone. A dangerous tug on his shoulder, a pull at his very soul. The same thing that had pulled Dean out of hell now calls to him, just like it always has. It's a siren call to move nearer, to press closer and closer and closer. It's a piece of Dean that’s not Dean, but might as well be for how long it's been with him. It’s a sliver of grace that has made a home in his soul after eleven years, but still yearns to be close to its origin.
“I’m not?” Dean says mouth twisted into a snarl. “You won’t even admit mom's dead.” He can feel Jack shifting and quickly lowers his voice. “You spend all your time locked in your room trying to figure out a way to bring her back instead of doing our jobs like we’re supposed to.”
“Okay, yeah let’s get some breakfast.” Dean turns again, but not before he catches the glimmer of happiness in Cas’s eye.
Jack, for what it's worth, just gives him the same confused look he does whenever Sam’s hair is pulled up and away from his face. Dean had learned from one of the mommy blogs that kids tend to freak out when people they're close to change their appearance suddenly, something about a lack of object permanence. Jack had never fully freaked out about Sam changing his hair or Dean shaving, but it did always seem to take him a moment to get over his confusion.
Since Sam had left, Dean has taken to letting Jack sleep with him again. He would nap with the baby tucked in his sling or curled up on his chest. He spends nights in Dean’s room, the bassinet close enough to touch without getting off the bed. Even then, many nights Dean will give in and let the baby sleep on him.
“Thank you, Jack.” Dean mutters, sliding him into Cas’s arms. “I’m glad someone here appreciates my humor.”
“If you get tired of holding him, you can always hand him over.” Dean smacks a pan onto the stove and lets it heat up. “Or I have this sling thing that I’ve been using when I need both hands.” Dean is careful to avoid mentioning Kelly’s name, unsure of how Cas would take it. Knowing someone was dead is different than having the fact shoved in your face, and Cas had grown close with Kelly from what Dean had seen of the house.
“Sammy.” The word on his tongue tastes wrong. It’s a betrayal. Only Dean is allowed to call Sam that and whatever he is, it’s not Dean anymore, not really.
Dean watches as the bunker door slams shut with a loud clang, leaving Cas and him alone once again. He tries to avoid the strange anxiety sitting like a lead weight in his stomach and instead claps his hands together with a smile.
Dean finds him curled up, looking more like a lost child than a warrior of God. He doesn't react to Dean’s presence. Cas lays there, his arms curled over his head, protecting himself from something unseen and it makes Dean’s chest hurt. He looks resigned, eyes squeezed shut, knees pulled tight to his chest, tucked completely under his trenchcoat.
There wasn't much in her basic appearance: blonde hair, far too similar to how his own was as a baby, a spatter of freckles across the bridge of her nose, a jacket that she had stolen from his own closet.
Cas tilts his head, looking between Jack and Dean curiously. For a beat, Dean thinks that Cas is going to try to continue the conversation from the kitchen, to drop another bomb and upend his frame of mind for what would this be? The third time in twenty four hours? But instead he reaches out to lay his hand on Jack's back.
When the bunker door opens, revealing a windswept Sam, it's as if he can finally breathe again. All of them are in the bunker, safe and sound where he could make sure they were all okay.
Sam is completely still as Dean finally enters Kelly’s room and terror creeps up his spine. If something has happened to Sam, Dean wouldn’t leave. He would sit there and wait. Wait until the angels or demons or whatever god forsaken creature finds them and….
Cas knows. He has to. Or, at the very least he’s thinking it, but he doesn't push and Dean couldn't appreciate it more. His throat is still closed painfully as he measures out the formula, buries his nose in Jack’s hair, tries to ground himself enough to finally come out and say it.
Dean stared at the sword, fists clenching and unclenching. He was a thief. Of course, he’d given that up years ago, but he was a thief, and his father was a drunk. There was no way he had king’s blood in his veins.
Anna sighed. Like her, he also didn’t stop asking when the question mattered. “I thought about it,” Anna admitted, picking at her leggings. “Maybe in a different life, I would have said yes. Let’s just say I see the appeal, and that was three years ago. But Cas-“
That was irritating. “It better damn well be okay, since you wouldn’t let me pull away last night,” Dean told him.
“Shit,” Dean groaned as Castiel shoved him against the just-closed door. He might have mumbled more if it wasn’t for Castiel smashing their mouths together, his hands frantically scrambling at Dean’s shirt.
When he'd come to on the rocky Cliffs above Eel Bay, Kevin had taken off down the path for Sam, and discovered where he must have scuffled with the Man in Black, but there was no Sam. He traveled further down the path where he discovered the remains of a picnic, two wine glasses and a tablecloth, but no one else.
“C’mon, Dean. Let’s get it back to Gabriel, so he can get it back to Anna, and you can get back to… Yeah, I’m not going to finish that statement.”
“Alright, my idea, I’ll go first,” Jo said. Her eyes scanned around the room. “Sam!” Sam being the youngest in the group by 4 years, jumped at being called first. “Truth or dare?”
Chuckling, Cas held up his hands. “I’m only teasing, Dean. You don’t have to tell me. Though it’s hard to imagine we have many secrets left between us.”
Turns out, Dean’s idea was to drop Sam off at home and then head to a stage and practice some more. Not exactly what Castiel had been hoping for, but then again, he was hoping for far too much when it came to Dean.
“S’alright. I can get back from here,” Dean said as he began to walk away, stumbling once, like he was drunk.
Castiel’s lips thinned, but he was already nodding his reply. “Someone was killed recently,” he said, voicing Dean’s fear.
Castiel was visibly stunned. He fish lipped for a few moments. While Dean geared up to continue shouting, Sam silently clicked the door shut behind him and turned the lock.
Dean had just leaned forward and pressed their lips together when Sam found them and informed them that the cast and crew were headed to The Roadhouse for food and munchies, and he would not like to be an hour late, thank you very much.
“Hey little guy,” Dean said, rubbing a finger on the owl’s breast. “Where’s Cas, huh?” He looked around but couldn’t spot him anywhere. “Castiel?”
Charlie chuckled. Then, “Wait, you met someone? Is she pretty? Does she have red hair? Could you describe her tits in detail—”
The truth is, he doesn’t know his boss that well. He’d only been working for him for a few months, which is probably why he was so willing to let Dean go, he hasn’t really proved himself yet. But you didn’t have to know the guy on a personal level to know he is hot. And while he could be strict, he was cool and in command of himself and those around him at all times. Dean could be intimidated by him at the same time he was fighting off a boner under his desk.
At the news, Kevin jumped out of the bed and hit his head on a rafter, falling back in bed, unconscious.
They made good time for a while after that, Dean thinking they might just get out of this alive. He'd dropped Castiel's hand and was picking his way across the forest floor, daydreaming about what they would do when they got out of this place. Which was probably why he was distracted enough to not notice the swamp floor change.
One of Dean’s many gifts was having a second sense for trouble, and it was going off. He scanned the bar for the source and it didn’t take long to spot the problem. Some huge guy with a bad farmer’s tan was hitting on a girl at the bar, and from the way she was trying to push him away, she didn’t seem to appreciate it.
When he’s done spilling and reality is starting to come back into focus, Castiel removes his hand and reaches for a tissue from the box on the desk. He cleans his hand, throws the tissue away, and reaches for another. Then he cleans the come that had dribbled onto Dean’s skin too, and who would have thought he could be so tender?
“Hey Kevin,” Castiel said, catching his elbow as he headed off stage to do a costume change. “What time was the party tonight?”
Victor, Jo, and Gadreel all voiced their agreement, and just because Castiel wasn’t quite at the point where he wanted to die and sink into the floor with his embarrassment, Pamela chimed in, too.
Castiel looked up from his position between Dean’s legs, his lips wrapped around Dean’s girth, and his eyes conveyed all of his arousal, understanding and new found sense of urgency.
And if the way one of Castiel’s hands had scrambled at his shirt, took hold, and pulled him in closer were any indication, they were completely on the same page.
Even though it was irrational, Dean felt like an ass, interrupting the mourning of the people in the tavern to ask for some food and a room for the night. He passed on his sympathies, and Castiel looked too upset to even get a word out. He picked at his stew, only eating half.
They had to shuffle a little to get Castiel’s head back on the bed, and neither gave two shits that they were at an absurd angle to the mattress, Castiel’s face near where his feet used to be.
Dean nodded his understanding. “Then I have to call Charlie again. I think we can give her a few more parameters now and narrow in which bastard’s room we need to target.”
“People think half of Gatlinburg is haunted, and as I said, you never told me you were looking for a ghost,” Cas explained. But his eyes fell to the side and he look a little ashamed nonetheless. “Though that does seem like a more plausible reason for why the grave was moved. Maybe Gatlin has always been restless.”
“Hey!” Dean called out. He acted without thinking. He bent for the first thing he could find (a rock) and chucked it at the beast. The stone made contact, something that mildly surprised Dean, considering the world was still fuzzy with alcohol and made slightly blurry with rain. The beast jerked, paused, and dove straight for Dean.
The first thing Dean was consciously aware of was the sound of Sam tapping on his keyboard. He groaned and rolled over.
There had never been a flash of light, never been the supernova of a dying angel, but Dean could see it now. He could imagine the pierce of a blade, the high pitch screech of grace burning away. He could picture his wings in his mind.
“I'll make sure we get all the essentials, formula, diapers, wipes.” Sam mutters but doesn't look away from where the baby sat in Dean’s arms. He takes a breath and Deans knows he's going to hate whatever comes next; he braces himself. Sam was many things, smart, a hell of a lot more caring than Dean, but he always wanted to talk. He wanted to get everything out in the open and deal with it when Dean would like to do nothing more than curl up with a stiff drink. “Dean, the bodies…”
. To get his hand off him, to gain an ounce of control so he can physically drag it away. “Don't touch it and I’ll stop fighting.”
Dean cups Cas’s face, his eyes glued to the sky blue ones before him. He feels the warmth of his cheek and the scrape of stubble against his palm.
The road was calming, the sense of doing something, going somewhere. Idleness never appealed to Dean, not really.
They split up anyway, because that’s what they do. They put themselves at risk to save others. Dean wandering the basement curiously. He pulls and prods at the various bottles and tubs, and freezes when he hears the crinkle of plastic.
If he had talked about it before he wouldn't have been able to stop himself from admitting just how safe Cas made him feel.
“I’m not an idiot, Dean.” Cas hums and starts to run his fingers through Dean’s hair. “I read 74 parenting books.” Dean lets out a huff of air; not quite a laugh but close enough, if only because he knows that it will make Cas’s eyes light up. His fingers smooth back Dean’s hair before spiking it up again, repeating the process endlessly as Jack begins to settle. His eyes flutter shut, clenching and unclenching in Dean’s shirt and Cas’s sweats. “I think he just missed you.”
The image is missing something. A spill of color along black feathers, iridescent rings, blinding grace shining out from hundreds of eyes. He’s not human,
The mixtape had been a spur of the moment decision, a product of boredom more than anything. He hadn't made one in years, wanted to see if he still could. But when he finally dangled the final product in front of Cas, his blue eyes going wide, a smile spreading across his face, he couldn't help but be happy that he went through with the project.
of wanting something so desperately that, sometimes, it hurts to breathe around the ache in his chest and the want in his gut. Of losing him over and over and somehow never learning that he had to take his chance while he still could because who knew if they were going to be alive tomorrow.
“You’re okay.” Dean let’s Cas’s voice wash over him. Jack is still crying and Dean finally releases Cas’s hand in order to grab him. “It was just a dream.”
“Yeah, Cas it's me.” Cas lets out something eerily close to a sob, and Dean never wants to see him cry again. Once was enough, once made him feel like his heart was being torn out of his chest and he didn't know if he could survive it again.
Dean feels almost nauseous with it. He collapses next to Cas on his knees, gently turns him until he’s lying on his back, staring up at the neverending void above them. He’s never seen Cas look so dead, so tuned out from the world.
(Dean knows who he loves, even if he’ll never admit it. Admitting it would put them in danger. Admitting it would put himself on the line. Angels can’t feel love, not the way that humans do, not the way that Dean feels for him. Dean would rather live the rest of his life alone than put him at risk again.)
But not this time. He sits wide awake, eyes glued to the screen, Cas’s wrist never leaving his grip and Cas never pulling away.
It grounds something in Dean, a piece of him that had been set adrift without Cas to keep him steady.
He knows that if he closes his eyes all he’ll see is a portal closing with Cas still inside, a flash of white bright enough to blind him, a fire burning down everything he loves.
Just saying it brings to light feelings that should be connected to memories, but there is nothing. Nothing but the searing heat of a place that brings goosebumps to his skin. The warmth of being lifted from there, being enclosed in wings that shimmered and shifted when he touched them. Nothing but pain and anguish and happiness and a feeling he can’t name mixed together until it’s nearly indistinguishable.
It's all he can focus on, smiling at him, the light of the phone booth turning the rest of his face a deep purple. It could be mistaken for a bruise if you didn't look carefully enough.
“If you're gonna change him,” Dean nearly laughs as Cas whips around to face him. Now that Dean could take a closer look, his hair was wild. It stuck up every which way, like he had been running his hands through it constantly. “Wipe a cold wipe on his stomach and then wait a couple seconds before you take off his diaper.”
He doesn't get to ease into wakefulness today, instead he wakes up abruptly, Jack’s hand smacking him in the face. At the very least, he wasn't crying, just looking at Dean with narrowed golden eyes. Cas is sitting stiffy besides them, one hand on Jack’s back still.
It doesn’t surprise him when the blade lowers. Sam and him were always soft on each other. They could never see each other for the monster they were.
It isn't until Cas calls his name who knows how many times, that Dean is able to drag himself out of the spiral he had fallen into. Jack is crying, his eyes lighting up gold, his arms outstretched desperately towards Dean. Even through the numbness that had overtaken his mind and body, he still reaches out to take him.
“Get out of my kitchen.” Dean snaps, picking up the towel he had just placed down and chucking it at Sam’s face. Sam quickly scoops up his laptop, bending down to kiss Jack’s head again as he wanders out of the kitchen.
Instead, he watches Cas draw closer. Dean watches as he sets a hand on his shoulder, right over a faded handprint that had been aching for days, and only closes his eyes when he feels nothing. There’s no rush of warmth, nothing that makes him sigh in relief like it should. It’s just
“Oh yeah and Claire should be here in like two hours.” That makes Dean pause. He takes a moment to let Sam’s words sink in, wondering what exactly he forgot, before he runs out of the room chasing Sam down the hall with a shout.
The conversation with Sam still sits on the back of his mind. Like a scab he can’t help but pick at. An open wound, his nerves exposed.
Dean could still feel Sam's grip like a vice, but nothing matters besides blue eyes and a gravelly voice uttering his name like a prayer.
Cas keeps dying and Dean can’t do anything about it. What’s one man against a reaper, against an archangel, against leviathans and purgatory, against the devil himself.
“I know you.” Cas starts and Dean’s heart drops. “I’ve known you for 9 years and I know what you think you are. But you're
Hours later, as he struggles to put the crib together, Jack fast asleep in his playpen, he’s still biting back the longing that threatens to choke him.
It had been a day, less than 24 hours, since Dean had thought he would never see Cas again. He couldn't even go a
“I didn't think she cared that much.” Cas confesses, he clutches Jack a little bit tighter. “I’m nothing to her,” Cas pauses sucking in a deep breath. “I'm worse than nothing, I'm the thing that stole her entire life from her.”
“Nah, he’s only two months old. He won’t start actually doing things for another three or four months.” Dean lets Cas move in as Claire shifts forward, obviously done holding Jack for now, a soft smile still gracing her face. Cas slips his hand under Jack, careful to cradle his neck as he pulls him back into his arms. Claire still doesn’t move far, letting Jack grip her fingers gently.
grace. There’s no cooling presence, no warmth or familiarity. It’s the startlingly cold grace of a stranger, and it rebels against the tie that’s been keeping Dean sane. It sets his teeth on edge.
Cas listens to him with the sort of concentration that reminds Dean he’s a soldier and Dean chuckles gently.
But not with Cas. It was a comfort to hear his soft breathes, to know that they didn’t need to fill the silence. Just being with each other was more than enough.
Dean did his best when he was left alone with Sam, did everything he could to keep him content, happy, but he could never be quite what Sam needed him to be. He wasn't responsible enough with the money, didn’t buy the right groceries, could never help Sam with his homework after sixth grade, not when Sam was damn near smarter than him already.
The nearest baby store is nearly an hour away, but the drive seems to settle something in both him and Jack. It hurts Dean that Jack has already started to associate the impala with home and safety the same way Sam and him had. He deserves better; he deserves a real home.
“I can’t tell if you’re getting better at this or worse.” Dean lets out a sharp huff of air through his nose, almost sick with the realization that he was right. The confirmation was almost worse. Already they're used against each other, a weapon to make the other obey.
“You have the same eyes, you know. I don't know how considering he's not actually your dad.” He says as he gives Jack his first bottle of the day, ignoring how crazy he sounds talking to a 7 week old baby. “Though you have your mothers hair.” Dean pointedly ignores mentioning how similar that shade is to his own.
“Yeah, well, if we're going to play the blame game here I think I have you beat.” Dean replies, his hands clenching the edge of the countertop. “Who was the one who took the Mark of Cain? Who agreed to let Amara out in the first place? Who gave Lucifer a way to manipulate not only Sam, but you too? Who didn’t help you track down Lucifer? Who pushed you away instead of agreeing to help keep Kelly and Jack safe?” Dean’s voice grew slightly, his fingertips aching from how hard they were digging into the granite of the counter.
Jack, for what it’s worth, is completely ignoring them. He’s gumming at Cas’s tie in a way that means he’s gonna start crying if they don’t give him a bottle within five minutes.
Dean was so scared of falling into that pit of despair, that he never realized he was already there. The moment he admitted to himself that Cas was gone he had flown over the edge.
Sam very quickly collapses onto one of the beds leaving Dean at a loss. The playpen had been too big to pack, Dean had figured they’d be home before they would need one, and it felt cruel to make Jack sleep in his carrier when he had already been in it for so long.
Dean lets out a sound that is close to a squawk, slamming his hands down on the table. “Some old dude!” He repeatings. “
Instead, Sam walks over to the couch and sits at the end, nearly on top of Dean’s feet, and lets his head fall back.
Cas slides down until he’s face to face with Dean, careful not to wake up Jack. His hand has slid down as well, lacing with Dean’s own over Jack’s stomach.
He wonders why he isn’t here now, helping him. Maybe if he was able to call his name, he’d appear suddenly. But his name is gone, like everything else.
A secret said in the daylight is clear, concise. No room for excuses and arguments. Sunlight paints things in black and white. Light and shadow. Secrets are meant for the dark, the gray area of the night.
Jack lets out a content sigh and the wings become slightly more corporeal, enough so that one or two feathers are knocked loose in his grooming.
“Sam, I…” Dean starts but finds that he can't finish. There’s no excuse, nothing he can say to Sam that would make how he has been acting okay.
It doesn't take long before Jack starts to whimper quietly. His eyes screw shut and he waves his tiny fists around in a way that Dean is quickly learning means he's hungry.
He shows Dean exactly what he means by his words. Images racing by of the “plan” put in place by god. Cas was never meant to mark him. It wasn’t a price to pay to get him out of hell, it was nothing more than a moment of weakness. It was Cas’s first glimpse of freedom, the first order disobeyed.
Finally the epilogue! I’ve been writing this for weeks and it kept getting longer and longer so I decided to just make it into a series.
“No thanks, I think this is better birth control than all my sex ed classes combined.” But, she is already making her way closer to where Cas is shifting Jack from his shoulder into the cradle of his arms. Jack looks back at her, blinking slowly. At least he wasn't crying.
The very thing that made Cas an angel, the closest thing he has to a soul. Something unquestionably Cas’s.
Dean leaves Sam to unpack most of the stuff, he can hear him grumbling under his breath all the way out of the garage, and heads straight to his room. He’s pretty sure it's too late for Jack to be up still and he wasn't due for a bottle for another hour or so. Instead he pulls Jack out of the carrier and places him in the middle of the bed once more, throwing his bag and the diaper bag on the small table across the room.
But he smiles up at Cas as if he knows him, as if he remembers him from his time before he was born.
“Dean, your hand--” Sam starts but is quickly silenced by Deans glare. He didn't want to talk about this, he didn't want to have a chick flick moment where he and Sam cry and deal with their feelings. Dean just wants to be home, safe in the bunker, so he could drink himself to sleep and maybe not dream for once.
They had not been far from Castiel’s home. Dean has suspected as much, given the thickness of the mist. Still, Dean took the time to take stock. His party was fine, Sam looked like he’d seen a pack of wild demon ghosts, but was otherwise fine, and Dean was… far from fine. His chest literally hurt as he watched Castiel lead them back to his camp.
To his left, at the other side of the auditorium doors, a boy laughed. It pierced the fog of consciousness Castiel had erected around himself. There was no particular reason this laugh should cut through the fog, other than, perhaps, the fact that the owner of the voice was none other than Dean Winchester.
“Whoa, okay, that’s enough of that.” Dean interrupted forcefully, pulling away from Cas. As Cas’s hand slid away from his back, Dean reacted on instinct and took it into his own, lacing their fingers together. “I need a beer. You—” he pointed at Sam with his free hand “—need to stop talking about he who must not be named.”
Anna’s chin hit the floor. Or, it would have, but as she was sitting on a bed, it hit the mattress instead.
“I just know you, Dean.” Castiel picked up his mask. “Trying them on would only embarrass you if you enjoyed it.” He added a new dollop of glue. “You don’t need to be. I bet you looked great in them.” Dean made a choking, strangling sound, so he added. “But don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.”
Dean shrugged and chugged his fourth Busch. The other occupants at their round table all stared at him like he was a heathen. God, what did they want from him? He was wearing the button-down, short-sleeved striped top that Sam had insisted he buy for the trip, a pair of jeans without blood stains, and flip flops.
Castiel froze and took a deep breath before cursing under his breath. “I was worried something like that might happen,” he said. For some reason, it only pissed Dean off.
Dean groaned again. Five hours of sleep. Well it was more than his average, that was something. After a full night of manual labor though, he could have used a few more.
When he came back to reality, it was to find that he had actually bitten his lip bloody, and that Castiel had planted his feet flat and leveraged himself into thrusting completely into Dean’s pliant body from below. Chasing his own release, Castiel’s hands wandered with wild abandon over Dean’s skin, gripping him in a frenzied plea to find something he could ground himself in.
A blade was pressed to his throat. Another thing Dean was unfortunately an expert in recognizing. “We have company,” Gregors said.
Castiel sighed and flexed his hand again. “Disturbingly perfect,” he responded, before snorting. “Physically, anyway.”
The shower was perfect as it washed away the sweat of the previous day. He hadn’t even had time to change from when Cas dropped him off at his car to when he met up with Sam at breakfast. The steam bordered on too hot and too much, especially after the heat outside, but any discomfort from the heat of the water was quickly forgotten as he decided to take advantage of this private moment. Dean lightly took his cock in hand and teased himself into full hardness.
Cas leaned between Dean’s legs, the pressure at his hole easing as Cas moved forward. He pressed their lips together, sweet and almost chase.
“Cas,” Dean said, elbowing him and shocking him out of his realization. “They’re playing our song in there.”
The fangs retracted and the claws released his arm, so Dean did it again, hitting hard. On the third hit, it fell to the ground.
“Dean Winchester talked me out of a panic attack,” Castiel blurted out a little too loudly and a little too fast. Anna’s chin dropped. “He caught me freaking out, pulled me into the hallway on the backside of the gym, and put his hand on my shoulders. A lot. And made everything better.”
Both as naked as was humanly possible, Castiel crawled back over Dean, laying down gently onto him and he pressed their lips back together, drawing out little mewling sounds from Dean with his tongue. Sounds Dean had never heard himself make before Castiel.
“You are damn lucky Dean didn’t slug you,” Benny said, throwing a pillow at her head. “Or catch on to how much he was being picked on.”
“What? No, Crowley skipped ahead when he heard the war path you were forging,” Dean supplied. “Skipped right over the vows and the rings, the cowardly little shit,” He palmed the back of his neck. “The country bought it though.”
They stood for a few moments, catching their breath and watching the horizon, just in case a straggler showed up. Dean holstered his blade and turned to Cas.
“Well. Yeah,” Castiel said. “That was kind of the point. I wanted to show… certain people that it’s okay to put yourself out there.”
Cas snapped on what Dean had come to think as his dom face and stared down at Gabriel. If he had a thought bubble, it would read, “Come at me bro.” Gabriel sunk further into the chair.
They took turns, one manning the flashlight while the other dug. Digging up 6 feet of earth was no picnic and took a lot of time and backbreaking labor, so it helped to switch off when it was too dark to dig together. It was supposed to be split fifty-fifty, but Dean took a little extra of the burden off of Sam and tried to hide the fact that he was doing so by bitching that it was the other way around. He was pretty sure Sam saw through it, but that’s just how they worked.
Not that John had ever cared that much what kind of grades he got, but it was something he understood better than theater. Even if it was a blatant lie. Dean didn’t feel bad about it, lying was about the only way to navigate his dad on some topics.
“I am what you know as the Grace Archer,” Castiel told him. “I am…” he turned his head sharply to the side and corrected, “was, an angel. A cupid, to be precise. When I first fell to Earth, I used my skills with a bow to help those in need and earned myself a reputation.”
All Dean wanted to do was jump off his horse, run to Cas, and crush their lips together. Somehow, he held himself back. Besides, social visit? Just what the fuck did that mean? Surely he never expected Dean to come out here and, what, use him for a booty call?
Dean struggled to find the key he’d hidden in his boot, unlocked the door and headed for his room. The gold spandex was peeled off carefully, and Dean stared sadly at his dick, which gave a faint twitch when the fabric was coming off.
Dean crossed his arms. “No,” he said with a little head shake and expression that said exactly the opposite, and he knew it. Maybe Cas would buy it anyway.
“I swear to God,” Sam mumbled to himself. He fetched another bucket of water, and upended it over Kevin for a second time.
It eased some of the eye strain that tugged at his temples. He finished Vonnegut still cradled in Castiel’s limbs and, so content and happy, he drifted off to sleep.
His own heart hammered in his chest as he turned and strode out of the room to find Sam and Cas, and hopefully Dean.
There was one thing, however, that he completely failed to account for and that was that in the movie version, which they were both obviously familiar with, Maureen kisses Mark. Not that Castiel expected Dean to kiss him, but when that moment came, Dean’s movements definitely stuttered.
“How did you know I was an angel?” Castiel asked, carefully measuring his words. Next to him, Sam also tried to step closer, and also froze when the knife went deeper. Damn them, if they kept trying that, he was going to be the most slowly beheaded hunter in the history of mankind.
He licked his lips and attempted to regroup before answering. “I protect people,” he said, figuring the lie was close enough to the truth and sounded a whole heck of a lot better than their usual response of pest control.
“If only we'd taken the whole picnic with us,” Castiel said with a chuckle. “Help me up, we just need to get out of this place. My boat isn't far.”
“Sorry, Dean,” Castiel said eventually. He walked around the bed and resumed his place at Dean’s side. “Sometimes I forget that it’s okay to be me. Know what I mean?”
Castiel slid the salad to the edge of the table for the server to grab and asked, “Here with family then? Where’d he go?”
Well. For the first time in 9 years, he was going to put those lessons to the test in front of a real audience.
A lubricated finger brushed over his cheek and Dean yelped, too sensitive and raw, startled by the contact. He nodded. “A little,” he managed to get out. “To myself.”
Castiel hasn’t replied yet, but he licks his lips, and Dean considers that a good sign. He shifts forward on his knees, placing himself right at Castiel’s feet. When Castiel doesn’t stop him, Dean slides his hands up the back of his thighs, watches as Castiel swallows hard.
There was no time to waste on finding a better way down. He picked his way down the cliff as fast as he could, sliding some, scrapping his arms and legs on bramble and debris and caring for nothing but reaching Castiel.
“Mmm,” Castiel murmured, his lips pressed together, but humor danced behind his eyes. It made him look decades younger.
Dean searched Castiel's eyes for a moment, enjoying the way they seemed glow in the last rays of the setting sun before answering.
“Well my house is not an option,” Dean said. He caressed Castiel’s hand for a moment, letting the crowd dance around them. He pulled out his phone and checked the time. It was 11:30 pm. Good thing they’d told Dad they’d be home late. “I know where we can go.”
Cas lets a sharp breath through his nose and turns the full force of his glare onto Dean. Dean’s head is still spinning, trying to figure out how to get this back on track, how to make Cas see how important it is that they stop talking about this.
Dean has to stop walking to suck in a shuddering breath, his face turned into his own shoulder. He grips the edge of the table and refuses to look at Cas.
“If we talk about this,” Dean closes his eyes and starts swaying back and forth, trying to calm Jack in any way he can. “Once there are strings attached, I'm going to fuck this up.” He admits. Revealing that he had loved someone had never worked out for him. People die when the Winchesters love them. Look at Bobby, at Charlie, at Sam, at Dean himself. He would fuck this up one way or another, someone would get hurt. Probably Cas, in his experience.
Cas is looking at him in a way that makes Dean pause and suck in a breath. It was the same look he had given Dean in the kitchen last night as Dean taught him how to make a bottle for the first time. The same look he had given while Dean was making breakfast. The same look that he was giving Dean as Dean told him to
“You know a lot about kids.” Cas remarks and his eyes are even softer now, following Dean's motion and bending down to kiss Jack in the same spot. All at once, it’s like the breath is knocked out of Dean.
He turns away from Sam’s piercing gaze and stumbles back to where Jack lays in the playpen.  He’s not asleep anymore, just glancing up at Dean with far more intelligence than a five week old should possess. Dean picks him up with gentle hands, escapes to his room, closing the door with a resounding slam.
Jack wakes up to Tombstone’s main menu cycling on the scene, over and over, the same song the same images flashing across the screen. The credits had ended nearly ten minutes earlier, but getting up would mean letting go.
Dean nearly stops breathing, it feels like a fist was squeezing his heart. Every possible scenario flashes through his head at once. The angels showing up at the front door, whatever shitheads left at the British Men of Letters tracking them down, Jack screaming loud enough to bring down the whole bunker because Dean left his line of vision.
Two months he had been gone, and Dean had felt his absence every minute like a missing limb. A constant ache that nearly overwhelmed him. Now that he is here, a comfortable presence at Dean’s back, he needs to adjust again. Shake out the metaphorical pins and needles.
“How do you even want me here?” Cas’s voice is like ice. It chills Dean to the very core, it makes him freeze in his tracks, makes him realize just how mad Cas really was. “If I was you I’d want me
“Fuck you.” Dean spits without any real heat in his voice. He dives in for another kiss, deeper this time, choking back a moan as Cas slides his tongue past the seal of his lips, his hands cradling the sides of his face. Dean winds his hands around his waists, tucked underneath the trenchcoat, fingers digging into the material of the cheap suit. Cas finally pulls back with one last nip to his lower lip and Dean buries his face in Cas’s neck. “Also, I love you.”
“We need to stay calm from now on, this much stress isn't good for him.” Dean continues to nod, his face buried in Jack’s hair, humming Hey Jude quietly.
Even now that Cas was back, Dean had already fallen back into the same antagonistic behavior his father had when Mary was alive, and
However this time, Jack is laying in the middle of the bed, his stuffed moose next to him, as Cas walks slowly around the room, just taking it in. Dean can hear the notes of Ramble On floating around, and realizes with a start that Cas was playing his mixtape.
“If I were to leave again how would you feel.” Dean sucks in a strangled breath, imagining Cas walking away. It's all of his worst fears come true. Dean’s knees are weak and he has to lean against the table behind him. Jack is still screaming in his arms and Dean just doesn't
It isn't until the bottle is finished, placed in between them on the counter that Dean finds the courage to speak.
He pretends like things are alright, that his mother hadn't jumped headfirst into a portal with Satan, that Kelly was still alive in that house. That Cas was just knocked out, asleep on the grass.
“You left me with your kid.” Dean chokes out, and gently headbutts Cas. He pulls back, sliding his hands to either side of Cas’s neck. He looks him in the eye, meets his searching look head on. “I thought I told you never to pull a stunt like that the last time you got stabbed.” Cas pulls his best bitchface, but doesn't pull away. He just lets Dean cradle him like he was something fragile.
Everytime Sam tries to bring it up Dean shuts him down. He doesn't want to think about the ways he’s failed the two of them, the way he let his anger overtake him.
“We thought you were dead.” Sam’s voice echoes in the alleyway, breaking the tension between the two as Dean startles away. Both him and Cas look back towards the impala, Dean sucking is a sharp breath as he remembers Jack.
He bundles it up and lays it on the other side of Jack, opposite to his own pillow. He has to drag a hand down his face as Jack sleepily latches onto it, tiny hands clutching one of the lapels.
Why do they have to be the ones who lose everything? Why was it them that the world relies on again and
He can hear someone shushing someone else off to his left and he buries his face farther into his pillow before peaking open one eye.
Jack is almost five weeks old when Dean begins to slip. He knows that he hasn't been getting the amount of sleep he should be. Most parents aren’t meant to raise a kid alone, let alone a supernatural kid who refused to be on his own for more than five seconds at a time.
Every other universe, every other world, Cas listened, he deposited Dean back into his body and left. He followed his orders, never strayed from the plan. But not this Cas, not Dean’s Cas. He had chosen to leave a permanent mark, left a little bit of his grace with Dean and it changed the course of history.
Sam is struggling to calm Jack, who is crying so loud that he can physically feel the ground shake. He looks on the verge of tears himself as Dean walks in and Dean once again feels a wave of regret that nearly brings him to his knees.
It's a relief when they finally pull into the garage, even if it is well past 9 o’clock. Jack is actually quiet for once as they roll to a stop. He’s staring around curiously as Dean unclicks the carrier from the car, throwing his own bag and the diaper bag over the other arm, and once again Dean is struck by how odd that actually was. He wasn't even two days old yet.
“Yeah…” A strained chuckle slips out as Dean tries to focus on getting Jack dressed. He was starting to calm down now that he was semi-dressed, but Dean could see the goosebumps raised along his little arms.
Cas starts pacing the room anxiously, arms stiff at his side, hands clenching and unclenching along with Jack’s cries.
One finally talks to him as he's looking through the cribs, chest aching with something he doesn't even want to think about. Jack is awake in his carrier, peering up at Dean with a curious gaze that makes Dean lean down to brush his hair back. He's pretty sure contact was good for babies.
, his mind supplies, but the thought leaves his mind before he can voice it. It slips through his fingers and he feels frustrated for a beat.
It's no less than two hours later that they're forced to stop for the night. The Impala wasn't made to be a family car, Sam is obviously squished in the back and Jack is slowly becoming inconsolable even when they are driving. It doesn't help that they're was more baby stuff than what could fit in their trunk. Any available space was buried under diapers and cans of formula, making the already cramped space seem even smaller.
Dean doesn’t want to hurt Sam. Even like this, halfway to damnation, pushing the boulder up the hill just to have it roll back down, Dean doesn't know if he’d truly be able to hurt Sam.
eyes watching him all the while. The whimpering has stopped now that Dean has moved closer and Dean looks at the newborn, truly looks at him.
“Here,” Dean sounds like he gargled a handful of gravel. “Hand him over, I'm sorry I left while he was like this.” It's the most words Dean had said to Sam since before everything had happened.
“We have about an hour until he’ll be hungry again. We should probably do tummy time.” It's the first words that have been spoken since the kitchen, since Dean’s spiral and subsequent shutdown. It’s a peace offering, an attempt to get things even slightly back to normal.
“She wouldn't talk to anybody for a while after it happened. Locked herself in her room, wouldn't answer Sam, Donna, or my calls. Apparently she ran off a couple days later to go on a hunt and came back trying to pretend like nothing had changed.”
But Cas loved him. Cas was willing to give his life for him. So, a part of Dean cares about Jack too, even if he wants to hate him.
Jack seems content in his bath, up until the moment they pull him out, the cold air raising goosebumps along his skin. Dean tries to wrap him in the towel as quickly as possible, but it isn't quick enough.
“Am I driving or you?” Sam asks instead as Dean starts to buckle Jack back in. They’ll have to stop again in two hours, travelling with a baby was quickly turning this 24 hour trip into a 30 hour trip. But, they’re already halfway through their journey, and Dean really wanted to drive straight through.
“I imagine you’ll talk like him when you're older.” Dean states as Jack sleeps in his arms; he laughs at the thought of a toddler speaking in Cas’s deep baritone.
Dean doesn't know how long he’s been there when he finally pulls himself together, but Jack is still screaming somewhere down the hall and his face feels stiff with drying tears. His entire body aches as he pushes himself off the floor, but the pain is distant in his mind now.
Its stupid to be that vunerable. To give people the chance to use something so important to you against yourself.
Screaming does nothing. Anger and resentment do nothing to tempt Michael inward, just leaves faint traces of laughter throughout Dean’s mind. Michael finds enjoyment in Dean’s silly little human emotions and it never fails to drive him insane.
Dean gives Jack a look but finds him focusing instead on the sound of Sam’s voice, quizzically searching for the source. He has already eaten and has a dry diaper so he was just awake, content in Dean's arms.
Every night, he wakes up and wishes he didn’t, wishes he could just sleep forever. Every night he’s forced to face the fact that he's doing this alone when he shouldn't be. He misses Cas like a piece of him had been burned with him on that pyre. Like a piece of him is missing and he can't do anything to get it back because it's simply gone. Not just missing, but turned to ash and dust.
Laughter falls from Michael’s lips and he lets go of Dean’s arm with a lingering brush of his fingertips that sends an unbearable feeling skittering down his spine.
“No, Jack woke up a couple times, but I managed to take care of it.” Sam’s mouth falls open, slightly and he spins in his chair to look at Dean, who awkwardly shovels another forkful of eggs in his mouth.
It’s easier to just pretend that this is real. That Dean can have this, that everything is okay and his family is safe in the bunker. That he isn’t locked inside his mind, that his body isn’t killing hundreds of people, piloted by the most dangerous being on the planet
Dean shushes the baby, wrapping his tighter in the towel and leaning down to kiss his forehead, rubbing Jack’s arms through the towel in an attempt to warm him a little. It didn't do much to calm him, but then again, nothing would until he was dressed and warm.
Dean opens his eyes, vibrant green meeting shining golden. Sometimes he forgets that Jack is not completely human, that he’s something more than his newborn exterior shows.
Jack giggles though, like he can somehow understand what Dean is saying, and he’s nearly overcome with fondness for the baby in his arms.
“Yes, as long as he had both of us sufficiently close, he seemed fine.” Cas finishes zipping up Jack’s footsie pajamas, giving Dean an exasperated look. “We are going to have to teach him to sleep on his own eventually, Dean.” Dean looks away instead of replying.
“I just couldn't-” He cuts himself off. He curls closer to Cas and rests his hand on Jack’s stomach so he can feel the rise and fall of his breaths, the jackrabbit beat of his tiny heart. “You left me alone.” Dean won’t cry, he refused to, but that doesn't stop the lump in his throat and the hollowness in his chest.
Cas had seemed to take his request to heart. He doesn't talk about what happened, he lets Dean leave and come back as often as he needs, keeping the same cool demeanor he does even in the face of certain death.
It’s the hardest thing he’s ever had to do, wrap up Cas’s body in that stark white sheet. He works with gentle hands, ignoring how Sam has pointedly collapsed in the living room, leaving him to his work.
Jack was none of those things. Dean needs to make sure to cradle his head when he carries him, and burp him every single time he feeds him instead of just when he has gas. It's all a learning experience for him.
With a flash of golden light a shadowy wing shoots out and smacks into Dean, nearly knocking him over.
He places a pillow on one side of Jack, but finds himself searching the room when he realizes that he only has one pillow.
Something in Dean snaps and he quickly scoops Jack up. The baby startles just as Dean thought he would, arms flying out and more importantly, tiny shadowy wings extending and smacking into Dean's chest. It knocks the wind out of him.
Dean is lying on his stomach and Cas’s knee is tucked up close to his side, as if he was sitting criss-cross on his side of the bed.
Dean can see Sam’s growing frustration with the baby, he had never dealt with one besides Bobby John, and even then he had left most of it to Dean. Sam has never really had to take care of a baby this small before.
All of it to prevent this very thing from happening. To keep Dean from giving in to Michael, to keep Michael from destroying the world and it's happening anyway. Nine years later, and Chuck’s plan has finally come to fruition. An inevitable demise for the righteous man.
They're alone in the bunker for a week. A week of silence broken only by a baby babbling and Deans own inane chattering. A week of the pit of shame in Deans stomach threatening to swallow him whole.
Cas settles into the chair at the far side of the room and watches as Jack’s wings fade back into nothing as he begins nodding off.
Dean pulls the both of them to their feet and finally let’s Cas’s hand fall away from his shoulder, if only so he can intertwine their hands together between them.
“Yes, Sam. Okay.” Dean finishes throwing the dish towel off to the side. “As in okay, you and Claire can take care of this one.” Sam was still looking at him as if he had grown another head. “But…” Dean watches the expression nearly fall off his face before he continues. “We’re gonna go back there one of these days, or better yet we can go to Tombstone, visit the Grand Canyon while we're out there. Jack needs to learn some of the finer things in life early.”
Dean stands in front of the mirror. Green eyes and tan skin, hair that used to be blonde, probably still is in some lights. Freckles dotted across his nose.
Even Amara could sense it. When it had come down to it, it wasn't Amara’s name he called, it was Cas, it'll always be Cas. It was his anchor when he was lost without his memories. His last connection to Cas when he was dead and gone in the empty. It was so strong that Jack could feel it, that Jack knew he could trust them.
Cas hands Jack back to Dean while he shrugs on the trench coat and a deep part of Dean is soothed by the action. Dean nods with a smile and hands Jack back. His smile grows wider as Jack immediately scrunches his fingers into whatever parts of the trenchcoat he could reach.
“She went after Lucifer. He dragged them back through the portal, and it closed behind them.” He finally grounds out, stalling and starting again like an old car. He wants to snatch the bottle up, to run away from this conversation as fast as he could.
“It’s his grace,” Cas was still in awe, letting his fingers run through shadowy feathers again. It leaves a trail of light this time, a comet across pitch black skies. “It recognizes mine, from the time the two merged.”
Sam looks at him, and the pain in his eyes nearly stops Dean. Regret sits like a stone weight in his chest. Sam has lost everyone, he already takes the guilt of so many deaths onto himself, even when he had no control over it.
Dean lets his forehead rest against Cas’s and he tries to breath. He can't cry, he won't. If he starts now he knows he’ll never stop. The lump in his throat burns as he turns his face towards the stars.
Dean had known what the handprint was: a claim on his soul. A mark left over from hell, a toll paid so that he could live again. He never knew if it was left intentionally or not, though a part of him wished it was. A mark to tell the world that he was Cas’s, that Cas was his. It was a fun game of pretend that Dean would play, brushing his hands against it when he was lost or scared. As if it could bring him the comfort he needed, as if Cas could feel it too.
Regret and shame crawl to the forefront of his mind and with it, a sense of panic that has him struggling against his bounds. It’s a tug that starts at his shoulder and travels all the way through his chest and he wants to scream. Dean will do anything to make it stop.
Sam eagerly hands Jack over, his tiny hands clutching desperately at Dean's shirt once it's in reach. Sam’s eyes glance down at the trenchcoat, before darting away.
Dean sees his hands shake as he scoops Cas up, his head cradled between his shoulder and neck. He’s heavy. Cas had always been a lot of muscle, hidden under that tax accountant exterior, but he had never felt this heavy. His nose is cold where it brushes Dean’s neck. His blood soaks into Dean’s shirt, and he can’t feel it pull and tug at his skin as it grows tacky.
Dean finds he can’t finish that thought. Instead, he finishes dressing Jack and heads out of the bedroom to the kitchen. He needs something to do with his hands, some excuse to look away, to not have to stare Cas in the face and tell him that he failed
It’s relief as the pain in his shoulder, the ants under his skin finally begin to fade, a lost piece of grace so close to home.
Sam looks at him where he lays on the couch, Jack on his knees like always, babbling away at the stuffed moose in Dean’s hand.
Sam tucks him away in the back of the Impala like a child and laughter falls like poison from Dean’s mouth. He wants to say
They glow an unnatural gold in the dark room, like a beacon that draws you in, unnaturally intelligent already. They're not the eyes of a human baby, but Dean already knew it wouldn't be human.
Something catches in Dean’s throat when they turn the corner and a figure comes into view. He’s in a suit, the black material shimmering in the blue light of the photobooth. His trench coat is still tucked away on the couch, abandoned in their haste.
“You can also put the burping rag over your shoulder and do it that way, especially if you want to walk around.” Cas nods along and watches intently as Dean gently pats Jack’s back.
“You think I’m going on another hunt.” Sam sounds incredulous, eyes narrowed in a way that Dean knew means trouble.
When Dean turns back around Cas is still sitting on the bed, fully dressed, and looking at him with an expression that could only be described as fond. It just makes Dean blush harder. God, what was he? Some teenage girl.
It had been two weeks since his breakdown in the nursery and it still aches when he thinks about it. Like poking a bruise.
The two of them can be wrong, they can do bad things, but they’ll never be monsters in each other's eyes. Just misguided, lost, doing the wrong thing for the right reason.
“You know what I wish?” Dean spits, spinning on his heel to glare at Sam who stumbles to a stop. “I wish none of this shit had fucking happened. I wish we hadn't let lucifer out of that fucking cage. I wish the fucker could have kept it in his pants. I wish I didn't have to take care of a kid that's not mine, that I don't even want. I wish you would leave me the fuck alone and let me deal with it.”
Being this close to Cas is pain and it’s beauty and it’s want curling in his gut. Especially as Cas pulls impossibly closer until Dean can feel the dig of his buttons into his back. It’s like flying too close to the sun, but still needing to press closer, knowing that you’ll fall and soaring anyway.
Sometimes, Dean thinks he’s already dead. Roaming a never ending cycle of memories, but then the blackness never fails to engulf him. He’s set adrift at times, nothing to hold him down, just darkness as far as the eye can see. Voices echo, bouncing off of nothing, spiraling back to Dean, before he’s launched back into a memory, a nightmare, whatever pleases Michael at the time.
Dean’s entire world has changed in one moment. Cas isn’t here. Mary isn't here. Crowley isn’t here. Half of their little family taken out at once, some of them not even leaving a body, no proof that they were even here at all. And all of it for the boy who sits next to him.
Dean has always prided himself on his ability to steer a conversation the way he wanted to go, avoid topics he couldn't talk about, turn the situation on his head so he wouldn't be vulnerable. He needed to be this way growing up. He needed to keep Sammy safe, he needed to keep his dad content, he needed to be a strong face in the light of all the shit he’s had to go through.
It didn't happen a lot of the time, especially in the beginning. Every time he closed his eyes he would be overtaken by the sight of wings burned into the ground, and blue eyes devoid of the life that made them so special. He would begin to fall asleep only to jolt awake, unsure if it was truly a nightmare or the fear of one.
Cas nods, blue eyes scanning Dean’s face with the same squinty eyed looks that he uses when Dean says something particularly confusing. He finally let’s go of Dean's wrist, scooping up the dirty bottle before he could grab it and escape the conversation.
The memories aren’t enough, they’re nothing compared to the solid presence of Sam and Cas and Jack and the rest of his family. The memories are nothing more than a consolation prize, meant to tide Dean over until Michael’s plan is said and done.
Dean looks back at Sam as he hangs up, throwing his phone onto the table and turning back to grabbing books.
He latches onto that longing as if it’ll save him, like it’ll make the thoughts stay put for just a moment so he can actually
He ignores Sam, marching to his room. For a moment he wishes that he could leave, run away from the bunker for a couple days. He can’t stand being stuck here.
Cas still isn't moving, his attention solely on Dean now. Dean hasn't looked away, can't bring himself to. If he looks away Cas will vanish in a flutter of wings or a burst of light. Or Dean will wake up alone in the bunker, in his bed with no one but Jack for company.
“You’re nothing but a cheap imitation.” Dean throws back, as he lunges around the table, away from the thing that looks like Cas. It’s true. This is nothing but a mirror image of Cas, almost right, but not perfect.
Dean turns around and comes face to face with Cas, close enough that he instinctively grabs his hip to steady himself, fingers brushing along worn fabric.
“You're in a good mood this morning.” Sam remarks as Dean sets his plate on the table. He tugs it closer, not even looking away from his computer Dean notices with a grumble. “Finally manage to get the kid to sleep through the night?” Dean doesn't get a chance to answer before Cas cuts in.
Sam just nods, his face serious enough that Dean knows he doesn't have to finish, and turns to continue up the steps and out the front door.
“You asked me why I was saying this now, it's because, when I see you with Jack I see everything I’ve known finally out in the open.” Dean starts to shake his head but Cas continues anyway. “You’re caring. You’re kind. You love so much that it’s almost painful to see-”
He had known this going in, the moment he had said yes to Michael, that this was his eventual fate. He made a deal, but he never expected the archangel to actually stick with it.
Dean has been naked in front of a lot of people, slept around more times than he cared to keep track of, he even pantsed himself to get out of trouble once, the whole nine yards. It wasn't even that Cas was a guy because that was something he had (mostly) gotten over years ago.
He rode hard and fast until he knew Impala couldn't take any more. He hunted while she rested, and rode more. Dean's days became a blur of riding and hunting, living off the land and his wits until he could think properly again.
Oh fuck. It was so hot. Dean couldn’t take it anymore. He took his own cock out and gave it a few strokes.
Dean rode in Castiel's car. The Roadhouse was technically closer to home, and thus it would have made more sense to drive separately, but when Dean got a glance at the 65' mustang he was driving, he couldn't resist a ride.
“Really?” Dean asked, surprised. He shared a look with Sam, and knew instantly that he wasn’t the only one getting a funny feeling.
He got out of bed and went straight to Crowley's office. It was early morning, he would be up. Dean didn't even knock and wait to be invited in. He invited himself.
Dean, most fortunately, was also smart and quick witted, and once he caught on to the fact that he was being rescued, moved his arms through the grit and around Castiel's waist. This gave Castiel two free hands to work at the vine and pull them both out of the pit.
“Tell me, Dean,” Roberts continued now, his voice taking a dangerous tone, “You believed him dead, why? Did you go looking for him? Did it ever cross your mind that perhaps he was alive and waiting for you to rescue him?” He shook his head as Dean's anger went from a simmer to a boil. “Tell me, your highness, did you wait a day before becoming engaged to Crowley, or did you spare a whole week in deference to 'the dead'?”
“Why shouldn’t I? You can't touch me. I have Cas, we have each other, and nothing you could ever do could take that away, you slimy little prick. He's a thousand times better than you, stronger, smarter—”
“Are you fucking insane?” Dean asked. “I just got you back.” Castiel smiled at that, his eyes warm with relief and love. “Besides, he thinks you kidnapped me. He'll kill you.”
Pamela (or Ms. Barnes, as she allowed absolutely none of her students to call her) and Mrs. Moseley couldn’t have been more different. Mrs. Moseley looked like she belonged in a quaint little tea parlor, whereas Pamela seemed more suited to a biker bar. But they shared something in common—they were tough as nails and wouldn’t take shit from anyone.
“Cas,” Dean sighed. “I...” He what? He hadn't thought this through. Castiel would have thought this through. “I love you,” he said, laying it out there bluntly. “I just thought you should know. You probably hate me, but I love you.” Castiel stared at him with wide eyes. He didn't speak. “Tell me you love me, too?” Dean tried, one last time. But Castiel didn't reply.
Fortunately, even though the instructions were vague, Castiel could see the hand squeezes being passed around the circle. Kevin squeezed his, he squeezed Jo’s, and the circle continued until it got back to Victor.
With a growl, he wrenched his wrist free and grasped Dean by the back of the head, angling the kiss into something deeper.
After the plates were cleared and loaded in the dishwasher, Castiel opened the fridge and tossed Dean a can of Coke. He came out with one for himself and led the way back to his bedroom at the end of the hallway.
“She slaved for a year on his sword, and when he came to collect, he paid her a fraction of its worth,” Kevin continued. “When she demanded her fair pay before she would hand the sword over, he became angry, called her a silly woman, and stabbed her through the heart.” Kevin paused, taking a deep breath. “I needed to avenge my mother's death and requested a duel. I lost of course, I was only 11, and he left me this to remember him by.” Kevin motioned to the scars cutting across his cheeks.
Paul sighed. “I wasn’t being rude, I just—” He snapped his mouth shut with a glare from Kristin. “You do make a lovely couple.”
“I was so worried about what you would think, if you’d forgive me for keeping this from you, and you’re a
Sam let out a puff of air. “At least try to learn how to have a little fun that doesn't involve staking things.”
Castiel stepped out from behind a tree 50 yards away. His bow was in his hands, lowered but ready to be fired at a moment’s notice. His hair was as messy as ever and he had gone back to not wearing a top. He looked exactly like he had when Dean had encountered him three years ago.
“What… What am I going to do, Cas? I can’t face this. I’m going to end up like him,” Dean said, nodding to the body. “Fuck!” Dean exclaimed, running his hands into his hair, pulling sharply on the strands.
Dean frowned. He wasn’t sure that solved his problem. Human and mortal meant capable of dying, and he certainly didn’t like that any better than Castiel being some foreign creature to him.
The kitchen was blessedly dark and empty. Dean let their hands slide apart as he opened the fridge for a beer. He offered one to Cas, who shook his head.
“Please,” Castiel added. He sounded like it would physically pain him if Dean didn’t tell him where the mark came from. It was important to him, and Dean was starting to get that. Maybe it
“Those demons… there are very few people that could summon one,” Castiel explained. “And given that they found you out here, I suspect that personhas placed a mark on you.”
After the first pass, like he was proving to himself that he could do it, Castiel did it again without hesitation, and again, and again, until Dean was a whimpering mass.
“So you stole,” Castiel filled in. Dean nodded. “Why would your brother hate you for trying to do something nice for him?” Castiel asked.
Dean let out a bark of laughter. He looked back at Cas, evaluating him. He certainly looked like the exact same Cas he’d met days ago, certainly had the same powerful look of warmth and sexiness in his eyes.
“I can assure you that your body is more than ready for this. You were about ready to come on my fingers, as I recall.” Cas pecked a kiss to Dean’s right hand, still holding his legs apart. “But if we need to stop—”
Castiel lead Dean through the sliding glass doors and onto the balcony. The sun was nearing the horizon and already the sky was awash in shades of red and orange and pink. It was absolutely stunning.
He still didn’t look settled. Not even a little. His eyes were wide with fear and his breathing was sharper.
“Do you know how much longer, Cas?” Dean asked. They were getting higher up the mountain side and the air was getting thin. He paused and leaned against a tree. Sam was panting as well and leaned against his own bark coated support.
He pulled off of Dean quickly and sloppily, drool shining on his chin, which was actually pretty hot. He ran the back of his hand over his face to wipe off the spit as he stood up. Castiel unbuckled his own jeans and slid his boxers to the ground with them.
He worked his fingers into Castiel’s dark hair, holding his head, pulling him closer. Closer, closer, Castiel needed to be
Castiel stepped cautiously forward and stopped abruptly when Dean flinched. Gregors had pressed the knife deeper, and he was pretty sure that move had broken skin.
“I just mean, he’s been helpful so far. He might know something,” Sam explained. “He might know something he doesn’t know he knows.”
The man shouldered his bow and came to Dean’s side. Together, they got Dean on his feet, or rather, his good leg, and started to hobble north. Dean’s weight was almost entirely supported by the mysterious stranger, and since he had no tunic on, he could feel the warmth coming through the man’s skin. It was unnaturally warm, but somehow soothing nonetheless.
The drive to his mom’s house was tense with a quietness to the air that felt force. Cas had tried to ask him more about his family, but Dean couldn’t seem to summon up speech patterns. He was too busy trying to get the image of debauching Cas right there in his car out of his head to speak much.
Dean went fast after that, matching Castiel's needy little thrusts with bobs and swirls of his tongue. He'd never gotten to do this before, but thanks to the sleazy bars he'd frequented for gossip about the Dread Pirate Roberts, he'd heard about what worked. Sure, there was room for improvement, but he was relieved Castiel was enjoying it so much, and even more relieved
They were evenly matched now. Kevin's passion against the Man in Black's knowledge. Of course, Kevin had knowledge as well, and a glimpse of the man's eyes revealed more passion than the man had been letting on. Kevin was not at all certain how this would go, not now that the man was bouncing around the terrain like a man used to balancing in more precarious situations. His skill was incredible and went well beyond just swordplay.
To top it off, he’d had to ask her for help getting into everything. It should have been incredibly embarrassing, but that was kind of the whole point of all of this. To put himself out there, fuck what anyone else said.
Cause if Dean Winchester was doing stage crew, Castiel was damn well at least trying out for the cast. Maybe he wouldn’t be too horrible and they’d give him a part with one line or something. And he could hyperventilate 18 times a day for the next two months.
“Yes, sir,” Castiel replied, a faint blush on his cheeks. He knew he'd embarrassed his caregiver and provider and was horrified to think he let him down.
They snuck out the back door and scuffled down the back streets until the made it far away from the crime scene before they cut back to The Royal Road, winding through town. There were several merchants in this area, and Dean stopped buy some sausage for breakfast and bread to take on the road while Castiel checked out an armory. When they met back up, Dean nearly dropped the sausage.
Dean cries out as Cas finds his prostate with ease and presses into him mercilessly. Cas’s other hand slides between his legs and grips his dick hard. He jacks Dean rough and ragged, and Dean is gratefully there was still some lube on his dick from earlier.
Dean palmed the back of his neck and turned, pacing into the bedroom. He apparently didn’t know what to say either.
“Why is it so hard for you to believe I’m telling you the truth?” Dean asked. “I thought you’d be most thrilled, he’s
An orgasm ripped through his body so fast and suddenly that Dean gasped at the shock of it. His left hand found the shower wall to hold his weight up while his cock throbbed in his other hand, pushing out semen that fell to the shower floor and then spiraled down the drain with the now lukewarm water.
“I know,” Charlie replied. Dean thought she was hanging up when she spoke again. “Dean did you know male selkies are known for being really attractive to the ladies? Guess it works on men, too.”
But as the days began to trickle by and Castiel did not come to him, Dean began to worry. What had happened to him? Had Crowley done something to him after all? It wouldn't surprise him, but it made Dean withdrawn and moody nonetheless.
Dean swallowed. “It’s just…” Just what? That when it comes to dick, he’s still a chicken shit? The panic was quickly being replaced with embarrassment. His cheeks filled with warmth.
Dean groaned. Mingling. “I take it back, you can ask about Mark.” But Cas showed no mercy as he grabbed Dean’s hand and yanked him out of the kitchen.
“Yes, well, good for you,” Dean sneered. “You're still tied to a chair.” He looked to Cas, who was panting. “Dumbass,” Dean muttered fondly, coming to him to help him get into a more comfortable position. “I could have taken him.”
“Dude,” Sam said, “You attacked someone. You’re demolishing these rooms. You don’t have much of a high ground.”
“Say man and husband, say man and husband!” Crowley shouted again at the clergyman. He was rather pathetic, Dean thought.
“Whoa,” Dean said, putting a second hand on his other shoulder. Evidently Castiel’s face had warned him of the imminent puking. Or death. He still hadn’t ruled that out yet. “Not okay then. C’mon.”
Castiel tasted delicious. If ever there was confirmation that he was well and truly into dick, it would be in discovering how wonderful the heat and weight of a cock felt on his tongue. He didn’t even mind the slight taste of fluid, as Castiel began to leak precome.
Needless to say, Dean was a well fucked man by the next day, and the grin on his face felt permanent.
Through Castiel’s side-glance, for he dare not move to stare directly (that would be rude), he could just see Dean fish-lip his way into a response.
He looked to Charlie, and then to Kevin, but it appeared no one was about to cry wolf and start laughing at the good joke they’d all played on him. This was really happening.
Dean clenched the fist not holding his phone and willed himself not to scream. “We’re working on a history project.”
“Cas,” Dean said softly, pulling him closer. “I'm so sorry you ever had to be, that I didn't save you-”
They were at practice, trying out some costume pieces for the first time. It was still early but their costume department had already found some outfits and they were trying them on. Lighting was also present and trying out some light settings, which meant Sam was present. Which meant Dean…
“Dean Winchester,” Castiel says through his open office door. The deep, gravelly voice reverberates all the way to Dean’s desk and he shudders. He knows that tone. He is in deep, deep shit. “Come here.”
He was wounded. It hadn’t occurred to Dean that after the adventure at the Ogle’s household, Cas might have believed they had wrapped up the case and left town. Dean’s hand was out, grabbing Castiel’s bicep before he commanded it to. He opened his mouth to speak, but the words turned seamlessly into another staring competition that was only interrupted when Sam coughed.
Dean peeled himself off the back of the couch and turned to Cas. Then he had a better idea and put his hands at Castiel’s shoulders, guiding him until he was laying down. Holding himself above Castiel, he kissed him.
Those damn hands moved again, reaching down Dean thighs. Castiel raked his nails up Dean’s skin, moving inwards as he went, only to divert at the top, making a line up Dean’s chest.
Dean tried to pay more attention to the movie, but somehow he spent most of his time watching Castiel laugh.
Of course, there was a good possibility Sam was more perceptive that Dean gave him credit for, as when they approached the area where their motel was located, he requested to be dropped off.
The night was dark and the ground was damp, soaking in the humidity from the air. Though there had been plenty of ambient and moon brought light back in Sevierville, the surrounding trees blocked most of the natural light, and there wasn’t much artificial to be found.
Dean also bit his bottom lip before responding. His eyes flitted around the room, hesitated on Cas, before he confidently declared, “Dare.” It was the safest answer, and he may have been lying earlier, about not having anything to fear.
Castiel was clearly no less effected, breathing heavily as Dean nipped at his thumb, completely unaware that his burger was dripping grease onto the table.
When they passed the place they had stolen Nebula from, Castiel wrote a quick note that said, “thanks for the horse,” and placed enough coin to pay for two horses on top of the note on their doorstep. He shrugged at Dean and said he just couldn’t leave her.
Dean took off his cloak and spread it on some bails, and Castiel took off his, crawled next to Dean and spread it over them like a blanket. The hay wasn’t as comfy as a feather bed could be, and without heat, it was chilly.
Dean toed the body of the long haired brunette. They all seemed thoroughly dead, which was a relief. It would make their cover harder if all the bodies had the same final stab wound.
He watched as Sam ducked beneath a low branch up ahead. They’d have to walk the horses if the brush got too thick.
Castiel's mouth, like everything else about him, was sinful. He sucked as he glided up and down Dean's length, adding a twist with his hand and a flick of the tongue that was driving Dean insane. All of the blood in his body had to be in his dick by now.
He stopped and turned back to Dean one more time. He considered Dean carefully, his eyes sweeping over him, from his busted knee, to the pendant hanging at his chest, to his sandy hair, finally landing on his eyes. He stared long and hard into Dean’s eyes, and it was more than a little unsettling. Dean knew they were unusual, almost no one had green eyes and dark blonde hair, so he understood the look or two he’d get for it, but Castiel’s gaze was too piercing.
Dean nodded, not offended. If he’d seen Cas come home as upset as he undoubtedly had last Saturday, he’d probably never forgive the person that made him look that way.
After that, Sam stepped up his game, coming at the Man in Black with all he had. But the man was fast and slippery and Sam had yet to land a blow.
“I take it you don’t believe in the ghost stories?” Sam asked, wandering up to the counter, pretending to check out a set of wood carved switchblades.
It was slow going, but he was making it. Dean watched helplessly as his possible escape option, the boat, was sent adrift down the bay, growing ever smaller to his eyes.
The formal dinner was less crowded than dinner had been on the first night, so he was able to snag a table to himself and glare at anyone who dared to think they could sit with him.
“Teens,” Castiel supplied. “They’re fascinated with the area, come up here on dares.” He made a face. “Actually, they think it’s haunted.”
“No, you made me talk, now you get to listen. I don’t want to like Cas like that. I’m straight Sam, I swear to god.”
“Um,” Dean responded, trying to buy a second to evaluate which lie would work best. It depended on how certain the barkeep was that Dean had been the pickpocket, and he looked pretty certain. “Yeah, I feel really bad about that, I want to give him his money back, so if you know where–”
The sound of rushing air was the only precursor to an arrow flying overhead and a thump as it landed square in the chest of a demon bat thing. It screeched loudly, falling to the ground. The other two went down in quick succession.
He barked a laugh, but immediately became serious and distrustful yet again. “I’m keeping my eye on you,” he said. “Don’t you dare try anything with Jo Anna.”
“What kind of weapon?” Dean asked. Castiel didn’t answer. He looked at Dean like something was killing him inside, but he didn’t answer.
His entire body felt like it had absorbed the sun’s heat. He was burning and his heart was beating at a thousand miles a minute. Castiel tasted, it seemed quite literally, like heaven. A slim digit and paint covered hand was sliding up Dean’s thigh, and as it moved higher, so did a growing feeling of apprehension. Too new,
He looked at Sam and in tandem, they pitched the shovels over and started scrambling at the wood, pushing the remaining dirt off. They had just enough space to pull to the side and get the lid up before helping each other back out.
Dean moved to stand and needed Cas’s assistance to do so. “But it’s been awhile, so be gentle with me.”
“Yeah,” Sam agreed silently. “But I get why you did. I always wondered why you were so upset for so long after you returned, and then you just showed up with a bow for me…”
“I felt like such an idiot doing that,” Sam bemoaned, walking through the gate. “Don't make me do that again.”
Castiel shook his head. “Powers? No. But knowledge of herbs and enchantments, yes. That ointment I used yesterday was something I created. I’m pleased it worked.”
The stars were beautiful and Dean kept wishing Cas would wake up and come join him. His shift was almost over when his wish was fulfilled and Castiel sunk to the ground beside him. He put his head on Dean’s shoulder and was silent for a long moment.
Then Cas spoke, and Dean’s libido decided it wasn’t time to calm down after all, because ho boy did that man have one hell of a sex voice.
Kevin reached into his pocket and pulled out the matches that were indeed in the cloak's pocket. He scratched it across the box and within moments, the entire cloak was ablaze.
Castiel shook his head no and Dean’s smile faltered. “You’re not allowed release until I’m balls deep in your hole,” Castiel said, his face no longer showing a hint of insecurity or concern.
“God, Dean,” Castiel whimpered, dropping his face into his hands. “He looked awful. He could have been killed—”
Dean nodded, trying to drag his eyes away from the vehicle, and biting his lips to keep from making a wisecrack. Instead he spent the entire 6-minute drive telling lewd and improper jokes to himself and was not ready to compose himself when they pulled into Castiel’s driveway.
“I was thinking about everything, how that tree came down on you, how the grave site was cleared out, the candle stumps, and most importantly, how Radford Gatlin randomly came back from the dead to attack people, all people that had shopped at Castiel’s store.”
“Hey,” Dean said as Sam took his seat. “You finish that book you’ve been on about? Win at the slots?”
But, as he was well aware, the supernatural don’t see money. And they definitely don’t care if you’re boring or not.
“Sure there isn’t much marine biology in Kansas?” Dean joked for the third time. They were at the dock, disembarked and ready to head home. Dean wasn’t in a rush, and given that Sam was saying goodbye to the girl he’d been seeing, he didn’t seem to be in a rush either.
Sam offered his hand and Castiel shook it. “Nice to meet you, Sam,” Castiel said. “Dean’s told me about you. I’m sorry to say that until now my only mission was to make you want to give me the protective brother speech.”
As the cast got back into rehearsal and Dean returned to the set construction group, pondering what had just happened. He’d never asked for Cas to keep it between them, so that he did meant either Cas hadn’t wanted them to know either, or that he picked up on Dean’s wishes. Maybe his telepathy was working after all.
Kevin wasn’t quite as skilled, and the tall brunette woman spun to duck his dagger. Dean didn’t see what happened from there, hoping Charlie and Sam and Cas would have Kevin’s back.
Castiel exhaled next to him. “Dean, are you angry with me?” Castiel asked. “Should I leave? You don’t need me now, I could go back. But I… Well I probably shouldn’t say this, but I can’t…” He trailed off. “Can’t get over you,” he finally finished. He moved to stand but Dean cut him off with sharp grab of his hand.
Now that the anticipation was ten fold, Dean had a feeling that tomorrow was going to be a good day.
“We're looking for a man. Who wears a lot of black. Where can we find him?” Kevin asked. The Albino licked his lips and then pressed them shut.
Dean shook his head. “Not necessarily,” he said with a grimace. Sam’s eyes narrowed. “Cas remembered some stuff while I was with him. He’s an angel. He’s-“ Dean swallowed hard. “He’s the one who pulled me out.”
He went slow. Very slow. Dean got the impression that was just as much for himself as it was for Dean’s benefit.
Then Castiel’s cock slipped, rubbing in the crook between Dean’s balls and his thigh, and Dean gasped, breaking the kiss. He shifted, angling to let Castiel continue.
Kevin drew his sword and stood quickly, which, in his inebriated state, meant he fell two steps backward. Still, as the Brute approached, Kevin was able to effectively back him away with swipes of his steel. Him and the next two goons that came after him.
It seemed as if the sun rising was what chased off the mist, but Dean knew it was more about the distance. Somehow the mist was permanent around Castiel’s tent, and Dean was willing to just let that mystery go.
“I thought I’d get a small part in the background. I can’t have the lead. I won’t survive. I have to… I have to go find Ms. Moseley and tell her that I decline the part,” Castiel said, turning to go, intent to do that immediately, to get it over with, so that maybe next time he runs into the most beautiful man in the universe, he can seem just a bit less like a batshit crazy.
Castiel opened his mouth to reply, but Ash was waving his arm violently from the wing, trying to get Dean off the stage. Cas nodded instead, mouthing, “We’ll talk.”
“Right. Well, we can at least take care of Gatlin for you, now that we know who we’re up against,” Sam told her reassuringly. “We’ll let you get back to...” He trailed off and waved a hand at Daniel.
They were outside, walking the deck that overlooked the pool. Children were screaming as they rushed down the spiraling slide. Dean was really grateful Cas hadn't suggested the pool yet. Though perhaps the most prominent feature of a cruise ship, it held the least interest for him.
There was a sigh. “C’mon Dean, don’t do this to me. You’re on roaming in international waters, remember? If you need to go freak out, hang up first.”
“Saw that coming,” Charlie stated from atop her horse. It was midday and they were making good time. Dean suspected he’d make it to Castiel’s camp by the next day. Assuming he hadn’t moved, of course.
Then there was the part about carving souls in hell that he really could have done without the reminder of. Dean couldn’t remember being rescued, but he knows when it must have happened, because he doesn’t remember carving anyone up. But he sure as heaven remembers contemplating it. He didn’t think he could have taken one more day of being flayed before he would have agreed. One more day and Dean would have been the one ripping people apart.
Now that appraising eye was coming from the Duke himself. It was a long, uncomfortable pause while his eyes roamed over Dean.
“You can’t be serious, Cas. It’s 3 am. I’m going to bed. I don’t care if there’s a hoard of naked faeries in the woods. I need sleep.”
“What?!” She stood quickly and snatched the binoculars out of his hand. “Probably some local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at night... through eel infested waters.” She growled. “It matters not, we're almost to the Cliffs.”
Dean looked up at him with a squint, the angle highlighting the lines of his jaw and cheekbones. Cas tamped down on the feelings such beauty often stirred in him.
And as much as Dean hated to ruin what could have been a great evening, they needed to begin preparing for departure at first dawn.
“Garth,” Mrs. Mosley said harshly. Castiel’s eye contact with Dean broke. “Right over left.” He complied, fixing his arms with a sheepish grin.
“What?!” Chuck shouted, rubbing his shoulder. “I’m 17, what do you expect?” Chuck waited for everyone to calm down before choosing his next victim. “Charlie, truth or dare.” Charlie picked dare so fast, Chuck barely got the question out. “Go into the bathroom and take your panties off.”
“I, uh,” Kevin muttered. He dug in his pockets while Sam did the same. Together, they were able to scramble up a pile of change. “This?” Kevin asked more than declared, handing it out for her.
To his surprise, Dean did not look away, but held his gaze resolutely. It was like he was trying to tell Cas something, but he had no idea what that could be. Castiel raised his eyebrow in question, and Dean nodded gently.
There is a moment, when one is losing air, between when one loses consciousness and one loses his life. The Man in Black released his squeeze around the man's throat just in time for him to lose only the first, and not the later. The giant man fell to the ground unconscious, but still breathing.
“You’ve loved every musical they’ve ever done and nothing compelled you to try out before,” Anna pointed out. Her eyes narrowed in a way that was entirely too familiar. “Who is he?”
He put his face in his hands and ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. “You won’t believe me.”
Dean was silent for a moment, looking around the room. Of course Sam wasn’t putting a name on it, but Dean did have very intimate proof that not every rich person was a dick. “Yeah,” he agreed.
“I have no idea what I’m supposed to do next,” Castiel went on. “Where I’m supposed to go, what I’m supposed to do. I’m not even sure heaven wants me back, if it’s true, what Omiel said about-“
“Alright,” Kevin said, squaring his shoulders. “The truth is that I need him to help me avenge my mother's death.”
“I could not remove his mark, but I could, at least, replace it,” Castiel said. “Every last bit of me went into that,” he added gently. “I’m human now.”
For him, yes it was, Sam agreed. For Sam following Abaddon's orders, it was definitely not a good thing. But he'd get the man eventually, he was sure.
“Dean,” Cas says and his voice nearly breaks. With anger or grief or whatever mixture of emotions Cas was feeling at the moment, it didn't matter. “Don't lie to me, not now.”
“It must have been hard for you.” Cas’s voice is hushed, nearly lost in Jack’s fading whimpers. Knowing what he knows now, Dean figures Jack has been crying every night in response to his nightmares, pulling him out of them in any way that he can. “Even when Sam helped he must have woken you anyway.” Dean rolls onto his back, shifting Jack onto his chest, never letting go of Cas’s hand. He closes his eyes, scared of nonexistent flames spreading along the ceiling. He would never admit it but he needed the reassurance. Needs a reminder that Cas is still here and not burning up on a pyre next to a lake.
Cas’s mark is the purest part of Dean. It’s love and faith and everything he thought he could never be, never have. It was a tether between him and one of the only truly good things in his life.
Cas, for what it's worth, isn't looking at him like he’s crazy. He just has a soft look in his eye, a small quirk to his lips as he looks between Jack and Dean.
eyes that he's missed more than anything. Comparing them now, Jack’s are similar but nothing will capture Dean’s attention the way that Cas’s do.
Something in Dean’s brain shuts down, unable to process Cas’s words. It’s all too much, this day has been a rollercoaster of emotional turmoil, and this seems to be the final straw. Dean tries to form words, but what do you even say to that? How do you respond to someone saying you are a better person than god? An angel, fallen or not, putting to above their own creator?
It’s too close to what it would actually look like. Dean looks at the floor and half expects to see wings charred into the ground, to see his body still lying there.
The first couple of hours, Dean just putters around the bunker, Jack perched in his arms, putting away the various baby things they had taken from Cas’s house.
He looks up at Dean curiously, tilts his head to the side in a way that sends a wave of grief through Dean.
It’s a comfortable routine he has, a methodical process that doesn’t take much thought besides making sure he adds the right amount of scoops (one for every two ounces of water) and making sure the water doesn’t burn his skin(he tips the bottle onto the inside of his wrist). He’d done this since he was four, almost five, did it again with Bobby John for a couple days, has been doing it for the past two months.
