“This is what you wanted, isn’t it?” Sir asks, his voice rough and eyes fixed on the beautiful boy beneath him. “Someone touching your little, needy cock? You needed it so bad you couldn’t wait for permission? Good boys get to come, Dean. Were you a good boy?”
A few minutes later, there's a soft knock on the door and Cas sticks his head in, all haggard and giant bags under his eyes. His hair is all messed up, tie loose and buttons undone, and Dean just wants to kiss him.
That realization settles the last bit of turmoil in Dean's stomach, just confirming what he already knew. Cas was protection and safety and love and care.
Castiel nods, although on the inside he’s thrilled at the prospect of watching his boy struggle. Dean started out feisty. Always fighting, and it just made the moment when he finally broke into Cas’s sweet boy so much sweeter.
Once Dean returns, Cas wipes him down and screws it back in, pushing Dean down to kneel and eat breakfast. Cas places a plate down in front of him, and he sighs again, bending over to do his best to eat.
Then Dean feels a tug, and Cas starts to pull the beads out.
“No,” Daddy says, his voice cold, gently teasing Dean’s cock. “How many do you have left?"
“Are you sure?” he asks.
“That was so good, baby,” Castiel whispers. “So good.”
It’s been a while since Castiel slept.
Dean nods, embarrassment flushing his cheeks.
"I'll be feeding you," Castiel says. "So you don't need to worry about that."
“Yes,” Castiel said. Dean asked a few more questions, tried to get Castiel to talk about it, but he couldn’t. What a fucking coward. Castiel didn’t even know why he did it. Why he keeps pushing Dean away, even though he’s the only thing he’s ever wanted. Because he’s scared? Because he doesn’t want Dean to get hurt? Because he doesn’t want to be rejected?
“Making trouble so soon, sweetheart?” Cas asks quietly.
“Cassie, everyone who knows you can see that there’s more to this relationship than just sex. Seriously, dude. Take a hint. “
Dean swallows, a flicker of fear in his eye. “Yes, Master,” he says, and Castiel hates it. “Sorry.”
“Come on, sweet boy,” Cas says, taking Dean’s hand. “I’ve got you."
Pulling the waistband of his sweats down, Cas takes out his dick. Perfect, long and thick, smooth save for two throbbing veins and the pearl of precome at the tip. Almost mindlessly, Dean reaches out for it and gets a pop across his face. Stunned, he almost loses his balance, looking up at Cas with wide eyes.
“Dean,” Castiel says. “Are you telling me that you’ve never gone into subspace before?”
Edging. Orgasm denial.
Castiel has turned him into a cuddle monster, and they laze away together in the early hours of the day. It’s all slow, soft touches and chaste, sweet kisses, a gradual grumble and no real words until Cas has had at least one cup of coffee.
“I thought your shift didn’t finish until 6.” “
“Baby,” Castiel says in warning, hand on Dean’s balls. A flush crawls up Dean’s body, up his neck and coloring his cheeks and
“Where is he?” Castiel asks again.
Gently, Cas runs his fingers along Dean’s throat, bending down to whisper next to his ear.
When the last bell rings, Dean sighs in relief, shoving things haphazardly into his backpack. Once he picks up his notebook, he belatedly realizes that he had barely taken any notes all lesson, far too preoccupied with this stupid headache he can't shake.
Then he squeezed.
Stupid, Cas thinks. Stupid, stupid fucking idiot. God, Castiel Novak, what is your fucking problem?
Dean doesn't waste any time, so much pent up frustration and arousal from the last month that it barely takes any time at all before he finally comes, pulling in gasping lungfuls of air, coming down from his orgasm to Cas's sweet touches and hands running through his hair. Cas pulls his gag out, and the second Dean has any breath, he turns to Cas with an eyebrow raised.
“I’m glad you did, Dean,” Castiel says, and that smile is genuine. “Now, a discussion. Submission, while typically sexual in nature, under no circumstances requires any kind of intercourse. Intimacy, yes, but not necessarily sexual. That being said, you responded beautifully to what we did yesterday and I think you enjoyed it.”
“Pants, too,” Master says. “And then come here.”
A rush of heat fills Dean’s stomach and his breath hitches, and Cas’s smile turns wicked. Some days, Dean worries. He wonders why he likes this so much, why he’s so eager to be humiliated and feel so dirty and filthy. Sometimes he hates Cas for what he does. Takes him apart, so easily and so fully. Cas tells him he thinks too much. He tells him that it’s okay, kisses him and loves him.
As the stew slow cooks, Castiel pulls out his laptop and tries to get some work done, his thoughts straying to Dean every five seconds. Is the boy warm enough? Should Castiel wake him for some water? Because he’s bound to the bed, Castiel checks the baby monitor every five minutes, which he realizes is probably overkill.
“No, no,” Dean says. “Get- Get the fuck off of me, dude, you have no fucking right-“
“Cas, no, please-“
“Cas, come on-“
“You don’t come without permission. You speak only when spoken to. You have a safeword, and you can always, always safeword. If this gets to be too much, please use it. I promise I won’t be disappointed.”
Right as they finish dinner, Cas leans forward a bit to whisper in Dean’s ear.
anything. Dean hardly goes out, he just stays at home and does nothing, because he doesn't want to do anything else. He'll go out with Charlie and Benny when they force him, but other than that.
“Until I feel like letting you out,” Cas says, completely deadpan. “I won’t lie, pet. That’s not going to be often. Because this..."
Dean is sitting before he even processes his words.
“Your priorities are fucked, Castiel,” he had snarled. “You claim Dean is just a whore? That means you’re more concerned about a fucking slut than your work. Your entire life, Castiel. What the fuck is wrong with you?”
“Cas,” he whimpers. “Please.”
Get Castiel to give him Dean, double cross Castiel. Alastair would have Dean. They take his boy, then his empire, then his life.
quick note, their dynamic does contain some consensual nonconsent.
“Watch yourself,” Alpha says, his voice even and cold, even as heat curled in his stomach at the sight of his beautiful boy.
Cas spanks Dean, and he jumps, biting back a moan.
"Why is he so important to you?" he seethes, shoving the desk. "He's a fucking
“Not to touch,” he says finally. “Not to… don’t move my hands.”
again, it's clearly heading toward some noncon this chapter. check the tags, take care of yourself. there's nothing graphic and nothing actually happens.
He's aware of the fact that his grades have gone to shit, but he honestly can't do anything about it. He tries to study and it just doesn't work. He can't focus on anything, and when he does he hardly remembers what he read.
“For how long?” Dean can’t help but ask.
Most importantly, though, all of the subs he ended up taking on didn’t want to submit. It was more complicated than that, though. They wanted to, but felt like they shouldn’t, and some will fight and fight and fight, trying to get Castiel to break.
“But-“
“He’s a bit like Castiel,” Alastair muses. “Just, better. Smarter, more cunning. And absolutely ruthless. You think we’re mean? Michael would end you.”
“Please, Cas,” he whines. “It- I want to come, take it off.”
anyway, sorry for my tangent. sending all of you love and light and all of the happy things! you deserve them.
Dean whines apologetically as Cas’s hand speeds up, and he dares to hope that Sir might be feeling generous enough to give him what feels like is going to be the best orgasm he’s ever had.
Dean’s words are lost in his throat, distracted by his throbbing cock that only got worse when Castiel comes around.
Because he’s a coward. That sounds right.
“Fuck,” Dean gasps, lurching forward against the straps on his chest. “Stop, stop, please, I’m sorry.”
“Inside,” Cas says, and fuck. That’s his Dom voice. “I think we need to talk.”
“A bit of E-stim oughta give you enough incentive to behave, right, boy?” Alastair asks. “You get too close to that door, you’re gonna get shocked. Understand, whore?”
“What a good boy,” Cas says huskily. “Didn’t even gag, did you?” Pulling out completely, Dean tries to follow him, missing his cock almost as soon as it’s gone. A whine tears out of the back of Dean's throat. He starts to beg, but Cas silences him with a look.
“Well, subtlety was never your strong suit,” Dean says, flashing a cocky smirk at his boyfriend.
When Dean realizes what he wants, reluctance builds up in his chest, humiliation spiking in my gut, but neither of them miss Dean's cock getting impossibly harder.
Reaching around his head, Castiel pushes the gag into Dean’s mouth, following him as he tries to pull away from it.
, but I don't need to attend your stupid programs."
“Completely serious.” Cas cuts up a waffle while Dean adjusts, looking up at him in disbelief. Castiel’s men have watched as he beat a man bloody simply for disrespect. This wouldn’t be the most shocking thing they had seen this month. Week. Hell, probably day. Dean opens his mouth to protest more, but Cas pops a piece of waffle in there, effectively cutting him off. The sound Dean makes it almost as good as the one he makes in bed, and Castiel catches himself with the tiniest smile.
“On my-“ Dean stumbles, pushing against Cas’s hands, but Cas doesn’t budge. “My cock, please, spank my cock, Daddy?”
“I want you to beg,” Cas says. Dean nods rapidly, waits for him to take the gag out of his mouth, achingly aware of the drool dripping down his face. When Cas doesn’t make a move, Dean realizes that he wants him to try and talk around it, and he whines, struggling again. Cas slaps him.
It was worrisome. Part of Castiel wanted to push further, demand more from Dean, but he knew that would be far more detrimental to his health than helpful.
He’s taken countless subs under his care before, working hard to ensure their safety and wellbeing and overall health were as perfect as they could be before transferring their contracts to someone else.
“Dean?”
“Ah, ah,” Cas scolds. “No. Why didn’t you touch yourself?”
“Yes, Master.” “
“Please, Alpha,” he whimpers. “Please.”
“Next time, you’ll beg better, won’t you?” Castiel asks lowly. “You’ll try much, much harder to earn my permission, won’t you? Because you don’t get to come today. No matter how much I touch you, you don’t come.”
“You feel so good,” Castiel says, reaching around and stroking Dean’s cock, already drooling precome, slow and firm.
“You’ll stay with me,” Cas says. “In my home, as my own personal… assistant. And as long as you’re good for me, and as long as you listen, I won’t touch a hair on your brother’s head.”
“You think you can get it down without my help?” Cas asks.
The vibrator eases off some, and Dean sucks in a breath as Cas comes closer, cradling the side of his face with his hand. Dean leans into it, looking up at him with his best pleading eyes.
It’s almost physically painful, but Castiel leaves Dean in the bedroom and goes downstairs, frowning when he realizes it’s almost 2:00 and he didn’t feed Dean lunch.
Last night’s conversation comes rushing back. Sir had asked about his past, and Dean had almost told him.
“Fuck,” Dean swears, his hands instinctively reaching out to cover Cas's, trying to pull them off and get away from the pain. Cas tuts, his grip only tightening.
And, just to rub salt in the wound, Dean thinks Castiel sold him. Even if Castiel manages to get him back, it won’t be the same. His boy won’t trust him anymore.
“But-“ Dean struggles for words, trying to figure out a way to explain to Cas that he needs it on. He needs to feel something that tells him Cas still wants him, even if it’s for something like sex. Dean can be useful. He can be good.
“Where are you going to run, Dean?” Michael asks, his grin predatory. Michael is blocking Dean’s path to the door.
Cas sighs. If that’s how the sub is going to beg, with no respect and all demanding, then he loses the privilege of trying. Consequences and rewards. It’s how he operates. Clear rules and expectations.
Cas pulls noises out of Dean, high and whining and desperate, and Dean can feel Cas. He’s so big and hard and filling him so perfectly. Dean wriggles and squirms, trying to push back and meet Cas. Dean can feel Cas pulsing inside of me, getting ready to come but then he pulls out and Dean almost scream when he feels his come hitting my back. Groaning, Dean spits out the gag, panting.
After his guests arrive - only four or five people, there aren’t many that the alpha would trust with his Dean - Cas gets everyone’s attention to go over a few rules. They’ve all been watching greedily as he gets fucked on the machine, drooling around the gag and desperation in his eyes.
“I’m going to take your collar off,” Castiel says, and Dean’s eyes widen with panic.
“I can’t understand any of what you said,” Cas says lowly. “Do you want to repeat that?”
"I'm 24," Castiel responds easily.
“Two weeks,” Cas says. “The cage goes on when you get home. And yes, I’ll be teasing you the entire time.”
“Uh, yeah,” he says, a beat too late as Castiel starts his shitty little Prius. "So... What are we doing, exactly? And where are we going?"
Why did that make Dean so incredibly empty? He should be thrilled. He should be happy at the fact that Cas isn’t using him right now, because Castiel is mean. He hurts Dean.
Cas practically has to carry the omega downstairs, because his legs can’t properly support him anymore. His entire body is aching for a knot, and he says everything he can think of that might convince Cas to give it to him.
“I asked you to be good for me, boy,” he says. “And I’ve already had to punish you once. This makes twice. Don’t test me further or you won’t like the consequences.”
Turning back around, Cas is holding their soft white ropes in his left hand. Pushing Dean back into the chair, he takes Dean's legs and secures them up and around the chair arms, tied right behind the knee. When Dean looks at himself, a flush works its way up his neck when he sees how fucking exposed he is, cock, ball and hole all on display for Daddy.
“Nothing, Master,” he says. “I’m sorry.”
you. He hurt you. He almost- he would have raped you, Dean, if I was two minutes later."
“Please go through that list and mark down your hard limits,” he says as he walks toward the door of the office. “I’m taking you down tonight, Dean. No arguments.”
And it’s now 7,” Cas says, tapping his phone screen to show Dean the time. “And you’ve been working for too long."
He didn’t need to say it twice. All of a sudden, There were hands everywhere on Dean’s body, some people pinching his nipples and others spanking him. Someone takes the dildo insert out of his mouth, leaving just the ring gag and there are fingers in his mouth.
Slowly, Cas eases the gag out of his mouth, and wipes a bit of drool away from his cheek.
It was a nightmare.
“Why do you think?” Gabriel says. “To knock the kids out before he ships them off to whichever sadistic bastard bought them.”
“Turn it off,” Dean says. “Or- or take it off.”
“You will,” he says seriously, eyes shiny and determined. “I’m not going to let you go through any of this alone, I promise.”
“Master,” Dean whimpers. “Please, can I come? Master, please, it hurts, I want to come, I was good, I swear, please-“
"Yes, you fucking asshole," Dean gasps. "I think I've made it pretty clear how much I like that."
"Are you sexually active?" Castiel asks, powering up his computer.
“Yeah, because you’ve never found someone before who you actually like, dickhead,” Gabriel says. “Can we focus on work, please? We have a leak.”
He swallows his fear, nodding as he ducks into his seat. She goes back to teaching her lecture, but Dean can't focus, too nervous to hear what Ms. Milton is going to have to say. Dean only managed to make it in time for the last ten minutes of class, and it goes by way too quickly. Once everyone clears out of the classroom, Ms. Milton looks at Dean, and shame curls in his stomach.
He reaches over to the bed and shoves the gag back into Dean's mouth, without buckling it in. Cas pulls his fingers out and immediately replaces it with his cock, and it hurts. It hurts so good, and he’s hitting Dean's prostate almost perfectly, and it would be so good. The perfect mix of pain and pleasure and it would be so
Castiel sold him.
Dean moans as Cas plays gently with his nipples, softly teasing his cock with the other hand. Dean fights his tied wrists. His cock grows even more desperate, precome dripping off the tip as Cas teases him.
“What? Where is he? What did he say?” Castiel asks, pushing past the desk.
sorry this took so long (and that it's so short!) i had a busy couple of days. just a heads up, this chapter has a note on noncon in it. there's nothing graphic and nothing explicitly stated, but it's pretty clear that's where it's headed.
“Why do you care? You fucking sold him.”
Cas catches him on the way down, Dean holding on to him like he’s the only things tethering him back to reality, whispering filth into his ear.
Last time, it didn't.
But his boy was so panicked, and so terrified, and every instinct in Castiel screamed to fix it, and it all came pouring out. And now Gabriel, his second in command, has been trying to talk to him about schedules and weapons and lawyers, and Castiel can’t focus. All he’s thinking about is Dean, in the room next to them with Alastair, and how much he wishes it was him instead.
Gabriel has been trying to convince him to sleep, but with a steady stream of caffeine and enough determination, Castiel barely even felt tired.
"Dean?"
“Look at me.”
Cas follows his gaze, seeing the bulge through the soft sweatpants Dean had put on this morning.
He makes his way down the stairs, swallowing his humiliation and meeting his alpha in the kitchen, kneeling down and trying not to disturb his aching bladder.
“Please, Master,” Dean says. “I don’t know how.”
“Someone’s here to see you,” Benny says.
Sure, he had played around with a kinky partner a time or two before, but that was maybe a few spankings and a pair of panties, both of which he’d never admit to. Nothing compared to what he does with Cas, or what Cas does to Dean.
"I know how to shoot," Dean says with a scoff. "Since I was 10."
Now that it’s morning, Cas mulls over his agenda in the shower, thinking about what needs to do while Dean stayed fast asleep in bed. Before Cas had gotten up to shower, he had looped more rope through the ring on Dean’s collar and fastened him to the bed, getting frustratingly hard at the sight of the beautiful boy all trussed up and ready for him. After his shower, Cas pulls on his slacks, toweling off his neck as he exits the bathroom, seeing Dean struggling on the bed, lying with his arms still bound behind him.
"But you aren't a virgin?"
“Dean,” Castiel says. “Are you telling me that you’ve never gone into subspace before?”
Dean’s voice trails off when Alastair starts to move closer to him, stalking through the living room and getting way too close in Dean’s personal space. He could see the whites of his eyes and his yellowing, rotten teeth, and Dean wanted to throw up.
“No more work,” Cas says, kissing him. “Time to go home.”
Cas’s hands pause underneath Dean’s. There’s a stretch of quiet, and all Dean can hear is his rapid heartbeat, staring up at his Master with pleading eyes. Let me be yours, he hopes they say. I’m still yours. Don’t send me away.
“You’re the one who decided to break the rules. You have a week left."
As Dean is unloading the dryer, the front door opens. Looking over his shoulder nervously, Dean slinks out into the hallway.
It’s been years since he’s felt like this, since he's let a submissive affect him this badly.
Cas’s hand pauses halfway up his cock, and Dean wants to murder someone.
“You just made me sit in a room for an hour with a plug,” Dean says, hips bucking up to meet Cas’s hand.
"Mm, don't tempt me, Daddy," Dean says, kissing him again. It quickly devolves into a makeout session, Castiel dominating Dean's mouth. Dean almost laughs, whispering against Cas's lips.
The thought of Dean thinking - and believing - that Castiel would ever be capable of selling his boy burns. It burns in his chest, and his stomach, like a spreading wildfire that he doesn’t know how to put out. Dean is mine. He’s mine.
“Where were you thinking?” Dean asks, trying to help him out a little bit.
these two. i love them.
Dean's a little disbelieving when they pull up to the front of it, looking at this giant house with a giant yard on all four sides. There's a pool that Dean can see, and a beautiful garden on the other side that a gardener is working on.
“No,” Dean says, pulling on his binds and gasping, pushing back onto Castiel’s fingers. Spanking Dean once, Castiel starts to take his belt off, leaning down to whisper in Dean’s ear, hand teasing Dean’s exposed cock, fondling it gently.
When Castiel came in, all Dean could hear were Alastair’s words, and as much as Dean had resolved to not be needy and not give Cas more ammunition to use against him, he couldn’t deal with Castiel ignoring him and disposing of him. He couldn’t be just another whore to Castiel. Like he was an object. A toy.
“Mine."
“Please, Daddy,” Dean begs, so completely gone. “Feels so good, please, I need to come, let me come, I was good, I’ll be good-“
Dean swallows heavily, quickly averting his eyes. “I’m sorry, Alpha.”
Opening his eyes, he shields the next one, and then glares at his Alpha's amused face.
It’s not enough. Castiel needs to drop him further, but Dr. Novak knows that he can’t push Dean any further.
But Dean was a bit of a brat, so he fights. He pushes buttons, intentionally breaks rules, and Cas pushes back every single time.
Dean already knows Cas has been hard since the beginning of this whole thing, so he’s only a little surprised when he feels Cas start to press in, a low groan coming from his Master’s throat, the weight of his body laying over him.
like i said at the beginning of this fic, there’s a lot in here that may read as dubcon. although dean does need it and is grateful for it, your mental health and safety must come first. please check tags and take care of yourselves.
Cas finally takes the gag out of his mouth, a long line of drool connected to it. Then he moves behind Dean, spanking him once just to hear Dean yelp.
Cas pulls off with a pop. “Look at it,” Cas says. “So tiny, you. What is it, two inches? If I’m being generous?”
“You don’t need me?”
But it feels so good.
“No, Benny,” Castiel says. “Sam, what are you talking about?”
Alastair hates Castiel Novak.
He almost cries when Cas pulls off, sitting back on his knees, his eyes roaming all over Dean. Staring straight into his goddamn soul, like the asshole he is.
“Yeah. Yes, please.”
Then there’s a hand threading through his hair, and Dean gets thrown onto the floor.
“Fuck,” Dean cries out through the gag, thrashing in Cas’s arms. “Please, Alpha, please-“
“I only need to be there for two days,” he says. “And I figured you’d want to spend some time with Sam, so I was thinking we stay there for four days, and then head off to somewhere a little more private.”
“Of course,” Cas says, reaching down to grip his collar and pull him up to stand. “Hands.”
Dean bristles, but he doesn’t have time to respond to Castiel before he’s placing a packet of papers in front of Dean.
Cas sits at the table, gesturing for Dean to sit next to him.
“No labels, huh?” Dean asks curiously. Cas has tried to have that conversation before. The, ‘what are we?’ and ‘what am I to you?’ But Dean has never managed to get past exclusivity. Too much commitment, too many things that could go wrong.
“You’re doing so well, puppy,” he whispers. “So good for Alpha. Just a little longer.”
“Try again.”
"You look like shit," Dean says.
“Nothing, sweet boy,” Castiel says quietly. “Daddy’s just got some stuff to deal with, okay? You’re dismissed. Have some free time. I’ll play with you later.”
Dean can relax.
Clenching his jaw, Dean steels himself, refusing to answer. He struggles to his feet, a difficult task with his arms tied, and Cas reaches out to steady him, pulling at the soft ropes and untying Dean, letting him stretch his sore shoulders.
Dean wants to protest more, but then Alpha is kissing him. Dean melts into it.
Despite Cas’s carefully controlling nature, he cares deeply about the omega and loves him more than anything. Cas is traditional, and there were lots of things that Dean didn’t really like doing, but he liked making Cas happy.
"Can I see him?" Dean asks, trying to keep his voice steady.
Opening his eyes, the room comes into focus. It’s not his, or Cas’s. The bedroom is unfamiliar, the sheets scratchy and no windows. There isn’t even a dresser, just the bed. Dean’s sluggish brain tries to recall where he is, how he got here. Memories of Alastair and the stupid piece of pie come rushing back, overwhelming and painful.
“What do you want, boy?” he asks, his voice barely above a whisper.
Every synapse in Castiel’s brain fires at the exact same time.
Pulling him up by his bound wrists, Castiel puts him on his knees in front of him, a hand under his chin.
The door slams, and Dean looks up from his book, seeing that it's almost an hour early.
"Face it, Cassie," he says firmly. "He's not a whore. You care about him. He's probably the only thing you care about, and anyone with eyes can see it.”
And for a few minutes, he could pretend that there was more. That he could have more. He was pet, Cas's sweet boy. Cas was Master and Sir and Daddy. He wasn’t a slave.
“I’ll be good,” he says, desperately, trying so hard to speak clearly. “I’m so close, Daddy, please, I need-“
“Hm,” Cas says, his grip loosening. “Up, boy.”
"It was okay," she says, going back to the soup. "One of my students threw up in the middle of our reading, though. It was an entire ordeal."
And for some reason, it’s not terrifying. It’s freeing.
"Sir?" Dean asks, eyes bleary and voice still rough with sleep. "Uh, what-"
In the morning, Castiel is weirdly affectionate.
“Wait, Master, please,” Dean begs, his hands covering Castiel’s. “Why- What-“
again, so sorry for the disorganization. if i write another longer story, i'll put more time and thought into plot, etc. hope you're enjoying anyway :)
"You don't know anything about me."
“I’m hungry,” Cas says, and Dean blinks. “I think we need some breakfast. But first, I’ve got to do something about this.”
The soft words, the easy acceptance calms Dean down enough to nod and let Castiel finish asking questions.
He begs behind the gag, words barely discernible, shaking his head rapidly back and forth and pulling at all of his bonds.
Dean can almost feel the air in the room get a whole hell of a lot thicker. The tension in Castiel’s shoulders only grows, the worry in his eyes and reproach tearing Dean apart.
Gasping, he throws his head back, fighting against every urge in his body to move and get more.
“That’s one,” Castiel says, his grip loosening. “You keep count, understood?”
"Your absence affected me more than I would care to admit," Castiel says begrudgingly. "How are you feeling?"
But he doesn’t.
Swallowing hard, Dean grabs his stuff and drops it off in the bedroom, marveling at the house and so stunned he almost forgets Cas’s instructions.
Cas’s hand on Dean's cock, he pulls Dean up, who rushes and struggles to follow him, yelping in pain when he’s just a little too slow. Cas grabs Dean’s boxers from where they were thrown onto the floor.
Fairly nonplussed, Dean rolls over to watch Castiel talk to whoever it is called him, because his serious face is seriously sexy. One eyebrow raised, piercing eyes even more scary.
So, the boy is a bit of a brat. Nothing unexpected.
"You're going to ride me," Castiel says quietly. "And you don't slow down, and you don't come without permission."
Dean didn’t know which one would be worse. If he got the cage off, then he could come, but knowing Cas it wouldn’t be that simple. But if Cas just turned the machine off, it would take him a long time to get over how desperate he’s feeling. There wasn’t much Dean wouldn’t give for an orgasm at this point, after an hour on the stupid machine.
“That’s still a lot of people,” Castiel says. “You have to narrow it down further than that.”
He nods quickly, struggling behind the bonds, trying so hard to rub up into his hand. And right before, right before Dean gets there, Cas takes his hand away. His orgasm disappears, all the pleasure halted and his cock still so hard It hurt.
"I'm not going to tie you up," Castiel says, pulling Dean's pants down. "You're going to hold still for your spanking like a good boy, aren't you? Ten for swearing at Daddy."
“Please, Master,” Dean says. “May I- Can I keep it on?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The absolute, abject horror in Dean’s eyes may not have surprised him, but Castiel was almost disgusted at the pain he felt at the thought of being rejected by this boy, before he gathered his thoughts and collected himself. No weakness, Castiel. Show them no weakness.
He regrets the words when Cas turns around, and the look on his face is enough to back Dean into the corner. Literally and figuratively. Cas’s hand trails down the front of Dean's dress slacks, kissing his neck as he works them open, slowly dragging the zipper down.
“Didn’t what?”
“Ten,” Castiel says. “Dean, what is going on?” Dean struggles, trying to figure out what to say. In all honesty, Castiel isn’t doing anything wrong. He never alluded to more with Dean, or there being a more.
Almost falling over himself, Dean gets ready in record time, running past his Dad out the door, ignoring his growling stomach.
“Yes,” he whispers. “Please.”
Dean huffs, desperation practically rolling off of him in waves. Castiel sighs, then reaches out to squeeze the sub’s balls.
But it feels so good.
He's so beautiful.
Dean stays quiet as Cas struggles for his words. It’s not like he has trouble thinking of them. Dean’s nerdy… boyfriend? lover? Partner? None of those words seem to be enough to encompass what he feels for his weird, dorky professor.
"So soon?" Cas asks mockingly, pulling the rest of Dean's clothes off. "What a needy little slut you are. That's okay. Daddy will take care of you."
But he isn't. And Cas didn't know why, or how to explain it. Dean is Dean.
“Boy,” Cas says. “I thought I told you to be quiet.”
“I didn’t,” he says, as cold and detached as he can make it while trying to walk normally.
He just has to sleep. He only feels like shit because he hasn't slept well in weeks. If he takes a nap, then the screaming inside his head will go away.
So, needless to say, Dean rolled his eyes every time Cas ordered him back to bed but felt his heart swelling just a little bit. Sure, Cas is fucking annoying about healthy habits and y
Cas steps back, squeezing Dean’s wrists once in warning, and pulls Dean’s slacks and boxers off. Reaching out, Cas takes his tie and pulls him closer, kissing Dean within an inch of his life. Once the shirt is off, he gathers Daen’s wrists, the boy still distracted by Cas’s mouth. When Cas pulls back and Dean tries to follow him, Dean realizes his wrists are bound and he looks to Cas with betrayal in his eyes.
Dean doesn’t think he’s ever hated himself more.
"Just-" Dean waves his hand around. "Okay, if you don't let him in here, I'm gonna get out of bed and go find him myself."
“Nothing, nothing, I swear!”
“Be good for me, puppy,” he whispers into Dean’s lips. “And I’ll make it good for you.”
“No.”
“Open.”
“Do you have to go to the bathroom?”
“Stop being a brat, then. We aren’t changing the rules to say you only need four hours of sleep, sub. That’s ridiculous.”
Dean’s hips jerk, and Cas punishes him with another slap.
Panic bubbles in Dean's throat, and he tries his best to swallow it down.
Dean stops to take a breath, and then licks his lips.
They had countless conversations about proper Dominance, proper submission, and the goal of the dynamic as a whole.
Dean planned to only take a nap. A few hours, max. When he wakes up, he's relieved to see the sun hasn't even set yet.
if it weren't for the damn cage.
Dean nods, struggling to maintain eye contact.
“What the fuck did you do, slut?” Michael asks, walking up to him and grabbing his collar. “What did you fucking do?”
“No, Daddy, please-“
“Who did you call?”
“No more work,” Cas says, voice firm and unmoving. “You haven’t gotten up in twelve hours, Dean. You need to take a break.”
“It’s 3:13,” Cas repeats, and his voice makes ice run through Dean’s veins.
"Respect, Dean," he says firmly. "Thank me."
“Sam?” Castiel asks. “What’s going on?”
“I will,” Castiel says, having already gotten his holster and two of his favorite guns, nodding when Benny went to do the same. “I’ll get him back, Sam."
After pulling Dean’s pants the rest of the way off, Cas seats him in his lap facing outward, giving him easy access to his poor, throbbing cock.
Dean’s just a toy. One Cas plays with, has fun with, and then puts away.
“Stop,” Dean says, the words garbled around the gag. “St- Fuck off.”
“You’re so beautiful when you’re desperate,” Cas says. “So needy for me. You have no idea how hard it was for me to just sit there when all I wanted was to bend you over the table and fuck you.”
sorry this chapter is so short! i just wanted to get something out there since it's been a while. we'll get back to the fun stuff soon, promise.
"Thank you," he mutters. "I love you."
Closing his eyes, Dean tries to fall asleep, stuffing down the consistent feeling of
Dean is his.
It’s for Cas’s eyes only.
Things seemed pretty pointless. He sat there, glaring at nothing and the weight of the world on his shoulders.
"Man, if my secretary had seen-"
Reluctantly, Dean thrusts forward, and it feels so good that he loses all restraint, humping Cas's leg like a fucking dog, and he's fairly certain he hasn't been this aroused in a long time.
“Alright, then,” Castiel says. “You’re going to talk to me, sub, about everything. But not until you’re ready.”
thanks to everyone who stuck with me for this crazy ride!
“Don’t talk to the boss like that,” Benny says, his voice dangerous.
“What’s with the face?”
“Yeah?”
“You trust me, sweet boy?”
“Your previous Master has given me access to some really handy drugs, whore,” Alastair muses, gathering Dean’s arms behind his back. “Go ahead. Sleep.”
“Yes, Dean,” he says firmly. “You were so, so good, sweet boy. And Alpha’s going to take care of you.”
His puppy is too sweet, too beautiful.
Even if he tried, he didn’t think it would work. Sleep isn’t a necessity right now. The thing he needs, he doesn’t have anymore.
Dean nods awkwardly, knowing he's used the
Dean nods stiffly, unsure what the hell intake means.
"Uh," he says. "I can- I'll come back, sorry. I didn't know someone else was in here."
Today, though. Today, Castiel sped it up.
Castiel Novak doesn’t date. He doesn’t do emotions.
Before he can panic, Castiel leaves him alone, staring down at this stupid packet of papers that's somehow supposed to sum up the entirety of his submission. Swallowing heavily, he picks it up and looks it over. There's a table of contents and everything, all laid out in extreme detail, no room for confusion. It's written by Dr. Castiel Novak himself, a therapist for distressed subs. Of course, Dean thinks. It's just his luck that he ends up with the professional Dom who probably won't quit until Dean is squished under him thumb, more of a slave than a sub and exactly what Dean promised himself he'd never become.
Cas’s heart breaks a little more.
It's an unusual feeling, but most definitely not an unwelcome one. Usually, no matter how long he sleeps for, he still doesn't feel quite rested enough. Stretching out on the bed, Dean luxuriates in the soft sheets. The bed is so soft. Memory foam, Dean thinks. Cas even untied his arms at some point this morning. He's so comfortable he can almost forget about the cage and the collar.
Cas’s fingers are threading through Dean’s hair, and then yanking so hard that Dean’s entire upper body comes off of the bed.
As soon as the words leave his mouth, he regrets them. Fear sparks through him, and he pulls harder at the chains, trying to turn round and see Cas and whatever evil he’s planning. Cas’s hand threads through Dean’s hair and his heart leaps into his throat. There are a lot of things Dean hates about being Cas’s personal sex slave, and the way his life has been ever since he sold his soul in order to ensure his little brother got to keep his. He hates living in the gigantic mansion, he hates the bruises and the humiliation and the pain. He hates the constant chains and ropes and games the man loves to play, and how he always ends up hot and begging for it.
"We will find another way, Gabriel," Cas says. "Everyone wants something."
“Cas, you gotta lock it,” Dean says, trying not to moan. “They can’t- Someone might walk in.”
“Thank you, Daddy,” he manages. “Please, may I have another?”
Reaching out onto the bed, Cas hauls Dean up with the knot of the ropes, kissing him good morning and grabbing his still caged cock, leading him toward the restroom.
“Cas?” he mumbles.
and here we are; a bit of a smut break before we get back to the plot! this was honestly meant to be just some deancas smut, but then it evolved into a story, so i'm sorry if it's a little scattered. i didn't have anything concrete in mind until i was writing it.
Bad timing. Today was a very important meeting. They had a possible contact from Michael's side who was willing to share information on the leak in Castiel's hierarchy, but nothing they seemed to offer him swayed him. Gabriel had been trading emails with this guy for a week, and their tech expert, Charlie, couldn't seem to track him.
Dean barely even notices and the hands and tongues slowly leave him, one by one, until Cas is turning the machine off and pulling the dildo out.
Not that Dean knew it, but Cas saved him that day.
Dean sighs happily, turning in for more, as Cas’s hands explore his body. He’s already mapped every inch of it, with mouth and hands, and Dean basks in the feeling of utter reassurance and ownership.
“You’re so desperate, boy,” Cas says, right into Dean’s ear. “Desperate, needy little whore with such a desperate, needly little cock. Someone could walk in at any moment, and you’re still here. Hard and needy.”
The belt cracks against his ass, and he gasps.
“Daddy?” Dean asks, confused. “What are you gonna do to me?”
"No," he says. "I had sex with a girl. Another sub, uh, but haven't with a guy."
“Look, Novak,” Dean had said, his tone so full of ire. “He’s a kid. Kids make dumb mistakes. I’ll give you anything you want, just don’t hurt him. Leave him alone.” But there was a tremor to his voice, and fear behind his eyes. Dean looked ready to beg, and God, Cas wanted to let him. But his men were right there.
"Thank you," he says begrudgingly, refusing to make eye contact with him.
Rolling his eyes, Dean starts to take his shirt off, and all of a sudden Cas is behind him. Wrapping his arms around him, Cas starts to kiss up Dean's neck, and his breath catches as he struggles to keep unbuttoning and get the rest of his clothes off.
“What is it?” Cas prompts.
One thing Dean has learned about Castiel is that he is 100% not a morning person. Never has been, never will be.
“Please,” he begs again. “Master, please.” The machine pauses, the dildo rubbing right over Dean’s prostate, and he moans, the pleasure maddeningly frustrating and yet Dean still wants more. But Cas pulls it out, and Dean whines.
and that's all! hope you enjoyed. this honestly started as a smut piece, and i was writing with no ending in mind, so i hope it isn't underwhelming.
Dean falls asleep before Cas even has him in the bath, too far gone to wonder about what Cas meant about giving him up.
What a wishful thinker.
“I’m almost thirty, dude,” he says. “Can you leave me alone for five seconds? I’ll eat when I get home, but I have to work now.”
Castiel thinks, hating himself.
Dean was innocent. Castiel got greedy, and he got hurt.
Castiel sighs, but releases his chin.
And something, somewhere inside of Dean finally breaks down and crumbles, and he pushes towards Cas, wanting to give him everything.
"You okay, Daddy?" he asks, rolling his hips back to tease him. Castiel groans.
“What happened?”
“Yours,” he says, barely above a whisper.
Dean's eyes widen, but Cas walks around the desk, distracting Dean with the way his sleeves are all rolled up and showing off the Dom's arms.
"You told me you love me," Dean says. "Was that the truth?"
“No,” Dean snarls, turning to look at him the best he can. “You said how I wanted it. I want it like this.”
"Right," Dean says sarcastically. "Sammy, let me see him."
The room looks like a study. There are bookshelves absolutely stuffed, and Castiel sits at a desk amidst the mess, brow furrowed in concentration.
Cas would disagree. He sees all of this beauty in Dean, this purity and righteousness and kindness.
“Yes,” he had said immediately. “I’ll do whatever you want, Novak.”
"When you're gagged, you safeword through snapping your fingers," Castiel instructs him, opening a drawer on the side and picking up a penis gag long enough to fill his mouth but not his throat. "Twice for yellow, and rapid snaps for red. I will always listen to and respect your safewords, Dean. Use them."
Dean is respectful, or else he doesn’t get to come. He has to be good, or he doesn’t get rewarded. Castiel can’t let him get away with bad behavior.
"How old are you, exactly?" Dean asks.
“How are you doing?” he asks.
"Are you okay, sub?" she asks, a bit of her Dom edge slipping into the words. "You look like something's bothering you."
He skips over to the next page, which outlined a few scene ideas, all of which would leave the sub vulnerable and exposed and under the Dom's thumb.
“Um,” Dean stumbles over his words, too busy trying to figure out how to escape the room. “I’m sorry, Sir, but if Master didn’t tell me, then I’m not allowed to.”
“Watch your mouth,” Cas says firmly. “That’s five."
Cas stands back up, kissing Dean like a starving man. He was in complete control and making sure Dean knew it. Dean’s so blissed he barely notices Cas’s hand reaching into his suit jacket.
With that, Cas steps away again, pushing Dean’s head back onto the bench and disappearing behind him, Dean hears the snick of his belt, the cap of a bottle of lube, the soft whisper of Cas’s hand when he’s touching himself. Dean doesn’t know how much time passes, but it’s enough for the machine to change settings again, going faster and harder and deeper and for the cage to become almost painfully tight, the pleasure boiling in his stomach and the need building to a point where it’s almost unbearable.
“Please, sir,” Dean tries, hoping that Cas is feeling nice and maybe let him off the hook this time. Take the easier route. “Can I suck your cock?”
“Now. With you,” Dean says. “Please, Master, please.”
“Turn around, hands on the wall,” Castiel whispered into his ear. “How many?”
A sleepy whine comes out of his throat, and his Master chuckles.
That hadn't ended well. He'd much rather muscle through it than go through that bullshit again.
"Today, we're doing orgasm training," Cas says, his voice low. "To withhold until you get permission. And trust me, Dean, I don't give that easily. Your job is to sit there and accept what I'm giving you, sub. You better hold still."
“You’re just his whore, Dean.”
Dean’s too out of his mind with need to call Cas out on how fucking hypocritical that is.
Dean flushes, stuttering over his next words. “Cas and I- we aren’t-“
"What do you want to do about this, Cassie?" Gabriel asks.
He’s still so incredibly sensitive from the ruined orgasm that when the ice touches him, his entire body flinches and more tears run down his face.
“The most logical thing to do would to be let Michael have him,” Benny says slowly. “He’s probably trying to make some kind of deal, Castiel. And if you aren’t willing to give him anything back, it’ll screw him up.”
Castiel watches Dean.
The drive up is peaceful. Dean loves his family, but the house was loud. And crowded.
Dean refuses to answer, trying to break out of his grip.
"You said anything," Cas says quietly. "So, go on, boy. You may hump my leg."
He takes my hands and ties them behind the chair.
Heat coils in Dean’s stomach, and he looks desperately at Cas, the words on the tip of his tongue.
And yet, the screaming mess inside of his head was only getting quieter.
After Alastair, Dean was hurting. It wasn’t just his back, and his ass, because those were sore. Dean’s fairly certain Castiel tells them they aren’t allowed to leave permanent or long-term marks, because it never hurts for longer than a day or so, but Alastair had him for at least a few hours and he’s still in pain. But that wasn’t why he was hurting.
Blinking, Dean shakes his head. "Not so much anymore, no. It's been a while."
With no warning, Castiel reaches between them and slaps Dean once, without even looking away from the road. Jumping, Dean turns to him in shock.
“Yeah?” he asks, his voice almost mocking. “That much, pet?”
Castiel reaches out, his steady hand firm on Dean’s chin.
“Oh,” Cas breathes out. “Needy.”
"And I love you," Dean says. "And you know what two people who love each other do? They don't kick each other out. They work through crap and hold hands and all that shit. You didn't let me have that before, but I want it now."
"If you aren't going to give Dean to him, I will."
"Hi, Mom," he says, sitting at the table. "How was work?"
"Good boy. Inside."
“You know what I asked for?” Alastair asks. “You want to know who he gave me?
"I don't really want that," he says belatedly. "All the subby shit, I mean. I get by just fine on my own, really. I don't need all of that."
Dean’s preparing to say no, tell him the first one, but Cas shushes him.
“No.”
Dean knows that, and he still let Castiel in.
“Well, eight hours is an unrealistic expectation, if you ask me.”
Dean looks up to Alastair with confusion, a million questions coming to mind, but his legs are giving out.
His first instinct is to start begging. It's automatic, almost, the way he responds to this man. But Cas has been busy all week and frankly, Dean was feeling rather dejected.
Castiel reaches out to Dean’s wrists, but he yanks them away, and Castiel blinks in surprise.
whew. okay, sorry, we're going to ignore the fact that i was gone for forever. i'm still here, i was just having depression issues lol
He can't do this.
if i do another longer piece, the story part will be more prominent than the smut, lol, promise.
Shame curls in Dean’s gut, his cock fighting the stupid cage. He wants to be good, be useful for Cas. Cas shifts around, and takes out his cock. It’s a pretty perfect cock, in Dean’s opinion. Long but not too thick, a nice curve and smooth all the way, with a few throbbing veins interrupting it.
Sam Winchester had messed up, as teenagers do. Got into some messy business, messed around with the wrong people. One of Castiel’s youngest… employees, shall he say? Ruby, a girl who ended up betraying both Sam and Castiel and now Sam had some debts to pay off. With money the Winchesters - apparently - didn’t have.
The casual mention of such intimate things is completely startling to Dean, but he can already tell that Castiel doesn't beat around the bush. And if he's being forced to submit to this guy for the next two months, he supposes it doesn't matter. Castiel will see it all eventually anyway.
Cas takes a second to step back and just watch his puppy squirm, desperate omega arousal filling up the room. Castiel takes a few deep breaths, enjoying it as the doorbell rings.
Castiel pushes the gag back into his mouth, kissing his forehead before sitting back down. He edges him a few more times, his own arousal bubbling in his stomach, cock so hard it hurt.
"Better hurry, then. Come on, boy."
“Cas wouldn’t sell me,” Dean says firmly, trying to hold eye contact. “Especially not to you. He hated you.”
“Nobody fucks him, and if you use his mouth you do not come inside of him,” Castiel says, his tone meaning business. “You’re welcome to touch him wherever, and tease him. My puppy is beautiful when he’s desperate.”
,” he says, shaking his head rapidly, tears brimming.
When Dean looks up, Cas is walking back toward the door of the bathroom and Dean’s heart rate spikes when he realizes that Cas is just gonna leave him in here.
Castiel squats down in front of Dean, letting Dean feel his steady presence and locks eye contact with him, easing a dildo gag into his mouth. Dean bites into the silicone, looking desperately up at Cas, who reaches out and strokes Dean's cheek. Dean doesn't even realize he's leaning into his hand until Castiel's thumb is wiping away his tears.
"Having me in your life is doing nothing but hurting you, Dean," Castiel says, and he sounds more distraught than Dean has ever heard him.
“Hands behind your back.” Crossing his wrists almost mindlessly, Cas guides himself into Dean's mouth, pushing until he hits the back of his throat and just keeps going. His lack of gag reflex is one of Cas's favorite things to thoroughly exploit, cutting off his boy's air with pleasure.
"See something you like, boy?" Cas says, moving towards the bed. "Come."
Bitterly, Dean spits out a response before he can check himself.
“I will,” he says, still out of breath. “You have five days in there. At the end of it, I will."
“If that’s how you’re going to beg, you’re never going to get to come,” Cas says. “You can do better than that.”
Cas takes the gag out, and Dean looks up at him with desperate, needy eyes.
Cas kisses him again, following the blush on his neck all the way up to his lips when Cas feels a hand tugging on his pants. Cas slaps Dean's hand, and he yelps in surprise when Cas grabs his wrists, pinning them behind his back.
“There are a lot of things we need to discuss, Dean,” Cas says. “You have my sincerest apologies for entering a scene with you with no prior discussion. I hope you trust that I only did that because the situation was extremely dire. You needed a drop, and I still need to get you into subspace as soon as possible.”
"You may," his Daddy says. "But you come on my cock or not at all."
also, i'm considering taking requests for other works due to lack of creativity on my part, but would anyone be interested in them?
Moaning, Dean throws his head back, trying to push into the touch that’s so much better because it’s Sir.
“Hi, Dean.”
But Dean loved him. And he’d do anything for him.
"No," Sam says. "He's letting you go, Dean. For good, he promised."
Consensual non-consent. It’s in their contract. It’s what Dean asked him for through those papers. He wants to push, but he needs Castiel to push back.
The voice is muddled, unclear as if Dean was submerged completely underwater.
excuse on his mom one too many times. She passes him a bowl of the soup, and he can't eat more than a few bites without his stomach turning.
And they got to work.
Good pets don’t speak unless asked to, Cas had said. And if I want to hear you begging, I’ll ask.
“Well?” Cas asks, even though he already knows the answer.
“I was beginning to wonder if those drugs Castiel gave me had a bad effect on you,” he muses, walking closer to Dean. “It was simply supposed to knock you out for long enough to get you over here. I’ll show you Queens, Dean. Much better than Manhattan. Because I run it, not Castiel.”
"Please, Sir," he begs through the gag, brain scrambling to remember everything Castiel told him, follow every rule he's been given so far. "Please, I'll be good, I'm sorry I was bad, I wanna come,
Dean puts his head back down, trying to keep his sobs silent.
He hates himself more for crying in relief once he's back in Cas's arms.
“No,” Cas says. “This excites you, doesn’t it? The thought that someone might walk in and see you like this? See what a whore you are for me?”
Dean cringes, reality crashing down and him and dragging him out of the warmth of subspace, forgetting to hide his distaste and Cas looks down at him, his eyebrow raised.
The sight might have been arousing, if this was any other situation. It’s one of Castiel’s favorite things to do; take his boy apart until he’s desperate, and begging. He begs so beautifully, and gives so much. But Castiel didn’t do this to him. Despite his words earlier, because yes, this was for him, it still wasn’t him.
"Why would he do that?" Castiel muttered. "He's just my whore. Why would he take Dean?"
“No,” Dean says desperately, clutching onto Cas’s jacket. “Please, I want- I gotta-“
“What was that? You want me to get rid of that?” Cas asks, motioning to his dripping cock. "I can ice it down for you. Is that what you want?"
“No,” he says firmly. “School first.”
Dean is crying, heavy sobs making his chest heave as Castiel pulls his hands away, stopping Dean’s orgasm for the fourth- fifth? time.
Dean nods furiously, too distracted by the hand trailing down his chest.
“I won’t ask twice, boy.”
“I’ll give you two options,” Cas says, his fingers slowly trailing up Dean’s back. “One, I take the cage off. You can come whenever you want. But you sleep on the bench tonight, no breaks.”
The uncertainty in his voice breaks Castiel’s heart, and he pauses halfway towards the bathroom to kiss Dean gently.
“And miss the chance to see you all decorated and pretty for me?” Cas rumbles from over his shoulder. “I don’t think so, boy. Watch your tone.”
“I’m just kidding,” Alastair says, pulling backward and smiling cruelly, leaving Dean reeling.
“No.”
"Don't tell me how I feel about you, Castiel Novak," Dean warns. "I spent way too fucking long figuring that out. I know how I feel."
?" Dean says, motioning to the mansion in front of him, eyes widening when he can see even more employees - servants? - working on the grounds.
“You want to tell me what the attitude was about?” Cas asks, cutting up some more of his food. A flush runs up Dean’s cheeks. He knows exactly what Cas is talking about. There was a time Dean used to fight Cas, but those days are long gone, the fight trained out of him. For Dean to be as bratty as he was this morning, and how he’s been this past week, there was something up.
"Then what did he want?"
“Okay, baby,” Cas says, taking a few deep breaths to steady himself. “Let’s get you set up, hm?”
“Aren’t you going to thank me, toy?” Alastair asks smugly, his eyebrows raised, tone suggestive and hungry.
“Um.”
“That’s right,” Alastair says. “What a smart whore you are.”
"Whatever," Dean says. "I may not have wanted it before, but Cas, I'm not stupid. I want you. And not, like, just in a sex way. I also don't want any of that vanilla crap, you're way too good at BDSM and shit. You've ruined regular sex for me forever. We both want this. Why aren't you letting yourself?"
He knew Dean wouldn’t be able to ask for help, so he offered.
Dean nods rapidly, kissing Cas again, a whine building in the back of his throat.
“And what if I say no?” Dean asks, his voice wavering.
Castiel looks down at him, eyes dark and hooded.
Sam huffs, rolling his eyes. "Well, it's whatever. We can leave as soon as the doctor clears you."
Dean had swallowed.
Head in his hands, Gabriel nodded, seeming to try and calm himself down.
Alastair pushes the cage into Castiel’s hand. He wants to throw up at the words. Castiel shoots a glance toward Gabriel, who waves him off.
He whines again, shaking his head.
“Low sex drive?” Castiel asks, looking at Dean worriedly. “How long has that been going on?”
“No,” Cas says. “You’ll be my live-in whore, Dean. Sex. That kind of assistance.”
“Thank you, pet,” he says, removing his hand. “One more thing.”
When he turns, Alastair is right there, and his hand reaches out to grip Dean’s collar. Panicking, Dean tries to pull his hands away, but nothing is working right. His arms won’t listen to him
But then his men brought Sam and Dean Winchester into his office, and Castiel was so very screwed.
It's only 4:30, but Cas figures it's fine considering neither of them have eaten anything all day. Untying Dean from the headboard, he decides not to remove the ropes tying his hands together and walks him down the stairs, hand on his back to steady him.
After Dean hung up on Sam, he shared the location with trembling fingers and then searched desperately for a place to hide the phone.
Despite his flailing, Castiel is strong. Cuffs wrap around his wrists, and then Cas forces him into a hogtie.
Dean’s tears turn hysterical, and he pulls at the cuffs around his wrists connected to chains keeping his locked to the headboard, searching desperately for something that he can use to pick the lock.
"I forced you," Cas says, pained. "You're only here because your brother fucked up, I wanted you and I'm too fucked up to figure out how to date someone regularly."
Dean grits his teeth, his jaw clenched and turmoil still boiling in his eyes, but he obediently opens his mouth when Castiel offers him a forkful of beef stew. Whatever higher power there is, Cas thanks them for the small respite, because he doesn't think Dean's ass can take much more.
“Thank you,” Dean says belatedly, stepping around Alastair to get to the kitchen and get a fork. Alastair follows him, and Dean tries his best to move to the other side of the room, sitting down and eating the pie.
Looking around in his office, Dean whimpers again, eyes fixed firmly on the door.
He doesn't have much of a chance to say anything else, though, because Cas is yanking him up to stand up, hand on his collar.
Chewing on his lip, Dean reads the first section, entitled limits. Castiel listed too many kinks from A-Z, with checkboxes next to them rating his preferences. Some of this shit Dean hasn't even heard of.
“That can be arranged," Cas says, smile turning wicked.
Today had sucked. He ran into problem after problem after problem, and there were too many people asking him to do too many things. It was nice being your own boss, and being able to make all of the decisions, but it becomes exhausting. It was only just past three, and the day had already felt like an eternity.
“Hello, Dean,” he says. “Got a bit of a present for you. From Michael.”
Dean shifts in his seat, eyes flying down to his hands.
“You’re dismissed,” Castiel says. “We leave for the office in half an hour." The hurt in Dean’s eyes is painful, but Castiel ignores it, going back to eating his breakfast.
"Please," Dean says. "I can't-"
He moves out of Dean’s line of sight, and he turns as best as he can in the restraints to watch Cas as he walks toward the closet, distracted by the way his cock throbs in the cage.
thank you to everyone who has been commenting! i love reading them :) let me know if there's anything special you'd want to see.
“No, what?”
“Michael,” he says, the name all too familiar. Dean overheard enough to know who Michael is. “Your new master. Your former master’s rival, but he sold you to me in exchange for some… well. Amenities, but I won’t bore you with work talk.”
Cas likes working with subs. He likes watching their transformation, seeing them slowly get healthier, and then finding them a match in the system and knowing he played a hands-on part in healing.
“Okay, so maybe it’s more like twenty,” Dean admits, grumbling. Cas’s hands guide him to stick his ass out further, although all Dean wants is to pull the fuck away from the stupid belt.
Wiping his face, Dean gets off of the floor and makes his way into the closet to put on his uniform. Well. What Castiel makes him wear when Dean goes into work with him. They’re simple pants, with drawstrings and soft, soft material paired with a hoodie. That wasn’t part of the uniform, but Dean took off his shirt the second they got to the office, so Cas didn’t really care what he wore.
Dean lets Cas get him ready, not that he has much choice in the matter. He washes him gently, cleans his plugs and thoroughly enjoys frustrating Dean in the process. By the end of it, Dean is panting and whining through the gag, his beautiful, aroused scent filling the room. His tiny cock is throbbing in its cage, fighting to get out. Slick is running down his legs, and Castiel is taking his sweet time licking it all up.
Dean had fallen asleep after dropping, so Castiel took him out of the playroom and up into the Master, wiping him down and putting him to bed. Opening the side table, Castiel takes out some soft ropes and loosely ties Dean’s hands to the headboard. There’s enough give for him to still sleep comfortably, but it’s secure enough to give Dean an anchor.
The sharp pain makes Dean cry out, and Castiel’s icy blue eyes lock directly onto his. All of Dean’s words get caught in his throat, unable to respond to Cas’s display of power.
Except...
“Relax, sub,” Castiel says gently. “it’s just me. I'm not here to judge you. It’s okay if you don’t trust me yet, but I’m hoping that I’ll gain that eventually.”
He loves their play. He’s an Alpha, and he loves the careful control the omega allows him, and he would never want to change the way their dynamic works, but he wishes Dean knew that he would never disappoint Castiel. He couldn’t,
“Good boy,” Cas says, his voice barely above a whisper. Dean hears the click of a keyboard and Cas’s business voice for a few phone calls, and that included with the weight of his cock and the pull of the ropes lull him into a soft drift. Doesn’t have to worry about why he likes this, or why he needs Cas. Almost dozing, Dean finally relaxes knowing he’s being good for Cas. Is that all he’s ever going to be good for? And why doesn’t that bother him more? Dean doesn’t know how long he’s kneeling there, doing nothing but serving his master, but it’s been altogether too short a period of time when he feels Cas start to pull out.
This is vulnerable.
“Please,” Dean says, gasping. “It’s been so long, I-“
“Shh,” Michael said, but it’s the opposite of soothing. “I bought a toy, I’m going to play with it.”
“That wasn’t subspace?” Dean asks, surprised.
A burn of humiliation curls through Dean’s stomach, as he looks down at his absolutely crushed cock and he groans, hands grasping the counter behind him.
“Can I-“ Dean says, struggling to keep his breathing even. “Are you gonna let me come, Sir?”
,” Dean says snidely, trying his best to turn around and look to where he knows Cas is watching. “I don’t know why you use so many chains when there are perfectly good cuffs they provide for you. On the bench.”
“Of course,” Castiel says. “I’m all yours.”
Stepping into the room, Castiel locks the door behind him, gently pulling out the still vibrating plug Alastair left inside of Dean, who lets out a broken whine once it’s finally out. Castiel breathes a sigh of relief when he realizes there’s no come inside of Dean’s hole.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel says quietly, his hand on Dean’s back, quickly looking over him, distracted by the sticky, drying come all over his boy’s back. He sees the ring gag still stretching Dean’s jaw way too wide, and winces.
“Shit, Master, please-“
“That’s staying on for tonight,” he says. “Be good and I’ll let you come this weekend. “
Castiel opens the bottom drawer for a bottle of lube, pushing two fingers into his already loosened hole.
The room was so incredibly bare of furniture and any other personalized objects that it was virtually impossible for him to conceal it. Dean eventually settled for shoving it into one of the pillows, in the middle of the stuffing.
Dean looks up, hands hovering over his book, unsure if Cas is waiting for something, or if he’s going to talk, or if Dean is supposed to say something first.
"Or Master," Castiel shrugs. "Or Daddy. Whatever makes you comfortable, Dean."
They’re the last words he hears before everything goes dark.
Castiel sets the gag to the side, and then goes back to the drawers to pick out supplies.
"Oh, sweet boy," he says quietly. "I'm so sorry. I've got you."
Too soon and after way too long, Dean feels himself about to tip over the ledge, fingers playing with his slit that’s practically drooling at this point.
“All mine,” Cas says. "Good night, sweet boy." Kissing his cheek before turning the light off, Dean settles on his chest and Cas's hand on the knot of his wrists.
"What the hell was that for?"
Dean should have asked before they started this, but thinking is a little hard when Cas starts to slowly glide up his cock.
“Are you safewording?” Cas asks gently, his fingers trailing over Dean’s back.
“Can’t even do something so simple,” Cas sighs. “How pathetic.”
“Daddy,” Dean says quickly, balls aching. “Please. May I please suck your cock, Daddy?”
Before Dean can respond, before the confusion sets in, Cas turns him around and pins his hands above his head, shifting both wrists into one hand so he can grab Dean’s chin with the other, and they’re kissing. Cas is kissing him. Dean submits to the harsh treatment, the rough going straight to his cock broken whines escaping his throat, wishing he could touch.
“Um,” he says. “What do you mean?”
“You know how to safe word,” Castiel says, trying to act as unbothered as possible and not let his bratty boy see how much he’s affected.
Castiel gently leans Dean down onto a chair similar to a doctor's after unbinding his arms, restrapping them down into cuffs on the side of the table. He hooks Dean's feet up into stirrups, pushing them apart and spreading Dean's legs.
“But isn’t that a submissive’s job?” Dean asks. “To make their Dom happy?”
Cas turns around, leaving the bathroom. A rush of heat bursts through his stomach at the thought of using his boy tonight, at his reaction when he finds out that earlier doesn’t mean tonight. By earlier, he means that
