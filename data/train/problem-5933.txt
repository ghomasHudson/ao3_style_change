“Oh? Is it now? What’s in it?” Steve asked smoothly, tugging Tony into his lap just to hear the man squeak in surprise, “Based on the diagram, I have an idea.”
The backtalk was unappreciated, and Tony let him know with a hard smack to his ass. Steve lurched forward with a yelp, then dissolved into broken moans as Tony began to thrust. Originally, he wanted their first time this way to be slow and gentle, but evidently, Steve had grown too big for his britches and needed to be taken down a notch. Grabbing Steve’s left shoulder and his right hip for leverage, Tony pulled him back at the same time he moved his hips forward, driving his cock as deep as he could with each thrust. The brutal pace turned Steve into a sobbing, pleading mess, and each time he reached for his own cock for some relief Tony slapped his hand away.
PJ opened his mouth to answer, but a tiny shocked gasp came out instead.
“PJ? Like pajamas?” Clint snorted, twirling an arrow between his fingers before slipping it back into his quiver.
“I—I apologize. You were in the Red Room, yes?” Tony asked quickly, shrinking when Thor translated and her stare deepened to a glare, “My father, the king—he and the Captain of the Guard once told stories of capturing a Black Widow, trained in the Red Room and carved into unbreakable spies. They used to gloat about having her in captivity, but as far as I know, they never got anything from her. Eventually, they had her killed. I did not know there were other Widows still alive.”
He held tight to the boy for what felt like hours, not daring to let him go or move them in case he woke the child up. Instead, Tony stared up at the ceiling in the semi-cerulean darkness, silently wishing he had been awake during the transport so he could at least know the right direction to getting topside if they were ever given the chance to escape. Closing his eyes, he tried to imagine the original bunker PJ was found in. If HYDRA was as predictable as they had been in the past, the bunker should have roughly the same layout.
Steve sat down on the bed next to him, worry evident in his unusually clear eyes.
“Sorry,” Steve whispered, dropping his voice as he pulled over an ottoman to sit on, “I just—Tony—”
Thankfully, the path toward the Northern Territory was nothing more than a dense forest, giving Tony the dark cover he needed as he pushed on day and night, only stopping for food and drink when his feet began to protest. That, and whenever his bundle shifted. It was now the fifth morning of traveling by foot and based on his food supply, he was either going to have to start to hunt and cook or hope that he found his way to a Warlord camp. For now, he found a large, hollow oak to take refuge in, sheltering himself and his bundle. He had barely settled down when rain began to sound around him, pounding down on the strong tree. He was dry, though, so Tony paid it no mind.
Looking over at his laptop, Steve’s gaze landed on the drawing pad attached to the device, a fond string tugging on his heart. Once Tony had caught wind of how easily Steve had picked up on it, he made a holographic board in his lab that Steve could send art to, allowing the engineer to “hang it up on the fridge, because that’s where it damn belongs, but no one has the time to print things, Steve.” Then, when Steve was in the lab, he would occasionally catch Tony looking at the display of doodles, a distant look in his usually focused eyes.
“Father,” he tried, attempting to draw attention away from his classmates behind him.
“This one is the best,” he decided, taking off his backpack and pulling out a box of crayons and a notebook before hanging the bag up on a hook in the cubby.
“You’re telling me,” Steve sighed, finally dressed in SHIELD-issued sweatpants and one of Tony’s biggest shirts, “I’m fine. Banged up, but I’ll live, which is the important part.”
“They will come down from it eventually. I do not know how long they will be in shackles, but I think James should be fine by the evening. He scented of authentic righteous anger, while Steve reeked of annoyance and jealousy. It is more difficult to come back from being feral when Alphas feel that way.”
“Don’t make me knock you and the kid out. We only need you alive, not in one piece,” the second guard growled, eyeing Tony, “Sit down and shut up.”
Tony watched in complete surprise as Steve reached out with a shaky hand, only inching it closer to PJ once he didn’t flinch away. After a few moments, PJ reached his own hand back out, laying it ever so carefully on Steve’s large palm. The Captain finally choked, hanging his head to try and swallow the noise.
“I thought I was going to lose you,” he whispered, “I thought I was going to watch you die—this is the
“Hey, hey, none of that, now,” Rhodey said somewhere off to his left.
Tony laughed softly, albeit awkwardly as he hummed in the positive.
around and then attempting to skew this whole thing to be like a kid drifting between separated parents,” Tony replied hollowly, looking down at PJ’s small hand in his own, “I won’t do that to PJ. We gotta—we gotta do right by this kid, Brucie.
“No! No hospitals, I can’t—I can’t go to a hospital,” Tony panted, trying (and failing) to push Bucky away, “I don’t—I’m fine, really—”
Tucking the vials into his lab coat, Bruce raised an eyebrow, glancing between them before settling on PJ’s curled up form.
“Alright, prepare to be amazed by—Steve?”
“At least you seem repentant,” he said, “We need to lay down rules and learn a way to communicate—I know you have trouble with my language, so I think I will have to learn yours. I do not care for not being able to talk with you,
“It’s okay. If you want to look into it, we can, baby,” he said softly, wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist, “But…preferably when we’re not on the precipice of being eaten by dinosaurs.”
“Hello, my love. Did you enjoy your time with Miss Natasha?” Tony said, turning to play-bite at the baby’s fingers, “You have stayed so quiet and calm today, despite all that is going on. You have your mama’s strength, hm?”
“Oh. I—after meeting Thor, it was my assumption that I was mostly alone,” he explained, frowning when the woman laughed.
He huffed softly, feeling his initial anger melt into concern. Shaking his head, Tony stepped forward into Steve’s personal space, ducking his head to try and meet PJ’s sleepy gaze.
Tony flicked his eyes over to Rhodey, relaxing once he saw his friend’s calm face.
“The betting pool on you two. Did they not tell you? We have a huge group bet as to when you two would get together,” Rhodey said slowly, looking at the two men, “…No? Okay. Well, you didn’t hear it from me, but I’m about a week out if you guys want to hold off that long.”
The Alpha gently laid his hand on the small of Tony’s back again, guiding him away from the stall and into the throng of the marketplace. With the masses of people around them, the sling around Peter started to feel more constricting than helpful. Tony easily managed to untie the scarf and handed it over to Steve, already feeling better once he had the baby on his shoulder.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay, we know this is confusing for you, especially since you’re so young,” Tony tried, improvising on his feet like he had never done before, “We—ah, we want to help, okay? Just—please, we need you to not cry, we can’t help if you’re sobbing so loud—hold on, I got you—”
bastard of a father. You made your choice in good faith, Steven. Even if you could not say that yourself, the others have been quick to tell me about how good you are. Was it surprising and scary? Of course. But so was taking my son and running into the wilderness. And I do not regret that decision one bit.”
Steve nodded, jogging forward to open the castle doors for Tony and Peter.
been dead!”
Rhodey shot him a glare that Tony avoided looking at directly. They both knew he was probably lying, but he did not want to admit it out loud. He could control his biology, damn it; he would
HYDRA facilities aren't built for kids.
“Ha-ha, very funny,” he said, quickly panicking once he realized Pepper was staring at him from Rhodey’s other side, “I’ll be fine, it’s the kid I’m worried about. If anything goes belly up, you ping me and you retreat. I’m not there to be stupid, so don’t do anything stupid. Got it?”
“Good gods, you need to stop sneaking up on me,” he snapped, cuddling Peter to his chest since he had also scared the baby in the process.
“Nope, not dead, still here,” he interrupted with a laugh, “Just thinking about how much I want to be home already.”
“--I do have the kingdom to look after.”
He kissed the baby’s cheek and listened to the sounds of clanging and feet pattering in the kitchen, only looking up once the footsteps started to approach. Steve raised an eyebrow at him and set a bowl down in front of Tony, then took his own seat next to him.
Looking down at the compass in his hand, Steve grimaced, watching the needle idly spin. Since the device moved according to the Earth’s magnetism, it should be still, not constantly moving in circles. Something was going on in the desert, which is why he and his Special Ops team had been assigned to this area six years ago. There was no real telling as to why the needle spun; some days, it was still and pointed to true north, but other days like today, the needle lazily spun as if he’d flicked it with his finger.
“Look what you did,” Bucky hissed, “Now he is going to wake Tony up and--”
He dragged the guard over to the edge of the truck, and with PJ’s help, pushed the body out, smirking as Steve expertly jumped the motorbike over the body.
intention of doing. I realize that I am an Omega, but a father still has his rights,” he said, growing more frustrated as he talked.
He choked on another sob and bowed his head, pressing Tony’s hand up against his face. Ignoring the tears that slid down his face, he pressed shaky kisses into his palm and down his wrist, comforting himself with the taste of Tony’s pulse under his lips.
“Like what? Live at Steve’s for the rest of my life and put him and Sarah in danger? He’s sent people to get me before, and…”
“Clothes?” Tony asked, then sighed and shook his head, reminding himself about the language barrier.
was going to be an interesting challenge. Rhodey was close to his height and weight, but Steve had half of a foot of height on him and was at least 50 pounds heavier, all in muscle. There was no way he could brute force his way through a fight. He was going to have to be sly about it, hence the concentration. One peep from Peter could distract him and put his ass on the mat.
With a sigh, Tony scooped up PJ wrapped in the blanket into his arms again, holding him close to his chest. He bounced the child slightly, trying to help keep him warm.
“Okay. Roofie-ing me with ibuprofen is ethically questionable, but I was more concerned that it was something with opioids in it,” He explained, “I’m—”
Steve dragged his eyes up from PJ to look at Tony, the wet glaze not going unnoticed. Tony huffed and gave a gentle smile, aching to reach out and try and give some sort of comfort.

, huh? You like colors? I wish Steve had stayed for this, he would have loved to teach you colors and art,” Tony murmured, balancing the book in one hand so he could keep his other arm wrapped around the boy.
and go
. Just as they were about to stumble into the building, he pulled them to a halt, earning a confused grunt from Steve. Grinning wildly, Tony crouched down and picked dandelions and a few grass leaves from the lawn, hearing Steve laugh behind him once he realized what he was doing.
Tony smiled as Bruce carried on laughing, stopping them in front of an open doorway. He gestured for Tony to enter, letting them walk into the armory.
By the time he had finished cleaning up PJ’s room and bathroom and returned to his bedroom, apparently Steve had showered and collapsed on the bed, because that’s where Tony found him, splayed out on his side with PJ on top of his back, equally as asleep and snoring into Steve’s neck. He bit his lip and motioned for JARVIS to snap a picture, quietly backing out of the room and closing the doors to leave them to sleep.
“It’s okay, Steve,” Tony finally murmured, putting a hand on the other’s back to rub comforting circles, “You freaked. It’s okay. He forgives you. Look.”
“When we made up his bed. He just said it when I was sort of moping after Steve started being Steve while we were talking and saying cryptic shit and then the kid panicked and so to escape Steve talking I took PJ to his bedroom,” Tony babbled, sitting up and picking at the skin around his nails, “That was right before he started to jump and passed out. So. Fairly new development.”
“Goodnight, my love. Sleep well,” he whispered quietly, backing up to blow out the surrounding candles.
He led Steve over to an open bed and had him sit, gently petting his hair to try and keep him calm. With Peter shifted into a better position and tucked up against Steve’s chest, his wails turned to soft cries, but even they were quieted when Tony reached down to smooth back his fine hairs.
Steve pulled his hand back from Peter and made a pitiful noise. With great effort, he lifted his head, allowing Tony to see that his pupils were nearly dilated enough to cover the blue of his eyes.
“Hey,” Steve said gently, causing Tony to crack open his suspiciously wet eyes, “You with me, Iron Man? Or do you need a minute?”
“I think he already knows. I went up to change and he was in PJ’s room singing to him,” Tony muttered, leaning into her touch for once, “I used my emergency elevator so I wouldn’t have to talk to him.”
“The past cannot be changed,
“And?”
Tony laughed, slipping his arm around Steve to bring the Alpha in to lay on his chest. He nuzzled the top of his head and kissed him there, taking a moment to just breathe in his warm scent. It was domestic, to be curled up in bed with an Alpha in the middle of the day, but he found that he did not mind. Rather, having Steve be willing to take the submissive position even in their cuddles made his heart seize and his stomach flutter.
, Omega,” Steve growled, secretly enjoying Tony’s full-body shiver at his Alpha voice, “I will take care of you. Trust me to do that for you.”
“Tony,” Natasha said patiently, “Perhaps it would be best for SHIELD to care for him for the time being. You don’t exactly have any experience in parenting, let alone parenting a traumatized, abused child that’s been in captivity—”
so you two can play Kings and Queens,” Natasha interrupted firmly, “Tony and his James can come separately with Peter once we have secured--”
Slowly, the Avengers dispersed, leaving Pepper standing by the side of the room as she watched Tony start to relax. Smiling softly, she padded over to the chair, running her fingers through Tony’s hair once she was close enough.
“Yeah, but he doesn’t recommend you do it, especially when you’re surrounded by live bombs,” Natasha added unhelpfully from the shower.
“Well, best get to it. They won’t read themselves,” he said, picking his wiring back up.
Tony glanced at his family crest still held by the second-in-command Alpha, swallowing nervously.
“We are well. Banner’s medicine and some food seemed to have helped a lot,” Tony admitted, “Hopefully one more dose and another rest will bring me back to full health.”
“Do not be fussy, my love. Daddy is okay,” he murmured in the Southern language just to piss Steve off, “Come; you and I will have a cuddle.”
“Okay, I’m out,” Tony finally said, shuddering as he handed his papers over to Natasha, “I—shit, that’s messed up. Even for an evil organization. And I don’t even
“We have him now,” She stressed again, maintaining eye contact, “That’s the important part.”
Tony rolled his eyes and went up on his tiptoes to kiss Steve, laughing when small grubby hands pushed at his face in protest.
However, when the elevator doors slid open to his floor, the first thing he heard was singing, and that pissed him off even more. He knew that either Bucky or Steve had to be the one down in PJ’s room, so he avoided it, heading straight for his own bedroom. Finding Rhodey’s hoodie, Tony shoved it on and grabbed some fluffy socks, putting them on as well before sliding into comfy sweatpants and his Iron Man slippers.
He mentally prepared himself for the crying that was definitely going on, but
The group looked at each other, and other than Tony and Clint’s respective glare and enthusiastic nod, there was a collective head shake.
hate me,” Tony snapped, standing and walking through the hologram to start to pace around the room, “That doesn’t make any fucking sense—we were cool after New York, we were even cool when I
Honestly surprised he got a verbal answer, Tony made a strange noise before getting with the program. He easily picked PJ up under his armpits, setting him on his hip before comfortably wrapping his arms around the boy. Seemingly satisfied, PJ rested his head on Tony’s shoulder, putting his hand back in his mouth to chew on his fingers. Tony cast a frantic look to Natasha, who merely glared and shook her head as if to say
Steve nodded, an amused smile finally coming to his lips.
“So, who told you I’m good with kids?” Clint piped up, twirling an arrow between two fingers as he watched Tony scuttle around.
“What about the X-Men?” Clint asked from his desk in front of Tony, turning around to join the conversation, “Don’t you play them today?”
Tony’s weak sigh told Steve he was being a little too serious, so he leaned up to kiss him, sliding his hands up underneath his grimy workshop tank to press against the small of his back.
He turned back onto his side to face the baby, feeling some relief that the child was asleep. After seeing the look on Bruce’s face that morning, he knew the man had been up all night with Peter, which meant Peter had
, and he would do everything in his power to keep the boy safe. That meant he had to keep Peter away from his father, in a place where he would not dare to go. The babe yawned and startled Tony out of his thoughts; he smiled and curled the babe up against his chest, content to rock him back and forth as they waited out the storm. Once the rain outside dwindled to a soft patter, he swaddled Peter back up and kissed the tip of his nose.
“I know you wish to squirrel me away from the rest of society, where no one can hurt me or try to take me from you,” he said carefully, “But you need to understand that I am just as autonomous as you are. Omega or not, I am a person, Steve. Though I do admit that I like the feeling of… possession… I refuse to be a prisoner simply because you do not like how I dress.”
Bruce offered a tight smile and nodded, bowing his head before leaving and closing the door behind him. Tony let out the breath he had been holding and tilted his chin down to kiss the top of Peter’s head, readjusting the furs around them to cover them better.
“Hey, be careful,” Tony murmured, hissing as he adjusted and accidentally moved his ribs.
“They’re bringing the carriage around. We need to bring you—the
Thankfully, Jarvis chose that moment to check on them, immediately turning an eye to Clint.
“Surely I will crush you with my weight,” Steve mumbled.
“I’m going to be
“Thank you, Tony,” He finally said aloud, dashing away his curiosity.
“Y’know, I actually learned Frenching when I was in Nazi Germany,” Steve said aloud, flicking his eyes up in time to see Tony’s shoulders go up to his ears, “Some of those gals were feisty ones, all grabby and shit.”
“Sorry I took so long. Kind of more purple than pink right now,” he managed, waving at the bruising on his face.
Looking up, Steve noticed for the first time that Tony’s brown eyes had a little ring of gold on the very outside of the iris.
“Why were you out with the scouting party?”
he thought, feeling the stuffed elephant press up against his chest as PJ tried to get closer,
Steve waved a hand in the air, becoming more flustered by the second.
“Pep. Pretty,” PJ said softly, looking up at Tony, “Papa pretty?”
“No, no—it’s alright. I should have been there. For
Tony winced as she got up from the bed, remembering the horse head he had received that last time Thor brought gifts.
to,” Steve grumbled, obeying Tony’s wishes and collapsing down onto his side.
“You never do,” Pepper answered with a smile, running her manicured hand through his hair, “Bye, Tony. Please get that paperwork done.”
“So, what did it—he—what did he display?” Steve asked, flickering a glance over to the boy.
“Pancakes?!” Clint yelled, standing from being so baffled, “Where the
Also, he learns a lesson about listening to Steve.
“I miss you,” he said softly, smiling sadly at his knees, “Both of you. I can’t wait to be home.”
Tony tried to grimace, but he was a softie at heart, and hearing his closest friend talk sweet made him melt. It must have changed his scent, for Steve sat up and growled, directing his hostility at Rhodey.
“You’re welcome to stay there if you want, Cappuccino, I’ll be back soon,” he snorted, smirking as he watched the Captain’s face flush, even in the dark room, “We’ll just take a quick once around the Tower.”
The men stopped and Steve’s hand went still, causing another chill to raise bumps on Tony’s arms. He looked up and swallowed nervously, not liking the man’s careful gaze from above him. Then, the man huffed, and the corner of his lips twitched up as he brought the crest up to carefully place it over Tony’s head to settle around his neck. Stunned, Tony’s mouth fell open and he reached up to grab at the crest, picking it up to stare at it before looking back up to stare at the man again. Steve asked a question quietly into his ear and patted his back, either concerned about his lack of response or making sure he was okay.
At Steve’s nod, Tony slowly removed his hand, as if expecting Steve to immediately growl again.
“Afraid of a little raccoon?” Natasha scoffed, ducking in front of Tony to trudge forward into the room, “It’s just a—oh, hell. Tony, you’re going to want to see this.”
“Natasha—”
Tony heard Bucky’s foot connect with flesh and he tensed, shooting out from under Steve when the Warlord got up to try and attack the offending foot. He did not look back as he ran pell-mell down the hallway, flying past the extremely confused faces of the other Warlords. He ran up the stairs and toward his bedroom, only stopping once he found Natasha sitting on his bed with Peter fast asleep in her arms. She stared at him as he got to work barricading the door with Steve’s desk. He was not sure how long it would hold, but it gave him enough peace of mind to collapse next to Natasha, tucking himself up into her side and motioning for the baby.
“Don’t worry Cap, we’ll get you back to your boyfriend and lovechild soon enough.”
“What? Peter could know you are upset from a hallway away?” Rhodey asked.
“Is it my turn to watch?” Tony whispered, since Peter was still asleep on his chest.
“Sweetheart, I married you in preschool. This is just a technical formality,” Steve said, grinning at Tony’s watery laugh, “We can go to the City Clerk right now, sign the paperwork and everything. We don’t have to tell anyone if you want to keep it between us. We can graduate as
“Hey, you. Everything’s okay, I think he just had a fit. Sorry I left, I should have stayed just in case,” he murmured, happy to give Steve a quick kiss when the man tilted his head down.
“I know. I know he is trying. This is new, for us both,” he said, looking down at Peter to watch the baby contently gum on his doll, “He had been so kind to us today, and I had to go and ruin it by fighting with him.”
It had been the last conversation Tony had with him until the summer of complete hell. He was juggling a few classes, which was fine, but he had finally decided to go to his and Steve’s spot behind the old oak near their former preschool, where they’d shared lunch and played house together. The school was long gone, replaced by nature, engulfing the tree up into a private getaway. Tony snuck into the brush, intent on climbing the tree, only to find Steve and Peggy, the latter’s skirt hiked up to her waist and her back against the tree, Steve trembling in front of her as he held her up, his pants clearly unbuckled and crumpled around his thighs. They didn’t see him, but he clearly saw them, and with that, he turned around and ran home, throwing out his cell in a random trashcan as he ran. He threw himself into his schoolwork and into the Expo, designing and patenting new biomedical technology, including a comfortable, lightweight back brace, designed to help young kids with scoliosis get back outside and play.
“Dah,” PJ’s voice said, mumbled behind his sippy cup.
“Tony. We need to leave,” Thor interrupted quietly, translating for Steve, “We will return in a fortnight.”
pastry just
He barely got within a foot of Steve when the Prime pounced. He dragged Tony in, grabbing his ass in two handfuls as he captured his lips in an open-mouthed kiss that made the Omega feel dizzy. Tony grunted once his brain finally acknowledged that Steve was leading and he pushed him away, growling under his breath.
He pulled Steve into the bed, somehow tucking the larger boy up against him. Sure, the pressure irritated his now itchy bandaging, but Steve was back in his arms,
“Eat it, Barnes,” he said, sticking his tongue out.
,” Tony hissed, “What has gotten
He visibly swallowed and looked away, staring out the window as he took Tony’s hand in his own, squeezing it tightly.
“Been ready. I want my good sweatpants,” he admitted.
“I’m down,” Scott answered with a stretch, “Lemme go call Cassie first, and I’ll meet y’all down there.”
“I think it has to do with the death of the birther,” Bruce murmured, “I wonder if the bond between the mother and Peter got transferred to you upon her passing and the extreme situation you found yourself in elevated that bond.”
Finally, Steve turned to look at him, and Tony inwardly cursed as he saw the shift in Steve’s emotions from his Captain’s determination to pure Steve concern.
Tony grinned at Steve’s breathy whines and moved onto three fingers. His arm felt tired from working the Alpha open; no doubt the man’s strength helped to keep his ass tight, but Tony eventually made him loose enough that he could easily slip his fingers in and out.
“C’mon, get him up. The others have got whatever the hell this thing is, I’m sure Tony will want it back when he wakes up,” Bucky said, resting his hand on the back of Steve’s neck, “Up, soldier. We need to get him to a hospital.”
out, so he had an excuse for not immediately going to find him.
Comments and kudos are really appreciated! I really do read all of the comments but I usually forget to answer... oops.
in less than an hour and Steve was going to be
They looked at each other for a few quiet moments; Tony looked away first, fingering the album in his lap as he tried to think of what to say. Thankfully, Steve filled the silence.
“Captain, aren’t you going to say anything?” Thor said, turning his head toward him.
. He needed a wife, and I can be that to keep Peter safe. And, after the first few days, I… I am okay with it. Really. He tries, he really tries, and he is not your typical Alpha.”
“Somehow, he does not seem to type to let even death win.”
“Hey, Tony, we’re right here,” Bucky’s voice came from his left as gentle arms encircled him, “Coach is calling 911—”
Tony closed his eyes and nodded as he sank into the warmth of their bond. It did not take long for him to become drowsy again. Steve stood and picked him up to take him to bed; he was limp in his bondmate’s arms, too worn out from his own thoughts to make a fuss about being carried. Instead, he snuggled into Steve’s body and let out a small mewl of protest when he was inevitably put down on their bed.
Needless to say, Tony was thoroughly embarrassed, but Steve ignored it and hefted him up out of the bed once he was disconnected from the various machines placed around his bed. He easily carried Tony into the en-suite and set him down on his feet, hushing him when he started to complain.
Tony nodded and practically sprinted away, heading back into the school to skid toward the changing room. He stripped out of his gym clothes and put on his soccer uniform, staring at himself in the mirror. As an afterthought, he fished his headband out of his bag, putting it on to hold his long curls back.
“He is already growing so fast,” Sam said from where he was stretching, “Soon we will have to lock all the doors and cover all the tables as he learns to walk.”
angry and volatile, even if I try.”
“He’s out in the hallway. Noise and mass amounts of people bother him,” Tony explained, shrugging, “We can go wait in the living room for you all to be done. It looks good, though. Homey.”
Bruce laughed harder and steadied himself against the wall, wiping away a stray tear before heaving in a deep breath.
“We’re going to be okay, I promise,” Tony whispered, “Papa and the team are all going to be looking for us. They’ll come for us, I promise. We just have to survive until then, yeah? Can you do that? No matter—no matter what they ask, you
“I am well, Thor. Perhaps I ate too much too fast,” Tony lied, hiding his gaze from Steve, “Is—Is there a bed and a crib where Peter and I could lie down?”
“Go on, it’s okay,” Tony encouraged, despite giving Steve a side-eye.
“Of course, Captain.”
“I think it’s good,” Steve voiced calmly, slicking back his sweaty hair, “But it’s ultimately up to you, Stark.”
Tony paused at that, feeling more shame heat his cheeks and spread down his neck. He did not want Steve to hurt, it was not
. Sighing, he traced his fingers over Steve’s robot drawing taped to his side of the cubby. He took a quick look around before bending down, kissing the picture shyly.
“Oh, Tony,” Pepper murmured softly, getting up from her spot to go and sit next to them.
“Daddy?” he whispered, voice cracking.
“I apologize. I never intended for you to get hurt,” he said quietly, “We will understand each other soon, I hope.”
“Don’t—Don’t do that. Father won’t be happy,” Tony explained nervously.
“Oh, honey, I’m not mad, not at you,” he shushed softly, “Uncle Clint is just a meanie, that’s all. Everything’s okay.”
, yes, a few, at brothels,” Tony panted, having to hold onto Steve for dear life, “Never an A-alpha, never, only Betas, never had an Alpha, promise--”
“Can you not let me sulk for five minutes?” Tony grumbled quietly, not wanting to disturb Peter.
Of course, Tony spent the whole ride re-sharpening his dirty talk skills, being quite pleased with himself to see that he still had it, despite his momentary one-star vacation to Afghanistan. He wanted to give Steve road-head, but was firmly told no. Instead, Steve held his hand until they finally pulled into their home, at which Steve squeezed his hand and let go.

Tony waved his hand, pushing the name aside as he coughed slightly, grunting at the force.
Steve grunted and draped his cloak around Tony, ducking his head so all three of them were hidden in the semi-darkness. The Prime smiled and nosed at Tony’s cheek, whispering soft words that loosened his taut shoulders despite not understanding the language. Even Peter seemed to find comfort, for the babe’s wails dwindled to quiet whines, bearable enough that Tony could move the baby back up to his shoulder.
“He cries because he is an infant,” he explained for what felt like the thousandth time, “And he
“Yeah, good,” He agreed, propping his chin up on Tony’s head.
is, isn’t it,” he grumbled, “I thought we’d talked it out and were doing something, but I guess not if he thinks I’d pick Barnes over him. That’s just idiotic.”
“Off,” Tony tried to demand, sounding more pouty than authoritative.
It was quiet, so Tony moved his head, trying to look at Steve’s face.
“No, no. We are already here, he can last a little longer. If he really was tired, he would be making a racket like you have never heard before,” Tony said, “Is the forge next?”
“In case an armful of wet, naked child escapes from me,” Tony replied, grinning at the color draining from Steve’s face, “Looks like you’re about to be catching for once in your life, Rogers.”
“Are you saying that because I’m a woman or because you’re suggesting something?”
Despite Steve’s repeated attempts to help Tony sleep for more than a half hour at a time, nothing seemed to work until pure stress and exhaustion knocked him out after a week of struggling. Then, just a little hour into his first real rest, Tony started to convulse on the bed, waking Steve up and forcing him to call the nurses, Bucky, and Rhodey when he couldn’t bring Tony out of the nightmare. It took all six of them to finally wake Tony up, and by that time, Tony had screamed himself hoarse and pissed himself out of fear. Rhodey, Bucky, and two of the nurses cleared out to give them space, but both Rhodey and Bucky agreed to wait outside.
Tony laughed and reached around to grab the bottle, unbuckling the belt in the process to set it aside. Pausing for a moment, he kissed Steve’s cheek, nudging him up with his shoulder.
fathered Peter, or did I miss something?”
“Of course not. I’ve got snacks and food in the bag,” Steve said, watching as Tony reached over the bed to pet PJ’s hair, “I figured juice would make him sleepy though and considering what went down, he probably didn’t get a nap like he’s supposed to have.”
“So…the caravan. I was the only one who made it out alive. We were attacked with—with my own weapons,” he continued, voice slightly strained, “I saw the logo before a bomb exploded next to me. Thankfully, I was wearing a bulletproof vest, but you know me, I think ahead for all that when designing those things. Shrapnel went into my chest. Next thing I knew, I woke up in a cave, in massive pain, then everything goes blank for a while. I ended up with a version of this, but it was attached to a car battery that I had to lug around. I was saved by a doctor that the terrorists had captured earlier—Yinsen. His name was Yinsen. He was supposed to escape with me, but—but—”
“So, you can be Mom. I’m Dad, ‘cause I know how t’mow the lawn an’ read the newspapers,” Steve said proudly, digging out a tiny orange to split open, handing Tony a slice, “Tasha an’ Buck are our kids an’ Thor an’ Bruce an’ Clint an’ Sam are the neighbors. Thor is their Dad an’ Bruce is the Mom an’ Clint an’ Sam are their kids.”
“Nat, come with, please?” Tony finally called.
He rubbed a hand over Peter’s back and sucked in a breath, trying to keep the quiver out of his voice.
worried. You’re not the only one who cares about him, stupid.”
Not wanting to seem rude, Tony quickly shed his knapsack and wineskin, then tucked Peter under his shirt once more and tied him in place with his sash. He placed a hand under the baby’s rump to keep him steady, then nodded to Thor. The giant easily pushed open the doors to the throne room and they stepped through with Tony slightly hiding behind the man. The room was dead silent and the Alphas standing around them stared at him, unblinking and unmoving. Based on their armor and warpaint, it was obvious that they were the other Warlords, most likely in a conference with the Prime. Once Thor began to speak their native tongue, all eyes swept to him, but none of them betrayed any emotion on their faces. Tony held back his whimpers at the overpowering pheromones in the room and forced himself to stand tall, tilting his chin up slightly.
“Alright, we need teams. Wanda, Vis, I want you two and Scott to go back to the compound we already went through. Vis, I want you to see if you can get any electronic records, or maybe find out where the escaped agents fled to. Bucky, you, Sam, and Natasha start intel. Pull out the stops, see if you can find where this weed started. Bruce, you help them with detailing components for the actual hardware HYDRA would have needed for this, so they can track it. T’Challa, go to Wakanda and see what your sources know. Though HYDRA’s dealings in vibranium mostly dealt with Cap, even the smallest bug about the current whereabouts of HYDRA operatives could be helpful.”
Feeling Steve’s eyes on his back, Tony made quick work of going through the boxes, huffing a laugh at the amount of Avengers-themed clothes that JARVIS had chosen. Once he’d picked out an outfit and found a box of Avengers pampers in the bottom—
“My apologies. He can be rude at times. Diplomacy is not his strong suit,” he apologized.
PJ sniffled, but seemed content in his blanket burrito now that he was nestled in-between their body heats. Tony pressed another kiss to his cheek and wiped off the last of his tear tracks, turning a smile up toward Steve once he felt lips against his temple.
“Okay, well, you three interrupted our nice talk and rest time, so what do you want?” Tony sighed, making himself comfortable on his pillows again.
“Okay, Rogers, shoes and belt off, and into the bed. Or, I have extra pajamas in the closet,” Tony said, staring at the nervous blond, “You fought in World War Two. Thor knows you can get into a bed with another man and your
,” Bruce sighed, rolling his eyes skyward, “Bathroom-go. Not leave-go.”
Everyone stared at Steve, who pointedly was not making eye contact, staring down at where he was using his canteen to wash off the inside of his shield. With, presumably, the last bit of his water.
“I feel it. Your friend--Rhodey fights well,” Steve said, correcting himself, “He has good form.”
“You’re just bright and cheery, aren’t you,” Tony answered flatly, standing from his chair.
“If you say anything, I will end you,” he muttered, letting his hand drop from under his shirt.
. However, Peter was present, and that meant he was more concerned with the baby than his own perverted curiosity.
grade, they had actual parts to play, with lines and all. That is, except for those who had to dress up like animals and make appropriate animal noises when prompted.
“Why do you not want me to?” Tony asked in return, raising an eyebrow when Steve’s face colored pink, “It is not like it is something I have not seen before.”
“Alright. You’re carrying him,” Tony said once he forced himself out of the car, swallowing a pained groan so he could walk around to open the passenger door to let the other two out.
“Colonel? PJ, ah, heard Tony, and is asking about him.”
He stumbled out of the room, and Tony looked up at his Mother standing there, watching as she silently trailed after his Father. It took all of five seconds before hell broke loose.
The boy’s stomach growled in response, at which Tony laughed softly, leaning up to press a kiss to PJ’s cheek. The movement tugged on his ribs, making him groan as he laid back down, hand automatically moving to his injury.
“Yeah, smart,” Steve interrupted with a sigh, laughing when he felt Nat’s gaze on him, “Sorry. Tired.”
“Do you not want to share your heat with me?” Steve asked, making no attempt to hide the devastation in his voice.
“And what about Tony?”
Swallowing the lump in his throat, Tony offered a brittle smile, letting Steve squeeze his hands.
, Tony. Have you not done the same to me, standing up to an Alpha to protect your Omega son, regardless of the consequences?”
be the big green man. He puts his hand on someone else’s hand and for whatever reason it helps him to calm down. I’m not really sure if you totally get—”
He looked up at Nat to catch a wisp of a smile, which was just as good as a boisterous laugh. Comforted, he relaxed and let her slide an arm around him again.
“I feel like no matter what I do I am going to hurt him,” he admitted quietly, “As a baby, he was an anonymous little thing with bright eyes, but now I can see so much of Mary in his face and nose--I fear he will feel my heartbreak and think that I resent him. However, if I attempt to stymie our bond to keep that from him, he will feel me pushing him away…”
“Do you have yourself under control?” She said, “Do you think you can stay calm if you stay close to Tony?”
Forcing himself out of the inner debate, Tony stood from the chair and looked around, catching his face in a dark computer monitor. He quickly fixed himself up to try and hide the freshly-cried look, only to give up and run a hand through his hair. Now sufficiently rumpled, but not at
“Mm. He has your genes, after all,” Tony answered carefully, turning his head to not give away the look of longing that had crept onto his face.
“Are you sure about this?” he asked, looking up at Steve.
“You okay, kiddo?” Tony murmured, spreading out their new blanket over them both, “I got you. And hopefully, the others will be here soon. Do you think you can sleep? It’ll help you feel a little better.”
people warm and fed. Understand?”
It didn’t take long for the shield’s contents to be made into mounds of hotcakes and quickly be devoured by the Avengers. Tony waited to eat last, making sure each of the soldiers, plus the demigod and gamma bomb, each had their fill before spearing a cake with one of Clint’s arrows to nibble on. His nerves never let him eat much, but from the way Steve stared at him until he took it, he knew he’d have to at least make the attempt.
“Hey. You’re probably all sticky, and we never really did clean you off much when we found you,” Tony explained, “I’m going to guess you hate water though, so I’m going to give you a sponge bath, okay? I have to do this for myself too. I hate baths. And showers.”
Unbeta'd.
“It was unintentional.”
He squeezed Steve’s hand once more and let go so he could rifle through the closet, coming up with another pair of Omega underwear and a large shirt that came down mid-thigh. Thankfully, there was a pile of infant’s clothing on the bottom shelf, clearly newly laundered. He chose a blue dress and matching undergarment, attending to Pete to dress him then put the babe back in the crook of his arm.
“He is important to me,” Tony managed to whisper, unable to speak any louder for fear of breaking down completely, “He is important to
“Be safe,” Tony whispered to Steve between hurried kisses, “Please, please be safe--”
“And Mom and Dad as the last pair. Fitting,” Natasha said, putting the hat at her feet, “Now, everyone decide who is going first and who is second. Those going second will leave the room.”
of Prime Alphas have worn this, both in the kingdom and on the battlefield. I cannot just--”
Bucky turned up his card, grinning as the two high-fived.
“They put their spliced DNA into a synthetic egg,” Bruce explained, waving away the silent question.
Tony didn’t offer up any sign of recognition, so Steve took a breath and backed off, retreating to the futon to curl up and tug Tony’s old MIT blanket over him. The damn thing was heavy, but that meant it was warm, and in the cold shop, it was almost a necessity for him. Once he was settled and comfortable, Steve went through the box again to look for his next read. Considering it was only a shoebox, there weren’t a lot of books in it to begin with; he read another two stories from Tony’s early teens that had a similar comfort-type theme before he saw an age jump.
through so much shit. I’m fully prepared to drop the bomb if Steve even so much as combs his hair wrong, you know?”
Tony looked up at that, turning a flat stare to the blond.
Tony did not hesitate to sit, leaning up against Rhodey’s arm to rest his head on his shoulder. Rhodey hissed and moved his arm to pull Tony in instead, grunting at the movement.
He waited for the sting of the knife, but after a minute, Vis’ hand appeared in front of him with six bullets in it.
“Astute observation, Thor,” he said, his voice removed of any of the Northern accent, “I am Doctor Banner, Tony. You can call me Bruce, if you would like. I am the resident physician—the Prime informed us that you fell out of bed and are having trouble speaking?”
“Of course, sweetheart. Sit; I will not be long.”
“Pots of boiling water to be readied on the walls. If you have an example sword or can retrieve one, I can melt it and re-temper it to be stronger, or it can be crafted into a metal shield. Long-distance weapons would be superior, so perhaps you would want it to instead be made into arrows and crossbows?” Tony rattled off.
PJ nodded against his chest, his hand splaying out across the glass of the arc reactor; he seemed to be calmed by the light, and after a few minutes, familiar snuffles of the boy’s snoring filled the otherwise silent room.
Tony’s eyes bugged once he realized that Pepper was right.
“Well, yeah, but now every time I wear it I’m going to think of when my kid threw up on it.”
Slowly, Tony eased them down onto the chair, letting PJ settle in his lap. The boy looked confused for a moment before attempting to hide in Tony’s shirt again. He snorted a laugh, shaking his head fondly while lightly patting the boy’s back.
“Tony!” Steve gasped, hand tightening on Tony’s hip.
“You are doing so well, honey, are you sure you want me to take him back?”
wait to tell Pepper,” he wheezed, “She’s going to be so thrilled—ugh, but then T’Challa wins the pot—”
wearing it. Now, unless you want to have a meaningless fight over this, leave it on the bed,” Tony growled, inwardly hoping that Peter would not wake, “Otherwise, you can stay here and pout like a child while I go see Rhodey with Peter.”
“Scoot over.”
It took both Bucky and Rhodey to convince Steve to sit down and put on his seatbelt. They sat on either side of him, tense and ready to throw their backs out if they were going to have to keep him seated. Steve knew this; he recognized their movements, saw how they both leaned in a little closer than necessary, their hands tight and ready for a fight. Looking over at Tony, strapped to a board and unmoving, he knew that he had no qualms with breaking either man’s arms in order to get to him if something went wrong.
, you say the
The boy giggled slightly, and Tony felt his breath be sucked from his lungs as recognition crossed Steve’s face.
“My name is Anthony, and I hail from the Southern tip, from the city of Ma’atan, ruled by the king Howard Stark and the queen Maria Stark,” he said with a slightly quivering voice as he tried to ignore Thor translating next to him, “I have come seeking refuge from my home. I fear for my life.”
“See, that’s the problem, Rhodes,” he sulked, “I know I should get over him. It’s been over a
“The scan room is ready,” one of them announced, “We’re going to take him down. You’re welcome to come with us.”
“Oh?” Rhodey asked, passing Bucky a drink before getting one for himself, “Granted, I’ve only been here since Tony started college, and he never really talks about his childhood.”
confused at his request. Steve merely rolled his eyes and climbed into Tony’s cot, tossing his blanket over them both and re-settling Mr. Rabbit between them.
“That I would learn? Darling, you clearly do not know me yet,” Tony laughed, squeezing Steve’s shoulder, “You will learn soon.”
“Yes, I am aware of his proclivities to not wearing armor in the field. None of us approve. It is not only reckless, but it
kid a book and we’re going to read, because that’s a thing people do with their kids, and I’m going to be a great dad, dammit.”
“Steve,” Bucky tried again.
Carefully, he turned onto his side to face the wall, cringing at the wet feeling between his legs. Humiliation soaked his skin and he wanted to sink into the floor. It was bad enough that Steve could feel him hurting, but to then have to
Tony felt his eyebrows shoot up to his hairline, at which PJ immediately started to back down, curling in on himself with shame and taking his hand from Steve.
“She is perfect, is she not, my love?” Tony whispered, giggling to himself when the baby tried to gum on the doll.
“I do not think he is ill—if he is, he is most certainly not feeling as awful as you,” he decided, “I think it would be best for Peter to stay close to you. Omegas heal faster when they have their infants nearby—there is a whole study of pheromonic healing, if you would like to hear it when you are well. In the meantime, since you are too ill to be out of bed, someone has to take care of Peter’s needs. Would you like me to show the Prime what he is to do while you rest?”
“Give me a month,” Tony asked, turning to make eye contact with Natasha, “Please?”
“Right. Sorry. Good news is, I can see the chopper from here. Can you handle him?”
“Thanks, Steve,” Tony murmured once the movie was playing, letting Steve protectively take his hand.
“Sorry, sorry,” Tony whispered, panicking a little as he sat up and curled around Peter, not-so-subtly batting Steve’s hands away.
“My life is never not going to be weird, is it?” he asked rhetorically.
“I feel like I should be offended,” he said, slowly dragging his eyes up from the child to Tony’s face.
Shivers ran down his spine. Heat still consumed him, and with a choked gasp he realized he had soaked the sheets between the legs. He clumsily reached up to grab the cloth over his eyes and flung it away so he could look down at his body. His skin shined with sweat and his cock lay hard and wanting against his thigh. He quickly realized that the soaked sheets were due to his slick, but the pain in his bones overrode any embarrassment he may have felt. Gods, he needed
“So… what do we do?” Clint eventually asked, looking around the room.
“Yeah.”
“Get Bruce,” he whispered urgently, “Go—and get Nat, too.”
“Come home safe,” he said softly.
Thankfully, he did think to repack the jet’s emergency kit, which meant they had tents, a flint and steel, and some water tablets, but beyond that, they were screwed. Plus, since Thor no longer had his hammer, even Heimdall was unreachable.
Peter did not seem to care much, as he fisted his hands in Tony’s chest hair to keep himself anchored as close as possible. Tony sighed and attempted to dress himself, only managing underwear and pants before having to guide Peter away so he could dress the baby.
Satisfied that he shocked Steve into silence, Tony carried PJ out of the room and into his new bedroom. He thought about his sentence for only a millisecond, only to chalk the strangeness of it up to Steve’s inane observational skills. With a tiny huff, Tony set PJ on his feet once they were in the bedroom, looking around at the half-finished project.
“Like-like? Seriously? I was unaware we were in the fifth grade.”
He squashed the rabbit trail, opting instead to stand in front of the glass with his arms crossed, carefully watching PJ’s small body be transferred to the CAT bed and slowly moved into the machine. What felt like days was only minutes, but Tony found himself having to remind his lungs to inflate and deflate so he didn’t pass out and create more problems.
The ride up to the common area was quiet, but the silence was, for once, welcome. Tony took the opportunity to try and come up with how he was going to explain the entire genetic code component to Steve, only to shake it from his head.
,” he begged, “Do not tease--”
“...I have to agree with Tony,” Clint voiced from the back of the room, “Not that I do not mind your body, Steve, but I may have fewer nightmares if my eyes are not constantly assaulted by your delicates.”
“Thanks Pep,” Tony muttered, a tiny smile twitching onto his lips, “But it’s not his fault.”

He woke with a start, blinking rapidly up into Bruce’s concerned eyes. He managed a half-smile, but the physician raised an eyebrow in response and he knew there was no reason to keep up a charade.
The two men looked at each other for a moment, a mutual understanding sending chills down Tony’s spine. He looked away before Steve did, slipping off the counter with a grunt. Realizing that his pain was better without an ice pack on, horror must have shown on his face, because Steve was right there, his hands gentle on Tony’s biceps.
“Anthony?”
Having the boy stand in front of him, Tony was at least thankful that HYDRA had let him keep his Captain America pajamas; slowly, he got PJ to shuck off the shirt, using only the light from his arc reactor to illuminate the boy’s injuries. Methodically, Tony worked up and down PJ’s arms before doing so with his chest and back, breathing out thankfully once he was finished.
“Yes, I love you, you dweeb,” he repeated, “I don’t think I would have willingly tried to give a toddler a sponge bath if I didn’t. You don’t—don’t feel pressured to say it back, alright? I’ve known that I’ve loved you since the moment we met, if you need time, then it—”

None of them were very fond of the plan, but tactically, it was understood as necessary. They pushed onward until the stars that were guiding them were swallowed up by the tree canopy, leaving them in darkness. A river was easy to locate by sound, and once they stumbled upon one, Clint allowed them to rest for the night. Tony waited for Bruce to get off and take Peter before sliding off himself, stumbling on shaky legs. He took back the babe and immediately sat down against the closest tree, spreading his legs wide to alleviate the ache from riding for so long.
Steve nodded against his chest, then shook his head, leaning back so he could look up at Tony.
“You’re just mad that Bucky said you were Goob.”
The team moved forward in practiced sync, weapons raised in case of an ambush. The first few rooms they investigated were either decorated with basic furniture or completely empty. It was not until they hit the second-to-last room that Tony put up his hand, stopping the party.
“Oh my god,” Steve sighed, putting his head in his hands, “Rhodes is going to kill me.”
Now that he wasn’t pressed up against the bars on the bed, Tony rolled his shoulders, wincing at the new ache that settled in the joints.
“I am not being Uncle Bucky.”
,” Rhodey said, dragging out the syllables, “He must
Steve pulled away sheepishly, reaching up to stroke his thumb over the place where his lips had been on Tony’s skin. He shivered again at the touch, involuntarily flicking out his tongue to wet his bottom lip before biting it between his teeth. Being under the Captain’s weighty gaze never failed to make him tingle with goosebumps, but with the heaviness of their conversation, Tony was sure that he was going to faint. Slowly, Steve leaned down, nudging his nose up against Tony’s to have him tilt his head, nearly brushing their lips together.
“You always know what to say,” he murmured, sitting up straight with a tiny smile.
Steve kept a few paces behind them, hands shoved in his pockets. Tony could feel his eyes on his back and shivered under the Captain’s watchful gaze, unable to make direct eye contact with him. Approaching the room, PJ stopped, then backed up a few steps. Tony raised an eyebrow, then heard the commotion; he rolled his eyes, crouching back down to the boy’s height.
are bonded to him. Though I have no doubts that the Prime is quite fond of Pete,
Steve moved his hand to squeeze Tony’s hip and smiled, leaning down to kiss Peter’s cheek before leading them outside. The cavalry had already gathered in the square outside of the castle, where Lieutenant Barnes was tending to a horse with no rider. Those gathered turned once Tony and Steve stepped out into the sunlight, and Barnes held out the reins for Steve to take as he easily hefted himself up onto his steed. Steve spoke to someone on his left and held out his hand, taking hold of his shield when it was handed to him and placed it on his back. Tony blinked and took in the image of the Prime Alpha on horseback, bathed in sunlight as the wind blew through the few strands of hair that had come loose from his braid. God, he was
“Hey, darling, I know you need attention, but you are hurting me a little bit here,” Tony gritted out.
“The Prime has agreed to grant you refuge,” he said, clasping his hands behind his back, “But he has laid out a…condition. Of sorts.”
“Hey there, little green. You did good today,” He commented, grunting as he sat down next to the brunet, “Hulk seemed happy he got some large toys today.”
“Did he bond you without your consent? If he did, I’ll kill ‘im, I swear.”
They exchanged a few soft kisses until Tony had to pull away with a soft whine, unable to look away from Steve’s plump and red lips.
Steve scowled, but Tony carefully put a hand on Steve’s knee, rolling his eyes. They all liked to tease them about their close friendship, but even Tony knew that Steve and Bucky were much closer. He merely ignored it and dug into his cake, happy to enjoy watching his friends eat and talk happily amongst themselves. However, once he saw Clint go to grab a fistful of cake and cock his arm back to aim at Scott, Tony sat up really straight and gasped, holding his hand out to try and stop him. The table froze at the noise, turning to stare at him.
“No, Tony,” he teased, “No one can hate you like a normal person since you aren’t a normal person to begin with.”
Tony’s head snapped up.
“This is going to scar,” he sighed, “At least the cut is clean. It will be easy to stitch up--here.”
feel like death, he can come see you, okay? Jesus, man, give yourself five seconds to recoup. Alright? Pep will kill me if I let you get hurt when I’m actually here to watch you.”
“Okay,” he said softly, attempting to relax his body as much as possible.
Tony wondered to himself, letting his feet take him where they may while his thoughts roamed free,
“Do you know how the armor is made?” Tony asked, peering at one of the breastplates still left on a mannequin.
, and you sure as hell won’t win against the Avengers.”
“Nat better have a shirt,” he grunted to himself, waiting for Bruce to be done cleaning before they turned and headed for the elevator again.
“What?” Tony asked, worried he had done something wrong.
“I could get used to waking up like that,” he murmured, eyes unfocused and hazy, “I mean, I’d prefer it if you were kissing my—”
“Dramatic, hm? I should not have expected less,” Tony said, quickly moving to unlatch Peter and lay the babe down on the bed, “Stay still. Just another minute, hm?”
“Oh, shit, right.”
“Shh,” Tony hushed, blindly looping an arm around Steve’s waist and pulling the other man down on top of him.
Pushing open the door, he padded over to the bed, shushing PJ as he settled the boy under the sheets.
Tony laughed and the four were off, headed to a called car to take them to a private airstrip to board one of Tony’s private jets. Of course, Tony reminded Steve of his promise of the Mile-High Club, but from the looks they got from both Rhodey and Bucky, they ended up sprawled over a couch in the airplane, snoring away.
,” Steve groaned, letting his head fall forward, “Just get on with it.”
“Move! We’re extracting, let’s
Leaving Clint to keep watch over PJ, Tony and Steve hesitantly followed Bucky down to the common room, joining their fellow Avengers once more for a group meeting. Tony immediately sidled up to Natasha’s side and Steve to T’Challa’s, both men clearly impatient and antsy.
Without hesitation, Steve leaned forward and took the piece from Tony’s fingers with his mouth, licking his fingers to clean off the lingering spices. Tony tried to suppress the shiver that ran down his spine and gently pulled his hand away, pretending that he was not watching Steve lick his lips. He finished off his food and occasionally shared more bits with Steve, even letting him have the last piece on the plate.
Tony sighed happily in the warm bed, stretching out all of his limbs so he was starfished out, taking up as much room as possible. Usually, being reminded of the size of his bed and how much it dwarfed him made him uneasy, but he could feel the warm spots next to him where Steve had been sleeping, and for once, he didn’t feel so alone. He closed his eyes, drifting somewhere between awake and asleep as he listened for Steve cooking, his baritone easy to pick out against the occasional high chirps of PJ most likely asking for bits. The smell of eggs and ham and fresh coffee filled his nose, and just as he forced himself to shuffle and sit up in bed, Steve was carrying a tray in to set on his lap.
bed in matching pajamas,” he said quickly, already seeing the talk forming on Steve’s lips, “Okay? Yeah? I know I’ve scared you more times than you care to count, sweetheart. But, as you can see, I am quite
“Only daughter of the owners of the largest coal mining operation in the South,” Tony explained.
Tony snorted and rolled his eyes.
“I know. And Rhodey also knows better than to poke at you. I will have a conversation with him tomorrow after he has had a chance to get to know the others and the way of life here. It is not only on your shoulders, darling,” Tony soothed, reaching over to rub Steve’s arm.
“He’s going to kill us both,” Tony said smugly, “But it was worth it. Isn’t that right, sweet pea?”
,” he teased, holding a hand out to beckon him forward, “Thank you, Tony.”
He sniffled when he pulled back, picking up the hospital sheets to play with in his hands.
Quickly, he squashed the thought, setting to memorizing the child’s face. His features seemed so small and dainty, like porcelain that would break at the slightest touch. Drifting back to Steve for a moment, Tony smiled at the boy’s eyelashes, noting how much they looked like Steve’s: almost feminine, as they were long and thick.
A flash of hurt flickered in the bond, but it disappeared as quickly as it came. Tony furrowed his brow in confusion as he watched Steve move to leave, only to be stopped by Natasha’s hand on his arm.
Before the thought of germs or awkwardness could even flit through his mind, Tony quickly set to making sure PJ was wiped clean and re-dressed, then lifted up to the sink to have his hands washed while Natasha flushed the toilet and set the lid down. Tony then washed his own hands, ignoring the crawling feeling under his skin.
“Oh, really? His best friend is wrong?”
Eventually, PJ relented and scooted out from behind Natasha’s leg, letting her go over to Bucky to help him up from his crouch. Rolling his eyes, he knocked his shoulder against her own, a hint of a smile on his lips.
“Are you alright?”
“Thank you,” Tony breathed, blinking away hot tears as gratitude and relief welled up inside of him, “I cannot—I am so thankful—”
“Oi, shove it, birdboy,” Bucky shot back.
Tony opened his mouth to answer, then closed it, not quite sure how to continue.
Tony got himself turned around and ran a few feet when Steve’s mass barreled into him; he screamed and groaned as he was knocked over and brought down to the ground with all of Steve’s weight on his back. He tried to move, but Steve slipped his arms under him to wrap around his torso and hold him in place. The new position allowed him to breathe a little better. However, he was not a fan of being crushed.

A few of them chorused hellos, but Pepper stepped up to the front of the group, her hand jutted out for a handshake.
Sam pushed him back down and shook his head, rolling his eyes.
“Steve, that doesn’t make me feel any better.”
Steve refused to look up, brushing off the excess hair once he was done the trim. Satisfied, he put the scissors away and retrieved more wipes, taking to his new task like a new mission: anything to focus on to push out the crushing fear that threatened to send him into an inconsolable panic. He started cleaning up Tony’s neck, then ran down his arms and hands, carefully cleaning under his fingernails before picking up the scissors again to carefully trim his nails down. If it weren’t for his superhuman ability to remain steady, he probably would have cut Tony’s fingertips off.
“I’d say,” Steve said quietly, propping his arms up on the side of the bed, “He needs a proper bath. But sleep is more important than that right now.”
“Sweetheart, I do, but I also do not want to get pregnant and you know that that’s what my body is built for in a heat,” he said weakly, “I--I cannot risk it, not right now. You know this. With the threat of Howard on the horizon, we cannot afford to have any sort of liability.”
“I’m happy to see you’re making friends already, darling. You behave yourself, alright? I will be back to pick you up this afternoon,” she said, putting her delicate hands on his shoulders, “If you need anything, you know what to do, yes?”

“You in there, Captain?” Tony asked slowly, reaching out to lay a gentle hand on Steve’s arms, “Do you understand what I’m saying?”
He grinned and leaned down, blowing a raspberry against the babe’s cheek. He squealed loudly and tried to wriggle out of his blanket, only to have Steve scoop him up so they both could kiss his cheeks. PJ squealed even louder, laughing as he managed to get his arms out to he could push his small hands against their faces.
“Oh, fuck off! You’re the one winning!” Bucky shouted.

“I cannot accept your money,” He said, tossing it in the air so he could catch it and hand it back, “I—I already have taken so much, I cannot possibly—”
“This isn’t getting anywhere,” Tony finally admitted, his heart breaking to watch the child be so afraid, “We’ll be here all night like this.”
Tony grunted and jogged over, putting his hands on his hips as he stared up at Richards.
“Sam’s affectionate, but not like that,” he admitted, fiddling with the cap to his drink, “I try to be…romantic…but its definitely not my forte. I keep trying, though.”
Sighing, Tony headed into the shower with PJ, having to convince the boy to let go of his neck so he could put him down.
He nodded, and Thor stepped aside, revealing the Prime to him, slouched in his throne with his head on his fist. Tony paused and took the man in, hoping that his eyes were not as wide as dinner plates. He was smaller than Thor but broader, so well-defined in the upper body that his skin looked like it might tear. Unlike the other Alphas, he wore only a short leather kilt and boots, most likely traditional for his position. Red, white, and blue paint swirled on all of his available skin, creating intricate patterns that made Tony wonder if it was a language or merely a design. His hair was shaved on the sides, save for two small braids brought back around his head to meet with the large top braid. The whole thing was twisted together and hung over his shoulder. Strips of cloth and various hanging ornaments were intertwined with the hair: small trophies of the conquered, no doubt. He was undeniably handsome, and with a stroke of his carefully groomed beard, motioned to Tony to begin.
“Will do, Mr. Stark. Over and out?” Steve asked.
Listening to Steve whine pathetically, Tony quickly poured lube into his hand, distracting him with kisses as he warmed it up. He giggled at the Captain’s eagerness, nibbling on his bottom lip and eagerly slipping his tongue into his mouth. Groaning softly, he grabbed both of their cocks with his lubed hand, loving Steve’s sultry moan as he gently stroked them off together.
“I will be fine by myself. What I need is you all to take care of Peter for however long this goes on.”
“Okay Mr. Stark, you can roll back over,” one of the nurses said, helping Tony to get adjusted, “Now, could you lean forward?”
The nurse stepped forward with two sets of identical clothing: a white t-shirt, gray sweatpants, and what looked and felt like ballerina slippers.
leave without a word. He sighed and thumped his fist on the bed in frustration, running his hand through his hair.
Tony helped PJ off the bed and pointed at a door on the back wall, walking over with the boy to show him. Turning on the light, Tony smiled, crouching down to PJ’s level.
” Clint shrieked.
“Let me,” Natasha interrupted Tony’s thoughts, pushing him away, “Go see if one of those hospital bedrooms has a blanket or a sheet we can wrap him in.”
“He says the nursing garment is the reason why he called for me—you handed it back to him and all he understood from your speech was my name,” Thor explained, raising an eyebrow at Steve’s wild gestures, “He wishes to know why you will not accept it.”
“Hey there, big guy. I helped you and your dad back in the awful place, remember?” Rhodey said gently, sitting down on Tony’s bed, “I’ve heard so much about you. You like Captain America, huh?”
Tony sighed and turned around on his lap, ignoring Rhodey’s grunts of discomfort. He opened his mouth to explain what they said, but he was immediately assaulted with the scent of jealousy, coughing and moving his shirt above his nose to try and block it.
“Yes, we are all well. Merely talking to him--talking to babies is important for their development,” he explained, stuffing down his nerves into a bottle, “He is always calmer when he hears my voice.”
It didn’t take long before the pounding of footsteps came down the hall and the frantic scientist careened into the room, a stethoscope around his neck. Wordlessly, Tony moved aside for Bruce to sit, letting him get to work.
“Staying put is the best for now,” Steve replied as Tony frowned, “It's better to have most of the team around us for backup, just in case.”
“I’m sorry.”
“I need a bouquet,” Tony said once he was back in Steve’s arms, giggling into their umpteenth kiss.
“Fine,” he decided, turning to shrug on his lab coat and latex gloves, “If Nat will wait, so will I. But you’ll need to—”
His eyes bugged out as he realized what he said, putting his hands on his hips. Clint slowly placed himself between Bucky and Steve, pushing the former toward the door as what Bucky had said started to percolate in the room.
“I can’t tell him!” Tony hissed, keeping his voice down as the elevator doors opened to Bruce’s lab, “Could you imagine? He’d wring my neck before—never mind. Forget about it. I want to see if PJ has the serum, and if he does… I don’t know what I’ll do. We’ll do. I’ll probably have to reinforce stuff so he doesn’t accidentally break sh—stuff.”
He set the box down on the ground and opened up to the first page, only to slam the book closed. His cheeks felt hot and he knew that if he looked in the mirror his face would be flushed a beet red. Sure, Tony was, in general, quite sexual, but he’d been only seventeen. Never in his life would Steve have expected a giant diagram of a penis on the first page, with anatomical detail that made him swallow nervously.
“I really need to start doing words with you so you can talk more and tell me what you want,” He murmured, “Alright, up we go.”
didn’t want to read his about his namesake scolding Tony, but Tony had trusted him with it, so he forced his eyes back open and kept reading:
He grabbed another piece of paper and drew up a quick sketch of a hot oil catapult, placing it on one of the areas that needed more defense. Steve peered over his shoulder and gave him a suspicious look, to which Tony made a whooshing noise, scratching down a river of ink over the mock army to blot them out of existence. He turned back toward Steve to judge his reaction and stopped, flushing when he smelled the wave of proud Alpha pheromones that began to scent the room. It was a sweet scent and he reveled in it, preening under the man’s warm gaze.
Steve eyed Rhodey, but he willingly stepped aside, allowing him to move into his place to draw Tony into a hug. Before he could get too far, Tony reached out and grabbed Steve’s hand, squeezing tightly to find comfort. They stood quietly until Tony pulled away, smiling as he wiped away his last tears.
“Steve!” He yelped, smacking his arms, “Give it!”
“JARVIS, get Bruce up here,
…I know this is my fault, but I need you to come back. Peter and I are safe, see? You need to focus and
Once they were gone, Tony sunk down into the bed, pulling the covers up over his head.
good, so good for me--”
Theoretically, feeding should not hurt, but Bruce had been right—his left breast did feel less sore than it had in the morning, and the now-apparent swelling had gone down by a considerable amount. The thought that this would become a regular occurrence brought the taste of the medicine back to his mouth, so Tony pushed the thoughts aside and began to clean them both down. Peter was surprisingly pliant through his bath, not even protesting when Tony peeled his hands off of his chest to clean them.
“Bye, Pep. We’ll see,” he called over his shoulder, grinning at her sigh.
“Okay, you’re okay,” Bruce interrupted again, “I know. It’s fast. It’s
Peter reached out and grabbed onto the leather piece, giving it a few good tugs before Tony gently peeled his fingers away. He fussed for a moment, but Tony quickly kissed his cheek and hefted him up to his shoulder to more easily bounce him around the room.
“What? What just happened?” he mumbled to himself, “What did they put in that numbing? I’m not imagining this, right? He totally didn’t just go quietly.”
Tony turned to see if Steve followed, but the man only looked confused and worried, understanding his tone but not his words. He thought quickly and raised a finger, turning back around to grab a blank piece of parchment. He drew angry stick figures with weapons on it and showed it to Steve, then proceeded to rip it in half. He placed each half on opposite sides of the compound and leaned out of the way, motioning Steve forward to look.
Bruce shook his head. “We need to keep moving. Clint and James packed up and caught our breakfast, but we wanted to let you sleep in a little more. How are you feeling?”
“I agree. I wish I’d just let it slip all those years ago. Sure, I’d be in ocean jail, but at least we wouldn’t have to complicate shit when shit was already complicated.”
Tony wanted to escalate the argument, but a soft whimper kept his response limited to what he hoped was a threatening glare. He slid off the bed and padded over to Pete’s crib, relaxing his face as he looked down at the baby.
“This can’t be right. Natasha. Please tell me this isn’t right,” Tony begged hoarsely, “This isn’t possible, right?”
He had just finished up Tony’s other arm when the intercom turned on, announcing their entrance into European airspace and detailing their descent to a hospital in England.
“Fuck, I cried all over your tux. You can’t get married in a tear-stained tux,” Tony sniffled, pulling back to rub at his eyes.
The line went quiet for a moment, so Steve imagined Tony walking over to the other side of the shop to first scold Dummy, then to pick up PJ and rest him on his hip, lightly scolding him for turning his other child against him. After a minute, Steve heard rustling on the other side, but the line was still quiet otherwise.
Settling for ‘who the fuck knows’ as to their location, Tony was about to turn to sink down into his seat when a familiar whizzing sound came oddly close to the truck, and a very pointy arrowhead stared back at them, lodged into the door.
“Clean first. I want to make sure you are ready to--to take me,” he said, stumbling over his words in embarrassment, “It is important that I make sure we do this
Almost automatically, Steve’s hand found Tony’s, and he squeezed lightly; it had become sort of their ‘thing’ whenever they wanted comfort. Tony immediately turned in to hug Steve, thankful for his latest growth spurt so he could finally tuck his face into Steve’s neck without having to go up on his tiptoes. They stayed in the hug until Mr. Coulson called them all to get ready for curtain, at which Steve pulled back with a sniffle.
Tony fumbled for the call-nurse button, pressing it rapidly until he heard shoes running down the hall. When the harried nurse opened the door, he quietly asked for Steve. The nurse nodded and left, giving him mere seconds to think through what he was going to say.
Tony choked on a sob as he was pulled away, blindly reaching out to take Peter into his arms. Clint covered their back as they ran toward the infirmary and surprisingly found Bruce and Thor hurriedly packing a bag.
“Those come with us,” he told the guard, “He needs them.”
“Alright, Stark, up and at ‘em,” He grunted after a minute, forcing himself up.
“You’re right, you can be
“Hey,” Steve called, attempting what looked to Tony to be a strained smile, “How is he?”
“I cannot promise everything. You are mine and I plan to keep it that way,” Steve growled, slipping his hand under Tony’s shirt to caress his hip, “I
The end of the bed sunk down and he tensed, waiting for the blows to start. First, the furs on his feet were shuffled up, then a warm hand carefully closed around his ankle, steadying without being too tight. The hand slid down and cupped the side of his foot, and before Tony could wonder if Steve was going to attempt to literally tear him in half, a second hand cupped the other side of his foot and two thumbs pressed into the skin, slowly contra-rotating.
Tony laughed wetly and pulled back, rubbing at his eyes with one hand and seeking out Steve’s hand with the other. He waved his hand at the food and began to eat, not trusting himself to talk without crying. Halfway through the meal, he scraped his cutlery on the plate, clearing his throat lightly.
Tony grunted, but handed to phone over, writing down his answer on the cardstock. He looked over at the other two ‘wives,’ frowning when he saw them smirking at him.
“Uh-huh.”
“I do not know, but I would guess a cup of hot tea with…a garden salad,” Thor said, shrugging.
“That’s so cute,” Steve said under his breath, uncapping his thermos to take a swallow, “Oh my god, this is delicious—”
“Ow. Sort of. Not really. It’d be a long shot, and we’d probably be dino food by then,” Tony grumbled, rubbing his head, “Where’s the shield?”
And he can help. He knows--he knows a lot about Howard. You do not need to
They both knew it was a lie, but Tony practically threw himself into Steve’s arms, shaking with silent sobs. Steve shushed him softly and petted his hair, staring angrily at the door. He knew something had been up, and he didn’t say anything, and now Tony was hurt
It felt hopeless. Tony opened his eyes and sighed, leaning up from Natasha to slump against the wall. She patted his shoulder and slipped off of the bed to move Steve’s desk back into place, then paused with her hand on the doorknob as she turned to leave.
Tony narrowed his eyes.
“I thought I’d drive him myself. Get a little more personal time in before you vultures steal him away,” he tried to joke, but the hint of seriousness was there, making the others nod.
“No. That’s not how that works! You can splice
“Hey.”
Tony reached up to put both of his hands on the back of his neck, simulating rocking back-and-forth as he secretly brushed along his skin. Feeling that the faintly raised scar hadn’t been disturbed, a small sense of peace overcame him, but he kept up the attack symptoms, working through the plan in his head.
He couldn’t suppress his smile when Tony beamed, squeezing his husband’s hand to convey his solidarity. Looking at the other two men, Rhodey and Bucky nodded their approval, making it a done deal.
“Do you have any family history of disease?” Bruce asked, pushing his glasses up his nose as they made their way down to his lab.
“My friends! Come in, come in,” Thor called cheerfully, stepping out from amongst the throng of people to clap a hand onto Tony’s shoulder and usher him in, “The Prime called us all for a meeting this early hour and told us you and the fair babe would be in attendance—he says you have some important things to tell us about our walls, yes?”
“Why the hell didn’t Fury tell us that we were looking for
Tony took a breath, looking around at the Avengers and SHIELD personnel waiting for his explanation.
Tony snorted a laugh and shook his head, showing his cardstock before flicking it toward Bucky.
It was dead silent in the room. Heat blossomed onto Tony’s cheeks as he realized what he’d done, and soon after Steve burst into hearty laughter.
PJ shook his head, but he grabbed onto Steve’s hand, tugging it toward him. Steve cocked his head as PJ did it again, then blinked once the boy moved closer to Tony and tugged once more.
Natasha smirked, then turned to Thor.
“I know you can. Have patience,” Steve soothed, tightening his arm to keep Tony in place, “I want to make sure you are clean and opened up enough. I--”
“Look, Rogers—”
“So your friend group is a Prince, an heiress, and then--”
“Alright. So, what, you’re jacked up now?”
For a moment, he felt nothing.
He held his free hand out, wiggling his fingers. Steve sighed, but relented, moving to pick up and toss the keys from a small dish on a nearby table. Tony caught them out of the air, humming tunelessly as he moved to exit the cabin. Rounding the corner of the building, he sighed in relief at the sight of the car in front of him.
Steve sounded
“No, no don’t tell,” Tony begged, finally saying something, “It’ll just make it worse, you can’t tell
“Alright, alright, we’re nearly done,” Tony said quickly, giving him a few good squeezes until the milk barely dripped out of his nipple, “There. Okay? Hold on.”
“Wow. Impressive,” Tony said instead, tugging on his cuffs to make him jingle, “Think you could let me out?”
“Do not worry, my love. I did not forget about you,” he murmured, wiping away the baby’s fussy tears, “Let us see: you have been bathed, napped, fed…is it attention you desire, darling?”
“Yeah, J.”
“Gotta get the bullets out, but I can’t reach,” he explained with a grunt.
“Then I’d suggest you have your friends stay quiet,” Coulson answered simply, walking through the row of desks to return to the front of the room.
Then, as if on cue, Peter began to cry, dissolving into a loud wail faster than he ever had before. Tony immediately backed down and tried to soothe the baby, much more concerned with him than Steve’s ridiculous antics.
“Tony. Look at me,” Steve interrupted, attempting a comforting smile when worried brown eyes flickered over, “Are you sure this is what you want to do, sweetheart?”
Steve nodded and followed the team of doctors down into the hospital, sucking in a breath when they walked into Tony’s private room. He immediately went over to sit in a chair next to Tony’s bedside, scooping up his right hand to hold carefully between his own.
” Tony squeaked, pouting at Steve’s laugh, “But—I was sure—”
“Ah, you are awake! I did not know that the Southerners are nocturnal and sleep the day away,” he teased, clapping a hand on Tony’s back as he sat next to him, “How have you and the babe fared?”
“I know, my littlest love. We are okay,” Tony soothed.
“Tony?” Steve slurred, reaching a hand out toward him.
I haven’t felt the touch of a man in many moons,” he started, only to yelp when Steve pinched his inner thigh, “Hey!”
Much to Tony’s surprise, PJ nodded, rolling himself onto his belly to slide onto the floor. Tony tried to make a grab for him but cried out in pain at moving his ribs, gritting his teeth when black spots danced in his vision.
He turned to find his husband cowering up against the wall, pale and looking more nauseous by the second. He immediately wrenched the water off, crushing the handle slightly in his haste to alleviate the situation.
He waited to hear the shuffle of footsteps disappear before turning to look, seeing that Natasha and Bruce had moved to a couch and that the others had left. Sighing thankfully, Tony turned back to PJ, seeing the kid still sniffling.
With a triumphant huff, he pulled out the pants and reached into the right pocket, pulling out a small gold band. He turned to Tony and carefully picked up his left hand, a watery smile threatening to spill over as he slipped on ring onto Tony’s finger.
“Razor, razor,” he muttered to himself as he rummaged around the bathroom, opening every cabinet until he found what he wanted, “Aha! Razor.”
A soft giggle from down the hallway pulled Tony out of his depressing thoughts. He smiled to himself and pretended to not hear it as he cooled the flattened steel and his tools in preparation for the attack. No sooner had he stripped off his gloves did a small body attempt to crawl into the forge room to get to him. Tony quickly turned and nabbed the toddler, grinning at Peter’s squeals of delight as he was lifted and placed on Tony’s hip.
“Is that a knife in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?” He quipped back.
“Tony!”
“Oh, good gods. How are we supposed to get him up then?”
“Oh, my sweet little boy,” Tony tried to soothe as he pulled Peter in close, “I am here, sweet thing. Daddy did not mean to upset you, I promise.”
“Daddy?”
“It’s fitting,” Natasha answered, raising an eyebrow at the archer, “Don’t be rude. Especially when your name keeps getting written down as ‘cunt’ at Starbucks.”
“Papa? What about Papa?” Tony asked softly, inwardly hoping to avoid another awkward situation.
“No,” Tony admitted, “It’s in my head.”
“See? All better. You freaked out a bit and he could probably feel your tension from this morning, yeah? Everything is okay,” Tony said, pulling Steve in to have the Prime rest his head against his abdomen, “You did nothing wrong. I promise.”
“Ohana means family, you jerk, it’s
“He is quite sweet, you know. He always seems so happy.”
a paper-mâché moon that was also a lamp. It was fucking cute,” he grumbled, eyeing up the sleeping couple.
“Nooo,
Tony gaped for a moment, then snapped his mouth shut, glancing between Natasha and Pepper.
Tony drew a hot bath, figuring that if he liked a warm bath after a rough day, perhaps Steve did as well. As the water filled up the bathtub, he motioned to Steve, mimicking him undoing his leather skirt and then pointed at the tub. Steve seemed confused, yet once Tony reached for him, he jumped and nodded, hurriedly undressing. Tony’s body desperately wanted him to stare at the Alpha, but he fought his instincts and turned away, retrieving the soap from where he had put it earlier in the evening. Of course, his plans always seem to be interrupted, for when he turned around Steve stood there in his nudity, almost basking in the faint candlelight.
leave. You don’t sit next to me at movie nights anymore, you don’t come down to the lab to draw, hell, you’ll only spar with me if Nat forces you to,” Tony spat out.
“C’mon, James,” Natasha said coolly, unfolding herself from her chair to go put a hand on Bucky’s shoulder, “We’ve known this for months. No need to get riled up.”
Standing, Tony grunted at how his back cracked, rolling his eyes at Steve’s familiar laughter in the next room. He followed PJ out to the bedroom, smirking at Steve’s sharp breath.
“Baf…woom?” the child repeated, taking his thumb out of his mouth to wipe on his shirt.
“Okay. I will be up soon. I have almost finished my project here and I need to do the tempering before I can stop.”
He paused, a giddy laugh working into his throat.
“Don’t even think about it.”
Tony stared at him for a moment, then had to bite his lip to force down his laughter. It may not be funny to Steve, but to him it was
“It’s called a conscious, maybe you should get one,” he snapped back, too goddamn tired to deal with it for the moment, “If you’re going to make comments, you are
“What nurse Shelly reported to your earlier has been confirmed,” one of the haughtier doctors replied, motioning to the scans put up on the light-boards, “His—”
“JARVIS sent me the emergency ping, and I was already en route to the Tower, so I took a detour to save your ass,” the Colonel grunted as he put his hand on top of Tony’s, a fond glint in his eye, “How are you feeling?”
“No. It’s not exactly fun time bonanza, but it’s not work,” He answered, frowning up at the Captain, “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to find
little brothel Alpha, since you want to dress like one.”
Steve sighed and fell back onto the bed, forcing Tony to steady himself with his hands on Steve’s abdomen.
“You have been holding out on me,” he purred, loving how the shirt accentuated his small waist and showed just a hint of bosom, “You look like a
He cut himself off as the boy slowly crept toward him, snot running down his small face. PJ quickly wiped his nose and eyes on the back of his hand before reaching out, carefully placing his tiny palm against Tony’s large one. Having to internalize the loud scream of “GERMS” that threatened to crawl out of his throat, Tony merely smiled, not moving until PJ pulled his hand back.
PJ whimpered and shook his head defiantly, smacking Tony’s palm and stomping his foot.
“Sorry. It’s cute how terrible you are at this,” Tony teased, sneaking in a small kiss on the tip of Steve’s nose, “We’ll go to dinner tonight. Dress nice. I’ll have J let you know when to be ready. Oh, and remember to put the ice cream away. No need to mope anymore, right?”
“Thank you,” Tony laughed through tears, reaching up to brush them off of his cheeks, “I will try to keep that in mind. And have no worry--I would not tell on you.”
The change in topic seemed to sate Steve’s curiosity, so Tony smiled, leaning his head on Steve’s shoulder as he started to talk about
“Yes?” He answered, gently laving his tongue over the spot.
Tony finally turned his attention down to PJ once he realized the boy had stopped poking.
It was bad enough that when he went home that evening, Maria had taken one look at him and asked if Steve was okay.  He’d ignored her and went to his room—it was almost worth the beating he received later that night for being rude.
“Yeah. JARVIS, order books for PJ that are for one to two-year-olds,” Bruce said, returning to his microscope, “And perhaps mini learning tools, like paper and markers, blocks, that sort of thing.”
“You know, at one time, I thought I could have something like this.”
Tony nodded.
He quickly schooled his face when Steve glared at him, wondering if Steve had been able to read his thoughts. With a fake cough and a nod, Tony stood and scurried out to the bedroom, waiting until he had Peter upon his shoulder so he could laugh into the baby’s cheek.
“Mostly deaf, dude.”
Tony heard a door creak, and once the footfalls died away, he cracked open his eyes. His first impulse was to try and sit up, but strong hands were quickly on his shoulders and pushing him back down.
“We’ve got your back,” Bucky affirmed, stepping up to place a hand on Steve’s shoulder, “Both of you. You’re not alone in this.”
Then, there was Steve.
“Natasha, you and Sam are up first. I want a clean fight; no knives, no arrows. And this is a tap session, so you should not be bruising each other. This is supposed to be a training in recognizing openings during a fight…”
“Stop thinking, Tony,” Bruce cut through his thoughts, leveling him with a look.
Steve’s cold nose pressed into his wrist and he gasped, shivering as the Alpha started to scent him, gently nuzzling and licking at the spot. He tried to pull away, but Steve was considerably stronger and held him in place, nipping one of his fingers in retaliation.
“What… what if we left him with Thor while we went out?”
“Alright, can you sit here for just a moment, kiddo? I need to check on Papa,” Tony said seriously, eyeing Steve’s still form from the corner of his eye, “I’ll be right back, darling. Hang tight.”
“Hey, you,” he said, smiling and wiping away her stray tear as she pulled back, “Can’t get rid of me that easy, Ms. Potts.”
. Theoretically, he knew that they were a fairly peaceful people, but Howard’s voice chanted inside of his head and hands
“No. No shivering or anything. I’m pretty sure it was just snoring in a tiny body. It was actually kind of cute.”
“Are you going to keep swearing around PJ?”
Bruce waved him quiet, putting his stethoscope in as he moved the metal disk around PJ’s now exposed chest. After a minute or two, he sat back and pulled the stethoscope out of his ears, sighing softly.
PJ stood on trembling legs and threw himself into Tony’s chest, one of his tiny hands pressed against the arc reactor. Before he could fall over from the shifting weight, Steve’s hand came up to his back, holding him in place as he gently wrapped his arms around the boy. Steve easily curled himself around them both, creating a makeshift cocoon for them.
“I don’t know,” Steve admitted, “I think he’ll have to, eventually. God, he’s going to hate having to go back to therapy and through routine doctor’s visits again.”
“Good news is that there aren’t any other living subjects, like PJ,” the archer said, “We managed to find written documentation of each of the subjects they created, and the only surviving one from those documents is PJ. There were traces of electronic records, but from what we’ve seen so far, they don’t have anything to do with this piece of the project.”
“Either way, I was taken aback by the question, but Thor assured me he had a good reply. He said his piece, and then the army charged.”
“My father,” Tony answered, looking the Prime square in the eye, “The king.”
“Make Bruce meet him, then. Just…just to check it out,” he decided.
“It’s okay. I’m tough. Made of iron,” Tony soothed, quick to change the subject, “Want to sit on the bed? We can—”
“No, but you punks can use the shield.”
Stark was the team’s unofficial caretaker, and that was that. Right?
“Sad,” the boy answered, tilting his head, “Why?”
Tony nibbled on his inner cheek for a moment as he thought, managing to put his slippers back on before heading out of the room and down to the first floor.
“I do not know what she said, but I think I agree,” Rhodey said.
kid. Regardless if Rogers tries to have his cake and eat it too.”
“The only survivor in the compound,” he continued, “And the only survivor from the experiment. That is, assuming they didn’t attempt to recreate it in other facilities.”
warm…”
“Do not blame yourself. This is not your fault,” She said quietly, “I wish we could help—”
Bruce groaned and pinched the bridge of his nose, shaking his head.
“He doesn’t even like me, so how would that work?” Bucky grunted, raising an eyebrow as PJ crawled out of the bed to situate himself onto Tony’s lap.
He was running out of space to back up into. Just as he was about to hit the wall, arms came out of nowhere and picked him up, cradling him into a warm chest. Peter unlatched in the movement and began to cry again, which only caused Tony’s heart to ache more. Carefully, he held the baby as close as he could, turning his head into the warm chest to try and gather his wits. He soon realized that it was Thor who was carrying him, based on Alpha’s familiar scent. Knowing he was safe, Tony relaxed by a fraction and focused on keeping Peter safe in his hold until he could be put down.
“Not bad if I say so myself,” he declared to the mirror, running a hand over his goatee.
“To be fair, Tony’s always liked kids,” Sam pointed out from the couch, “I just didn’t think he still wanted his own genes still swimming around.”
Seeing Zola’s pixelated eyebrow quirk up, Tony narrowed his eyes.
While using one leg to keep Peter imprisoned in the tub, Tony managed to get clean and even wash his hair before he could see that the tot was beginning to creep toward an explosion. He quickly stood and helped him out of the water, then wrapped him up in a towel before he could slip away. It should have been fine, Peter had had plenty of uneventful bathtimes before, but this had to be the one time he let out an ear-splitting wail and smacked his tiny hands against Tony’s chest.
,” Steve rasped, trembling as he reached up to grab Tony’s hands and hold them, “You did, Tony, oh god, you wanted to kill yourself, you wanted to
Still fairly unimpressed, Tony huffed and looked over at Peter, only to smile at the drowsy baby. He pressed a kiss to Pete’s forehead and rubbed his back, smiling as he started to drift off.
Letting that juicy thought sit in his forebrain, Tony closed his eyes, attempting to at least try to sleep so he would be rested for the transfer. Figuring that the others had been gone awhile before he was even taken, they probably weren’t close to his location, and thus the next few hours could be vital for resting for when the inevitable breakout happened. That is, if they managed to get into wherever the hell he was to break them out.
let you fuck me again,” Tony managed to threaten, grabbing his cock by the base to stave off his release, “And I mean
“Guys,” Pepper sighed, her face in her hands, “Please, behave. Let’s give them space.”
“Alphas only turn feral when they think their Omega is in danger, Tony, and James does not know any of the Warlord Omegas,” Bruce said quietly.
Tony raised an eyebrow as he worked at the back of Steve’s suit, pulling down the top and tying it around his waist like he had done for himself. He turned Steve toward himself, expecting to see sore and possibly raw nipples, but he gasped, eyes widening in surprise. Steve’s pectorals were swollen: only slightly, so it was difficult to tell, but they were red and nearly bruised around the areolas. His nipples were swollen and dark, smeared with a semi-opaque liquid that Tony could only assume was the milk.
“Not really. We are not in any shape to go storming a castle right now and I doubt we will be ready by spring. I may send Natasha with Bucky to try and collect information on Howard’s movements, but for now, there is not much we can do,” Steve answered, “We will stay vigilant with scouting parties, and that will have to be enough.”
“Oh, are you in charge?”
“Hell if I know.”
“I can feel you thinking.”
, he thought to himself as he stripped down and hung his clothes on a tree branch. His thighs already felt sticky, so he hurried into the water and was surprised to find that it was relatively warm.
Honestly, the situation wouldn’t be that awful, but since Hulk had changed back to into Bruce, they needed to find food before the good doctor starved.
“Anywhere but here,” Tony answered with faux cheer, a smile plastered on his face.
With some finagling, he pulled Steve back against his chest, ducking under his arm so Steve’s pecs were right by his face. He kissed the swollen muscle before motioning for the thermos, unscrewing it and setting the cap aside.
“Right,” Steve confirmed, his smile finally reaching his eyes as he leaned in for another kiss, “Together.”
“Oh, it is so good to see you, Brucey bear,” he crooned, letting PJ turn around to watch the scientist come and sit at his bedside, “I thought you might’ve been doing cleanup at the base.”
and scurried out to the hallway, feeling more and more disinterested in their walk as they got closer to the infirmary. He was about to call it all off when he saw Rhodey lying in the medical bed again, but the man waved him over and held his arms out.
“And why aren’t you playing, Natasha?” Thor teased.
Tony laughed at that, grinning up at her as he knocked his shoulder into hers.
He was used to tall, looming buildings. The cityscape was his playground, and between the mansion and Father’s workplace, very tall buildings no longer made him feel afraid. However, seeing the one-floor schoolhouse and the various gaggles of other kids in front of him, Tony inched closer to his Mother’s skirt, grasping at the silky material and attempting to hide behind it.
sooner.”
“Yeah, Buck. I know. Yeah—uh, Tony’s here, I gotta go, okay?” Steve was saying, turning at Tony’s hand on his elbow, “I’ll email you once I hear more. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Buck. Bye.”
He waited for the room to clear before collapsing into a nearby chair, hand over his mouth. Staring into the distance, Tony choked back a cry, tears that had been stinging his eyes for the past few minutes now budding up and falling down his cheeks. He wiped them away with the back of his hand, pinching the bridge of his nose to force himself to take a deep breath, in and out.
Leaning up at the voice, Tony hissed as pain ripped through his side again, but quickly bottled it up when he saw the top slat of the door open.
“I can’t help it. You were practically moaning over here. Made it very difficult for me to concentrate,” he grunted, taking both of their cocks in hand with a hiss.
“Very good, Sir.”
He laughed and knocked his shoulder against Steve’s, biting his lip to keep from smiling too wide. It was no secret that he adored Steve, considering half of their class still called them Mom and Dad from how close they were, but he
Peter slipped his thumb into his mouth and started to drift off, bringing a smile to Tony’s face. He reached out to smooth down the few wisps of hair on his head, then reluctantly pulled away. The near-silence in the room was a welcome respite after an intense morning. His heart longed to go find Rhodey and comfort him, but he knew the best thing he could do for him was to stay away until he was well again. Tony rolled onto his back and bit back a whimper when he felt the pain between his legs creep back. Technically, he could take care of himself, yet the piece of him that had already grown fond of Steve wanted the Prime to come do it and comfort him.
“Of course,” he answered, “I’m not about to leave him alone again, and you pulling him away from me for less than a minute made him go berserk. I’m okay with co-sleeping for the time being. He has a pull-up on, right? It’s fine.”
“Flight mode?” Steve piped up.
He sighed and shook his head, turning in his seat to face Rhodey.
The question’s implication ran deeper than the Alpha was letting on. Sure, he worried about them, about this budding
Tony raised an eyebrow, tilting his empty tub to show Steve. He shrugged, smirking as he stuck the spoonful of ice cream into his mouth. Steve blinked at that, glancing between Tony and the empty tub.
“It was okay. M’not a theatre kid,” he admitted, glad for the conversation to keep him from thinking, “How ‘bout you?”
“Thanks,” Steve murmured, catching Clint’s wink as Fury started to go into a tirade, “But you’re going to be in trouble.”
“Oh, baby, oh honey, it’s okay, c’mon kid, wake up,” Tony begged, going to try and shake PJ out of the nightmare, “I’m right here, it’s okay, everything’s okay—”
“Later,” he whispered, hearing the faucet start, “Nat can babysit for an hour so we can…talk.”
“Shh, honey, shit, I broke you,” Tony murmured, cupping Steve’s face to keep wiping away his tears, “Honey, that was over 25 years ago, it’s over, I haven’t felt like that in a
“Just a minute,” he called, gingerly stepping into his pajamas.
“That is
“What did he say,” Tony snapped, his heart pounding in his chest at the pity that spread across Thor’s face.
“I’m not going to take it from you, jeez,” he snorted, putting up his hands defensively, “I’m going to clean up this stuff.”
Steve stood up with his next lot of items and began putting them on Tony, starting with leather bracers on his wrists before moving to drape a plain cloak on his back, clasping it around his neck. He stepped back to admire his work, but before he could approve, Peter reached up from Tony’s chest and grabbed onto the tie, tugging on it. Tony squeaked and untangled the baby’s hand, quickly taking off the cloak to hand back to Steve.
But he didn’t push.
“Please don’t inflate his ego,” Fury sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose, “Fine. Stark can keep the kid. But Romanov, I want updates. You too, Banner. If anything happens with this kid that even
“A woman after my own heart. What’s up?” He asked.
Frowning, Tony slid off the gurney, shifting uncomfortably at the ice pressed to his chest. He quickly scooped up PJ and the pajamas, holding the child tight as he followed the nurse to be returned to his six-guard entourage. Quickly, the guards fell into place around him, marching him back out of the medical wing and toward the cell he had woken up in. Before the door closed, he turned around, clearing his throat.
Tony grunted and cleared his throat to try and stop himself from sounding so wrecked.
“C’mon, I’ll show you where the bathroom is,” he said, wiggling his fingers.
“What just happened?” he whispered, reaching over with his foot to nudge Steve’s desk.
“No, the lab is too much like the compound. He might freak out and be afraid,” Natasha countered, carefully watching the boy, “I think it’s best to just let Tony hold him and wait it out.”
“I’m not.”
he thought, squinting at the child, then he recognized Captain Ameribear, and was thrown,
