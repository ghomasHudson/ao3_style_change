“John . . . thank you . . . for your assistance.”
Sherlock paused for a moment, then took a step backwards. “I see. Well then maybe for empirical evidence to determine if I am actually correct that you definitely have homosexual tendencies, you should initiate the next physical encounter.”
As soon as the doctor finished his drink, he sighed and slipped back to sleep. They had knotted repeatedly through the previous day and night. Finally collapsing exhausted on the ruin sheet around four in the morning. It had been a marathon of sex. Sherlock’s muscles were sore and fatigued from the near constant sex. He knew they still had at least two more days of coupling.
Lestrade pulled his mobile out of his pocket as he marched out of the room. “Donovan, I need you to do a search for Montague Cavendish. He died at Royal London Hospital.”
Sherlock could feel the twist in his stomach. He heard a high pitch ringing in his ears as he looked at the photo. He tried to remember the day. It had been a week, may be two, ago. They had just finished lunch and were walking back to the tube station. John refused to use taxies. They were happy and had started to talk about what would happen after John graduated. He was looking at a clinical rotation at St. Bart’s. He had let Sherlock convince him not to go into the army.
“John, he’s involved with drugs and prostitution. He’s a criminal.”
“In here.” He waved Sherlock over.
Sherlock stiffened his back and stood up straight. He shoved his hands deep into the pockets of his coat.
For now he could let the other lies he had told John remain where they were. John’s didn’t need to know the whole truth yet. He just hoped when he finally had to tell John, the blonde would forgive him.
“No, you must take time to morn. It is only right. I insist you step back and retire to your home to grieve privately.”
John crossed his arms over his chest and rocked back on his heels. “You can demand all you want but it won’t matter to me. Do you have two thousand pounds to pay me?”
“My brother is a wealthy man. He was called to the royal court by the King and Queen.”
“I knew you weren’t involved with his murder. You hated Victor, but you wouldn’t have killed him. I knew John, you aren’t a murderer.”
Frustrated, Sherlock turned and left the brothel and decide to return to ‘The Woman.’ Maybe he could induce her to tell him what he wanted to know.
“Get on with it.” John snarled.
Suddenly, Blackwood went flying out of water. He shot up like he was propelled out of a cannon. Onto the deck as the crew cheered.
Sherlock spun his head back to stare at John.
“What? Who?” John asked totally confused by Sherlock’s presence. “What are you doing here?”
John glanced around the corner and saw men slipping between the buildings and sneaking up on Blackwood and Hindi. He whistled and Blackwood glanced over at him. John pointed to where he had seen the two men. He waved two fingers and then turned his hand upside down and made the universal symbol for walking. Blackwood nodded his head and twisted around, rolling over the top of Hinde and moving to intercept the men sneaking up on them.
“And once again, you are wrong in your deductions.” Sherlock said as he leaned against John’s body. “Why are you here Mycroft?”
“Forget about it!”
“Yeah, and so are you, but the question is are you staying?”
“DAMN it all!” He shout. “McMath! The ship hard to starboard!”
John fought to reach out for Sherlock. He struggled to open his eyes so he could fight off whatever was troubling the dark-haired man.
Suddenly, the two women dressed in men’s clothing produced pistols. They pointed them at Sherlock and John.
“I doubt the cops are going to tell me who did it?” A taxi pulled over and John got into the back seat. “Brixton.” He said to the driver.
“And the aid, Norman.” Dr. Owen raised her eyebrow in an accusing manner.
The men fired once.
After twenty minutes, Sherlock seemed to relax. “How long will your knot be inflated?”
Sherlock blushed slightly and cast his eyes lower on to John’s chest. He seemed embarrass and couldn’t look the man in his eyes.
“They’re coming in!” he shouted to men. John wondered where the rest of the squad was. Did they hear the gunfire and were making their way to them? Or had they been ambushed too and were now lying dead somewhere in the small community?
“Please John.” Sherlock said again.
Moriarty smiled and took a sip of his coffee.
A wave of more people entered the small house and Sherlock recognized one of them. The slicked back hair and dark chocolate eyes.
There were two names that kept returning. Captain Underwood and Midshipman Babcock. John said Underwood was a brute. The scars across Barr’s back played that out. Underwood had repeated ordered whippings of the man. But what about Babcock? John said Underwood didn’t whip the young man. What had Underwood done?
“Sherlock, I don’t understand. Why would your brother force you to bond with someone you hate? What would that accomplish?”
“Good.” John turned back to the counter to fix the tea.
“Are you?”
Mycroft looked over at Sherlock. He could read the entire episode in Sherlock’s expression.
“I can’t be held responsible for other people’s mistakes.” Mycroft waved his hand.
They entered the morgue and got to work.
“Don’t John . . . it’s is alright . . . I would have be disappointed if you didn’t give me a hug.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John pushed Sherlock towards the broken window. Sherlock finally glanced around and realized their room was full of smoke and quickly filling with fire.
“Agreed. Finally, I promise to not bring my drug use into the flat and I will reframe from excessive use.”
The red-headed waitress brought over two mugs of coffee and two menus.
“I have to move back home with my mother. I’ll be gone for summer term. If I can’t make any money over the summer, I doubt I’ll be back next year.”
“Ah, yes . . . remember you are going out with my squad tomorrow. Sunrise. Be ready.”
“I’m sorry, Seb. Maybe we shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m afraid he will only get worse. He must be insane if he thinks he can convince me that you and Moriarty are working together.”
John slowly crawled up Sherlock’s body. Moving deliberately to keep Sherlock from becoming more frightened. John moved so he was hovering over Sherlock on the narrow bench. His left hand gripping the back of the bench while his right held up his weight over Sherlock. He looked down in the Sherlock’s blue eyes and smiled when he noticed how large the pupil had gotten.
“I don’t know.” Frankie said looking down at the gun sitting on the table.
“I don’t care what you are thankful for or what is needed for him.” Greg interrupted Mycroft. “If John was around, I would have called him. I found him and now I’m giving him back to you. Keep an eye on him this time.”
“NO!” John shouted.
He pressed the send button. His heart was still beating quickly. He felt his body slipping back into the rush he felt on patrol. He reread the message then typed a second.
John’s expression softened. He leaned forward and gave Sherlock a chaste kiss. Even more intimate given the fact they were both naked and hard in the warm bathwater. He leaned backed again and asked.
“Aren’t all of our encounters confrontational?”
“Who is Babcock?” Sherlock asked.
“British navy?” Sherlock asked.
Across the room from him, Culverton Smith watched. The short man sneered as he watched Smallwood walk away from Holmes. Smith pulled out his phone and started to text to the number he had been given.
The crew of the Speckled Band was now trapped between the men of the British naval ship and John’s crew. It didn’t take long to overtake them. John and Sherlock crossed over onto the British ship.
“Well, neither did I. So now we need to figure out who did.”
James grabbed Sherlock’s elbow and pulled him from John’s cabin. He shoved the young man out the door and onto the deck.
The only troubling thing was the newspaper clipping that he picked up next. It was a story about a fire at the dance club ‘The Enclave’. It had burned down two days after Moriarty had been killed. The owner of the club, Frankie Oskar, was found dead inside the building. Burned beyond recognition. The man’s DNA was not on record anywhere and his fingerprints had been obliterated in the fire. His identification was based on eyewitnesses that said they saw him enter the building alone and not leave before the fire.
Lestrade stared at Sherlock for a moment then shouted. “Donavan!”
Greg took another sip of beer. He was completely stuck on the art theft. He had no leads and no possibility of solving the case until he got one. If Sherlock could tweeze out one single thread, then maybe – just maybe, he could solve the crime and get to move on to harder more intriguing cases.
It began in earnest. John struggled and Sherlock held him tight. The doctor was constantly informing them how far they had come but also how far they needed to go. Sherlock watched as John concentrated on his body and his child. John’s single focus on bring another life into the world. The determination of the soldier reemerged from John. His willingness to endure the pain over and over again brought Sherlock to tears.
“Hell of a call for the motor club.” Moran said as he smiled at the three men.
John pushed those thoughts away. He couldn’t think of Sherlock and Mary in the same way. ‘
Sherlock howled as he came across the bedding. His body rhythmically milking John’s cock. John collapsed on top of the man, panting as he slowly came back to himself. His heart pounding in his chest. His vision greyed at the edges.
“You’re a bastard Watson.” Lestrade hissed.
The man’s knuckles were bruised and there was a smear of blood or some other dark stain on his coat sleeve. Ryan seemed to be twitchy, and nervous, but John didn’t worry about that. It was normal for patients to be scared in the A and E.
“I don’t understand you, Sherlock.” Greg said.
Sherlock’s thin lips pulled back and John saw an honest smile. A real smile on the man’s face. It made his heart actually skip a beat. He hadn’t wanted anyone as much as he wanted the man standing before him.
“We must work faster to discover Moriarty’s plan and location. He can’t be allowed to threaten John again. Not like last time.” Sherlock said as he finally turned back and looked at his brother.
“First thing first.” He said to his reflection.
“I’m afraid I don’t know, father.”
John took a moment and read the English offer. Then he read the Spanish translation.
Sherlock stared at the young man for moment then a smug smiled came to his lips. “I noticed you didn’t deny the accusation John. Is it because you know I was right?”
It was seemed so inadequately but James was willing to take it. Anything to be with John.
“What will you do with it?” Mycroft asked. His voice losing some of its vigor.
John stood at the nurse’s station as he quickly wrote up his notes in Sherlock’s file. He handed the file back to Trudy who handed him another file for another patient.
The envelope was thick. It appeared that Mycroft’s sniffer dogs had been thorough. Inside might be the information about the unusual alpha that Sherlock wanted. But there might be a report stating John was already bonded. Or a photograph of John with a pack of blond pups.
The shorter man hissed. “Why weren’t we informed. What am I paying those idiots for if they don’t warn us of raids!”
“I believe both of us.” Mycroft glanced away from his brother.
Sherlock smiled. He quickly took the photo back from John. “I need to make a phone call.”
Mycroft stared for a moment at John, then tapped his umbrella tip on the floor. It made a muted thrumming sound but was loud enough for the driver to hear. He pulled the car over to the kerb and unlocked the doors. John didn’t say anything as he got out. He stood staring at the saloon as it drove away, then he turned to look where he was. It was right in front of his building with his flat. Mycroft’s message was quite clear. He knew exactly where John lived and if John didn’t do as he wanted, Mycroft would visit him again.
Suddenly the front window of the building busted out as a chair was thrown through it. A body flung itself through the open window and rolled across the porch. Rolling away from the fire and out across the lawn.
Hindi quickly translated to the older man and the elder nodded his head again. The silence that had filled the room was quickly pushed out as the people inside heard what John had said and what was translated to the elder. The quiet conversations between various spectators of the soldier’s compassion and care to the child.
“Or was because it was obviously Moriarty!” Sherlock shouted.
The phone remained silent for a few more minutes.
His palm gripped the handle of his cane tightly as John limped down the hall and to the nurses’ station. He grabbed the first chart in the rack of cases.
“You’re clean. You don’t do drugs. There is nothing you need to worry about, John.” Sherlock smirked. “The Metropolitan is opening up their ‘Black Museum’ for a limited time. Let’s go tonight.”
“But friends of yours haven’t been.” Greg continued. “Albert Hanson was in your gang wasn’t he?”
John slammed his mug of tea down on the desk top. ‘
Sherlock’s silver eyes darted up to meet John’s. John suddenly saw something close to avaricious in Sherlock’s expression. It actually made John’s prick twitch. John suddenly felt more exposed than just being naked. Something about Sherlock’s scrutinizing gaze that made the man feel like his very soul was on display.
“I . . . I don’t know what you are talking about . . .”
The sniper rifle sat on the table with its tripod. Moran sat silently in the dark waiting for the order to come through the microphone in his ear. He could hear Moriarty typing on his computer. Jim was communicating with Chinese woman. She was trying to explain why she had allowed the smuggling ring to be discovered by the omega.
“Yes. The scent gland is the only location of the vinculumatin and the ‘heat’ pheromone production. An omega will produce vinculumatin until menopause, but it is only released by manual manipulation of the scent gland.” John said remembering the text of his omega biology books.
“Every omega needs an alpha. How else will you fulfill your existence? No omega is happy until they are bonded, bedded and pregnant.”
John almost laughed then realized what Sherlock had said. “How did you see the test?”
“Of course I can,” Sherlock snarled.
“Why? We are supposed to meet the ‘General’ after the performance.” James said as he leaned closer to John to whisper.
“It looks like you.” John said.
“Well, they should let you do more. I’m sure you could figure it out quickly.” John winked at the young man. Inside, John growled. If this idiot had been in his unit, he would have beaten the crap out of him for letting so much slip.
John sighed and smiled. “Thank you. I won’t be long.”
“I’ve already ordered it. We are also pulling the video from the CCTV cameras of this hospital.” Greg said.
A gasp escaped the omega’s lips as his fingertips caressed over the head of his cock. Sherlock leaned back against the cool tile and began in earnest to stroke himself while he imagined John doing the same.
Sherlock was supposed to meet Wiggins in town tonight. Wiggins had acquired a sample of Cannabis sativa that had unusual properties. Sherlock needed the sample for his experiments on pharmacology.
He nuzzled closer to the scent. The pillow he was on was harder than he remembered owning, but it was covered in a soft cotton case that seemed to be the source of the wonderful smell. He sighed and took another breath.
“And where is Pennybank Home located?”
“Such work can be . . . wearisome. Especially if you’ve been on your knees scrubbing the decks. I’m sure your shoulders must be sore.”
“Me? Of course! I’ve always been honest with you.”
Sherlock let a small smile skim over his face briefly. “What I’m trying to say is I wasn’t upset that you kissed me. I’m just sorry I didn’t get to kiss you back – or you didn’t stay to see what might happen next.”
John pursed his lips out dismissively, and rolled his eyes. “Coincidence, I guess.”
Moran knew who had attacked him the day before. He recognized the men who had robbed the armored car months earlier. Sean McMillan now lay on the floor of his garage. His body pocked marked with acid burns. Moran questioned him and when he didn’t answer quickly enough, Moran poured more acid onto him.
Sherlock looked at the photo. The driver was not visible but the passenger was. He was an older man with his face partially turned towards the camera. A three-quarter view. He was auburn haired and the burns on the left side of his face were barely visible. Sherlock knew the face. He had seen it in the tunnel the night he had rescued John and his friend from the Black Lotus.
“John is not involved in this.” Sherlock interrupted Greg.
Sherlock shifted and checked the position of the rope around his body and under his hips. He leaned back until he felt secure and then let go with his hands. He hung there in the loops of rope beside John.
John has never had any interest in kissing a bloke, but his desire is undeniable at this moment. Right now he wants nothing more than to feel the texture of Sherlock’s lips against his own again.
“Mmmmmm,” Is all Sherlock articulates in response.
“I’m not sure that will be necessary, but I suppose it couldn’t hurt.”
“Oh, really?” John raises his eyebrow and chuckles, “Just a minor detail?”
“Probably shouldn’t,” John responds, but kisses him again anyway.
“That’s quite long enough.”
“John, I’m hardly addicted to Methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Have you tried it?”
“Don’t be surprised, Molly. Ecstasy increases your urge to show physical affection,” Sherlock smiles sheepishly, “Also, you’re one of my best friends, so there’s that,” He kisses her forehead. Molly blushes.
John hesitates, then disrobes before quickly sliding into the empty space between Molly and Greg.
The door slams in Mycroft’s face, but Instead of walking back to the sofa, Sherlock heads directly toward the bathroom and starts the shower, quickly closing the door behind him.
John moves his hands to Sherlock’s waist, his hips, then around to lightly rub his fingers over his cock and balls. Sherlock shudders and breaks their kiss. He brings his own hands to John’s hips before speaking, “John?”
April 19th, 1994
It’s like you’re all of a sudden the only person in the world.”
“Yes, quite sure. Can you come? He’s asked for you.”
“I….” Sherlock hesitates, “I guess I didn’t feel like partaking in festivities.”
“Ever think of trying meditation instead?”
“Honestly, John, not sure. I’ve just drunk a Coke. We’ll check my blood sugar levels in a few.”
“Nervous," Molly smiles. "How about you?”
“Her name’s Harry, short for Harriet. She’s in New Zealand with her girlfriend. Clara’s from there.”
“You know, if I were capable of embarrassment, I’d be mortified by the frequency at which you’ve taken care of me lately.”
------------------------------------------------------------------
“Okay,” John says neutrally, “You know you don’t have to pretend if you do, no judgement here.”
Sherlock looms over him, “No, earlier in the evening. You didn't even go out with the others?”
“It is!” he insists. “It’s full of double entendre and cynicism. And the rhythm's quite hypnotic, isn’t it?”
“Hmmm,” Sherlock responds as he ducks down to nuzzle under John’s chin, wrapping his arms around his friend’s damp chest and back. John registers the now-familiar scent of Sherlock’s hair as he drifts off to sleep.
“Right.”
Readers of Melody Maker, after just two singles, voted Velvet Britain’s brightest hope, ranking them third among live acts and sixth in voting for best band.
“So, you and Molly seem to be having fun together, eh?” John winks.
John freezes and stares up at Sherlock.
He gets up to turn off the light, then lies back in bed wondering if he’ll be able to sleep at all.
“Everything’s gorgeous to look at right now, isn’t it? I hope I’ll never see anything the same way again. D’you know what I mean?”
Sherlock painstakingly makes his way to lie face-down on the sofa, and John awkwardly gets on his knees between his spread legs to have access to his back before squeezing the shiny liquid in the unmarked bottle into his palms. He rubs his hands together.
“Actually, I’ve just given Sherlock something to help ease his withdrawal symptoms. Alcohol is certainly not a good idea, and neither is being alone in a warm bath.”
, rocketed to the top of the independent single charts in Britain last month.
Sherlock sits down in front of John on the sofa, leaning back into John’s chest. John brings one hand up to Sherlock’s chest, the other tentatively around his throbbing cock. Sherlock presses his back into John’s chest while John begins to gently stroke. He looks over his shoulder at John who kisses him sloppily in response, lapping at his tongue distractedly. John begins to pump Sherlock’s cock in earnest, and soon, Sherlock, unable to focus, breaks the kiss and lets his head fall back onto John’s shoulder. John leans in to suck on Sherlock’s neck, breathing heavily into his ear.
“We’re escaping through drugs right now,” Sherlock smiles.
The other man’s eyes flutter, and Sherlock watches him for a moment before John blinks his eyes open and rubs his face, “Mmmm? Wha'ssit? ”
“It’s fine.”
“Mmmm. It would seem so,” John looks up at Sherlock’s lips, then to his eyes. He reaches up and touches the full pout lightly with his fingertips, stroking down from his sharp cupid’s bow, over the damp slit, stopping on the plump lower lip.
Jim shoots Anderson a scathing look, but the other man either doesn’t notice or doesn’t care.
“Charming,” John deadpans, but he can’t quite help the way his lips quirk up in a smile at Sherlock’s meticulous – and frankly morbid – planning. It’s just so
John collapses on top of Sherlock, his muscles failing to hold him up any longer, spent and languid, he nuzzles his face into Sherlock’s neck. He feels sated, completely blissed out, like the world could end right this second and he doesn’t think he’d care, so high on endorphins not even the apocalypse could make him come down. Sherlock is still holding onto him, legs and fingers twined together and in no hurry to let go.
“I can't get these memories out of my mind
Something dark and angry coils up in John’s belly and his grip tightens around his wand, heartrate growing faster as he considers which spell to use. He’s got a few hexes he’s been working on, ones he shouldn’t be learning until next year in Defense Against the Dark Arts, ones that might do more than sting a little, but he also doesn’t want to risk detention and getting kicked off the Gryffindor team.
. A small giggle makes it past John’s lips and he’s not quite sure if it’s because of how put off Sherlock looks about some stranger in a bar not taking seriously his knowledge of tobacco ash, or the absolutely incredulous way his own mind is playing him tonight.
“No, I…” he thinks of what to say, how to reassure Sherlock. “I don’t want to marry her.” Oh god. He really said that. But the words bring with them a crushing surge of relief, because… they’re true. He’s grateful to Mary for bringing him some form of happiness while he thought he’d lost Sherlock forever, but now that he’s back… There’s no competition really. It’s always been Sherlock. Hell, he’s standing outside a gay bar, snogging his best friend on a night he’s supposed to be celebrating his upcoming union to someone else. It’s pretty god damn obvious it’s not Mary he wants to marry.
of being buried inside Sherlock and never wanting this to end.
He can’t help his lips splitting into a wide smile, doesn’t remember a time he was every this happy. Hell, he didn’t know it was even
He is so unbelievably screwed. He’s out here, on his stag night, preparing to get married to someone else and his body is decidedly betraying him, solely focused on his best friend. Fantastic.
Mary. He’s marrying Mary, he reminds himself. It must be her he wants.
, how is he supposed to survive this?
When John’s brain comes back online he surges for Sherlock, meeting his lips in a possessive kiss, taking and taking everything Sherlock is willing to give, pulling him down with him until both of them hit the mattress, John on his back and Sherlock kneeling over him, a tangle of limbs as they make their way up the bed. “
“Alright, fine,” Greg says from behind him, half shouting as he gets swallowed up by a crowd of students exiting their classes and flooding the corridor, and John grins because he knows he’s won for now. “But don’t think you’re getting off so easily, I’ll get it out of you eventually, Watson.” Yeah, he probably will, but definitely not today. Today he’s meeting Sherlock.
What you mean”
, how is it possible to feel this
When Sherlock stays silent, John realizes he’s going to have to work harder than that to get it out of him. “Were you making eyes at those men in the bar?” Best to put it bluntly, he thinks.
– Sherlock actually knows his name? Knows
and then his hips are pulling away, and back in again. He sets up a painstakingly slow rhythm that has them both gasping and groaning, foreheads brushing together, eyes screwed shut as exquisite shared pleasure rushes through them both. John can feel Sherlock’s hard length against his stomach on every thrust as he angles his lower body forward and god,
Before John gets the chance to ask how he’s supposed to distract a dog long enough for him to get in, Sherlock has already turned away and is heading towards the back entrance, leaving John to his task. Bugger.
The last thing he needs is to have to call Lestrade to bail them out of jail.
“I’d like to experiment with that, next time,” Sherlock declares, and John’s brain short circuits for a second and a half because – did Sherlock just say
“What about not being gay?”
Attending classes is dull and pointless. Sherlock never learns anything he doesn’t already know, and he’s convinced his professors are well aware of that, too. He’s doing sixth year assignments in most of his classes because he’d be bored out of his mind if he stuck to the normal fifth year curriculum like the rest of his classmates. Not that he isn’t bored. He is. Almost constantly.
Sherlock is the one to save face. “Yes, John insisted on honoring this type of marriage tradition, and I agreed to come with him, though I would have preferred to skip this excuse to get drunk. Hence why we’ve grown used to calling it
Only recently there’s one thing that’s managed to pique his interest consistently, one thing he doesn’t really understand, that keeps him up at night, a mystery he hasn’t been able to solve yet.
John feels the fight and anger drain out of him. He’s not even sure what Sherlock is asking. Does John have a problem with Sherlock being gay? No, he definitely doesn’t care about that, certainly not in the sense that it should be defined as a ‘problem’, in fact, he’s always suspected that Sherlock leaned that way in terms of romantic interest – if he had any. What he does have a problem with, is that Sherlock was apparently interested in
John looks up from where his eyes had been rooted to the floor and he catches Sherlock’s gaze. What he sees there has his heart stuttering within his chest, his breath catching. He doesn’t recognize the feeling, doesn’t know if he should characterize it as something closer to panic or excitement. All he knows is that his heart feels like it could spontaneously combust at any moment, and by now, he’s sobered up enough he doesn’t even think he can blame any of this on the alcohol they drank over the course of the evening.
“I didn’t take you for a Quidditch buff,” John comments, perplexed, because how else would Sherlock know anything about John’s scoring average compared to other teams’?
“It wasn’t them I’m interested in,” Sherlock huffs out, sounding annoyed that he’s had to spell it out for John, but this only serves to confuse John further. Why would anyone signal their interest for someone in a bar if they weren’t interested in them at all? Unless, of course, it was to make someone else jealous, but John wasn’t-
“You nervous about the O.W.Ls?” John asks as he adds powdered moonstone to his cauldron, pulling Sherlock out of his thoughts.
John struggles to keep up, apologizes around half a dozen times to the men he has to push past to keep Sherlock in his sights. When he finally makes it past the door, John looks around and finds Sherlock still walking away from the bar, apparently not waiting for him and John feels his temper rise, indignation and confusion getting the better of him. He picks up his pace, jogging until he catches up to Sherlock and reaches out to grab his arm, tugging him back by the material of his coat. “Where the bloody hell are you going?” he demands, breathing hard from chasing after Sherlock and the emotions welling up inside him.
“As it happens, I have something for you as well,” Sherlock says, titling his head towards the large, decorated Christmas tree near the fireplace and John notices a fairly thin, but long rectangular sized box under it. John looks up at him in surprise. He truly hadn’t expected Sherlock to get him anything.
John let’s his lips ghost over Sherlock’s, just barely touching, sharing the same air, and lays the smallest of kisses to Sherlock’s mouth, slow and reverent. Last time he dove in headfirst, propelled forward by the brutal intensity of his body’s desire, but he takes his time now. He can’t remember the last time he’s ever kissed someone and felt the way he does now, and Sherlock deserves to know that, deserves to feel it in the way John touches him. John feels Sherlock shiver, and it encourages him to keep going, to follow his instincts and slow things down to reassure Sherlock. He should probably be using words to explain, but he’s overwhelmed by the enormity of what he feels right now, doesn’t know how any language could even come close to accurately describing what’s boiling inside him. John tilts his head to the side for better access and kisses Sherlock again, tantalizingly slow, worshipping his mouth. Sherlock kisses him back, his mouth moving under John with what feels like an equal amount of passion and sheer want, but he pulls away again after mere seconds. Sherlock’s eyes are still closed when John opens his to look at him, and his face looks pained.
“Tell me to piss off,” he says bluntly, and John laughs
“No one even likes you,” Anderson spits, as they both look up at a helpless Sherlock Holmes. “Been here five years and you haven’t even managed to make a single friend.”
John can’t keep the amazement off his face. “How did you even have
But somehow, tonight, with alcohol flowing smoothly between them, both pleasantly buzzed, it seems his mind – or perhaps it’s rather his treacherous body he should blame – doesn’t think it’s fine at all. It’s just a little bit unfair.
“Christ, remind me never to take you to a gay bar again,” John swears. He’s all too aware of how jealous he sounds but he couldn’t be arsed to care. Instead of facing this other bloke to try and drive him away, John decides they should just make a run for it. “Come on,” he doesn’t give Sherlock the chance to object, just grabs his hand, threads their fingers together and pulls him off his stool towards the dance floor.
“Hello,” Sherlock nods back at him and John thinks he sees a smile at the corner of his mouth, but that may just be wishful thinking. God, he’s a rightful mess. “I was thinking we could try our hand at brewing a Strengthening Solution,” Sherlock suggests. “It’s likely the next thing on Snapes curriculum and I’ve estimated there’s an eighty seven percent chance of this being part of our Potions O.W.L. examinations.”
whether or not John is an idiot – that’s new.
“I’ll call it off,” he promises, his left hand moving up to cup Sherlock’s cheek. “Just…” There’s really only one thing he wants, one thing he thought he’d never get to ask. “Take me home?”
“I did.”
Even in his wildest fantasies, John doesn’t think he’s ever let himself believe Sherlock would be so… enthusiastic.  He never imagined Sherlock would be so willing, so fervent. But there’s no mistaking his eagerness now and John is not about to complain. If anything, it makes him want Sherlock more, if that’s even possible.
“Good. Hagrid’s would be the first place I’d look for the Griffin claw, he’s bound to have some lying around his hut, we can worry about powdering it after we’ve acquired it.”
about that?
“You so have,” Greg insists. “It’s fine though, I’m pretty sure he likes you too.”
John smiles and turns away, as they both head to different classes in opposing parts of the castle. The tension in his body slowly ebbs away as John turns the corner and Sherlock recalls a lesson Mycroft has often repeated over the years, namely that sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side. Abiding by those rules has never been an issue for him in the past, but Sherlock suddenly realizes – given his own reactions and despite Mycroft’s many warnings – that he’s most probably doomed to develop sentiments for John Watson.
, he’s becoming acutely aware of how his body is reacting to the sensory overload of Sherlock’s touch and smell as the beginning of an erection starts to grow in his pants. Thank god the bar stools are high enough for Sherlock not to notice his bodily reaction.
Sherlock doesn’t seem to notice though, and John is grateful that he’s as oblivious as ever to anyone coming onto him. He isn’t jealous, he assures himself. He just… wants Sherlock to himself on his stag night. They are out celebrating together, and he doesn’t want strangers intruding, it has nothing to do with jealousy.
What did he ever do to deserve this?
“I’ve noticed you like wearing jumpers, mostly because they are soft and comfortable, so I made sure it was made from the softest fabric available.” John continues to stare at him, his fingers wrapped around the smoothest material he’s ever felt in his life and something powerful grows in his chest, a force that seems to take over his entire body, involuntarily controlling his limbs, and before he even knows what he’s doing, John pushes up on his knees and breaches the distance between them. He’s still holding on to his new sweater in one hand when his arms wrap around Sherlock’s neck. They’re close, closer than they’ve ever been and when John see’s Sherlock’s eyes widen, he pauses, giving him a few seconds to respond, to pull away if this isn’t what he wants, their faces mere inches apart. Sherlock doesn’t move, his spine straight and John starts to think he’s made a mistake before he feels long, tentative fingers catch in the material of his sleep shirt at his back, pulling him in even closer.
Bloody hell,
been pining,” John counters, because that definitely makes him sound like an idiot. God, he really hopes Sherlock hasn’t noticed.
John turns to him, confused. “You’re staying, too?”
They aren’t friends. Sherlock doesn’t have friends, Donovan and Anderson had been right about that. Why would he when the rest of the student population here were idiots anyway? He doesn’t bother with friends or with anyone else. All he’s been focused on is passing his O.W.Ls and N.E.W.Ts so he could finally do something less tedious and take up work as a Consulting Auror.
“I should warn you, it takes several days to brew… We’ll need to meet up again a few times this week to check on them.”
“Oh please, modesty is overrated. You’ve scored more points than any other player on every house team this year. Gryffindor wouldn’t stand a chance at the finals if it weren’t for you.” How does he even know that?
Fuck, no one has ever made his name sound so filthy.
“Right,” Sherlock says, looking John up and down, taking in his practice uniform and John has to consciously resist the urge to squirm under his assessing gaze. Why does he suddenly feel so nervous? “John Watson, star Chaser of the Gryffindor team,” Sherlock says, almost curiously, like he’s trying to figure him out but coming up short.
“I came down with enteric fever before I was transported to Germany. I was pretty out of it with fever and delirium for several weeks.”

“You haven’t a choice, brother. I am your pack alpha and I have agreed to this union.” Mycroft forced himself to look at his frantic brother.
“Don’t be so predictable, Greg. John, shall we continue?”
“Well, fine. But Sherlock, you’ll need to stay in hospital for a few days. You’re going to experience some nasty withdrawal symptoms.”
He presses his head into Sherlock’s chest. His cotton t-shirt feels luxurious, though not as luxurious as his hair. He reaches up to stroke the silk-like texture again.
John sighs. “I think that’s called emotional blackmail.”
That evening, John adds the finishing touches to the mash as Mrs Hudson enters the flat.
“Sherlock,” John looks serious and determined, “This doesn’t change that I’m not coming to America.”
“Yes, besides getting drugged by that bastard. Anyway, does he really hate you that much to… try to kill you or whatever he was thinking?”
Sherlock raises his eyebrows and concedes a smile, “Touché. But
“Oh, really? Well, that plan went a bit pear-shaped, didn’t it?”
"So, John Watson, what makes you
John brings his hands up to Sherlock’s lean chest, letting his fingertips gently stroke up and down before he flings off Sherlock’s shirt in one resolute motion. Sherlock groans and brings his hand to the back of John’s neck, pulling him back in for a kiss.
"Hmmm?"
“Goodnight.”
“God. Shut up.
“It seems as though I’m experiencing some mild withdrawal symptoms,” Sherlock sighs.
“Harry? I thought you two didn’t get on?”
A Better Place to Play
“This is brilliant!” Exclaims John.
haven’t deleted that? I’m surprised.”
What’s sure is Britain's favourite frontman is having a great time and putting on one hell of a show all over Europe!
John holds Sherlock’s hand over the sink and rinses off the traces of blood, gently opening the cut just to make sure there are no shards of glass or debris. Sherlock watches him intently as he works, eyes narrowed. When he sees that the wound is clean, he pours some rubbing alcohol over it.
“Yeah, sounds good.”
Before he loses his gumption, John presses his lips softly to Sherlock's, testing the waters.
“So, you think I’ll begin experiencing some withdrawal symptoms tonight?” Sherlock inquires.
John clears his throat and asks, “So what have you been up to?”
Back at the hotel, Ricky and Sherlock are holed up in Ricky’s room, while Greg, Molly, Anderson, and John are sipping whiskey in Molly’s room.
“Ahhh!” Sherlock hisses, jerking his hand away.
“Because of his drug problem?”
“I’m not sure if it’s something I can articulate. I just always feel like I have to do the right thing. Probably something about being the oldest child complex, but I’m no psychoanalyst.”
“You have massage oil?”
Sherlock smiles and lowers himself down a bit, face inches from John’s. “Too much?” He asks.
John is in a quiet mood and has spent most of the evening on the sofa talking to Molly, whose excitement about going to the States can’t be tamed. He gets up to stretch his legs and walks over to the fridge to get another beer.
"Goodnight, John."
“Now, I’m going to go make us some tea and grab a book and I’ll be right back. Try not to fall asleep while I’m gone.”
“Of course. You explained everything clearly to me. You were brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. It was obvious that he was murdered.”
Sherlock went the address Raz had given him. It was a deteriorating row house with a broken gate and bare garden. The windows were broken and cardboard covered the smudged dirty glass. The door was standing open. No one was around. It looked more like a heroine den than anything else. The idea his omega could be inside a place like this twisted inside the tall alpha.
“Well that is debatable. Maybe Seb going to kill you, maybe he wasn’t. But the murder of Jeff Hope is a different matter. Shooting that poor cabbie through the window. How can you claim that was self-defense?!” Jim stepped closer.
“No. I did have to call in a few favors and remind certain Members of Parliament the significance of my, although minor, assistance to the county.” Mycroft gave a knowing smile if not fleeting. “Very little will have changed in regards to my position within her Majesty’s government.” Mycroft continued with the half-truth. Once he had regained his control of the government, he would quickly repay those who had turned against him in the past few days with swift and vicious retribution.
Greg decided to consider it all sour grapes by Mycroft’s business rivals. He was more successful than they were so they started searching out and making up stories claiming Mycroft was dirty. Simple professional jealousy.
John thought he recognized the voice. He stopped walking and glanced around. The car was parked beside the curb and a man was standing beside it. He had opened the back door and seemed to waiting for John to get in.
“Well, I don’t know about that,” John counters, but Sherlock cuts him off before he can say anything more.
jealous. And he was being so bloody obvious that Sherlock caught onto that, and he’d apparently gone out of his way to attract other men to him to continue to fan the flames of John’s jealousy. He purposefully set out to make John jealous.
John’s fingers stretch down until he reaches Sherlock’s hole, never breaking eye contact with Sherlock as he pushes a single finger gently inside him, his abdomen contracting with heavy want, the remainder of his blood rushing south and sucking all the air from his lungs. John moves the single digit in and out, slowly, patiently, and he watches Sherlock’s every move, drinking in his every reaction. The way his jaw is clenched tight, his head rolling back against the pillow and when John adds a second finger, Sherlock’s hand shoots forward to grip John’s wrist, the arm holding onto Sherlock’s waist. His grip is tight, like he’s on the verge of losing control and
were pouring extra shots into the graduated cylinders,” Sherlock accuses with a raised eyebrow, daring John to contradict him. It takes John by surprise, but the feeling only lasts a second because really, he’s never been able to hide much from Sherlock Holmes.
“Thanks again,” John says, turning back to him once Snape is out of earshot. “For the tip about stirring counter-clockwise. I owe you one.”

“Gladly,” John agrees and captures Sherlock’s mouth with his.
He drops his arms from around Sherlock’s waist when he deems them close enough to the bar’s exit and sufficiently far enough from the impeding danger of a bar fight. “Stand up straight,” John tells him when he sees Sherlock canting forwards a bit.
He doesn’t.
also be distracted by the fact that the fifth year Ravenclaws have Potions scheduled at the same time they do.
He’s scared of losing Sherlock, of being forced to give him up now that he knows with utmost certainty what he wants.
(See the end of the chapter for
to do with his hands, he just knows he’d probably get them both arrested for public indecency if he let them do as they’d please.
“I think we blazed past the sweet spot three pubs ago, Sherlock,” John counters
But Sherlock reels him back, tugging John towards him and wastes no time before capturing his mouth in a kiss. John sighs, relief coursing through him, and he thinks it has less to do with the horrifyingly long cab ride here, and more to do with the fact that he’s waited over four years for this. John is man enough to admit it to himself – now that it’s safe and he knows with undeniable certainty that his feelings are reciprocated – that he’s wanted this for an abnormally long time. Maybe even since the moment they met, since their dinner at Angelo’s.
“What changed just now?” Sherlock asks curiously.
God, his heart is going a mile a minute, his legs feel like they might not support him when they finally do make it to their destination and his head seems to be spinning a little, which he knows has nothing to do with liquor. No, this is all Sherlock.
“Can’t,” Sherlock shakes his head at him, looking left and right across the street, a confused look crossing his features as though trying to remember where they are exactly. “Still got one more place to go,” he insists.
him. Going through with the wedding would have been a mistake, he knows this now. At least now he gets to make things right before he makes a vow he’s bound to break.
“Yes,” he agrees and then moves to the side, leaving John cold, missing Sherlock’s warmth, but then he sees him reaching over to his nightstand, opening the drawer and pulling out a small bottle.
“Did you get it?” John asks, mostly to distract himself from how incredibly close Sherlock is and hopefully keep his body from reacting in an embarrassing way. It turns out that was a major miscalculation though, because Sherlock shifts to lock eyes with him at the question, their faces mere inches apart and then he smiles so bright, John feels like something inside him is melting, like he’d do anything to see that smile every single day. Mostly, he’s thinking about how he wants to catch that smile with his own, to taste the happiness and the thrill of the moment on Sherlock’s lips.
“Nah, staying here,” John answers, not bothering to bore him with the details. Greg would probably be sympathetic, he’s always been a good friend to John, but for some reason, he just can’t bring himself to say it and Greg doesn’t ask.
“I didn’t realize you two were together,” the blonde lad comments with a touch of resentment in his voice but he quickly puts on a bright smile to brush it off.
John feels his cheeks flush in embarrassment. Was he really being that obvious?
“How did you even get the ingredients to make this on your own?” John questions and Sherlock grins at the memory because it was quite exhilarating.
On Christmas morning, John wakes up to the sound of repetitive tapping. He forces his eyes to open and looks around the room for the source of the sound until his eyes land on the window by his bed and he sees what looks like a note knocking on the glass over and over, spellbound and trying to get in. John grins despite having been woken up. This isn’t the first time Sherlock has sent him a message this way. He reaches over to open the window and the paper flies in, hitting him square in the chest. John breaks the wax seal and opens it, instantly recognizing Sherlock’s distinctively scribbly penmanship.
Normally, that shouldn’t phase him, he’s had double Potions with both Slytherins and Hufflepuffs before in previous years. It’s just that he can’t seem to stop himself from paying too much attention to a certain curly-haired boy who keeps to himself at the back of the class. It’s ridiculous, really.
right now?
hitting on you. I was trying to be subtle about it, but you saw right through me. Course, back then, I had no idea what you’d come to mean to me. You’d already turned me down once, and I didn’t want to risk losing you as a friend, so I tried to shut it all off, to tell myself I didn’t want you that way. And I shut down anyone else who tried to imply that we were anything other than friends because I couldn’t handle them pointing to what I thought I couldn’t have, what I thought you didn’t want. It was a protective mechanism, Sherlock. A shitty one, I’ll give you that, but I… I didn’t mean it.” John exhales a long breath, his shoulders feeling lighter now that he’s freed the words from his chest. He waits for Sherlock to speak, feeling vulnerable and bare, but filled with hope.
Greg quickly patted Sherlock down. Sherlock was cold. His skin felt like ice. Greg checked to see if there really was a pulse or if he had just fooled himself. There was a pulse, but it was weak and irregular. Greg took off his coat and laid it over Sherlock’s still body. He wondered if he should try and find John. He wondered how John could let Sherlock do this to himself. The last time Greg had seen the two of the together, they were happy. John was taking good care of Sherlock. He wondered what had happened.
“Sherlock, you are clean and sober because you chose to be. Not because of John Watson or the threats I’ve made. Because you chose to be! You’re sobriety does not depend on anyone but you. All the more reason to send John away. He is a crutch to you. He prevents you from seeing who you are and what you can accomplish. Now . . . I have told you the situation. You can make your own informed decision. Either send him away or let him stay and possible be shot. I’ve heard there is an ex-army sniper available for hire. A former colonel believe it or not. Now leave, I am busy.”
Sherlock was sitting at the kitchen table with John Watson and James Sholto. Before him was a large coffee mug full of something that didn’t look like coffee.
The omega growled and reached up and slipped his fingers into Sherlock’s curls. The black strands were as soft as John always imagined they would be. He pulled Sherlock down to his lips and kissed again. This time Sherlock seemed to let his control slip. He pushed harder and opened his mouth to suck in John’s lower lip. Sherlock’s hands reached up and wrapped around the smaller man’s body. He pulled John closer to his body and hummed in pleasure.
John refused to look up at his alpha. Moriarty nudged him with the barrel of the gun.
“Are you sure, Lord Holmes?” the sick man asked.
“You have no idea what I went through to save him after you abandoned him. I told you, you would hurt him. I told you, you were not good for him.”
John’s control shattered. He moved rapidly and deeply. Plummeting into Sherlock. Sherlock was helpless under the ferocity of the alpha. He wrapped his legs around John’s hips and gripped the blonde’s biceps just to hold on. The sound of slapping flesh was mingled with groans and moans.
When You Say That He’s the One That You Want
“Do you want me to track him down? Maybe he could come by . . .”
“Colonel, where am I? Why am I not with Sherlock and William?” He tried to not sound scared. He tried to sound like a confident soldier speaking to his commanding officer.
There was a loud crack, like the sound of the gunshot. The mast of the ship snapped and crashed down into the water. The boat began to roll onto its side.
“Well, someone had to help Jim hide his money.” Frankie said.
“I’ve still got question.”
“He came back alone – last night. Said he was done in town and came back to the ship.”
“So your objection is the cost and not the fact that I am giving it to you.” Sherlock continued to walk and John fell into step with him.
2017       John let Moran take him to the bedroom. They undressed each other slowly and kissed as skin was exposed. John closed his eyes and forced himself to relax. To let the other man lead. It felt like it had been years since anyone had touched John this way. There had are been quick and stolen moments in the army. Hand jobs and the rare oral but to be naked and wrapped in another person’s arms, John didn’t want to remember who had been the last person. He knew it wasn’t Sherlock, but he didn’t want to even compare lovers. He just wanted to let go and forget.
“John, you can be so oblivious. Yes, I don’t want other people thinking you are available for them. I want you here, damn it. I find you are the only person who doesn’t bore me.”
“It doesn’t matter the reason why I was sent seduce you . . .”
“Two? Who?”
“Victor Trevor will be bonded in less than four months according to his sister, Lavidia.” Mycroft said.
“And I will kill anyone who hurts you.”
“John, I don’t want to talk about it anymore. I can’t.”
He sighed and sat down. He spun the envelope around so he could read the name on it. It was from a solicitor in the City. John broke the seal and opened the envelope and dropped the papers out on the table. John read the opening letter, then read it again. He set everything down and went to make another cup of tea.
“John, aren’t you still Harrogate?” Mycroft asked. “You are not allowed phone privileges.”
“Get me her attending physician. I wish to know the extent of her injuries and if she is requesting anything.” He started to spin on his heels and rush into his private office.
Moran felt relieved. “I will make sure they are memorable.”
“Your time with Victor has dulled your senses, Sherlock.” Mycroft mocked. “John had made arrangements to join the Army and finish his clinical rotations for his medical training in the military.”
~221~
Sherlock took a step back to look more carefully at John’s face. He didn’t see any hesitation or fear in the young man’s eyes. He saw interest but also something else. Something new and different. He wasn’t sure he knew exactly what it was.
“A photo of you coddling your true love . . . ex-Colonel Sebastian Moran.”
“Couldn’t live anywhere else, really. Kicked around for a few months. Tried this and that. Then a friend offered me this job. Not as exciting as Helmand Province but getting to clear the pub on Friday night of football fans can be fun.”
“Alcohol, not drugs. But the outcome will still be the same. Ruined lives. And not just the person who is abusing the substance.”
John glanced at the number then shoved it into the pocket of his scrubs. He turned and walked away from the detective and the room. He wanted to get as far away from Sherlock as he could. He still thought he was going to be sick and he didn’t want to give Sherlock the pleasure of knowing he caused it.
Greg took a moment, just staring at John. Contemplating what words he would use.
Her breath was warm against his skin and it seemed so perfect. So natural. So not Sherlock.
John folded the paper, feeling disgusted by the story. He thought he should feel sorry for the woman, but he was dismayed why someone who had so much going for them would make such stupid mistakes. She was popular and attractive. She was making a lot of money doing actually nothing. It wasn’t like people were shooting at her. She wasn’t risking her life for others. She was barely even thinking of others.
And if anyone asks, you never heard a word from me.”
Sherlock finally turned and looked at John. He glanced at the glass in the omega’s hand then back up at the doctor, frowning.
Mycroft rocked back and forth on his heels, pouting. “I wouldn’t even consider the possibility.”
“Well, I was just wondering, and don’t take offence . . .”
“You haven’t won, Mycroft. You won’t ever win against John and I.” Sherlock shrugged his coat on and twisted his scarf around his neck. “Remember what I said. One hint of you trying to convince me to leave John and I will burn your house down with you in it.”
“My what!?” John turned and looked at him.
“Funny, Sherlock.” John said.
“Watson.”
Sherlock waited a moment then turned and walked to the door. “Any intelligent person would make the same assumption about you, John. The way you live. Withdrawn and reclusive. I’m surprised you didn’t take holy orders and become a monk. You were always good at self-flagellation. No wonder none of your army buddies have made any attempt to reconnect with you.”
Sherlock thought he knew that voice. He turned his head slightly. The simple movement brought agonizing pain to his skull.
“Yes. A brick wasn’t it? I told you, Sherlock, that if your endeavors with the Met ever became a threat to you that they would end.”
Creases of worry and concern cut across John’s expression. Sherlock could see John’s eyes moving rapidly behind closed lids. John was making soft grunting noises. Unintelligible groans and pleas. John’s lips were pressing together, pulled down in scowl. Sherlock placed his hand on John’s sweaty chest and felt his constant heartbeat was racing. Beating wildly in John’s chest.
“You kept Moriarty and Moran away from Sherlock while we were dating.” John said feeling like his world had been tipped up on its side. “You stopped Moriarty from hurting me.”
“You must be mistaken, Mister Smith. I only hold a minor position in Her Majesty’s government.” Mycroft said with a well-practiced smile.
“That doesn’t explain Moriarty’s fixation with you, Sherlock.” Mycroft said.
“I work for you, Jim. I’m yours.” Moran said as calmly as he could. “I promise to do whatever you ask.”
“No, I shouldn’t.” John said, waving the bottle away.
“What makes you think I’m nervous?” Sherlock asked.
“FUCK!” Frankie shouted. Then he blinked his eyes. “Johnny!?” Johnny? Is that you?”
“I want . . .” a kiss. “To . . .” A lick. “Touch you . . . ” Another kiss.
He wanted to know what they were talking about. He wanted to know what was make John so happy. He remembered when he could make John smile like that. When he made John happy. He watched as Moran bought his hand up and gently cupped John’s face. The taller man leaned down and kissed John’s lips. It was a firm and solid kiss that lasted far too long for Sherlock to believe it was one sided.
John looked up at the man then sighed heavily. “What?”
“Busted axel.” One of the men shouted. Irish accent.
“John, no . . .” Sherlock warned softly from his side of the room.
Sherlock looked down on the naked dead body of Victor Trevor. His pale skin was marred with various bruises. He had bite marks on his shoulders and neck. He had a swollen black eye. It was obvious from the position of the body, he had been raped.
Sherlock slammed his mouth shut with an audible snap. A sulk remained on his face though. He hated being stopped in mid-deduction, but he realized that alienating the nursing staff would only harm John and not benefit him in any way.
Jim’s expression turned dark and enraged. “Arrogant little nobody. He ruined my plans.”
“He wanted to question me without you here, John.” Sherlock said as he sat down imperiously in his leather and chrome chair.
Sherlock stepped into the kitchen and sat down opposite John, carefully looking the man over. Sherlock could see John had been hit twice in the face. Both times on the left side, so a right handed attacker. John’s knuckles were bruised on his left hand. John got several punches in too. There were bruises on John’s wrists and upper arms. He had been grabbed but fought the attacker off. Sherlock also noticed the shake in John’s left hand. A tremor he hadn’t seen before. There was a deadness to John’s eyes and a detached expression.
“Stop thinking so loud.” Sherlock said into John’s neck.
Greg blinked several times. He had never told anyone he had fantasized about the young omega. No one – not once.
“And fucking gorgeous.” James replied.
“Are you saying it was a friend of Mummy’s who did this?” Mycroft’s voice took on an edge.
The woman was still glaring at Eddy when she noticed her partner was bent over with blood gushing from his face. She pushed Eddy off herself and went to her partner. When she turned to attack the two strangers. They were gone.
Lestrade nodded his head. He had met the Governor and that the man a buffoon.
Morelly could see the anxiety in the man’s face. He liked Watson. The young recruit worked hard and never flinched at any duty. Morelly thought for a moment then frowned. He was breaking regulations.
“No, sir, but that is not why I’ve bothered you.” Anthea said hesitantly.
John’s eyes shifted towards Sherlock but the dark haired man didn’t seemed fazed by the comment.
“Is it true that James Stuart has a treaty with France?” William asked.
John realized it did not matter any longer. John could be in an open relationship with Sherlock and no one would be able to hurt them. Scholarship or not, he and Sherlock could be lovers.
John Watson looked down at the hand for a moment before he reached forward and shook it. Moran noticed John had a strong grip and callous fingers. Again something he was unfamiliar with regarding omegas. Weren’t they supposed to be weak and fragile? John Watson was anything but. He was strong and confident. He remained calm when other . . . when alphas were frightened and panicked.
Sherlock had only a moment, but he recognized the shorter man in front. His build and stance. It had to be John. His John. Sherlock noticed the subtle movement from the man standing next to John. The small plastic canister rolled out of the man’s hand and across the floor to rest at Moran’s feet.
Moran wasn’t expecting the blow and took a step back as his jaw ached from the punch. He could taste blood in his mouth. He raised his right hand and back handed Sherlock across his face. The omega flew sideways from the hit, crashing back on to the bed.
“Oh, Mrs. Holmes, you are too humble. Your sons are quite remarkable. One, an important member of the government and the other, living his life outside the normal expectations of an omega.” Culverton Smith returned Violet’s smile.
“Then what were you doing in Barbados?” James asked.
“Who gave you the knife?” She demanded.
“Pennybank Home.” She slipped the stethoscope in her ears and leaned down over him.
“John, we need to discover who wants to kidnap me and why.” Sherlock said.
“John!? Jump!” Sherlock shouted.
“Leave, Mycroft.” Came a disembodied voice from under the bed.
“Oh,” Sir Henry said surprised. “I’m sure she can wait for you to at least see your tailors. I mean you haven’t had a new suit of clothes in three years. You don’t want to appear at Whitehall in those clothes.” Sir Henry waved his handkerchief at Mycroft’s traveling clothes. Time aboard ship and sea air had been taxing on the clothing.
“Don’t worry, nothing will. Now, let me help you with that shower and tomorrow you will call Frankie and quit.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes at his brother.
Greg saw a shadow pass over Sherlock’s face. Greg coughed to cover up his groan.
“I have been told not to trust the English. You are nothing but liars and cheats.” Magnussen said. He snapped his fingers. “I will keep your prize and sell him elsewhere. I’m sure his brother will be willing to pay a pretty penny for him.”
. His assistant, Anthea, was sitting at her desk, rapidly answering phone calls. She appeared haired and her normal calm demeanor was replaced with a sharp biting responses.
“You rarely worry and never do what is best for me. John Watson . . . he is what is best for me.” Sherlock said with certainty.
John pulled away from Sherlock and glared up at the man. “Damn it, Sherlock. Give it a rest. I won’t quit and I won’t be kept. Just let me be myself!”
Moran stumbled backwards in pain, gasping for breath as he raised his hands to his throat. John leaped forward and rushed down the hall. Moran reached to grab John but only caught the hem of the hospital gown. The worn cloth tore easily. John stumbled but was able to stay on his feet as he ran. Moran’s momentum to pull John back made him fall when the cloth gave way.
“Lestrade. It’s not his department but there have been two other suicides that fit this profile.”
“Biology. Preventing an omega from looking for another alpha to bred them.” John was getting angry with Sherlock’s ignorance.
Greg paled and John looked at the photograph of the general again. “But H2S is difficult to work with. How was he gassed?”
“I may only hold a minor position in the government, but I am a very busy man. Please be brief, Mister Magnussen.”
“You are the one whose has been manipulating people. Nurse Bobbie Wilson has left.”
Mary hummed and glance between the two men. She didn’t even look at her cards. She just slid in the necessary chips to match John and Humphrey.
John and Sherlock each had a man to fight. They danced and weaved as they tried to avoid being punched. Their attackers kept lumbering forward and then pushed back with every punch Sherlock and John landed on them. Finally one of the attackers pulled out a short pistol and pulled the hammer back. He aimed it straight at John’s chest. John halted in mid-punch. Sherlock stopped fighting as soon as he saw John’s life threatened.
(See the end of the chapter for
John could see the pain in Sherlock’s face. He could hear it in the words. Then he thought maybe it was his imagination. Maybe he wanted more than Sherlock was willing to give him. He obviously thought the night before meant more than it did to Sherlock.
Just as he was afraid would happen, John lost his job. Sherlock insisted it didn’t matter but John refused to be a burden on their growing relationship. He tried to find jobs near the hospital but with no luck. He asked his teammates if they knew of any jobs and the answers were no. He checked the want-ads in the newspapers but found nothing that would work. Frustrated and worried, John finally went to the one bar to apply for a job that Sherlock asked him not to. ‘Frankie’s Backdoor’.
“I thought you were going to . . .”
“Oh, very simply this time. A witness.” Jim said as he finally sat down on the couch. He spread his arms out over the back. A wild smile across his face. “Mycroft will be heard by several witnesses arguing with his younger brother about his chosen bondmate. Then our dear Anthea, fearing for the safety of the helpless omega, Sherlock, will rush in here but it will be too late. She will see Mycroft fire his gun. The bullet will of course strike you in the heart and kill you instantly. Shame really, a prolonged agonizing death would have been pleasurable to watch but we can’t have you telling anyone that our little murder scene is fake. So, where was I? Oh, yes . . . Anthea will rush in see Mycroft Holmes shoot and kill his brother. Mycroft Holmes will of course profess his innocence but no one will believe him and he will spend the rest of his days in prison. And if for some reason you escape a conviction, there will always be Dr. John Watson willing to hunt him down and gut him.”
John knitted his eyebrows. That didn’t seem right, but he didn’t have time to worry about that now. He pulled the curtain back and saw Sherlock laying in the bed. He was sleeping. His expression was relaxed but John decide that had to because of medication.
“John!”
“It’s a bounty.” John said.
“Sherlock!”
“John? John who? Oh! John! John Watson! That’s great. Where is he? Is he here tonight?” Frankie looked around the room at the various dancers and people milling around the club.
“What is it?” John asked as he stepped forward, eager to see the file. The thrill of helping Sherlock on another case began to buzz through his veins.
John felt his mouth go dry. He wondered what evidence Dimmit could have.
“Have Stamford come here with his kit.” John said to a young boy standing beside him.
“No, John. I’ll be fine. And if I haven’t said it, thank you.”
Sherlock glanced around the first floor. The house was elegant and clean. There was no loud music or boisterous conversations. Not what Sherlock expected in a brothel. The floors were highly polished wood stained black. The walls were whitewashed plaster. In each room, a small black child pulled cords that cause large fans against the ceiling to move. The gentle movement of air was refreshing and helped cool the rooms. The furniture was covered in French jacquard fabric. There were silk pillows and wool rugs.
