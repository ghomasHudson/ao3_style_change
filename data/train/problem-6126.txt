“I know, RIGHT?” Sam asked him.  His head swiveled back to Jan.  “Is this because I stepped on your foot that one time?”
“Woo it up,” Sam agreed, his fingers squeezing Steve's.  “Flowers, chocolates, breakfast in bed, romantic movies, sappy text messages.”
“I mean, I would, but I’m stopping at In n’ Out on the way,” Clint said, tossing his bags on top of the rest of their luggage.  “I want a burger.”
Rogers hovered in the doorway, as if he wasn't sure if he should risk stepping over the line that separated the grand, well ordered, almost staid house from this loud, chaotic space.  "Am I interrupting?" he asked at last.
Sam nodded.  “Steve, two thirds of the tri-state area has had sexual fantasies about Tony.  So if you haven't, you're in the minority on that.”  He leaned forward.  "Now, if I WAS your therapist-"
“I have a headache the size of Mount Everest,” Tony said, through gritted teeth.  “And it’s the coldest thing in the freezer.”  He opened one eye, glaring in Steve’s direction.  “At this point, it’s more effective if I don’t drink it.”
Of course, with the wisdom of age, Tony now wondered how many mornings his father had been just nursing a hangover.
“She managed to get in touch with Henry Pym, an old graduate student of my father’s, who still remembered my mother.  He promised to help, any way he could.”  She stopped, grinning at Steve.  “He’s not much good in a crisis, but his fiance is.  I think you’ve met her.”  Steve blinked at her, confused, and Bobbi gave a quick spin, the tails of her coat floating out, almost like a skirt.  “You remember her.  She likes to get hands on with everyone she meets.”
Steve's head fell forward.  “Bucky, you have five minutes to get out of here, or I swear I'm going to start stripping and throwing every single piece of clothing at you.”
“Well, so am I, but I drank quite a bit to accomplish that,” Obie said, with a wry smile.  He leaned over, moving his fingers along the spines of the ledgers.  “Which also might explain why I have no memory of the books for that year. You should have them?”
Okoye muttered a curse under her breath as Shuri galloped ahead of them, her body bent low over her horse’s neck.   “Highness, you should not-” But Shuri just raised a hand, waving after her.
DJ looked up from his tablet, blinking hard to make his eyes focus.  Steve was smiling down at him, and DJ tried to smile back.  “Yes,” he said.  He closed the invitation with a flick of his fingertip and set the tablet aside.  He rocked forward in his seat, his hands braced on either side of his hips, his toes curling up tight.  “It’s…”  He made a face.  “Confusing.”
“The numbers are definitely against him on this one,” Steve said.  He crossed the workshop, pausing next to DJ to bump his knuckles lightly against DJ's head.  DJ grinned up at him.  Steve smiled back, all warmth and affection.  “It's just about time for our meeting.  We'll be back in two hours.  We'll let you know if something changes.  Okay?”
“Tell me I’ve lost it,” Steve said to Happy, knocking shards of glass out of the way so he could reach in to unlock the door.  “Tell me Stane has some reason to come down here, other than what I’m thinking.”
There was an unfamiliar car parked at the curb half a block away from Steve’s building, an old, rather battered looking Ford.  A man was leaning against the side of it, his hat pulled low over his face and the collar of his coat turned up against the cold.  As they approached, he dropped his cigar stub to the ground, glancing in their direction.
“Well.”  She considered that, her eyes narrowed, a finger pressed to her lips.  “I think we'll manage to keep the house.”
He’d half expected a denial, or some feigned attempt at confusion.  Instead, Happy just nodded, his chin dipping down towards his chest.  “We all got our secrets,” he said.  “An’ some of us, more than others.”
"C'mon." O'Brien gestured towards the single chair in front of his desk.  "This is a hell of a mess, Rogers, and you're the lucky man who gets to deal with it."
“No,” Tony said.  He realized he was fussing with his hair, and forced his hand back to his side.  Clint was smiling at him, and Tony considered flipping him off.  “We’re not going anywhere.”
Greer whipped her shirt off, tossing it towards a locker, and leaving her clad in her shorts and a sports bra.  “Ready,” she said, pounding her fist into the palm of her other hand.
Tony nodded.  “Yes.  Yes, you can.” He rolled, going up on one knee so he could press a gentle kiss to DJ’s forehead.  He smelled familiar, and Tony didn’t know why.  “You absolutely can.”
“Still going to love you,” Steve said, “and we can order a real pizza, you know.  We live in New York.  Why would we possibly make a frozen pizza?”
“I’m warning everyone, right now,” Clint said, as they all clambered to their feet, “That I’m going to get a corn dog from the regular buffet, and I’m going to put it straight into the chocolate fountain.”
“Right,” Rhodes said, his head cocked to the side.  But he was smiling.  “I’ve got a patrol to finish.  You heading back?”
Tony waved him off.  “I promise I'll taste test anything he gets his hands on.”  Rogers was trying not to smile.  Tony wasn't sure how he knew that, but he did.  He braced his hands on the workbench.  "So if there's no problem, then-"
“He declared he was done with the ‘leeches and ticks’ of modern medicine and he was going up on the roof to keep watch,” Bruce said, his voice dry.
Rogers stared at him, his face unreadable.  But he studied Tony, as if he was just as baffled by Tony as Tony was by him.  Finally, he said, “There's two things the poor don't get to have, Mr. Stark.  Silence and solitude.”
“Jarvis, call the cleaning service,” Tony said, allowing Steve to drag him out.  He wrapped the blanket around himself, an improvised toga.  “I think I make this work.”
Steve smiled against his palm, and when Tony’s fingers twitched, he reached up, catching Tony’s wrist and lifting his hand away.  He didn’t let go, just let his fingers tangle with Tony’s.  “How about I just ask you out?” he whispered.
Which was not making this situation any better, or easier, but when had Tony ever cared about making things easy for himself?
When she left, Tony would lick Steve's fingers clean, his tongue lingering against the skin to make Steve shiver.
DJ came scrambling across the floor, ducking around them, and Tony moved to intercept.  Jarvis got there first, catching DJ's hands, then lifted him straight up and off the ground.  Laughing, DJ kicked at the air, coming down with his feet next to Jarvis's.  "Set your toes on mine," Jarvis instructed.  "I taught Master Stark to dance when he was not much bigger than you, I shall teach you as well."
“One on a long list of things our chef is never going to do,” Tony said.  “But if there’s anyone as stubborn as him, it’s Mrs. Parker, and so our kitchen remains an active battleground.”  He half turned to Steve, scowling down at the sketchbook.  “Jarvis and Natasha.  Bobbi in the garden.  Bruce with his flowers.”
“If you drink it black, I’m sure you can have some small treat,” Jan said, smiling at her over the rim of her own cup.
“His heart is going to explode and I’d like to stave that off for a few years,” Steve pointed out.  “And he was huddled behind Sam’s counter, his feet braced against the far cabinets.  Eating cheese fries with his bare hands.”
The officer nodded, then leaned to the side.  "Ay," he called, rattling off a string of words that Tony didn't have a chance of following.  But in the line, one of the students ducked under the stanchions, working his way to the front of the line.  A quick exchange between him and the officer, and he handed over his phrasebook.  The officer bent over it, flicking through pages until he found what he was looking for.  He looked up.  "Doom is a-"  He stabbed his fingertip against the page.  "Asshole of man."
Rhodey looked like he wanted to say something about that.  Instead, he leaned back, his arms crossed over his chest.  “How'd the team take the news?”
Another beat of silence as he considered that.  "Hello," he said at last, and then the heavy tread of footsteps in the hall brought his head up.  He glanced down, at the street below him, and Pepper came half out of her chair.
The car came to a stop in front of the mansion’s doors.  Steve didn’t move.  “Someone wants him dead,” he said at last.  He met Happy’s eyes.  “And I don’t think it’s a stranger.”
“What’s better?” Bucky set the bottle aside and started on the next one.  “It is what it is.”  He looked at Steve, one dark eye visible under the weight of his hair.  “Are you?”
“That, too.”  Mrs. Parker nodded at the basket of unpeeled apples.  “And if you need a job, those need to be checked for bad spots and worm holes.”
“Sorry, I'll try to be shorter in the future,” Steve said, amused, as the woman reappeared, dragging a young man by the arm.  His glasses were crooked on his nose, and his hair had been bleached and the tips frosted in pale blue.
Stephen stroked a hand over his jaw, fingers sliding over his beard.  “Clea has already begun investigating, and I’ve reached out to a few others who might have an insight as to what’s happening.” He reached for the pocket of his vest, and energy flowed around his fingers, solidifying into something that might’ve been a pocketwatch, in another place and time.  He looked down at it, and light reflected across the planes of his face, washing over him like waves.
“We stayed,” she agreed.  “Because one morning, after we’d been here for about, maybe a month?  I went down in the kitchen, in the early hours, to start the bread rising.  It was maybe-”  She shook her head.  “Maybe four am.  I wasn’t expecting company.  But Mr. Stark was there, with a cup of coffee and a stack of papers.”  Slowly, carefully, she began to remove the skin from the apple in her hands, the peel sliding between his fingertips.
"You don't," Steve said. "If you decide, right now, that the fact that I'm married to another man invalidates everything that I've done, everything I've tried to do, then I can't do anything to change your mind." He leaned in. "You don't matter. You've got enough history. You've got enough heroes. But there are people out there, there are kids out there, who need to know that people like them exist, and have always existed. Despite the efforts of people like you to erase them."
“Yeah, how do you get funding for a serious psychological study of ‘have you had sex dreams about Tony Stark?’”
Pepper settled down on the well-worn quilt, tucking her legs under her and smoothing her skirts down around her knees.  "Sit down and eat," she said, reaching for the crock of baked beans.  "Natasha, did we bring out the chow-chow?"
“You were robbing him,” Steve repeated, more amused by this than he should’ve been.  “And how, exactly, did that result in-” He waved a hand at the kitchen.  “This?”
“It's less about the soup and more about wanting to mess with him while he's too feverish to fight back.”
DJ shuffled through his flashcards, his mouth pursed as he considered two of them.  His head swung between them, his expression considering.  Doing his best to hide his smile, Tony waited for him to make up his mind, and reached for an onion.  He should probably find his mandolin.  He rolled his knife in his hand, rotating his wrist.  He probably should, but he wasn’t going to.
“If I have to deal with it, it’s major,” Pepper said, her voice dire.  “Keep it out of the papers, and them out of handcuffs and I’ll consider it good.”  She held out her hand.  “Do we have a deal?”
Tony’s tongue flicked out, wetting his lips and Steve went a little dizzy for a second.  “And what would you have done if I had?” he asked.
"Oh, no, sir," Jarvis said, his voice echoing down the stairs to Steve.  "I quite take offense to that."  At the top of the stairs, he stopped, his hand resting easily on the railing.  "After all, everyone here is free to leave at any time."  And with the perfect beat timing of a Vaudevillian who'd done his routine a million times before, he gestured to a door at the end of the hallway.  "Right this way."
Justin Hammer was a trying man under the best of circumstances. The middle of the Grand Foyer of Radio City Music Hall twenty minutes before the show was due to start was not the best of circumstances. With the crowd pressing in at all sides, and more people pouring in off the street with each passing moment, he was inescapable.
“I need everyone to stop asking me that,” Steve said.  He glanced at Tony, his mouth a thin line, his arms crossed over his chest.  “Sorry.”
She spread her hands.  “Biiiiiig block of ice,” she agreed.  “So, you can see why the border guards made an exception and let them bring you back.  Why they thought we needed a dead boy in ice that would not melt?  I have no idea.  But it was just interesting enough to let them haul you all the way down river, straight to the heart of the city.
“Welcome!” DJ said.  He waited until Thor tipped Darcy gently into an empty chair before he placed a small, flat box in her lap.  “For you,” he said, holding a palm-sized box to Thor.
“Forty percent money, twenty-five percent celebrities, fifteen percent politicians, ten percent press and critics, five percent ridiculous flash in the pan tabloid fodder of the minute to draw the paparazzi coverage from everyone else, and five percent people we can actually stand,” Pepper said.
Bobbi nodded, a sharp dip of her chin.  “I wanted to know who did it.  Who actually pulled the trigger.”  Her hand, at her side, was curled in a fist, the muscles so tight that her arm was almost vibrating with it.  But her voice was cool and steady.  “I still had an in or two.  People who were pleased that I didn’t walk in guns blazing.  And people who found my driving skills useful.
“I anticipated your request,” Jarvis said, his voice echoing from the open front of the armor.  “If you would be so good as to unlock the door, sir?”
"It's a compliment, darling," Jan told him, considering her nails. "You might have the men bamboozled, but every woman in the room knows you're a romantic."
He walked back to his chair and dropped back into it with a heavy sigh.  “The lost heir.  The prodigal son.  Home at last.”
“That it is,” she said, tapping a finger against her lips.  “Know who’d fit right in with this mess of contradictions?” She smiled.  “A cop who spends his nights being a vigilante.”  Her eyebrows arched. “Know anyone who fits that description?”
“Yours, mostly,” Darcy said.  “I pointed out he could legally adopt me without having to marry my mother, but I didn’t manage to get any traction on that idea.” She looked at DJ.  “So, what am I missing?  What’s it like, being a Stark?”
But lacking the armor, he just started walking.   Between the buildings that ringed the SI property, up narrow alleys and across parking lots.  Down to the test ranges, along the length the broad swaths of the tarmac that made up the airstrip and through the dusty side lots.  He walked until he was exhausted, until he was too tired to think, until he found an unattended warehouse on a rather deserted corner of the property.
He met Steve’s eyes.  “Which results in another, even more difficult problem: when these children do find someone they want to…”  He paused.  “Associate with, then the answer, to them, is simple.  If everyone in the world is after them for their money, well, then…” He spread his hands.  “Why not give it to them?”
“No.  No, I-”  He looked back down at the desktop, and reached for the bottle.  Tony got there first, his fingers closing on the neck of the bottle, drawing it back, out of reach.  Hammer’s hand fell down, curled lightly into a fist.  “When the car slowed down, I just…  Opened the door.”
"There is nothing wrong with my shorts," he said, and he was trying not to smile now.  Trying, and mostly failing.  "Get off."
Steve grinned down at his bread dough, his hands working with practiced speed.  There was flour dusting his apron and his bare arms, swirling through the late afternoon sunlight air around him.  Tony watched him work, snuggled down on the couch under a half dozen blankets.  It was calming, and somehow intimate, to watch him go about his baking with his usual care and patience.
Laughing, Tony grabbed hold of the lapels of his sweatshirt, pulling him in.  “In my defense,” he repeated, “most of the messes he cleans up, he made.”
“Wait.”  Steve stared up at her.  “What…  What do I call you?  When you’re-”  He gestured at her.  “Jarvis said sirs, is it…”  He stopped.  “I don’t know what to ask,” he admitted.
“Then there’s nothing to be sorry about..”  She sliced another piece of apple free from the core.  “DJ, would you like some apple?”
Steve stared at him.  “Why didn't you tell me?” he asked, and he sounded so honestly and truly hurt that Tony wanted to hug him.
Steve glanced at the coffee pot on the kitchen counter.  It was steaming, the pot full and ready to be poured.  “And he fell asleep waiting for the coffee to brew, huh?” he asked, affection blooming in his chest, warmth flooding over him.
"What the hell's the difference?" Steve asked, and the moment the words were out of his mouth, he regretted them.  He squeezed his eyes shut.  "Sorry.  Sorry, I'm-"
Tony choked on a laugh.  “Lies,” he said, taking a sip of his drink.  “Embarrassing lies.  You’re a spring chicken, Jarvis.”  Jarvis laughed, and Tony opened one eye, peering at him.  “You should have grandchildren by now.  If you hadn’t wasted your life picking up after me, you’d-”  He stopped, shaking his head.  “You should have grandchildren.”
“No, but his Tony probably is,” Harris said.  Tony raised his head just far enough to glare in his direction, and Harris shrugged.  “Seems likely, that’s all I’m saying.”
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis said, replacing the envelopes on his tray and lifting the coffee pot instead.  Tony held out his cup, and Jarvis filled it with a practiced gesture.
DJ looked up at the movie, where some rather creepy looking undead were shambling across the screen.   He looked back at Franklin.  “No.”  Franklin studied him, and DJ tried again.  “I like 'Paranorman.'”
“Yes,” she said, her voice flat.  “I absolutely am.”  She reached back and patted Sam on the cheek.  “And no one'd blame me.”
“Hey, now,” Steve said, an easy smile creasing his cheeks.  “That's not vintage, Isaiah's wife Cora made that for me last Christmas.”
There were still a few rose petals stuck in his hair, and Steve beckoned him closer.  “I booked the room with the passport and credit cards from a cover identity,” he said, as Tony stepped up next to him.  Steve slid his fingers through Tony's hair, coaxing the bruised petals free. “No one cares about Roger Grant and his inebriated spouse.”
Tony pressed a hand to his forehead, trying not to notice the way his fingers were shaking.  “Why the hell-”
“Yeah.  Wonder why not,” Harris said, and that was a lie but he refused to acknowledge that it was a lie.  “Do you need-”
Steve considered that.  “Is that why I'm still trying with the dance lessons?” he asked.  And why Tony's hand stroking his hair had felt so good.  His face felt hot, and he focused on drinking his water.
“Oh, I don’t either, but Mrs. Parker plays a mean rag on the piano.”  Bobbi dropped the music back into the folder. “But still.  I managed to track down a few incidents that I’m fairly certain happened, at least to some extent.”  She spread the pages out.  “An Italian grocer who refused to pay the protection money that la Cosa Nostra demanded of him.  Rumor has it that the four men who came to firebomb his storefront met...  Unusual resistance.  No one’s bothered him since.”
“I'm done discussing this,” Tony said, and for a second, the kitchen went still, every head swinging in his direction.
Tony smiled.  “I’m sure he would.”  He took a step back, studying the board.  Then, not really sure why he was doing it, he reached out, plucking one of the white knights from the board.  He rolled it back and forth between his fingers.  “I’m sure he would.”
“Right,” Tony said to Charlie.  “She’s-”  He looked back at the camera.  “I don’t know what is going on here, and that is not a position I like to be in.”
“So I can't promise you that the person who comes for you, the person who finds you, is going to be me.  We both know that's the truth.  There's no promises like that, not right now.”  He tried to smile, and it wasn't his best effort, but it wasn't a lie the way so many of his smiles were.
He could taste it on his tongue, on his lips, he knew what it would taste like, even though it was no where near his mouth, or maybe it was, it was, it was right in front of him now, but he could taste it, soft and spicy and with the earthly, heavy sweetness of honey, a sweetness that settled in his mouth, that coated his throat, a sweetness that covered something, that hid something, something that swirled in the depths of that cup, something that gleamed with light instead of darkness and something something something
Miss Potts laughed, short and sharp.  "No."  Her head shook.  "Not at all." She reached for her teacup.  "We're working at limited production right now, but we're working."  She considered Steve over the rim of the cup.  "When the world began to fall apart, when it was clear that things were going to be bad, after the first sequence of crashes, Tony gave the employees a choice, to keep everyone at limited shifts, at limited pay, or lay people off.
“Dear God, no,” Tony said, filling her cup, and then his own, with coffee.  “Are you kidding me? You don’t get matches.”
“Agreed,” Iron Man said.  “And since he’d just gone through this with, well-” He waved a hand at Rogers.  “He seemed less than sympathetic to my situation.  But Clea found Zebrahead, and he guided us to this part of the world, and then I ditched them both, because I found out.  That my child.  Was in Las Vegas.”
Rhodey’s eyes went wide.  “Ah.  Right.”  He set the coffee cup down in front of him, the movement careful.  “That.”
Steve opened his mouth, and closed it, unsure what to say.  "Oh, soup is good, everyone likes soup when they're not feeling well, but-"
Everyone stopped, heads swinging toward Steve.  He met their eyes, one by one.  “That’s enough,” he repeated, and it was his field voice, the one he used when he needed their attention, when he needed their cooperation.  “There’s blame enough to go around here, and I don’t care about who’s going to shoulder the brunt of it.  All that matters is that we find him.”
Steve took a deep breath.  “Swear to me,” he said, and it came out wrong, it came out like a plea instead of an order.  He swallowed hard, and tried again.  “Swear you’ll take care of him.  Swear you’ll do your best by him, and if you can’t, you’ll find someone who can.”
Steve stared at him.  Tony stared back.  Harris realized he was holding the sunglasses in both hands.  “What is happening here?” he asked.
The door opened before he could even climb the steps, Jarvis caught in silhouette by the lights of the foyer.  Rhodey jogged up the stairs.  “Happy said you had a delivery for me to make?”
Steve looked up, his blue eyes bright below the straight line of his brows, his high cheekbones pink, and Tony’s chest contracted, something he refused to acknowledge making his breath catch in his throat.  “Yours isn’t much better,” Steve said, even as he swiped a hand at his hair, undoing Tony’s efforts in a single move.
"Okay, as your friend, I'm going to say, you do have some tendencies that could be labeled slightly self-destructive," he said.  He glanced at Steve, his eyes kind.  "A little.  Self-destructive."
His voice trailed away, and it was so obviously a lie that it hurt to hear. But Tony knew a thing or two about lies told in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. He wasn't about to call him on it.
“Let’s just assume that the plant would remain, you know, a plant,” Steve said.  “Instead of a giant, mutated…” He gave his head a brisk shake.  This was not something he wanted to consider.  “Thing.”
He grabbed his pants from the end of the bed, yanking them on and anchoring them in place with one hand.  Not bothering with shoes or even the lamp, he stalked over to the door, just as his visitor started knocking again.  “Lay off,” he said, unlocking the door.  “I’m right-”
He disappeared into the pantry.  “Mr. Stark always says, pay a man a fair wage and reward loyalty and hard work, and they’ll repay the favor.”  A moment later, he emerged, a sack of potatoes braced on one muscular shoulder.  “You want some more?”
“Bought that,” Natasha said. “In red.  Then dumped it into the hot tub until it was roughly the consistency of sludge.  Which brought up a new problem.”  Her head tipped to the side.  “What actually causes the geling reaction of Jell-O?”
"Fine, you want to deal with my trash, I'm okay with that," Sam said, handing it over.  He leaned one shoulder against the stairway railing.  "I'm good like that.  I'll let you."
"Ooooh, yeah, I know that guy," Jan said.  She put her hands on her hips. "Mine was a corporate raider with a soon-to-be ex-wife."  She made a face.  “Or so he claimed.  Unsurprisingly, that divorce never went through.”
There was a chuckle, from somewhere in a crowd, then a snort of laughter.  The thug rocked back on his heels, gesturing towards Happy with the tip of his club.  “Put him in the drink,” he said, his voice almost amused.  “Maybe that’ll sober him up.”
“She absolutely can, and let’s not waste a good cover story,” Clint said, and Tony was right there with them, his hands on DJ’s shoulders, hustling him along ahead of him.  Harris glanced over, and DJ was staring down at his hands, still pressed together like he’d been interrupted in the middle of a prayer.  Smoke curled from between his fingers, like whatever was there was still burning, cradled in his palms.
DJ nodded.  A storm raged in the movie, and he resisted the urge to cover his ears.  “Do you have bad dreams?”
“I vote we burn the place to the ground,” Jan said.  Everyone looked at her, and she shrugged.  “What?”
“You're both children, you realize that, right?” he asked, as Tony collapsed back against him, laughing out loud now.
Somehow, there was no sting in the words, no sense of disdain or mockery.  Grinning, Steve watched as DJ turned the pages of the book.  "If you're that interested, you can come sit down and listen to the story, Mr. Stark," he said, giving DJ time to study the picture.  DJ's fingers traced over the contours of the knight on horseback, just barely making contact with the page.  Steve waited until he was done, until he pulled his hand back and looked up at Steve, his expression expectant.  "It's looks like it'll be a pretty good one."
Tony gave Dummy the instructions back. “Right.  Right.  Where are the fish instructions?”  Dummy shook the pages three times.
He didn't have time to finish the sentence.  The robot turned, its massive frame swaying as it twisted on its axis, feet crashing down on the street with sudden, alarming force.  And just like that, all semblance of slow, awkward movement was gone, and the thing was charging forward.
“Okay, bedtime,” he said, ripping his eyes away from Tony.  “Because you don't know what you're saying and I do, and that's a bad combination, so-” He leaned over, grabbing for one of the pillows, his fingers shaking.  “Let's just-”
“I can’t imagine what you’re referring to,” Steve said as Okoye came riding up next to them.  “I’ve told you not to listen to Sam.” She snorted under her breath and Steve shifted in his saddle, trying to resettle his weight.  “The man can’t be trusted.”
“Damn right I do, you got CLINT,” Sam said.  “And I was right here.  Me.” He held his hands out.  “Really?”
But apparently Iron Man did, because the torrent of words came to a sharp, stuttering stop.  There was a long moment of silence as they just faced each other, Rogers’ hand still hanging in space between them.  Then, finally, the faceplate of the helmet snapped up.
There was a sudden, scrambling motion behind him, the covers pulling away with a sharp yank.  Surprised, Tony fumbled himself into a sitting position just in time to see a pale blonde head disappear under the covers.  Legs hit his under the cover of the quilt and Tony realized, just a second too late, that Steve was absolutely making a break for it.
Stark looked up, his eyes meeting Steve's, clear and bright.  "A protector of the kingdom deserves to be an actual knight," he said, swinging the dowel in a loose, easy figure eight.  "In name as well as in heart."  He smiled, and there was nothing cruel to it.  "So kneel.  And be knighted."
Steve leaned in, and now, Tony rocked back, his eyes wide.  “I don’t work for you,” Steve said, his voice dark.  “When I get new orders, I’ll follow them, but right now, I know what I’m here to do, and that is to keep you alive.” He stepped to the side, and Tony went with him, shock flashing over his features.  “Even if the one who poses the greatest threat to you right now is you.”
A sudden, loud shout brought both of their heads around.  Tony watched, shocked, as a small, dark haired boy came running up the driveway, two of the hired guards in pursuit.  The boy’s head was turned back towards the guards, but he was sprinting straight towards the house, and Tony’s entire chest seized.
The door to the hotel lobby opened behind him.  “What’re you two doing out here?” Steve asked, stepping out onto the sidewalk with them.
“It’s a question, please try to keep up, I’m running on three viciously angry brain cells, the only ones I have that survived the alcohol apocolypse last night, you can help me out here, Alison.  Was I wearing pants?”
Shawn made a face. “I shouldn’t.  Less sugar.  New Year’s Resolution.”  He held up his hands in front of him like a prize fighter ready to square off.  “I can do this.”
"We're here for unscheduled, unforeseen repairs," Steve said, ignoring him.  "Our plane sustained damage leaving Latveria.  There is an approved ground crew that was dispatched by the local SHIELD office attempting to get it back up and running now.  We estimate it will be ready to go in a few hours.  By morning at the latest."
Steve settled back into his seat, his stomach churning.  “They don’t come inside the house,” he said, his voice quiet.
“I'll have some more,” Happy said, reaching for the platter of chicken.  Clint got there before him, and Happy made a grab for him.  “Hey, you little rat.”
He looked back up, and she was standing above him, the pale moonlight casting a halo around her head.  She flicked a salute, her fingers cutting through the air.  “Give it a minute, and-”
Steve choked on a laugh.  “It wasn't-”  He turned, looking down at Sam.  “I just-  I think about it sometimes.  About what it would be like to be ordinary, to be nobody in particular.”  He spread his hands.  “To be normal and be able to get married to whoever I wanted, without it being a damn thing, Sam.”
“Are you scared of the dark?” Franklin asked.  DJ thought about that, then shook his head.  Franklin nodded.  His teeth, white and straight, worried at the edge of his thumbnail.  “Val was afraid of the dark.”
"Please stop," Steve said, and Tony stopped.  "I'm going to choose to believe that you're making this up."
“IN MY DEFENSE,” Carol repeated, “that line has never, ever worked.  It’s not-  It’s not supposed to work.” She braced her hands on the table.  “It’s a bad line.  It can’t work.”
Steve slid the shield into its bag, tying the cord off with more force than was strictly necessary.  “Have you notified the police?”
Steve's eyes slid from one to the other, trying to make sense of either of them.  “You...  Tried to-”
Tony paused, his coffee halfway to his mouth.  He frowned.  That couldn’t be right.  “It has been far longer than-”
Then it sank in; something was badly wrong.  This wasn’t a child throwing a tantrum.  This was a child in pain.
Tony leaned back in his chair, a model wing cradled in the curve of his fingers.  “I’m surprised,” he said, frowning up at the model.
Tony frowned at the bubbling contents of the test tube.  “Check the database,” he said, making a minute adjustment to the flame.
“No.” Pepper held up a hand. “No. You cannot.” But she was smiling as she scrubbed at her cheeks with the heel of her hand. I miss a lot of things about being in a relationship with you, but that shirt is not one of them.”
In the silence that followed, Steve just focused on the sound of his breathing.  It seemed obscenely loud in the narrow confines of the bathroom.
His nails bit into Tony’s skin, pain cutting through the haze that Tony clouded Tony’s mind.  He stared at Obie, confusion giving way to nausea as Obie considered him with the sort of expression one would use when reviewing a failed experiment.  “I really wish you didn’t force me to do this,” Obie said.  “We had been getting along just fine, weren’t we, Tony?  You were so clever, and so uninterested.  You gave me everything I needed, all the clever little improvements, all the brilliant breakthroughs, and as long as there was still money flowing, you never did look too closely at just how much that flow contained.
“Right.”  Clint said, and it went on for a very long time.  Phil gave him a look over the top of his folder, and Clint bit off the end of the word.  “Right.”  He folded his arms over his chest, his fingers tapping against his bicep. “I mean.” He shrugged.  “Right.”
“Iriomote-yamaneko,” Steve said, yawning.  He wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, leaning into his back, his chin resting on Tony’s shoulder.  “Ohayōgozaimasu, DJ-kun.”
“If that wasn’t the password before, it’s the password now,” Rhodey said as Peter stepped aside, letting DJ bounce into the room, a plate clutched in his hands. There was flour all over his shirt and hand, his hair dusted with white.  “What’ve you got there, sport?”
"Like a deer in the headlights," he admitted.  He took a seat opposite Steve, his hands folded on the gleaming wood of the conference table.  "So.  Hi."  He gave a little wave.  "We're married."
Bucky stared down at him, his brow furrowed.  "But it's my couch," he repeated, bracing an elbow on the back of the couch.  He seemed confused by the situation.  "This.”  He tapped the back of the couch.  “This is where I sleep."
The blonde opened his mouth, but the kid in the sweatshirt beat him to the punch.  “My dads,” he said, his attention focused on the chapel.
The robot in the lead shifted forward.  “Target identified.”  One hand came up, huge metal fingers reaching for the boy.  “Surrender, or be destroyed.”
Curled against one arm of the loveseat, DJ was still fast asleep, his blanket trailing down to the floor.
“I’m fine,” Tony said, his attention already on the small notebook in his hand.  Steve made a humming noise under his breath, and Tony swatted at his hand with the book.  “Off.”
“That is both incorrect and also not what you wanted to hear at this moment.”  Jarvis stopped.  “Is it?”
“Oh, yes, you were quite sanguine when he dragged you through the front door,” Jarvis said.  “I wouldn’t say ‘kicking and screaming,’ but it was as close as you could get while maintaining your dignity.”
“No, you won’t,” Tony said, catching Jan by the shoulders and turning her to face him. “Hey.”  He gave her a slight shake, and her head bounced up, her eyes catching his, and he smiled.  “I told you what happened, and now you’ve stressed Cap out-”
"Kickin' an' screamin' the whole way," Seamus said cheerfully. “Hiself don't like being outmaneuvered.”
Morrison didn't offer a hand, or introduce himself. Steve nodded. “Glad you could make it,” he said, as the news director walked into the green room, the chic and pleasant figure of Von Dieter right behind him.
“Tony?” Nebula braced her chin on one hand.  “Unless you’d like to join us for a rousing discussion of colonialist themes in modern art styles, it’s time to go.”
That was met with stony silence.  He looked up.  Pepper, Maria Hill, and Marcy Pearson, Stark Industries VP of Public Relations, stared back at him, their faces indicating that they would not be moving on any time soon.  Next to him, Steve was sitting just as still, his shoulders squared, his face unreadable.  He'd barely said two words since the meeting from hell had started, not that Tony blamed him.
Tony gave his head a quick shake.  “I didn’t…  What?” he asked, and there was a strange note to his voice.
Not that either of the people she was observing cared about her presence.  Steve and Tony were locked in an argument at the base of the stairs, their voices rising and falling in sharp bursts.  Steve was canted forward, his shoulders a hard line, his spine painfully straight.  Every so often, he ran a hand through his hair, the movement sharp and frustrated, like he needed to move, and had no other outlet.
Luke held out a hand.  “C'mon, then.”  His teeth flashed in a broad smile.  “I taught Danny to dance, I can teach you.”
“I’ll talk to you on camera if you delete that now,” Steve said, bracing his hands on his counter.  His face felt like it was on fire, and judging by the impish, brilliant smile she gave him, it was obvious, even in the low light.  “Right.  Now.”
“I don’t know what you pay her, but I’m absolutely confident that’s true.  So.  On the record.  What’s your comment?”
“Fine, but if I start hissing, you might want to move out of range,” Greer said, plopping back in her seat.  Jess leaned over her, brandishing a comb and a hopeful smile.  Greer gave her a look.  “Really?” Jess nodded, and Greer smiled at her.  “Fine.  Go ahead.”
“For a smart man, you can be awfully obtuse when you want to be.”  Bucky snagged a cloth napkin from a nearby cart, tossing the remaining cream puffs into it and tying it up into a neat bundle.  “Just ask him.  It's not that fucking hard.”
DJ shook his head.  “There has to be access,” he said.  “If someone forgets.  Or doesn’t have a-”  He made an aborted gesture, his hand snapping out and jerking back.  “An invitation?  Has to have a way in.”
DJ blinked at him, then looked down at the cup of soup he was clutching between his hands.  “Oh.  No.”  He set the cup back down and gave them an attempt at a smile.  “No.  I’m…  Not hungry.”
“This was my mother’s favorite place in the whole house,” Tony said, pushing away from the stairs.  “She used to sit right there, on that same lounger, and watch that fountain.  Sometimes, she’d read, or embroider, or go over the ledgers, or the week’s menus.  But mostly, she’d just watch the water.”  He lowered himself down, until he was sitting on the floor in front of the sofa.  “And I’d sit right here.”
“We, at least, accept that our lives are out of our control and it’s best to roll with that,” Darcy said.  “You seem to think that if you struggle hard enough, you’re going to wriggle through a hole in the net, but let me tell you, buster?”  She dropped her tray onto an unoccupied table with a clatter.  “You’re not going to.  And talking about it is only going to make it worse.”
“Grab a couple of Cokes from the vending machine by the door, and I'll pay you back,” Tony told him.
“The ones that can be brewed into alcohol?”  She gave him an okay gesture, her thumb and index finger making a circle.  “Absolutely.  All the others?  Not so much.”
Clint grinned.  “Jambalaya,” he said, the word rolling off his tongue.  “An old recipe from my last…”  He paused.  “My last job.”
He opened his eyes, and Steve was right there, looking at him with an expression that Tony couldn't quite read.  It took him two tries to manage to get words out from lips that seemed to have gone numb.  “Don't I always?” he said, and he was pleased, he was relieved, because he sounded as glib and easy as he always did.
“Be careful going home,” Darcy said, her arms folded on the back of the pew, her chin resting on her wrist.
He saw her thin shoulders rise and fall beneath the thick, quilted material of her robe.  “You can do this,” she said.  “Go on, then.  And if you try to step one foot outside of this house, Peter Benjamin Parker, I will have you scrubbing every inch of woodwork in this house.”
“Are you joking right now?” Tony asked.  He snagged Peter by the back of the shirt and force marched him towards the library door.  “It's like you know the script, but don't know what your role is.”
His voice trailed away, and Bobbi picked up the thread.  “Answers,” she said.  Her smile was slow and sharp and very, very dangerous.  “I think it’s about time we gave him some, don’t you?”
Jarvis smiled. “It’s not a curse unless you’re determined to treat it like one.”  He stood again, giving Tony’s hair a look, frowning at it like it had insulted him somehow.  “Now, all we have to do make you somewhat presentable before he next visits.”
“And let's face it, I was drinking a hell of a lot,” Tony said.  He paused.  “I noticed you weren't where you should be, as soon as I got to California, Deej.  But there were all these things, and my life was upside down, and there was that drinking thing, you may not have noticed the drinking, but-”
"Well, what choice did I have?" Tony said.  He lay the menu down and unbuttoned his vest, the movements easy and Steve wondered if he even knew he was doing it.  He was okay with it.  There was something about Tony, rumpled and unguarded, all that sleek surface disturbed, that was everything he wanted and nothing he was equipped to deal with.
She looked at Steve.  “I called my mother, because, well, what else could I do?  She’d…” Something flickered over her face, some sharp and broken fragment of an emotion, gone almost before it was fully formed.  “Washed her hands of me, a long time before that, but I was still her only child.  She took the call.  Not that she had the money for bail, or the influence to appeal to anyone who did.  What she had was a few numbers, a few people who remained loyal to my father when he’d been ousted.
She laughed as Steve handed over the napkin wrapped cookie and a bottle of water.  “Right.”  She reached for her purse.  “Allison Blair. I’m with-”
Laughing, she walked around the couch and settled down on the floor next to Clint’s legs.  DJ waited for her to settle down, the silk of her silver pajamas rustling as she tucked her feet under her, before he pushed a large box over next to her.  She reached out, smoothing his hair back with gentle hand.  “Thank you,” she said.
Steve, being Steve, held out hope longer than he did.   He barely waited until Strange floated to the ground, the portal folding out of existence behind him, before he spoke.  “What do you have for us?”
“I already regret it!” Tony called after her, because he wanted the last word, even if the last word made no sense.  Jan gave him a little wave over her shoulder, and disappeared back through the door.  Tony crossed his arms over his chest.  “That could've gone better,” he said to Steve.
“I’ll have it framed and hung directly in front of Dummy’s charging station.”  Tony slid his arms around Steve’s waist.  “Let’s go.”
DJ realized he was laughing.  He reached up, covering Steve’s hands with his.  “Okay,” he said.  “I”m-”  He nodded, as much as Steve’s grip would let him.  “Fine.  I’m fine.”
Steve went by so fast that he was just a streak, a blur of brilliant color in the cold, gray light.  Tony blinked at the empty hall, confused.  “Steve?”
“I'll do my best,” Jane said, never breaking eye contact with Thor.  He scooped her up, his broad hands cupping her narrow waist, lifting her off her feet to spin her around.  She was laughing as she threw her arms around his neck.
Steve caught himself grinning.  “Not my room,” he said.  “Talk to Tony.” He reached out, his fingers trailing over the soft surface of one of the pillows.  “Preferably when I'm not there.”
"Wonderful," Steve said.  He let his head fall into the cradle of his palm.  "Tony.  In all seriousness."
Her eyes went up, staring at the inside of the hat’s brim.  Tony wondered if it was as bad from her angle as it was from his.  “I kinda like it,” she said, folding her arms on the table.  “I mean, the color’s a little much, but-” She bounced up and down in her seat, making the brim bob.  “It’s fun!”
“I get to stop hearing questions that I don’t want to acknowledge, let alone answer, and you get to have a new, fresh child to spoil within an inch of his life.”  Tony gave a firm nod.  “The other one was getting large and awkward, he’s no longer cute, it’s, it’s not a thing anymore when he shoves half his face into a blueberry pie, remember when that was cute and not just a cause for concern?”
“That didn’t work the last two times you tried to use it as an excuse, and it’s certainly not going to work now, so can we-”
“Get your own jar,” Clint said, but he handed it over anyway.  “And yeah.  He seems dedicated.  To what, who knows?  But something.”
Tony nodded. "Come see me next year. I could always use a businessman of your..." He chuckled. "Unique talents."
“So the council has him loaded onto a stretcher, and they carry him out there, and toss him into the hut, and all go back to the city to congratulate themselves and be smug, which is what they do on almost a daily basis, so, not much of a change there.”  She took a couple of quick bites of the stew.  “And then everyone settles in to wait.
That was apparently enough to whet his curiosity, and DJ hopped over.  "Hands," she said, with a smile, and glanced over at Tony again before holding them out.  Sue scrubbed lightly at one, and then the other, taking a moment to tickle his palm with the wipe and run it between each finger.  When she was done, she leaned back.  "There we go.  Ready for high fives and smoothies."
His lips were red from the wine, and Steve found he was having trouble breathing.  “Can we discuss this, then?” he asked.   He looked up, and around the room.  “Because.  If you’d asked me what my worst case scenario was this morning, it’d be that you made your money through organized crime and somehow kept that quiet.  Instead-”
“Yes, well, none of us sleep on good nights,” Tony said.  His head fell back against Steve’s shoulder.  “And this isn’t going to be a good night.  Is it.”
“You sure?  Because this looks like it could use something.”  Jesse leaned back, one finger tapping her chin.  “Like pushpins and red string to thread between pictures.”
“He is only the owner,” Okoye said.  “As the head of security?”  She gave him a pleasant smile.  “I make sure he does not have to have a problem with it.”  She stabbed a finger in his direction.  “No minors.”
"Yeah, the flu's a bitch, isn't it?" Steve said.  He slid his arms under Tony's arms, and braced his feet.  "Okay, up we go."
“No,” Clint said, the word drawn out to a painful extent.  Nat buried her head in her folded arms, which did nothing to stifle the sound of her laughter, and he elbowed her.  “No.  That would be-”
"You're lucky you're cute," she said with a smirk before turning her attention to Steve.  "Where would you be without it?"
Jarvis paused, his face unreadable.  “Sir’s father was…  Not an easy man to please,” he said at last.  “He was mercurial.  Sharp tongued.  Self-involved and self-sufficient.  Capable of both grand gestures and casual, off-hand cruelty.  He was a difficult employer.” He met Steve’s eyes.  “And I had no interest in earning his affection.
Ellen considered her shelf of tea cups.  “You get the ugly cup,” she declared.  “Because you're being a bitch.”
"Mockery," Tony said, handing her a sheet of technical specs.  "All around me, nothing but mockery."
“Right.”  Tony nodded.  “If I end up dead, drag my body down into the basement and tell everyone I’m drunk.  It's logical and believable, you can make it work for at least a few months.”
“Thank you, Mr. Jarvis.”  Steve handed over his hat, and considered the bag.  “Is Miss Potts available?”
“And if you blow something up,” Marcy added, “do it off site, we don't have the budget to clean it up.”
Tony pointed at Rhodey.  “Don't think I don't know why you're here,” he said.  “I absolutely know why you're here.”
This time, Steve went, falling willingly back onto the pillows.  He grinned up at Tony.  “Looking forward to it.”
“Bullshit,” Tony said, stepping into the room.  His hands were tucked in his pockets, the relaxed pose belayed by the tension in his shoulders.  “Stane said you had him.”
“I’m glad.  But both of us did some pretty stupid stuff, and we made everyone worry, and they’re mad, and that’s something that your dad and I have to work on.”  Steve’s thumb bounced against the steering wheel.  “But no one’s mad at you, Deej.  If you want tacos-”
“It’s a ‘I doubt I could stop you, even if I tried,’” Tony said.  He jammed a whole cookie in his mouth.  “I’m accepting my fate.”
Rhodes' eyes flicked up to meet Steve's in the rear view mirror.  "The man needs to keep his job," he said, his voice laconic.  "Times are tough, Miss Potts."
Tony reached the main hall and ducked around the staircase, to the small alcove built beneath the stairs.  For a moment, he thought he’d gotten it wrong.  The small lounging sofa appeared to be empty, and the water in the fountain spilled down into the shell that formed its base in near silence.
“There was trouble at the university,” she said, and there was a faint tremor to her voice, her hands shaking as she helped him do up the buttons.  “Ty-”
“Bunch of useless, self-important, sanctimonious assholes,” Tony mumbled into his water bottle.  “My kid’s got better taste than you.  Hell, my kid can cook better than most of you.”
Greer made a face.  “No, I know the rules, I promise, I’m trying not to make things weird.” Her tail flicked behind her before settling down again, a nervous twitch of movement.  “I thought you could-” She gave him a hopeful smile, her eyebrows arching.  “Help?”
One of these days, he'd get used to the pet names.  It wasn't like Tony hadn't called him ridiculous things before they got married, but somehow, it was different now.  It wasn't, he knew it wasn't, but it felt like it was.   Steve paused.  Apparently, he was losing his mind.
“Look, he apparently needed the bed, and I'm just being a good host and letting him have it,” Tony said.  His head fell back against the smooth tile of the shower with a thud.  “I live to be a good host.”
“So did we.  Enough to form  a theory,” she said.  “A good, working theory.  Not to hard to test it, either.”
“Mmmm, you do enjoy living beyond your means,” Okoye said.  She paused, looking down at Peter, who curled into himself, his eyes huge as he peered back at her.  “Ah.  This one survived as well.  Shuri will be pleased.”
“Hey, Doc,” Clint said, already pouring a cup of coffee.  “You want to tell the copper where Nat found me?”
Steve caught his elbow, loving him so much it hurt.  “Time to face the music,” he said, steering Tony towards Bobbi and the car.  His fingers tightened.   “Tony, we need to find Stane.  He…” His jaw tightened.  “He might be involved with DJ’s disappearance.”
“That is absolutely incorrect,” Rhodey said, flipping through one of Peter’s old school books.  “Multiplication-”
“See?” Shuri said to Okoye, gesturing at her brother.  “This is the encouragement I need to grow and thrive.”
DJ held up his hands, his little face screwing up as he considered the filthy palms.  Then he reached back and wiped both of them along the side of Tony's leg.  "Yes," he said.
Riri's head swung towards Bruce.  Bruce never looked up from his work, his big hands manipulating strands of sugar as thin as a hair with speed and accuracy.  "Ms. Williams, in this kitchen, when you are given an assignment, what do you say?"
“No,” Harris said, and his voice was shaking.  “No.  You won’t.”  He swung the broom out of her reach.  “I’m getting the impression that we’re all somehow beneath your notice, and well that might be true, a minute and a half we were in a cheap ass hotel in Vegas trying not to get arrested, and all of sudden we’re not, and we didn’t get a choice or a vote and we are doing our fucking best in a really difficult situation, and yes.” He leaned in.  “You.  Owe.  Us.  An explanation.”
DJ let out a giggle, and Steve looked down at his robe.  “It’s a little fluffy,” he admitted with a smile.  “More your sort of thing than mine.”
A muscle in Steve's jaw jumped.  "I think I'd prefer the firing squad," he gritted out.  "That, at least I'd understand.  This?"  He nodded at the door.  Security was doing a good job at keeping the press and assorted gawkers at bay, but the plaza was packed with bodies, jostling for space and a good angle.  "This is so far from my frame of reference that I just want to lean out and ask them if there isn't something better they could be doing."
“Might be,” Tony agreed.  Inside the plastic bag, there was a brown paper one that had been folded over and stapled shut.  He ripped it open, pushing packets of sauce, utensils and napkins to the side to get to the food underneath.  He pulled out the white containers, checking each one and setting them aside until he found the spring rolls.
He let out a breath that he hadn’t even realized he’d been holding.  “Thank you,” he said, the words coming without thought, without effort.  “Is Pepper up in the office?”
“That well,” Rhodey said.  He rubbed a hand across the back of his neck.  “He’s going to be in a mood.”
"Is that a no?" Steve asked, almost sing-song, his eyes bright beneath the heavy weight of his wet hair.
He clambered to his feet, and tapped his fingers against the table.  Furbro raised his head, and DJ held out a hand.  Furbro crawled into his hand, and curled up there, instead, a perfect circle of green.  DJ focused on that.  “Can we go?”  The words were balanced.  Equal.  Rhythm.  Breath.
Tony nodded.  “There used to be a swing on the old oak there, on the North shore,” he said.  “I think it's long gone, though.”  He reached for a pad of paper, drawing a few idle lines on it.  It wouldn't be hard to put another one up, rope and a solid board, find a solid limb...  He tapped the tip of his pencil against the page.  “Do you know how to swim?” he asked DJ.  DJ nodded, and Tony smiled.  “Aren't you a clever little monkey?”
“No,” Harris repeated.  He gave a nod, his fingers flexing on the handle of the broom.  “Thanks.”  And with that, he simply swung the broom around, set the head of it against the staffer’s chest, and shoved.  The staffer yelped, more in surprise than anything else, as the chair tipped backwards.  He went over, his arms and legs flailing as he crashed to the ground.
Steve pressed a hand to his face. “Do you think that’s comforting?” he asked, and he wondered if he sounded as exhausted as he felt.
“Because I am the only one who can make your toast the way you like it,” Jarvis said without missing a beat.
DJ raised one arm, giving him a thumb’s up.  After a moment, his arm flopped back to the floor.  Slink, crouched down beside his head, nuzzled his temple, and DJ’s head lolled to the side.
“Wonderful.”  Tony straightened up and glanced at the rearview mirror.  About what he had expected, but then again, he was a pessimist.  “Where’s Lewis?”
“You need more than that?” Clint asked.  DJ nodded, but he was already holding up socks, staring at them with narrowed eyes as he tried to make pairs.  “Okay, well, I’ve got presents to wrap and also I hate sorting the recycling.”
"Have you talked to them?" Jan shot back, her lips pursed.  "'Smart' and 'hot' are not mutually exclusive.”  She looked at Steve.  “Sure, some models are about as deep as a puddle in the middle of a heatwave.  But not all of them.  Not even most of them.”  She crossed her arms over her chest.  “Stop judging people based on how they make their living, Steve.”
Laughing, he pulled back, wiping soda off of his lips and chin with the back of his hand.  The foam was still pouring out of the neck of the bottle and he licked at the glass.
Harris stalked into the suite, and Tony grinned.  “For off the rack?  They did a good job.”  He picked up a platter.  “Want a waffle?”
"Ain't our fault you can't outrun ol' Hammer hands," one of the boys shot back, but they scattered in front of him, feet clattering along the worn wood of the hall.
Agatha watched him go, one eyebrow arched.  “I am not certain that his intervention is desired, or needed,” she said.
Tony looked up, and Clea was there, in front of him, her face unreadable.  “If you’re not here to bring them both back,” he said, his chest aching, “then go.”
It stopped.  Every fragment, every drop.  Froze.  And as he watched, his heart pounding in his ears, the droplets combined, flowing back into each other.  Without the benefit of the cup, the tea curled back into itself, and then, once it had found its form, the cup fragments fell into place around it.  Each shattered flake, back where it had been, a soft, diffused light rolling across the surface, erasing cracks, erasing time, and the cup fell back into his hand.
There was a faint beep from his phone, and then Steve's voice. “Hi! I'm either out of range, or not available. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks!”
Harris wasn’t really listening any more.  He looked out across the cafeteria, and it was a sea of movement and noise and chaos and he didn’t understand what had happened.  What had happened.  What had that thing been, where had it come from?  How did it end up here?
DJ didn’t even have time to fire the repulsors.  Before he even realized he was back in something resembling reality, he was already crashing into it.  The next few seconds was chaos, as he hit, and bounced, and hit again, his arms flailing as he tried to slow himself down.
“If that's true, no wonder no one in this city dates,” Steve mumbled, right before the door to the Tower opened.
He split the difference, setting his hand in Rogers'.  He had a moment to savor the expression of confusion and shock that slid over Rogers' face, and then he leaned in.  “Officer?” he said, his voice a silken, husky purr.  “When it's done right, your partner doesn't have the energy, the breath, or the spare brainpower to talk.”
Outside of the car, the scenery flashed past, brief glimpses of rolling hills and strands of trees, houses peeking through the fog.  Tony rested his hand against the window, his fingers curled into a fist.  “Time we may not have.”
His mother waited, patient and quiet.  Steve looked at her.  “Something just as scary,” he admitted.
Tony looked out the window.  The trellis stretched to the ground, a seemingly impossible distance below them.  “I know he’s a climber, but he wouldn’t…”  His voice trailed away.  He looked at Steve.  “Would he?”
“I never have,” Steve said, but Tony was already moving away, and Steve watched him go, hating how he could never seem to figure out how to make Tony stay.
She stopped, and Steve shifted in his seat.  “If no one's buying, then-" His voice trailed away, the question implied rather than spoken.
“Always thinking of me, aren't you?” Steve asked.  But instead of putting his soda down and taking it by hand, he leaned forward, his lips parting.  Before Tony realized what he intended, he'd taken a bite, his lips brushing against Tony's fingertips.
Phil scribbled his signature on a page and tossed it aside.  “And since I’m on better terms with the CEO of StarkIndustry than just about anyone at SHIELD, it’s fairly logical that I’m going to be the one who’s going to toddle over there, hat in hand, to ask if she happens to know what has happened to one third of our local superhero team and a couple of low level SHIELD employees-”  He leaned forward.  “It’s going to be me, Clint.  So.  No.  Not your best idea.”
"Where were the two of you when we were getting married?" Tony asked, reaching for his jacket.  "Day late and a dollar short, both of you."  He shrugged into it, his shoulders rolling with the movement.  It settled around him, perfectly tailored to every line of his body, and Steve wanted to take it right back off of him.  He tucked his hands in his pockets, mostly to keep himself out of trouble.
Tony glanced back at him, a smile curling his lips.  “Probably,” he said, his voice laconic.  “It’s your room, after all.” He held up an arm, watching as the sleeve slid back to settle against his elbow, the fireplace poker held almost like a sword. “It would make perfect sense that this is your shirt.”
“He asked who pitches and who catches,” Natasha said, and it took a second for Tony's brain to make that metaphor work.   When it clicked, he winced.
“This particular caller is on the 'do not send to voice mail or you will regret it' list,” Jarvis said. He sounded tired. “Pick up the phone, sir.”
Steve took a deep breath.  “Everyone at my wedding is either dressed as Tony Stark, or is a Tony Stark, aren’t they?” he said, and Tony started to laugh. Steve grinned down at him, ignoring the way his eyes burned.
“Know what would?” Steve bounced the knuckles of a fisted hand against the window, almost grateful for the sharp, hard sting as they impacted.  “Your foot.  On the gas.”
“Yeah.  And in the middle of that something, you stopped to get your costume fixed, and I figured that I had time to stand in the longest line known to man to get the worst churro in the world, and look.” She waved the churro at him like a wand, her eyebrows arching.  “I was right.  Cause you’re still standing here.  Navel gazing.”
“All the normal girls had you,” Jess said without missing a beat.  Carol kicked her chair.  “But you're one thing.  Tony's altogether another.”
"Human shield, that's me," Carol said, her hands on her hips.  “And Nat's bringing Clint, he's used to being collateral damage.”
“I do-” Steve choked on a breath, burying his face in Tony’s shoulder.  “I have my moments.”  His hand brushed against the bandage wrapped around Tony’s ribs, and he went still.  “You’re hurt.”
“Everyone’s getting a bad tourist t-shirt,” Steve said.  “Can I talk to Tony if speakerphone is involved?”
Tony pointed a bishop at him.  “And you’ve seen me do far worse, so I’m not certain why you’re surprised.”  He straightened up. “What difference does-”
Tony braced his hands on the arm of the couch on either side of Clint’s head, leaning over him.   “State your terms, you second rate, knockoff Robin Hood.”
“Okay, that’s enough,” Steve said, and it wasn’t loud, it wasn’t angry, it was just…  Firm.  Absolutely certain.  And DJ froze, his eyes wide.
Pepper looked over the rim of her coffee cup at him.  “He’s coming back,” she said, with the flat voice of a woman who was not interested in humoring his melodramatic ass.  “I thought you said you were going out with Rhodey tonight.”
“I can't, not tonight,” Jan said.  She reached for her wrap and then paused.  “Do you still have that French chef?”
The door to the bathroom opened, and Clint leaned in.  “Not to put any pressure on you here, but people are done eating and if we don't get them up from the tables soon, someone's gonna get bored and invent something we all regret.”  He checked his reflection in the mirror.  “I told Jan putting the Hanks at the same table was a bad idea for so many reasons, but right now, they're out there arguing who could make a better bomb with stuff found only on the buffet.”
The screams built, pressing in on on sides, and Tony barely noticed.  He lashed out with a foot, catching the man in the side of the knee, following that up with an elbow to the face.  They went down, Tony stumbling to his knees as the man flailed backwards, towards the street.  The gun stabilized, coming around, and Tony was on his knees, was out of space, was out of tricks.
“Of course.” Tony waited until he left the room before he stood, straightening his shirt.  He was a mass of wrinkles at this point, and there was little he could do about it, but he also didn’t want to waste the time it would take him to change.
Clint flicked a salute in his direction, and Carol nodded.  “Bruce would probably appreciate it if you took over the Tony-sitting duty, honestly,” she said, running one hand over her head.  Her hair sprang right back into place.
“Yes,” DJ said.  He pulled the hood of his sweatshirt back over his head, letting the flower crown peek out from  under the fabric.  He smiled at Steve.  “Ties are horrible.”
Happy grinned at him in the rearview mirror, one hand resting easily on the steering wheel.  “Sure.  I’d wait here for you, but-”
“Didn’t you do that yesterday?” Tony asked.  Dummy nodded, his claw bouncing up and down.  The papers in the folder flapped wildly with the movement.  Tony sighed.  “Aren’t you done yet?”
“Portmanteau,” Tony explained, rubbing his forehead.  “When the public or press smashes two names together.  Like, you know, Bennifer.”
“You are about as threatening as a slightly confused baby duck, stop it,” Tony said, almost amused by this.  But mostly concerned.  “I do not need to explain to your supervisor or your girlfriend how a knockoff Captain America threw you through a display of out of print commemorative plates.  Get-”
“And I have no interest to know who you are,” she said, her voice crisp.  “And I shall not-” was as far as Agatha got before Harris bonked her in the head with the handle of his broom.
“You know, I thought we were doing so well, sitting quietly and avoiding drawing attention to ourselves,” Tony’s agent said under his breath.  “And you just had to go and fuck that up.”
“And that's because you aren't paying attention,” she said, patting his arm.  “Let's go get a tart.”
Steve nodded, a slow, deliberate dip of his chin.  “That you did,” he said.  He picked up his book, pulling out a folded piece of paper from under the cover.  Tony watched, amused, as he flattened it out, holding it up in front of them.  “Gone to Vegas.  Back in a few days,” Steve read aloud, his voice droll.
Steve raised his shirt, wiping his face with the bottom of it, and Tony wasn't sure what he was trying to accomplish, because his shirt was just as wet as his face, but his stomach was a work of goddamn art, all firm muscle and pale, almost invisible hair peeking up above the waistband of his sagging shorts.  Steve looked up, and Tony made a deliberate attempt to look him in the eye.  Steve nodded.  “I could make you.”
“Yeah, that's...  That's probably going to happen again,” Tony admitted.  He pushed himself to his feet.  “You have breakfast yet?”
He paused.  “When you have the funds, a great many things are for sale.”  He looked at Steve with steady eyes.  “And far easier to lose, if you have made an error in judgement.”
A finger caught his chin, forcing his head up, and Tony stared blankly forward.  Obie’s face floated in the center of his vision, a strange, almost curious look on his face.  “That was quicker than I expected.”  His hand turned, his fingers sinking into Tony’s jaw.  “It seems I’m not the only one drinking on an empty stomach this morning.”
“No.  If you would, please, I’d like you to go back and reassure the rest of his family that he made the trip safely, and that after we’ve seen DJ-”  He looked at Steve.  “We’ll figure out what’s going to happen.”
“I'm going to remind you,” Natasha said, her voice bored, “once again, that you know absolutely nothing about women.”
“I’m not spending the entire weekend in the backseat of a car,” Tony told him.  “I mean, I’ve done it before, but not a rental car.”
“Well, you're sitting on the roof of a warehouse, some people would interpret that as 'not really fine,' so you can see-”
"Oh, you don't have two already?" Ellen asked, utterly deadpan. She leaned an elbow on the arm of her chair and braced her chin on her hand. "I have two."
“‘Cause you’ve started to figure this place out,” Clint said.  “Anyway, so Stark just stared at me, this amused, perplexed look on his face, and then he walks across the room, reaches out-” Clint picked up Steve’s coffee cup, his fingers light and delicate on handle.  “And takes the vase from me.  He smiled.  He nods.  And he started talking to me in French.”
DJ nodded.  "Trains," he said, picking up Tony's spoon and rolling the stem between his fingertips.  "And animals."
She paused, one hand resting on the counter just in front of the overturned bottle.  “Really,” she said.  She picked it up by the neck, tipping the label towards the light.  “I could use one.” Her eyes came up to meet his.  “What’s in it?”
Steve shook his head.  “What’s the difference between believing and knowing?” he asked, for the lack of anything else to say.
Peter let out a long, sustained groan, curling up in a ball.  Tony nodded.  “Right.  Coffee.  Everyone gets coffee.  And anyone who can tell me what the hell happened between me drinking my weight in booze and Parker reliving the nifty fifties trips to the soda fountain gets breakfast, too.”
Nicholas released him, making a show of rotating his shoulder.  “As well as could be expected, for an old man.”
It wasn't what he'd expected, but seeing Steve here, in the midst of it, seemed perfectly natural.  Perfectly comfortable.
“He can’t do it, Steve,” Sam said, dumping a healthy amount of mapo tofu onto his rice.  He waved the serving spoon in Tony’s direction.  “All talk, no action.”
“Answers.”  Everyone looked at Jarvis.  “He’s looking for answers.  Despite the fact that he only knows half the questions he should be asking.”  His eyes were sharp, when he looked up.  “The shooter is one thing.  The person who hired him is another.  But beyond that, he wants…”
“It's okay, I don't think Tony's very good at being wooed,” Sam told him.  “Matched set.  And hey, you've already got a foot in the door.”
Tony’s stomach rolled over. “Obie’s never home on Tuesday,” he said, ripping his shirt off and tossing it towards the bench.  A wave of ash and dust floated to the floor.  Without being asked, Pepper held out a clean shirt, and he stepped into it. “Pep.  He never-”
Peter blinked at him, eyes red rimmed.  “Every one?” he asked, and the words broke on a watery, wobbly giggle.
Tony's fingers slid over the front of his shirt, digging into the fabric.  He took a deep breath, trying to ignore the way his heartbeat was pounding in his ears.  “Really?  I wouldn't know,” he said, with a smile.  “Now.  If you'll excuse me.  I'm afraid I have something I need to do before dinner.”
In the front vestible, just inside the front door, Pepper was crouched down, face to face and eye to eye with a little dark haired boy.  Tony watched, confused, as she pulled the child's cap off, smoothing his hair down with careful fingers.  "There we go," she said, smiling at him.  She turned the hat over in her hands, trying to flatten the fabric.  “This is too small for you, isn't it?  Maybe we'll talk to May, she'll get us some better clothes for you.”
“Right.”  Tony let him go, letting Steve slip free of his grip.  “Now.”  Steve looked at him, and Tony gave him a bright smile.  “You’ll eat something now.”
“So.  If you’re asking me what he’s thinking?” Rhodey asked.  Steve nodded.  “Then I think he got what he wanted and now he’s wondering how you’ll take it.”  His face relaxed into a grin.  “But I’d also say that since you seem as panicky about it as he is, then it’ll be fine.”
Tony's vision blurred over, and he realized he'd been staring at the wall as if held the secrets of the universe.  He blinked hard.  “I think I just got shampoo in my eyes,” he said.
“You two can take the same suite you used the last time,” Tony said, his fingers beating a rapid tattoo on the steering wheel.  “Pretty sure it’s been updated recently.  Pepper made me redo all of them.  Said it was good for property values, but honestly, I think she just likes interior decorating and spending my money.”
Steve’s face heated, and he didn’t know why, or maybe he was just too much of a coward to think about it.  “Tony…”
And it was childish, it was absolutely childish, but he turned and walked out, pulling the office door shut behind him.  Something shattered in the room behind him, and it took everything he had to not go back.
“And I thought, maybe Bruce, but-” Steve’s weight shifted, and he caught Tony’s right arm.  “This is the chemical structure of, what?”
The liquor burned in his mouth, and Tony made a deliberate effort to swallow.  It hurt, the whole way down.  “What?” he said, with a tight smile.  He set his empty tumbler down on the desk.  “You think I won’t?”
Steve gave him a look, but there was a smile tugging at the corners of his tight mouth.  “All of them,” he said, reaching past Tony to press the button.
“You are trying to kill me,” Iron Man said, and Tony hated him for having the breath to form words.  “I am an old man, and every time you pull this shit, you take another ten years off of my life, and guess what, kid?  I don’t have that many years to give up.  You pull this, and I’m-”
“Houdini knew something we didn’t,” he said, the words coming out in a rush, and the man’s finger paused on the surface of his phone.
A familiar car pulled up into the protected loading zone in front of the doors, catching Steve's attention.  Steve tapped DJ lightly on the head.  “Think Val and Franklin are here,” he said, and DJ's head shot up.  He scrambled to his feet with more energy than grace, all coltish awkwardness.
Steve watched as she filled the bowl, cradling the well worn china in the hollow of one hand.  “But were they here?” he asked, as she set it in front of him.  “Once?”
Tony shifted his weight, risking a quick glance up the stairs towards the shop.  “Whatever you’re working on, Jan,” he said, his voice hushed, “it can wait until your parents loosen the purse strings again.  There’s no reason for you to-”
Steve glanced at him, not sure how to handle that question.  "Because my Ma liked Steve?" he managed at last, his lips twitching.
Clint took a deep, broad bow.  “The circus,” he agreed.  “The perfect place for a runaway from Iowa to pick up a bit of everything.  A bit of wire walking.  A bit of trapeze artistry.  A bit of juggling, and knife throwing and animal training and contortion work.”
"Went to try to recover his truck," Tony said.  "Since, you know, he forgot Kamala is a force of nature and now she's met Isaiah, which went far too well, so now they're plotting some sort of takeover of something, it might be the US Government, and Steve is absolutely fucked."
Tony bit back a smile.  Rogers was trying so hard for polite subservience, and failing so miserably.  It wasn't nice, and it wasn't smart, but something about his frustration and disapproval just brought out the worst in Tony.  The grouchier he got, the harder it was for Tony not to pull his proverbial pigtails.
DJ smiled.  “Was...  Different before.”  His eyelashes fluttered.  “Didn't think.  Much.  Things were simpler.  I was simpler.”
Steve stared at him, caught somewhere between laughing and outright frustration.  Tony, reading him like a book like always, just braced his elbows on the table, lacing his fingers together and leaning his chin on them.  "I mugged a waiter in the back alley," he said, one eyebrow arching.
“Because I need to know if they’re coming back for him,” Tony said.  He set the pawn back down.  “So what do you mean by ‘long gone?’  Did they leave him, or are they…”
Obie straightened his jacket with a flick of his hands, glaring at Jarvis as he stalked past.  As he approached the bed, Bruce collected his tray of instruments.  “I’ll just, I’ll go clean up,” he said, his head down.  “If you need me?”
“You can seduce me pretty much by breathing, but I wouldn't object some poetry thrown in there,” Steve said.  He leaned a shoulder against the wall, his smile warm as he looked at Tony.  “It couldn't hurt.”
“As many as I can.”  Steve took a deep breath, and tried not to think about how much it hurt.  “That’s what you goddamn do, Tony.  You save the ones you can, the ones you can reach.  Maybe it’s one or two, maybe it’s ten, but you save the ones you can, and you keep doing it, you keep trying, because the rest of us don’t have the privilege of waiting around until the system changes, until everything’s perfect.
On the end of the bed, the cat stood and stretched, its back arching as it yawned.  Tony squinted at it.  “You have a cat?” he asked.
“No,” he said to Tony, and Sue had no idea how he'd gotten up next to her without her noticing, but he was there now, inches from her side, a beautiful little boy with huge dark eyes and a wide smile.
She flipped through the pages in the folder.  “A thwarted attempt to steal the payroll of a factory down in the slums.  An armed gang war stopped before it had a chance to start.  A corrupt ward boss who’d been setting up ‘soup kitchens’ that never actually served a single bowl to the starving people he claimed to serve had a change of heart and fled the city with a suitcase and his tail between his legs.  Men trying to rob cargo from the docks found someone waiting for them.  They were forced to jump into the river to escape.”
“How are you like this?” Bucky said.  “I’ve known you my entire life, but I gotta ask, how are you like this?”
With a sigh, Rhodey leaned back in his chair.  “Are you…  Bothered by it?” he asked, and Steve got the feeling he was choosing his words very, very carefully.
“It’s been more than ten years for me,” Steve admitted, not that anyone was paying attention to him.  Jess patted him on the shoulder.  It was more reassuring than it should’ve been.  “They’re not wrong, though.”
It threw him back again, but this time, Harris was there, catching him before he could end up back on the floor.  Strange reached out, his hand passing easily into the portal.  Confused, Harris did the same, his fingers passing the barrier with only the slightest resistance.  It felt like plunging his hand into half-solidified Jell-O, cool and thick, but certainly nothing that could stop him.
“I kind of am, and that seems like the wrong reaction,” Tony said, and Steve kissed him on the temple, knocking his baseball cat askew.  Tony gave him a joking shove, and Steve leaned into his hand.
“No.” Clint held up his hands. “No.  This is getting-” He stabbed a finger at one Stephen Strange, and the the other.  They both opened their mouths, and Clint threw his hands in the air.  “First guy in a red cape who says anything is going to get an arrow in an incredibly sensitive portion of his anatomy.”
The sound of a phone alarm cut him off, almost mid-word.  Startled, he looked over to the counter, where he'd thrown Tony's jacket.  He grabbed it, pulling Tony's phone out of the pocket.  He frowned down at the face of it.  “Fifteen Minute Warning,” it read, and he canceled the alarm with a flick of his thumb.  “Hey, Tony, what is the alarm for?”
Big dark eyes considered her, then blinked with slow deliberation.  His head tipped to the side, his eyes flicking towards Hammer, and Pepper could almost see the gears turning in his mind mind as he weighed his options.  Pepper waited, struggling to keep a straight face, as he came to his conclusion.
He gave the door a perfunctory rap with is knuckles before shoving it open.  “Banner.  Rise and shine.  I gave you a bed. In a room named for it.  And yet you persist in sleeping on a nasty ass couch that I think you collected off of a curb sometime in the mid-nineties, did you do this specifically to make me insane?  I don’t mean to sound egotistical, but I think you do this to make me insane, there’s really no other-”
He stopped, catching himself halfway gone to a fantasy of mingled loads of laundry and half-finished Sunday Times Crossword puzzle.  He was losing his mind.  He was absolutely losing his mind.  He had a laundry service for a reason; no part of his fantasy life should involve the phrase, 'are these my socks or yours?'
She smiled at Callie. “Hello, Callie,” she said, her voice full of warmth.  “We've been looking for you.”
Jan tucked her notebook away in her bag.  “And I do,” she said.  “But it's been forever since I've been by, Tony just doesn't entertain the way he used to.”
For a long, still moment, DJ studied him, his dark eyes bright.  He looked down at Furbro.  "It lives," he said at last, and Steve smiled.
“Tony’s pacing around my apartment, trying to talk Pepper into lending him the private jet without actually telling her what’s going on.”
The woman pointed at them, a spill of words washing over them.  The boy blinked at them.  "English?" he asked, his voice curious.
“Yes,” DJ said,  he held up a hand towards the screen, and Tony tapped his hand against DJ's on the screen.  DJ grinned.  “Feel better?”
There was the sound of a scuffle, and then the woman’s voice again.  “Hey, it’s Carol,” she said.  “We’re in the SUV.  Tony’s driving, Rhodey’s riding shotgun, Peter’s on time out in between me and Jess, and Clint’s in the trunk.”
“Which is why I called her,” Marcy said.  “We need to get our ducks in a row before things get even more out of control than they already are.”  She leaned forward.  “Captain Rogers, I apologize for this, I know we've just met, but I'm going to need to be very blunt.”
Tony finished wiping down his station with his usual obsessive attention to detail before he straightened up.  “Still down in Washington with Isaiah,” he said, frowning at a smudge on the gleaming metal countertop.  He bent over it, scrubbing with more enthusiasm than the small spot really warranted.  “I don’t think he’s coming back.”
Tony, his hair a tangle and his cheeks flushed, leaned towards the camera, his eyes narrowed with suspicion.  “Is this thing on?” he asked.
“You do realize that the whole hat and hoodie combination does absolutely nothing to hide your identity, right?” Tony asked, and he was proud of himself, he was so proud of himself, because there wasn’t so much as a hint of a tremor to his voice.  He smiled, tight and thin, his gaze level.  “It has fooled exactly no one through the years.”
Rogers' mouth opened, and closed.  Tony could almost see him gather himself.  “And the bomb damage down on the garden wall?”
“I don’t know,” Steve said.  “And that’s…  That’s the problem.  I thought I knew who you were.  I thought I understood what I was getting into, but I don’t.  And I didn’t.  And-”  He took a deep breath.  “And I-”
Obie fished his pocket watch out of his vest, squinting down at the face.  “Actually, I have a meeting,” he said, his voice jovial.  “So I'll leave you to it.”  He gave the boy a considering look.  “Talk to May,” he said to Pepper.  “I've got the press coming by to get some pictures, but I'd like him to be a bit more...”  He wobbled a hand through the air.  “Let's aim for presentable.  Nothing too fancy, all right?”
Tony glanced up.  “Photo ops,” he said, reaching for the mask in Steve's hand.  “Lean over.”  Steve bent forward, just a bit, and Tony slipped the mask over his head, tucking the elastic in place behind Steve's ears.  Steve's eyes fluttered shut, his lips falling open as Tony's fingers smoothed his hair down.  “There.”
“I-” Tony’s eyes slid shut.  “Yes.  I do.  I…  Like him.”  The words were all he could manage, all he was willing to admit, but they hurt.  It hurt to say them, in a way that he couldn’t quite explain.  “So.  Leave it alone.”
For an instant, Steve went still, his skin icing over.  “I’ll…  Remember that.”  He took the watch from him.  “Thank you.”  He looked up and met Tony’s eyes.  “What do I owe you?”
Harris lay there, gasping for breath, one leg tangled in an upturned chair, his shoulder lying in an upturned bowl of tomato soup. His head spinning, his chest aching, he tried to push himself up.  The thing that had hit him, human sized and human shaped, but red and silver and metal, was rolling now, across the floor, under a table, and it was better at this than he was, finding cover, finding its balance, and he had an instant to see the light gleaming across its surface, and then it was gone.
“Claymation is unnatural,” Tony said.  “It is, I don't have many strong opinions on many things, Pepper-”
Steve's eyes closed.  “Just because I couldn't be a hero, doesn't mean you'd have to give it up, too.”  He sounded tired. Resigned.
Harris nodded.  “Okay.  C’mon, we’ll go dig through my closet and find you something you’ll be comfortable in.  Otherwise, it’ll be airport tourist t-shirts for everyone.”
Steve hunched forward over his cup of water.  “Shut up,” he mumbled.  Sam grinned at him, and Steve took a petulant sip of his water.  “I just wanted-” He sighed.  “I don't know what I wanted.”
“Because I’ve missed your humming, so you’re going to take pity on me for like five minutes, kid, and you’re going to go around to the other side of the car, cover your ears, and make Hawklie over there play ‘Name That Tune.’”
“Yeah, lucky we got it before Hammer knew it was here,” he said, scratching his head and leaving his hair a tangled mess.  “Tell him it was great?”
“This may shock you, Steven, but I do not give a damn about the milk.” Tony pulled him into the elevator and immediately maneuvered him up against the wall.  Steve tugged him close, leaning in for a kiss.  “I love you.”
Tony took a sip of his coffee.  It tasted coppery and sharp on his tongue.  His throat hurt.  “You any good at it?”
“I'm thinking a basic engraved one hundred pound linen stock,” she said.  “I like the texture, and anything more just makes it look like you're trying too hard, honestly.”
He blinked.  He hadn't even heard Sam come up behind him.  “Sorry,” he said, setting the box down on the foyer table.  “I was-  I was just-”  He didn't know how to finish that sentence, so he went with, “Were you saying something?”
Tony laughed.  “And what would you have for Christmas, then?” he asked, his head tipping back to meet Steve’s eyes.  “I could barely get you to take this jacket, and as soon as you could, you foisted it right back on me.”
The boy ducked away from him, moving back and behind Pepper, his hand reaching up to grab hers.  She took it.  "This is Mr. Stane," she said, a polished smile on her face.  The boy looked up at her, and she gave him a reassuring smile.  "Don't worry.  He doesn't live here."
Steve shifted in his chair, his legs kicking the air as he tried to find a comfortable position.  “Are there fairies in America?” he repeated, rolling the bit of pencil between his fingers.  He smoothed a wrinkle out of the paper, careful not to pull too hard.  The scraps his mother salvaged from the trash at the hospital were almost always crumbled, but he preferred them to the sheets of newsprint he could find on his own.  “I was wondering.”
Sam waited patiently, and Steve exhaled, his breath curling in heavy clouds around his face.  “I realized in trouble when I realized I was fantasizing about…”  He picked up the pace, leaving Sam behind for a few steps.  “Normal life.
Steve's teeth flashed in a very dangerous, very hot grin, and Tony's breath caught in his throat.  "Actually, I think I would," he said, and he was moving forward now, towards Tony, each step deliberate.  His bare foot came down in a puddle with a splash, and Tony shivered.  Steve's head dipped forward.  "Don't you want to come out?"
“Trust me, I’m as excited about this prospect as you are,” Tony said with a wry smile.  “Probably less.  In that you’re halfway around the world with Romanov, who’s competent, and I’m about to get on what used to be my personal jet with an anxious teenager who is looks pretty much exactly like I did when I was waiting to see if my father would remember to pick me up from boarding school, except less drunk, and that’s-”  He stopped, shaking ihs head.  “Wow, that came out of nowhere.”
Tony held up the vase, and he was smiling.  “Yeah, you’re about the fifth person to contribute an arrangement,” he said.
“Oh.” Steve’s eyes snapped open again, meeting Tony’s over the bloom, and it was Tony, half hidden by flowers, those clear brown eyes blinking at him, half hidden by velvety petals.  Steve a sudden, sharp thought of how those petals would look on his skin, and his face heated.
She held up the long, uninterrupted piece of peel, and deposited it into the bowl with the others.  “I don’t think he knew how to ask, how to say what he wanted to say.”  She sliced a chunk of apple free from the core and held it out to Steve, speared on the tip of her knife.  “But he tried.”
Steve dropped the file folder on O'Brien's desk.  It hit with a thump, and O'Brien glanced up, one bloodshot eye locking on Steve with brutal intent.  "Do we have a problem here, Rogers?" he asked, his voice cutting.
“Steve, you were holding it in one hand,” Sam said.  “You popped a basketball with ONE HAND.  I don’t think I could pop a beach ball with one hand, and yet-”
Halfway to the doors, something caught his attention out of the corner of his eye.  His head swung around catching the glimpse of an elderly lady with a crown of white hair perched on one of the couches that were scattered around the lobby.  She was wearing a black pant suit, the lines clean and austere.  Her hands, folded in her lap, looked skeletal against the fabric, and her head swung slowly, her dark eyes tracking Tony as he moved across the lobby.
Natasha took a step back as Bobbi pulled the door shut, wiggling her fingers in a wave.  “Crush something for me,” she called as Bobbi pulled the car around.  She looked at Steve, and whatever she saw in his face made her smile.  “Do you have questions, officer?”
His fingers tapped on the bannister.  “Head of Security is a more nebulous concept.  It’ll be what you want to make of it.  You can take over the house security, of course, and you’ll have the run of my properties, if you want to make changes to how things are handled at the factories, you’re probably better equipped to do it than Happy would’ve been.”
“I’ll be honest,” Bobbi said, her head bent over a stack of notes, “I’m less worried about the fact that he knew him, and more that he felt he had to tell us he knew him.”  She made a see-saw motion in midair with one hand.  “He usually plays everything on a ‘need to know’ basis.”
Sam blinked at her. “My partner's over there-” he said, waving at Carol, right before Natasha shoved Peter at him.  Sam stopped.  “I guess you're my partner?”
“That's why I'm not asking him, I'm asking you,” she said, wiggling the page back and forth.  “Maybe something simpler?  Maybe calligraphy?”  Her eyes went wide.  “Ooooh, we could hire a calligraphy firm and have them done by hand, it's more expensive, but it does pack a definite-”
“You had one when you got here,” Steve grumbled.  He pushed his hair back, away from his eyes. “Almost certain you had one when you got here.”
There was a pause.  “Goddammit.  Yes, I do.”  There was the sound of pages being turned, and then, “Philip Marsham was bred to the sea as far back as the days when he was cutting his milk teeth, and he never thought he should leave it; but leave it he did, once and again, as I shall tell you.”
Tony grinned.  “Love letters and construction paper hearts and wearing my boyfriend's letterman jacket,” he agreed.
Tony tipped his head forward, looking over the top of his sunglasses down at him.  “Security breach,” he said, just to hear Steve laugh.  “How the hell did you get in here?  I have security, clearly it's not very good security, but still, there's-”
“Because I haven't receive an invitation,” Tony said, and it came out sharp and hard, sharper and harder than he'd intended, and Pepper fell silent.  Tony managed a tight smile.  “I haven't been asked.  All right?”  He picked up a tray at random.  “Now, if you're done, I need to get these into the deep freeze before I start losing my work, so, thanks, good talk.”
“I got much bigger battles to fight than if he wants to watch Star Wars,” Clint said.  “Like, seriously, Cap, the number of hills I'm willing to die on are pretty numerous, but Star Wars was not one of them.”
“It only locks from the inside,” Tony said.  “If you think it’s important, that’s just, that’s just a sacrifice you’ll have to make, I suppose.”
He opened the door and slipped through, pulling it shut behind him with an almost soundless click of the latch.  In the silence that followed, Steve heard Bucky suck in a long, slow breath.  “Well, fuck you all,” he said, his voice resigned, and Steve choked on a laugh.
“Oh!”  He choked on a laugh.  “Thank you.  That's-”  His head fell forward.  “Thank you, that's very nice of you.”  She smiled, her shoulders relaxing, and Tony smiled back. “That's very nice of you,” he repeated, right as the door to the coffee shop opened and Pepper poked her head in.
Her head came up and she looked at the sky, her hands tucked in her pockets, her body pushing forward into the slight wind.  “But it doesn’t matter, does it?  Even if I find the man who held the gun that day, there’s a dozen, a hundred more willing to pick it up before his body even hits the floor.
Tony leaned back in his chair, not so subtlety putting some distance between his throat and the lump of fur.  He considered moving DJ as well, but the thing seemed to like him.  Tony took a deep breath.  "Are we sure it's...  Domesticated?"
Over the rim of his cup, Tony watched as Steve’s face twisted into an expression he couldn’t quite understand.  He bumped his knee against Steve’s.  “Hey.  You okay?”
“I am not staying,” she said, and knowing a surrender when she heard one, she went back to the stew.  “As soon as I’ve eaten enough to sustain me for the long cold night, I’ll take my leave.”  She gave him a puckish grin.  “Fair?”
“What?”  It took a moment for that to sink in, then Steve felt his face heat.  “No.  No, I think-”  He shook his head.  “No.”
Steve wanted to scream, or cry, or both, and he was an adult, he was a grown man, whatever dignity he had left would get him through this.  “You’re so goddamn dismissive,” he said, through gritted teeth.  “So.  Just to be clear.”  He leaned forward.  “Just to be crystal clear.  I have no intention of working for you.”
“They’re very enthusiastic,” DJ said.  “Very enthusiastic.  And most humans get a headache after looking at them for more than a minute at a time.”
“He’s not allowed in the chem storage locker,” Bruce said, already scowling down at the tablet.  “My choice.  Not his.  He has different ideas of what, uh, what he should be helping with.”
The thought of Peggy didn't hurt the way it once had.  It ached, low and deep, in the parts of him that felt like they would never heal, but it wasn't something he flinched from, not anymore.  It was almost comforting, the reminder of what he had been, what he still was.  And how much of that had been tied to Peggy.
“Too late and too early,” Tony said, giving the station a cursory pass with his cloth.  “Steve’s getting you a a cab, buddy.”
Steve tried not to smile.  “I ducked that part of the ceremony,” he said.  “They left the door unlocked, so...”
“I think you’ve got this,” Phil said, and Clint stuck the bow on his head.  Phil sighed.  “It’s not my color.”
He was thankfully fully dressed when he walked out of the bathroom, because Steve was sitting up, staring out at the skyline.  Tony smoothed his tie into place.  “Morning,” he said, and Steve twisted around to face him.
Jesse leaned in.  "Only if it's true.  Only if we can prove it."  Her dark eyes were alight.  "Wanna help me prove it?"
Tony rocked back on his heels, his hands tucked in his pants pockets, his shoulders pushed back.  "It shouldn't, but for a lot of people, it will.  People will look at you differently, treat you differently, see you differently."
DJ followed his gaze.  “It's good,” he said.  He looked at Tony, his gaze steady.  “Good that it's ours.”
“I suppose so, but you’re responsible for keeping Tony from taking more than two pieces of chocolate,” she said.
“Really,” his mother said, her voice flat.  “You don’t know why you’re suddenly asking about the old ones?”  She propped a hand on her hip, her head tipped to the side.  A single curl of copper-gold hair had slipped free of her pins and she pushed it back with an impatient hand.  “Has Mrs. Doyle been filling your head with wild tales again?”
No one stopped him as Harris cut through the crowd, at something just under a sprint.  No one tried to slow him down.  No one so much as gave him as much of a second glance.  Even when he walked up to the information booth, reached in, and snagged the three ring binder from the desk, without missing a step.  The staffer looked up, surprise washing over his face, and Harris said, “I need this,” and simply walked off.
“Is she asking you to propose, or to steal third?” Tony asked, because this conversation was no longer about him, and he hated when that happened.
"Tequila?" Tony asked.  Steve gave him a look, and he subsided back onto the couch with a resigned sigh.  He accepted the blanket with a resigned look.  "A man can hope."
The way Steve saw it, he had two choices.  He could fight his way through them, or he could jump for it.  Steve cast a sharp eye towards the ink black water of the harbor.  Fighting seemed far safer.
"Huh."  Tony stroked his fingers over his goatee, his eyes narrowing in consideration.  "I could've sworn you had shoes.  Very nice new shoes."  DJ shook his head, and Tony nodded, his hands braced on his hips.  "Well, we'll just have to get you some, then."
“Patrolling the grounds again,” she said.  She paused, one eyebrow arching. “He’s quite dedicated to his job.”
Jesse gave her a look that was distinctly unimpressed.  "Shouldn't've drunk so much," she sing-songed, her head bouncing from side to side with each word.  The visual effect was enough to turn Ellen's stomach, and she slapped her pillow over her face.  "Your hangover is unimportant to me, wake up and smell the news."
Rhodey laughed, a bright, boisterous bust of sound that never failed to make Tony smile.  “I think I’m hurt, Banner.”
Tony smiled at DJ, who smiled back, his face relaxing.  “That's a cruel thing to wish on a child,” Tony said.  “And you ought to be ashamed.”
“Jail, shot, going out the window which results in you breaking your leg and also getting shot, and…” Steve prompted.
Steve leaned back in his chair with a sigh.  “The verdict is this is the worst website that I’ve ever seen.”  Tony’s lips twitched, and Steve pointed at him.  “Don’t start with me.  I know what I’m doing, Mr. Futurist.”
DJ rocked back in his chair, aware for the first time that there was a third person in the room.  And this one, he knew.
Tony reached up, flicking the tip of Steve’s nose. “I love you,” he said, and DJ bounced again.  Tony gave him a look.  “What?”
“We might’ve spilled a little,” Peter admitted.  He was almost as wet as DJ, dragging the mop behind him.  “Sorry, Aunt May.”
It was amazing how much that hurt, it was a verbal gut punch that he hadn't been expecting.  Just like that, the haze of arousal was washed away, his skin going from flushed to icy cold in an instant.  “Tony-”
Jesse yawned again.  “No, I called and asked them if they had a honeymoon suite, and if they said no, I asked if they had a high end suite.  If I got a yes to either of them, I told 'em I'd just gotten married and my baby deserved the best so money was no object, but we wanted to check in immediately.” She paused.  “I implied I was super horny.”
Reaching the center of the dance floor, he turned, taking one of Tony's hands and settling his other in the center of his back.  “I apologize in advance for stepping on your feet,” he said, as quietly as he could.
“I don’t care if it was an empty cup, it’s a biohazard and I’m going to have to clean my upholstery with fire at this point, Peter, and if I get a creme brulee torch, you’d better start running!”
He stalked up the stairs, taking them two, three at a time, his orders clutched in his hand.  He shoved the door to Tony’s office open, his palm hitting it with a thud.  Tony was already seated behind his desk, a barricade that Steve didn’t know how to get past.  But he crossed the office, coming up short just in front of it, slapping a hand down on the polished wood.  “I already have a job.”
“I'll open a museum, even bigger tax break there, I'll just call it 'The Stark Gallery of Failed Projects,' and it will contain only you because everything else I've ever done has been a resounding success, everything else was perfect, you're the only exception.”
Thor held it up.  “A bit of you, so carefully woven.”  He slipped it over his hand, holding it up.  “A perfect fit.  Thank you, my small friend.”
“If you give that to your horse-” Okoye started, even as the horse reached out, lipping at the fruit.  Okoye’s mouth went thin and flat, and Shuri burst out laughing.
He struggled not to smile.  “Well, you avoided that.” He took a step forward, and she fell into step next to him, natural as breathing.  “So.  What happened?”
The door slammed shut, and Tony found himself staring at nothing in particular.  “Did you set me up?” he asked, from behind his armload of flowers.
Tony knew he was waiting for a reply.  “I know.” He forced the words out from lips that didn’t want to move.  He tried to smile.  “Thank you, sir.”
Tony struggled for breath, trying to ignore the hand on his shoulder, on his arm.  “I need you to sit down, Tony.”
Tony was nearby, sipping a coffee and chatting with Hank and Reed.  Steve was pretty sure that he should break it up anyway, there was only so long the three of them could go before they started to fight with each other.
“I'm not hungover,” Steve said.  “I had a beer and then stumbled to bed.  I think I was asleep before I hit the pillow.”  A few other people had stumbled into the parking lot where the trucks were parked, and he shifted around to the back of War on Hunger.  “I wasn't awake enough to drink.”
“Goodbye, Pepper,” he said, but he was grinning.  He hung up the phone, tucking it into his pocket as he wandered across the roof.  Without a second thought to how much his suit had cost, he settled down on the edge of the roof, his arms braced on the lower strut of the railing and his legs dangling off the edge.
Steve took a cautious sip of his coffee, savoring the burn for a long, easy moment, before he bothered to reply.  “Why do so many of our conversations start like this now, Bucky?”
Steve’s face bloomed in a smile.  “Okay, first of all, I already asked you, and you already said yes,” he pointed out.  “You don’t get to take credit for it now.”
Because Steve was leaning against the side of the car, a massive bouquet held loosely in one hand.  As Tony stumbled to a stop, he straightened up.  “Hi,” he said, holding up the flowers.  Tony stared at it. White roses and holly, the bright red berries and glossy green leaves inter spaced with the silky white blooms.
“That was before I actually needed backup, because I usually rely on Strange to keep her from dissolving my shoes or my facial hair or, you know, my soul-”
“I was blackmailed,” Bruce said.  “I-” He was laughing too hard to continue, and Tony grinned at him.
“And Marish deals enough with the 'why do you have to be difficult, why can't you just be normal?' shit from the general public.  They shouldn't have to deal with it at home.  Home should be the one place where there is a full understanding, and a full respect, of a person's identity."  She stopped at the guard desk, her hand placed lightly on the polished surface.  "Strangers have the excuse of ignorance.  Family doesn't.  So in the end, it doesn't really matter why your family isn't giving you the support and love you need."
The crack-snap of shattering glass made no sense for a moment, it was like an explosion in miniature, like lightning, even as it was echoed by the shards of glass cascading to the floor.  Tony heard it happen, more than saw it happen, the glass catching the light out of the corner of his eye as it came apart.
“That's right.  You're not.”  Sam reached for his backpack.  He reached into the front pocket and came up with a red, white, and blue silly straw.  Sam dropped it into the water cup with a flourish.  “Ta-da!”
"No, you didn't-"  Pepper stopped, and he could almost see her take a deep breath, trying to compose herself.  "Tony.  About an hour ago, New York Now put a story up on their website about you getting married."
“But mostly yes,” Franklin mumbled into the beanbag.  He stared up at the movie, his face tense.  “So I didn't want to stay home.  Things are complicated.   At home.”
Steve wandered through the market, catching snippets of conversation as he passed carts and stalls. Vendors doing their best to sell their wares, buyers gossiping about politics and commerce and their neighbors.  A young girl sitting behind a cart piled high with fruit split her attention between her customers and a tall, lanky boy sweeping the street in front of a nearby bakery, flour streaking the legs of his pants.  A thin, pale man with small, round glasses sold flowers, a little boy wrapping the bouquets with loops of twine and handing them over with a gap toothed smile.  A short, round woman had a massive basket in the crook of her elbow, piled high with eggs.  Two young men hovered by the window of a milliner's shop, deep in discussion about the hats on display.
In the silence that followed, Peter just kept going.  “There’s just a door.  There’s a door.  With what I think is a constellation of stars carved in it, but it’s hard to say because it’s less ‘carving’ and more that jit looks like someone just stabbed the door a lot.”  He looked over his shoulder, back down the hallway towards the front door.  “Stabbed the door with stars, and I think that’s bad for the knife and the door and I think a sign would be a better idea, instead of some stabby, stabby stars that-”
Steve nodded.  “Someone…  On the team?” he asked, and she nodded.  Steve took a deep breath.  “Okay, then I’m going to say the same thing that I’ve said to anyone considering a relationship with someone on the team.  You ask, you take your shot, and if the answer is no, you drop it.  If the answer is ‘not now’ or anything other than an enthusiastic ‘yes,’ then you back off and let the other person make the next move.  If it comes down to someone feeling uncomfortable or unsafe, then it is the other person who will be asked to leave the team.”
“You’ve got a lot of opinions for someone who, you know, doesn’t have kids,” Tony said into his cup.  Clea smiled at him, just a little, and he stilled.  “Unless…  You do have kids.”  He set his coffee cup down.  “Do you have kids?  Is this-  Did I just make this weird, or weirder, do you-”
"Do not," Steve said, at the same moment that Stark said, "Can you not?"  Steve's head snapped back towards Stark, who gave him a wry smile.
“I think that’s one lioness who knows how to handle a wayward cub, but if you wanna take your chances, the stable’s just out back,” Bucky said, taking Steve’s mug out of his hand.  “You can wash the dishes before you fight the horses for a warm corner.”
“Or you could not do that,” Tony said, trying to work a kink out of his shoulder.  “You know.  You could just trust me to handle myself, and-”
Over Bruce’s shoulder, Tony could see Peter watching them, his eyes huge under the damp strands of his hair.  Tony tried to smile at him, and Peter’s head dipped back down.  Tony took a deep breath.  “Outside,” he said, his voice very soft.  “He needs to rest.”
“The same,” Natasha said, falling into step next to them as they walked up the driveway.  “He says he saw the fire being set, but with what Stane told Tony, I think we can assume he’s lying.”
It was everything he wanted and it was all wrong.  Steve's stomach churned, and he sucked in a breath through his nose, struggling against the urge to throw up.  In the babble of voices that followed, Pepper stepped into the camera's frame.
One of Miss Potts eyebrows arched.  "I'm going down to Mr. Hammer's home for wayward boys to select an orphan who will come to live with Mr. Stark for the next week," she said.  There was an odd note to her voice, one Steve couldn't quite interpret, and her face had become a mask, smooth and serene.
“No,” Tony said, but he was pretty sure that Rhodey had already hung up.  “Does it count as getting the last word if the other person doesn't actually hear it, Jay?”
Tony’s head tipped to the side, looking through the darkness at the river just beyond the pumphouse.  He couldn’t see it particularly well, but he could hear it, the water rolling over the rocks and splashing against the bank.  It was low at this time of year, and the sound was soft and familiar.
The boy went silent, and the feed rolled back, flicking over itself until it stabilized.  The boy was standing, still and solid and alone in the middle of the smoky remains of the lobby.  He looked up, and smiled.  “And tell the whole world-  No.”
"You invited me, and I have a plus one, my darling, you know I do," Miss Van Dyne said, letting DJ tumble onto the bed to bounce against Thor's side.  "You invited me, thus, you invited Hank."  She glanced at Steve.  "Hank's my fiance," she explained.  "And, despite his current temper tantrum, one of Tony's best friends."
"He is mostly concerned that something is wrong," Jarvis said, as Avengers Tower came into sight.  "Despite my efforts to reassure him."
"What the hell is puce?" Sam asked.  He was standing stock still as a shirt was sewn into place around him. Steve envied how unfazed he was by the situation.  "It doesn't sound pleasant."
“It was Mr. Stark's room, when he was much younger,” Jarvis said.  He reached out, his gloved fingers flicking a cobweb away from the turrets of the castle.  His nose wrinkled.  “It's been unoccupied for a long time, but-”  He smiled at Steve.  “It'll be a quick day's work to get it ready for a new occupant.”
"We have a fundamental difference of opinion on this," Steve said.  "And since I'm rational and you're not, I guess I'm gonna win."  He threw his hands in the air in celebration.  "Had to happen at some point in this relationship!"
“Please hold all questions to the end of the-” Tony started and Nat kicked his stool, and that was the last straw, the leg gave way with a crack, and Tony had to grab for the bar to keep from ending up on his ass.  He clawed his way back to his feet.  “What the hell, Romanov?”
“Right.  Options.  We can make a break for the field,” Tony said, his head swinging to the side.  The wind caught his hair, his expression pensive.  “And there’s a cliff somewhere beyond that-”
Pepper raised one hand, wiggling her fingers in a half wave, and his head tipped to the side, the gesture quick and almost birdlike.  But he raised one of his hands, waving back with a quick, gamine smile.
Tony grinned at Peter.  “You know I’m going to make you work for that fifty bucks, don’t you, kid?” he asked, his arms crossed over his chest.
Jesse's chin dipped in a small nod.  “Yes.  I've got a dozen or more.”  Her head tipped to the side.  “Are you running it?  Or are we shopping it around to someone who will?”
"Comfortable enough, and just, it's your kitchen floor, so I know it's clean, so, right, it's fine.  Fine."  He exhaled, and it rattled through him, his face twisting with the force of it.  "Fine."
"Sir?" Jarvis said, and Tony looked up to see Marcy heading across the lobby, stunning in a ice blue silk dress, draped beautifully from one shoulder.
“Good,” he said, because what else could he say that?  Steve would know.  Steve always knew what to say.  Clint just shook his head.  “Let's focus on that.  On the not dying thing.  Cause I'm all for that, I'm good with being anti-death.”  There was a roar, somewhere above them, an explosion of sound that shook the earth.  “C'mon.  You and me, we can bond over our newly found sense of self-preservation.”
“I certainly do not have them,” he said, scribbling a few notes in the margins of his design.  “It’s amusing that you’d think anyone would trust me with them.”
“Pretty sure you're right,” Tony rasped, coughing into a tissue.  His nose was running, and he mopped at it.  Steve tried to push his hair back, and Tony twitched away. “Don't, I'm going to be-”
“And Peter will be sent to a boarding school of some sort in the morning, some sort of prep school where he will be buried under philosophical texts and mathematical treatises until we forget that he is a shame upon this household,” Tony continued.
“Got her,” Tony said, except he didn't, there was still debris littering the streets, and the girl had ducked behind the construction barriers, using the concrete blocks to provide her with whatever cover she could manage.  The robot stumbled, knocked off balance by a blow from Thor, its foot clipping an empty car and sending it crashing into the front of a nearby building.  “Cap, we need-”
He considered that.  "Yes," he said at last, with such conviction that Pepper had to choke back a laugh.
“Great,” Carol said, her voice sardonic, as she snagged a man with a machine gun from the catwalk just to their right, slamming him hard into the wall.  “Is that thing in the middle of the room likely to go boom and splatter our DNA across several neighborhoods?”
Stark’s eyes closed.  “What is it with the fucking world and-”  He stopped, his breath hissing audibly from between his teeth.  “Let’s be clear.  That was stupid.  What you did?  Was stupid.  It was pointless and dangerous and it was just as likely to get you killed as it was to help DJ.  You put your faith in Doctor Twinkletoes, and that?  That was really fucking stupid.”
Steve’s fingers flexed, an instinctive motion that he couldn’t quite control.  He forced his hands flat on his thighs.
“Your place?” Billy said as Tony ducked past Natasha, wrenching the driver’s side door of the car open.  She grabbed the door, blocking him.
Steve untangled their bodies, pushing Tony onto his back and moving over him, his knees braced on either side of Tony's hips, his hands on the mattress on either side of his head.  “While I do enjoy that-”
“I'd say I've lost control of this situation,” Stark said to Jarvis, “but that would imply that I'd ever had control of the situation.”
If Coulson had a reply to that, Steve didn't hear it.  He sucked in a breath, the tang of chlorine stinging the back of his throat.  Get dressed.  Get dressed.  Why would Stark be getting dressed, the house was warm enough for him to wander about in nothing but that robe, and it clearly wasn't shame that drove him to find a pair of pants.  So what-
“No, I'm serious, they owe me a few lies, they owe me more than a few lies,” Tony said, giving them all a threatening look.  He was pretty sure it didn't work, but he felt better having made the effort.  “I expect everyone in this room to lie enthusiastically each and every time-”
“And we're clear!” the news director said, and Tony realized he'd been holding his breath. He exhaled, his head bobbing in a nod.
“He does like to gossip.” She dropped the bottle and reached for another.  Tony watched her, amused.  “Do you have any idea how much that bottle cost?” he asked as she emptied it.
“Not really, no.”  But Rhodey closed his book, tucking it under his arm and turning his attention to the wing design.  He blinked down at it, then at Tony. “Tony.”
"Thank you."  Tony folded his hands against his stomach.  “I remember what happened.  But not so-”  He stopped, his mouth going tight.  “I don't remember much, Deej, if I'm being honest.  It's there, but I'm hazy on the details, which, let's face it, that's pretty much how I live my life.”  He let his head fall back.  “Hazy on the details.”
“Of course, sir.  As soon as you've finished breakfast and we've handled the dishes.  And the linens.  And your shirts are back from the laundry, but will need to be pressed.  There's also the canning, Mrs. Parker couldn't possibly leave that half finished.  And-”
“See the problem with your theory,” Tony said, “is that Pepper is already a food, so, well, it’s not-”
"They'll be fine," Mrs. Parker said, shaking out the blanket.  Tony looked at her.  She looked back, unimpressed.  Tony gestured at the two boys, and she heaved a sigh.  "Mr. Stark, they will be fine.  Peter is a very responsible boy."
DJ opened his hands.  “Unlocked,” he said, holding up a piece of plastic, the size and shape of the con badge.  He turned it over, letting the light play over the metallic surface.  “VIP Pass.”
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Greer said, pulling one leg up and bracing her foot on the edge of the kitchen chair.  She dropped her chin onto her knee with a sigh.  Jess held out the plate of tarts to her, and Greer glared at them.  “Is that supposed to help?”
“Yes, I will,” Obie said.  He checked his wristwatch.  “Because just a few minutes ago, one of the guards Stark Industries sent over accused one of the others of setting the fire.  And since the man he’s accusing is guilty, I have no doubt that the resulting fight will pull in any and all staff still left on the grounds.”
“Please don't make people think you do sex stuff with birds,” Jess told him.  “Because then they'll start asking me and Nat about if you do sex things with birds, and wow.  Not having that conversation.”
“How’re we doing?” Darcy asked, her voice cheerful, and Harris buried his face in the nearest pillow with a groan.  “Ah.  That good.”
It wasn’t fast enough, nothing was fast enough, time slowed down.  Stopped.  He felt his feet slip, then catch on the sidewalk, shoving his weight forward with every bit of strength that he had.  The gun wavered, light flickering as it moved, the man stumbling backwards.  There was a crack, a snap, something breaking, something coming apart, and then someone started to scream.
He paused to lift a damaged tree away from a row of small storefronts, making sure he left the road clear for a phalanx of fire trucks and SHIELD vehicles that went rolling past.  A few quick repulsor blasts, and he was left with a neat pile of branches and trunk lengths.  He stacked them up by the curb, dusting his hands clean as he stepped back.  He was about to take off when something in a nearby jewelry shop window caught his eye.
The elderly lady paused next to him, a bin of dishes braced on one hip, her neatly pressed uniform barely disturbed by the weight.  She gave Steve a look.  “Customers aren’t supposed to be doing the cleaning,” she said.
“I think I can safely say that both DJ and I can shine a shoe,” Steve said.  Jarvis reappeared, DJ's shoes in his hands.  “If there's a kit somewhere, I can-”
"The billionaire," O'Brien said, his arms crossed over his chest.  "His secretary's comin' down here this afternoon, and she needs an escort."
Steve half turned away, tossing the shield onto his back.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Bobbi lean in, brushing a delicate kiss against Natasha’s lips.  Her hand brushed against Natasha’s back, sliding down over the curve of her hip, the touch fleeting and gentle, as she slid into the driver’s seat.
Steve jogged up the stairs after Tony, pulling his shield off of his shoulder as they reached the front door.  “I go first,” he said.  “If he starts shooting at us-”
“That's why I'm giving you fair warning, Pep.  Next time?  Next time I'm bringing the suit,” Tony said, stalking up the hallway.
“And you should’ve sent Happy,” Steve said.   “They might be after money, or they might just be after you.”  He hated this force inactivity, hated sitting here, next to Tony but separated from him, somehow.  “Taking him would be the fastest way to get to you.”
It was the kind of paparazzi question designed to elicit a response, and Tony's shoulders went tight.
Steve nodded. “Does he know about the basement?”  Happy looked at him, his face white, and Steve swore.  “How fast can we make it back to the house?”
Steve realized that Tony was staring at him, a curious tension on his face.  Steve reached out, his hand cupping Tony’s cheek.  “I do.”
“And after he was asleep, I returned to his father’s study and told him that if he ever hit that child again, I would see to it that he regretted it.”
“Shame it's starting so soon,” Steve said. He made a show of glancing over his shoulder, as if looking to see if they were being observed. It was enough to make Hammer shuffle in a step, sensing a secret on the offering. Steve rubbed a hand over his mouth to hide his smile. “There's a bar, not far from here, where the chorus girls go, after the show.”
“I do believe that if you were to exit the bathroom in the Iron Man armor, you might well cause him a great deal of panic,” Jarvis said.  “Might I suggest the blue Brioni?”
Tony gave his head a toss, but the shock of the cold water was already clearing his head.  “That,” he agreed.  He looked up at Jarvis.  “How did you know he was…”  His voice trailed away.
Tony took a deep breath.  “I can’t keep him safe.” It wasn’t what he’d meant to say, but he was exhausted, aching down to his bones, and he was tired of pretending otherwise.  “I can’t…”  He shook his head.  “I’m supposed to keep him safe, and I can’t, not if he…”
“God,” Tony said, reaching for his glass, nostalgia sweeping over him like a wave.  “It's been a long time since you've had to do that, isn't it?”
When he was done, DJ flopped onto his back with a groan.   There was a moment of silence, and then Natasha was lowering herself down next to him.  She picked up the cup.  “Thank you.”
“No.  Who're your friends?” Tony twisted around, trying to figure out what was happening.  The smell of baked pastry was stronger now, and he took a deep breath.  “What're you baking?”
Tony glanced down at himself.  There was still grease under his nails, and this shirt had seen better days.  “You mind calling it in?” he asked, picking at the hem of his shirt.  “I really need a shower.”
“How about that time that drunk girl fell on the subway tracks?” Drew said, as his salad was weighed.  He held up his empty cup.“And two sodas.”
“Yeah, well, we can work with stupid.  We both have experience with stupid.  Maybe too much.” Tony flexed his hands, and brought them up, cupping his fingers over his mouth and exhaling into his palms.  One breath, two, and Steve was watching him, his face still.  Tony rubbed his hands together, hard and fast, savoring the friction, and gave them a brisk pat against his legs to get the blood flowing.  “There.”  He reached out, his fingertips ghosting over Steve’s cheekbone, down along the angle of his jaw.
Steve slipped out from under the weight of Tony’s body, settling him as gently as possible back against the pillows.  Tony mumbled something under his breath, but he didn’t wake, his fingers catching on the pillowcase and pulling it close.  Steve took a deep breath, and another, straightening his shirt with hands that shook.  “Come-
He stood there, swaying on his bare feet.  He was proud of himself.  He was still holding his coffee cup.  Steve was laughing so hard now that he was bent double, his arms wrapped around his stomach as he laughed himself sick.  Tony glared at him, then lifted one bare foot and kicked at a puddle, splashing Steve's legs with a wave of water.  It was childish, but damn if it didn't help.
“Looking forward to trying it at my next contract negotiation,” Tony agreed.  The rain was slowing now, the wind kicked up, and he shivered.  “I still can't believe you dragged me out into this.”
The studio was quiet now, and he kept his seat by a force of will. "Let's let that 'last' already have passed us. Today. Yesterday. Last week. One more is too many, one more is something we should not bear." He looked at Morrison. "My goal, Mr. Morrison? So that we can all be proud to be here? To call ourselves Americans?
Natasha took the rag away from him and ran it under the tap, wringing it out with ruthless efficiency.  “What if I promise not to stab you?”
The crowd cheered, and it was over.   Feeling relieved and foolish and elated in equal parts, he turned to smile at the crowd.  He gave a little wave as someone threw confetti into the air.  It fluttered down around them, and he laughed. "Thank you, much appreciated, who's next, because-"
“Nope.  Hammer got him into his office too fast.  He didn’t take off his hat until the door was almost shut.  The only thing I saw?  He was bald.”
Tony braced an arm on the ladder, his attention half on the photographers that were wandering the room, snapping pictures of Clint as he struggled to untangle the Christmas lights.  “I know,” he said, his voice pitched low.  “Look, if you can play along, if you can do this-”
Steve pretended to consider that.  “Well, generally, ‘the side that isn’t against the wall’ is always going to be my favorite,” he admitted, and Tony ducked his head.  Steve smiled at him.  “I know you’re laughing.”
The voice was half amused, half scolding, and the man at the counter grunted, flapping a hand through the air without even looking up from his work.  The curtain that closed the front of the shop off from the back twitched aside, and a young man leaned out.  “We’re open.  What do you need?”
Smiling to herself, Pepper turned in her chair, reaching for the cup she'd left sitting on the edge of Hammer's desk.  Halfway there, her hand hovering in mid-air, she froze.
“Right,” DJ said, smiling back.  From the floor, Franklin groaned, and DJ's eyes rolled up to the ceiling.  “Well, she is.”
“Kid’s got a point,” Steve said, slipping his arms around Tony’s back.  He took a deep breath.  “I love you,” he whispered. “And if you need a tie-”
“I was doing fine on my own,” Steve told him, and Bucky made a very rude noise under his breath. Steve gave him a look.  “Didn’t ask you for help.”
“No.” Tony stepped aside as Steve crouched down, pulling his shield out from under the bed.  “They lit the boat house on fire, probably as a distraction, but no injuries, other than Peter.”
