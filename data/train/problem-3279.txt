“Yeah.” Dean wasn’t quite brave enough to say the words ‘friendship bracelet.’ “Anyway, I made one, too, ‘cause why not, right?”
There are gross, creepy invertebrates populating Dean’s chest and stomach, all of a sudden, and they’re clearly pissed about finding themselves there, if the way they’re aggressively squirming around is any indication.
of it. He vastly preferred the period of limbo, where he was gone and he trusted that Dean wouldn’t accept another New Eden omega and the circumstances of future heirs were still a great, irrelevant unknown.
“I saw the two of you together for nearly six months, Dean, and I can tell you right now that neither one of you were managing to convey your regard for the other person, despite how much of it you both had. If anything, your first instinct was to interpret most words and gestures in the worst way possible.
Dean’s anxiety retreats a little, and he laughs again, crawling onto the bed and easing down beside him.
Dean nods, projecting as much gratitude as he can without making it too obvious just how important this was to him.
Cas looks at him like he knows no such thing, bitter and frustrated and sad — but at least this time, he doesn’t leave.
Dean doesn’t complain, though, simply tucks his face into Cas’s neck and breathes in deep, and that — that is wonderful, too.
Clearly, he was not, but Cas wasn’t sure making Dean grumpy would necessarily be an improvement, so he supposed he’d have to just let it go.
“I just — some things just — hit me. And I wasn’t really — I wasn’t prepared to deal with it, and I was struggling, and I — I lashed out, I guess. I do that. But it wasn’t about you, and — I’m sorry. I’m really, really sorry.”
how he wanted to ask about this. And like his dad said, this is ultimately a matter for the council. His
There’s a squeak of hinges, and Cas startles, glancing toward the mouth of the hall, where Dean shortly appears.
“Hey,” Dean barks — except not, because his goddamn voice isn’t quite there yet — and glares at her. “He’s not
“The first time I had sex felt amazing,” Cas says suddenly, the biggest non sequitur ever, and despite Dean’s best efforts to stay cool, he can feel his brows scaling his forehead.
They say their own goodnights and head down the hallway, where Charlie reluctantly crawls back behind the grate. Once he’s secured it behind her, he wanders back toward Ed, a little disheartened.
Dean blinks, trying not to look down and see what else might unintentionally be appearing behind the curtain, because really, now is not the time.
He could try to stay, try to insist Dean move forward — Dean’s probably angry, now, even if he won’t actively retaliate over it, and if Cas wants a kinder answer to that question at a later date, it might behoove him to see this through.
Cas’s heart sinks. He’s not sure what he expected, but it’s now been over a year since that last, terrible heat, and though logically he
be. The hands were one thing, at the start of all of this, but — what does he think he’s going to do here, if Cas refuses to go?
Charlie is waiting by his locker the next morning, and she envelops him in a fierce, squeezing hug when she sees him. He winces.
“I think I’d dream about you in your lacy blue nightgown, no matter what you were,” he murmurs against the skin, and then he draws away and starts washing it.
need more than that. Like I said — I made mistakes that hurt him, too. But Balthazar aside — Dean, I didn’t grow up in the kind of household that makes you comfortable. At any given time, I had the impression I was doing
Cas! It’s not like they could see me through it!” Dean yells through the front door, just as Cas slides down it into a heap on the hallway floor.
Cas might not be Dean’s, any longer, not according to Winchester or its king or its council, and never according to Dean-
And while in some ways, it’s vaguely nice to know what to expect from the evening, it’s also a reminder of what he ought to expect from the night.
Of course, there doesn’t need to be. Not for Baby, anyway. Maybe someday, Cas’ll meet a nice girl or guy, will have them parking a shitty Prius or, God forbid, Mini Coop next to that trashy old Lincoln, but Dean likes to pretend that that’s a long way off, and for now . . .
Charlie, to his perverse gratification, has nothing to say to that, and they sit quietly for a few minutes, during which Dean realizes he at some point started to sober up.
Dean’s understanding about the whole initiation thing must be right, because Dean takes less than five steps into the kitchen the next morning, still grumpy and squinty-eyed from sleep, when Cas leaps out of his chair and just fucking
that — maybe the solution is to make sure Cas understands that he’s not wrong to think that way. That he can be as much of an obnoxious little pill as he pleases, and Dean’ll still take care of him and want him around and stuff.
But then forever ends and Cas is pulling away, breaths short and fast through kiss-swollen lips and blue eyes wide as he stares at Dean, and mostly, he just looks shocked.
“I see.” She hums, long and slow, and then nods. “Fair point. Alright, then. Castiel? You, especially, seemed to have a change of heart about what you felt were Dean’s primary mistakes in a relationship. Why are
He starts, not from the sound, but from the jarring slap to the back Dean takes, disconnecting their mouths. Dean releases him and Cas stumbles, disoriented by the suddenness of it all and still adjusting to the not-kissing that is, for some bizarre and almost certainly unfair reason, not happening now.
Chapter warnings: references to Dean’s accident/injuries, references to past character death, homophobia (details in the notes), grief/mourning (tagging because it is more prominently featured and specifically discussed in this chapter), Hester framing things in the context of her religious beliefs (bear in mind, that is the character; this story is not meant to have a religious message of any kind), references to A+ parenting (details in the notes), Cas doesn’t like Monopoly but it is just a game and his reasoning is not meant to be an indictment of those of us who enjoy it, a joke about Cas dating Dean and Sam (the concept of polyamory is not the joke, clarification in the notes), brief discussion about what truly constitutes good writing, but this is subjective and varies from person to person, judgment of parenting approaches (clarification on what is being judged in the notes), please let me know if I missed anything.
He’s conked out in Meg’s bed a couple of times, but a quick text interrogation earlier in the evening had turned up a whopping
“Well, no, because — you know. Same reason we don’t talk much in the halls.” Cas must be imagining the accusatory note in his voice.
Dom/sub undertones and rough sex: The pair return to Cas’s room for sexy times; Cas is very enthusiastic/aggressive and Dean compares this to his experiences wrestling, needing to maneuver/throw his own weight around, describing Cas as 'force and demand', and at one point having to remove Cas’s hands from his hair because Cas is tugging hard enough to be more painful than pleasurable. When he reminds Cas not to be so loud, Cas responds ‘Then shut me up’ and Dean ultimately puts a hand over his mouth. Cas quiets and stops moving, and after Dean confirms that this is okay and proceeds, Cas wraps his hands around the bed slats and keeps them there. When Cas’s effect on Dean becomes apparent, Dean notes the ‘glint’ in Cas’s eye, which makes him laugh; jokingly, he tells Cas ‘such a good boy for me’ and, in reference to Cas’s previous invitation to be playful with him, slaps him on one butt cheek. Cas comes, then holding on to Dean and encouraging him to finish; Cas tells Dean he loves him as Dean does so, and Dean returns the sentiment, noting that it gets easier every time.
Dean digs his phone out of his pocket, flipping through his pictures until he finds one from Sam’s graduation. It’s not perfect — it’s difficult to get the full impact of Sam’s dumb, girly hair beneath the graduation cap — but it’s a pretty good comparison between their heights.
Dean did interrupt his bath, though, which is probably a giant faux pas in Eden, so he supposes it’s fair.
Cas looks down at himself, inspecting the crisp white cotton frock with its ruffled hem and eyelet lace sleeves, uncertain.
“Well, I’ll give you time to think about it,” John says abruptly. “If you have something to say — you can say it tomorrow.”
are progressing, not worrying about whether his physical interest is, because Dean’s sixteen and Cas suspects he’s Dean’s first . . . uh, his first . . . not-just-friends relationship. (He refuses to use the word ‘boyfriend.’)
“Uh. Well. I mean, I can keep up, if we’re talking about, you know, a drive that just goes, like — up and down, right?”
No — Dean, in his own way, is one of the most gentle souls Cas has had the privilege to encounter; while he might occasionally veer into territory Cas would classify as ‘pleasantly firm,’ there’s a selflessness to his attentions that sets him apart, in Cas’s (admittedly small) experience, and Cas treasures that.
“I don’t even have a costume. Besides,” he adds, struggling to keep the bitterness out of his voice. “You already have one newbie to babysit. I don’t want to ruin it.”
things, but she calls Cas ‘handsome’ and cheers for him on the occasions when they go to spar with the next rank up. Cas decides he likes her very much, now.
He feels his feather stone like a heavy weight around his neck, and when Dean comes to watch their practice, Cas falters at the sight of him, sword flying to the side as Meg disarms him.
Dean seems to be having some sort of meltdown beside him, and though Cas still doesn’t really understand the problem, he feels bad about having caused it.
“Alright.” Cas waits, but Susan says nothing, pursing her lips at the table. “And . . . the meeting worried you?”
Instead of trying to get his other hand up, Cas slides it underneath Dean’s arm, wrapping his own arm around Dean’s waist. He feels Dean’s grip on his wrist slacken, and Cas wrenches that hand free as he hooks his leg around Dean’s, holding onto him as he rolls them.
“Huh?” Dean’s forehead creased. “Um, maybe you missed it ‘cause you were in a drug haze or whatever, but I’ve actually had several relationships, and I definitely never cheated.”
“Okay, huggy-bear,” he manages, gruff, and lets his hands drop. “Charlie probably wants a hug from you, too.”
“To make such a vile attempt on your omega’s life — to force poor Prince Castiel into misunderstood exile — as an alpha, how can your honor stand it?”
“I told him there was a problem!” she insists. “You know, he can’t fix things if you don’t let him know they’re wrong.”
“Don’t flatter yourself, Dean. I am who I am through no effort of yours.” If anything, after that, Dean made every effort to the contrary.
“They do,” she agrees. “Just — you know. Sometimes they’re wonky. Two steps forward, one step back kinda thing.”
“Are you sure? We only saw him going in, but I gotta say, he looked a lot scarier than he did in that dress when you went for The Drive-”
“Probably. I could help, too,” he offers, although — “But if you want to spend time with just Valencia, I understand.”
“Are you sure about that, Cas ? You really want me to tell them what we’re going to do, if you stay?
for all we know! We should at least make sure that’s the last of it,” he adds, frantically pointing toward the offending puddle, though it’s already halfway to being mopped up.
is not happy. He knows he shouldn’t be upset; after all, Dean was fully prepared to give him to the child from the carriage incident, was making plans to send him to Anna, to make sure Cas could go
(That’s not true, really; Cas is a difficult little shit with everyone, in his crafty, subtle way — unless he actually
“I can,” Dean insists. “I just — I freaked out, because I’m an immature dick, but I’m here for you, man. And it’s where I wanna be. We’re gonna get through this.”
Surprisingly, Cas falls asleep within the hour, pleasantly warm and unconcerned about falling off the horse.
love Cas; he loves Cas more than he’s ever loved anyone he’s been with. He loves Cas in a way he’s not sure he’ll be
Cas wonders if he’s allowed to yank Dean closer, take the whole, delicious weight of him and wrap his legs around Dean like he’s a watermelon in need of crushing so he has no choice but to stay in bed making out with Cas all day.
I — I was afraid it was too soon, but-” he clears his throat. “You — you’re the most beautiful, incredible person I’ve ever met. I thought so from the first, but you prove me right every single day I have the privilege of spending with you.”
his idea, and it was also a lot easier to stomach when he was the one taking initiative instead of having to hear, for sure, that Cas didn’t want to see him.
“I’m s’posed to drink like, a gallon a day, according to Dad.” He sighs. “As if it’ll somehow make me grow six inches and put on thirty pounds of muscle.”
It’s not about pride, or victory, or proving a point to himself or anyone else. It’s not about this stupid bet at all.
Dean’s quiet for a minute, and then he shifts his arm, cupping Cas’s cheek and leaning up to kiss him, hard.
should take precedence over priming the surrounding populace for the changes you already admitted were going to take time.”
“So . . . how’s, um, how’s married life?” Sam asks, once their luggage is safely stowed in the trunk and Valencia is for some reason sitting shotgun despite the fact that Sam has, like, eight inches on her.
Now that he knows someone is, though, he’s hyperaware of all the things he feels, still so strange and new and overwhelming, and the fact that he cannot see himself to know how they manifest in his eyes, in his body.
“To do a lot of it, sure, but if Dean’s going to be King, he better be King. And the young man from New Eden’s been making a king out of him better than any of
With this rationale, he climbs back into bed and loses himself to time, thoughts drifting as he idly watches Dean in slumber.
Dean’s cock thrusts in higher up, dragging against him on every other pass over, and fuck it, Cas is so hard it hurts and if Dean has a problem with him desperately rocking back and forth, trying to push against the sheet and shove back at all the right moments, he can fucking
And he’s pretty sure Cas would be okay with that, pretty sure that if it were up to Cas, he’d surge upward, draw Dean in and roll his hips until Dean got the message and did just that — but that’s not what this is about.
Cas almost never thinks of his mother, and if he thinks of growing up, he thinks of Dean. Certainly, he’s never angry at her, never bitter over things that happened long ago, never wistful over the kind of life he could have had, if she’d been different.
to blow Cas’s mind, and if Cas was n’t goddamn Casanovak , destroyer of hearts and most likely asses, too, it’d be no problem. B ut what if — what if Dean’s
“I don’t need a babysitter,” Cas complains, although he leans into his shoulder a little, sniffing. “And I don’t smell like anything.”
“I love you, too!” he eventually snapped, and then stormed away to Bobby’s car, muttering angrily to himself.
“I just wanted you to be able to make an informed decision,” Cas says, perhaps more defensively than necessary, but he
And with a hoarse shout and a full-body shudder he’s distantly afraid just put his back out of alignment—
a dick that has been shrouded in some unholy blend of cotton and spandex for God-knows-how-many hours, a blend which no amount of intended breathability could exempt from such a strenuous test of hygiene, which has probably been brewing some hostile chemical environment specifically designed to discourage Cas from ever wanting to put his face near Dean’s dick again.
Dean feels at a complete disadvantage. He’s only twenty, has never been married, and while Lisa’s young son Ben was one of the most fun parts about the time he spent with her, this kid is at

“Oh,” he breathes out, hips twitching as the cloth wraps around him. “It — that’s different. Than when I wash myself.”
“What is this place?” he mutters, avoiding Dean’s gaze and trying not to do anything stupid, like acknowledge how handsome Dean looks, so handsome that if they really
What, exactly, Cas wants him to understand, Cas isn’t sure; the important thing is that Dean continue to call him sweetheart. It’s happened twice, which suggests it wasn’t a fluke, but anything is possible, and Dean should be aware of his preferences.
Anyway, this time around, Cas has no illusions that the fight will be resolved. Dean’s now made it very clear what he thinks of Cas, and of any kind of willful expression he makes.
living to regret it, to wake up one day and see how Dean manipulated him and end up running off anyway, but — but who the hell says Cas won’t regret
“Castiel, would you like to get a plate? Anna wasn’t sure if we’d see you this morning, or we’d have waited.”
Mood dampened — redampened, he supposes — he turns to Sam for direction as the crowd around them disperses.
“Don’t be. That wasn’t a bad ‘huh,’ it was just . . .” Dean licks his lips. “Nice. Kind of an adjustment, though. Thinkin’ my first love actually thinks of me as his — his sweetheart, or whatever, instead of . . .”
What the hell is he even worried about? It’s fine. Cas is a stubborn son of a bitch and he’s too embarrassed to admit he lied, but all Dean has to do is call him on his bullshit and let Cas be all annoyed and huffy for a few minutes and then it’ll be fine.
And as it is, he’s trying not to think about what happens when this all ends. If he starts kissing Cas . . . he’s not sure he won’t get –
doesn’t really care about that kind of thing, Cas’s books go on and on and on about ‘generous swells’ and ‘soft, full breasts’ and ‘sweetly rounded bosoms,’ so Cas is probably —
“To share a story is to enjoy it twice, yourself,” she says cheerfully. “I’ll have someone bring a few by.”
Dean’s never going to be able to watch porn again, is gonna find even the most hardcore fucking in the sexiest of vintage vehicles with everybody dressed in Western gear about as titillating as old Bob Ross episodes, because this, Cas stripped down and getting into position, is the sacred vault of spank bank material and no other form of currency will net a payload after this. “Like this?”
Dean still looks uncomfortable, making a move to push the blanket off before wincing and drawing his knees up a little.
“Anyway, she’s asleep now, and I rock her to sleep all the time when you’re not here, so the point is moot.” He raises his head, tired eyes mildly stern. “Go to sleep, Dean. I have a feeling the night isn’t over.”
is going to happen after the bath, the sort of something Cas is reasonably confident always involves kisses—
But when Dean found him at Mills Park — when Cas invited him to finally do it, wanting to give that to him, assuming it was something Dean must, being what he was, desire — a part of him was disappointed, when Dean declined.
in the last six months; she could have fucked it up, and neither one of you probably would have been able to tell.” He can’t believe they didn’t give him a thorough checkup. It sounds like they showed up and had a fucking
“That hadn’t been established before we left Eden, as far as I know,” she says slowly. “But negotiations are not complete. If Dean told you that was the plan, I’m sure it is.”
about to volunteer a fantasy for Cas to help him with, all the better to help prevent their activities from gradually shifting in status from ‘relief’ to ‘chore,’ Cas would like to continue feeling out his receptiveness to a particular one of Cas’s, but — it feels like the moment may have passed. “The game last night was fun. Should we call Charlie?”
“Well, that definitely sounds like the Cas I know. No matter how crappy the hand, you make it work.” She clears her throat, and before he can puzzle that out, steps back and gives him a pointed look. “Now, more importantly — show me how far away this river Dean carried water from is.”
Dean nods, and when he doesn’t move for a moment, Katya, hooks her arms beneath his shoulders and drags him all the way back to the sofa.
Sam follows him all the way to his chamber, where Dean immediately pulls out one of his already-unpacked bags and throws it on the bed.
Cas doesn’t feel very smart when this all results in Dean moving to the other side of the car to drive, but he appreciates the sentiment nonetheless.
Therefore, he’s going to have to wait for Dean to come to him. Clearly, Cas’s feelings are influencing him, leaving him both too eager and too uncertain to know when or if it’s the right time to suggest something, never mind
“I’ve never met the man, so I wouldn’t know if you did.” She tilts her head. “Are you . . . ill, then?”
at you.” He blinks innocently. “It’s just — you were all . . . huffy and impatient, there. It was adorable.”
So if ‘anything’ turns out to be having patience, or even being disappointed entirely, in the end . . .
“If that’s how you want to see it, that’s fine. I don’t care. But Cas’ll have kids when he damn well wants to and not a moment sooner, and I will tell the truth and
“No, it’s not, or else we’d just talk to Bobby and be home free. But that was before. My dad — man, he was so in love with her. I think it started with the council position, you know, he wanted to keep her close, but — well, he decided that wasn’t enough for him. Showed up for his coronation, all dressed up in the King’s dumb ceremonial wear, looking for all the world like he was ready to take his vows — and then he didn’t.”
“I was exaggerating. I just meant — see if he suddenly changes personality again, if he thinks you’re open to something. Then you’ll know. If he keeps acting normally — maybe consider that he’s
“Well, that’s what made you difficult. I knew what I thought you should be doing, and I knew what you
“Alright.” There’s a pause, Dean’s pulse a steady, reassuring beat beneath Cas’s palm, and then Dean shifts, brushing his lips over Cas’s forehead. “How, uh. How do you feel about — all of that?”
“Though it’s horribly crowded! And a couple of the girls aren’t especially comfortable around alpha men.”
“Well, we can all stand to be happier. And yes. Yes, there are probably things you could do to make him happier, although if he’s having problems with work, or his other friends, or even just internally, it’s not reasonable to suppose you or anyone else can fix those things for him.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas says again. Lawrencian vendors will ‘haggle’ a little, if pressed, but generally, things are labeled with prices and that’s about what they cost. He knows things work differently in other places, and that the man could be playing a game with him, right now, but he does feel bad if he’s not paying what it’s worth.
Dean swallows, wincing as Cas pauses on the downstroke, clamping tight around him and circling his hips experimentally.
“I know you don’t want my help,” he huffs. “But I don’t know why I have to leave before you can take care of it.”
(Rupi Kaur): While Dean tells Claire to ask her parents, and he makes a strong effort to be tactful about suggesting she might not be the right age for it, the takeaway from the scene should be that he would advise against it. The reasoning here was that some of the poems can be rather explicit, which doesn’t necessarily present an issue on its own, but in conjunction with the themes, may prove a difficult read for some kids. I am a firm believer in being frank and open about sex and sexuality, but I felt that many thirteen-year-olds might not be ready to comfortably process that content; while every teenager is going to vary as far as what they can handle and when, I’d err on the side of recommending this one for audiences older than Claire. I apologize if you disagree; these are always tricky things to assess.
” she adds, looking amused for some reason. “Don’t get me wrong, it’s . . . sweet of you, but I’m not sure he deserves it.”
“Well, I’m Daphne. It’s very nice to meet you both,” she adds. She sounds like she’s smiling, but Dean’s not sure why he’d bother looking at her or even Sam when Cas is right in front of him. “Castiel and I were about to return to the castle for dinner. You should join us. I’m sure you have a lot to catch up on.”
“I meant — look,” Dean tries, running a tired hand through his hair. “In the capital, men don’t wear dresses. Only women do.”
pulling him back toward the dancing and by the time his final drink ends up tipped down the front of a strangely unbothered Emily’s dress, Dean is still completely sober and just as
“Doin’ alright,” Dean mumbles, hesitating for a moment before dropping down a safe distance away. “You?”
“It’s a pain in the ass to navigate, and it’s much slower than on a computer, but in a pinch, you can look things up.”
Of course, rainy Thursdays always make him think of Cas; they’d met on a day like that, after all. Dean, for his part, had been headed to the nearest bar he could find, a direct response to his sub-letter for the summer having abruptly skipped town two weeks in, leaving Dean scrambling to find an acceptable replacement (or any, really) before rent came due. Castiel, on the other hand, had been huddled over two sagging boxes and a tattered old suitcase, bulky trenchcoat providing a makeshift roof over it all, on the side of the road a block away from the nearest bus stop — a direct response to having been abruptly evicted from his own apartment in favor of the primary resident’s new girlfriend.
“Please go away,” comes the thick, muffled request, a very telling sniff on its heels, and Cas nods.
have an uncle like Cas left over. And he might let you down — probably without meaning to — but he’d never hurt you or abandon you.”
Even Charlie remarks on it, plunking down next to him at dinner while he waits for Dean to return from a meeting with his father; she bumps his shoulder with hers, only to make a face immediately after.
“I’m sorry.” And he is. He’s sorry he sent Dean into a panic, and he’s sorry he attempted such a foolish thing in the first place.
“Obviously, you may do as you wish. However.” He clears his throat, still not looking at Dean. “However, it would be nice to know. What to expect.”
Anyway, Lisa’s got a son, just starting kindergarten, and her sister insisted she get back out there.

It’s hard to even
And even if he wasn’t, Cas wouldn’t know what to do, here. It’s worse than any point in their friendship (barring the ten months of zero contact), than any point in their
Still — what if Cas thinks it’s lame? Genre aside, it’s a concert in the gardens and greasy finger food. And if he
Anyway, he does his best to be occasionally awful, and when he reluctantly props up to achieve an angle that causes a maximum of clacking teeth and nose-bumping while he lets the saliva pool on one side of his mouth, Dean makes a disgruntled sound and pushes him back down, fingers tangled in his hair to hold his head to the pillow.
“Nothin’ to forgive,” he says gruffly. “I, uh. We should’ve maybe had this talk a while ago, but hey, better late than never, right?”
“Suit yourself.” He headed off to the kitchen and returned a moment later, resuming his shrewd appraisal of Cas while he sipped at the bottle.
“Of course I did. I’m not a monster.” Or he’s trying not to be. “Anyway, some of that’s for his sister. I think he wants me to ship her like, ten pounds of apple candy.”
Especially when it’s been more than ten years and as much as you’ve lain awake, obsessively analyzing said defeat and how exactly it came about, you still have no way of one-hundred-percent knowing your opponent of
“Yes. I — I didn’t sleep much last night, and I was thinking and . . . the only thing I can do right now, is train.”
No response comes, and for a brief moment, Dean wonders if Cas fell asleep and Dean is somehow going to have to talk about this again in the morning.

Cas thinks for a moment. The library is open after school, but it’s also public, and he doesn’t want to make the boy uncomfortable. He also doesn’t want to walk home while it’s getting dark.

“Well. I mean. Yeah. Most things are. It’s called human social interaction, and it’s not always a bad thing. Now shut up and look at the menu.”
“Sounds good,” John says hastily, before George can object. “Get it done and get home. Don’t forget Hearings on the twentieth.”
“Alright, so — what seems to be the problem?” Sheriff MacMillan cocks his head. “Aside from the beating.”
“Dean, I can’t help but notice something that frequently comes up when you talk about Castiel is his sexual exploits.”
He hastily shifts all the way to one side, only to immediately curse himself for not sticking to the middle a little more; but then Cas is settling in right next to him, shoulder-to-shoulder, a good foot-and-a-half left on his other side, and Dean’s stomach downright
“Wait — Cas —" she takes a deep breath, catching his eye. “I know he’s in rut, but he’s not an animal. If you have something you need to say — just talk to him.”
“I could certainly try,” he agrees, non-committal, then frowns. “But — don’t the Hearings happen in the summer?”
“You know — I merely thought, since he played football, and the way you talked about him — but he sounded . . .”
“Look. I’ve gotta get ready for work, but — I’m not afraid of you. You didn’t — I don’t think you meant to do anything wrong, and we’ll talk about that when I get home, but — for now, just sit tight and don’t worry about it, okay?”

And — even if it isn’t tacky to send such a message, Cas doesn’t know if he would really mean it. That is, he

a surprise. It’s exactly what he was expecting, after all, and it’s not even the first time he’s hearing it.
Mrs. Tran insists on coming to the door with her; Claire’s pretty sure she’s going to lecture Cas for being ten minutes late, and frankly, she’s okay with that.
Cas realizes, then, that one thing he can be sure of is that Dean would never, ever hurt him. That Dean is
It’s three in the afternoon, but Meg and Tracy’s spare room has phenomenally effective blackout curtains, and it’s just wasteful not to take advantage.
As for Dean — it’s frustrating, but he decides this is just one more unanswered question to add to the list.
“You, uh. You were . . .” He hesitates, face heating. Maybe this is too much pressure. “You were serious, right?”
Cas hesitates, glancing briefly at Sam. It was terrible when he and Dean went to Purgaea, and Cas hates the idea of not seeing him for an entire year. Dean or not, Cas will be a little lonely without Sam.
Dean panics a little, irrationally afraid Cas will just drive off and leave him to walk home in the chilly November night, but Cas doesn’t even go out the door; instead, he hovers just inside, blatantly watching Dean and Pamela, and Dean turns away, disturbed.
There’s a soft sigh as Dean fits his own against them, and Cas breathes it in, kissing back a little more firmly.
wanted, I didn’t want to deny you. Even if you stayed with me, I didn’t want you to be less happy doing so.”
“’S’gonna suck there, without you guys,” he says, and Cas decides that means Dean will miss him a lot, too.
“Well, you would have been quite out of luck if I weren’t,” she finally says, and reaches for his arm to pull herself into a seated position. “God, but this is going to be annoying.”
“I was perfectly awake,” Cas objects, even as he withdraws his arm, settling back into Dean’s side, his head drooping.
“Would one of you like to give me some background, here?” she asks, slow and careful, and Dean rolls his eyes, swallowing down the wave of hysteria such an innocuous request prompts.
Anyway, Cas never had any such hat-centered inclinations, but when he sees the velvet green hat angled smartly on one of the display’s wooden busts . . .
“I don’t want to have heirs right now,” he announces, and then squints at Dean, clearly waiting for a reaction.
It puts Cas in an unreasonably foul mood, which briefly lifts when it looks like Dean might be jealous, only to go crashing back down because
“No, that’s my fault. We didn’t properly introduce ourselves.” Dean glances around the table with a friendly smile, though he’s seriously beginning to rethink his decision to come here. He wanted to get Cas
And Dean’s not naive, anymore; every time he leaves and comes back, shit gets weird with Cas, and he was more than prepared for that this time — especially given all the unknowns.
He hastily shakes free of them and then crowds back in, grabbing hold of Cas’s jacket just as he kisses him again, hot and clumsy and
This bedchamber would be a much more comfortable prison than he thought he might get, but it would still be a prison, and only now that he’s here does the difference between what he’s used to and what he might now endure become clear. Cas is
(Although, Dean wasn’t kidding; watching Cas stride around the room undressing and redressing and checking the weather on his phone so he can dig tomorrow’s clothes out of his duffle is a privilege Dean’s not about to take for granted.)
He shakes himself, then puts the car in drive, pulling away just as the door to the Winchester household swings open.
And mostly, Dean finds himself thinking about all the times Cas was there for him, when he didn’t even think to expect it.
Cas is suddenly struck by an overwhelming sense of gratitude, because without realizing it, his life has become rather full of pleasant company, company he enjoys more than he can say, and it’s just one more thing he never expected to have.
” he growls, pushing again before Dean is finished stumbling. His foot bumps into a section of pie dish, and Cas viciously kicks it forward, causing it to fly up and barely miss Dean’s shin.
because Dean can smell his gross rut stink but he can also smell Cas’s considerably more pleasant heat scent, and his brain is
“Fine! Then I should have offered him a fabulous severance package so he could relocate his asshole self somewhere far, far away from
“I mean I’m just one person, okay?!” he snaps, shoving a hand through his hair and sagging into the sofa back. “And I’m asking you, if Cas always wanted more than one person in the past, then — do you really think that can change?”
is happening, no concrete action or event. Suppose there’s no dialogue, but the scene is intended to be meaningful and emotionally significant. You have to understand the feeling of the scene and convey it, losing as little as possible, in the translation. But often, there are context clues. There’s more information to draw on to help understand what’s happening.”
“You can’t — people don’t do that while they’re naked,” he blusters, and Cas stares at him, incredulous.
Cas. It’s none of her business, what they do, and whatever she accidentally saw or heard about from Izzy — it makes zero difference to her. Why would she do something that shitty to Dean when she wouldn’t even benefit? That’s not like Charlie
“Cas thinks so, too. But you know, I worry about my kids, and I really am doing a lot better. Thank you so much for all the stuff you’ve sent over, by the way,” he adds. “That was really kind of you to think of me.”
It’s a little vexing, to be honest, because even though this is one of those things Dean counts as progress, Cas seems too preoccupied with kissing him to realize that the way he’s propped up on his elbows keeps their chests from coming into contact, and somehow. he’s climbed up onto the seat so that Dean’s legs are sort of twisted to the side and trapped in the footwell, far away from Cas’s. It would be about fifty times more comfortable — among other things — if Dean could just get his feet up on the seat and bend his knees, so Cas could settle between them, but every time he tries to move it’s like Cas just increases the pressure or does something highly distracting with his tongue.
He sees her to the door, and when she opens her arms for a hug before she leaves, he doesn’t think twice.
“Yes. I’m not sure I’m brave enough enough to walk by the girls in the kitchen and have them ask about it, though.”
“Hm.” Mr. W frowns. “That one’s a little tricky. I’m not gonna try and say you’re not mature enough, but if I’m remembering right, it, uh, it might be kind of a lot. I could probably arrange a copy for you to borrow, but . . . maybe you should talk to your parents about it?”
But still, there’s no sign of Anna in her wake, not in sight or sound, and surprised, he turns his full attention to Lucy.
“Okay. Maybe not a shower, then. A bath? You always take baths or something? Well, I can fill up the tub, and you can wash up that way.”
“Fine. I won’t eat pizza,” he grits out. “Deal with it how you think is best. I’m going to my room.”
Cas must write a hundred different texts to Dean over the next week, and he probably composes a thousand more in his head.
“It was good, right?” he blurts out, and Cas stares at him, clearly appalled. He goes on quickly. “I mean — I — sorry if I, you know, was pushy, at — at that party. But I did just . . . I wanted you to have a good experience. S’one of the reasons I asked Meg. You, um — you did, right? When — when it happened?”
Dean springs away, cheeks burning from more than just the heat between them, and Cas makes a confused sound, trying to pull him back.
. Cas never gave it much thought — he was never going to have a mate, after all — but he thinks of it, now.
“They have to read others’ stories, first. To understand the things they didn’t learn before they died — to become ready. And when they’re finished — the next book they find will be theirs.”
When he settles back to join him, he thinks he catches his own scent on Dean’s hair, inches from his nose, and that’s very nice, too.
“I’ll wear ‘em,” Dean counters quickly, deciding his dad’s snark can go fuck itself. “I mean, you – that – it’s gonna be home, for a while, right? You should feel comfortable doing whatever, so – so if you need me to, I’ll do that.”
Dean turns with a suspicious glower, his cheeks a little red, and shuffles forward to push the bag at her.
“Thank God,” Dean added, cheerful, and he could tell by the set of Cas’s shoulders as he put the tray on the table that he was smiling, the tiny, amused one that made his eyes all warm and crinkly. Dean kind of loved that smile.
in that context. If that’s what they do in Eden, then fine. It’s just a kiss. A chaste, dry, close-mouthed kiss, absolutely meaningless beyond a way to say, ‘oh, hey, welcome back home, I missed you.’
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, smiling warmly, though his eyes look a little tired; he gestures behind him. “This is Kevin.”
But Dean just pulls on his own boots, shrugging into his jacket without a word before turning to Cas, eyebrows raised.
Then the pants follow, and Dean is frozen for some long, terrible moment as Cas pushes them down, the backs of his thighs tensing in a way that’s — that’s —
Of course, Dean’s luck is shit, especially where Cas is concerned, and awaiting them at Dean’s house is—
And then Dean haphazardly set up their bedroll underneath a table, stole one of Charlie’s pillows, got into a mild scuffle when she came to retrieve it, and went to bed with Cas.
It totally won’t, but Cas doesn’t need to know that, especially since Dean’s pretty sure he’s about to get permission to put his mouth on Cas’s dick, and he’s not about to do a damn thing to jeopardize that.
It takes Cas a moment to process that, and when he does, indignation cuts through his pleasure, wholly unwelcome.
If Benny or Garth or any other man in the world, friend or not, ejaculated all over Dean’s back without so much as a goddamn warning, Dean doesn’t care
and then Dean groans again, rough and low, and suddenly Cas is struggling to focus on fantasy-Dean’s tongue, too busy wondering how real-Dean is touching himself, what he’s thinking about, and
a slow, agonizing circle, path made easy by the pool of slick there, and Cas inhales sharply, unable to keep from twitching back against it.
He’s almost disappointed when his scrutiny is interrupted by Cas pulling on pajamas, but then he reminds himself to be grateful Cas has decided to
He falls asleep annoyed, sure he’s in for a shitty night of rest before he has to go work, but he sleeps through.
“We were.” Cas hesitates. “I don’t know that I want to seduce him, though. Not if he’s going to put his entire hand inside of me.”
But when Dean finally sits down next to him — he doesn’t turn on the movie. Instead, he rests a hand on Cas’s back, right across his shoulder blade, like the beginnings of an embrace.
not the kind of sureness borne of stubborn hope, but the sureness borne of experience, of having no reason to expect anything different.
“Uh-huh.” Dean still looks suspicious, and Pamela laughs softly, reaching over to squeeze his hand. Dean rolls his eyes, but squeezes back, and Cas watches the exchange curiously.
“Yeah, you’re right — spend some more time with them before madness descends. Alright, cool. Sounds . . . good.”
quiet, too, nothing more than soft sounds and labored breathing as Cas reciprocates in kind, legs moving to wrap around him, to pull him deeper into every stroke. Dean kisses him throughout, the sweater an absolute nightmare between and around them, but Cas doesn’t care, just clings tight and loses himself to the rhythm of it, Dean’s mouth hot and fevered against his own, cock hard inside him as it steadily drags against Cas’s walls. It’s so
“And the people who would interfere — they have a mind to take it before my brothers end up destroying it. And — your Queen is one of them?”
Cas surveys him skeptically as he arranges things, doubling up both pillows against the arm, and once Dean’s satisfied with the result, he gestures for Cas to get in.
Half-crouched as he is, Cas looks a second too long, and finds himself thinking about what Meg said about butts.
“Sort of. Someone else found me first, though. I — I didn’t know. Now, it seems so obvious, but—" She cuts off, shaking her head, mouth tight. “I started looking for work, of course. And when I was approached, the first evening, and I was told that they knew of an opportunity — I listened.”
if Dad had let him do what he wanted and maybe just backed him up when he needed it – he understands not wanting your kid to go through that.
“Oh.” Dean blinked, still frowning, and Cas resigned himself to a long night of circuitous arguments with his drunk, morose friend, struggling to convince him of his worth — but then Dean sighed.
“Can I help you with something?” she finally asks, a little high, and Bela, hovering at her shoulder — as she has been for the majority of that silence, now that Cas thinks of it — shrugs.
Cas takes a quiet breath, buying himself a second to think; he’s not sure what triggered this, but he can tell Dean isn’t asking on a whim, and he wants to be careful how he answers.
trying, Cas. And that makes it a lot less terrifying, for me.” Dean shuffles a little closer, watching him carefully. “Since we met - every single time I wasn’t enough, Cas — you stepped in. And I made it through. And I know — I don’t expect it to be the same for you, but — I
His local community center’s next round doesn’t start for a couple weeks, so Dean reserves their places and resigns himself to the fact that that’s how they’ll be spending a lot of their date nights, going forward.
“Of course. I look forward to seeing it.” She pauses, then adds, “I expect time to look over the contracts, as well.”
“You only ever went with me once,” Cas points out, reluctantly looking back to him. Dean still looks pensive, but as soon as he meets Cas’s eye, he smiles slightly.
voice cracked, breaths short and rough and like a delicious volley of cannon fire in the pitch black quiet of the room, and the soft skin of his stomach is warm and sweat-slick against Cas’s thighs as he frantically works up and down, one hand gripping Dean’s shoulder for balance. Everything seems loud and intense and
“Today? We’ll put it on the list of stops, if you, uh, if you don’t mind coming along for the rest of ‘em. We’ll probably go to the sweetshop, and check out the bookseller — stuff like that. Could be boring, but-”
Dean makes another choked, desperate sounding noise, and then he crashes forward, kissing Cas hard, mouth working urgently over Cas’s just as he thrusts in deep, barely pausing before there’s that tantalizing slide out again, followed by another hard shove back inside, Cas crying out against his mouth.
Hannah moans when he accidentally kicks her, and he flinches, racing for the door and sparing a resentful glance for the pristinely made up queen two fucking feet from where they both decided to crowd in on him.
He’s startled to find his heart pounding, loud and relentless in his chest as he watches Cas turn and kneel in the flowerbeds, calmly beginning to work, movements sure and steady as ever.
Anna and Val are watching them, though Anna looks like she just found out Darth Vader was her father.
“I had a very nice time, anyway,” he hurries on, cheeks hot. Dean is still clearing his throat, but he nods uncomfortably as he gets the last of it.
“Wait, let me finish. I, uh, I thought to myself, well, I’d love you no matter what, so the murder part — you know, that was nothin’. But you’d probably still be in a lot of trouble, right? And I figured — hey, we’d figure it out. I’d always look out for you anyway.”
He’s not as much a fan of weed — liked it much better before Cas ever touched the stuff — but right about now, he kinda wishes he had some, just to relax. Knowing Cas, there’s probably an emergency stash in his suitcase, but Dean’s already here and besides, he’s not sure if things between them are okay enough to share weed.
Dean will sometimes come collect him from training himself, slinging an arm around him as they walk back to the courtyard, and Cas will zone out, thinking about a dream where Dean had been doing that, except then he’d suddenly pulled Cas into a hug, fingers carding through his hair and face close — and — and -
Without so much as a fucking ‘bye, Cas, have a nice weekend here all by yourself wondering why I don’t want you.’
“Oh.” Dean shifts against him, hand sort of curling around his waist, tentative in a way that’s somewhat unsettling, given their norm of late. “Okay. I, uh, I think I get it. Thanks, Cas.”
him for me! As soon as he presented and they realized they had a badass soldier in a crazy- hot , sweet-smelling omega’s body, they started training him to get revenge. And all that stuff at the beginning was part of a ploy to
have issues, this would have to happen. Dean just wants Cas to have choices; fucked up feelings or not, Dean likes to think he’d take this opportunity to ensure Cas got to make his own damn future, regardless of how people tried to fuck him over in the past.
Jo comes by while Dean’s cooking breakfast and Cas is watching some kind of anime on Netflix — a choice he questions, since he still doesn’t know how well Cas even understands
Still, Cas makes absolutely zero effort to move, so Dean tries to just kind of twist, reaching over the side. They’re too close to the center for that to get him very far, and he makes a face at the nightstand, taking a deep breath.
“Speaking of which, why was she there? I didn’t get a chance to ask,” Cas says, and Claire watches Anna curiously. This is all news to her.
have history. Tell me about that. Tell me about some good times, some times you think made your friendship stronger.”
“Yes. I know. Especially since she was already worried I was going to start dating and leave her behind.”
“I spent more time in the garden than I did with other people,” Cas point out, a little defiant. “Maybe I couldn’t grow exactly what I wanted, but it was the most fulfilling work I did. It was — one of my few comforts.”
Anyway, the bartender is just sliding his Old Fashioned toward him when a flash of orange pops up in his peripheral.
Dean wants to argue , but A) that’s physically impossible, and it would kind of be a problem if it weren’t — it’d just be
“Well, I’m sure I’ve never seen you look at a woman the way you were looking at Dean Winchester this evening. Or anyone else, for that matter.”
There’s that sinful bacon potato casserole thing Ellen won’t let the kitchen make more than once a month, and Dean is pretty sure he sees several pies across the tables. He can’t tell what
“The thing is,” he starts, raising it again and gently guiding it back towards him. “I think you’re really beautiful, Cas.”
Dean likes Pamela, he really does; she’s sharp and funny and he suspects, given the chance to know her outside of a therapy session, she’d be a hell of a great time.
talk about, in those early days, sullen and guarded and suspicious of Cas, but then he’d talk about the way things used to be and his eyes would turn bright and determined. It all sounded terrifyingly adventurous to Cas, who’d traveled between Lawrence and Wichita and nowhere else.
instead of going out and sowing his wild oats, because there’s only one possible explanation, and now that Dean knows what a fucking shitbag Balthazar was, he’s seeing it.
Cas met the woman once, but he’s so upset right now he experiences a stab of resentment that someone as undeserving as Dean has such easy access to her company. He stalks back to his horse without responding, swinging himself up with so much force he nearly goes right over, and behind him, he swears he hears Dean snort. Cas resists the impulse to turn around and glare at him.
“Hey, I just wanted to make sure.” Dean reaches for the plate, trying not to grin like an idiot. “I’m, uh. I’m looking forward to it.”
Dean’s hands tighten over his, and then they slide back up Cas’s arms, down his back, until Dean is gripping his ass.
“But it’s Castiel Novak and he hasn’t even tried to grope your butt,” Charlie finishes for him, gratifying worry in her tone.
“No,” he says, leaning across the aisle. “Because I heard someone cry out, and I wanted to help if I could. And I
mouth, soft, full lips pressed to his in the most telling, intimate way Cas has ever dreamed about, and it’s so unspeakably good Cas can do nothing but lie perfectly still for a moment and drink in the sensation.
Cas almost asks if she knows about the bet, but then he remembers that Ellen and Missouri are good friends, and this is probably just an old habit of speech rearing its ugly head.
“Yeah? That sounds great. I, uh, I don’t suppose you’ve got any names to recommend as far as management and staffing?”
There’s a plate of breakfast, still steaming, that appears to be for him, but none of his siblings are around, and it is with great trepidation that he approaches the table.
“Anyway. She told me to ask you.” He shakes his head. “Which I did, except you sent me away. Are you
And even though he deserved that — even though he knows he’s wrong, knows that if he’s got opinions about Cas’s friendship with Balthazar, they should be focused on what’s good for
“Oh.” Cas looks like he wants to say something, but then he sighs. “Do you know where the ibuprofen is? I think I’ve been pushing Kevin too hard. He’s still sore from the other night.”
“Well, what about phone calls? Can’t you do some of that nauseating no-you-hang-up-first before bedtime?”
“You think this is about you? I don’t care if he’s too young for your tastes, Dean. I’m not askin’ you to mate him. Just spend a heat or two with him and as soon as it takes, you can forget all about it. You’re an adult, son. Act like it.”
“Yes,” Cas says quickly. “We — we were fighting, recently, but apart from that — we talk about staying together all the time.”
Silence follows, and a few moments later, Dean hears Cas walk out and quietly shut the door behind him.
“I don’t understand what you’re asking. Although,” he adds, now that she has him thinking about it. “I do have a question.”
is the fact that Cas seems relatively unbothered, even though he was bitching about his omega status in Eden less than an hour before . Just once, Dean tries to point out that Cas
“Yeah, no. I don’t think it was. Sorry.” He smiles ruefully. “I guess I gotta try harder to get to know you again, don’t I? Or else I’ll keep taking you on shitty da-uh. Outings.”
They spend practically every minute of every day together, when there isn’t some weird crisis pulling them apart. Since
He doesn’t get to finish, because while being subjected to uncreative taunts about his nerdiness or sexual orientation is incredibly
“I don’t know. Although, actually — maybe some baby carrots? And kale? That veggie burger didn’t quite do it for me.”
“It is. I’ve thought of it plenty.” He watches Dean, thinks he sees a curious flicker of hope in his face. “It featured prominently in my daydreams, before Anna took me away.”
Shockingly, Cas says nothing. His brow furrows, and he nods slowly, but not in that careful way that says he’s pretending to be serious and concerned but is actually
“When it happens alongside love, it is,” she mutters. “But that’s neither here nor there. You should — you should enjoy yourself. We’ll worry about the rest later. For now . . . well, I think I’d like to try and make my little brother’s prince a hat that’s worthy of him.”
him. As young as he was, Cas knew enough to treasure this aspect of Dean, and even if he didn’t, he loved Dean with a fierceness that made any act of malice or hurt against him an unforgivable offense.
And if — if he plays his cards right, if he can convince Cas that he’s worth more than just a visit to look forward to, that there are at least some things he can offer him, back at the castle, even if it’s not the big things — and if Charlie’s right, if the bite and the wedding really turn out to be worthless, next to all the other stuff—
more efficiently, with Dean out of sight and out of reach, but he feels restless and gleeful for the remainder of the day, and it is to his immense frustration that he arrives home before three o’ clock has even struck, early and hopeful, and finds the house completely empty of Dean’s presence.
kids, damn it, and in love with each other or not, I’d bet your whole damn kingdom they’re not doin’ that. It’s a harmless sleepover, you ass—”
“Your dress looks great,” he says abruptly, and Cas looks shocked. “I — I mean — I — you know, definitely, uh, get the blue one, ‘cause — well, you know, we talked about that, but — this one’s good, too. They’re, uh. They’re all good. ‘Cause - ‘cause they’re on you. And you’re — you know. Good-looking, or whatever.”
“Huh? Oh, yeah.” Dean glances at the clock. “Actually, it’s getting kind of late. You feel like some lunch?”
The months pass, and the school year ends, and Dean almost never hears anything about Cas. He assumes he goes on to Kansas University, as planned, and tries to assure himself that if he ends up there, too, none of this will matter in two years.
He’s right here, eyes glued Cas’s face, struggling not to just get up and go stand beside him; how can Cas just — not even
Recreational Drug Use: Cas takes unspecified pills on several nights while partying with friends in NYC.
“Dean’ll have a million other things to do besides train you. I wish there were two of ‘im — actually, no, I don’t — but there ain’t, and you’ve gotta just sit tight on your own here ‘til he can come back, alright? Besides, if you left, you’d miss your day training, and then where would you be?”
Even without the bizarre footnote, the passage gives Dean pause, enough that he half-closes the book to look at the cover. It’s not that there’s anything that really
“And option three,” he murmurs, watching Cas carefully, pretty sure he knows what that something is. “We go all the way. You could be in me, or I could be in you.”
don’t — damn it, I feel like we’re having two different conversations here, okay? And I don’t — I don’t wanna fight with you.” He catches Cas’s eye, steels himself against the grief and fury and
“Right. Right, but — I mean, there’s a ton of sugar in that stuff. Hot water’s gotta be the healthier choice.”
The woman’s leg is broken, but the bullet went through without hitting anything important, and the doctor tentatively declares her likely to live.
stressful, if he thinks about it, so whatever his own opinions, there’s no way in hell he’d risk it.
. You’re okay, and we’re all going home, and no one has kids they didn’t want yet, and — and that’s pretty much all we could ask for.”
And even though Dean knows he should feel relieved, because that went way better than he thought it would —
Eventually, Cas lifts his head, finally looks at him, afraid he’s spoken out of turn, that this is not what Dean was looking for with this visit, that such tedious confessions will deter him from ever coming again, if there was even a chance of that in the first place-
“We should do it a lot, then,” Cas concludes, eyes shut tight as Dean’s fingers work more insistently inside him. Cas can feel his slick, leaking down his thighs, an unfortunate side effect of gravity in this position, but it’s a small price to pay for what it gets him.
“It’s nothing to be ashamed of, Castiel. You’ve certainly waited long enough.” She pauses, arching a brow. “Though I will say, you’re here to network, not daydream about domestic bliss.”
“I wouldn’t have opened the door if I wasn’t,” he mutters, and finally, gets a sharp look from Dean.
It’s not the worst he’s felt; he got shot with a poisonous arrow when he was eighteen and rounding up bandits in the border woods, and he had a ten day fever and nearly died. He feels comfortable saying that was way, way worse than this.
(He also liked that one of those hats sported a beautiful white leather top piece, sometime shortly after Adler had reported an appalling act of vandalism against the seats of his brand new carriage.)
“When I, um, when I said that I loved you like my own,” he starts, and after a second of stunned horror, Claire pulls the blanket over her head.
“Are you stupid, boy?” he yelled, sidestepping the glass and glaring down at Dean. “Or do you just think
“I, uh. I can’t argue with that.” He hesitates. “I’m sorry, though. I — Bela was right, about that. I should have been there. I just — it didn’t really occur to me he’d be at risk like that, from an ally. I just — I mean, I thought our marriage was a sure thing, so . . .”
“My heat is probably starting,” Cas interrupts, embarrassed. “I’m sorry, you’re right. I didn’t think of it.”
“Thank you,” he whispers. His nose is brushing against the crook of Dean’s neck again, and Dean thinks he’s going to have to ask the council to include that in the New Eden curriculum, because someone should have told Cas that when an omega as mind-numbingly gorgeous and nice-smelling and generally perfect as Cas is starts clinging and scenting and baring for a simple-minded asshole alpha like Dean, it’s a great way to get pinned to the nearest surface with a set of teeth buried in your neck because, again, ‘simple-minded asshole.’
“Indeed,” Cas mumbles, wondering if it would be rude to take a bite out of his sandwich. Sad, disfigured dreams of his youth have made him hungry.
“I doubt that,” he murmurs, and Dean blinks, but then Cas is backing up, glancing toward Sam and Charlie with an almost embarrassed look. “Hello, Charlie. Sam. Thank you for coming back.”
They come to a stop outside a door. Cas can pick up traces of Dean’s scent in this hallway, and right outside the door, it actually smells unusually nice — enough that it distracts him for several seconds as he tries to pick it apart, identify it.
he has the presence of mind to think ‘Cas doesn’t want his foot germs on the loofah when I clean the rest of his body!,’ yet other glaringly obvious things about what Cas does and doesn’t want seem to be eluding him entirely.
“Yeah. I, uh. I’d make your Dad kind, make him someone who appreciated a son that didn’t wanna hurt anybody, that wouldn’t have ever hurt you in return.” Dean lifts Cas’s arm a little higher, drawing the cloth down over the inside of his forearm, increasing the pressure slightly, a shock against the sensitive skin. “I’d make your town less shitty, make ‘em people who treated everybody right, who didn’t hurt innocent people just for being people.” He tugs the washcloth up, across the inside of Cas’s elbow, gentling as he traces the dip. “I’d make your sister go around the whole damn country, giving her talks and handing out her prints, but I’d make her start in Lawrence, make her go find everybody who jeered at you and tell them why they were wrong.” The cloth slips up, over Cas’s bicep, and Cas swears he hears Dean let out a tiny sigh as he fits it over the top, squeezing slightly. “I’d make it so every guy who wanted to wear a dress could wear a dress, and every girl who wanted to run a business by herself could, and nobody was ever allowed to take somebody’s kids away just ‘cause of what they were.”
“I really think you should sit down,” she says firmly. “It’s a good idea. I am full of good ideas right now.”
be cleaned up promptly but will be lucky to have a towel thrown down to absorb it, and the moment he’s done with his rushed, halfhearted rinse, he scrambles to his feet, turning away as he rises so Dean won’t have to see his back.
“Good for her? Although I don’t see how a unicorn’s preferences would be reflected in their appearance, or vice versa.”
“Anyway. She’s very upset.” Cas smiles a little as he returns to his coffee, stirring in the eight pounds of sugar he likes it with. “She’s frequently upset, these days, but — I think she was having fun this morning, anyway.”
Cas’ll always be a part of his life, now that they have Claire. Hell, he’ll probably always be a friend, even if things never quite get back to normal with them.
“I — Dean—" he eventually starts, and then Dean realizes he’s sort of zoned out, forgotten the way Cas’s hands have fisted in the sheets, forgotten his own achingly hard dick, forgotten why they’re there altogether.
“I mean I don’t think about people,” Cas returns hastily, and then his eyes widen. “I mean, I do, I don’t think about – about bees, or dogs, or vehicles, or anything like that, I’m definitely – it’s people, just not – not real people.”
it,” Dean mutters, and then his mouth is on Cas’s, hot and demanding and just like that, things are back on track.
“The pain is still too fresh,” Charlie interjects, solemn. “But that’s super nice of you to offer. You’re such a good, kind,
One of Sam’s hands moves to his face, though Dean can still make out the constipated look underneath.
“Brat,” Dean sniffs, and Cas wriggles around with more elbows than necessary, making himself comfortable at Dean’s side until he has a decent view of his face, as well.
To clarify, this is not meant to reinforce stereotypes that would suggest the only reason a person would have a lot of sex with a lot of different people is because of some underlying problem/some motive other than personal enjoyment. I’ve tagged this self-destructive behavior because it’s indicated that Cas was not fully present or in control in these encounters, and was not necessarily enjoying them. Because of this, this was risky behavior that also had the potential to exacerbate his mental health issues (due to that lack of presence and control), but had he been an active and enthusiastic participant experiencing safe, well-negotiated encounters as a positive activity, there would have been no problem here.
“But nothing. Your mom and I are doing great, and besides, if you come home, we can’t have sex in the kitchen anymore.”
He goes completely still, calm throwing open the window and leaping out like the rest of the building is on fire as Dean’s oddly tentative footsteps sound from the hall, and then—
He turns around, faltering a little at the mess on Cas’s stomach, at his shiny, slick-covered fingers, glistening on the sheet beside it, and veers off toward the pitcher on the dresser first.
“You must be Mr. W. Claire loves your class. I hope she didn’t pressure you to stop by.” She steps back, gesturing them forward. “Please, come in, it’s cold.”
knew. The moment Hess started asking me about Castiel, I knew, and as soon as she announced she was visiting, I knew what she’d ask me next.”
“Dude. You couldn’t let me down if you tried. I just love getting to see you come, no matter how you do it.”
Cas was the youngest of six, but the youngest of his four brothers had left for school the year before Dean came to town, and he hardly knew or remembered much about the older ones. Anna was nearest to him in age, though four years older, and the only one of them Cas was ever close to.
“Recovered from the cold very nicely, I think.” She reaches out, gently scratching Katherine behind the ears, and upon closer inspection, Cas thinks he can make out a bit of sardine.
“Mate? You know. You could bite me.” He clears his throat. “And . . . I could — bite you? If you were ready for that?”
“Not great.” He affects as bored a tone as he can manage, ignoring Dean’s dramatic eyeroll. “Fortunately, she did not actually perform this task for — what, another year?”
And for a moment, Cas just — stares. Dean looks and sounds the picture of concern, tone at once firm and gentle, like there’s nothing else he’d rather do than listen. Like Cas’s problems are of utmost importance, to him, and he’s ready to sit down and not get back up until he’s somehow solved them.
Reluctantly, Cas scoots closer and agrees to participate in a few rounds of Go Fish while they wait to hear what happened to the horses.
Anna wasn’t wrong, when she said that, and neither was Cas, when he threw the words back at her; and Samandriel, as upsetting as he can be, isn’t wrong, either.
Cas doesn’t know what to say. These are the words he’d worked for, and by the time he realized he’d never get them, they were the only thing that mattered.
so Cas tests the theory the next night by asking if he wants to fertilize the — perhaps oversized — circle of Forget-Me-Nots Cas planted around the fountain.
“I don’t know. Aren’t you the one who said you were good at relationships? What would you usually do in this case?”
Cas doesn’t have a problem with this; it continues to be a surprise to him that Dean doesn’t, either, but he’s seen it clearly for what it was since day one, and he’s happy to enjoy it for as long as it happens to last.
“Like you’re not a complete rebel, Cas,” he retorts, rolling his eyes, and then smirks. “Or is that just the excuse you use to listen to
Something seemed to brick up inside him, at that. Cas was aware of his inadequacies; aware that people — people like
Which means Cas won’t marry or mate anyone, at all, but that’s hardly the point of the conversation.
bad about eavesdropping, but since Dean’s out in the living room and he talks on the phone to Charlie in front of Cas all the time, he figures it’s probably not an issue.
“What, so now that other people pay me for it, it’s no longer just studying together, but tutoring? What on earth is the
Charlie’s bedtime snack cake ends up halfway back on her plate, and Sam sputters through his sip of tea for a good ten seconds before either one of them can manage a response.
“Dean,” Pamela interrupts. “We’ve established a tentative understanding of Castiel’s needs, as far as affection goes. Would you like to state yours?”
your problem. You let Cas make you think you weren’t worth caring about, as a person, and sometimes — sometimes I think finishing puberty was the worst thing to ever happen to you, because now you think what’s on the outside is
Anna’s face contorts rather amusingly as he speaks, and when he’s done, she looks relieved, though she grabs his arm, leaning close.
“These things don’t happen all at once,” she finally says, tired. “Sometimes, yes — you fight to suffer less before you even get a chance to fight for the good things. And sometimes you
The moment he finally left Dean’s house, Dean squeezing his arm and telling him to call if he needed anything before shutting the door, Cas was already wishing he was back inside and being held.
Of course, it could also be that she smiles at Dean like he’s a real person, and while Cas absolutely believes Dean deserves the same treatment from everyone, most people just ignore him. The fact that Lisa doesn’t means that she gets happy, friendly smiles back.
“Because,” she says slowly. “There’s too many other factors. It’s too hard to know if you’d like them the same way, if it hadn’t been for that. Saving someone, like that, changing their fate — it leaves a mark. And it confuses things. It makes it hard to know what’s real.”
Sammy was probably all, “Oh, he’ll just be right back, please, have a seat,” once they made their way over, because Dean’s little brother is a well-mannered dick like that.
Cas had every intention of leaving after dinner, hoping he could make it to the hospital before visiting hours were over or, at the very least, spend time with Dean on the phone, and he’s positive Anna and some of the others had other plans as well.
“You spend just as much time in it as I do,” he says, matter-of-fact. “You might as well make yourself useful.”
“Yeah, you should. John just doesn’t understand a damn thing. But I’ll figure it out, and you’ll be seein’ Sam soon enough, alright?”
“Right, but he didn’t know that. He thought you’d been planning it for a while. That — whatever happened, the last night you were there, you were trying to say goodbye to him.”
And shit, Dean had been waiting for this moment for years, had given up on it ever happening, and maybe in another life, he could be happy quitting school and hitting the road to go take down bad guys with his dad, but in this one? Even with his father’s expectant face right in front of him, he just — he
“You can’t think of it like that. Unless he’s doing that all day, every day — occasionally using words to express fondness, appreciation, esteem — it’s just an important part of a successful relationship of any type. It leaves less room for the kinds of doubts you experienced, that you’re experiencing now.”
friends, sort of. Hell, Dean’s meeting him for coffee after this, not that Claire needs to know about it, s o even if his initial impulse is to say ‘no’ to visiting one of his student s on a holiday, there’s a part of him that thinks visiting
Besides; it’s enabled him to sleep through most of the awkward journey, and even if he knows he just has to lie still for the prince, Cas would rather be alert. A part of him wonders if it would be better, if he was just unconscious for the ordeal, but the idea of the prince using his body while he was unawares still makes him more uncomfortable than the thought of being awake to endure it.
Dean heads to the sofa with his mug, giving her the info, and he’s just telling her to have a nice day and hanging up when Cas wanders in, attractively sleep-mussed and rumpled like a sexy professor’s cardigan after a night spent furiously touching up a grant proposal, as per usual.
And Cas is also aware that, his own deficiencies aside, alphas are prey to their lustful instincts. The intelligent thing to do would have been to bite his tongue, to try and make himself more tempting and wait until Dean had found his pleasure.
Dean’s too chicken to even say ‘good-night,’ just rolls to the edge of the bed, facing outward, and shuts off the light without a word.
“Honestly, if it does come to that — he’ll be in love with her before they’ve been married a month, I’m sure.”
? Because that’s certainly not a problem — it, uh, to be honest, even just preparing with my fingers was — Dean? Dean, where are you g—”
“But I was the one who asked for it, the first time,” Cas says, a little miserable. “We’d fallen asleep together, and he woke up hard, and I told him to stay and take care of it, and since he felt awkward, I told him I’d do it, too. And I made him hold me.”
? Dean wonders, still staring stupidly into the dark, Cas warm and vaguely sweaty and still deliciously coconut-y right underneath his nose, hand stroking away at the goddamn pie-top like it’s a cat in need of soothing.
“Uh. She probably wasn’t thinking. Or — or maybe she wanted to cause trouble for me. I was making her life pretty hard,” he jokes, but Pamela just looks at him.
On the first day, he assumes it’s a regular morning situation, and even when he starts to feel a little hot and itchy while training, he mostly just wonders if he’s ill.
“Oh — before I forget,” Cas starts, once orgasms have been had and dinner retrieved, the pair of them tucked back in bed with their plates in what must be Cas’s absolute favorite way to share a meal. “Why did your father make you go in person to explain about the plague?”
“Why don’t, uh. Why don’t I help you finish, and then maybe we could make something sweet and just – hang out in bed for a little while? I feel pretty good about the exams, so far.”
He gets up to steal another pie from the buffet, and takes the opportunity to snag hugs from Pam and Jody while he’s over there.
“What the hell are you two doing in my infirmary?” Ellen demands, and Dean twists his neck, trying to clean his ear off on the pillow.
The angle’s not good for looking at Cas, their heads pressed together like this, but in Dean’s peripheral, he can just barely see Cas lick the juice off his lips. He gulps, hoping Cas can’t feel how fast his pulse is.
“Sorry, maybe another night,” he says, putting it in the sink. “See you in the morning. ‘Night, Cas.”
“I thought you met at the airport. You said she forgot her wallet so you gave her your three-year horde of complimentary peanuts since her flight got delayed so long, and when they both got canceled you shared a room.”
He really might just say goodbye, maybe even yell at Dean a little — Sam and Charlie are both young and naive and have clearly read too many novels off Cas’s bookshelf — and then that’ll be that. At best, he might want to be like, a penpal.
He stares for a moment, eyes flicking rapidly between Cas’s, and Cas braces himself, not sure what to expect.
say ‘the lacy blue one.’ Dean’s never worn sheer lace, so he can’t really speak to how comfortable it’d be to lounge in, but weren’t Cas and Pamela going on about how soft it was? Cas loves soft things — who the hell doesn’t — so really, that’s just the practical choice for hanging out with Dean on his bed in his bedroom, just the two of them.
“So, we’ll just … take short showers and … handle quarantine like – adults,” Cas clarifies, still struggling to understand how they’re even having this conversation.
drawing this out for months. This is an elaborate, time-consuming game, and Cas has no idea what Dean’s waiting for, especially when it sounds like he doesn’t even want to play anymore. Cas had thought, maybe, that Dean was waiting for things to escalate to sex, means via which he could more totally humiliate Cas whilst getting his kicks at the same time, but here he is, forcing himself on another date with Cas when despite his flirting, he doesn’t seem particularly interested in touching him.
Cas texts him that he’s having dinner out, and when he comes back around seven, there’s a guy with him.
If Claire is going to be out of the house all night — barring any incident — that means there’s really nowhere for Cas to be after his date with Dean.
So when Dean entered the courtyard and Cas went to meet him, he gathered up his nerve, as any proper knight would, and kissed him.
“Cool. I like you, too, Cas,” Sam says, and fiddles around with the remote until he gets the movie to play. He leans back into the sofa, and then mutters, “Although probably not like Dean does.”
and Cas just confirmed they’d be moving in with Mom and Dad and sharing Dean’s childhood bed – which, oh fuck, now Dean’s thinking about being inside of Cas in his childhood bed, and he’s pretty sure that shouldn’t be any particular turn-on (not to mention this may be the only time the whole ‘inside’ thing happens), but home is safe and familiar and Cas is kinda safe and familiar and if you combine the two with sex (or not-sex, as the case may be), which is maybe more hot and exciting than safe and familiar, Dean’s pretty sure he knows
And he thinks — maybe it’s time to stop thinking so hard about what he can do for Cas, what he can give to him, and more about what he’s willing to give
The fleeting magic of seeing a vegetable, fresh and in-person, is gone like it never was; Cas hastens through the narrow-seeming spaces, carelessly snatching up lettuce and bananas and bypassing whole sections where other patrons appear to have crowded around them.
company ever. Dean isn’t a total heel, either, so even though he doesn’t want to, the dude is funny and animated and Dean laughs quite a bit.
Sam slows as he approaches, eyes big and concerned. Dean thinks there’s a little bit of guilt in there, though it’s not the kid’s fault.
