“I thought it might be.” Dean smiled widely at him and Cas melted at the sight. The man was way too pretty for his own good. “Let me help you bring it to your car since you’re holding this little angel.” He nudged Claire’s little feet making her giggle again.
“You were great Dean. Your mouth felt amazing, sweetheart.” Dean felt warmth spread through his body at both the praise, and the endearment Cas slipped out. He tucked his face into his boyfriends’ neck and sighed happily, feeling more content in that moment than he had ever felt before.
“I really like him too Gabe.” He agreed softly, feeling happier than he had felt in a long long time.
“Fuck. That was the last straw. Whose here?” He demanded in the empty house. “If you’re a ghost or some crazy shit like that, make yourself known!”  He yelled, tugging on his hair in frustration. “Knock three times on the wall if you’re a spirit.”
“Ngh! F-fuck.” Dean moaned, the feeling so foreign, but it lit him up inside. Cas continued to work his finger in and out of Dean, stretching him until his rim began to relax. Cas curled his finger upward and Dean yelped as a jolt of intense pleasure rushed through him. That must be his prostate that was just hit. Cas hit it a few more times, making Dean shake with pleasure, before he felt a second finger begin working in alongside the first. He hissed at the stretch, and Cas rubbed a soothing hand up the inside of his thighs, shushing him as he gently worked him open.
Kissing Dean was like nothing he had ever done before. Cas had had a decent share of lovers before. But somehow Dean, even being much younger than Cas was, was an excellent kisser.
"For being bratty trying to get your attention, and for at the restaurant, sir." Dean answered breathlessly, erection trapped against Castiel’s thigh as he panted in anticipation.
“Good, now that that’s settled, who wants some ice cream?” His mom asked cheerfully, and Dean was glad for the change in subject. At least everything went much better than he had expected, even if he now had to introduce Cas to them much sooner than expected. Now he just had to get the nerve up to ask Cas to dinner. Hopefully he wouldn’t scare off the poor man.
“Hey Cas.” Dean leaned in and kissed his boyfriend chastely before they made their way into the house.
Surprise crossed Dean's expression, and he sat back thoughtfully. "You’d want that?
“In his room, I think. Why?” Dean asked curiously.
“Hm.” She just hummed in response and kept eating as if she didn’t just make the entire meal awkward. Luckily, she finished soon after and Cas excused himself to go put her to bed, telling Dean he could wait in the Livingroom for him to return. When she had brushed her teeth and changed into her pajamas, he tucked her in and read her a story before kissing her goodnight and heading back out to Dean. He found the other man sitting on the couch, and he sat next to him, sighing as he relaxed into the soft cushions.
“Me too, Sunshine. Me too.” He whispered as he reached down to intertwine his fingers with his Angel. They’d probably have to talk at some point about their relationship, but for now, Dean was content just being close to the man he had been in love with for so many years. Tonight, he’d definitely be dreaming of a Bi Christmas.
papa can we listen to Taylor swift? Please please please!” She begged. Cas just sighed.
“That’s up to Dean, sweetheart. He is our guest, so I think he should be the one to pick. Don’t you?” He asked her with his best Dad voice, knowing she knew her manners and how they treated guests. He was really banking on Dean wanting to listen to anything other than the incessant Pop music his daughter was so fond of. He could sing most of the uppity music in his sleep at this point.
Dean snorted laughter, flopping over his lap. "I don’t know, I've seen them up close and personal and I like them”
They eventually stopped for lunch before slowly making their way through more of the carnival. Eventually they made their way to the dunk tank. Bianca wanted to try so they waited on line for their turn.
He sighed as he poured the coffee into his mug once it was finally done brewing. The first sip was always the best. It was probably all in his head, but once he took that first sip of his morning coffee, he always felt a little more awake; like he could take on the day. And this morning he desperately needed it, because he already could not wait to go to bed.
“Of course. Would you like to come over right now? Bianca is at a friend’s house, so we’d have the place to ourselves to talk.”
Dean shut his eyes tight, and with clenched fists he gritted out “I came in my pants.” Cas couldn’t help the small chuckle that escaped his lips.
Dean began licking small stripes up the side of his cock, till he reached the head. He could hear little hums from the other man that sounded appreciative and it gave him the confidence to continue. He bravely took the head of the cock into his mouth, and he tasted the precum that had beaded on the tip. It was a little bitter, but not too bad, so he sucked gently to get another taste.
“You sure? I Know its soon and everything. But I let it slip that I had a boyfriend, so they started asking all about you and everything and saying they want to meet you- “
Dean smiled, kissing him again. "Don’t worry about it. It’s cute." He sat up to go dim the lights and climb back in bed, snuggling closer.
“Hey! I’m just trying to look out for you. Is that a crime?” Gabe relied defensively and Cas sighed.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas said loudly, trying to be heard over the raucous of the kids around him.
“Hello Dean.” Cas greeted, grinning happily at the sight of Dean.
“H-how do you w-want me to help you, um, figure it out?” Cas asked.
"Well growing up I always heard my older brothers when they engaged in sexual activities. I didn't realize that wasn't something that was normal." Cas replied slightly embarrassed.
“Papa, come on! I want to go home!” She whined tiredly, likely exhausted once the excitement of the first day began to wear off.
"Gonna get in trouble, officer." Dean whispered in his ear.
**************************
” Cas blurted out before covering his face with his free hand, and Dean just threw his head back in laughter. There was never a dull moment with that girl.
"If I've ever been with a dom. Are you not happy with me?" Dean looked up at him with big green eyes.
“Yes. It’s not like fucking a vagina. It can get messy. Which is why anal usually isn’t done spur of the moment. I’ll be quick though. Just make yourself comfortable until I get back.” Cas winked at him, before he left the room.
Easier, to stand on uneven ground. To voice an opinion, if or when he had one. To sit in the car and listen and let himself like what he heard, even if his interest wasn’t anything other than casual.
He shouldn’t have been surprised when they got back in the car after an hour. Canvas bags spread out across the back seat. Air warm, windows down, breeze cool, sunshine bright on their cheeks. Cas reached up again and put his hand on the volume, turned it up, up, up until the sound of that stupid, pop radio station drowned out the growl of the engine.
The Walkman popped open again, and only then did Dean chance looking over. Did Dean turn his head and find Cas’ eyes, only a short, few inches away from his own. Deep blue locked low, focused, still intent on Dean’s hand, the Walkman held steady in his palm.
not when it was it was twenty minutes and two whole towns over from Lebanon.
Careful to keep their voices soft for comments and questions. In a way they never were.
Dean didn’t think all that much of it, if he was being honest. He thought they’d make it one, maybe two songs before Cas got bored and went back to their usual rotation of stations and tunes. He thought Cas would take a couple minutes to satisfy some good, old-fashioned curiosity and then they’d go back to normal. Business as usual.
Beyonce faded into Miley, faded into Gaga, faded into Lana, faded into Kesha and Lizzo and Taylor and Rihanna.
His hair was still a mess. Stuck up in some places and flat in others, but not because he’d been pulling on it, or worrying his hands through it.
of a note. “Loss can be destructive,” he started, “but she chose to learn from it rather than let it destroy her.”
Dean tried to tell him. Tried to say
To give Cas the chance to blow his whole fucking, sleep-deprived mind.
Cas was perceptive enough to take that hint for what it was. Pulled the winning cassette out of its case and handed it to Dean. Closed the case with a smack, pushed their shoulders together again. So that he could keep looking. Keep learning.
“Y’never know.” Dean didn’t hold a smile back like he did with a laugh. Let it pull his lips and was careful not to let it pull his tone, too. “Lives like they got, it might come in handy sometimes.”
He didn’t, though. All he did was ask.
His voice was rough, wrecked. As rough, as wrecked as Dean felt. Like it was just as world-shattering a thing for him to say out loud as it was for Dean to hear.
What were two and a half minutes compared to a decade?
They stayed like that a long time. Tucked together, Dean’s hand on Cas’ thigh, Cas’ head on Dean’s shoulder. A whiskey glass passed between the two of them until it was empty.
is bland. Boring. You know. Like white bread.”
None of it was really Dean’s style. He wasn’t gonna be waiting on line for concert tickets anytime soon, but he could grin and bear it. So long as Cas was smiling in the passenger seat.
Dean huffed a short laugh, more nervous than amused. Muttered, “Right,” and took that as his chance to walk further into the room.
He liked that Cas had a note open on his phone that kept track of which of the cassettes in Dean’s old cardboard box they’d already listened to. That Cas marked the albums he liked with an asterisk, that he marked the ones he really liked with two.
Dean threw a pair of headphones into the cart, too. Thick ones. Sturdy. The same kind as he had, that went over his ears and matted his hair down. Except. Where his were black, the ones he picked out for Cas were silver and grey. You know. So that they wouldn’t get mixed up or whatever.
“And compared to all that,
“And you can-you can relate to that.” An echo of a conversation they’d had weeks ago. When the ground was more even, and the room didn’t feel so small, and Dean could stand more comfortably on his own two feet. “What she’s singing about. You can feel it.”
It wasn’t even something he’d had to think about.
“I don’t know,” he lied. Breathed. Amended, atoned. “For staying, I guess. For stickin’ around and calling this place home.”
A whisper of, “Thank you,” that Dean could feel all the way down to his toes.
“You busy?” Dean asked.
That last one sounded like his best bet.
“Inside. You have a record player in your room, don’t you?” Simple. Muffled, now that they weren’t facing each other. Didn’t wait for an answer before he kept going. “Bring forks and knives with you on your way in.”
“Dean! Slow Down.” Cas cut in with a fond chuckle. “I’d love to meet your parents.” He assured the younger man. Dean’s shoulders slumped in relief.
“Long enough. Did you mean it Cas? Are you really in love with me?” Fuck. Dean wasn’t supposed to find out; not like this. He hadn’t even been sure he wanted to tell Dean, but unfortunately the cat was out of the bag.
Castiel stood in front of the coffee maker in his kitchen, willing it to drip faster. He had a rough night sleep, and still had a long day ahead of him. The Annual Children’s Carnival was today. It was an Event that St. Joseph's College threw every July and Castiel made sure to bring his daughter to each year. It was something she talked about all year, and seeing the smile on her face was worth the headache of the hordes of children he would have to endure.
"Here in the shower? What if I get water in my eyes?" Dean pretended to pout, head tilting.
Dean looked up at Castiel, he was quite a bit taller, and he leaned forward to press against the officer, his hands still cuffed “My game, Officer Novak, is you. Everything is about you. Ever since you first got me for vandalism, I can’t stop thinking about you.”
“Exactly what I said Ma. I’m bisexual, and me and Cas just started dating last week. He’s my boyfriend now.” He wasn’t sure which part was confusing her.
“H-holy fuck!” Dean whimpered, but he didn’t tell Cas to stop so he continued his ministrations. He circled his tongue around the rim and then flicked his tongue right over the hole.
Dean was standing in front of him at a
Cas hit Dean's hole again and again. He loved watching Dean yelp and try to flinch away while still trying to take his punishment.
He had spent a long time in the shower earlier, before Cas had arrived at his house. He had made sure to clean himself thoroughly. He had even bought and used an enema to make sure he was squeaky clean.
"Okay." Dean looked thoughtful, then smiled, "Is this what people usually talk about on dates?” He asked cheekily.
“Fuck…” Dean whispered and Cas glanced to the side and watched his best friend unzip his jeans, before plunging his hand inside.
“Well when we started this, I already had feelings for you. Dean, I’ve been in love with you for years.” He confessed, slightly embarrassed to finally admit to that. But it was also freeing to be able to tell Dean after so many years of pining.
"If you truly want to be with me, you will go home tonight and you will go to sleep knowing that I would love to date an amazing boy like you. Here is my address. I’d love if you would come to my house tomorrow morning. I will cook you breakfast and we can talk some more. I’m a Dom and you apparently think you are a sub. We will discuss that tomorrow. " he stated as he made his way to his car. He drove home and went to sleep, praying Dean would still want him the next day.
"Hey, Cas." Dean smiled, leaning up and tilting Castiel’s head down so he could kiss him sweetly. He hadn't budged the two hours they'd slept.
“We are so doing that again.” He exclaimed, making Cas laugh.
Dean sinfully gyrated his hips as Cas continued the assault on his nipple and he heard the other man call out his name, before he felt the hot dampness seep through the panties from Dean’s come. That’s what pushed Cas over the edge and soon he was coming too, messing up the front of the dainty fabric.
Cas let him know he got the message when he took the mug from him a minute later, took a short sip, and put it back in Dean’s hand, guided it to rest again on his knee.
Dean had all of that waiting on the tip of his tongue, fighting break free when he looked up and met Cas’ eyes. Wide and blue and ocean-deep. Calm waves that Dean couldn’t watch turn to white caps.
“Of course.”
Dean nodded towards the sound as he said, “That’s where the tape goes.”
But that Walkman? Good idea. Great, even.
He wanted to say that there was no way Beyonce was mixed for a cassette and that the album would sound just as good, if not better, on YouTube.
He shouldn’t have been surprised a week later. When they were in the record store two towns over from Lebanon and Cas pushed a cassette copy of
Cas tipped his head up at the touch. Lifted his chin and let his neck go long so that his eyes could find Dean’s. A silent question hidden in the set of his mouth, the pinch of his brow.
Now that, Dean could understand.
It didn’t really matter. In the long run.
Whispered, “Wherever you are, that is where God will find me,” so softly, Dean felt the words more than he heard them. On his cheeks, on his lips. So sweet, he wished he could taste them. “I would walk to the ends of this earth if it meant staying with you.”
“That one’s
“Nothin’ I haven’t seen a million times.”
Waited until Cas was back and settled, plate stacked high with pancakes that he proceeded to cut into about a thousand pieces and cover in syrup.
“That’s,” Cas started, trailed off at the end of it. Took a good few seconds before he kept going. “For me?”
Cas opened his eyes and sat up in one smooth movement. Gaze already heavy, half-narrowed by the time he settled it on Dean. Crushed any hope Dean had that his anxiety had gone unnoticed.
Not quite the ends of the earth, but almost. Almost.
He wasn’t thinking about much of anything when he sat in the library with a beer in one hand and his laptop out in front of him. Robe warm around his shoulders, flannel pajama pants soft against his thighs. The air light and sleepy, quiet like it always was late at night in the bunker.
Dean didn’t lift his head up to find whatever question was waiting in his eyes. Chose instead to start working at the Amazon box, to watch a blurry half-image of Cas in his peripheral vision.
Waited one, two, three big bites that puffed Cas’ cheeks like a chipmunk before he put the newspaper down flat on the table, flicked his eyes over towards the Walkman.
He almost missed it. Not quite, but almost. Almost.
All he could do was hang on to what he had while he still had it.
The tap of his fingers against the keyboard the only sound for what had to be miles.
If Dean looked out of the corner of his eye, he could see that Cas’ big blues were still half closed. That his cheek was covered with creases from the material of his pillow, the soft weight of sleep etched into his skin. His shoulders, his chest blanketed in maroon. A cozy, cable knit sweater that Dean wanted to bury his nose in and breathe in deep.
Dean knew better than anybody what a balm music could be. He could only be glad that Cas had figured it out, too.
He pulled the Post-it off his desk and stuck it to the shelf that lined the wall above his bed.
Got back to the bunker just as the sun was going down. Passed Sam and Cas in the war room on his way to the kitchen, four full bags of groceries, two in each hand because he was too stubborn to make two trips.
and left it there.
Sam narrowed his eyes. “Some people might say that about classic rock in general.”
Dean was beaming.
“Blueberry?”
Flipped to the B-side with a well-practice ease, dropped the pin, and sat back down next to Cas.
A loud click of the plug into the Walkman’s jack, just at the edge of Cas’ palm. A huff of a laugh that twitched at the corner of his lips, and then at the corner of Cas’, too.
Cas liked music. He liked Dean’s music.
into his hands on their way up to the register.
He didn’t say it. He didn’t say
Cas’ eyes were closer to home when he whispered, “I’d like that.”
Johnny Cash
It was enough, to hear the faint hum of

artist and
“Dark.” Without hesitation. “Like navy blue. Or maroon. Melancholy, but angry. Self-aware in its anger.”
Less than a year ago, the touch would have healed him. Would have stitched his skin back together with a rush of blinding warmth and made him whole again. Like he’d never been broken at all.
More than that, he deserved peace, and he deserved peace in being human.
Posture poised and confident, and not at all like his heart was in the process of trying to break its way out past his ribs.
Oblivious to the world, with the headphones secure over his ears and the Walkman tucked away in his pocket.
“You’re up early.” A casual observation.
Cas popped it into the tape deck without a word.
Ten seconds later, the opening strain of
He couldn’t help the curiosity.
Dean sputtered. “Wha-what are you-where are you going?”
His eyes were on fire. The circles beneath them were starting to look like bruises, like the blacks and blues he had staining his shoulders from a nasty slam into a wall.
-that felt laser sharp and blurry and crystal clear and hazy all at once.
And Dean didn’t understand that. He was pretty sure he would never understand that, ever, but Cas didn’t try to explain what he meant. He made no attempt to clarify what he said, except to flick his eyes over towards the stove and gesture with a tip of his chin towards what Dean knew were the apples sizzling again, over in the skillet.
“And?”
Dean knew that feeling better than anybody. Found himself asking anyway. “What’s it feel like?”
cassette into the tape deck just before they got out of the car, turned it all the way up so that they’d be able to hear it over the crickets.
Dean tried to shrug it off. “Ain’t doin’ my job right if I’m not tired.”
-the way he wanted. He didn’t turn his face and bury his nose in Cas’ hair. He didn’t press his lips to the warm skin below Cas’ ear.
His hair was a mess from the headphones.
He’d never deserved the way Cas looked at him.
Gave him as good a reason as any to turn the dial a couple extra clicks. So that
with it?” Dean laughed, watched Cas tilt his head out of the corner of his eye at the sound. “You want a list?”
again.”
Dean’s step faltered mid-stride. Felt his eyebrows lift before he could think to keep his face neutral.
Exposure therapy, right? Best to face your fears, jump in head-first, and let the chips fall where they may.
He just. Couldn’t.
He was done pretending they hadn’t been heading towards this from the moment they met.
He had to wait until his beer was empty, because he didn’t believe in wasting booze. He had to have a second, because one wasn’t good enough for a buzz. He had to go sit on the couch, because he’d been on his feet all night and he deserved a couple minutes to relax. He had to turn on
He didn’t say a whole lot else. At least, not a whole lot else that he thought was helpful, or thoughtful, but he answered whenever Cas asked him a question. Chimed in with a comment whenever Cas left a beat open for him to speak.
Because apparently Dean was the type of person that brought canvas bags with him to go grocery shopping now. That had seen one too many nature documentaries and sat through two too many breakfast conversations where Cas had sad eyes set on his coffee mug and a frown on his lips while he talked about
Dean was slightly more than glad for the flannel he had on over his t-shirt. A warm layer that kept Cas’ skin from finding his. Made it easier for him to focus. To keep going.
Dean needed something better than that.
Sam was out on a run. Cas had a sleep schedule like a college kid home for winter break.
Because he was a person, with interests, with likes and dislikes. With hopes and dreams and wants and needs just like everybody else.
He let his eyes fall further as Cas picked up the coffee pot. Let them trail down the nape of his neck, the line of his shoulders, the stretch and flex of his back beneath a dark, black long-sleeve.
“Yeah.” Dean said. Swallowed hard, held his breath to keep it from hitching again when Cas reached over to put the glass back into his hand, and let it go with a silent, shaky exhale once Cas was back over at his side. “Him.”
“You didn’t have to do that.” Cas’ voice was soft. Didn’t need to be much more than a whisper with how close they were.
It was one of Dean’s favorites. One he’d worn a million times, that he’d know blind, just from the way it felt on his skin, but it didn’t stop him from reaching out to touch, to feel when he finally got close enough. Clapped a hand on Cas’ shoulder and let it linger a second too long.
Though, not so loud as to drown out everything in Dean’s head that was screaming at him to take his hand away. That told him it didn’t need to be there. That said the moment had long passed and that keeping it there was a surefire way to give away something. Maybe give away everything.
He wanted, he wanted, he
It didn’t matter how badly he wanted to lean his cheek against the top of Cas’ head. How badly he wanted to slide his hand from Cas’ thigh and wrap it around his shoulders. How badly he wanted to pull Cas into his side and never let go.
It wasn’t long after that night, after Butch and Sundance and that bright pink Post-it, that Cas’ hand lingered a little longer on the radio dial.
It didn’t erase the last hour. It didn’t get rid of any of the nasty, self-deprecating thoughts Dean had had since Cas walked away. Those thoughts didn’t just leave, because they never did, because his atoms were glued together with guilt and doubt and need, but his mind was definitely quieter. The knots in his stomach were definitely looser.
One morning, about six weeks after Dean first got Cas the Walkman. Dean was sitting at the kitchen table with a newspaper and a near-empty plate, stained purple with the scattered ruins of what had, at one point, been blueberry pancakes. A mug full of lukewarm coffee that he’d poured and ignored in favor of the funnies.
He shouldn’t have been so surprised to be wrong.
Stood with his hip against the counter, body still angled towards Dean. And the food.
Somehow, Cas had managed to say the right thing without saying anything at all.
The kitchen was quiet, with no more crackly sounds rolling off the stove. With Cas’ eyes on the side of his face. Cas’ whole body less than an arm’s length away.
He held on, and held still, and let that be enough. Because it was. Enough.
Dean had his eyes on the stove, was getting ready to take a piece of French toast out of the pan and put a new one on when he tipped his head to one side.
“Oh yeah?” To let Cas know he was listening. To give Cas the room he needed to keep going.
Wrapped his hand around the empty space Dean’s didn’t quite cover, let their fingers overlap where they did. Traced over Dean’s hunt-shredded, scabbed-up knuckles with his fingertips, warm, rough. Scratched something pleasant, perfect against the mess that tore up Dean’s hand.
“I think it’s very brave to turn all that pain into something as beautiful as gratitude, or self-love.” He paused another good second, and Dean knew that if looked over, he would find a wry smile looking back at him. “Or a song.”
“Really Dean?” He said, unamused.
Dean hummed happily.  "Castiel, this is delicious!" He glanced up to see he hadn’t eaten yet and frowned, “what's wrong?"
“You…uh…you don’t think I’m a freak?” Dean managed to squeak out unsurely, still disbelieving he wasn’t being subjected to a brutal teasing right now.
“You are ridiculous Dean.”
Cas pulled Dean to him and crushed their lips together hard. He felt so lucky to have this young man in his life. Dean sighed happily, kissing back and clutching Castiel’s shoulders. Cas pulled back and held Dean's face in his hands. "I'm so glad you tormented me into fucking you, love" he smirked.
, did he want to stay in a house that was haunted. All of a sudden, he felt the couch cushion next to him dip and a disembodied voice speak.
Cas smiled. "Don't make promises that you don't know if you can keep love."
"Fuck. Um. I was going to let you take charge tonight. You know, do anything you wanted. Even fuck me if you wanted." Cas basically whispered.
Charlie at least stopped glaring at him after the explanation. “Hmm…” She pondered aloud, a thoughtful look on her face. “And, you’re sure nothing happened that would have made him run out of there?” She asked curiously.
“Don’t even try to pretend like you are angry with me, Winchester.” She scoffed. “You should be thanking me. I did what you didn’t have the vagina to. Now you have a date with Mr. Dreamboat.” Her voice was smug, and he wanted to argue, just on principle, but he knew she had a point. He felt the fight leave his body as his hand fell down from where it was tugging at his-now fucked up-hair.
“I don’t think you get to decide who is too old for me, Castiel. I think you are perfectly fine. Do you want me to back to stealing peanut butter and gum?” Dean glared across the table, obviously irritated.
“Yeah. Thanks.” He mumbled, still unsure about the whole thing. That is, until he caught sight of Cas’ shirt. He smiled at the dorky angel. “Nice shirt Cas.”
Dean waved until he was out of sight and smirked. He had a plan for tomorrow. Cas would be totally surprised.
" Since I know now that you like it rough, I will not be gentle. And I will not stop unless you safe word. Do I make myself clear?" He asked as he tugged Dean's hair back sharply to look him in the eye.
“Yes ma'am.”
“I…um…I only have a small apartment so something that isn’t too big, but still nice and full. And um…well…something not too expensive.” He blushed in embarrassment. He hated having to admit that he couldn’t afford a more expensive tree.
“Alright. But if you really want to bottom Dean, we should work up to it. How do you feel about rimming?”
Cas obviously realized Dean was struggling with a response. “It’s ok if you didn’t like it. You don’t have to pretend. I’m sorry that this was my gift to you.” He responded dejectedly.
Cas hurried at his job so he could take his boyfriend out. He made reservations at a nice restaurant. Dean was waiting for him and opened the door for him when he got there, smiling. "Let's go now." Cas stated.
“Wait. You told Sam about us?” Cas asked in surprise. “He knows your bi?”
Cas kissed Dean's cheek again. "You aren't being a jerk love. And I know I said I'd drop it. But can I ask one more question about it?"
“Yeah man, I know what you mean. They really need to…uh…need to
Dean moaned sinfully around his food, shutting his eyes and licking sauce
“Like what you see?” He teased Dean as he slowly made his way over to the bed.
"Well that's good at least. I um... I was also kinda hoping you'd say I was the oldest guy you've been with." Cas blushed.
“I’m ready papa!” She exclaimed cheerfully, as she stomped into the room in a pair of boots, he didn’t remember buying her, which could only mean his brother had probably taken her shopping the last time he watched her. Gabe did love spoiling his niece. She was starting to look less like a little girl each day and he missed it. He shook himself out of his melancholy thoughts and steered his daughter to the car so they could make the short drive over to Dean’s house.
Dean opened his mouth to argue but reluctantly shut it again, frowning as he went about setting up toppings instead.
Dean watched the man and his daughter walk away. He could not stop staring after them. When they had locked eyes, Dean had been struck speechless. Even from a distance, he could see how ridiculously blue the man’s eyes were, and how full and soft his lips looked. His hair had that slightly messy look that screamed, just fucked. It was giving Dean all sorts of ideas. He looked older than Dean too, probably at least 30. Just his type. Dean had always felt an attraction to older men. Not that he’d ever acted on said attraction, being a 22-year-old gay virgin. Plus, he was still in the closet. Charlie was the only person in his life who knew he was gay. That didn’t mean he didn’t fantasize though.
"Now Dean, it really isn't very polite to call me names. Especially when I’m cooking for you." Cas said with a smirk.
Dean remained tense a few more minutes before slowly relaxing. "So, why’re you asking then?
Cas fucked Dean's throat a few more times before he felt himself cuming. And Dean swallowed every drop. His boy did so good so as he pulled out and took off the ring gag; he planned on getting his boy off. But when he looked down, it appeared that wouldn't be necessary.
“Why not?” Dean shrugged. “You’re cute, and your little girl is adorable. I’d like to get to know you better. So…what do you say Cas? A date in exchange for the tree?” Dean smiled hopefully.
“Fine. Yes, you are an adult and can make your own choices.” He grudgingly agreed. “But I want to meet this man.” His voice was stern.
- this to go smoothly. This was the first prospective relationship he had in years, and he didn’t want it to fail before it even started. He had already warned Bianca ahead of time to be on her best behavior. Not that he really had too much to worry about there; his daughter was a pretty well-behaved child after all. Sometimes, though, she had a habit of repeating inappropriate things at the worst times. Castiel still cringed when he thought about the couple of times she had done so at school in front of Dean. He had really tried to watch what he said around her after that.
“Oh fuck.” Dean moaned at the first lick of Cas’ tongue. He had been hesitant when Cas first asked about it. The idea of someone licking his asshole didn’t sound pleasant, or sanitary for that matter. But apparently it felt

"My needy little boy." Cas grabbed both of Dean's thighs and spread them apart to get a view of his beautiful ass. He leaned down close to Dean's hole and blew a breath of cool air against Dean's entrance.
“Yes Bee. A couple of more minutes and we will be leaving honey.” He promised her as he pushed his way through the crowds of people to get to his boyfriend. Dean looked up and smiled at him before leaning in for a kiss that Cas was happy to provide.
“I think so…yeah, if he wants to try again, id like that. Especially if what you say is true and that I’d understand why he ran like he did, once he explains myself.”
They left the car and walked up to the house, Cas carrying a bottle of wine to give his hosts. He knocked on the door and waited anxiously for someone to answer. The door opened, and a woman answered, Dean’s mother Cas assumed.
“Hello Dean.” He greeted once he reached his best friend. Dean looked startled, most likely not having heard Cas come in.
“You know, if you want,” he lowered his eyes, to watch Cas’ smile form and pull, “that’s something we could change.”
Dean couldn’t get his mouth open to answer.
when he laced their fingers together, around the mug. When he caught Cas’ thumb on the other side and tapped on his knuckle. Once, twice. Barely there. Blink and you miss it.
He didn’t realize how long he’d been putting everything off until Sam stuck his head in to say goodnight.
stuck around, and Dean knew that sometimes, giving something a name was as good as jinxing it. Like there was some funny, little paradox that existed between permanence and impermanence that he didn’t quite understand.
A beat-down, scratched-up thing that Bobby had given him for his sixteenth birthday, that Dean suspected he’d bought at some garage sale for nothing more than two bucks and a good smile.
Dean wasn’t ready for any of it to end, tried not to deflate at the thought of him and Cas going their separate ways after the last couple hours, the last couple days. Felt his stomach begin to twist with it, felt knots coil in the face of the inevitable, but.
“You look tired.”
Couldn’t help but feel a bit like he was holding his soul in his hand with how terrified he was. He really should have known better than to think Cas would laugh at him, or call him dumb, but nobody ever said fear turned you into a genius.
Dean had made sure of that.
“You know,” he butted in. With all the tact of a bratty 12-year-old. Growing up with Sam meant he’d learned from the best. “Your face is gonna get stuck like that if you’re not careful.”
“Yeah?”
And-”
Maybe Dean would never be able to understand Cas’ side of all this. Maybe he was just gonna have to learn to live with that.
Silence usually meant safety and Dean had no problem keeping quiet, but it was too quiet.
Dean couldn’t think of a single place in the world he’d rather be. A single person he’d rather be with.
“Hello, Dean.” He didn’t even have his eyes open yet.
Cas left. Dean didn’t move a muscle until
“Blueberry,” Cas added, mouth full after another big bite. Dean rolled his eyes to hide the way his smile wanted to widen.
Didn’t get the chance to get his mouth halfway open before he felt Cas wrap a hand around his bicep. Just above his elbow, just below the sleeve of his t-shirt. Calloused palm, calloused fingers rough against his skin. A thumb that dragged and scratched and felt so much like a match that Dean couldn’t help the fire that lit beneath it.
Dean took it from him and dropped the pin without a word.
Their hands.
Wherever he went, it went with him. And with it, that bright-hot, Cas-shaped
“Which one you want? A or B?”
“Dean,” Cas said, and there was some kind of plea hidden in his voice, more a gasp than a word. Grip tight on Dean’s shirt, like he was afraid Dean was going to disappear into thin air if he wasn’t careful.
It was nearing 2 AM by the time he finally turned the TV off and went back to his room. Rubbed his knuckles over his eyes as he shut the door behind him. Pressed and pushed and dug them in until he saw stars, until his vision went blurry.
Dean didn’t know if there was more to it than that. With Cas, there usually was. Which meant he was probably trying to use music somehow, in some way, for some higher purpose. Was probably trying to use
Dean ignored the way Cas’ shoulder brushed his when he stepped past him. Ignored the pad of Cas’ footsteps against the floor, a sound that grew softer as he set off in the direction of the garage. Focused instead on keeping cool, on keeping his voice even.
Tentative. Stomach knotted too tight to do much more than wonder.
Dean was almost used to these quiet hours in the morning, now. Late enough that Sam was already up and out, but early enough that Cas was still busy dreaming. Dean alone at the table, in no particular rush to do anything, to be anything at all.
“Hell yeah, says me,” Dean stated, “and every other sorry son of a bitch with clean ears and half a brain.”
Because apparently Cas liked the album, and he wanted Dean to know. And he didn’t want to wait until morning to tell him.
And then one album became two became three, as
flew from the headphones and found its way to Dean’s ears. On and off again, came and went as Cas clicked through the buttons, one by one by one, just like Dean had done.
“You-”
Like when Cas adjusted his cheek on Dean’s shoulder and wondered, “Why should Sundance know how to swim?” A question that made Dean want to laugh as much as it made him want to rewind and watch the scene again. “It doesn’t seem like a necessary skill for a cowboy to have.”
He handed Cas the cassette box before anything else. Mostly to free up his hands, but also to give Cas something to do. Something to focus on that wasn’t Dean. The heat Dean could feel had already spread up along his neck. The slight shake he could feel wreaking subtle havoc on his hands.
But he did reach up to slide the headphones off one ear. Song up high enough that
Maybe silence was better than
Dean’s entire body went cold with it. Numb with it.
Dean still didn’t know how to say it. One day he would. Say it. He’d find the words, and they’d be simple, and he’d throw a
Cas shook his head, like he didn’t have a book out in front of him, or five more off to his left. “Not particularly.”
He shouldn’t have been surprised when Cas slapped his hand away with a sharp look when Dean reached over in the middle of some overproduced, autotuned horseshit and tried to change it. He shouldn’t have been surprised when Cas pulled his phone out to make note of a song, and then another. He shouldn’t have been surprised when Cas kept that same station on the rest of the ride, all the way to the grocery store.
So long as he kept listening.
Hip to hip. Shoulder to shoulder.
He spent a while in the kitchen. After all that. Focused less on Pink Floyd and
“I know.” In a voice so breathless, Dean could barely recognize it as his own.
Dean didn’t know what to do but change the subject. Steer it somewhere safe.
“True.” Cas seemed to consider this, but only for a moment. “Although, I don’t think I need to listen to their whole discography to know that I understand them. Or that they understand me. I can-I can feel it.” He took his right hand off his fork and put it on his chest, palm flat, fingers spread wide. “When he sings, I can feel it.”
“Anywhere.” Dean inhaled. “Everywhere.” He exhaled. “I don’t know, man. You and that Walkman coulda hopped on a plane anytime you wanted. Hell, you could be listening to tunes at the top of the Eiffel tower right about now. Not in some stupid bunker in the middle of bumble-fuck Kansas.”
Like he had no idea he was lighting a stick of dynamite beneath the boulder in Dean’s gut and blowing it to pieces.
that it’s generic. It-it’s got no heart. Like glorified pop with an electric guitar.”
Had nothing but open road in front of him, sunshine on his face, wind on his cheeks when he told Cas to reach into the tape box for
You couldn’t. Dean couldn’t.
and here he was spilling his guts, telling the truth like it was nothing.
Clicked off the lamp in the corner, climbed into bed. Pulled the sheets up to his chest and stared up at the ceiling while he waited for his eyes to adjust to the dark.
Tangible trust that slid too smooth for Dean’s calloused hands.
Cas didn’t stop.
while Dean was in the middle of fighting off a mental breakdown.
Vague, open-ended questions that kept Cas talking and kept Cas close, but made it so Dean didn’t have to contribute. Made it so Dean could seem interested without giving himself the opportunity to say the wrong thing.
The dumb part was afraid that Cas drifting away from his music meant Cas would drift away from him, too.
With a kitchen to clean and floors to sweep and couches to take lazy naps on. A room Dean could look forward to at the end of long trips or long days. A shelf lined with things that made him smile. A bed that remembered him.
Dean looked back down at the newspaper before he could linger in any of those thoughts for too long. Before that familiar ache-an ache called guilt, for Cas losing his grace, for not missing it more-could twist and curl around his bones. Before that wave of heat could climb its way up his neck.
Almost cheeky, almost excited. Brighter than Dean had seen it in days.
It was a luxury, to be able to sit in his own kitchen and make his own breakfast while he was still in his pajamas. To be able to read a newspaper for something other than a case, to regret having that fifth pancake, to stay still so long that his coffee went cold.
"Haven’t even reached the best part." Dean purred, sliding in another finger and crooking them into his prostate.
have to be here?” Dean whined as they entered Club 608, a gay bar close to where they both lived. The atmosphere was pretty laid back, and you really wouldn’t even know it was a gay bar if it wasn’t for the LQBTQ+ flags lining the walls. There was a long bar on one wall, a small dance floor, and a pool table in the back. It wasn’t too crowded tonight, just enough people that no one would really stand out.
“Okay, so…I uh, I was wondering if you would want to make it official?” Cas’ voice lifted in question; He looked uncertain as he waited for Dean’s reply.
“Yes. It was.” He agreed.
"Yes?" Dean turned to look at him, setting his fork down, trying not to smirk.
“When skies are gray?” Cas asked with a smirk, and Dean just shook his head.
"Just thinking. I’m fine, don’t worry." Cas said as plastered a fake smile on his face, hoping Dean would buy it.
“No one ever gets that line right.” He complained out loud to no one particular. One of his biggest pet peeves were misquoted lines, especially from his favorite movies. He didn’t understand how so many people always misquoted an iconic line like that. It truly baffled him.
“Looks like you got me, Officer Novak.” He smirked.
“Boy, don't you be lying to me. I can sniff out a lie a mile away. Don't think I couldn't see what went on between you and that Castiel fella.” She chastised the younger man, clearly not believing his lie for a second.
Two hours later they were both way past tipsy and bordering on sloshed. Dean had the bright idea to play truth or dare. Cas put up a token protest, claiming they were not teens anymore and were way too old to be playing, but it didn’t take much arm twisting from Dean before he relented. He had to admit, he was having a good time too. There wasn’t a whole lot they didn’t know about each other, so they mostly picked dares, which lead to each of them drinking disgusting concoctions of the other ones making, prank phone calls, and one very funny rendition from Dean of Baby Shark, which had Cas wheezing with laughter. When he finally calmed down enough, he asked “Truth or Dare Dean?”
He made his way to the school and walked in the building to stand with the other parent’s again like usual, scrolling on his phone through his emails as he waited. A few minutes later, Bianca’s class was being led down the hall by Dean. Cas felt his palms sweat when he caught sight of the other man.
“Hello Dean. Please come in.” He stepped aside to allow him to enter, dreading what would probably be an awkward conversation.
Once Cas bottomed out, he stilled for a few seconds before he pulled out slowly and thrust his cock back in hard. He repeated that over and over as he set a slow but hard pace.
Cas watched for a reaction from his sub. Pleased by what he saw, he pushed his pants down further and pulled his cock back a little, before shoving it deeper and hitting Dean in the back of his mouth where his throat began. He did this a few more times before he slowly fed more of his cock into Dean and felt it slide down his throat slightly. He planned on being rough but he wanted to test the waters a little before he started really fucking Dean's throat.
"Fuck fuck fuck" is all he could say as Dean fucked him so good. Dean purred and dragged nails down his back as he spread him wider and sped up. Cas moaned and thrashed around as Dean fucked him hard and fast.
Cas looked up into Dean's eyes and could see the truth there. He pulled Dean into his lap, straddling his thighs and pulled him into one of the most passionate kisses he ever had.
“Oh…. okay, um why not?” Dean sounded disappointed, but maybe Cas was just hearing things.
Dean snuggled into Castiel’s chest, leaning up to plant a long, sensual kiss on his lips. "I've never had anything like that, or like this. I love it. Thank you, Cas."
“Very nice Amanda. Ok, now you child.” She pointed to the next kid. They went around the room and all introduced themselves and were excited to talk about their summers. Eventually it was the last kid’s turn and Dean turned to face her. She looked familiar to him, but he couldn’t place where he knew her from.
“Come in.” He yelled, voice slightly muffled in the sheets, but it must have been clear enough because his door opened and he heard feet shuffling before the door closed again.
"I could always steal a jar of jam to get your time." Dean chuckled against Castiel’s skin. "You could fuck me against your patrol car as punishment.”
Dean wavered back and forth before ordering a Tavern burger and turning back to Cas. "Happy Valentine’s Day," he said quietly, handing Cas a box.
“What’s wrong?” He asked in concern but Dean just waved him off dismissively.
Cas stared at the picture, which was clearly a sex toy made to look like a gun, and when he glanced back up at Sam, he could clearly see the younger man trying not to laugh. Ah, so he actually thought Cas was really this clueless. Sam probably figured Cas didn’t already have a vast knowledge of sex at this point and was still the naïve little Angel he had always been. The truth was actually quite the opposite. Four months of being with Dean had given him a lot of experience in the bedroom, seeing as Dean was an incredibly sexual person. This toy was actually pretty tame compared to some of the stuff they had done. Cas felt himself starting to become aroused just thinking about it, so he quickly shook himself out of those thoughts and decided to play along.
"I am very much amenable." Dean rolled his eyes at the language and leaned in, kissing him softly on the lips, more sensually and lovingly than usually.
"Please what?" Cas asked smirking.
“What’s going on Dean?” He asked, voice loud enough that the people around them were starting to stare.
“Yeah, Cas…me too.” He whispered shyly. “I, uh…better go before someone wonders why we’ve been sitting here so long.” He joked as he reached for the door handle. “Night Cas.”
“I’m good. Let’s get to it.” He winked back. Before he even knew what happened, they both ended up naked in bed with Cas settled between Dean’s legs as he stared up at the other man.
Fuck. Cas was hard as a rock as Dean cuffed him. He couldn't wait to see what he would actually do. He was so turned on and excited to be on the other end for a change. He absolutely loved being a Dom. But he also liked submitting once in a while.
"Good boy. You are getting 10 spanks with my bare hand. You don't have to count them this time. Are you ready?" He asked.
"Oh fuck." Dean moaned, grunting and whimpering at each thrust in, making the prettiest noises as Cas fucked him hard.
Dean laughed, pressing sucking kisses to Castiel’s neck. "Mmm. Love you, daddy.”
good, or so Cas said. So, after taking a
“Fuck, Charlie…. I don’t know what to do…yeah, I know…. yes, I was stupid…. yes, I know…. but what if he never wants to speak to me again…. but what- yes, I know we’ve been friends for a long time, but…fuck. But what if I tell him and he hates me? I don’t know…. What am I gonna do? Just say “oh hey Dean, oh by the way I’m in love with you?” …”
“Cas, look. I can’t promise right now that this will last, obviously. But I know that you being a parent is not something that is gonna play into that at all. I like you, a lot. And I’d like to see where this goes, if you do too.” And he did. He really liked Cas and would love to go on more dates with him. He knew going into this that Bianca was part of the deal. Hell, he already knew the little girl well and he liked her too.
He took a few deep breaths before texting Cas that he was ready. He waited with baited breath, until he heard the bedroom door open and Cas let out a gasp. He turned his head and saw his boyfriend’s slack jaw.
“So, what did you think of the last episode we watched?” Dean asked nonchalantly as he began sliding his hand up and down his cock.
“Fuck Cas…” Dean moaned as he shifted his body, the new angle making him hit Cas’ prostate dead-on.
"Dean, I plan on spanking you 10 hits directly on your hole with this crop. Can you handle that?"
They had gone out on a few more dates over the last two months; Once to the movies, and another time out for dinner. It wasn’t easy though, for them to plan time just the two of them, and Dean was quickly learning what it was really like to date a man with a kid. As he reassured Cas on multiple occasions, he really didn’t mind though.  He had known going into this that the two were a package deal, and that his daughter would always come first. That meant that Cas was frequently busy with all sorts of extracurricular activities; Girls Scouts, dance, and kids parties took up much of the other man’s time, so they were mostly relegated to dates involving Bianca. Which is why they were currently at the park, watching the little girl play as they sat on a bench together. Dean smiled as he watched her jump from the swing and land in the sand, while Cas was apologizing again for about the thirtieth time.
He really should have known better.
Safe with Dean watching his back. In a place they could call home. A home. A real
Dean let his next few words go slowly, and watched Cas’ smile fall with every syllable.
Cas was already sitting on the hood of the Impala by the time Dean made it to the garage. He had his hands braced back behind him, ankles crossed below him, chin tipped so that he could look up at the ceiling.
But there were also days when Dean caught Cas humming. When he caught Cas in the kitchen making a PB&J, humming softly to himself and bopping his head back and forth. When he caught Cas in the library with his eyes on a book, a smile on his lips, and a song under his breath.
A good Walkman.
Exhaustion, desperation made it easy for confusion to twist his face. Made it easy for him to reach out and push the cassette over to the side, so that he could see what was hiding beneath it. Felt his face smooth back out, felt his heart creep up at what he found looking back at him.
Cas stuck tight to his side. Sat calm, breathed easy. Hummed, whenever he recognized a song. Jiggled his foot in time with the beat, rhythm perfect, but somehow subconscious in its movement. Like he didn’t even know he was doing it.
But Dean’s eyes were already wandering. Drifting. Falling to trace the line of his nose, the purse of his lips. Asked, “Make sense?” and watched Cas’ Adam’s apple bob when he swallowed, nodded.
It made Cas feel far away. Out of reach.
Cas didn’t answer right away. Let the question hang there so long that Dean considered asking again, considered repeating the question louder, considered phrasing it differently.
Not quite touching, but almost. Almost.
Made Dean think about simpler times. Made him think of how glad he was that they were gone. How guilty he was for being glad.

Dean had Cas’ knee pushing into his stomach, the band of the headphones pressing an uncomfortable line into his cheek, but he didn’t mind. Not when it was so easy to fix.
An asterisk in the middle of neon pink, black ink. A crooked smiley face drawn next to it. The whole Post-it freckled with tiny music notes.
“Whatever.” Sam huffed, and started at cutting his pancakes. “I don’t even know why I asked. You’re such a snob when it comes to this shit.”
Closed the gap and chipped away at the boulder in Dean’s gut with two simple words.
Warm and wild and pure and perfect, but it was too much. Dean always wanted too much. He always wanted what he couldn’t have.
, less like
,” as he brought Queen into the argument and Dean into the conversation more fully. Without missing a beat.
Dean’s, to let his smile pull high and say, “Sounds like you.” Teasing.
Didn’t know how it was possible to feel too big and too small for his body at the same time.
He didn’t complain when Cas fell asleep like that, when the soft rhythm of Cas’ breath, the easy rise and fall of his chest, the warmth of somebody safe and comfortable less than an arm’s length away eventually lulled him to sleep, too.
Cas didn’t have a whole lot to call his own. Dean couldn’t find it in himself to mind sharing.
Dean kicked at Cas’ foot. Caught his far-away lookin’ eyes and wondered, “What’s goin’ on up there?”
Dean’s pulse just about went through the roof. Stomach so tight with knots, with nerves that he might have buckled if he had to wait another second.
He still sat on the couch with Dean and tucked his toes under his thigh. He still stole Dean’s whiskey glass or his beer out of his hand and let Dean drink from his coffee mug. He still stood too close and looked too long and all the hundreds of other little things Dean had spent a decade learning to live with.
Cas had been on enough grocery runs with him to know that the record store wasn’t just a
“Cas.”
If Dean took that as an invitation, if he gave into some of the leftover exhaustion and angled his body so that he could rest his cheek on Cas’ shoulder, so that he could bury his face in the curve of Cas’ neck, nobody needed to know.
He had to bring all the canvas bags to the kitchen, because the detour meant they’d already been sitting in the car too long. He had to put everything away, because a messy kitchen was bad for the mind. He had to start dinner, because it was already 5 o’clock and three guys had the capacity to kill each other if they got hungry enough. He had to call Sam and Cas to come eat as soon as it was ready, because he didn’t spend two hours on eggplant parm just to serve it cold.
. One of John’s old tapes that he’d picked up somewhere on the road, that he would play to keep himself awake at 3AM and ten-year-old Dean would listen to with his eyes closed while he pretended to be asleep, with Sammy’s head on his shoulder and the soft
Dean pursed his lips. Paused. Flicked his eyes over towards the box in Cas’ hands and let them linger half a second. Over the curl of his fingers, the gentle flex of his forearms. Tanned and toned in a way they hadn’t always been.
He’d asked once. A couple days ago. Somewhere between Oklahoma and Arkansas, with the sun setting somewhere up ahead, a final burst of light to paint the sky orange and red.
Cas gasped in mock outrage. “Traitor!”
Gabe had been pestering him for awhile now to meet Dean, pretty much since they had begun dating, and now that they had taken the next step, Cas figured it was probably time. He was dreading it though. He loved his brother, he really did, but the man was a lot to handle. He was praying that he didn’t scare Dean away.
Dean gasped in surprise at the slap, clenching around Cas. "Nooo, your cock is perfect. I love it pounding my ass." Dean whimpered, almost shouting now.
it hurt, but Cas went slow, only pushing in a little at a time to let Dean adjust to the intense feeling of being stretched open around a cock for the first time.
"Yes, Cas. I trust you." Dean said truthfully, looking up at him.
Cas turned around and hugged Dean. "Go sit down love. I’m cooking breakfast." Cas said as he turned back to the stove to finish cooking. Dean nodded and plopped on the kitchen chair, smiling. He listened to the music, bobbing his head.
“Come on, Red…Do we
“Dean!” Cas moaned as the other man turned the vibrations up, the toy nailing his prostate as Dean fucked it inside him hard and fast.
“And you never once mentioned that to me?” Dean couldn’t believe this. He had been so worried about coming out to his parent’s and it turned out, not only did they already know he liked dudes, but they thought he had been dating one this whole time. “I never even came out to you!”
"Yeah. Do you have my address?" Dean slowly untangled himself and sat up, blinking sleepy green eyes and running a hand through his mussy hair.
It wasn’t freaking easy planning an anniversary during a pandemic either. It’s not like he could go out and get anything, or send Cas away to set anything up, so he had to be sneaky about the whole thing. He’d spent the last week ordering a few things online, and hiding the packages in the closet of his old room as they came. Cas had been suspicious but then Dean distracted him with a blow job and all was forgotten. That was definitely a perk of them dating now. It was easy to distract Cas with sexual favors, or persuade him. And Cas didn’t seem to be complaining either.
Castiel woke up slowly, his dream fading to the background as he became aware of his surroundings. The bright light shining through the curtains made him groan and try to roll over away from it. That’s when he realized a few things. One, he wasn’t alone in his bed. That became clear when he couldn’t move because a strong arm was wrapped around his waist, holding him in place. And two, there was something poking him in his backside. The moan he heard behind him clued him into exactly what that thing was.
“Good.” Cas replied before going to town on the ass in front of him. He pulled out all the stops, switching between circling and flicking his tongue before he began pushing gently into Dean’s hole with it. Drool dripped down his face as he ate out his boyfriend, who was grinding back and forth on the bed, no doubt rubbing his cock off on the sheet below him.
Sam had never run so fast in his life. That did not go as he had planned. Fuck he needed brain bleach now. He would never get that image out of his head.
