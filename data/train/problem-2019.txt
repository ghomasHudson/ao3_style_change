Something of a worried frown appeared on Sherlock’s face. John could see him mentally heading off in completely the wrong direction in his effort to deduce what Violet wanted to tell him, and smiled.
, left her alone in the bedroom upstairs when she cried. (They hadn’t even discussed this; they just didn’t.) Sherlock easily fell into the habits John had developed with her. There were no quarrels, no misunderstandings, no differences of opinion. There was peace, security and laughter.
“Look at that energetic ballerina,” John chuckled. “It won’t take long before she can stand by herself.”
He'd only needed to rule out this third year student, John Watson, as a suspect, by checking he did not in fact have a bat tattoo on his left hip.
Sherlock stared at her, dumbstruck. “Well, at least that took us slightly longer than average statistics, then.” It had been twelve weeks. He made a wry smile and looked out onto the street, avoiding her gaze.
Sherlock, meanwhile, seemed to be happily ignoring the conversation, instead carefully making sure Rosie wouldn’t swallow air at the end of her bottle.
“Listen, er…” Sherlock hesitated. “I might actually have told Donovan that you blame me for Mary’s death and want nothing to do with me anymore.”
John smiled back, still somewhat incredulous, and remained still as a statue, afraid to break the spell.
Eventually, they lay chest to chest, almost as if gluing themselves together with cum, Sherlock thought amusedly. The disappointment he had felt half an hour ago was gone completely and replaced by utter happiness (of a magnitude and intensity he hadn’t imagined possible a week ago).
Although he looked apprehensive, there was no trace of discomfort in his expression. It was more like awe.
“Well, I’m sure the doctors are doing whatever they can to bring him back to you,” she said innocently, “so you can continue to pine over him.” Her smile was pure evil.
Sherlock closed his eyes, ignoring her, while categorising all the known facts, and ascertaining whether he needed to ask any more questions.
When they reached the bit where she was being read her rights, Sherlock let out a long sigh and pulled off his wig.
Oh, how he loved a little touch of drama. “I-I-I’ve miscalculated,” he said. And then, louder, “I forgot to factor in the
There was a short silence during which Sherlock looked at him with the most sincere and open expression John had ever seen on his face.
John spent most of the time lying either in bed or on the sofa, which, however, didn’t prevent him from playing with Rosie. She especially liked to look at her board books while sitting on his stomach, and often fell asleep there, lying cosily on top of him, together with her merman toy.
that was kissing him just now (and that he fantasised about almost non-stop for two days), that mouth with which Sherlock just admitted that he wants to be in a relationship with him, John becomes aware once more of one specific part of him still straining against his underwear. He then feels a mischievous grin tug fondly at the corners of his mouth. “Well, then what are you waiting for?”
“Go?” John opened his eyes again. “After all these days sitting by my side in a hospital room, you’re not going to leave me alone
They would have to stick it out for a couple of days. Ah well. It would be over soon enough, and then the calm would return. Proper calm.
There was one of a horse galloping through glistening snow, one of the building they were in, with the trees casting spotty shadows on the lawn in different shades of green, one of a vase with wilted flowers, and several very realistic portraits of people, among which John spotted an astoundingly truthful younger version of Sherlock’s mother.
“Hello. I’m Faith Smith, daughter of Culverton Smith,” she said, timidly. “You might have heard of him. He’s on the telly a lot.”
No prompting needed at all, this time. There was convincing worry in her eyes, which truthfully matched the words she was speaking. It was as if she’d refuelled and become a different version of herself during her break.
“Some more unlucky than others,” the builder said, as something dark flickered across his face, before he merrily continued, “I especially love the roses. My mother’s name was Rose. She would have
pining for one another, each of them in the conviction the other one didn’t feel the same? He almost laughed at the farcicality of the idea, until he realised what it must have been like for Sherlock to witness all John’s endless attempts at romance, even being asked to be the best man at his fucking wedding, and he cringed. He remembered all too well how he’d felt when he thought Sherlock and Janine were in a relationship. And that painful illusion had not even lasted a full day.
Sherlock looked at John, who seemed both impressed and moved. Then at his brother, who was looking on with patient anticipation.
He’d talked about both the mysterious broadcast and the puzzlingly missing sibling to John and half a dozen police officials a great deal over the past four months, but hadn’t managed to find a plausible explanation for either. Even more perplexing had been the fact that the Miss Me message hadn’t been followed up with anything. And seeing as there had been two Moriartys, one of whom had been great at disguising himself, at manipulating people and at being in places he wasn’t supposed to be, the fact that the other one had now mysteriously vanished while his brother’s face had been on every screen in the country, was definitely more than suggestive.
Although the surprise on John’s face upon seeing her enter somewhat reminded her of that other time he’d unexpectedly encountered her in the flat, he greeted her pleasantly and without a trace of discomfort or jealousy this time. Both he and Sherlock had become quite different people since they’d become a couple, Janine mused – although you could only really tell when you saw them together in their own home. In that safe, domestic setting, there was a quiet contentment emanating from the both of them that always conjured a smile to Janine’s face.
“Don’t you… I don’t know.” Sherlock let out a rather dramatic sigh. “Don’t you miss having sex with a woman, now that you’re… well… stuck with me?”
He swallowed, blinking several times. “John,” he said urgently, his voice low, “are you sure you’re alright with this? Us having a dog in the house? What with Chloe still being this little?”
They never told the DI the real story. Naturally, he didn’t want to know. He seemed to know very well where not to look, though.
Sherlock took a long breath in through his nose, trying to cleanse his mind of the chaotic thoughts that had been roaming his consciousness.
John shook his head. The bottle was ready. He walked over to Rosie and picked her off the floor. Settling with her on the sofa, his thoughts once more drifted back to what Mycroft had said. Or rather, hadn’t said.
“Precisely my thought. Not yet sure how, though.” Sherlock chewed his lip. “There’s only one option I managed to come up with so far.”
Lady Smallwood exhaled. “The freelancers not only killed all the hostage takers, but also the hostages themselves. They ran off with an invaluable figurine.”
Arnold switched off the telly and signed something which Sherlock guessed meant, “I will teach you to sign too.” He then slowly made a thumbs-up with one hand, close to his chest, and supported it with his other flat palm underneath, before bringing both hands forwards toward them.
John, who had taken a seat in his usual chair, said, “Let us see if we can be of any help, then… er…
Now it would be a matter of acting very quickly and efficiently. He spotted the shelves with daybooks straight away, but it took him several tries to find the latest one. He quickly leafed backwards to the last entries and stared at them intently, frantically trying to make sense of the guy’s handwriting, which frankly looked as if he kept his books in Hebrew.
Although he looked apprehensive, there was no trace of discomfort in his expression. It was more like awe.
“I’ll just leave you to it then.” He briefly shot them a cheeky glance, then disappeared through the door.
He presses another kiss to Sherlock’s jaw, gently splaying his left hand around Sherlock’s neck, and it almost feels natural, as if they’ve always been doing this. Maybe simply because he’s dreamed about it so often.
Not an hour later, as he floated away on a cloud of ecstasy, with all the laws of nature gone, he felt strong, gentle arms around him, warm and safe.
don’t let yourself lose him by keeping your distance, as you have been doing, and kill yourself slowly inside.” She looked at him intently. “I hate to see you like this. I wish for you to be happy. Both of you. If he wakes up,
close to me. The personal things I’ve shared with her! And all she did was lie. And break the law.” She wearily shook her head. “It gives you a right dent, having trusted someone like that. And then your
He vaguely became aware of the presence of more people. They said things that John was too tired to follow. He had no idea who they were talking about, anyway.
She walked across to the French windows and turned the key in the lock of the door, removing it before she turned back to him.
She took out her phone, considering to text Sherlock, but decided against it. She had nothing to say, really. No riddle for him to crack. And the fewer communications she had during her current mission, the better. Just in case.
Yes, you’re welcome! Your wife, whom you have married, and is therefore your wife, is very important, of course. And your daughter, too!”
Hannah was still around, as Mycroft had insisted he wanted to absolutely rule out beyond any doubt that Eurus had been working together with someone who was still out there, before he let Hannah go. He wouldn’t listen to Sherlock, who had already deduced that she had operated all by herself, ever since Mary died (and even some time before that).
John hadn’t actually thought of that. But he should probably take those as well. Good point. “Er… yes.”
Of course, Janine had tried her hand at fanfiction quite a lot when she’d been much younger, so she had some experience putting fictional characters through tough times. Thinking back to it now, she felt a pang of nostalgia at those good old days. She’d absolutely
“I’m fine,” Sherlock groaned. Never mind that he felt sweat sticking to his body all over and the room spun happily along with every eye-movement he made.
“Goodness, all those complicated, bizarre movements we were supposed to copy. What with my arthritis, I just couldn’t do it. My hands would hurt for days after each lesson!”
He smiled fondly, shaking his head to himself and trying to focus on the shopping list he was compiling.
”) who’d used to hang around the park across from his old family home on late afternoons with her Taekwondo sports bag and shower-wet hair, together with her brother.
Of course, it was nice that he’d recently been seeing slightly more of his old friend thanks to the new situation. Truth be told, however, John was often plain exhausted or preoccupied with work and not very responsive company at all. But that didn’t matter a lot to Sherlock. He just liked to have him around and thus be reminded of the good old days they had spent together, even if they were both different men now. When John was there, Sherlock always felt more alive, more purposeful.
This was the exact kind of dog that Sherlock had used to have as a kid. The one who died in the horrible accident when Sherrinford had saved Sherlock from getting strangled to death in his own dog-walking game.
When he was all the way inside, John started pulling out and pushing back in very carefully, closely monitoring every response from Sherlock, still afraid to hurt him or do something wrong. At the same time, the feeling of Sherlock’s tightness was so wonderful and overwhelming that he was afraid to lose control. But he ardently wanted this to be perfect for Sherlock. He wanted to do everything necessary to make Sherlock never want to leave him.
Sherlock couldn’t help letting out a squeaky laugh. “Oh God, I’ll admit that just ringing your doorbell out of the blue wasn’t the best idea, but at least it wasn’t as badly misjudged as
He had tried meaningful looks, casual remarks, intimate touches even. Oh, Sherlock had responded, with similar – ambiguous – looks, remarks and even touches.
He tried to imagine John sitting behind him in his chair near the fireplace, reading a newspaper. Even though the silence was the same – save for an occasional turning of a page Sherlock had to add in his imagination – ,  there was a huge difference in John actually being there or not, as irrational as it seemed. Just as Sherlock hadn’t really needed him to accompany him to the goldsmith that afternoon, but everything was just so much more...
Sherlock was making a show out of accurately imitating all their voices, causing the corners of John’s mouth to twitch, in spite of his fever.
However, the memory of having left him at the hotel in Mumbai with only his passport and her clothes invariably lightened her mood.
John, however, promptly – and very nimbly – jumped over the back of the bench towards the scrawny thief, practically in the same instant the man had appeared. He managed to grab him by the sleeve as he tried to run away, making the man lose his balance so that he stumbled and fell.
“Dogs have similar nervous systems to ours! They experience pain in the same way. Bentham, the philosopher, stipulates they feel just like we do. So stop it! You’re going to hurt him!”
“It’s… er… probably time for me to go,” he said, trying to focus on something that would make the room stand still. Perhaps he’d overlooked a third bottle earlier.
She was wide awake, but quiet as well, solemnly testing how far the hem of her daddy’s shirt would stretch.
He drank half the glass in one go and took a deep breath, mentally locking the door that had suddenly, though not entirely unexpectedly, flown wide open in the anticyclone that was now his mind.
Unsurprisingly, John had no trouble at all picturing Mycroft as a haughty teenager, although he had to admit, all of this sounded a lot more unpleasant than he’d imagined.
How this conversation is going to go, he has no idea. All he knows is, it’s not going to take place as long as he hangs around in this pub with Greg. And he’s honestly not sure how much more time he can bear to spend in limbo.
As instructed, Molly took off her light pink summer cardigan – while continuing to balance Rosie on one hip and then the other, which was quite a hassle – and switched it for the green one she’d been carrying with her in a flowery, orange-coloured plastic bag. Turning the bag inside out so only the plain white side showed, she stuffed her first cardigan in there. Pulling the elastic out of her hair and shaking it loose, she stepped outside, with two bags and a baby, to where an agent stood smoking a cigarette. Without inhaling, she noticed. But it gave the man an inconspicuous reason to stand there, she supposed.
She even thanked him for all the work of organising Vivian’s funeral and apologised for the fact that she hadn’t been there to help.
And Mycroft was already taking Sherrinford home to their parents, so they weren’t obliged to go and take him.
“John, I don’t think I’m good at this... any of this. At all. I honestly don’t believe you really want this... with me.”
Sherlock sat up, and stared into the darkness while he focused on the calm and reassuring sound of John’s quiet and regular breaths.
When John came home, he walked over to the far end of the sofa to greet Sherlock with a kiss. “Hello, love. How was your day?”
Pigeons were pecking at the ground a few feet away. Dinosaur descendants. Sherlock wished he could fly and peck crumbs, just like they did.
“I’ve got twelve people of MI5 on the new Moriarty case,” his brother’s voice said. “Doctor Watson’s daughter should be sent to a safe place, preferably out of town. I was thinking with Mummy and Daddy. I can send over one of our agents who’s raised a baby herself, to take care of her and guard her at the same time. What do you say?”
John’s lips twitched into a brief smile and he nodded. “Listen, is there anyone you can think of who might possibly want to do him harm or play a nasty trick on him?”
It was as if John was in a way relieved to finally be having this conversation. “Right,” he said, putting the dirty spoon in the sink and pulling up both chairs on that side of the table, turning them so that they faced each other.
Fixing him with her cold gaze, she said, “I lost the two people I loved because of you. So it would only be fair if he died.” Turning her eyes to John, Eurus’s voice was suddenly eerily flat. “Even before she died, he took Rose away from me.”
“Oh, that was just something I...” He smiled, shaking his head, and took a breath “... I said. I’m sure there’s...” He stopped, looking at her for a long moment. “How did you know about that? I didn’t tell you that.”
John was chewing his lips to suppress a giggle at Sherlock’s perfect imitation of a Very Nice But Slightly Scatterbrained Man. Even though John had often wished Sherlock were a bit more considerate, hearing him like this positively made John cringe, making him realise once more that he would in reality never want Sherlock to change a single nerve-ending in his brain. They fit perfectly together just as it was and John felt a fresh eruption of butterflies in his stomach just thinking about it.
“She was, initially,” Sherlock said. “She came back. Mycroft – or rather, MI5 – turned out to be the only party who could provide sufficient excitement and security at the same time.”
He’d always loved it when John thought he was brilliant, but now that Sherlock knew how deep those feelings truly ran, it elicited a more profound response in him as well.
As he took a bite of his forgotten cheesecake, Mycroft considered that he should perhaps, in the first place, try simply to be happy for them, and trust (to a certain degree) that everything would probably be fine – as Sherlock was astoundingly now trusting also. Still, it wouldn’t hurt to take some of the precautions he had just devised, considering the position the happy couple occupied in the public eye and the extortion sensitivity of the situation.
Sherlock technically didn’t know any of this. At least, he never asked or brought up any part of her current private life in their occasional text exchanges. Those were usually about little mysteries either of them was trying to solve and could use the other one’s input in. Or just plain banter.
All he could do was hope that this David bastard with whom Mary had cheated on him – obviously unprotected as she had managed to get pregnant –  wasn’t the type to collect body fluid contagions from across London. Anyway, he would soon find out.
“Yes, I know all that, but please tell me again what you heard her tell our parents about what she saw, exactly. I’m not sure my memory of your previous account is accurate, after all these years. Also, I’ve kind of tried to forget. I might have partially succeeded,” Sherlock admitted, somewhat reluctantly.
, you know? I’m not forcing you to. It’s perfectly understandable that you wouldn’t want someone damaged like me.” Sherlock did not feel bitterness. It was a simple fact that John deserved so much better than such an imperfect relationship.
“So am I,” John replied, looking over in their direction. “And, by the looks of it, so is he,” John smiled. “Not to mention our daughter.”
John pressed his lips together, trying hard not to overly display his arousal. This could be him. This could be him, sliding in and out of Sherlock.
In the following days, Sherlock tried in vain to find another angle to the case, unable to deduce any plausible alternative possibilities of motive or perpetrator of the crime.
with John (a choice surely not made lightly, or it would have been made years earlier). This could not ever be allowed to be broken, because that would break Sherlock – and, by proxy, there would be collateral damage to Mycroft’s own heart as well. Luckily, he knew a couple of tricks that could be used to steer events into the desired direction – or, more precisely, away from an undesirable one.
Sherlock had been so taken aback by this incredible piece of egocentrism that he’d failed to prevent AJ from snatching up the Pearl from among the debris.
“It’s not my place to say,” Sherlock said softly. “But... it was just texting.” He’d not often seen John this emotional.
She noticed the man carefully scanning the street as she stepped past him, and went up the stairs, dumbstruck.
this, in order to be freed from the groove he had been stuck in for over two decades. And he felt sure that with John, he could.
Sadly, Rose’s presence had not even begun to fill the emptiness inside of Eurus that Jim had left behind. Rose herself had, however, soon started busying herself with keeping Jim’s business running. Which apparently
Greg didn’t make such attempts and just shrugged, beaming. “Yes,” he said. “If you must know, we’re very happy together. And yes, it
Witnessing how Sherlock watched out for his brother suddenly made John realise that Sherlock often did something similar for him, as well. He had the ability to flawlessly tune in to what John needed, or what he wanted to avoid, and made sure that any avertable obstacles and situations were steered clear of – greatly helping John reduce his recently resurfaced anxiety in public spaces. John had just never seen it as clearly as he did now, through watching Sherlock do something like this with Sherrinford – even though his needs were quite different, of course.
seemed to have that effect on him, at least initially. Everything had changed once she’d shot Sherlock, of course, let alone when the rest of her background had come to light. But the cherry on the cake had been when Sherlock’s (initially withheld) prediction about John not being the father of the baby turned out to be correct. It had been obvious, really: that David had been rather fishy from the beginning and eventually a DNA test had proven exactly what stream he'd been swimming in.
Sherlock had hardly slept, not trusting the guard to stay awake, or to be alert enough to see through a disguise if he did. On top of which, nobody actually knew what Eurus Moriarty looked like, but him. (Not that he had such a very clear image of her, either, but still.)
Just as the girl slunk away after finishing her lines, though, someone slipped inside through the open door and stepped into the centre of the room before anyone had a chance to tell her not to.
Sherlock bit both his lips at once, as he observed John’s smug grin, not sure whether to smother him, kiss him, or both.
She cautiously put her hand on the door handle, pulling it towards herself slightly before pushing it down, which she knew avoided it making a clicking sound.
John smiled awkwardly. “I’m not sure I want to… finger myself.” The idea was rather preposterous to him, even though Sherlock was right, naturally.
“She's gone Sherlock.” John whispered and clung to Sherlock. “They stitched her eyes shut, named her the blind banker and left her body to rot in her flat.” John's shoulders shook as he cried and Sherlock held on tightly.
“But you couldn't quite possibly bring forward the real culprit could you.” John continued, staring his death glare straight at Jim, his smile never wavering, his gaze never flickering. “Of course not. You would lose your right hand man. The real man behind the death of his sister. Or is that you? Not so keen on the suicide yourself? You must be so set apart from your brother then.”
Sherlock worked best with everything in front of him. He never understood how John could work from the laptop alone. He needed to see everything, every bit of data laid out in front of him. It was easier to deduce when he had all the data. The cases were obviously Moriarty haunting him, taunting him. Possibly even laughing at him. But why now? Sherlock had been back for a couple of months now, so why not the day he returned? What was he planning?
“No, actually. He killed himself.. He probably knew what you were up to and rescheduled our little meeting. He was suicidal anyway, sentiment.” Sherlock shrugged, John flinched as Jim growled, Rosie wailed and the two agents rose from their knees, one in front of John, blocking his view of Rosie and raised his gun, the other in front of Sherlock The difference was that as soon as Jim pointed towards Sherlock, the agent fired and Sherlock went down with a gasp.
They had been together for five months, met in a local pub one night when John was drowning his sorrows. They got chatting and one thing led to another and John had spent the night with her, in her bed. This was the case most nights for five months, the Sherlock returned from the dead and whisked John away into the night. He had still been seeing Mary for a couple more months before had given him an ultimatum. So he chose, and that was just over a month ago.
John smirked a little and stared. He had his findings on the laptop in front of him, ready to argue his case. If anyone can pick it apart, it would be Sherlock. But then again, this was solid evidence.
“John?” his voice was harsh from misuse. A soft gasp beside him had him turning to the sound and found Mrs Hudson by his side. He smiled gently, reached out a hand to take her shaking one, she looked fine at least, apart from some bruising to the right side of her face. “You're OK.” Sherlock smiled, or tried to anyway. Mrs Hudson sniffed, holding back tears no doubt, but she was a strong woman, Sherlock knew.
The other man scoffed. “Yes, but you led them to their deaths and you survived when she should have done. You used her for your own needs.” The other hissed and gave a kick to John's stomach, making him curl in on himself in pain. “How did you manage to survive!?”
"John!" Sherlock startled John from his ramblings. "I was without you for six months, I'm not about to abandon you now, just because things have changed a little."
“How else is the government going to extract the truth from its enemies!?” Sherlock retorted and scowled at his brother. But all his energy was wiped. His breathing had become harsh, almost gasping through constant pain, he needed rest. Which Mrs Hudson could tell as she had increased the morphine just slightly and had called for a nurse to induce a sedative. God bless that woman, Sherlock thought as he slowly slipped back into his own darkness.
“Welcome Johnny boy.” Said the voice and John instantly recognised it from the phone call. John growled but said nothing. The feet came closer, a hand in his hair and Johns head was forced to look into deep blue eyes. He hissed in pain as his hair was pulled. “Don't you recognise me? Well of course you don't. You wouldn't even know me from Adam I suppose. But maybe you know of Charlotte Green?” John flinched at the name and his body stiffened. “Care to tell me about her?”
Sorry about the delay, I've been getting battered by real life at the moment and I'm struggling to find the time to get a chapter posted. I will try but I'm not sure when the next one will be, but thank you for waiting and sticking with me :)
"No!" John glared from the entry way into the kitchen, his arms crossed. "No experimenting on my daughter."
"John"? Sherlock's whisper startled John out of his musing, and he turned to face him. "Well?" Sherlock asked carefully, his voice soft, gentle as though he was approaching a wounded animal.
“Because Moran was a complete moron, he gave us back our tags and clothing, including radios. Which were in good working order. Which was how I knew we were dead when they said they would free us. They cut loose our bonds and led us to the desert and set us free. We ran, all three of us ran for it. I saw the first one go down after five seconds, Bill not long after and he fell right before me so I went down with him, shifting my position just slightly. The bullet meant for my heart, went into and out of my left shoulder instead. I knew I had to remain still and appear dead, the Taliban would not have known to check for the pulse and Sebastian was too far away to check himself, so I remained still and silent, eyes closed not daring to look until the sun set and night fell. I knew they wouldn't be stupid enough to stay out during the night. It was too cold. So when it fell, I radioed for evacuation and kept my radio on so they could triangulate the single. I gathered the other two together and huddled with them. They were dead but the least I could do was ensure they got home. The rest is down to exceptional hospital staff and army medics. I was sure I was dead. Came close too."
“What do you want?” He heard Sherlock ask. He hadn't even noticed the man enter the flat. And by Moriarty and Moran's reactions, neither did they.
"Now Sherlock." Mycroft droned. "You of all people should know that getting a child into 221B would not escape my notice."
“I just got the call.” Greg said as in welcome, walking in step with Sherlock. He sounded out of breath, must have ran from the Morgue. Dating Molly seems to be going well …
“The autopsies revealed nothing either. I'm sorry Sherlock.” She supplied, moving closer. Sherlock in instinct actually held Rosie out to Molly to enable her take a hold. She shifted on her feet but finally took the child and moved to the other side of the bed, allowing Rosie to still be within reach and sight, Molly knew Sherlock a little too well.
“Mycroft.” John held his quiet, sleeping daughter close to him. “Sherlock's in surgery and I need the best paediatrician that you have and that you trust with Anthea's niece. Rosie was with those two sick bastards and I need to know she's okay. She's too quiet, to tired and too warm.” John didn't falter, he was in soldier mode. He couldn't lose it, not now. The people he cared most about, the people that he loves are injured by a mad man. Silently he vows to make sure the next bullet hits Moriarty between the eyes.
“Don't” John's voice stilled the pair of them. “They're doing a trade. This is about me, the killings, the kidnapping, everything. Moriarty was just a pawn, he has his own score to settle with you Sherlock so you'd better be bloody careful. Once he's dealt with then you come and find me OK, not before. Someone will have to ensure Rosie is safe and protected and unharmed. No arguing. If this is not done they will kill her.”
"John?" Sherlock asked, watching with interest. He scanned the basket and his heart hammered against his chest, this is not something he had planned for. But he his his panic well and watched his best friend closely.
He couldn't lose him, not again. Not after all that time they had spent apart. He had died for that man, and he can't lose him now. But what if he did? What if John realised Sherlock is not the kind of man he wanted around his daughter? What if John moved out because it wasn't safe? What if..? What if..?
“Another threat Doctor Watson?” Donovan answered. “You are currently in no position to make threats.”
He didn't hear anything in the room, he was lost in his own head. The images of Mary, and of his unit drifting into his mind, taking control of the situation. He didn't even realise he had begun to hyperventilate as the worst panic attack he has ever had since Sherlock took a nose dive off Saint Bart's roof took complete control.
“Mycroft and John's lawyer are in the other room,” He answered and shrugged, “They've got John's release papers and Mycroft has informed of an impending investigation of the way this was dealt with this morning, and has ensured that I am back on the case.” With that Lestrade nodded and left the room.
"What are you doing here!?" Sherlock hissed, ignoring John for the time being. How long was he in his mind palace for this time?
“We need to ask you a few questions Doctor Watson.” John noticed the formality, and also noticed she still didn't lower her weapon. He slowly moved to place the gun on his bedside table, and raised his hands in surrender.
“Oi!” The man dared to stop John in his tracks, a hand laid to rest against his chest. John glared. “you're not going anywhere...” The man's sentence ended with a cry of pain, as John took the offending hand off of his chest and twisted until the wrist broke. The chief Inspector ended on his knees.
John had opened the letter, read quickly and crushed the paper in his hands. The child was his. The child wasn't even named. Born two weeks ago, premature, Mary had left her at his door step and vanished. she had mentioned she did not want anything to do with the child, but had care to know John wanted children at some point, and would make a great father. The note had confirmed that she will not be back to make a claim for their daughter and only had one wish, that he will look after her.
John laughed. “No. I was actually going to say that these two are a rare set of twins, in that Richard has brown eyes, Jim has blue.”
“Well, not long after your .. Well, hiatus .. Yes, lets call it hiatus. Anyway, not long after that, about two weeks, maybe three. I received an email from a fan. Well she said she liked the stories, and she knew you weren't a fake. Kitty's article had sold like hot cakes by the way. Everyone breathed in that pile of rubbish. I sued for slander by the way. I won in case you were bothered. Mycroft had the best ...”
"Of course." Mycroft knew defeat. "If you both need anything, anything at all. Do not hesitate to ask."
"Yes." Again John looked to Mycroft and shuffled nervously a bit. "Our job can be a bit dangerous at times, but she is safe within these walls. You can remove the surveillance within the flat, but not outside the flat. If we are out and Rosie is within these walls with a nanny, or Mrs Hudson or whoever, and you see something that is amiss outside, you contact one of us straight away, no questions asked, and you get someone over here if we can't make it quick enough."
John turned slowly, his face blank, “Sherlock?” He shifted but he couldn't quite move, his body will not co-operate and a shiver brought him back down to lie against the pillows. “Someone's taken our daughter Sherlock and I bet you my soul that Moriarty was involved in some way the bastard.” John muttered. “I will kill him with my bare hands if I have to, but I will kill him. I will kill them all. I will burn them ..”
He lifted his head and raised an eyebrow to his would be torturer, but no words were coming and John could not quite understand. But then again, maybe whoever this guy was intended to break his fingers? Which would hurt for a while and could have ever lasting effects, depending on how they were treated afterwards. What he was not expecting to see was a collection of wooden tooth picks, sharpened more so at one end, and a small hammer. Suddenly realisation dawned and John struggled relentlessly.
John shrugged her off and stared past her, “And you thought that bringing in everyone and their pissing grandmother was the best way to do this at three in the bloody morning.” John's anger had still not dissipated. It was better to be angry than end up a shaking wreck on the floor. After finding out about Moran, and now this, he knew he will not be sleeping tonight.
It was not long till John woke with a groan. “Rosie?” He murmured, sitting up right with a jolt and a cry. “Rosie!” He yelled.
As soon as the cab reached his destination, Sherlock practically threw notes at the driver and all but jumped from the cab. Lestrade was waiting as directed.
John was a mess most of the evening. His nerves were on edge at the crime scene, seeing the body like that, the message. His face had paled he rang Mrs Hudson straight away. Rosie was fine, of course she was. But still, needed to be sure. He saw Sherlock watching him so he nodded, ended the call with Mrs Hudson and texted Mycroft to get someone at the flat ASAP.
The trip to the hospital was uneventful to say the least. John had decided to ride with Sherlock, Mrs Hudson having to take the second ambulance with Mycroft following behind in his black sedan. No doubt Lestrade will be following that. What a funny little convoy they would have made. John couldn't stop the thought once it entered and he held a sleeping Rosie in his arms.
The first wooden spike entered the space between John's nail and the skin, the hammer taking it right down to the nail bed. John screamed in pain. It was complete agony and just as he was getting used to the throbbing pain, a wooden stick was hammered home in the next nail. John struggled for all he was worth, his throat sore with yelling. He has gone from screaming to swearing to spouting threats and curse words. Anything he could think of. He has never had this before, but he had seen it done to other's, it fucking hurt more than the whips. He would prefer that. Fuck, he would prefer being shot again.
“John..” Sherlock had managed to calm Rosie a little and was moving to calm John. He stopped when Sally raised the gun towards them. Big mistake.
"Stop!" Sherlock forced out, staring at his best friend, taking in the worry, fear, panic. Everything that John was going through at that very moment screamed at Sherlock. "You are not alone. You and Rosie will stay here for as long as you need to. Forever and longer if needs be. No one is going to hurt her, no one is going to take her away from you, I promise."
“But you've found something.” Sherlock answered, his eyes flickering over to Lestrade. “What is it?”
“Yes, I was at home feeding my child that had just turned up on the doorstep. Which can be verified by my flat mate and landlady. Now, what's all this about?” John replied, shifting and trying to take the pressure off of his shoulder.
Then he texted Lestrade. He needed details, he needed answers and he needed to know why Lestrade had not warned them first.
Then they were home and they both rushed out of the cab and straight into Mrs Hudson's home, not really assessing the situation. John didn't hold back, he ran straight in and looked in every room he could, not finding Rosie his panic began to rise. Finally, in the living room was Sherlock, leaning over an unconscious Mrs Hudson, his hand holding her wrist, checking her pulse.
John was receiving a number of stares as he was led to the interview rooms, not straight to a cell as he had thought. He straightened and glared at anyone he could. The look on his face was enough to make them scatter quite quickly. This was going to be a long arsed night, and they still haven't told them why he was arrested in the bleeding first place. John silently hoped Sherlock was alright and his daughter. Just as he said a prayer for their safety, he was shoved into a dull looking interview room, a floor to ceiling on way mirror at the end, and shoved into a chair, he winced his his shoulder pulled again.
"Sherlock!?" The nudge had came without warning and he blinked a number of different times, his phone held loosely in his hand as he gazed somewhat dumbly at John. His John, conductor of light. But he's frowning. Why is he frowning? "Are you alright?"
At some point into the early evening, John had gripped his arm tightly, grounding him and bringing back from a major explosion with Anderson. The sky was darkening and John was getting fidgety. It was no wonder, what with the message and his daughter at home. So Sherlock gave his deductions at lightening speed and whisked John away in a taxi.
John took deep calming breaths and stood straight, “Let's go.” He didn't wait for a reply, instead he stormed from the interview room and down the hall, were he bumped into the Chief Inspector.
“Just like father?” Sherlock asked, searching for Mycroft's answer before he said it. He needed that acknowledgement, somehow he was a young boy again, feeling the boot, the fist and then the belt of his father. Almost dying at those hands when Mycroft saved him. Such rage from his older brother, so much like Father's but Sherlock knew that rage would always be used to protect him, never to hurt him.
John was ready for this and rose from his seat. He deposited the laptop on Sherlock and began to pace the room as he spoke, ensuring Sherlock was following the evidence provided to him.
There was a sound of a door opening and closing behind him, a few sets of footsteps coming closer, one stopping just short of himself, the other sets going around behind him. He assumed one was gathering the chain from a hook in the wall. John was right as he felt his arms being pulled, bringing his legs up just so his toes scraped across the concrete floor. It was then that he realised he was only in his boxers, nothing else covering him and again he groaned. A laugh caught his attention but he kept his head down to his chest, if he tried to lift it up, he would defiantly be sick.
please, enjoy and I will try to get another chapter up over the next few days, but R/L is so busy right now <3 x
When they finally reached the hospital, Sherlock's heart had only stopped the once. But they had it beating again, to the utter relief of John. Sherlock was in surgery as Mrs Hudson was wheeled in, followed by Mycroft and Anthea. John heading straight towards the pair, noticing Anthea was not attached to her phone, but instead linking an arm protectively around Mycroft's arm, walking at his side and close enough to comfort. Maybe the politician did have a heart after all.
That was when John noticed it. A camera, recording live just behind that Westwood wearing psychopath. John's eyes widened and he struggled against his bounds, there was no way he would be used against Sherlock, not again. He couldn't. But it was useless. Whatever they were planning, it appeared that the game had changed.
That was when Sargent Donovan came bursting into John's room, gun also raised. She was damn lucky John was a steady man with the gun, otherwise she'd have been shot in the pissing head. Still, John did not lower the weapon. Instead he glared his best captain glare, hearing his daughter's cries was breaking his heart. He spoke before Sherlock could even open his mouth.
“At eight weeks early, she's doing well. I'll get the bloods assessed and get back to you as soon as possible, but by the looks of things, she'll be sleeping for a while yet. The temperature is not too much but I'll get a nurse to give her something for it anyway. I'll make sure she's monitored and have Mycroft or Anthea assess each nurse and doctor before they enter this room.” With that Doctor Harrison left and John relaxed a little.
Nina Boucher      “Merde,” I muttered under my breath.  I knew I couldn't get lucky enough to have this get swept under the rug so easily. I take a deep breath and look down at my hands, "Ah, yes what happened to Willa was tragic. I still feel awful about it, but like the police said, I wasn't aware of, and I don't think Willa was either, of any food allergies. And the salad she had requested was an exotic one that used all kinds of uncommon flowers and greens. We had to specially import almost all of it."
Greg                      "I know a few of the slang words from my cousin but I just wanna know where I'm gonna be staying, that's all." I shrugged and hadn't been with a man since I was 18 so I was generally playing it cool. Only being half interested
Rosie        I try hard to remember. "We talkeded about how you and Daddy love each other and rings mean the whole world can see it and that if Daddy takes the ring we get bee hives on the roof and don't have to hide them in the basement no more".
Brad Carter          "What it was, is that she was having herself a good time, so I went and had myself a good time too. Then she pops up dead and I got fired!"
Greg                      "I'm fine Myc... Honestly, I'm alright…" I tried to soothe him as the medical team descended on me to cut my shirt, bandaging the wound from the bullet and then looking at James to see getting him into an ambulance
Rosie                     "Gayg looked! I found you some pretty rocks I woulda gotten you flowers but the bees were on them and I counted them and there was more than 20 and I forgot what came after 20 but I named all the ones I saw and the big one is Herbert and you need to come meet them!"
Mycroft                 I take John's hand and let him pull me up, still a bit light-headed, but at least I'm not going to faint, I think.
Mycroft                 I cocked an eyebrow, not entirely believing him, but deciding to let it go for now. "Surely London's criminal classes aren't busy every night."
Rosie                     "Ah Shit. Is you ok Gayg. My Myca can finding anything! He even found Bee when he flew away".
Dillon                    Stepping back I survey the little workspace I've created. My portable table is unfolded and ready, a towel draped over it. My box is open and set up on a table. All I need now is a nice body to work on and I'll be all set.
Sherlock               Spinning around on the pavement I lift my arm, a cab halting by us and allowing us to climb in, my eyes gleaming
John                      “Maybe, I’d like to stay in then. I’m always on the run. Maybe I’d like a quiet night, just relaxing here in the room.” I grin back at him.
Rosie                     "It was yummy. We had tea and Papa forgot the princess hats and Myca isn't sleeping with Gayg cause Papa checked the bathroom and my brain burns and mouth tastes funny". I open my mouth really wide so he can see how funny it feels.
Greg                      "We mainly share his bed… haven’t really got to my suite yet... And we're not gonna be able to find Nina." I called as I jogged to catch up with him, wondering what the hell he'd been searching on his phone for.
James Morgan            "It's a date." I leave the bar and wait til I'm around the corner before I clap in glee. I whistle a happy tune all the way home. Now I just need to figure out who to call so I can get John on that Shuttle...
John                      I laugh with him starting to relax a bit and forgetting my fight with Sherlock. He grabs my hand once we are out of the theater. He asks if it’s ok. I just nod, not knowing how to feel.  As we quickly head towards the shuttle, I start to worry if my hand is sweaty.
Mycroft                 I looked at Sherlock, slightly panicked. "Surely, we can find a reasonable solution, Rosie."
Mycroft                 Rosie ran down the hall, and break and I got up to follow her. I looked at him sternly.  "You are never to call me that in front of Sherlock, understood?
Mycroft                 "Mmm... good, because I wouldn't want to come between you and your television watching..." I purred flicking my tongue along the edge of his ear. I felt him shiver, so I knew I was having an effect on him.
Sherlock               Frowning I see Rosie sleeping, then turn the volume up my end, yelling, "BOMBEE??" as loudly as I can
Mycroft                 "Rosie, why don't you and Papa sit on the sofa, and Uncle Mycroft will get you some lemonade," I said, Slowly getting up and putting a firm hand on Sherlock's shoulder. "Calm down, brother, and for God's sake, stop swinging her around. Unless you want her to throw up on you..." I went to the kitchen and poured a small glass of lemonade, adding a bit of extra sugar making it a bit more palatable for toddler taste buds. I was leaving the kitchen when Greg walked by, having finished his run and looking quite pleased. He smiled pleasantly, and headed toward his room. The sight of him shirtless, skin glistening, took my breath away for a moment. He closed his bedroom door, and I walked back into the living room.
Rosie                     "Ok Myca." I shimmy off Papa and lead him to my room. Opening my closet I find a new outfit while Papa changes.
Mycroft                 "Greg is in the gym. Probably on the treadmill, since the security team won't let him take his usual morning run."
James Morgan      "She said to meet her at 1pm. That gives us time to see the first floor and lunch before the Shuttle. What would
Sherlock               Standing on the steps I'm looking very grumpy, hands in my pockets and staring at the ribbon in something close to fear. I know Mycroft had set me up to be the one to do this idiotic ceremony. He had donated some of the Holmes fortune to the museum under a private account and had stipulated I be the one to cut the damn ribbon. Muttering to John I scowl at the crowds, "Why am I here? Why me? Why do I have to wear the death frisbee?" I'm tempted to grab my hat and fling it out across the stairs
Peter Harkness    I sensed he was leaving something out but thought it was about him having a side project looking into Smith’s demise and playing his cards close to his vest. “Impressive resume then?” I joke and flash a quick smile and subtle wink before taking a big swing of my beer as our food arrives.
Mycroft                 "We had both had a significant amount of wine. It would have been ill-advised." I said sadly. "As much as I wanted to..."
Mycroft                 "Yes, of course I do," I wince just a little as I move over, giving Rosie a spot to snuggle up alongside me, and patting her back. "Thank you for letting Bee stay with me. He was very helpful."
Greg                      "No, no, I wouldn't do that because he'd know something was terribly wrong. All I said was that I didn't trust him and we should keep it that way. Just until we know more about what happened to Ms. Smith. 'I explained and wondered why he hadn't asked why I flirted and kissed Peter.
James Morgan      After a nice dinner and escorting John around the Capital Building I know it's time to take him home.  “Care to come to my place? There's a 24-hour coffee shop right next door. I promise I'll leave your virtue intact. Boy’s Oath or something like that."
Greg                      "Assumptions?" I question as I take a bite of a prawn cracker and perch down opposite him on the small table. I saw he was mainly looking at his food so looked down at mine.
Greg                      I yawned as we walked down the hall and looked round as he stood in the doorway of my room. "What?" I ask softly, turning on the bedside light so I could see where I was going.
Sherlock               Reaching the car, I pause, staring at it, "This car is deflective. The steering wheel is on the wrong side. How am I meant to drive this?"
Greg                      "Please, Mycroft..." I moaned as he ground against me and I wanted to feel him in me, the gift basket in the corner of Mycroft’s master bedroom where he'd moved it out of sight of Rosie. I didn't feel comfortable taking him yet.
Greg                      "I know and I dunno, just feels like I'm meant to be a dad. Like it's a part of me missing, I've always felt it." I said softly, and I knew he wasn't exactly going to spill any of this to anybody else.
Sherlock               Beaming, I lick some honey off one of the tasting sticks, chatting happily with the stall holder about the honey, picking out some jars to take back with me
Mycroft                 "And now your brother... I'm sure that doesn't help." I said. "I never imagined my life with children, but spending time with Rosie... I can see the draw. Perhaps someday," I thought a bit wistfully.
Greg                      I was mainly keeping my eyes closed as I started to ride him a lot harder and the hand I was holding, I put on my hip where I could feel him holding back. I was moaning profanities with his name mixed in and looked down at him when he spoke actual words rather than swears or my name.
John                      I give the door a soft knock and let myself in. I walk through the foyer and peek into the kitchen, to see Mycroft sitting at the table by himself. “How are you feeling this morning?”
John                      I watched him look around. “Yes, Sherlock is here, being insufferable as always.” I lowered my head and voice, “But he hasn’t left. I had to threaten him with an experiment ban to get him to eat a triangle of toast.”
My brother's situation is fresh in my mind. He lost something precious once. It damaged him, and I fear it damaged me in return. Caring is not an advantage. But I am helpless in the face of John -SH
Sherlock               My eyes close, leaning to touch my head with Rosie's, dark curls against bright sunshine, murmuring, "I am an impossible man to live with."
Greg                      "Okay, let's put the nail polish down for a minute." I say as I feel the polish seeping through my old shirt and I pull her onto my lap as I could hug her then while I finished Mycroft’s nails.
Mycroft                 "I am aware, thank you." Anthea and I had spoken at length about what would be needed, if I were to be discharged next week. "She will also be speaking to Dr. Watson, as the only way the hospital is willing to let me leave next week is with a promise of direct medical supervision."
I finish hanging Mycroft's jacket in the hall closet and nod to Mycroft before heading out the front door.
Greg                      "Thank you... We, Um, haven't really been together long. The three weeks here just made us get to know each other better. We would only briefly talk before this." I smiled weakly at first and I was tapping my foot on the floor resisting the urge to get up to throw the physio out before anything happened.
John                      “Tomorrow morning. I can stop by on my way to the surgery.”  I grab up my things. “And no smoking.” I say pointing at him.
Mycroft                 I saw a flash of darkness in his expression, and stroked his stomach with my free hand. "Good?" I asked quietly.
Greg                      I knew Mycroft was going to be tired, sore and probably with a dark mood so I was going to try to help him when he needed it rather than molly-coddling him. I smiled softly at Anthea and couldn't work out whether Mycroft was happy to see me.
Sherlock               I give John a small glare, muttering, "I thought we agreed we'd be staying up here another week to celebrate?"
Mycroft                 I reached for a piece of toast. "You find me... mysterious?" I asked, as I spread some marmalade onto my toast.
Sherlock "Bees..." I look back at the Rosie, my smile still slightly tainted with sadness but it fading, just lingering in the corners of my eyes now. "We'll have to ask Grandma Hudders." I ignore the question of a dog and more children
Greg                      "Sure. I honestly haven't thought or been with a man since I was 18. First year of the police service and one of my female friends dragged me to a gay club. Handsome guy started flirting with me, so I thought, why not." I nodded so he wouldn't have to completely open up and thought he could use a bit of humour.
Mycroft                 "I suppose. I don't expect we will be confined to house much longer, actually - Sherlock seemed to be making significant headway on solving the case."
Rosie                     "No Not a tater." I love my Antea. Why would Papa call her a ugly vegible.
Nina Boucher      When we reach the gazebo, I set my cloth bag full of shopping down on the table and sit next to it. I pull out my reusable bottle and take a swig of water from it and wipe the faint hint of sweat that had gathered there in the rising morning heat. "What do you mean? I told you everything?" I lie, worrying about what they could have possibly uncovered.
Mycroft                 "Anthea is coming by shortly, Greg," I said, trying to avoid making eye contact, though I'd noticed he'd turned about as red as I did at my niece's innocent observations.
Mycroft                 I stared into my coffee cup. "I'm sorry for leaving so suddenly last night. I'm just... not good at this sort of thing..." I could feel the color creeping onto my cheeks.
Sherlock               Biting into my own meal I frown as I watch him push his plate away, before leaning to refill both our wine glasses, "You hate it here. You hate this assignment."
Greg                      "It's because I stopped him from sleeping with me. We got flirting when we went out to dinner, got back to my suite and started kissing a little. That's when I stopped it. Because of my gut feeling." I sighed and felt sick trying to explain that to him.
Mycroft                 "I need you. Right now." I purred. I reached over and grabbed the condom packet, ripping it open and rolling the condom onto my cock with a quiet moan.
Greg                      "We need somebody to translate the Russian and my connections in the UK are not available. I know they're going to be personal, but we don’t know if there's any more clues in these to what Ms. Smith was involved with." I said cautiously and watched his expression harden.
Peter Harkness    “So you got a girlfriend back home you’ll be missing here?” I ask hoping to get a better idea of if his predilections.
Greg                      I jolted awake when I heard a clicking sound somewhere, my ears picking it up and I crept out of bed to pull on my trousers. I didn't have my gun with me as I'd left it in Mycroft’s office, but I leant against the wall to try to hear what they were doing.
Greg                      I roll my eyes again when I hear the name Holmes, walking in behind James and I saw the elder brother walking towards us. I shook my head just enough that they wouldn't see but kept my hands in my trousers pockets
Mycroft                 "Why not, indeed," I mumbled mostly to myself, my mind wandering. He had already said I interested him, that I had a 'hint of mystery'... but handsome? Not possible, I thought grimly.
Sherlock               "Mycroft." I snap, waiting for the kettle to boil, "She doesn't need to know about -that-"
Mycroft                 "Sshh... Sher... Sherlo..." I whispered. I couldn't get any air. The edges of my vision started turning dark.
Greg                      "Very good." I whispered, and I met his eye to let him know that I needed reassurance, just to know that I could do this. It was a lot to let someone see me so raw like this.
Sherlock               Emerging from the bathroom I kneel back onto the bed, starting to run the flannel over my soldier's still solid body, "I never believed it was the source of our argument but I thought it may make you a little less likely to leave me if I returned it." Glancing at him as I clean I can't hide the slight vulnerability in my eyes
Greg                      "At least we know my reactions are up to scratch." I grinned when I took his hand and we made our way up as if we were headed to his suite, standing in the lift still holding hands. It made me feel like I was 20 years younger again.
Mycroft                 I chuckled. "Yes, my dear, I think that is correct." I beckoned her over, and helped her climb up into my lap. She was careful not to hurt my shoulder in the process. "I can tell you all sorts of fun stories about Papa. Did you know when he was your age, he -"
Sherlock               "Thanks....Janet." Nodding to her I spin on the spot for a quite dramatic coat splay, waving to Lestrade, "Come along Graham. Brad. Let’s find somewhere to do brunch and coffee."
Dillon                    Gasping in shock I stumble back, then grab my equipment in slightly shaking hands, glancing at the two men before attempting to flee the house
Sherlock               Looking down, my hand twitches again, then I nod, "Tell me why you suspect she was murdered brother?" I stay where I am, allowing his head to rest on my hip
Rosie                     "Balloons!" I came back wearing my newest bee dress and carrying the box of balloons I found in the pretty basket on Unca Myca’s bed.
John                      I appear behind Sherlock and run my left hand through my hair, a dark titanium band can be seen on my ring finger.
John    “Is that in the Smithsonian? Sherlock and I were thinking about making a day of it before we head back to London.”
Greg                      "Because there are people I do trust with personal information and those I do not. Our driver isn't one of them." I said seriously yet smiled softly just so Peter wouldn't be getting suspicious of anything.  (speaking in French)
John                      changing my mind about the tea I go over and pick up Rosie from in front of Mycroft. “Actually, I think it’s about time we go home, don’t you think Sherlock?”
Sherlock               Flopping down in the chair, I fold my arms, "You go and eat Gavin. I'll stay here. There's a bag arriving soon with a change of clothes for us each, chargers and other bits."
Greg                      "What were you trying to deduce then?" I asked quietly as I washed the dishes, thinking about how I'd been evasive last night and how I'd lied to him.
Greg                      "He could barely find his arse or his elbow. Just don't worry about it for now, concentrate on the sniper." I sigh as I stand straight again, knowing Anthea had to head off pretty quickly but I looked at Mycroft as he butted in.
Mycroft                 I raise an eye brow and smile. "Certainly - I will go get that for you." I head off to the loo and grab a tube of toothpaste, returning to the kitchen with it, careful not to let Rosie see the tube as I hand it to Greg.
Brad Carter          "This isn't about the thing in the bathroom, is it? I swear it was just a little pot. It's medicinal!" I look over and see my manager walking towards me. I cannot afford to get in trouble, again.
Mycroft                 I could see that Lestrade wanted me to stay awake, but the draw of the darkness was too much, and my eyes closed. I was enveloped in the darkness, but I still heard him speaking to me, and to others, and I was gently moved about, presumably into an ambulance.
Mycroft                 I paled. Willa tried to poison someone? And instead, was the victim? "Why... why would Willa do that?" I replied quietly, struggling to maintain my composure.
Greg                      I loved his laugh, the way his eyes lit up but I got on with taking his old bandages off rather gently. I didn’t often like talking about children and I met his eye when he asked me about them. I wouldn’t even know if he knew that I'd almost begged Caroline for us to try for kids.
Sherlock               Flopping down I sit nice and neatly, looking quiet and attentive while wearing a friendly smile to Nina
Mycroft                 Once I heard the main doors close, I looked at Greg. "Sherlock is a little over-protective. Sorry about that," I said with half a grin. I rose and went to the wardrobe, getting dressed in a fresh suit. I frowned at Greg's ruined shirt, and handed him one of my shirts - one that was now a bit too large in the shoulders for me. "Hopefully, this will do."
Mycroft                 "Why don't we go watch your favorite pirate movie, Rosie?" I reached out my hand and she grabbed it, walking with me to the living room.
Sherlock               Rolling my eyes I move around, heading for the door leading off the office, "The codes for the security system. It would make sense for my brother to keep them close." Opening the door, I barge through eagerly
Sherlock               Grabbing a small plastic cup I lift it, "Look Rosie. I have the cups you like." dropping it, I make a grab for the teapot, "And this....teapot thing. Uncle Mycroft looks thirsty."
Lestrade. You know me. You know how insufferable I am to be around, even for short times working together on cases. John puts up with me constantly. He was not aware I was coming here. I followed him onto the plane and claimed his hotel room as my own. He may have been upset that I wanted him to spend time with me on his one day free from the conference. He seemed upset. I don't know how to fix things. I may be too late -SH
Sherlock               Nodding to them both I set the laptop on the nearby table, sitting on the edge of the bed and keeping my voice low, "Tell me everything."
Mycroft                 I walked slowly and carefully to my desk, my head still a bit fuzzy. "I have always trusted you with my brother's well-being, Lestrade. Now I have entrusted you with mine, as well."
Greg                      "What is this Maryland thing about anyway? I only saw the leaflet briefly before you literally ran out the door." I said to break the silence between us as it would be an hour’s journey.
Peter Harkness    “Well, welcome to the United States of American then! I’ve been to a lot places in this world and nothing else like being here. I’m sure you got briefed on American etiquette, but you got any questions for me? Happy to help” as we drive through the city.
Greg                      "I know Sherlock, I know.  I'll have to find a change of shirt at the hospital." I muttered, and my stomach was still turning horribly, my swallowing pushing it down, but I knew I would need to throw up when John and Sherlock went into the hospital.
Sherlock               There's the sound of the front door opening, "....but you like your uncles, Rosie. Anthea said she'll help also. It won't seem that long, I promise"
Greg                      "Yeah, yeah, he's fine. Just breathe, you're hyperventilating, Mycroft." I say softly as I hold him still and use my other hand to turn his head towards me, so he could focus on my voice. I knew medication could give you nightmares if strong enough.
Sherlock               Leaning back in my seat a little I nod, my face calm and controlled, "I suspected as much. The letters in Russian, the flower...Nina. The police report is done with." Shrugging a shoulder, I continue bluntly, "No one beyond us needs to know your involvement. We do however need to know the name of her guest."
Greg                      I'd frozen merely when I saw Mycroft’s fingers twitch, it obviously taking a lot of effort for him with the way his heart rate was going. I found a nurse who watched over his vitals and went about lowering his sedation bit by bit until he's semi-conscious.
Mycroft                 "I think that's better than the nightmares, to be honest. I can't be waking Lestrade up at all hours..."
Greg                      I went for the sommeliers recommendation from the menu and we were silent until I'd taken a sip of my wine. It was exquisite. "Can I say something?" I asked and tried to relax a little.
Mycroft                 I chuckled, Sherlock was being his typical self, it seemed. I doubted we would manage a conversation of any worth this evening. The chef brought in our meals, and set them on the small dining table I had brought in. I motioned to Sherlock to take a seat.
Greg                      "I'm sorry Nina but this is really important and should only take about 10 minutes of your time. It really is urgent." I stressed when sherlock tried to drag me away and I didn't want to have to wait ages to talk to her.
Mycroft                 "Uncle Mycroft will get up in a moment, Rosie," I said tiredly from under the pile of blankets.
James Morgan     "Well Gents, seems you two are already on friendly terms so no need for me to stay. You have my number if needed and I'm sure Peter will have no problem waiting around for Mr. Lestrade to be done here so he can show him around." I share a wink with Peter on my way out. "Call if you need anything. Bye bye"
Peter Harkness    “Yea, he checks out. Other than drunken stupidity as a teen and a recent divorce, his report looked like an Eagle Scout’s” I whisper back to James.
Sherlock               There's the sounds of shouts from inside the embassy, then I appear, wrapped in a sheet with bare feet and a riot of curls, racing as fast as I can towards them. There seems to be another, smaller person caught in the same sheet, stumbling along and shouting in a gruff army voice for me to slow down
Mycroft                 I turned on my bedside light. I just wasn't going to sleep tonight - too many things on my mind. With a sigh, I picked up a book, deciding that reading was a better choice than staring at the ceiling in the dark.
Mycroft                 Satisfied that Greg was uninjured, I reached into my pocket with my unbloodied hand, the incessant vibration of incoming text messages becoming irritating. "Greg, Sherlock says something is going on at the Capitol Building."
Mycroft                 I groaned, and reached over to grab my phone, and rolled my eyes. "Greg, Sherlock insists we turn on the television. "
Greg                      "He's gonna come back to find his bloody house demolished." I said numbly and barely felt Mycroft’s hand on my knee. I was glad there wasn't any casualties but it was still a kick to the gut, that house being something they decorated and spent thousands on themselves.
Anthea                  "Dimmock is only working on looking into the sniper. They assigned Smithson to your break in, I believe you know him? He said he would be calling you soon."
Greg                      "So, what did you think of what we watched? No 10 is my favourite doctor with no 9 coming in very close behind." I smiled as I wrapped my arm around his shoulders and thought it was very domestic with one of our rarer days off.
Greg                      "If you'd like to. Don't feel inclined just because I asked." I raised an eyebrow to see whether he was genuine about the offer, my eyes trying to read the smile he gave me.
Sherlock               Kicking my long legs out in front of me I scowl into the distance, "NoPe." I pop the P in a way I know irritates my brother.
Sherlock                       Snapping my jaw shut I collecting myself, pulling my posture straight and gripping my jacket in one hand, "What on earth on -you- doing here brother?" I spit the word in distaste. "Did you finally get tired of pulling the strings of the British Government and decide to branch out? Or did you accidentally eat one of her Majesty's corgis?"
John                      “You’ve been smoking again?” I cross my arms. “That hinders the healing process you know.”
Greg                      I knew he wasn’t the violent type but still took small steps towards him, put my hand around his waist slowly so it wouldn’t be a complete shock to set him off again. I could hear his shaky breaths and did the same with my other hand, so he could calm down a little.
Dillon                    Giving a huff I keep moving, ignoring his yells, "Oh you've been a bad boy, haven't you?" Tugging back on his shoulder with my palm I try and feel the extent of the damage, "So bad. You've been overdoing things"
Mycroft                 "Yes, Carlton, thank you." I take a seat in the chair as he tucks the drape around me. I quietly watch Greg making tea as Carlton begins his work.
Sherlock               I return the look with a slightly sulky one, clutching my honey bag to my chest after checking it was all undamaged, "I'm not an utter socially inept fool Lestrade. I do have some human decency, though being raised alongside Mycroft it's a wonder any survived."
Mycroft                 I started gently massaging Greg's feet with my good hand, as my shoulder was quite sore from the day's exertions. "So you went from wanting to be a pilot to wanting to be a police officer?" I asked.
Greg                      I sigh a little when he starts to nibble and kiss his way down my jaw and neck, my hand on his hip going round to squeeze his arse while the other went up into his hair. I felt up his back and when his hands on my skin went down to my jeans, that's where I stopped grinding against him and put both of my hands on his chest to put some distance between us.
Sherlock               There's something slightly distracted in my voice, "Emails sent to an account I've been unable to trace. Different addresses and ISPs every time but the same theme. Talking about a target, plans, all extremely vague and I suspect in code for the most. There was one email though sent the day she died saying 'the target would no longer be a problem.'"
Mycroft                 I leaned over and gave him a peck on the cheek, and gave him a sly smile, saying nothing. A quiet whine came from the floor, and I looked down to see the warm brown eyes of Zoltan, the Visla pup that the Hungarian ambassador had delivered last week. "Now one of us has to get up, Greg... the king needs someone to accompany him on his walk."
Greg                      "Understandable. Do you have any concerns about anybody? Anybody you've spoken to or around you?" I ask then and am intrigued with what his theory was.
Mycroft                 I couldn't take it anymore. I closed my book. "I think I will head inside, Greg. When you come in, perhaps you should change my dressings again?" I asked.  First, I'm treated to the shirtless view of him, and now I'm asking him to put his hands on me... I must be mad.
Greg                      "No, no, that's not the priority at the moment. Just work with Dimmock on who tried to shoot Mycroft." I waved as I put my arms on the worktop and tried to calm down. I didn't even know if anything had been taken yet.
Sherlock               Walking into Mycroft's room, my head is down, flipping over pages on the clipboard I hold and occasionally scribbling on the bottom of one or two, "Anthea is having adjustments made to your home to allow you easier access. I didn't think to inquire what they are. Locks on the fridge maybe." Flopping down into the chair I flip over another page, scanning it
Greg                      I dump my bags on the bed, take a quick look around the room before heading out with Peter again. He decided to start us chatting once we were heading down the side block towards the grill.
Carlton                 "About five years ago, when the younger Mr. Holmes pulled his Lazarus," attempting to be subtle as I watched the little girl walk back out into the sitting room. "I understand she's his charge now?" as I nod my head at her, standing in front of Gregory combing thru his fringe.
Mycroft                 "Bee shall stay, then. He is very helpful.  I will take good care of him for you."
Greg                      "I'll have to get some practice in but we all need a way to blow off steam." I give him a cheeky grin as we head into the grill, it being stereotypical to what he thought it was going to be.
Greg                      "It's alright Mycroft, I'm here." I frowned slightly as I perched on the edge of the bed, putting the towel on his head and just thought he was having another nightmare. I also knew fevers could do that.
“We were on a mission to seek and destroy a Taliban nest. People who would traffic British children, strap them to Semtex and force them into bitch compounds and detonate. We had excellent Intel on one of those nests and our mission was to destroy the lot. It didn't go well, we had a leak in command and our position was compromised. I ordered to evacuate but it was too late. We were captured and tortured over a week. There was ten of us, and only three of us survived the week. We were released into the desert and shot. Two bled out into the sand before the evac team found us. I survived. Charlotte had not survived the torture.”
John was unaware of how much time had passed when he came to. His arms were chained above his head, the chain looping over a link in the ceiling and down the wall. He couldn't really take in much of the place, it was damp, cold and dungeon like. He must be in a cellar of some kind. His knees were beginning to ache but he felt too weak to stand. His head was spinning, his stomach was churning and he was sure he will end up spilling his breakfast all over himself. He tried taking deep breaths which did not help at all, he groaned instead, trying to take in everything but gave up when his head began to protest.
“You love me?” He had asked, and Mycroft had stilled in pushing John out the room, forcing him to answer.
John was marched into Scotland Yard, flanked on either side. To left was Donovan, gripping his arm tightly as his hands were cuffed behind him. A second officer walked on his right, not touching him, only giving side long glances and smirking every step of the way. A few officers led the way, while the remaining that had busted in their home early that morning where walking behind, obviously to avoid any escape attempt. Like that was going to happen. John's face was like thunder, pain and anger flashing in his eyes. Donovan really did a number on his left shoulder, and he vowed to make her pay for that, as well as aiming a gun at his daughter. He silently swore to have her badge.
“Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, she spoke of Jim being a little creepy. Her words. He would lash out, make people beg and plead for their stuff back. He'd take their dinner money of course, make them pay for his services. Even back then he was building a web. Vicky even said she believed he had the teachers in his back pockets too. The school was never the same when them two started.” John shivered and motioned to the two pictures of the two boys.
WOW! I honestly cannot believe how many hits this has already, I'm honestly touched. I do hope you're enjoying this. If there's any errors that jump out let me know.
John went silent and limp as the hand released his hair, his head dropping back to his chest. John's shoulders shook, but not due to cold or the want of more serum. But due to tears that fell for his fallen comrades.
“At least tell me why I'm here?” John said after a while. “Is this pay back for breaking the Chief Inspector's nose? Is he watching right now.” John glared at the glass. “I'd happily provide a replay if you're asking for one.”
“Anthea has given me the history yes.” He stopped in his approach and waiting for confirmation from John. “I'm Doctor Harrison.” He held out a hand, again he waited, letting John make the move, allowing him some form of control over the situation.. John felt 8immediate respect for the man in front of him. John stepped forward and shook the offered hand and stood slightly to the side, but still close enough to the cot so that he ensured his daughter always remained in his line of sight. He was beginning to wish he had brought his gun with him, just for the comfort.
"That is my vow and always will be. I will always be here for the two of you. I will protect you always and I will die before anyone hurts her." Sherlock replied and pulled John into a hug once more. He was being overly sentimental today, but he could see John needed it.
He watched Sherlock as he retold the story of Vicky, he watched Sherlock as he leaned in that little bit close. He watched as he whispered gently, looking out for all the signs Sherlock had told him to look out in the past. He saw Sherlock swallow hard, he saw his pupils dilate a little, and he saw the little vain in Sherlock's neck pulse. Then Rosie cried, and he stepped back.
“I ain't leaving either.” Lestrade piped up, gazing hard at Mycroft and crossing his arms against his chest as if daring him to make a move. Mycroft only nodded as a television set was wheeled in and the door made secure.
Sherlock snarled and walked faster, making his way towards the interview rooms. “No.” Was all he said before trying every door he came across. The third door he opened held the chief inspector, and beyond the glass was Donovan, yelling at John. Sherlock noticed straight away John was having a PTSD episode and he stormed out, ignoring shouts from the Chief, glad that Lestrade had held the man back.
Sherlock went to John, ignoring Donovan's comments, he glared at Smith, daring him to say something, and turned back towards his friend. “John,” he called gently, his hands moved to hold John's face gently. He wasn't sure when Lestrade came by his side, but he was thankful for him, as he had released John's cuffs and stepped back. “John, look at me, it's Sherlock.” Sherlock's voice was so soft, so gentle as he brought John's face up so he can stare into the man's eyes. “You're safe John. Both you and Rosie. You're safe, I promise.” Sherlock kept talking softly, enticing John from his mind. He couldn't help but smile softly as John blink and shuddered.
"Therefore, you found that you hand too stick your nose in where it is not wanted. John does not, and will not be on his own in this. We don't need you and your sniveling. Good day."
"Then we will adapt. I meant what I said when I returned. I'm never leaving you behind again. I'd be lost without my blogger."
But there was no other word. Plus, John had said this was about him. The murders and the kidnapping, and Jim was just a pawn in the whole scheme of things. But why? Why John?
After what had seemed like an age, Sherlock spewed his deductions and they were finally on their way home. John couldn't keep still and he was worse the closer they got. As soon as 221B was in view, John exited the cab and went straight for Mrs Hudson's flat. Finally, with Rosie in his arms he could relax a little and he made his way after Sherlock.
It was some while later when John awoke. Another hour or two had passed while he was out cold in the chair. His many aches and pains where making themselves very clear right now and he couldn't help a groan and a soft sob that escaped him. His body shivered and his mind felt sluggish. One good thing about the truth serum was that it dulled the pain. If only he could have some of that now. He needed it. He was desperate, he may do just about anythi … 'No!' the logic in his mind supplied. 'Stop it, you're fine. You'll be fine.'
With that done, he had eased a little, but not a lot. He was still on edge, biting his tongue a lot harder than normal. He still couldn't understand how the bloody police thought this was a dump and run. This was staged obviously, even John saw that. Even a monkey would be able to see that the building being assigned for demolition was nothing but a coincidence.
Sherlock's posture stiffened as John clung onto him. It was strange but John felt the anger vibrating through every inch of him. John suddenly became wide awake, pushing the thoughts of Mary aside, he'll deal with those later. Something was wrong, something to do with that damn phone. John removed himself from Sherlock and looked up at his best friend, he used one hand to wipe at his eyes and he composed himself, suddenly soldier ready.
His people were distributed, hospital staff were questioned, CCTV was confiscated, but still nothing. Rosie and her capture had vanished into thin air, so it would seem, and this is what made Mycroft so damned furious. No one gets passed him and his surveillance and lives to tell the tail.
“Carl Powers. Jim had to stop him from laughing. He never said who he was laughing at.” Sherlock did feel a pang of pity for Richard, only slightly. After all, he still threatened His John.
“No, it's a promise.” John replied in his 'captains' voice. “And I will be making a formal complaint about this, mark my words. Where's Lestrade?”
Sherlock had had checked out so John looked after his little girl. Fed her, bathed her and changed her. Then he settled her down for the night and got to work. He was not idle during Sherlock's adventure. He was, as Mary had put it, obsessed. But he had gathered more intel than anyone else because he knew where to look. Or rather, it was a happy incident.
He lunged forwards, shocking the man in front of him and let his fists fly. If he could knock the guy out then ring the alarm before he passed out then Rosie would be safe. His hits were a little of and sloppy as the drug was taking effect, but he connected. The man appeared to have recovered from his shock and swung at John, landing a hard punch to his face, John felt his nose break. He went down, and he struggled. He grabbed at the man's legs and pulled, the man kicked back, hitting John on the side of his face. His head snapped back, his cheek burned and blackness surrounded him.
He had ordered everyone from his room once John had left, even Mycroft when he returned with Rosie. He did advise that she was fine, no more sedatives remained in her system and she was resting peacefully, ass all new born children tend to do.
That was when Lestrade walked in with Molly behind him, looking as nervous as she always did. Sherlock kept his gaze on Rosie, making sure he catalogued everything so he would know when she breathed out of turn.
Molly gasped and held Rosie a little closer, protective instinct. She'd make a good mother one day. The deduction flew through Sherlock's mind without warning, just before his initial one took hold, his hands grasping the sheets tightly.
Sherlock stared at the two portrait photos that were now pinned to the wall of 221B Baker Street. Pinned around them were articles and crimes and even the petty little thefts. Everything that John had found he had pinned to the wall. There was a lot he discarded as pointless, which now lay burning in the fire place. He picked apart most of John's work, but not in a bad way. He couldn't. John had actually, possibly by complete accident, stumbled upon something outstanding. He will always be Sherlock's conductor of light, even if he was an idiot.
"Copycat killer," Sherlock muttered, finally coming out of his head. The room was bathed in a full light, John was in his chair, baby monitor on the table next to him. Rosie must be in bed, it was late into the evening now. "Has to be."
“Seb. Do as he says, we're done here. I have what I need.” Jim hissed in pain. Sebastian lowered Rosie on the couch, inched away from John and went straight to Jim. John followed them, gun poised and ready to fire as the two mad men escaped from the flat. John was unsure how long he stood there for, but Rosie's wailing brought him back to himself. He reached for her and held her close as he went to Sherlock's still form, blood seeping from the gun shot wound to his chest.
“Is that so?” Sherlock stared back, his heart beating that little bit faster the closer John got. Soon enough, there was hardly any space between them at all. John had to crane his neck slightly. Sherlock swallowed.
John had made his tea and went to sit in his chair, resting the hot beverage against the arm and stared into the darkness. He was still moping about, his last relationship had not really worked out. Mary she was called. She was beautiful, always made John laugh, and she was there to hold his hand through the few months Sherlock had been gone. But as soon as he had returned after 6 months of being dead, John went back with him. Mary was not amused. An ultimatum was given and in John's defense, if she had loved him as much as she had proclaimed to, then she would not have made him choose. Right?
“Liar!” Donovan threw the crime scene photos against the desk, right in John's view and he was lost. He saw Mary utterly beaten, her face bruised, her body cut and beaten, her could count the number of broken bones. She must have suffered so much. But the worse thing were her eyes. Her beautiful eyes, they were stitched closed, with perfect stitching. No wonder they though of John, giving his Doctor background.
Sherlock paled and stood stock still. He ignored Lestrade but turned to face John. John who had gone as white as a sheet. His phone in a trembling hand as he spoke calmly to Mrs Hudson. Once he had hung up, he quickly fired off a text. Sherlock knew he was getting Mycroft to keep an extra eye on the flat. When John nodded, Sherlock turned towards the crime scene, taking in every detail, as he would any other case. He then went to inspect the message that was left him him against the wall.
John was out cold, suffering from a broken nose, concussion and a fractured cheek bone. Not only that, the doctors surrounding him had to use a small incision around the left eye to extract some of the build up of fluid, but John's face was still very swollen. Blood tests were done and it was all but a waiting game. Mycroft was furious to say the least. His younger brother was just out of surgery, drifting in and out of consciousness always asking for John and Rosie. His brother has become too sentimental, and people are realising. Not only that, but Mrs Hudson had refused to be discharged without 'her boys'. 'Her boys' indeed! The day was not going well, and Mycroft was foaming at the mouth with anger. But he still looked calm, resting against his umbrella, standing watch outside his brother's room. You would only be able to see the anger in his eyes if you were close enough, but no one would ever get close enough.
Just as he went to sip his tea, the door bell went. John stiffened. It was so early in the morning, he wouldn't think a client would come at this time, especially with the brutal cold wind howling. But then again, cases never wait for anyone really. john had placed his cup against the small table by his chair, just as Sherlock exited his bedroom, hair in all directions and rubbing sleep from his eyes, "tell them to piss off!" Sherlock had called after John when he went to get the door before Mrs Hudson woke.
"I'm sorry Sherlock." John sighed, and pulled away gently, staring back at Sherlock. "I was not really expecting this."
“Of course I do you prick. You're my best friend, my only friend. You saved me when I was half dead. You showed me what I was missing and brought me back from the brink. You're amazing and wonderful and I love you.”
“What of it?” Mike replied. John felt rough hands against his back, cleaning and covering with gauze, but no stitching.
It was a very long and busy morning for the boys of Baker Street. Not only did Sherlock have to adapt to John and his hidden sentiment, but they now had to arrange themselves around a small little bundle of tears. Because that's all she seemed to do, other than sleep, was to cry her frustrations out on the world. He watched as John struggled to come to terms with the new addition to their lives. Their lives? Surly it would be John's life? And not for the first time that morning, Sherlock's heart had frozen in terror.
It had been almost five hours, thirty seven minuets and twenty nine seconds. Not that Sherlock was counting anyway. He was sat up in his hospital bed, holding on to a sleeping Rosie and watching her facial expressions as she dreamed. A blank slate, just ready to be written on with everything that makes her, her. And her father was not around right now to see the little twitches she makes as she snores lightly. The curl of the fingers as she dreams. He would never in his lifetime understand it.
There had been no word from Moriarty, nor from John's kidnappers. Everything was silent and Sherlock hated it. He needed to get out of this hospital bed and he needed to find John, then find Jim. In that order, despite what the stubborn git had said.
“Tell me again how you came to this conclusion.” Sherlock demanded gently, not turning to look at John. He heard the smaller man move from his chair and come to stand beside him.
John wasn't quite sure when he became so comfortable with being so close to Sherlock, or even when he became aware of his own feelings for Sherlock. Maybe it was after loosing him, and then getting him back that made him realise, or maybe it was having a daughter, but whatever it was, he was sure of one thing. He felt something for Sherlock Holmes, something more than friendship. Something more than brotherhood. But he could not define it. It was more than love, more than a crush, it was just something more.
“We find Jim, and we stop him.” Sherlock whispered, the promise in his voice. “We'll stop him before he can rebuild.” Sherlock moved back to John's bed, sitting down on the edge once again. “After everything I had done in order to destroy what he had built, something tells me he's out for revenge. He'll make a mistake and we'll catch him, along with his second in command.”
Leaving the room was easy, he refused to look at Sherlock, he couldn't see the pain in his friends eyes. He refused. But then Sherlock had to bloody ask.
“It appears she may have had a mild sedative, but to know for sure I need to get the samples assessed. But other than that, she's perfectly healthy. Am I right in assuming she's a premature baby?” He asked as he stepped away to allow John to stand back at her side.
“Put. Her. Down.” John growled. Jim laughed and Moran didn't move. So John aimed the gun and Jim and fired without looking. The hiss Jim gave and the flinch of Moran, John knew he reached his mark Grazing him just as he was meant to. “I said. Put. Her. Down. Or the next one goes between his eyes.” The silence was thick in the air, suddenly broken by distant sirens and Jim's moaning of pain.
Mycroft nodded once and left the property. Sherlock saw John relax a little more and returned to his chair. Sherlock followed, sitting in his own as if on auto pilot.
It was just any old Tuesday for John. He'd gotten up around 5am and was ready to start his day. He was not normally up this early, but then again, he would defiantly not fall back to sleep. Not after last night's (This morning's?) nightmare. So instead he had gotten up, trotted down the stairs and headed straight for the kitchen. The flat was dark, almost hitting winter and Christmas not too far away so there was no early morning light, no birds, just the whistling of the wind as it battered against the windows.
John stared hard at Mycroft, holding Rosie a little closer, protecting her as much as he could. Sherlock knew he was avoiding him just now but they will have the rest of the day to talk if they need to.
“Sherlock!” John went to move, but again he was stopped. He felt torn. “I swear to you Jim, to you both. I will kill you.” John growled and the he moved. He grabbed the agent's wrist, twisted the gun from his grasp and used him as a human shield against Agent Number Two as he fired. With his shield, he shot a head shot to agent number two and pushed the other away from him. He raised his gun to Sebastian Moran, a fire in his eyes.
"Was any of us?" Sherlock laughed softly and moved towards the kitchen. He reached for two mugs and set the kettle to boil. "You know, there are a lot of experiments to conduct now we have a child in the house. Just think of all the fun .."
I must point out that there is some small mentions of child abuse in this chapter. Very small, but it's there so I've updated the tags as well.
Sherlock refused to look at John, instead he chose to watch Rosie intently as he lay her in his arm, using his now free hand to feed her the bottle. He watched her and he watched her, silently promising never to let anyone or anything hurt her. Ever.
Doctor Harrison made his way to Rosie, checking her breathing, taking her temperature. At one point, he took a blood sample, which made John stiffen and inch closer, but still Rosie didn't stir. John was panicking, trying to keep calm, his leg began to ache and his left hand began to shake. It wasn't right! Doctor Harrison had checked all vitals and checked Rosie's eye reactions as she slept and he frowned.
“Watch it.” John snapped, trying to get as comfortable as he could, but it was impossible. “Can you at least remove the bloody cuffs?” Again, there was no answer.
“Sherlock,” Lestrade started and made his way over. A hand ran through his silver hair and he heaved a sigh. “We've got nothing. Even with Mycroft's resources, we can't find him.”
John was left to crumble on the floor after the whip had struck his back no less than ten times. His screams had whittled down to small grunts after the third strike, not wanting to give this man any sick pleasure. He felt the blood sticking and drying to his back as his body lay against the cold floor, shivering and trembling. He saw the feet come back into view and heard the rasping of breath, but John refused to look into the man's eyes. He will not give him the pleasure of seeing him in such pain, because it fucking hurt!
Thank you to all reading this, and I apologies for taking so long to update. Real life is a bitch sometimes.
Mycroft nodded, and Anthea disconnected an arm from him but stayed close as she got her mobile and her fingers flew across the keys. “Follow me Doctor Watson.” She looked up, warmth in her eyes for a second, then turned to Mycroft, squeezed his arm gently and led John down the corridor, to a private room. “Doctor Harrison will be by shortly, he's Lisa's doctor. I would trust him with my life. And hers.”
“Can you tell me of your whereabouts Tuesday evening?” Donovan asked as her reply, not looking at John, but looking through the folders in her hands.
Sherlock growled loudly and felt like throwing his phone out of the window. So Lestrade didn't even now!? What the hell was going on.
“You're wanting to run a check on any close family members? You think they're seeking revenge?” Sherlock asked and Lestrade shrugged.
“Erm, yes. Yes of course. Well, she was taken. John tried to protect but he was hit with some drug or other, his face .. Oh Sherlock. He's currently being treated but he won't wake up. They're not sure what he's been drugged with. Mycroft has ordered bloods to be analysed but we have nothing back yet.” Mrs Hudson finished, just as the door opened and Mycroft walked in.
The unknown man carefully disconnected the wires from the sleeping child and picked her up, grinning as he took his prize and fled the hospital. No one stopped him, no one noticed him and John was not found for another hour, when the nurse had came back to check on Rosie's stats.
“What is it?” John asked carefully, waiting for the signal. But John noticed Sherlock wasn't staring at him, but glaring at the glass, his hand gripping the phone in a death grip. John reached for Sherlock's wrist gently, the one holding the phone, Sherlock didn't budge, instead released the phone to John. Now Sherlock stared at John as he read the message and felt his own anger flare. But on top of it all was a great and powerful fear. Nothing that he had ever felt before, and it almost brought him to his knees. It would have done if Sherlock hadn't grabbed a hold of him in time.
“How?” came the voice and again, John answered without wanting to. He has lost all control of his voice.
“Oh Sherlock.” She whispered. Shaking her head. He was about to move, but a jolt of pain stopped him and Mrs Hudson instantly reached a hand out to hold his own, gripping it tightly. He could feel her hand shake and he dreaded what would come out of her mouth next. “I've heard little news at the moment,” she began, knowing Sherlock would detest any break or crying or snivelling. She kept to the facts as she knew them, keeping her face open and honest so Sherlock could read what he could, even in his dazed state. “But he came in with us, but with you in surgery and myself being treated, mild concussion you know, he got Rosie checked out by someone who Mycroft would trust with Anthea's niece. Such a sweet girl that she is. Rosie appeared to have been given a sedative. Nothing too dangerous for her age, she just needed to sleep it off and she's be fine. Will be fine. But ..” Mrs Hudson froze then, using a free hand to wipe a stray tear.
Sherlock ignored John's pottering about in order to glare at his brother, "Stop spying on me!" He hissed, keeping his voice down. He knew that if the child was not in the living room in close view then she must be resting someplace else. John's room most likely, after all the man was her father, and he did have a new monitor clasped to his belt as he drifted between the two brothers.
“Now wait a second!” John hissed, his entire body going stiff, but he ensured he kept his voice down, he didn't want to wake Rosie. “Colonel Sebastian Moran. Discharged from the army on the grounds of him being a bastard, firing against his own people to prevent them from cracking down on the gun trade in Afghanistan. The 20 a day smoker who is a crack shot with a sniper rifle. The bastard that sent me home with a bullet in the shoulder that could've killed me because he didn't want to get court marshalled due to selling illegal weapons to children in Afghanistan. The bastard that walked free because none of this could be proven. That Colonel Sebastian Moran!”
