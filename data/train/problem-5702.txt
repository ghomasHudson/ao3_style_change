“Bruce! Cap!” Rhodey motioned for them to come over. Once they were near, he asked, “Is it just me, or has Tony been avoiding all of us?”
Their relationship had taken a turn since it began two months before, and even a month from now. Fortunately, and as predicted, it was a turn for the better.
There was no getting out of the conversation, and Steve knew that. So, he told Tony everything about the loop and what happened the Thursday before. Except about the ‘I love you’ part.
Steve watched me with curiosity and, yes, amusement. “It’s just a burger. Normally I would get one like yours. Well, probably two of them. I wanted to try something new though.” He brought the burger up and opened his mouth to take a bite.
“Tony.” Steve’s voice was tender. It almost sounded relieved, but Tony couldn’t be too sure. After all, he didn’t know Steve as much as he thought. Especially not this Steve.
Tony sighed as Steve set his plate down on the countertop. “At least I was able to enjoy some of my coffee before we got company.”
Tony rinsed out his mouth before he trudged his way back to the bedroom, Steve following close behind. “I’m thinking eggs and toast for breakfast tomorrow. What do you think?” Tony questioned as he pulled on a pair of boxers.
I’ve gone longer than this when tired, but in those moments, I was moving around and working. But now I was just sitting still and driving in the quiet with the exception of the radio.
Steve stared at me for a moment before he picked up the menu as well. “It’s very different seeing you out of a formal suit or the Iron Man suit,” He mused after a moment, startling me from the quiet that was between us.
“Where else are we going to do it?” Tony snapped then punched a guy before he could get to Steve. “You didn’t tell me when not here, so should I really expect any differently?”
The other Avengers were beginning to get skeptical of Tony. He was being different and ditching the team randomly without any explanation. Who else could he be spending his time with?
Fury slid the file over to their end of the table. “Weapons. More precisely, it’s alien weapons. We found the dealers hideout and we need the two of you to take them down. We need at least one alive.”
Tony stared hard at Steve. “I’m guessing you didn’t tell J either. Or he wouldn’t have woken me up from my beautiful slumber to tell me Captain America was sneaking out of the building.”
Steve went straight to the gym after and let out all of his anger and frustration. He was angry at himself for waiting for so long, for not thinking Tony would follow, and for letting Tony get killed. He went through the mass of punching bags before he just started to destroy the equipment simply out of anger.
“Tones,” Steve breathed out softly before he closed the space between them. “Stop worrying about me, just for a day,” He murmured before he gently grabbed hold of Tony’s chin.
“First, I want to give a huge thank you to Tony for throwing this party not only for me, but also for all of you to enjoy,” Steve paused and smiled as he let the crowd die down again. “I was told tonight was going to be like any other PR event, but it seems far from it,” He joked lightly and chuckled.
Steve looked at himself in the mirror in his bathroom. He was suited up with the cowl off. His physique was as normal as ever, but his eyes held all of his exhaustion. “JARVIS, don’t let anyone know I’m leaving. Especially Tony.”
“Smoothies?” Sam gave Steve another weird look as he stood with the help. “Smoothie day is tomorrow – Friday. Today’s Thursday.”
It was a nice party, and Steve was enjoying himself. He was smiling and laughing with some of the guests he got to know before Tony finally made his way over.
“If I was— Jesus, Steve.” Tony huffed out in annoyance. At that moment the suit opened up and Tony stepped out of it.
He stood like that for a while, just staring out at the horizon. He could just let himself melt away in the water. Steve closed his eyes then leaned back until he was floating on the water. He could easily drift away, but then again, Tony would see. Then he would help and ask all these questions that Steve would be too ashamed to answer.
“I don’t even want to know the word, or words, you would use for that.” There was a moment of silence as the two just looked at each other with smiles before Steve forced himself to look away.
“Tell me what you can then,” Steve suggested. The conversation paused for a moment as their food was set down before Tony settled with his food.
Tony cocked an eyebrow up. “Why do you think that is?” He inquired with his grin only getting bigger.
Steve ate his breakfast as he thought of what else he could do instead of the mission or act awkward around Tony when trying not to be affectionate. Whatever it was he did, it couldn’t be anything in the tower.
Tony’s fingers twitched above Steve’s forearm, and his mouth opened and closed like a fish. “What…What do you mean?” His hand moved away a bit as the shock creeped into Tony’s words and expression.
Steve let the wind whip through his short hair as he drove away from the city and, more importantly, the tower. He didn’t know where he was going exactly, he just knew he had to be away. It seemed getting out of New York would suit that need.
“Whoa, slow down there, Cap,” Tony laughed faintly as he rested his hands on the sides of Steve’s arms. “As much as I like seeing a corrupt version of you – that cussing and everything – you need to take a deep breath. Right now isn’t the time to freak.”
“You look…really good,” Steve commented with his oh-so-tender voice. It had been an awkward couple minutes while Tony processed what was actually going on.
By the time Steve arrived at the door to Tony’s suite, he still hadn’t thought of anything to do past breakfast. Despite that, Steve still knocked on Tony’s door. He even waited up, so it wouldn’t be so early for Tony.
“It at least smells like good food,” Steve offered as he slid into the booth, his eyes scanning around cautiously. Probably at how unkept this place looked.
Steve collapsed on his bed once he spent plenty of time in the shower after what just conspired up in Tony’s suite. He rolled onto his stomach and folded his arms under his pillow. Tomorrow is another day. He could put the whole dream behind him.
Okay, so what? They didn’t hold out on their word and kept being each other’s booty call. But it was nice, and they were both enjoying it. As long as neither of them were catching feelings, it was smooth sailing.
Tony was almost done by the time Steve finished all four burgers and had went back to sipping at his beer with one leg crossed over his lap. Tony’s eyes lingered before he finished off his burger. “Movie?” He asked with a mouthful as he motioned towards the tv.
Tony let his thumb hover over the faded green call button. Jesus, where did Steve find this thing? He shook his head again, trying to get his hazy mind to focus.
There didn’t seem to be any joking tone to what Tony said. And as much as Steve wanted to say yes and jump Tony right then and there with his shirt off, Steve couldn’t.
Tony’s eyes rolled but the smile was still on his face. “It’ll heal, if that’s what you’re asking for. Just stings like a motherfucker.”
“Oh, no need to remind me,” Tony chuckled as the two made their way towards the garage. “I see the bill for the groceries, and I see how it skyrocketed since you moved into the tower.”
Steve pulled away from Tony, shocked by his own words. It was too soon. Too sudden for Tony who knew nothing of their history. Steve ran a hand through his hair and glanced around at the crowd now around them. “We should get back, don’t you think?”
Tony sat on the couch with Steve and watched him with apprehension. “Talk to me, Cap. I know it’s more than some bad dream.”
“It’s none of your concern,” Steve tried to keep his voice and expression void of any tell emotions. “It’s…a PR event. I scheduled it myself.” He stared at Tony, waiting for him to move.
Tony was under him, squirming and moaning and grunting, and Steve had his slicked hands on Tony’s bare skin. Steve kept his hands moving, but he thought back to the mission earlier.
Steve turned the stove off just as the elevator doors opened, and he was a little surprised to see Natasha tagging along with Rhodey.
“Did you find the Advil I set out for you?” Steve asked then moved to sit up as he set the icepack aside.
I would really appreciate the kudos and the comments for this :) it's my first work and I'm really proud of it.
Steve shook his head with a light smile as he wrapped his arms around Tony and leaned back against the back of the tub. “No, Tones. You made this ungodly mess, so we will clean it up together,” He stated firmly.
Tony glared tiredly at Steve’s figure before he turned his attention to the tv, and the glare was wiped off his face. “
Today was going to be different. He was sure of it. Instead of trying to accomplish the mission differently with Tony, Steve was going to do it alone. It was a change, and Tony wouldn’t get hurt this way.
“Tony, please,” Steve just about begged before he rubbed a hand over the bottom half of his face. “This is something I have to handle myself. You’re not going to change my mind.”
“Tony!” Steve grinned and laid his arm over Tony’s shoulders. “Wow, you’re short,” He chuckled and poked Tony with one of his fingers.
As many nights like this before, Steve and Tony ended up together in Tony’s bed, but compared to the first time, neither of them was drunk.
“I don’t know, Steve,” I sigh, glancing up as the waiter brought our coffees and I give him a small thanks. “I don’t let people drive me around unless it’s Happy, and that isn’t often.” I was hesitant on letting people drive me ever since my parents got in that car crash all those years ago.
He was relieved though that Tony got himself to bed last night, and it made it easier for Steve to relax himself as he went on his run.
Steve wanted to argue. He wanted to bash Loki’s head against the wall and to do his worst. To hell with his reputation. He was
I couldn’t help but laugh. Not at him, just as what he said. “No, but you got close. It’s called ‘Back to the Future.’ And yes, like that movie,” I correct for him, grinning over to Steve.
I roll my eyes. “Yes, Steve. I know they had cars in the forties. Not the best ones, but they did the job.” I tap my fingers against the door’s arm rest then decides to put on my seat belt.
I crawl into my bed with a heavy sigh, curling up and closing my eyes. “I’m hoping for Steve and me to get along for once,” I murmur to myself. Hearing it helps me want it more, and I want this. Us not getting along is getting old.
I look at the clock before I take a look outside, and was I seeing this right? “Burger King?” I turn my head to Steve and raises an eyebrow. “Why here?”
Steve rolled his eyes in response. “Is that how you put it? Because back in the day it was called poking fun at someone.”
Tony leaned his hip against the counter and watched appreciatively as Steve undressed, who in return glanced over with an eyebrow raised.
“Are you talking about me wearing sweatpants?” I raise an eyebrow to him, putting my menu down. I knew what I wanted anyways.
“You goddamn idiot,” Steve strained as he cupped Tony’s cheek. “I tried-tried to keep you away. Because of this.”
Tony pulled the whiskey bottle to his lips, his back against the bar in his suite. It was late, way later than he should be up. He honestly couldn’t say what the time was.
Natasha crossed her arms and stayed standing as Rhodey took a seat next to Tony. “How long has this been going on?” She asked as the two accused were eating their breakfast in the tension.
.” He let go of the mug to rub his hands over his face again. “I’ve had some bad break ups before, but that takes the cake.”
Steve’s smile tugged a little wider as he watched Tony before he turned around, pouring Tony a cup of his own coffee. “J told me you actually went to bed last night,” Steve mused as he turned around and handed Tony the mug filled with steaming coffee.
“I don’t, but it’s alright. I’m not tired and I don’t have anything better to do this late,” He said as an attempt to reassure Steve.
“I’m certainly not complaining,” Tony responded with a wink and a smirk paired together. This time Steve blushed, like always, but it accompanied with a sweet smile. Even though Tony didn’t remember the history they had together, Steve did. And the little flirts and compliments warmed Steve up to his core – more than coffee ever could.
“You really like to live on the wild side, huh?” Came Tony’s voice suddenly. Steve nearly jumped off the tower right then and there from how much he startled.
He simply shook his head with a small smile. “Yes, I’ve read up on that,” He dismissed before he realized exactly what he said.
“Well, I mean…” Steve shrugged as his cheeks began to turn a faint pink. “I looked up Howard. Because Fury told me I’d be working with you for the Avengers initiative. Then I had to see who I was going to be fighting alongside of.”
They were waiting for the burgers to arrive as they sat on Tony’s couch. Steve lightly swirled the inside of the bottle as he thought about the day. How could a dream so accurately depict the future? Especially when it’s never happened before.
“Are you any good?” Tony asked as he leaned back when the waitress brought their drinks over – a coffee each.
Except for Thor, who stayed on Asgard to try to search there incase the incident was recent, and Loki didn’t have time to escape yet.
They walked into the diner and sat in a booth near the back to not draw so much attention. They ordered right when the waitress came to the table, both being almost starved hungry. Steve just needs to eat a lot more consistently than normal people, and Tony most likely hadn’t eaten anything in a while.
“Being your best friend gave me the right,” Rhodey replied and he shook his head in disappointment. I don’t blame him. “And you know I don’t believe you when you say that.”
“What am I going to do with you?” Tony exasperated with a laugh. “You lose that thing all too often for it to be a damn mistake.” He shook his head, almost affectionately – almost – before he stepped away from Steve. “And to answer your question, yes. Natasha and Clint went on a mission with Bruce for backup. So, you are stuck with me in this tower.”
Tony’s eyebrows raised in surprise. “Was that the only time we’ve done that?” He asked curiously, his lips quirking up in smirk.
“Now that you see I wasn’t kidding, what does this mean for us? You—We didn’t want the others to know and now, well, the whole world knows,” Steve huffed out before he rubbed a hand over his face.
“Promise me that you won’t give up.” Tony looked straight into Steve’s eyes. “If I know anything – and damn do I know a lot – one thing is for sure, you can defeat whatever this is.”
Steve didn’t respond at first. It was true. He would be acting the same if the roles were switched. “You know, that would be a valid argument if you were here right now,” He spoke finally, testing to see if Tony was really here or if it was just the suit.
Steve couldn’t help but to laugh at the shorter man. “It’s just…different. Partying used to be different, and so did—well, everything, really.”
“But—” Steve sighed before he unbuckled his seatbelt. There was no use arguing it. They were there already and sitting in Tony’s parked car. “I do appreciate this, Tones. It’s thoughtful, but not necessary.”
Loki was back to holding his nose, a pissed-off look on his face that turned into a sinister smirk as his gaze redirected to Steve. “Why don’t you ask your friend Steven here, huh? Why don’t you tell them about all those days you broke down—”
That couldn’t happen. Steve wouldn’t let himself be in the way. Maybe it wouldn’t be such a good idea for them to go out after all. They led such busy lives – for Tony he also had a company to run at the same time.
“Steve.” Tony was going fast, and he knew it. He could feel the energy draining out of him as he clung onto Steve.
“Seriously. You expect me not to be worried about the person who always sticks to the same schedule unless a mission is called, who then throws that out the window and runs away?” Tony stood up, metal creaking a little under movement. “When I woke up this morning, Jarvis told me that you told him to let me know you went out for a ride and there was no destination. I’m not supposed to worry about that?”
“I thought you were smart enough to realize that without having me need to explain it again,” Fury chuckled. “You both will leave in a week. If you have any other questions, don’t ask. They’ll be answered when you get your debriefing folders just like Steve will get his.” Fury stood up. “I suggest you and Steve talk about your…arrangements before then.”
Tony understood and took both their mugs to the kitchen for some coffee with a little kick. He handed Steve his mug back once he made his way into the living room again. Steve thanked him in a murmur before he downed a few sips to feel the burn. It helped him remember that this was real. It had to be.
“Yeah? Well that doesn’t matter now, does it? Either way, this was kept from us and we want to know what the hell is going on,” Rhodey defended with a light glare.
“I did,” Tony answered in a sigh as he made his way over to the barstools. “But then I turned it back on, so I can know what they’re saying about us. I haven’t heard anything homophobic so far, but I know it’s coming. It’ll probably be all over Twitter.”
“You always think of everything,” Steve spoke with fondness before he pulled Tony into another heated kiss as they together stumbled across the floor to the couch.
They got out the car together and made their way over to the building. As they walked, Steve tugged on his cowl and secured it. “Now would be a good time to suit up.”
Tony glanced between them, knowing it wasn’t his place to initiate any fighting. He also didn’t connect the dots yet.
Thor didn’t pry Steve about what Loki had said, waiting until they debriefed Fury about everything. Tony, surprisingly, kept his mouth shut. He was, well, heartbroken. He couldn’t find words.
Steve started with a walk before he lightly jogged down the sidewalk to where he runs in the morning. Once there he took a sip of his water to hydrate himself before he took off in a full run around Central Park.
do anything,” Steve explained once the attention was on him. It was true – Steve felt like he always had to keep himself occupied once he woke up, as if he couldn’t waste any more time.
“Perfect.” Steve smiled to himself before he walked in, closing the door behind himself. He didn’t bother glancing around in what would be curiosity. He’s been in there enough to know where everything is and what objects are lying around.
For the first time since he got stuck in the loop, Steve fell asleep peacefully. He knew tomorrow would bring him another identical Thursday, but at that moment Steve wasn’t concerned anymore. He knew that through it all, he’d have Tony. Even as the next morning would roll around and Tony wouldn’t be in his arms or remember anything, Steve remembered. That’s what he had to hold on to.
“Sorry to disappoint, Honey Bear. But I can’t tonight.” Tony chuckled before he turned in the chair to face his best friend. “I already have plans.”
I would really appreciate the kudos and the comments for this :) it's my first work and I'm really proud of it.
The car started as Steve settled with his cowl resting on his lap. “It’s a mission. The one we got called for every Thursday. We’re just going early.” Steve shrugged then typed the address onto the screen for Jarvis to give Tony the directions.
Steve sat on the couch and turned to face Tony, one of his arms slung over the back of the couch. Tony was laid down with his head rested on the armrest. “I’m fine, Cap. Stop worrying so much,” Tony waved off before he closed his eyes. “I just need a nap. They said it should heal quick enough with whatever it was they gave me.”
After they soaked for a while in the bubble-ridden water, they decided it was time to get out before they both fell asleep there. It wouldn’t be the first time.
Steve, with his elbows propped on the counter and mug held up in his hands, grinned up to Tony. It was certainly a change from grinning down at Tony. “It was nice. Since it was still early, the heat wasn’t a problem.”
He closed his eyes tightly as he wiped that thought away with his hand over his eyes. “Fucking Steve,” Tony slurred out with a small shake of his head.
The silence was thick between them. Tony didn’t truly know what to say to better this situation at such a suspenseful moment, and he also didn’t want to accidentally say anything to make the situation worse. He had a tendency of doing that.
“That sounds good to me,” Steve chuckled lightly as he leaned his head back. “I want to thank you again for today. It wasn’t what I wanted exactly, but I had a really good time with everyone,” He thanked softly after a couple minutes of them simply enjoying each other’s presence.
Steve let out a breath, glad for the great timing. “Maybe it would be of better comfort for you to have your brother by your side as I punch your face in.” Steve’s voice started as a threat but turned into an angry growl with balled fists at his sides.
Steve let out a heavy breath before he lowered himself down onto the sand. Even if he ever got out of the loop –
Steve set his empty bottle and the rest of the trash in the to-go bag. “A movie?” He questioned unsure before he looked up to Tony. “I don’t know, Tony. I was thinking about cleaning up then crashing.”
I glance to his arms before I force my gaze up to the menu as well. I don’t want Steve to catch me staring, and I definitely don’t want the public to catch me staring. It doesn’t mean anything, and the press would spin it into so much more if they could. Especially since they know I’m into guys.
It isn't very plot heavy. It almost isn't even close. It's more of a filler chapter and one where the reader can get a better understanding of the characters. I hope you enjoy it!
Tony leaned in and kissed Steve again. It was soft, and sweet, and everything Steve wanted. “We should do that one day then. Now that this is over for you. Just me and you again. I used to not be a fan of the beach, but I feel like I’d enjoy it,” Tony promised against Steve’s lips, a smile on Tony’s lips. Steve breathed out and smiled slightly, resting their foreheads together. “I’ll even clear my whole day for you.”
Tony’s hair was messy and sticking up in different places. It was hot, but Steve couldn’t think about another round. “About last night…”
So far, the worst that’s happened to him has been the knife hitting his eye. Steve didn’t know if he could handle seeing worse. It’s like no matter what he did differently during the fight, Tony got injured in some fashion.
“Tony…” Steve sighed again, a deep frown taking place of his usual smile when around Tony. “Look, I’ll sound crazy, but I’ll risk it,” He started off. Even if Tony always believed him about the loop, he knew how insane this was to believe. “I’m in some sort of time loop. I’ve been repeating the same Thursday for
The hairs on the back of his neck stood up and he immediately grabbed his shield from his back. He was in a small hallway, and ahead of him was light coming through an open area that was to the side. Steve faintly heard the repulsors from outside, and it began to make the people that were ahead squirm.
The wind picked up and Steve opened his eyes to look down at the city below him. “Another way,” He mumbled to himself as he thought of pros and cons.
Steve held Tony closer. It didn’t feel real, but at the same time it felt too real. “Tony, I-I…” He swallowed the lump in his throat. What if Tony dying ended the loop? It would be a relief for it to stop, but at the cost of losing everything that kept him grounded? At the cost of losing his Tony? “I love you too.”
“I do. And he didn’t mean it like that, Tony. I know the two of you don’t get along, but you also know he’s not rude like that,” Rhodey answered back firmly. “He meant that the public tends to favor him more. Does that really come as a surprise to you? Or did you just get all butthurt that it was Steve that said it?”
Though, it didn’t come close to being as relaxing as a cup of hot coffee in the morning. Speaking of, I could go for some right now.
“Really?” Steve laughed, his head tilting back slightly. “I haven’t gotten the chance to see him yet.”
Steve glanced over to Tony in annoyance before he jumped and kicked another guy. “It’s complicated, Tony. Drop it.”
He pulled on his running clothes again, stretched in the kitchen, then walked out his apartment. Steve thought back to the night before how Tony actually slept. “JARVIS, is Tony in his suite again?” He questioned around the time he reached the stairs at the end of the hall.
He didn’t stop until they were either unconscious or dead. He wanted to kill all of them, but he had to think of Tony.
Steve held himself taller and pushed the fear down his throat as he heard Tony’s swearing get closer to the door. It was ripped open to reveal a tired and pissed off Tony with sweats and a shirt that was messed up from sleeping in it.
“That will make it harder to understand,” Tony nodded a bit to himself before he stood up. “I’m going to need something strong in my coffee if I’m going to get through this so early.”
That’s what it took for Steve to finally help me. He just gave me this completely done with look before he walked over to my suitcase.
I would really appreciate the kudos and the comments for this :) it's my first work and I'm really proud of it.
Steve looked at me with worry as he put his hand on my shoulder. “Tony, nothing happened. I just parked the car is all,” He explained with a gentle voice, probably so he wouldn’t spook me more than I seem to be.
Tony nodded slowly as he took in Steve’s advice, shoveling another bite into his mouth and ruining what would be considered a nice moment. Though it was Tony, and it was a Tony thing to do. Which made Steve love the moment even more.
It was risky, and felt like a death wish, to even consider calling Steve. It wasn’t an emergency, but it had been almost two years since he’s heard Steve’s voice, and it was getting hard to withstand.
Fury debriefed Steve personally. Even as Fury was rather skeptical of how everything happened, he wasn’t going to admit aloud that he was scared to further piss off the dark side of Captain America.
There was a grunt and Steve immediately turned to Tony as he remembered suddenly about how Tony had gotten injured in the dream.
Fury stood as the two entered the conference room, and he sized them up. “You’re looking a little angry, Cap. You two didn’t get in a fight, right?” He quirked a brow at them. “Because I need you both on the same page for this.”
“I don’t even need syrup with these,” I muse as I cut up the waffle. “The chocolate chips melted so much that they’re basically acting as the syrup.”
The guy attempted to dart around Steve, but he quickly slapped the guy back with his shield. The dealer landed stuck in the nearest wall. If it were possible, stars would be dancing around his head.
“Right…” Rhodey finally spoke as an awkwardness settled between the three. “I’m going to find Pepper.”
The metal broke under Steve’s force and the door opened. “I’m in,” Steve informed Tony as he moved stealthily through the building. He heard voices and headed straight for them, his footsteps light.
“I’m sure,” Steve confirmed as he stepped out the car, this time with more grace than he had when he got into the car. “I heard good things about it over the internet.”
It wasn’t like Steve hadn’t been completely oblivious. He knew of Tony’s flirts, but Steve brushed them off by excusing it as casual or because the flirts didn’t hold anything but sexual undertones to them. Now, though, Steve was beginning to think otherwise.
Steve drank his black, but Tony added some creamer and sugar into his coffee. “Bucky and Ma used to say I was good at it, and that I could get somewhere with my drawings,” He smiled faintly as he thought of those two people. “I bet they never thought I’d get somewhere with a tall, muscular body.”
Steve couldn’t help the fond smile that broke across his face. It was slight, but if someone looked they could see it.
Back at the quinjet, Steve sat anxiously. All his muscles were tensed from being on edge. He couldn’t wait to go to sleep and wake up from whatever day this was.
Even if it wasn’t like Steve, he would gladly ring Loki’s neck for what he’s put Steve through. It was madness. Steve had officially been in the loop for 150 days – approximately 5 months of Loki’s torture.
“I’m not just…making this up. Okay? This one time I tried to go on the mission alone, because no matter what you seemed to get hurt during it. Whether it was small or something major. But you followed me and barged in, and one of their weapons killed you. You had—” Steve’s voice tightened as he remembered the events that happened months ago for him. “You died in my arms. And your last words were you telling me you loved me…” He risked a glance in Tony’s direction. “The Thursday following—God, you don’t understand how relieved I was that the loop wasn’t over at that—”
“It certainly sounds better than being alone right now,” Steve replied in a soft breath, moving to grab Tony’s hand in his. Steve had to remind himself that Tony was his anchor, his grip for control. As long as Tony was around, Steve should be okay.
“Had a bad dream last night?” Tony asked in a gruff, tired voice as he trudged into the kitchen. Wearing the same pajamas he had in the dream. With the same messy hair.
Steve chuckled, and it sounded relieved. “I can assume the rest of your night will be bitching about the pain to Dum-E as you work away instead of rest?” He gave Tony a knowing look, a slight smirk on Steve’s lips.
Tony, with the soft spot he has for Steve, would oblige. He would still ask questions of course. But he wouldn’t push. Especially when the moral and righteous Captain America had an exhausted yet still murderous look in his blue eyes.
“Has anybody told you how great you are?” I tell him relieved before I get in position to zip it. Okay, maybe I was being dramatic again, but who cares? My suitcase was about to finally be closed.
“So,” Tony spoke as he pulled the mug away, his eyes piercing into Steve’s eyes with a faint twinkle as he woke up more. “How was that run of yours? Or should I say that goddamn marathon you torture yourself with.”
Steve braced his hands on either side of the punching bag as he listened, soft pants coming from his mouth. He was sweaty and knew that it would be uncomfortable in his suit, so he headed for the locker room as the punching bag swayed lonely behind him.
“We can’t just do this?” Steve asked as he watched Tony with admiration. “I feel pretty content here. More than I have in a while, Tony.”
Steve dismissed the idea of cards when Tony introduced the idea, and instead stuck to keeping the money he needed for the day in a money clip secure in his own pockets. Tony called Steve old fashioned for it, but then again, he is old fashioned. He’s old. And fashioned.
Sam shot Steve a glare, but the tugs of a smile on his lips overcame the heated look. This, without a doubt, carried on until they both stopped by a tree. Sam was holding his side as he sat at the base of the trunk, yet Steve stood above with just small little pants coming from him.
Tony stopped working abruptly and looked up. “Well, just tell me who it is.” His brows furrowed together. Even when someone requests to remain unknown, FRIDAY never listens.
He stared down at his phone dumbfounded. It felt so certain that yesterday had been Thursday. He even had the ache in the morning from the day.
Tony’s eyes stayed on Steve, not even noticing the crowd around them. “Yeah, of course.” He pursed his lips before he turned around and started walking back towards the diner where the car was.
Steve shook his head and rested his hands on Tony’s waist, though didn’t go any farther. The last step was going to be Tony’s decision. “I’m fine. I just—” Steve glanced down more to Tony’s lips. “I need to feel you…”
As Steve walked off, Tony stared in worry. He wanted more than anything to talk with Steve and figure out what was going on, but he knew it wasn’t time yet.
When the party was over, and everyone made it back to the tower, Steve made sure all the other Avengers had gone to their quarters before he snuck himself up to Tony’s suite. With Tony’s prior orders, Jarvis let Steve in without hesitation.
“You’ll let me take you up then?” Steve rested his hands on Tony’s hips, his lustful eyes roaming over the tank top wearing Tony.
Steve snaked his arms around Tony’s waist and pulled Tony into his lap. Once again Tony was in Steve’s arms, but for a reason that was ten times better.
When I see a good enough gas station, I put on my blinker before I turn into its driveway, parking the car at one of the pumps. “If you’re still in there when it gets done, I’ll pull into a parking spot,” I say as I grab my wallet.
It’s more important for me to not think about it when Steve and I are on a mission together. I had to focus. Those thoughts – or him – can’t distract me.
Tony held his hands up. “I had to take the attention off myself,” He defended. “Plus, they don’t have anything to go on. Rhodey doesn’t suspect anything between us.”
With one hand braced on the edge of either door, Tony pushed them open simultaneously. It sounded like Bruce had been pacing and decidedly stopped once the doors opened. Except, it wasn’t Bruce.
Steve bounced his leg as he thought. “Well, Clint is with his family, so he’s vacationing in a way,” He began to list off on his fingers.
Tony leaned his hip against the counter as he watched Steve walk off, a bit worried about Steve but not wanting to show it.
“Sorry,” Steve chuckled before he took a deep breath. He put his face in Tony’s hair and breathed in the sweet smell of Tony’s shampoo. “I guess I just went with the flow.”
Steve rubbed the back of his neck before he grabbed a bottle of lotion nearby. “I don’t know how much to press down. I haven’t really given a massage since the serum.” He bit down on his lip before he moved to sit on Tony’s thighs, straddling him.
“The good thing about it is that I can eat a lot of different good foods in one sitting. The down side though is how it’s hard for me to feel full and easier for me to feel hungry,” He chuckled slightly before he moved on to his second burger. “Especially if I don’t have enough money on me at the time being.”
Steve just sat back as he opened his third burger, knowing it was useless at this point to convince Tony of otherwise. JARVIS sent the email through. “You really didn’t have to do that, Tony,” He said sheepishly. “I know you’re a very secure person and you seriously don’t have to connect me with one of your accounts.”
The sound of a broken nose first hit Steve’s ears before the pained groan accompanied by it. Now all two of them were aware of his presence – wait, two? Steve quickly spun around and sure enough the other two went around the place and trapped Steve where he was.
I put away my card and wallet before I wrangle up all the bags into my arms again. “Thank you, young man. We’ll let you get back to your…
So, when Fury knocked on my office door and told me I had to go undercover with Steve on a mission – well, one could imagine my dismay.
Steve tossed off his hand wraps before he made his way to the garage to meet Tony. He had grabbed a towel on his way out, so he could wipe himself down. He felt sweatier than yesterday – the dream.
Once all my stuff was on the suitcase, I set it aside against my wall. I couldn’t’ close it yet because I still had to put my toothbrush and stuff in there in the morning, so that would do for now. Plus, I may have to get help closing it tomorrow. I might pull a muscle trying to get it zipped closed with how packed it is.
Tony sighed heavily and relaxed more into Steve’s side as the other thought. “I mean,” He licked his lips. “Loki is right under our
Steve came over to the table after a couple minutes, sliding into the booth as he set our tray on the table. “I didn’t know which lemonade you wanted so I just got regular to be safe,” He told me before his eyes widened. “Did you know they have just about every flavor of soda in that machine? It’s incredible.”
“You just walked out on Steve and came here, huh? You didn’t even give him a chance to explain himself,” Rhodey scolded.
Tony looked more surprised at that, but it was a pleasant sort of surprise. “You’re in luck then. I know of almost every diner around here. Just let me get ready first.” He smiled warmly before he turned and walked off, leaving the door open. “Make yourself a home. I shouldn’t be too long,” Tony called over his shoulder before disappearing in his bathroom.
Steve had this almost sad and wistful smile on his face. “It’s that obvious?” He let the spring breeze wash over himself before he faced Tony. “It used to not be, because people just didn’t think about it. Then he died, and I became America’s hero, and it was all erased. They didn’t erase Peggy though.”
The waiter set it down on the table with my credit card, and he still looked in shock. He ran his hand through his hair almost nervously. “Thank you. I-I… Just thank you. That’s incredibly generous, Mr. Iron Man sir,” He finished awkwardly.
I push open the door to the gym a little harder than necessary, and I storm over to where Steve was currently bench pressing who knows how many pounds. It looked like the weights could easily crush my Iron Man suit, but it seemed like Steve was handling them as if they were pool noodles.
The two didn’t care in the heat of the moment. Tony had been stealing looks of Steve ever since they met, and Steve hadn’t been with anyone in 80 years. Plus, Steve couldn’t deny his interest in Tony.
Steve has spoken in front of crowds before, but that didn’t mean it was his favorite thing. After guests from the crowd started to pat his back, he gave in and met Tony up on the table.
“Now to what I asked: you’d answer her but not me? And don’t give me the bullshit that you were worried about her because I’m over here worried about you.” Tony rambled angrily before he huffed out, taking a moment to collect himself. “Steve, this isn’t like you.” His voice was softer now, and it definitely showed how concerned he truly was – more concerned than angry.
“Come on, Cap! You slept for 70 years. Just one movie?” Tony gave Steve puppy dog eyes and damnit – Steve couldn’t resist that.
He forced himself to step away from the ninth punching bag he was pounding on. What the fuck was he thinking? How could he possibly find Loki? Maybe if he had more time, and Loki didn’t constantly try to make Steve lose track of his process – or Tony’s process – then he’d be able to find Loki.
Steve let out a breathy laugh. “The only difference between it though is that I actually like you, and Howard was just a friend to me.”
Steve was radiating pure anger, and the fact that Steve was acting so calm at the same time was blood-curdling. Tony met up at Steve’s side, his suit on but his faceplate open.
Tony closed his eyes and let out a sharp breath. “Can I at least have coffee first? And maybe some breakfast?”
“What do you say I go run a bath for us?” Tony suggested as he brushed his chapped lips over Steve’s soft ones. “Nice and warm with those bubbles you like?”
“That I would be envious for, but I’m always on my feet or doing some heavy lifting that I don’t have to worry much,” Tony smirked to Steve before driving off. “I used to do other activities that helped burn calories as well, but not so much anymore.”
Thor grinned. “Yes! The drink of the gods.” He pulled a bottle of it from inside the suit jacket he was wearing. “You seem to be a worthy man, Captain. Say, go get yourself a glass and I’ll pour you a drink.”
Rhodey rubbed a hand over his face. “So, let me get this straight: this started as a one-night stand that led to being friends with benefits that led to a relationship? And neither of you wanted to tell your closest friends because you were both too afraid to hurt our feelings?”
Steve just looked at me both surprised and curious. “How much did you tip that guy?” He asks after a moment.
Tony rubbed his arm and gave Steve a weird look. “Okay, are you angry with me or something? You’ve been cooped up in here since you woke, and now you’re throwing beaten-up punching bags at me?” He glanced around Steve and Tony’s brows pulled together. “Christ, Steve…” He saw all the beaten-up punching bags that Steve had already torn through and were lined up to be disposed of.
I nod a little as I listen to him. “Like a place to unplug?” It didn’t sound that bad actually. “Though if we get caught and questioned, what would we say to it only being us there?”
Just as that happened, someone hit Steve in the head with some displaced object that must have been lying around the floor. He turned around to face the culprit.
Steve smiled a little in his tiredness before he stepped over to help with the bags. He was carrying almost double what I had in my arms, but I didn’t care. He could very well carry all of them if he wanted. I’m sure he was just trying to help my ego. How sweet.
Steve pressed the button for the elevator, already dressed for the day, as he thought of what he could do with Tony. They could go to a local diner for breakfast, then – well, he didn’t know what else they could do. Steve didn’t know much about the modern-day city.
“Okay, are you just going to never look at me again? Or are you ever going to tell me what you didn’t tell Fury?” Tony crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow, a look in his eyes that would let Steve know he wasn’t backing down.
Steve grabbed what he needed before he walked down to the garage. “Jarvis, inform Tony when he wakes up that I’m out on a ride, so he won’t worry.”
Just then, Steve walked out of the elevator with Bruce by his side. Rhodey turned to them before he let out a soft breath that almost sounded relieved.
“So, you just have America running through your mind and subconscious twenty-four-seven then?” I snort, looking at him in amusement. “Next are you going to tell me that you sing the national anthem in your sleep? Because as your roommate and driver, I should know.”
Tony pressed himself against Steve as they kissed, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck. Tony only pulled away, so they could both catch their breath.
Tony didn’t want to look Steve in the eyes. “You don’t have to lie, Steve. It’s nothing I’ve never heard before.”
“So, what? Capsicle isn’t around either.” Tony didn’t fully intent on throwing Steve under the bus, but all the heat was on himself even though they were always gone at the same times. Either way, it still earned him a small glare from Steve.
Steve’s eyes snapped open before they widened in horror. “Tony—!” He hurried over and grabbed Tony’s shoulders, quickly examining the other male.
“Yeah, it was too lonely.” Steve offered Tony a small smile before sat next to the other male. “And I got curious about sand castles. How do you get it to stay and not just, you know, fall over?” He was genuinely curious. Steve never got around to going on the beach growing up. His family wasn’t near the definition of wealthy.
We eat in a silence for the most part, until Steve started to speak up once I was only munching on my fries. “Did you get enough rest?” He asked me kindly, having finished his own burger and made his way to his own fries.
“Sir, I’m sorry to interrupt, but your pizza is being sent up the elevator,” Jarvis interrupted. Tony sighed before he reluctantly got up, pulling away from Steve.
I didn’t get up until my coffee was finished, and I still hadn’t changed or finished packing. Oh well.
Tony breathed sharply out his nose before he started driving. But it was in the opposite direction of the tower.
“Then I’ll be a little late,” I shrug then takes another sip of my coffee. “He’s a super soldier. He has the ability to wait.”
Tony put a hand on the car and leaned on it, staring at Steve with both shock and confusion. “I don’t feel comfortable taking that bet,” He stated in defeat after a moment of silence.
Fury gave Tony a questionable look who just shrugged. “You know as much as I do. He might just be having one of those days.”
Tony lifted his head and looked over Steve’s face to see if he was being honest. “Alright,” He sighed before he pulled himself away from Steve. “I can’t remember the last time I’ve been to the beach anyways.” He waved off, not wanting to admit he was agreeing because he had a soft spot for Steve.
I simply wave a hand in the air. “Sorry, the information,” I correct then pulls on a small smile for him. “What’s up?”
Steve’s thoughts were flying a million miles per hour, and Tony was almost driving just as fast with Jarvis’ directions. How had he never thought to check the weapons? How had Tony remembered the field?
Steve stood there as Tony rambled, and he took in Tony’s appearance in the golden light from the setting sun. He had worn a suit that day, but his suit jacket was off. He didn’t realize Tony was waiting for an answer until he spoke again.
glad you asked, Captain America,” I send him a grin before I turn on my heel and walks back over to the suitcase. “I would deeply appreciate it if you used your super soldier strength to close my suitcase for me.”
“So, you’re telling me that you tried just about all of the thousands upon thousands of variations a single day could have?” Tony scooted himself closer to Steve. “With that mind of yours, you can remember every little detail. Just…you have to try.”
Steve’s arms tightened around Tony, not enough to hurt but enough to be secure. It felt odd how he was panicking a few Thursdays ago and now he was here with Tony. Steve felt relaxed, and it wasn’t just because of the meadow.
Sam shook his head before he wiped his forehead with his arm. “Cap, you alright? You didn’t hit your head or anything, did you? No brain damages?”
We walked inside together, this time I held the door open for him, and we made our way to the check-in counter where only one person was at for the night.
The whole time as he walked towards the conference room, Tony was trying to visualize who the mystery person could be. It must have been someone that Tony wouldn’t outright agree to talking to yet someone who FRIDAY knows and trusts.
“To wherever this building is where the dealers are at. It won’t be another hour or more until we get there if it goes the same,” Tony shrugged. “You know where it is, I can drive, and we can get ready now.”
Tony looked down at their intertwined hands with a smile. “If what you say is true, then I absolutely despise that I won’t be able to remember any of this.” He looked back up, and Steve saw pity in Tony’s eyes.
The only difference this time from the last couple of guns was how this one shot right through the armor and seemed to have vaporized a chunk of Tony’s torso.
It doesn’t matter though. Fury wouldn’t change his mind no matter what I persuaded or bribed or threatened him with.
Steve greeted Thor with a nod before he smiled. “I am, for the most part. Tony sent me here actually.” He rubbed the back of his neck. He didn’t really know how to bring it up without being rude. He didn’t like asking for things all too often. “He said you have this Asgardian drink?”
“Okay, but I’m gonna eat at the same time,” Tony warned before he took his first bite of his food. “Anyways,” He started with a mouthful. “I don’t even know what to say. I’m pretty sure that I liked them for a while, but it got pushed aside. Then resurfaced pretty fast. And ever since it’s been steadily getting worse.”
Steve’s smile got bigger and he accidentally abandoned the conversation he was in before. “Hey, I guess we both got distracted.” He chuckled. “I’m having a good time though.”
Tony looked up from smoothening an edge on the castle, the corner up his lips quirking up. “Got tired of the water?”
He wanted more than anything to be able to turn his back and walk out to never see Steve’s face again. But Steve’s face is everywhere, and even though Tony was beyond angry with Steve, he didn’t want to risk the wrong person seeing Steve here.
“Can we order some pizza or something? One Thursday you cooked for us, and there may or may not have been a fire.” Steve was still sullen and exhausted, but his words were light, like he was poking fun at Tony.
Steve decided to lean his head back and close his eyes. He felt like he was spinning. “The people themselves aren’t threatening, not really, but do keep in mind they have alien weapons.”
“Mr. Rogers, you are requested at S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters with Mr. Stark immediately. A mission is waiting.” Again, it was the same thing as the day before.
Tony took a deep breath as he neared the conference room doors. “This is going to be painful,” He muttered to no one as he stood in front of the two doors. He was about to relive the past couple years all over again when he’s been trying his hardest to block out every part of by busying himself with new technology and helping the spider-kid.
Once that was over with, Steve made his way straight for the medical center at Shield’s headquarters. The nurses directed him towards Tony’s room without question.
It made Steve’s head ache as well as his heart. He closed his eyes tightly before he gritted his teeth and threw another punch at the punching bag without looking, knowing already where it was hanging from. Something was off though. Before Steve heard the thud from it hitting the floor, he heard a person’s pained grunt then the thud.
“I figured they did that for you,” I muse before I pull my glasses back on. “I have to admit, you’re quite the observer, Rogers.” I smile a little to him before I step out the car, trying to not let it get to me. He noticed such a small detail like that and remembered it? Granted he does remember everything since the serum enhanced his memory, but damn.
Tony pulled himself away to go look around for Steve. It was his birthday after all, and Tony wanted to be there for his boyfriend on his birthday. Before he could reach Steve, who still wasn’t seen by Tony, he got pulled into a conversation with Clint.
Tony braced his hands on Steve’s thigh as he pushed himself up into a sitting position. “I have a couple meetings coming up. I think you have something at SHIELD. Oh, and we have a PR event some point next week. Pepper will send more details soon, I’m sure.”
Back at headquarters, Fury came immediately once informed about the situation. Thor, along with other agents, ushered Loki into a cell that they made specifically Loki-proof after the events in New York. Steve and Tony went with Fury into a debriefing room.
“Just eat this, okay? I’ll probably eat about,” Tony eyed the pizza. “Four slices?” He nodded, confirming it to himself. “Yeah, you can eat the rest. And if not, then cold pizza in the morning is also as delicious.”
Tony walked over with a glass of whiskey in his hand, the other in one of his pockets. “You’ve been isolated all day. Is everything alright? If you’re feeling homesick or anything we can take a trip to Brooklyn. Or is it your room? Because I can get someone to redecorate it for you,” Tony started to ramble. He had been worried about Steve, and it was obvious.
Too many. Too many Thursdays have passed and gone, and Steve was no closer to discovering what was going on than he was two weeks into the loop.
So, when Tony finally woke up a couple hours later, he had a glass of water and two Advil’s on his nightstand.
“Oh really? Because I thought you were, what, 90 something years old and running away. I must be mistaken for another old fossil,” Tony snapped back.
“Well, sir, it seems that the entirety of the back of the suit is deeply damaged and needs repairs before any flight. Your back appears to be okay,” JARVIS responded obediently once he assessed the damage. “I have contacted S.H.I.E.L.D. about the completion of the mission.”
“Fine. We’ll do it your way,” I finally admit as I tug on the edges of my sleeves. “Tomorrow at around…let’s say two, we can have a discussion on the parameters of the mission. As well as your strategies. Sound good? Good.”
Tony grinned before he stepped into the tub of bubbles along with the other man. “You know, it’s not too late to back out and just let the house cleaners take care of it. That way we can enjoy our morning tomorrow.”
Steve couldn’t help the smile that tugged at his lips. It was tiny, but it was still there and that was enough for Tony to know Steve would be alright. “It is. Let me finish.” He moved his free arm up, brushing back Tony’s hair.
What if it was Bruce? He’s been MIA for almost two years now. Tony nodded his head to himself. It’s the only reasonable answer after all. He couldn’t think of who else would come to the compound and try to surprise him by remaining anonymous.
Steve managed to regain a little pep in his step after the day at the beach. He didn’t necessarily have his hand fully grasping hope, but he at least had his index finger and middle finger hanging onto it.
“Since when do PR events turn into birthday bashes?” Steve questioned as he sulked back into his seat. He wasn’t a big birthday person. He never was. Back in the forties, he was just focused on surviving. Now, in the twenty-first century, he was too preoccupied with more of the same, just for different reasons.
Tony tried to think of what it could be. “Was it something I said?” He inquired. “Because I have a bad habit of saying things that makes a situation weird.”
? Sorry, Cap. You’re going to—” He was cut off by one of the guys shooting the off-guard Tony with one of the alien guns.
Steve had suited up though. He had his shield on his back and his cowl in his hand. “I’ll punch in the address for you – or Jarvis,” He called out as he walked to the car that he knew Tony would pick. It was always the same car.
“What?” Steve looked to meet Tony’s knowing eyes. “I’m…I’m not hiding anything…” He attempted to lie, but it was useless. Steve slumped his shoulders and leaned back into the couch in defeat. “Fine. I’ll tell you. And I guess it doesn’t really matter if things get weird, because I’ll be the only one to remember today anyways.”
“Tony are you okay?” Steve asked with worry dripping from his voice as he turned around. Though, clearly, he wasn’t.
The tension was worse between them since the two were in close quarters in the car. Steve tried to avoid Tony’s gaze. He just ruined what could have been an amazing Thursday.
His cheeks, as if by nature now, turned its light shade of pink as he smiled. “Oh. Good. At least I was close to remembering.”
“I don’t care about that right now,” I cut off before I push my glasses up more nose more. “Did you read the part of the briefing where we’ll have no internet? I won’t even be able to use any of my service,” I exclaim a tad more dramatically than needed.
“My food?” Steve raised an eyebrow as he looked at me. “It’s just a burger, Tony. It’s the double mushroom swiss burger.”
Tony watched with a hard face as Steve stood from his chair. He headed for the door, and Tony couldn’t think of anything to say. He didn’t even know what to think. He wanted to be able to look past all of this, but he knew it would also take time for this to heal.
Steve was obviously taken aback at the bluntness of Tony’s greeting, though he didn’t seem offended. After all, it was Tony’s right to act this way.
Steve let out a bitter chuckle at that thought of this. Maybe that’s why Loki started the loop. Just so Steve could feel Tony’s sleep deprivation for himself.
The suit was ruined in the front as whatever substance it was had melted away the metal, which fell onto Tony’s chest and dripped down.
Steve spun around quickly, mentally kicking himself in the ass. He shouldn’t have worded it that way. “Tony,
Our first stop ended up being around eight for breakfast. I could tell Steve was itching to get out and stretch those long limbs of his. I'm surprised he lasted this long in the car without asking for a rest stop. He couldn't sit still for long even at the tower.
He kept his front facing the doors as he gripped the handles tightly. His heart was beating out of control.
Tony let his eyes roam over Steve’s body unabashedly. Now that he knew Steve was into men, it was like a barrier was broken. “I have a question for you, Cap,” He stated as he felt himself take a step closer to Steve. “What kind of guys are you into?”
“Come on. Either way, I’m hungry.” I pat Steve on the shoulder before I lead the way inside. There weren’t many people in there for the morning, which I was thankful for. Even though we didn’t have to worry about being caught in public or have to try to hide, it was still nice to not have to worry about a restaurant full of people.
Steve just shook his head. “I’ll...I’ll tell you the other stuff later, okay?” He made himself smaller to get closer to Tony’s comforting presence. “Can we just…go lay down or something?” It almost didn’t feel real that this could be over. And Steve definitely wasn’t going to get his hopes up incase something was still up Loki’s sleeve.
Tony took a deep breath before he got up. Steve was not forgiven. Not yet. That day may come, it may not. In the meantime, Tony felt a sense of closure, and that was enough for him until he was ready for more.
It was hard for Tony not to explode with his emotions. He was angry, but he had to try to not let this lead to a fight. “You were my…friend. You could have told me, and I would have understood. But to know that you kept it from me? It was the tipping point on an already heavy plate.”
“Steve? Steve,” Tony snapped in front of Steve’s face with a slight grin. “Stay here, buddy. I’m going down and get the food.”
He made himself a cup of coffee and some eggs before he sat down at his little table that fit in the apartment Tony decorated for him. There was no way he could stay in this tower doing nothing. Tony would be able to find Steve anywhere because of Jarvis. And because of how well Tony knows Steve.
He programs the card key for the room then takes my debit card before he starts to put it on the file. “I need a little more information first: your name, phone number, stuff like that,” He informed us as he looks at the debit card, and his eyes widen. “No way. You’re
I give him a shrug in response then sets my notepad on the desk. “Let’s get started then, shall we?”
Tony grinned and stole a glance over to Steve. “Who needs stealth? You’re a supersoldier and I’m Iron Man.”
Memories of past intimate Thursdays flashed through Steve’s mind and he turned to look out the window as a blush formed on his cheeks. “You mean, uhm, fondueing?” Steve mentally face-palmed. This wasn’t the 1940’s anymore. And that wasn’t even a saying then.
“What if we stop and got gas at five-thirty, but it isn’t quite six yet? Would we just go back on the road for another half hour then stop again and waste time?” Steve countered back theoretically.
Tony was strong, but not that strong. Not when he had a little over two bottles of whiskey swirling around the inside of his body. Not when it came to Steve.
,” He stepped in front of Tony, gently holding onto Tony’s shoulders. “I didn’t mean it that way. You’re too much for me as in I don’t deserve you.” Steve moved a hand to cup Tony’s jaw, towering over him a bit because of their height differences.
It beeped as Tony unlocked it, already having grabbed the keys. “So, do I get to know any more about your epiphany?” He questioned as they both stepped into the car. “Because if we need our suits, I’m curious to what danger we’re about to get ourselves into.”
I rub my eyes roughly before I step out the car, sighing in relief at the feel of the flat ground. “Shit. I’m so ready to just get in a bed and
“I can take it a little longer,” Steve chuckled after I finished my yawn. “I rather you get some rest. We can’t be sleep deprived while on a mission.”
“Shut up!” Steve roared in anger. He didn’t want to hear how he failed himself and most importantly, he didn’t want Tony to hear it either who was currently looking increasingly concerned.
I may be terrified of us crashing, but deep down I know Jarvis wouldn’t let us crash, and I know Steve wouldn’t either.
“I told you to stay back,” Steve grounded out in anger before he turned and finally punched the guy nearest. Tony rolled his eyes before he snapped his face plate closed and blasted a guy with his repulsors.
The alarm clock beeped at 6:30am as always, and Steve snapped his fingers to shut it off. He slid his legs off the bed and sat up, rolling his shoulders to get rid of the remaining ache from yesterday.
Tony had ingested more alcohol than he intended (he was trying to get sober, after all), but it was going to be okay.
Tony looked over at Steve with pursed lips before he made his way to the kitchen. “What do you want? I’ll make you anything. Or order, because you also know I’m not the best cook.” He chuckled at himself before he looked to Steve, waiting for the order.
He tried to stay right with Tony’s promise. He really did. Steve attempted not going to the mission at all, but Thursday still came. He attempted to destroy all the weapons, but Thursday still came. He attempted to get more intimate with Tony to see if he was the key, but Thursday still came. He attempted to not talk to Tony at all, but Thursday still came. Again. And again. And again.
“No, I don’t,” Tony grumbled as he blindly reached for the blankets. “I need sleep. That’s what I need. I’m not a super soldier like some people around here.”
I clench my jaw a little. He did make a fair point, but that didn’t mean I have to accept it. He was just so infuriating. “A little heads up
“I can’t believe my two favorite people are bashing on me,” Tony exclaimed dramatically before he caught what he said. “T-Two favorite people around me, that is,” He added somewhat casually.
He opened the door without knocking, too worried about his teammate and best friend. “Tony?” Steve’s eyes found Tony’s as soon as he entered the room, and there was no looking away or adverting gazes.
“You really outdid yourself, Stark,” Clint grinned as he clapped his hand on Tony’s shoulder. “I mean, renting out part of Central Park? I didn’t even know that was possible!” He laughed as he shook his head.
They began to yell at each in hushed tones, and it sounded like they were getting ready for something. Though before anything could happen, Tony burst through the side of the building into the crowded room and started firing his repuslors at the dealers.
“That, kind sir, is not fair,” Tony huffed out. He was definitely not turned on by that small action.
“Steve,” Tony shook his head then grabbed Steve’s hands. “If I never told you that I loved you before then told you as I was dying, it is definitely nothing near platonic.”
Steve stared at Tony’s back before he followed. He didn’t know much about Tony and Howard’s relationship, except that Howard drunk and worked a lot and the real Jarvis helped raise Tony.
“Stark, we don’t have a choice,” Steve interrupted this time, which, by the way, threw me completely off guard. I couldn’t help but to stare at him with my mouth open for a moment before I was able to compose myself. But he wasn’t done. “Fury wants us to take a car to not seem like we’re on official business that a jet or plane would seem like. It’s all about how we portray ourselves, remember? And if you hadn’t of stormed off, we would have gotten to talk about this,” Steve finished firmly.
He balled his hands into fists and stared at the punching bag. Steve reeled his arm back and punched it with everything he had, sending it flying and hitting the wall harder than the previous punching bag had.
He shrugged and grinned loosely before he tipped back more of his drink. “I haven’t felt like this since—” Steve paused as he started to sway. “Since the second war. Before the serum.”
“H-Holy shit. You are—You’re Tony Stark! And you just-just tipped me—” The waiter stumbled over his words, and I held my hand up to silence him.
I wrap my hand around my own mug and brings it to my lips for a sip. It felt good and warm going down. I don’t need sleep to re-energize. I just need coffee is all. That way I can keep driving. “I’ll keep it in mind then, Cap,” I answer more vaguely. This way Steve could feel more relaxed.
Steve let out a short laugh. “You do tend to live on the dramatic side.” He faintly smiled to Tony. “But love takes many different forms,” He then added with a more forlorn tone of voice.
“Just make sure you don’t snore too loud, got it?” Steve warned jokingly with a small grin, and that alone brought a small smile to my face.
“It sets the tone,” Shrugged Tony before he laughed. “And I’m proud of you for knowing the genre,” Tony sounded truly impressed. “Have you been catching up finally?”
Steve went to say something back again once I started to talk, but then it clamped shut at the end of it. I guess he didn’t want to comment on it in some old, conservative opinion and then us argue this late.
“Right… Yeah, of course,” I breathe out, rubbing a hand over my face. “Where are we?” I ask before Steve could get the chance to start bouncing questions off me.
“Are any of them much of a threat?” Tony asked as he took a turn. He also didn’t want Steve’s mind to go into overdrive. “So, I know what I’m up against.”
Steve rubbed his hands over his face as he slumped back. “It’s-It’s more complicated than that, Tony…” His voice quieted at the end as it droned off.
The medical center was pretty big, and it was filled with highly advanced machines and technology that Steve would never understand. Tony motioned Steve to a chair before he started the machine and got the wires ready.
“Yes, because I just go and get myself killed on purpose,” Tony replied sarcastically with a grin, though it dropped when he saw Steve’s sober expression. “Did that happen before in the, uhm, loop?” He scratched the back of his neck.
“Tones…” Steve’s voice was soft and tempting to Tony, but he couldn’t give in. Not after everything.
Steve looked out to the water before he took off his jacket, then preceded to take off his clothes. Tony eyed Steve curiously, totally not checking Steve out in the process.
over tights?!” He zoomed in on the picture before he laughed. “This is so much better than your current suit. It flatters your ass more too.”
It was the way Tony had answered that made Steve not want to push on the subject, so the next few minutes were filled with a silence between them.
“You are the genius.” Steve pressed one last kiss to Tony’s head before he let himself drift off to sleep.
“If I had, then I wouldn’t be asking you about it, would I?” I huff out before I shake my head. “Driving. Why are we
“Ready for what? I would hope that the two of you are smart enough to know we wouldn’t judge you,” Natasha told them as she took a few steps closer to them.
Steve clasped his hands together tightly for a moment before he released as he let out a deep breath. There wasn’t a single Thursday that Tony denied Steve’s affections, but it didn’t make Steve’s doubts and fears go away. If everything went right, he had no more do-overs.
A heavy sigh was Steve’s response. “It’s only been two weeks of it and I’m running out of things to do. I don’t know who to even suspect. Or what.”
“That so?” Steve mused with a grin. He revved up the engine. “Maybe Iron Man doesn’t to Captain America, but Tony Stark does with Steve Rogers.”
“Tony?” Steve called out as he ventured farther into the suite. He stayed in the middle of the room to avoid snooping. He may be drunk, but he was still respectful.
Steve leaned back and sipped from his coffee after that. “What do you think our guy will look like?”
“What do you mean another?” Sam answered in between pants as he gave Steve a weird look. “For the past
It was two o’clock sharp when Steve walked into my office the next day. I shouldn’t have been as surprised as I was though. Steve has always been punctual for as long as I’ve known him.
“When Bucky came in, I knew he wouldn’t be treated as he needed to be treated. Not only was he falsely accused, but he wasn’t even The Winter Solider until Zemo snuck in and said the words he needed to. That isn’t Bucky’s fault.”
“You’re too much for me, you know,” Steve breathed out softly and with a gentle fondness, though that went right over Tony’s head.
“I’m not done with you,” Tony stated with a finger pointed towards Steve, though a soft expression on his face. Almost pitied.
Christ, thinking of that man alone had Tony knocking back the rest of his whiskey. Every other night or so, when Tony didn’t get so exhausted he’d just pass out, he would stare at the phone. Or sleep with it. Or just carry it anywheres he went.
He didn’t find it as funny as me, but he also didn’t take it as hard as I was expecting. “And I wonder why that is, Stark.”
“So, what? I’m supposed to honestly believe that you calling me drunk means nothing?” Steve deadpanned. “I’m calling bullshit, Tony.”
The moment was over far too soon as the clean up crew came as well as a few agents of Shield. They took Tony off to medical and Steve was left alone to deal with the debriefing.
“No, I don’t,” I snap back. “I can go get a coffee from inside if you’re worried about it, but I’m driving.”
“Rogers, I’m excusing you because you can’t get drunk, but you have to learn how to loosen up. It’s the twenty-first century now,” Tony’s voice exclaimed rather loudly over the crowd of conversing people and distant music playing.
I shrug with a grin, speeding up as we get on the interstate ramp. “It is. And stop sounding like such a grandpa, jeez. You’re America’s most wanted bachelor yet you sound like you should be in a nursing home telling stories of
“I do love you, Steve. And Christ, I’m so sorry that you had to go through that alone,” Tony apologized with such sorrow that Steve knew it was honest.
The next morning is where some sense finally got knocked into both of them. In other words, the alcohol wore off.
Steve wiped his brow before he hooked up another punching bag then stretched his arms out again. He let out a heavy breath before he struck the new punching bag with his fist. He heard the first few seams break from the contact.
A grin spread across Tony’s face. “In that case, you should kiss me again,” He suggested with a twinkle in his eyes.
Steve got up and showered off the grim that he felt was still on him from last night before he went to his kitchen. He couldn’t bear to go on the same mission again today, and he couldn’t be normal around Tony yet.
“No, Tony. I’m not in the mood for your jokes right now. What the hell is going on? What haven’t you been telling us?” Rhodey exclaimed with a pointed look at Tony.
Steve grinned as he followed the sound of Tony’s voice. That grin was quickly wiped away once he entered the room. “T-Tony?” His mouth fell open into an o-shape as he gaped down with wide eyes.
The check-in guy turned to his computer and typed quickly, searching through whatever files or spreadsheets for a room for us. “Yes, I can get a key now for it and have you both booked for it. Will you be paying credit or debit, and how many nights are you planning to stay?”
“Got it. Be careful,” Steve replied back as he advanced towards the side door of the building. He gripped the doorknob and gave it a testing turn to see if it was locked. It was. He tightened his grip on the object and gave it a forceful tug.
Rhodey contemplated the two. “You know, I can’t decide between them – they were both awful,” He laughed and put a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
“Well, hey, at least I got the sleep either way.” Tony shrugged then picked up his mug to take a sip.
“Tony, please don’t. They’re godawful,” Steve pleaded as he held his phone away. “It wasn’t made for combat so it’s basically a costume for those shows I had to do.”
“I’ll have to repay you for the breakfast and for everything else you’ve done for me,” Steve stated as he glanced over to Tony. “And don’t say I don’t have to. One day—” When Steve is out of the loop. “I’ll repay you for
“Tony, the point is I’m sorry. Everything got so…so carried away. I was stubborn. It’s a bad habit of mine that apparently got enhanced after the serum,” Steve grumbled the last part to himself, and Tony couldn’t help the feeling of a smile coming on. But it was just a feeling. “Bucky… After my mom died, I only had Bucky. He offered to take me in, but I was too stubborn even for that.”
My heart rate starts to rise drastically as those thoughts speed through my mind. “Wh-What happened?” I ask out loud confused and panicked, sitting up quickly and opening my eyes at the same time.
He kept his eyes on me for a split second more before his gaze turned down to the menu. “Yeah, I think something’s caught my fancy.”
Once he saw Sam, Steve passed him up and – as always – called out, “On your left.” He looked back over his shoulder and laughed as he received the same look he had yesterday.
“And you’re telling me that you—” Steve paused and furrowed his brows. “Wait, tight?” He questioned, not getting what Tony was referring to. “My suit is tight?”
Alright?” Tony snapped with a sharp edge to his voice. “It didn’t mean anything. All that it meant was that I was in a bad place and, on top of that, I had too much to drink.”
Steve returned the grin as he rested his hands on Tony’s hips. “I’m Captain America. I never back down from a challenge.”
“If you want, we could switch up who drives at each stop,” Steve offered after a few more moments. “It would be better for you to get some rest in between drives, and it would help me not go crazy in the passenger seat.”
“There’s obviously something going on with you today. And we need to talk about it. So, we need to be away from where people can find us.” Tony didn’t even glance over as he spoke, his emotions hidden on his face as if he had his helmet on.
With that, Steve turned off the microphone and stepped off the table as the music finally turned back on. He looked at who was around him and smiled when he saw Natasha’s familiar face.
“You really do know how to leave a mark,” Steve mused as we walked out the Waffle House. “Normally I keep to myself in public if it’s not on some official business.”
Tony smiled warmly to Steve before he started on his second and last burger. “Please,” He waved at Steve dismissively. “If I
Tony rested his back against Steve’s chest as they sat comfortably and gazed out at the meadow and other wildlife. “For us.”
Rhodey walked over and raised an eyebrow. “You haven’t gone out in weeks without it being related to work or Iron Man. Who do you have plans with?” He crossed his arms.
Some Thursday mornings Steve would play casual and call Thor to check on Loki, who would then realize Loki wasn’t actually
“If you’ll excuse me,” I begin to say as I stand up from my chair, buttoning together my suit jacket. “I have a meeting I should probably get to. I’ll see you around, Rogers.”
“Uhm, almost overflowing?” Tony answered just as sheepishly as he looked. “I’ll get someone to clean it in the morning. It’ll be fine.”
“What if I only drive until lunch?” He offered as a counter argument. “It’s only for a few hours. You can take a nap between then and lunch, re-energize at lunch with some food, then take back the wheel after if you feel like it.”
Currently, Steve was reading a book with Tony’s head resting on his lap as they relaxed in the living room of Tony’s suite. As Steve’s focus remained on the printed words, Tony’s focus was fixated on Steve’s face.
Steve sat with Tony, cradling Tony’s head in his lap, until S.H.I.E.L.D. came after Steve called. He felt void of anything now. He couldn’t stop worrying and panicking that this was the last Thursday and he wouldn’t get Tony back. He couldn’t get those words out of his head. He couldn’t get that image out of his head.
Tony relaxed with each leg on either side of Steve, his arms loosely draped over Steve’s shoulders. “I need me more Steve time,” He pouted, resting his forehead on Steve’s.
“You and him got along well. At least, it seemed so from how my dad talked about you.” Tony kept hold of Steve’s hand as they sat there and talked about stuff that was most likely hard for Steve.
With his hands in his pockets, Steve walked alongside Tony – notably at a safe distance – as they made their way towards where the party was centered at. Steve was quickly whisked away by the numerous people wishing him a happy birthday, and Tony was whisked away by the people groveling at his feet and others trying to talk business.
He had to be going crazy. Maybe he was aging rapidly after being in the ice for so long. All those years just catching up on him.
Steve rested their foreheads together, letting their bodies sway together. “Tones, I appreciate you worrying about me. I do. But I can’t talk about it,” He attempted to reason with a gentle voice. “It’s a beautiful day, and we’re at the beach. Can we just enjoy that since we’re here?”
Tony snorted before he nudged Steve as he glanced around as if to make sure no one was listening. His drunkenness wasn’t making that very discreet. “Go see Thor. He has this Asgardian drink that he isn’t letting any mortal have. But he might just give some to you, Cap.”
“They better be damn special,” He grumbled out loud. Of course, FRIDAY didn’t answer. He missed Jarvis.
“Of course. Your rational thoughts work better that way,” Steve teased lightly before he pulled away with a faint smile. He wasn’t looking forward to the chaos that would be unleashed, but he knew he still had Tony through it all. After all, the chaos was revolving around their secret relationship.
Steve started the bike then peeled out before Tony could manage to convince Steve to let Tony tag along. Once again, he peeled through the streets of New York to the building.
It’s been different ever since Steve started officially living there. It seemed as they didn’t butt heads as often, and it certainly helped with their missions with each other. One could say they even became friends in the past year.
He rubbed some lotion on his hands before he started to rub his hands and dig his thumbs into Tony’s back. Steve watched in admiration as Tony reacted to the touch with little grunts and relaxing muscles.
I smile a little to myself before I look up to the waiter, ordering my food with a cup of coffee. Steve does the same before he sets our menus aside where they were.
“There just happened to be some paparazzi there who saw us and took a perfectly timed photo,” Steve added with a small huff after. “We wanted to wait until we were ready to tell everybody.”
“It is Asgardian,” Tony breathed out quietly. “It’s the same inscriptions that were on Loki’s staff.”
“Steve, what are you—?” Rhodey began to question before he cut himself off. “Right. You’ve been fucking Tony. That’s why you’re in here.”
Steve’s cheeks turned a little pink. Was he…embarrassed? No, he couldn’t be. This was Cap, and he only got embarrassed when people talked about sex around him or genitalia.
Thinking of that made Tony halt. Bruce doesn’t even know who Bucky is. Well, everyone who knows Steve Rogers knows who Bucky Barnes is. Though Bruce wouldn’t know Bucky as the Hydra Assassin commonly referred to as The Winter Soldier.
Steve rubbed a hand over his face. “Tell Tony I’m on my way up,” He bit out as his frustration came back.
Clint even called us out on it one day by saying we bicker like an old married couple. Which I, by the way, didn’t appreciate nor did Steve.
Tony smiled to himself as he zoomed through the streets. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you’d taken an interest in what I do.”
Thor immediately went to Loki’s side, cuffing him up. “Steven, I apologize for any thing that my brother has done.”
“Jarvis, tell me again why I’m doing this stupid mission?” I groan as I reluctantly grab more pairs of clothing. I should probably grab some sweatpants. Those should be good for a long car ride, right?
It was mainly a lot of subtle flirts thrown here and there – including stolen glances over Steve’s body – and the obvious flirts thrown his way.
Steve had went up to the common floor of the tower and was on the strip outside. It was breezier up there, but it helped Steve remember that he was grounded. He was sat on the edge with his legs dangling over.
Sweatpants and some random band t-shirt were what was set aside for today, so I was able to quickly change into those clothes. Now the only thing left to do was close my last suitcase that I had opened.
Fury leaned back in the chair he sat in, and he kicked his feet up right on the edge of my desk. The fucking disrespect. He was in
Steve sighed in defeat, though it wasn’t much of a bother to him. He liked hanging out with Tony, and maybe them talking can destress him. He managed to smile faintly at Tony. “Give me four burgers then. Everything on it.”
Tony stared in utter confusion, reaching over and grabbing both of Steve’s wrists gently. “I’m not following here, Cap. Use your words.”
Steve scooted to the edge of the couch, opening the top box and eagerly taking a slice. “On Thursday,” He tried to joke lightly as he brought the slice closer to his face, though Tony had this look on his face that was certainly not amused. “Too soon?” He questioned sheepishly before he started to eat. It wasn’t really something Steve wanted to joke about either, but he didn’t want to get back to what Tony wanted to ask.
“Because…” Tony shrugged and walked alongside Steve on the sidewalk. “Because I just feel more comfortable driving myself.”
Tony shrugged then turned back to look at the scenery. “Other than that cave I was kept in? Not really.” A small breeze passed them, and Tony smiled. “I didn’t like it there. But I like this.”
Steve reached out and grabbed Tony’s wrists gently. “We can’t get explosive over this, Tones. It happened. But we have to talk about this. Like, now. Before it blows up in our faces more.”
“I don’t know much else to say, so please, enjoy yourselves and remember to throw all your trash away in the bins,” Steve concluded with a raised eyebrow to everyone before a charming smile fell on his face.
“Well you know me, I’m everything but personal,” I chuckle. “I guess you don’t really know me though. You aren’t around me enough,” I ponder on once I realize what I said.
Steve’s fist balled tightly at his sides as his jaw set. He wouldn’t ever be able to get out of the loop. He wouldn’t ever be able to have a life with Tony that Steve’s spent the past five months knowing was very possible.
“One night, and debit.” I set the bags down that I’m holding to grab my wallet, pulling out a card that we use explicitly for mission funds.
are we ready to leave?” He asked impatiently, and his body did the thing where he leaned his weight on one leg with his hip sticking out a little.
Steve met back up with Tony after they both separated to get dressed. “What exactly are we going to do? Or where are we going?”
“They are better,” He decided with a small nod, a thoughtful expression on his face. “They’re faster, safer, and a shit ton comfier. That is until you sit in them for hours at a time,” He chuckled to himself then proceeded to drive us back to the interstate. “Having Jarvis give directions will be a huge help too.”
“Not important,” I wave off. “Just enough to make him feel comfortable. I overheard him on the phone with his landlord, and it sounded like he was struggling.” I shrug. It was nothing. I do stuff like this all the time, but apparently it was news to Steve.
“It’s a shame that you came alone. Though, it’s one less of you to worry about.” Broken Nose Guy mused as he crouched down, pressing the barrel of the gun under Steve chin. “It’s time for you to go back to sleep, Cap.” Before Steve could get a word out he heard the sound of the gun being fired.
Steve finally closed his door and walked away towards the store, and I could feel myself relax as I pay for the gas. He was hot, that I couldn’t deny. No one could. He’s a fucking super soldier who wears tight shirts.
Once Sam left and Steve began walking back towards the tower, he took a look at his phone. Sure enough it displayed
Steve knew, from the many hours he and Tony talked as Tony worked, that it was a way for Tony to easily access the suit. Though, he had better ideas. They just weren’t ready yet in Tony’s world.
Steve stared at Tony as he tried to understand before he looked away and set down the newspaper. “I suppose,” He sighed before he took a few sips of coffee. “I had this dream last night of today, and so far, everything is just about the same.”
It was a few minutes more until the quinjet touched down on a rooftop a few blocks away from their destination. Tony flew ahead in his suit to scope out the area and look for heat signatures as Steve followed by jumping rooftop to rooftop.
Steve didn’t meet either of their gazes. They knew. Tony knew. And Steve knew that he would never be looked at the same. “He needs to be seen by Fury. We’ll ride together.” His voice was void of anything, and he walked out without another word.
The evening went by with more of the same as the two mingled around together. They would get split apart, but they would eventually find each other again.
He nodded and glanced over to me from above the menu. “I’m not used to it, I suppose. You just seem…more relaxed.”
This it it! You made it to the last part :) It's been amazing writing this. I've never truly finished a project before, and it feels wonderful. Hopefully I can hold on to this feeling with the other ideas I have in mind.
Should Steve include those years of his life that he doesn’t even remember? Or should he forget them to move passed them?
Steve waved a dismissive hand in the air. “Long story,” He chuckled, though his soft smile and gentle eyes quickly morphed into a scold as he poked Tony’s chest. “You ratted on me.”
Tony grabbed onto Steve’s wrist loosely, but it was all the strength that Tony could muster. “There’s…no time,” He grunted out painfully.
Tony’s head tilted a bit as he watched Steve with uneasiness. “Okay, something’s definitely up. Not that I’m not flattered – because damn am I, but this doesn’t seem like you.”
Steve’s mouth opened as to say something, but then it closed, and his cheeks went pink. Is it just me, or has that been happening a lot more lately?
“You-You can’t just— What the hell are you doing here?” Tony’s voice began to rise with his words before he realized the door was still ajar. Quickly, he turned and slammed the conference room doors closed then locked them.
“Then I missed 66 birthdays and I lost track. I don’t know if I should say I’m 30 or 96.” The crowd laughed at Steve’s joke, though Tony caught the genuine confusion.
“Ah! Captain!” Thor clapped Steve’s back enthusiastically. “Are you enjoying this wonderful mid-gardian party?”
They drifted away from the city as Steve drove them through back roads and towards abandoned fields and meadows. He finally stopped them at one before he pulled them to the side of the road.
It had to at least be around three in the morning, if not later. Tony’s been through two or so bottles of whiskey as of the current moment, and he wasn’t sober enough or willing enough to count how many glasses he had.
To Steve it was a big deal, but he didn’t push it further. Instead, he closed his eyes with his own smile on his face. Who knew Tony Stark could make him feel like this?
Steve stood up from the booth and thanked the guy as well before we walked back to the car. It must have just dawned on the waiter who was with me, because I heard his gasp before he whispered, “It’s
Steve knocked his alarm clock off his nightstand to get it to stop making such ear-piercing noises. He closed his eyes and folded his arms over the pillow rested on his head before he fell back asleep.
The door opened and Steve walked in with his hands clasped on his belt. Seriously, why does he do that? What’s the point? It drove me insane.
“If I’m not, then I’m screwed.” Steve forced out a small chuckle and Tony gave him a sympathetic look.
“Yeah, just hold on,” I reply as I lay my suit down on the bed neatly. It was one of my more favorite ones.  I probably shouldn’t be bringing it with me on a mission, but who knows what could come up? Maybe I will need to
There wasn’t much else Steve wanted to say after, so he kept himself from saying anything or he would ramble and end up freaking out. He didn’t want to do that, especially when Tony was sitting right next to Steve, so close to each other.
He pulled on his boxers and made himself a cup of coffee as he waited for Tony to get up. Steve needed some medicine to get rid of his aching headache, but anything Tony had would not work on his super soldier body.
Those five seconds felt like five months to Steve. All those five months-worth of Thursdays flashing through his mind as a presentation of slides that they normally have at meetings.
. Steve Rogers was still wearing the same Captain America uniform that Tony designed for him after the New York incident. Though, now it was dirty and noticeably hadn’t been washed with actual soap in what looks like decades.
“Most likely,” Steve hummed in agreement before he laid his menu down as well. “I’ll get their All-American breakfast.”
“No,” Tony’s brows furrowed. “Well, your brainwaves and neurons are all normal. That’s good. But that also means it has to be some outside force doing this to you, and that’s a lot harder to trace. Especially if we only have today. Or I only have today since I can’t remember.”
Steve put the kickstand down on his motorcycle before he walked down to the shore with his hands in his jacket pockets. He didn’t get many looks or glances as he made his way down, which he was glad for.
Steve chuckled lightly then shrugged his shoulders. “Apparently so. I didn’t even make the connection,” He answered modestly.
Steve leaned his head back and closed his eyes, feeling his stomach drop. He knew what it was about.
It wasn’t but a few minutes later that the music cut off and there was feedback from someone tapping on the head of a microphone. That someone was no other than Tony Stark standing on top a table more towards the center of the crowd.
Steve raised an eyebrow as he watched Tony with an amused look. He’s never truly seen morning Tony before. Sure, he once found Tony asleep in his workshop or his office in the early hours of the morning, but never coming straight out of bed.
When they made it back up to Tony’s suite, Steve made sure Tony had everything he needed and was situated on the couch. “We probably should have drove back. You weren’t in shape for the walk back.”
“About the relationship and each other. Are you certain?” Natasha clarified as she looked at them seriously.
The phone in Steve’s pocket buzzed again. He pulled it out with a small huff, expecting it to be Tony, but it was Natasha. That made Steve feel thrown off. She was supposed to be on her undercover mission. Either it was completed, or something went wrong.
I crack a grin then starts the car, pulling out of the garage. “I know. I was only waiting for my passenger to get all buckled.”
Steve laughed and shook his head as he walked into the bathroom. “Yes, sir.” He saluted then grinned cheekily before he started to take off his dress clothes from the party.
“I’m going for a swim,” Steve chuckled in response. He took off all his clothes except for his boxers. He was hoping a swim could help him relax.
Steve sighed before he pulled on his cowl and secured it. “Stay out of this one, Tony. It’s for your own safety.” His voice was everything serious, and Tony tapped his foot on the floor.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “He was just supposed to tell you I was out. Not that other part.”
Just as Steve said, they met in the garage in ten minutes, give or take a minute or two. Tony wasn’t suited up – at least, not in the Iron Man suit – but he had a briefcase in his hand that were the same colors as the suit.
They were each slowly pushing limits of intimacy in attempts to have more of the other, and since both wanted to get closer, they didn’t mind and let the affection happen.
This was something that, in these almost four months-worth of Thursdays, Steve never knew. He quickly turned his head over, and it would have given him whiplash if he was a normal person.
“I don’t see why. You have so much knowledge in your mind – especially more than myself – that you’re just so…so,” Steve paused to try to think of the right-fitting word. “
Tony got out as well, holding Steve’s phone out to him with a grin. “Yeah, I know. Howard was obsessed with you, remember?”
“Steve, come on,” Tony huffed out before he grinned to Steve. “It’s your birthday! And the Fourth of July! Let’s just have a little fun tonight.”
Steve rolled his eyes and he slumped more – if that was even possible. “Yeah, thanks for that reminder.”
A snort sounded from Tony as he set his mug down on the countertop. “Nice, huh? That wouldn’t be the exact word I’d use, but you do you I guess.” A little smirk formed on Tony’s face as Steve let out a short laugh.
It always needed to be charged at the end of the day when Tony spent his alone time staring at the number for Steve’s own little flip phone.
Steve shifted on his feet as he began to get impatient. “Yes, we are. The phone number you can put down is…” He told the guy with a firm voice, and I was stunned that he knew my number from memory. That is, until my brain reminded me that he could remember essentially everything.
What’s up with Steve, anyways? I can’t be the only one who sees the way he is with me. It’s vexing as hell, but it’s also very bothersome. I know most people can’t stand me. It’s just a little harder to swallow that Captain America, my crush from boyhood, is also one of those people.
“Of course. We can’t stop at five-thirty, Rogers. Are you crazy? Only six o’clock. Maybe even seven, but that’s pushing it,” I reply back seriously, but I can’t help the grin that tugged on my lips.
Steve nodded. “I’m positive. I can’t forget things.” That was all Tony needed to hear before he sped off in one of his fancy cars. “This isn’t exactly the stealthiest car,” Steve commented with a faint smile.
Jarvis woke me up not a second past four-thirty that following morning, but that didn’t mean I got out of bed at that time. I like giving myself a couple minutes of lying in the bed to wake up. What can I say? It’s relaxing for the morning.
“FRIDAY, remind me to check your circuits after the meeting.” Tony walked out his workshop. This was probably just a simple malfunction.
Steve stared up at Tony for a moment before he stood with pursed lips. “It’s worth a try…” Tony smiled warmly to Steve before they walked to the floor in the Avengers section of the tower to the medical center.
“Steve, where the fuck are you going?” Tony crossed his arms, walking until he stood in the way of the motorcycle. “I know you don’t have a mission.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Seriously, Rhodey? Since when do we cuss in this room?” He asked in a serious voice before the grin formed on his face.
to be on a mission and it could have gone wrong. I was worried for a friend.” He paused. “How did you even manage to use her number without her phone?”
“I honestly have no idea what could cause that,” Tony admitted with a sigh. “At least, nothing done by humans. I could try looking at your brainwaves and neurons to find any abnormal activity. Do you know any magical being that would want to do this to you?”
“You asked me if I wanted to spend the evening at your place and have dinner,” Steve replied carefully, trying to avoid letting out more than he wants to at the moment.
“Tony!” Steve dropped his guard and ran over to his friend. Tony fell down on his knees as he stared down to his torso.
Luckily Thor took that moment to barge in. He was radiating anger as well, but not for the same reason. Steve didn’t tell Thor everything, just that he located Loki on Earth – or Midgard.
Tony shot Steve a look, but it was ineffective with the tiredness still on his face. It had more resemblance with a pouty kid, which Steve thought was adorable.
When he turned on his tv to the news, it played the news reports from Thursday. He tried different news stations and it was the same.
One would think he would at least try to know me since he was buddies with my father and all, but it doesn’t seem that’s the case.
It made Tony worry every Thursday all over again, but for him it was the first time every day. Not to Steve though. Every Thursday his heart would twinge at how badly Tony worried. He couldn’t do anything about it except try his hardest to locate Loki.
Steve’s smile gradually grew as he listened to and admired his boyfriend. “I wouldn’t be too surprised if any of them knew. I’d actually be more surprised if they
Tony groaned, but then a slight grin appeared on his face. “Alright. Deal. Now get that wonderful ass of yours in those bubbles.” He smacked Steve’s ass as he passed, his signature smirk on his face.
Tony laughed. “It’s a good thing. I’m liking this you,” Tony commented with a devilish grin on his face. “I’ll definitely want to see it more.”
He was sweating a lot, and it should not have looked attractive on him. It wasn’t fair. I didn’t look like I was glistening when sweating.
The kiss was void of anything sexual, but that’s what Steve needed. The night before he needed more than just a kiss, but at this moment, Tony felt it was comfort Steve needed.
Steve and Tony had come home from a mission the day before and didn’t feel like getting back into their work routine quite yet. It had been an unsettling mission.
“I’m sorry,” Steve choked out with his face in Tony’s hair. Steve was sorry for many reasons, mainly for getting Tony killed and for pissing him off by waking him up so early. It wasn’t even seven in the morning.
They say never meet your childhood idols. Well, I never had the choice, did I? It was either walk away and be a dick or save the world. So, I saved the world and now
Even with that reassurance, Steve still felt like he pushed Tony. “Do you need anything else before I go back to my floor? I’m sure I stink more now than earlier.”
of all people thought we should go together even though he can’t even have a normal conversation with me. Did you know I still don’t know if he likes something as simple as a cheeseburger?” I ramble off in my frustration.
