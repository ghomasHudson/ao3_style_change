“Do you need any help?” She asked. Junior didn’t know if it was the angel genes, or the way that he was feeling, but her voice always sounded melodic, like she was singing every word.
“Come on, it’s getting cold, and I’m getting hungry.” Dean headed back into the tent, and Castiel sat up, still looking at the picture. Dean’s feelings were there on the page, Castiel didn’t feel half as gorgeous as Dean had made him seem in the etching. When Dean left the tent, dressed this time, and began making a fire, Castiel got up and walked into the tent himself, pulling his own clothes - well, Balthazar’s - back on and emerging from the tent still holding the sketchbook, looking at the picture of himself, picking out even more details. It really hadn’t taken Dean long at all and yet it was incredible. Dean put something into the fire and sat beside him on a tree trunk that made for a pretty good bench.
“Luke’s wrong. Dean’s not after your money, or your name. I can tell. I know you worry about those things constantly, but for what it’s worth, I think Dean is genuine in his attraction to you.”
Dean wondered lazily. Castiel felt himself smile, before zapping them back to their bed, and cuddling into his man.
'The baby said that?' Dean seemed more excited suddenly. Had the same thing happened when Faith was a foetus?
'I know, Dean, I heard your prayers.' Castiel looked up at the ceiling as Dean's brow furrowed deeper and deeper into his face.
“So, we’re going to this thing, and we’ll drink way too much champagne and you’ll laugh at me when I eat caviar and hate it, and we’ll keep to ourselves as much as possible.”
Faith forced back a shudder as the two shifters leered at each other, their sharp teeth sticking out past their lips, their faces contorted and half-covered in hair. She hated how familiar they were, with each other and with her.
They finally got sick of the water, the cold of the pool getting to their systems and their kissing no longer able to combat it. Castiel’s mouth felt tender and they settled naked on the rocks beside the pool, although Dean moved again fairly quickly, heading into the tent. Castiel watched him go, but he was back in moments, still completely naked, but holding one of his sketchbooks and a pencil. Castiel watched him, wondering if that was the book he had been caught with that morning.
“We should cremate them, make sure they’re able to travel to the underworld. Hopefully they’ll get to Elysium.” Dean muttered. Castiel nodded, and found two obolus, gently placing them in Sam and Gabriel’s stiff jaws. He used his godly powers to take the bed out of the house with the two on it, and Dean gathered some wood to burn them on. Castiel helped him build the pyre, and prayed to his father, Apollo, to start the fire. Dean fell to his knees as his brother slowly turned to ash, his eyes stinging from tears and from the burn of the smoke. Castiel placed a gentle arm around him, and Dean clung to his immortal lover as the grief took over.
Castiel nodded, and led their way slowly through the bunker, pushing open doors and looking for Dean. Castiel tried to use their connection to find him, but he couldn't sense Dean anywhere. Had that power only been temporary? Gabriel had spoken as though it was going to be a permanent feature in their lives. Maybe it only worked within a certain distance, but he had felt Dean in the bunker while he had been at Sam and Becky's.
a dark horse!” She had an over-pronounced English accent, which was an odd combination with her vernacular. Likewise, her seemingly ethically inspired pottery was at odds with the pants suit she was wearing. Castiel had her pegged in moments as a bored housewife of another politician who had gotten into pottery as something ‘fun’ to do with no real mastery of the craft. He wouldn’t have been surprised if she had bought her slot in this showcase. “Who is this?”
He’s crying too much, he’s making me want to cry. Dammit. Maybe he doesn’t think he can fool the Empty. He has me all over the place, there’s so much to unpick. Too much.
It was something Castiel had already dwelled on. He could have gone over there, could have asked Edith if he’d been in touch, could have done anything other than listen to Meg. He said nothing in reply to Michael, but put his phone in his pocket, and held his knees close together, locking them in place with his hands, curling his toes in the sand.
“Why aren’t you wearing a ring?” Ben persisted, his voice still raised. Dean heard the door open, and knew his mother was there. Possibly with a crowd of his other siblings listening in with all they were worth behind her. Dean pinched the bridge of his nose.
Dean’s eyes looked dark in the pictures. He was gaunt, his cheeks hollowed and only saved from looking skeletal by the dusting of honey-coloured stubble. He seemed uncomfortable, or angry, and Castiel didn’t understand why. He had seemed so good-natured when he had overheard Dean and Benny talking.
After the dinner, people started drifting off, getting ready for the wedding the next day or taking advantage of a few hours to relax before they had to turn in. Castiel was already planning to spend a few hours with Dean before they had to split up for the night, and Claire was looking forward to an evening on her own. Jack stayed by her side as she left the dining hall, and walked with her up to the room.
“Yes. It’s something we discussed. As much as it’s a new relationship, I want to give you some respect, Claire. I know you don’t think I’m capable of that, that you think the worst of me, but I promise you, I’m trying. That’s why I want the day together. You clearly have a lot going on and even if you don’t trust me, or forgive me, I want you to know it doesn’t matter. This is your home now, and I’m your father and I want you to at least be comfortable here until you graduate and go to college.”
affectionate with each other, either. Faith had declared when she was ten and he was twelve that they were going to be together forever and there was a lot they needed to do, so kissing and "gross things like that" could wait. She was too determined to save the world to think about that kind of thing. But Dax knew that being told she wasn't allowed to do it immediately made her want to, just to prove a point.
'So, the angels weren't lying,' a chirpy voice sang, much too loudly for Dean's liking. It was a familiar voice, safe, a voice he missed. He slowly blinked, lowering his arm cautiously, and squinted at the redhead in front of him. 'Hey Deano, are you okay? Sober, right?'
'I know, Princess. I'm not telling you to move on, hell, I'll be happy if you're single forever, but I'm saying you got people to talk to, okay?'
Castiel started calling up the stairs for the both of them, and Jack stood back to let Claire lead the way back down.
“Something happened.” He stated, then took the dish from Claire’s hands, and put it into the oven, before guiding Claire onto a chair. “Talk to me.”
He opened his arms wide, zapping the few feet over to Castiel and pulling him close, kissing along his hairline slowly.
He felt another pair of arms circling his back, and long hair tickling his cheek. Sam was hugging the both of them. More arms and torsos got involved, and soon the entire family were standing there hugging each other. Even Eileen. Even Castiel. They stood for ages like that, hugging each other tightly, each of them waiting for someone else to break away. And then they started peeling off, and Dean was freed. He stepped back from his mother, and then climbed into his car, Castiel sliding into the passenger seat at the same time. He took a moment to look at his family through the windscreen before starting the car and putting it into reverse. Castiel waved as Dean checked the road was clear, and he waved before they pulled away.
Alex moved on to stroking a brush across her eyelids, and Claire felt some of the tension of the day seeping out of her. She relaxed, as Alex moved her face with a cupped hand.
“What if, and I am going to regret this suggestion every day for the rest of my existence, I’m sure. But what if Dean had a Grace too?”
'Too much reading, geek boy. And it's my kid, the one mentioned in those books. I say kid, she looked middle-aged when Castiel killed her.'
“I’m so sorry, Dean. That it came true, that you’ve lost so much. I’m just glad I could save your life, at the very least.”
She pushed the girl out of her way, and ran after Alex, catching up to her in their first lesson together. Alex was at her desk, head in her arms, her shoulders shaking. Claire fell into the chair next to Alex’s.
'I know it's hard to understand, Faith, but there's a reason to everything. You'll see. Personally, I think you did the right thing, but it's not my opinion that matters.'
“Michael, why do I have an email stating that my deal with officials in Cambodia is no longer going through?”
“It’s already got a lot of equipment you might need, Dad left it all there when he bought the island and had us all move in. We can convert it easily.”
He could feel Dean’s eyes boring into him again, could hear the blip in Dean’s thoughts where he was once again caught by Castiel’s true face.
Dean chuckled, his beautiful freckled face filling the camera, his expression tender and borderline dopey.
Eventually, the music started winding down and the guests started leaving. Dean and Castiel bowed out to applause and headed off to their suite, and Kaia threw an arm around Claire and Alex, who had been sitting at a table with Patience as she rubbed her feet.
“You won’t be able to come back from this, Dean. It’ll fuse with your soul, they won’t ever separate again.”
“Close. We have a double date with Devon and his friend Ben. Come to mine after school and we’ll get ready, okay?”
Dax was feeling delirious in the darkened basement. He had spent the hours in solitude straining to use a long-forgotten power he'd unlocked with an old apprentice, but the effort used to work the power was making him lightheaded. Still, he persevered, and after several hours - he'd lost track of how much time had passed, exactly - he'd managed to open the locks with his mind. As they flew open, he flopped forward onto the floor, panting and gripping his head, waiting in tense anticipation of the sound of footsteps on the cement floor, and that total psychopath Sam showing up, torturing him without turning physical, taunting him for Faith's defecting loyalty, for his failed attempt at taking over the bunker.
“I ran into her, and she started pounding on me.” The guy said, not quite meeting Dean in the eye. Now that he wasn’t inches in front of her, Claire could see that it was a senior, one of the boys on the football team. “It was an accident and I was going to apologise and she went pyscho on me!”
Gabriel opened a drawer to the desk, and pulled another chocolate cigar out, biting into it as he shut the drawer. He looked at Dean appraisingly for a while, and then rolled his eyes as though whatever he was thinking was obvious.
She had finally accosted them at a cafe a few blocks from the motel they were staying in, as Sam tucked into a Caesar salad and Castiel posed with a glass of water. She had sat between them, glaring at them through her thick chestnut hair.
Claire retrieved her ball and stood aside for Dean to putt, and noticed a group of kids at the start of the course. She recognised some of them as Alex’s cheerleader and football friends, and instantly looked away. She didn’t want to be recognised out with the principal.
“Which one is he?” Charlie demanded, glowering at Emmanuel. “You never said Castiel had a twin brother.”
Inside the room, there was a man who was definitely pushing fifty, wearing a shirt and tie and tailored slacks, his blazer placed on the back of the chair he was sitting on. He was staring at the screen of a laptop that was practically buried under piles of papers and texts, His chin-length grey hair slicked back out of his eyes. Dax had a sense of foreboding around this guy, but Faith didn't seem to acknowledge him as she headed for Krissy's suitcase, rummaging inside to check on her weapons.
“I get that.” Claire flopped fully on the old bed, stirring up some dust. “Dad and I didn’t get along when I first moved in. But I couldn’t be without him now.”
He was slight compared to the others. His olive skin was at odds with startlingly bright blue eyes, the likes of which Dean had never seen before. He held himself upright, tense, as though he was trying to seem as big as all these other men. There was something in his eagerness that piqued Dean’s interest. He stepped up to fit his armour, and Dean did the same, grateful that none of the other men did so. In fact, they were all laughing at the man, who didn’t quite fill out the bronze chest plate. He held the sword clumsily as he stepped awkwardly into the circle. Dean stood, prepared, and tried to get a read on this man. He didn’t move.
“It might be awful, you’re changing the way your family functions. But I’m here for you every step of the way, and if it’s easier to stay, we can change the plan.”
She could picture what could happen next. The way her hips would snap into Alex’s, her hand under Alex’s top and gliding up to cup a breast. They would maybe roll over, and Alex would take control of this, and they would be dry humping before she knew it. She wasn’t ready. It was already so overwhelming. So as Alex’s hand continued its path, she broke off the kiss and sat up. Alex laid there still, looking up at her.
They walked through the Novak’s mansion, and out of the front door where Kevin was standing beside his limousine. He eyed Meg nervously, before opening the door for them both. Castiel had noticed in the last few days that Kevin had become distant and closed off around him, wary around Meg, and it made him sad to think that the friendship that had been blossoming between the two of them was waning. Meg never seemed to notice, she would step into the car as though Kevin wasn’t even there, and the most Castiel could manage was a sheepish smile before following her in. Kevin shut the door with more force than normal, and drove them in silence, sliding the partition up to give them privacy.
“I don’t know what’s bigger news, the fact that you’re engaged or that Castiel Novak exists in the flesh! When did you get together?”
Castiel was on his feet, trying to get the magazine back from the two of them. They were both shorter than him, but that didn’t mean it would be easy to retrieve it back from them.
'It sounds like the start of a bad joke. What do you get if you cross a lycanthrope with a nephilim?'
“I suppose that Luke had come to the conclusion that it didn’t matter what he said about you, I was too interested to let it get to me. We argued over that dinner about it, about how naive he thought I was being, how I couldn’t see you for what you really were.”
They set up camp once again, in the clearing of a wood. Dean, Garth and Gabriel making the protective sigils as Junior constructed a fire. All four of them insisted that Faith rest, since she was so pregnant, and she sat watching Junior's progress with the fire while they all worked around her. Dean was the first to finish, and sat beside her on her sleeping bag.
'It's a different situation, Dean. That was Father's prediction on the outcome of the actions of his creation and it was other's actions who utilised it as Gospel. This is Him undoing that wrong, His way of forgiving Michael, and Raphael, and maybe even Lucifer if he's willing to listen. This is a solution-'
“I’m pretty sure. I mean, Zachariah raised Adam once … um,” Dean looked shady. Castiel realised they had never had a conversation about John’s other kid. Or kids. Castiel had no idea if there were any more. And Castiel didn’t think that John was aware that Dean knew about Adam.
She refocused on her breakfast, and blanked Dean. Castiel took a cautious seat next to him, and Claire heard the kiss they shared, the way their lips smacked against each other. She ate the rest of her food as fast as she could and went back to her room to throw her shirt on and grab her schoolbag, before reappearing in front of the lovebirds.
“That’s what I was thinking. So, this is my room.” Dean angled the camera, staying in shot but giving Castiel more of a view of the twin beds, the plain green walls, and the sulking younger man in one corner, plugged into headphones and a video game. “And my half-brother, Adam, who’s currently dying in Call of Duty.”
He had come to the kitchen to ask if the vodka was here. He left it with a beer bottle from Meg’s stash in his hand.  This would have to do till the booze came in.
He just placed his hands on Cas’ shoulders, feeling him grind his hips on Dean’s body. His chest muscles were hard under dDan’s hand. His stomach was firm, and—
“I couldn’t take it anymore,” he said, pulling the phone out for the umpteenth time today knowing he will chuck it back in again.
He had seen him, Castiel, last night, when the guy had opened the door to the pizza man. He was wearing blue stripped pajamas, and from where dean was in the living room window, he had a great view of him smiling at something the pizza man said. The porch light on him didn’t help, as it was oddly only falling on Castiel like a spotlight.
“They did,” Cas admitted. As a matter of fact, it was pasted at the very start of this very notebook, but he wasn’t going to say that. “But, I need to know when you are available, because they also told me that you’re not most of the time.”
The book shelf was full now. There were three boxes of old records on it, and in the top shelves were hardbacks. If there was place there, it was reachable by miracle, and the statues looked fragile.
A sob broke out of him, and air escaped from his mouth in the form of bubbles. He watched it go up and then disappeared, just like everything else had. One by one, he had watched everything leave him; escape his grasp and then run away from him as if it was afraid, and then disappear. Poof. Gone. forever.
“We should.” Dean nodded back, still smirking, as he got up and put his book and pen in his flat-top backpack. Then he shouldered it, and gestured for Cas to lead the way.
He closed the doors on everyone, refused to attend calls, talked in short curt sentences, and never reached out to anyone.
“Hold still,” Cas said, before he leaned down, letting Dean’s hands go so that he could brace himself.
“We should go,” Cas nodded, and—he didn’t have any books to pick, or coat to put back on. He just stood there awkwardly, waiting for Dean to get up.
Then he pointed behind Dean, and he turned back to see that one of the pictures on the wall was actually Cas holding a pride flag on a parade.
The severe pain and suffering he had suffered through before and then after sinking to the bottom had all been worth it. He was at peace here. Just like he thought he would be. He didn't have to endure anything anymore.
“At least don’t harm your pretty ones in the process,” he requested, and she laughed and kissed his cheek at that.
I sometimes watch him read stories to Jack before bed. He makes the most silliest of noises, and gives the most accurate expressions, without breaking character even when Jack is cackling beside him. He loves it when his son wears the clothes he bought for him, and he loves to play dress up. Some days, I find them asleep on the floor dressed up in boots and pirate hats, with their sabers beside them as they snore on the floor. He carries Jack to bed, and never forgets to kiss his forehead and whispering “I’m so proud of you”, even when the kid is dead as a rock.
It is in waking up next to him, and finding him gently snoring, his face pressed into the bed because somewhere in the night his pillow fell off it, and now there’s a small circle of drool by his lips. It is in the way his eyebrows shoot up as he inhales sharply when I push gently on his shoulder, and he groans as he yawns and stretches like a cat in the bed. In the end, he finds the most uncomfortable position, mumbles “Cas, you stole my pillow,” and falls back asleep.
With the way his head was still tilted, eye brows touching his hairline, Castiel wasn’t not taking any shit from him anymore. He never really did though.
Dean grabbed Cas’s cock by the base, and took it back into his mouth. He loved the warmth of it in his mouth, and the taste of precum on it. He could feel Cas’ eye on himself as he kept going, taking it a little deeper each time until he felt that he couldn’t anymore. He moved his hand and his mouth like he knew would make a guy feel good, and that made him have to unbutton his jeans and pull his own dick out so that it didn’t suffocate in there.
No, Dean wanted to tell him. If he removed the bag, Dean wouldn't be able to sit here with him anymore.
Together they moved the couch, and tables. They put up Dean’s trophy’s on the new shelf they put up.
His body still would not accept that he wanted to stay. Like everything else in the world, it too was a traitor.
As if it wasn't enough already, they started compressions again, until they pushed so hard that the water which had gone into his lungs started to pour out.
“Mmhmm?” Cas kissed him back, but pulled back to stifle a moan when Dean started moving his hand slowly at first on his shaft.
There he was, the stranger, standing right in front of him. His hair was cut like soldier’s. Or maybe he just liked the look? It suited him very much though. Cas didn’t mind that. His eyes were the colour of fresh spring leaves, and his lips—
“Castiel!” she put his arms around his neck and pulled him down into a hug as soon as the door opened. Then she reached up and ruffled his hair.
Dean grabbed at Cas’ waist and lifted the hem of his shirt up to feel the skin under it. It was warm and soft, and Cas jerked when he dragged his nails up along it.
“Very,” he said, bringing his face close enough for Dean to be able to see himself in Cas’ dark eyes.
It was clean— spick and span— and decorated with posters and artwork. There was a mounted TV opposite to the bed, surrounded by picture frames. Right under it was a low table with a monitor set on a CPU; a gaming computer, Dean realized. There were actually two floor-to-ceiling book shelves, and still there was a stack on the floor because the shelves were full to the brim. The ceiling was filled with glow-in-the-dark stars and planets. The lamp on the night stand glowed blue, dousing the room in cool light.
“Okay,” He nodded, and Cas looked up at him to see the dimples on his cheeks. They looked really good on his smile. Cas wanted to reach up and touch them, see if they were really as deep as they looked like.
“My brother is supposed to come in tomorrow to help me with this stuff,” He looked back at Cas, “Today, he and his girlfriend have stuff to do.”
Once he had something to do, Cas didn’t feel as awkward as he had before. opening boxes and sorting the contents was a part of his day job, and his hands worked on muscle memory. The only problem was that Dean couldn’t decide where exactly he needed what placed.
“Fine, if you insist.” He nodded at him and popped a fry into his mouth which— freaking finally—had ketchup on it.
The guy didn’t show up again, but that didn’t stop Cas from looking, and after the umpteenth time he stopped by the kitchen window on his way to get some water, he went straight for his trench coat and then out the house.
“Cas,” Dean had placed a flower from the bunch on Cas’ ear, “Your eyes are the color of forget-me-nots.”
"Dean!?!" He called again, this time more urgently, and shook him harder. It was like a shock that traveled throughout his body, and in what seemed like hours to him, he felt something.
I’ve found him in the porch at night too, just after dinner, when its getting dark. He goes there to look at the stars. He doesn’t take a blanket with him, so I do that. Sometimes he has miracle with him too, and I find him whispering to the dog about his favourite constellations, and the stories behind them. It’s the mythology ones that he likes. Like the one of Orion, where the goddess of love ran to save him, in the process ending up creating red roses, and then caught him just before he died, and made him into the constellation.
“Can I offer you pancakes, Ellen?” He asked, just to be polite. He had only made three, just enough for himself. He felt a little guilty for feeling glad when Ellen shook her head.
Right now, he felt his body calm down, and the cool air hit him again. He didn’t mind it; it felt like a cherry on top of everything.
He takes Miracle on long walks around the green patch around our house, and I can’t help but fall in love all over again with the goofy little grin on his face when he comes back with the season’s leaves. In spring, he picks a flower from every bush he passes, and then he plays a video on his laptop about how to weave it into a crown. In autumn, he brings back leaves of every shade he can find, and then crush them one by one on the kitchen table, amused by the crunch of it. sometimes, he separates the skeleton of them, and tries that he takes them out whole, so that he can put them in frames. We have three of those in our house now, each with five leaf skeletons on an off-white background.
The fabric— is it fabric when one is talking about a tissue? He didn’t get to think on that to make a decision—was too thin, and Dean could feel the warmth from Cas’ stready hand on his skin. It was like the head of a bonfire in the dead of December.
"I'm really sorry," Cas nodded, "Meg said it wouldn't become big, but it always does and it gets overwhelming for a lot of people. She promised this time, but I guess she didn’t comply."
Dean waited for Cas to say something, but he just looked like he was thinking, even though his brain had refused to work properly.
"You press here," he held his hands, and pressed with his thumb and forefinger between Dean's. His hand was a little rough. Dean wondered what hard labor he did.
He wasn’t, but Dean didn’t know that. He was too busy reading, and Cas definitely wasn’t going to admit that he was staring at him for thirty-five minutes straight.
What? What did he just say? Why did he just say? That could’ve been a thought! Why? Who was trying to drown him in this soda? He wasn’t a fry! Why?!
He just placed his notebook in his lap, and fixed his eyes onto its cover. He wasn’t going to look up. Nope. Not today. Not until Dean got up and left.
He watched the fry dip into the soda in front of him, and then come back out to breathe. But fries didn’t need to breathe, they were, are and always will be non-living, so he dipped it back in, this time a bit more deeper and for longer.
Like when I sit down next to him, he just puts his arm behind me on the back of the couch. I feel his fingers gently stroking my shoulder, or tapping on it lightly—sometimes randomly, sometimes to the beat of the song going on in his head. When we’re watching movies, he doesn’t take the first bite of the popcorn until I have had it. I sometimes joke that he does it because he is checking if I have poisoned them and this way I will go first, but I know it is because he just loves to give me the first bite of everything. He doesn’t sip from anyone’s glass but his own, but I can take his if I want, it's unsaid. When he gets sleepy, he tucks himself into a ball as little as it can be, and puts his head in my lap. Then he takes my hand, and places it over his ear. Not to pat, just to put it there. He finds it comforting.
“Oh,” Cas nodded, eyes still on the boxes. That looked like a lot of things for one person to own, which meant that there was someone moving in with him soon. Cas hoped it was the brother.
“Uh,” Dean smiled awkwardly, and stepped back to show him boxes that were still sitting in the foyer, “Not exactly.”
Oh, Cas nodded. Dean didn’t want to talk about it. That was okay, he wasn’t here to disturb his privacy.
“To get me a drink,” Cas shrugged, “You didn’t get me one, and I am not drinking anything in which Dean Winchester dipped anything.”
He remembered really well the first time he had had to sit in the front in any class. Professor Donatello—Donnie—had summoned him to the front because he was found snoozing off in the back.
Cas didn’t exactly remember how many hours had he spent at Dean’s place. When they had finished the kitchen and the living room were looked beautiful. Cas helped Dean moved things around in the bedroom and put up curtains, but he felt awkward doing anything more than that. He felt like he was invading his privacy, and so he excused himself and said that it was late and he should go.
“Seriously,” she got up, “I’m telling you. Take something to his house, and offer him help with the boxes or whatever. You,” she gestured to his face and then his body, “can make any man gay if you bate your eyelashes.”
As he continued along that wall, he appreciated how the rug in front of the fireplace was worn into a state of comfortable shabbiness. The twin of the leather armchair he’d been enjoying was still stationed by the hearth, a small side table and a big tufted ottoman positioned between them.
“So, uh, this is a little embarrassing, but I haven’t been with anyone since before I moved in because...fuck, I can’t believe I’m telling you this, but…I’ve been kind of hung up on you,” he said haltingly, suddenly finding it too hard to maintain eye contact and having to look away.
It took a few seconds for Dean to work the words up and out, his face sagging into despondent lines as he did. “Like ‘this is your home and we’ll always be your family’, and ‘your grace isn’t as important as you so it doesn’t matter if it’s fading’, and ‘I love you, too, even if I don’t understand it all yet…please don’t leave me—”
Pull his boxers and robe on over his warm, damp skin. Scrub a toothbrush around his fuzzy-feeling mouth; skip the toothpaste because mint wasn’t compatible with whiskey. Rinse, spit, grab a swallow of cold water straight from the tap.
More comfortable than he could ever remember being, Dean decided that letting himself fall asleep out there would be the only thing that could improve the experience.
There was no answer from the other end of the line, but he could hear Gabriel breathing, so he knew the call hadn’t dropped.
Dean figured only an idiot wouldn’t take the advice he was just given, and clapped his hands loudly before accepting the beer without looking at Gabriel. “If it tastes half as good as it smells, you’re gonna give me a run for my title as king of the kitchen.”
“No! I didn’t…I didn’t mean like that, ok? He hasn’t ever had that normal life he’s always wanted, you know? I want that for him, for him to have his own life, but I couldn’t rest easy here for decades knowing that he’s down there all by himself.”
“Sam helped me reorganize my priorities,” he said simply. “He’ll be ok, I know that now. Besides, I figured if I was poofing my ass back up here to be with you, then that meant Jack could offer Eileen the chance to go back down, if she wanted.”
Cas didn’t say anything, but he hadn’t turned away either. Dean reached carefully for his shoulder; let his hand run down Cas’ arm. He didn’t shrug him off so Dean decided to push his luck and curled his fingers around Cas’ damp palm.
“Wouldn’t dream of it.” Dean watched him go, his heart in his throat before turning to Jack. “Here’s what I’d like to do...”
. Now that they knew Jack was the new God, Sam wanted to strategize and make plans and mount a rescue mission to retrieve Cas from the clutches of the Empty… But Dean just...couldn’t.
“I can’t feel him,” Jack replied vaguely, shaking his head as his eyes cleared and focused back on Dean, a little frown forming between his eyebrows. “That’s not right. I should be able to feel him, even if he’s resting.”
” Dean cleared his throat and took another swallow, fingers tightening around the smooth ceramic. “All kinds of crazy stuff, y’know? That—”
They had danced a bit after finishing their drinks, and the sensation of lean, firm angles under his tentative hands, so different from the soft give of female curves, sent electricity bolting through him. If felt like hours later when they stumbled out back for a smoke break, Dean only pretending to inhale, carefully adjusting the cigarette in his fingers to hang as casually as Cory was holding his.
By the time Gabriel realized the coast was clear and appeared in the doorway, Cas already had a duffel bag open on the bed.
“Work smarter, not harder,” Dean countered, but then leaned forward, bracing his arms on the tabletop. “Cas…can we talk?”
“Bobby,” Dean breathed. He almost didn’t turn around, hope warring with doubt, but the lure proved too strong.
“What the fuck is going on?” he growled, still looking for a threat. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Sam’s face go slack with shock as he answered the call.
“Anna’s forever asking me to come spend some time out at her place. It’s away from here, on a lake…peaceful. I figure this is as good a time as any.”
In between his periodic attempts at playing Dr. Phil, Sam kept busy driving Dean crazy. He was grieving, too, of
Temper edged in despite his best efforts to keep his cool. “Seriously? That time we were in Cornwall and there was a gay couple kissing in front of us and you called them gross? I think that made it pretty fucking clear how you feel.”
It took him a couple of deep breaths to feel steady enough to turn off the hazards and pull back onto the road, but once the tires were humming along again, wind whipping through the car from the open windows, he found himself smiling.
“Hey kid,” Dean returned, chuckling as Sadie popped up and bolted over to Jack, tail wagging a million miles a minute. “Traitor.”
It looked like how Dean remembered feeling when he and Sammy had ended up in Silverthorne, Colorado. You could take as many deep breaths as you wanted but the lack of oxygen at that elevation just kept you feeling half suffocated until you eventually adjusted.
It was the wrong thing to say, and he knew it as soon as the last word left his mouth. Cas jerked next to him, his breath hitching. Dean didn’t want to look at him, but he forced himself to, lashed himself with guilt at the pain he saw etched into the furrows across Cas’ brow. His lashes were down tight on his cheeks, wet and clumped with tears.
He was stupidly excited about the trip since he actually had a decent-sized pantry for once, and he had
“Believe me, I ask myself that all the time.” He reminded himself to go easy on the snark; in his experience it didn’t tend to go over well with temperamental ancient beings who held his best friend’s existence in their hands.
Muscles eventually shifted under his cheek as Cas pulled his head back to press a kiss to Dean’s cheek. The sweetness of the gesture made him ache more.
Cas took a half step back as Dean got closer. Taking the hint, Dean stopped short, digging his fingers into his thighs to keep from reaching for him.
Dean neatly dodged the wooden spoon that came flying past him as he stepped into the kitchen, laughing as Gabe yelped behind him when it hit its intended target.
The absurdity of Gabe’s misguided attempt at comfort forced a jittery chuckle out of him, even in his misery. He wouldn’t put it past Gabriel to have friends with “connections”, but he was (mostly) sure Gabe was kidding.
Dean stretched his arms and back up until they burned, feeling indulgent in all the best ways as he let himself flop back loosely into what had become
Maybe that was why they were still here, broken so many times, but still fighting, still putting their hearts out there and caring about the people they met and befriended and loved and lost. Because that was what humans did, didn’t they? Kept going, one shaky step in front of the other even when it made no sense, even when it seemed hopeless?
Dean nodded and gestured at the closet that was nearly hidden behind the room’s door. “There’s a huge closet so you should be ok, and I even stuck a little dresser in there for your big-boy Spiderman underwear and stuff.”
“But I do,” he said. His heart leapt joyfully at how easy it was to say the words. “I love you, too.”
There was still one work order left for a brake service on a Ford Focus, but Bobby snatched it out from under Dean’s nose, waving him off with a gruff “Go spend some time with your brother”.
He had had so few opportunities to just sit and watch Cas like this. It was remarkable really, how rarely he’d been able to catch Cas looking so…peaceful, almost soft. No furrowed brow, no squint, no contemplative look or worried expression pinching his features. He looked a decade younger.
he could do, about any it, and he smothered the intense urge to just rest his head on Baby’s steering wheel and never get up again.
Taking the bait, Dean flashed him a teasing grin. “Well, yeah, that’s because I actually showered for once.”
“So I’m the last hurrah of a dying plant is what you’re saying?” he teased, tightening his arms when Cas glared and tried to wriggle free, pretending to be offended and failing miserably. “We
to listen—” Cas was looking less nervous and more worried now, his hands starting to twist together.
, I am!” Dean crowed. “Of course I’m free, this is a serious matter regarding your sad lack of proper media education. I can’t believe Gabe never made you watch it.”
Closing his eyes, Dean shivered a little as Cas’ now familiar voice sent a very pleasant chill down his spine.
Nose tickling from the dust stirred up by their entrance, he sneezed once and then again, breaking him out of his reverie. The third one wanted to come, he could feel it, but it lurked contrarily in his sinuses just out of reach. Scrubbing irritably at his nose, he made his way toward the interior door, leaving behind the gasoline-and-oil-scented haven of classic beauty for the more neutral filtered air of the bunker.
“He made a deal to save you,” Dean said bluntly. “He traded his life for yours, but no way he would have gone back there otherwise.”
for the meals he wanted to cook with all of that beautiful counter space at his disposal. There were a couple of big-deal swanky markets nearby that he planned to hit up over the next few weeks, but for a basic stock-up run there was nothing quite as handy as a local chain grocery store.
It involved a tricky splicing of two different spells that Sam had managed to dig up, supported with a cornucopia of extremely rare ingredients, and enhanced with the blood of the most powerful being in existence.
Following that meeting he was whisked away to St. Charles for his second public appearance. While the crowd outside was loud and raucous, once alone inside the church the silence was even more deafening than the crowd.
“I guess you’re right, he does have a point.” Ellen gave in. “But he still needs to see someone. I can’t help him as much as an actual doctor. It’s been some time since I had Jo and medicine has changed plenty since then. Not to mention that my experience can only help so far since I’m obviously not a carrier.”

“I know you have gotten close with my little brother, Castiel. And I know that Anna warned your friend of his arrival. I’m just here to make sure that nothing….” Michael pursed his lips in thought, “….unfortunate happens.”
Dean leaned forward and met Cas’s lips. It was one of the best kisses Cas had ever had. He wrapped his arms around Dean’s middle and fell into the kiss. A few minutes into making out, Dean opened his eyes and found Cas’s shit, lost in their kiss. He smiled and continued with his ministrations.
About a week and a half later they were playing video games off their little TV in their dorm room when Cas randomly asked “So do people bow to you and stuff?”
“Yes, she was very glad that he wasn’t a fake profile. She probably would have done something stupid and spiteful if Dean hadn’t been who he said he was.” Cas said. He said it with a smile, but his eyes showed a little bit of nervousness which implied that he was incredibly serious about Meg’s vengeful spirit.
selected books that Cas should check out for himself. He was currently halfway through Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
“Dean Winchester, it is in your best interest to remain still and we can both be on our way.” Will said. His face looked stony and devoid of any emotion, despite the fact that minutes before he was blushing and smiling and now he was trapping another teenager in the car and slowly choking the life out of him.
John Winchester was not the type of man the royal family would have picked out for Princess Mary. In fact, her father had thrown a bit of a fit when she had announced to him her intentions to marry.
Cas played with his fingers and just when Dean was going to cave and let Cas keep whatever was bothering him to himself Cas spoke up.
“So I do have a few questions, maybe we could go inside and have a seat? Talk about some stuff?” Gabe suggested. Dean and Cas agreed and they all headed into the house.
“You mean Sioux Falls? I was not aware that alcohol impacted residency.” Castiel said, seemingly curious.
“Um. Usually only for formal events and stuff. And even then it’s mostly just helping them put on a jacket and handing them things. Except for the women. They usually have dressers to help them zip…and stuff.” Dean said, his throat feeling scratchy. “Dude, did we-?”
“Yes, I am aware of that. I remember being in the woods but I was unsure how I got there. I found myself drawn towards the Roadhouse and when I explained myself to Ellen and requested assistance she was more than obliging. I owe her a great deal.”
Cas loved kissing. Like, he really loved kissing a lot and Dean was happy to oblige, whether it was on the couch, the back of a movie theatre, or pressed up against the car. The nice thing about Cas was that he wasn’t pushing for anything beyond kissing just yet. After three weeks of dating it’s something that most dates would expect. But Dean found himself thankful that Cas was clearly satisfied with where they were, because Dean wasn’t sure he was quite ready to go any further and frankly didn’t want to have to explain himself.
“Well I don’t. I have a…thing.” Dean said. “But listen, you take care of yourself, ok? Don’t be afraid to call Bobby if you need something.”
“Well like I said, it’s still up in the air whether I’ll even see my coronation so don’t resign yourself just yet.”
“Cas, I would call this a very successful date.” Dean said, smiling. Cas visible relaxed in relief leaned into Dean’s hand on his cheek. Dean leaned forward and gave Cas a kiss, letting himself linger in the moment for a bit before leaning back and removing his hand.
He could always get rid of it. But that thought stings more than leaving his baby in some random town, hoping that it ends up with a nice family. Dean leans his hip against the cracked bathroom counter, his head spinning with all of his thoughts. He wants the baby, but knows he can’t have it. He can’t give the baby up because it would just haunt him. But how could he tell his father?
But Dean eventually decided that that was a problem for Future Dean to deal with. Present Day Dean still had a massive burger to finish. He turned his attention back to his burger and tried to pick up on the conversation that Bobby and Ellen had been having during his little space-out session.
successfully rule the kingdom after his passing. They did not anticipate that this would be for some time yet but Samuel did not presume to live forever. Nor was he ignorant to how fickle life could be and he did not want to pass suddenly and leave the country in the hands of his son without proper preparation.
Suddenly the jovial atmosphere in the room vanished. Dean rubbed his palms into his eyes and turned around.
Yup. That was a cold-hearted murderer sitting across from him. He smiled and reached out to stop Cas’s fidgeting.
“Marv.” Crowley said, wincing internally. “As I was saying, it is a grand statement to seek to petition the High Council for legitimacy of the throne. I encourage you to carefully consider before submitting. It is an arduous process and there is a lot of red tape, not to mention the publicity.”
Another few weeks had passed and Dean was fully into his sixth month. He and Ellen had plans to go visit Dr. Carmichael again within another week and Dean was currently reading up on things in Cas’s room at the Roadhouse. They were lounging on the couch together (Well, Cas was sitting, but Dean had taken the liberty of sprawling across the couch and plopping his feet in Cas’s lap) and Dean had a baby book propped open on his belly. Cas had taken to checking out baby books for Dean from the library while Dean
He hadn’t actually said the word “date” when he spoke to Will but he was pretty sure he got the gist. But then he had shown up with a few other friends to hit up the horror flick showing at the movie theater and Dean wasn’t so sure.
“Hey,” he said quietly, eyes flicking from Gabriel to Cas still huddled on the floor. “Can we— can we talk?”
When he had pulled out his phone to show the pictures to Sam, Sam had broken the vital social contract of Thou Shalt Not Scroll Through Someone Else’s Camera Roll and had landed on a picture taken at a party a few weeks earlier.
He had tried to hold it together for Sammy while it was happening, said the things he knew his younger brother needed to hear, but
They ate in companionable silence, and Dean lazily waved his hand to clear everything away when they both pushed their plates back with matching sighs of contentment.
Dean was still chuckling drunkenly when Sam finished cleaning his brother’s busted knuckles and slapped a fresh washcloth into his hand.
Desperation pressed in on all sides in defiance of the perfectly hot and sunny afternoon that was just begging for a cold beer on a shady porch. “Bobby…I can’t, I have to go find—”
“Yeah,” Dean said, wanting nothing more than for Sam to be three again, crying over a scraped knee that Dean could fix with a band aid and a promise to play with him on the swing set at the local park after dinner.
His finger slipped as he went to press Play, aroused all over again by the idea of getting to make out with Cas on his couch, the thought of being able to take all the time they wanted without fear of interruption. There was no fighting the full body shudder that rippled through him involuntarily at the thought. Cas’ low chuckle of acknowledgement only served to set off a second one and Dean cursed under his breath, finally managing to hit the right buttons to get the movie playing.
Fuck, he was tired. It wasn’t even so much bodily fatigue as he felt drained right down to the cellular level, like his very soul was running on fumes. It had been like that for a while, but he had always been able to bounce back from it before.
“You spent all this time with a girlfriend named Cassie who doesn’t exist. Now Sam is here, and at some point he’s going to ask about her. What happens when he does?”
Dean was instantly curious, but headed up to his place where at least there would be no Gabriel or his innuendoes to make him squirm. He left the inside door open for Cas at the top of the stairs, kicking off his shoes and hanging up his coat.
Sam pushed himself away to roughly scrub his hands over his face, staring into a mirror with his palms framing his cheeks. Had he said enough? Had he said too much?
Or the one after that, where Dean had pulled Cas in for a kiss. They weren’t quite centered in the frame anymore and the focus had gone a bit wonky, but it was one of Dean’s favourites because he got to see just a hint of what he looked like in love.
A lady with perfectly shaped silver curls and bright purple-framed lenses was walking something small and yappy-looking, its tiny legs churning to keep pace with her.
, eyes flicking to the space next to Dean, then up to his face. The way his entire body instantly strained towards Dean’s telegraphed want in every line, but there was still a wariness to his expression that made Dean’s stomach hurt.
“Asses aside,” he continued with a little snigger, hands finding their way under the hem of the long-sleeved t-shirt Cas was wearing and onto the warm skin beneath, “your metaphor of me as a giant plant covered in fuck-you flowers is kind of, hmm…cute.”
He didn’t bat an eye at the sight of Cas in dark jeans and a t-shirt, although Dean was having a hell of a time keeping his eyes off of Cas’ arms and chest, and ok, maybe his ass, too. Who knew he’d been hiding all that under his frumpy clothes all these years?!
Shaking his head in exasperation, Sam crossed his arms and leaned back against the stove. “You’re not thirty anymore, you know. You’re lucky to have gotten away with that train wreck of a diet for as long as you have.”
Like someone cut his strings, Cas couldn’t stand up one second longer. His butt hit the floor a little harder than he’d planned, but at least the jolt of pain was tangible. He sucked in a steadying breath and then another, pulling his knees protectively up towards the gaping crater in his chest.
“Yeah. Right. I’ll just…” He thumbed towards the door, blundering out after a brief struggle with the lock.
“Stunning,” he added as a final burst of inspiration struck, sucking in a sharp breath when Cas’ hips pushed forward.
That ended up being his first kiss with another guy, the tang of smoke still on his tongue. It hadn’t been a great kiss—too much tongue and not particularly skilled on Cory’s part—but it served to settle one more piece of his sexuality puzzle into place.**
After finally ending their hug to end all hugs, they had—a bit awkwardly—mopped themselves up, exchanging a few tentative looks and little self-conscious grins, and then Dean had dragged Cas along with him on an exploratory tour of the house that Jack had built him; he wasn’t going to let that damn angel out of his sight for a good long while.
It was…well, a bit weird. Instead of the soft edges he was used to, narrow shoulders that would instinctively turned in towards him with heads that knew how to tuck in under his chin, Cas was a whole ‘nother ball game.
A sudden, awful thought occurred to Cas. “You…killed yourself?” His entire being felt cold, slick and oily with nausea at the thought of Dean—
He sighed, relief swelling for a second followed by the immediate hard sock to the gut when he realized that he was going to have to say something about why he was showing up alone.
“Please,” he blurted, and could have kicked himself. Like any of these cosmic dickbags gave two shits about things like empathy…or love. He hurried to pull free the empty vial that had held Jack’s blood from his pocket.
By the time he pulled into the gravel lot behind the garage, like every other day that had come before, there was still no obvious solution. He leaned his forehead against the steering wheel between his hands and sent up a plea to a deity he didn’t even believe in anymore.
Dean knew his flush made him an easy target for further teasing, but then he caught sight of Cas popping out of the kitchen doorway further down the hall, shaking his head ruefully.
The next moment came a few months later. Sam, who had thrown himself into processing his grief with the intensity he had formerly reserved for researching monsters, had been making progress of his own on an entirely different project; re-establishing contact with the extended hunter network.
The weight of guilt settled in Dean’s stomach; it ached and he had to fight the reflexive wince, pushing into Cas’ space to press his lying lips to Cas’ beautifully honest face. He had no idea how he’d let his lie to Sam about Cas get as far as it had, but he was starting to see cracks spidering out in all directions over the past few months of otherwise near-perfection.
There was still humour in the voice that wrapped around and through him, but like a steel blade concealed behind a silk curtain, there was menace there now, too.
Dean shoved up to his feet and stalked over to the French doors that led onto the deck, popping one open to get some fresh air, his stomach churning around the breakfast that had left him feeling pleasantly full a few minutes before.
First, Sam’s expression brightened at the idea of a night out, then it sobered a little when he realized that Dean wanted to go to a bar, flashed disappointment for a second and finally settled on stoic as he opened his mouth to—
“No!” Dean thankfully looked as horrified as Cas felt. “No, no, nothing like that. I fucked up on a hunt, man. Basic vamp job, a hunter on training wheels could’ve handled it.” He shook his head. “It was just…yeah, a stupid piece of rebar sticking out of the wall, you know? A thousand and one ways to die and I fell right onto that instead.”
They moved easily around each other; Dean plated up their breakfast while Cas grabbed utensils and topped up their coffees.
He knew he could be a dumbass sometimes, but never say that Dean Winchester couldn’t rise to the occasion when such an unexpected opportunity was dropped, perfectly wrapped with one of those fancy curly bows and a tag with his name on it, right into his lap.
Gabriel pushed to his feet with a heavy sigh. “You really screwed the pooch on this one, you know that? I haven’t seen him like that before.” He gestured towards the kitchen. “I’m making coffee, and if you level with me about what the hell happened here, I won’t even spit in it.”
Fighting--and losing--the battle with a bright blush, Dean ducked his head at the praise. “Glad you like it. It’s the homemade dough, makes all the difference.”
“Is your brother a total weirdo or something? Gonna creep up here in the middle of the night and watch me sleep?” Dean could just about picture it, waking up all disoriented to some furtive shadow hovering in the corner of his bedroom. But honestly, that nice of an apartment for that low of a price? He had to admit it wouldn’t necessarily be a deal breaker. Dean
Despite never having even seriously considered a relationship with another guy before, Dean was happier than he could remember being. It wasn’t as weird or as hard as he’d thought it might be, merging two peoples’ lives together. The empty nightstands on the previously unused side of his bed and various other surfaces were slowly starting to accumulate Cas’ odds and ends. Cas’ scrubs and boxers were slowly mixing in with his own t-shirts and boxer-briefs in the laundry hamper. Invitations from friends to one of them now automatically included the other. Gabriel was forever rolling his eyes and gagging when he saw them being domestic together, even though his little grins when he thought they weren’t looking told a different story.
“I might have gone a little overboard,” he commented as the containers started to stack up. “I forgot to eat lunch today. You know what they say about not shopping when you’re hungry? That should probably apply to ordering off Uber Eats, too.”
Dean huffed, annoyance and worry battling it out. “Yeah, I know, I’m a grade-A bastard who deserves to suffer. Trust me, I’m already in hell over here and if I have to worry that Cas is out there on his own all fucked up over this—”
“I’m sorry,” Dean whispered helplessly, digging his nails into his palms until it stung. “I’m so sorry, Cas. You deserve so much better than the fucking mess I made of things.” He closed his eyes as his own tears finally crested, spilling hot trails down his face.
“Nah,” he scoffed lightly, twisting to get an arm bracketed on either side of Cas’ hips, carefully nudging the battered book down with his chin. “Just Sammy.”
had to try to get through to him before he did serious damage. He was the only one left who might even have a chance.
Dean was deeply asleep, slumped forward onto the bed by Cas’ legs, snoring. It gave Cas a chance to look around the unfamiliar room. It appeared to be some kind of luxurious-yet-quaint cabin, right down to the fancy memory foam mattress under him and the checkered blanket over him.
“Fine.” The word was as sharp as the angles of the k-turn Dean pulled to get them out of the parking lot, setting the Impala on a course back to the bunker.
But Dean was gone in another rush of air, leaving Sam to pull his phone out of his pocket and examine it like it might hold the answer. After a few seconds of staring at it, he set it on the seat next to him and turned forward, bracing his hands on the wheel.
“I’m gonna be honest,” he said, leveling Gabriel with a skeptical look. “It sounds too good to be true for the price you’re asking.”
After lingering a few more seconds, hearing the animated rise and fall of voices on the other side, fading as Dean presumably showed Sam to his room, Cas headed down the stairs to his own apartment to try and keep his brain from cannibalizing itself until Dean showed up to explain what the hell all that had been.
Cas was worried. He was so worried that he did what any sane person would do and took refuge in the book that he was reading that week. But even Whitman’s unconventional free verse wasn’t enough to fully distract him, one ear constantly tuned to the sounds of Dean showering.
Sam’s shoulders slumped. “It was actually all a misunderstanding,” he said quietly. His fingers pinched restlessly at the hem of his shorts, gathering up a little pleat before smoothing it down. “He thought I wouldn’t be ok with him and Cas, and…yeah. What a fucking mess.”
Her smile was entirely too understanding. “It’s all over your face that you’re looking to forget someone, but I figured I’d take a shot anyways. It was worth a try.”
“Yeah, Bobby called him last week and was bugging him about coming to stay with him for a few months to see if he liked the area.”
He heard Cas’ huff as he grabbed a clean towel out of the linen closet since Cas had almost certainly used his.
Dean had made the effort to look right at Cas while he asked, so he saw Cas’ eyes widen minutely. He also caught the way they slid away guiltily for a fraction of a second before he snapped them back to Dean’s, his lips already parting around what Dean knew was a lie.
“Yeah, not Jack’s ringtone, I know,” Sam snapped, working the phone out of his jeans as Dean moved to provide cover.
Dean wanted nothing more than to drag Cas back into the rumpled bed behind him and pull the puffy duvet they had bought for the colder winter nights over their heads, confess his terrible mistake in the safety of Cas’ arms and be forgiven. Instead, he tossed his phone aside like his heart wasn’t aching and went to dig out a pair of clean socks.
Smiling, Dean let his eyes close and turned his face inwards a bit more. Yeah, he still had no friggin’ idea what he was doing, but hey, neither did Cas. They’d figure it out eventually, the right way, the wrong way, or the Winchester way, but they’d get there.
Dean had started to claw clumsily at the back of Sam’s hand, so he let go and switched his grip to Dean’s plaid-covered shoulders instead. He knew if there was any chance at all to finally get Dean to see some sense he absolutely couldn’t let him leave.
Annoyed at himself for being the source of the caution with which Cas approached him, Dean let his arm and its accompanying swath of cozy fabric wrap around Cas’ far shoulder. He had been an idiot about this...
Dean just stared at him, his eyes wide with surprise, but also with hope. Sam knew that he was right to refuse, despite the lonely times that would lie ahead of him. Dean had given him everything he could since the day their mom had died, right up to going to hell to save him. He was long past due to give his brother back even a tiny portion of the sacrifices Dean had made for him over the years.
She came on strong, which Dean had always liked. He made sure he didn’t ditch Sammy, though, playing through a few more rounds of darts and a couple of pool games with no intent to hustle anything this close to home. After a while Sam ended up in a friendly competition with a few locals, and Dean eased off to the sidelines much to the delight of the blonde who introduced herself as Alice.
Dean didn’t mean to tune his brother out, he really didn’t, but honestly he didn’t really care about the philosophical why of it all. His field of fucks was as empty as his toolkit of healthy coping strategies. His fingers brushed over the lump of his traitorously silent phone in his pocket.
Dean tumbled out of the rift…thingy, Cas’ weight slumping heavier and heavier against his side, already yelling for—
Cas had made it clear early on that he wasn’t interested in living in the closet. The only way Dean could avoid telling Sam was if Cas agreed to live a lie. Even if Dean could choke down his disgust with himself long enough to even suggest that to Cas, he knew himself well enough to know that he’d never be able to handle knowing that he was the one who had done that to Cas. Even if Cas agreed, Dean knew it would be the beginning of the end for them.
His wobbly knees decided that the steps down into the kitchen were as far as he was going to go after his pit stop at the bathroom. He was still sitting there, miserably coffee-less, holding the sides of his throbbing skull and trying to decide if he was actually desperate enough to crawl the last few steps to the black gold. He had just determined that he was when Sam’s voice came from around the doorframe behind him.
Nabbing a spot near a tree that would guarantee them a little extra breathing room, they unloaded the trunk and set themselves up. Dean twisted open his forty, dropping the cap into the bottom of the paper bag and taking a long swallow.
I would like to thank cottoncandyofterror for their stunning comic depicting Cas in the Empty that inspired this chapter. This was actually the first chapter I wrote for this fic, and built the rest of the story up around it, so thank you thank you thank you; I wouldn't have written this fic without your art to get the ball rolling!
Dean had been kind of casually suicidal for most of his life; he knew in his bones that it wouldn’t take much more at this point to nudge him over the edge, and he couldn’t bear the idea of leaving Sam to deal with the aftermath of that.
rocking chair on their front porch. Sadie, their black lab, lifted her head, and when she saw he wasn’t going anywhere, flopped back onto her side with a contented sigh.
“Amazing.” Dean interrupted hurriedly. He pressed a kiss to Cas’ crinkled nose, his voice losing its teasing lilt as he pulled back to meet that incredible gaze.
Castiel looked up at him, his gaze flickering away briefly before he licked his lips, picking at the edge of the label. “We, uh, we usually watch the game together, Gabriel and I, if you, you know, wanted to join us for the season opener tomorrow.”
Holding up his hand to forestall the questions he knew Sam had been building up, he shook his head, carefully not making eye contact. If one ounce of the grief Sam had to be feeling about Eileen or any of it showed on his face, the face that in Dean’s mind was perpetually six, freckled and round with baby fat…yeah, that would crack his composure like an eggshell.
The leather armchair next to the bed sighed gently as he plopped back down, unsettled for reasons he still didn’t feel like examining too closely. Heaving a sigh of his own, he noticed that his beer was empty, so he tried glaring at it. It refilled itself, just as crisp and cold and yeasty as the first sip of the previous one had been.
to live like that-- made his skin crawl, but it wasn’t as awful as the other option he’d been considering, which involved ending things with Cas, telling Sam that things with “Cassie” hadn’t worked out, and doing everything in his power to keep either of them from ever finding out.
Sam hadn’t said anything when Dean moved his private bedroom stash to the kitchen booze cupboard and switched out his usual evening whiskey or three for a coffee. Lots of coffee. But when they ran out of coffee ahead of a scheduled grocery run, the wattage of Sam’s triumphant grin when Dean grudgingly (and not at all desperately) asked how long “you hippy leaf-lovers” let tea steep could have powered a small city for a week.
Dean sternly ordered his dick to stand down, clenching his fists and stretching out his fingers a few times to see if he could redirect some blood flow. When that didn’t really work, he tried to distract himself instead.
Dean wasn’t stupid. He knew his brother had questions, but he also knew he was in no shape to answer any of them for a while. Preemptive strike it was then.
Cracking up at Cas’ straight-faced delivery, Dean flopped back onto the sofa, claiming his usual corner and stretching his legs out to put his feet up on the coffee table. Before Cas tucked himself into the other corner, he nodded over to where a fresh beer had replaced Dean’s empty.
It ached, the name bringing back up the memory of Sam’s bland interaction with him, no idea why his brother’s landlord was up in his apartment, no idea who Cas was to Dean
Sam leaned back against the sink. There was nothing comforting for him to say; Dean wasn’t wrong. So he did the only thing he could, and bore silent witness to his brother’s stunned anguish as it ripped out of him in wet, choked gasps that seemed to go on forever.
He wasn’t expecting a full Sam Winchester eye roll from Cas, but he got one anyways. “Of course. Knowing you and Sam will have each other will be enough for me for now.”
Dean looked up from where he was slouched down against the arm of his couch, tablet braced against his updrawn knees. “You don’t say.”
“I—” he cleared his parched throat “—I live across the street,” he gestured back to his house, “and I saw you moved in, so I thought I should welcome you.”
“If you don’t want it, you can get something else for yourself.” he commented once he had sucked the ketchup pf the fry thrice, and then dipped it into soda.
Dean sat up on the bed, faster than he thought he could. He was pretty sure that came off as too eager, but that didn’t matter because there wasn’t an announce of lies there. Dean really wanted to kiss Cas upright.
Cas had shared a cup with him many times—in fact, at this point they both just picked each other’s cups and didn’t have to ask first.
“I was talking to them,” he explained, picking up another fry, “and they were talking too, but not to me. And then they talked and I wasn’t talking. And then they didn’t notice when I wasn’t talking, and then they didn’t see anything at all when I left.”
Did he cross a line? He must’ve. Because Cas just stared at him, his mouth open and eyes wide. He was not expecting that to happen.
“Sorry doesn’t make up for the fries that got eaten without ketchup.” He told him, as he walked around the table and took his seat across from Dean.
He put his head in his hands, and rubbed his temples with his fingers, taking deep breaths. These were the times he wished he had a mantra.
“Same.” He nodded, deciding that he didn’t want to go clean up just yet. He wanted to soak in what tranquility the room and Cas’ embrace offered a little longer.
Three people bumped into them on their way in, and Dean pulled his ear away from Meg’s mouth as she yelled at them to be civil.
It was like he was reading the comments section of a YouTube video, and they both did that quite frequently when they were hanging out. They would randomly pick something on Dean’s dash, and the go to the comment section. It was fun, people were funny when they wanted to be.
“Hey Dean,” she greeted him by throwing her arms around him. With her height, Dean had to hold her hips so that she didn’t fall off him. “I like you.”
“Aye, boy!” Cas turned to see Dean grin as he put his cup down just when the dog jumped into his lap.
“Look up,” His voice was a whisper, but there was something in it that made Dean tear his eyes away from Cas’ face and turn them to the ceiling.
“Dean,” Cas put his elbows on his knees and leaned forward, tilting his head a little, “you texted me—and I quote—I have fries, bring ketchup, third bench, café. I had a class with Professor Donatello in—” he paused to pull his phone out of his pocket, and check the time— “five minutes ago, which I am missing because I’m here.”
It wasn’t in his plans either— it may have been in the plans subconsciously when he was on his way to the venue, but it was chucked out when he had stepped in. The plan after that was to get drunk and dance to forget whatever day and month it was, and then heavens knew what.
“He’s the one who’s actually excited about the move,” Dean laughed, “This is his place, I’ll just be living in it.”
The color of forget-me-nots, he remembered having said once. That was so long ago, that he barely remembered where exactly that was. he was just a kid then. Not even in his teens. All he remembered was the kid he was with, and the bunch of flowers in Dean’s hands which they had just plucked.
So he actually did not know that there were that many people downstairs. He was up here, chilling in his room in red pajama bottoms and a t-shirt while Meg screamed at people downstairs.
That’s when it occurred to Dean. He pulled his head back to ask Cas if he wanted that, but he seemed a little busy grinding his hips into Dean’s hand, looking like he was getting close to climax.
By the looks of it, he may or may not have only taken out the stuff he needed at the moment, and then had left the rest.
Its fate was in his hands right now, and he could do what ever he wanted with it. He could drop it in the drink and it would drown in it because in that case, it would only come out when Dean would finish all of it. He could put it back in the plate and it would never get a drink of sugary bliss again. Or he could put it in his mouth and torture it with his teeth before removing its existence from everywhere.
He had never done this before, because, until a while ago, he couldn’t hold anything in his mouth. He knew how it worked, because he had been on the receiving end many times, but this was the first time he was about to give someone a blowjob. He didn’t know how bad he could do, but he knew that it wouldn’t be very very.
“Oh,” Cas uncapped his pen, diverting his attention towards it, “I need to know how much have you covered.”
Being the type of kid that he was, he knew how to pick locks with bobby pins. He’d learned that on the internet, and then had tried it on every door he came across until the art was perfected. So when he found the one and only door that was locked, he went to borrow a pin from the bathroom.
Cas was gay, dean realized, and he was shocked that he hadn't thought that before.  Meg wasn't lying when she said that Cas was just a friend. Dean didn't know if that made him blind or dumb.
He was. The headache would go away in half an hour, like it always did. He just needed to rest a little. Maybe lay back, and stare at the ceiling. Listen to some calming ASMR.
He melted into Cas, as he deepened the kiss. He had abandoned all thoughts of feeling this good today, but here he was, holding onto Cas’ shoulders kissing back with the same intensity he was. Dean didn’t want it to stop just yet. Which was why, when Cas pulled back to ask, “Dean, are you sure you want this?”
“That’s it.” He shook his head at Dean and put his hands over his head again, “If you bring then down,” he growled low, “I will make sure you don’t.”

“You should really sort those boxes out,” he hid his face behind his cup, “before it happens again.”
He didn't need to tell the fry anything at all. Why was he wearing makeup? Why didn’t he wear his jacket today? Why did his jeans have a tear on one knee? Why was he wearing a LOTR fandom shirt? Why was he alone? Why was the sky blue? What did one wall say to the other? Why was his phone so annoying?
But that wouldn’t exactly remove its existence. Dean would remember it being there in his hand because it kept him company while he sat here on the uncomfortable bench in the cafeteria.
The problem was that Cas was as gay as a moth was for a flame. He had watched Dean—whenever he was present—casually stroll into the classes the two had in common, and had found himself staring at his every move, until the bell rung and he got up, once again walking to the door like he was in a park. The guy scribbled notes, and Cas itched to pass by him to see what he was writing. When the teachers asked Dean any questions, Cas would drop whatever he was doing to listen to what he had to say.
"I'm sorry." Cas let go of his arm, and sat down on the bed with him. "I didn't mean to startle you; I was just shocked to see someone in my room."
Under the water, everything was his favourite color; the one of vast oceans and clear skies, glowing in the whatever moonlight filtered onto the pool from the skylight.
Uhhh… Cas thought. Or said? He couldn’t tell, because his thoughts were too loud for him to tell if they were thoughts or words. He blamed the quiet library for this. His mental dialogue—or whatever they called mentally stuttering these days—echoed in the silence.
This short fic was written while listening to the song "Everything has changed" by Taylor Swift repeatedly for hours at end while writing, and may or may not relate to the lyrics. These scenes were what come to my head when I listen to this song. Please be respectful.
He had been doing this activity for the past half an hour now, and by the looks of it, he wasn’t going to stop.
Here he was, in a closed room, with a round table, five chairs, History notebooks, and Dean Winchester. What had he done to deserve this?
Cas kissed Dean gently again, this time reaching for his sweatshirt, and pulling it over Dean’s head. The cool air caused goosebumps to form on his skin.
It had been so obvious that Meg, his good friend for a while, teased him about it every chance she got.
The pain of the water rushing into his body through the windpipe was unbearable. It was like it carried sharp razors, cutting him up inside as it went. He found this pain worse that he had felt when he had dug the raised into the inside of his arm. Unlike that time though, there was no blood. It was all neat and clean.
“Discord; CaffiNATEd, sorry to interrupt, but you guys reeeeeeally need to know what my mom just said
Just the feeling of Cas’ hard throbbing shaft against his own, along with the sounds that came from him and his hot breath on his neck felt enough to send him over the edge, and it took everything in him to hold back until Cas was there too.
“No,” he nodded, putting on his teaching face. He needed to keep his head straight, even when he was very gay.
Cas moved the pillow from his lap, and sat forward, close enough to Dean that he could feel the warmth radiating from his body. Then he kissed Dean’s lips, cupping his face in one hand.
“Fuck, this is torture,” Cas mumbled and he tore himself away from Dean and off the bed, leaving him lonely on the bed.
They wouldn't stop, and Dean couldn't move his body to push them away. They were hurting him, like they always did. With their words and their expression and their sneers, and now with their hands.
There they were, under the player that was paused somewhere in the middle of Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! on loop, the notifications.
Dean laughed at that, Cas bit back his own grin. Then he let Dean’s hands go and pulled his own shirt off.
It wasn’t really big like the ones in porn, but it wasn’t small either. He got up, and crawled over to him to take it in his hand, and it was warm and pulsing.
Finally, five minutes later, Dean sighed and the tapping of his feet stopped. He closed the book with a thud, which Cas’s heart mimicked, and he looked up.
He hated the fact that Ellen was right, but he wanted it. He really did. He hadn’t felt like he did now in a very long time and he wanted the feeling to stay. He wanted to know more about the guy. His hobbies, his likes, his dislikes, his quirks, his opinions...
And here he was, looking at him with eyes so soft, Dean wanted to lay down in them and sleep, and then never wake up.
This time when he pulled his phone back out, Cas was sitting by him, waiting for him to see if he had received the snaps. He had—the chat said delivered—but Cas wanted to be sure, and Dean did it just because Castiel asked.
Dean opened his eyes to find Cas grinning, but he wasn’t able to pull back, because he got pulled forth by Cas’s other hand.
“There can’t be too many people,” she booped his nose. “If there were Cas would’ve been down here, yelling at them to get out.”
Not babe, darling, love—or any of the other names that he uses in the rest of the day. Just my name. Always.
He felt like he was in a trance. Everything around him was static. Even the water had stopped moving. The ocean no longer whispered in his ears. The water no longer burned the wounds it had made inside him.
“How do you know that?” Cas frowned. For all he knew, a girlfriend could be moving in with him in a few days.
“Yes?” Cas hoped Dean couldn’t see his flushed cheeks, and if he had, he hoped Dean thought it was the work
“Sure,” Dean shrugged too, and then a colour changed on his face, “I mean, if you’re free, that is. I don’t want to trouble you or anything.”
He looked up at Cas again, who was now looking at the wall in front of him. His eyes made him feel like he was laying under the summer sky. His breath smelled like mint, probably from brushing teeth. His hair fell over his forehead like a vine on a ledge.
“Hands up,” he mumbled and Dean complied, putting his hands up above his head. He felt too good to do anything to oppose a direct order.
He didn’t want to disturb anyone talking to anyone. He didn’t want anyone to stop their happy day and listen to his sad-boy thoughts. Not internet strangers, not friends, not family.
There was no wind in the swimming area, yet still, Dean felt his skin prickle. The cold was crawling up from the tiled floor, and he took it as a sign.
The glasses were outside in the box. All he had in the kitchen was the coffee cup he pulled out last night, and the coffee cup he pulled out this morning, both unwashed.
He hadn’t known that Cas worked out, but then again, he didn’t know anything about what Cas did and didn’t, so it didn’t matter.
It was an average boring ceiling—a typical college café ceiling. Dean counted twenty cracks—one of them looked like a car—while Castiel gently wiped under his eyes.
If you're a minor, or feel uncomfortable reading nsfw, please, it is important that you skip the chapter.
His hands are a little rough, and I find him rubbing his palms together unconsciously when we are sitting somewhere. He rubs his fingers on every surface, comparing it to his own fingers, and then declaring that “I love this fabric, its soft when I move my hand this way, and rough when I move it this way.” When he is sitting on the carpet in the living room, or is under the blanket in the bed, he moves his hands on the surface making patches of shades in it. Sometimes he makes drawings in it with his fingers, and erases them like it’s a blackboard.
He focused his eyes onto Cas', looking for an answer. What happened? Why was he trying to wake him up?
As if she was waiting for it, Cas’s phone rang somewhere on the nightstand and he picked it up to see that it was Ellen.
“I need to know your schedule,” he pulled out his pencil from the spiral ring, “and other information, like, how much you know already, so that we don’t have to waste time on that.”
The grip around Dean’s wrist was only light enough to not bruise; if he pulled it, he wouldn’t be able to break out of it.
I keep asking him not to do that, for jack idolizes him and copies him word for word, but Dean Winchester is Dean Winchester, and no one can stop him.
He wasn’t going to let that happen. There wasn’t anything out there waiting for him. His house would go to his brother. His car would too. He never had a mother or a father who would grieve for him. He didn’t have friends in a true sense either. He no longer had the shitty job he used to wake up for every day. He didn’t have a pet that needed caring. There was no one he needed to pay a debt to.
He found that he still couldn’t take it very far, so he didn’t take his hand away from his mouth, and Cas only seemed to like that, so he tried not to think about it, until Cas pulled back and away from his hands.
He looked down at the pill, and thought of how to tell Cas—a guy he barely knew— that there was a reason he didn't take pills.
“Seems like you’re not going to stop doing that.” Cas said, leaning down again to nuzzle Dean’s neck. He felt Cas’ erection forming against his stomach.
Then he could binge watch How I Met Your Mother, and then, if Ellen would ask, he’d say he did go, but he wasn’t interested. This was a good plan.
He dove straight to the bottom of the deeper end, and then settled there, crossing his legs. The backpack of bricks anchored him to the floor of the pool, just like it was supposed to.
"Huh?" Cas raised his brow and again and from this angle, it looked very different than it did before.
Not so very thankfully, the phone buzzed again in his hand, and he threw it back in again, making sure this time it wasn’t too hard.
He took his coat off, and placed it by himself, over the arm of the couch. Besides that, there was an empty book shelf, a rug, curtains on a coffee table and loads of boxes. The boxes were labeled in a messy handwriting, like the person who did that was in a hurry. One of them even looked like shorthand.
He lifted his arm up, and took a breath of release when the only thing he smelled was the deodorant.
I have ten of them now, that were made "only and only" for me to wear. Others are for Jack, two for miracle, some get sent to Sam and Eileen, and Rowena absolutely adores them, so gets sent the most.
It was the third day of his week long holiday, since Nora was mad that he didn’t take any days off. It was windy with possibility of rain, maybe in the evening. He didn’t get up very early, even though it still was at nine in the morning; his was as late as it got for him since the teenage. He had showered, and the water was just the right warm. He had already laid out clothes for himself, and that made him very happy. The pancakes looked great, the blueberries looked mouth-watering, the bottle of maple syrup was new, and the coffee—oh, the coffee.
Cas looked up to see Dean sit down again, this time closer than before. He could smell his lavender and woody cologne from here. It embraced him like a pair of wings, and it was oddly soothing.
Cas lowered himself, beside Dean, and Dean felt his fingers graze up his side and settle on his cheek. Cas pulled Dean’s face towards himself, and Dean kissed his lips back really slowly, just savoring the feeling of them.
Cas was quickly in and out; only stopping to frown at what pie he should buy, and then to pay for it. He feared that if he would stop, he might change his mind.
What he didn't know from experience was what it felt like to have a person sing him to sleep. So everything he knew about lullabies was from reading.
He had stood there, in the middle of the east ground, surrounded by dozens of unknown blurry faces, and thought so hard, but noting came to him. His thoughts were so loud. So very loud.
He couldn’t win an argument with her. Never had. Only Jo could do that, and that was because she was—according to Ellen— ‘more like her late father’.
Dean watched his head fall back, when he picked up the pace, and kissed Cas’ Adam’s apple like he had wanted to. Cas dug his fingers into Dean’s hips and pulled him closer to himself and Dean complied, crawling closer on his knees to the very edge.
He was bisexual! And if not that, he was under that umbrella. Why would he just assume that Dean was straight? Idiot! This wasn’t a waste of time— it was anything but that!
There he was, right across the street, hitting a mat with a racket in his yard. His short brown hair was a mess, as if he had just gotten out of bed. His clothes—jean shorts and a Zeppelin t- shirt—backed up that thought.
She was beautiful; her eyes looked deep and soft, and her smile was show stopping.in the photo, the two were looking at each other and in their eyes Cas saw enough to know that this wasn’t a sibling. There was no way that she wasn’t his girlfriend.
“No,” He repeated, and moved completely away from the sink. He took a seat at the table, and picked up the coffee cup. “You can’t do this. This isn’t how it works.”
It wasn’t at her place, to start with. This house was smaller than hers, and so, more packed. Then they ran out of booze half an hour ago, and there was someone sent to get more but they hadn’t come back yet. And to make it worse, a lot of straight people had found their way here, and now he was stuck on the couch, sandwiched between two girls who were only talking to each other.
Air rushed into Cas’s lungs, and he gasped. He had to put his down on the table to stop it from spinning. His whole face was burning, and he could bet there was smoke coming out of his ears from the fried circuits of his brain.
One of them—a curvy black girl in a short white dress—was even ‘kind’ enough to ask, “Are you okay?”
“Nothing,” he told dean, “So you know about the discovery of the new world since kinder-garden, you’ve watched Hamilton, you know things about the truth behind nursery rhymes, and you know how ridiculous history is.”
He comes up behind me when I am cooking, and places his hands gently on my waist, resting his chin on my shoulder, breathing in against my neck ever so gently, just to ask “what’s the nice smell?”.
Dean chuckled at that, and pulled his face back down. He really liked the way Cas’ lips felt on his. It was like they melted against each other.
He still had his legs folded under him, so there wasn’t much space on the bench, but Cas didn’t ask for Dean to give him any space. He placed one hand on the wood under Dean’s folded leg— Dean felt the presence of it as if it was a radiating—and with the other, he wiped under Dean’s eye with the tissue.
“There’s no problem in that,” Cas decided to look somewhere else. Where? Um… table. Table looked good. “We’re not doing much today anyways.”
The back of Dean’s throat tightened, like it did when he was about to cry. It felt like it was scorched, and slowly the pain spread down into his chest and then to his ribs.
Hi, with a smile, and then I’m Cas and—oof, no! He wasn’t going to tell a stranger his nick name! Say the full name.
He was out of the water on the cold tiles. He didn't want to be here. He wanted to be in the water with Cas. This wasn't fair.
They were preparing for their SATs at Cas’ house. It was late, and neither of them had the energy to move anymore. They were so exhausted that they didn’t even put the books away. Cas let his body fall back, and laid on the carpeted floor of his room where they were sitting. Dean did the same, and the two of them breathed together silently, until Cas said something. He had said it so low that Dean couldn’t hear it, and because he didn’t want to waste Cas’ energy in trying to speak louder, Dean got up, and laid his head closer to him.
He was heaven’s most beautiful angel, with his messed up black hair, pretty baby blue eyes, sharp jaw, and the ginese—guiness… how do they spell it? Guinness? Yes—Guinness World Record of the world’s most contagious smile. That was Cas.
“Because,” Ellen pushed off the counter, and came to sit in the chair next to him, “It’s been three months and two days since valentine’s day, and I haven’t seen that British guy come back here to meet you.”
“Hey there.” Dean leaned back in his chair, a smile crawling onto his lips. Then his brows furrowed. “You’re late, no?”
He looked up one last time at Cas to see if he believed him—he didn’t seem to—and kissed the base of his shaft to assure him. The hair tickled his nose. Slowly, he kissed his way up to the tip, and rolled his tongue around the swollen head. It tasted salty.
Then he heard the whisper, “closer,” and he did just that. Now he was close enough that his nose brushed against Cas’ arm. On that, Cas lifted his arm and asked him to come even closer, and then, they ended up with Cas’ arms around Dean, and Dean’s head on Cas’ chest.
It didn’t take long before the water in his body had cut all it could, and his lungs stopped trying to draw in anymore. The peace was back again, only ever disturbed by a distant ripple of water.
Dean liked that—he liked all of it, but he liked that in particular; Cas getting all buisnessy, ready to see what the problem was and devise a solution for it.
They started with the kitchen, which, Cas found, was just opposite to his own. Cas was ashamed of it, but he laughed each time Dean took five minutes to decide where to put the jars, and were to put the plates.
Dean kissed him back, caressing his tongue with his own. Cas pushed his jeans off, and then pushed him back onto the bed, only pulling away from the kiss to let Dean lay down again.
Then slowly, Cas started to slow down. Maybe he was drifting off too? But his hand didn't falter even for a moment, and he continued to pat Dean to sleep.
“It’s a good party,” she said, finally stopping, “you’re just grumpy because you didn’t get high in an hour.”
Cas turned around, and a pulled a chair for himself too, making sure that there was a chair still between them.
Dean dropped the towel, and then struggled briefly to unstrap his watch from his wrist and before dropping it onto the towel. The weight of bricks in the bag on his shoulders tried to tip him back, but he maintained his balance.
Other times, when he wakes up before me, it is finding his clear green eyes staring at my face as his hand gently caresses my cheek, or plays with a strand of my hair, or traces my lips. No movement rough enough to wake me up; no movement gentle enough to not be felt. Then, when I am awake, it is the beautiful smile that slowly forms on his face, and the first words that come out his mouth are “hey, Cas.”
"It's not that," he shook his head. The words 'I can't swallow it' were sitting on his tongue, but they wouldn't come out.
From here, he could see Cas’ pronounced cheekbones and stubbly jaw. His brows were golden, unlike his hair. Did he dye the hair? Whatever he did, Dean liked it. Cas’ lips looked really close to his face, and if he lowered his head just a little…
“As you wish,” Dean looked away from Castiel’s chest and pulled his phone out, unplugged his hands frees and threw them both in his bag.
Somedays, I find him standing in the porch, just looking across the front lawn at the trees, looking as if he is counting them in his head. If it is raining, he closes his eyes, and inhales deeply, absorbing the petrichor into his whole existence, and then calling me to smell it too. He loves that scent, and wishes to put it in a bottle, but when I offer to have that arranged, he just silently declines.
He didn’t let Dean say yes or no, he just pushed on his shoulder ever so gently. It wasn’t even a push, it was basically just placing his hand, but Dean automatically scooted over as if it was muscle memory and Cas sat down right next to him.
“Take a guess.” She smirked at him, and took his hand to drag him through a group of people ‘chatting.’
“You look pretty with and without makeup,” he said finally, “It’s just a different pretty—equal, but different.”
“Pff.” Ellen swatted an invisible fly, already on her way to his kitchen. “Jolene can take care of that.”
I can go on for days about these little things, and the list would never end. But no one has that kind of time, especially not me. Instead of listing these things, I would love to spend what time I have, watching my husband play with our son, and make sure that they have hot-chocolate when they are finally satisfied with how drenched they are in the rain, and the number of frogs they have spotted along the house.
On hyper days, I find him coming back from work, and then immediately running to the kitchen to cook something. He kneads the dough, and we make pizza, or sometimes, just bread—Jack doesn’t mind eating both. If not that, he does the dishes, and then he does all the dishes in the house, and still looks like he can do more. In that case, I ask him if he can sort out the closet. Sometimes, he does that, sometimes he just pulls out a box of strings, and makes bracelets.
There is, in fact, a white board in Jack’s room, and Dean just can’t stand that there’s something peacefully written on it. Each time he passes by, he makes sure it is his duty to run his finger through at least one line of text, erasing all the letters from the middle. He finds some sort of satisfaction in that. After that, Jack throws all the pillows he has in his room at his dad, and when he has no more left, they have a fist fight. But that never stopped Dean from ruining the “funny looking scribbles on the board.”
“It’s mute,” Dean said, and Cas looked at him to see that he was smirking. “Also, you’re fifteen minutes late.”
He could always just take the pie home, and then eat it all alone, binge watching How I Met Your Mother. Do nothing, other than sitting on the couch in his undergarments, staring at the screen.
The party did not feel like a Meg Masters party until Dean found the only quiet room in the whole house; the room which belonged to the quiet guy he had hardly met before, Castiel Novak.
Cas' scent engulfed him. His cologne combined with the scent of coffee beans was very calming, yet somehow, exciting. The pillow was soft under his head, and through it he could feel Cas' folded legs. If he looked up, he could see the guy smiling down at him.
Dean didn't know from experience what it felt like to be lulled to sleep-- or maybe he did? Seeing that he had fallen asleep listening to repetitive soothing sounds many times.
"You're not," Cas cut him off, "I promise. In fact..." He reached behind him to grab a pillow, and changes his sitting position, "I can give you a massage," he said, and placed the pillow on his lap, and patted it.
“Okay, I get it now,” he sat back, folding his arms over his chest again. “You got overwhelmed again.”
He was thankful that he had enough brain-cells to decide that he was not going to tell her who his student was going to be.
“I’m not here for that, boy,” she waved him over, still looking out the window. “I’m here for that.”
Dean bit his lip. He pushed Cas back, and stepped off the bed, and Cas watched him, utterly confused until he got on his knees. His jeans did little to make the floor feel soft, but that was the least of his concerns.
“I’ll just put this in the kitchen real quick,” he nodded on his way in, and Castiel followed him in.
And so he did. He didn’t know what came over him— what little alcohol he had consumed, or the state of Zen he was in—but he reached up and held Cas’ face in his hands. That drew Cas’ attention back onto him, and his fingers stopped. Slowly, Dean pressed his nails onto Cas’s cheeks, and dragged his fingers down to his jaw. It did make the scratchy sound.
The rhythm of Dean’s foot tapping changed, and Cas recognized another song, but he couldn’t tell what exactly it was.
"It went like this," he continued, as he placed the pill in Dean's hand, and then climbed onto the bed to grab a water bottle from the other side, "‘You know what 'fine' stands for right? Fucked up, insecure, neurotic, and emotional.’" He handed the bottle to Dean. "And I really like that dialogue."
Cas didn’t call everything pretty. He called plants pretty. He called the beach pretty. He called shiny things pretty. He called his journal pretty.
He had to stop though, because his headache was still there and he winced as it reminded him of his presence.
Why had they pulled him out? Why didn't they let him be at peace? Why did they have to pull him out of heaven into this hell? Why??
He was knocked off his feet twice on his way up to the second floor. Apparently there were other people who had gotten this idea too. The bathroom was filled with girls, and then there was a line outside, too.
That made Cas a little flustered for many reasons; some of them being Dean calling him by his full name, and Dean nodding right away whenever he would suggest something.
Dean’s smile changed his mind. It was the smile of a child who was offered help in reaching the cookie jar from the top shelf.
With that, he pointed to the nearest empty seat, and Dean sat down with a groan next to the silent student; Cas Novak. The guy smelled suspiciously like a library and a firewood, which kept Dean awake for the rest of the class.
“I must admit,” he mumbled pecking Dean’s lips and then settling between his legs. “I like being on top.”
He randomly walks into the room, grabs my hand, and if I am sitting pulls me up to the middle of the room, and gives me a spin as if we are at a ball, and then just let’s go of my fingers and leaves just as he had come in.
This is what Dean had always wished he could do. He wanted to stare into Cas’ eyes for hours at end, and never looking away. Never having to close his eyes, even to blink. He wanted to stare into them until he lost consciousness, and then when he would wake up the next day, Cas’ eyes would be there to greet him.
Dean saw stars at the end of his vision as his body convulsed uncontrollably. This definitely made the list of best orgasms that he had had. He most definitely wanted to do it again.
He sat up, but he couldn’t do it properly, because Cas’ grip on Dean’s hands was too tight. He was stuck on his back under Cas, his hands held over his head.
Dean leaned his forehead against the linen closet door, knowing Cas could probably see him from the kitchen table. As much as he wanted to just grab his keys and bolt, there was also a sense of relief underscoring the dread. For better or for worse his secret would be out and maybe,
Setting down his handful of plastic bags on the counter, Cas looked up briefly at Dean hovering in the doorway with a grin, then started pulling out food.
“Fuck it.” His voice echoed a little and he abruptly opened his eyes, blinking hard and then squinting to focus against the dull ache behind them.
Dean had just pulled into the garage at home when his phone chirped with an incoming text. He’d left his dad's house right after breakfast with single-minded determination to get himself home to Cas as quickly as humanly possible.
The room was as empty as it had been when he had closed them. No Billie. No gooey black Empty tentacle-y business.
Cas appeared in the doorway without his coat or shoes, something in a plastic bag held carefully between his hands. He looked a little nervous.
While the kitchen still had what looked like its original cabinets, they’d been repainted and gifted new hardware, and a new countertop had been installed. He nearly salivated at the sight of all of that real estate and briefly allowed himself to imagine the luxury of cooking with all that
“What you’re making right now is so far from a traditional pizza that you can’t even try to stand on that argument,” he said playfully. “You can smack talk it all you want, but pineapple on pizza is amazing and I have no doubt that once you try it you’ll agree.”
The rusty marks of Cas’ grip on his shoulder lingered in the corner of his eye as he got out and started walking over, looking around at the abandoned town around them.
Except that once they were locked in together, her lips warm and welcoming under his, the softness of her familiar feminine shape pressing eagerly into him, he felt…guilty.
The way Jack just blithely assumed Cas was ‘resting peacefully’ when he knew damn well Cas hadn’t exactly been a big fan of any of his previous experiences with it irked Dean.
After giving his brother a virtual tour of the new apartment, with extra emphasis on the second bedroom that Dean promised him would be furnished in time for Sam’s arrival the following June, Dean headed out for a just-moved-in grocery run.
, he thought, idly toying with a loose thread. Sam was due to arrive in a week and he knew that was going to change things. Both of them would have their brothers living with them; things like spontaneous sex in the kitchen would have to wait until Gabriel moved out and they could have Cas’ place to themselves.
“Say the word and he’ll be sleeping with the fishes,” Gabriel said vehemently, awkwardly patting at the back of Cas’ shoulder. “I know some people who know some people who can
“Aw, Cas, aren’t you just the best,” Dean teased, exaggeratedly batting his eyelashes to get a smile out of Cas.
Cas bounded down the stairs in his bare feet, excited beyond belief to finally be meeting Dean’s much talked about and clearly beloved little brother.
“Oh, yeah?” Too aggrieved to panic at the line of questioning, Dean shuffled down the hall toward the kitchen. He needed to keep busy, keep moving if he was going to have any hope of holding it together in front of Sam; there was always something to fiddle with in the kitchen.
“I didn’t want to pressure you,” he said finally. Dean nearly held his breath to keep from saying anything that would stop Cas from talking, but he squeezed his hand to let him know he was listening.
The tree out front of the apartment had dropped all but its most tenacious of leaves, and Dean knew his days with his Baby were numbered. Her glossy Tuxedo Black body was too important to subject to harsh de-icing salt and slush, and her powerful rear-wheel drive, making her a dream to handle on any kind of dry road, was just an accident waiting to happen in the ice and snow of a Montreal winter. He was reluctantly counting down the days until he’d have to settle her into storage at Bobby’s and trade her spot in the garage for the reliable old Accord he kept for winter driving.
He looked over to see if Gabe was still paying attention. He was, and being a big brother himself, he felt a renewed wave of sympathy for Dean.
Jack pulled back first, and Dean was a little shaken to see they weren’t in front of the Roadhouse anymore.
Dean’s spirits soared. “I’ll call you whatever you want if you’re serious about what you just said.” He edged a step closer, waited to see if Cas objected. When he didn’t say anything, Dean closed a bit more of the distance. “But seriously, Cas, we can work this out, I know we can.”
It had taken him months before he could bring himself to take a trip back to Montreal to “visit Bobby”, and when he’d finally slipped into a bathroom stall with his chosen partner for the night, he’d never hated himself more.
Laughing, Cas led Sam in. “No, you had the right one. I was up here anyway.” He set the heavy bag he’d carried up next to the console table.
It was oddly heady, having someone watch him that intensely. He was used to being looked at, used to catching someone checking him out, a speculative or maybe even slightly predatory look in their eye. But Castiel didn’t look at him like that, which was intriguing as hell even if Dean kind of wished he would. Castiel looked at him like he was trying to bring out the 3-D image hidden in Dean’s face like one of those trippy things from the nineties, like he was one second away from his eyes crossing with the force of his focus.
When Cas didn’t reply Gabe pressed on. “He told me about a misunderstanding that explains a lot about why Dean acted the way he did.”
While he smiled automatically at the compliment, Cas still had a worried frown creasing his forehead.
Following the sound of his brother’s reply, Dean found him at the map table, a notebook and pen in front of him. Sam looked up as Dean came closer.
“Of course I don’t!” his brother nearly shouted. He visibly struggled for a moment, pushing his fingers roughly back through his hair before looking at Dean. “I’m so sorry that some dumb comment I made had you thinking that I wouldn’t be ok with you being with a guy, but I really wish that you’d have said something,
“Uh, thanks for being cool about it, I guess?” Never having been in the position of turning someone down when they were already on their knees, he was more than a little out of his depth.
a morning person. Dean had spent the last hour playing around in his new kitchen while working his way through his own enormous mug of go-go juice.
“Oh god,” Dean said dramatically. “You finally murdered him, didn’t you?” He threw his hands up, palms facing Cas as he shook his head. “No, no, don’t tell me. I can’t testify against you if I don’t know anything.” He looked around. “Ok, no, but seriously, if you need a place to hide a body the Impala has a huge trunk and I know a guy who knows a guy—”
He got a sigh in reply, Cas’ shoulder shrugging away from his touch. “Aren’t you tired of this game yet?”
The car keys were still in his pocket, so he exchanged them for his scuffed up phone and turned his back on the dungeon, heading back out into the main hall of their now unnervingly silent home, conspicuously missing one squinty-eyed man-shaped wavelength of celestial intent.
