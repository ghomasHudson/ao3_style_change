“No. I was given a choice.” Sherlock’s voice is hard. “It was either standing before the court of law with a predetermined result of being convicted, or fleeing the country and getting you, Mrs Hudson, and Lestrade killed. I knew that until I destroyed Moriarty’s web, there was no way I could have changed my name (not even illegally) or travel to Kenya, as you so kindly offered. The problem was that I had no idea who was watching us and how. I couldn’t put you all at risk like that. It was only later that I realised that there was no such a web and that Moriarty really was just a lone consultant for hire who had occasional dealings with Winston.
“It's very important.” Sherlock stresses the word 'important'. “It's about...” He hesitates. “It has to do with Moriarty's network. I need you to behave naturally and you're not an especially gifted actor, but you are excellent at suppressing your emotions. Suppressed confusion and anger will benefit us in this situation. All right?”
She sighs. “My father was a dentist and wanted for me to get my education in the former metropolis, so we could expand our business. He'd had a sizeable inheritance, but by the beginning of the nineties the business had diminished. Still he managed to send me to live with my uncle in Great Britain. It was only later that I found out he...” She falters.
Slowly Sherlock nods.
“You and John?” she says inquisitively, raising her pleading, blue-shadowed, eyes to him. “Are you managing?”
“No, I wasn't.” Sherlock nods. “But the time hasn't come for that yet. It has to happen gradually.”
“There's not much I can...”
He knows that if Sherlock considers himself on a stake-out, he can endure a lot more serious cold than a five or six below zero for even two or three hours without any damage to his health. And judging by his predatory, detached expression, Sherlock is currently indeed on a stake-out.
He's ready fight for it, feels his body going tense already, but to his surprise Sherlock doesn't even raise his eyebrow.
“If you ask me, his master is one poor fellow.” The second guard snorts. That’s the younger one (has a rare motorcycle, which he devotes his every spare minute to).
As for the pseudo historical speculations about the three years that they were gone from Baker Street and the judgemental public eye, then Holmes himself has addressed the matter in his memoirs. [JMorstan: judgemental public eye? XD Mum, your grandiose style is going to ruin you and your article!] I’ve read articles that suggest that the memoirs have been either custom ordered or written under psychological influence. The book has even been called a product of a demented old fool regaling his old glory days through rose-tinted glasses, which could be considered a weird interpretation since the text itself shows a great deal of self-criticism and Holmes’s own attestation to being a short-sighted egotist. But the current work has not been written to defend against those works, so if the reader had been visited by the ghost of Doubting Thomas with similar concerns, it would probably be helpful to read “Lionheart” for themselves. [JMorstan: Gentle hand there, mum! XD I sometimes get the impression that if you hear about Stockholm syndrome or Sherlock’s escape to Newcastle and that runaway slave form Uncle John had to fill one more time, you are gonna breathe fire!]
“Is that an order, master?” he replies with a put-on indifference and then freezes, cold with dread.
There’s one question Greg can’t hold back though. “But what about… Sherlock?”
“Relax, Mr Lestrade,” says a voice in a perfect London accent with a slight Welsh lilt and a familiar professional air of somebody on the field of law enforcement. “If you cooperate, you'll come out of it unscratched and in one piece. I'll give you a second to think of your daughters... Done?”
“You're a good copper, Lestrade,” says the dark one who Greg has already labelled an investigator, although a mere police investigator wouldn't use such unorthodox methods. “You can clearly hold your own, but right now, you can't lie. You can tell half-truths, omit certain facts, but to lie outright is impossible. Tell me, Lestrade, what did you really think? What were your conclusions?”
“I was going to. Today. Once your adrenalin levels went back down.”
On the fourth day, after a disgusting prison lunch, he is ordered out of the cell and led under guard, most probably, to his stationary placement. Where is he being sent then, Sherlock wonders. Municipal slave... perhaps into cleaning services? That could prove beneficial, more opportunities. It would be amusing to fall pray to the shortage at the Yard... But no, even if Lestrade had applied for him, the application would hardly be approved, since all Sherlock's achievements are now regarded as fake. Perhaps somebody has bought him?
At least he really wants to believe it.
“And I would have to conduct myself differently,” Sherlock mutters, “to pass as someone else.”
“That's what you've always done.”
“You'll survive. Unbutton your shirt.”
“No, I've been very careful. I've not been near them for the past month. No, it's... It has nothing to do with Moriarty.”
“Correct. I exposed him to the Movement - provided them with definitive proof and they dealt with him.”
Today, John isn't expecting any nasty surprises. It's the other way around: they've just solved that Morstan case with the Indonesian pearls and although the 'treasure map' (a microchip containing code system drug traffickers used) now rests somewhere on the bottom of the Thames, which only seems to have calmed Morstan and his charming fiancée down. Now they’ve left for Europe to celebrate; upon closing the clinic Rohan even stopped by to say hello while shoving some Indian national honey-based sweets at John.
“Truthfully, you're indebted to us almost as much as Dr Desai,” Sherlock says, also lowering his voice. “She's finally agreed to reciprocate your feelings after letting go of some of the guilt about her brother, hasn't she?”
“What?!” John takes a step back, but Sherlock follows him. “Do you seriously believe that? How can you even...”
“Yes, the nice young lady got slightly confused. Seemed it was her first experience with a personal slave. The nurse on duty looked at her askance, so in her defence she said that at the vet's, where she takes her cat, they always give it sweets at the end of the visit.”
After an uncomfortable silence where he restlessly shifts on the bed, he's sitting on, Greg says, “So... What happened then? How did you escape? Sherlock...?”
“We've caught the bird in our hand, didn't we?” John remarks.
“Almost.” He smirks grimly. “It's the clothing I'm going to wear from now on. Rather strange for a slave to dress better than his master, don't you think?”
Looking into those piercing, grey eyes in the dim light of their stairwell, John nods almost against his will. Sherlock sighs in relief and leans in, rubbing his cheek to John's in such an unexpected but natural display of trust that John feels something in his chest contract and then leap. He raises his arms to hug Sherlock, but the detective's already gone.
“What has to happen gradually?!” John barely keeps himself from shouting.
Some of his, as John likes to call them, “secret service of gratitude” (shoe shop owners, salespersons, restaurateurs, and other people from the service sector) are indeed sincerely grateful.  Angelo, for instance: not only does he eagerly help him in his investigations, he behaves as if he's receiving tickets to the first row seats when it happens.
“It's a mistake,” he says, “it's a mistake, you misunderstood. It wasn't me! Let me go! John, where are you?”
“You've always liked dangerous.” Sherlock shrugs.
“Price fluctuation on baby foods for the last three months,” he answers shortly. “Irrelevant. I'll try to forget it as soon as possible.”
At that John laughs, and then he's trembling and shaking in a whirlwind of hysterics. For some reason it's funny to imagine Sherlock next to the woman – she's just... kind of has too much of everything... too large breasts, too full lips, skin a shade too dark, rather thick eyelashes...  And Sherlock's all... He's so scrawny, pale. And covered in bruises to boot, and when naked-
“And?” He tilts his head.
“The passion for tidiness is not mine, it's yours,” Sherlock truthfully, although also confusingly, explains. “Subterfuge. It has to looks like it's your living space shared by me, not the other way around.”
“How do you...” Morstan frowns. “Fine. Doesn't matter. I've heard about the great detective, Sherlock Holmes.” He snorts, not ironically, but as if to his own thoughts. “You could seriously help our cause.”
She falls silent.
“What do you think?” Mycroft sighs. “About freedom from society. About being finally able to shrug off all public sensibilities. Sherlock has always tried to put Watson between himself and all the other people, and now it has happened almost without him lifting a finger to make it happen. I think he might already have learned to appreciate the situation and will hardly put an effort into breaking down these particular walls.”
“... It's all because of you, from the beginning, you buggered brain idiot! You are the one that got involved with that sodding maniac Moriarty, and from then on failed to see farther than your own nose! Solved his puzzles like an donkey with a carrot on a stick! Hell, your face would scare every damn carrot! The donkey would have nightmares about it!”
'Cognitive faculties?' Panic, a thousand times stronger than the previous, hits him with its multi-ton hammer. 'Will it turn me into a retard?'
“Can it wait until tomorrow?” John pleads softly. “Until you're less sore?”
“Oh, but I thought...” Guiltily, she glances away. “They always say such things on the tellys...”
He's had a similar feeling before – a feeling that the next second a bullet will fly just over his shoulder – but usually it was instantaneous, like a hammer to his head, tying his insides into a knot and making him leap forwards, aside or backwards. This time though, the premonition was like a tiny ice shard stuck somewhere deep inside his psyche, somewhat similar to a half forgotten childhood memory about sneaking into the cinema at night.
There's an almost imperceptible furrow on her brow, as if she wanted to frown, but reconsidered.
On his way back John skips the trip to the grocer's, hurries as if there's a fire. No idea why; something's just eating at him from the inside. Can't help but think about how a couple of days back – at the old flat – Sherlock woke up in the middle of the night and John asked him about it. Asked if he was dreaming about being an Indian boy again, and Sherlock said – don't be an idiot, I was an English boy, don't you remember? And then he said that no, it was a different dream. John, naturally, wanted to know what it was about then and Sherlock fell silent. His breathing seemed ragged in the darkness of their bedroom, but when he replied, his voice was steady, “That they pulled a sack over your head and shot you. And I'm being sold on an auction.”
Sherlock says nothing and with the assertiveness of a salesperson or a self-taught counsellor she interprets his silence in her own way. She continues in a deliberately soft tone.
Sherlock steps back. Lowers his head. Thinks of apologising, but that would be overkill. Besides, in spite of having almost calmed down internally, his jaw and fists are still clenching reflexively: he's not sure he can force a word out yet. He turns round and leaves.
, but he always knows how much he has and where.
“In the light of the circumstances surrounding the current case and according to the Individual Rights Convention of 1894, Act of Violent Conduct 1956, Act on Fraud 1945, and the case of Manchester City Council v Canes 1979, the defendant Sherlock Holmes is found guilty on all grounds and is sentenced...”
Judging by the calm expression on John's face, these words don't appear to hold any revelatory value. “And where is the novelty in that? It seems to me that everything is exactly as it was before.”
“What did you do to make him...” the landlady begins, but then Sherlock pushes John's hand away and sits up. Inhaling noisily, Mrs Hudson peers into his face. “Oh, so you didn't... You really just fell down, Sherlock?”
“What, here?” Sherlock snorts.
“Let's go,” Sherlock says.
“Name your price and I'll pay it.” Sherlock shrugs. “But I'm not going to join the abolitionists. I'm extremely selfish, you see...”
Sherlock used to visit this dental clinic periodically. He happened to do a favour to the owner some time ago and has received a decent discount since. At least partly because all the buzz in the press proved to be good publicity for the business.
“Then why didn't you refuse?”
“Sherlock, it's... it's unbearable, I can't... Let's just leave, and to hell with everything! The court's prohibition on travelling expires in two months and then...”
For some reason, in the court house lobby John walks straight past the exit and towards the toilets. Since he doesn't say anything, for a moment Sherlock stops at the doors. He really doesn't need to go, but John holds the flap for him and points with his chin to the doors. Sherlock obeys. Before the stalls John thrusts a bag into his hands.
It somehow feels odd to just sit on the sofa with the other men.
“Who then?” John asks with dread amounting inside him. “Who are we acting for? Why did we move here?”
After a brief hesitation John nods. “But I want to know everything you can tell me,” he tells Sherlock firmly. “I don't want to go into it blind.”
He should have realised. He should have realised sooner.
Triple damn him! Even while a slave, Sherlock Holmes is sending couriers abroad, while Greg, a team leader of his own department, has hardly anyone to send out for a coffee.
He thought Sherlock would relax in his arms as he sometimes does, but no, his body remains firm, just allowing to lean on him, but John doesn't feel ashamed about the moment of weakness.
“Did you have sexual relations with Dr Desai?”
The waiter welcoming them at the entrance opens the cage and closes it after Sherlock. Stepping over the threshold, John hears the friendly greeting of the chilled girl.
Sherlock raises his eyebrows.
“Only as a last resort, remember?”
Nothing unusual or especially fascinating.
They break apart from each other, laughing.
Before, about a decade ago, the freedom of people unwilling to put on the yoke of society had been respected. Only criminals and debtors were enslaved. On the other hand, now the streets of London are, indeed, a lot cleaner.
“So what's the rate?”
“Exactly,” Sherlock utters almost softly. “You're working tomorrow and we are going to A&E. After that – The Golden Ram, where you'll have a pint or two. And then a couple of other places. It's for a case.”
“John,” she says cheerfully, if a bit stiffly, as if masking her confusion (does it very well, Sherlock had no idea she's such a good actress). “I'm so glad you've managed to drop by at last, it's been ages! Come in, I'll introduce you to Martin.”
Pound moves a bit nearer. “I could spit on what you need, slave,” he pronounces slowly and clearly with put-on indifference. “Get the hell out of here. Or do you want me to call security? Or the police? I'm sure you'll find quite a lot of people will be happy to see you.”
Finally! Thank you for waiting, whoever did and subscribed. I know  it was along wait, but the story is not abandoned, I'm in the middle of the third chapter now. I'm also grateful to everyone who's reviewed. For some reason after a couple of thoughtful remarks from the readers my working speed rises. I know it doesn't make sense, but it's true. :)
“How do you know that?”
Inspector Lestrade isn't having a pleasant day: a nasty murder, an obvious dead end and then the boss sicks a (mostly) paperwork-related inspection on him. In the afternoon there's some improvement: first, he receives the lab result for another nasty case and with clear conscience he sends Donovan to conduct the arrest (she's been eager to do that since forever), then he loses a battle with his conscience and decides to skip the half-hour nap in his armchair in favour of tackling his quarterly report.
Finally John lifts his eyes to Sherlock. His gaze feels heavy, but stubbornly he looks: Sherlock is sitting in an uncomfortable armchair, in a dressing gown a size too small, obviously trying to seem at ease, but John knows him too well. Sherlock is tense.
Upon opening his eyes, John sees Sherlock touching his left wrist with the fingers of his right hand and wincing.
The dentist hesitates.
“No slaves! Slaves are not allowed! Shoo! Shoo!”
“Yes, here. I'm not dragging you upstairs if you've broken a rib.”
John is undoubtedly one of the best representatives of the human species, but even he turns out to be incapable of consistently maintaining a straightforwardly logical pattern of behaviour, despite the fact that Sherlock provides him with the means of salvaging his emotional image of self-worth. So what could he expect from the rest of the human race?
“Whatever you say,” John replies and finally takes off the jacket.
For a bit, John is silent. Then, almost uncertainly, he utters softly, “Thanks.”
John peers at the clock. Thirty-five minutes have passed. It's time to draw the line, he decides; it will take a few minutes to pay, then the barman will get him the change...
“During your service you reported the violations in storing pharmaceuticals twice within a six month period. Name the reasons for your report the second time.”
“I'm touched by your sentiment,” Sherlock bits out somewhat venomously, “but I'd advise not to call any extra attention to our situation. It would be somewhat excessive.”
“For some reason you are harbouring a delusion that I'm careless with my health. You're wrong. I take care of my body as is needed.” He snorts. “How I sometimes wish I were a bodiless spirit. My body’s so tired, though the brain's working as usual. Damn transport!” Sherlock exclaims and slams his right fist into his left forearm.
“You're making for two anyway.” He shrugs. “Sure. So, where's the money from?”
The last thing Sherlock remembers is John whispering “vile thing” while unbuckling his collar, and forcefully throwing it aside. Lying down is a lot more comfortable after that, and not only because noting prevents his head from falling on the pillow.
“Are you serious?”
That’s interesting. Sherlock just told him to deliver the letter, never mentioning a price.
“It's more than a partnership now,” Sherlock states, because it's the truth. “Now our union has become a vital necessity, and not only for me. Modern society's hypocrisy is becoming less and less bearable to you.”
“Could you describe the thief, sir? Let's try to catch him,” the guard responds in a business-like manner. “I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.”
Moving back to Baker Street was difficult after three years, even though Mrs Hudson welcomed them with open arms. As a part of his role as a slave, Sherlock always did the groceries (unless he had more pressing matters to attend) and when they were back at Baker Street, he also, almost went that first night. Then he thought, no, we’re back, it’s John who has to- no, he then realised, John doesn’t have to do anything. And if Sherlock chooses to, he can go to the grocers himself. Or he can choose not to. But maybe, John would like it if Shelock did…?
“What do you want in return?” she continues in the same tension-filled voice.
“What do you know about Mycroft Holmes?”
“By you not beating me up first and fucking me second.”
“Good evening,” he says. “Lasagne is in the fridge, if you're inclined to eat.”
“I don't understand...” Greg mutters. “But you were... in a regular clinic. A private one, yes, but still, just a hospital. I heard that John... John Watson visited you regularly. And well... The newspapers wrote about it.”
Why indeed. Right now, suffering from pain, fear, anger and all the senseless blur hazing up his mind, Greg's pretty sure that the reason is his spectacular stupidity. He should have refused. He was going to. That would have been a sensible, rational thing to do: he has a wife and kids, almost a flawless record. Why the hell would he dive into that bloody shit hole? And then he thought: what am I – a coward? For twenty years he hadn't cowered before his superiors nor criminals so why would he start now?
“What do you know, sir.” She turns to the supine Mycroft. “I'm glad you have visitors at least.”
“Tolerable.”
Gregory Lestrade's head is made of lead, his eye sockets of fire itself. His arms and legs feel like having been buried in snow up to elbows and knees. With some effort and a groan he manages to get upright. Nevertheless, some leaning his back to the white bed covers is necessary while he thoughtlessly stares at the wall opposite. What a fascinating pattern that wallpaper has, damn it... Every half an hour or so, a new thought forms in his consciousness.
“What do you know about the whereabouts of your property named Sherlock Holmes?”
“What's the point of coming to my bed clothed, you imbecile?” Sherlock mutters, sucking at John's neck. Considering how often John rubs it, Sherlock has the fairly sound theory that he has an erogenous zone there.
Curiously though, he doesn't hear the violin. Instead he hears some conspicuous rustling, moving around and dull thumps. Then after some tossing and turning around in bed, he returns downstairs and to his surprise finds Sherlock... cleaning.
“Tomorrow,” Sherlock relents after a pause. “I can work with that.”
“Would you care to explain your sudden passion for tidying up our living space?”
There is no way he can tell the police about the kidnapping. Not all of his and Sherlock's recent actions have been strictly speaking lawful and should they start digging... The cold-blooded fiend with a cane was right about that.
The door opens and a nurse (about thirty, divorced, a young son, lives near-by, comes to work on a bike) comes in, glances at him. Fear. Pupils dilated. Of course. Slaves are not supposed to be here at all, let alone without their master.
John tries to hide his feelings at the mention of The Woman, but he's actually hoping that even if Sherlock notices a trace of guilt on John's face, he'll attribute it to some other reason. On the other hand, it's Sherlock. He did ask for the woman's notebook; he must have realised that John had been lying.
“So you agreed to commit a crime helping a slave to escape?” There’s a sincere curiosity in the interrogator's voice. Or something close to it.
Slave's response is silence. Sherlock hates not being himself.
Yes. That was a ten.
John closes his eyes. The icy nausea is receding; the walls of the sanctuary were shaken, but they still stand. How long until they crumble?
“But I couldn't, how could I?!  Don't you get it? What are you – a human being or a machine? If I hadn't... Seven girls suffered... That son of a bitch! So I... And Nelly! If it hadn't been for him, Nelly would've been... What a  sorry of excuse for a human being would I be if I hadn't helped his brother to escape? No, of course you don't get it. How can you? Damn it!”
If Pound had hit him, Sherlock would have retaliated. After what happened yesterday – definitely. His patience, his ability to play-act and bid his time have reached their limit. And a slave who hits a free man can be sentenced to penal labour, or even to a deadly injection like a rabid dog. Not the best way to go for a man who'd hoped to at least take out his most vicious enemy as his life's work.
“What about the... people we've put this whole act up for...” John licks his lips nervously. “Won't they find it suspicious?”
“He... brought Sherlock... bombs...”
Moving to Camden is scheduled for the end of the month. The new studio apartment has a view on a park and a nice-looking lawn and the flat itself is quite decent, because why the hell would John Watson, who earns enough on his part-time job at the clinic be economising on his living conditions, especially when Sherlock also makes profit on the stock market and his detective work has finally started to pick up?
And John goes.
The official nods at the guard, who then removes the temporary collar. Relief accompanied with a slight nausea. The next collar won't be temporary. Sherlock wishes that everything would be over soon. A childish, naïve emotion, but he can't get rid of it.
“Have to?” Words seemed to be crawling towards John’s consciousness. “You mean… You don’t actually feel guilty?”
“Right. I can always tell - due to my line of work. They wouldn't try to take you bare-handed though, would they now? What I'm actually thinking is - they'd be idiots to go against their betters unless there’s an actual reason - like being tortured for no reason, right?”
“Y-yes...” Although Sherlock is already being led away, she still keeps moving backwards until the opposite wall stops her. “You're right. But... come anyway. All right?” There’s a poorly hidden mix of controversial feelings on her face that she clearly has rarely experienced.
The nurse's fingers trail his collar and clasp the tag.
Holmes expression almost resembles amazement. “ECM is Electronic Computing Machine,” he explains after a pause. “A device capable of storing and analysing large quantities of information. It's an experimental project and I am the only one to have access to one of the information banks of the device. It's... difficult to explain, but the important part is that it is impossible to access without a password or destroying the device, which stores the information.”
Sherlock doesn't stop to admire his accuracy; he grabs John by the shoulders, turns him around and growls into his face, “Stop that!”
It's over in a moment: the hallway is filled with broad-shouldered guys with black ski masks that leave only their eyes and mouths open, who wrench John’s arms behind his back, take his gun, gag him (with a professional, rubber gag), pull something impenetrable over his head, drag him down the stairs and push him onto a back seat of a sedan.
At that moment Sherlock raises his eyes to her and takes a second look. An attempt to greet a slave invites a certain degree of interest. Everything becomes clear almost instantly. She doesn't seem to be a secret abolitionist, so it has to be the only other alternative. He's right: she has a simple business card in her fingers.
He can't finish his speech since John is already kissing him: desperately, hungrily and almost as if for the last time – first time. His lips, narrow, dry and chapped from winter wind, his warm mouth, his deft, but slightly flailing (from his emotional tumult) movements - all are testament to his fears, his anguish and hopelessness. It all narrows down to that one moment, that sole once-in-a-lifetime insane attempt to demonstrate (and prove)... what? That appearances don't matter? That he's ready and that he takes Sherlock as he is, under any circumstances?
The lad anxiously glances at Greg and the girl and says something in German. The girl answers in a soothing tones, lowers the window frame and gestures for Greg to follow. She leads him one flight down and leaves him before a half-open door. She motions him to enter, but walks past the door herself.
“Money's not a problem. Never has been. There's a countless number of quite legal and unbearably boring ways to acquire any sum of cash one could wish. It seems that our current circumstances are forcing me to put some effort into it.”
Some aspects of human communication would always remain a mystery to Sherlock. He’d known from the start that John would like Desai, had even been afraid he’d flirt with her, but it’s three years later and they’re still maintaining a respectful distance, while her husband is greeted with all the warmth of the deepest affection, sans a hug for some reason.
“I'm not going to hit you,” John snaps. “And I won't allow any repeat sessions on the stairs either.”
“Winston spoke about it before he chucked me out. Why, by the way? Why did that body result in them letting me go? Frankly, I thought it was yours.”
“Sherlock didn't tell me anything specific! He told me to go to Switzerland, get some documents from a contact and deliver them where I was told. I thought he was preparing his escape! He was all covered in bruises like a boxing bag, for Christ's sake! I've always thought that John was kidding when he kept saying that he wants to punch Sherlock, but hell!..”
“My wife's initial before marriage,” Greg instantly replies. “Now she's E. C. L.”
And then immediately throws the game by glancing questioningly at Sherlock. He has to go over his options quickly – stay in the corridor and wait for the results of John's negotiations, start coughing to give John an excuse to invite him in out of compassion... but thankfully Rohan herself comes to his aid.
“It’s a phenomenal feeling,” John continues. “A weight off my shoulders, a load off my mind. It’s as if it was my neck that the collar was removed from.” He even unconsciously rubs his neck.
At that moment Sherlock's hands are wrenched behind his back by the hospital security someone summoned. Or well, to be more precise, an attempt is made at wrenching: Sherlock stands quietly and doesn't resist, which kind of takes the wind out of all the initial aggression.
She takes it as if in disbelief, promptly opens it and runs her eyes over it right there, in front of John. Then she raises her eyes to him, looking at him as if he'd bought her the treasures of all the rajahs of India.
“Your property, Dr Watson,” the official says in a pleasant voice. “Are you sure you don't want to implant a tracking device under its skin? Former civil servants have a discount for this advanced procedure. As a soldier you fall into that category.”
“I'll go bump into more things,” Sherlock declares. “A table for instance. Decidedly not enough bruises.”
Icy cold air seeps in from the window, slightly ajar. Greg stands up and leaning onto the mattress like an old man, takes a few steps. The poster bed turns out to be pretty convenient walking-aid.
“See,” the woman in a blue uniform skirt and a white blouse says in a sweet voice. “Your master's come for you, Sherlock. Come now, say hello. You know, like it shows on the poster, remember?”
This is the moment where everything in Sherlock's mind slots into place. What he's been trying to forget about the hospital: the colour of the carpet under his knees, the polite and competent nurse, taking the tubes out of Mycroft's throat... Now the Baker Street flat is falling away, he's looking at the ancient city as if from the stratosphere, down at the bizarre loops of the Thames like a thin thread woven between the city blocks, and at the web... the still existing web that's pulling everything into its centre.
In short, John isn't expecting any trouble and is not surprised when Sherlock isn't at home when he returns.
“Sparring is fine,” John decides. “I can do that. But this time I'm not going to hit you in the face.”
The result is an excess of energy spent on a roundabout way of acquiring the injuries where Sherlock has to be careful not to hurt John in the process, because any stiffness in his movements would be noticed by his colleagues as well as by a certain Mr M's spies, who, Sherlock hopes, are still watching them.
Greg Lestrade is sure he looks pretty much as undignified as it gets. There are tears and snot on his face and he blathers pathetically on and on, not unlike an under-age delinquent on his first arrest, he thinks with disgust. It's impossible to control himself however; the damn drug has turned everything upside-down in his blood while – so fucking unfairly – providing him with absolutely no buzz.
“She's cheating on me,” Greg confesses angrily. “Sherlock told me. What? What else do you want?”
“What for?” Sherlock frowns. “It's me... that should be thanking you. What you did...”
“Yes, Mrs Hudson was very understanding.” John smiled slightly. “Go on then.”
And with this thought he's jerked back into consciousness in a blink of an eye, because  - Harry! Because if John's legally incapacitated she's the one to inherit the ownership of Sherlock! Bloody hell! She's gonna... And he'll...
Suddenly the room is small, void and insignificant. It’s dangling somewhere far down, under his feet while the grey sky of London balloons out into a panoramic view, and the little old lady in a dark purple dress inside some kitchen is of no consequence at all. Even her colour palette seems to be blending in with the tiny flower-patterned walls and cosy interior.
John lets his spoon fall into the bowl of cereal. It seems he's suddenly lost his appetite.
John groans into his mouth and tries to say something – Sherlock isn't terribly bothered: he's not protesting, is he? No, John's definitely not protesting: thrusting his hips to meet Sherlock's, whispering something, his hands stroking Sherlock's back. And his hands are sure, strong - a peculiar contrast to the helpless trembling of his shoulders, the surrender of his head, bent backwards as far as it can go. The sight of it hits Sherlock right into the centre of his wildly beating heart.
“Self-deprecation and false modesty don't suit you,” Sherlock interrupts him again. “Other people don't see you as a bastard or a brute. On the contrary, you come across as sickeningly honorable; that is why we need to go to such ugly lengths to convince the respectable public. But you can do it - we'll do it together, I've thought everything through. Remember, you own me-” John jerks as if from a blow; these words sound very different outside the bedroom. “- and I own you. Two minuses make a plus, John. In the end, we will squash the enemy.”
“You can hit me,” Sherlock says calmly. “By this point it would only be right. I used you without your consent, forced you through some extremely painful experiences, but the worst of all is that you still cannot get rid of me. At least not in a way which wouldn’t contradict your moral code.”
The first week at the new flat passes, as can be expected, quite peacefully, but the inner turmoil  turns John into a wreck. The removal van delivers all the boxes first thing in the morning, after which John goes to work and then spends his time irrationally worrying about how Sherlock is doing. Idiotic of course. And how is Sherlock doing, indeed? The flat is empty, no one there aside from Sherlock himself. Absolutely nothing to be afraid of.
Not the best legacy for John. In that case Moriarty's people would get to John, no problem. Actually, they can do it now, and it's not only John under the hammer. Sherlock has to unravel this damned Jim mess before dealing with his personal little grievances.
The detective again sees himself from above and afar: there's an ordinary street, crammed with blocks of buildings. One of them has a cardboard sign on the façade, brightly lit glass doors and a girl-doll displayed behind the counter to attract the public. Inside the waiting room two figurines are leaning towards each other, their fists clenched: all the classic signs of a face-off. One has a white coat, the other is wearing a collar.
“Oh. Yes, you're probably right. The timing.”
“I am his master.” John is again using that dry, tension-filled voice. “Here are the documents. He hasn't stolen anything. He was chasing a thief as I ordered him to.”
Sherlock knows that many personal slaves, especially those owned by millionaires, visit ordinary clinics for the middle (or lower middle) class. Sometimes they even have their own health insurance. Ergo, he needs an establishment that offers decent treatment and accepts cash from anyone whether they're wearing a collar or not.
“You have today off, silly,” she giggles. “You've been celebrating, I take it?”
“I've... a relative missing,” John says. “I'm going to the police. Let me go this moment or I'll punch you.”
He nods before parting.
Instead of the Land Rover or the operating table he now has an altar in front of him, and on this altar there's a familiar body. With an indescribable terror John realises that the patient's stomach cavity has already been opened and he, apparently, is expected to do something, but he has no idea how to operate. He lacks even the limited skills he had and can't recall a single Latin name for anything he sees. At this point Sherlock rises onto his elbows and looks at John with totally white, unseeing eyes. The lights are out now – no, there wasn’t any light to begin with, only the braziers in the corners – and in their treacherous reddish glow John can see the bloody black mess of the ripped-out guts with a piece of the leather collar sticking out of it.
Still, the need to cry from helplessness persists and it seems that John has given in. At least the blindfold, when removed, feels wet. He's untied from the stretcher and put on a hard chair with armrests, his hands and feet fastened to it with metal cuffs – inescapable. Almost relaxed,  John tugs at his restraints, but there's no give. Nope, he won't be getting out of it. Perhaps they'll kill him soon. It's too painful to think of how he let Sherlock down...
“We could go anywhere, damn you! To the Amazon jungles! To Kenya, join the rebellion!”
The second visit to A&E would have been positively tedious if a young, fair-headed woman hadn't started talking to him. At first she seems so dull and uninspiring that Sherlock doesn't even bother to deduce her aside from the obvious: she ate a hamburger for breakfast and her younger brother's an addict.
John's lips form an uncertain smile. He clears his throat and his voice is hoarse when he says, “How long?”
“Excellent,” the detective says, reaches the sofa in two strides and throws himself onto it. “Now bring me today's newspapers. And tea, please.”
“That means mostly psychological conditioning. And you haven't seen him for the last ten years?”
This is the moment John suddenly realises what Mrs Hudson had thought and feels light-headed. He closes his eyes and takes a couple of deep breaths. How the hell did it get to this point? He’d only tried to do the what’s best.
Sherlock meets his gaze. “You said you trusted me,” he says with a put-on calm. “Do you take it back?”
“It's still better than how it is now! You could even behave worse if it makes you feel better. Actually, you'd been acting as a decent person for quite a while before the... before the arrest.”
“You!” He's staring at Sherlock with astonishment on his face, which could be interpreted in five different ways at least. Agitation – the most obvious of emotions. Indignation. Fear.
John's face darkens, he too seizes his friend's shoulders, pushes him back and starts shouting.
“A century ago marriage was practically a contract of ownership in our country. There was a time – not a long one, granted – where in certain counties husbands even had the right to sell their wives into slavery. So I guess, in a way, we could view our circumstances in the light of...”
“No one knew I would be in a slammer. No, John. You're wrong.”
“I have a shift tonight.” John shakes his curiously empty head.
“I’ve seen stranger things,” Greg insists stubbornly. “I wouldn’t have believed that John could… But you know, the situation… Especially when… you know, with relationships…. And Sherlock - he’s…”
“I'm not an informant.” Sherlock waves his hand. “And not a decoy. And why would I even try to get you talking if I already knew who your contact with the underground abolitionists is?.. Contact me if there's anything I can do.” He lifts a business card out of his pocket and hands it over. “My master, Dr John Watson, takes private cases for my services.”
Despite the residual effects of the drug, John takes the night train to Newcastle. He even has the presence of mind to grab the collar and the money along with the documents. On the train he crashes into deep sleep, but is thankfully woken up in time. Then he somehow manages to crash again at the station while standing up: he rests leaning on the wall and with a hot dog in his hand. When the clock finally strikes eight, he starts clambering up the newly frosted steep, narrow streets of ancient Newcastle. Fortunately, the office for capturing strays and slaves (or whatever its name was) is situated, as promised by the map he bought at the station, not far.
John has always hated to wake him up. He is convinced that Sherlock sleeps too little as it is, but before this all happened, he'd at least come in, straighten the blanket, perhaps take his pulse and mutter something like, “can never get him to bed, and then he hibernates”. For some reason John loves these small signs of attention. Lost his mother early? A cold distant father? Could be either. This morning John restrains himself.
“Jack of all trades, that one,” John mutters. “I note you said ‘was’. I’m guessing he’s kicked it?”
John cuts him off. “Everything you can tell me, Sherlock. Everything that I absolutely can't know, you keep to yourself, agreed? That you will tell me later.”
The woman looks away and he narrows his eyes.
“They have B&B not far from here. How much money did you take?”
“Bombs?”
Nevertheless, Sherlock doesn't want to give up and at first is delighted to hear John's shout of 'stop the thief' behind him. He figures that even discounting the security, at this time of day there should be plenty of young tough lads in the shopping centre who'd be overjoyed with the opportunity...
“There's a municipal hole for the likes of...” Sherlock hears Pound saying. The end of the sentence is cut off by the massive door.
“Nevertheless, people change and mask that they have done so, especially after a psychological trauma. It was imperative that you gave an impression of a person who so far, has been successfully repressing his abnormal tendencies, but after gaining full power over a slave, they broke free. It wasn’t so difficult, since people had already decided that you must be insane to have not only agreed to share a flat with me, but also stayed put after a week.
“Yes.”
John  shakes his head, realises that he doesn't need the Underground, and sits on the wrong bus - he almost makes it all the way to Baker Street. It's only one incident though and he barely loses half an hour over it. Still, on the whole, the fog is starting to fade. When he reaches the flat, it's not yet all clear, but gradually his brain is starting to come online.
There he does everything through a foggy film of unreality: demonstrates the collar, pays the fine. It seems surreal that Sherlock is indeed waiting for him here, alive and well. Or moderately well, because 'satisfactory condition' probably means that all his limbs are attached at least.
As if with a mental click, the last piece of the puzzle inserted itself into the picture. “The body in Clapton?”
And indeed, he is somersaulting, almost with a stuntman-like agility, landing at the foot of the stairs in a dramatic sprawl, as if waiting for a film director to shout 'Cut!'
“Of course. Let's not excite the neighbours too much.” John nods stiffly. “Come in, Sherlock.”
“Good. Would you like to put the collar back now?” the woman suggests politely. She adds in a whisper, “It usually calms them right down. Reflex.”
Well, it doesn't matter if he listens to what his sentence is – it has been obvious from the beginning. Was this what you meant, Jim, when you told me you'd burn my heart out?
“What's the matter?” John asks. “A nightmare?”
Later, after several kicks to the ribs and kidneys, after he's finally realised that he can't break free, John only begs and pleads, smearing his blood and tears of rage all over his face; he's jerking this way and that, oblivious to the hands holding him, to walls surrounding him. The cold voice in his ear is still asking something about Mycroft, but John can't, won't listen to it. Bloody Mycroft... The hell with him... What does he matter, when Sherlock's missing and they won't let him... they're...
“Thank you. I've already bought the collar.”
“What are you doing?” John asks, stunned.
“Don't stop, Lestrade. It will be worse if you do.”
“No, stop.” John feels himself go numb, rubs his forehead. “Stop. You’re talking rubbish. First, why the hell would you even need to seem like an abused slave, and second... Why do you need to do it inside the flat? Why the things... the talk about the cot near the door? You weren't joking, were you?”
The kitchen is smaller – not enough room for all of Sherlock's equipment, but the bare minimum, which he needs to work with immediate material data, will fit. There is no separate room for a slave, but the real estate agent is kind enough to point out an alcove that can be fitted with a screen or even a temporary wall. She holds out a business card of a reliable company that won't charge too much.
This is what Greg will never understand. You could be in a process of severing a limb form a Holmes and they'd still find it in themselves to use the most precise phrases and a roundabout sentence structures.
Sherlock turns round and puts his hands on John's shoulders. Very intently, he's looking into John's eyes and again, for the umpteenth time, John understands and is overwhelmed.
He never enters the room. There's nothing to gawk at, and besides, Mycroft is unable to maintain his end of the conversation. And he never will be; adults don't recover from three months of vegetative state. Not as comforting as one might think.
“What was the other one?”
“Good.” Sherlock pats him on the shoulder, and then, as if remembering something, touches his lips to John's for a brief moment. “One more thing: if it's necessary – it shouldn't be, but if it is – call an ambulance only as a last resort, all right? And don't act out of character with them: I'm your slave, you're the master, nothing more.”
There are no cases. Absolutely none. No calls from Scotland Yard, no letters nor telegrams from private clients. Or well... There are some letters and telegrams, but none of them request their help. Mostly they are complaints, mostly addressed to John, and from the readers of The Strand Daily and fans of his
“The altar's in the bedroom,” Sherlock whispers into John's ear. Resisting mockery is beyond him at the moment. “You really want to be invited in there?”
“I've boxed you in,” Sherlock offers in lieu of an answer while tugging off his gloves.
Sherlock hates losing. The limp body of his prostrate brother under the sheets is the silent testament to his defeat. Back at the beginning, during the ongoing process when there still was a chance to fix everything, he kept looking for the connection between Moriarty and someone form the government. It would have been that much easier if he'd just admitted that Jim, despite all his flair, was not a player, but a pawn on the board. It wasn't Mycroft falling along side Sherlock, but Sherlock himself used as a distracting manoeuvre to once and for all get rid of the elder Holmes.
“Tell me about the first visit.”
A slave is supposed to look down, not meeting the gaze of their superiors, except when it interferes with the orders of their master, but John hasn't given any orders, unless he counts the curt 'come with me'.
. I seriously don't think it would be the best solution. Asia is divided into influence zones...”
Near the hospital Sherlock suddenly says, “If you allow, Master, I can... go in by myself. You go on to the clinic, don't trouble yourself.”
She greets them surprisingly warmly – not as acquaintances, but as old friends.
After John has opened a couple of the first of such letters and falls silent for almost a whole twenty-four hours, Sherlock takes to burning all the irrelevant correspondence. The postman comes at eleven when John is usually already at work.
THANK YOU!
Frowning, Sherlock wonders if that really could be the reason. Could his brother's manipulative nature  somehow helped him to foresee the current ugly situation and thus force Sherlock into the weekly twenty minutes of boredom in the hallway? An additional torture among a long series of unpleasant situations.
While mulling over the advantages of their living arrangement – even in their disgusting new circumstances, which John had no idea how long Sherlock might yet tolerate (don't think about it, don't get distracted!) – he somehow pulls through the shift. His anxiety about Sherlock doesn't let up – what’s he doing, is he sitting at home or has he dashed off somewhere?
John nods, biting his inner cheek, Sherlock is silent and looks down, glancing up and away from time to time, to make it more realistic. Fresh bruises are blooming on his neck: some of them are a result of creative provocation in bed (Sherlock had to hold back from giving John corresponding marks – although they are lucky in John having somewhat less delicate skin), and some come from various experiments with his collar and other household tools at hand.
Pound can't hit him without John's permission. Corporal punishment of another's slave is the strictest taboo of society. Sherlock almost wishes that Pound wouldn't hold back.
“Yes, you are Mr. Equality yourself.” John snorts. Not on edge then; or he pulled himself together really quickly. “Same as always?”
“It's the closes place to the Slave Control Offices.”
For a moment John even has this batty idea that Stacy must be the purpose of their outing. But what kind of interest could a young female slave be to Sherlock? Perhaps it’s her owner?
“That's not what I'm getting at,” he says.
Despite his enthusiasm, the fate is decidedly against Gregory Lestrade passing the next inspection successfully because just as he’s achieved his peak in whipping up some serious statistics about sexual assaults, there's a knock on his door jamb – a decisive knock – some blockhead of a subordinate, no doubt.
Beside the bed, in a low and obviously uncomfortable armchair is sitting, wrapped into a grey bleak blanket, a gloomy and rather dishevelled figure of Mycroft Holmes himself. Sitting. By himself. And he must have been talking too not a minute ago.
“It's not sprained, you faker. Probably just pulled a ligament. Put some ice on it and let it rest.”
Hopefully John won't try organizing the escape by himself. He simply lacks the ingenuity and resources. He will fail and fall into the same predicament Sherlock's in. That is unnecessary.
“A little help?”
'That's it then, isn't it,' John thinks sadly. 'That's all I'm good for now... I'm gonna let them down.' But he can't even remember of who are the 'they' he's letting down or how exactly is he doing it.
Sherlock smiles softly, takes a step forward, leans down, takes her face between his palms and gently kisses her forehead.
Sherlock returns home only after dark; John is home. He's lounging on the sofa, feet up on the coffee table, and reading
He leads her back into the kitchen. Reflexively Sherlock reaches for the old curved-edged fridge, but aborts – their landlady has such a sad pair of eyes on her that he suddenly remembers being admonished in childhood about eating while other people spoke about their feelings, even if his chewing adequately expresses his attitude towards them.
“Your earrings.  I apologise, continue.”
'It's fine,' Sherlock tells himself, 'it's for a case.' For an investigation. It's not him, it's another person lowering his head and walking near the walls, evading constables and drunken bullies. It isn't him  talking in a low voice and abasing himself in front of the bookie, placing a bet in John Watson's name. It isn't him standing at attention in front of a strange woman of forty (a journalist, successful, hiding an affair, probably with the editor of her magazine) and waiting until she finishes staring at him and puts a card with her phone number into the pocket of his jacket.
She has an American accent. Not surprising: a lot of slaves are imported from the Americas.
Nigmuff was the one that helped me to whip it to shape. She did *tremendous* work!! It's so much better now!
“Right. Thankfully, with restoration the psychological evaluation is not required, so it went rather quickly. And Sherlock also got a substantial compensation, so that’s something at least.”
“Yes,” John replies briskly. “He assists me at work.”
“Yes.” He purses his lips. “Of course.”
“Not right away. At first I worked like a horse – during my studies, then at Father's clinic. First I saved up to pay Father back and after... Finally I had enough to buy out a slave. Ten years had gone by and my brother was almost twenty, his market value was expected to drop. Adolescent boys are more expensive than young males. I went to Mr Osmani's audience and he even received me. He was very cordial, offered me a glass of cold water and told me that he would accept half of the sum he'd paid for my brother if he agreed to leave with me voluntarily. And then Mr Osmani called him in.”
Sherlock begins snickering again.
“I've thought it through. And while we're still in this flat I need your help with something.”
“What do you know about Doctor Rohan Desai?”
“Your master must be angry with you since it's the second time you're here,” she says with a sunny smile. “Our methods help to alleviate anger, teach you to control your breathing and your body. We are-”
“What would you say if I kissed you right now?” he asks, hoping his voice betrays nothing but cold, clinical curiosity.
Later these naïve conversations were forgotten. At least for most of them: one of his friends actually did dive into the Abolitionist movement head first. About a year ago he was caught by the other department and Lestrade was told not to be an idiot and pretend not to know him. He couldn't and naturally, the promotion passed him by once more.
“On your knees,” she says quickly and his knees obediently hit the floor before he figures out what to do.
John swallows and proceeds to rub his face with both hands. Everything blurs around him, the air swirls; nothing has any meaning any more and the refuge they had built together is crumbling down around them.
John doesn't stop to admire the view. Forgetting how to breathe, he scrambles down the stairs himself; his knees hitting the floor next to Sherlock, one hand checking for a pulse in the loon's neck and the other pressing down on his shoulder, lest the maniac try to rise.
“Hello.” The owner sets the bowl down. “Do you have an appointment?”
Sherlock, with his bruises, sore wrist, and probably still fuzzy head, cleaning out the rubbish from their living room, putting away books on criminology, packing box after box.
The dentist raises her eyebrows, but leads John into the kitchen without an argument. Sherlock has to stamp down an unpleasant feeling of unease. One part of it is the same primitive crap about his
“I feel it too,” Sherlock utters dully, “As if someone's watching.”
“How did you... What...?” Greg attempts.
If John found out about it he'd probably pull his lips into a polite smile and say, “You've never liked rules, have you?” Or perhaps he wouldn't smile. Perhaps he would sympathise – what a waste of emotion.
“Tell your master to call me. I have an interesting proposition.”
Sherlock manages to raise his tearing eyes and sees a muscular thug in the supermarket's security guard uniform standing over him. In his half-lowered hand he's holding a generic remote to a slave collar; scratched, approximately three years old, the battery lid fixed with a tape, at least ten different users. The so-called 'general frequency device', affects all standard models. They are usually assigned to security services, the police and fire departments.
Lestrade takes a moment. And then says with admiration, “You’re one bloody ingeniously cold-hearted bastard! And your brother is the same.”
“Please, Mrs Hudson,” he responds as gently as he can allow himself, “How could we possibly forget about our not-a-housekeeper? And her special recipe tarts?”
“Well, why not, indeed. I'm from India-”
Awkwardly he's carrying a tray with a tea set, which hardly corresponds to his expensive suit and the overall appearance of a good City lawyer (which he obviously is). Doubtlessly he earns enough for his lover (Dr Desai) to comfortably live in Chelsea, in a flat three times this big even if he had a wife and kids (which he doesn't). Evidently she prefers not to. Well, Sherlock had noted a strong streak of self-sufficiency and independence in her the first time they met.
The same old uncomfortable sense of dichotomy overwhelms him as he's looking at the alien face of the younger... no, he's probably the only Holmes now.
“I'm confused.“ Greg rubs his head. “I'm sorry, Mr Holmes, I'm getting too old for all this new nonsense. Access and passwords... What is this... device? Some kind of adding machine?”
“Clothes?” John also lowers his paper. Frowns. “Something for your escapades with disguises?”
“I've decided that so far we've both been carried away by the momentum and overestimated the seriousness of the situation for me, and underestimated it for you. Yesterday's disagreement clearly demonstrated it.”
“I...” He coughs, embarrassed. “Well. Remember I had your chequebook and you taught me how to sign it? I emptied the account the same day you were arrested. Figured they wouldn't have got to it yet... And the money could be put back at any moment. Came in handy, didn't it?”
“It wouldn't have been enough,” Sherlock argues. He isn't really interested in money
“I don't,” John replies, all but shouting at her 'Where is he?!' His heart rate is working overtime, trying to break out if his chest. “He's my sister's. She's asked me to... look after him.”
“John, I don't like to repeat myself. What are you thanking me for? For not putting up a fight while you save me for a change?”
Before, in this kind of situation John would have given Sherlock hell about the dishes. At least half of the mountain had appeared as a result of Sherlock's tests on mould samples, so
Then he immediately has to wake Sherlock who, heavily panting, is tossing around in bed. John is ready to be flung halfway across the room, but it isn't a post-traumatic nightmare, just an ordinary one, and so, when Sherlock wakes, he just jerks and stills.
“Lucy,” John mumbles, “You should probably let Dr Dobson know that I won't make it today.”
“I'm his owner,” John decides to tell her. “In the eyes of the law.”
Enjoy! :)
So in whose interest is it to besmirch such well-known names of this century of Britain’s difficult history? Let’s take a closer look.
The door to the kitchen closes and they hear running water. Now Sherlock finally has an opportunity to voice the reason he undertook this whole venture with the letter from Delhi.
“Not many people would dare to call a slave their fiend.” The doctor's honest eyes stare at him intently.
“But I don't need help,” Sherlock utters in a quiet voice, feeling a cold fury boiling inside him. “Every blow he delivers I receive with joy, because it is delivered with a loving hand. I love my master, I love everything he does to me. I'm a slave and that is wonderful: I don't have to make decisions, think about the future or worry about food and shelter. All I need is to please my master, and isn't it great that I can help him relieve his stress and help him let out his frustrations on me, instead of on himself?”
“Really? Then how come you weren't home?”
When the door closes behind John, Sherlock is struck by the idea that the best way to defend the fortress is to launch a counter attack. Taking refuge is good, but the time for hiding has passed. Actually, Sherlock doesn't spend any meaningful amount of time thinking about the theory of strategic warfare. He collapses on the sofa and concentrates on analysing their practical options.
Sherlock just smirks.
That time, he didn’t make it to the grocer’s, but knowing when John would be back from his shift, he did pop into the nearest diner for takeaway. The woman at the counter had smiled at him and shily tucking a lock behind her ear, asked, “What can I get you?” She was clearly interested. It felt unfamiliar and wild.
“Restoring the status of active citizenship,” Morstan nods. “That makes sense if they didn’t want to charge Winston officially.”
Sherlock's plenteous life experience hasn't prepared him for this kind of situation. He had never thought that this crowd would be worse than the recidivists with whom he'd been forced to share a cell or two in the past. Armed robbers and bandits did not end up in the 'general category'; they were sent straight to factories and mines. Therefore the set had to be compiled of former clerks (embezzlers and debtors), blue collars (domestic abusers), the homeless, most of whom would certainly be less vicious...
She holds out a card. ‘Society for Understanding and Accepting Spiritual Bonds’ it says. Sherlock knows this organisation: it has government funding to maintain a hotline for slaves and conduct group counselling sessions.
Greg raises his eyes, preparing to chastise the idiot, but stops short – it's Sherlock. How the hell did he even get in? Slaves are not allowed. Never mind, Sherlock's always managed to somehow.
“Morstan,” Sherlock interrupts John’s regaling of their latest, still unwritten, case.
“They knew?” If John were less exhausted, he’d probably be yelling.
“So, how did it go?” Morstan asks. “Any complications?”
When the phone rings, John is sitting on the floor, his head leaning on the bed (his and Sherlock's). Finally he's feeling almost comfortable and almost nothing hurts. He's thinking if it's worth getting up for, but then does and somehow crawls to the phone.
'I'm not going to buy the cigarettes,' he decides contritely, grasping the door handle, he'll just call his wife, he’s sure he saw  a long-distance phone somewhere...
With this mysterious phrase Sherlock continues cleaning. How happy John would have been to see that only a half a year ago! And how deeply he felt the injustice of the situation now. Wrong motivation. Wrong time.
“No, leave it. I've always liked it,” John replies and goes to make himself a cuppa. “Let's not overdo it. Otherwise we might as well move my stuff into your bedroom and leave you on a cot near the door.”
“I'm thinking of buying,” the man confides. ”In the long run it'll be cheaper than an employee, and it would add the prestige too. My woman hates slaves though. Convinced herself that males are all thieves and murderers, and she wouldn't tolerate a girl, you understand.” The barman chuckles, a deep belly laugh. “Yours is quite skinny though. You're military, right?”
The freezing cold of deep space, the icy chills of a new-found awareness paralyses his body; a queasy feeling is pulling at him with a hellish force, pulling him down towards mere mortals. Frantic, nervous energy pierces his body like a lightning. Mistakes happen. Even geniuses make them, but realising them gives you an opportunity to rectify them.
“Providing myself with an alibi and covering my tracks,” Sherlock all but snorts. “But I haven't told you that.”
“You said there were two distracting manoeuvres. What was the other one?”
Sherlock seems to take his words seriously. “It's not necessary any more, but after I tell you everything, I'll understand if you'll want to express your feelings... shall we say, in a physical fashion.”
“Do you have a disciplinary record from your university studies or from earlier?”
Nope. No. Fear rattles his body in waves; John wants to cower, coil into himself to hide his vulnerable belly, but he forces himself to sit straight. It's the chemicals, just chemicals. He just has to get through this and everything will be all right. It can’t be a criminal syndicate, because he hasn't been killed nor tortured, so it has to be special ops. (Mycroft? His thoughts are slow to move and it takes him a bit to realise that Mycroft's the last person who could have organised his kidnapping.) They are British, not Soviet though, so there's a chance that he can get out of it alive. Possibly not right away though.
“You can't?”
“You told me you trusted me,” Sherlock says in a voice devoid of any emotion. “I admit, might have abused that trust.”
“What dream?” John asks with a strange, irrational, and uncharacteristic to him, feeling of foreboding.
“Yes,” he hums shortly. “For the last four weeks I have received a large Indian pearl every Sunday. It's symbolic in a way, since I've participated in organising an escape route for slaves from the West Indies, but there's no actual link. As you can see, it's not just me who’s under a hammer: the operation was top secret.”
“Remember me? Good,” Sherlock says icily. “Let's get down to business, shall we? I need...” He throws a quick glance around the waiting room, but it's empty.
Being socially crippled and having limited access to public places hasn't helped either. John can't always accompany him and they haven't had the chance to acquire appropriate fake documents yet. Disguises are not sufficient. His connections have turned ephemeral like smoke going through Sherlock's fingers. He's started thinking that he'll not finish this before winter. Unpleasant, but he has to be realistic about his options.
“For not... not doubting me when I turned up there, with a collar in my hand,” John says finally. “It's just that when you fell on your knees, you had such an expression on your face that I... Well. It scared me. Doesn't matter...” The mug is almost banged down in front of Sherlock. “Drink your coffee.”
“You sound as if before the Moriarty case I'd been on the verge of ending our friendship.”
Unlikely, of course. In the life of Gregory Lestrade climbing out of windows has rarely been romantic. Never, in fact.
“You should get an X-ray,” John mutters, helping his partner climb the stairs.
“It's not lethal.”
’ (he does touch upon the topic in his last collection, which was published shortly before his death). However, some of the recent studies published have put their contribution under doubt. [JMorstan: either name works or cut it. I’d cut it.] I have to admit the revisionists have a point: any written source can be falsified, evidence can be contradictory and eyewitnesses are hard to come by so long after the fact. [JMorstan: Don’t put words into their mouths, they’ll chew you out. :(( Better quote something from Wilson.] Still, the current article has another purpose: It is to show how ridiculous it is to doubt the Baker Street duo’s role in the abolitionist movement is to those of us who actually were personally acquainted with them. [JMorstan: The ‘duo’ is just too funny! :) If I remember correctly DrW played clarinet?]
“Borrowed from Harry.” John shrugs. “She's more solvent than I am, so she took a loan. Mind you, we have to repay it.”
Unfortunately there’s only so far one can push it. It’s like fishing: once you get it on the hook – just hold on! Thankfully, when Sherlock calls him an idiot during dinner for the third time, John seems to feel better.
“I said that it was hypocritical of you not to remind me of the dishes, not that I will actually bother with washing up until there's a piece of clean crockery in the cupboard.” Then out of the blue Sherlock accidentally touches his loose tooth and curses.
“Perhaps...” John starts, glancing uncertainly between the cage and the half-open pub door, with a dim golden light and soft chatter coming through. “Look… You know, down the street...”
In truth, the elder Holmes, the bane of DI Lestrade's existence, looks like hell. His pallor is greyish white, there are bags under his eyes and his forehead is covered in sheen of sweat and he seems to be shivering.
“Clean this up,” the same voice says with disdain. “Give him an antidote and ditch him somewhere. I'm sure we don't need to worry about him causing us any further trouble.”
“The bruises are fading. I've been giving myself new ones – our kind landlady lent me some jars and spirit, but this method has its limitations. Besides, another visit to A&E wouldn't go amiss – the new flat is in a different part of town.”
He's straightening up from taking up the note, when the feline jerks and breaks free. John makes an attempt at grabbing it, but misses. When he starts standing up again there's a sharp blow to his solar plexus; his mouth opens by its own volition, his eyes tear up. It's impossible to react to anything now, he can't even grab the revolver at his back.
In short, by the time John is very professionally tossed out of the back seat he's entirely confused and hasn't even the slightest idea about his whereabouts. The only thing he’s sure of is that they had no time to get out of the central London.
“Now…” Mycroft Holmes sighs. “Tomorrow you are going to board a train and go home to England. And I am going to stay here. I’m afraid I have some health issues to deal with. And then… It seems I have some debt I need to repay.”
“And you'd really go with me?” Still staring at the ceiling, Sherlock furrows his brow, watching John from the corner of his eye. “You'd leave your name, service medals, your medical licence, and never see your family and friends again?”
“Nothing's broken.”
Amazingly enough, at the other end of the ice-covered plank is an attic very similar to the one Lestrade just left behind. The difference is that the room is filled with all kinds of radio- and communication equipment, behind which – again – a fairly young lad is making himself busy. What is this operation – run by a bunch of bleedin' kids?
, I seem to have sprained my wrist,” Sherlock's voice interrupts his resentful thoughts.
“Oh?” John smirks. “Were you hoping to involve Sherlock in your Movement? Or just raise a juicy scandal?”
That's where Sherlock almost loses it. Almost. But he does manage to stay calm and maintain his icy demeanour. Then though, for some reason he rises, covers the distance to the sink in few steps, and ignoring John's indignant shout, pulls the stupid plate in a blue flower pattern from his hands to throw it into the farthest wall. The plate flies through the whole flat and shatters near the creepy yellow smiling stick-man face.
Sherlock has – the door is wide open, the note missing. With his friend's name on the lips John bursts into the living room... only to find a grey cat on their bed, obviously well-fed and his coat shiny. John knows the cat: it belongs to their neighbour and despite home-breeding and a certified pedigree has an arrogance of a stray and an almost canine ability to open doors.
“Where is Sherlock Holmes now?” the voice repeats again. “When did you last see him and what did you think of his behaviour at the time?”
“Don't!” John shouts, darting after Sherlock. Too late -  his fingers close only a tenth of an inch above Sherlock's shoulder as he tumbles towards the ground floor. John can only watch helplessly as his friend and partner somersaults down, his arms protecting his head.
“I can't answer that.”
Then something rattles, trembles and a door slams open.
Her push at her instrument case is a bit harsher than necessary. “Do you expect me to tell you my life story now?”
“No idea,” John answers quite truthfully. “I don't remember, but surgeons somehow manage.”
“I know that Sherlock managed to get in touch with the abolitionist movement and do them a great enough service to ensure their help in transporting me out of the country. It was reasonable of him; they have worked out routes and procedures and have experienced operatives. I also know that he organised my escape entirely remotely while setting up a number of misleading manoeuvres himself. One of them was the murder of Lawrence Tucker, whose name you probably won't have heard. The fact that I am here right now and also that Winston's people let you go after a relatively short and painless interrogation shows that Sherlock's plan was at least partly a success.“
“Sorry, I... wasn't thinking.”
“Oh?” Sherlock waves his hand. “Immaterial.”
The man with the walking stick lets out a put-on sigh, as if wanting to snicker, but being too well raised to actually do so. “I know Holmes,” he continues then. “The little mise–en–scène, we just witnessed, means that he really is broken. Holmes is too proud and arrogant; there is no way he would step on the throat of his own dignity and just play at being a slave, especially under such a master.”
Speaking of the purchase.
The movement isn't very fluid: either his knees went numb surprisingly fast or he's dizzy for some reason. Immaterial. The nurse turns around and looks at them curiously.
“Operating under the enemy's nose is my brother's favourite method,” Holmes mutters. “Besides, there's a good chance no one will ever know that you left your room at all. You are sure to be watched, but this is probably a too simple way for them to discover. I deeded to see you. You are my only source from England right now.” 'To hear about Sherlock,' Greg translates. “Which after-effects are you experiencing?”
The topic is too horrible to contemplate, so John stops. Instead, he focuses on how to get the toxins out of his body as quickly as possible, because who knows what kind of shit is currently swimming in his veins... Especially since it's forbidden to use it on free people. It's probably morphine-based, at least that's what it felt like. In any case, he should be able to level out the symptoms by speeding up the work of his kidneys and liver.
Once she's finished, Sherlock turns to her (thank God the sedative hasn't affected his tongue much).
“The other one what?”
Familiar hands buckle the heavy collar onto his neck, trying not to touch him more than necessary. They brush a lock out of the buckle, and the oppressive weight settles on his neck. That's it. The end.
“They're fine.”
The lad is bent on destroying the incriminating evidence and Sherlock isn't inclined to allow it. John is on their heels, but still behind; even without the limp, his legs are much shorter. In truth, Sherlock is also lagging – the youth has developed an excellent speed; had the Olympic team accepted him in his time, it could now be performing with marginally better results and the criminal world could have had lost one of its followers.
Holmes smiles understandingly. “Thank you, Detective Inspector. I know.”
“What do you know about Mycroft Holmes's current circumstances?”
“He refused?” Sherlock clarifies.
“Bloody hell,” John moans, “So that's why I didn't tell them about Rohan and her lawyer! I thought it was a miracle or something. I even thought...” John halts, embarrassed.
“You may try.” The corners of Sherlock's mouth drop.
“Stop it this instant,” Sherlock warns him, “or I won't be responsible for my actions.”
Recently though, his behaviour has become even stranger: he goes outside more infrequently, and for some reason has installed security bars on his second floor windows. Her nephew claims that while climbing into the neighbour's garden (motivated by a healthy dose of natural teenager curiosity), he heard Russian being spoken by a male voice in the house.
“Sherlock, what is the meaning of this?” he asks in a quiet voice.
“It won't happen again.” He shakes his head once and turning to Sherlock adds, “Leave and wait in the corridor.”
“Interesting,” she utters. “About that dinner? Why don't you come for tea instead?” It doesn't look like she’s flirting though, and she continues, “Bring your friend.” She writes her address on a piece of paper.
Sherlock doesn't plan on wearing a disguise. They go to the A&E before John's shift begins: Sherlock's posture is tense, he walks slightly behind John, instead of next to him – which has now become customary, but usually he’d go on talking and generally behaving as if the pavement were narrow and it was too crowded. Today, though, Sherlock is silent and even keeps his eyes humbly on the ground. John has to constantly turn round to check if he's still there.
Once more Sherlock weighs both of their contributions to this operation and decides that perhaps John has a moral right to refuse to hit him if it's so difficult for him emotionally. In the end, his reserves are not limitless either. He even allows a working theory that the whole situation is worse on his partner than it is on him; Sherlock's not sure how to prove or disprove it or whether it's necessary. Perhaps it's better to just wrap the case up as fast as he can.
In the cab Sherlock sits in the font seat. The driver raises the partition between them and is trying to not look in his direction. Sherlock can live with it. In a way it's even pleasant; he hates when cabbies try to make small talk. John is very quiet on the back seat: doesn't fidget, is silent. Perhaps he's dozed off? Sherlock can't hear his breathing; the sound of an engine drowns it out. Yes, he did fall asleep; Sherlock has to pay the fare himself before jostling John out of the car. Apparently for John the previous days have been more difficult than for Sherlock.
in the room. Sherlock hadn't noticed that he's that far gone. Disgusting.
Sentiment: a dangerous ground. The edge of the cliff. What they're creating here, though: through the touch, sliding of skin against skin, through the sighs and soft moans, clenched teeth, and their irregular breathing, is far more than just emotions. Together they're creating a joint space which can only have one name – sanctuary. A refuge.
Not many people in the municipal building today: it's Sunday. A two-meter long strip of linoleum is missing next to the wall: there had been benches before, now removed. Immaterial. John doesn't limp. Usually there is an echo of it in his gait, but not now. Stress?
“Oh no.” Sherlock shakes his head. “If the body were mine, he’d be more likely to hold you for even more thorough interrogation. Tucker’s body, on the other hand, showed him that it was military intelligence who betrayed him to the abolitionists, because they didn’t need his intelligence any more. The abolitionist would hardly have given him away - they still needed him.
“We are fine, Mrs Hudson” he replies. “Do you think John would ever abuse his position? Or that I can't stand up for myself?”
And then it suddenly turns out that John is indeed a surgeon, not a simple medic. In reality he'd had the usual officer contract, had some medical training in a civilian hospital in Belfast and then he'd  already been trotting around with his platoon in the foothills of Hindu Kush. The only difference between him and an ordinary commando had been the green cross on his sleeve (which as opposed to the red cross does not offer any measure of protection). But in the dream it suddenly becomes clear that he did actually finish his surgical training and is now working in a field hospital, but in India, not in Afghanistan – because why else would the fresco of the goddess Kali with her multiple sets of arms be there?
“What? No!” John exclaims. “Don’t you think that would be going too far?”
Sherlock snorts, then grins and then bursts out laughing.
That's how they find themselves on a park bench in Christchurch Gardens. To be more specific – Greg is sitting and Sherlock is standing next to him, frozen, nervously fingering his collar.
“As I trust myself,” John answers without thinking.
John can hear a sincere amazement in her voice. Strange. He was sure the whole hospital knew. On the other hand, when asked, he always teld them that the J. Watson writing in The Strand is merely a namesake. Perhaps they believed him?
It isn't difficult to slip off John's radar while he's talking to Mycroft's doctor, nor is sneaking into his brother's room. It's a high-class institution with attentive staff, but the soft carpet muffles his steps and even the most competent nurse needs to leave their post some time.
No, that’s enough. Stop thinking about that.
And still the strange feeling of dread refuses to let up. John barely even succeeds in concentrating on his patients, instead he's staring at the clock. (Luckily, the life and physical well-being of most of them hardly depends on his professional zeal.) It seems as if Chronos (a time-walking fellow in the Greek mythology) has lead weights shackled to his legs.
Although Sherlock doesn't consider himself to be particularly experienced in displaying sincere feelings, he too leans forward, opens up, presses against John, holds on to his shoulders.
“And now it's also endorsed by the law. It's actually somewhat comforting.”
The octopi are now turning into a jelly-like substance and are slowly creeping into his ears. The sounds have become muddy and heavy.
Morstan’s office smells of cigarette smoke and whiskey. The lawyer himself doesn’t smoke, but it is the inevitable stereotype a successful lawyer has to pander to. Whiskey, on the other hand, is drank by John and Morstan both. Sherlock accepts a glass at first too, then after swirling the liquid back and forth for a bit, puts it down and walks to the window.
He does. “You know what's the beauty of this situation?” Pound asks leaning back slightly and shifting his weight onto his heels. “I don't have to listen to you anymore. Nobody has to. You're a slave, you can't testify in court, can't even prove anything. You want to try persuading your master to stick a lawsuit on me or go to the police – go ahead! Let's see what will come of it.”
There is another pub down the street, a bit more tolerant on the equality scale; no cage, slaves can wait inside and no one would even look at them askance.
“Thought you were a vegetable,” Greg blurts.
Mrs Hudson, panting, dashes out of her kitchen. “Sherlock! John! Boys, are you all right?”
“Oh?” Sherlock seems to be oblivious to the fact that John is already straddling him. “Any suggestions?”
“Who are you?” Greg manages.
The letter itself, in John's opinion, looks very strange: the envelope is of an unfamiliar yellowish paper, covered in fancy colourful stamps; the sender's address is written in symbols that look more ornamental than meaningful. At first glance John thinks it's Arabic, but later realises it must be Sanskrit. He even raised it to his nose when Sherlock wasn't looking -  for a moment he'd thought that it smelled of spices, tea and exotic fruit. Like greetings from childhood: from books about the treasures of Maharajahs and pirates.
They visit Dr Rohan Desai on one of those unbearably English October Sundays, when snow is in the air, early garlands have already started to invade shop windows and despite the refreshing frost, a sickly-sweet stench of consumerism is already spreading, disguised as a Christian holiday. The stars haphazardly scattered all over window displays, wreaths in scarlet bows, fake candy canes – the whole miserable collection invokes conflicting emotions in Sherlock.
There's a short pause.
Right now though, Sherlock's irregular behaviour is more or less understandable: he always behaves strangely after visiting Mycroft. John wouldn't make them go if he didn't know that no one else visits the elder Holmes. No one at all. And it's weird if no one visits you; John wouldn't want to be in his position.
“Not likely, I'm afraid,” the hard voice responds. “Your date of birth, Mr Watson.”
“It's about Mycroft. And by the way, don't be embarrassed to drink your coffee. You'll need all the clarity of thought you're capable of.”
“With all due respect, sir – are you sure it's not one of Holmes's distracting manoeuvres? The timing can't be a coincidence. Perhaps we shouldn't...? And that Detective Inspector in Switzerland... Just as a precaution...?”
TBC...
Well, he did start the contest himself... Sherlock holds his gaze with ease. With an exaggerated amazement he raises his eyebrow. He is a bit surprised by Pound's reaction; he thought the man more intelligent.
He could, of course, do both even in the woman's presence. Sherlock is his slave, his possession. People do get furious with their things and sometimes they get attached to them. The thought sobers him.
In the most ancient way possible. In the only way that matters. Blood and loyalty. Two against the world, backs to the mast (Sherlock snorts at that thought). Brotherhood of arms, partnership, unity. Does John realise that?
John takes several deep breaths. Through his nose. Then he tries to relax. Then he counts to ten. Finally when he feels less like beating the obnoxious idiot into a bloody pulp he talks. Slowly.
“Do you know what it says?” she asks, almost as if this were an interrogation.
John palms the fist in a calming manner.
He doesn't want to let go, he wants to bury his nose between Sherlock's neck and shoulder, slide his palms over the hard planes of Sherlock's back, gradually calming down his own racing heart – in short, do all those normal things people do when waking up from a bad dream next to their significant other.
The words are torn from his mouth before he has time to consider them.
But no, it turns out Sherlock's at home; he's vegging out on the couch, his wrist in a fresh white bandage and staring at the ceiling – everything’s just as usual. He reports that they took the X-ray and that there's no sprain.
“What do you know about Mycroft Holmes's relationship with his brother?”
“That the son of a bitch is manipulating me.” Greg lets out a string swear words. “That he's forcing me to break a law to organise his escape. That he wants me to do his dirty work for him.”
“There's no such thing as the truth serum,“ Sherlock huffs. “You were injected with some regular opiates, possibly mixed with something. And when they ask a string of rapid questions combined with confusing physical reactions... What else? Bright lights, disorientation – you were carried to the interrogation room, weren't you? Basically, it's a standard, but quite effective technique which gets reasonably accurate results, especially if the subject is unprepared.”
At times though, his perception expands into an additional, third dimension. The feeling is suffocating, as if a two-dimensional plain, full of steroids, is hopelessly trying to plunge up into unreachable heights, but lacking the required neurons it is utterly impotent to fulfil its desire. Right now, for instance, everything around Sherlock has turned void and hollow; a map of thin threads, an image as if from a bird's view, is laid out before him, absorbed through his skin: the room, framed with walls, floor and ceiling; the building's plan from above, the roof removed; the web of the streets outside. Multiple bodies bundled up into synthetic materials, linen, cotton, plastic and steel. Tiny, puny people.
Further she presents her case, which in itself, isn't worth much. She has a nephew who's been living with her since adolescence (the aunt saved the child when the separating parents were trying to force their parenting responsibilities onto each other). Their house is a small building at the edge of a village, and their neighbour is an elderly gentleman, extremely reclusive, thought weird by the rest of the village because of his perpetually plastered fingers.
“No.” Sherlock waves with his hand. “Don't do that.”
Every question feels like tentacles of an octopus on his body. John has no idea if he's hallucinating or if they really breed the rubbery little buggers in this basement. The vile feelers are trying to force themselves into his mouth and nose, jab him mockingly in the corners of his eyes, their object obviously tearing the glass-like organs out with their muscles and nerves intact. But when John closes his eyes they blast the bright light in his face and tear open his eyelids.
A couple of careful bets in races – he'd have to go to the bookmaker's himself though, John is too impulsive a gambler. Nobody looks twice at a collared slave conducting his master's business.
“You've been injected with L-311, Mr Watson,” says an unpleasant, disembodied voice from behind the wall of  white light. “Don't fight it or it will damage your cognitive faculties. Using this serum on free citizens is not usually allowed, but in your case there are extenuating circumstances. In a few minutes you will experience the full force of the serum and speaking an untruth will not just be painful, but impossible. Please, don't torture yourself.”
Well, Sherlock decides he’s not going to take it anymore and goes downstairs.
“Don't be silly,” Sherlock responds irritably. “We're not letting this flat go. Some random nitwits going through my things is all I need. Mrs Hudson is informed.”
“I've boxed you in,” Sherlock repeats grimly. “You can't start a family or even a relationship.” He slides off his coat and hangs it behind the door. “You can't move flats because it would be problematic to find a landlady with a similar attitude to slaves and me in particular.” He draws a key form his suit pocket, swiftly unlocks his collar at the back of his neck, and carelessly deposits the device on the shelf. “You can't lead your own life, because I neither have proper freedom of movement nor can I act independently without you, both of which I need for my work. You can't even have any guests over, because every woman would immediately start wondering about your life choices and the way you manage your movable property.” There's contempt and bitter irony in Sherlock's tone. “It's a dead end, John Watson.”
My special thanks go to Charlotte who beta-read the chapter and made it readable. All the remaining mistakes are mine.
Boredom. Boredom and vulgarity.
Already in the doorway Sherlock hears the nurse say, “I'm so sorry, sir. I know I took some liberties with your slave, but...”
No point in being frightened - it's all over anyway.
John, however, has always had the silliest ideas about the nature of duty, and in the current circumstances Sherlock prefers to compromise. Besides, what he can't admit even to John is that as soon as he crosses the threshold of the medical facility he starts feeling the pull towards his brother's room as if drawn by a magnet.
“No one's here,” Sherlock waves away his worry. “But for a change, you're right. Let's wait with the conversation until Baker Street. We do live there still?”
“No.” Sherlock cuts him off. “I suggest you take your pills. Half the usual dose; you're tired enough for that, and tomorrow I'll need you at your best.”
“Might have?” John raises an eyebrow.
Apparently, she knows. Well, Sherlock, why didn't you say something?
Sherlock turns away from the window and makes eye contact with John. John is not smiling, but it’s plain to see that he approves.
“Because I owe him,” Greg spits out. “He got me out of trouble when I...” He pauses.
Sherlock sits easily, naturally, not trying to seem more relaxed than appropriate in the company of mere acquaintances in a comparable social situation. He takes out the key and with a practised movement unlocks the collar, putting it on the coffee table in front of the sofa.
She steps so close to him that she has to raise her head to see his face. She's free, which means that the next thing she'll do is to ask him to bend, check the name on his collar and ask for the telephone number. People have tried to borrow him like that before: two men and one woman. One man and the woman had sexual goals and the other man was a photographer in need of a model. This woman, however, doesn't do anything of the sort. She smiles at him and says, “Hello.”
