“Yes, I think that’s why she wants to come, in fact,” Sherlock replied sardonically. He wrung out the towel and dropped back to his knees in front of John.
Sherlock’s fingers were now carding gently through the soft hair at the base of John’s cock. He dragged his lips down John’s cheek, stopped to place a delicate kiss on the tip of his nose, then found his mouth again, kissing softly at the top lip, then the bottom, then gently pushing back in between with a deeper, firmer caress.
“I guess we hardly ever use the whole space in our bed, anyway,” John said.
“Good morning, sir,” she said. “I’m the housekeeper.”
Sherlock didn’t reply, but dipped his head to kiss him again, eagerly drawing him as close as he could. John’s mouth opened underneath his and he let out a little sigh, and the tugging sensation in Sherlock’s heart burst open into a bright-burning flame, pouring out of his chest and streaking across his nerves and firing up at where John was pulling him close by his shoulder blades, where his chest was pressing up against Sherlock’s, where his lips were moving so sweetly and lovingly against his own.
I don’t have to remind you that I’ll be needing you in my office to complete all the necessary paperwork concerning your activities of the past couple days, now do I?”
is our primary goal, we really must meet them on equal ground. Let’s not forget that our own government has some atoning to do, as well.”
Even his insufferable brother couldn’t get in the way of that.
“Yeah,” Sherlock muttered back, resigned. “Yes.”
John let out a breathless laugh. “You say it almost every day.”
John sighed, rocking back and forth on his heels.
“Have you gone
John immediately felt chills run up his body, and he began moving to extract himself from Sherlock, so he could close the window. Before he could, though, a particularly strong gust burst through and pushed it even farther open, and its pane smacked against the wall.
, he’d think,
“Mmm,” John moaned. He wasn’t sure he could manage anything more, now. He reached his hand up behind him, trying to find Sherlock and hold on, and Sherlock grabbed it and laced his fingers with his.
Then something brushed past John’s foot, and he jumped.
“I think you’d better always look like this. I can’t be seen going around with an old man, after all.” John could feel the corners of Sherlock’s mouth quirking up into a grin against the side of his neck.
“Now, you can cooperate and give us the files,” John said quietly, his voice even. “And we can take you to Scotland Yard and let you plead for a reduced sentence. Or, if you’d prefer, you can make this difficult, and we can get the coroners to pass on the files for us.”
Sherlock slowed his movements a little. Then after a second, he leaned in further, his lips close to John’s ear.
He was doing it again – saying things that were totally unlike him, but with such conviction it sounded as if he’d been saying them for years. He laughed a bit, feeling wild and elated, but Sherlock just rolled his eyes and turned back to the window.
Verusha Sokolov embodied every twisted, unfeeling, reprehensible trait that Sherlock despised about underground criminals. She appeared to be a sort of matriarch to a rival family of the victims, and her name had been showing up on suspect lists of gruesome murders for the past decade. She’d stood trial on four occasions and been miraculously acquitted on all of them due to lack of circumstantial evidence, no doubt a testament to her own skill and repulsive intuitions about dealing with crime scenes and fallout. Other times, she’d been listed as a suspect and scheduled for trial, only to have another Sokolov come forward unexpectedly and confess to the crime. Years ago, Sherlock might have admired her for her ruthless brilliance, but since his experiences with Mary and Moriarty he’d found himself rather put off by psychopaths. Especially those who thought nothing of selling out their own family.
“I was wondering if you’d like to dance?” she asked, very quickly.
Her nose was a bright red and her eyes watery, but other than that she didn’t look too bad. She’d probably get over her cold in a few more days. It was just really bad timing, honestly, that the worst of it had hit her on the day of Mike Stamford’s wedding.
Sherlock sighed deeply, and leaned his forehead against John’s, allowing his eyes to fall closed again. He melted into John’s touch, feeling in the warmth of his body so deeply it was as if he were absorbing it.
“– I know this is bloody selfish, but –”
“Threatening?” John chimed in, blinking.
“Don’t be like that, he’s obviously going to be the biggest hero,” Sherlock grinned.
“Sure they were,” John said, holding back giggles. He looked up at Sherlock. The muted white light of the street outside danced in his eyes, like trails of snowflakes. “Just ask Mrs. Hudson.”
“And coming up later this morning, the bad granddad of rock n’ roll, here at 10:30. Do not switch off.”
“I know,” John said. He wasn’t looking at any of them, fumbling in his pocket for what little American money he had. He threw a couple bills down on the table. “Sorry, ladies. Have a Merry Christmas.”
He waited.
“And so the feeling –”
He bucked his hips into the pillow, his cock rutting against it, and the friction was just this side of too rough, but he didn’t care. All he could feel were Sherlock’s fingers stoking the fire inside him, every sweet stroke against his prostate making him shudder with feeling.
Sherlock started toward the door and reached out for the handle, but his fingers froze in the empty air. He hovered there for a moment as his heartbeat evened out again, and then slowly, slowly curled them into a loose fist, sighing as he dropped his hand to his side.
Behind him, he closed the bedroom door halfway, and stood completely still until he heard John tramp down the stairs. Then he sucked in a huge breath, shaking on the exhale and feeling his entire body tremble.
“Yeah, I’m not standing up again.”
“Sherlock…” John whispered. It was barely a sound.
Sherlock nodded curtly in response, and they set off down the main road together. But now every step felt laden with purpose, with slowly building energy, with a need to get back to the hotel
, he was sure it would kill him. “Please, just…tell me what we’re supposed to do now, because I truly have no –”
Dimmock soon gave up and sulked away to try to chat up an officer Sherlock recognized from the regular night shift. Meanwhile Sherlock was scanning the room and halting on some other familiar faces; a few DI’s, a chief inspector, some of the forensics team, the chief superintendent – none of whom Sherlock was especially keen to make small talk with.
“Oh, shut
“John!” He surged forward again, but could only stumble. “
Sherlock didn’t move. He didn’t even put his violin down from where it was still wedged tightly under his chin.
before the sight of those wanton blue eyes drove him out of his mind. He tugged at the base of John’s neck and whispered hoarsely, “John,
“Oh, love, thank you.” John met Sherlock’s eyes – full of fond affection – and stretched up to kiss him once more, chastely, before taking the box and pulling at the ribbon. “You didn’t have to, you know.”
“Oh.” John could hear the dejection in his voice. He forced his face into a neutral position, and stood up, too. “Right.”
he’d needed to say it.
It may have been Sherlock’s irritation at his brother’s spectacularly poor timing, but Mycroft seemed particularly insufferable today. Sherlock swore that half the documents he brought to them weren’t even necessary, just his attempt at petty revenge, and sun had dipped below the London skyline before he’d finally gotten everything he needed.
He shifted upwards on the bed to plant a hard kiss in the middle of John’s forehead. He moved down, did the same at the crease of his brow, making John suck in a hard breath. He felt himself shaking as he laid kisses on each of John’s closed eyes, then finally shifted back to seek his already-parted lips.
The patterns of moonlight on the water flicker and waver as they rise up to his shoulders. John hates the way his eyes are drawn to them, the way they morph themselves into hearth fires and gentle warmth, the way the ripples pattern out the familiar walls of Baker Street, the way the
“Right,” he said, softly.
John watched, and watched, until Sherlock had rounded the corner towards the station and had disappeared from his view.
Sherlock grinned back, and set the mug down in front of him. He grabbed John’s last mug, nothing but dregs left in it now.
John moved back to kiss the head again, but this time with an open mouth, laving and lapping all around it, leaving a dark wet spot on the soft fabric. Sherlock was letting out soft moans in quick succession, struggling against John’s grip on his hips, seeking out the heat of John’s mouth, needing direct contact his skin, just needing
“This is insane,” Sherlock said at last.
Sherlock kept the camera steady as he ran his other hand through his hair. His hunched shoulders were beginning to ache, but he didn’t have the energy to sit up straight. All his faculties right now were reserved for John.
But then, Sherlock hadn’t been the most objective observer, had he?
“That was a good night,” Sherlock said evenly, as he undressed in their bedroom, later.
The three of them looked up from their conversation. Sherlock could detect their pitying caution out of the corner of his eye.
And then, finally, he broke into laughter. Sherlock joined him, ringing out beyond the water and into the grounds beyond.
It was the new recording studio today – the one with the mixer who liked to scowl and roll his eyes a lot. Sherlock had already been dreading this session, but the sight of him there in his stupid red baseball cap was putting Sherlock off almost as much as the peppy backup singers to his right doing their awful swaying dance, or the synth-heavy opening to the track playing in his ears.
“Yeah.” John’s voice was lighter now. “He gets like this before every Christmas – I think it’s all the Father Christmas-related cons going around.”
“Hello, John,” Sherlock said, surprised to hear himself speaking more softly now. He offered his hand, and John shook it, once.
They were throwing themselves off the pile, one by one, on the breeze that was carrying them out towards the pond.
“Oi, shut up, I want to see it,” John said, laughing. “Out of the way, come on.”
“Love, please…” John’s hips tried to rut forward again, but Sherlock’s hands on his arse held him firm.
“John’s going to America.”
“– can’t just let you be alone in this –”
Sam bit into a biscuit with a toothy smile.
The breath seemed to leave his lungs, and he ran a trembling hand back through his hair.
He shut his eyes briefly to fight back the dangerous prickle welling up behind them. His attempts at keeping his breathing even were faltering with alarming speed, picking up towards full-body shudders.
“Uh, lots of kids watching this show, Sherlock!” said Spiky Hair behind him in a desperate rush.
“Hey, Sherlock,” John replied, startled and a bit high-pitched.
Something jolted just beneath Sherlock’s stomach at the sly little look he was giving him, and he had to force it aside.
Beside him, the door opened. The driver stood expectantly beside it.
“Yes.”
The office had barely quieted down, ministers and secretaries bustling all over, retelling the incident with every combination of exhilaration and anxiety possible.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah,” John said, quietly. He was still thinking about Sherlock’s last picture, with the pair of lovers under the night sky. “I know what you mean.”
“Yeah, it was unbelievable.” Lestrade smiled at the memory. “Normally teases her like there’s no tomorrow, but the
“Harry, that’s enough,” John cut in firmly. He glanced back to the kitchen, but Sherlock had moved further in to where John couldn’t see him.
The next day, Sherlock marched into the music teacher’s classroom with his violin and the sheet music already printed out, sat down, and started playing as soon as she opened her mouth to protest.
John was in there.
A few ministers on either side of him gave little grunts of agreement. Some people were scowling, or shifting in their seats.
Sherlock’s mind whirled. Surely John hadn’t been working himself
John beamed at him, reaching down to take Sherlock’s hand and thread their fingers together; the other hand coming to rest in his pocket where the watch sat, heavy and shapely and perfect.
“I’m well enough,” John whispered back, lips seeking out Sherlock’s skin again.
If you're a fan of the movie, you might not recognize this story, and that's because it was written and filmed but deleted from the final cut. It was a minor subplot involving the headmistress of the school the kids go to (played by Anne Reid) and her partner, Geraldine (Frances de la Tour) who is dying of cancer. Personally I don't begrudge its absence in the film, but it's a nice story and I wanted to include it here. Though I have of course made my usual modifications, because it's Christmas and we deserve happy endings.
“Love,
“You doing okay?” John asked him out of the corner of his mouth.
“Oh, nothing at all, it’s just that I’ve heard from Detective Inspector Lestrade that you’re back in London now –”
“Nice.” Lestrade said. He’d found them in the crowd too, and was watching them. “I suppose it’s
It was stupid. Utterly moronic. They’d been
“Goodnight,” John said again.
The notes trembled through the air, highs and lows following each other in elegant crescendos. The pitch was bright, but Sherlock played slowly and it felt slightly melancholy, the joyful trills tempered by the pace, its pretty refrain reigned carefully into submission.
John placed a gentle hand on Sherlock’s forearm and stretched up to give him a kiss on the cheek, then turned and made his way towards the forensics team who were chatting in a tight group.
Sherlock held himself there for a moment, then pulled back. John looked up at him. His eyes were sparkling in the lamplight.
Dad’s laughter died away in an instant, his face schooled into seriousness once again. “Ah, right. Okay.”
“Doesn’t mean we’ll be able to find the video, though.” Sherlock broke their gaze and ran an anxious hand through his hair. “I searched around when you first called…”
“Hey, I don’t care.” John stroked soothing circles around Sherlock’s back, and dropped a kiss on the skin closest to his lips – which happened to be the middle of his scrunched-up brow, right above his nose. “As long as you’re here.”
“Thank you very much,” he replied. At least he managed to keep his voice even there.
“Ugh, tastes like it, too.” John choked out, swallowing it down with difficulty. It was like forcing down bile.
There was just so
“Really?” Magnussen’s eyebrows raised slightly behind his circular glasses. “I’ve never found that.”
He shook himself out of the moment. He could come back to what he might have heard later. Right now, there was more pressing business.
“Oh, Jesus.” The guards were there. Four of them, and they did
“We’re going to the school,” Sherlock told the driver as he started the engine. “It’s – um…” He looked at John.
John moved to the other side of the room, unlatched the French doors that led to the acreage out back, and pushed them wide. Sunlight flooded the shadowed room. From here, John could see all the wide space laid out before him – the narrow porch, the path down to the little pond, the trees dotting the surrounding grassy field and growing thicker to form the woods beyond.
that videographer, to make sure his work was up to scratch. “I’m sorry.”
, he’s hardly qualified to get you better. What if he buggers something up and you can’t fix it, or something goes wrong and he’s not here? It’s not like he can wait on you every minute of the day, and he can’t really be doing it
And then he was kissing him again, that quiet hunger never leaving his movements, as he gently took John’s hands and led him toward the bedroom.
Sherlock took the x-ray with trembling hands, and John leaned in, his body moving seemingly of its own accord. And surely enough, there it was, that dark mass in the middle of the outline that was Sherlock’s torso, still there but
“John…”
pulled up to the hotel. Sherlock thanked the driver as briefly as possible, and then shoved some rubles in his general direction. The driver took them, eyed him suspiciously, looked briefly back and forth between him and John, and then with a small sneer turned around to face the front again.
“Thank God that’s over,” Sherlock said with a sigh. John wasn’t sure if he meant driving with Lestrade or the whole Dartmoor thing in general, but John nodded in agreement.
The nights were the worst. Sherlock could have maybe endured the wild goose chase, alone, across the dismal underbelly of an unfamiliar city, if only he didn’t have to return to an empty hotel room afterwards. The room itself was nice enough – the result of Mycroft’s placating efforts – but the lack of John in it made the unassuming grey walls and the pleasantly average artwork feel dreary and unforgiving. The luxury of a private space in which to work and rest felt instead like a dark cavern, without even the barest sign of life to comfort him in his solitude. He dreaded nightfall, when, after a few grudging bites of sub-par room service and a chilly telephone briefing with Mycroft, Sherlock had nothing to do but crawl beneath the sheets and try to block out the silence until morning, feeling unreasonably cold and anxious in the far too large and far too empty bed.
“You really want to know?” he asked him. His voice rasped a little. It had been a while since he’d spoken last.
“John?”
“Food?” he said, simply.
He took hold of the steaming cup of tea, and sipped at it.
Then a faint rattling sound came from beyond the door at the end of the room, and it swung open to reveal…John, pushing a rolling cart laden with cups and teapots.
Sherlock said nothing. He hated how worried he looked, but could he really tell him?
But then, a cluster of voices stepped up from behind him, and he looked over his shoulder.
Sherlock finally came out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around his waist.
John saw Sherlock and smiled at him, moving towards the front where the main camera was set up.
Still shaking, though he was sure it wasn’t from the cold, John pulled his other hand out from behind his back. Grasped in it was a large bouquet of flowers.
Sherlock leaned forward, and John titled his head to meet his kiss with eager lips. Sherlock delved in with just as much enthusiasm as before, and John dipped his tongue back in, picking up his exploration where he left off. Everything else was falling away again, and there was nothing but the feeling of Sherlock, here and now. They might have never stopped.
“Problem?” he asked.
Sherlock had the sudden urge to hurl the coffees through the glass at her.
“Orlova.” He breathed back, barely audible even to himself. “Sokolov knows about the alarms, she wouldn’t just come in through the front door.”
Sherlock couldn’t bear to think about that, the grateful, oblivious expression that would settle on his face. He scrubbed harder at the baked-on grease in the turkey pan and tried to block out everything else.
“But understand that you’ve done all you can do,” the doctor went on firmly, not relinquishing his grip. “The doctors will take care of him now, and I assure you that we will be doing everything we can…”
was what Sarah didn’t understand. He was already in too deep to display any semblance of charm around Sherlock. Just
ran forward, leaping through the gate over the guard’s head.
“John…” He breathed his hot breath against John’s neck. “John…”
, he told himself.
“I don’t know what I would have done.” Sherlock’s voice was breaking like glass.
Sherlock was trying not to give away how much his heart was pounding. The room was packed with people. Everyone had turned up; producers, agents, the marketing team, even a gaggle of old roadies had squeezed themselves inside to listen to the announcement, and Sherlock knew the whole place was about to erupt in just a few seconds, one way or another.
, I promise –”
His smile twitched up, subtly. “I have plans, and I intend to see them through.”
Sherlock didn’t let him finish. He dove back in, kissing him even more deeply than before, holding him so tightly and never ever wanting to let go.
“Oh, shit!”
Everyone in the place now turned to stare up at Sherlock. But they might as well have been the only two people in the room. Sherlock didn’t even seem to notice anyone else was there, anymore.
Magnussen’s eyes gave a strange glint behind his glasses.
“And the President,” he finished, stoically, “should be prepared for that.”
“Don’t…don’t show it around too much.” His voice sounded even, but it was so mechanical it may well have been someone else speaking. “It needs a bit of – editing…”
“But…” Sherlock was shaking his head, slowly. “But – they said I likely wouldn’t respond to the radiation.”
Sherlock pushed the icy feeling down from his throat. “Dancing,” he said, trying not to look over but unable to help it – they were still locked together, swaying less and less, mostly just staring at each other now.
dangerous
, when Sherlock saw nothing but facades everywhere he looked. Even sometimes in his own face.
Distantly, creeping in through some lone unidentified sense that somehow wasn’t occupied by John, Sherlock heard that the crowd had fallen silent.
“You’re looking very dapper for a man in his forties,” he whispered sweetly against his skin, and John burst into a low chuckle, leaning gratefully back into the warmth of his embrace.
“Already?” The driver looked astonished. “You were in there all of five minutes!”
There was no sound in the room – not even a breath. John couldn’t even feel his own heartbeat anymore.
He pulled him close again after he’d shut the door gently, threading his arms around John’s waist and holding him there, lips seeking out John’s with kisses so gentle, so full of tenderness that they made John want to cry out with feeling. Instead he kissed him back, pouring every fiber of his soul back into Sherlock, his heart swelling with emotion when he felt Sherlock giving himself in equal measure.
,” Sherlock choked out. “Oh, God, yes.”
Red – all he could see was red. Red on the glistening blade, red flinging out onto brick and asphalt, red pouring out through fabric and over skin and staining the night dark crimson.
“Bugger off,” Lestrade grumbled. His hand was already on the door frame, waiting to shut it after them.
John started so violently he had to duck his head and suck in a steadying breath. “Sam…” he said, too breathless to sound admonishing.
“Uh – yeah,” John heard himself mutter back. His mind was spinning again. “We could –”
Warning this chapter for discussions of alcoholism, and references to past drug use.
“It has to be,” Sherlock added, and began to speak very quickly. “It’s the only possible explanation for the victim’s shirt being starched with –”
He willed, begged,
everything John needed at any given time never stopped being a mystery to him, and it was one he never tired of trying to solve.
A couple older kids stood there in a corner chatting there, but Sam wasn’t among them. John sighed and decided to go check outside, but just as he turned around, a body appeared out of nowhere and collided with him, roughly.
John sighed once more, stretching out his arms and running his hand through his hair. It was silly, he knew, to be so impatient; he reminded himself that he was lucky to be alive, even, and that he’d have all of his life back, all of
“This is shit, isn’t it?”
no, don’t do this, please don’t do this, please please oh God please…”
“Oh, ha ha.” John said back, though his other arm tightened around Sherlock’s chest affectionately.
Prime Minister Holmes and President Magnussen stepped into the room, to flashbulbs and reporters and a crowd of eager listeners, microphones and notepads at the ready.
All your comments are very much appreciated :)
amounts of paperwork and fact checking to do…
This was absolutely not what he needed right now, but they were all looking so hopeful.
John turned. A stunningly beautiful girl sat at the other end of the bar. A few strands of brown hair framed her face where it peeked out from the fur-lined hood of her winter coat.
“He’s in my classes,” Sherlock said excitedly, sitting up straight on his knees and facing his dad. “He’s got blond hair and he’s really smart, and he plays on the rugby team and he’s the
He raised his fist up, and mimed a stabbing motion, then held an imaginary magnifying glass up to his eye and looked around.
For Christmas Eve at the surgery, it was surprisingly busy. Everywhere, children with colds, harassed looking young adults, people not much older than themselves leaning on canes and complaining about various aches. John didn’t envy the doctors on call tonight – it was going to be endless.
As he approached the office again though, he slowed down, then stopped at the end of the row of cubicles. Through the glass paneling he could see John at the desk, and Mia standing there next to him. Her bright red nails were clasped around a stack of files, but her other hand was resting on the back of John’s chair. Actually, not resting so much as…stroking. It looked like a large spider, waiting to strike.
Sherlock smoothed his hand up and down John’s back again, a tender caress to ground him. John sighed into it anyway. He could feel the reverence in it, the devotion.
“Oh, John…” Sherlock whispered.
“Yeah,” John replied, his voice brighter now. “That’s okay.”
“Hey, Sherlock,” he said, looking surprised. “Can’t sleep?”
,” Sherlock gasped out. He sucked in a few more shuddering breaths and raised his head. “I know that, I do. Of
“Oh, John…”
He quickly pulled it over his head. It felt like the memory of a warm hug, the gentle wool against his skin and the lingering scent of John enveloping him in its comforting touch. His whole body seemed to give a little sigh of relief.
The pit in John’s stomach seemed to engulf him. It might have expanded out from his body entirely, consuming the bright happiness that had infected him just moments ago.
It was magnificent, and transcendent, and it was everything John could have dreamed of and more. Sherlock was warm, and smiling, and he was holding him close and delicate, like the moment was wholly sublime.
“Alright,” he acquiesced, stopping them at the end of the rows of glass cases. “Keep yourself occupied for ten minutes, and I’ll go do the boring stuff for Mummy.” He felt dread stir in him at the thought. The women’s department was going to be brutal.
The nurse leaned over and told him to relax, began her routine assurances. John turned his head, struggling to get his eyes open, and grimaced in pain at the bright ceiling lights. “Where’s Sherlock?” he mumbled.
“You know…” Sherlock called out to him, as John paused in the doorframe and turned round. “Being Prime Minister, I
He shut his eyes against it, but it pulsed there too - red seeping through plaid cotton, red droplets spattering on black wool, red gushing too quickly like an unstoppable tide, too powerful to hold back.
Sherlock turned around, one hand on the doorframe, his eyes searching John’s. “Was there something else?”
“And it’s the first time all the local schools have joined together, even Saint Basil’s which is most –”
Sherlock dropped the pan into the soapy water, breathing in heavily through his nose. In the next room, Di had put on music, and a woman’s breathy, warbling voice was trickling into the kitchen – deep and mournful.
“Thanks,” John said, taking his coffee and pushing a few sheets toward Sherlock. “Here – you need to sign these.”
As soon as it clicked shut, Sherlock flung his face forward onto the desk. His forehead landed on his stack of papers with a painful thump.
“Almost certainly. Look.” Sherlock pulled out the chair next to him and sat, pointing towards a set of pictures taken at the last crime scene. “The last victim, Andrei Orlova, had distinct bruises around his neck – obvious strangulation. Certainly a risky way to murder someone, especially a mobster who’s likely to be a worthy opponent in hand-to-hand combat, and not typically the style of a contract killer. Therefore the murderer was deeply invested in the job, and was willing to take certain risks to make sure it was done as cleanly and efficiently as possible. That indicates a personal relationship with the victim, likely a vendetta, which says not only a rival family but a particular hostility of a hated opponent. We also know that eight other members of the Orlova family have died in the past three weeks – the murderer’s picking her way through their ranks, letting them know that no one is safe. That’s not the behavior of some underling with a superficial debt to settle, that’s a commander with an endgame. Most leaders in that position would delegate jobs like that, so as to not get their hands dirty, unless the ties ran deep enough for her to trust no one but herself to get the job done. It can’t be anyone but Sokolov – she’s the only one who’s skilled enough, involved enough, and we know from all these trials that she doesn’t much mind being recognized for her dirty work.”
just for the chance at some casual sex? John, that’s
“Good?” came Sherlock’s voice.
Sherlock’s eyes bored into his – the depths of emotion that had suddenly flooded back into them nearly knocked John off his feet.
There was a pleasant tingle against the back of John’s neck; Sherlock had smoothed his other hand upward, and was now threading his fingers through John’s hair at his nape.
He had to admit, as much as he loved the city or college, being away from home, he had missed it somewhat. The countryside especially, the wideness of it all. One could feel forlorn this time of year, in the vastness of the countryside when it was almost dark and especially when it was dark weather. He didn’t mind, he loved autumn and winter, with dark clouds or rain or snow. It often matched his mood.
John realised how stupid he was not to say something sooner, after all it was Sherlock who felt everything different than other people.
“Don’t speak too much Sherlock if you can’t just yet” John said.
Sherlock turned around ‘You must tell her, as much as it pains me. She keeps asking me every time over and over and I’m dying inside. John, I still feel so guilty, if I hadn’t… she still would have…’ Sherlock’s voice broke.
‘Harriet!’ Mrs Watson had tears in her eyes and a red face.
Sherlock was walking up and down with a screaming little girl in his arms. He had fed her, given her a new nappy but still she was screaming her head off. He didn’t know what she wanted from him. John was right, he thought, he couldn’t do this, he wasn’t good with kids, not even with this kid. He thought this one was different, that this one liked him and he liked her but the poor child was almost purple now from screaming so long. He tried to put her back in her bed but that made her scream more, if that was even possible. He picked her up again, whispered things like ‘there there’ and patted her gently on her bum. He paced up and down the floor with her and she calmed down a little bit but not much.
‘I brought champagne’ John said, ‘wait I’ll get us some’ John walked to the kitchen and poured two glasses.
John nodded; ‘I know, it’s just hard with Amelia being so young’
John was completely baffled by Sherlock’s text. He’d never sexted him before. He read back what Sherlock had texted and blushed. He had never shown public affection either and lately John had wondered if Sherlock was just afraid to. This text was a step in the right direction so he thought.
John kissed Sherlock’s curls and when he heard the slow breathing he left the room.
“Shh, just listen”
‘We’ll talk in the morning John. It’s alright; I don’t want to wake her’
‘Oh, come on, Sherlock’, Sebastian whined with his annoying voice.
John hid his smirk when he saw Sherlock’s face.
“She…!” Rosie’s voice came when she saw him.
‘Thanks Mary’ John nodded.
John grinned and opened the door for a baffled ambassador; ‘Good day sir’ he said cheerfully.
The nurse added some more pain medication into Sherlock’s drip.
‘Because Molly won’t let him’
‘It’s so hot’ Sherlock said while John noticed Sherlock sweating.
Sherlock looked up “That’s actually a splendid idea” he said jumping up.
‘Sherlock may I introduce the American ambassador…’
Mary hugged John before she walked out the door. ‘It will be okay John, children are resilient you know and ours is a superbaby’ She smiled and left.
John slipped in behind him and started massaging his shoulders. Sherlock leaned back with a sigh. John’s hands were relieving him of all the stress he had been feeling the last weeks, stress of unsolved cases, of difficult cases, of a sometimes difficult toddler even. Now, this week if only for one week, it was their time off. Now if only he could shut his mind off too, he thought. John was a big help though, John’s skilful hands which were now somewhere below his waist.
My eyes were filled with tears about the man I once knew when I drove home to my wife.
“No” Sherlock said “This young lady has a dinner date with Mrs. Hudson”
‘Have you called Greg?’ he hesitated to ask ‘or Mrs Hudson?’
Rosie sat and listened and looked at Sherlock now and again.
‘Hello, we’re here!’
Rosie looked serious “sss” she said firmly.
‘Who are you, my brother?’
John reached out and held the glass with the straw under Sherlock’s mouth so he could drink.
He grabbed Sherlock and held him close. “I’m not letting myself get shot, promise. I won’t leave you and Rosie, ever”
‘She’s going to make a fine detective one day’ Sherlock smiled.
‘Sherlock!’, Mrs Holmes ran out hugging her youngest son who pulled a face to his brother who was still smiling like the Cheshire Cat.
“I am capable of having feelings for my own brother you know.” Mycroft tried sounding indignant.
No, Sherlock thought, it was all in his head again. With all his brain or intellect, he was so stupid when it came to affairs of the heart. But in all honesty, how would you tell someone you really liked them? It wouldn’t be the first time that the other person would laugh in his face. It seemed that John liked him, but he wouldn’t love him, not like he would want to. He had to face it, he was falling for yet another man who didn’t feel the same. He sighed.
‘Look there is a tape for Rosie as well for when she is older to fully understand it’ John held up a tape named ‘Rosie’.
John sipped his coffee, the warm liquid seemed to calm his nerves; ‘I’m sorry Sherlock, I’m on edge for weeks’ he sat down at the kitchen table and sighed.
He packed the last of his things in his suitcase and walked downstairs to wait for Mycroft. He put his coat collar up against the icy wind. He looked at the clouds, snow was coming this Christmas. Great, that would mean he couldn’t probably go out for his long walks and had to stay in with all those people his parents had invited.
Sherlock closed his eyes and while Mycroft stood there watching he saw his little brother actually falling asleep which he hadn’t seen for a long time! He slowly walked out the room, turned around to look again at that peaceful sleeping face, his dark curls spread out over the pillow and said softly;
“She does”
‘Perhaps we should avoid frozen ditches next time’ Sherlock smiled.
‘You do, John?’ Sherlock’s eyes squinted ‘take a long walk maybe?’
Sherlock didn’t say anything anymore but his silence was enough. John’s eyes filled with tears again, he blinked so Sherlock didn’t see it, he had to be strong for him now.
“Yes”
“I heard, perhaps you should go”
He cried out; ‘Mary no!’ and felt the tears roll over his cheeks.
‘Sherlock always promises’ Mycroft said with a deep sigh ‘and who do you think is the one who can pick up the pieces after a broken promise?’
‘I rest my case’, his mother illogically said and stood up from the bed.
‘I love the snow, don’t you?’ Mycroft said. ‘It’s always so lovely at home in the country. Don’t get me wrong, I would not trade that for the city at any time! But still it is very lovely’
‘Mrs Hudson, the landlady, she lives downstairs. I helped her with something once and she told me she would keep a room for me and if I needed it, I should ring her’
“Well I can tell you she’s still one year old.”
‘Oh Sherlock, you know I will keep it for you’ she giggled.
‘Sshh John, don’t wake her, please’ Sherlock’s hand reached for his and squeezed him.
‘So, start your guessing game, Sherlock’, Sebastian Wilkes laughed.
They turned their heads to see the person that had come into the door.
‘I had a kick-ass mum!’ Rosie smiled then she skipped into the living room out the door and ran up the stairs to her room leaving Sherlock and John baffled of such insight at a twelve year old.
‘John’ Sherlock softly said, but John already walked on ahead ‘I have been so disappointed for so many times already, thinking this was the one’ Sherlock added, thinking John could not hear him. ‘I don’t think I can do that anymore, it would break my heart’
‘Oh hello John’ he said speaking slow ‘what brings you here?’
‘See you later Sherlock’ she waved.
“The irony” Sherlock said looking at the cane which was John’s.
‘You’re such a control freak’ he laughed ‘come here you’
“Hmm” was all the answer he got.
‘Are you alright?’ John asked.
‘A flat? Where?’ his parents seemed a bit too relieved Sherlock thought.
John watched Sherlock hand Rosie to Greg and Rosie grinning a toothless smile.
‘I will let you sleep now’ Mycroft said.
‘But where will you live?’
“Ah, yes, right” John said blushing. “Let’s eat shall we?”
“But if Sherlock…”
“It’s okay” the nurse said “it will come just relax. Nod if you can; are you in pain?”
So the next day when Sherlock needed to practice walking to keep his knee flexible they were talking a stroll outside in St. James Park holding hands.
‘Yes, can we go and look at the place soon?’
Finally he felt tired himself and decided to lie down on the coach with Amelia on his chest. He put his arms around her and she curled up, sighed and fell asleep on his chest. Sherlock smiled looking down on her. He gently brushed a tear away that rolled off her cheek, put his arms around her again, closed his eyes and fell asleep as well.
‘Not one of my finest moments but yes’ John said ashamed.
“Oh no problem dear, she is such a sweetheart”
‘Good morning, little brother’, Mycroft said with his Cheshire Cat smile, which was more of a grin, Sherlock thought, like it was plastered on throughout the holidays.
Mrs Holmes walked in, her arms crossed, looking stern ‘Sherlock Holmes, are you trying to say I am a nagging mother in front of a guest?’
John almost choked in his eggnog and laughed ‘You’re right, he is looking like that’ pointing at Mycroft’s frozen grin on his face.
Sherlock was frowning, his long lean fingers were pressed against each other and his jaw was clenched. John knew he’d best shut up when Sherlock was in a mood like this.
Mycroft took a book from a shelf, made himself some more tea and sat down in a chair next to the couch.
‘Thank you Mrs H’ John said and closed the door when she left.
“I am,” he said, a bit quieter, a bit more urgent. “I really, really am.”
Sherlock glanced sideways at him, saw that his Charming-the-Public smile was tinged with the barest hint of satisfaction. It made Sherlock’s skin crawl.
Slowly, warmth seemed to trickle up through his body – from the fire it travelled up his legs, into his chest, and from Sherlock’s arm around him it fumbled its way up his shoulder, through each of his nerves individually. Inch by inch, like gentle breaths of life, it surrounded him, siphoning away his swirling thoughts, his dark, desperate dread. It felt right, it felt familiar. Just sitting here, together, by the fire, like they did all the time. Like the feeling of Sherlock smiling into his temple, the scent of him settling around John like a warm embrace, was completely ordinary, and fine. Like it could all, somehow, be fine.
, and that ever-present continuing
Three words, bursting in a sob from his frail lungs into John’s.
“Yeah, go on.” John
“Oh.” John was momentarily struck dumb with understanding. “It’s – um –”
“I don’t know.” His voice was barely above a mumble. “I didn’t notice when we got here.”
he was. Sherlock smiled at the contact, picked up a fresh bandage and tore open the plastic wrapping.
– they were always here, every time Sherlock needed this place, needed something to sustain him, to pull him through the pain, the memories were always here, waiting to welcome him back with the warmth and comfort of home.
moment.
It was quick and friendly, but John still jumped back in surprise. Sherlock burst into laughter beside him.
, Sherlock thought, shaking his head. This was stupid. He was being stupid. It was just a dance. They were only dancing together, to a song that was an uncommonly slow one in the DJ’s otherwise bass-pounding playlist. It was just a friendly dance, between colleagues – just as he might have danced with Lestrade, or his sister – and she was only swaying her hips provocatively beneath where John’s hand was rested, he was only holding her by the hand as she moved closer and closer, she was only leaning and pitching herself forward, near enough to whisper in his ear –
” Harry whipped around, her hair flying around her face. “She’s giving me less than I’m supposed to have, I
The heat inside him roared up to an inferno. He was seeing stars. Currents of pleasure shot up from inside him, up to the tip of his scalp, as Sherlock brushed against John’s prostate.
“Right,” Mycroft finally chimed in, once Sherlock was able to get his giggles under control. “Well, I’ll get my things, and then let’s fix the country, shall we?”
“Come on and let it snow.”
made me strong,” John insisted, something heavy muffling the words in his throat as his hands clutched tightly at Sherlock’s sides.
To his surprise, John let out a breathless laugh.
“Get these off,” John whispered, tugging at the waistband of Sherlock’s pants, tented sharply at the front.
…” Sherlock’s harsh voice chanted, over and over, the heat in his abdomen ready to flare up, John’s sweet movements building his pleasure up higher and higher and oh, he was close, he was
With small, slow movements, so as not to wake him, John dislodged himself from under Sherlock’s arm and shuffled up out of the bed. He fumbled for a moment in the dark, found Sherlock’s dressing gown, and tied it around himself before opening the door as quietly as possible and slipping through it.
“As long as it’s not something I can’t part with.”
gleamed down on it from a sign. He was here.
His voice was suddenly quick and desperate, and Sherlock couldn’t take it anymore. He looked up into John’s eyes, and nearly flinched at how flayed open he looked.
“Well, you know,” John muttered, embarrassed.
He started telling Sherlock things he’d never told anyone else. Things about his parents, and Harry, about Afghanistan. About the book, and his fears that no one would ever read it. It was best when he drove him home, when Sherlock wasn’t busy with something else, and could listen and respond without interruption. John couldn’t be sure, but he had a feeling Sherlock was doing some unburdening of his own. And a sharp ache swelled up inside him every time that thought crossed his mind, because it only made him more desperate to understand him.
“Exactly.” Sherlock heart was pounding merrily.
let this happen –
None of the officers had moved; no one appeared to have noticed the gesture, or heard the endearment, and Sherlock relaxed marginally. John’s mouth was set in a firm line, and his gaze was trailing over the files without taking in any of the information. His breath was coming in twenty percent faster than its normal rate, and Sherlock
Dad’s grin split wide across his face.
Sherlock’s lips were set into a thin line.
“What are we going to do?” Sherlock whispered, hoarsely.
He got up, and strode toward the office door.
He nodded, and Sherlock broke into a grin. It made him look so heartbreakingly young and carefree that John thought he might collapse.
There was a heavy snowfall coming down outside, piling up against the windows where fairy lights twinkled in slowly flashing reds and greens and blues. But the inside of the flat was filled with an enveloping warmth; a soft red glow emanated from the crackling fire in the grate, and a few candles were littered here and there along the tables, giving off a sweet gingerbread scent.  Soft violin music was playing from the stereo, and the hearth and bookshelves were strung up with tinsel and some smaller lights, bright and festive.
“Yes, yes,” he said, absently shaking hands, and receiving enthusiastic thumps on the back.
The place was decorated with symbols of various local sports teams, and strands of tinsel had been hung up all around the walls. A pool table sat in the corner, with a few people clustered around it.
, plus he has a really nice singing voice…”
John’s shoulders slumped a little. He didn’t really cherish the idea of being there alone.
“The octopus costume’s taken me months,” said Julie. “Eight is a lot of legs, Sherlock.”
“Fish and chips?” he asked, brightly.
But the bubble of hope only had a couple of seconds to swell before John’s mobile vibrated loudly against his desktop.
His lips twitched upward at the corners, and for a moment his lined face looked smoother. Brighter.
But he couldn’t. He’d promised her. And even through whatever else, he’d always kept his promises.
“Sherlock – please – I need more…”
“Don’t you dare,” John whispered, with a soft grin. If Sherlock was comfortable sleeping with his whole body directly on top of him, so was John. It was perfect. Better than any blanket.
“Right, yeah, must have been this place,” John carried on, his lips twitching up at the corners. “You know, rabid dogs, murderous scientists…”
On the screen, Sherlock was telling some raucous, wildly fabricated story about a concert he’d given that summer, and Graham and the other guests were roaring with laughter.
But he hadn't been, had he? He hadn’t seen what was in the box John had put in his pocket at the store. He’d just assumed because there was no way John could have been buying anything else, no way John could have wanted
, that just made it even hotter. He was utterly at Sherlock’s mercy.
He heard footsteps coming up along the path behind him, and John felt his heart give a little spasm of excitement. He looked around to find Sherlock at his side, holding a fresh mug of tea.
The woman called Julie chuckled a bit. “Yes, we can see that.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said back, finally. “I can’t see why not.”
“Sherlock…” John breathed his name out like a prayer.
John moved off quietly to the side. It didn’t matter, no one was looking at him anymore. All eyes were fixed on the images flashing on the projector screen. Sarah, young and wide-eyed. Next, slightly less saturated, her in a wedding dress next to a man with long hair. Soon after, visibly pregnant and smiling, the next, holding the newborn Sam. They flickered on, getting brighter all the time, Sam aging rapidly through them like a time-lapse camera, until the Sarah in the photos started looking thinner and more tired, and finally ended on the photo of her and John at City Hall, just last summer. She was as pale as her dress.
“Let’s go get the shit kicked out of us by love!” Sherlock declared.
He twisted his wrist, and they moaned again. Sherlock kissed him again, sloppier now, mouth wide, breathing hot and wet onto his face.
He gave a side eye to the second host, whose eyes shifted awkwardly beneath his very artificially spiked hair.
, who had never
But then, the doctor was looking up, and his impassive face was wavering with the hint of a smile.
“Yes, well.” He led him round a corner and up a staircase to the first floor. “I suppose I’ve never found that politics and relationships really go together.”
“Right.” John could feel his cheeks reddening a little. “Well, anyway, it’s nice to meet you, Sherlock.”
John sighed. His gaze wandered down Sherlock’s frame, lingering on the way his shoulders jutted out beneath his dressing gown.
Sherlock had brought out candles, which were now burning on each of the nightstands. The lights were dimmed, and the flames gave the room a quiet, intimate glow. It was like stepping inside after a long day out in the cold, with a bright red fire in the hearth, waiting for you. Sherlock had folded the blankets back, leaving a stretch of bare sheets for John to lie on, and in his hand was a bottle of massage oil, which they’d bought on their last holiday.
“I’ll warm them up,” he said, lamely, but Sherlock smiled anyway.
Sherlock paused, breathing hard. He was still out of breath from his run.
Sherlock blinked for a moment. His hands twitched at his sides; he settled them onto his hips.
“Great,” John burst out in relief. “See you soon.”
“No, I’d – I’d better not.” Sherlock sagged into his seat. It was useless. “The last thing anyone wants is some sleazy politician stealing the kids’ thunder.”
“What the hell’s going to happen to me when I’m just sitting at home?” John smirked, then turned away so she wouldn’t see. He looked toward the kitchen where Sherlock was clearing away the kettle, and grinned when he caught his eye and saw that he was sniggering quietly.
“Well, let’s see it then.” He turned on the DVD player and placed it in the slot.
“Um…”
“Wait!” She called out after him, and he turned back around.
He headed into the sitting room – Sherlock was standing at the window, peering out at the street.
For once, they didn’t speak when John drove him home later. John kept stealing little looks at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye, but the silence felt unusually fragile, and sacred. He didn’t dare break it.
“He can’t do that – he’s our best waiter.”
“…but it’s Christmas, and I just wanted to…” John trailed off, giving a weak sort of shrug. “…check.”
John’s question snapped Sherlock back into their dark reality. Right. Case first. Sentiment later. “Yes, she should be.” He curled his other hand around the one still clutching his gun, leveling the handle against his chest and shifting to give himself a direct line of sight to the kitchen door.
talented musicians.”
“You really shouldn’t be taking personal calls at work, you know,” she went on, peering over her shoulder as she walked away. “Maybe I should make it an official policy.”
“Really?”
“Well,” he said, sadly. “I think I’d better not come in.”
come this far. “And we can talk about this state business…business…in the car.”
“Sherlock Holmes,” Sherlock said genially as he extended a hand.
Sherlock felt as though a weight had dropped onto his chest. Dad’s eyes were bright and earnest – he wasn’t wearing his glasses – full of a depth of emotion that Sherlock hadn’t seen on him in months.
Afterwards, Sherlock fell asleep tucked into John’s side with his arm slung across his chest, as he so often did. He wasn’t wheezing tonight either, no coughing, no pain of any kind to interrupt the evening. He was breathing deep, and silent, and to any untrained ear, perfectly normally.
Sherlock pushed open a door to where a few parents and kids were milling about, and suddenly heard someone shout his name.
He gave a half-hearted chuckle, but Sherlock obviously didn’t join him. He nodded, and sipped at his tea again.
The realization made his stomach sink, as he looked outside at the families crowding into the school.
captured his lips in a bone-deep kiss.
“Er – no,” John replied, with a little shake of his head. “There’s been a change of situation. It’s just me.”
together – and Sherlock had been missing him so much he could hardly bear it. Any satisfaction that he might have gleaned from deducing the hiding places of gangsters using little more than layers of dust on door hinges was immediately snuffed when he would instinctively turn around to share his brilliance with John and find only the DI’s stone-faced stare. The endless hours on increasingly dreary crime scenes were filled only with stiff questions from mind-numbingly stupid officers, and Sherlock often thought that he would give up any number of secret boltholes and missing corpses just to hear one word in John’s familiar, comforting voice.
John gave a nervous little chuckle in return, casting his gaze around, trying both to look at Sherlock and not look at him.
His heart in his throat, the moment seemed to stretch on forever – Sherlock’s hand tightening in his was the only thing keeping him grounded, the only real thing in the world, when everything else, the office and the ticking clock and the doctor rummaging through the file about to explode with the rest of reality –
He felt Sherlock swallow heavily as he laid kisses on John’s temple, on his fluttering eyelids. “You were so brave,” he whispered, thickly. “So brave, so strong…”
Then John’s phone buzzed, and Sarah rolled her eyes.
“I was hoping you’d win,” he said.
John trudged up the street, his arms laden with gifts.
He’d heard Dad talking to Mrs. Hudson when she’d come over yesterday. She was coming over a lot more these days, but Sherlock had been up in his room again and hadn’t seen her this time. It was all a bit too much for him, the soft words, the pitying looks. He’d left her to comfort Dad instead.
“Harry, stop,” John pleaded.
This case needed to be finished, and tonight.
“They’re healing well,” Sherlock said, beaming happily. His fingers brushed over the rough, knotted skin, the stitches barely detectable among the scar tissue. “Really well.”
The driver shrugged and set off. John’s heart thrummed in his chest.
Sherlock hunched his shoulders against the breeze. He tucked the cards more securely under his left arm, the CD player dangling from his hand below them. He walked slowly down the street, away from John’s flat. He was in no hurry to get home, and besides, he felt better now than he would be there. Almost…lighter. Not exactly at peace, he would never be that, but at least his mind had stopped spinning and was content to stay still for a while. He could be thankful for that.
‘Wow’ was all John could say.
“Come on Watson, breakfast” Sherlock picked Rosie up and put her in her highchair.
‘No’, Mycroft said pensively ‘you really didn’t but still, I am glad you are here’
‘Dr Watson, London is in need for doctors as well as you know, not only the army. The flat will be waiting when you return, if you want to of course’
‘Don’t you have an elevator in your apartment?’ the man started without introducing himself first. ‘You don’t even have a parking lot; I had to walk the whole block!’
“No, Angelo, not this time, it’s our anniversary. I’m paying everything tonight” Sherlock smiled.
Sherlock stood there watching as the bullet was fired and closing in. It was as if it came to him in slow motion. He couldn’t move, just watch. There was nothing else, not the shooter (Norbury) not anyone else for that matter just the bullet and him. Closer and closer it got, he should get out of the way but it was as if he was glued to where he was standing. When the bullet was mere inches away from his chest he heard someone screaming. He tried to look around but could not. Then someone pushed him and he fell to the ground. He looked up and tried to yell but it was too late. The bullet had already plunged into Mary’s chest. He opened his mouth and he was sure there was a sound coming from somewhere if only he knew who made that shrieking sound. He turned his head and saw Mary on the ground bleeding. She didn’t make a sound but there was a sound coming from somewhere, a wailing of sorts, someone in agony. The sound was heart breaking and he wanted to cover his ears so he didn’t have to hear it anymore.
He could finally pay his groceries and go home.
John bent down and took his pulse. He looked into his eyes and immediately took out his phone to call for an ambulance. He then turned to Mycroft ‘If we don’t bring him to St Bart’s now he may slip into a coma’
‘Isn’t that the Holmes’ cottage?’ the man asked ‘Sorry, I’m John Watson’, he held out his hand and shook Sherlock’s. ‘My parents are invited to Christmas dinner at your parents home. My dad knows your dad apparently’
“Chess?”
They got their coats and slipped away through the backdoor without telling anyone.
‘There, there’ Mycroft patted Sherlock’s back ‘it will alright’
‘How did that feel?’ John whispered.
‘Sherlock?’
Sherlock felt like a small child again, wanting to stick his tongue out to his brother for being such a well-behaved good son. It wouldn’t be long or he would hear it; ‘oh Sherlock, why can’t you be more like Mycroft?’ he hated that!
“How would you know, Sherlock? How would you know?”
Mycroft hesitated. “I was meant to tell you with Mother. Why don’t we –“
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. “I think we are both perfectly aware of what this is. Or have your brain cells suddenly stopped doing this brilliant job of theirs?”
Sherlock was terrified. He did not understand why he had to do this. In his opinion, everything had been going great in his life; he’d had some rather interesting scientific discoveries lately and only started to dive into all the interesting experiments there were. But apparently his mother didn’t think the same. And now he was stuck in this room with morons, one duller than the other. And all of them were staring at him.
They were also quite drunk, however. Sherlock barely drank, and John wasn’t used to it either for sororal reasons. They both knew they should go to bed, but neither of them wanted this evening to end. Suddenly John sat up.
He forced himself not to look at the boy to see if he was glad or disappointed at Sherlock’s choice. Better not to know.
Sherlock ignored him and pretended to be busy with scowling at some bad paintings on the wall opposite to him.
Instead of the two expected single beds, there was one single, big bed in the middle of the room.
“I’m sorry?”
“Do you want to introduce yourself briefly before we start?”
“So you are not going to defend yourself or Mother?” Sherlock asked suspiciously.
John raised an eyebrow. “Not the best – what was it – consulting detective out there, then?”
He walked down to the car deliberately slow and slid in after he made sure Mycroft wasn’t in it, something he didn’t expect but was always a possibility. The git never let out a chance to darken Sherlock’s day.
Not showing any of his inner conflict, he stepped toward his locker. Reaching for the lock, he dropped his bag on the floor. The other boy jumped and turned. He looked horrified; when he saw Sherlock, he visibly relaxed.
Almost smiling, Sherlock got up. Everything was better than being bored, and he could imagine less entertaining activities than picking a fight with Mycroft.
, he cursed himself.
Had there ever been a more obvious nudge from the fates? In any case, John was grateful. Smiling, he picked up the phone, ready to continue what they had started back in that hotel room. He couldn’t wait.
Sherlock stayed behind and pretended he was rearranging the contents of his book back. In reality, he didn’t want the others to see him getting into the pompous black car that was surely waiting for him at the front entrance. When he finally couldn’t pretend anymore, he got up with a sigh only to see that two people were still in the room. There was his teacher – Lestrade or something like that, not important – but more importantly,
He got another pitiful look from Mycroft.
you?”
The next days went by in a rush. Sherlock didn’t see, didn’t feel, and didn’t think. He felt as if his whole world had stopped moving; in a way, it had. John was gone
Now that was something people didn’t say all too often. Most people tried to distinguish themselves with secrecy and by creating mystery where there was nothing to hide. It was boring, and one of the reasons why Sherlock didn’t usually associate with others.
“Yeah, you’re right, if you think about it. But not everything has to make sense. I like football because it’s fun. But … are you saying you broke into school?”
“Jesus, you scared me! I didn’t hear you coming up – what are you doing here anyway? Isn’t the front door still locked? Or are you joining the team? Mind you, we could use some new players, even though I wouldn’t have taken you for a big football fan.”
Sherlock didn’t bother answering. He thought about getting a cup of tea before he left, but decided against it. He didn’t want to be slowed down on his first days of school.
Sherlock avoided his eyes and looked around. He lay in a huge bed, but didn’t recognize the room they were in at first. Then, “What am I doing at your place?”
Mycroft simply stared at him, visibly annoyed.
While fingering the lock, he answered the boy’s – John’s – questions.
Sherlock didn’t wait for his mother’s answer. He got up and fled.
There were a couple of bike racks next to the school building. Sherlock remembered them to be completely empty yesterday, due to the rainy weather. He wondered if they were full on other days; he didn’t want to have to look for a new place for his bike. However, he would worry about this on a different day.
“It’s my sister’s anniversary tomorrow. Well, it would be. But her girlfriend broke up with her a couple of weeks ago. I don’t want her to be alone tomorrow.”
Suddenly Sherlock couldn’t speak. Furiously, he held out the document in his hands to Mycroft. Frowning, the older brother took the sheet and skimmed it, turning slightly white by doing so.
“What do you mean?”
He strolled into the room, looking more casual than he felt, and put down his suitcase next to the sofa. Then he turned around and opened his arms invitingly. A small smirk played around his lips. “It’s not so bad a room.”
Sighing, he searched for the nearest entrance. He didn’t want to leave through the front door; the secretary was going to arrive soon, and he didn’t want to be caught slipping in or out. So he followed John in the direction he had gone to; there needed to be the second door somewhere.
Before Sherlock could answer, the airline employee had finished her conversation. “I apologise, gentlemen, but it seems as if there is only one room left at the hotel. And you have both been booked into it. The only alternative is a hotel closer to the city. I can try to get a room there, but I am not sure –“
He wanted to go up to him and talk, but Lestrade seemed to have something else in mind. He came up to Sherlock and sat down on his desk. Sherlock made an effort to not roll his eyes. Really, adults always thought he felt better when they minimized their height as if they’d seem less intimidating when in reality Sherlock was superior to most of them, only they didn’t realise, or rather, didn’t
This time, a tall, dark-haired man appeared soon after the announcement. He was thin and seemed a little jittery. He was wearing an expensive-looking coat. Dragging a slick-looking suitcase after himself, he arrived at the counter just moments after the blond man who had got up at the first announcement. He was already urgently talking to the airline assistant that was standing behind the counter of their gate. At the moment, she was raising her hand defensively. “Listen, I am very sorry about the inconvenience –“ As the tall, curly-haired man arrived, she smiled, showing relief at the prospect of being released from the first man’s impatience.
“You should think about your future, Sherlock. I know, you disapprove of holding a position in the government, but we both know what you are able of doing. You know your silly little experiments are not going to get you far. Maybe it is time to come back to reality. Grow up, Sherlock,” Mycroft said with what sounded like pity.
I admit, I didn't proof-read this chapter another time (I'm too drunk). I still hope the chapters are enjoyable!
“I’ll take you up on the offer then,” John said, laughing. “Somehow, I feel like we’d be arguing all night about it, so I’ll just give you that one.”
Sherlock could feel his cheeks turning slightly red. Slowly, he turned to face John. “Uh…” was all he managed to say.
As he slowly got up and dressed, he thought of one thousand excuses not to go to school. But he knew his mother – or better, his brother – wouldn’t buy any of it; they’d make him go. So he sighed and went downstairs to face his family. In the mornings, they almost felt … normal. His mother was rummaging around the kitchen, his father was still sleeping most of the time, and Mycroft would sit at the table with the newspaper in his hands and a cup of coffee in front of him whenever he was home. Of course he was home today. He felt like he needed to make sure Sherlock would actually go to school, and knowing Sherlock, he didn’t try to hide his intention.
The flight attendant’s smile faltered a little. She shot a glance at the smaller man in front of her. “Again, we are very sorry for the inconvenience. We have already booked you on to a new flight that leaves straight away tomorrow morning and will try our best to accommodate you during your overnight stay.”
He had reached Mycroft’s room and started picking the lock. He couldn’t understand how Mycroft had not installed a more secure lock on his door; Sherlock had lost count how often he’d broken into Mycroft’s room. It was so easy. Mycroft rarely used it anymore since he had moved out because, as he said, it didn’t suit an employee of the British government to live at his mother’s. Sherlock had to agree with him.
“How did you like your first day here, Sherlock? You seemed very quiet.”
After a few seconds, John began to laugh, and Sherlock thought it was the most beautiful thing he had ever heard in his life. After a while, he couldn’t hold himself back and started giggling. John had the most infectious laugh in the world, Sherlock was sure.
The goal was to see John Watson smile again, and he was rewarded.
“Sherlock Holmes, is it? How the hell did you know why I was in New York? Are you a weird stalker I should know about? Should I flee from this room right now?”  He had meant it only half-serious, but he couldn’t stop a little worry from sneaking into his words.
When he had sat down again, Sherlock took a sip from his bottle and shook his head. “Let’s hope this day never comes. I have come to have some sort of reputation amongst police officers for solving difficult cases. The American police contacted their colleagues from London to ask a favour, and life has been terribly boring recently, so I went.”
Sherlock nodded slowly and watched John walking off. He was surprised he had not run off as soon as possible after exchanging only a few words with Sherlock. That’s what he was used to. That’s what he could cope with. But he couldn’t deal with this tickling of hope rising in his chest; with John whose eyes sparkled and hair was shining golden and-
They both shook their head, pressing their lips together to keep from laughing. They looked at each other almost thievishly.
Sherlock looked incredulous. But before he could protest, John grinned at him with a sparkle in his eyes. “Come on, it’ll be fun. I haven’t played ‘Who am I?’ in years.”
Sherlock hesitated for a second only before saying, “I suppose it can’t hurt.”
Sherlock looked at him coldly and ignored the offered hand. Instead, he faced the locker and started turning the digits. So that was why he was here. Football practice. There had to be a smaller entrance in the back of the school; likely next to the gym. Of course Sherlock had not seen this one yesterday. Suddenly he was glad he had come early. He really needed to snoop around for a little bit.
“Yes,” came the answer, telling the both of them that nobody had been sleeping.
And this was what all this was. A reminder of how he didn’t fit in. He was alright with not fitting in; he didn’t care. He just didn’t need to be reminded of it constantly.
“I’m alright, Mycroft”, he coughed. “Let me alone.”
to realise.
Sherlock nodded distractedly and skimmed his gaze over the room once more. He obviously couldn’t sit next to
The woman dragged the corners of her mouth upwards, nodded, and, after some clicks on the computer screen, confirmed the room number. “Your luggage will be taken care of for you, of course. And please enjoy breakfast on us in the morning.”
Suddenly, John smiled into the darkness. “Sherlock,” he whispered.
“I just need an escape, John, don’t you understand? I can’t manage it alone; I can’t handle it anymore.”
It had been too late from the moment he had looked into John’s eyes and seen nothing of John in them.
“Sherlock, would you just listen to me for a moment? I know it is hard for you, but at least try.”
“Sherlock, don’t be so impolite. You are asked a simple question.”
“It’s been three months, Sherlock. What are you going to do? You can’t live on like this; he’s not going to come back.”
And suddenly his thoughts were gone and there was pure nothingness and a feeling of lightness rose in his chest and he liked this so much more than the ballast he had carried with him for the past year and he almost smiled as one last memory of John smiling and John with his sparkling eyes and John with his jumpers and John who always believed in him flashed through hismind before he lost consciousness and drifted away into darkness.
But John seemed to buy it and didn’t ask further. Instead, he looked at his watch and frowned. “Shit, I’m late for practice. I need to go – Sherlock, right? It was nice meeting you; I guess I’ll see you later in class later! I’ve got to go now. Bye!”
“Unacceptable.”
Sherlock threw Mycroft out of the flat and reached for the syringe on the table next to him.
Horror defined his face when he stroked the outline of John’s lips with his thumb; they tasted salty from his tears as he placed a chaste kiss on them. With closed eyes, Sherlock breathed in the smell of John one last time; he needed to memorize more; needed to memorize everything; needed to know how John smelled; needed to feel the texture of his jumpers; needed to thread his fingers through the blonde hair before it was too late.
