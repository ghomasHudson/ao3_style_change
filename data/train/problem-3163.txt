From questions about how much money to bring on a cruise to 15 things you ABSOLUTELY NEED TO KNOW before your first time on board, Cas’ head is a jumble of shore excursions, cruiser etiquette, and overpriced drink packages. By the time he stumbles upon a word-matching game involving different terms “to make you sound like a bona fide cruiser,” Cas is about ready to put in a preorder of three of said overpriced drink packages, all for himself.
!” a girl in white shorts and a forest green T-shirt emblazoned with a white W says excitedly as she wraps him into a hug that takes Cas completely off-guard. He stiffens in her embrace, praying that she’ll let him go soon; when she finally does, he notices that three more girls and two guys are swarming his car, hoisting his laundry baskets over their shoulders and loading his snacks and books onto a cart.
Zachariah freezes, his once-jovial features turning to stone. “Excuse me?”
Dean’s eyes dart up to Benny’s before moving over to Sam’s, then Charlie’s. None of them speak for a few seconds, until Charlie sets the phone down on the coffee table.
He clears his throat and rolls his shoulders to try and hide how out of place he feels, nodding to an elderly couple in the front row who’ve caught his eye before turning around to face Cas. “Exciting, huh?” he asks, adjusting Cas’ hair just to give himself an excuse to touch him. “Can I get your John Hancock later?”
the phone says. Dean shifts his finger slightly to the right on the screen, then taps again.
on Facebook--and let’s be honest, who isn’t--should Dean just send him a message? What if it goes to that goddamn
“Why?”
"Water stop coming up," Cas says, craning his neck to better estimate how close they are to the volunteers lining the street in their bright orange jackets, cheering and offering small Dixie cups half-full of water. "You good?"
They’re real fucking
Cas’ eyes go wide, and Dean grins. “Gotta have better faith in your abilities, man.”
“Garth Fitzgerald,” he says as he drives, sticking his hand out for each one of them to shake while keeping his eyes on the road ahead. He winks at Dean before adding, “The fourth.”
Cas has never liked the feeling of a weapon in his hands.

in movies, you idiot!” She worries her lower lip with her teeth before looking at Castiel again; he can tell she’s trying to calm herself down. “At least you didn’t grab his hand and force him to do it,” she murmurs, more to herself than him. “Listen, Castiel--would you like it if somebody asked to touch your face?”
Dean perks up immediately at the mention of food, and Cas grins. “What’d you have in mind?” he asks.
“I’m glad someone got something out of it,” Cas mutters.
The redhead smirks. “Doreen Green would kick his ass, Ed.” She turns to the other patron in the store, a scrawny guy with messy black hair. “What do you think, Harry?” she asks. “Lang or Green in a one-on-one fight? No squirrels or ants allowed.”
Stretching his arms up high before threading his fingers together behind his head, elbows out, Dean ambles over to the body on the ground. Sam’s already been there for a moment or two, crouched down beside it. Dean watches as he reaches a hand out and closes the man’s eyes, frozen in shock for eternity. It’s an odd thing, to see his brother treating someone who’d damn near killed them with such humanity, but Dean can’t help the sense of pride he feels blossoming in his chest.
Dean grins, and for some reason, Cas assumes that he's winking behind his dark sunglasses. "Now you're talkin' my language, Cas."
“Or a better suit.”
Fast-forward ten years later, and his aspirations of one day writing a bestseller are gathering dust, but at least he’s using his degree. That’s what his parents always tell him, so that’s what he always tells himself.
Dean shakes his head. “Nope,” he says. “Brother’s already seen it, friends don’t give a shit. You said it yourself, you need to make some new
“Let’s go,” he says, and starts the countdown until they start running again. “Five, four, three…”
. Dean turns back around and opens the sketchbook on his desk, right to the fully colored comic from the other day in the lunchroom, staring down at it in defeat. Betrayed by his own art. That’s a new one.
“That it?” he asks.
He pushes open the door anyway.
Cas visibly relaxes at that, then smiles. “Something like that.”
“Wh--
“Yeah,” Dean says with a short huff of laughter. “Me too. Hey,” he says suddenly, leaning across Cas and pointing at a building they’re passing. “Look at that narrow-ass house, huh? Cool as shit. Always wanted to go in there, but you need a reservation weeks in advance. Sucks, but maybe someday, right?”
you look the way you do.”
“Based on your answer to this one question, I think you’ll know what to do.”
Andy leads the charge out of the dugout, and they all crowd around home plate, waiting for Vic to approach. Chuck is beaming and clapping as Vic rounds third, then smacks him on the back as he passes.
you to describe it. So you don’t get to feel like an asshole for doing something that I asked you to do, okay?”
“Thanks for the tip,” Dean says bitingly. They awkwardly shift positions and start jogging back toward the Winchesters’ house.
pissed about it.”
“Good. It’s pathetic.”
Hannah and Billie pepper him with questions about life on the set, his favorite castmates, and exactly how much producers influenced the course of events on the show. Cas stays quiet for most of the interview, only interjecting or commenting when called upon, but just as they’re about to start wrapping up, he decides that he can’t help himself.
running on repeat in his head, so he keeps his mouth shut.
“You know you didn’t sign up for this. I’m not gonna drag you into this tiny shred of limelight just because you decided to lower your standards and stick with me for a while.” He pauses, then adds, “It’s only big enough for me, anyway.”
“If I told you guys something,” Cas says slowly, swirling his straw around his drink, “would you promise to keep it out of the show?”
Dean’s brows furrow together at that, and he can see Cas perk up from his seat. “Free mo...ten dollars?” He’d tried to hide the disbelief in his voice, but it’s impossible with something like this staring him in the face. “They’ll pay you
“You heard her,” Billie says when Cas glances at her and Hannah for confirmation, and he takes a breath, watching as a few drops of condensation race down his glass.
They’re all crammed into Charlie’s tiny studio apartment, and Hannah has brought the emergency minisode to order. Cas is sitting on the floor with his legs crossed, still studying Dean’s post.
“Still,” Castiel says. “It feels like I’m rubbing it in your face or something. Bragging. Dangling it over you when you and I both know that you can’t have it.” He doesn’t realize Dean has trailed behind him until the rope goes taut between them; Castiel turns and takes in Dean’s indignant, unamused posture. His head is tilted to the side, his mouth pressed into a thin line.
“Listen, pal, if you’re gonna off us, I’d rather you skip the soapbox and just pull the trigger right fucking n—”
Sam laughs again and swats at Dean with the book. He’s still studying the page as he does so, asking, “What even is this? Who’s Cas?” But it’s the head tilt and long, drawn-out, “Oh,
“How long have you known?” Dean asks when they’re back at the apartment, his voice quiet, almost a little embarrassed. He won’t meet Cas’ eye, no matter how hard Cas tries to look at him, and hadn’t said a word the whole walk back to the apartment.
“I’m glad I’m not the only one who has trouble convincing him that he’s a good person,” he grumbles, and Sam laughs.
He wishes he could let their bodies press together as they adjust to the swaying and jerking of the train, that Dean would wrap his arm around his shoulders and hold him close. In an attempt to distract himself, he pulls out his phone and unlocks it. There’s a new text from Gabe--
Cas bites his lip. “No. Nothing.”
It had taken him three different tries to find his way to Miranda, and now that he’s finally here, he just wants to go home. The campus is abuzz with overeager freshmen and their parents unloading their cars, and Cas tightens his grip on his steering wheel.
As he approaches the edge of the Quad and catches his first glimpse of the baseball diamond in the distance, he nods to himself.
“Emily Abato!” the dude calls, and it only takes a second before a girl somewhere in the crowd shrieks with excitement. The crowd starts to cheer as they part for her to get up to the front. She’s holding two fingers up in the air with one hand to signal that she wants two tickets, dragging her boyfriend behind her with the other. They line up on the steps where HAM4HAM just took place, both of them beaming at the crowd and hugging each other.
Dean throws his hands up in victory. “
“I hate you.”
Cas could’ve slept through the rain, but it’s the loud clap of thunder that jerks him awake. He must’ve fallen asleep—the last thing he remembers is watching TV with Dean, his boyfriend carding his fingers lazily through his hair. Dean is still there next to him, undisturbed by the storm outside, and Cas tangles their feet together under the sheets and blankets, smiling as Dean unconsciously snuggles in a little closer next to him.
“Gonna have to be more specific there, Sammy!” he yells. He finally finds the fucking salt shaker, grabs a pinch, and slides in his socked feet over to the pot of boiling water on the stove, tossing it in with a flick of his wrist.
“Sleep,” Dean says, his cheeks flushing slightly, “right. Sorry.”
“Yes,” he says uncertainly, falling into step with Dean as they approach the port’s entrance. “Gabe’s got a hangover, and Balthazar wants to spend the day at the slot machines.”
“Guess what we just passed?”
, Cas. Now.”
“Billie’s one of the best guitarists this side of the Mississippi,” the woman who’d invited them in adds proudly. “Her playing speaks for itself.”
Well. So much for that.
Sam swats his hand away with a glare, but his brows knit together as he takes in Dean’s stance and words, apparently realizing that Dean’s not joking around. “What do you mean, where is he? He was with you.”
All three women laugh as Cas’ cheeks go pink. “Ooh, Novak’s got a crush,” Billie says teasingly.
you take steps forward to go in—but then you saw it was me in there and you just…”
“Uh...yes.”
Dean chuckles, then his eyes go wide when Cas’ face goes hard. “No, no, no, that didn’t count!”
“What’re you at?”
too hard for you, huh?” Castiel winces at the sting in Dean’s words. “Don’t baby me, I don’t need that shit. Got it?”
“Hi.” He glances down when he feels a warm ball of fur against his shins; a large black lab is curled up on the hardwood floor and blinks open one eye, studying Castiel disinterestedly. He notices quickly that this dog also has a bell.
Bobby looks at him flatly. “Goddamn idjits, the both of you.”
Humming some song Charlie’s kids had been rehearsing, he dumps everything he needs for the night into his bag and grabs his jacket from the back of his chair, doing a quick spin on his heel as he throws it on.
“His name is Dean Winchester.”
Cas sighs and laces his hands together behind his head in defeat. “I think they might be shin splints,” he finally says. “I had them once a year or so a--”
“What--” Cas clears his throat, “what is this?”
Cas smiles and nods. "I hope so."
“You’re Charlie?”
Chuck pretends not to have heard him, lost in the excitement of competition, and grips Lisa’s arm when Gordon overshoots one of the table’s chairs and grabs its back, slowing himself down and swinging himself back into it. He quickly arranges the table into some semblance of a nice-looking dinner scene, and rests the ring against a small bouquet of flowers before raising his hand.
The train lurches to the side suddenly as it makes a sharp turn, and Castiel’s grip on the bar above him tightens instinctively. He’s been riding the T since he was young, so adapting to the T’s jerky, clunking movements is second-nature to him.
-first. You’re the only one I know who doesn’t think of running as a chore.” She looks at him pleadingly. “Please, Castiel.”
Dean chuckles, and before Cas can really process it, he feels his boyfriend’s lips brush against his cheek in a quick kiss. Normally, he’d be thrilled at Dean’s small show of affection, but they’d agreed to continue keeping the PDA and flirtations in public to a minimum for the next few days—or at least the rest of the afternoon—so he claps a hand to his face, startled, with Dean looking like he’d just gotten caught fulfilling a particularly bold dare on the playground.
“What? I d--” Castiel is leaning over to inspect the sole of Dean’s sneaker when he reminds himself that no, that’s not the reason he’s apologizing. He surveys the sole quickly--can’t be too careful--before turning his attention back to Dean. “No, no, you didn’t.”
“Christ, Winchester, watch it!” a voice yells above the music, and Cas’ eyelids flutter as he tries to regain his composure as well as remain conscious. He presses one hand over his nose and uses the other to start scrambling backward across the beer-soaked floor. He has to get out of here. Sticky, warm blood is trickling through his fingers and he prays that nobody steps on his hand; the last thing he needs is a broken finger or three on top of a broken nose.
“The st—
“Then whose is it?” Dean pauses, inadvertently letting the question hang awkwardly between the two of them, before trying to shift the conversation. “Listen, sorry. You’re right, we’ll figure it out. I’m...I gotta go, though. See you tomorrow?”
A cruise.
Dean grins in spite of himself at the stupid little phrase their mom would say whenever she’d come home from work with pizza, a Tuesday night tradition from when they were kids that’s lasted long into their adult lives.
“You don’t have any problem doing that to me,” Sam calls from the hallway, and Cas grins.
That’s a nibble.
Sam barks out a laugh and shakes his head. “If you’ve seen some of the people my brother’s brought home, you’d
“I thought yoga was supposed to be relaxing,” Dean says casually as they unroll their mats.
It takes all Cas has not to up and leave the restaurant in a huff, but aside from the potential embarrassment and explanations he’d have to give to Billie, Hannah, and Charlie, he didn’t want to let Dean think he’d won. So he takes a deep breath and considers Dean’s smug face.
Cas doesn't have to pause long before giving her his reply. “Yes,” he says. “I understand.”
“What happened?” she asks quietly.
, but he’s counting it as goddamn hand-holding, so sue him--and opens his mouth before he can second-guess himself anymore.
“Yes.”
“It suits him,” Cas says, and Sam laughs.
“He’s a grown man!” Sam practically shouts. He runs his hands through his hair before continuing, his tone more level this time. “And besides. I know you’re set on him not having left of his own volition, but...we gotta consider alternatives too.”
stopped, they rob banks.”
And if Dean takes an extra second or two to check out the guy’s ass in between shoulder rolls, that’s no one’s business but his own.
Cas stares at him. “You were serious?”
There’s no reply for several minutes, and Cas tries to distract himself with some gossip articles about a random cooking show. His heart jumps when his phone finally buzzes again, but this time, it’s not from an Instagram notification, but a text message.
Cas purses his lips, considering, then nods. “You’re right.” He nods at Sam, then at Dean, and starts walking past them, back in the direction from where they came.
“Oh, pleasure’s all mine.” He grins and takes yet another sweeping glance over her body. “Find me inside?”
Dean glances over to the panel on the left, and he sees why.
“Thirty dollars,” Sam says, holding out each of their bills. Dean doesn’t remember them ever having that much money at once when they were kids, and a pang of regret pierces his chest as he’s suddenly swamped by the thought that as hard as he’d tried, he’d never been able to give Sammy that.
,” the man with the gun says, and Cas squeezes his eyes shut, his chest heaving as the cold metal of the gun ghosts along his neck. “Not a word, got it?”
“Why did you tell everyone that you were arrested for robbing a bank?”
Dean purses his lips and studies Castiel curiously. The man still won’t look him straight in the eye, and Dean worries his lower lip between his teeth, wondering if it’s his place to ask before actually doing so. “Uh, hey, are you...
Cas nods, thinking of Gabe's apparently unending energy and—slightly immature, if Cas is being honest—sense of humor. "He's very funny."
Dean wants to smile at that, Cas can tell, and the only thing he wants to see is Dean’s stupid crooked grin, but instead, he shakes his head. “Should’ve known that was you,” he says. “I knew you were writing that article.”
“How did you—”
what makes Naomi break into a real smile.
Marathon? Yeah, I’d say he’s doing a little better than okay.” She looks down at the counter, which is etched with initials, and runs her finger across a couple of them. “I miss him, though. Wish he’d come back to hang out, he was always a lot of fun.”
“Too easy!” Victor shouts jokingly. “Give us the catch.”
“Yeah, that’s it. It’s the best,” he says indignantly, sitting up and turning toward Cas, his brow furrowed. At Cas’ silence, he asks, “Are you telling me you think a comic with that premise isn’t the fucking best?”
“Lead the way.”
“You’re not being a very good employee, Charlie,” the guy with the glasses, Ed, says. “Leaving this guy all alone to fend for himself out in the comic book wilderness.”
Cas doesn’t want this. Or, well, he never thought he’d want this. And he doesn’t know if it’s because of his sweetness or frankness or gorgeous eyes or crooked smile or sharp jawline or a combination of all that and more, but one thing’s for sure:
Dean purses his lips and considers this. “Understandable.” He tosses the ball up in the air, his eyes following it back down into his glove, then looks over at Cas. “Speaking from experience, this place ain’t bad with financial aid, so you should be all set.”
than welcome to take my spot.”
Dean watches her work, fast and efficient and utterly ruthless. He notices Sam tapping his foot anxiously next to him, but the admiration’s clear in his eyes, and Dean smiles down at his hands. Even if, somehow, this doesn’t work, and he’s back at Joliet within a day or two, he decides all this has been more than worth for the sole reason of seeing Sam look like that again. He chances a glance back down at his and Cas’ hands, and squeezes once more.
“Uh-huh,” Aiden’s dad says. “Duly noted, champ. Now, I think we’ve bothered these two enough, so…”
When Dean opens his eyes this time, they’re focused on Cas’ lips, and Cas’ heart stutters in his chest. Dean unconsciously licks his lips; it’s so subtle, Cas isn’t even sure that
Dean hesitates at that, and Cas wonders if he’s taken things a step too far too fast.
Cas furrows his brows together as he digs his keys out of his pocket to unlock his apartment. “I have fourteen different shows set to record on my DVR,” he says. “You’re going to have to be a bit more specific.”
“Of course.”
“Sure,” Dean says absently, shrugging one shoulder and taking a second to get himself together.
“Sentimental, much?” Charlie calls from her position across the room. Billie flips her off, and the group laughs.
The call disconnects, and Castiel sighs. Getting to Anna’s office at the Massachusetts Association for the Blind will require an extra trip on the always-pain-in-the-ass Green Line, and after riding it six days a week, he’s not thrilled at the prospect of spending his day off squeezed into an already-packed subway car just to hear his sister ask him for a (probably) ridiculously outlandish and unreasonable favor.
He cuts himself off when he sees the cover. It's some trashy gossip rag, something people flip through while waiting to check out at the grocery store. Cas had never given them a second glance, but then again, he'd never been on the fucking cover before.
The subway stop—no, the

It’s clear that’s not the answer Ben wants to hear. His arms drop back to his sides and he pulls away from Lisa, head down as he makes a beeline back to the living room.
stay away from Rowena goddamn MacLeod.
“Hey, uh, you gotta head right back to hang out with your cat tonight, or no?” Dean asks, and almost immediately wants to smack himself in the face.
Thanks for reading, guys! Hope you enjoyed <3
Jesus, what does he have to do to get these people to just watch the fucking movie? Maybe if he’s more direct... “Yeah, sure, okay, but for tonight, can we just watch the fucking movie, please?”
“What else was I supposed to do?” Cas demands. “I

“Gabe,” Cas says in greeting, dropping his gear bag in front of his closet and flopping down stomach-first onto his bed with a groan. He toes his cleats off and lets them drop to the floor before pulling his phone out of his pocket and staring at the blank screen.
Not just a little grin or a smirk like Dean saw outside the Rodgers; no, he’s looking at someone who’s happy, delighted, goddamn
What did he do wrong?
“Okay, okay,” Dean interrupts, holding up his hands. “I get the idea, Emeril. So, what, you gonna shit on my eating habits, replace all my meat with fish?”
Dean sighs. "It kind of bums me out to talk about it, and I'm basically the furthest thing from bummed now, so do you mind if we talk about it later?"
“I’m not giving you
“‘s not your fault,” he says, shifting his weight a little in the driver’s seat. “Fuckin’ sucks, but it’s not your fault.” There’s a short silence, and then Dean continues. “And it's not as bad as it could be. At least I know what shit looks like, you know? I've seen most of the stuff around me before, which is more than I can say for a lot of people I met during O and M."
Dean grins, quickly glancing down at his boots. When he looks up, he's got a suggestion. "Red Arrow?"
“He, uh, he doesn’t know you’re here.”
Dean ignores Sam, pressing on and preventing Novak—
The genuine surprise on Cas’ face when he looks down at the food almost hurts worse than the actual punches Dean had taken earlier in the day, and he starts to wonder if Sam’s claims had been even more on the money than he’d thought. “Thank you,” he says quietly, looking down as he takes the food.
series will end.” Charlie laughs again at this, and Cas is prompted to continue. “But I was kind of hoping...I’m not sure if it’s possible, but I wanted to do something for him, and I thought maybe you could help me.”
Cas’ cheeks burn with secondhand embarrassment. “Do you have any idea how many mouths have probably been on that stem?”
He’s snapped at his little brother enough times to know when he’s upset by Dean’s response, but he’s telling the truth: the last thing he wants is a deep-dive into his past—especially not with Cas within earshot. “I’ll be fine tomorrow.”
mistakes, and your intention is to punish them? For putting a stop to months of robberies while also thwarting an assassination attempt?” She tsks impatiently, like she’s talking to a child on the verge of a tantrum. “Now, that just won’t do.”
“Is he awake yet?”
This time, when Sam and Cas swoop in, Dean wraps his arms around them, pulling them in close and mouthing along as they sing,
contestants are yelling at each other while another has just started sobbing in the corner of the hot tub. Dean’s mouth quirks up in a grin, and he squeezes Cas’ hand back.

“When you stop flirting with guests and getting
“Both.” Dean catches Cas looking at him at that, and winks. Cas is quick to look away, taking a sudden interest in his cleats.
Gabe chuckles before reaching over onto his desk, grabbing a Twix bar, and tossing it across the room to Cas. “You think you’re foolin’
Sam studies him for a few seconds, lips pursed together in consideration. “Don't blame me when it all blows up in your face, Dean.” He sprawls out and gets to his feet, then adds, “You're paying for the extra plate for him, dude.”

Cas opens his mouth to explain, but then realizes that he’s essentially asking Dean how he walks around while blind. “Uh, nothing.”

. Fumbling with the keys until he finds the right one, he clears his throat. “Novak,” he says sharply, careful to keep his gaze low and his voice lower as he unlocks the cell door. “Up and at ‘em.”
“Get your hands off that boy, Warden,” he barks. “And you three, take a seat.” His eyes catch on Dean’s for just a second too long, but his expression stays unreadable. Heyerdahl’s eyes narrow at Dean, and he squeezes just a little tighter before releasing his grip.
“Today’s date is all about responsibility, and seeing how you do thinking on your toes.” She grins at them all, and winks in the sunlight. “I’ve got a busy life, and I want my man to be able to keep up with me, and what better way to weed out the weak than with an obstacle course!”
Cas takes a deep breath, then looks down at his lap. He shouldn’t do this, bare his soul to someone he just fucking met, someone who undoubtedly would have no problem making fun of him for his problems and using them against him. “You…”
"Exactly." He shakes his head affectionately, then looks at Cas again. "I'm sorry, man, I should've told you earlier."
“She’s a beauty, huh?” Dean says, grinning over his shoulder at the camera operator in the Impala’s backseat. “Used to be my old man’s, then I got it when...” Dean clears his throat uncomfortably at that, but pushes past the silence threatening to overwhelm the scene. “Uh, yeah.”
He’s got a creative writing degree, he could spin a fucking yarn about the evening. Yeah. He could do this. The more Cas thinks about it, the more he warms to the idea.
“Are you okay?” Castiel asks hesitantly, taking a seat in one of the plastic chairs set out in front of her desk.
Did I just hear that right? Is Castiel Novak going on a VACATION???
know this guy. At all. But something about him just...works. Dean can’t explain it, and he’s not even sure that he really wants to. “He's cool, Sam. It'll be fine.”
He shakes his head.
The next few moments are a frenzy of activity as the men race to the changing stations, struggling to clothe their baby dolls and get them into baby bjorns and strapped onto their chests as quickly as possible. Dean, Kevin, and Gordon take the lead, all of them peeking over the babies strapped to their chests as they hustle to the next obstacle, vacuuming a long patch of grass. Dean stumbles as his vacuum catches on a rock, and just as he’s about to faceplant, flips himself onto his back in an attempt to protect his small plastic son.
Cas stirs under his arm, and Dean trails off, glancing down to see Cas blinking owlishly up at him. He yawns, trying and failing to hide the way the corners of his mouth quirk up in a grin. “Morning, sunshine.”
Cas had been expecting himself to be a complete awkward trainwreck around Dean Winchester, but it’s actually the opposite. He’s surprised at how easily conversation comes, and the genuine interest that Dean seems to take in what he thought was a relatively unremarkable life.
!” he scolds the dog before turning his attention back to Castiel. “Can I help you?”
Cas takes a breath, tries to shove down the nauseous feeling churning in his stomach, and hits the FOLLOW button.
Dean grins widely. “The funniest.”
A behemoth of a man is standing on the other side of it, holding an equally huge golden retriever back by the collar. He glances up at Castiel and gives him an apologetic smile as he tries to pull the dog back before it can tackle him.

carries in his back pocket to wipe the smudge of dirt off Dean’s face.
. I think you can fit Dean fucking Winchester in there.”
He could also lose Dean.
“Hey, I didn’t hear you complaining before
Castiel stares at him, and after a few seconds, his panic-stricken face slowly morphs into one of relief, and his eyes go soft as he gives Dean a tentative smile. “I was going to offer you a free pastry for bothering you,” he says, smiling shyly, and
No wonder his brothers are so excited.
“Save it for someone without eyes, dude.” Dean leans back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest. “You weren’t exactly subtle back in the studio. What—did I steal your girl? Or guy? Were you best friends with Alastair?”
"You should see if he can come up to visit you."
“Listen up, asshole,” the man says quietly, pressing his arm harder against Dean’s throat. Dean tries to speak, but all that comes out is a strangled grunt, which just makes the man angrier. He smacks Dean once more before continuing, “Now, my friend here’s got a gun on your little boyfriend, and he’s gonna pull the trigger if you don’t behave, you understand me?”
His first thought is sarcastic, something along the lines of the fact that a sob story would get Dean more sympathy, more adoration, but he’s already made it clear that he’s not the person Cas had thought he was. No one would
Dean doesn’t like it.
--whirls around to stare at him, eyes wide behind his mask.
“Thanks,” she says quietly.
“Sam!” Cas shouts before edging in next to Dean. “Dean, let me see how bad it is.”
Dean barks out a laugh and shifts so that he’s facing in the direction of Aiden’s voice. “It’s special, one of a kind,” he says, his voice taking on a conspiratorial whisper. He pauses, then adds, “It’s like a lightsaber. You ever seen
Cas is jerked out of his book when he sees a boy down the hall press his forehead against the door to a room—presumably his own—before smacking his open palm against the wall.
“Of course it’s Castiel, Sam,” Jess says, reaching over and smacking Sam lightly on the head. “Who else would it be?” She glances at Dean for confirmation, and he gives her a quick nod. She pumps her fist. “
“But—” Hannah starts.
“Hey,” Sam says suddenly, elbowing Dean in the ribs. “Watch it.”
Cas furrows his brows, and tries to ignore the stab of disappointment that's currently making itself at home in his chest. "Oh. Is he sick?" Sam pauses before opening his mouth to respond, but Cas picks up on his hesitation almost immediately. His heart starts hammering in his chest and he feels his stomach drop down deep, his mind immediately going into overdrive—
"I have the whole book that that story is from," Cas says.
Dean chuckles and drops onto the couch, propping his legs up onto the coffee table and crossing them at the ankles before leaning back with his hands laced behind his head. “Yeah,” he says. “Place for everything, everything in its place.”
feel like an April Fool’s joke to say.
“Can you get here by one?”
“Good taste,” he says with a grin. He scribbles a note down in his pad and hurries off. He’s not gone for more than three seconds when Balthazar, eyes gleaming with curiosity, pounces on his newest theory.
Dean shrugs. “

If word ever got out that he’d actually been busted for shoplifting while Sammy was hauled in for practicing law without a license...well, he would just never show his face again. Simple as that.
Cas stares at him. Maybe Balthazar had had the right idea with the unlimited drink package, after all.
“Can you sing?” Cas asks curiously.
Dean waves it off as he resumes his meal.
“Can I look at it?” Cas asks. The question is more of a formality than anything; the sketchbook is open, and Cas is already looking at it.
Cas hears that familiar tap-tap-tapping across the wooden floor, and he looks down at the photo in his hands once more.
,” Balthazar says, eyes lit up in delight. He leans forward and stares at Cas intently. “Is it the steward?”
Dean snaps his fingers and thumbs over to the safari icon, then quickly types in “bumblebee bakery lawrence.” It's the middle of the night, no one will answer, and Dean can just leave his message and Cas will hear it tomorrow. It'll be fine, great, problem solved.
“Gonna have to be more specific,” Billie says.
Two hours and one and a half cheesy horror movies later, the bags of ice on Cas’ shins have melted, and Dean is snoring softly, his head resting on Cas’ shoulder. Cas looks over and studies Dean’s face, how calm and relaxed it looks in sleep. He smiles at each one of Dean’s freckles, and resists the urge to card his fingers through Dean’s short hair, not wanting to risk waking him.
“Describe it to me, Cas.”
He pulls his hands out of his pockets and holds them in front of him with a quick laugh. “Why the hell are you apologizing to me?
Cas hesitantly takes the chocolate and sticks it into his pocket. “Hannah, what's all this about?”
“So,” she says, poking at Dean’s temple with the eraser-end of a pencil, “Galleon for your thoughts?”
“You want me to
“We gotta keep going,” he says, voice quiet and gentle, betraying the threatening, mammoth persona that comes along with his massive frame.
“Gabriel.”
I didn’t know twelve goddamn hours ago?”
Cas startles, pulling his bag closer to himself and staring at the man in front of him. He’s got a wheeled trolley stacked precariously high with suitcases, and grunts, gesturing toward Cas’ bag.
Cas laughs, and Dean smacks his thigh lightly. “What the hell, Cas? Laughing at my pain?”
Half an hour later, Castiel is starting in on his third beer and is halfway through a basket of cheese fries, and he’s just reaching the conclusion of the saga that was his afternoon. “And now,” he says, running a hand through his hair and bringing the bottle to his lips once more, “I have to go meet him tomorrow.”
“Dean!” Cas tries to wrench himself away from the man holding him, but before he can, he feels an arm wraps around his neck. His eyes widen when he feels the cold metal of a gun pressed against his temple, and he swallows hard, trying--and failing--to quell the panic that’s rising in his gut.
for themselves, for Christ’s sake), he wonders if it’s too late to pawn his ticket off on Hannah.
It’s a good thing their webcam is shitty, because that move’s got Dean’s cheeks going redder than any
"Hello, Sam," Cas says, smiling warmly. It takes some effort, but he restrains himself from adding
“You good?”
Castiel wants to say.
“Hold the fuck on.” Charlie’s voice startles them all, and Cas stares at her. She’s staring intently at something on her screen, then suddenly seems to remember that everyone can see her. “Wait…” She taps her keyboard a few times and her screen is mirrored in Cas’. At least twelve tabs are open in her browser, and Cas cringes internally at the disorganization. The page she’s on, though, is Dean’s Instagram, and that makes him want to cringe even more.
that he wants to say yes, but he’s still a bundle of nerves nevertheless, and will be until an affirmation comes out of Cas’ mouth.
He tosses some uninspired jazz hands in there too, just for good measure, and his kids groan. “Hey, hey, hey,” he says, clapping his hands before pointing his chalk menacingly at them, “get it together, y’all, and quit acting like I asked you to get a tattoo of Conspiracy Keanu.”
“Did I just hear you right, Novak?”
“Dean Winchester,” she finishes. “I heard we’ve had a guest of honor in camp the past few days. What's he like?”
“Are there any more turns coming up?” Dean asks. “‘m ready to kick more of ‘em in the ass, let’s go.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas says.
], he’s hot,” she mutters, “where the hell did they find him?”
Cas pauses, and Dean tries not to notice how Cas had stiffened slightly at the question. “Uh, my ex, actually.”
Dean’s cheeks redden, and he shakes his head. “Nah. Free sketch for class.”
“Fucking crazy, man.”
“So?” Dean says, the eagerness in his voice betraying his casual stance. “Do you love it, or do you
“I see. Well, you fools’ve got your hands full with Cassie, here, I’ll say that much.”
Even though he knows it’s useless, Cas tries to protest once more. “I’m fine, De--”
“Not comforting!” he shouts after her.
Cas makes his way down the hallway toward the living room, which is silent, and Cas wonders for a second if Dean is still asleep. The old wood of the floor creaks under his feet, and Cas hesitantly peeks into the room.
“Okay.” Cas takes his time getting up, and apparently isn’t moving fast enough, because he suddenly feels something long and thin smack his ass. He jumps to attention and glares at Dean, who’s standing casually next to him, halfheartedly attempting to hide his cane behind his back while grinning widely at him.
“Hello to you, too.”
He wants to text Dean and apologize, explain himself, get to the bottom of whatever the hell just happened, but something stops him. He unlocks his phone and swipes over to his text messages, opening up his thread with Dean. He’s considering typing a novella to him, rife with apologies and “I didn’t know”s, but Gabe interrupts his mental outlining process before he can get too far.
“Jesus, can you just
Dean narrows his eyes before lifting a foot and knocking it against Sam’s head. “Fuck you. I know words. I
“You don’t say.”
“Holy shit,” Gabe breathes. “Dean Winchester.”
The Avengers
The door to the apartment opens with a dull creak a few moments later, and Cas freezes before unconsciously burrowing deeper under the covers. He tries to talk himself out of it, reassure himself that despite his crazy extracurriculars, this is still
“Thanks for the hot chocolate.”
Dean thought the dancing was hard, but he’d forgotten about the waiting that comes afterward.
“T-t-then you’ll be cold.”
She’d sent Bachelor Nation into a frenzy when she’d muttered, “I feel like I just met my future husband” at his retreating back; hell, Hannah had almost fallen out of her chair, and Billie had thrown popcorn at the TV screen. That opening half hour set the stage for an episode of sheer insanity, from a group date focused on love languages that got touchy-feely real fast to a one-on-one that could’ve doubled as a therapy session.
“Okay, okay, you get the idea,” he finally says, dropping the chalk back onto its tray and wiping his hand on his pants. “Memes are funny, they’re stupid, they make points, and most of all, they’re proof that art doesn’t need to be pretty to mean something. So use that, huh? Go with your gut on these, have fun, make it your own. You’ve got the rest of class to get started. Final drafts are due at the end of the week.”
He’s no stranger to lust, and may’ve even found himself smitten a time or two, but having Cas back by his side, feeling his warmth next to him, the way their fingers brush as they walk when Sam’s not looking—and even when he is, who the hell cares—it feels good and like home and right.
“I--I’m sorry,” Castiel stammers as Dean slowly gets to his feet, flinching at every other movement. His hand ghosts Dean’s back, and Dean turns his head to the side and spits a mouthful of blood onto the sidewalk before turning to Castiel.
were the ones paying him.” He leans forward and snaps his fingers in front of Dean’s face. “Wake up, Dean--he likes you.” He grins mischievously at his older brother. “And I think you like him, too.”
“Age is just a number, kiddo,” he says.
“Dean,” Cas interrupts, “what are you talking about?”
“I want you to describe something else to me.”
But then, he thinks about the way the city started to heal once the man had been apprehended. The way they banded together, supported each other, and the way the light slowly returned back to Boston, and that’s what in his mind when he and Dean approach the finish line. It’s painted across the entirety of Boylston Street, so they can only see a small part of it without risking getting caught in traffic.
As the days pass, Cas realizes that he hates being on watch over Winchester, but not for the reason he’d expected.
“Don’t be so sure,” he says, finally spearing a piece of the greens and popping it into his mouth. He drops the fork into the bowl and leans back against the counter, arms folded across his chest. He chews thoughtfully for a moment, then gives his verdict. “This shit’s not bad.”
“Looks like you might’ve been right, Cas,” Hannah says with a grin.
Almost.
Cas grabs his keys and calls, “Behave yourself, Ollie,” over his shoulder before closing and locking the door behind him.
The car bounces down a particularly bumpy patch of road before pulling to a stop just short of a grassy field, an enormous tree planted smack dab in the middle. Crowley and his lackey usher them out of the car and lead them a few yards away—probably to avoid getting their blood on the car, Dean realizes morosely. And what a shame that’d be, dirtying such a nice car. It almost makes him angrier than the fact that he and Sam are effectively facing their deaths, and that Dean won’t just die; he’ll be leaving Cas to do so as well.
person his sister should be considering for this job, when he lands on one that actually makes sense. “Don’t I need to qualify, too? Isn’t it against the rules for me to run if I’m not qualified?” He tries to keep the pride out of his voice and the triumphant smile off his face at finding this loophole in his sister’s logic, but his heart drops when Anna shakes her head.
Michael nods absently. “Why don’t you take the rest of the day off, try and recoup,” he suggests. Castiel glances at the clock on the wall; his shift is scheduled to end in forty-five minutes anyway.
“Dean?” A pause as he turns to his other side. “Sam?”
Dean?The last blind date Anna had set him up on ended with him buzzed and crying in the back of a taxi, and Castiel is adamant that nothing like that happens again. “Anna, I don’t--”
, as awful as Winchester.
Dean takes his time leaning in closer, his eyes flickering from Cas’ own to his lips and back. The warmth of Dean’s breath sends a chill down his spine, and he closes his eyes, his lips parting in anticipation of what’s coming. Something he quickly recognizes as the tip of Dean’s nose gently taps against his own, and then Dean drops a quick kiss there, as well, and Cas just about dies.
to get rid of my good food--”
“Sorry, sorry,” he says quickly.
They all must look like that, now that Dean thinks about it. Matted hair, smoke-smudged skin, walking, talking messes on the side of the road, all three of ‘em. He reaches for one of the car’s side mirrors and tilts it over toward himself.
“Dean!” Benny shouts, gripping his friend’s arm harder and pulling him out of the producer’s grip. “Relax, brother, relax. Come on. He’s not worth it.” It takes a lot of work, but eventually Benny manages to wrestle Dean out of the room, taking a second to flip off Alastair as they leave.
Dean darts forward and snatches the book away from Cas. He looks down at it in his hands, berating himself for being such a moron. He hadn’t noticed the thing was missing for the entire day; he’d even
There’s no question: this man’s smarmy and gross and has been rubbing Dean the wrong way since the second he showed up...but Dean’s desperate and sad and willing to ignore all that for a shot, just a shot, at getting Cas back. And if this uppity asshole’s the way to do that, well then Dean’ll just have to grin and bear it.
“Dean, you’re going the wrong way! There’s no door!”
“Not saying it’s right, but that’s how I was feeling.”
Castiel stands there, trying to grapple with the conflicting emotions running wild within him. Dean’s being an asshole, which, if he’s being truthful, Castiel is sort of turned on by.
on your pull list, Ed!” she shouts good-naturedly as the guys head back onto the street, closing the door behind them. She grins before turning back to Cas with a friendly smile. “So, what can I help ya with?”
“Okay, one--this is not your fault. Dean’s a big boy, he can make his own decisions. Two, and this is the one you should really be paying attention to,” she says, taking a bite of her burrito, “do you
“Cas!” he hisses again, eyes darting between Cas and the hothead with the shotgun, who’s decided now’s as good a time as any to start moving towards them. “You know him?”
One fella stuck at the tail end of a group brings his axe down on a block with a sense of care that’s oddly familiar to Dean, before straightening up to stretch and look toward the passing truck. He runs a hand through a shock of messy, dark hair. That’s when it all clicks into place—the hair, the mannerisms, the form—and Dean doesn’t even need to see the man’s eyes to know who he’s looking at.
“Christ,” Billie says with a laugh, raising her glass before taking a drink. “Lisa really did miss the boat with him, didn’t she?”
It’s not fun, but it’s not unbearable, either, and the more stations they approach, the less Cas finds himself giving a shit.
Cas chokes on his water and presses a fist to his chest, coughing. His brothers glance at each other and make a split-second decision as Cas tries to pull himself together.
Dean nods. “Yeah. I don’t really know what I’d do without him,” he says after a pause. “Don’t tell him that, though,” he adds sharply, and Castiel laughs.
“I’m sure. My brother is around here somewhere, too; I should probably find him at some point.”
"Sam?" Cas asks hesitantly. "Is everything o--"
They spend the next half hour or so debating different ideas, but Cas only hears bits and pieces of them; his mind keeps going back to the night in the restaurant with Dean. No matter how much he tries to convince himself otherwise, there’s a tiny part of him that keeps going back to it.
Cas looks at him flatly, and for a split second, Dean’s hit with a pang of horror as he wonders if maybe he’s been reading this all wrong, that Cas is straight as they come and Dean’s made a massive fool of himself. Cas finally opens his mouth, apparently deciding to put Dean out of his misery, and Dean braces himself for whatever’s to come. “Dean,” he says seriously, “I haven’t showered in three days.”
“Who you think you’re foolin’?” he asks. “All three’ve you are wanted men. You think something like this—” he tugs the fake beard away from Dean’s face with a snap, dropping it to the floor and grinding it with his heel for good measure, “—is gonna throw us off? And now,
The blue and gold line painted across the asphalt is suddenly under their feet. Cas takes a deep breath. “Let’s go,” he says.
The music gets louder and louder as the chorus approaches, and Cas’ eyes wander around the park. Sure enough, he’s one of the only people
“No more convincing,” he says. “You’re just gonna have to trust me.”
“Goddamn it,” he mutters, and for the first time, he’s not sure if the response is because he’s having dreams about Cas in general, or the fact that he doesn’t want them to end.
about that. That feeling, whatever it is, mixes with a relief Dean finally starts to let himself feel now that they’ve put miles between them and Joliet. They did it; they really fucking did it.
, obviously, and we’re going to get into that in a second, but first, it’s our civic duty to comment on the fact that our baby boy Dean Winchester seems to have moved on from Lisa!”
Castiel’s eyes widen. “I’m sorry,” he says quickly. “I didn’t mean…” His voice trails off once he realizes that he doesn’t know
He stays that way for a few moments, trying to muster up the strength to force himself out of bed. He’s got practice in half an hour--
“Yeah, well, that’s likely comin’ a hell of a lot sooner than you think,” Bobby grouses, taking a seat in his own worn-out recliner in the corner. “What were you two thinkin’, springing the coop like that? And taking
“I was hoping it wouldn’t come to this,” he says, like he actually gives a shit what happens right now.
Cas laughs, half at Dean’s comment, half at the idea of Dean meeting anyone in his family other than Anna. “You’ll be fine. Everyone at the podcast likes you, and they mean more to me than the majority of my family.”
It’s getting late, the sky going progressively darker as he walks, and Cas does his best to peek over or around his box of work belongings to make sure he stays on the right track. He’s craning his neck around the right side of the box when he feels someone grab him from the left. He stumbles sideways into a narrow alley, and before he can so much as cry out, his box drops to the ground and he’s slammed up against a brick wall, staring down a gun.
Because tomorrow—one year, six months, and sixteen days later—come hell or high water, Dean Winchester’s getting out.
“—Castiel joined our ranks.”
Word travels fast, and police even faster, so they make quick work of the store. Sam zeroes in on a stack of button-up shirts and grabs the first one that looks like it’ll fit Cas. Dean scoops up a pair of trousers and is heading to meet Sam at the counter when a tweed waistcoat catches his eye. Picturing the way Cas had wanted to look nice back at Bobby’s, how this would look against his eyes, makes the decision easy, and he tosses it on top of the trousers.
messes,
“Is it Dean?”
“That depends,” Sam says. The woman quirks a brow, and she opens the door a bit wider, leaning against the jamb.
. “Nope. Staying out of this.” He glances up quickly and adds, “But if you could check and see when I’ll be able to end my Fraction-Zdarsky drought, that’d be good.”
“Obviously.” She winks and smirks at him. “Doesn’t mean we can’t hint every so often, though. Super subtle.”
At least he didn’t insist they all had to be matching.
When Cas shoves open the door to the break room, he makes a beeline for the couch and flops down onto it, letting one arm dangle off the side while the other rests on his chest. He closes his eyes for a few seconds, then looks around--the break room is just as stale-looking as the main hallways, the forced holiday cheer giving Cas secondhand embarrassment. Gabriel and Balthazar had set up a miniature tree in the corner, which is strung with lights--half of which have burnt out--and a mishmash of ornaments. All the decorations look like they want to be there just as much as Cas does, which is to say, not at all. There’s a half-eaten cake shaped like a snowman sitting on the break room table, left over from yesterday’s shift; Cas gives it a sidelong glance, then shakes his head and presses the heels of his hands into his eyes.
Cas sighs and runs a hand through his hair, cursing himself for not keeping his mouth shut. “You said you wouldn’t thank me for treating you like a fucking human, and I just thought it was funny, because I know plenty of people here who have had to grieve for their loved ones because you killed them, because you didn’t treat them like fucking humans. I have no expectations of you thanking me, especially because I know that you won’t be apologizing for what
The tent is quiet as he approaches, and Cas can’t decide if that’s a good or bad sign. On the one hand, no screams of pain or terror is good, but what if it’s silent because Michael had already
Cas shakes his head, angling his head up and planting a quick kiss on Dean’s cheek. “I believe ‘nerdiest’ went to your insistence for a Batman and Robin couples cosplay last year.”
, knowing he’s the reason they’re not on their way to Lawrence right this very second.
Cas recognizes Dean’s voice and looks up to see him balancing a tray dotted with drinks and appetizers. The question is asked good-naturedly enough, but when Dean sets down the tray and starts serving, Cas can tell the usual warmth he’s grown so accustomed to is missing.
Cas snatches the tie out of his hands. “I like it the way it is, Dean,” he says, smoothing over it with his hand.
Dean chuckles, grabbing his water and twisting off the cap. “You’re sorry I’m bi?” he asks before taking a long swig.
Cas slumps down in his chair and shoots daggers at Hannah, who promptly avoids his gaze. “Key word being
Sam looks at him like he’s crazy, but Dean doesn’t see
“Any injuries?”
Michael nods toward Winchester, whose head is still hanging down, resting against his chest. “Has he been like that all night?”
“Trust the process, Sammy!” With that, he slams down hard on the gas, sending them careening forward through the flames.
He didn't know what he was expecting--maybe something closer to missing persons files they show on
A train.
“You don’t need to make excuses for liking someone, Cas,” she says quietly. “I know you feel like you have to, but you don’t. Let him make you happy. He’s obviously good at it.” She gives him a small smile, and he can feel his face getting red.
Cas isn’t sure who the younger boy in the photo is, but he immediately recognizes the one with the sandy blonde hair as a tiny Dean--he’d know that crooked smile and dusting of freckles anywhere. He looks so
Things are going well, until Cas feels Dean startle a little around mile twelve, when the screaming seems to get ten times louder than normal.
Sam and Cas look up as Dean slides back into the booth next to Cas, waiting for them to fill him in. Instead, Sam shakes his head and finishes his drink.
tourist, huh? Gabe asks, clapping him on the shoulder. “Just go with the flow, baby bro.” He holds up a finger and grins. “Didja catch that? Regular Mark Twain over here.”
She smiles, and boy has Dean missed seeing that adoration on Sammy’s face. “As it turns out, you can do a lot more when you’ve had time to practice. So I say,” she says, gripping Sam by the lapels of his shirt and pressing a chaste kiss to his lips, “let’s get you your license, Samuel.”
Sam slams the door shut before turning his attention on Dean. “Yeah, now what, genius?” Dean knows this is crazy, knows it’s ridiculous, he doesn’t need anyone reminding him of that. When he looks at his brother, though, when he can see the fear and panic in his eyes that he’s trying real hard to hide,
The silence resumes as they walk for a few minutes more, and when the Winchesters’ pale blue house comes into view, Castiel is surprised to feel a slight pang of disappointment. He’d like to walk with Dean more, maybe describe the trees lining the streets, or the hideous shade of orange that’s painted over their neighbor's’ front door. Instead, he pulls them to a gentle stop at the beginning of the cobblestone path and says, “We’re here.”
Jess laughs, a high, bright sound that Dean normally likes to hear, but not when it’s being aimed at him. Her cheeks are slightly flushed from her wine, and she rests her head on Sam’s shoulder, a grin spread across her face. “Oh, come on, Dean, you two were
Dean looks up, his brow furrowed behind his sunglasses. “Is what mine?”
of Dean’s name in Novak’s mouth is sweeter than honey; sweeter still is the realization that he hadn’t said it disparagingly—rather, he’d defended him. And, well, the last thing Dean’d expected from this morning was for Novak to make his debut as a knight in shining armor, but he’ll take it. He chuckles before snatching the biscuit out of Sam’s hand and taking the bite he’d been trying for earlier.
. He’s got half a mind to spring up and tackle Cas, but before he can, Cas’ palm is on his chest, pushing him back down. Dean’s eyes follow Cas’ arm up until he sees Cas on his knees before him, shoulders heaving, his own dick hard and leaking in his hand.
That’s the exact thought that’s been getting him through the last few days, but Cas decides to keep that fact to himself. Instead, he presses a kiss to the top of Oliver’s head and strokes his fingers through the soft fur between his ears.

“Okay,” Aiden’s dad says, holding the phone in front of his face, “on three. One...two…”
It’s a copy of the latest issue of
Dean works deftly, tonguing Cas’ slit and working his way up and down Cas’ shaft. More than anything, Cas wants to tear off the blindfold and watch as Dean continues, and lets out a soft whimper as he tugs against the cuffs around his wrists.
“I will if you’re not careful,” he says coolly, stopping Dean in his tracks. Dean can hear Sam in his head—
Cas waits to warn Dean about turns, curbs, or obstacles at the last second, which doesn’t give Dean enough time to react without stumbling or tripping himself up, but they finally figure out something that vaguely resembles a plan.
done, either.”
The wads of cash are sitting heavy in Dean’s pockets, and he chews on his lower lip. He knows Sam’s looking to follow his lead this time, and with two guns on them in the middle of nowhere, even in his most optimistic state, Dean’s not thrilled with their odds. He sighs and starts digging into his pockets, taking one last second to feel the weight of all that cash in his hands before tossing them out onto the grass.
Out of the corner of his eye, Cas sees Dean spread his arms wide with a grin. “The one and only!”
Cas drops onto the bed and plays with the bottom of his deep blue tie, watching Gabe continue to preen over himself in the mirror while Balthazar pulls himself together in the bathroom, shrugging into his dark navy suit jacket.
Castiel sighs and wishes he was back with Sam and Anna eating Boston cream donuts and drinking coffee.
He’d been alone then, scared but trying not to show it—keeping a stiff upper lip, John used to say, back when he’d talk to Dean at all. It’s a strange comfort having Sam and Cas by his side this time, but that’s short-lived when he catches sight of Heyerdahl leaning up against the bench.
“Dean!” the man says, smiling sweetly as he gets to his feet. “You just always seem to pop up—” he reaches over and pulls a gold dollar coin out from behind Dean’s ear, “—out of nowhere, don’t you? We should get a bell on you.”
The man stumbles backward, a hand clutching his face as he stares at Dean. “
“Just like you, asshole,” Gabe mutters, shoving him hard in the arm. Balthazar laughs.
“When’d you figure it out?”
“Hey, what do you think I should wear for the next elegant night?” Gabe asks Balthazar, punching him in the upper arm. “Leopard tie or jacket? Or
Dean scoffs, fumbling for the right words as he gestures vaguely at him. “Looking like that. All dapper and fancy,” he says, but only because
Dean stops short and stares at him until Cas’ mouth breaks into a smile. “Fuckin’ leave

They spend a few minutes walking around mile nineteen, but then Cas realizes where they are in the race.
“Yes.” Castiel is already fumbling over his words, feeling the excuse already collapsing down around him. “In order to, I don’t know, work with him.”
He gestures to the opening before getting slowly to his feet. “Think we’ve got trouble, fellas.”
“They said something funny,” Cas insists, nodding toward the family at the table behind them.
“I...oh.” Cas starts trying to brainstorm for some kind of excuse as to why he’s suddenly become so head-over-heels for Dean, but before he can, he feels Anna’s hand on his elbow and looks up into his sister’s eyes.
“That’s not a question,” Dean says. His voice is tight, Cas can tell he’s trying to be funny, but he shakes his head.
“What’re you going to do until I’m done?”
Charlie nods. “Sure is. So whaddaya say?” She waggles her eyebrows and smiles hopefully. “You boys help us out one last time, as thanks for us turning ya into superstars?”
Cas concedes and gets to his feet, wincing at the way the soles of his shoes stick to the cement floor, which is coated in stale beer, peanut shells, and who knows what else. He takes a sip of his beer as some music starts playing, and Dean grins.
“There we go.” Dean smacks a closed locker in victory as they pass. “So, let me run something by you.” He looks to Cas for permission to continue.
Aiden turns to his dad. “I want a green one!”
“Describe it to me.”
Dean gasps as Cas swallows him down, his tongue moving soft and slow as he uses one hand to give sporadic gentle tugs to Dean’s balls while the other strokes up and down his inner thigh. Dean lets his head drop back as his eyes slide closed, hips canting slowly upwards. His hand finds Cas’ hair and he tangles his fingers in it, tightening his grip with every stroke and suck Cas graces him with.
.” His lips form into an angry pout, and Castiel is not thinking about how goddamn
He really, really hopes he’s special.
Dean keeps his hand still for a few seconds, then slowly starts to stroke his thumb along Cas’ cheekbone. He slides his hand down until his thumb runs over Cas’ chapped lips; he has just enough time to wet them before he feels Dean surge forward and press his lips against his own.
“You all right?” Sam finally asks, keeping his eyes on Cas’ retreating form.
Dean’s staring at him, his eyes wide and flustered, and the rest of him doesn’t appear to be faring much better. The top buttons of his shirt are undone, his tie hanging loose and crooked around his neck. There’s something that looks like wine splashed across much of his shirt. If Cas had thought he looked off at dinner, it was nothing compared to now.
The redhead laughs. “Your boyfriend’s got good taste. Tell him the next issue’s coming out next week.”
He coughs, cutting his mind off and trying to pull himself together after a few seconds of holding up the line. “Yeah,” he finally says, careful to keep his focus on Benny while avoiding the gazes of Sam and Novak that he can feel drilling into him. “Yeah, you too. See ya around, boys.”
He could just call the bakery.
Eventually, Ben joins in a game of dodgeball, and Dean slips back onto a steady, non-bouncy surface and heads back to Lisa. She beams at him from the table she’s seated at and offers him a sip of her soda as he drops down next to her.
“No!” Sam’s eyes widen a little, and he glances behind him at the closed door. “No, no, no. Listen, man, you don’t know him, but he’s wanted to do this for a long time. Ever since he started running. I think he’s just scared, but he just needs a push.” Sam mimes pushing someone gently, flashing Castiel a hopeful half smile that doesn’t make Castiel feel any better.
There’s a pause, then, “Yeah. Yeah, we’ll figure it out. Okay.” The relief in Dean’s voice takes Cas by surprise, the idea that even a small part of Dean might have been expecting him to be so upset by this whole thing that he would’ve ended it then and there.
Cas tries to focus on the game, he really does, but if the Red Sox want him to pay better attention, they should probably hire a pitcher as attractive as Dean Winchester to play for them.
“Dean,” he says, “we’re almost to the Hill.”
She riffles the magazine’s pages against her microphone and Charlie cringes at the shitty audio, slicing a finger across her throat to get her to cut it out. “If y’all haven’t seen the latest issue of
Castiel swallows hard, trying to fight back the urge to throw up his lunch. He’s successful--relatively, at least--and manages to give his sister a forced smile.
Cas feels a lump form in his throat and grips his phone tighter when he sees the photo, the selfie the girls had snapped with Dean earlier that night. They’d used every
Suddenly, his head is filled with Sam’s teasing and Rowena’s accusations, as well as his own thoughts and comments from that afternoon.
“Uh, good morning.”
He imagines just leaning into Dean, casual and nonchalant, like couples do.
Cas studies him for a few seconds before turning back toward the fire. “Yes,” he says finally, so soft Dean almost misses it. “I think I do.”
, then looks over at Cas. The guy’s face, normally all hard lines and sharp edges, has gone soft and hopeful, a concerned little furrow between his brows. He takes a hesitant step toward Dean, who takes a step back.
Dean grins, more than ready to take the challenge for what it is. “Is that right?” Mirroring Novak’s stance, Dean stays still for another moment before taking a step back and stretching his arm out wide toward the road in front of them. “Well, then lead the way, handsome.”
Almost.
, “—perhaps I’ll die upon this train.”
“Relax,” Dean says. “They’re not looking at you.” He takes a long sip of his coffee and nods at them over the cup; that seems to do the trick. They smile and go back to their own breakfasts. “You got any plans today?”
“Sorry, what was that?” he asks, giving her a forced, apologetic smile. Too bad
Alistair’s lips curl into an unpleasant smile as he approaches Winchester. He makes to untie the gag under his captive’s contemptuous glare, but at the last second, he grabs a fistful of his hair and jerks his head back instead, exposing the long column of his neck. Winchester lets out a pained grunt at the unexpected movement, but keeps his gaze fixed on Alistair.
Cas stares at him. “I thought we were just here to sleep,” he says. “We need to be awake in four hours.”
Sam shrugs, kicking at a pebble. His answer, when he finally does give one, is simple. “We walk.”
Cas snorts, a noise that he’s sure is among the least attractive sounds he’s ever emitted, but Dean doesn’t react. “That’s cute,” Cas says, circling Dean’s nipple slowly with his finger.
They stand there awkwardly, and Dean’s heart is picking up the pace with every passing second as he tries to push past the sea of self-doubts he’s got about how tonight went. He usually never has to deal with this, he’s cool and confident before asking people out, but something’s different with Cas. Dean wants to impress him, to make sure that he hadn’t just misread the past few hours. In an attempt to convince himself that he’s not making this shit up, he reminds himself of everything that happened tonight, of the smiles and hand-holding--okay, not
Dean’s still got his hand on Sam’s head and glances down at him with a smirk. “Can’t have you losin’ those luscious locks, there, Sammy,” he says, putting his weight on Sam’s head to hoist himself up quick before dragging his little brother to his feet as well. “Now come on!”
“Really.” He wants to be sick. He can feel Lisa’s eyes on him, and he knows the goddamn cameras are there, too, just waiting for him to give them something good. For him to yell or cry or try to change Lisa’s mind or demand answers or refuse to leave so they have to drag him away. Some dude did that a few seasons ago, and people are
, Castiel,” she says, “more than any other school you applied to.” She reads the acceptance letter as if it’s the first time she’s seeing the words, even though they’d emailed him a copy a few weeks before the mailed version arrived. “This will be good for you,” she continues, leaning over and wrapping an arm around his shoulders. “A fresh start.”
“You must miss it.”
Winchester?
“He deserves someone who makes him happy,” Billie says decidedly.
He pronounces
on me?”
“I can still appreciate a quality specimen,” Gabe says with a smirk. “Too bad he’s taken, though.”
“Jeannette’s family just came to pick her up,” he says, leaning on the desk and grabbing some chocolate from the box sitting next to her. A resident’s family had dropped them off as a small Christmas gift to the staff, and Cas wants to hug whoever brought them in.
Cas shakes his head. Of course he doesn't mind if they talk about it later, which implies that Dean's not bored with him, fully intends to talk to him in the future, and might be willing to share something more personal with him, something he doesn't tell just anyone.
Dean claps him on the shoulder. “Seriously, I’d have no idea that you just got your nose bashed in by some asshole at a concert.”
Cas remembers a lot of things about that interaction. He remembers blushing
"Who doesn't like macaroni and cheese?"
Then Dean’s stomach grumbles.
“Every detail, Cas!” Hannah shouts as Cas mouses over to the exit button. “Every! Detail!” He closes the chat and logs out.
“Let’s get lunch.”
Cas hesitates, unsure if the question is rhetorical or not, but then adds a soft, "I'd appreciate it."
Cas has to stop himself from replying before the entire offer is out of Dean’s mouth, but once it is, he wastes no time in giving him a small, shy smile, one Gabriel had told him years ago makes peoples’ hearts melt. Or at least, makes them do whatever Cas wants.
“Don’t I need a degree or something?”
“For what?”
bit louder than necessary.
“All right,” Sam says, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand before pushing his chair back. “We gotta at least
“Well,
“I take it you like them?” Cas asks, pleased. The sweet and salty taste is still running rampant in his mouth, and Cas helps himself to some more of his and Dean’s handiwork.
“And now we’ve got...Dean Winchester!”
“What’s that?” her mother asks, a little too suspiciously for Dean’s liking.
,” he mutters, rubbing at his knee as he looks up at Anna. “Fuck, are you okay?”
Cas takes a few steps forward and reaches out to place his hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Dean, what’re you--”
“I noticed.”
Sam glances between the two of them before chuckling uncomfortably. “Can I get a word with you?” he asks, grabbing Dean by the elbow and leading him off to the side of the campsite. “And leave that shirt here; it smells like shit.”
Sam's flustered, that much is obvious, but he still gives Cas a tired grin in return. "Hey, man." He's trying his best to sound warm and inviting, like he usually does, but his attempts fall flat this time.
,” he breathes, watching as the man he ran into looks up. He looks at Dean with startled blue eyes, and Dean feels like he’s just gotten the wind knocked out of him. He looks the guy up and down as discreetly as possible--which is, not very discreetly at all--mussed dark hair, a wrinkled burgundy pullover sweater, and dark, worn-out jeans, and, well, color Dean impressed.
Lisa spends the night mingling with the thirty some-odd men, laughing at jokes, swooning over biceps, assuaging fears. With the help of a handful of PAs and production interns, she manages to keep everyone’s names straight, and soon enough, everyone’s on their fifth or sixth drink, and the sun is beginning to rise on the mansion.
Cas had been planning on laying low on Saturday. Chuck had given them a rare day off after their victory, and despite Gabriel’s constant pestering that he should get out more, Cas’ plans had included nothing but catching up on homework, maybe reading for a while on the quad, and getting to bed early.
him, which is slowly but surely driving Cas insane. He wrings his hands awkwardly in his lap and takes a deep breath before plunging into something he’d thought about venturing into for a few days now: small talk.
“For trying this. For being you.”
Castiel sighs before finally looking Dean in the eye. “This is my first day doing--” he waves his hand around the room “--
to drop off in Dean's room. It's only 9:00, Dean would still be in his 8am, so Cas leaves it with Mike. He walks back to his room, still riding the ends of the emotional high he got last night, when he sees a note on his and Gabe's door that he didn't notice when he left. It's taped under his name tag, and written on a jagged piece of lined paper, as if someone hastily ripped it out of their notebook.
Cas glares at her. “I should say no right now, just to spite you.”
“I hate you,” he finally says through gritted teeth.
thing for my birthday, it’d be for my two brothers and I to have a boys’ trip and take the Novak genes international. I mean, can you imagine? It’d be so—” He cuts himself off before pressing his fingers to his lips and offering a sloppy chef’s kiss. “—magnifique.”
“And?”
“Bless you,” a voice says quietly behind him, and Dean freezes. He knows that voice, but more important, he knows the person
“Dead,” Dean mutters, and Cas resists the urge to slap him.
"Move a little to your right…good, good, good," Cas says, trying to line himself up as close as possible to a volunteer with long blonde hair and a wide smile. As they approach, she starts cheering specifically for them.
Castiel looks up, startled that Dean had noticed Sam is still there. Sam’s eyes narrow, but he closes the door. Dean doesn’t start walking again until he hears the door click shut. He stops at the fence and leans his cane against it.
For the first time in their brief conversation, Sam looks uncomfortable. Castiel guesses that he doesn’t look this way often, and waits for an explanation.
have a spark inside him; it just wasn’t for fighting, and that’s the exact opposite of what his parents had been hoping to hear.
Dean hams up the surprise for Ben’s sake, but it’s clear that he’s also a little taken aback by the bluntness of the boy’s statement. “That so?”
, this is just fucking unbelievable. Dean scoffs. “Are you forgetting who kicked whose ass here?”
“Oh, Jesus Christ,” he breathes, dropping the book defeatedly onto his desk.
Dean looks up at him flatly. “Gee, thanks.”
It takes the passing of three packed trains to convince Cas that it won’t kill him to walk the two miles back to his apartment once they’ve finished recording, and he’s heading up the steps toward the street when his phone buzzes in his pocket.
Instead, Cas shifts his legs slightly so that the bags flop down onto the coffee table, curls his legs underneath himself, and gently rests his head on top of Dean’s, Dean’s arm still wrapped around his shoulders. As Dean shifts in his sleep, snuggling up further against him, Cas decides that he could handle having shin splints again, especially if this would be the end result.
The jury is still out on this, but Cas thinks they might have a point.
Hannah’s eyebrows shoot up in surprise. “Cas, today is Friday.”
“Hey,” Dean mumbles, rubbing his eye underneath his sunglasses.
“There’s a difference between putting yourself out there at a goddamn…” Dean waves his hand, frustrated as he tries to think up the right words, “...speed-dating night down at Dive Bar and putting yourself out there on national
. Just because Dean can’t see him, doesn’t mean that he can’t tell Castiel is practically ogling him. “Are you, uh, good?” he stammers, grasping desperately for an excuse. “Need water or anything?”
“Railing on your left, four steps,” Cas mumbles as they approach the steps, “first one is here now.”
Lisa pauses. “I thought we’d be getting dinner at your family’s place,” she says, trying—and not exactly succeeding—to look casual and not at all panicked as Dean puts the car into park.
As pissed and frustrated as he is, though, a tiny part of his brain still can’t believe that he
Dean suddenly gets a burst of energy at the mention of his favorite breakfast foods, and tosses the pillow aside. “Really?” he asks, his fingers feeling around the floor before landing on the balled-up socks he had left there the night before.
saved. They’ve all been watched, and they’re taking up valuable memory space. Cas mentally chides himself for not deleting them and opens the folder to do just that, but stops short.
What Dean wouldn’t give for a goddamn beer or six right about now.
“Well, let’s see, here,” Sam says, squinting up ahead of them. “North’s thataway, which means I’d keep following this road here until you get to—”
“Either of you planning to fill me in?” he asks once they enter the living room. He glances at Cas, then adds, “And introducing me to the third stooge, while you’re at it?”
The guy flashes him another lopsided grin that makes Cas blush all the way from his toes to the tips of his ears. “Dean Winchester,” he says. “Third rotation.” He steps forward and sticks out his hand for Cas to shake, and Cas goes to reach for it with his catcher’s mitt.
supper attached, so he toes off his now laceless boots and rolls up each of his pant legs to just below the knees before heading to the river.
"And he has sex a lot," Cas adds without thinking.
“Can you tell me what all this
Twenty minutes later, and Cas has just finished recapping all the ways he thought he hated Dean; he spends the next twenty-four disproving each one, and the next thirty-two describing the Dean he didn’t think existed.
but instead he just nods and worries his lower lip with his teeth. “I’m sorry,” he says again.
“Personal’s good.”
ends.”
“Yeah, but I’m not sure he’ll be in the mood for running.”
Anger and embarrassment, hot and bright, start to well up in the pit of Castiel’s stomach on Dean’s behalf, and Castiel glares at his friend. “That’s rude, Balthazar. And I don't even know anything about him, or what he looks like, or if he's single--”
“I meant for work. Business as usual. Another day, another dollar, right?” He winks, clicking his tongue against his teeth in the way he knows Sam can’t stand.
“Blind runner coming through! To your left! To your left!” A particularly bony runner narrowly avoids smacking Dean in the face with her elbow, and Dean plows forward with Cas right next to him. When he’s sure that they have a clear path, Cas keeps his eyes trained on the ground, and he starts to count out the steps they have left.
Dean nods and starts making his way toward the bathroom door. “Do me a favor, Cas,” he says. “Don’t beat ‘im up too bad. After all, if he didn’t drag you to this show, I never would’ve elbowed you in the face, and then we never would’ve met.”
“Thank you,” he says defeatedly, and Michael gets up from behind his desk.
That’s
“Hey, Lone Ranger.”
is.” He barrels into Cas’ cube and drapes an arm across his shoulders like they’re old pals, bringing his head in close to Cas’ and spreading both hands out wide. “His real job, hobbies, his favorite self-defense move, what he orders at the bar on Saturday nights.” Zachariah chuckles. “The
“So, I’ve got a jock for a roommate, huh?” he asks, jumping backwards back onto his bed and nodding toward Cas’ gear.
, Cas pleads with himself, but no matter how hard he tries, he can’t bring his legs to move. His eyes scan the alley frantically, trying to locate the gun the Colt had knocked away, but it’s nowhere to be found.
It feels like an eternity before the wardens get everyone up and start herding them all toward the mess for a quick breakfast. Dean schools his face into a blank expression, something that won’t betray his excitement and anxiety all rolled up into one. He’s sure Sam’s doing the same, and Novak’s face barely ever cracks into anything other than that
“I mean, not the
, they’re going to finish this thing, but he settles on a tiny tug on their rope instead.
, Sam!”
The studio’s tiny, but Dean’s still entranced by the posters and framed records they pass, and he damn near stops in his tracks when they get to the sound booth. The sound boards and systems and equipment—they’re all responsible for some of the best memories he’s got of his childhood, and seeing them sends him back to nights when he was younger, when things were better. When all four Winchesters would pile into the sitting room to listen to the radio, Dean hopping up into their dad’s lap while their mother fed Sammy and scolded John every time he’d turn up the radio instead of muting it during particularly inappropriate Abbott & Costello bits. John would apologize before making exaggerated faces at Dean, who’d dissolve into fits of giggles that made his dad laugh too, ruffling his hair.
“Uh, guys?”
"Can you hear me?" Cas shouts over the noise, and Dean nods.
Dean breathes heavily through his nose, and Castiel bristles. It’s not a sigh, exactly, but it’s not a happy sound, either, and Castiel reinforces his game plan of keeping to himself as much as possible. If Dean doesn’t want any help, then that’s exactly what Castiel will give him.
?” Cas’ eyes are wide, anxiety creasing his brow.
There’s a new photo on Dean’s timeline in addition to tonight’s, one Cas hadn’t seen over break. A beautiful woman with flowing blonde hair and a kind face is sitting on a couch, two little boys on each knee. She’s snuggling them close, mussing up their hair and laughing; everything about her looks blissful, like there’s nowhere else she’d rather be.
is almost more than he can handle.
“Dean, my--”
Dean cringes at the shattering of glass and the sound of Garth’s whoop as he lines up another shot. Sam doesn’t need to hear anything else; he leans forward, resting both elbows on the front seats and hissing, “Dean, pull over!”
There must be some kind of event going on today, what with all the music playing, little ones laughing and chasing each other through the streets, and smells of fried food wafting through the air. Crowds of folks are pressing past them to get to the bandstand in the town square, and Dean’s got half a mind to follow them and try to track down a funnel cake or three when Sam steers them away from the crowds and toward the general store across the street.
her?”
By the time Cas's break arrives, he’s so tired he can barely think straight.
Dean barks out a laugh at that. “Yeah, wonder if it’ll get us a discount here.” He tilts his head back and downs the rest of his drink fast and quick, using the back of his hand to wipe his mouth clean. And hell, this ain’t the time nor the place Dean wants for their first real kiss anyway, but he’ll be damned if he lets it ruin their night.
“I hate you both,” Dean mutters before taking a sip of his beer.
Before the mugger can remove his mask, though, Cas watches, stunned, as the Colt manages to rear one leg back and kick him hard in the gut. The mugger staggers backward, releasing his throat, and the Colt springs into action. With a flurry of punches and kicks, the Colt’s got the mugger pinned on the ground, and Cas is fixated at the way the Colt’s straddling him, glaring down at him with hatred in his eyes.
Small mercies.
Cas considers this, then snaps his fingers. “You need to buy three tickets for some kind of special deal or something, then, don’t you?”
“Don’t go giving ‘em any reason to suspect anything,” Sam breathes, his voice barely there.
Castiel’s heart is in his throat as he starts his daily run, and he starts to berate himself about his newfound desire to see Dean again, or at least get a chance to talk to him.
been happy about it at all, and from his brief interaction with him that day, Castiel can’t picture him backing down or changing his mind about it, or, well, anything, for that matter.
been expecting a hug or something, but beggars can’t be choosers.
“Yeah.” Dean rubs the back of his neck with his free hand and looks down. “Sorry about that,” he says, and that’s the
For a split second, Castiel fears for his own safety; this woman's out for blood, and he would prefer that it not be his.
“Th’nks, Cas,” Dean says into his shoulder.
Cas softens. His friends’ acceptance of his desire to keep things private had been the last thing he’d expected, and for Charlie to offer to do so freely reminds him of why they’re all so close in the first place. “Thank you,” he says.
“Gentlemen,” he says, drumming lightly on the table with open palms, “fuck prohibition.”
Cas throws an empty fast food cup at his head, and Gabe cackles as he dodges it, eyes bright with delight, before turning around and smacking the roof of the car in tempo with the music.
“Dean, I don’t know—”
“You’re standing next to a blind person sign,” Cas says slowly, “and flipping off whoever’s taking the picture.”
The welcome packet had been sitting on Cas’ bed for hours before he finally gathers the courage to look at it.
and (eventually) stupid sex comics, just like their dads.
“If you insist.” He digs his hands into the bag and scoops up a couple of handfuls. Glancing around quickly, he shoves the wads of crumpled bills down into his pockets before grabbing more.
The street is lined with mailboxes, all of which jut out slightly into the street. Castiel hadn’t even thought about it; he’s never given mailboxes a second thought, but judging by the way Dean’s got an arm wrapped gingerly around his side, he probably should have.
The bottles clink together when Balthazar reaches forward, sticks his hand inside the bag, and pulls one out, admiring it like it’s the Hope Diamond. “Hello, my lovely,” he says, nuzzling the bottle to his cheek before tucking it reverently next to him.
Dean Winchester,
Disheveled or not, this guy is
“No,” he says, squinting as he tries to figure out whether or not Bobby’s fucking with him. “Now you’re just talking crazy.”
“Tragically, I’m afraid so,” Balthazar says, flipping open a pizza box and grabbing a slice. Cas can see the heat radiating off of it, and cringes as Balthazar struggles to inhale the thing without scalding his mouth—or losing any of the toppings—in the process.
? He’s not good with words at the best of times, and this is just...
“Congrats, Cas!” he says excitedly, embracing Cas as Anna does the same to Dean. “He’s so happy, dude,” he adds softly before breaking the hug.
“A few days.”
“You try to scream and I’ll cut out your tongue,” Alistair says softly, showing Winchester the gleaming knife tucked away in its sheath at his hip. With that, Alistair releases his hold on Winchester’s hair, tugs at the knot at the back of his head, and pulls the gag out of his mouth.
to Cas, that is, and Dean’ll be damned if that happens anytime soon. Instead, he’s stuck grappling with the fact that despite it all, he
“Not as easy as it looks, huh?” Dean says. His back is turned to Cas, but Cas can hear the smile in his voice.
“Aiden!” his mom says, her breathing heavy. “What have I told you about interrupting people?" She turns to Dean and Cas, smiling apologetically. “I’m so sorry,” she says, “Aiden here is still learning his manners.”
“Shit,” he mutters, staring down at his lock screen and the tiny “1 missed call, 1 new voicemail” notice. The number is new, nobody in his contacts, and he swallows hard in a futile attempt to control his nerves as he unlocks his phone and presses play on the message.
“What?”
Hannah is quick to jump up and make a beeline for Dean, who grins widely at her. “I’m so glad you could make it, thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to talk with us,” she says, grabbing his hand with both of hers and shaking it vigorously.
Written in yellow script on a light blue placard is
She’s silent for another agonizing moment before she too breaks into a grin. “Not bad, boys,” she says approvingly. “Not bad at all.”
“Uh, there’s a stick right in--” The stick snaps in two as Dean’s feet pass over it easily, and Castiel’s cheeks go pink. “Never mind.”
“Isn’t that what everyone does?”
“Get a room, huh?” Gabe says, smacking Balthazar on the shoulder before turning to Cas on the other side of the backseat. He smiles widely and hands him a bottle. “For you, my good man.”
Dean, one of today’s chosen ones.
the goddamn thing, but what if he's just really good at lying, at giving people what he thinks they want? What if Cas pushed things too far, too fast, and now Dean doesn't want anything to do with him anymore? Taking a deep breath, Cas finally manages to stammer out a quick, "He's not sick."
They come to a stop a few minutes later, in the middle of an intersection that to Cas’ eyes, seems less than extraordinary. But Dean smiles widely, gesturing to the area in front of them with a flourish. “This is it.”
“I’ll do it.”
Castiel shakes his head quickly to try and rid himself of the thought.
"Explains how you know so much about books."
Cas tilts his head and watches as Dean feels around until he finds a drawer with a small tag on the handle, then opens it, pulls out a knife, and starts slicing the potatoes. He cuts slowly but certainly, and Cas is momentarily entranced by the methodic way Dean moves.
It’d be nice,
Cas shakes his head. “No, no, no. I’ve read the articles, I heard the safety presentation. They’ll leave without us. I’m not risking being stranded here just because you
Cas’ heart lurches, and suddenly, he’s really looking forward to their twelve miles tomorrow.
He holds the phone closer to his face as he squints against the light. Dean rolls his eyes and snatches the phone to try and read it for himself, but apparently the booze has other ideas, and he scoffs when the alcohol makes it seem like the words won’t stop moving on the screen.
Dean knocks his knuckles on the counter a few times before smiling awkwardly. “So, uh, yeah, I’ll just...see you there.”
It’s a total lie, of course, but Dean doesn’t need to know that.
“911, what’s your emergency?”
Cas grips the edges of the sink and looks up into the smudged mirror bolted to the wall to aim a contemptuous glare at his brother. When he does, though, he realizes that it’s not Gabriel standing behind him, but a boy he’s never met before. He looks about Cas’ age, a little skinny, with dirty blonde hair that mussed up from sweat. His hands are jammed deep into the pockets of his jeans, and his head is tilted to the side, a look of confusion and amusement on his face. Even in the dim lighting of the bathroom, Cas can see his bright green eyes shine, and he suddenly feels even more lightheaded than he already did.
“Don’t let me get in the way of a good time,” he says, raising his hands innocently.
“You boys ever seen
Cas’ cheeks are on fire, and he lays down, too, and smiles up at the sky. “I think I did, too,” he says softly. He turns toward Dean and studies him, his perfect jaw and patches of freckles and laughter lines, for a few seconds before saying, “What else do you miss?”
It’s such a simple, endearing explanation, so much so that Cas leans over and presses a kiss to Dean’s cheek with a soft smile. “Thank you, Dean.”
Cas presses his own hand over Dean’s before leaning forward and kissing him.
Sam shrugs and—did that fucker just
Cas smiles at him. “You wanted stories for your children, right?”
“What—where’re you—
“What is it, Anna?”
“Gotta pick up the pace, here, fellas!” he yells urgently, hopping over the beam while trying to avoid any soft spots in the loft’s floor.
“He’s beautiful,” Castiel says, and for a second, he’s not sure if he’s referring to the dog or his owner.
Cookies, cupcakes, eclairs, cakes--the sheer
The girl’s post has over 100 likes, and Cas hates,
Nobody seems particularly thrilled to see them, and that doesn’t change as Billie starts strumming her guitar. Dean supposes he shouldn’t be too surprised; compared to the acts these folks have seen, they’re probably nothing more than background noise to them. He can’t help but still feel a little indignant, though, and when he clears his throat, he makes sure to do so right in front of the mic. A couple of people in the front row glare up at him, but the rest are still too preoccupied with the rest of the evening to give any of them a second thought.
His co-hosts turn toward him, glaring. “What is
Guilt creeps up in Cas’ gut at the memory, and he bites the inside of his cheek. “I know I’ve already apologized, but I’d still like to—”
“Atta boy, Sammy!” Dean yells as his brother disappears into the train. That sight—his little brother one step closer to freedom—is enough to push him harder, and he’s got to; Novak’s hauling ass and, after another minute, has followed Sam inside.
The chime of his phone starts going off right when he bends down to start lacing up his sneakers. Not bothering to lift his head up, Castiel reaches up onto the coffee table and palms around until his hand lands on his phone. Distractedly, he unlocks it and tucks it between his ear and his shoulder, resuming tying his laces as he answers.
He gives Dean an uncertain smile, and Dean raises his eyebrows, taking the lack of a further response as a sign that the dude’s not interested in continuing their conversation.

“Since when has being late ever killed anyone?” Dean asks, his head in his closet as he tries to find something clean to wear.
“Yeah, yeah,” Ed says as Harry returns
“I told you where I
After a few moments, the kissing stops in favor of pressing their foreheads together, just breathing, taking each other in.
That had been exactly when Cas had decided he had no reason to trust anything that came out of Dean Winchester’s gorgeous goddamn mouth.
Castiel stares at him. “Beg pardon?”
Dean takes a few seconds to try and steady his breathing before shaking his head. "Get me some."
And, well.
Their eyes lock a few seconds later and Dean thrusts up once more into Cas’ mouth at the sight of those eyes and the way Cas’ lips curl into a knowing little smile around Dean’s cock.
Dean’s laugh rings out from the bar, and Cas smiles down at his feet, cheeks flushed, as he forces himself not to look back.
“P-please,” Cas breathes, but before he can say anything else, his mugger rears back and pistol-whips him hard across the face twice. Cas whimpers in pain as his knees buckle, and he starts slowly sinking to the ground. He’s stopped by the man’s hand around his throat, pulling him back up straight.
Dean jerks away from Cas’ grip, but he’s pliant when Cas grips him by the shoulders and forcibly turns him back around to face him again. “I’m sorry,” he says softly, tracing his thumb along Dean’s jaw. “I’m sorry for insulting your stupid sex comic.”
“Are you—you know what I mean; you’re just a—”
“Seriously, we’re gonna have to go a lot more often to make up for lost time.”
They make their way down the porch steps and head toward the road, Dean’s cane tapping against the cobblestone again. He reaches out a hand and feels around for the fence before leaving the cane leaning against it. He runs a hand through his hair, then holds it out.
He clicks over to the DELETE ALL button, but instead of hitting enter, he just keeps looking at the screen. The pilot episode is the first one listed, and his mind wanders back to the day the contestants had been announced, to the day that he first set eyes on Dean Winchester and his crooked, shit-eating grin that he never seemed to leave home without.
Novak and Sam have got their eyes on it too, and Dean can’t stop the proud grin that’s forming as he practically sees his little brother making calculations in his head. The tracks look to be about a half-mile away, and the train’s still got some ground to cover before it passes them by. If they run, they could make it. If it’s a cargo train, they could hop a ride and coast all the way to the city.
“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with my work-life ba—”
The sun beats down as they walk, trying to trace the road the way they came, back to Eudora, until they manage to hop a ride on a passing stake bed truck making its way back to town. They nestle themselves between the hay bales loaded up in the back, the driver none the wiser.
“I’ll let you know whenever I figure it out.”
,” and Castiel can’t help but smirk. Despite the peace and quiet he gets from running while everyone else is asleep, getting up early is his least favorite part of this whole thing, too.
that pout is, wondering how goddamn
Dean claps the driver on the shoulder and grins wryly. “Thanks, man. Hope your brewery gets off the ground soon.”
“Nothing,” Cas says.
Hannah and Billie are talking around them, he knows that, but he doesn’t care, because Dean’s in front of him and it finally doesn’t matter who sees, or when. The thing that finally jerks him back into reality is when Charlie plays a tiny bit of the
Greeted immediately with a barrage of comments and arguments from the three people in the shop, Cas is tempted to turn right back around and pray that they hadn’t seen him. Taking a deep breath and swallowing hard, he pushes himself forward and heads toward one of the towering bookshelves marked “Fantasy,” trying his best to be discreet with his eavesdropping.
and overanalyzing Dean’s knee resting against his. He remembers spending the night wondering if Dean’s action had...
Unsurprisingly, there are no open seats, but Castiel’s eyes lock on an opening near a man holding a book in one hand and standing against a window near the middle of the train, and he makes a beeline for it. Once he gets there, though, he understands why the spot is open in the first place; the guy smells
“How’s it going, Chuck.”
Cas nods and offers one more small, closed-lipped smile before turning his attention to setting out the cookies.
"Jesus," the kid mumbles, slumping down to the floor, his back against the wall. He pulls out his phone, punches in a few numbers, then holds it to his ear.
Dean tends to leave cabinets open after grabbing whatever food he wants, driving Cas up a wall as he closes them just a
“Know it like the back of my hand,” Dean says proudly.
looking
At least, he doesn’t think he will.
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Kinky,” he says, and Castiel is suddenly grateful Dean can’t see the way his cheeks go deep red at that.
“I, uh, I’ll give you two some time then, huh?” He claps Cas solidly on the back as he walks past with a genuine, “Glad to have you back, man.” His smile’s reassuring, but the knowing look he gives Dean is almost enough for Dean to pull a hand away from Cas’ cheeks to flip him off.
Dean doesn’t answer him, but his rapid breathing reminds Castiel that he hasn’t run in a while, so he decides to slow down the pace a little more, thinking Dean would appreciate it.
And if Dean’s tried on more than one occasion to mix a color that matches the blue of Cas’ eyes ever since that first meeting, that’s no one’s business but his own.
—with rows upon rows of ventriloquist dummies. Perched carefully on narrow wooden shelves, their eyes seem to follow Dean as his own dart around to take them all in. Dusty clothes and wide, dead eyes and limp legs hanging over the edges of shelves...the whole thing gives Dean the creeps.
“Do you think you could get it off?”
Dean waves off his concerns, clutching the fish closer to his chest. “I’ve always been one with nature, Sammy.”
Dean can hear Sam, sure, but he can’t move. He doesn’t know what to say, either, but every second he stays silent has him feeling like he’s losing it—losing
a voice over the speaker system booms. Cas is content to stay seated in the hard, tiny seat, but Dean nudges his shoulder.
isn’t you feeling good, man.”
"The first couple of months after everything happened just…" Sam tries for a few seconds to find the right words, but ends up shaking his head and focusing on his hands. "It fucked him up."
Bigger fish, indeed—Dean gets that as the goon who had a gun on Sam drives them out into god-knows-where while Crowley leers at them from the front seat, casually aiming the gun back and forth between the both of them.
As it turns out, Castiel and his cousin hadn’t seen each other for going on three years, something about Castiel’s father making up some hogwash about him having thrown himself off a bridge or in front of a train, which, Jesus. Dean’s old man had done some shit, but nothing as drastic as
The couple in the seats behind him get up and exit the train at the next stop, and Cas glances back over his shoulder before switching over to the
Dean sighs as the water pounds against his shoulders. It’s the first chance they’ve all had since Joliet to clean themselves up, and as Dean scrubs his hands over his own face, his mind starts drifting to Cas’, warm and clean, free of the dirt and grime Dean had grown so accustomed to over the months. He rests his palms against the shower wall as his mind drums up a picture of Cas.
“Dean?” he asks hesitantly, swinging his legs off the couch and moving into a sitting position.
“Is this yours?” he asks Dean.
“It’s tough,” Sam says, drumming his fingers on the paper. ”There weren’t any signs of a fight. Nobody kicked up a ruckus; hell, his beer was still there. I dunno, Dean.”
That gets Hannah’s attention, and she looks up at him with raised eyebrows. “And who might that be?”
Dean stops scratching Jack at that, pulling himself upright and looking in the direction of Cas’ voice. “Cas?” he repeats. “Wait, what day is it?”
When they’re through here, Dean thinks he’ll probably burn his.
“Of course!” Dean shouts over the din of the crowd and the rapidly swelling music.
Dean’s eyes dart toward his brother’s voice, watching as he points toward a woman navigating a railroad handcar toward them. Sam looks over his shoulder and gestures for them to get ready to hop on.
Dean had meant for it to sound excited, but it came out as more of a question, and no amount of editing could disguise the way his head snapped back questioningly toward the producers, as if he was really asking if he should know them. He flashes Lisa a confident smile and they snake their way through to the middle of the crowd and start dancing slowly together. The band croons about love at first sight while the audience members record everything and snap photos destined for social media, and Dean tucks a strand of Lisa’s hair behind her ear.
“You can say that again, Novak,” Billie says.
, is what he’s trying to say.
Dean drops down next to his shirt, rolling onto his back with a frustrated sigh, the grass and pine needles tiny pinpricks against his bare skin. Tucking one hand behind his head, he gazes up at the sky, grappling with the fact that while, hell yeah, he’d love to see Sam’s awestruck eyes at his success, the ones he’s
“You’re not the one who’s actually competing, so you don’t need a qualifying time. You just need to work with him and make sure you can keep up with him, then, just, run with him.”
Dean raises an eyebrow at Cas, but doesn’t comment. “Glad to hear it,” he says instead with a grin. “This’ll be fun.”
Charlie had filled them in while she’d adjusted their beards: apparently tonight’s a rally for Cain Omundson, who’s running against Lawrence’s current mayor, Zachariah Fuller. Dean, for one, is thrilled—anyone going up against that racist, homophobic schmuck gets top marks in his book.
Balthazar smirks at him. “Getting protective of him already, eh?”
bullshit, “because you like men.” It’s not a question, more like a request for confirmation, and Dean looks up, surprised to see that Cas is actually looking at him, and not in a disgusted way, either.
Cas stares at him, feeling more betrayed than he probably has the right to feel, and he can tell Dean’s working hard not to laugh. Cas narrows his eyes and crosses his arms over his chest. “Answer a question instead, then,” he says, sounding like a petulant elementary schooler.
“I’d like that.”
Suddenly, Dean snaps his head up and glares at Cas. “Why the fuck are you staring at me?” he demands. “Don’t think I can’t tell, Cas. It’s goddamn creepy.”
The little heart icon under the photo remains empty, and Cas lets his mouse hover over it. It’s an old photo, Dean would know he’d been doing some digging if he liked it, but a nagging voice at the back of his mind makes him want to click it, to show Dean that he’s there. Or something.
Another one of Dean’s favorites, a kid named Ben Braeden, raises his hand, but doesn’t wait to be called on before asking skeptically, “What do memes have to do with art?”
He’s about to get back to it when a crane of his neck has him realizing that he can keep working while still getting a peek at Cas as
The guy pushes up his own glasses before shrugging. “A girl with squirrel powers? Not exactly the strongest character to choose for a series reboot, you know.”
Somehow, they eventually manage to maneuver themselves to a lying position on the couch, with Dean on his back now and Cas straddling his hips, looking down at him.
According to Charlie, their recording wasn’t just “not bad,” but one of the best she’d heard in recent memory. Ushering them out of the studio, she’d explained that this would be a hit with the radio stations, and although Dean had had a feeling she’d been blowing smoke up their asses, none of that mattered when she’d handed each of them their share of payment.
“You can bet on it,” she says. He puckers his lips and blows her a quick, microscopic kiss that makes her face go as pink as her dress before heading inside. “[
“Cookies are snacks,” he mutters in justification as he parks across the street and heads for the building, the mismatched brick and pastel colors like a beacon welcoming him back. “And it's my choice.”
The next website offers a walkthrough tour of one of the ships. It’s not the exact one they’ll be on, but it’s more than enough to give Cas an idea of what he’s in for.
They’re losing to Northeastern 3-2 in the game that’ll decide who moves on to playoffs; it’s the bottom of the ninth, with two outs already on the books. Cas has read about games like these, but actually
“Can I ask you something?” Cas says hesitantly.
“No one’s asking you to.”
The five of them barrel up onto the stage and begin setting up. For Dean, that doesn’t involve much more than trying to get his bearings in front of a roomful of people. Singing in front of Charlie and Billie’s can in a tiny, one-room studio is one thing, but the dozens of folks packed in here tonight is practically enough to have Dean running for the hills.
Dean doesn’t know where to look.
“It’s been four hours, Dean.”
“Turns out our pal Alastair is a homophobic prick,” Dean says bluntly, and Lisa’s eyes widen.
Benny chuckles, taking a sip of his beer as he regards Dean. “I’m just sayin’, brother. It’s about time you put yourself back out there, don’t you think?”
Which is how Cas finds himself pressed up against fifty other people in a crowded subway car barreling toward Fenway Park on his supposed lazy Saturday.
Castiel feels like he’s ten years old and throwing a temper tantrum, but he groans and covers his face with his forearm.
“I, uh, no--”
“For everybody!”
, ladies!”
, he’s standing at Buckingham Fountain, ruining the days of thousands of Chicago tourists who’ve come to see a fountain that’s now taped off for “a special event.”
Cas gapes at it, staring at Dean’s blood-free finger, then up at Dean, who’s grinning wider than Cas has ever seen. “I…”
One of his favorite parts of the night comes in the form of watching Dean focus on the pitcher, his fingers tented over his mouth as he studies everything about him--how often he uses the rosin bag, how many times he taps his cleats against the rubber, his windup and delivery, everything.
“So what’d it feel like?” he challenges. “To have your heart broken on national TV in front of millions of people?”
,” says Victor Henriksen, a minor league hockey player from New York. Benny Lafitte, a restaurant owner from New Orleans, adjusts his tie nervously.
Dean still hasn’t left Cas’ head since dinner, making him more than a little distracted; by the fourth time Gabe accuses Cas of being bad luck at the casino, Cas practically stumbles over himself volunteering to take one for the team and get the fuck out: back to their cabin, to the main deck, he didn’t care, just anywhere but there.
“I just, I saw--”
Charlie beams, and sticks out her hand. “Even better.”
The faintest hint of a smile plays across Anna’s lips. “So?”
and leave her all the love!
Finally, they’ve reached the end of the gauntlet of photos, and there’s nothing between Cas and an order of lobster and a slab of chocolate fudge cake.
. He mulls this over for a second, but before he can even think about lying, Dean grabs Cas' coat lying on the floor and shoves it into his hands.
happened because he slipped on some ice on the way back from work.
“Bull
“I asked you to.”
Sam takes that moment to return to the sitting room, toweling off his ridiculous mop of hair. “He’s not lying,” he says, taking a seat next to Dean on the couch. His outfit’s got him looking like a bona fide academic, a white button-up shirt paired with brown checkered pants and suspenders. All he’s missing is the tweed overcoat (which, if Dean’s being honest, he’s surprised he hadn’t found in Bobby’s mishmash of clothes) with elbow patches. “What’re you on about?”
Cas’ eyes widen in surprise. “Poor thing?” he repeats. “Hannah, he's killed--”
Sam sounds surprised, and Cas can’t blame him; he and Dean weren’t scheduled to run today, and here he is, the morning of one of their few days off, standing on the Winchesters’ front porch with two armfuls of groceries.
“Okay.”
“Pick up where your friend left off.” He tries hard to keep his voice unfazed and casual, but Cas doesn’t have to listen hard to notice the way Winchester’s voice breaks near the end of the sentence.
Dean lets out a low whistle. “Eyes like fucking hawks, you Novaks. What’d she say?”
“Dean,” Cas hisses behind him. It sounds too much like he’s about to pick an argument, and Dean doesn’t have time for that; none of them do.
ineptitude, I’m assuming that’s not something you’d want Principal Turner finding out about. Am I right?”
“Fine,” Cas says cautiously. It’s weird seeing Naomi out in the wild; she never comes out of her office for anything if she can help it. He gets it, Cas is an introvert himself, but his boss takes “recluse” to a whole new level. “Is everything okay?”
He feels like a piece of shit; Dean’s the one who’s blind, and all Cas will have to do is yell something like, “Blind runner coming through!” or “Blind runner behind you on your left!” and yet

good a job of raising that kid. “Nothing but the clothes on our backs.”
“Already named them, boy. Keep up,” he says briskly, snapping his fingers. “Now why don’t we get that food wrapped up for you and we can take this somewhere more private?”
what those looked like, y’know?”
He’s taken aback when Dean makes eye contact with him, looking almost helpless. As if realizing what he must look like, Dean screws them shut and scrubs a hand over his face. Cas doesn’t move, watching the way Dean breathes slowly through his mouth as he pulls himself together.
been going great, if Sam and Jess hadn’t been spending the last half hour teasing Dean about his new flour-spotted crush.
thanks for reading!! i'm over on
“That was…” Cas’ voice trails off, and Dean decides to pick up the slack.
Judging by the way Dean’s cheeks go pink, the hint of a shy smile playing on his lips, Cas is pretty sure he did.
"But it wasn't bad at all for our first one. How about tomorrow we go for twelve miles, but do a hill a little earlier in the run?"
Cas glances down at the camera in his hands, feeling like he had temporarily forgotten it was there, and holds it up. Aiden’s mom herds him in front of them, muttering promises of ice cream if he stays still for this one picture, and Cas smiles to himself. He studies the family through the viewfinder, making sure their faces are all in focus and that there are no rogue joggers or dog-walkers making cameo appearances in the background. As he snaps the first picture, he finds himself wondering if this will be him and Dean someday. He knows they’ve only known each other for a few months, and been dating for even less, but his mind can’t help but imagine the two of them together, taking turns holding a tiny baby in their arms, a baby who will eventually love running and
