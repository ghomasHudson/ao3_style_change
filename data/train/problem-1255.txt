In one moment he felt cold sweat on his body. He froze on the spot. His hand gripped the lantern handle painfully. He stared into the woman's wide-open eyes, wondering if what he saw was real. He looked at her body but didn't have time to get a closer look. His face hit the nearby wall. He released the lantern to protect the rest of his body in a desperate gesture. He felt a cold, rough brick on his skin. Blood burst from his right cheek. He would have rubbed it off, but something was pressing the back of his head against the wall. He hissed as the whistle chain jerked abruptly from his neck. Everything was happening too fast. He took a breath to scream when he noticed something gleaming out of the corner of his eye. Immediately, he felt a cold blade against his throat. All determination to fight and face the attacker turned to anticipation for his next move.
They froze and looked at the place where this grunt came from. They saw a middle-aged man leaning out of the window. He looked like he had just got out of bed. John was sure the man woke up because of the sound of the shutter hit the wall.
John sat down in front of the woman who looked at her phone again, completely ignoring everything that was going on around her. She didn't look very busy, but she didn't look like she was going to talk to him neither. She reached for a cup of coffee on the table from time to time and quickly wrote something on her cell phone. John enjoyed the moment. He was sitting in front of a beautiful woman, he was not forced to make awkward conversations. He didn't even have to pretend that everything was fine. Anthea didn't say a word, yet he felt better with her than in the last two days. He enjoyed a nice and peaceful moment.
"Really?" Sherlock's voice was filled with disbelief and curiosity. John couldn't see his friend looking around, trying to understand his delight. "I don't know how shabby walls, moisture, and stench can be wonderful. And do you even realize John, what is the composition of this water? Eight percent of this water is fuel residues and human exc..."
The older man looked at John, who frowned in annoyance. What could cause Mycroft to react like this, and why did he blame him for such things? He completely did not understand this sudden outburst of anger. He unlocked the phone and looked at the screen. He saw one missed call, and Mycroft acted as if he had been trying to contact him for at least half a day.
"So beautiful" he heard a female voice next to him, but he completely ignored it. He wasn't going to admire the views. Maybe for ordinary people, it was one of those moments that gave them shivers ... but in his case, it didn't matter. Why would he admire something that had no value or was it just a short moment? Ordinary brief moments that ordinary people enjoyed.
John felt overwhelmed with thoughts of what Sherlock felt at the moment and if Mycroft was doing well. After some time, John had enough. He no longer wanted to wait idly for Mycroft's return - because there was no way of confronting Sherlock at the moment - so he got up off the couch. He felt dizzy but he walked to the door, massaging his numb thigh. When he stood in the hall and felt a breath of fresh air, he looked toward the nearby door. It was only now that he thought he didn't know if he would rather have the conversation between Mycroft and Sherlock be short or go on for some time. John was thinking about the pros and cons of this situation. But he didn't have enough determination to make the first move to check what was happening in Sherlock's apartment.
"And I want to apologize for all the malicious things I said. I didn't want it to sound like that. And that punch ..."
"I-I... I told you, this place is haunted." The corridor filled with the sounds of some heavy objects dropped to the floor. "Screw it!", a terrified voice began to move away from the door, along with the quick footsteps of two pairs of shoes.
"I'll let Mrs Hudson know you will come tomorrow," he said as if it were the most obvious thing, the next step in their relationship. "You must try the tea she makes in the morning. The address is 221B, Baker Street." Holmes reached for something in his pocket, then extended his hand in his direction.
"Mr. Holmes, welcome to our hotel. We have already prepared an apartment for you," said the man behind the counter cheerfully and almost excitedly. He took one of the hanging keys and personally led the men to the first floor. When he opened the door with an aristocratic movement, John felt a strong and refreshing wind on his face.
Mycroft looked at him. "No. Because, despite how it may seem, I also have feelings. I am afraid of the consequences of a mistake that we could make without thinking about the future".
John shuddered under her piercing gaze. He realized how she got what she wanted. At the same time, she was warm and gentle, he admired her, though now he had more respect for her than at the beginning. He had no doubt that even Mycroft submitted to her persuasion when she looked at him that way. "I like he always tries to be a gentleman," he said after a long time.
"I'd love to go to this meeting with you," John interrupted him immediately. He felt stupid that the previous evening had ended this way, though for some reason he knew that Mycroft didn't blame him. Maybe he was even happy with this turn of events because he missed the compulsory presence at a party full of people.
He noticed that Holmes's footsteps were as quick as his mind. He hobbled beside him, and it took a few moments for him to focus on the huge building in front of him. The white fa√ßade, huge columns, and rows of windows left no doubt as to where they were headed.
"I don't want to grumble, Mycroft. After all, you're an adult guy and you're responsible for your health..."
John was perfectly aware of the reason why she was sad. She wanted to spend the day with Sherlock and she probably hoped that he would not accept their offer. However, he did not intend to give his friend the satisfaction of insulting him. He also didn't want to talk about things he thought they had already explained. Besides, he wanted to know the reason for his strange behavior. He knew Sherlock would want to avoid being exposed at all costs, but that only encouraged John even more. He left Molly and Sherlock. They chatted at the table like old friends. John passed the elegant tables in the restaurant, climbed the stairs to the first floor, and went straight to his apartment. He was glad he didn't meet any friends along the way, although he knew Francesca and her husband and Stoner also had their rooms nearby. He prepared the key to the door, but when he put it on the lock and put his hand on the door handle, he realized the apartment was open.
"You're doing it again" John bit his lower lip visibly irritably for a second, never taking his eyes off him. "You are hiding behind a mask of coldness, although you know very well that I don't believe in it anymore. Or at least I don't believe that you really are like that towards the people you care about." John felt a storm of emotion building up inside him. He couldn't hold them any longer. He also knew that Mycroft had to hear a few words of truth to clear the atmosphere. "In my whole life, I haven't met a person who has mastered the art of pretending as perfectly as you. You play a pompous, snobbish asshole who has to treat others with kindness just because common interests require it. You are arrogant and whenever you can, you show your superiority and power". John felt his face turning red and his heart beating like mad. He had a hard time meeting Mycroft's eyes.
Lestrade's back blocked his view. He leaned out to look at what caused the sudden silence, and he immediately felt the cold sweat trickling down his body. He looked at something that must have been a living human before. This was not what he expected. He was aware that he was supposed to help at the crime scene, but he had no idea that the crime was a real slaughter, not a common murder.
He lowered his eyes. He didn't know what to say or how to react. Lucy was the first to put it so directly. He had long since lost hope that someday something more would connect him with Sherlock. In fact, he knew from the very beginning that the matter was hopeless. He didn't want to raise hope again. When Lucy broached the subject, she unwittingly scratched the old wounds and hurt him, though he knew that it was not her intention.
"I will accompany you then!" Stoner exclaimed with strange excitement and contentment. John was about to get the idea out of his mind, but Aaron took the documents from his hands and almost forcibly led him to the empty gondola that had just reached the shore.
"It was your idea, so why don't you even try to get into the role?" John asked. He felt anger rising again, but Mycroft looked confused.
"Relax, Myc. We won't be sitting here for hours." Aaron teased him. He knew Holmes hated it when someone called him that.
John watched him with a smirk. "Don't tell me that you have one for Sherlock too..." he stopped as Mycroft held out his hand with a different packet of condoms to giving it to his brother. He didn't know what to say, but he wanted to laugh aloud at Sherlock's genuinely disgusted expression. Interestingly, after a while, the younger genius accepted the gift without a word and looked at it closely.
"I don't know," he shook his head. "And that's what this is about, right?" he asked, looking at Mycroft for a second. "That's how they describe it in these funny guides and books for single women seeking love. That people in this situation don't know what they are doing. That they lose their mind completely. They are lost in thoughts, irritated by their weaknesses and shortcomings, although they have not experienced this before. At least not to the extent. " At that moment, the wine he was sipping seemed oddly sour. Instead of putting down his glass, he reached for the bottle and poured himself some alcohol. "Interesting feeling" he added when he returned to the previous position. "I wish we had tried it earlier."
He wanted to shake his head because Mycroft was showing once again that he knew how to act like a sophisticated gentleman. He towered over him in a rather elegant and appealing posture and did not allow himself to show his true emotions.
"Oh exactly!" he shouted with unfeigned joy. The joy was accompanied by the relaxation of the muscles, which made the man almost lose his balance. Somehow he managed to stay on his feet. John knew it was due to the years of practice and exercise the man put through his body every day. "... longanimous face. So I thought I could allow myself to ask you ..."
"John ... promise me we'll have a farewell dinner tomorrow. I won't let you and Mycroft leaves without saying goodbye," she said, grabbing his forearm with both hands and staring at him with almost imploring eyes. How would John refuse her? He didn't even want to. He gave her a warm smile, but when he was about to steal her kiss again, he saw a couple entering the room out of the corner of his eye. He looked up and felt like sighing at the sight of Sherlock and Molly, who was holding on to his hand.
He glanced desperately around the room until he saw a proud and tall figure standing next to ... oh god ... Mycroft! Yes, Stoner talked to him. And what was worse, the dark smile on his face did not go away. What was he up to? Aaron pulled a phone out of his pocket and leaned over Mycroft with a triumphant smile, showing him something on the screen. John saw the older man stiffen and then his face whitened as Stoner whispered something in his ear. After a while, both men left the room using the side door. John sensed the problems were just beginning and the end of the trip would be very stressful.
"See you, Dr. Watson!" Two nurses shouted at once just before leaving the hospital. It was the end of a very difficult day for John. He didn't even have the strength to answer, so he smiled gently, raised his hand and nodded. He wanted to go home and get some rest. He stepped out onto the pavement. Fresh or rather cool London's air surrounded his tired face. However, his peace of mind did not last long. Before the main door slammed, a black, elegant car appeared around the corner. John sighed and lowered his head. For two days, he saw this car almost everywhere. Mycroft tried to contact him and although he had managed to avoid confrontation to this moment, he knew that sooner or later he would have to talk to him.
"Places of murders, John!" he didn't even try to hide his excitement. "In the seventeenth century, there were two serial killers who had more creativity than today's degenerates who have access to so many technologies! Can you imagine it? Two serial killers in such a small city? And they acted only a dozen or so years apart." Sherlock started walking around the room. He ignored or missed the glances the other three were giving him. Molly wasn't delighted, rather worried. Mycroft rolled his eyes, only John felt a shiver at the thought of a small walk to the crime scene. "We have to see this," he added excitedly.
This time he was the one who was silent and tried to understand the detective's words. He sat motionlessly and narrowed his eyes. His eyes travelled swiftly between the horses' rumps and his shoes. "And yet I am your companion right now," he said, looking at Holmes. He was silent for a moment as if searching for the answer in the detective's eyes.
"Yes, I know. Francesca showed me this part of the city. We were here ..." John paused for a moment and looked at the waitress who placed two glasses of water in front of them.
John sighed loudly in resignation. What else could he expect from his genius friend? He knew perfectly well, their approach to the surrounding world was radically different. Of course, that didn't mean Sherlock didn't see the beauty and underestimate it ... he just did it in his own way, and he didn't get loud about it.
"What is this horrible murder you are talking about, boy?" he asked, handing the young man three pence.
"You would feel uncomfortable if he looked at you with that inquiring look," Mycroft finished, closely observing his reactions.
"I walk closer to her. I try to gain her trust. I seduce her and offer money. The woman agrees. She leads me to this place. We try to be quiet because potential witnesses are sleeping right above us. We go down the stairs. I feel the excitement growing inside me. I know with what intention I came here. We stand close to the fence and look at each other. We need the right mood, so maybe the woman starts to stimulate me, maybe our lips connect for a while ... ".
The area was slowly starting to turn grassy. First, the colors were faded and dry, then more lush and becoming the color of juicy green. They were coming down the slopes, which, although still steep, were less rocky. This was a relief to Arian. John noticed that he was walking with clenched teeth and he was trying to keep up with the rest of the group. He was limping, sweat streaming down his face. Silence did not improve the mood. The sun was starting to burn unpleasantly in the face and even the strong wind did not give relief. Therefore, as they approached the first line of trees, John took a deep breath and once again allowed himself to cast a long look at his friend. Sherlock was behaving strangely. He was silent almost from the very beginning of the day. He rarely looked at him. He looked depressed or angry. John was concerned. Something was wrong. He counted on Sherlock being one of the few people to oppose Sebastian. That he would show his advantage over him. Maybe not physical but mental for sure. He wanted his friend to be the group commander, but Mycroft got it out of his head. He stated that they should stay in the shadows and not show all their skills. John, however, knew Sherlock and knew that he would sooner eat his own phone than pretend to be humble and that he would accept what others would offer him. That's why this strange passivity surprised him and disturbed him a little. The deeper they went into the forest, the more irritated he felt. He was tired, hungry, and angry about the whole situation. He was angry at Sherlock's absence, at the wounds that Arian had to face, and at Sebastian's intransigence. He was irritated by his unwillingness to accept Lucy's suggestions. She urged him to stop several times or to take a short break in the march. They have already walked over a mile in the shadow of the spreading trees and the sounds of the living forest.
Hello everybody! I am extremely grateful for your support. You really are amazing. That is why I am asking you for help. I plan to write my first story but I need a lot of time to plan many things. I always wanted to do it, but I didn't have enough courage and time to do it. Taking this opportunity - because I am sick and I have more free time - I would like to start planning a new story (of course I will still be translating the Bloody Ring). Therefore, I would be grateful if you answered a few questions:
Therefore, I would ask you for help. This is a very short survey that will help me write a story you would like to read. If this will not make you too much trouble, look there. It will take you less than 15 seconds. Thank you for your help!
John turned to her. "Needed? Is his blood pressure too low?" he asked, looking at his friend with slight concern.
Aaron gave him a captivating smile. He joined him, came closer at a very uncomfortable distance, which forced Sherlock to quickly get up from the sofa. John was unmoved, frowning even more. He could feel the presence of a friend behind his back. Aaron blinked slowly. He focused his eyes on John's mouth, then licked his lower lip with a barely noticeable movement. "I love when my potential partner is so inaccessible."
Aaron looked at him ironically. "Myc, if pride could turn into a human figure, yours would embarrass the Statue of Liberty."
His cheeks were red, his eyes were grinning, and he was breathing heavily. Mycroft saw John had fun. Genius looked at his eyes.
Maybe Mycroft was the smartest man John knew, but he was Sherlock's brother. John managed to learn to recognize all possible reactions and emotions of both brothers. Contrary to appearances, they were very similar. That's why he knew it wasn't all truth. He knew that elder Holmes was hiding something from him. That's why this time he leaned over the table and fixed his blue eyes on the older man.
John heard a note of irritation and annoyance in his friend's voice, so he wasn't going to continue this conversation. Sherlock clearly didn't want to talk about his brother. John might be surprised, but he knew Sherlock and Mycroft's relationship was tense. They were different. Their behavior and way of life too. Sherlock sometimes let his emotions guide his actions. But Mycroft completely separated himself from feelings. Maybe this was the reason for their silent rivalry? Maybe Mycroft envied his brother because he could communicate with other people and let his emotions act. Maybe Sherlock wanted to treat everything like his brother, and keep his mind cool and free from feelings? John didn't know what their rivalry was, but he suspected that despite everything they both wanted the attention and warmth of the other person.
"Please, don't worry about that. I'll pay." Mycroft did not look up from the card, so he could not see the look his smiling brother gave him.
This time Mycroft gave him a slightly amused look. "But?" he asked, imitating his question from a few minutes ago.
"Stop this show and enlighten us why you honored us with your visit," Mycroft disrupted his thoughts.
Mycroft cut him off in mid-sentence with a soft purr of amusement. "You have always been confident. The question is whether you mistake it for audacity. To say that you know me enough to admonish me is a very bold thing to do."
"I've learned to be prepared for anything when I am with you." He had already taken off his jacket and vest.
"Ready for what?" Mycroft asked after a moment of silence. He watched John, who unceremoniously stood right in front of him and frowned.
"If you wanted to talk in private, you could have planned it better," John said with amusement. When he looked at Mycroft, he saw that he was watching him intensely and seriously, although a small smile played on his lips. He didn't feel very comfortable when the older brother looked at him that way. He felt almost eaten alive. He crossed his arms and nodded towards the flat. "Molly asked Mrs. Hudson to help her bake some cake. She has a date with Greg," he explained, though he did not doubt that Mycroft had deduced it faster than it took him to see the black car outside their flat.
Mycroft smiled honestly for the first time that day. It was not a wide smile, but quite pleasing to the eye. "They'll wait. They won't start it without me anyway." He tried to ignore the closeness of John, who was sitting right in front of him, staring at him with those blue eyes of his. Mycroft was still holding the folder. He handed it to the doctor, watching his reaction. He would have a better view if he backed away, even half a step, but he didn't. He stood still, staring at John's slightly surprised expression. "Those documents confirming the fact of government support for your hospital. From today every uninsured patient will be able to use the help of medical staff. Of course to a certain extent."
When they entered the room, the last thing he was about to do was admiring the living room. He only noticed orange rays of sunlight coming into the room through the window. The receptionist left them alone, wishing them a nice rest. When the woman enjoyed the elegant decor, he threw everything he did not need on the floor and left, leaving her surprised and alone in the room.
John wasn't sleeping that night. He couldn't find a comfortable position. Something disturbed him falling asleep. Maybe it was because of sultry weather? They were in Venice, in a hotel surrounded by water, and yet the heat was unbelievably unpleasant that night. There was also a second - more likely - reason for his insomnia ...
"And by the way," the landlady said, "you could offer him a trip to a similar place from time to time. You should take care of him, not expose him to danger. Running on dark streets doesn't seem like a good idea to spend time together, not to mention the dangers on every corner, "she said, tilting her head slightly. "In my opinion, you should sometimes take an example from your brother and provide John and yourself ..."
"Sherlock, don't laugh ..." John said, seeing a smile on his friend's lips. Sherlock looked at him with childlike innocence.
"When you offered John this ridiculous deal, I was afraid you would have too much negative influence on him," he said, drawing the attention of his brother who had deliberately avoided his eyes. "But as I see, I was worried unnecessarily, because it's completely the opposite." He set the glass to his lips, which were widened in a smile. "Congratulations, John," he said with sincere amusement and a nod. "I have not seen Mycroft in such an informal appearance for a long time." He looked at him closely. "Such relaxed" he added after a moment of reflection.
"You're about to burn a hole in the door with your stare, John. No wonder your husband walks so proud if he has such support in you."
"Your people irritate me, Lestrade. They ask the wrong questions or unknowingly directs witnesses to wrong answers. They are of no use. Besides, I am not going to wait for them to choose who will have the misfortune to accompany me." Holmes continued, looking for something outstanding and examining it with narrowed eyes. "The time is of the essence in these types of cases. The sooner witnesses are interviewed, the better. Their memories fade with every hour. Or they start adding things that did not happen just to make their testimonies more interesting ...". Only now the man's bright eyes fell on the two of them.
Mycroft's eyes wandered as if he did not understand or did not want to understand John's words and his complaints.
Of course, he felt offended! Offended and hurt by Mycroft's words. They weren't ordinary friends anymore, but Mycroft kept an unnatural distance all the time, despite the fact that they slept with each other more than once. Maybe it wasn't a big deal to him. Maybe Mycroft did these things more often. But it wasn't so easy for John. He couldn't forget the fact, he had sex with someone like Mycroft. How could he look at his reflection in mirror and say he had nothing to do with this cold, grumpy, proud man? How could he say that Mycroft's touch did not impress him? He knew his fingers. Fingers who signed the most important documents. He knew his lips. These lips sipped tea from porcelain cups, feasting with the queen and her advisers. When he crossed that fragile line - going to bed with him - he knew there would be no turning back anymore. At least, that's how it looked from his point of view. Because for Mycroft it was apparently one of the numerous and short adventures. Who knows, maybe he did it just to make him more drawn into this whole pretending? John felt a strange hole in his stomach and couldn't tell if he was more angry or depressed.
The genius gave him a surprised look and straightened up, closing the ever-broken wardrobe, which irritated him from the beginning. He grimaced at the creak and propped the door with his suitcase.
John was never able to write so fast as Sherlock, so he waited for his friend to write everything he wanted to tell him. The messages came one after another. John put the phone on his stomach and covered eyes with his shoulder. The vibrations kept him awake, so he was conscious all the time.
"I'm not angry," John said when he saw and felt all these things. The bedroom was dark, but not completely dark. The faint light coming through the open window made it possible to see the contours and even some colors on the carpet or furniture. John knew Mycroft was close. Really close. If he wanted, he could grab him by the tie and pull him closer. He did not do it. "Actually, I wanted to apologize to you," he added.
John ignored his comment when Sherlock - probably unknowingly - compared him to a thing or his property because he knew he was filled with rage and disappointment at the moment. He just clenched his teeth harder and rubbed his eyes.
John's thoughts were interrupted by Mycroft's cell phone, which started to ring and vibrate on the desk next to the closed laptop. John frowned and walked quickly to the table because the sound seemed terribly loud in this quiet and still dark room. He never intended to investigate what his fake husband was doing, but he picked up the phone and rejected the call.
"You know, Mycroft. It's not like I'm averse to men. If it's necessary, you can do it," he said with a smile. Another grunt confirmed his conviction that Mycroft was not used to this type of behavior. The older man pulled out a small textbook and handed it to the doctor.
John looked down slightly embarrassed. He shifted in his chair and murmured, "I thought it was styrofoam." To his surprise, he heard Francesca's giggling and Mycroft's almost imperceptible chuckle. Franco Coletti was already busy eating, so he did not join the general amusement at the table. John narrowed his eyes. He looked at his husband's face and once again regretted that perhaps it was one of the last times he saw his real face. He preferred when Mycroft threw off the mask and showed his true face to others, even if it literally lasted a moment. John wanted to remember this moment and take it home with him.
John couldn't answer because Mycroft left the room. He was alone in a large apartment with a view of glorious Venice. He still didn't understand what irritated Mycroft so much but decided not to think about it any longer.
Aaron sighed softly. He took the phone and unlocked it without hurry. "I am sorry, John. I wanted to spare you this, but I see Mycroft likes to make you ..." his voice got stuck in his throat. He blinked several times and quickly moved his thumb across the phone screen. Suddenly everything started to disappear. Data, files, phone numbers and messages. Each folder he opened immediately became empty. There was not a single photo. He had no idea what had happened when he suddenly realized how easily he was fooled by Mycroft. He lowered his hand in resignation, tilted his head back, sighed and covered his eyes with his free hand. "Dear god. How could I be so easily fooled?" he muttered, feeling completely defeated. He couldn't look at Mycroft's triumphant face. "It's your assistant doing, am I right?" he asked.
John pursed his lips. He only dreamed of crawling under light and thin blanket and separating himself from the entire surrounding world, especially from the grumpy Mycroft and the crazy Sherlock.
Holmes was sitting at the table with his head lowered over some papers. He was holding a magnifying glass in one hand and was writing something on a pile of carelessly piled documents with the other one. The room was messy, full of dusty books, a gilded microscope, and scraps of frayed material.
The sight of John's expression made Greg clear his throat again and rub his neck nervously. It wasn't easy for him. He felt uncomfortable and overwhelmed that he had to make his friend aware of such things. "As long as I've known Sherlock, he always seemed ... different to me. I didn't care if he had anyone or if he was even interested in ..." at this point he made a strange hand gesture as if it was supposed to replace that, what he couldn't say out loud, "... you know what I mean. When Molly told me ..." he fell silent again, "... about all of this, it's a shame to admit it, but I was shocked. But I immediately realized that it makes sense. Since you two met, you've become his number one. He always followed you and sought your attention. Although he indeed did it in his own strange way. I understood that was how he showed you... "Christ, it was hard for him," that he loves you, "he said slowly and stiffly, not believing he was doing it. "And I stopped wondering. The more I think about it, the more I am angry that I didn't realize earlier," he paused, but not for long. "As for his brother ... I can't say anything. I don't know him. I've only had contact with him a few times in my life and ..." he shuddered at the mere mention of their meeting, "I don't know what's going on between you, but I can only imagine. No, actually not. I'd rather not do that, it's none of my business, "he said, though he was consumed by curiosity. He would not admit to having listened to Molly's story about John and the Holmes brothers fighting for his favor.
"Oh, so you follow me just to get evidence of our deception? I can't believe this is your way of having fun. But as you said, it will be difficult for you to find something on us. You can't convince the others to your suspicions.
John knew the hidden meaning was 'It's your fault, John. We'll talk about it later. ' He watched the older man leave the bathroom. He wanted to ask about breakfast, but he gave it up. This question didn't make sense anyway, because he knew Mycroft wasn't going to stay in the apartment any longer. It wasn't even five minutes later he heard the main door close.
"How about dinner, John? I wanted to take you to a place where we could talk and eat quietly, but I see we can't do it without Mycroft's people. It seems he's really worried about you. I didn't think he would decide to hire so many people to follow us ... " Aaron nodded at the crowd with a smile. John frowned because he didn't see anything suspicious, but he took a sigh of relief knowing he wasn't with Stoner alone. He thanked his husband silently.
John gave Mycroft an amused look. He kissed him softly goodbye and went towards the crime scene to help his best friend solve the case of the mysterious man. Mycroft watched the small figure disappear somewhere in the crowd. He always wanted his brother to meet someone like John. A person he could count on anytime and anywhere. A person who supported him and endured his moods and unusual character. He wanted Sherlock to be happy and get to know the taste of a normal life. John Watson was the perfect partner for him, although he was not aware of his own uniqueness. If a few years earlier someone had told Mycroft that an ordinary military doctor would win over the hearts of the Holmes brothers, he would have laughed at them. But now he understood that uniqueness does not necessarily mean loneliness and contempt for everything that is ordinary, boring and normal for most people. The uniqueness in the company of the right person could give an unexpected effect. And he was just witnessing this extraordinary combination.
Francesca watched two men who unconsciously looked deeply into each other's eyes with smiles on their faces. She was going to sit longer and stroke the glowing spark between them, if not Franco. Mr. Coletti probably had enough of this sentimental scene, because he put a chilled bottle of wine in the middle of the table and rubbed his hands, letting them know that they should do something more pleasant than discussing feelings. They talked long and vigorously, but neither Mycroft nor John looked so absorbed in new topics. Francesca could see them glancing at each other and exchanging comments using more emotional voices. She liked what she saw. She was not happy when she had to get ready to leave. She reluctantly released John from her arms, and he did not seem happy having to say goodbye to her at the door too. Even Mycroft stood patiently as she kissed his cheeks. She handed them a small gift, wrapped in a red box and decorated with a golden ribbon, as a farewell gift. She regretted that her stay did not last longer. She wanted to stay with John and Mycroft for a few more days, but she understood they had other responsibilities. She hoped it wasn't the last time she could enjoy John's company. She told Mycroft about it of course.
"Every time you play the violin, your fingers hypnotize me. They are so delicate when they touch the things that are important to you. I love the way you turn your coat collar up and the way you look at me I love your unsurpassed mind, your nonchalance, and your loving way how you treat Mrs. Hudson, even if you are purposely mean to her". He turned the body completely towards the geniuses. "I love you for all of this."
He stopped and turned to Mycroft. The older man walked proudly and set his foot on the first step of stairs. John was too shocked. He didn't even notice when his pretended husband very gently grabbed his chin and joined their lips without warning.
"Forgive me for not being able to finish it right. That I'm putting you in danger again." He seemed to lose all his strength and courage because he made a move as if he wanted to lower his head and look at the ground. He didn't do it just because John's eyes didn't let him. "This time I know I need you. I don't want to make the same mistake. I know that I can't make it without your help."
The window finally cracked and the three of them slipped in quietly. John didn't even have time to look around, because Sherlock lit a small lamp by the bed and started to search the drawers.
"Professionally, John. My brother keeps a distance to everything. He doesn't build close relationships. He works with people just because his job requires it.
Mrs. Hudson opened the door and looked into the living room. "... He ordered me to hand it to one of you."
He agreed with Holmes. The first thing that caught his eye was a small yard, from which there was no other way out than to go through the same door they had entered. The murderer had to consider the fact that someone might notice him at any moment. "So the killer has to be very confident ..." he said, which caught the attention of the detective, "... determined, but most of all ... crazy."
"I don't even want to think about the food at such a temperature ..." he said casually and ... Oh, there we go! There's Sherlock's reaction. He looked up from the phone only to see if he had heard it correctly. John wanted to kick his calf under the table. Yes, he knew that look. Sherlock was surprised every time his friend refused to eat as if he were addicted to it. John crossed his arms over his chest.
According to the mantel clock, it was six forty-five in the morning when he heard a strange movement coming from the street. He got up from his chair, and as he walked to the window, he looked outside. He noticed that the people he saw were in a hurry. Their movements were quick and many of them were entering the street, which caused problems for the hansom cabs. There was a really strange and disturbing atmosphere in the air.
"I recommend the village ..." he said decisively as if he was genuinely interested in the holidays of both landladies, "... or the other continent" the last part of the sentence he mumbled quietly to a cup held to his mouth. "For a few weeks ... it would be fabulous."
Sherlock kept his eyes on him, he did it only when the calm in the room turned into a rather uncomfortable silence. He looked away and nodded at a single object lying on the table next to the bed. "It's a good choice," he said with confidence.
"No. He's right," she interrupted. "It's time to stop walking around with my head in the clouds and stop chasing after men who see me as a means to a goal and who don't care about me." She looked shyly at Sherlock. Her eyesight was significant for her because she probably finally realized that there was no point in lying to herself and living her dreams. She looked away before any of the other two men had a chance to notice anything. John and Sherlock stared at each other in silence. "But where will I find such a man?"
The third day brought a visible change in John's behavior. He was smiling, talkative from the early morning. The bags were still standing unpacked, but John returned to his old habits and sometimes made ironic comments in the discussion, which Sherlock enjoyed very much. He even managed to write a short update on his blog. He wrote quickly with a smile. After an hour, he deleted the text, but he still had a good mood. So good that Sherlock seriously considered changing into an elegant outfit and starting a serious conversation with him. He gave up this idea almost immediately. He didn't want to remind his brother. Mycroft was a perfectionist and pedant. He didn't want John to see him as a reflection of the elegant but stiff Mycroft. He wanted normality and wanted to take his friend's thoughts away from recent events. To remind him that the normality he needed so much, a sense of intimacy and acceptance was right in front of him. Not among the high-ranking personalities of this world before whom he had to pretend to be someone he was not. He wanted to show him his place was here. At Baker Street. In a dusty apartment, away from prying eyes and artificiality. Sherlock wanted normality at his side to be what John needed most. Because of this, he spent most of the day wearing pajamas, smiling when John gave him an amused look. Despite the perfect atmosphere, he did not decide to bring the topic that had been bothering him for so many days. Because what would he tell him? What to ask about? How to start a conversation? Should he grab his hands, look deep into his eyes, and kiss him? Would he press him against the wall and say "I love you"? The feelings he had for his friend were obvious to him. He wanted them to be obvious to John too. But he couldn't do it. Those two simple words... He couldn't imagine saying it with his own mouth. Not because he was disgusted by it. He was afraid of what would happen a few moments after he said it. He had never opened up to anyone like that before. He knew that if such a moment came, he would feel exposed, helpless. There would be no way out or the possibility of retreat. But he still wanted to shout these two words in John's face. He wanted to whisper these words in his mouth and then taste him. He set out to Venice with the intention of getting John back and making him fall in love with him for good, but now that he has everything in front of him, he realizes that he didn't have anything under his control. Neither the deeds of his friend nor his own feelings and behavior. That's why he was waiting for John, for his action. He was waiting for him to give him a sign that he wanted it. He thought about what he should do and when to act for so long that the day was over, as was the perfect opportunity to get what he had longed for.
Mycroft shifted in his chair. "People tend to worry if their property is not properly marked. They are afraid of losing it, so they try to prevent it."
"Then, let's not delay it" Mycroft interrupted them. He passed Molly and walked to the door. "Unless you consider visiting the city at night more romantic."
"These vices aren't always... bad. It depends on how you look at them.," he said in surprise, staring at the detective's profile, whose head swayed with every movement of the cab. "But why are you telling me this all?"
"John ..." Mycroft's soft yet significant voice made John give up. He knew there was no point in pretending everything was fine.
"To Venice. We'll have almost half the city to ourselves, although ordinary tourists will not suspect anything."
He put down the newspaper and walked over to the window, putting his cold hand to his cheek warmed by the fire. The night was cloudless, windless. The streets were flooded with a white, thickening wall of fog. Good. He knew it would make it easier for him to travel unnoticed by others. It would have been completely dark outside, had it not been for the gas lanterns lined up along the street at Queen Victoria's orders. This was to guarantee the safety of residents and improve the mood in the city. She was also terrified by the recent murders, so she agreed to the requests of her subjects. The new idea didn't help much, but at least she had a clear conscience.
"Yes, you are a coward. At least compared to Mycroft. Do you know why I think so? Because unlike my husband, you are afraid to face your feelings. You are afraid it will take control over you and you will start to care. Mycroft allowed it, he connected his intelligence with emotions. He allowed himself to love me. I know a little bit about the minds of geniuses ... I'm not saying that I know their thoughts, but I know how they work. Believe me, this kind of mixture is incredibly exciting and dangerous. Connecting love and cold approaches to other things. Being with me, Mycroft got to know things he didn't know existed. Every day is like an exciting fight for him, but I doubt he regrets it. Mycroft took this risk and fell in love ... You would not be able to do it because you are too afraid of feelings and love ...
John tried to control his amusement, covering his mouth with his hand. He giggled and after a long break looked at annoyed Mycroft.
"It's twelve past two. Three hours of sleep are not enough for you, John. You are no longer a teenager, your body will demand more attention and care," Sherlock said, focusing on other websites.
As he left the bathroom and approached the living room, he noticed the impatience on Sherlock's face as he sat in his armchair tapping his foot on the ground. Mycroft was standing by the fireplace, poking with the tip of his umbrella against the protruding pieces of wood, keeping his other hand tucked deep into a pocket of elegant trousers. They heard him and looked at him. John suddenly felt an overwhelming responsibility. He was concerned about how they would react and how much the minutes ahead would decide the rest of his life. He looked at their faces, but Mycroft's strange expression forced him to focus on him longer. Mycroft was pale. Paler than John remembered it before going to the bathroom. He was standing stiffly with his back very straight. His hand was clasped on the umbrella handle. To the untrained eye, this would appear to be his usual attitude. However, John knew what caused this behavior. Fear. One glance was enough for Mycroft to guess what he was going to hear and what the consequences would be.
The three of them moved deeper into the hotel. John had never been in this part before. After making sure that the first two floors did not have the apartment they were looking for, they climbed the top floor. The apartments were separated by a wide corridor. They saw breathtaking sculptures, giant flower pots, and a long red carpet. At the end of the corridor in the back of the building was another elegant restaurant, or maybe it was like a restroom, John wasn't sure. He saw several men and two women talking at a small table. He stared at Sherlock, who looked back at him. Stoner's room was at the very end of the corridor, right next to the restaurant. They had no chance to get inside unnoticed.
The older man still looked a bit confused and now even ashamed of John's words, though he tried very hard not to show it. Finally, he raised a hand. The gold object on his finger immediately caught the eye. "That's why, John. Everyone thinks I've been involved with someone for many years. They have been pushing me for a long time to finally introduce my beloved one to them. And I, through my ill-considered action, did not explain this mistake to them. I have no choice now. Do you think anyone would trust me if it turned out that they had been cheated all these years by such an influential person? Our relations with neighboring nations could change a lot, not only in political terms ..."
"You can go back to your work now, Mycroft," he said and approached him with a gesture inviting him into the hallway. "I will inform you later about John's decision. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone with him." He stood beside Mycroft but dared not push his brother, who stood firmly in his place. "Your presence will not be necessary," he said in a slightly more irritated tone.
"John, I will repeat it as many times as necessary. I did it for your safety. Not to control you" Mycroft's calm tone irritated John even more. Of course, genius thought it was nothing and he was not at fault. "Please, don't sulk, just sit down and listen. You're an adult man, don't act like a small child. We'll reach the destination in a moment, and ..."
Holmes' smile assured him that he had a strong bond with his landlady. He enjoyed watching their conversation and sincerely hoped that soon he would also have a chance to strengthen the relationship with the two of them. Once they were alone, he looked around the living room. He could feel the detective's eyes staring at him. However, it ceased to bother him a long time ago. He enjoyed his attention, controlling the reactions of his body better and better. He was looking around until his attention was caught by the piles of paper lying on the table in the other room. He walked over, examining the strange black spots and notes.
Holmes was standing in a completely different place now. "Who cares about the murder of prostitutes in this town? The newspapers report about a crime every day. I wrote letters to Scotland Yard, but I didn't get any answer. I followed the murderer's next steps, but it's the police who must catch him, not me. I waited for them to ask for my help".
"Friends are a great thing, right? You know something about it because you and Sherlock seem very attached to each other. His possessiveness and protection towards you ... I had several friends too. Male and female. We were close, so we were interested in our work. One of my friends was a dermatologist. She liked to talk and teach others. I had to listen to these boring lessons, but now I see it was worth it. I think I should thank her ... "Stoner fell silent, watching John's reaction. After a moment he leaned toward him even more and lowered his voice.
"I am not asking you for permission to contact him. At the moment our relationship is overwhelmed with emotion anyway. John will not change his mind until we both come to some agreement. Can you imagine losing touch with him, or that he will disappear from your sight?" this question was followed by a long pause. "By your expression, I conclude that you are aware of the accuracy of my words. If we want to keep him with us, I am afraid we have no other option. That's why I am asking. If there was any chance, would you be able to consider letting me into your life? ".
He frowned. The strange warning left him speechless for a moment. He followed the detective who opened the gate, walked into the street, and approached the hansom cab.
Mycroft, who was now sitting with his elbows on his knees, looked at his reflection in the water flowing under their feet. "And I hope mine never finds out." He didn't even have time to raise his head when something flashed to his right. He looked sideways and saw Sherlock taking a photo of him with a smirk.
Lestrade's face twisted in sympathy, but he hid it as he turned his head. He remembered that his friend hated when someone showed him compassion in any form. Suddenly he twitched in his seat and quickly turned his head to look at him. "Doctor ... You're a doctor! You're not afraid of dead bodies."
Mycroft looked at him but did not stop tying the tie. His clenched teeth and pale face did not herald anything good. When John started to approach the very comfortable couch, intending to lie down, Mycroft turned to him completely. The rising sun shining through the window lighted his proud figure. He relaxed his facial muscles. John slowed his movements and slowly sat down on the couch, looking at the older man.
"I had never see Mycroft so calm and content. Your company is good for him, John." She embarrassed her new friend without hesitation. She knew that Mycroft was also not deaf to her flattery. It was noticeable because he squirmed slightly in the chair and avoided her eyes. "He like your company very much, and you him too?" she did not even try to be gentle in the pursuit of confessions, although she did not lose any of her elegance and care. "What do you likes about him, John?" She put her elbows on the table, put her fingers together and put her chin on them.
"I know. But ..." John, after releasing all the accumulated anger, sank limply into the seat, lowering his head "... but this time something is wrong. I feel it. Mycroft, I don't know what happened between you two, but you must fix it "he looked pleadingly at the older man.
"He threatened you, but you did it your way and sniffed it". John started heading toward the camp but stopped to explain something to Moran. "You didn't understand that I didn't want to have anything to do with you?"
"I had to go back for a few documents, and there was no point in sending my assistant for it ..." Mycroft put a stack of paper in his briefcase and grabbed the glass with the leftover whiskey at the bottom. He emptied it quickly and turned sideways to John, taking the things he needed.
John expressed dissatisfaction with his words, by a loud sigh and theatrical rolling of his eyes. He was silent, but he took off his suit and vest and hung both things over the back of the couch. "Could the two of you don't do it today?" he asked. He poured some juice from a glass carafe and handed it to Molly.
John felt unbelievably sad. He was silent for a long time, staring at Mycroft. John knew that the older Holmes brother preferred loneliness. He knew he shied away from people because he considered them not worthy of his attention. But at the moment he felt sorry for him like never before. How many times has he sat locked up in four walls with a glass of whiskey in his hand and stared alone at the wall? How many trips ended in this way? Has he ever tried to break through this wall of egocentrism and aversion to others to spend time pleasantly in the company of someone other than his reflection in the mirror? At that moment, John's desire to be with two weirdos, - the Holmes brothers, - turned into a desire to help Mycroft taste a bit of normality.
He looked at John and blinked several times. His friend stared at his phone. "How did you come to that?".
John smiled back. "Maybe in this one case it would have to change between us, but I would like the rest to be the same."
"I have to go," he said and stroked her shoulders comfortingly. He headed for the back door. He tried not to attract attention, so he avoided the largest clusters of people, stayed away from the dance floor and tables filled with food and alcohol. Despite his efforts many people tried to catch him for a short conversation. He apologized to everyone and did not stop moving forward. Suddenly he felt a firm grip on his shoulder. He didn't even have time to turn around when he heard his friend's voice on his right ear.
Molly looked thoughtful. "Maybe it was the lover? Maybe she had to do it because she was forced?" She narrowed her eyes. Her thoughts tried to find the most likely answer. "Or it was her rival and she did not want to let her beloved fight for death and life for the love of another?"
Aaron sighed. "See, John," he said, shifted in his chair and stared at him. "Your ..." he hesitated deliberately to add some drama "... husband after a short conversation came to a consensus with me. He could choose between letting others mock him or you. I'm sorry to say, but from my presence here, I think you guess what option he chose. In exchange for his good name, he agreed to put you in my hands. At least for tonight. Of course, I'm not going to use violence ... but you understand what I want to say, "he said with concern.
"Don't treat me like I was an idiot - although you certainly think of me that way anyway - you won't be able to intimidate me with your contempt or power! You can be the head of government, you can rule your subordinates and force people to bring you sugar from the other end of the world, but I will definitely not be one of them. I am not surprised anymore, you are alone and the only person close to you is this poor assistant of your who must bear your changing moods! " John was about to leave the room, but he took a half step, then stopped and turned again. He was about to bite his tongue because he knew he shouldn't do it, the anger was so strong that he couldn't help it.
John saw Sherlock stand up and quickly gave the other man a look from head to toe. He knew one thing - his friend learned about Stoner more in a second than he did during his entire stay in Venice. He was confirmed he was right when Sherlock smiled with satisfaction.
"... and that's what you want, right? I know what you desire and I would love to help you achieve it ...". He caught her fingers in his gentle embrace and kissed the top of her hand, trying to look like someone humble begging her to comply with his request.
"I want to spend some time with Mycroft, he is my husband after all," he added, hopping carefully down the stairs. He hadn't doubt Molly would tell Sherlock about it, but at that moment he didn't care how his friend would react. He had no intention of playing his games, and the idea of accompanying Mycroft at the party was far more enjoyable than dealing with Sherlock's bizarre behavior. When he reached the hall, he saw Mycroft standing at the porter's lodge and talking to someone. He didn't notice John, who came up and stood next to him.
John nodded towards St. Mark's Square, to let him know, they will go there. He felt bad, knowing Mycroft watched them. He wanted to avoid deeper deductions, so he went with his friend to the square and sighed with relief when he was sure he was alone with Sherlock. Although the word 'alone' doesn't quite match the situation. It was three in the morning, but people were hanging around all the time. The couples and larger groups. It was rare to meet a lonely person. John felt strange even though he had walked the same streets with Sherlock a few hours earlier and saw the same things. He couldn't feel that intense gaze on him anymore, and his friend didn't stick to his back. They were calmer, more relaxed and finally had time for each other.
"Is that such a big difference?" John asked, slightly raising one eyebrow and a corner of his mouth.
"Dr Watson! Handsome as always," she walked over, placing a tiny hand on his forearm. "Your suitcases were brought this morning ... Oi, wait!" she shouted at the coachman, "Wait, I need this cab." She looked away to look at him with shining eyes. "I have had them taken to the top floor. Mr Holmes will show you the room that has been prepared. Forgive me, but I'm in a hurry for the sale." She patted his shoulder gently as she did the same to the coachman's cheek, who helped her into the cab.
Aaron's wet hand gripped John's more and more and pulled him into narrower streets. Sometimes his movements were so sudden, causing John to lose his balance. The man looked as if he was looking for an escape or was being followed. He looked back. John saw no anxiety on his face, but strange excitement and something like ... pleasure? At one point, John had had enough. He pulled his arm free and sighed loudly, crossing his arms.
John sighed, rubbing his sleepy eyes. "I really don't want to go home," he said honestly. "I didn't argue with Sherlock, none of these things. I just ..."
"You love him. For almost a decade you have struggled by his side, unable to tell him how you feel. Now that I offer you escape of the impasse, you invent obstacles to not agree with me."
But he did not see only cons in this situation. What's more, he liked this kind of wandering because it reminded him of the stress he was experiencing while patrolling Afghan villages. The biggest advantage of this was that he had his friend next to him.
His left hand was holding a cup of tea. In the other one, he was holding a phone. He was smiling while reading messages from Sherlock. Genius tormented him with text messages and John understood it was really difficult for him to function away from his friend. Some of the messages were ratty, but he had already got used to it.
"John ..." his voice was serious and slightly hoarse. It was hard for him to say any words. "I didn't tell you this before because I didn't want to upset you ... We both know what happened when we talked about it last time..."
John glanced at his lower lip for a split second, but he immediately controlled himself and gave him a sharper look. "If it's some bet or fun between you and Sherlock ...".
The hotel was so big that it was easy to get lost in. He was happy to accompany Mrs. Coletti and did not even realize that they had been circling the main hall for several minutes. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw a familiar figure. When he looked up, he saw Mycroft talking to a man. His husband didn't look pleased. He looked as if he wanted to disappear or free himself from the company of his interlocutor. His teeth were slightly clenched and his dead eyes fixed on a man who seemed to be enjoying his bad mood.
The meeting leader did not look impatient. He mastered his self-control perfectly. Besides, he had to be honest and answer questions. It was his task. "It took us many months to gather your group. Each of you is a specialist in some field. We chose you not only because of your achievements but also because of your characters. The mission you were chosen for will last one and a half months, so you must at least tolerate your company. All quarrels and mismatches are not advisable in this situation. We could send specially trained people, but the chances that their mission will be successful are smaller. This is not only about skills. The most important criterion is devotion to the cause, people, and the nation. In short your characters and attitude. "
The corners of Holmes's mouth curled upward, and his teeth flashed between his lips. He stepped back and, without taking his eyes off him, smoothed his black coat. "You should think more deeply, Watson, what comes out of your mouth when you speak." Taking his top hat off the ground, he dusted it off and carefully examined it before putting it on his head.
The first impression did not fool him. Sherlock Holmes turned out to be an incredibly self-confident man with an extraordinary gift of an almost infallible judgment of his surroundings. Within a few dozen minutes he had learned many things about himself, and he supposed that Holmes knew more about him, but for some reason, he chose to remain mysterious and not tell him about his observations. The detective's voice echoed in his ears, along with the rhythmic clicking of horses' hooves, completely muffling the sounds of his surroundings. He sat in the hansom cab and admired the detective's skills. He did not even mind the superiority and indifference with which Holmes spoke about others. He had to admit that this nonchalance was completely new to him. This behaviour made the detective different from the rest of the people. And this attracted him to the mysterious man. He frowned a few times when he heard something unflattering words, but Holmes immediately corrected himself, as if realizing that he had offended him, and he didn't want to do that. He smiled and waved his hand to show that he didn't feel hurt. He wanted to hear what Holmes thought about him and others.
The morning was not as hot as in the last few days and John was happy to hear that for the first time since arrival they will have breakfast on the hotel's observation deck. White clouds covered the sun from time to time, and the breeze rising from the water reached high above the hotel roof. John enjoyed the moment. He sat comfortably in a chair with closed eyes and was listening to the bustle under the hotel and the noise of passing ships. From time to time he could hear the sound of a cup tapping on a small plate.
The whole operation did not last even a minute. John had the impression that his run through the rocky gorge towards the lonely rock whose shape was sketched in the increasingly shining sky lasted much longer. He ran and ran. Cold air leaked through the mask on his face, causing pain in his lungs. His feet hooked on uneven terrain and protruding stones. The large rock probably belonging to one of the mountain walls that surrounded the gorge on three sides, was the only place where they could take refuge and gather in a group. When John finally reached his destination, he leaned his arm on the cold rock and bent in half, trying to control the blood that buzzed in his head and his breath. It was a difficult task. He felt like he was running a marathon. Ultimately, however, he forced his body to make another effort. He straightened up, took a few deep breaths, and turned his head to look at his friend. Sherlock was panting a little less, and his slightly wrinkled eyes were proof to John that his friend was having fun. He imagined his smile, but unfortunately, the mask covered it.
"I'll be done in a moment, John. I need a few more minutes to..." Mycroft could not finish his sentence. He watched as John placed his finger on the power button of the laptop with a firm and sophisticated movement. The room went dark once again. John could feel the other man's eyes on him, but he wasn't afraid. He had to admit playing with the Holmes brothers - especially the older one - was very stimulating.
John wasn't angry with Sherlock for ignoring him anymore. His irritation gave way to concern and a slight relief that he was not alone with this problem. He looked behind the young genius and it turned out that he was indeed under surveillance. He realized he had not met these people before at any of the meetings. He looked into the friend's eyes and lowered his voice, because at the moment the orchestra decided to play a more melodic and calmer music. "What we do?" he asked, trying to calm his raging heart.
"I have two news". He tensed the body again, guessing how John would react in a moment when he saw the kitchen mess.
John had to admit that both the unusual proposition and the extraordinary persistence of Mycroft made him curious. He wanted to learn more because he rarely got this kind of proposition. Not to mention from someone who could trigger a bomb attack with a single gesture or could change the world order - at least John thought so. He nodded. It was only now that he realized that all this time they were headed towards Baker Street. A few minutes later they stopped right away in front of Mrs. Hudson's apartment. "I thought you wanted to talk," John was surprised and grabbed the door handle. How could they do it peacefully when Sherlock was in the flat?
"Not for much longer," Holmes commented casually as if taking the fact entirely self-evident and not worth his attention. He shifted in the seat and slightly turned his body toward him. "Inspector respects you, Watson. Otherwise, he would not have taken you to the crime scene, especially since you are a doctor, not a pathologist. Your profession would not bring a dead person back to life. If I had not known Lestrade better, I might have thought he had let you enter the scene of the crime just because he is very fond of you" he added, staring at him.
Aaron walked over to them shakily but proudly. "Oh, Mycroft. You're so stiff. Loosen this tie, undo the last button and relax a little. I'm surprised you're so tense. If I had someone like John next to me ..."
Mycroft looked at him ominously. He looked like he could smell a bad smell in the air. Mycroft breathed a sigh of relief when he heard the soft slam of the closing door. He indeed wanted to be alone with John. He was convinced that he would have to have a short conversation, for which he had prepared since leaving the Savoia & Jolanda Hotel. The most difficult moment in such situations was the start of the discussion. Choosing the right words or even gestures. The task was not made easy for him by John, who did not look eager to take the initiative. What's more, he looked like someone who didn't feel like talking at all. Mycroft decided on a safer option and finally started the conversation. "Are you hungry?" he asked and caught John's attention. He looked into his dark blue eyes and continued, "I can order something."
Nice music changed its sound from time to time. Sometimes, something more lively and rhythmic occurred among the melancholic sounds. However, due to the late time, calmer melodies prevailed. With each passing moment, customers began to leave the restaurant. Tourists were returning to hotels, and the staff was finishing their last orders, which was only alcohol. The chef and his helpers finished work after one in the morning. Only the most determined customers remained on the dance floor and at the tables. When it was only about an hour until dawn, Mycroft, his brother, John, and Molly decided to leave the restaurant. Return to the hotel and a possible nap no longer made sense. According to the plan, they should sign out at six in the morning, and they had less than two hours. They decided to sleep on the plane on the way back to London. They wanted to spend their last moments walking around the city. The crowd disappeared from the streets. Only couples and wobbly gentlemen - who could not find their way back to the hotel - were hanging around the alleys. A barefoot woman slipped off the bridge, laughing and waving her shoes in her hands. They passed a man who gathered the chairs together, and young girls sleeping in a cool alley with dresses pulled up almost to the hips. They walked along the banks of the canal, breathing in the smell of water. Molly managed to get a portion of ice cream that John had bought for her from a tired and annoyed salesman. The sky was slowly changing color. From deep black to slightly less dark navy blue. The area was known for a beautiful view of the rising sun, so they stopped and sat on a low bridge. As usual, John took the place next to his friend. Molly couldn't imagine sitting next to an older genius, so she sat down next to Sherlock's shoulder. And Mycroft could not imagine sitting on a cold stone bridge. He informed the rest of the company about it, but gave up at their urging and sat reluctantly beside John.
"Colonel Moran," he affirmed, reassuring himself of his assumptions when he saw the man's face. "Haven't seen him in several years ... I thought they moved him to India."
Each step further into the room sent an unpleasant shiver down his spine. He knew what he was going to see in a moment. The image from the night before was still visible in front of his eyes. He walked over to the autopsy table and nodded toward the doctor, who was watching him searchingly through the furrowed brow. He stopped moving because there was something peculiar about him. It wasn't just the sharp, cool gaze of his brown eyes that caught his attention. The pathologist's short stature and a frail figure dressed in a multi-layered suit could not hide the fact that he was in fact... a woman. The impatience on her face and the nervous crossing of hands snapped him out of his silent consternation. He blinked and looked down.
"I understand," John said. He clenched his fingers nervously and slowly began to unbutton his vest. He hung it over the back of the couch. "Although it would be nice to spend this evening together without pretending," he continued, untying and getting rid of his tie. He looked at Mycroft. He wasn't surprised when he saw his intense gaze. He was slowly getting used to the slight shiver he felt every time he looked at him that way.
He thought it was the voice of Sherlock and Mycroft, but he heard only scraps of sentences and was unable to understand the point of the discussion.
The room was silent. Everybody without problems could hear Mrs. Hudson, who was bustling downstairs in her kitchen. John, just like Sherlock, was looking at Mycroft. Older genius, the head of government and - as it seemed to the doctor - friend of the queen - stood in the middle of the room, leaning on his umbrella. His clenched jaw indicated that he was regretting his own words. However, there was no turning back now.
"Sherlock ... I don't know ... he's acting weird today. And I don't mean 'weird' like in the last days. Now his 'weird' is that he changed his attitude completely. Yesterday everything was fine and today he behaves as if I were his colleague. Ha! Even better. As if he barely knew me. He ignores me and treats me as if I did not exist. He has behaved weird recently, but today he outdid himself".
Maybe if John hadn't known him before, he would have been more terrified to oppose him. Maybe then he would have bitten his tongue. Several years of service in one camp made him resistant to Sebastian's emphatic tone and he no longer felt the respect that the others surely felt. He straightened up, stopped, and took a deep breath. "We are taking a break in the march," he announced loudly. "Now".
"This is the main problem," the man said quietly and leaned toward Holmes. "... the situation overwhelmed him. He must have had a mental breakdown. His advisers are trying to get him out of the room and convince him to negotiate."
"Oh, I understand," Greg said, opening his eyes wide for a split second. "They are still ... like this", he looked at Mrs. Hudson and made an unclear and chaotic gesture with his hands.
They drove into the centre of Whitechapel. On one side, there was a large square. On the other, - buildings that look like brothels in the darkest part of the neighbourhood. Curtains fluttered between broken windows, and the smell reminded them of one thing - death. The carriage stopped in front of a gloomy brick building. The dark streaks on the walls were covered by drying brown moss. Even the horses seemed nervous. They snorted and stomped, hooves hitting on the pavement. The coachman barely stayed in the seat as soon as he lashed out with the reins. The horses lurched forward, almost instantly turning into a full gallop.
The detective's voice caught his attention. He realized that the man hadn't taken his eyes off him this whole time. It concerned him a little, and at the same time sent a strange feeling that turned his stomach. But how did he know he was ...
"I can also save your ass with it" Lucy grabbed the subject of discussion and ran her fingers along its length, enjoying the touch of hard wood and tight string. "But if you piss me off, I'll use it in a different way," she said with a warning and made a move as if she were pushing her precious bow into something.
"I didn't mean this kind of danger, John. Besides, my brother is under my strict control, and when my people can't cope with him anymore, I can rely on you."
And then everything became clear. John almost rolled his eyes. He walked toward Molly without a word. Her hunched figure melted into a large armchair and only a good eye could see her. Francesca accompanied him without a word. She watched with curiosity this modest girl, sitting and analyzing a book. Molly didn't turn her head until she sensed someone's presence behind her back.
He was relieved to find that John was not paying attention to him, and his eyes were covered with his shoulder like a few moments before. Mycroft went around the bed and slipped into his part of the mattress. He felt the atmosphere was still tense. He lay on his back, stared at the decorated ceiling, and listened to John's breath. He wanted to see if he was falling asleep, but there was no indication that John was sleeping.
John smirked at that. "But I hope you do not throw away memories. I came to make sure that you will not forget the recent events. I know that you did not act when we were together. At least for the most part. I wish our relations would not change and I would like you to still treat me like in the last two weeks. Especially when we're alone and you don't have to play the inaccessible gentleman. "
John shuddered as the genius slowly walked over to the bed, put his finger between his shirt and the tie knot, and removed it in one move.
"You think so?" Mrs. Hudson wondered. "Hm. Maybe you are right. You know, she mentioned several times that she would rather not go alone." She fell silent and thought. "You and John travel a lot. What place would you suggest to the two of us?" she asked, staring intently at him.
"You didn't like it so much?" He asked. "You know ... You didn't have to show it in such a theatrical way." He put down the guitar and crossed his arms. "Huh" he snorted in disbelief and a slight insult, "with such an attitude, you'll never understand real art."
The wind grew a bit stronger although it was barely noticeable until now. A firm breeze gently moved John's hair and cooled his red and burning cheeks. Seconds passed very slowly, he had the impression time stood still and in the most uncomfortable situation for them. His pulse quickened and he felt hot blood pulsing in his veins.
John left the flat. Standing on the sidewalk, he felt that if he turned and looked up, his gaze would meet the sad gaze of his friend who was standing behind the dirty living room window. He was used to this look though it was one of the last things he wanted to get used to. He would have preferred to see Sherlock smile as he waited for his return, and it was killing him that it was too late for such reactions.
"John... gentlemen are not trying to take the things they are fighting for by using force. Such behavior is not fitting for people in our positions," Mycroft enjoyed the taste of the cigarette but listened carefully to the discussion. "Not to mention that arm wrestling looks and is childish. Can you imagine any of us in such a situation?" he asked ironically.
A moment later they stood in front of the apartment of Francesca and Franco Coletti. Mycroft knocked lightly with his long fingers, which fascinated John in a strange way for a long time. Francesca greeted them with a smile. She was wearing a mint-color dress, long enough to cover her knees, but giving her enough freedom of movement. As usual, her hair was pinned on top of her head. She reached out in an inviting gesture and hugged them both, to the satisfaction of John and the slightly smaller of Mycroft. When John saw the interior design and colors of the salon, he guessed that Francesca was the person who had the last word in the marriage. The living room and bedroom - which John saw out of the corner of his eye - were decorated to her liking. Pastel pink color decorated the walls and upholstery of chairs and sofas. Slightly darker, but still pink curtains fluttered in the open window. The glass table and crystal chandelier added charm and the lack of rugs and the presence of many plants gave the impression of freshness. The living room was in a definitely modern style, which only assured John that each guest had a choice of an apartment that suited their taste. He noticed travel bags standing next to the bedroom wall.
"Sherlock ...". What was he supposed to ask? How is he feeling? Did something hurt him? Sherlock would ignore him or make up an excuse. When he saw his face, he knew that the last thing he was thinking about was talking. He knelt beside him and put a hand on his knee. He didn't miss how Sherlock reacted to this normal gesture. He focused his eyes on him, and barely visible satisfaction appeared on his lips. John was still wondering what he was going to say, what to ask. Finally, however, he gave up and with a soft sigh, he patted his friend several times on the knee, then stood up with difficulty and went back to the rest. The campsite was slowly beginning to resemble a real camping site. The stones were arranged in a circle. A small cauldron hung above it. Around the makeshift campfire, Sebastian set up stumps, Josh was mixing something in a metal cup, and Lucy was taking care of Arian's leg.
"Hurry up," John replied desperately into Sherlock's shoulder. He knew he had been heard because he immediately felt Mycroft's finger inside him. "Umm ..." he groaned, clenching and pushing forward.
"Maybe a keychain with the inscription 'Venice'?" Molly hesitated, looking from one souvenir stand to the other. Because of the buzz and the presence of so many people, she couldn't make up her mind.
"I know," the older man added and nodded toward the stairs with a smile. John noticed Francesca and her husband. They were waiting for them. Francesca walked over with her arms wide open. She grabbed John's face and kissed his both cheeks.
John was too stunned by Sherlock's sudden leap. He didn't understand what was happening and why. Sherlock's closeness only intensified his confusion and discomfort. He hit his back against the wall and let go of his shoes. They fell to the ground. Sherlock's hand landed right next to his left ear, pushing heavy shutters against the old wall. The striking shutters made a loud bang. The sound spread across the neighboring streets. John didn't control his breathing, he could hear his own heart beating. Sherlock surprised him in the least expected moment and in the least expected way. The whole situation might seem comical and ridiculous, but Sherlock did not look like someone who was joking. He was focused on John's face and his reactions. Then he looked down at his lips.
John, who until now shook his head in amusement, now rubbed his face and took the glass of red Valpolicella offered to him by Sherlock. He could feel the eyes of both brothers. He was not accustomed to such attention and did not know how he would behave if this kind of observation was to last longer. He decided to break the silence and force them to change their direction of thought. "What was it with Stoner's phone?" he asked, staring at Mycroft.
The drawer slid out silently. On top was a black pipe and a box of matches. Next to it, a small case and a few letters. Some stamps and a dozen broke metal pen tips.
So that's why Holmes looked like this. He was worried about what had happened the night before. Pleasant warmth spread over his body at the thought that the detective was this worried about him. "I had to act ..." he said, looking away. Holmes's mysterious, intense gaze was too hard for him to bear. "I couldn't just wait for the killer to attack, and I couldn't count on the police to handle it on their own. I want to help solve problems if I can."
"We'll have time to plan our revenge." Sherlock also did not hide his amusement. He was genuinely interested in John's offer. After all, the possibility of teasing his brother was too tempting to reject it. "Two months to be more specific."
Francesca was still smiling and did not look offended. She twirled the glass between her fingers and looked at him with a mysterious expression. "Were this really lies, John? You looked honestly when you talked about Mycroft when you first see him."
With these words, they both entered a small private plane. It had a bright interior, four armchairs covered in cream leather. Lamps were hung from the ceiling to further highlight the elegance of the aircraft. John took his seat and looked out the window.
Yes, it was the voice of his best friend. It looked like, he was arguing with his brother, and Mrs. Hudson decided she will be spying on them. But why?
He was sitting in a comfortable leather armchair. He turned off the lights above his head, so he could focus. The bright light only annoyed him when he thought about something very strongly. He forced himself not to tap his heel on the carpeted floor and not play with the phone he held tightly in his hand. He may have looked calm, but in reality, he was angry and impatient. He wanted to be at the hotel and see what the situation was. The view behind the small and wet window has not changed since the beginning of the flight. He could still see the same black space lit only by the small light of the cities below. When he looked at the cities outside the window, he knew where he was and how long he had to travel. Once in a while, a bolt of lightning striking struck the air next to the plane. He tried to focus his thoughts only on the view of cities and fields below because every memory of the reason why he actually flew to Venice droved him crazy.
"My John ... You looks much better," Francesca said, stepping up with a smile on her ruby lips. Her tight dress, slim hands and hair braided in a bun emphasized her beauty. John could look at her for hours. He came up to her and offered her his arm.
He looked at John closely. "It's good you're awake." He put the razor next to his skin. John wondered why, since his face seemed hairless and smooth enough. "Francesca called me. She wanted to know if we remember about dinner."
"I wish you good luck, then." Mycroft left the room and walked down the hall toward the exit, and Stoner wondered why his walk was so calm.
John couldn't say anything more. He felt something warm behind his back and saw Mycroft's left hand appearing from behind his head and clung to the wardrobe door. His exposed neck was wrapped in a hot breath. Silence and tension grew with every second. John's heart was beating unbelievably fast, and his breathing became as irregular as Mycroft's.
John frowned. He wasn't angry, but Mycroft's words sounded as if he had kept him at bay and controlled his every move so far. Well ... John should have expected that. He saw Mycroft take the last great sip of alcohol, turned to the table, poured some more whiskey and returned to him. They drank a little more than usual that evening and John was slowly starting to feel the effects of it. He set down his glass and looked at the other man. He was surprised when it turned out that Mycroft had been watching him for a long time now.
"I'm sorry," she whispered. "But these shoes are a little too big. I can't walk quietly," she added and looked at her elegant gold shoes.
"Hmm. Valpolicella" he muttered contentedly, gently swaying the glass. "An excellent year". The strong taste of red wine suited the late hour and circumstances. "Leave the bottle, please," he said in Italian to the elegant waiter who was waiting for his reaction.
"Sherlock is incredibly stubborn and proud. Seeing that his behavior doesn't impress me, he decided to focus all of his attention on you to draw your concern. You are his friend and ... Oh, John, you couldn't have chosen a more stubborn friend."
John was drinking his tea at a low table in the living room. He looked at Mycroft, who was working on a laptop by the window. It was late, and yet, the older man did not look like he was going to sleep.
No, but it didn't matter now. He did what he thought was best for them. "Yes," he hesitated for a moment.
The man let out a soft, even sincere laugh. "It's all about decisions, isn't it? Decisions made in a hurry, in a panic. Made with the heart instead of the head... or vice-versa. Sometimes those decisions take a long time to have repercussions. But there are repercussions. There are always repercussions", he added very slowly.
John and Aaron stared at each other in silence. John played with the glass, sliding it across the slippery table, with his fingers. Stoner sat still with a sneaky smile.
Sherlock looked at his brother for the first time that day. His eyes gleamed, and his face seemed even whiter in the moonlight.
"Fake marriage, John," Mycroft interrupted him. "I won't demand anything from you. I just want you to stand by my side as a husband and companion. No obligations. You won't have to sign a single thing. An ordinary gentleman's agreement".
John frowned. "I don't like it. I don't like your face, Sherlock and your smirk, because that usually means you have a plan... a plan related to me."
"Just like in the good old days," he confirmed with a laugh. The carriage continued its journey. The horses' hooves began to lash loudly against the stone street. People continued to rush in all directions, sometimes just in front of the horses. Conversations and shouts spread around the area.
When Mycroft started to suck his sensitive lips, John shuddered imperceptibly and let out a quiet grunt of pleasure. John was afraid to open his eyes. The fingers on his chin were warm, but with each passing moment, their touch disappeared more and more. After a few moments, he opened his eyes. His cheeks were red, and his breathing was shaky and irregular. He could still feel Mycroft's face in front of him and after a moment he saw faint blush covering Mycroft's skin not only on his cheeks. The older man's neck was red and his eyes were slightly blurry.
"We have to go this way," Sherlock said, pointing to a very narrow passage. It was so tight that they had to go one after the other.
"Rossiccio!" Everyone looked at her. She stood a little further behind the barriers separating the hotel terrace from the street. She walked toward them, and the red cat jumped off Molly's lap and ran to her. With each step she took, the surprise on John's face increased. Finally, she came close enough that he saw all the details that confirmed Mycroft's words. The girl had green hair, a T-shirt with Mickey Mouse and a large badge with the inscription 'I love Paris'. He didn't notice other things, because she quickly bent down for a red cat, picked him up and entered the crowd of tourists. Once again he stared at Mycroft, who this time pretended not to pay attention to the admiration he had been given by the others.
"So where the fuck I should put it?" Arian shouted, losing the last of his patience. "Where? I can't go there, because it will break down, neither will this shit fall off. Decide for fuck's sake! Because of your fucking advice, I am standing here like a dickhead! I piss on them! I would have been down the rock with my leg in your ass a long time ago if you hadn't talked so much, you bloody cocksucker! Get the fuck out of here before I push that stone down your throat so deep that even a slut would be impressed! "
John put the glass down on the porch railing. He avoided Mycroft's stare, but his eyes were too magnetic. The long silence was unbearable. John wanted to clear his throat to stop this strange, tense atmosphere, but he couldn't do it. He looked at Mycroft with confusion. His face and body were getting closer to John. He almost jumped when he felt Mycroft's hand on his fingers.
After a few moments, they headed to the hotel. Everything might seem fine, if not for one thing. John and Mycroft almost moaned when they saw Aaron Stoner sipping a drink on one of the lounge chairs. He smiled wide when he saw them. He stood up stared at John.
"Of course. And where did you think the largest and rarest collections in the country are located? The upper class greedily appropriates everything they consider worthy of attention and they stores it behind the panes of university exhibitions."
Francesca did not hide her amusement. "I have, but I won't tell you who he is, because I don't want to jinx it."
"And look who's saying that." John changed his position. He buried his face in a white pillow and looked at Mycroft's profile. "Is this what all our mornings will look like?" he asked, yawning. "If so, I still have to think about it."
"You wanted to say that I made them realize how much they could mean to each other," Francesca corrected her.
he thought with amusement, tangling his fingers in his friend's black hair. He heard Mycroft's soft chuckle beside him. He looked at him as the genius removed his used condom.
"I'm sorry I didn't have time to give it to you earlier. You know, John ... in the world of great politics, certain behaviors are obligatory. I'm not saying..." Mycroft did not want to offend John and tried to find the right words, but the doctor did not look satisfied with his efforts.
A strange statement. It seemed to him that Holmes was unfamiliar with human interaction, and he made note of every mention about it in his mind. He was confused for a moment, but he found this fact actually very charming. "Before you showed up, he teased me about my appearance," he continued, trying to hide the amusement in his voice.
Sherlock froze in his armchair. It was like that every time John tried to 'deduce' something from his look. He almost shuddered when he felt his warm fingers on his face. John stood slightly bent over his armchair and touched his eyebrows with his thumb. Sherlock closed his eyes and tried hard not to show his body trembling at the gesture. When he opened his eyes, he saw John watching his finger with attention. Sherlock saw the remains of purple dust that must have tangled between his eyebrows. He was surprised because he had washed his face and was sure that he got rid of the purple sediment. He heard John's murmur and saw him move toward the closed kitchen.
But John immediately realized what he intended. "No, Sherlock. No seafood and other expensive things you won't eat anyway," he said with a raised finger. He tried to remain serious, but all the time he felt the amusement and strong wine he had at Coletti's.
"... until I can be sure that Moriarty does not threaten us. I made a mistake and now we have to deal with it again." He gathered enough courage to look up and finally look him in the eye. "Forgive me".
"Apart from the numbers ..." he said and waved his hand lightly. "... Is the data we have to collect worth our lives and the lives of other people, which we will probably have to kill along the way?"
"I don't forbid you to be yourself, I just want you to stick to the plan and listen to what I say to you ..."
He gave Mycroft a light and friendly smile. "Thanks, but I'd rather stay in the room," he said, not trying to explain his decision. Mycroft just nodded and said nothing more. He took his things and left the apartment. Meanwhile, John wondered why he preferred to spend the day alone or in the company of Sherlock, who ignored him since he had promised Mycroft earlier he would play the role of his husband. If he had to think about it, he would not find this role difficult and burdensome. What's more, he liked it. But he was not going to chase Mycroft and tell him he changed his plans because he wasn't sure what to do. He knew he should be getting ready, so he changed his shoes, put on a silk shirt and a light vest, which was a must-have even on hot days. He admired Mycroft because he rarely parted with his suit, even when just looking at him was enough to get a fever. However, in such surroundings and company, the lack of elegance was very badly seen.
"You know, Mycroft ... I also want it to succeed. After all, the health and lives of my patients depend on it."
"We were talk about visiting the city with Miss Molly. Today our husbands are having a meeting, so maybe we show the area these lovely two, what do you say, John?"
"Relax, Mrs. Hudson. All you need is a few drops of Dettol and a few minutes with a vacuum cleaner and the salon will be clean. Anyway cleaner than in recent weeks." He brushed the purple residue off his armchair and settled back comfortably.
Lestrade snorted. "Oh, Watson, Watson. You don't even know how lucky you are, not knowing him, and at the same time how much you lose without knowing who he is. Holmes is... quite a strange man. He helps us in our investigations. He's completely focused on them. He's incredibly perceptive and quick-witted, but he doesn't have a very good opinion among other officers. No wonder. His judgments, ignorance, and unpleasant comments can effectively alienate even the most conciliatory people "he fell silent, seeing the confused expression on the face of his companion. "But don't worry. You'll stand aside. If you don't draw his attention, he won't even know you exist. I'll make sure he doesn't notice you."
Suddenly Molly jumped, scared by a quick knock on the door. Everyone looked at her. Perhaps in other circumstances, she would feel happy because of the sudden increase in interest in her. Maybe she would even blush and drop her eyes in embarrassment, but she realized almost immediately that she was not the center of their interest but the person behind the doors. She was standing closest to them, so with a wave of her hand, she stopped John, who was already getting ready to stand up. Without thinking much, she smoothed the yellow dress and pulled the door handle. Before she saw who was behind the door, she smelled the pleasant scent of a flower. She sighed with dissatisfaction when she saw Aaron.
He kind of knew. His silver, tousled hair must have made an unusual contrast to his flushed face and eyes that were hazy with excitement. He could barely see Sherlock walking towards them.
"How can you be sure that the information is true, that no one has fabricated it? Maybe your agents wanted faster promotion?" Sherlock asked casually. He seemed to be starting to lose interest in the conversation. He didn't even notice his brother's serious look, who wasn't pleased to hear his dismissive tone.
John shook his head. "Not unless you want something." Of course, he knew that material things were not important to his friend. Maybe with a few exceptions. Sherlock valued his violin, favorite robe and skull lying above the fireplace. The rest of the stuff often either landed in the bin or lay forgotten in the corner. "There are times and places when memories are the only thing you want to take with you." He casually looked around the store, couldn't see Sherlock's face staring at him with a smile on his face.
"If we don't take a break, we will die here anytime." Lucy once again said what each of them thought. "Let's take a rest".
The newspaper creaked in his hands as he turned the next pages. His smile might have been less ironic if it hadn't been for the title and the content on the cover, highlighted with thick, black ink. He shook his head slightly as he reached for his cup. He was savoring the taste of bitter tea, listening to the sounds from the fireplace.
"Thanks for the warning ..." he muttered, trying to free himself from Mycroft. However, the genius didn't let him do it. What's more, he put his finger on John's nipple and started brushing his neck with his lips again. He heard a soft grunt and felt John's body tremble.
John narrowed his eyes but gave up. He raised the corners of his mouth and stared into his friend's eyes for a long moment. Sherlock didn't look away. Suddenly John felt a strange warmth at the bottom of his back. Something was wrong, and the change in Sherlock's face and his narrowed eyes assured him that he should expect an unwanted person. He wanted to turn his head, but the warm air in his ear made him freeze.
"I try to avert conflicts and protect people close to me. Make sure that despite the mistakes, they do not have fatal, often tragic consequences", he said softly, joining the fingers of both hands and placing them on his thigh. "I guess that puts me in the first category, at least in a way."
After a moment, Franco stood next to Mycroft started to speak Italian with him. John realized that, yes, he was pleased with Francesca's presence, but he lacked the attention of his fake husband, which was not only incomprehensible but even disturbing.
He passed a long hall, climbed the stairs, and stood in front of the door behind which one of Mycroft's offices was located. He knew that Sherlock's older brother had several private offices, but for some reason, this was best suited to him. He knocked several times but did not hear the answer. He pressed the door handle. The door opened noiselessly. When he came inside, he was immediately overcome by a familiar smell. The smell of Mycroft and the perfume he used. He closed his eyes. Even a month earlier, the scent of cloves and incense did not impress him, he barely noticed it. Now, after two weeks of living together, he could smell it immediately. This smell made him feel strangely safe. He opened his eyes and looked around the room. It was exactly what he remembered the last time he was here, but now everything was more in control. John realized why the Venice apartment seemed so strangely familiar to him. He understood that each place had to be approved in advance by Mycroft or his people because the office and living room at the hotel that they were guests were confusingly similar to each other. Both in terms of color and design. Warm colors predominantly dominated in the elegantly arranged environment. A central place in the room was occupied by a desk made of oak wood. John decided to wait for Mycroft next to the desk. He didn't feel confident enough to sit in his chair with his back to the door. He rested his hands and back on a smooth dark desk and waited. He repeated what he intended to say to Mycroft. However, after some time he realized that no learned conversation with him made sense. He rarely had any idea what the discussion would be like with the older brother Holmes. He gave up thinking about the upcoming discussion.
"The company of my brother and Miss Hooper will certainly be enough for you. Besides, I think my presence would be at least burdensome."
Time passed slowly. The sun was starting to break into the bedroom, and the wind was moving the curtains. He stood still, though he had no idea what time it was and how long it would last. He stood there until he noticed his friend's breathing had deepened and his eyelids started to tremble. He held his breath again. This was the moment when he had to face his biggest fears. The most uncomfortable and stressful moment in his life ...
The detective wiped dried blood from his face with slow and gentle movements. He stared into his eyes for a long time before lowering his gaze to the lower half of his face with an affectionate smile.
"Exactly, John. I'm glad we agreed," with these words, Mycroft returned to tapping his fingers on the laptop keyboard. He didn't care about John's words and didn't pay attention to him. At least he tried.
John didn't hear what he was saying. He only thought about how to murder Mycroft in the most painful way.
He tilted the newspaper again towards the yellowish glow of the fire and studied the front page. And to be more specific - a drawing. This time a faint smirk appeared on his lips. Journalists might have remembered faces perfectly, but it was not the same when it comes to detail. Bad hat. Bad colors. Even the cane changed its owner. He closed his eyes, recalling a scene from several hours ago. He was there. Of course, he was. He slipped through the crowd unnoticed, though he considered himself a man who was rather difficult to ignore. He blamed it on circumstances and place. With each new victim, people became more curious about the case. The crime scene drew them like a magnet. They flocked and tried to find out how many wounds the victim had, how did she die, and how much she was suffering before she let out her last breath. It was in such places that the strangest rumors were born, and which soon spread throughout the city. He listened to the imaginary revelations with restraint and with hidden disgust. Today, however, one rumor could not be ignored. And he knew why. He had witnessed something so surprising that he remembered all the details.
After a long walk through the narrow streets, they finally reached Saint Mark's Square. They were surrounded by people speaking in different languages. The restaurants were full of people, and all the tables and chairs were occupied. John remembered when he spoke to Aaron for the first time. It was at one of the tables he had passed a moment earlier.
His words made John's blood boil. What did he mean by that? Was he relieved someone interrupted them? Then why did he even start it? What's that supposed to mean? John had had enough. He clenched his teeth and when Mycroft pulled his forehead from his shoulder, he punched him in the stomach. The older man opened his eyes wide in pain and surprise, then bent in half and slowly fell to the ground. All he heard was John's footsteps and doors slam.
He looked around the apartment. Mycroft had to hurry up. Things in his open bag were strewn around, the papers he was browsing were above and below the table. John would give a lot if he could see his husband putting on his suit and shoes in a hurry. He smiled when he imagined it. At one point John's phone started ringing. He answered it and was surprised when he heard Mycroft's voice.
He talked with Molly and Francesca for some time. Later, he discreetly put on his shoes and said goodbye to both women. He walked toward the separated room at the other end of the hotel. Lack of sleep and fatigue made him feel different, unpunished as if he were dreaming, and his decisions and actions did not carry any responsibility. He was pissed off by Mycroft's attitude. He couldn't understand why he told him to sit still for several hours. Was it a kind of lesson or punishment? He rebelled against this. What else could he do? Should he wait politely in silence for more orders? Oh no. There was no way. Especially not with irritated John Watson.
John's question confused Mycroft. He blinked several times and tried to match his words. He opened his mouth just to close it a moment later with restlessness on his face. "I guess I wasn't sure how I should behave," he said after a long silence. This answer was the safest one.
"You noticed that the victim had a swollen tongue so she was strangled. However, you can see blood on the fence that spurted after the neck was cut. The murderer must have had stains on his clothes, but no one in the area noticed anyone suspicious. No one here can afford a coachman, not to mention the horses and the carriage. The woman was killed in the early morning. She could have slept those few hours in some corner, but she found the man trustworthy. She accepted his offer, even though she didn't have to.
John managed to get closer to the bedroom door. He stopped next to the mahogany cabinet, turned away and narrowed his eyes. "Do we have to?"
The blood boiled in John to this level that he almost turned on his heel. Almost. He fought the temptation to continue discussions with Sebastian. He passed the next trees confidently and quickly. "Don't interfere in this, James. Don't interfere in my life, for there has long been no place for you in it!"
"Oh my God...". She stopped cleaning and picked up the silver bowl. She had to look more closely because she had no idea what was inside. When she realized that she was looking at the cut off human tongues, she quickly put down the bowl with visible disgust on her face. "Oh, no. I don't want to have anything to do with it." She tensed her body and went to the door leading to the corridor. "Clean it up, Sherlock, before John returns. He's not in the best mood today." She closed the door and returned to her ground floor kitchen.
He heard no answer. Instead, he heard voices and a murmur in the background. He put the basket down and put his free hand to his ear, focusing on the sounds.
"Oh yes! It would be like a double date," Molly said and laughed happily, grabbing Sherlock's arm. She looked at John with hope in her eyes, as if trying to convince him of the idea.
"She did it because she did not want to expose the rest of the family to the humiliation that would be brought about by the fact that their son's chosen one was another man. Also, her brother would also face terrible punishment and condemnation for this type of practice. That is why she killed him and later she took her own life because of pain and loss. "
He smiled under his breath. Sherlock and Mycroft were very similar, though they didn't even know it or didn't want to admit it. These short, concise messages were so similar, it was easy to confuse who actually wrote them. Sherlock or Mycroft? They both had the habit of informing the other party with the least amount of words. John wasn't surprised when Mycroft did it. His messages made sense. But when Sherlock sent messages, it was short but often lacked valuable content. These were just notifications that he was bored or he didn't have interesting investigations.
John was walking ahead, completely ignoring what was happening around him. He was stunned and did not focus on conversations coming from behind high buildings, a dazzling sunrise, the sound of passing ships or the quick steps of his friend walking just behind him. He still did not believe what had happened several minutes earlier in this cool and dark street. Sherlock Holmes, the same Sherlock who was abstaining from all kinds of intimacy, has changed completely now. John did not recognize his friend, but everything started to make sense - his strange behavior, seeking close physical contact, persistent glances or that kiss attempt. Sherlock Holmes was up to something, and that was ...
"Mycroft forgot these files. He asked me to brought it to him," John replied. He started looking for the gondola because he wanted to free himself from Aaron as soon as possible.
Somewhere in his head - somewhere behind, in the darkest and most dusty corner of his mind palace - was a question. And he had to know the answer. He hesitated for a long time before saying it out loud. He didn't want to sound desperate, so he asked, not looking at Mycroft and playing with the thread protruding from the back of the sofa.
John just looked down to smile and shake his head. Finally, he looked at Aaron with a slight disappointment. So many years with Sherlock and something that finally came in handy was the experience he acquired through living with a genius.
John dropped his backpack and looked around. The idea of longer rest improved his mood a bit. He took off his shoe and poured small stones from inside. "I'll take care of Arian," he said to Lucy who was kneeling next to him.
Holmes stopped where the carriages completely blocked their view. "Listen, Watson," he began in a voice that left no doubt that he had made up his mind for something and would get it right at all costs. "Go to your flat," he raised his hand, cutting off the yet to be started discussion. "Get ready to move, and I'll send you a telegram when everything is ready for your arrival." He bent down with a smile. "Then we'll bring the Ripper to justice. And after that ..." he put his mouth to his ear, "... it will be your turn to fulfil the promise you gave me."
He stopped, almost crashing into the detective's back. He looked at him and then at the inspector. "I will consider that option, but first I will help Mr Holmes catch Jack the Ripper." The face of his new friend reassured him that the detective was very happy with his decision. Maybe a little too happy.
After noting the address and finding specific files with documents, John immediately went to the building, which was quite close to their hotel. When he left the apartment, he was hit by incredible heat. His face immediately felt wet, even though he was still in the hotel where the air conditioning was working. He wondered if Mycroft really could or would not want to go back to the documents. Every option seemed likely to John. However, he could not disappoint Mycroft, he did not want to.
The doctor gave him a warm smile and when he pulled the door handle, for some reason he felt that the man was grateful and relieved, although he did not say it out loud. The bathroom was still stuffy and sultry, and although Mycroft wiped the mirror, folded towels, and straightened all the creams, perfumes and even toothbrushes on the shelf, John could still smell his scent on every item. It was as if he were surrounding him with his arms. He liked the smell and since he had more time, he decided not to hurry and take a cool bath instead of a shower. He lay in the tub and soaked his swollen legs until he knew he had to leave. He wasn't such a pedant like Mycroft, so he just drained the bathtub, hung up towels, and rinsed the bathtub with running water. When he left the bathroom, he looked around, but there was no sign of his husband anywhere. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flashing LED on the cell phone. He wrapped the robe more tightly, went to his phone and read the message.
The girl did not know what to say. She shrugged and looked at her feet. "I didn't want to stay there alone. I thought you were coming back to the hotel."
"Who was that man?" He asked, trying to control his breathing. His curiosity was too great, and from the detective's expressions, he concluded that he could finally satisfy it.
"But now I know more things and I wonder if I should thank Mycroft for that ..." Sherlock said with a smirk. John immediately sensed a change in mood and could not help but smile. He sighed with relief and returned to his previous position.
"Can we do that?" John asked. His friend was already browsing the menu as if it was obvious to him that they would use Mycroft's assistant's suggestion.
Aaron was a little confused, but he didn't show it. He smiled in that specific way. "Your chosen one feels very responsible and will not let you lose your respect because of him. Therefore, I will give him an offer. In exchange for my silence and promise to delete the photo, I will offer him a night at my side, and he will agree to that. He is an honorable man. He won't leave you alone with this problem. He will let me... seduce him. "
While he was drinking brandy in an elegant carriage, the killer vented his frustration with a failed attack on another woman.
"My brother has nothing to do with it," he snarled warningly, but John knew his words were not true. Everything made sense now. This strange rebellion, avoiding uncomfortable situations and conversations, pretending that nothing has happened in the last two weeks. Mycroft was jealous of his brother. Who knows, maybe even ashamed of what he did to him? Suddenly a question appeared in John's head and he had to know the answer.
"One and a half ..." he muttered under his breath. He loved to correct his brother, although this time he did it out of habit. He sounded like he just couldn't help himself. Instantly he twisted the tip of the umbrella into the floor.
"Nothing," the attractive man said and raised his hands. "I'm just impressed, Mycroft..." he added with pretended admiration.
"And how do you like it? This journey into the unknown ..." Mycroft asked seductively. "Do you mind sharing your findings with us?"
When John returned to the apartment, he fell on the bed and put his cheek on a soft pillow. He only had the strength to remove his shoes with the tips of his toes, because he fell asleep a moment later, surrounded by the pleasant scent of fresh bedding. He didn't sleep long, but enough to rest his body. He regained consciousness when the bedroom got a bit colder and when he heard Molly's muted laughter from the other apartment through the open window. It wasn't an annoying sound, but John had had enough of these two for one day. He took his pillow and covered his ears with it. There was a pleasant silence for a moment. He wondered what he would do until the end of the day, or rather the evening because he had time to notice that the sun had to hide behind the horizon. He knew he had three options. He could stay in the room, which would be a great loss because it was his penultimate evening in Venice, he could also leave the room and come across Sherlock and listen to Molly's delighted sighs, or spend the evening with Mycroft. The last option pleased to him the most. After all, he was supposed to pretend to be his husband. Besides, he had to admit when Mycroft did not make his comments and refrained from pointing out his mistakes, spending time with him was a pleasure and was associated with a hint of adrenaline because John never knew who they would meet and what they would have to do.
John frowned. He straightened up and put away the things he was holding. "Why does everyone think we are a couple?"
"Mycroft, we agreed to work together, but I won't let you lock me in the room. I won't wait for your orders. If you want this whole thing to be successful, you must tell me about your plans and let me know everything."
"Why such a conclusion?" Mycroft asked. He turned his attention away from the almost empty glass and looked carefully at his brother.
"Then let's go to the cafe around the corner, and after that, I'll personally walk you to your apartment," he said softly, almost hanging over John. Seeing hesitation in John's eyes, he put his hand on his lower back and led him past the large building. John saw a huge square with lots of cafes, tables, chairs and a bunch of people.
Greg interrupted her. He cleared his throat and opened the notebook. "Today in the morning a body of a teenage girl was found in Lambeth. Nicole Hopkins. She was lying next to the door to the apartment she was renting with her cousin and her several-year-old son. She was stabbed several times, but we couldn't pinpoint how many exactly..."
"Dear Lord. How these people can function here?" Lestrade wondered aloud, making this kind of comments from time to time.
"Don't be ridiculous, John. I know my limits and I know when I must give up. Unlike others. And that's why I don't wander around the city until the morning and I don't taste my friend's saliva, among empty streets... ". The bitterness in his voice was unbearable. He said what he thought about John's behavior before he realized it was wrong. He fell silent for a moment and went back to writing.
"John ..." Mycroft interrupted him in a very calm but imperious tone. He smiled in that artificial way that was meant to make him understand, from now on his words would be saturated with sarcasm. "... I am extremely pleased, you care about our success and you try to help me. I appreciate it. But ..." he lowered his voice, wanting to add a more serious and darker effect to his next words. "Bishop's goal is to check the King. And you, John, you are a pawn, a point on the chessboard, which sooner or later becomes redundant. Pawn is not the goal of the game. It's not my intention to offend you by saying this. All I mean is you are the means to the goal, and this goal for Stoner and his intrigues is me. I told from the beginning you should not to focus on anything else but playing your role. You are doing very well, so do it for a few more days, and leave me the rest. Aaron Stoner will soon lose interest in you and you won't have to think about him anymore".
Standing under the water, John felt sperm running down his thighs. He looked down and saw bruises on his hips that Mycroft had left. He gently touched them with his fingertips and hissed in pain. Purple spots were proof of their passion. John wasn't proud of them, but for some reason, he didn't feel guilty either. He took note of what had happened at night and decided to leave it like this for now. But what Mycroft intends to do about it? John would gladly ask him, but he left the apartment before John woke up.
John, still staring at Sherlock, kissed the inside of his thighs right next to his groin and then the base of his penis. He heard a loud groan.
John sighed softly. "No thank you, Mycroft. I think I'll go to bed." He got up from the couch. "It was an intense day."
"John, please ... I forgot about the very important documents because of this rush. Could you bring them to me? I would be extremely grateful to you..."
No one commented. Sherlock finally broke the uncomfortable silence. "Molly, I think it will be better if you go to your room. Someone's teeth will start to fall on the floor in a moment," he growled in a low voice. He didn't like the way Aaron looked at John. Although he was never prone to violence, he felt itching in his fingers.
"Sherlock, your phone is ringing!" John shouted, grabbing a cool dinner from the fridge. He wasn't in the best mood. From the early morning, he had to struggle with adversity. Both at home and at work. The hospital where he worked did not have enough resources to provide help to those in need. For John as a doctor, there was nothing worse than the fact that he couldn't help patients because of a lack of money. He had enough restrictions and bans.
"Speaking of which..." John said. His tone attracted Mycroft's attention. They both stood face to face next to one of the columns. "Do you know anything about our new apartment?" he asked.
The hansom cab stopped in front of a flat on Baker Street. He jumped out of the cab, almost twisting his leg. He gave the smiling coachman an amused look. While he was paying, the door to the building swung open. He wasn't sure what he was looking at. Something monstrous appeared on the sidewalk. Fluffy. An enormous bow was barely visible from beneath the spreading white feathers that flowed down the puffed sleeves of a burgundy dress. He lowered his head and saw the familiar eyes and sincere smile that undoubtedly belonged to Mrs Hudson.
He looked around the room, not noticing a single Mycroft's private thing. He had the impression the older man did not want to show his human side. It was annoying, mysterious but intriguing. To his surprise, he heard a soft knock on the front door. He covered himself with the hotel dressing gown and pulled on the door handle.
"It would be such a shame to close my eyes when I see something like that. All these buildings seem so small and cute ..."
Mycroft seemed surprised by John's words because he sat motionless for a moment. But after a few seconds, he nodded calmly.
"Do you know that John is suffering because of your behavior?" he asked, wanting to make his brother feel guilty. And it worked. Sherlock twitched and froze. "You understood only some emotions and feelings, you think you know them better than I do... You can play with them, but you completely do not know the subtleties of this world, Sherlock. You don't know the feelings of sadness and rejection. And John is at the stage of dealing with them ... The effect may surprise you. "
Holmes managed to grab the antique knife before it got stuck to the wooden floor. For a moment he froze in place with his hand outstretched. He straightened up very slowly. "This blade would cut the throat, but it is not suitable for gutting."
"Then you wouldn't even have to get out of the taxi," he sighed and slowly and reluctantly released John's hand and sank comfortably into the armchair.
They stood like that for a few more minutes. John yawned and turned to the room. "Night, Sherlock. Try not to get even weirder by the morning."
"This whole situation is very uncomfortable for all of us, so I suggest you leave, Sherlock, for now," Mycroft did not look at his brother. He was trying to control this nervous atmosphere somehow because he wasn't used to being out of control. His thoughts about what he should say or how to behave mixed in his mind, causing total emptiness and paralysis.
"He asked you ..." John repeated, imagining what Sherlock's 'ask' must have looked like in reality. He suddenly realized Molly didn't know Francesca. "Oh, forgive me, Francesca. This is Miss Molly Hooper. She has been friends with me and Mycroft for many years. This is Mrs. Francesca Coletti, Molly. She looks after me during this trip," he added, standing between two women. They shook hands and then started a casual conversation. He listened to their discussion, but his thoughts started to wander as soon as they took their seats at the table.
John didn't answer right away. He watched him, and then he smiled the way only he could do it. He tightened his grip on his hand and calmly pulled him towards Baker Street.
"Don't get so angry, it's not good for your nerves, Lestrade." Holmes did not care about the inspector's irritation. He knelt beside the corpse and pulled a magnifying glass from his pocket. "This is not the first and not the last murdered prostitute we will find."
The interior reminded John of what he saw at the Danieli Hotel. It had different colors though and a more modern style. The marble floor sparkled with lights flickering around. The hotel staff greeted everyone with a smile and a small bow. Mycroft pulled John forward. Behind the great stairs was a hall with a purple carpet. There was a glass door at the very end of the corridor. John saw the flashing lights and heard muted elegant music. When they came through the glass door, they saw a huge banquet hall. Black, shiny carpet covered half of the room. The tables and chairs were set up in front of the dance floor. People gathered in larger and smaller groups, occupying almost every free space. They talked to each other, laughed and discussed important and less important matters. John has never seen such elegant people. He almost had to squint when he was looking at women's jewelry. He looked around and noticed there was no person who did not hold a glass of champagne or a stronger drink.
"Due bicchieri di acqua, per favore," Aaron said, not waiting for John's reaction. The woman did not even save the order. She bowed slightly and walked away. John didn't realize he was watching her. His attention was caught by Aaron's amused voice.
"I want to get to know you more, John. Mycroft told me a lot, but it's still not enough. My husband like you too. He has a meeting with Mycroft and others today, but ..."
Sherlock looked at his brother out of the corner of his eye. He heard his voice but didn't know how to interpret his words. Was he talking about himself or him? Mycroft was in such a state that it was impossible to deduce. "I heard that what happened in Venice stays in Venice," he said, changing the subject.
"What else? Mycroft ... you won't tell me you're afraid of losing their trust. Damn, you're the smartest guy I know. You could serve them the biggest lie on the earth and they still would believe you. You could come up with a simple excuse about this bloody ring ... So why? Why are you bothering so much to convince me of your proposal?"
He closed the apartment and went down the stairs to the lobby. Molly and Sherlock were waiting for him. Genius allowed the girl to stick to him and he patiently did not avoid her wooing. Molly held his forearm. She was in a euphoric state, and not even John's presence changed that. The three of them went towards the gondola. The boat was there to take them to the other end of the canal. Molly was sitting right next to Sherlock, and John opposite them next to the gondolier's legs. He almost rolled his eyes when he looked at the happy woman and his friend. Genius did not return her joy and enchantment in the same way, but her presence did not seem to bother him. What's more, he still wasn't looking at John.
"By your smell," he gave him a furtive glance to enjoy his expression. "You smell like cinnamon beer. The only cinnamon beer in London can be found in Prospect of Whitby. This is Lestrade's favorite place. He visits this pub after quarrels with his wife. Recently he complained that he had booked a trip for them, but of course, he wouldn't go anyway. He invited you because he wanted to complain about his marriage, and at the same time resell tickets for half the price "his words made John smile more and more. "You took his offer, and to celebrate it, you bought wine. Not your favorite one because you didn't have more money with you. This wine is cheaper. Although quite tasty anyway." To show that he really enjoyed and was happy with John's decision, he closed his eyes and took a few sips. He heard his friend's quiet and extremely pleasant giggle. He imagined him shaking his head in disbelief.
"I brought you these documents, Mycroft. I hope they are the ones you were talking about," John said with small confusion in his voice. He handed the file to an older man and ... what Mycroft did, shocked him as much as for the first time. Mycroft took the documents and raised John's chin with the other hand. He came closer, then bowed his head and kissed the shorter man. John shuddered but kissed him back. It was a short and pure kiss. It meant they were being watched. When they pulled away, John looked into Mycroft's eyes and heard a quiet grunt next to him.
"Everything according to the plan?" Mycroft asked, walking over to John and shaking his hand in greeting.
John was so overwhelmed by his thoughts he did not realize he was still standing in the middle of the living room. He only came to his senses when he felt a draft when the bedroom door opened. He raised his head and looked at the sleepy Sherlock, who had just got out of bed a moment before. When he saw John he stood in place and rubbed his eyes to look at him better. The wind blew his curly hair.
"Sherlock is more friendly when he lets someone get to know him better," he said and only looked at her for a split second, raising the corner of his mouth.
He immediately noticed his brother, who was sitting cross-legged at a low table and was busy reading something on a laptop. When Sherlock saw his older brother, he quickly closed the laptop. He got up off the floor and sat on the couch without a hurry.
Oh yes. He noticed it. He always knew John's mood. Just one look was enough for him. He knew everything about him or at least hoped so. John was his whole world. For a very long time. And although he dared not admit it aloud, he... loved him. Yes. He loved John. He was sure of it. He had loved him for a long time, but he never dared to tell him about it. What's more, he didn't have the opportunity lately, and even if he did, he didn't take advantage of it. He was afraid to lose his beloved friend, so despite the pain and longing he was silent and dreamed about him how he had always done it for several years now. He never cared about other people's opinions. John did. Sherlock saw it in his body language. Each time his friend tensed his muscles and smiled uncomfortably when someone looked at them as if they were a couple. Sherlock didn't understand why John cut himself off from his sexual orientation so much. He knew he had some childhood traumas, but he felt pain when John corrected other people - by telling them they were not a couple - with such determination. This has changed recently, which was a great relief and comfort to Sherlock.
John shook his head, shielding his eyes from the water that cooled his body. He knew he should no longer think about love and its consequences in the future because it was confusing his mind. He had already made up his mind, and he knew he was doing the right thing. He stood in the shower, thinking about nothing. He allowed his body to rest and prepared himself for the upcoming confrontation. They really wanted to hear his decision? Okay then. He will grant their wish. He didn't know how long he stood under the water. He guessed it was a long time because the skin on his fingers was wrinkled. He cooled down. He felt better and was ready to talk. He gratefully looked at the clothes Mycroft had decided to give him as a gift. The same clothes he was wearing in Venice suddenly became a symbol of the love and strange devotion that appeared so unexpectedly between them.
"What can I get you?" the waitress asked in English. She appeared so unbelievably quickly and John almost jumped in surprise.
"You should ask him. You two are married after all," she replied with slight amusement and settled back in her chair.
The road up the stairs seemed long and winding. Sherlock had the feeling that during his absence Mrs. Hudson remodeled their flat, increasing the number of stairs, moving the walls and adding countless unnecessary things on their way. When they finally reached the bedroom, they were sweaty and wet with saliva. They lost their shirts somewhere halfway. They opened the bedroom door with a bang, and they also closed it in the same way. They fell on the bed exchanging kisses and caressing their bodies with greedy hands. Sherlock had the feeling that he had forgotten about something. The thought stayed with him for a moment, but it disappeared when John sucked on his neck. He closed his eyes in pleasure, arched his back, and sighed loudly. He was going to show John how much he adored and loved him. He wanted to prove that his love was greater than he could have imagined. He wanted to finally prove that despite the opinion of the cold sociopath he acted before other people, he could love with all his heart, devote himself to a loved one and make him happy. His desires and intentions, however, melted away under hot breath, deep kisses, and other wonderful things John was doing to him right now. His beloved John. He let him caress his body and although he was not skilled at all, he returned his efforts as best he could. As their naked bodies joined together, he shuddered, letting out a long sound of pleasure. He had longed to experience this feeling for so long, although he doubted for a long time whether he would ever be able to know it. When John rubbed against him, when he was panting in his ear, and when he was whispering words that he could not distinguish by excitement, he prayed that it would not turn out to be a dream. One of his dreams. A sleepy desire that melted when he opened his eyes. However, John's kisses, his insistence, and dexterity made him realize how much reality differed from his wildest dreams. He found this out when a shiver and spasm shook his body. When everything around him swirled under the influence of the pleasure he felt down his stomach.
The woman looked down and relaxed her crossed arms. She gave him a humble look and walked over to the other table without a word.
"Come on, John," she said with obvious amusement. John decided to devote himself to her protection. He didn't even look back when he walked slowly down the stairs, watching out for Francesca's tiny body. Of course, he realized his excessive concern for a woman may seem strange. However, her slim body and slow movements seemed to be asking for his attention. She did not let him feel that his efforts were unnecessary, on the contrary, she smiled at his concern.
Elder Holmes looked exhausted. He sat and rubbed his eyes with his fingers. He was pale and weak. "I'm still waiting for John's reply."
Mycroft listened with a raised eyebrow. "You exaggerate, as usual. Nobody behaves like this among us."
"Don't run away. I was hoping to talk to you a little bit. You've been avoiding me for some time now."
John was barely able to hear their words and keep his sane mind. His heart pounded in his throat, and the blood rushed in his ears. He ran to the door, catching a glimpse of a black car parked in the street from the corner of his eye. The same car he had been looking for for several days. He was running with the phone pressed against his face.
"I'll take your word for it. We've been sit in this concrete prison for three weeks ..." she said, looking around, "and he keeps his distance as if each of us was smeared in some shit. Although on the other hand, I think... maybe it's because of stress? " A silent question appeared on her expressive and beautiful face. "Or maybe he just found someone special and decided to focus on that person."
He was about to turn his head, to look at Sherlock, but Mycroft leaned forward and grabbed his lips between his own. He kissed him gently, tenderly. After a few seconds, they broke apart, and John noticed that Mycroft had pulled something out from his trousers' pocket. He smiled, shaking his head. "It scares me that you had it with you all the time," he said, looking at the packet of condoms between his fingers.
The question surprised him no less than the detective's investigative tone. "We're not ... that close," he said uncertainly, raising his eyebrow. "Besides, Lestrade has a wife ...".
It wasn't like he enjoyed upset Mycroft. He just wanted to show that he would not let him treat him that way. He didn't want to be like some object that Mycroft could show off to others. He was supposed to pretend to be a loving husband, but that doesn't mean he would lose his character. John wanted to make Mycroft show his other face than what he presented to his surroundings. He wanted to get him up of a comfortable chair, ignore the prying eyes and leave the room. He was convinced Mycroft had such authority he did not have to ask anyone for permission. He wanted to mess up his plans, just like an older man did. However, nothing like that happened. Mycroft continued to sit with a murderous look on his face. He didn't even mind the mocking smile of Stoner, who was watching their confrontation. John gave up. He put the phone in his pocket and went up the stairs to the apartment.
John was surprised and he looked around. He wanted to make sure they didn't become objects of interest to other people. But they paid more attention to tourist attractions, not to the two men standing in the middle of the promenade. He caught his friend's gaze and stared at him for a long moment. He finally capitulated because Sherlock didn't look like someone who was about to give up. John took a deep sigh, came closer to his friend and embraced his waist. He immediately felt Sherlock's arms on his shoulders and back. He stood still for a moment, then after a few numb seconds, he loosened his grip and lowered his hands, trying to pull away.
"How the hell do you know that?" John put the glass back on the armrest and stared at his friend with undisguised admiration. "How did you deduce it?".
At this point, Mycroft wrapped his fingers around the base of his cock and squeezed quite tightly. As John regained control of his own body, the older genius leaned over him and brought his lips to his ear. "Wait for me".
Doctor Phillips' impassive voice caught his attention. He looked away from the detective, who was still staring at him.
John saw a pleased smile on his face, but Sherlock refrained from making any comments. John followed his tall friend deep into the apartment. He felt strange. Like a burglar or a lover, visiting his beloved, but quickly got rid of these thoughts from his head. He followed Sherlock quietly, stumbling over something from time to time. They didn't turn on the light. He saw an open bedroom door and two beds out of the corner of his eye. Someone was sleeping in one of them. John was relieved to know that the beds in their bedroom were separate. He scolded himself for such thoughts.
