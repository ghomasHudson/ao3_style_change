Dean walks up the long concrete path -- a bit cracked, a bit uneven -- and knocks on the bungalow’s yellow door. It takes a bit for Cas to answer, and by the time he does Dean’s got his head craned all the way around to watch a guy across the street struggle to put up some early Halloween decorations.
Dean pays quickly and heads for the door. Cas follows, and the brief pressure of a hand on his arm tells Dean that maybe he did notice, after all.
A split second later his eyes went wide and Cas quickly followed up with “No! I’m sorry, I mean,” Cas took a breath. “I’m sorry, Dean, I really am.”
“Okay okay, sorry man. Just, never mind,” Dean says with a smile. “Start her up and let’s see if it was just the gas.”
So at first, he wasn’t that mad about the eggs. He’d ordered runny eggs with his stack of waffles and a side of both bacon and sausage. When it came out everything looked perfect, the bacon was crisp and the waffles were that perfect golden brown color, but when he cut into his eggs, they weren’t runny.
-surrogate but Dean doesn’t say much about that, just that his mom and dad are “gone.” The qualifier “real” in front of “dad” is conspicuous in its absence, as if diminishing Bobby like that would be an undeserved insult. Or maybe that using it would give the other man undeserved praise.
“Yes. This man has invited all these hungry people to eat the food he’s preparing for them.” Cas gestures at footage of a housewife who is way too excited about a bowl of perfectly chopped vegetables. “It’s very generous of him.”
Dean finally stands up from the pastry case and watches Castiel’s slow progress toward the booth Sam has picked out. Cas usually follows behind the Winchesters anyway, but today he’s really scoping things out. Dean sometimes wonders if Cas brings up the rear because it’s a tactical thing, like he’s guarding them in case something sneaks up from behind. Or maybe he feels like a third wheel; Dean hopes not, but is also pretty sure Cas would point out that none of them are wheels, so of course he doesn’t think he’s the third one.
“No. Well, I have a cat.” Cas’ face softens a little. It’s still fairly neutral but it looks more natural, more relaxed.
Before Dean can turn away to take his secret and not-so-secret stash back to his bedroom, Cas says, a note of triumph in his voice, “I thought you’d like the cowboy.”
“So uh, good morning,” Bobby offers in a tepid attempt to break up the awkward staring match going on between Dean and the angel who appeared unannounced in his home,
Sam’s stopped digging now too and looks at his brother, clearly surprised to hear Dean float the idea of leaving the life.
“Dean, I’m not sure visiting a city of sin is a good idea,” Cas cautions from the backseat. “You recall the den of iniquity. An entire city celebrating all of sin will be infinitely worse.”
Sam swallows a bark of laughter and Bobby sighs audibly and pours a little more whiskey into his coffee.
Finished with his bag, Sam takes one last look around the room to make sure they’ve got everything. Dean doesn’t miss how his eyes linger on Cas’ wings, which are still visible. “So you just, like, have wings now?”
Dean spends the rest of the day thinking about money, and by the time they go to bed that night he feels pretty good about things. He knows Cas has a savings account, though he isn’t sure how much is in it, and he knows that the mortgage on the house -- which they started splitting when Dean moved in -- is manageable. Dean himself makes a pretty decent living at the garage and though he doesn’t have much savings, except for a credit card he’s been chipping away at for a couple of years he also doesn’t have any debt. Who ever would have thought that not going to school would have been a good thing. And neither of them have car payments. Cas’ health insurance, yeah they’ll have to figure that out, but it’s the beginning of the month so they’ve got a few weeks.
Normally, Dean would have to fend off a gentle barrage of questions and concern, of puppy dog eyes and forehead creases that beg Dean to open up and give Sam more. This morning though, Sam is quiet, limiting the few questions he does ask to the bare minimum needed to keep the story straight. Dean figures it’s because Sam doesn’t want to linger on Dean’s experiences any more than
"That the… babysitter's… dead. No? Nothin'? Okay." Dean slinks away, taking Sam’s deadpan irritation as his cue to start gathering stuff up and walking it out to the car.
Castiel’s never been quite human enough to learn from personal experience what toilet paper is for, but he has some ideas. After their encounter with Famine, Dean had been sure Cas was about to find out but had somehow managed to avoid whatever Dean was cracking jokes about. His vessel felt a little funny, and then it didn’t, and he was fine. The one thing he’s certain of is that toilet paper is important. Critical, even. He’d heard the panicky desperation in Dean’s voice when he realized there wouldn’t be any in Purgatory, and he’d heard Sam shout about it from behind the closed door of more than one questionable truckstop bathroom. Yes, Cas should get some toilet paper.
Dean and Sam walk back toward Cas but slow when they see that yeah there is definitely a bird over there and Cas looks like he is definitely talking to it. His mouth isn’t moving, but his face has the same intensity and focus it does when he’s listening to a local sheriff try to make sense of the unexplainable. Still crouched down, Cas and the bird seem like they’re about the same size, which wow, that is one big-ass bird. Maybe it’s an eagle?
Mostly, Dean liked to think of himself as a pretty chill guy. He had to be, what with Dad and Sam always locked in some battle with Dean in the middle. Ever since they lost Mom, it was Dean’s job to keep his family together, his job to be the peacemaker.
“Surprised? No.” Sam continues stuffing clothes into his duffle, while Dean watches Cas methodically take things out of Dean’s, look at them, and then place them back in the green canvas bag. “Dean, you really think it takes me all day to make fake IDs? I was giving you guys some space, and
Dean had only been out of the ground a day or two when the enormity of the situation hit him. It was crazy enough to get raised from the dead, but throwing in the apocalypse -- the actual, biblical, motherfucking
Dean was breathing heavily, and he slammed the plate on the counter, hearing it crack. Everyone in the place was staring at him, mouths agape.
Sam looks at Dean like this is, quite possibly, the stupidest thing Dean has ever said. He might be right. Cas seems to agree, but his voice is softened by recollection instead of edged with judgement when he pipes up. “Dean, the Grand Canyon is extremely memorable. And it is not,” and Dean can hear the air quotes even if he doesn’t see them, “a ‘
Dean runs a hand down his face and is immediately aware of everything he hadn’t been aware of just a moment ago: the patch of dried drool on his cheek, his slimy teeth and fuzzy tongue, the way his jeans twisted uncomfortably as he slept, the fact that he’s still wearing his shoes for god’s sake. He’d been so comfortable just a moment before, and now all that’s dropped away. Dean can’t quite look at Sam, but he can tell just from the way he takes his next breath that Sam’s about to say something “important” so Dean cuts him off at the pass.
“I’ll have, um…” Cas fidgets with the laminated menu, corners curled up and peeling apart, studies it carefully, and answers “Maple syrup.”
In the background, he could hear the low rumble of Dean’s voice as he and Lisa picked up what seemed like a long standing argument. He only caught snippets, but it seemed like they couldn’t decide whether or not to move in with each other. Cas tried not to listen, it was rude to eavesdrop and especially rude to eavesdrop on something so personal. Instead he focused on perfecting Dean’s order. It was important.
a store. The only person who sees him materialize outside the front door is a man driving a cement mixer which he promptly crashes into a fire hydrant in surprise, cement leaking everywhere and water shooting thirty feet into the air. It’s not a big deal.
“You spoil me, baby,” he murmured as he sat up and Cas brought the tray in and carefully set it on his lap, before climbing back into bed and snuggling up with him.
“Dean, we’ve driven 600 miles already today.” Sam yawns from the passenger seat and makes a show of stretching out his legs what little he can.
What follows is a private conversation in theory only. The complimentary breakfast of private conversations. It’s not that Dean’s yelling -- he’s not, his voice is a tensely whispered hiss -- it’s just that Charlie’s apartment is not large and despite technically being in another room, the conversation is happening about four feet away from everyone. Castiel sits and listens to himself being talked about and wishes he could shrink down and fit under the TV stand alongside the cat that will not be coming back out for the rest of the evening.
out of Cas’ still-closed hand and tucks it carefully back into the other magazine. “For educational purposes.”
At first, Castiel is still. Frozen. Just as Dean's about to pull away and stammer out that he's misjudged and that he's sorry, he feels Cas' hand on his neck and hears the angel make a small sound of surprise and contentment. Dean deepens the kiss, parting his mouth a bit around the plush, pink lips he's been sneaking glances at since he first met the angel. Cas, though, doesn't seem to get what Dean is hinting at and continues to press himself against Dean in a manner that can really only be described as enthusiastically demure. It's not that Cas is a prude or anything, Dean's pretty sure, it's that he has no idea what he's really doing. Going on pure technique, if Dean had to measure this kiss against all the others he's had in his life Cas wouldn't even rank in the top half. But Cas keeps making these little sounds and his hand has gone from gripping Dean's neck to petting across the side of his face and into his hair and yeah, Cas might not know what he's doing but he sure as hell knows what he wants.
“Eggs.” Cas replied without turning around. After realizing Dean wasn’t going to say anything else, Cas continued. “Caviar are eggs. I thought we were playing a game about eggs.”
“Buddy, if you really want to stand out here and stare at moths all night, go right ahead, but I’d--- Sam and I we’d both rather you came inside and hung out with us.”
“...The Star Trek Experience.” A small smile lights across Dean’s face, making him look young in a way he really hasn’t since he returned from Hell.
“‘There are Sam girls and Dean girls,’” Dean quotes himself, talking over Cas with a faraway look in his eyes.
A muffled “I’m not brushing it!” sounds through the door before Sam exits, half dressed and hair looking suspiciously shiny. Dean gives it a scrutinizing look before examining the watch that is not on his wrist. “Yeah yeah...” Sam grumbles, quickly throwing on a shirt with none of the touchy-feely crap that
Turning to Dean, Mildred gave him a sympathetic “Missed you these last weeks,” then sent a head tilt Cas’ way and said “
Sam lets out a huff and quickly turns away so Dean, who has now very much looked up from the table, won’t see the small smile that’s spread across his face.
Cas isn’t exhausted enough to be on the edge of shutting down, but whatever energy reserves he draws from to perform socially expected mannerisms is completely empty. He knows this means he’s staring stoically at Dean, face as blank as it can get, a canvas most people project anger or boredom or vacuousness onto without bothering to check first if those are actually what Castiel is feeling.
It’s kind of hard to miss, honestly, this conspicuously modern flat screen, far too big for the bedroom it’s in and plunked on top of a rickety clapboard dresser that was clearly never meant to hold it. Dean had bought it, on impulse, soon after moving in with Bobby; he’d just wanted something that was his, that stood out from everything else in that house as
“Mmm. And coffee.” Cas gestures toward the line of dirty coffee mugs balanced on the arm of the couch.
“Oh I know I know, it’s so desperate,” Balthazar waves a hand with as many rings as fingers. “I don’t like it either but what other options are there around here, really?”
. What I don’t like is being the Sword of Michael. What I don’t like being told by a bunch of divine dickbags that I have to choose between killing my brother and letting the entire fucking world die!” Dean’s voice has been getting louder, and by the end of the sentence he’s practically shouting.
a last hurrah, but it’s also the best damn pie Dean has ever had. As he glances over at his brother and his angel -- still talking about who knows what -- a smaller, quieter voice answers the chorus of self doubt echoing through his head.
“What do you guys want to watch?” Dean’s already flipping through the channels, and before anyone can answer he lets out a groan. “There’s like four channels and they all look like shit.”
wants to stay mad at Cas, but he’s also never turned down a pie in his life. Cas is just staring at him all puppy-dog eyes and pouty mouth, Sam thinks he’s hiding that smirk better than he actually is, and Dean’s maybe kind of salivating at this point because he smells---
“Well, okay fine. But it’s good though too. Shut up,” Dean says to the face Sam’s making, then turns to directly address Cas. “So yeah, that’s the first show. And then there was another one in the late 80s with Captain Picard, it was on all the time when we were kids and had the best character, Data, and---”
,” Sam rubs a nervous hand on the back of his neck. “Just, we all went about our lives and that was it. You, you seemed happy.”
“I’m trying to! You ain’t making it very easy,” Dean said, laughing and rolling his eyes good naturedly.
Instead of any of the things Cas had rehearsed, things that would have made Cas sound cool or smooth or like a normal fucking human being, Cas opened with “Hello Dean, you look bad.”
Sam scrunches his face up, but before he has a chance to point out his brother’s hypocrisy, Dean cuts him off. “What can I say, man. Christine McVie is awesome.”
They walk over to what is a very homemade but heartfelt tribute to the Star Trek Experience. A few behind-the-scenes pictures, taken with someone’s cheap personal camera and blown up large enough that the details have started to get a little blurry; an old Quark’s Bar menu selling food like “The Wrap of Khan”; attraction tickets, receipts, and other small things; and a plaque that looks like it was made at a local trophy shop. Dean squints down at the closing date -- September 1st, 2008 -- and laughs quietly, bitter but honestly also kind of amused.
and keeps replying with things like “Yes, Dean, my hole is very popular” only encourages him to double down. Sam’s disapproving “I can’t believe I’m related to you
When Dean moves in with Cas it happens with straightforward simplicity, a whim that’s somehow solid and true instead of flippant and unconsidered. They’re at Cas’ as usual -- Bobby’s house is fine and Castiel does spend time with Dean over there, but they’ve found that trying to get hot and heavy in the same twin bed Dean’s slept in on and off since puberty is sort of a mood killer -- watching TV when the image on the screen wobbles a little and then goes black.
, Sam.” Dean only has to think about Sam’s adventures in civilian life for half a second to come up with about a million questions. “How did you even get a job? You don’t have a work history.”
So, yeah, maybe Dean took them to Waffle House a little more often than a good boyfriend would have. But Lisa would just smile tightly and order coffee and read while Dean inhaled pancakes and eggs and sausage and bacon and it was okay, Dean thought.
They’ve been on the road for a couple of hours, gas station breakfast balanced half eaten on Dean’s thigh. He’s fiddling with the tape deck and trying not to knock the thing that’s supposed to be a sausage biscuit down into the footwell, so it takes a moment for him to process what the hell Cas has just said. When he swivels his head around to fix Castiel with a stare, the backseat is already empty and he can see the distinctive shape of Cas’ trenchcoat crouched at the side of the road.
“Hey, how’re you going to remember which -- what is this? A dryer? -- it’s under?” Dean slaps a hand on the hot rusty hunk of metal he’s definitely going to ask Cas to roll over onto the filled in hole.
an eagle, its head featherless and covered in wrinkly pink and yellow skin that looks surprisingly soft. Shiny black feathers bloom abruptly from the base of the bird’s long bare neck and cover the rest of its body, like an old woman wrapped in a huge black fur coat. Simply put, Dean is looking at an absolutely enormous vulture.
“What? No I don’t!” Dean feels himself get a little warm, and it’s definitely not because of the coffee. The nasty, cold-as-shit coffee.
black, but they’re also a deep sapphire blue and emerald green and amethyst and even a deep bronze-y gold. “It’s an oil slick,” Dean says quietly to himself as he absentmindedly reaches a hand toward the wing in front of him. Castiel’s wings are the same color as the black rainbows in parking lot puddles that used to delight Dean when he was a kid, and they seem just as fluid too.
It would be nice to feel like this all the time, wouldn’t it? To come home after a hard hunt to a house with a shower and towels and soap and clean carpet you can stand on without worry. What a thought. To do what you like -- save people, be helpful, be useful -- and still get to sleep the night in your own bed...
Castiel smiles, an honest to god toothy smile, all pink gums and wrinkled nose, a smile Dean is absolutely sure he’s never seen on that face before. Cas, who usually stays somewhere in the zero-to-two range, has cranked it all the way up to eleven and it’s radiant.
Castiel immediately stops the quiet, barely there humming, but it takes him a few attempts to convince the hand that’s tapping and rubbing open-palmed on the back of the other to stop.
“As I have explained to you before, Dean, this vessel is anatomically complete. I don’t understand why you continue to think otherwise.” Cas' deep voice carries a patient confusion that makes him sound like an exasperated teacher explaining a simple concept to a small child for the tenth time. Dean, clearly, is the child here.
And anyway, there’s something else going on with Cas that Dean’s trying to figure out. He keeps... disappearing. It’s not suspicious so much as odd. The house is not large -- just about 1000 square feet -- so it’s not as if Dean’s losing Cas in the endless halls of some enormous mansion they share together. And Cas is never gone for long, just five or ten minutes at a time a few times a day. Castiel seems to be simply (strangely) going into another room for the sake of being in that other room, and then coming back out like nothing happened. It’s weird, but frankly so is Cas. It’s when he finally does this in the middle of telling Dean about his crappy day at work -- in the middle of a sentence, even -- that Dean finally has to ask.
“Hmm? Oh uh, it’s just easier if you’re not an angel.” Dean’s not really paying attention to what he’s saying, too busy digging through one pocket and then another looking for his keys. When he gets the trunk open and looks over at Cas, he thinks the guy almost looks hurt and does a quick replay. Ah shit. “Hey no, Cas, what I meant was, Conrad’s a weird dude and I don’t really want to have to deal with whatever’s gonna pop loose in his head when he learns about you guys.”
Dean faces front and hmm. Castiel is inexplicably dressed in a suit and tie, everything a little baggy and wrinkled, the tie loosely knotted and, oh wow it’s even backwards. Dean clears his throat in lieu of saying anything, starts to bring his hands up in a quickly suppressed desire to tighten the tie and fix the skewed collar of Cas’ dress shirt. Cas just looks back and forth, down at himself and then at Dean who’s wearing the Winchester standard of jeans and flannel.
When Dean wakes it’s because something is tickling his face. It’s not the kind of tickle that jolts him out of sleep, worried a bug is on him or that Sam is pulling some prank like he’s 12 years old again, but the soft kind that’s more confusing than alarming. It’s also the kind of sleep -- heavy and watery and unsatisfying -- that comes from having drunk way too much the night before, even for Dean. It’s the kind of sleep you swim up through, the surface always further away than you expect and harder to keep your head above than really makes sense. When Dean finally gets his eyes open, it takes a few slow blinks before he can focus on whatever it is that’s been brushing up against his nose: Castiel’s tie. And --
still waiting for someone, and no he doesn’t want to order any food yet. Cas waves at Dean and feels his stomach do a warm little flip when Dean’s face brightens. On his way over to the booth Dean catches sight of the blonde and his face brightens even more, big grin returning her laughter at seeing him, and the feeling in Castiel’s stomach turns sour. It’s alright, he reminds himself, this isn’t a date. Dean probably wants to date
Dressed in clean sweats and with a head of hair that’s now dark because it’s wet instead of oily, Cas walks stiffly over to the couch and sits down in the same place he’d been before. There’s a different blanket there now and Cas can tell Dean has fluffed up and rearranged the pillows to fix up the nest that had deflated over the last few days. At first he sits awkwardly, holding his body in the exact position it hits the sofa, regardless of whether it’s comfortable, but after a minute or two he pulls his legs up onto the couch and balls himself up tight, nestled in the pillows. Meatball returns from wherever she’d retreated while Cas was gone.
“Yes. And you would have too if you’d bothered to show up before tonight.” Dean doesn’t have a response for this. “Castiel is a friend of mine.”
After a barely considered glace and a brush off that no, there isn’t a telephone for customers, the guy falters a bit, offers an obliging “Oh, alright,” and turns around to leave. Whatever made this guy walk into a crowded bar that he clearly didn’t want to be in must have been at least somewhat important, right? Enough that he shouldn’t just give up and leave at the slightest rebuff like that. When Dean abruptly decides to go out after the guy, Balthazar doesn’t even skip a beat before turning to chat up the next nearest person.
. There’s a dark-haired man wearing only a cowboy hat on the cover and Cas is sure Dean would enjoy reading it, but he’s not sure Dean knows that Cas knows that Dean would enjoy it. It’s not that Cas has been deliberately prying into Dean’s sexual fantasies, but there
“No, it’s… I think the reason he’s interested in all this true crime stuff is because so much of it depends on the edges. People who live on the edges, or feel like they do -- Sam felt it more than I did, that separation from how other people lived -- those are the people who get killed or do the killing, ya know? And the places. Truck stops, shitty motels, little nowheres that no one goes to on purpose unless they don’t want to be found. Places where you won’t be remembered when you disappear, because the people who spend time there make it their business not to remember, not to have seen enough in the first place to have anything
-- Everything I wrote about the Star Trek Experience is true and accurate. It was AMAZING and I’m genuinely bummed that Dean never got to visit it.
“I don’t understand,” Cas says quietly, seeming to not want to interrupt the conversation but also unable to piece together what’s going on.
Dean’s mouth forms an O as he leaps up off the couch and runs into the bedroom, enthusiasm not so much exaggerated as entirely unrestrained. Castiel laughs and follows him in.
“You’re kidding me. Why would you---” Dean throws his head back, realization hitting him. “You burned all the IDs too didn’t you.”
“Dean,” she said gently. “If you aren’t ready to move in, that’s okay. It’s okay to take some time and make sure this is what you really want.”
Lisa stood and leaned into him, their foreheads pressed together and their breath mingling, before she kissed his cheek.
Dean’s eyes crinkled with laughter and Cas could sense the smile hidden behind the hand Dean was rubbing down his face. “Cas, you are somethin’ else.” When Dean looked back at Cas, his green eyes were sparkling. “No man, I mean, do you want to go somewhere with me?” The laughter had subsided but the glow was still there on Dean’s face. “Do you want to go to dinner tonight?”
God, now he has to actually shower. After some jerky back-and-forth hesitation, Cas turns the water on and strips, the movements fluid and quick so he doesn’t have time to stop halfway through and get stuck in thought. When he steps out of the bathroom to toss the grimy, body-warm clothes onto the pile of laundry next to the bed, Cas can hear Dean puttering around in the kitchen and a slow wave of shame runs through him. Back in the bathroom, Cas stands in front of the roaring shower, his dislike for wasting water keeping the pause to just a few seconds before he steps inside. Humming sounds rhythmically in the back of his throat, low and quiet and self-soothing, as he moves forward and back into the spray of the shower, slowly inching more and more of himself under the showerhead. The water is nice and warm, but the feel of it raining down on his skin is too intense for Cas to just douse himself in the stream; it always takes about 30 seconds to get himself fully immersed. As with brushing his teeth, once the process of showering begins Cas is fine, going through everything step-by-step in the same order as always. And as always, when he’s done he feels better and grumbles at himself for having put it off in the first place.
Cas hadn't left his chambers for three days after Dean's betrayal. How could he have been so foolish? The rebel used him to get in at the castle. The cold clink of the shackles echoed through his mind. The faux pain in Dean's eyes. Everything about Dean haunted him. Luckily he'd be free of him today. Cas had told Cain he wanted to wait for the execution, and Cas agreed to stay. Cas didn't want Dean to die, but he felt like seeing him executed would give him some sort of twisted closure. He wiped his face free of tears and mucus when his door creaked open.
Dean shrugged his shoulders. "Not much. My dad used to tell us stories about Eastden's legendary warrior kings."
"Wouldn't I though? With him gone, there's no one to soothe my anger. Except for you." He sliced through Dean's shirt. "It's such a pity, really. Such a short life wasted. He bled to death on the floor as he begged for his bastard son."
Dean squinted as he was brought out in the sunlight. He knew his brother Sam and his lieutenant Gabriel were hiding in the crowd somewhere, looking for one last weakness to save Dean, but after seeing the pain in Cas's angelic face, he felt like he deserved to die. He scanned the seats for the prince, hoping he could see him one last time. His face turned sour when he saw Cas seated next to an older man. Why was he smiling and laughing with that man? Why was Cas placing his soft delicate hands on that man's shoulder? Had he forgot Dean that easily? Dean looked closer; Cas's hair was disheveled, more than it normally was. He had probably stayed in bed too long or stayed in bed with someone too long. A low growl rumbled from his throat. Cas's normally clean shaven face had grown stubble along his soft jawline. He had been in bed for a few days, perhaps with that older gentleman. Cas wouldn't do that so soon after Dean, would he? Dean looked away from the prince when those deep longing eyes pierced through his soul. He didn't want to accept that Cas was happy with him; he couldn't. He shook his head. Why did he care what or who Casa did? He had only been using him as a way into the castle. Why, then, did he feel so angry at the thought of another man's hands on Castiel?
Cain's eyes narrowed and swung the knife down towards his chest, but Dean grabbed Cain's wrist with his freed hand. He snapped it back and sat up. His body pulled the flayed muscles and skin together, healing itself like it was a minor cut. "Where is Cas?"
Rowena frowned and pushed her eyebrows together, “What do you mean? Of course there are. Demons and devils can take over you despite your willingness.”
Cas pulled away from Cain. He was just using him as a means to an end. All Cain wanted was an heir, and he was going to force Cas into this unless Cas had pressed him about it. He looked to the chalice, then down at his hands. Did he even want children? His mind raced as the thought of having a child, Dean's child -- Dean's child. He grinned wide; what better way to get back at Cain for using him for an heir than to not even have HIS heir. "I want to do this, Cain. I'm ready."
Dean smiled until he noticed how Castiel ignored Henry. He shifted Henry's weight on his hip, cupping Cas's cheek. "Feeling alright? You look a little pale."
“Just do it, Rowena. I have to help Cas, and I want to do it right. We’ll only have one shot at this because once Noctis knows we’re out for his head, he’ll hurt Cas. God knows what will happen.” His eyes fell to his boots as he shook with fear. “I can’t lose him, not after everything we’ve been through.”
Cain smirked as Cas undressed. "Are you finally ready to consummate our marriage? Make it official?" He teased and took off his own shirt.
"Do you think I'm using you?" Cain asked softly and opened the castle door for Cas as they reached it.
"How would that look? The virgin prince alone in his chambers with the rebel leader; how on earth would you explain that?" Dean grinned and looked towards the balcony door then back to Cas's bed. "Can't have a dirty peasant traitor deflower the prince. No, no, no. It'd ruin Michael's plans for you."
"You've been gone for four months, four long months." Dean stroked his hair gently as they laid in bed. He told Cas what had happened, what Amara had done, why Dean went along with her. Cas wanted to rush and leave the castle, but Dean reasoned him to wait until morning. Amara really seemed to want the best for Cas, and he should confront her instead of running away. Cas begrudgingly agreed and made himself comfortable on Dean's chest. He knew Dean was right. Besides, he had to show Amara his "appreciation" for stealing four months of his life with Dean. She wouldn't forget what she did, Cas would make sure of that.
Cas shook his head. "No, he's not gone." His knees buckled under him and he grabbed the edge of the stone alter. He pressed his back against the cold stone and sobbed, his body shaking violently. After what felt like hours, Cas calmed himself down, stood up from the floor, and grabbed his shirt from the table. "I can't stay here Rowena. Not after this.
Cas smiled slightly. Dean was nervous too; he was still uneasy, but Cas pushed through those feelings and pushed Dean onto his back. "Pull them down, Dean." he whispered against Dean's ear and brushed through Dean's hair.
"No one will know, only us." He pleaded, kissing along Cas's slender neck. "Please, Cas. I just want you. You've been flaunting yourself in front of me all day. You're all that's on my mind."
Cole smirked and passed by Dean. "I normally don't go for men, but I'd make an exception for that piece. He'd be whimpering for more when I got through with him."
This is a bonus chapter for you guys who followed the story from the beginning. Even for those who are reading this in the future. I promised this chapter to make up for being late posting chapter 8.
Dean grinned in amusement at the way the prince sneered Michael's name. "I take it you don't think he should rule?"
Cas tilted his hand away, grabbing Dean shoulder's. "Because I have to Dean." He moaned softly as Dean raked his lips over Cas's neck.
Hannah brought a large bowl filled to the brim with a hearty stew along with a few pieces of bread and a cup of tea. She sat the tray across Cas's lap. "Please call me back if you need anything else, sir." She bowed to them and left the couple alone again.
Cas looked at her hand. Would he need her protection? She seemed to know more about the Eastden history than she would need to if she was only lying. He nodded finally and took her hand. “Okay, I accept.”
Dean kept his eyes on the piece of stale bread he had picked up. Cas was willing to risk everything for him, and all Dean wanted to do was use him as long as he could. Was he no better than Michael? “Why do you want to do that, Cas? You’ve got your whole life ahead of you, and you’re risking your neck to help me? I just don’t understand.”
Dean's eyes narrowed as the two kissed; he was cold, devoid, desolate - everything Castiel wasn't, even on his worst days. He held Henry away from the man, forcing a smile on his face. "I believe it will, Castiel. Now, we're supposed to start soon. I'm going to give Henry to Jess before we go. Wait for me?" Cas nodded, idly waiting at the door for Dean to return. Dean walked inside the chapel, finding Jessica sitting with Sam and Madison. He handed Henry to his brother, looking anxiously at the entryway. "something's wrong with Castiel. that's his body, but that is not Cas."
Cas watches the “typing” icon that appears and disappears next to Dean’s name several times over the course of the next minute.
Lisa looked up from her book -- Cas had completely forgotten she was there, he was so focused on Dean -- and noticed that Dean had a lot of plates in front of him. “Dean, how many eggs did you order? Oh,” she gestured at the egg-in-a-hole, “What’s that?”
Dean groans and sways a little while Sam thanks Cas for the ride, then walks over to the kitchen sink and turns the tap to test that not only is there water, there’s
Sam sidesteps a group of little old ladies that’s gathered around another little old lady who’s pumping dollar bills into a video poker machine at an alarming rate. “I should probably do something about my IDs. There’s a copy shop a couple miles away that I saw while we were driving in.”
Dean chuckled, the sound of it mixing with the scrape of his knife on the plate as he tried to get every last bit of yolk. “You’re kinda weird, you know that?”
“Cas, Buddy, that guy’s just hawking kitchen appliances. Those people are all being paid to be there and act like whatever’s in front of them is the best thing they’ve ever eaten. It’s a commercial.”
“Yeah alright, whatever.” Sam is so over this shit, which means Dean isn’t going to drop it any time soon. “So who’s the room under?”
consistent, is that the world is no longer about to end. That there isn’t a steady stream of big bads we have to fight. That we can breathe and relax and, and do what we want. So if Cas
“Hmm,” Cas says, tilting his head a bit at the TV, like it’ll see his confusion and helpfully explain what’s going on.
“Oh the buffets...” From the corner of his eye Dean can see just how uncomfortable his food moans -- they're sex noises, let’s be honest -- are making Sam. Dean cranks them up even further.
A few minutes later everything’s been stowed away (including Cas’ wings), the room’s been swept one last time, and it’s time to head out. Cas climbs in the back and, pleased and a little surprised, Dean doesn’t say anything. 20 miles later, as I-15 winds north into the desolate Nevada desert, Dean finally lets himself look back to see if Cas is still with them. Dean warms when he sees shining blue eyes looking back at him in the rearview mirror.
Dean spoke slowly. “You thought I came in here week after week to play a game with you. About eggs.”
brand of beef jerky with a poorly drawn eagle on the package that Dean hadn’t thought about in years. He buys it all.
Dean licks his lips and peels his eyes away from Cas and over toward the hallway, making sure Sam’s still in the kitchen or wherever it is he went off to, and then looks back at the angel standing awkwardly before him. Silently, Dean pulls the
“Look, Cas, I didn’t come here just to eat,” Dean said, leaning forward and running a hand through his hair. “I really gotta apologize about last time, man. That shit was not cool. I lost it and I took a lot of my shit out on you, and” at this point Dean’s lips twitched into a small smile “the
has other things to worry about. Like how he just shit himself at work because some guy fucking disappeared into thin air.”
Dean walked toward Cas, meeting him halfway. Standing this close, finally without a counter between them, Cas had to tilt his head up a little to meet Dean’s eyes. The two men just stood there for a moment enjoying the closeness, Cas’ mind empty for once until a single thought -- “oh, freckles” -- drifted through it.
) just to grab it, but alas. No ostrich eggs either or emu eggs or quail eggs or -- hmm, platypus and echidnas lay eggs despite being mammals. Cas wondered if the eggs were edible; he’d have to google that later.
together. At some point early on Cas asks “Are we dating?” and Dean splutters out a “Do you want to be dating?” and Cas says yes and so they are, simple as that. Cas visits Dean at the garage, meets Bobby, learns that Dean’s been living with him in the big house at the back of the salvage yard since his last relationship ended (learns
For a brief moment the two men just stare at each other, Castiel trying to figure out how he can possibly improve Dean’s day without access to pie. Maybe he could send Dean back in time to the Old West again; Dean had been very excited about that last time. Or they could get ejected from another den of iniquity. That had been fun for Dean (though frankly terrifying for Cas). No, these plans are too elaborate and one of them includes the risk of reintroducing smallpox to the 21st century. Cas wants something simple, a small gesture that will seem like a grand one for just the right man.
does and not because Sam has suddenly stopped being the feelings guy, but as he finishes up his story he’s grateful either way. “Anyway I missed you and it was weird seeing you like that, like… not you. I’m glad you’re back.”
Castiel’s moans deepen into something Dean finally recognizes as Enochian, quiet indecipherable murmurs between Cas’ endearingly small kisses. Dean pulls away to shift himself into a more comfortable position, still laying across Cas’ lap while Cas curls down over him. Looking up at the other man, Dean expects words to pass between them -- questions, reassurances, whatever -- but instead Cas just dives back in for more of what he’d been doing before.
“He keeps repeating it over and over but in different ways and, well, it’s about you, Dean. And Cas.”
Castiel reappears in a slightly different spot in the convenience store and finds himself facing a refrigerator full of processed meat and processed cheese and (unprocessed) eggs. Dean is very enthusiastic about breakfast, both preparing it and eating it, and Cas knows eggs are considered to be a traditional breakfast food, so he figures Dean would like some eggs. He knows you’re supposed to squeeze certain fruits to check that they’re fresh and ripe (some are supposed to be hard and not soft, others soft but not too soft) and thinks maybe you do that with eggs as well. Castiel pulls out a carton, opens it, grabs an egg, and learns that you do not in fact squeeze eggs to find out if they’re good.
The sounds of the Impala, the halting breath of one brother working his way through a quiet nightmare, the rhythmic late-night shuffle through staticky TV channels because the other can’t sleep. These are the things the Winchesters have learned to sleep through during a lifetime on the road. It’s the smaller sounds that can only come from something intruding in the dark of night that have them clutching for the butt of a gun or the grip of a knife. At first the rustle of feathers was on that list, but it hasn’t been for a while now.
Andy and Ash arrive shortly after and make a beeline for the snacks, and by the time the last guy shows up everyone’s made themselves comfortable on the big wraparound couch in the living room. Except for Cas, who’s sitting cross-legged on the floor and is already on step two of getting Charlie’s notoriously shy cat to come sit with him. He’s just about got the cat up to step three (very cautiously sniffing the hand) when the footfalls of someone in heavy boots scare the cat all the way back to zero.
On the ground, the condor is apparently not impressed at all by what it’s just seen. It flaps its wings a few times and clumsily lifts itself up into the air, drifting up and away from the three men with slow, lazy wingbeats.
“Really though, I want to go see things. About your life growing up, I know it wasn’t always pleasant but in some ways, being on the road, having that freedom, it sounds like it was wonderful.”
The bark of laughter that explodes out of Dean is short and sharp, and though he clamps down on the sound, his face never returns back to the dejected state it had been in. Dean’s eyes twinkle for the first time that night. “Cas, buddy,
“Uh, yes,” he said, uncertainly. “You know, just like you like them…” Cas trailed off as Dean stood, his whole body shaking with anger. He was so angry he felt like he wasn’t even really in his body.
“Dean Winchester, nice to meet you.” Dean sticks his hand out for Cas to shake, which he does but only briefly before fishing his phone out of his pocket with unexpected urgency.
Dean chokes on the mouthful of water he’d just gulped down and looks over at Cas, then down at the menu in front of him. That’s when he realizes that while yes, Cas is a weird dude who
Dean stays up all night, reads the whole thing straight through. It’s got to be close to five in the morning when he finishes, sitting alone on the couch, the heavy breathing of deep sleep coming in from the other room. The book was good -- great, even. Sam’s good at what he does, Dean knew he would be, and feels the pride that’s always there swell a little in his chest. But there’s a sadness there, and worry too, curled up alongside it. It doesn’t have an uplifting subject matter, Sam’s book, but that’s not really what’s gotten to Dean. It’s the understanding -- really, for the first time -- of how easily they could have faded away, in any number of ways, and not been missed.
Castiel’s eyes are screwed tight and it takes a moment for him to work the grimace off his face. When he does finally get his eyes open, he sees a very worried Dean looking up at him.
Louder, now. And Castiel thought that he could hear a voice outside the door, calling out. He squinted open his eyes again, and looked across at Dean.
“You took it out. What would you do that for,” Dean says. When Castiel doesn’t reply, he reaches out and puts a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “Hey,” he says, the word harsh enough to compensate for the touch.
about it. Dean hadn’t fallen asleep in Castiel’s room for years, not since they were both still in college. And over the past several months, they’d barely even spoken to each other.
the law. He was innocent but he was going to be found guilty, without the evidence I gave him and his defence team.”
Dean walked slightly ahead of him, and Castiel matched the even pace of his footsteps. He looked calm, but when Castiel glanced down at Dean’s hands, he saw that they were held in loose fists. Dean was ready for something.
Now, standing in front of forest workers and lawyers and Dean, sweat dripped down Castiel’s brow. The scream in his bones was unbearable, all-encompassing, and he was handling it by the barest of margins, with only the knowledge that he just had to get through this part, and then he could give the worst of it back to Jess, seeing him through. He had to believe he could stand it because he
The rest of the party was a slow-moving torture. He only caught Dean’s eyes once more, during the evening. And Dean looked away too fast for it to matter.
Dean snorted at that, he couldn’t help himself. And once he’d started, somehow he couldn’t quite stop laughing – he tried to suppress it, but he found himself grinning, and when he tried to speak he found he couldn’t immediately get the words out. Castiel didn’t know about the chilis. Castiel thought that – Castiel actually thought that
Castiel stared down at the screen. He couldn’t tell if the tone was judgemental or vulnerable. He blinked, and thought hard – and then, with a little shake of his head and hard press of his lips, he made a choice.
“If you’re going to upset your brother or if it’s upsetting for you yourself to do this, let’s not,” Castiel carried on, when Dean didn’t reply. “It’s probably a terrible idea. I don’t know anything about this place. I only said anything at all about it last night because I’ve read a few fantasy novels and I was reminded of them for a moment. Just one moment. It was throwaway. It didn’t mean anything.”
“I… yeah,” Dean said, his tone a little hollow. “But Cas, I don’t know if that’s going to work, ‘cause –”
“Dean, if you’re not ready - maybe I can still get them to stop the -” Cas said, sounding concerned.
“Huh?” Dean said, leaning closer still, but Cas lifted his head a little and made the extra effort to hear unnecessary. He looked flushed, and his eyes were downcast.
Mary walked forward. She picked up the newspaper on the table, and held it loosely in one hand. She was perfectly steady.
That was – well, it wasn’t that strange on Dean’s personal spectrum of strange to not strange these days. Fighting Death and God and God’s sister and all the rest of it kind of put a bunch of other strange crap way down the list. But this was still… weird. Not bad weird, necessarily.
Dean sang. He looked out at Cas, who was still watching Dean; beside him, Hannah was also staring over at him and looking impressed, while Charlie was nowhere to be seen and Jody was on her phone.
He was silent for several seconds. On instinct more than anything, Dean stayed quiet, let him think it through; when Cas did speak, it was with precision.
Castiel lifted up his head. He met Dean’s eyes. Something unspoken passed between them, some acknowledgement that the moments of eye contact and occasional touches had been equally felt, had meant the same thing.
His bed smelled like himself, now, instead of musty sheets. He rolled over and pressed his face into the pillow, pulling the covers tight around him. His skin wanted to be touched. He thought of Dean, and it was enough to lull him back into sleep.
Dean’s head was bursting with him. When they’d said goodbye, Cas had smiled at him like… God, were there words for a feeling like that? Or was it something you only understood if you’d felt it?
Briefly, a memory flashed through his mind. Bobby, reminding him that he’d never wanted to be a mechanic forever. He pushed that thought away, though. He couldn’t quit his job. He needed his job. He needed to pay bills. One day, not too far away, the magic of Cas being here was going to end, the spell would lift, and he’d have to go back to worrying about the grocery shopping and whether he had enough time to do laundry and if he was going to have one or two too many drinks at The Refuge.
Back at the house, Dean first helped Castiel take down the wards all around the house. It was surprisingly quick and undramatic, this time. No chasing shadows, no haunting laughter, no rising sense of confusion and fear. Just ceramics and garlic and mirrors, laid out in a clumsy stack on the ground beside the porch.
The words hung in the air between them, awkwardly spoken, clumsy, embarrassing. Castiel stared at him.
“Maybe I can get you a drink to apologise?” Sam turned towards the kitchen. “I think I saw they had –”
“I came to talk to you,” she said, “because, well. Firstly, I’ve been waiting for, like, a few days now to hear that Dean’s whole royal engagement thing has been broken off, and I haven’t heard anything, and I was starting to worry you guys thought that the whole thing somehow hadn’t counted because you were drunk, or whatever?”
“Oh,” Dean said. “Right.” Castiel couldn’t get a read on his expression. He didn’t look angry, at least.
“What movie was it?” Ash asked. “No, wait – both say it at once.” Castiel couldn’t help his eyes sliding to Dean’s across the car as it hummed along the highway to the airport. What had he been thrown into? What movies even were there? Dean looked just as wide-eyed, and Ash was already starting the countdown. “Three, two, one…”
“I am standing up straight,” grumbled a voice from the stage, and Dean felt his heart give a little flip. There was Cas - or rather, there was Castiel, because he was in full feathered mask, his eyes concealed behind the black mesh. He looked magnificent and beautiful and kind of spooky, but the slightly petulant defiance of what he’d said took the edge off, made him familiar.
badly. What he wanted, actually, was to be eighteen months deep into a relationship with Castiel that felt rock solid and to be able to look back on tonight and reminisce about their first date being this one.
“Glitter’s okay,” Dean said, “I’ve done glitter.” He sought for some humour. “Just don’t tweeze my brows, I’ve heard that hurts.”
But that memory of walking through the forest. It felt like silence, and then a relieved breath out.
Dean held his head up for a long moment, trying to keep himself together, keep it all in, be still, be silent. He gritted his teeth against the feeling in his chest, against the blazing of his happiness –
He slid into his row, muttering apologies on autopilot and wondering if anything he was saying sounded remotely like English. The world seemed to have shrunk, somehow, so that he could just see what was right in front of him, and he took his seat with his heart thudding in his throat.
Dean lifted his hands as though in surrender. The waiter swooped past, and Dean ordered the check; Cas patted his pockets, but Dean forestalled him.
“Don’t worry,” Cas said, coming to his rescue, “I actually... completely agree with you. I don’t think he understands all that, either.” He swallowed visibly, Dean’s eyes dipping to watch his throat move. “Probably he just thinks that love only gets real and deep when it ends. And he’s mixing up the feeling of having someone walk away with the feeling of experiencing meaningful love. And he doesn’t have a clue how real it could get in the beginning, if he really felt what he thought he was feeling.”
Castiel stopped staring down at his hands, and looked at Dean instead. His blue eyes searched Dean’s face. Under his gaze, Dean smiled – a smile that grew on his face from a tiny brightness in his eyes until his whole face was alight with it.
After some time, when he was ready, Castiel got out of bed. He began to make himself breakfast. The world felt just a little smaller and kinder and more careful all around him in the way that it could do, sometimes, in the light of a morning after a long night. While he gulped orange juice and waited for his bacon to sizzle into crispness, he kept looking back again on the evening before.
How many times had he stood, quiet, expectant, wanting Dean to be ready, hoping he would be ready, prepared to wait for an eternity until he was? In the span of Castiel’s own lifetime, he’d waited just a blink of an eye. But somehow this blink had been torturously slow. A torture Castiel would have fought to the death before trading.
In the quiet intimacy of Dean’s bedroom, curled up together in his bed, Castiel felt the unfairness of it fill him up until it overspilled and he said, in a murmur,
Castiel lay still, and beside him, Dean slept on. He was just a person, Castiel thought. Just a human being. The gloom of the bedroom left half his face in shadow. There were little lines on his forehead and at the edges of his eyes, barely stencilled in but promises of deeper wrinkles to come. One day Dean would be old. And what then? Who would be lying beside Dean in the morning, when his hair was grey and his bones ached? Who would wake up before dawn and hurt like this over the possibility of holding his hand?
Castiel’s expression shifted into something between immediate exasperation and warmth. Dean grinned at him, and took a sip of his milkshake through the straw. Castiel watched him for a second too long in silence, not responding to the joke, just looking at Dean.
Blearily, he pushed at the left-hand side of a pair of double doors, and walked into Dean’s bedroom. It was all just as he remembered it – the wide windows, the glass door that led out onto the balcony, the guitars on the walls and the shabby posters over the bed. One of them was ripped, a Led Zeppelin one, legacy of Jo Harvelle in year seven. The room as a whole was an odd mix of modern stylings with some decorative hangovers from Dean’s teen years.
Because Dean and Charlie had been due to move in together, had even put a deposit down on a place. It was there, ready for them. They just had to wait until isolation wasn’t so necessary to be able to move in. And so Charlie’s project for Dean was to figure out the interior decoration of their new place.
“Dean,” Castiel said, hearing his voice come out low with the intensity of his arousal. His own cock was so hard that it hurt with wanting to be touched.
like he was feeling something, especially when Dean thought back to their conversation by the hut about things Cas wanted to say about himself… that wasn’t a conversation you usually had with someone when you just wanted to hang out casually, was it? And there again, in that conversation, Dean thought, was that pulling-away, that uncertainty; Cas didn’t feel comfortable enough around Dean, yet, to talk about some things. That was totally natural, though, wasn’t it? After such a short time.
He cleared his throat. That was a bad train of thought. Sam got off work at four, he knew, and usually went straight home, so if Dean called him after his work ended at five, then he’d probably pick up. That would probably be the best time to ring him and ask about Cas, and tell him about - everything.
Cas looked surprised, but nodded, and dropped his hand from Dean’s arm. On legs that were numb, Dean walked up towards the gaudy glitter-covered stage, the microphone already hissing and whining in his hand as he passed the speakers. People were clapping and cheering for him as he went, but he couldn’t hear them properly. He couldn’t feel his fingers. He couldn’t feel his hair. Could he normally feel his hair?
Cas made eye contact with him and smiled, and Dean felt his heart flip. He could have sworn he actually felt it drop and rise in his chest, physical and real.
“But…” Castiel tried to gather his thoughts. “It’s half an hour away. And maybe we should stay in the palace until we know what happened with the pictures, in the end.”
He marched them to the aisle with cookies and cakes and other snacks, and began pulling packets off the shelves.
“I’ll be back,” Dean said, throwing it over his shoulder, careless. He walked down off the porch, and began to head out into the forest.
“Are you sure that’s necessary? I read that you only need to do that if the faintness is caused by low blood pressure,” Cas said, his voice a low rumble. All Dean could see was the denim knees of his jeans and the wood of the stage floor. Everything felt wavy and full of movement and too big, somehow. Cas’ voice was like a rock in the waves.
“And you never doubt their intentions are pure,” Dean replied dryly. The rest of the group were starting to shift uncomfortably.
?” For the first time, Sam sounded less than collected; he sounded slightly delighted. “You liked him?”
There was no thought, no pause, no worry. He stood up. Dean turned to face him fully, his gaze dipping to Castiel’s lips. They reached with hands first, holding onto each other, pulling each other in – insisting on each other, on closeness, on nothing less. Their tightened grips said,
Here, he knew no one. The judges were here to evaluate him. The rest of the singers were his competition. If he was bad, would they still clap him at the end? Would they laugh halfway through?
She caught sight of the tower just as Dean did; walking out onto the Place du Trocadéro, a wide square with an elegant black-and-white floor, they found themselves among a bustling crowd of other tourists gathered to get their snaps and see the view. She and Dean paused, looking over towards the Eiffel Tower and the horizon beyond. The sky was already beginning to paint itself in delicate pinks and oranges, little breaths of softness after the hard and blazing blue of a cloudless day. The metal tower with its latticework made a striking silhouette.
He could make sense of life here, right here. He had to. He stepped smartly over towards the hanging monstrosity, lifted up the key in his hand, and used its edge to saw through the fraying string holding it aloft. Dust huffed off its length as he worked for a few seconds, and then -
“Alright, well. I’ll leave you to your coffee,” Castiel said, still sounding far too chirpy, and he got up and walked away.
“It’s like,” Dean said, feeling the need to explain himself better, “I’ve read interviews with him because they’re
“Uh, actually, last thing…” Dean gritted his teeth. He’d promised himself he wouldn’t go to dinner with Cas without an answer for him. “Can I bring someone over for Christmas?”
“Well,” he said aloud, “you’ll definitely screw up our marriage if you do.” He offered Dean a very small, dry smile, and Dean caught his eye and managed a laugh.
Castiel moved further into the house, finding himself treading lightly as though not wanting to disturb though he knew no one was here. He passed the door to the kitchen first and peeked inside; at least it looked as though it had a fridge and a stove that seemed modern enough. The round, scrubbed wooden table had two comfortable-looking chairs beside it. No coffee maker, though, he thought. And here, again, was another one of those ugly hanging things. Even more silver on this one. Less garlic, but still some. He eyed it distastefully. It probably had bugs living in it. Or bacteria.
“You’re beautiful,” Castiel said softly. “You’re so beautiful.” He leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Dean’s upper thigh, breathing in. He felt Dean’s hand on the top of his head, pushing gently into his hair. “I want you so much.” Another kiss, now just to the side of Dean’s cock, against the curling hairs there. The sensation against Castiel’s lips made his whole body ache with want.
They were silent for a long time. Castiel thought about the Hunter. Thought about how he worried over getting his suit fixed, got his insulin from a dealer, seemed to live a cheaper and harder life than Castiel did. He wondered how much of the Hunter’s existence was given over to trying to make things right in the Underlight. He wondered how much of his own was, really. He felt as though he was doing his best, but it couldn’t be enough, because it wasn’t fixed. Everything down here was still so, so broken.
he thought. What was he supposed to say? Confess his feelings, now of all times? Dean was getting married to Lisa. Dean
“No,” Dean said. “I’m bi.” The stranger nodded. And there, in front of the Eiffel Tower at sunset, Dean had the least stressful coming-out he’d ever experienced in his entire life.
, his heart said, and it crushed in his chest, so wonderfully painful and embarrassing and stupid and exciting. The first notes kicked in, and Dean took a breath.
“Dean, why… six in the… why? You know I live right by school ‘n’ I don’t have to wake up until seven normally…”
Castiel considered. On the one hand, having any of his senses impaired felt like a mistake with a dangerous supernatural creature around. On the other hand, Dean was someone Castiel would quite like to make a mistake with.
“I get it. I have my shit, too, I guess. We have boundaries, man. It’s cool. We can keep those.” Dean cleared his throat. He wasn’t sure whether he was striking the right tone; everything Cas was saying seemed to be pointing towards the fact that he saw some kind of future with Dean, some reason why what they did now might matter later - but he didn’t want to lean too hard into that, or ask about it, and freak Cas out. Freak himself out, too, if he overthought it. “But, like, to get back to the whole point... I was wrong about your music. I gotta tell you. Your song that you sang earlier…”
“Okay,” Cas said, tearing off the mask, his hair ruffled as he threw it down to the floor. “I thought today we could go over some basic mic technique to start with. Maybe some breathing technique, too. It’s one thing knowing the song, but being able to sing it into the mic and have it sound right is a thing on its own, so I thought I could give you some tips.”
Dean turned to walk forwards, feeling as though his heart was ready to burst. He couldn’t drop the smile. There was definitely something happening between them,
“Easier said than done,” Cas commented. He was standing just far enough inside Dean’s space for the conversation to feel intimate, but far enough that they weren’t going to touch; for a moment, a wild thought sprang into flame in Dean’s mind, and he was picturing stepping right up to Cas and sliding his hand through Cas’ hair as Cas pulled him closer, and -
He knew he should go back. Leave the clearing. Tell Dean what happened when he stepped inside, ask him what it meant. But the tree was so close, just ten steps or less, and Castiel knew he wouldn’t want to come back into the clearing again once he’d left it.
Memories flashed through his mind. Dean asking Castiel to marry him in Vegas; the way they’d looked in their wedding pictures; even before that, the months of silence after the announcement of the wedding – Castiel understood them, now.
Castiel took his straw out of Dean’s milkshake, and stuck it back into his own, and took another sip.
“Yeah, I…” He trailed off. He had to give back the wallet, and he knew it. But it was something concrete tying him to Castiel, and he didn’t want to give it up.
Castiel bit his lip. Something about hearing his brother phrase it that way struck at the fresh pain in his chest, the revenant’s pain.
Dean had never heard her sound quite so serious. He made a face at Sam on Skype, who made a face back.
He wasn’t meeting Castiel’s eyes, and Castiel looked away from him down the path he knew they’d take – the one to the right, that led to the lake.
“But… we need to be the same,” Castiel says. He wants them to be close like two leaves on a tree. Closer, two petals on a flower. No, closer still, not even two things. Just one, one plant, growing strong. He wants them that close, that inseparable, after so long being forced apart by fate and circumstance. No would-be gods or divine powers could set them apart if they were one thing. The same.
“Dean,” he managed. And then, like a wave, unstoppable and incomprehensibly huge, came the darkness.
So easy to imagine. So out of reach. Castiel walked on through Seoul, the rain starting to thrum down harder.
At once, the wind rushed into the car. Brown leaves licked up at Castiel's shoes as he stepped out, and the sudden breeze tasted at his hair, pulled at his coat, forced him to squeeze his eyes shut against its cutting touch.
“Go,” he said in a tone of unexpectedly single-minded determination, grabbing for Dean’s arm and half-pulling him towards the window and the outdoors. “Go, go, go!”
Dean wondered for the first time what movie Castiel had booked for them. Castiel had insisted on being the one to pay for the tickets, this time. That made two in a row that Castiel had won on, Dean thought, and made a mental note that on the next date – if there was a next date – he’d make sure to pick up the bill.
God, Dean wanted to kiss Cas. The thought appeared briefly, like a loose spark from a blazing fire. He pushed it away, and then wondered if he had to, and called it back, and then reminded himself that Cas might not actually like him that way anyway so he shouldn’t lean into thoughts like that, and pushed it away again.
Dean’s expression was a mirror for Castiel’s – confusion, horror, each desperately seeking an answer in the other’s face.
It was the first time he’d strung the words together so plainly and for a second, Castiel stopped thinking at all.
“That’s not important,” Castiel said. “Surely this land is protected? They can’t just start chopping down trees?”
With a grunt, Dean went back to his coffee. Eight o’clock in the morning on a Monday. It was too early to talk to anyone in the teachers’ lounge. Especially Castiel.
He strolled across the street, trying not to be too conspicuous. The guests all seemed to have arrived, because thankfully there was no one lingering outside Castiel’s home. The place was lit up by the display that Castiel had arranged in his front yard - a merrily laughing Santa sitting in his sleigh, pulled by his reindeer, with brilliant stars and gleaming Christmas trees surrounding him.
Castiel was lost in his own thoughts. His chest was aching, and at first he thought it was just the usual pain he felt when his dream bubbles popped and he realised he’d never be able to be with Dean – but there was something underneath the hurt, now, something harder, something that tasted bitter.
And then we just… we figure something out… figure it out ourselves. If we tell anyone then it could leak. But if it’s just you and me who know, not even Charlie, not even – not anyone…”
Castiel felt his breath catch, but he tried to maintain composure. He looked straight ahead, and said nothing, watching Dean leave.
Outside the closet, he heard a footfall, and then a dragging sound. And then another. Coming up close to the closet door.
“In your contract,” Castiel said, “that you personally signed in agreement with the Maine Forestry Service, it is clearly mandated that the discovery of any endangered species in the logging area will halt the project, so that the Forest Service can come down and perform a full inspection.”
Until then, he was apparently going to stay in this poky little theatre with its tiered dark seats and its intimate little stage, and he was going to have to deal with that.
That’s the name of the song.” Dean took to the stage, feeling an odd sense of familiarity mixed with total dissociation; this was the place where he sang, where he always sang, and this was also something completely new - singing so that someone else didn’t have to. Singing because there was someone out there in the crowd who he cared about in a way that felt different. Singing with barely any drink in his system, relatively speaking. Singing country, for crying out loud.
Dean’s cooking was delicious. They sat together at the kitchen table and ate, mostly in silence, occasionally making eye contact and appreciative noises.
He could practically hear Gabriel’s crowing when he heard that Castiel had given up on his decision to live in the forest after less than twenty minutes. He could
“You mean… all these parties that I wasn’t invited to,” Dean said. “The Easter breakfast and the Halloween Spook Night and the Carolling last week - you mean, all of them, I was…”
“You can’t seriously think it’s going to be a good plan. This is a drunk at four in the morning plan.”
“Look… I just wanna say, I get what you’re saying, about, like… what if someone comes along in the future who I feel the same way about, only they feel the same way about sex as I do, more or less. But the thing is, like. I’m twenty-nine years old. And the way Cas makes me feel, like… literally has never happened to me before.”
He wasn’t noticing the shape of Dean’s shoulders. Or the way there was a drop of sweat moving slowly down the back of his neck.
Would he ever get to share a morning with Dean? Ever get to lie beside him, knowing that it was exactly where they both wanted to be? That feeling between them, when they were together. The intimacy that they couldn’t control, that was just somehow
“Yes,” Castiel said, having only taken in less than half of what she’d said. The corridor they were standing in was slowly getting brighter as, outside, the clouds burned away under the warm Corelian sun.
“It’s –” Castiel presses his lips together again, trying not to let the expression look pained, even though there’s a flash of hurt through his chest at the thought of trying to say any of it aloud. Saying it would push the two of them, Dean and Castiel, towards a tipping point. A no-takebacks, no room for misunderstanding point. Sharp as a thorn.
Were they still talking about Castiel, or was this about Cas, Dean couldn’t help wondering - not even wondering, because there was no way all that had been about some random singer. Cas looked over at him, something vulnerable in his expression, and Dean smiled at him. “Maybe one day he’ll get it,” he said lightly.
“Guys,” she said, “stopping this kind of thing is what your officials do, right? My mom’s had to deal with royal embargoes on stuff before. If you don’t want the pictures out there, then Castiel’s right. You gotta go to your team about it. They’ll be able to stop it.”
The hustle onto the plane was a blur, diplomatic seals and documents granting them a queue-less path through. Castiel dragged his suitcase, trying to hold up his end of a conversation with Garth and doing a bad job at it. He kept looking over at Dean, trying to figure out a way to speak to him alone, even if it was only for a few minutes.
It was just a house. It was only a house, and this was only a forest, and he was just a person who lived here. Nothing was wrong with that.
“Cas…” Dean said in a low voice. He moved in closer, just ever so slightly. Castiel could see the flush on his skin from the heat in the room.
“Yeah. It is.” Dean’s tone was becoming more belligerent the longer Mary spoke to them with so much poise.
Now, here he was. Married to Dean, but still about to watch Dean get married tomorrow to someone else.
When she reached them, Mary reached out a hand and put it on her eldest son’s cheek. Dean leaned into it, his gaze falling to the floor, a frown on his brow.
Dean waited for more, looking out of the open door. The sea sighed up and down the sands. Castiel paused, and then he said,
Sam had left Central two years ago for Coastal, and what had happened that night with Castiel had been the first time in two years that he'd felt as though he mattered to someone in the city where he lived.
“Oh. Thank you.” Neither of them seemed to be in a rush to leave the car, however. Hannah eyed him from the front seat, waiting for him to get out. Maybe that was just the protocol for a driver, Castiel thought. Maybe he was the only one feeling the grasp of coldness in his throat, the only one half-waiting to see the shadows on the porch start whispering or watch the house windows start to cry red.
“A Ferris Bueller reference in the year of our Lord and Saviour, twenty-nineteen,” she said. “Consider me appeased.”
Castiel sat in the back corner of the sauna, his eyes closed. A towel was slung around his waist. He breathed in the steam.
Dean only realised how rarely he got a follow-up question to the second half rather than the first when it came out of Cas’ mouth; people round where he lived tended to be more the car type than the bookish type, or at least as far as they let on to Dean, and that was okay by him - but it did make a nice change.
“Not that hard,” Dean said, aware that the words could've come out charming if he hadn't been hungover – but instead he sounded irritable and teenagery and didn't care enough to fix it.
He pressed his lips tight shut. His mind was clear and he could breathe, but he knew, now. He knew what was out there. He knew the wretched pale ghoulish face of it. He’d seen it move. He’d seen it look. He’d seen it
Dean wanted to protest - wanted to say that he was pretty sure everyone else inside the house hated him, and he wasn’t really ready to go ahead and try to change their hard-earned opinions of him, and he really only wanted to spend more time out here with Castiel and then maybe find some other place to go together with just the two of them that was maybe kind of warmer and had more food - but he let himself be pulled towards the door. Castiel walked up the couple of steps, Dean in tow. Castiel let go of his hand to open the door, and then stood on the threshold.
They turned their attention to unpacking the contents of the grocery bag, Dean stacking things neatly into the fridge while Castiel made them each some coffee.
Dean started. He jerked round and found Castiel standing there behind him, a little further into his personal space than Dean would have expected – not that he was complaining. Castiel was looking at him with an expression on his face that Dean would've thought was nervousness to match his own, if that hadn't been stupid to even consider.
When he got into the teachers’ lounge, he hurried past the coffee machine and headed over to where Charlie was sitting. She looked up at him, went back to her book, and then did a double-take.
Castiel, who had been making himself some coffee in his kitchen, pulled a face and wandered down his hallway with an empty mug in his hand.
He wanted Dean here now. He wanted to press their foreheads together, teeth gritted, hands wound into each other. He wanted Dean to put his fingertips on Castiel’s own cheek. He wanted…
Cas looked down at the phone and took it, and then glanced up at Dean with a touch of charmed shyness.
“But you know,” Dean added, “you could’ve just appeared right next to me instead of a whole freaking mile away on a slippery sidewalk. That’s all I’m gonna say.”
“Is that a surprise?” Cas said, his tone dry but not unkind. Dean swallowed, and managed a smile when he looked back over.
“No, I… it’s okay.” Dean cleared his throat. “It’s good. I… yeah, it’s good, you can…” He managed a laugh. “Sorry, I’m a mess.”
That's all I can really say about That. I hope you enjoyed the chapter and I'll see y'all next week! Sending lots of good wishes to you out there. <3
enough. Maybe around three percent of enough, on a good day with a fair wind. Cas, in full view of everyone, could only talk with his eyes as Balthazar congratulated everyone who had taken part; those eyes seemed to be saying a lot of eloquent and complicated things all in one single expression, and Dean couldn’t understand any of them.
And his face was always so soft in sleep. Castiel tilted his head. For a moment, while Dean rested, it felt safe to think it again.
“So…” Cas said. His hands were opening and closing, down by his sides. “Dean, I - I have some things I want to say, but… maybe you want to talk first.” He watched Dean, who blinked back at him. He felt as vacant as a fishbowl without a fish.
Yes. The revenant had been woken from her long dark sleep to take on the pain of the forest. She’d carried it for years, she said. She deserved respite. Someone had to do something. And Castiel was the only someone he was aware of, for miles around.
“You – you know the bit in Megamind,” Dean said instead, while a part of him died at the fact that he was making this reference. “Where, uh, where Roxanne finds out Megamind’s been lying to her all along and she walks away in the rain, and he just lets her go because there’s nothing he can say?”
“I’ll set your things down here on the porch, shall I?” said Hannah, coming up behind him. They glanced down at the fallen mobile. One of the bulbs of garlic had split off and rolled away. “Oh,” they said. “Maybe there are vampires living round here.”
The seconds ticked by in silence; the camera zoomed in tight to Dean’s nervous face. Had he really stood there in awkward, awful silence for this long, or had they edited it to make it worse?
Castiel wasn’t sure he wanted to hear the end of any of those sentences. He stared at Dean, his jaw clenched tight.
“This is covered in the NDA,” Jody interjected. “You can’t share how much of his music is written by him.” Dean repressed the urge to wave her off, instead choosing to nod seriously.
After the market, he and Cas had wandered through the shopping district, stopping everywhere so that Cas could have a look at just about everything. He seemed so out of touch and naive - and then he would point out the saucepans and spatulas in a homeware store, and comment on how the soft non-metal handles would keep hands from getting burns, or something equally low-key and unthinkingly pragmatic. He’d bought a set of jars for his beekeeping, and also a new t-shirt for twelve dollars ninety-nine. He wasn’t some spacey celebrity who never did anything for himself - but Cas also was so surprised and fascinated by so many small things that he never felt fully a part of the normal world. He had his feet so much on the ground, and his head so much in the clouds.
“It’s not cool, man. What, is this supposed to make amends for lying about Sarah? The fact that you were hiding something else, too?”
“Belief,” Castiel said, starting to move away. He didn’t know how much longer Dean would be able to hold them off at the work site. It was a miracle that they hadn’t started already.
“He hates this one,” Hannah said, looking as though they wanted to give some kind of explanation for his behaviour. Jody looked annoyed at Hannah for saying it, but Dean leaned closer.
It was all wrong. His tone was all wrong. It was aggressive, and blunt. He sounded outright angry at the idea that Cas might actually want to go on a date, and that tone didn’t even vaguely map over the ridiculous leap in his chest at the idea of a date together.
When he spoke, Castiel could feel the man’s breath on his own face. It took him a few muzzy seconds to take in what he was saying.
As soon as he sat down in the stretch limousine, Castiel was greeted by a chorus of deep, loud cheers. He winced, eyes still adjusting to the dark interior of the car after the sun’s merciless stare.
“You wanna sit?” Dean managed. Castiel nodded, and sat down on the sofa, the material strange against his bare skin. Dean dropped down next to him to the floor, between Castiel’s legs.
The air quotes that Dean knew well. The ones that he’d seen the Angel of the Underlight using, badly, for months. The way his fingers crooked, exaggerated. The way his tone stressed the words unnecessarily.
something. It can be like a miracle. The miracle of life. Well, you know, uh - robot life. You’re all like… like parents making babies. You have your creativity…” Dean held up a finger. “... And you have your knowledge…” On the other hand, he made a circle with his index finger and thumb. “... And you just gotta…”
might seem simplistic. Not so dense as Dickens. Not so dark as any of the Brontë sisters. Not so unflinching as Hardy. But Jane Austen’s style, her impact, and her narrative choices, impacted English literature in a way very few can lay claim to. Let’s begin with a brief dip into the context of her writing.”
There was a beat of horrified silence. Jody stood up abruptly, her chair falling to the floor behind her with a clatter; Hannah muttered a vicious curse; Cas blanched and looked at Dean as though his worst fears were coming true, and Dean could only gape back at him -
for an hour and called up his brother to talk about meeting up the weekend after, and then went to bed. And he felt so – he didn’t have words for it, he never had the right words. Half of him felt good, and the other half was laughing at himself for even trying, knowing he would never keep it up.
“My honour is being tested,” he said, the words dripping with irony. “Really, though; there’s nothing I can do for you. Except recommend a particularly speedy set of lawyers.” Balthazar plucked a business card from a pile on the counter, and pushed it with a neat little
Thank you for your patience in waiting for this chapter! Things convened and converged in unexpected ways. I was writing right down to the wire for the DCBB deadline and I did make it, so I'm all locked and loaded and ready for art claims (augughhhhhhh). Also I went with my family on our annual beach holiday. The place where we go holds so many memories for me - I've had really good and also really bad experiences there, and I underestimated how hard it'd hit me to be there again. I offer these truths to the void in hopes of assuaging my own bad feelings surrounding not keeping my word about when I'd upload. Dear void, please be gentle. I know I'm a spork.
Quite suddenly, with the door open like a mouth, it was as though all the noise in the forest had been drawn in by its one deep breath. Castiel, used to the sirens and car horns and yells and engine thrums and music and chatter of the city, felt the noiseless moment strike in his chest, as though there were some silent cavity there within him that had been waiting for a fellow hush.
Dean sets down his burger, somehow already half eaten. “Yeah Cas you, uh, you’re kinda describing future you.” Cas tilts his head in question. “I know I said you were more human, but really you were just… human. I don’t think you were an angel anymore, or you had like one percent angel left.” Dean gets quiet, realization hitting him for the first time. “Dude, your wings, they must have been
“Thank you,” Cas says, swallowing the bite down after a minimum of chewing. “You work tomorrow?” he asks after the second bite.
not a good liar and Dean still looks like Cas didn’t give him quite the escape route he was hoping for, so Cas tries again. “Um, maybe we could look at it together. For educational purposes.”
“Well, hell Mildred,” he said, his smile finally twitching into something real. “It doesn't look like your boy over there got the memo. I wanted runny eggs, not scrambled. Maybe tell him that anyone who makes a waffle that delicious should be able to whip up some dang eggs.”
Dean doesn’t say anything, just takes a swig of beer and leans back in his chair looking all manner of unimpressed with God.
The vision after that, though, is another weird one. Or, well, an extremely mundane one, which is exactly what makes it weird. Sam’s a lawyer, Dean’s a mechanic, Castiel owns a coffee shop, and they all live in a town that’s somehow simultaneously Sioux Falls and Lawrence.
Once he’s in the bathroom Cas just stands there, hunched over, hands balled into fists that don’t hang right from the ends of his arms. He takes a long moment, then abruptly picks up his toothbrush. It’s a deliberate action, like he has to tell his body to make the motion; he stands again, just holding it. He’s been meaning to brush his teeth all day, been meaning to shower all week. He’s not a slob, he can smell himself just as well as Dean can, and he knows he’ll feel better once he’s clean. It’s just…
Cas is about to try and lie. Dean is about half a second away from dropping the shovel and bodily interrupting Castiel, but Conrad mercifully catches on and stops Cas from having to complete whatever definitely unbelievable thing he was going to say.
Dean huffs out a breath, but his eyes are full of warmth when he says “I don’t want to make you self-conscious but uh, you’re not as subtle about hiding this as you think.” He thinks back on that first night walking along the road from Rocky’s, the way Cas had fidgeted with his hands then too, at the end of a stressful day. “You do this when you’re stressed. It makes you feel better.” He says it more to himself, like it’s a realization. Mostly because it is.
“Sorry Lis,” he said awkwardly as Mildred left. Damn, she couldn’t take him anywhere, could she? He even managed to make a fool of her in a Waffle House.
s framed and hung on walls; but most of all the occasional views of Cas himself, gazing lovingly at his cat, or with a face frozen in big, wide-mouthed smile at something she’s doing. While the man in front of him seems kind of flat and stiff and uncomfortable, the guy in the pictures is a whole dynamic person. Dean really wants to know the guy in the pictures.
“So,” Dean breaks the silence when he’s finished up with the car. “Is this better or worse than when Lucifer was riding shotgun? As far as traumatizing imagery goes.”
“We don’t have to push it, there’s no case, remember? Nobody’s going to get eaten by a monster just because we stopped for the night.”
Dean reaches over and slides Cas’ beer over to his side of the table where it can add to the warmth that’s already building in his chest. They sit for a while longer, Dean finishing up the basket of fries and downing the second beer. Honestly, Dean would be okay with sitting here for the rest of the day, ordering more food and drinks whenever he feels like it, but the server’s been giving them the stink eye since the moment the last fry disappeared so he figures it’s time to go.
“Are all the monsters and shit gonna disappear? Are we not gonna be hunters? I’ve been there man, with the djinn, and it wasn’t good. We weren’t good.”
“These people, flawed though they may be, are simply seeking distraction from a world that is impartial to their suffering, and also to their happiness. They’re creating their own meaning, as is everyone.” Cas pauses for a moment before continuing. “As are the angels, even. We may have knowledge of a broader context, but with God absent for so long our existence is ultimately just as unguided. I believe, given enough lack of purpose, I could seek comfort in the material.”
Sam’s book, just like every other discussion of his childhood, has deposited a layer onto his understanding of his past. But this time it doesn’t seem to obscure the details, like a swipe of grease on the lens of a projector. Instead it sharpens them, brightens them. Dean doesn’t agree with everything about how Sam views how they grew up, but adding Sam’s perspective to his own doesn’t feel invasive, but illuminating. Two photographs of the same thing, taken from slightly different angles.
brushing his teeth, so he hunches over a little more and mechanically makes himself move all the body parts necessary to get the toothbrush wet and covered in toothpaste. For a moment he falters and stares blankly at the toothbrush before making himself put it in his mouth; he’s stared too long before and had the toothpaste fall off into the sink and reset the whole process and just no, he can’t handle that today. As usual, brushing his teeth goes fine once he manages to start doing it.
“You’d be doing me a favor actually. This,” Dean gestures around the parking lot, “was not my idea.”
“Oh, sure.” Dean pulls up his go-to picture of Baby and hands his phone over to Cas. It’s a full-body shot of the Impala, the long black lines of the car taking up the whole width of the image, Dean leaning up against the front wheel well with crossed arms and a big smile.
Rocky’s Bar is all the way on the other side of Sioux Falls, a squat shoebox of a building in the middle of nowhere a few miles northeast of the city limits. It’s doing pretty well for itself considering it’s at the ass end of one of those roads that start out as a main thoroughfare in town but lose lanes and get noticeably rougher the further out they get into the countryside. Rocky's owner, a woman named Pamela who is somehow both intimidating and friendly, whose honesty is always spoken with a warm smile and a sparkle in her eyes, probably has something to do with it. The fact that the place welcomes everyone except for the types who like to make other people feel
a hunter. Remember when we used to just go around killing monsters? I liked doing that. Yeah, maybe sometimes Dad rode us too hard, but most of the time I was glad to be doing good, helping people, letting them live their lives and not think about the shit
Dean just had to kiss him, had to try and catch that endearing expression with his lips. Cas sighed and melted into his side, sweet like honey as Dean nibbled at his bottom lip. Dean lost himself for a few happy moments, before leaving a few soft kisses on Cas’ cheek and turning his attention to his breakfast.
Splaying his hand out on the menu like he needs to break Cas’ concentration on it and tapping it a couple times, Dean looks back up at Jeanne (who at least appears to be enjoying her shift a bit more now) and asks for a cup of coffee for his friend. Once the three of them are alone, Dean turns to face Cas completely at the same time that Sam leans over the table, hands folded in front of him and eyes wide.
. But it’s gonna be.” Dean sits at the other end of the couch, and for a couple of minutes neither of them say anything. “Are you hungry?”
Behind the toilet paper is a refrigerated case full of milk and water and other water that’s colorful and other painfully colorful liquids that aren’t water, liquids that Cas is sure -- based on the function of warning colors in nature -- must be highly toxic. It seems unsafe to store those next to things intended for human consumption. Oh and there’s also beer. Castiel thinks back to the time he drank an entire liquor store, filters the contents of the case in front of him against the 87 different beers he tried, sorts by cost, flavor, overall value, the weather, accidentally throws a bunch of ERROR!s on the spreadsheet he’s mentally chugging through, cleans them up, and grabs a six-pack. The several-billion-year-old angel who’s just performed instantaneous complex qualitative analysis in his head forgets to close the refrigerator door before he walks away.
Later, after Cas finished what somehow felt like both the longest and shortest shift of his life, he stepped out into the cool evening air and saw a familiar face looking back at him. Dean was leaning up against that sleek black car, arms crossed loosely, worn leather jacket catching the breeze. He waved when he saw Cas, calling out his name in a reversal of the last time they’d been in this parking lot together.
Dean did that chuckle/cringe thing again, but this time Cas could tell it was clearly a chuckle. He suddenly felt warm, and not just because he was standing in front of an industrial flat top griddle that was hot enough to sublimate butter. Coming back from the coffee makers with two thick-walled mugs filled to the brim that threatened to slosh their contents with every step, Cas glanced up and felt a jolt of eye contact with Dean. Quickly darting his eyes back down to the coffee, to his shoes, to Dean’s folded hands, to anywhere not eyes, Cas set the mugs down and twisted them so the handles were facing his customers.
They’ve been on the road for about an hour, Sam in the passenger’s seat manning the old beat up green thermos and handing over cups of hot coffee anytime anyone -- okay,
“Right, well, we did what we always do when we’re trying to find someone. We looked him up online. Or, his books anyway.”
Finally, thank you and I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. It was a nice bit of bittersweet distraction during the last months of 2020, and was a good way for me to get out of my apartment, so to speak.
“So send them back,” Lisa said, still chewing the piece of bacon he always let her steal right off his plate.
Dean steadied his breathing as the cold metal grazed his skin. "Then what happened yesterday? Why didn't you stop Cole?" He frowned and followed Alastair as he walked around the table.
Cas straightened up and tugged his shirt into place. "Of course. I've been waiting for this moment since the day he walked into my room."
Cain looked to Michael as the king seethed with rage. He was impressed with the rebel's abilities. "What was his bounty, Michael?"
Dean sat up from the bed as well. "You know I'd prefer it if you didn't use her magic, Cas. You don't know what it'll do to you. I mean look at what happened to her. She went bat shit insane Cas."
Dean locked their lips together, holding Cas’s hair. He lined his cock up with Cas, “You haven’t been prepped, it’ll hurt a lot baby.”
She walked over to a table near the east window and sat the food down. She took her own seat, pointing to the chair across from her. “Sit dear. You need to eat before we discuss anything.”
Dean had his eyes closed, too focused on Cas's tight, warm hole. He didn't hear Cas's plea at first, but when he heard the loud whimpers, he zoned back into Cas's blue eyes. He chuckled to himself leaned down to kiss the corner of his mouth. "You can cum whenever you need to, sweetheart." He whispered, slamming his hips directly into Cas's prostate. Cas cried out as his body arched against Dean's barrel chest. He felt a hot sticky explosion on his stomach, mouth agape in an 'o', drool pooling from the corner of his mouth. Dean grinned as his stomach was covered in Cas's release, holding Cas's hips steady as he continued to thrust his hips into Cas. He was close himself, but he wanted to last longer. He groaned softly, eyes closed when the door flung open. Dean growled, slightly turning back. "Leave the fucking room."
Noctis flashed his red burning eyes, “You and I both know your brother’s gone. We shouldn’t play this game of roundabout.”
"Dammit Cas, I came here to apologize. I should've listened to you instead of trying it on my own." He watched the slender body disappear under the silk robe. "I don't want us to be so far apart, Cas." He put a hand on his shoulder.
Cas looked over his shoulder with a smirk and got off of Dean. "You can't touch me until you're aching for me." He gulped, surprised with himself with how well he was hiding his nerves. He eyed Dean as he crawled between his legs. "I suppose since I haven't any oil, I'll have to find another way to lubricate." He pushed Dean's legs apart, stroking his soft cock slowly.
Lucifer glanced back to his younger brother. “‘Castiel’s project?’” He raised an eyebrow, “don’t you mean your project?”
She rolled her eyes, “It’s not that simple, Dean. In order to speak with a spirit that old, I’d have to dig deep into my books and histories. It’ll take me some time to locate a spirit old enough to remember her.”
Dean glanced to the would-be thief, genuinely smiling for the first time in four days. "Sam?" He climbed down and hugged his younger brother, "I've missed your musk." He laughed, wiping tears from his eyes.
Dean punched him again, a satisfying crunch as blood poured from Cole's nose. "Some fun, huh? Maybe I should have some fun with you and my knife. How'd you like that?"
Cas wiped his face, chuckling. "Hello Emma, I'm Castiel, Henry's mother." He frowned slightly when she hid in Dean's neck. He looked to Dean, pressing his free hand to Dean's cheek. "You're real... It doesn't feel like it's possible. Cain told me you were dead, that Henry was dead. No one had heard anything about you and him, so I had to believe him."
Dean's ears went scarlet as he heard the man call Cas sweet. "What do you want?" He gritted through his teeth, trying to hide his anger.
Cas sighed and looked away from Dean, "But I don't want to hurt you, or Henry, or Emma." He glanced to his circlet for a split second, then met Dean's curious look. "When we arrived here after you brought me back from Elladonton, you and Cain hid away Amara's crown for several reasons. You thought there was something dark inside of it, and he hid it because he didn't want to admit, I had done something he would never be able to do." He looked down at his hands, picking at his cuticles. "Truth be told, you were right. There was an entity, a dark, ancient deity known as Noctis sealed away in her crown. She drew her power from him."
Dean shook his head, "I should've been here to protect you. I shouldn't have let Cain talk me into leaving."
"I had a kingdom to run. To my knowledge, Amara had stolen you for the sole purpose of torturing me. If I had gone for you, she would have killed me." He started to pour himself another glass of brandy. "She's an evil witch who cares only for herself, Cas. I wouldn't have stood a chance."
A nasally laugh responded to the growl. Alastair stood away from Cas and looked over the pools of blood gathered around his guard. "The petite prince holds so much violent rage. I don't think it's all you, though." He let Cas give Cole one more slice before he pulled the prince off of the guard. "Your knife will kill him. Then you'd never get to see how he fears you."
Cas quickly moved away from Dean. "You treated me like a stepping stone on your path to victory. You can't just waltz your way into my room and expect forgiveness because you feel bad."
"Oh, I know that Dean. You can't afford to disappoint me." Cain turned to Cas, pulling him into a soft, tender kiss. "Now, we must leave at once. My kingdom needs its ruler."
The candles’ fire roared and winked out after a moment. The room was quiet, empty, still. Dean crossed his arms. “Are you sure you know what you’re doing?” The flames scorched the room as the candles came back to life.
Cas moved away slowly from Cole, still underneath the blankets. "Castiel. You don't get to call me Cas." The man sent Cas into a panic, but he kept his face calm. "What do you want? I'm not holding audiences with peasants." He gritted through his teeth. His eyes darted to the door. His legs still had a dull ache in them, but he'd crawl to the door if he had to.
"What on earth were you doing, Cas?" Cain whispered, pulling away slightly from Cas. He wiped Cas's cheeks, but he was crying too hard to speak. The room went silent aside from Cas's broken, crushing sobs.
Amara snapped her fingers in Dean's face, a questioning smile played on her face. "Lost in thought, darling Dean?"
"If he goes back with you, he cannot be yours, not entirely." Amara walked back to her throne and sat. "Stay here with us, and if he starts to enjoy your company, I'll think about letting him return with you."
She spun around to face him and held her hand out to push Cas back and pinned him to the wall. "I love you, and I want you to stay here with me, but I do not tolerate insubordination. I'll give you one more chance, Castiel. Stay with me, with Dean, here for as long as you live."
Dean slammed her against the stone wall, pressing his arm to her throat. “Your life sounds pretty valuable right about now. Tell me what you know.”
Cas inhaled sharply as he waved the smoke away from him. Dean burst through the door, halfway dressed, pants hanging low on his hips. "I heard screaming; I thought you needed my help."
Dean started thrusting his penis in and out of Castiel slowly and deeply. He leaned down to Castiel and kissed him. Castiel tangled his one hand in Dean’s hair and pulling it slightly, and his another hand clawed into Dean’s back and Dean knew that it would properly leaving scratches, but he didn’t mind. It just made him feel more excited.
Dean knew that Eddie was on duty today. After Castiel confessed his love for him, he had been avoiding Eddie. He didn’t want to face Eddie, he was afraid to hear what Eddie had to say about Castiel; he didn’t want to know how close they had become, he didn’t want to know at all. He even asked their captain, Bobby, to stagger his and Eddie’s shifts. Bobby asked Dean for a reason, but he didn’t give straight answer. Eventually, Bobby agreed to try arranging it, but he asked Dean to fix the problem between him and Eddie as soon as possible. With the help of Bobby, Dean finally succeeded in avoiding Eddie for almost a month, but in the end, he couldn’t avoid it anymore. Today Eddie begins his shift in the afternoon, and Dean thought Castiel, as Eddie’s boyfriend, was definitely coming to the party at the fire station.
“Well, I can play the video games with Christopher another day.” Buck tried to cover disappointment with a little smile.
“Did you bring that plan with you?” Eddie didn’t answer Buck’s question. He checked around the changing room, as if to make sure no one else was there.
Buck’s eyes widened. He didn’t expect Eddie still remember their little plan. But isn’t there more than a month before the 10-year plan expired? Why would Eddie bring it up now? Was it because he had Castiel now, and wanted to cancel the plan early? So many questions came to his mind, but he knew he wouldn’t get any answers at this moment. Buck stared at the screen of his phone for a long time, he took a deep breath before pressing “send”.
Castiel is a speech pathologist who worked with children, so he is a good listener. Dean used to talk to his best friend about everything, from his work to his personal life. He would share everything without keeping any secret. Castiel always listened to him with a smile, and only provided advice sometimes. After Castiel came out to him, he realizes that Castiel rarely talked about himself. Dean only knew that Castiel has two brothers and Meg, a fake girlfriend. Castiel seemed to have been in a relationship with someone else before Meg, but it seemed to have gone badly. Actually, he knew only very little about Castiel, which made him wonder if Castiel had always treated him as a therapy patient, but never as a best friend. That's probably why he was so angry all along.
While Castiel was carefully setting his hair in front of the mirror, someone suddenly held him from behind and bit him on the neck.
Eddie and Buck heard Dean’s angry yelling and immediately separated. They didn’t know what’s going on, but Dean has already rushed forward and punched Eddie in his face. Without any defense, Eddie was hit and fell to the ground.
“You are Castiel, right? I’m Dean, we’ll get you out of here soon, you have to hold on .” Shortly after Dean said this, Castiel fell into a coma.
Castiel was so shocked that his eyes were wide open and his mind was strike blank. He was totally stunned and muted, and he had no idea how to react to his best friend’s question. When Buck told Castiel that he was introducing him a firefighter, Castiel immediately thought of Dean, but Buck also said the guy is a bi-sexual with a child, so he was sure it couldn’t be Dean. He didn’t ever think Dean would have shown up here, and Dean didn’t know Castiel is gay neither. When they first met, Castiel wanted to come out to Dean, but sadly no opportunities at all.
Eddie met Shannon six months later, they fell in love and got married within three months. Eddie then joined the army. A year later their son Christopher was born.
“Dean, everything will be fine. I know you are a great firefighter, and you are very good at that. Alright, ten years later, we will sit here and share the same good times. At least for ten years, you will be safe.”
“Firefighters, paramedics, doctors and nurses were helping.” Castiel interrupted Dean and finished the sentence for Dean.
Castiel’s parents were divorced when he was a little boy. Although he had two elder brothers, he was the only one who lived with his busy mother. Maybe because of his childhood longing for a father's love, he soon realized that he was only interested in boys instead of girls. Also, he was so eager for having a family with the one he love. Balthazar is ten years older than Castiel. Castiel was still a student and studying speech therapy when they met. They decided to move in together six months after they had met. Castiel met Balthazar's parents for the first time two months after they started living together. He still remembered how nervous he was, barely eating anything at dinner and just smiling and answering all of the questions from Balthazar’s parents. He was naive at the time, thinking he would be with Balthazar for the rest of his life, but all he got in return were so many betrayals and endless frighting with Balthazar.
In the bed was a lump that Castiel recognised as Dean himself. Approaching the bed, Castiel heard the regular, slow breathing of sleep, and rolled his eyes.
It was – it was just the way Castiel had imagined it, if not word perfect. The brusque tone, the question. Castiel, half in shadow in a porch in rainy Seoul, stared down at his phone as if it had just promised him the moon.
“Hey,” Dean said, ducking his own chin slightly to catch Cas’ eyes, and hold their gaze. “You know I meant that, right?”
His head tilted forward slightly. His eyes dropped, just for a fraction of a moment, from Castiel’s eyes to his lips, and then back up.
The noise Dean made was involuntary. He put his hand over his mouth again, just for a second, to try to catch it.
“Maybe you should go with Lisa, then,” Dean said to her, and his tone was polite and friendly, but both Lisa and Charlie immediately coloured and Castiel himself froze at the slight.
There was something nagging at Castiel’s mind, but his memories were still hazy and the light was still too bright and his stomach was still churning. Someone passed behind Charlie in the lush hallway where she was standing – someone wearing black and white with a bellboy’s hat on – and with a blink Castiel remembered where they were. The hotel. The casino.
“You seem angry,” he says. No more dancing around it. Predictably, Dean makes a face, as though the suggestion is ridiculous.
“Do whatever it is you normally do,” she said. “Because you’re the only one who might help who he even slightly listens to, so.”
“Your Grace,” Castiel said directly to Lisa, deciding to get it over with. “I’m sorry for the wrong that has been done to you. If there is a way for me to make amends for the hurt and embarrassment, I hope you will tell me.”
“Wait,” Castiel says, his hand still in place, still reaching. It shows, then, he thinks to himself. That sickle-curve sharpness in his chest, the fear in him that he won’t always be able to fit himself to what Dean wants, it must show. Dean can see it. Castiel lifts his chin, tries to look as though he’s feeling incredibly happy, instead of just incredibly much. “Dean, why are you –”
There wasn’t enough of Dean on Castiel’s body. Castiel reached up his hands, traced lines up Dean’s thighs.
it. He’d actually come out to his brother. His brother knew that he was bi, and they were still - he was still invited for Christmas. He was still going to be a part of his brother’s life, and Sam was going to be a part of his, more than before. Every now and then, at a complicated intersection or down a long strip of road, Dean forgot briefly what had just happened, let his mind drift to something else - and then he remembered, and the remembrance smacked him clean out of his own mind.
Castiel couldn’t move. His eyes were fixed on the newsagents. The morning papers were stacked outside it, on shelves that tilted them upright so people could read the headlines and easily grab a copy. The front pages of each paper were almost the same, all showing similar pictures of the same scene, with big headlines splashed across them. Castiel recognised that scene. He recognised his own face, and Dean’s.
“Well, actually. Maybe one day you can tell me the story of that night in Las Vegas.” He turned around, and looked into Sam’s sad eyes. “I wish I remembered it better.”
“But – I mean –” Dean tried to pull himself together. Castiel had to be joking, and Dean was just making an ass of himself looking like he actually believed it. “I mean, okay, dude. C’mon. Be serious.”
“Yeah. Like, mixed. You can get it at that place at the mall… I forget what it’s called. It’s good, though.”
Was he losing it? Dean reread the text over and then over again, and looked back up their conversation to try to make Cas’ reply make sense. The emoticon was typical enough, even though Dean hadn’t seen a smiley one in a while. The way it made his chest squeeze was ridiculous. It was just a smile. And it just followed the words,
“Yeah. The officers go round and do patrols and talk to people.” Dean was reminded, irresistibly, of his Angel of the Underlight. The insistence on patrolling, the determination to talk to the citizens and enquire after their health. Dean gritted his teeth. Maybe the Angel was actually onto something. “You know, they don't even do jail time here, anymore. It's all rehabilitation and restitution based on the severity of the crime and the means of the criminal. And it
They reached the welcoming party as the cameras flashed and clicked. The royals of United Corelia had never been ones for rituals or formality as long as Castiel had known them, but the bachelors still lined up to briefly pay their respects the Queen, who was wearing a chic coat and a smile as she greeted her sons and their friends one by one.
“Shadows and super creepiness,” Dean finished. “Yeah. Look. What happens in this forest stays here. Only gets out as whispers. Not many people come here anyway, there’s a vibe to the place. Only the most ass-headed stubborn people tend to get through and be able to stay.”
But it was the organisation's work to protect the people of the city, from the Up to the Underlight, and that meant - call or no call - it was Castiel's job as an Angel to guard the streets down here.
The words, in Castiel’s voice, kept swinging back into Dean’s mind like a wrecking ball hitting a flimsily built wall.
“No Angels?” Dean said. The thought was bizarre. He knew that Coastal city was across the Sudden Water, the flood that had risen up and swallowed a great swathe of land a few hundred years ago or more. They’d learned about it at school, but that had been a long time ago. “But… do they have a police at all?”
Castiel woke up on the day before Dean and Lisa’s wedding, and picked up his phone, and checked his emails.
turned and left. He was wearing Versace underwear and he needed a bath and he wanted an espresso from his machine in his apartment, and if he got back into the Cullinan he could make everything fit again, he could make his life make sense. He could make it all make sense.
And all of it was pointless to think about it, because obviously Castiel didn’t like Dean. Ten chili dudes didn’t like seven-chili dorks.
With one hand, still kissing Dean, Castiel took Dean’s cock into his hand. He felt Dean reach for him in turn, and start moving his hand up and down, the feeling smooth with the wetness Dean’s mouth had left there. Castiel dropped his kisses to Dean’s neck as Dean’s tight hand jacked him slowly; he had to focus to keep his own hand moving. Dean’s cock was dry to his touch, and Castiel let a spit string fall from his lips to the base of Dean’s shaft, wetting it. It felt beautiful to do it. Every movement Castiel made felt beautiful. The way their bodies were moving, pushing against each other as their hands worked. The shake in Castiel’s legs. The sweat that was running down Dean’s taut neck, that Castiel caught with kisses.
“You’re Dean Winchester,” Castiel said, his tone obviously trying for matter-of-fact. “Of course you’re out of my league.”
He gulped down a mouthful, and felt a closer kinship to Sam than before. Finding out about Cas’ sexuality had been one thing, but finding out he was famous - that had, somehow, been something else. Sam had to be going through something similar, or - in fact - even more intense. It was one thing to think you knew a lot about someone you’d met the day before; it was something else to think you knew your own sibling, and it turned out they were overnight famous for a skill you hadn’t even known they had. Siblings were supposed to know these kinds of things about each other, weren’t they? Or at least, siblings who were close.
across to Castiel. “They’re even more discreet than I am. Perfect for anyone who happens to have found themselves in a right
Castiel stepped across the room towards him. He could feel his heart pounding again. Images pushed at his brain - pictures of what might happen, what could happen between them. He tried to shove them back, like he always did, like he had ever since that night on the roof when they’d shared a moment and both admitted that they didn’t always know what to talk about at parties, and something had shifted, and suddenly Castiel had felt hot and somehow - somehow with an appetite, though he didn’t want to eat or drink, and - and he’d left Dean standing there on the roof, made a quick exit. Ever since, he’d pictured a moment like this.
There are plants that do that, Castiel remembers. Plants that tangle and blend with other plants. They’re weeds. They choke out the first plant, cut off all its light and food until it dies. Two things can’t become one thing without loss. And Castiel doesn’t want to lose Dean – and, he realises quite suddenly, he also doesn’t want to lose himself. There’s so much he wants to do.
“Don’t like the song?” Dean said, and Cas lifted a shoulder. “Oh, what’s his name. The name of the guy who sings it…”
“Saw you reach for your brother when you were falling,” John grunted. “Don’t do that. If you two’re on your own and both of you go down, you’re both dead. If Sam’s still up, he can go for help.”
“You want to be?” Dean says, cautious, hazarding a guess. And when Castiel’s expression tells Dean he’s right, his face goes even more soft with surprise. “Why?”
And then the video was over. It was done. He shut off the phone, and breathed out. Dean had finally seen what over a million other people had seen.
. The Prince of our country cannot be a man who’d promise marriage to one person and then marry someone else.”
She went to stand up, and Castiel saw the expression on Lisa’s face fall as Charlie reminded them all that etiquette and social standing still counted, even here – but then Dean gestured with one hand for Charlie to settle back down onto the blanket.
“What are you thinking?” Cas asked, jerking Dean out of his reverie. He seemed to have picked up on the serious tone of Dean’s thoughts, because his expression held no hint of humour.
“That’s why he’s doing it?” Mary stared at him, the confusion on her face shifting to something deeper and sadder. “That’s the only reason?”
“I should probably stop expecting to see you round every corner, huh,” he said. “Been a week now. And I keep wandering around thinking you might show up just ‘cause I’m looking.” Someone passing gave him a slightly frightened look and a wide berth as he walked by, talking to himself. Just another thing no one had much noticed in Heaven: the prayers. Dean frowned, and ducked his head. Tucked his hands in his pockets.
“Huh?” Dean realised that he’d missed something when he snapped back to reality to find the woman raising an inquisitive eyebrow.
“Yeah,” Charlie said. “I know. I mean, they met a couple of times as kids, I think, but not for like, a decade or two. He’s just flat-out refused to see her for months. I’ve been meeting with her to try to explain that he’s just nervous, but I’m really not the best at explaining things like that, and I don’t think she’s buying it, and every time he skips another party or event that she’s supposed to be at or refuses to set a time for a date, it just gets more awkward… ugh. Anyway, I thought you knew about all this.”
“Shame,” Gabriel said. “I was kinda looking forward to my trip up to the ol’ Forest.” He said it in a hokey, woodfolk-y accent.
poster. He tried to do it quickly, without drawing attention, but Cas peered over his shoulder to look at it as he paid.
“I know I am.” She punched him on the arm, the opposite side to the one she’d reached for when she’d first arrived at the garage and tried to touch him, and Dean had pulled away. This time, Dean only faked it being uncomfortable, acting like she’d wounded him devastatingly. “Let me know how it goes, okay? Swear? I’m gonna be thinking about you all evening.”
Dean closed out the song. Had his voice sounded any good? He’d been so focused on rescuing Cas, and on panicking, and on his memories of the song, that he’d completely forgotten to pay any attention to his technique. Had he even been in tune? Had he breathed at all through the entire thing? People through the bar were calling his name and applauding him, the loudest response of the night so far, and that was answer enough for Dean; he gave a little salute to them, let go of the microphone, and stepped off the stage on legs made of pudding.
“Don’t be,” Dean said bracingly. “Got all I need here anyway.” He picked up a bread bun and sliced it neatly in two. “Toasted bun?” he said.
“Like, I don’t know,” Dean said. “I don’t - I don’t know! What’s the - what am I supposed to - what the fuck is the right reaction to
Dean tapped definitively on his phone, obviously sending the message to Charlie, and then looked up at him.
“Oh.” Castiel looked down at the table, but his expression was – there was no missing it – outright pleased. And Dean, sitting and thinking about what Castiel had said about him, thought that his own face had to look pretty similar.
“It’s a kale smoothie,” Sam said, sounding half-amused and half-defensive. “I tried to make one for you last time you were in town. Remember?”
All of Dean’s carefully placed anger is gone, suddenly, in his shock. There’s no performance, no strategy, in the way that he steps closer and looks utterly bewildered.
Dean opened his mouth, and then closed it again. He stared around the static sameness of his lounge as though anything he saw there could possibly have the answers.
“You know,” Castiel called after him, “for someone who keeps telling me I’m going to leave, you definitely do it a lot yourself.”
Castiel took his phone away from his ear. There had been something so wretched and barely-concealed in Dean’s tone that Castiel himself was upset, his stomach twisting. He looked down at his phone screen.
“How come?” Dean said, knowing his tone was off. Cas was still looking away. He didn’t say anything.
“We can’t tell anyone,” Castiel said. Dean lifted his head to meet Castiel’s eyes. He looked exhausted.
Sunburn, he reminds himself, is more uncomfortable than the growing look of mixed amusement and judgement in Dean’s eyes. Even on a cloudy day, his skin will burn if he’s outside for a long time. Something he learned the hard way after becoming human.
“If that was a kinda spur-of-the-moment thing that you wanna take back,” Dean said, “that’s OK by me. We can head back in.”
Castiel swallowed. There was no escaping this. No quick sound spell to magic him back to a world that made sense. No noise he could make that would undo what was outside the door.
At the mention of Dean’s upcoming marriage to someone else, Castiel could feel his stomach turning again.
He wasn’t going to be able to do it. He was never going to be able to just reach across and grab that phone. He was never going to see that video. He was never going to -
One hand raised involuntarily to cover Dean’s mouth for a second. How had he missed these messages when they came in? Dean read back over them once again, even more carefully, and felt a second rush of hot static go through him.
Dean pushed open the door, and was greeted by the familiar sight of the teachers’ lounge. Its little details seemed stark and strange to him as he glanced around – there was the water cooler, and the countertop with the broken toaster on it, and the assortment of chairs where a few other teachers were sitting and chatting – and there was the table where Castiel usually sat.
If he just gave Sam some time to figure things out, wrap his head around it - do some googling, see all that there was to see and come to terms with it - then maybe they could talk about it again afterwards. Maybe then Sam wouldn’t be so down on the idea. Especially when Dean told him that this didn’t really change anything. Sure, Dean could sing, but he was still just Dean. Just a mechanic.
“I knew it wasn’t gonna be perfect, telling him about it,” Dean said, and he heard the disappointment in his own tone, and cringed. “Seriously. I know how lucky I am. I’m not taking it for granted.”
With a little sniff, Castiel kept going. It was like his thumb had a mind of its own, traversing his Instagram like a lone journeyman, while the sky-gods above in Castiel’s mind begged it to stop.
“Maybe we can go to a bar again some time,” he said. “Doesn’t have to be the Firehouse. Any bar you want. And just hang out. And we can talk about... what you’ve been up to.”
“Sir, I work as a secretary at a realtor’s office in New York city, but I imagine if they’ve begun work, it means they have the permits or whatever it is you need to cut down a tree in a forest in Maine,” said the woman. “Was there anything else I could help you with today? If you want to start the preliminary process of making a sale, I’d be happy to –”
“Wow,” Sam said, as he entered the main courtyard of the palace from the South wing. “I didn’t know this walk was gonna be a real… expedition.”
In his gut, Castiel felt the journey like a weight. He wanted to go back. He wanted to be in his apartment with evening setting in and a scented candle burning, reading up on his latest client’s background or looking up some obscure point of law in one of his books. He wanted to watch Netflix and eat too much pad thai that he’d ordered in. He wanted a bath. He wanted the smell of his place, he wanted blankets on the sofa. He wanted to go out for dinner with his colleagues at Angelus and discuss the latest developments in each of their cases. He wanted to be wearing his suit and tie. He wanted his office. He wanted Bartholomew to give him that single raised eyebrow that meant he was impressed.
They were winding up the conversation, doing it in the strained and taut tones of voice that meant goodbye. The distance was hard on both of them, and the only way it showed was how much effort it took for them both to sound fine.
He lay still, blinking slowly in the sunlight pouring through the window – they’d forgotten to close the curtains, but it didn’t seem to matter. After a little while, he shut his eyes again, and dropped back into sleep. Together, they rested.
Dean appeared in the doorway and Cas, about to say something in reply, paused with his mouth slightly open. His eyes searched Dean’s expression, and apparently found no conclusive answer.
so real. Castiel could see the muscles twitching in Dean’s legs as he shifted from one foot to the other. He could see the gleam of sunlight off Dean’s bare arms. No wonder he’d felt so strong under the clothes that Castiel had believed him into wearing. His arms were big enough that he looked like he could lift Castiel’s whole house.
“I, uh.” Dean swallowed. “No.” A hundred things he’d wanted to say, and all of them stuck in his throat. Stupid seven-chili throat. “Look, what was I gonna do, call out to him from across the street like we’re in a movie? C’mon. I’d have looked ridiculous.”
The makeup room was small, with cream walls and a big black chair sitting in front of a wide mirror. Dean took a seat, feeling big and clumsy. Donna, though, didn’t seem to be suspicious of him; on the contrary, her smile was huge and genuine, and being on the receiving end of it somehow made Dean feel just a little bit better.
“Mhm. So,” she said, her tone shifting gears, driving them away from their reconciliation and down a different road. “About that video.”
A little clutch of fear that he might change, one day. Wake up and be something else, unexpectedly. Grow again, in a direction Dean doesn’t –
Now Dean was leaning forward again, an expression of surprise mingled with that edge of slight glee on his face.
“No,” Castiel said, “you don’t understand. The logging company already have the right to work on some of the land around here. It says here they’re starting here in the forest, today. They’re going to start taking trees down,
Twenty feet away from him, standing completely still, was a figure. Not struggling with carrier bags or strollers or wallets and keys like the other shoppers going into and out of the mall. Utterly stone still.
Claire shoved a croissant into her mouth and bit off a piece. The meal continued in silence for a while, until Todd asked Patience for the jam, and the conversation gently trickled back. It wasn’t until after Castiel had helped clear away and wash up, and he was drying plates with a tea-towel, that he found himself alone with Claire and had the chance to say,
“You’re an ass… butt,” he said, his voice audibly wobbling halfway through the word. Dean staggered a little as he was pushed, and for a second Castiel thought that he’d actually hurt him. He stopped, concerned – and then realised that Dean was laughing, so hard that he was a little jelly-legged with it.
“Uh-huh. Well, then. You know, I didn’t realise this place was so new,” Hannah said, looking around the bar. “Just over a year old, you said?”
“Like… but you get me, right? What you said or didn’t say, it meant we’re both standing here right now, and it’s exactly where I wanna be. I mean, this is probably, like, teak or something.”
He’d spent so long worrying about his chili status, and comparing his to Castiel’s, and he’d actually let himself notice how incredible attractive Castiel was, all under the influence of an app that didn’t even work. He let himself laugh.
He can feel the hat on his head, the way it rests on each hair. He can feel Dean’s closeness, the way the atoms of air jumble between them.
is she.” He pointed to a footman in uniform. “Please go and check for Charlie Bradbury in her office.”
But he didn’t want to leave yet. He didn’t want to leave at all. He wanted longer, he wanted more. He stood still, letting the rain fall on him, and Castiel stood opposite him with his hair and coat getting wet.
Dean took another mouthful, and this time remembered to hold it in his mouth before taking a sip of his own caramel shake. The two mingled in his mouth, sweet and salty and cold and delicious. He rolled them over his tongue, closing his eyes for a moment to think about the taste. Was it better than at the store?
Castiel looked up into those soulless whorls on her face, the dark places where her eyes should be. He looked at her pale skin and the cruel faces that laughed in her robing of shadows. He remembered her saying,
“But I… no one ever… I mean, it’s just in stories that you hear about things like that. It’s like something from a book. But it was just there, in the house. Real skin and bone, and…”
“Oh,” Lisa said, “yes, of course. But perhaps if Dean wanted to come too, then we could all travel to Someria together.”
When he turned back to Dean, he could see that Dean’s mouth was open, and his teeth were a little bared, as though he were calling out. As Castiel watched, his lips moved.
Dean landed hard on his back, head hitting the cement. He stared for a moment up at the sky. It had all happened very fast.
standing there, that Dean had taken a photo of him, balancing the cookies in one hand and taking the picture on his phone with the other. Cas hadn’t noticed. His blue eyes were looking upwards, at the sky.
“It wasn’t even a big deal,” he heard Cas say. “Pretty sure I just made a fool of myself over nothing.”
Castiel looked good today, Dean couldn’t stop himself from noticing. He looked twelve-chili good. And he probably had twelve different inspiring things to say just stored up and ready to go in his head, right now. One for every chili he deserved. The smug bastard. He was just standing there, looking at Dean as though he had no idea what he was doing with the shirt and the tie and the way he talked.
She kept talking as Castiel’s brain tried to grind into action. There was no reason why Dean shouldn’t be sleeping in his room. It was fine, he could tell her.
The memory of Castiel pushing him away, not wanting him unless it was just a bit of fun, bit into Dean’s mind.
He turned in a circle on the spot. He could try to head for Gordon’s store, and see if Dean was there. Or he could just wander the coastal road, hoping they’d run into each other. But there wasn’t time…
He offered them a half-hearted wave and kept walking. He could feel himself starting to panic. Why had he thought coming here was a good idea? He could see the glowing green light of the fire exit right in front of him, and hated himself for turning right and walking away from it and heading into the corridor that led backstage. He hated the way he hoped Cas might also be in makeup, since he hadn’t been sitting at the front with the others. He hated the whole stupid mess that he was in, right now.
“Just trying to keep the mystery alive,” Dean said, faking an absent kind of tone in the hope that Cassie would drop the subject. The sidewalk was getting more and more treacherous, each of his steps sliding just a little.
“If you wanted a poster,” Cas said as they walked away, sounding as though he found it distasteful, “there are always some around. You didn’t have to pay for it.”
Through the series of question marks and exclamation marks in his mind, Dean could only just about manage to say in a tone of voice that was definitely flustered,
“What I’m saying is,” he soldiered on, “robotics can be a seriously inspiring subject. It can change the way you understand the whole world. Like, I mean, maybe you’ll never look at a wire the same again. You’ll be like, I could do things with that wire. I could do
“Anyway. Gonna get cleaned up,” he said. Was Castiel the only one who could see how fixed that grin was? Surely Charlie would suspect something. But she nodded, and started to back away.
“So you do know,” Jo said, sounding relieved. “Okay. Great. That’s pretty much all I came to say, so…”
He ate, and then washed up after his breakfast and dinner from the night before. He opened up his fridge and surveyed the contents; still plenty of food to see him through the next couple of days, if he didn’t mind his meals getting a touch repetitive.
Dean very definitely did not look at Cas as he said the last part, but just voicing those words in Cas’ presence felt like setting down drawing pins in front of a magnet - they were pulled his way, became about him. Dean cleared his throat, and shrugged.
And he was about to turn away, when he saw something change. He frowned, and squinted out over the city.
Dean swallowed. He didn’t want to put any of it into words – how much it had really meant to him, what he’d felt growing between him and Castiel back in college. How happy it had made him when he’d thought that Castiel felt the same. And how much it had hurt when Castiel had blown him off for their first date,
Hearing those words was like suddenly floating away. Like taking a step and realising he was walking on the moon.
“Urgh.” Dean made a few faces in quick succession and swallowed with obvious distaste, before reaching over to his bedside table and grabbing for the glass of water there. Castiel remembered belatedly that Dean had always had more trouble with long hangovers.
Someone was making little low groaning sounds, and he only realised they were coming from his own mouth when he moved the hand on his stomach and they got higher, more strained. His hand was coated in blood. Bright red and angry to be out in the world, when it should definitely have all been inside him.
“Here all along, huh.” Dean says. “Damn it, Cas. And there was me, worrying where to find it for no goddamn reason.” The words are irritable but Dean’s tone is a betrayal of them, because it’s so gentle, so serious. Serious enough that Castiel doesn’t feel silly when he takes a step forward, closer to Dean.
Rooted in inaction. Stuck in his seat. He had to leave, didn’t he – but to chase after Castiel, or not? He couldn’t. Could he? If Castiel had wanted to talk, he’d have stayed. Or if he’d met Dean’s eyes as he’d looked back, it would have been an invitation to talk outside. Maybe, if Dean were – fuck, if Dean were a ten-chili guy from a movie, he could go chasing out of there anyway and know that Castiel would be happy about it. But he was just… Dean. Clumsy. Awkward. Dumbass.
Dean made a sudden break for it towards her, running down the path he’d just helped to clear. After the crunch-crunch-crunch of the snow, the cleared pathway was hard under Dean's feet. Hard, and unexpectedly slippery.
When they’d dropped the bags into the trunk of the Impala, Dean closed it up. They caught each other’s eyes, facing each other, just a foot or so of distance between them - and there it was again. There was that moment of tension, that shape of Cas’ hands and look in his eyes and tilt of his head, and they said
Castiel could feel his heart thudding so hard he thought it was going to give out. He had no sensation in his body. Dean was kneeling in front of him. Dean was on one knee, in front of Castiel.
. Starting every day with a different pastry from the patisserie nearest their hotel… he was going to miss it. Horribly.
Castiel felt the nearness between them like a throb through that quiet, still space inside his chest. The one that the silence here in the forest kept touching.
Dean’s expression seems, with just the smallest of looks in his eyes, to break apart. He holds onto Castiel’s hand and says nothing, doesn’t move.
“I never promised to marry Lisa,” Dean said, his voice so deep that Castiel felt the anger radiating through it. “You did that for me.”
Except perhaps, just for now, maybe he had the right to feel a little cheated on by his own husband. Castiel felt a sardonic smile curve up the corners of his mouth the barest quarter-inch.
And the fact that Castiel himself was one of those people who hadn’t known that pleasure - the fact that the closest he’d ever got to Dean was a variety of charged stares - that was somehow both a source of pride and frustration.
“Yes,” Castiel said. “A good thing I brought them. It’s not as though I could watch much television here.” He gestured towards the clunky square of television squatting on its table opposite the sofa. Dean looked over at it.
They sat and talked as their drinks were made; Cas listened to Dean talk about cars, and they ordered more drinks, and Dean listened to Cas talk about cocktail-making and book-binding and bee-keeping - what a guy, he thought, as they ordered their third round. What a guy. Bee-keeping. What the fuck. And then they both sat and listened to each other talk about their favourite places to visit, and then Dean asked another question about the bee-keeping (
“It is true sometimes,” Charlie said bracingly. “Not in possession of the longest attention span over here. And I think I can make things about me a little bit when they’re not.”
“Well, then. We can all clear out. Donna, honey, can you help me pack up the things in the car? Castiel, you comin’ with us back to the hotel, or…”
He glanced across at Dean, who was looking straight ahead, and then at Lisa, who was watching Charlie. She was probably also thinking that Castiel should be over there, Castiel thought. Or wishing that Charlie had challenged Castiel’s place in the photo.
“Holy crap,” Sam said, voice distant with disbelief. “In the news tab on Google. It says that you’ve been added to the show. Your actual name is here, and a picture of you.”
Castiel could hear the pain in Dean’s voice, and he understood. Dean couldn’t hurt his mother or his country over the way that he felt about Castiel, couldn’t tear it all apart – but Dean would take the pain until the end, just for the chance to see Castiel when he could. He was clawing for the damage, trying to take it all himself.
Castiel risked a glance over his shoulder. Dean was looking past a sleeping Charlie and out the window of the plane, but as soon as Castiel turned, he glanced over.
Dean’s feet wouldn’t walk him away. Still, he kept thinking he might see Cas again, and that was worth sticking around just another few minutes. He gritted his teeth. Why in the
He walked back into his house, and looked around. The red rug had a new verve to it; the bannister shone in the light through the door. The grandfather clock said,
“Dean,” he said. Dean looked flushed, even a little dazed. His tie was askew. “Dean, wait, what - is this - is this just…” He struggled for the right word. Dean swallowed, and Castiel wanted to kiss his neck, kiss his throat, put his mouth to Dean’s skin and make Dean say his name.
ache that he realised had become familiar. Now, Cas’ hands were clenched tight into fists, and his jaw was set as Dean pushed open the door.
“How I felt,” Castiel said, and Dean couldn’t completely tell in the dark, but from the sound of his voice, Castiel was definitely going red.
“I already texted her,” Cas said, waving his phone. “But it’s fine. No one knew I was at the Ground Floor anyway, so we weren’t followed here. And no one knows what I look like.” A teenager in a hoodie gave Cas an odd look as she passed.
Dean... had completely just told his brother Castiel’s real identity. Sam was totally going to realise that Cas was Castiel. And even though Dean hadn’t ever explicitly said who Castiel was, and his agreement in the NDA he’d signed was unbroken - even still, Jody was going to
“Damn right, you’re not my fiancé,” he said. Castiel saw Lisa smile a little nervously in the background, clearly thinking that Dean was making a joke – and in a way, Castiel thought, Dean was, except it was a joke that only Castiel himself understood.
“Thanks,” Dean said, and smiled at them again. “Good to meet you, Hannah.” Had that been a little creepy, using their name? They didn’t seem to have noticed, only smiling back in a light, professional way.
Castiel had been lost in the flurry of trying to fix their mistake, and the argument that had led up to it suddenly came back to him. The curt rage and helplessness in Dean’s voice. The way he’d seemed to deflate as soon as Castiel had said that the marriage meant something to him.
“Is there a self-help book called How to Keep a Company Secret? She literally told me what you had for lunch on the day it happened. Seriously, I hope you got the chance to tell the people at your firm not to trust her with anything important, before they – you know…”
“Yeah,” Dean said, trying to sound confident. “I just - whoa -” The room dipped and spun, blackness eating at the edges of his vision, and even sitting on the floor he felt himself start to tip sideways and fall. He caught himself with a hand, and blinked. “No, I’m okay, I just, uh -”
“Yeah,” Dean said, warming to his theme a little since the first statement didn’t seem to have caused offence. If anything, Cas looked eager for him to continue. “That thing he does where he always wears the mask onstage and in public, it’s so gimmicky. And like, it’s like every other cheesy pop singer ever has a hand up his butt, and he’s just their little song-puppet. People going wild for the same chords over and over. And the worst?” Dean was in full flow, now. “The worst is that he’s singing about falling in love like it’s all cute and nice and happy, blah blah blah,
Just a brief kiss, really. Just a moment, when their lips were pressed and their eyes were closed and everything was exactly as it should be, right here in their little world within a world.
“Thanks,” he managed. Maybe he had killed it, after all. Maybe they’d just be awkward around each other for the next five minutes and then Cas would get up and leave, and that would be that.
“It’s a picture of you, with Castiel, holding wedding rings,” Mary said. Her voice betrayed no anger, her composure complete.
“Tell you later,” he finally managed, and reached to unclip his seatbelt, and stood up. He couldn’t just turn around and go back to typing – Dean would come over to talk to him, insist on knowing what was going on, and Castiel didn’t want to tell him. He had to get away. Too quickly, he started to walk. He headed towards the back, brushing aside the curtain that kept one of the more functional parts of the plane hidden from the minimalist luxury space for the passengers.
“Before you go,” said Anna, Castiel’s lawyer, her red hair swinging. “Dean. Have you heard what Castiel’s thinking of doing?”
She stepped forward, and now it was Charlie and Lisa leading the way while Dean and Castiel fell a little behind. Lisa was so easy with Charlie, Castiel thought. Or perhaps she was just easier in general out here in the forest, with no watchful judging eyes on her every move. Either way, she was laughing and using her elbow to nudge Charlie as they walked and pointing out a little moorhen on the water with a softer, deeper, more genuine voice than Castiel had ever heard her use before.
Dean had a sudden flashback to himself assuming that Cas had to be a mafia crime boss, when actually he’d just been wanting to say that he was asexual. Was it possible that ‘assuming someone is in trouble with the law when they’re actually just super freakin' queer’ ran in the genes, he wondered.
Dean had watched his parents worry and ache over money year in, year out as he grew, some new final demand always dropping into their mailbox. The drums in the song kicked in, the beat really taking off, and Dean started to move to it. He hadn’t heard this one in a long time, even though he often found himself singing it around the garage, and he’d listened to it enough times as a teenager stuck in a backwater town that he’d never forget the lyrics.
“Shit,” Dean said, and Castiel felt Dean’s cock twitch inside his mouth. “Oh, god. Can you – can you move? Can you –”
No. Not the Versace. He kept digging, and finally settled on a plain white t-shirt that he wore often, but which wasn’t irreplaceable.
“You were honest,” Cas said simply. “I haven’t ever heard anyone be so honestly, accurately critical of my music like that to my face. It was refreshing.”
Dean sat down at the edge of the stage, legs dangling. In front of him, Cas handed the laptop back to Jody.
How could Castiel live out the rest of his life without another morning tracing the pattern of Dean’s freckles with his gaze, or letting his breathing follow the pattern that Dean’s set?
“Oh! Right,” Dean said, the penny dropping. “He and him, please.” Why was he saying please? It had just come out. He wasn’t used to being asked his pronouns, even though he knew enough people through The Refuge who didn’t go by the ones they’d been assigned at birth. People tended to just assume they knew with Dean, and it was oddly nice for it to be open like that, even though he was giving the obvious anwer.
Dean misses Castiel. He remembered the last time he saw Castiel, and he was so painful with all the hard feelings in his heart. He never thought his best friend would fall in love with him, so when he heard Castiel’s confession, he really didn’t know how to respond. When Castiel left his apartment that day, he fell to the floor, tears flooding out of his eyes uncontrollably. He felt so sad that a little voice in his mind told him to go after Castiel, but he knew he couldn’t because he wasn’t gay and he couldn’t possibly fall in love with Castiel. He told himself that since he couldn’t respond to Castiel’s love, he should let Eddie make Castiel happy. Although Dean would hear that little voice telling him how much he missed Castiel from time to time, he always ignored it.
At first Dean was worried about Sam would have a problem with it or say something when he took Castiel with him and explained to Sam that they were together.
“Dean?” Castiel opened his eyes round, thinking he was still in a dream. Then his mind flashed back to last night’s sex scene. He felt his ears heating up and spreading rapidly.
“Um… I’ve got a date tonight. I met a chick on the apps.” Buck said and he put his hands on the chest to express the chick has huge boobs. “She’s hot.” Buck paused for a moment, “Go ahead and do your thing, everything will be perfect.”  Buck tapped on Eddie the shoulder and gave him a genuine smile. He stood up and prepared to leave.
“Oh, so it was a dream about me, that’s why you were smiling so much.” Dean threw Castiel a wink. “By the way, do you know what I haven’t told you yet?”
On the others hand, about the thing of homophobic… Indeed, Dean didn’t know how to deal with a gay guy well compared to bisexuals, or lesbians. He thought he would never discriminate against gay men but actually they made him a little bit sick. He blamed that it’s just a physical repulsion from them.
“Dean… wait…” Castiel’s cock was getting hard, and he really wanted to make love with Dean, but he knew he couldn’t go on without figuring out what was happening, so he pushed Dean away.
When Dean was back on the bed, he asked Castiel to lie on his back. He caressed Castiel’s hair and neck, and left many kiss marks on his back. Dean slipped on a condom and tore the package of lube and made sure his finger was covered with it, then he swirled and pressed outside the hole before slipping his middle finger into the little sweet hole. The wet finger was surprisingly easy to work with, and it didn’t take long for him to try putting his second finger and rotating them slowly. Dean knew the structure of the human body, and he curled his fingers slightly to explore deeply to the spot that would make Castiel gone crazy. When Castiel suddenly jerked up and screamed, Dean knew he had found it, and made the corners of his mouth turn upwards. He started to massage Castiel’s prostate gland in a circular motion with gentle pressure while he kissed Castiel’s thighs and lower abdominal. It made a return of Castiel’s erection and let him scream more and more.
After turning off the lights in Christopher’s room, Eddie looked back at his son. “Me too.” Eddie whispered and closed the door.
“Oh, Dean… Oh…I’m coming…” Castiel grappled the bed sheet tightly, closing his eyes and groaning, and the precum was all over his cock.
Buck saw Eddie’s smiling face and figured out Castiel may be the right guy for him. Although he was happy for Eddie, he couldn’t fight unpleasant and sour feeling at the bottom of his heart...
“Are you done? Then you can go.” Dean folded his arms over his chest. Castiel knew the look of rejection in Dean’s face, and he was about to explode.
Sunlight crept through the halfway opened curtains, falling right into Castiel’s eyes. For a moment, he wondered why he was so warm, yet so sore. He frowned as he groped the blankets around him, then opened on his eyes. Dean snored softly underneath him, his hand resting on Cas’s back. Cas lifted himself off of Dean and sat up in bed. He stretched his arms out in front of him and scratched his stubble. He glanced back to Dean before he got out of bed and walked to his mirror. He shaved his face clean, finding a black shirt and pants to dress. Once clothed, he studied his features in the mirror. He didn’t look any different than he remembered, but he knew he felt different. His mind was clouded and confused with memories of the truth and the lies. He traced his fingers down to the mark Amara placed on him. How would Cain feel about him wearing her brand? He glanced back to his left hand, frowning when he realized his wedding band was missing. He gritted his teeth and vanished in a cloud of smoke. He appeared in Amara’s room, his anger boiling to his face.
Lucifer reached for his knife, pressing it to Noctis’s throat. “If you think I’d be beside myself with guilt and regret over Castiel’s death, you surely have mistaken me. I couldn’t care less about my brother’s body.”
Cas clenched his fists as he dug deep within himself. The light in his eyes went from bright blue glow to a blinding white light. His voice lowered to a deep satin tone as a wisp of smoke left his agape mouth. "I beckon the night unto me. From the deepest depths of the sea. From ancient evils long forgotten. Bring forth a will that can't be broken. To Noctis I pledge my soul. To summon a deathly power. To see my hated foes devoured." As Cas spoke, Amara's crown grew red hot, the delicate leaves melting into a warped hunk of metal. Ink covered Cas's hands and crawled over his circlet. The ink seeped into the jeweled crown, no trace of the black ooze remained on the surface.
"Emmanuel?" Cas chuckled softly, rubbing his back. "Who's Emmanuel? Have you found a new partner to entertain your nights while I was away?"
Dean grinned as Raphael drew his sword as well. "Well either way, I'm going down swinging." Uriel swung his sword at Dean's feet in an attempt to knock him down, but Dean jumped back. He plunged the knife in Uriel's arm and twisted the blade until Uriel dropped his sword. Dean scurried to pick up the newly freed sword, quickly holding it over his head as Raphael's blade came down on him. He kicked the other guard off of him, holding the sword defensively. He started to back away from the gallows, ready to kill if he had to.
"I see. Even the royal family has dysfunction." Dean laughed softly. "I'm sorry for your father, though. I know how difficult that loss is."
As they approached the gates, the once proud city stood in ruins. Dean stopped his horse in awe, looking to Rowena. “Just a few months ago, this place was thriving. We were just here. There were people, very few people, but they were still here.”
Sam had guessed their move would take a week, and he was right. The Havenshire rebellion was outside Eastden's capital walls seven days after they had departed. As they approached the walls, Dean slowed to a stop, holding his hand to signal to the others. He climbed down from the horse, and then got Emma down. He walked over to Sam with her tailing his heels. He looked up at Sam still on his horse. "let them make camp here tonight, I have to talk to Castiel alone. Can you manage without me for a few hours?"
Alastair let him go and helped Cole to his feet. "I'll let you use my knife if you think he deserves more punishment." He grinned.
Cas quickly looked up at Dean again, panic in his eyes. "Please, don't tell him, Dean." He moved away from Dean now, standing on shaky legs. He used the baseboard of the bed to support himself. "He'll never leave me alone again. Just leave it alone, please." As he stood longer, his legs started to balance out. "Can you teach me how to use a knife?"
Dean sped up his hand, pulling away from Cas's lips. "Don't cum from the foreplay. I want to play for a while." He grinned, nipping at his bottom lip. He reached to the nightstand, pulling a bottle of oil out of the drawer. "Your body seems so sensitive." He dipped two fingers inside the oil jar, coating them. "spread your legs and relax."
Cas shook his head and wiped sweat from his brow. "I don't need your help. I can protect myself, Dean." He walked over to the vanity and looked over Amara's things. He held her crown for a moment. "I didn't ean to sound so coarse, but I need to have some control again."
Dean bit his lip and glanced back to the mark. He wanted Cas back more than anything in the world. He wanted to see Cas's smile, the small crinkles around his eyes, the warmth he brought into every room he entered. But it wouldn't be Cas if he didn't remember the true way Dean treated him. Amara offered him everything he could dream of, but he knew it would only be an allusion. His Castiel knew pain and grief and sorrow. He wanted Cas to forgive him on his own. He wanted to see his daughter and give her the life she deserved to have. "I won't do it that way Amara. Give me the time to win Cas back. If he breaks free of your magic, he comes with me to Eastden. If I can't free him, I'll leave without him and return news of his death so that you and him may live in peace here. Cain won't come for him if he's dead."
Dean chuckled softly, brushing the infant's cheek as he still held Jess's stare. "What's her name? Congratulations on motherhood. It suits you."
Cas tried to swallow the hard lump in his throat to no avail. When Dean leaned against him, Cas could feel his heart race. "And? P-Plenty of nobility is small statured." He kicked himself as his voice cracked.
Cas shrugged, "I play with it, use it to go across the castle." He pulled away from Dean and  stood up, grabbing his clothes and dressing himself. "Rowena teaches me easier spells. Cain doesn't know yet."
Cas stood perfectly still as she held him, returning her cold stare with his own fiery angered look. "With all due respect," A sly grin curled on Cas's lips. "Which is none, but you're not my mother." He summoned Cain's blade out of his sleeve and disappeared from Amara's hold. He reappeared behind her, knife raised above his head.
"As do men." Alastair smirked, "Yes, yes. The whispers of your capture have even reached Eastden. Buried inside of a young nobleman." He pushed the full bowl of porridge aside and leaned close to Dean. "The quieter voices speak ill of the king's new bridegroom."
Cas’s eyes fluttered open. He was in his room again? Had it all been a dream? The pain radiating from his rear argued against his dream theory. He groaned as he sat up, rubbing his lower back. His handmaiden, Hannah, entered his chambers to check on him.
Cas felt his knees buckle, collapsing on the ground. As his vision went black, his thoughts swirled with Dean and the possibility of never seeing him again. What would the king expect of him? What if Dean was executed?  His last thought was of Dean before everything faded to black. He had to save Dean, no matter the cost to himself.
"Will you stay tonight? Or are you going to the barracks?" Cas hugged around Dean's torso, trying to hold him in bed as long as he could.
Dean didn't answered as he took in the room. The knives, the pillars, the saws. Every tool in the chamber looked covered in blood or rust or both. He looked over the center table: the old wood splintered near the hand restraints, a fingernail lodged in the wood; blood soaked into the center of the table, so much so that there was a circular red stain underneath the table. He finally found his words, "No, not really." He answered, for a moment forgetting his troubles with Cole.
Dean excused himself. He ran down the hall of the floor, bursting into the first empty room he found. No matter how far he ran though, Cas's pained, broken, shattered sobs followed him. He wanted to forget those sounds, but the echoes wouldn't let him. He covered his ears as he tried to block out Cas's cries. He pushed Cas over that balcony. He shouldn't have been so coarse with him. He should be the one holding him, comforting him. He didn't care about Alastair's warning; he had destroyed Cas in his attempt to keep him safe. Cas's sobs broke Dean's will, and the stone walled man crumbled, crying into his lap.
"Alright, fair enough. I want to speak with him when he's back in a cell." Cain stood from his seat, helping Cas up too. He put an arm around Cas's waist and led them away from the square.
Dean left Cain in the torture chamber, rushing upstairs to find Cas. He burst through the bedroom's door. Near the entrance, there was a large, rust colored stain on the floor. Dean reached down, touching the stain. He looked at the dried flakes of blood on his fingertips, eyes cooling to green again. A single tear fell from his eyes, but he quickly wiped his face clean. He rushed back to the barracks, grabbed Cole out of his bed, and slung him onto the ground.
Cas shook his head, brushing Dean’s hair softly. “No, Cain was with me this morning until I wanted to paint. I find it soothing.” He smiled at Dean for a moment, “but not as soothing as your prescence. I always feel safe with you.”
Rowena walked into the dilapidated castle, grabbing scraps of the vines surrounding the cracked pillars. “Where did she die? That’s where her connection to our world would be the strongest.”
Dean leaned into Cas's hand, relaxing against the warm gentle touch. "I know, Cas. But we're together now. We can finally be together. He's gone. How did he step down?"
Rowena crossed her legs as she sat in a chair by the fireplace, "When that little handmaid came rushing for a doctor, I followed him upstairs. He stitched you up, but that's all he did. They all thought you were dead." She grinned pointedly. "But I knew Noctis wouldn't let you die."
Cas pulled Dean into another kiss. "Fine. I won't use it on Cain. I'll give him a real memory if it'll soothe your worries."
"I couldn't just let you get trampled though. That's a horribly slow and painful death. I'd make it quick." He teased and sat next to Cas. "Besides, what if you'd been just 'Jimmy'? You seem to be more on my side than Michael's. Why don't you join us? We could use an insider."
"Hmm... not fully." He smirked, pulling Dean into a soft, slow kiss. "You might have to 'show' me how sorry you are." He whispered.
"You and Castiel are bound to each other. You cannot destroy him, and he cannot destroy you. No matter the distance between you, any curses or blessings placed on you, not even my old and forgotten magic will separate you." Amara frowned slightly.
Dean swallowed the ale in one long drag before he looked back to Sam. "He killed them. He killed Cas and Henry."
“‘Rid of you?’ You make it sound as if he sees you as a pest.” Castiel stayed silent at that and looked forward to Michael as he spoke to the king of the Northern Isles. Cain studied his face for his answer, frowning when he found it. “Well we will leave Havenshire as soon as you wish, Castiel.”
“Are you feeling well now, Sir?” She sat a tea tray beside the bed and poured a steaming cup of tea, drizzling honey in it the way Cas enjoyed his tea. “The king brought you to your room after you fainted. He believed the news of your marriage overwhelmed you.”
"Yeah, Emmanuel?" He brushed his cheek with his thumb. "Don't worry, Manny. I'll let you finish." He smiled, kissing his jaw.
The physician pulled the curtain around Charles's bed, shaking his head grizzly. He looked to the eldest prince, parting his cracked lips with a saddened twitch. "King Charles has joined the beautiful Queen Rebekah in the great beyond. His dying wish was for Michael to be crowned king."
Dean screamed in agony, arching against the restraints. He growled and started tugging on the restraints again. "Fight me like a man, Cain!" His face contorted in pain as Cain peeled his skin back.
Dean shook his head, "It's not that, Sam. He wouldn't even look at Henry this morning. Cas would never ignore Henry, especially now. I don't know if I can do this, Sam. That's not the man I love."
Dean pulled Cas's head back, a growl rumbling in his throat. "Oh, sweetheart, I'll help you as long as your body can take it." He pressed lips around Cas's Adam's apple, grazing his teeth against the white skin. He traced his lips down his neck and across Cas's collarbone, a gentle hand on Cas's hip.
Amara thought for a brief moment, looking Dean up and down as she did. "Court him. If he accepts your advances, I won't stand in your way. No matter the consequences." She cupped his cheek before patting his face with a smirk. "I'll write Cain about your decision to stay longer. Of course, I'll be discreet. Wouldn't want the entire Eastden army marching on my kingdom." She drew in closer, her lips just inches away from Dean's. "It's a pity you prefer Castiel. Your bloodline is strong, perfect for my kingdom."
Meg crossed her arms and sat near his desk. "I found a bag with a fancy circlet in it. Care to explain why you have one,
Cas picked at his blanket and hurriedly glanced away from Cain. He couldn't come out and say Dean ended things between them, but it wasn't just that Dean ended their relationship. He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly through his nose. "Could I please have some soup or stew?" His voice quivered. He wasn't sure if Cain would be angry with him for the past week.
"I don't want to be with him," Cas sat up from the bed and stretched his arms. "He's a weak pathetic ruler now that he bares no mark."
Jess gave Castiel a hug instead of a handshake, grinning as usual. "It's plain to see where Henry gets his beauty." She winked at Dean, "Where is he? I've grown somewhat attached to him in the recent months."
The courier rolled his eyes and pulled a small purse of coins he used as a toll for bandits like Dean and Sam. "I have to deliver this coronation invitation to King Michael. There's a new king of Eastden and Elladonton." He chunked the purse at Dean to bait him away from his horse.
Dean's laughs faded quickly. "If that's the case, then I need you to get plans of the castle. We plan on taking the castle the first opening we get."
"Thank you, Dean." Cas grumbled, calming down after his near-death experience. "That's the second time, you've saved me." He smoothed his shirt.
Michael was surprised to see Dean standing outside of Cas's room. "Well, isn't this wonderful? Cain entrusted you to guard my brother?" He laughed softly, "I'm surprised to know my baby brother is still alive with you around him all the time."
"Please Cain. I told him not to worry you. He said he would take care of the guard." Cas pulled Cain into bed, just wanting to be held. He curled up next to Cain and wrapped his arms around Cain's torso. He buried his face in Cain's chest. "Please. Just, don't leave me right now. I need you."
Emma frowned slightly. "I don't want you to go, Daddy! Why can't his mama come to us?" She crossed her arms.
“You won’t do anything to him! I swear I’ll kill you before you ever touch him.” Cas clenched his fist, slamming it on the mirror. The mirror cracked ever so slightly. “Get out of my body!”
Cas pouted as he leaned up to Dean's lips, repeatedly kissing him. "I told you not to call me Manny. I prefer Emmanuel." He laughed before he pulled away from Dean entirely. He swung his hips teasingly as he sauntered over to his bed, climbing on it. He motioned Dean to follow.
