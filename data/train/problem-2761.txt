“We make her do the dishes for a few days,” John explained. “We go easy the first time and then we get rougher.”
“Hey,” her ex-girlfriend said.
“Don’t make me spank you,” John said setting the box on the bedside table. “I don’t want to but I will.”
“You’re fine,” John said pushing the toy in even further.
Before John tried again he grabbed a hold of the handcuffs with one hand. He was more than willing to help the detective stay in place. He added a little more lube to the toy before he picked it up again. Carefully, he started he started pushing the toy inside.
Rosie walked out into the hall before looking down at the slip.
“Goodnight Rosie,” her father whispered.
Sherlock wanted to make his daddy proud.
“Family night?” Rosie asked as she set the table. “On a weekday?”
John opened the bottle and squeezed out a glob onto his fingers.
Rosie had everything. She had two loving parents, a happy safe home, friends, and a loving girlfriend.  She had a private driver who brought her to school every morning. Of course, one of her parents still insisted on coming but she didn’t mind. She had everything so why wasn’t she happy. Rosie was always the kind of person who wanted more. Her parents had always urged her to go for what she wanted. She wanted a new handheld game system that her parents refused to buy her since it wasn’t her birthday or a holiday. She earned the money doing housework for friends. It only took a few weeks and then she had her money.
“No,” she said shaking her head. “I can handle it.”
Rosie glanced down at the outside pocket on her backpack. The small area contained the two pills that remained.
The end of the toy slipped into the hole in the harness that was covered with a lockable clip that way you could change the plug out without taking the whole harness out. Maybe he would shove a bigger one in there once Sherlock was relaxed.
The fox swung the strip of leather through the air with as much force as he dared. The sound of it smacking with Sherlock’s soft skin filled the room. Sherlock threw back his head and wailed with pain. He was panting heavily and pushing back against the blows.
No! Sherlock didn’t want to see that. He didn’t enjoy seeing himself in pain. He didn’t understand how he could orgasm when he was suffering like that. It just didn’t seem normal to him.
“Just take one at a time,” Karen said as Rosie put them in her pocket. “If it feels like too much cut them in half. Don’t get carried away Rosie. LImit yourself.”
“Yes,” John said placing the flannel into the bowl.
“Sherlock!” John cried as a very painful cramp hit him. “I can’t! I need to pull out.”
The bunny began to twist and rub his stomach harder. It was so intense. It felt like someone was ripping his insides out.
Sherlock knew he had a choice. John wouldn’t make him do it if he simply walked away. Yet, he knew he wasn’t going to walk away. He deserved the punishment. He hadn't taken a nap when he was supposed to. John had simply tried to give him an ice shower and he couldn't handle that.
“Uh!” John said grumbled pausing his movement.
The young girl got to her feet with the help of the teacher. She was still crying as the teacher led her to the nurse’s room. Rosie stepped out of the way of the room way and leaned against the wall. She was in so much trouble.
“Why can’t you just do what you’re told?” the large wolf demanded, keeping an eye on the thermometer.
“Describe it to me,” John said.
being the keyword.
A powerful cramp was starting to build in his gut. His body didn’t want anything to do with the cock inside of him. He brought a hand down to rest on his stomach. He wanted to take it all. He wanted to cum with John’s knot in him.
Sherlock finally got control of his tears as he curled up into a ball. The dummy felt strange in his mouth and the nappy felt uncomfortable and heavy against his skin. He hated it!
“It hurts!” the bunny said fighting the urge to pull away. “Stop! It’s burning!”
in his mouth.
“No fingers,” Sherlock explained, getting on his hands and knees. “Just give it to me.”
“Please don’t,” the bunny cried closing his eyes.
She didn’t think she would have a problem but the second she saw Luna she knew she couldn’t do it. She quickly ran out of the room before Luna could see her. She had had no idea where she was going but she knew she couldn’t’ go to class.
Oh man.
“I’m sorry,” he said bending over his lover. “You wanted this. Only a few more goes darling and then we’ll take a break.”
"No," he whimpered. "Not really."
“Never mind that,”  Marcus said desperately trying to change the subject. “Who do you have for math Karen? Mrs. Smith is killing me.”
“Almost there,” John said. “I’m so proud of you. I know it’s killing you.”
“I’ll be right there darling,” John called.
him tearing him apart. Yet, his body was screaming at him to take it out. It was too big!
He quickly jumped up and ran to the bedroom. The wolf chuckled as he watched his pet run off to the bedroom. The little pale creature seemed desperate for sex. That was just the way that John liked him. The wolf took the time to quickly pull down his pants. His rock-hard cock jutting up instantly. He wanted to be ready for his little bunny when he returned.
Sherlock whimpered flopping his head around. HIs floppy ears bounced around a bit.
John rolled Sherlock so he was on his side. The two cuddle up against each other. The doctor reached around and took Sherlock’s cock in his hands. He gave it a few delicate strokes. Despite all of Sherlock’s screaming, he was hard as a rock.
“I want to fuck you,” John grunted, as he felt himself getting hard again.
“It’s much smaller than my cock,” the doctor said pulling out a bottle of a bottle of lube.
to be spanked. To be used, fucked and filled. John’s already hard cock became raging steel at the sight of those plump mounds jiggling so delectable! As a wolf, John grew up with other wolfs, men and women wolves, and they all had decent butts, but they, like himself, had butts that were much flatter compared to bunnies, and most especially, Sherlock’s. There was nothing like the perfectly round ass cheeks of his bun-bun.
“No,” the bunny sobbed, shaking his head. “I hated it.”
“Fine,” her friend said finally getting out of line.
“Yes,” he whimpered. “But it isn’t helping. I keep going to the bathroom.”
She was still going full steam when John came to tuck her in.  To her surprise, he was carrying a new bag.
John brought his mouth down and gently ran his long, sharp teeth against Sherlock’s neck. The bunny let out a frightened whimper. He knew his wolf wouldn’t hurt him, but he couldn’t stop from feeling scared.
The wolf took one of the flannels out of the water and began to gently wash Sherlock with the cool water. The bunny soon began to relax under his touch. He was slowly and carefully rocking against the cock lodged inside of him.
“Tell me you’re proud of me,” Sherlock demanded in a small high-pitched wrecked voice.
John took a deep breath before he started to push it. He took a little force to get it into Sherlock’s light entrance. His bunny took the pillow into his mouth and bit down hard. He was already panting.
“Oh Sherlock,” he said unlocking the handcuffs. “That was amazing. I'm so proud of you."
“Fuck,” he growled. “Look at you, already
“Twenty hits with the belt,” John said. “Stay in position and it’ll be over soon.”
Mild Daddy kink.
Karen nodded as Rosie passed her the handheld game. Rosie was so lucky. She had everything. Two great parents, a beautiful room, and nice toys. She wished she had half of the things Rosie had. She pushed the jealousy aside and decided to focus on having a good time with her new friend while it lasted.
“Lube,” John growled to the room of onlookers. “Someone get me some lube.”
Sherlock began to sob and his body began to shake uncontrollably as he felt John explode inside of him. He was pulling on the restraints as hard as he could. It was a wonder they were able to hold him.
The bunny wanted to beg him not to. His was trembling from the embarrassment of what was getting ready to happen. He did everything he could to relax. He was in a situation he couldn’t do anything about. If he just relaxed it would be over so much sooner.
The hard spank brought Sherlock back to earth. He stopped screaming but kept pulling on his ears.
“Stop being a child. You’re going, Sherlock, and that’s all there is to it!” John snapped. “Now go out and buy yourself an outfit. Take my card if you want and get whatever costume you think will be suitable for a party.”
“John?” Sherlock’s sleepy voice came.
The wolf lifted the ruler and brought it down hard. Sherlock gasp and dropped his ears. The pain of the hit send waves of fire through his backside. John brought the ruler down again, only harder. A large welt began to form on the bunny’s pale skin.
“You seem to be a better mood,” John said as they rode towards their flat.
. He brought the next couple of hits down quickly.
At lunchtime Luna always wanted the two of them to sit alone together under the apple tree in the courtyard. When the weather was too bad to go into the courtyard they would choose a table in the corner of the lunchroom.
John carefully removed the device and sat it on the floor. He quickly grabbed a towel and wrapped his bunny up. The bunny began to stop trembling as soon as he was wrapped in a warm towel.
“I had two cigarettes,” Rosie admitted before her parents had a chance to ask.
“Bottle please,” the bunny whispered.
John knelt on the floor next to him holding a few pills and a glass of water.
“Yes,” Karen said with a shrug. “But it isn’t that big of a deal. I don’t push it on anyone else.”
As much as Sherlock complained about John’s massive knot it was never enough to make him come once he got used to it. It didn’t hurt anymore and he wanted more.
Sherlock pushed out his plump bottom lip as far as he could go. “But Jaaawn! I don’t want to go!”
“You don’t want this to stop,” John said. “If you wanted it to stop you’d get up and leave the room. You know I’m not forcing you to do anything.”
“Of course,” the wolf explained. “You were bad. I know it hurt but you need to learn to trust me. Fighting me always causing you more pain. You must learn that.”
John knew he needed to check his lover’s temperature. He was getting warmer and starting to get too excited. The doctor could feel it.
“Take long deep breaths,” the bunn instructed. “Don’t panic. That only makes it worse.”
“Oh Sherlock,” the wolf said as he started to come down from his high. “You’re doing amazing.”
“Do me,” he demanded through his tears. “Hold me down and take me.”
“I see someone is sick,” John said sitting down on the bed. “Try any medicine?”
“Oh sorry!” Karen said. “I should have asked.”
He whimpered closing his eyes. Sherlock earned this! He just needed to keep telling himself that over and over.
“Please don’t,” Sherlock begged. “Please!”
“That’s my bunny,” John grunted, nibbling on ears. “You can take so much.”
Over the next few days, Rosie thought about what Karen said. Ritalin was the drug her friend was taking. She said that it helped her. It sounded too good to be true. What if she got addicted? What if her parents found out? How would she afford it?
Rosie wasn't sure when she finally managed to drift off to sleep.
Sherlock was used to being pinned by his lover against the sitting room carpet and taken hard and fast. He loved feeling John’s teeth against his neck, so close to biting him.
“Yes,” John said. “I want to see you take him. Once you get going I’ll get more involved. Lube is on the bedside table.”
“Do I have to stay for this lesson?” Rosie questioned.
Sherlock cried heavily as body struggled to adjust to the situation. He wasn’t really crying because of the pain. He could handle the pain. He was just overwhelmed by the sensations he was feeling.
Tears filled the bunny's eyes as he felt his wolf bottom out deep inside of him. He felt his body tremble as it tried to adjust to the massive feeling inside of him. Of course, it never fully would.
Rosie wasn’t even sure she was going to take the pills. Would they really help her? Karen had sent her a text telling her not to expect anything for the first half an hour or so. Due to that Rosie took the pill right before she went down to dinner. By the time they ate diner, the pill would be kicking in and she could study.
It hurt so badly. He just wanted it out.
“Oh, I almost forgot,” John said fumbling around for something.
“I mean it,” the older girl said. “Please Rosie.”
“Is this the first time?” Sherlock questioned.
"I can't!" he yelled feeling panic overtake him.
“Yes,” Sherlock said sitting up. “I know it’ll hurt but it’ll be worth it.”
“Take these,” the wolf said.
“Don’t look so worried,” the wolf growled. “Give him everything you’ve got.”
Sherlock watched nervously from the bedroom door as his wolf worked.
The fox watched as Sherlock rolled over onto his stomach and spread his legs. He trusted his wolf so much. John carefully inserted the tool.
“Do you really want me to let you go?” his master asked.
“He came home yesterday,” Karen explained. “He’s been locked up for a month. I was so excited but...he just ignored me. I missed him so much and he didn’t even give me a hug.”
“I can’t,” he said shaking his head. “It’s too big.”
“I bet you have a lot to say,” the older girl said still pressing the issue. “What are you into?”
He walked up to the counter and demurely asked the saleswoman where their sexiest Halloween costumes were. She took the bunny to the back where there was floor to ceiling skimpy outfits. Sherlock bit his lip as he tried to decide on the best one to tease his handsome mate with.
He began to shake and try to pull away from the swelling knot inside of him. The larger man wrapped his arms around his lover tightly to keep him from hurting himself. He continued to knock his hips against Sherlock’s abused, cherry-red globes several more times, knot -fucking his battered hole until it became impossibly huge and not even the powerful wolf’s strength could fuck it past Sherlock’s small body’s resistance.
“You shouldn’t hang out with them!” Luna said in shock. “Karen does drugs. She only came here because she got kicked out of her old school.”
“Please daddy,” he whispered. “Give it to me.”
John lowered his voice. He didn’t want his bunny to wake up and hear what they were discussing.
“Luna dumped me,” she said unable to control the flood of words. “Last night.”
“Goodnight John,” he whispered before closing his light blue eyes.
“I don’t!” Sherlock promised. “I have to go.”
Greg, Sherlock, and John have a threesome. The two canines knot inside the small little bunny.
The strange took a step back as soon as John approached the pair.
“How was school?” her Papa’s voice came from the kitchen.
“That’s a good boy,” he said smiling. “Almost there.”
Sherlock wanted to be there. He wanted to feel the fire that shot up his spine with each thrust. His body had other ideas. His arms and legs were fighting the restraints that held him. Part of his brain was telling him he needed to get away from the pain.
John placed his fat head at Sherlock’s puffy pink lush hole. He wanted to shove in as soon as he removed the plug. The bunny detective tired to hold his muscle shut so he wouldn’t make a mess when the toy came out but that just made it hurt worse.
“I knew it!” Luna said shaking her head in disbelief. “Karen has you taking drugs.”
Sherlock took a few shaky breaths and tried to relax his inner muscles despite the pain he was in. It worked a little bit and the toy was about to slide a little further in.
The wolf wrapped his strong arm around his lover and lifted him into the air as if he weighted nothing. He nuzzled his face into his bunny’s soft chocolate curls.
“Hurry!” Sherlock cried. “I want you. I want your knot.”
“You got it John,” Greg said reaching for the tube of lube.
Sherlock didn’t retire to bed until well after midnight. He knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep. He was too worried about Rosie.
“It’s nothing,”  she said putting the bag back in her backpack.
“I need to run out,” John explained. “I need to go get something that would help. I want you to drink your bottle and try to sleep. Be a good boy for me.”
“Did you like what I did to you?” John rumbled, working the spoon in and out of his tight hole.
Perhaps a nap wouldn’t be that bad.
“You’ll have to let me and your father talk it over,” Sherlock explained. “Since it’s your first offense I don’t think we’ll be too hard on you.”
John growled and bit down harder. He knew he wasn’t going to do any damage. He was far away enough from the windpipe and any major blood vessels. He could feel some blood dripping into his mouth but not a lot.
Most eyes were on Sherlock as he walked into the party. Of course, most people wouldn’t dare of approaching him with his wolf on his arm. John was far too big and scary for many to challenge. Once in a while, another large wolf would make eyes with him but he had never actually flirted with him.
“Don’t knot in me,” the bunny begged. “It’ll kill me if you both knot in me.”
“Sleep,” he said.
“Harder!” Sherlock pleaded through his high pitched sobs. “Please! Please put my small bunny body in its place.”
“Ride me,” John said slapping his bunny's perky ass. “I know it hurts but you can’t focus on that. Focus on the pleasure, my little love.”
“Me too,” his husband admitted. “She’s changed so much.”
On the next Monday she came to school hoping to talk to her ex-girlfriend  Maybe she could apologize for making her sit with the other kids. Maybe Luna had finally calmed down.
Rosie was still hoping that Luna would come back to her. She missed her so much. She missed sitting with her in the courtyard eating lunch. She missed their late night conversations about whether or not they would get married one day. She missed Luna’s loving eyes comforting her after a bad day.
Rosie opened the back door and climbed inside. Sherlock and Apollo were waiting inside. Of course, Karen knew who he was. Everyone knew who he was but she had never met him before.
“Of course,” he said as she stood up.
“Ah -ah- ah- Jo-” Sherlock cried as he slammed in and out of him.
“I loved it!” Sherlock screamed. “I loved it so much! I love everything you do to me!”
Karen didn’t say anything as Rosie drug her out of the cafeteria and out into the courtyard. She couldn’t imagine what had gotten into her new friend. It was only when they were out of ear shot of any other students that Rosie spoke.
“Oh man,” the brunette said. “I’m to blame for this aren’t I?”
They planned to have a night together. That would give them the chance to have sex more than once. After all, they didn’t know if they would be able to do it again. John didn’t think the process would make him jealous - he was a.) much ger than Greg and b.) his bunny knew he belonged to John and John alone - and Sherlock seemed perfectly comfortable with the idea. Yet, none of them really knew how they would react to the situation.
“Is it going to be that bad?” Sherlock asked as fear grew in him.
“Next time you sneak laxatives into my coffee make sure you throw the box away,” the bunny whispered.
“Sherlock,” John called. “It’s time. Bring the thermometer.”
“Baby,” John said playing with his ears. “I know it’s a lot. Don’t hold your breath.”
“We have to let nature take its course,” the wolf said. “I can’t get it out.”
John wasn’t too sure about that.
John felt nervous about what he was getting ready to do but he knew he could do it. His little bunny was ready to take his knot. The wolf knew it hurt his lover. He would cry, scream, and beg for it to stop. Yet, he would take it and he would love it.
“Let me go!” he cried as the knot swelled inside of him.
“Luna,” he said suddenly causing John to jump. “Rosie hasn’t mentioned her and she hasn’t been over. The two of them are having trouble.”
“I guess I need to remind you and everyone else who you belong to,” John growled, voice nearly subsonic, making Sherlock feel his intent through the reverberations.
“How much for what?” Karen asked still not understanding what her friend was talking about.
“Good.” The wolf picked the young bunny up and while holding him up with one hand wrapped around his waist, used the other to rip off the rest of Sherlock's flimsy playbunny outfit, ignoring his distressed keens, completely revealing the bunny's sweet supple body. He wrapped his hands around both thighs and spread and splayed Sherlock's slutty long legs across his broad knees, smirking at how every inch of Sherlock's body, from his narrow shoulders to his slim pale thighs, was shivering nicely. A peony blush bloomed over his virginal white skin. John had never seen anyone with such flawless white skin as his little Sherlock.
Sherlock's eyes flutter instantly as John's strong scent comforted him. He looked over to see his John's handsome lined face, his deep brows furrowed together as one, his lips pressed together in a harsh white line.
“Do I still have to be punished?” he asked in weak voice.
“I want you to take me,” Sherlock said. “I know what’s coming. I can handle it.”
The bunny spit out the blanket as he felt John’s knot began to swell. It was far bigger than ever before. It felt like something was going to tear. An unbelievable pressure was building inside of him.
Sherlock whimpered pushing his face down into the bottom of the tub. His floppy ears dropped down over his eyes.
He could feel his heart pounding against his chest.
“Please,” the bunny begged. “I need…”
“Sleep,” was all John said.
John looked up from his book to see Sherlock standing in the kitchen. He wasn’t wearing a nappy. He had changed it out for a pair of pants.
Greg gave a loud shout as he felt himself let loose inside of the bunny. Sherlock cried out in pain as the knot swelled inside of him. It wasn’t nearly as big as John’s knot but it was still large.
“Not big enough inside my little bunny?” John asked, running his finger from the tail to Sherlock’s stretched hole.
“No,” he said shaking his head. “I didn’t think of it.”
“You’ve taken seven inches,” John explained. “Two more and then my knot. You don’t want me to stop. Scream it all you want but I know what you need and want.”
“Go ahead,” the wolf said.
“It’s a Chastity belt,” John stated flatly, holding up the device. “It has a butt plug that goes with it. I'll slip it into you and then lock it on.”
“It’s alright,” John grunted, pulling him in close. “Sh...just relax.”
“Fifteen,” the bunny said. “I want fifteen.”
“More?” the wolf asked laughing slightly. “You want more now? Of course, my little bunny. I’ll give you whatever you want.”
Without realizing what he was doing he began to sway and move with this music. The edge of his skirt swayed with his movements. He brought his had down and twisted his fingers in the ruffled edges.
“I mean it,” she said sitting down next to her. “What’s wrong?”
“Try and relax,” John urged lubing up his cock.
“Please take it out,” the bunny wailed. “I’m...I’m going to past out…I can’t take it!”
He started to get a bit scared when John started to smile. His lips twisted up and his sharp fangs became visible. He gripped Sherlock’s arms harder and then drove his cock in all the way. Sherlock squealed and arched his back off the bed.
Rosie zipped the bag closed and picked up her phone. What if she needed more? Math was under control for now but about her other classes? What if Math got hard again? There wasn’t any harm in getting more. She quickly sent Karen a text. It felt like forever but she did get one back.
“We need to check your temperature,” John explained setting the thermometer on the bed. “You know bunnies can go into shock easily.”
“Good boy,” John said. “I’m so proud of you. You should see yourself. You look so sexy struggling to accept what I’m giving you. Maybe I should film you someday and make you watch.”
Despite that, he didn’t want to look at Greg while he took him. Eye contact during sex was intimate to him. When he looked into John’s eyes he knew the wolf could feel every ounce of pain or pleasure he was feeling. He didn't want that with this fox.
“I’ll be easy on you,” John said. “I’m still going to give you ten but I’ll make them light.”
“It’s in,” John said releasing his grip on Sherlock’s handcuffs. “You did it. All the way in.”
Share his bunny? The idea made his tail twitch and a growl build in his throat. Sherlock was
“I’m going to put it on you,” his mate explained. “Then you are going to be a good little bunny and wear it. If I catch you trying to pick the lock you’re going to be one sorry slut. I’m going to lie in bed and do some reading. You’re going to sit next to the bed like a good little bunny and you aren’t going to move until I give you permission.”
“I know darling,” John said wagging his tail slightly. “You’re doing wonderfully. Let him have his way and then I’ll take care of you.”
The more he thought about it the more it excited him. He wanted to see Sherlock take their friend’s cock and knot. He knew it wouldn’t be a struggle for his bunny. It wouldn’t be enough for him. It would be like torture for his little pet. He’d have to move in and take Sherlock himself. He would be
Sherlock bit down on the pillow to keep from screaming as he was penetrated. It felt like someone was driving a cricket bat up his backside. He wasn’t ready to take something that large.
Rosie looked up to see the teacher waving her into his office. She didn’t want to but she had no choice. Running away wouldn't make anything better. She walked into the office shutting the door behind her.
“You’ll do wonderful,” Sherlock said giving her a little smile.
That was why he gave him a light spanking every day no matter what.  It didn't matter if he had already got spanked that day. He needed a reminder of who was in charge. As soon as he was up from his nap he would get a wooden spoon over his backside.
Sherlock crawled out of John’s lap and rolled onto his back. Tears were streaming down his face. John couldn’t help but feel bad. He knew Sherlock was just embarrassed but it had to be done. Sherlock’s body NEEDED rest.
Rosie looked at the girl in surprise. Most people knew who was but didn’t bring it up. The girl looked to be at least a year older than her. Rosie noticed right away that she was very pretty. She had long brown hair that curled around her face and bright green eyes.
John got to his feet and stood in front of Sherlock. His scary big erect cock was only a few inches away from Sherlock’s face. Without having to be told bunny opened his mouth. “Wider.” John snarled. The big bulbous head was too big. It took Sherlock shifting his lips until the cockhead popped in, filling his mouth immediately. John’s hands quickly found their place in Sherlock’s silky soft hair. He tugged at those curls impaling Sherlock further onto his manhood.
John sat the hairbrush down on the bed and gave his little bunny’s plump backside a gentle pat.
mate. He needed to be reminded who he belonged to.
Erotic asphyxiation
“Sherlock!” John shouted.
His pet sounded desperate. He wanted his prize.
Would her parents be angry at her for hanging out with someone who does drugs? Karen wasn’t hurting anyone. She kept it to herself. It was kind of like her being gay. She didn’t push it on anyone and didn’t really even talk about it.
How could he not get hard listening to Sherlock’s moans of pain?
Tears were streaming out of his eyes and down his cheeks. He was trembling under John’s touch. While he was desperate to release he was almost curious about how much his little bunny body could take.
He opened his mouth and allowed John to push the dummy in.
The wolf knew what his bunny needed. He knelt back down and wrapped his hand around his erection. He barely had to touch it before his little bunny cock exploded. Sherlock let out a long cry as his body was rocked with an intense orgasm.
“You’re as lose you’re going to get,” the wolf explained. “Try and relax baby.”
“Do you think he would let me take him?” the fox questioned.
John flicked off the light before leaving his daughter alone.
It felt so good as the rod pressed into his prostate. Waves of pleasures spread through him. He mewled in disappointment when John slid the wooden spoon free.
“John!” he cried looking up at his master. “I need the bathroom.”
“You know you loved it,” John smirked, playing with his soft, floppy ear.
“I’m so sorry,” Rosie said. “She had no right to say anything like that.”
“I’m going first?” Greg asked sitting on the bed.
Figging
“What do we do?” he asked.
“You don’t scare me,” Sherlock said gaining his confidence back. “My boyfriend is bigger than you.”
The people that were watching were starting to cheer them. People were starting to scream and laugh. Sherlock tried not to think about them. He needed to pretend they weren’t there. This was just between the two of them.
Please sign and return.
Yes! He wanted that. He wanted to be filled with water, tied up, and left. He wanted to be broken!
John hit him lightly but quickly. He didn't want to drag it out. The poor bunny had already gotten a hard spanking that day.
He placed the bowl and the regular thermometer on the bedside table. He wanted it in each in case anything went wrong.
She angrily stomped off to her class determined not to let her ex-girlfriend ruin her life. She only took a few steps before she heard her backpack strap rip. With a thud, the back slipped from her back onto the floor. She growled as she picked up the bag. Just what she needed! Now, she was going to have to ask her Dad or Papa for a new bag. Her day couldn’t get any better.
“That’s alright,” the wolf said. “Too much might irritate your stomach right now. I have something else for you.”
“Two more goes,” John promised as his knot began to deflate. “And then I’ll let you take a little nap.”
“Alright silly,” he said nodding towards the bed. “Lie down on your stomach.”
Karen started smoking a year ago and had struggled to stop. Her social worker was trying to help her but she knew it was hard for Karen. It helped her deal with the stress of life.
“Thanks by the way,” Rosie said putting her head on the pillow.
John didn’t need to be told twice. He leaned his head over and bit down hard enough to draw blood. The bunny cried out in pleasure and pain as the fangs sank in. A little trail of blood flowed from the cut.
As his orgasm approached he did forget. All he could think about was Sherlock's insides squeezing around him. He focused his sharp hearing on listening to Sherlock’s moans and cries.
Karen promised her seven pills for the twenty pounds. She knew that was only a week’s worth if she kept taking it every day. She only got ten pounds a week for allowance. It wasn’t nearly enough to keep buying them. Perhaps she would have to cut it down.
John looked over Sherlock’s shoulder at the fox. Greg looked slightly worried at what was going on.
“What if...what if I can’t do it?” the bunny asked. “What if it’s too much?”
Sherlock tried to focus on letting his muscles relax. FIghting it just made it so much worse. He wanted it after all. He loved taking his wolf’s massive cock. He just didn't feel comfortable taking it in front of all these people. What choice did he really have? He might as well enjoy it.
John got up from the bed and covered him up.
By the time John came home from work, he was a mess. The wolf walked into their bedroom to find his sick bunny whimpering in bed. Sherlock had a hand wrapped around his stomach and a hand holding his ears over his eyes.
John thought about giving his lover some space. Should he be so hard on him when he was carrying his pups? Yes. He had to. He had to keep his bunny in order.
The fluffy bunny felt like he’d been submerged in ice. His body was trembling uncontrollably. He couldn’t hold himself up on his hands and knees. He fell to the floor of the tub.
John placed his hands on Sherlock’s sides as he got into position behind Sherlock. The bunny gave a nervous whimper as John’s massive 12” cock pressed against his small hole. The wolf growled at the noise. He loved it when his bunny was so submissive.
To John’s surprise, his bunny agreed right away to a threesome. He was excited to show off what a good little bunny and good fuck he was. John constantly praised him during sex and told him no other bunny could do what he could. He couldn’t wait to show it off to their fox friend. He was going to be amazing!
“Ride me,” John ordered.
“Can I have a pillow?” Sherlock questioned.
“Please,” the younger girl begged. “Just once?”
He was in no mood to mess around with prepping his bunny. His cock was already rock hard. If he didn’t get inside of him he was going to lose his mind. He put the huge broad head against the tight little hole and started pushing in.
Sherlock snorted. He wanted it in a glass but he didn’t think he could sit up and drink it. If John gave it to him in a bottle he could lie down on the pillow and relax while he drank it.
“Joh-” Sherlock started as he saw the vicious and possessive look on his wolf’s face. He knew. At that moment a sharp shiver slivered down his spine and he knew. His wolf was in a predatory mood and while it wasn’t Sherlock’s fault and deep down his wolf knew that John’s animal instincts and lust still needed to be satisfied. The bunny knew his wolf, knew what John needed. John’s inner beast demanded a show of ownership of his bunny.  The wolf
“Don’t worry,” the wolf said kissing his ears. “You’ll be fine.”
When she got to school was surprised to see Luna wasn’t there. It wasn’t like her to miss school. She never missed Wednesdays. That was the day they stayed after school for violin lessons. It was one of their favorite things to do together. If she did miss school she normally texted her. A glance at her phone on the way to lunch told she hadn’t received a message. She quickly typed one up and sent it.
“Feeling better?” John questioned, setting his book aside.
“Naughty boy,” he said feeling his knot start to deflate. “How many should you get for being such a good boy?”
Tears began to fill his eyes as his body was overwhelmed by the sensations he was feeling. The cramps weren’t backing off. They were starting to turn into one long pain.
Rosie knew her girlfriend’s needs were important, but she had needs too. She wanted to sit with the other kids. She hadn’t had a chance to talk to Jade or Marcus in weeks. She knew Marcus was struggling in science class and she wanted to see if he needed help. Yet, she couldn’t leave Luna on her own.
“Try and relax,” John instructed.
“For what?” Karen asked sitting down on the edge of the bed.
“Something on your mind?” he questioned.
Karen had a shocked and slightly embarrassed look on her face. Luna quickly realized what she had said. She picked up her tray and backpack before quickly running away from the table.
The medical tool always seemed to hurt his bunny no matter how many times he used it on him.
“Sherlock,” John warned. “You know the rules. I’ve already spanked you for being bad. You know what happens if I have to spank you twice for the same offense.”
“Is it true?” Rosie couldn’t help but ask.
“I can do that,” John said setting the device down on the bed.
Of course, she knew she was dead the second her parents smelled her.  She stunk of cigarette smoke. Even after she changed her clothes she still smelt. She needed a shower to get rid of the smell. There was no way she was going to get it past them when she went down for dinner.
The wolf opened the container that held the small suppositories. He took out three before shutting the lid. There was no reason to put it off. John lifted his leg and placed it on the closed toilet. He pushed his tail out of the way and slowly pushed the first one in.
“I promise,” Sherlock said.
Panic began to grip him. Was John going to take him right in front of all these people? A pretty rosy flush spread over his face.
“Yes,” Sherlock said in a broken small voice. John rolled his limp body onto his side. “I’m just so sore.”
“How is it?” Sherlock questioned.
“Cum,” the wolf demanded, moving his cock as fast and as hard as he could with his knot.
Sherlock tried to focus on the pleasure the knot was bringing him. It was pressed into his prostate hard. He let out a whimper and tried to relax in John’s hold.
“Delicious.” John rumbled, stroking admiringly the lush milky-white globes, how they were so completely smooth, firm, yet incredibly supple. “You have the most remarkably beautiful ass, my bunny.”
37 Celsius = 98.6
Sherlock started to scream as the pain overwhelmed him. He was twisting his head and pulling on his ears hard. He felt like he was going to pass out.
for his knot.
“Just make sure to take a good long shower tonight,” her Dad instructed. “Use lots of shampoo.”
John had something planned. He knew Sherlock would hate it at first but he would let him do it.  He loved everything he did to him. He growled as he watched Greg start fucking him hard and fast. Sherlock threw back his curly head and shrieked. He was clutching the sheets for everything he had.
John gripped his lover’s hips as he pushed inside. He knew he should be taking slow but he couldn’t stop himself. It was so tight and his need to reproduce was scratching at the back of his head. He slammed the rest of his cock in hard.
They were betting on him. That sent chills up his back. Shame flooded the little bunny at the mere thought of what was going on. All these people were watching him get fingers jammed up his butt.
After assuring her that she was going to be ok Karen did leave her side. Luna was wrong. Karen was a nice girl who just had a problem. She wasn’t trying to mean to her. She seemed like a really nice girl. She was going out of her way to be nice to Rosie.
“The whip,” Sherlock said. “The one you don’t think I know about in the closet.”
“It hurts pretty bad,” the bunny explained as more cock was pushed into him. “He isn’t as as you but...it’s...it’s different. And little prep...”
The bunny reached up to touch the belt. He didn’t fight it. He simply rested his fingers against the leather. That’s when it happened. It seemed like he was dying as his orgasm ripped through him. Every nerve was on edge as his body began to shake uncontrollable.
“The head is barely in,” John said snapped. “Stop being stupid. You’ve taken much bigger toys before. My knot is way bigger.”
Sherlock nodded, trying to force his body to relax. He knew it would feel good once his body relaxed. The burning intensified as John slid further and further inside of him. The bunny gave a long cry before collapsing into the rug. He knew there was no getting away from his lover.
“It burns,” Sherlock whimpered. “It feels like it’s tearing me apart. I’m scared to even breath hard. Every little move sends ways of pain through me. It’s a little bit better than when you put it in but it’s still bad.”
Well, if that was how she wanted to be then Rosie could be that way too.
“Almost! And this, it's different somehow,” he whimpered.
The little bunny’s backside was turning bright red under the hairbrush. It clear to John that there would be some bruising later.
“It...it’s alright,” Sherlock stammered as his felt his heart began to race.
Sherlock smiled weakly. He wanted his John. Suddenly
“You gave them to me,” Rosie said shaking her head in confusion."I NEED them. You have to give them to me."
A nervous-looking squirrel ran up to them and handed John a bottle of lotion. The small creature quickly ran off, giving Sherlock a look of pity.
The wolf and bunny closed their eyes. Their union might be a strange one, but it worked for them.
With that an no other warning, Sherlock suddenly felt a sharp smack strike his upturned ass. He squealed loudly at the painful impact.
“Are you ok?” she asked rushing to Rosie’s side. “I saw you run in here and it looked like you were crying.”
“Forty celsius,” John said sounding worried. “Far too high. We need to cool you down.”
Relax? How was he supposed to relax? He had a dildo shoved up his ass and had just been given some mystery pills.
“Good boy,” John grunted. He took both broad hands and pried apart Sherlock’s ripe globes and shuddered from a hot wave of lust by what he saw. There, trickling from the tiny tight pink hole was slick. Sherlock, his lovely little omega bunny,  had gotten wet from his spanking.
“Done,” the wolf murmured, proud. “Now get on the floor.”
John was having his Friday drink with his fox friend. His fellow canine seemed awful interested in his lover.
Rosie nodded and starting eating. She didn’t want to think about what her punishment would be. She hated getting in trouble.
Rosie tried to follow the conversation but found herself unable to. All she could think about was Luna. Was it fair to put her in a position that she was uncomfortable with? Maybe not but she still had no right to blow up at Karen like that. She could have just walked away. That would have caused less trouble. She was going to have to talk to her girlfriend about her behavior.
Rosie assured Karen that everything was alright between the two of them but she needed to focus on her math. She turned her phone off so there wasn’t any chance of being interrupted and tried to focus on her work.
“Please…” his bunny whispered. “I’m...I’m so sensitive now.”
“Yes,” he said. “I loved it.”
Sherlock nodded letting his floppy ears fall down over his eyes. He knew John meant that. He wasn’t going to give him any mercy. He willed every muscle in his body to relax.
Her parents were already sitting down to some Chinese takeaway.
The detective decided that maybe he was better off helping his lover than worrying. He crossed over to the sink and started placing dishes in the warm water.
John dipped one of the flannels into the ice water and soaked it. He pulled it out and squeeze the extra water out. He brought it down to Sherlock's back and began to gently rub his skin.
The bunny felt John’s broad hands, hot and possessive, squeezing and kneaded the firm, taut flesh. “You’ve been a naughty bunny and you know it.” John’s voice was low and predatory in his ear. “You wanted to act like a child, teasing every cock in the room, tarting your ripe little ass around and giving everyone a show. Well if you want to act like a slut I’ll treat you like one.”
“Forget the thermometer during your spanking tonight,” John grunted. “That isn’t bad enough. I’m going to force two tablespoons of Castor oil down your throat. I’m not going to mix it with anything. You’ll gag but you’ll drink it.  Then I’m going to plug you and leave you tied up. Then when you’re begging to go I’ll spank you long and hard. Maybe I’ll even cane you.”
John started to push his swelling knot inside of his bunny. Sherlock cried out and tried to pull away from the expanding ball. John growled and put his hands on his lover’s shoulders. He held him down against the carpet.
“Please handcuff me,” Sherlock tried again in a softer voice. “I want it but I’m afraid I’ll fight if I’m not handcuffed.”
“Good bunny,” John said as he walked into the bathroom. “I think two quarts will be plenty for today.”
Rosie watched in shock as her friend lit her cigarette and began to smoke. She had never seen anyone smoke before.
The little bunny could feel his orgasm building. It felt like John’s cock was never leaving his prostate. The tender spot in him was being tormented.
He let out a sigh of relief at the sound of a beeping noise.
The babies are here.
“Hard and fast,” the bunny begged shaking his perfectly round rear end. “Please!”
“I don’t belong to anyone,” Sherlock said shaking his head. “I’m my own bunny.”
“My my,” a dark thick voice drifted into his ears.
Sherlock moaned in pleasure as he felt his fluffy tail being gently pulled and rubbed. It helped to distract from the pain he was in. He was experiencing never-ending pain. It felt like someone had his guts in their hands and was squeezing with all their strength.
John dark eyes narrowed as he turned his eyes on Sherlock. He knew Sherlock had done nothing wrong. The poor bunny looked as if he expected the wolf to jump on him and rip out of his throat. He was trembling slightly. Yet, he felt threatened. Another wolf had come far too close to his bunny.
As more brutal inches of that searing length was slowly shoved into his resisting body, a long squeal slid out between his tightly pressed lips. Despite all of the embarrassment of the situation, he felt his hole producing more slick himself starting to harden. He was getting taken by his wolf in front of a bunch of strangers.
“Sleep,” John said kissing the top of his head in between his fluffy soft ears.
“Perfect,” he said looking at the thermometer.
It seemed to work. After a few minutes, Sherlock released the pillow from his mouth and relaxed his head against it.
“I still can’t believe you two are together,” the fox said before lowering his voice. “How do...well you know?”
“You just can’t adjust to this can you?” he rumbled amusingly as he pushed it fully in.
As much as John was trying not to panic he couldn’t help it. His stomach was starting to grumble and his insides were twisting. He cried out in pain and squeezed his eyes shut.
“Get on your hands and knees,” John instructed.
“You’re welcome,” Karen said even though she didn’t mean it.
“Are we ready?” Sherlock questioned.
“Yep,” she said nodding. “Eric James.”
“I like it!” he admitted as tears streamed down his pretty flushed face. “I want it!”
“Fine,” Karen said handing over the cigarette. “Easy does it. Don’t pull too hard.”
“No,” the wolf growled in as gentle a tone as he could manage mid-rut, moving his knot. “You love it, little one, and you know it. If it didn't feel amazing why would your tiny bunny cock still be hard.”
“More,” Sherlock moaned. “Please.”
“No,” the bunny whimpered shaking his head.
“Alright,” she said allowing him to put her books on her desk. “I’m happy you’re studying but everyone needs sleep.”
“Have you had any electrolyte mix?” the doctor questioned. “There is some in the frig.”
Rosie could hear the nervousness in her friend's voice. She was clearly worried about her but she didn't care. She had what she wanted.
It felt like he was being torn in two!
“Alright,” he said. “We’re going to put the harness on now.”
“I’ll tell your parents,” she warned. “Look at you Rosie you need help. I’ve never seen you so worked up. You need help.”
“John…” Sherlock whimpered. “It stings. It always stings.”
His lover looked at him with nervous eyes as he fumbled with the bag.
The young girl picked up her math book, notebook, and other supplies before shoving them in her backpack. She felt like her heart was breaking in two. She pushed her head under her pillow and started to cry freely.
When they reached the school Sherlock wished her a good day and she was off like the wind. Perhaps he was being silly. John told him he worried far too much about her.
“Stop pulling on your ears,” the doctor said. “You’re going to hurt yourself. Maybe you need a proper spanking.”
Greg raised an eyebrow but pulled out. Sherlock let out a frustrated cry and began to shake his head from side to side.  John laid down next to his lover and kissed him on the head.
His body locked up as another orgasm rocked his body. He curled up in a ball as his body felt completely drained.
John tried to take Sherlock’s advice as another wave of cramps hit him. Sherlock could tell John wasn’t going to take care of his erection. He dropped his hand down to wrap it out his cock and started moving back and forth on the large knot as much as he could.
“Can you give it a break?” Luna suddenly snapped.
“Why don’t you call your parents and see if you can go to my house?” Rosie questioned. “My parents won’t mind.”
John sat down between Sherlock’s leg and picked up the thermometer. He quickly lubed up the device and placed it at Sherlock’s entrance. He smiled as he started pushing the probe inside. Part of him was excited about seeing his lover struggle to take the device. He knew it wouldn’t do any damage.
Yes. They were made for each other.
Math! She had forgotten about that work she didn’t do. Oh well, she had to make up some excuse for her teacher. She never turned work in late. Maybe she wouldn’t kill her.
“No break,” the bunny begged. “I don’t want a break. I want you.”
“Come here,” John said pulling Sherlock down towards his chest.
"Can you feel them yet?" he asked.
Why did he fight it? Why did he deny it?
Lestrade couldn’t believe what he was seeing! A small pale bunny with the most incredibly perky ass was kneeling over the couch getting some rather rough treatment. The fox couldn’t imagine how uncomfortable the thermometer was. It looked massive inside the bunny’s tight hole. Then again he really didn’t understand how John’s massive knot could fit in there. Granted, he had never seen but he knew it had to be very large.
Mrs. Gladden was really understanding about her math homework. She had given her an extension but warned her not to do it again.  Despite everything Rosie was feeling pretty good until she got to Creative writing. Luna was in that class as well.
Sherlock did his best to relax as his inner muscles rippled and spasmed as John started to fuck up into him. Sherlock cried out in pain as he was battered into over and over. He pushed the pain to the back of his mind. He only wanted to think about the pleasure. Each trust was nailing his ruined prostate.
“Not stopping,” he said. “Thank you for being strong and giving it to me.”
“It needs to be this way,” the wolf said taking control of the situation. “If you wear one then I can give you something to help you sleep.”
John did like to bite. Sometimes he broke the skin, but he never did any damage to his bunny. It would kill him if he hurt his friend.
John smiled as the two of them drifted off to sleep. It seemed their relationship was going to work out just fine.
“Not a chance” John growled, groaning in appreciation when he lifted Sherlock’s frilly skirt.  “I’m going to make sure everyone knows who you belong to.”
“You need to relax,” he ordered. “I might actually hurt you if you don’t.”
When Rosie’s ride pulled up she couldn’t believe her eyes. She knew Rosie got picked up by parents but she had no idea she had a private driver. It all seemed so fancy to Karen. She had an oyster card and was used to taking the bus.
Rosie was excited for lunchtime to come around. She needed to talk to Karen. There was no way she going to be able to keep up with her math class anymore. It was too hard! With all of her advanced classes, she was getting overwhelmed.  She needed some help.
bunny. Yet, he couldn’t help but feel turned on. He liked the idea of showing his little bunny off. Sherlock was capable of taking so much.
Rosie watched in wonder as Karen smoked. The smoke looked so beautiful as it flew from her mouth. It made long swirls in the air.
The fox smirked as he began to pound inside of the bunny tight little ass. The bunny wailed and clung to his lover's broad chest and shoulders. The most intense pressure was building inside of him. It felt like their knots were starting to grow. They were both going to knot!
The bunny whimpered as his wolf wrapped a hand around his small erection. He gave it a few gentle pulls. His ears perked up as Sherlock’s breathing began to change. The tension and worry were drifting out of him.
“Fine,” Rosie said hanging her backpack up on its hook by the door.
“Good boy,” John said before returning to bed. “Now relax. You’re allowed to simulate yourself on the plug. Ride it if you want.”
“I know,” the other girl said. “You’re taking them on your own.”
Sherlock gave a resigned whimper. He knew fighting with his wolf would do no good. The doctor knelt down next to Sherlock and began to lubricate a rather large nozzle. He put the nozzle at his bunny’s entrance and began to push.
The three of them lay locked together for what seemed like an eternity. After an hour the bunny let out a sigh of relief as he felt the two knots deflate and slip from him.
“Marcus and Karen,” Rosie answered wondering why it mattered.
“Take it,” John commanded as he started to push inside.
“Can I see a picture?” Rosie questioned.
No! She wanted to keep going.
“I’m trying,” he cried out.
“You should sit with us more,” Marcus said. “I think you and Karen would get along great.”
The motion caused Sherlock’s insides to twist in discomfort. It really was starting to hurt. He needed to empty the substances his body was desperate to release. He curled up against John and whimpered in pain.
“No,” Sherlock whimpered. “I love it. It just hurts.”
“So clean inside,” John said as his finger easily slipped fully inside. “I love a nice clean boy.”
“No!” Sherlock said shaking his head rapidly. “No John!”
“You’re doing great,” the wolf said as the device slid free of Sherlock’s tight entrance. “We’ll have to keep an eye on that. It won’t be so bad the second time.”
I saved this as a draft instead of posting it ages ago. I am forever doing that. Sorry!
Her pencil flew across the paper as she solved equation after equation. She liked math and it took her mind off Luna. She had texted her girlfriend over an hour ago and she hadn’t gotten back to her. That wasn’t like her at all.
“What happened?” Rosie asked.
“Despite the pain?” the wolf said surprised by the statement.
John reached over and picked up a rather large dildo. It was large and thick. It was going to make little bunny cry long and hard but he would love it. He quickly dumped a large amount of lube on it.
“If you feel overheated tell me at once,” John ordered. “I’ll stop and get some cold water on you.”
Those words burnt into her mind. What was she going to do? She couldn’t show her parents. They would never forgive her for this. She was going to have to figure something out.
… and yet… Sherlock bit his bottom lip, consideringly. The bunny rather liked when John yelled at him. In fact, he loved when John was incited by something Sherlock did. It turned him on. Was he messed up in the head? Was he mad for getting turned on by an enraged wolf?
She reached down and unzipped the zipper. She could hear a little metal click as each tooth disconnected. She knew it was wrong. She had gotten the pills to help her with her math. She didn't need them.
“Most thirteen year olds don’t want to be around a new baby,” Sherlock said. “At least not after the first few days. That’s all the more reason for her to be visiting more.”
“Of course he won’t,” Sherlock said pouting. "I know you’re worried but Lestrade is my friend. He isn’t going to hurt me.”
“I like Anime,” Karen said her face lighting up at the news. “What else?”
Rosie took the cigarette into her hand and place it inside her mouth. It tasted awful right away but she inhaled on it anyway. She began to cough violently and held the cigarette away from her. Karen made to take the cigarette back but Rosie pulled her hand away.
“Do you want me to stop?” the wolf growled.
“Uh huh,” she said with a shrug.
John almost bellowed, mimicking the surge of volcanic lust that hit him when he saw his bunny. Sherlock, that sexy little tart, was wearing a complete whorish outfit, and the way Sherlock was coyly looking at all the hungry looks the men were throwing him, bouncing around as he looked for John, looking like the most delicious cocktease he was.
He began to cry and twisted away. He tried to pull away but John just pulled harder on the belt around his neck. The bunny whimpered as the hold around his neck tightened.
His bunny simply whimpered as he explored his insides. The wolf removed his finger and looked at it. There was a good amount of blood was on the tip. A wave of guilt hit him. He’d made his bunny bleed. He’d never bled like that before. Something didn’t feel right. He lifted the blanket and covered his lover up.
John laughed a little bit as he hurried to the bathroom.
“I promise you’ll love this,” he said reaching over for a bottle of lube. “Daddy even has a new toy for you.”
John felt like he was going to run out of oxygen as he claimed what was his. His lungs were starting to burn. Sherlock was arching and writhing on his monster cock.
“I don’t think so,” Mr. Green looking up at her. “I want you to write an apology letter to her. Maybe that will make her feel better.”
Lestrade looked down at Sherlock’s red and sore looking behind. There were already welts starting to rise above his supple skin. He couldn’t help but look at the thermometer that was sticking out his tight little hole. It read thirty-nine degrees Celsius.
Sherlock let out a pain filled whimper as his wolf started pushing in. He could already feel that his cock was bigger. He was grateful that John had been generous with the lube.
He needed to follow John’s rules. He wanted to make sure John understood he was safe. John would always satisfy him in every possible way, but if John brought Greg back well he knew he would welcome taking both their knots again.
Rosie wanted to make her friend feel better. It hurt her to see anyone feeling sad.
“Do you want me to stop?” John nibbled on the soft earlobe. John had incredible control and even in a near-rut, he was able to make sure his mate wanted it.
Sherlock could feel each inch as it claimed him pushing deep into him. Claiming him.
“I knew you wouldn’t forget,” the bunny giggled. “I’m plenty ready. I want to get it over with. I have some messages from Lestrade. I think he might have a case that would interest me.”
“No. ”the wolf said. “You had such a hard time taking it. You need to leave it in.”
Greg couldn’t believe the bunny was begging to be hit faster. He began to wonder just how much Sherlock could take. John made it sound like he could handle
“Do you want to cum?” the wolf questioned.
Sherlock trembled under him as he slowly pulled out. His walls were so tender and sensitive. He cried out in discomfort as John pushed in hard. It was only on the third repeat of this motion that John hit his prostate.
Rosie only had twenty pounds to her name. It was every dime from her piggy bank.
Rosie smiled at Karen’s sudden mood change.  She jumped from the steps and headed off to the office. Rosie ran to catch up with her friend.
John loses his temper with his bunny and gives him a rather hard beating.
things.”
If it wasn’t for the massive nozzle inside of him Sherlock knew he would already be making a mess. His inner muscles were trying in vain to push it out. His wolf was holding onto the end to make sure it didn’t come out before it was time.
The fox looked down at the bunny. He was trembling under their touches. He decided to keep pushing forward. John seemed to know how much his bunny he could take.
“That’s good,” she said unsure of what to say.
“No,” she said shaking her head.
“Please take it out,” Sherlock begged.
There was NO way she telling them that Karen smoked cigarettes all the time. They would never let them hang out again.
He only waited for a few minutes before John walked into the bathroom. He was holding a small bag in his hand. He knelt down next to the bathtub.
“Much better,” John said after checking the device. “Thirty-seven celsius. So much better. Time to take it out.”
“Sh,” he rumbled lowly,  nibbling on his ear. “It’s just my knot. You can handle it.”
Greg brought down the next two hits fast. The bunny arched his back and cried out from the blows. John rose from his chair and walked over to the pair. He glanced down at the thermometer. 38 celsius. His bunny was doing just fine.
John took a seat in a chair by the bed. He could see his bunny’s pretty face as he was taken. It would be interesting to see it from this angle. He wouldn’t be distracted by his own pleasure. He could fully enjoy watching Sherlock’s face twist with pleasure and pain.
him. Sherlock wanted him in front of all those people. He wanted them to know who he belonged to. He had consented to this before but now he
Sherlock giggled a little despite the situation. Maybe coming to the part was a good idea after all.
He opened the tube and dropped a large amount onto his cock. He didn’t want to hurt the tight bunny. Two canine knots would hurt another canine. It would tear the bunny apart if they weren’t careful.
“Five pounds says he screams and passes out,” another stranger added.
“I’ll be right back,” John said.
Sherlock suddenly looked nervous. He looked away from John letting his ears flop over his eyes.
“But what’s the point of the thing?” The pale bunny swallowed as he took in more details about the device.
He sat the flannel down on Sherlock’s upper back before checking on the thermometer. He hit the reset button. He went back to washing Sherlock’s body with the flannel The pair sat quietly until the device beeped.
“No,” he said shaking his head. “I want you to sit flat on your butt on the floor. I want that toy pushing into you. I don’t want you to forget it’s there.”
The bunny smiled as he fell to this knees on the rug. His short fluffy tail wiggled a bit as he got into position. John knelt down behind Sherlock as he threw his clothes to the floor. He wasted no time grabbing a bottle of lube from the coffee table.
The wolf lined the toy up and started pushing in.Sherlock’s mouth dropped open as he felt the massive head start into his body. The tight passage clamped down around the large intrusion.
“Just school stuff,” his daughter said.
“Tell Lestrade what’s happening,” John instructed, picking up a bottle of lube from the coffee table.
“Give me a second,” Rosie said trying to catch her breath. “I want to try again.”
Was she really going to skip class over this? She’d never skipped class in her life. She was going to have to get over it. If things really were over with Luna she wasn’t going to be able to skip Creative writing forever.
Cramp!
“That’s a good boy,” the wolf encouraged. “Take it. Don’t think about the pain. Focus on the feeling of the metal as it slides into you.”
“Good boy,” John said, releasing his hold on Sherlock. “I know it hurts. It’s supposed to hurt. The pain will remind you who you belong to. You'll be sore until the next time I take you. You won’t forget who fucked you.”
“It hurts,” John admitted. “I don’t know how you do this.”
“No!” Sherlock said shaking his head. “You can’t! You could really hurt me. You’re going down but you’re not down far enough.”
Sherlock tried to rise to his hands and knees but found himself unable to. He just didn't have the strength.
Everything was going well with the sitting arrangement for about a week before trouble popped up. Of course, Rosie knew it was only a matter of time. Luna could be so difficult sometimes. Of course, Rosie knew she wasn't too blame. She couldn't help the fact she had social anxiety. The two of them were sitting with Marcus, Karen, and a few other friends when it happened.
“This is going to be your new training dildo,” the wolf explained. “You’re going to wear it all the time until you can take it without lube.”
It didn’t feel like it was ever going to stop. The stars in front of his eyes danced across his vision as he struggled to stay conscious.
John released him as he went limp under him. He looked down at the nasty looking bite on his neck. He reached over to the bedside table and fetched a tissue. He carefully cleaned the blood from the wound. He reached under his bunny’s body and touched his rosy hard erection.
For a moment Greg wasn’t there. He could feel his cock lodged inside of him but emotionally he wasn’t there. It was just the wolf and bunny locked together in a loving embrace.
“I’m coming!” John cried pushing in one final time.
Sherlock didn’t care. He got a spanking every night before bed no matter what. Bunnies were prone to going into shock from rough treatment. When they had first started having sex John was extremely worried about hurting him. He started using a rather large thermometer on him to make sure his temperature didn’t spike. The probe was five inches long and one inch in diameter. At first, Sherlock had cried and begged him not use it. John insisted on using it a lot. After a short time, he began to love it.
“May I cum Daddy?” he asked.
He needed to check in with his bunny. He was already panting heavily and seemed a little overwhelmed.
“Sherlock…” he said. “Are you sure you’re a boy?”
John goes into a rut, which means very rough sex for Sherlock.
“I don’t care,” Sherlock snorted. “I’m not wearing
“Open your insides,” the doctor instructed. “Allow the water in.”
“Cramp,” he answered. “It’s a small one but they’re starting.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest. He normally only got ten for maintenance. Twenty was a lot! It didn’t take long for the bunny to figure out what his wolf was doing. He was showing him off. John wanted to show Lestrade just how much he could take. He felt his ass twitch at the thought.
“Yes,” she said. “I asked Karen to get me some. That’s why she came over today.”
The bunny needn't have worried. At that exact instant, a heavy hand was clasped around to his shoulder, harsh and unyielding. He let out a gasp of surprise and jerked away out of instinct.
Happy with that Rosie put her phone away. She lite up one of her cigarettes and took a deep drag from it. She smiled as smoke filled her lungs and went back to studying. She didn't think she needed to ask for cigarettes. Karen was pretty nice about giving her cigarettes when she wanted them.
“No,” Sherlock said, shaking his head. “Don’t want that!”
John was standing in the sitting clutching his belt when he heard someone knocking at the door. He walked over and opened the door. He smiled when he saw Lestrade standing there. He was carrying a small overnight bag.
“STOP!” Sherlock screamed before hiding his head in the pillow. “How much more? I can’t take it!”
Sherlock shivered. “No.”
“Yes!” the bunny cried. “I need your knot.”
“John!” the bunny cried as the wolf’s knot swelled inside of him.
“Stop!” the bunny cried pulling on his restraints. “It isn’t going to fit!”
Tears filled his eyes as he tried to accept the cramping.
“How much?” Roise asked in a shaky voice.
“I was just making conversation,” the other wolf said, trying to act casual, clearly not eager to get into a fight with the broader, stronger wolf, yet not quite willing to give up such a pretty quarry as the young bunny. “Don’t worry.”
Sherlock moved forward enough to dislodge the toy from his passage.
“Yes,” Sherlock said through his tears.
He had thrown a fit about eating dinner again. Normally, John just would let him get away with it but it seemed the wolf had other plans. He needed to make sure his little bunny was eating. He had ordered Sherlock to go to their room and wait for him.
“On your knees,” the wolf ordered as his ears twitched with excitement.
“Hi,” Rosie said quickly replacing the pill in the bag.
Rosie frowned at Karen’s words. She had never mentioned her parents before. She assumed they didn’t get along.
With a virile deep growl of satisfaction John drove his cock back in, setting a punishing pace at the thought of his little bunny's slick hole acclimating it to the giant dick simply because John's pheromones were telling Sherlock's body to do so. The wolf couldn't help it. He started fucking his little bunny harder. And Harder. It was different. Sherlock was different inside for sure. The bunny flailed and writhed, his back arched and struggling as his ass was slammed deeper and deeper, so deep. His hole and body rammed roughly over and over and over. He slowly realized he was definitely taking his cock easier. Sherlock was starting to pant and whimper and move back against his cock.
His lover reached into the shopping bag and pulled out a white dummy. Sherlock knew putting up a fight wouldn’t help him but he couldn’t just accept it! After all, he was a grown man. He wasn’t going to willing let someone shove something like
“I know,” Sherlock said pulling off the bottle. “I don’t want anymore.”
“Onto the wedge then,” John said patting the chunk of foam.
The massive bollocks and knot were covered in the wolf’s coarse earth-brown pubic hairs, making a delicious sight as they knocked ruthlessly against Sherlock’s ripe ass, which jiggled and bounced partly from the harsh impacts.
Sherlock yelped in surprise as John drug him off the couch and onto the floor. The wolf forced the bunny flat on the floor and laid on top of him. He put his hands on Sherlock and held him tight to the floor.
The next night Rosie was determined to just do her homework and go to bed. She needed to get a little extra sleep. Her felt like she was pushing it to the limit.
Good old Marcus. He was always quick to protect Luna.
“No,” John said with a growl of pleasure, petting his lover’s fluffy hair. “You don’t want me to stop. I know it.”
John made a face as soon as his daughter sat down next to him. She reeked of cigarette smoke. He glanced at Sherlock across the table. He wasn’t looking at him. He was already looking at his daughter with a raised eyebrow.
“Come on,” John said hanging the enema bag up. “Don’t be a cry baby. I’m going to fill up your tiny insides. You’re going to hold it for a bit and then release. We do this every week.”
He started to move again trying not to think about the painful cramps that were starting to build. Every time he would get a cramp he would slam harder into his lover. Sherlock didn’t seem to mind. Tears were streaming down his face but John knew they were tears of pleasure.
The bunny would do anything to make his big handsome wolf happy. If it meant doing something he hated he would do it. That didn’t stop him whining though. All week he pouted and drove John up a wall.
“I know,” Karen said with a shrug. “That's why I don't want you on them.”
Lestrade smirked and sat down in John’s chair. He dropped his bag by his feet. He had no idea what was going to happen but he couldn’t wait for it.
“No!” Sherlock cried trying to pull away. “I’m too sore!”
“She didn’t ask Karen for cigarettes,” he said. “Karen is a smoker. I could just smell it on her when I picked them up.”
Sherlock peeked his head into the bedroom and watched John with interest. The wolf bent down and opened the bag. The bunny reached forward and gave the wolf’s tail a playful pull. John laughed as he pulled out the thermometer.
“Take off your clothes and get in the tub,” John growled. “You aren’t getting away with this.”
“No problem,” John said. “When you’re ready you can get the wooden spoon.”
“It’s alright,” Marcus said stepping in. “Some people just aren’t big on conversation.”
John heard Sherlock rummaging through one of the kitchen drawers. The bunny walked into the sitting room holding the wooden spoon. He pulled his pants down before lying down across his lover’s lap.
“I know,” he said as his mate trembled uncontrollably under his touch. “You can take it. I promise you nothing bad is going to happen. I’m a doctor. I know what you can take.”
It was too late however. He starting crying heavily as he tried to pull away from the two canines. He cried out in bright pain as the feeling of the knots stretching him, splitting him wide open, fucking deep inside of him. The bunny couldn't help trying to thrash away from the violent pain-pleasure.
“I know,” she said looking down at her hands. “Do my parents have to know?”
John would get mad surely. He would yell at him, as he often did when Sherlock did annoying things  He went back to remove the outfit. Surely, it was a crazy idea to wear something like this.
Little did the wolf know but in that short moment when John told Sherlock that he would be attending the party and then told him to go out and find a costume,  wear that the little bunny hatched a plan. Sherlock knew why John loved these type parties. He got to hang out with his soldier mates and their wives who all loved to show off for the handsome ex wolf-soldier. Sherlock hated them because for four hours John’s attention would be away from him and it distressed the little rabbit so very much.
“I’ll do it,” Sherlock said shaking. “I’m scared but I’ll do it.”
After dinner Rose went up to her room to work on her homework. John and Sherlock started to clear the table and wash the dishes. Well, John did. Sherlock stood against the table staring off into space. He seemed to be in deep thought.
Sherlock began to pull harder and harder at the restraints as John began to swell inside of him again. He needed to get away! He couldn’t do it! He had changed his mind! To his horror the more he struggled the tighter his mate held him.
“You don’t have to do this,” John whispered into his white floppy ears. “If you get uncomfortable just say so. Greg isn’t going to do anything you don’t want him to.”
John quickly began to go faster and harder. Sherlock let out a yelp each time he pushed in. He could feel his knot starting to swell. His orgasm was quickly approaching.
John smirked walking over to the bed. He placed a hand on Greg’s shoulder. The fox stopped moving and looked at John with a questioning look.
“All of a sudden something feels different,” John explained. “You feel more open.”
“I can try,” she said looking at her with a smile. “Mum says I should try to make more friends.”
He left Sherlock to grab a towel from the bathroom. He laid it down on the bed and then pulled Sherlock onto his knees. The detective put up a fight as John undid the harness. There was no way he could that! It would hurt! It would make a mess.
“I need to talk to you,” Rosie said standing by her side.
“Don’t worry,” John instructed sitting down on the bed. “Daddies going to take care of you.”
The bunny was yanked back into reality when he felt John's long cock swelling inside of him. He cried at the feeling of being overstimulated. He couldn’t handle anymore!
Her Papa used to have a dog named Zorro. He was like a member of the family so when he suddenly fell ill it had devastated the whole family. It had nearly killed her Papa to get the dog put down. Sherlock had been reluctant to get another dog, but he really needed one. He relied on his dog to get around. Apollo was a good dog, but he would never be Zorro. She would try not to hold it against him.
Sherlock is ill and John decides he needs to wear a nappy until he is feeling better. Of course, the bunny isn't too happy about that.
Rosie listened for the sound of his footsteps. As soon as he was out of ear shot she slipped out of bed. She was careful not to make noise as she retrieved her torch from her dresser. Next, she grabbed her math book. She slipped under the blankets and flicked on the torch. Another half an hour wouldn’t hurt.
“Na…” Sherlock said shaking his head.
Sherlock spread his legs and started to whimper as pleasure as his lover took him. It could feel John’s knot swelling at the base of his cock. He was terrified of it, but he knew he would have to take it. It would hurt, but it would feel amazing.
Sherlock looked down at the laptop. He could have a least tried to lie down and relax. He knew he had babies to think about. John walked into the kitchen and sat the groceries down.
“Don’t stop,” John ordered. “He likes it when it hurts. Give it to him.”
"I know," Sherlock cried as a cramp hit him. "Can I do it at home?"
She leaned over and opened the window a bit. She reached into her pocket and pulled out of a pack of cigarettes and a lighter.
“She lied you know,” Sherlock said.
“It really hurts now,” Sherlock said once he had relaxed.
to claim his bunny there and then.
Sherlock shook his head. He didn't want to admit that part of him enjoyed the pain he was in. It felt so intense and overpowering. It felt it was tearing him apart. He swore he could feel blood inside of him. He couldn't believe he was taking it. It felt like it was going to kill him but he was still alive. He was taking it. Part of that amazed him and turned him on.
“Come on,” the wolf growled, grinding the spoon in. “Just admit it!”
“What friends?” she asked looking away.
“Jo…John!” he cried twisting around on the toy.
The bunny lost touch with the world around him as his orgasm hit. Everything went black around him even though his eyes were open they couldn't see anything. All he could feel was his body giving into a primal need of submission and when it did it felt like a million stars exploding at once.
Rosie couldn’t help but glance at Karen. The embarrassed look on her face told her that Luna had been right.
“I need you!” Sherlock cried. “I want you inside of me.”
“I’ll you another bottle with formula in a bit,” John said bringing down a hand to play with his ears. “Have you slept at all?”
“Let’s roll over,” John suggested.
John felt his knot beginning to deflate. Sherlock closed his eyes and snuffled as his wolf began to move again. He was going a bit slower this time but it still hurt. His wolf opened his jaws and brought his teeth down on his neck.
Sherlock knew why he was annoyed. He’d been yawning all morning. John had ordered him to take a nap before heading off to do some grocery shopping. He hadn’t even tried to take a nap.
Sherlock nodded and sat up. He didn’t bother with lube as he got into place above John. He was soaking wet inside. He lined up and started pressing his slim body down. He screamed as the massive head first split him open. John held his hips in his wide hands and slowly pressed the bunny onto his throbbing hard member. Sherlock was quaking as he took more and more of John’s massive cock inside of him. He whimpered high into the air as he was filled. So full! So deep!
“I’m trying to take care of you,” the doctor said. “This will help you sleep.”
“You know that isn't my thing,” Sherlock said with a snort. “You’re the one into feelings.”
“John!” he yelled closing his eyes tight. “Please stop.”
Sherlock shook his head at that thought. There was no way he was going to be able to take it without lube. No amount of training would ever make that possible but he knew there was no point in arguing with his wolf.
The thermometer still hurt but it wasn’t unbearable anymore. He moaned and squeezed his muscles around the device.
“I want to go,” she said feeling sick to her stomach. “I can write the report on my own.”
Despite all the pain he was in Sherlock could feel himself hardening. The dildo was pushing against his prostate hard. It was sending shocks of pleasure through him.
That caused a wave of arousal in the little bunny. He always loved new toys.
“I want more,” Sherlock whimpered. “Pull me back on it. Hard. Make it hurt.”
“Sounds good baby,” he said starting to move again. “We’re almost done. Be strong darling.”
John lay against his bunny panting and trying to calm his racing heart.
That did it for Rosie. She had no idea where the rage came from. Here was her girlfriend...ex-girlfriend... threatening to tell on her. She hadn’t even talked to her in days! She didn’t need help, She was just fine.
The bunny let out a cry as he began to rock on the cocks insides on him. A wave of pain shot up his spine but he didn’t care. He wanted to make John proud.
“What happened out there?” Mr. Green asked. “I’ve never seen you act like that.”
“No!” Sherlock shouted turning away from his lover. “Go away!”
“Glad you’re feeling better darling,” John said giving his daughter a relieved look.
“It hurts!” Sherlock cried, closing his eyes tightly. “I can’t! Take it out!”
“Hello,” he said when someone picked up. “This is Dr. John Watson. I need to speak to Dr. Hugen. I have a pretty serious question.”
Sherlock moaned into the pillow as his face flushed with embarrassed. Once in awhile John would indulge his “Daddy” kink. The bunny loved it when John referred to himself as Daddy. It made him hard as a rock. He hated that it turned him on so much.
“No!” Sherlock said shaking his head.
His wolf hated having things in his ass. That’s why he had picked the laxative. He knew it would drive him crazy. He wanted to see his lover’s face distort with pain as he struggled not to go to the bathroom. Sherlock could easily hold three of them. No doubt his wolf lover would want to prove he was as strong as a weak bunny.
Rosie felt her mood lighten as she handed her a piece of paper. At least she wouldn’t have to sit through an hour and a half of learning about Moriarty. She took the pass and started to head to the library.
Yes! The pain was good. He would never forget.
He needed to relax. He needed to take that massive cock inside of him. He needed it.
Sherlock smiled at her as she settled down in the seat.  Karen was overwhelmed with a wave of guilt as Rosie introduced her. She had given that innocent little girl drugs. She had pushed her girlfriend away. No doubt her new friend was suffering because of her.
John smirked as he drank his beer. Perhaps he would indulge his friend.
Sherlock was crying heavily at that point. The cramps were too much to bare and John was only making things worse. He was packing everything deep inside of him as he kept fucking deeper and deeper.
He had already checked on Sherlock three times and changed him twice. Sherlock had only moaned a bit when he cleaned him up. It looked like he was over whatever had hit him. The sleep had helped.
Sherlock seemed very nervous but he laid out on his stomach. He put his head on the pillow.
“I know,” the wolf said, holding his lover down. “It stings but you need to remember how good it feels.”
“Questions about Moriarty will be on the final. You will be writing a report on him.” Mrs. Stagg explained. “I would suggest you stay but I can understand if you want to leave.”
“John!” he cried as an orgasm rocked his body.
“Give it to me,” Sherlock demanded. “Put my body in its place.”
Sherlock could feel his insides filling with the wolves cum. It was burning hot inside of him.
John growled and bared his teeth as he dropped the belt and placed his free hand on Sherlock’s hip. He held his lover down as he
“John…” Sherlock keened, leaning into the blows.
Sherlock spread his legs eagerly as John headed over to him. He already looked slightly uncomfortable due to the butt plug.
“Rub your tummy,” The wolf instructed. “You know it helps.”
“Fine,” Karen said handing over the bag. “Please make these last a week.”
An uncomfortable silence fell between them. Sherlock wasn’t sure of what to do. He felt like he needed to get away from the creature but he couldn’t. He tried to move his feet but he couldn’t. It was as if he was stuck in place. The strange wolf had his eyes fixed on him and was licking his sharp teeth.
“I guess I can talk to her about it,”  Rosie said in a nervous voice. “It would be nice to sit with other people sometimes.”
“Please…” his pale bunny cried trying to pull away from his teeth.
Of course, John knew what he was trying to ask.
He was worried about her too. She had picked up on a few of Sherlock’s bad habit. She tended not to talk about things and just held everything inside.
“Good boy,” John said setting his supplies down on the bed.
His worst fear was confirmed when when John removed a box of adult nappies from the bag.
Sherlock he no idea what he was begging for. He didn’t know if he wanted it to end, have an orgasm, and more water. He knew if it ended he wouldn’t have his orgasm. He knew the more water he took the more intense the orgasm would be but that also meant the pain would be more intense.
“No,” John said closing his book. “I’m thinking about Rosie.”
Why did people have children when it hurt so damn bad?
“Alright,” John said carrying his sweet bunny into the room. “Greg is ready for his turn. I can smell it on him. Let’s go to the bedroom.”
Luna was the most beautiful girl she could imagine. She was tall with very long legs. She had long hair that reached the middle of her back and the brightest blue eyes Rosie had ever seen. They were even brighter than her Papa's eyes. Rosie would do anything to make she happy.
It was warm but not too warm. His stomach began to grumble as he was filled. So much water claiming him, cleaning his insides. John always loved fucking him after he had an enema. He was so clean inside and ready for him.
What was it Rosie wanted exactly?
John opened the bottle of lube and started coating the thermometer. He knew Sherlock had been fingering himself all day. He was too excited about the threesome to leave his tiny little hole alone. He put the device up against his hole and started pushing it in.
Sherlock wanted to sooth that enraged expression, wanted to reassure his wolf in any way he had possible that he didn't care a sixpence about this stranger.
John couldn’t help but feel nervous. He didn’t like suppositories. Sherlock was the one who liked those. He could easily take three glycerin ones and still orgasm. He loved the cramping that went along with it. John hated the cramping and urgent need to go to the bathroom it created.
Those who reach out to her have a chance of being included in the story. Make an account as a student and have fun. I don't believe you need an account to see the blog and read it.
“I’ll give you a good hard spanking after this,” John said as he waited for his knot to go down. “What would you like?”
“It will be beep if anything goes wrong,” he said giving him a little kiss. “You rest. Greg and I will take care of dinner.”
He opened the lid and squirted a large amount onto his large erection. He was in too much of a hurry to prepare his lover with his fingers. He was used to being taken by it so he shouldn’t have a problem.
Sherlock was sobbing as he tried to pull himself up. To his surprise, the wolf reached into the freezing water, his wide palm splaying across his chest and helped the bunny onto his hands and knees. He was only forced to stay there a few more moments before John turned off the water.
“You’re a good boy,” John said gently running a hand down his back. “I hate this but I’m willing to do it for you. Good boys deserve rewards.”
The sudden outburst caused Rosie to jump in surprise. Her girlfriend didn’t say much but when she got scared or angry she would explode as a way to defend herself.
That sparked something in the wolf. His bunny
“Ah!” the bunny cried. “Your bunny! Only yours.”
“Really?” Rosie asked. “No charge?”
The wolf curled up against his sleeping lover letting out a protective growl. He would protect him no matter what. He loved him. As looked at him his mind drifted back to the first time the two had made love...
When he walked into the bedroom with Apollo at his heels John was still awake. He was sitting up in bed reading a book.  Sherlock changing his pajamas and crawled into his bed next to his husband.
Maybe her mother was having the baby. That made the most sense. Luna might be too busy to text her. Despite Luna’s misgivings about the baby, Rosie could tell she was excited.
Despite the fact she did have friends and a girlfriend Rosie still felt like an outcast. Her girlfriend, Luna, was a quiet girl who didn’t like crowds. That wasn’t a problem for Rosie. She respected her partner’s needs and wants. The only problem was it didn’t leave Rosie much of a chance to hang out with her other friends.
“Sherlock!” John bellowed his name.
Tears sob down Sherlock's cheek, into John's chest hair, “Ah,” was all he could say, just little “ah's,” and, “ah”  and "Aaah!" All of them sublime, ascending-pained sounds between high staccato breaths with every inch forward of John's monster cock.
“I know,” he said coating it with lube. “I just need to check on you. I’ll put it in and let you sleep.”
“Ready for mine?” John rumbled as he felt his orgasm hit.
“Not every day,” Rosie said trying to be fair. “Just sometimes.”
Sherlock was in for an intense night. He wanted to keep a very close watch on his lover.
A brief moment of sympathy made its way into John. He didn’t want to take Sherlock dry. Even though the bunny had done it in the past he knew it was hard on him. It wasn’t something he liked doing too much or when Sherlock was already stressed.  He meant to immediately plow Sherlock as soon as possible but a new idea took hold of him.
“Why would I want to be your friend?” she asked. “I’m not friends with people who do drugs.”
Tears began to flow from Sherlock’s eyes and soak into the fabric of the couch. He wasn’t sure if he was crying from the pain or the pleasure he was feeling. The situation was just overwhelming. So much was happening and he was feeling so much.
“I love you, Sherlock,” he said pushing the floppy ear out of the way. “You’re willing to try and that’s more than I can ask. I’ll be in the bedroom.”
“Stop!” he cried fighting John’s hold. “Please! I’ll do anything. Just get it out! I’ll die.”
Sherlock could see people starting to gather around them. All the men who had been lusting after him during the party were crowding around John taking him over his muscular lap. Their hungry eyes practically devoured Sherlock’s perky ass as it was being raised up, impossibly voluptuous, entirely vulnerable to John’s feral desires. He closed his eyes and pushed his face into the fabric of the couch. He didn’t want to see them staring at them. Was everyone going to stand and watch this?
“No,” Sherlock said lowering his voice. “You made me a promise. We aren’t done yet.”
He snapped his mouth closed as John neared him with the dummy.
John frowned slapping his bunny's behind hard. His little bunny yelped from the slap and tried to relax around the advancing nozzle. He didn’t want to upset his wolf anymore than he already had. The wolf gave a grunt and pushed the nozzle the rest of the way in.
Sherlock wanted to demand to be released but he couldn't. John was happy. He was making John happy. That was enough to get him through the pain. He was grateful that John still had the cuffs on him. If they weren’t then he would have found a way to free himself from his prison.
Rosie didn’t like the turn the conversation was taking. She knew Karen was just being nice and trying to get to know Luna, but she knew her girlfriend wouldn’t handle it well. She didn't like being the center of attention.
“I…,” she said sitting down across from him. “Luna and I broke up. I guess...I just blew up at her.”
Sherlock felt chills go up his back at his wolf’s words. He did pick a naughty reward. He was a bad boy. Bad boy didn’t get more lube. Lube was for good boys.
“John?” Sherlock cried from the living room. “What’s taking so long?”
“Stop fighting Sherlock,” John warned. “You’re tightening up. Relax right now or I’ll get the bigger nozzle.”
He spread Sherlock’s legs and carefully applied lube to the man’s hidden entrance. Sherlock let out a little moan as his loved pushed a single finger inside. John took his time rubbing the lubrication around the passage. He was careful not to hit Sherlock’s prostate. He knew if he did the detective might orgasm.  He didn’t want that happening anytime soon.
“Sorry,” the stranger said backing off a bit. “I didn’t mean to scare you.”
“What is your problem?” the other girl asked. “I was just trying to be your friend.”
Despite the feeling he was being ripped in two Sherlock felt his tiny bunny cock beginning to hardener. He pushed back against the huge invading cock. He wanted more! If John asked him he would let him use an extension to make his cock even bigger. He wouldn’t care if it hurt. He wouldn’t care if he bled. He would do ANYTHING John wanted.
“Almost done,” the doctor urged as Sherlock’s hardened in his hands. “You’re getting so hard. You must love it.”
Plus, it was very accurate. John needed that. Bunnies can go into shock very easily and a rising temperature was a warning sign of that.
“Just a minute,” he said. “I just want to finish this page.”
Sherlock whimpered as John's deflating knot slipped from his body. John smiled as he felt his bunny limp to the bathroom. They had so much planning to do it.
As he pushed the toy inside he pulled hard on the belt. Sherlock cried out in pain as he was filled. His hands flew up to touch the belt around his neck. He gasped hard as it became harder to breath. He felt like he was being tore apart and he couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t even tell John how much pain he was in.
The library was in a separate building on campus. Getting there required crossing a small garden and going up a flight of stairs. Rosie paused when she spotted someone sitting about halfway up. Karen was sitting by herself looking rather depressed.
“Alright,” John said standing up from the bed.
To her horror she found Luna walking into school holding hands with another girl. Rosie knew that girl. Her name was Sarah and she was an old friend of theirs.
Sherlock only gave a small whimper as the nozzle was pulled free. With John’s help, he was lifted from the tub. His stomach felt like it was being ripped apart as he was placed on the toilet. Soon he would feel better but next week he would do the same thing.
“Move Luna,” Rosie said trying to get around Luna.
“Ready for an amazing night?” John questioned.
“Don’t make me hurt you,” the wolf growled, not letting up on the pressure he was applying to the butt plug. Then gentle he said, “Please relax yourself my sweet little bunny. You’re only making this harder on yourself.”
“The pills,” the younger girl said under her breath. “How much for a few?”
If Sherlock was a female wolf he would be filling him with pups. It irritated him a bit that he could never produce pups with his mate but it was something he could live with. He loved Sherlock regardless.
Sherlock cried out in pain as a cramp hit him. He just wanted to empty his body out, but the plug was in the way. It was locked inside of him. It wouldn’t allow him any release from the cramp.  He was trapped. He loved it so much. He loved up giving up control and seeing what John was going to put him through.
