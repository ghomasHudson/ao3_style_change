"Woah, Cas, not those." Sam laughed. He reached for some simple strings of white lights instead. "These are better."
"I wouldn't allow that to happen." Cas says, but after one last intense look at Dean and John, he follows Sam. Dean lets his father follow him to the table and picks up where he left off.
Dean startles and turns his head to see Eileen knocking on the passenger side window, looking unimpressed. He contemplates, briefly, pulling out of the garage without acknowledging her. It would be so easy. She doesn’t deserve that. He unlocks the door, lets her settle into the passenger seat.
Dean isn't sure what he's feeling at the moment. On the one hand, he's pissed- this pearl was supposed to get rid of Michael. Get rid of the pounding in his head, the danger in his bones. Let him rest. On the other hand- his
"I am Castiel." Cas is suddenly much closer, having descended the stairs while Dean panicked. "You are John Winchester."
“Y-y-yes it iiiiiis.” Dean gasped out, fighting to get his (irritating, obnoxious, and definitely not endearing) laughter under control. “Y-you're like freaking Snow White or something. A goddamn Disney princess. And here I was thinking all you angels were so freaking bad ass...”
Sam enlisted Cas' help for his next shopping trip, knowing that Dean would never let him hear the end of it and that he needed to at least be able to make the purchases without needing to murder his brother first. They pulled in to the Wal-Mart outside of Lebanon, which Cas looked at with apprehension.
The door to the bunker opens as Mary begins searching the kitchen for Winchester Surprise ingredients. John tears his eyes away from his wife at the sound, meeting Dean and Sam's eyes in turn as he reached for a gun.
“I did.” Dean works his jaw. “I didn’t even realize it was in there until you grabbed it, man. I must have just… I don’t know, not been paying attention, grabbed it out of habit. I wouldn’t have had any.”
“You just wanted a drink.” Cas corrects, and immediately regrets it as Dean cuts his eyes at him. Gently, he reminds himself. Patiently. Dean was such a stubborn creature. “I am only concerned for you, Dean.” Cas pitches his voice to be more reconciliatory. “I appreciate your efforts. I am asking that you listen with an open mind.”
There was still Michael to deal with. There is still the pounding in his head. And a part of him still misses his Dad. But tonight, at least... Dean leans in to Cas's arm at his side. Tonight his family is here, and that is enough.
not your best work?” Dean asked incredulously, pointing to the sky where the lights (the lights that Cas had
"You know, Cas... they say that whatever you're doing the first few minutes of the New Year... that's what you'll be doing all year long."
Cas takes his time, sitting against the headboard and taking a sip of his own coffee (dark like Dean’s, but with a lot more sugar) before he responds.
And Dean was gone, in the Impala and practically flying down the road, feeling years melt off of him as he did. His back, which had started protesting at being on the road in life, now felt fresh and young. His knee, which had twinged with every change of the weather since the fight with the British Men of Letters, felt brand new. And every part of Dean’s being, every atom, was accelerating in one particular direction- towards Cas.
“Dean?” Cas’ eyes were wide, his voice suddenly hopeful. And that... that broke Dean a bit. All the bluster went out of him as he stared at Cas’ face. A face he thought he would never see again.
“Welcome back, Sam. Thank you.” Cas doesn’t look much better, if Sam is honest. His eyes are rimmed red, his hair messy on one side as though he’d been making a fist in it—a nervous habit he’d been developing since he’d become human and started letting it grow. He takes the bottles of Gatorade and sets them on the end table next to Dean, then walks past Sam to where the remote still rested on the floor.
There had been no big bash for his birthday- that wasn't his family's style. Dean had clapped him on the shoulder and promised him cake after dinner. Sam had given him a hug and a $100 gift card for the book store in town, with a promise to take him whenever he wanted. Castiel had given him a home made card and a promise to take him camping the same night as an upcoming meteor shower. There was also a set of Star Wars action figures that made Jack smile. There'd been a phone call from Jody and the girls, with Claire promising to take him on a "proper sloppy bar crawl" when they were together next. There'd been a flimsy attempt to hide cheap decorations as Dean urged him to take a walk. And it was exciting, but...
“You are sick. And getting better.” Eileen touches his shoulder gently. “Don’t give up now. We are all behind you.”
"And you believe Dean would hate this?" Cas tilted his head at Sam, then squinted at the selection before them. "These are for children."
If he hasn't changed his mind about that, getting Lucifer out will only be harder. We have to consider it.”
“You don’t understand.” Cas drops his head back on the couch to look up at the ceiling. “When I had my powers, there was no part of Dean that was hidden from me. I could have seen that seizure begin and stopped it within a microsecond. I could have done more even than that.”
"Actually, Cas, can you help me translate this book? It has more information on the pearl and what's happening, and my eyes are gonna go cross if I read another word of Latin."
“Is it?” Dean had lost track of the days while he and Sam hunted down information about Abaddon. In truth, he couldn't remember the last time he'd celebrated his birthday. Year after year of potentially- world ending disaster had seen to that. “Well, happy birthday to me, then.”
"It's for night time." Cas explained gravely. "Sam does not want me to heal your toes any longer, so you must be prevented from stubbing them."
"You ladies enjoy your shopping trip?" Dean called as they clambered down the stairs. He had the guns spread out on the war room table for cleaning. Sam rolled his eyes and prayed for patience. Next to him, Cas snorted.
He remembered his Father's voice, His light, strong enough to destroy stars and create them anew as he argued with his Sister. He remembered perching inside a nebula with his brothers and watching his Father forge his first weapons, remembered Michael clutching anxiously at the stardust around them and Gabriel holding tight to his wings to stop him from bursting out and revealing himself to Father. (Father, of course, had known they were there, but they had been so young, and the tiny hint of rebellion was endearing then.) Father wanted to protect them at first- he battled the Darkness alone for thousands of years as the molten rock that was the Earth began to cool and life first emerged. To keep them occupied while he was away, he had given each of them a ball of Light and instructed them to design creatures to inhabit the new planet. During lulls in the battle, Father would return and review their designs. Those He liked received Life and were given a part in the Great Plan. Lucifer himself had designed dinosaurs. He'd wanted his creatures to be huge, far bigger than Raphael's spiders or Gabriel's platypus (Gabriel was always strange). Father had laughed when he showed Him his design, chided him gently for his hubris in making something so large, but breathed Life into them anyway.
Dean mulls it over for a minute, letting his thumb trace the familiar shape of the bottleneck. It isn’t a conversation he wants to have. But when Cas is right there, looking at him with all the hope and affection in his eyes he always has, and when Dean remembers the press of their lips together at last… He sets the bottle back on the floor and nods.
“Cas, dudes don't buy other dudes porn. That's- that's not how that works.” Castiel squinted at him.
"Friends don't let friends go into Wal-Mart alone, Cas." Sam tugged him inside by the sleeve of his ever-present trench coat. "I need you to help me get things that Dean won't hate enough to throw out."
Dean started the car and turned the music back up as they pulled back on to the road, and Sam knew the conversation was over for now. Dean wouldn't pay attention to this matter until he had no other choice. It was how he always dealt with disasters in the family. Dad was fine, until he wasn't. Sam was perfectly normal and good, until he wasn't. Cas was alive. Cas was on their side. Cas was coming back. Until he wasn't. So Sam leaned his head against the window and sent out a prayer of his own to Cas.
“They’re plotting now.” He mutters to himself, then hooks a finger in the collar of Cas’ trench coat, tugging him towards the door. “Let’s go, Jolly Green.”
Yes, I am continuing with Rubik's Cube symbolism. For those who don't know, when you're solving a 3x3 cube, the best way to go (according to me) is layer by layer- you build your top face first, then you do the middle layer. These two things are actually fairly simple. The tricky part is the bottom face (opposite the one you started with), because you must be aware of how every turn you make affects the top face as well, and you have to be sure to not deconstruct the rest of the cube while you build your bottom face.
Sam doesn’t know when to chuckle or sigh. He was hoping to keep Jack away for the worst of this, but he’s starting to think that won’t be possible.
” Cas stares at him a moment, and Dean tilts his head in apology, inviting him to continue speaking. “I know you are not unaware of your… inclination towards alcohol, in times of stress. I know that it is something that important people in your life have shared. Your father. Bobby Singer.”
“And this requires us going outside.” Dean stated, somewhat apprehensive at what Cas could possibly have to give him that apparently couldn't fit in the bunker.
Dean looks up from his contemplation of the bourbon to see that Cas has returned with two large steaming mugs of coffee. He feels a pang of guilt but doesn’t put the bottle down again. He’s not ready.
"Twice, they were hairline fractures." Cas clocked the look on Sam's face. "I do not see why I should leave you in pain when you don't have to be."
“I told you, I don’t want the fucking soup, Cas.” Dean’s sharp voice rose above the music and action sounds coming from the TV (one of the newer Star Trek movies, Sam recognized). Not so much a good sign then.
“Yeah, I know.” Dean mutters, and looks away. He tries to skip a rock in the brook, grunting in dissatisfaction when it only plunks into the water with a splash.
"I would still remember you." Jack assures him as Dean makes a choked noise, coming to his own realization. "I would never let myself forget a moment of being your son. And I think I'd like to remember how to read." Reading is one of his favorite activities. "But with Chuck gone, not as many hunts come through and..." Jack shifts on his feet, surprised to feel the heat of tears building behind his eyes. "And I'd really like to be four years old. And for you to still be my dads. Please." He sniffs. "I know I had to be a grown up to start with. I know that it's selfish to ask you to take care of me. But it's my birthday and I really, really, want to be four years old. And then five years old, next year."
“Good, he owes me a rematch in Mario Kart.” She leans forward on her chair as she pushes it in, raising a conspiratorial eyebrow at Dean. Dean nods, gesturing at the books and the computer.
Hell, there had been a time after Hell when the sound of barking sent him into panic attacks. But now, here he was, with one sweet, shaggy pooch. Miracle.
"What the hell?" Dean's voice was confused, bordering on suspicious as Sam quickly put the groceries away. "Is this a joke?"
“Then you come home- I'll make us burgers. No threatening any virgins, okay?” Castiel smiled in a way that he rarely did, his nose crinkling with the size of it.
“But you like them. I saw on the television- you are meant to get your loved ones the things they enjoy to earn forgiveness. I did not wish you to be angry with me any longer.” He frowned again. “It might have worked if Metatron had not come for me. If I hadn't been so foolish. And if there had been pie.” Castiel looked mournfully at Dean, then back at the floor, and the hunter thought he looked like a little boy asking for assurance that he was loved after breaking a vase in the living room.
As always, alcoholism is a serious problem. If you or someone you know needs help, I urge you to reach out to professionals in your area. It is not advisable to detox at home without medical help.
Dean's mouth fell open as he stared at Cas. He didn't have words, could barely wrap his mind around what he was being told. After a long moment of staring at Cas, Dean found his voice again.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel stood in his trench coat, no black ooze clinging too his body, a nervous look on his face. Next to him stood Jack, who wore a sheepish grin.
The drive is exactly what Dean needs. He and Eileen cruise down the highway, with the windows rolled down. He sings along to Zeppelin unashamedly, and Eileen smiles and laughs, tapping her foot to the beat because with the volume turned all the way up, she could feel the vibration of the bass. Instead of the bar Dean had intended to find, they stop at a food truck and buy burgers. Dean even manages to keep his down. On the way back, he pulls over and shows Eileen the babbling brook where he’d taken Jack to fish when he was sick.
“Yeah… yeah, okay. Where are we going?” Dean asked, taking his shoes and putting them on. Cas shifted anxiously at the question- not, Dean thought, the most encouraging response.
"If I can't heal you, you will do irreparable damage to yourself if you continue at this rate. Dean... I've healed your liver, your pancreas, even your heart, more times than I can count. I can no longer do that. I am begging you, please. I cannot watch you destroy yourself.”
Then one night Sam was following the string lights back from the kitchen, and paused outside his brother's door. There was a very faint glow peaking out from the crack. Curious, Sam cracked the door open.
“The second is that neither of your fathers lived to see the consequences of their drinking. They both lost their lives to the job—and I know that for a long time that is what you assumed your fate would be.”
“You're being close-minded- hell, there's plenty of actual science that backs it up. People in healthy relationships live longer and better. Kisses release endorphins that reduce pain. The unconditional love of a pet is proven to be beneficial to the sick. If you really think about it, it's not that far of a stretch.” Sam pointed out. “Anyway, even if none of that were true, why would Cas lie about something like this? Especially since he probably knew you'd be a jerk about it.” Dean scoffed defensively in response to this, but Sam could tell by the set of his shoulders that his brother knew he was right. “Look, Dean… this might be a novel idea but… maybe you should go talk to him about it? It's not right that he's laying around in pain when we could be doing something about it.”
"What are you talking about, I've been cleaning our guns all morning. I deserve the shit out of this."
It doesn’t take long for Dean to find what he needs—bananas, Nutella, some blueberries for Sam. He grabs a new bag of flour, and a new one of sugar. He turns down the juice aisle and picks up a jug of apple juice and a jug of cranberry. On a whim, he tosses some cherry Kool-Aid into the cart. Jack might get a kick out of it. Turning down the next aisle, he snags a few bags of chips to stack up the Dean Cave. He moves on autopilot through the rest of the store, coming out in the front to see Cas still talking to the man at the floral counter, his hands now full of seed packets and a potted plant nestled in the crook of his elbow. Cas laughs at something the man says, shaking his head and saying something back that prompts a further smile from the man. Dean heads for a checkout line, drumming his fingers on the handle of his cart. He watches the woman in front of him begin unloading her cart—mostly kitty litter and cat food—and turns his head back towards the floral department to look for Cas, who’s still chattering away. You’d think he hadn’t spent the whole car ride in stubborn silence in protest of Dean’s music choices.
“Rowena's dead?” Sam checked, leaning forward. Dean, on the other hand, couldn't care less about a dead witch.
“I don’t understand what that was.” Cas says plainly, turning his head to meet Dean’s eyes. “I liked what we were doing. Very much so.”
Dean lifted his hand to cover Cas', pressing it to his shoulder, and was quiet for a moment. Then his lips quirked up in a strange smile.
"That's alright." Cas kisses Dean's wrists before twining their fingers together. "I'll still be here."
To Jack's surprise, Dean is the first one to wrap his arms around him. Dean's gruff voice rumbles through him.
“Dean…” Castiel casts around in his mind for the right words to make the man listen. “It’s still…” He looks back into the bunker, where Sam and Jack are looking at schools. “The lore states that in order for this to be effective, you need to… stop completely.”
“It’s nothing local.” Eileen assures Dean, elbowing Sam, whose brow furrows in consternation. “We are not going. Just helping fill in blanks.”
“Tonic, meaning all your muscles tensed up. You didn’t lose consciousness or anything, but it doesn’t look like you remember it?” Sam tilts his voice up in question, and Dean shakes his head, grabbing at Cas’ hands to hold them still. “That’s about normal, from what I read. Lasted less than a minute—probably closer to thirty seconds, based on when Cas noticed it.” Sam looked at Cas, his heart aching as he took in the guilt on his friend’s face. “Since it was so short, I don’t think we need to worry about
“The fucking book, are you serious? You didn’t think maybe you should say up front ‘Hey Dean, if you give up your afternoon beer, you’re gonna start having fucking seizures on top of everything else?’ Jesus Christ, Sam!”
They stood holding each other beneath Dean's sky for a long time. When they finally separated, both pretended not to notice the dampness of Dean's eyes. Cas smiled at Dean.
"It was a goddamn stupid thing to do, Dean. Let that thing inside you." John shakes his head. "Now your brother and mother are in danger as long as they're around you." Dean winces and John sighs. "So we're gonna have dinner-- I'm assuming you can make it through dinner-- and then you and me are gonna light out of here, and figure this out together. Let your mom and Sammy stay here, where Michael can't use them as leverage. Keep the angel away, we don't need any extra baggage. And we'll figure it out." John nods like he always did when he'd reached a decision. "I won't let you hurt them. Or anyone. I promise you, we will find a way to stop this Michael, Dean. And if not..."
He sounded so proud of himself. For fuck's sake. Sam should trap the two of them in a circle of holy oil some day.
At the end of the night, they still have to crush the pearl, send John back to 2003. It's one of the hardest things Dean has ever done. He hugs his father tight, pushing aside all the fear and the anger just to hold his dad again. Sam does too. They take a photo- John won't remember this as any more than a dream, but he wants his boys to have this time when they were a family. He even nods his thanks to Cas when he offers to take it. And then John is gone, and Mary is weeping quietly into Sam's shoulder. Sam gives Dean a look, and Dean knows they will be talking about the Malak box again. Cas sits up with Dean that night, and they say nothing at all.
“Wait, so you're literally made of love, is that what you're telling me?” Dean had shifted a little closer, but his face was screwed up in almost comedic disbelief. “You're saying freaking
“Garth doesn’t count!” Dean objects, polishing off his coffee. “He’s an outlier. And a lightweight.”
"Dean..." Cas begins roughly hands raising slightly from his waist as though he is reaching for something. He’s wearing an old flannel of Dean’s, and a pair of Sam’s sweatpants with the cuffs rolled up.
“Seeds, Cas?” Sam asks quickly. Too quickly, Dean notes with some irritation. His brother is not as subtle as he thinks.
“Enough, both of you.” Cas turns to Dean. “You should not aggravate yourself further after your seizure. You need to rest.”
“They were my brothers and sisters, Father, as well as your children,” he'd pleaded while God created Purgatory and locked the Leviathan away there. “Let me help you- Let Michael and I be your sword and shield, and we shall not let you down.”
“She hurt our world, Father.” Lucifer said plaintively. “She destroyed my dinosaurs, which I created and you breathed Life into. I will not stop until she does.”
“You came back.” He murmurs, his hands passing over Cas’s shoulders and cupping his face. “You came back to me.”
Dean blinks as he reflexively reaches out to steady Jack, who’d just walked into him. The kid had clearly just gotten out of bed- the back of his hair was sticking straight up, his dinosaur pajamas rumpled and his body still sleep-warm. Dean and Jack regard each other for a moment in the hall, and Dean wonders if Jack is taking stock of his mood, of whether he’d already had a drink. Dean had done that often when his father was having a particularly bad week. It makes Dean kind of sick to think of it.
“Just so we're clear, I'm iffy on this.” Sam said, even as he pulled on his boots and followed his brother towards the car. “Lucifer must know that Crowley worked against him during the Apocalypse, sat on a throne while he was stuck in the Cage. That he's still breathing air without having offered Lucifer something is sounding pretty far-fetched to me.”
“Sure you do, Dean- you're all 'profoundly bonded' and crap.” Sam said cheekily, earning an even deeper scowl. Then he softened his tone. “Seriously, though. Cas may be my friend, but it's you he really responds to.” He paused and watched his brother's eyes soften even as he crossed his arms defensively. “You've gotta stop running from this, man. Especially now.”
"Can we talk about it in the morning?" he murmurs against Cas' mouth. Cas kisses back, earnestly and thoroughly.
. We’ve torn up the book several times over. Stopped the apocalypse in every form it has tried to take.” Cas shrugs. “Rowena keeps the demons in Hell. Billie has locked up Heaven. Garth’s overtures towards his fellow monsters have been well received, so attacks have slowed down a great deal.”
Dean’s face twitches at the mention of his surrogate father. He remembers crawling inside Bobby’s flask after he died. At the time, it felt like the only way he could cope with the loss, the only way he could still feel close to the man who raised him best.
I thought episode 300- Lebanon- was something of a missed opportunity. So I came up with this. Cas- our Cas, current timeline- is there. And we get a little insight as to how John might have 'helped' with the Michael thing had he been able to stay.
“I appreciate you not wanting to maim me.” Dean laughs, feeling his shoulders relax. “Sam won’t miss you?”
“It was the only way I could stay.” Cas says at last, before heaving himself to his feet and snagging the unopened bottle of Gatorade. “I should check on Dean.”
unresolved tension for over a decade, but… he was worried. Cas had pined after Dean for so long, oblivious to Dean’s own feelings for him (not that Sam could blame him), and now that he finally had him Sam was concerned about the lengths to which Cas would go to show that whatever discomfort Dean had over their new relationship was worth it.
“Dean.” Castiel replied. He shifted. “I... I know you no longer wanted interference in your lives. That you fought God for that right to be free from it. But I had to...”
“What do you mean?” Sam nudges Cas’ socked foot with his own. “Getting him to quit isn’t a bad thing, Cas—”
“Shut up you stupid bastard.” And then Dean had Cas locked in his arms, face buried in his shoulder as he kept speaking. “You stupid fucking bastard, you think you get to just.. say all that shit and just fucking leave? Stupid, idiotic...”
“Bobby was older than me.” Dean says after a long moment. “And he didn’t have a head start like you healing him.”
“You’re a walking hallmark card.” Dean grumbles, glaring first at Sam and then at Cas. Whatever he sees on Cas’ face must soften him, because he lets out a sigh. “Whatever. I guess I’m gonna go ‘rest’ in bed.” He shoulders past Sam and walks towards his room. Cas goes to follow, and Sam stops him with a hand on his shoulder.
This is a post-finals gift for the lovely superwholocked-in-albion. This idea came from the fact that the power of love is a thing in lore across cultures, and I like the idea of Cas needing some lovin' to get his mojo back in order. That said, this is easily the cheesiest, fluffiest thing I have ever written. I hope you enjoy!!
“Shhhh, relax.” Dean’s mood seems to have done a 180. Where he’d been surly and hard he was now nothing but soft. It didn’t surprise Sam terribly—Dean’s instinct was always to soothe and reassure his loved ones. He probably reacted more favorably to a panicked Cas than to a calm one, if only because there was something he could fix there. “We got all the time we need. Maybe you want to pause the movie and give me one of those nerd rants about why we call it a Charley horse?”
“I need to run to the store. We need chocolate chips, bananas…” Dean starts ticking things off on his fingers, turning around to face Eileen and Sam. Eileen looks at him quizzically and Dean repeats Sam’s words for her sake. “Breakfast for dinner.”
“I don’t know what you want me to say, Cas.” Dean’s fingers tighten on the steering wheel. They will be home in less than ten minutes.
I knew I had to write something for today. My nougat son, my sunshine boy, he's four!! I had to shower him with love. Cross posted from my tumblr.
Miracle was there when Dean lurched awake from a dream about his angel being engulfed in black ooze. He was there when Dean paced the length and width of the bunker, looking for either the ooze or for Cas or both. He was there when Dean drank until he couldn’t feel the desperate ache in his chest where Cas was supposed to be. Miracle was there to lick Dean’s face until he woke up when he passed out.
“Sam.” Dean is pushing himself into a sitting position now. Sam knows the request for a full report when he hears it.
Dean broodingly bit into his own burger, barely tasting it. All he could think about was his Lucifer's demented grin corrupting Cas' familiar face, after Dean had realized that Cas was no longer in control of his body.
I- I do love all of God's creations, as I ever did. But now- now there is something I love more.” Cas took a deep breath, then finally,
"What do you mean?" Cas asked tiredly. He had that look on his face he sometimes got, that "I can't believe I rebelled for this" look. Sam sighed.
“Dean wouldn’t have let you do it anyway.” Sam says after a moment. “Like you said, neither of us like our brains being messed with—even by someone we love.”
“Dean, please.” Cas sets one of the mugs down on his end table, holding the other out to Dean. Dean’s fingers twitch before he lets go of the bottle again. He stretches his legs out, lets the bourbon rest in his lap as he takes the mug from Cas. It’s his favorite, he notes, the one with a chip near the handle and the Harley Davidson motorcycles chasing each other across the faded grey background. The coffee within is rich and dark, exactly the way he likes it. He takes a long pull before he turns back to Cas.
The first 72 hours are often the most harrowing parts of alcohol withdrawal. Sam tries his best to keep Dean-- to keep all of them-- together. It was never going to be easy.
Castiel's grace sang sadly. Lucifer shoved him down, further into the vessel. What right did this seraph have to mourn the absence of their Father? He'd never met him, never known him… never even laid eyes on him. After the Darkness had been sealed away, God had withdrawn from all but his oldest children. The archangels, and little Metatron (that was another suck up- a lesser angel who thought himself far more important than he was), who became his scribe, were all that were permitted in his presence. It became the duty of the archangels to pass orders along from their Father to their siblings. Lucifer remembered very clearly the day Gabriel was told his platypus would soon come in to being. The archangel had been trembling with excitement and spiraled quickly down to the surface of the planet with one of the little brothers he was closest to to watch the platypus begin.
“’The good blue kind’, Jesus fucking Christ.” Dean grumbles, sinking deeper into his pile of blankets. His face is pale, accentuating the bruises under his eyes. Sam pushes away the thought that the last time Dean had looked like this, he’d had to search out a faith healer.
“Then I’ll get you coffee before we talk.” Cas says, stretching his long limbs before sitting up. “We
Jack smiles again, and Miracle is dancing around this big, reunited family, his tail wagging like it would never stop, barking happily.
“I’m checking out the groceries.” Dean says slowly, feeling that familiar irritation buzzing in him again. “You know, what we actually came here for, that I got while you were flirting with the flower man.”
Idk, it just occurred to me that if I was living in the bunker and had to pee in the middle of the night, I'd need a light source so I don't trip and die.
Dean stroked his thumb along Cas' hand, slowly getting used to the sensation that was apparently his soul trying to hook up with Cas' grace (and how weirdly awesome was that?).
Still, the war between God and the Darkness did not abate. When Father began to create the lesser angels- younger brothers and sisters for the archangels to look after and help raise, the Darkness answered with the Leviathan. Lucifer recalled with a shudder how the first batch of new angels had been decimated by the creatures while Father's attention was devoted elsewhere. Only one had survived- scrawny little Metatron. Father's wrath had been mighty that day. Michael had shielded Metatron with his wings while Raphael and Gabriel looked on in horror, but Lucifer had been ready to fight from then on.
"Yes, it's quite dark at night." Cas agreed, shrinking away as a family with several children loudly moved past them. "I've healed you and Dean of several stubbed toes."
Sorry for the slow updates, it's hard to write fic, read fic, and do a Masters Degree at the same times.
“Never tell Sam what I'm about to do.” he instructed, and before Cas could ask what he'd meant he threw his arms around his friend, burying his face in the crook of his neck. After a long moment, he felt Cas' arms wrapping around him and Cas' chin settling on his shoulder. “Thank you, Cas.” he murmured into the familiar trench coat. Cas said nothing in return, but held him tighter.
Dean is off to a rocky start. Jack wants to play a game. Castiel is trying to figure out what all this human thing means.
“Guess I got back just in time.” Sam sits in the armchair closest to the end of the couch Dean is on and allows himself a moment of satisfaction as he watches Dean unscrew the cap of one of the bottles and take a sip. There is tomato soup with rice on the coffee table in front of them, probably getting cold. Cas fits the batteries back into the remote and raises the volume on the television as Kirk and Spock discover Spock Prime’s ship. Then he fits himself into the other end of the couch, lifting Dean’s feet into his lap. For a while, there is peace.
“Yes. I tried threatening a virgin for your pie, but there was none at the store. Then Metatron found me.” Castiel shrugged and looked at his feet. Dean blinked at him.
My grace cannot be healed with only physical comfort.” Cas turned his gaze heavenward, his expression wistful. “Were I not unwelcome there for my part in Metatron's escape, I could return to Heaven and be bolstered by the glory and the love of the Host. Angels were not meant to be alone, Dean. In spite of it all, we are creatures of love. It was God's love that brought us into being, and it is love that sustains us.”
Dean lets out a deep, long suffering sigh, and Cas slips the cube into his pocket before turning more fully to the game to convince Dean that he could play by the rules, just this once.
for Dean, holy crap) were still swirling in the sky. Cas shook his head with a small smile. “What the heck have you done that's better than
Castiel smiles that smile that Dean loves so much, the one that scrunches up his nose and flashes his teeth, and Dean can’t help but kiss him. Then he wrinkles his nose, pulling back.
Dean's head shoots up. Cas is standing in the door, his hands fisted at his sides. Dean imagines that if he could see Cas' wings, they would be flared up at his sides.
“Perhaps it is strange to you. But to me...” Cas looked down at his hands, turning them over in his lap. “I am not a physical being, Dean. Though I inhabit this vessel alone now, this body is not
“I dunno Dean, I mean, it kind of makes sense.” Sam said after Dean explained the situation to him. “When you think about it, there's plenty of lore to support it- cultures all over the world have stories where serious afflictions are fixed with true love's kiss. Hell, even today parents tell their kids that a kiss will make a scrape feel better.” Dean screwed his face up in response.
"Well, I guess you can't." John allows, and his lips quirk up in a grin, which Dean returns. "So this pearl that brought me back... I'm not who you were expecting. I've heard about Sammy, and I've heard about your mother..." John shakes his head in disbelief. "What was the pearl actually supposed to be for, Dean? What's wrong with you?"
“Yeah, yeah. My mind is open. No opener mind than mine.” Dean grumbles, but he twines his fingers with Castiel’s and draws their joined hands to his lips. Cas’ breath catches in his throat as Dean’s full lips brush over his fingertips. As an angel, his nerves could never have been set so aflame by so gentle a touch. “It’s a big change, Cas.”
Sam and Eileen went on increasingly long runs that Dean was growing increasingly convinced were more for romance than for wellness. Dean went outside to walk Miracle four times a day when there were no hunts. Sometimes they jogged. Sometimes they sat on a hill near the bunker and looked at the sky and the grass, and Dean’s eyes would trace the path of a honey bee going from flower to flower and tell Miracle about that time Cas had shown up naked and covered in the insects.
“Dean—” Cas’ voice is still frantic, his hands running over Dean’s shoulders and through his hair and over his sides. Sam empathizes.
"If that's what you want, Jack... you just give Sammy enough time to go get you some four-year-old essentials from the store. And then you do what you have to do."
“You had a seizure.” Sam cuts in as the two Spocks salute each other on the screen. Dean’s eyes flash up to him, now as sharp as ever. “Looked tonic.”
“It’s alright, Sam. I want to make it louder—Spock and Kirk are about to make their incursion on the Romulan ship.”
Cas’ face is like stone, but he lays down all of his seed packets and his potted plants with out complaint. He even thanks the cashier by name when she finishes ringing them up and bagging their items for them. They return to the car in silence, packing the grocery bags into Baby’s back seat. The silence remains as Dean puts the car in drive, as he drives out of town. Cas stares down at his hands, and Dean keeps swiping at his lips, thinking longingly of the beer he’d left behind. He’s supposed to be past this. He thinks about how he and Cas had spent this morning tangled together, floating on a cloud of their own happiness. He should have known that it couldn’t last.
“I... understand that this is difficult for you. You aren’t prone to discussing your problems. Or your feelings.” Cas pauses for a moment. “Or anything at all, aside from hunting and Westerns, it seems.”
“I couldn’t do anything.” Cas’ voice is shaky, his hands still running over Dean’s arm. “You were—there was nothing I could do.”
“What makes you so sure there are angelic exorcisms, anyway?” Sam asked, once again snapping Dean back to the present. “I mean, if there were such a thing, wouldn't Cas have done it when I was possessed by Gadreel? That must be safer than sending freakin Crowley in after me.”
But then Cas starts losing his powers. And it's stressful, to say the least. Cas’ ability to heal them becomes inconsistent, his angelic strength waning. He starts to fall asleep in seemingly random places, like in the kitchen or over a game of Connect Four with Jack. Once, Dean catches him asleep in the bath, the tub overflowing, and that frightens him enough that he needs a drink immediately to stop trembling. Cas allows Sam and Jack to examine him after that, while Dean nurses a whiskey in the kitchen.
Dean prayed, once. There was no answer. Miracle pressed his soft, wet nose into his hand, and Dean ran his fingers through the shaggy fur. Miracle stayed. Dean didn’t drink.
Dean looks at Cas, at his chapped lips and blue eyes and stubbly cheeks. He can have this, he thinks distantly. He can have this, even if what Cas asks in return is so big… so...
“Dean, I get you. I want to help Cas too, he's my friend. But I know he wouldn't want you getting yourself hurt or killed trying to help him, you know? I just want you to be smart about this.”
Dean climbs under the covers at last, smiling at Cas as he does. When their lips come together, it is effortless, and it is everything Cas has ever wanted. He lets hands rest on the bare skin of Dean’s waist, slipping under his shirt. Cas kisses Dean’s cheeks and his brow and his jaw, mumbles encouragement against his temple as Dean runs his fingers through his hair and rubs the back of his neck. Dean reaches down, brushes his knuckles over the burgeoning hardness in his sleep pants, and it’s wonderful and it is awful all at once. Cas’ arousal is still there, but now every touch feels wrong, the beating of his heart and the swooping in his belly no longer pleasant but incredibly loud. He rolls away from Dean and Dean immediately releases him.
Dean paused, took a breath he didn’t need anymore. He turned to Bobby with his eyes wide. Bobby raised his eyebrows at him.
They fell into a routine. Miracle would bound onto Dean’s bed in the morning, demanding to be walked. Dean would get up. Sam would make breakfast, and always burn the toast. Eileen would make the coffee, because according to her only she could do it properly. Dean would drink water when he set some out for the dog, would eat when the others did.
"I would have to get a more appropriately sized sleeping bag." Cas frowns a moment. "And mind your bed time."
I think we're about 2/3 of the way through this story-- I hope you enjoy the rest! Please leave a kudos and/or a comment, they really brighten my day.
Eileen's name-sign for Jack is "nougat", which doesn't really exist in ASL but is a sign in German Sign Language.
“Two weeks.” He asserts. “And if I see you doing harm to yourself, I cannot be silent.” He pauses. “But I will take your wishes very much into consideration.” There is another moment of silence between them. “I do not want to lose you, Dean.”
“I’ll have you know I resurrected him in perfect condition.” Cas sounds irritated, almost offended. “And even if that weren’t the case, surely you know that it was affecting his life. His ability to maintain relationships, his ability to attain peaceful sleep.”
Dean was a man of his word. He’d poured out the “hard stuff”. He had promised to stop drinking “to excess.” He’d never said anything about the beer.
When the peace ended, it ended with fire. The Darkness returned with a vengeance, and the archangels went to war again. Lucifer recalled watching in despair as she hurled a huge, blazing meteor at the Earth with one hand while holding Michael's wings in the other. Lucifer had been faced with a choice- his brother or his dinosaurs. He and Father had moved together to save Michael from the Darkness, of course (because he loved Michael, in spite of everything), but the dinosaurs were wiped from existence. He and Gabriel had left Raphael with their Father while they carried Michael to a spot behind the moon where he could heal, and Lucifer had raged at the destruction of his creations. He hurled his own meteors, pummeling the surface of the moon until it was covered in craters. As soon as Michael was stable, he flung himself back into battle, wings blazing as bright as the sun, and the darkness knew Lucifer's wrath that day. He fought and clawed and shocked even Father with his fury. Finally, after the Darkness had pushed their line right back to Earth's atmosphere, Father had taken him aside.
“Sam let me pick something out at the toy store when we went to the mall to make my new ID.” Jack reports. “I thought it looked fun. I also got this Rubik’s cube. Sam says you threw out the one you had when you were kids.”
“I’ve been called worse.” He paused as Dean continued his litany of insults murmured into his shoulder. “I thought you would be uncomfortable with what I said. I was unsure you would want me here. But Jack said--”
“Relax, angel. Time for what?” Dean’s voice isn’t quite slurring, but it gets clearer with each word. “Christ, I ache. Think I got a Charley horse.”
“Oh man, I remember this thing… we never had all the pieces.” Dean hurries down the stairs to join Jack at the table, running his hands over the pieces with an eager grin on his face. “Where did you get it?”
"You... goddammit." Dean retorted, with all his usual tact and grace. "Watch where you're going, bitch."
Finally, Lucifer unearthed a box which held a seed and a bit of dirt. He smirked- this could only be from the tree of knowledge in the Garden. It wasn't a weapon, per se, but as a source of power (his smirk widened when he realized it's holiness had not faded with time) it would be quite valuable. He stuffed it in the pocket of Castiel's ridiculous trench coat and exited the cage. There were other weapons, he knew, lost to the sands of time, some collected by upstart humans or demons who knew to ward against angels… but hardly inaccessible. Perhaps it was time to pay the Winchesters a call in that regard...
“Hey. Cas is calling Jack home.” Dean says, walking in to peek over Sam’s shoulder. He sees something about varieties of djinn before Sam flips his book closed.
“Your skills are second to none.” Cas overrides Dean again. “The threats that remain in this world are as nothing compared to those you have already faced. There is no reason to assume that you will find your end at the mercy of a ghost or vampire. You can have a long, fulfilling life, Dean.” Cas reaches out and rests a hand on Dean’s knee. “You deserve a long, fulfilling life. I want you to be able to live it.”
Cas lowers his gaze to his hands for a moment, his fingers rubbing over his coffee mug in what Dean has come to recognize as a self-soothing gesture. He wants to take Cas’ hands in his own, soothe him himself. He doesn’t.
“Does it have to be that loud?” Cas asks waspishly as Immigrant Song begins to play. Dean reaches for the dial, turning it higher. Cas and Sam can babysit all they want, but he will be damned if anyone tells him how to play the music in his car. Cas grunts in dissatisfaction, one of his hands coming up to cover the ear closest to Dean, and Dean shakes his head, swiping at his mouth before returning his hand to the wheel. The drama, honestly. Cas had never complained about his loud music before, not even when Sam was bitching about it. They pull into the parking lot at the store and Cas sighs as the music and ignition are turned off.
Sam watches as Cas leaves the room and waits to hear Dean’s door open and close again before he lets out the groan he’s been holding in, rubbing his hands over his face. He turns off the television and sets everything to rights in the den before he leaves, taking the now cold bowl of tomato rice soup with him to dump out. He catches himself wishing for a drink, and instead picks up his phone to text Eileen. He has two messages waiting for him from Jack.
"We can fix it, Cas." Dean says tiredly, heading him off at the pass. "We'll figure it out." The company line. "Wish you'd figured out you didn't want this sooner though." He finishes with a grumble.
“It's not the aurora borealis, Dean… it's you.” Cas said gently. That was enough to bring Dean's gaze from the stars to Cas' eyes.
“Sammy?” Dean’s eyes are glazed as he looks at Sam before he blinks and they become clearer. “We holdin’ hands now?”
Mary's eyes are red and she nods, pressing close to John. John looks at Sam, who nods at him sadly. Then he turns his gaze back to Dean, and Dean nearly trembles, having the strength to stand still only because of Cas now standing at his side.
“Or destiny.” Castiel whispers after a moment, giving the cube another twist. There is no answer. Dean is already asleep.
Right. John wouldn't expect them to have anyone else in their lives. Sam and Dean had painted some broad strokes, with some input from Mary (the way John's eyes bulged when she described hunting had truly been something to see), but John had seemed more surprised at the idea of their extended hunter network than anything else. Their family, though Dean hadn't dared to call it that. Family was a holy word to John, something that meant Mom-Dean-Sam-Dad only.
“I… okay.” Dean finally turns himself fully to look at Cas. “Let’s say I give this a try. No more of the hard stuff. No more, uh… excess, or whatever.” Cas’ eyes are hopeful and bright, and Dean’s heart turns over. “I, uh. I don’t want to make any promises. But…” He passes the bottle of bourbon to Cas. “We can start here, right?”
“Great to know where your loyalties lie.” Dean sneered, pacing back and forth. Crowley's sigh blew static across the connection.
Deep inside him, Jack's hybrid grace moves, pulsing warmly. Shifting. Asking a question. Jack rests his hand against his stomach and casts his eyes over the park again. He notes that a couple of parents are giving him odd looks, remembers that he's too old to be hanging around a park with no child of his own.
Cas had been determined to see Dean through this. Sam did not need to know what went on behind closed doors at the bunker, and heaven knows he’d put up with
“Dean!” Cas’ voice is sharp, almost angry as he approaches. Dean turns to face him, astounded at the scowl on his face. “What the hell are you doing?”
"What's that-- Cas, you know I don't care about the damn powers." Cas leans closer, more intent, hands gripping Dean's wrists now.
“Yes. I moved the stars and painted the sky.” He said and Dean was suddenly struck by how inhumanly powerful Castiel was to have the power to move the heavens. This was quickly followed by the realization that he'd moved the heavens for
“You are. I rebuilt you, Dean. I remade your body and healed your soul, and you are the most amazing thing that I have ever done.” The warmth from Cas' hand spread from Dean's face to the rest of his body, and somewhere in the back of his mind Dean felt Cas' grace wrapping around him to shield him from the cold. Once again, Dean found himself speechless.
“I couldn’t even scan his body for damage.” Cas says thinly. “Humans are so limited in what they can do. So fragile, so many ways they can break.”
"Dean? Sam? There have been temporal distortions radiating out from Lebanon, are you--" Cas stops halfway down the stairs, his eyes wide as he takes in John standing defensively between Sam and Dean. "Well. That explains some of it at least."
Dean had been praying almost non-stop for the past two weeks. He didn't know if Cas could hear him- but then, Cas always heard him, didn't he? He said so himself, even if he couldn't always answer. Dean had to believe that Cas was in there somewhere, that Lucifer hadn't killed him or swallowed his grace up. The alternative… Dean wouldn't let himself think of it. So any spare moment he had when he wasn't searching for some way to crowbar Lucifer out of Cas' vessel. He ran his hand through his hair as he flipped through yet another book- he must have gone through a quarter of the Men of Letters' rather extensive library by now, and he'd found exactly bubkis.
“Shut up about the fucking book! I wish you’d never found the damn thing.” There is a thump, something being knocked over. Sam hurries into the den, relieved to see that all that had flown across the room was the remote.
"Okay, this is about to get even crazier." He watches John's eyebrows shoot up. "So, it turns out there are other universes. Like alternate timelines and stuff. And there can be... these rifts or tears that go to them. It takes a lot of power, but uh, one was opened by mistake. And the world it led to, it was one where we didn't exist, Sam and me. And the apocalypse happened. It was bad. Mom and our kid- our friend, Jack, they got stuck there for a while. And when we were saving them, we saved a whole bunch of hunters on that side too, let them in to our side." Dean paused to check that John was following. His father was working his jaw, which meant he was thinking, or angry. John nodded after a moment for Dean to keep going. "Anyway, the biggest bad over there was Michael the archangel. Their version. We thought we locked him out when we rescued everyone, but he and Lucifer broke through to our world. And Lucifer managed to really juice himself up, and then take Sammy and Jack. The only... Michael was hurt. He was too weak to take him on, and we just didn't have the firepower. So I thought... I asked him if he could do it, if he had his sword. His perfect vessel."
“Because of it being a ‘thing’, I chose not to heal the parts of Dean’s brain that made him dependent on alcohol when I was able to. It would have been a delicate process, not something I could have done with just a touch. It wouldn’t have been complete, but it would have at least stopped the worst of this withdrawal. I knew Dean would balk at the idea, so I didn’t even ask. But now, I have no power. No ability to help except to make soup he won’t eat as I watch him suffer. I don’t even know how to tell him I’m sorry.” Cas makes a fist in his hair, tugging at it as he looks at Sam with tortured eyes.
“I won’t lose the pieces.” Jack declares, setting his piece at the starting point. “We can break any curse there is! We can ask Rowena!”
John's face is inscrutable. He doesn't reach out to touch Dean, to grasp his shoulder. Dean waits for him to speak like a man waiting for an axe to fall.
us to free him. No, shut up, I've been thinking about this.” Sam held up a hand to stave off Dean's furious look. “Lucifer couldn't enter Cas' body without consent. All I'm saying is that I wouldn't put it past Cas to allow him in for no reason other than us needing him to fight Amara. And for that same reason, he might not want to get rid of him.”
“Your feet are wet. Do you wish to leave? I believe it is traditional to get a cake.” Cas suggested. Deam smiled and stood close enough to Cas that their shoulders were pressed together.
“Dean.” And Dean smiled, because Cas said his name like a promise. Like a vow. And when they (finally, finally) kissed, he knew it was a vow he would take too.
“We won't know until we try. Besides, Crowley hasn't thrown in with Lucifer.” Dean said with certainty.
“I have led garrisons of angels against the worst forces of hell, I have looked the Empty in its face and rebelled against God, but that might have been the most terrifying moment of my life.” Cas says, his voice muffled against his hands.
“And it does not have to be you.” Cas interrupts. “I’m not saying stop hunting- I don’t think any of us are ready for that—but Dean, we
“That’s because Sam is a nerd.” Dean throws an arm around Jack’s skinny shoulders, noting how the kid leans in to his embrace. “Let’s go show him what a real breakfast looks like.”
“Jack thinks so too.” Cas enters the kitchen, fully dressed now. Dean muffles a snort when he sees Cas has pulled his trench coat over his t-shirt and sweatpants, and hears Sam and Eileen do the same. Cas either doesn’t notice or chooses to ignore them. “He would like Nutella in his pancakes as well.”
“No.” Cas preempts Dean’s irritation in a way that only Cas can. “But I would like to get some seeds.”
Cas beamed and waited for Dean to shrug on his jacket before sweeping them both away. When Dean felt himself rematerialize, he was immediately aware of a biting cold. He wrapped his arms around himself and looked around. They were surrounded by a thick layer of snow, and nothing else. He could see no trees or houses in any direction.
“Dean.” Cas catches those callused hands and holds them tight, because now that he is permitted to touch Dean this way he finds he can’t stop, and the tension bleeds out of Dean’s body.
And Dean can't really argue with that. He allows himself to trace the lines of Cas' hand where it rests on the bottle he still hasn't drunk from.
Except it wasn’t fine, because after a few weeks of his powers dwindling, Cas gets increasingly agitated every time Dean drinks "to excess". He hovers when Dean fixes his whiskey, lingers with a furrowed brow over every beer. When they hug, he clings tighter than he ever has before, face crunched up in concentration. Dean tells him he looks constipated, and Cas squints at him like he wishes he still had the juice to smite him. Cas tries replacing his whiskey with Jack's apple juice, and Dean shouts at him til he's hoarse. But it was a dumb prank, so it's fine. It's fine, okay, so Sam needs to get that look off his face. It's too much like the look he used to have when John was disciplining Dean too loudly. Dean doesn't like it.
A few minutes later, when they come up for breath on the slopes of Mauna Loa (they were in Hawaii by the time Dean had gotten Cas to stop zapping them everywhere- he wasn't gonna poop for a month, dammit) Dean leans his head on Cas' shoulder and tells him something else about New Year's.
Dean nods, and affirms: "He's family." He turns to Cas. "So, remember that pearl that was too good to be true?"
“What requires priva--” Sam didn’t get to finish his sentence before Jack spirited him away. Neither Dean nor Cas blinked as they disappeared.
When Cas loses the rest of his power, when he's truly human again, it happens all at once, in the middle of an X-Files marathon. He cries. Dean's stomach turns. Maybe Cas is regretting not trying to fix it, maybe he's realized he doesn't want to grow old with Dean after all. Maybe he’s realized, at the very last moment, that humanity is not worth losing all that he is. He leaves Cas to wipe his tears, ignoring Sam's accusing gaze from where his brother is rubbing Cas' shoulder, and gets himself a drink. Bourbon this time, he thinks. And a lot of it.
“Dean.” He whispered. He was not sure how he intended to continue that sentence, but suddenly he didn't have to, because Dean's lips were on his and his grace was blazing within him. He gasped at the feeling of it, and Dean took the opportunity to deepen the kiss. Cas was vaguely aware of his hand reaching out to grip Dean's shoulder, and then it was Dean's turn to gasp as his soul rose up and in congruence with Cas' grace, straining against the physical boundaries between them. Dean pulled away then, eyes wide and lips swollen.
Sam stretched as he rose from his chair in the library, groaning with satisfaction. He hadn't seen Dean or Castiel in hours, and could only hope it was a good thing. He poured himself a glass of water and headed down the hall to go to bed. He passed Dean's room on the way. The door was open, and the bed hadn't been touched. Across the hall, Castiel's door was closed, but if he listened closely he could hear the murmur of their voices. He smiled- definitely a good thing. Then a moan erupted from inside the room, and Sam hightailed it to his bedroom further down the hall.
Somewhere down the line, Cas tells Dean that he tried to get him pie. Dean is alarmed that virgins were threatened. Gen or pre-slash. Enjoy!
“Uh, it’s hard to say. It might. Hopefully, it won’t, and even if it does, after another couple of weeks—”
Finally, God agreed. The four archangels went to battle with their Father, and it was a battle that raged across the cosmos. One particularly momentous engagement had shattered the planetoid that became Saturn's rings. Sometimes the Darkness would retreat for centuries, and life on Earth would blossom. Father made a million lesser angels, and set his great plan for Life in motion. During the last of these lulls, Lucifer got to see his dinosaurs walk the Earth. They were large and beautiful and varied and Lucifer often took his younger siblings down to perch on the mountains and watch them live. He and Uriel loved to play with the long-necked Brachiosaurs, and to fly along side the winged Pterodactyls, using their own wings to create gusts of wind that would blow the pterodactyls off course- but only for a moment, because Lucifer's dinosaurs were strong and would always right themselves in moments. Michael often chided him for thinking in such possessive terms.
As they all crowd into the kitchen, all conflict seemingly forgotten (never forgotten, pushed away, if you don't look at it it isn't there). John largely ignores Cas, but shares stories of Sam and Dean growing up that have nothing to do with hunting, things Dean had forgotten about, like the time Sammy learned how to escape his high chair and became almost impossible to hold down for meal time, or when Dean had put on a thanksgiving play using all of his and Sammy's toys when they'd had to miss the one at school. Mary talks about what they've gotten up to lately, how the music these days is nothing like it was. Cas mentions that Dean must agree, because the tape he gave him was all Zeppelin. Dean's heart freezes as his eyes meet his father's after that, but while there is a knowing look is John's eye, he shakes his head and moves on to the next tale-- this time about Dean refusing to let anyone else hold Sam when Sam was first born.
“It’s not an actual curse, Jack.” Cas says, still turning the faces of the cube in his hands. “Humans, especially human children, are prone to losing small, unimportant items.”
“Fine, it's considered. And it doesn't change anything. Let's get back on the road, I want to get to this place before midnight.”
Inside, the ceiling was strung with the colored string lights, going around the whole border and bathing the room in soft pink, blue, and green light. In the outlet nearest the bed was the Captain America nightlight. But what caught Sam's eye the most was Cas sitting against the headboard, reading a book. Dean lay snoring beside him, head in Cas' lap. Cas looked up at Sam and smiled. Sam smiled back and shut the door.
“That’s not true.” Cas’ voice is softer now, and Dean looks over at him for a moment to see Cas looking back, his face tired but no longer angry. “I trust you with my life, Dean. It is sometimes hard to trust you with yours.”
, he thought with a twinge of remorse, excepting Michael who was in no state to fight), or to the planet (he could always find a new one, now that he was free of that thrice-damned cage). No, he was eager to battle the Darkness for himself, for survival (surely she would come for him eventually) and for revenge. His now-blackened wings rippled in agitation at the thought. In his vessel, he felt a twinge of curiosity from his host. Poor Castiel- one of his youngest brothers, Lucifer had borne witness to his creation but had not interacted with him while he had still been welcome in heaven. Lucifer decided to humor Castiel as he walked in to the cave.
“No! It’s not like I pushed it in all the ten-odd years that it’s been a problem.” Sam runs his hand through his hair. “The end of the world isn’t a good time to get sober. And the world has kind of been ending almost every day for us til recently.”
Dean's mouth opened, but no sound came out. Cas' words bounced around in his brain, echoing strangely. Cas held his gaze for a moment longer and then dropped his eyes again.
… Lucifer returned to the present as the grace from the sigils faded to reveal a collection of holy weapons. Tentatively he reached for a great spear, hefted it in his vessel's hands… but it was not as mighty a weapon as it once was. It had been one of Michael's favored weapons, he thought, before he'd settled on the use of a sword. Within him, Castiel pressed his little grace forward, alight with curiosity. The seraph had not come across this weapon during his foolish war with Raphael.
“That's bullshit. Cas knows we need him, and he knows that Lucifer is full of it. No way he actually wants to be trapped in his meat suit, no way would he give Lucifer that power over him without some serious strings being pulled.” Dean glared at Sam, fists clenching in his lap.
“I looked in that one already.” Dean said, pulling the book away from his brother. “And if it's something the demons made up- we might not have it. The lore we have on angels is spotty at best, anyway-- Remember how Cas threw out like five books because they were full of nonsense?”
timing. Anyway, sometimes seizures happen during the worst parts of alcohol withdrawal. You’re about sixty hours in—”
“Alright, fine, say you're right. What makes you think Crowley would help us? We haven't heard jack from him since we left Hell. He might have thrown in with Lucifer- or Lucifer could have killed him. I'm sure he remembers who helped us take him down last time.”
, but there's no need because a large man with a deep voice and tight curls to match the boy's is already there, lifting the child to his feet, brushing the wood chips off his shirt. Barely a moment, and the boy is smiling again, rushing back onto the structure with his father at his back to support him. Jack settles back onto the bench. Making it to the top of this structure would be the biggest thing this boy has to accomplish today, maybe even this week. He has no need to worry about anything else.
“If it was just an afternoon beer you were giving up, the seizures wouldn’t be a problem!” Sam snaps. “We didn’t know it would happen, but it did, so now we deal with it, same as always.”
“One week.” Dean says finally. “I’ll stop all of it for one week, just to prove I can. No beer, no booze. And if I decide I don’t need to go bone-dry after that, you leave it alone.”
"Thanks, Cas, but..." Sam saw Cas frown and shook his head, leading them towards the appropriate section of the store. "Never mind. I'm glad you want to help. Anyway, the idea is to avoid the stubbed toes all together. We uh... We need nightlights."
“Then I suppose you will have to kiss me, if you wish me awake.” Cas murmured without thinking. Dean stiffened next to him and Cas froze in place for a moment, terrified that Dean would pull away.
"You." John summed up. He was definitely glaring now. Dean looked down at his hands, picking at the loose skin at his thumb.
“Wha—no, he doesn’t.” Dean knows he was rough with the kid in the beginning. After Mary died as well. Dean couldn’t forgive him fully, but he had tried, hadn’t he? He’d made him birthday cake and watched Scooby Doo. Jack didn’t
“Nah. Not in the mood.” He gives Cas a smile and snuggles more firmly into his pillow. “Let’s just sleep.”
Cas and Dean share their first kiss at midnight on New Year’s Eve. Castiel likes it so much that he starts zapping them into different time zones so that they can share more midnight kisses, until Dean explains with a laugh that kissing is not an activity that they must constrain to midnights. It’s the best news Cas has heard all year.
This is ridiculous, of course. Castiel has had sexual intercourse before—with the Reaper, April, with Daphne Allen, even a brief, frenzied moment of not-quite-passion with Crowley as they were hunting Lucifer (he was not proud of that one). He has observed humanity for thousands of years, and he does not think that anything could happen between Dean and himself in the bedroom that would surprise him after all of that.
Cas’ scowl borders dangerously on a pout as he pulls back and sweeps out of the room, empty mugs in hand, and Dean allows himself to chuckle. Of the many inconveniences that came with being human, brushing his teeth seems to be Cas’ true kryptonite. Sam was on a campaign to force him to do it regularly, twice a day, but so far results had been mixed. The former angel did not like the feeling of the brush against his teeth, his gums, or (Billie forbid) the roof of his mouth. He did not like the consistency of the toothpaste. He did not like to gargle. Sam was beginning to despair, and Dean knows he isn’t much help, often slipping Cas a piece of gum to freshen his breath rather than go through the work of forcing him to use ‘proper dental hygiene.’
“Because they'd captured Alistair and wanted you to torture, him. I remember.” Sam's scowl deepened as he remembered the week Dean had spent in the hospital afterward, recovering from Alistair's assault. “What about it?”
Castiel thrashed inside him angrily, ever protective of the two mud-monkeys he had sacrificed so much for. The seraph had taken particular umbrage at Lucifer's interaction with Dean Winchester- a violation of Dean's personal space, he'd said, an unfair deceit.
Third: I'm doing my best to handle these issues with the seriousness they deserve. Feel free to let me know if I should tag something or if something is harmful, but also remember to be kind.
Dean thinks he’s turned a corner. There’d been one more seizure, 3 days after the first no less intense but less scary because this time Cas was prepared, and when Dean stiffened and lost his balance on his way to bed one night, Cas had immediately started counting seconds while smoothly catching Dean and laying him on his side. When it was over, Cas had rubbed soothingly at Dean’s overextended muscles and spoken to him until he came back to himself and was able to settle into bed. That had been four days ago, and finally the nausea, headaches, and the anger and confusion in his head seemed to have at last retreated. To top it off, Dean is currently laying on his memory foam mattress, with Cas laying on top of him, his dark hair messily spread across Dean’s chest, his nose tickling the space between Dean’s pecs. Cas is not quite asleep, Dean knows, but he’s close to it. He runs his hand over Cas’ back, letting his fingers trace the knobs of the former angel’s spine.
“So, how, um...” Dean cleared his throat, eyes on the angel's bent head. He felt a sudden urge to run his fingers through the messy dark hair, to muss it up until Cas was forced to look up at him. It wasn't right for Cas to be avoiding his gaze- that only happened when Cas felt he had done something wrong. And however Cas was feeling, however he was- Dean nearly rolled his eyes at the thought-
Dean lets out a long, beleaguered sigh and rests his forehead on the wheel for a second before looking back at Eileen.
, but they managed to get back to the Bunker in one piece (and when had Sam assigned the Bunker a capital 'B'? It felt right, though.)
Dean almost drops the bottle as he turns to see Cas squinting at him. He can’t help but smile—one thing they discovered when Cas started sleeping again was that though he was a fairly light sleeper, he was not by any means a morning person. He always looked irritated that his mind dared to wake him before he’d slept his fill, with his dark hair mussed and his brow wrinkled in consternation. Dean’s heart flutters in his chest to see that face in his bed.
“Well, it was hard to miss after he strolled in here and snapped Mother’s pretty neck.” Crowley drawled. “It put him in a good enough mood that he didn't bother with me, and I made myself scarce afterward.”
“I didn’t throw it out, it just got lost.” Dean grumps as Cas joins them both at the table. “Not like either of us could solve the damn thing.”
“I will be as gentle as I can, Dean.” Castiel insisted, seeing the hesitation on Dean's face. He seemed distressed that Dean might not come with him. Dean sighed and nodded.
"Mmhm. His Sammy. No one else's. You screamed the first time we tried to send you back to nursery school after Sammy came home from the hospital." Mary says to Dean. "Wanted him to come with you, or you weren't going."
“I’m not fucking hiding.” Dean pitches the empty bottle into a bush. “I just wanted a drink in peace.”
Cas’ eyes flicker to the edge of the bed, where the cap of the bottle is just visible. Dean wavers for a moment, but then puts it back down.
Miracle listened to the whispered mutterings about Cas, about how that stupid bastard had dared to tell Dean he loved him and then just left. How he had somehow, stupidly thought that Dean didn’t love him back. How Dean hadn’t said anything back, *how could he have not said anything back* and--
“Dammit, Cas, how many times to I have to tell you...” He grumbled as he turned around to face his friend. He found Castiel standing behind him, staring with his usual intensity.
He just wants to calm down. He turns the key, listens to the engine turn over, feels his heart pounding in his chest, and then—
“Perhaps;” Father said. “But perhaps not. I am not meant to bear it, Lucifer.” And Lucifer stretched his wings out to their fullest extent, puffed his chest and said proudly-
“It occurred.” Crowley said irritably. “But I had to look out for Crowley, and that meant that I had to wait for you two knuckleheads to work it all out. Lucifer let me live once- I doubt he'd be so charitable if I blew his cover. And yes, Mother is dead. Ding dong, and all that.”
"Cas...." Dean trails off. What can he say? He’d never thought about it before but looking back… he thinks of fingers through his hair, on his shoulder. Days without the hangover.
But he also knew that when Cas was back, he'd been able to cut back on his drinking. Of course, he drank more beer than water, he was still an alcoholic... but it wasn't bad. It wasn't drinking ‘til he was passed out in his own vomit on the floor, it wasn't shaking hands and slurred words and out of control anger. It was... baseline, he supposed. He was never drunk when he drove Baby (his BAC might disagree, but he'd built up a tolerance, dammit, and a lot of experience, and he knows where his limits are), and a glass or two of whiskey before bed wasn't the same as passing out drunk. When he did get wasted, he wasn't nasty with Cas around. He laughed, snorted beer out his nose. Got a little clumsy. Maybe leaned into Cas' touch a little more, maybe let himself rest his head on his shoulder. He ruffled Jack's hair until it was sticking out in every imaginable direction, leaving Jack looking like a disgruntled rooster and Sam guarding his own hair with defensive arms, face caught somewhere between a scowl and a laugh. It was good. It was fine. When Cas was here, even the hangovers weren't bad. He would sometimes wake up on the couch in the Dean Cave to Cas brushing his fingers over his shoulder or through his hair and alerting him to a glass of water on the end table. When Cas was gone… well, the less said about that the better.
interesting if he wasn't so busy trying to make himself breathe. "We are going to eat Mary's dish. You will enjoy the privilege of time with your wife and sons. And then we will crush that pearl and return you to 2003." Cas turns his head from John to face Dean. "I am sorry, Dean, but the temporal distortions will only grow. For now they are confined to Lebanon, but soon they will consume the world. Mary will disappear. People you've saved will die. You and Sam will lose your memories of this time and find yourselves on a different path, as you saw in town before. And I... Well, I don't know what will happen to me. But I do know I would rather die as I am, with you, than return to what I was before we met."
Additional warnings for this chapter include descriptions of a tonic seizure and Dean getting pretty nasty.
"Jack? You're kind of glowing, buddy." Dean's voice is cautious, and Jack tilts his head at him, then at Sam and Castiel.
“No, Dean.” Cas suddenly seemed anxious. “I want to give you your birthday present. I've been working on it for some time now.”
And the hunts were coming in less often-- Dean often wondered if that was Jack’s doing, or if hunts only seemed less prevalent in comparison to the insanity that had been their lives for the last decade or so. It made Dean edgy, even as Sam had begun to relax and spend more time canoodling with Eileen while pretending they were doing research. So Dean spent a lot of time with Miracle, who stayed faithfully at his side as he searched for hunts or worked on Baby or even turned on a show in the Dean Cave.
“It’s not, actually.” Came a voice that was all too familiar. Before either Sam or Dean could process what was happening... they were beside their car. Both of them, standing strong and healthy.
“Dean, are you alright?” Cas’ voice is high, frantic. Sam gives Dean’s hands a squeeze before letting go and pulling back, giving Cas room to jump in and cradle Dean’s face. “I didn’t get the time, but it wasn’t more than a minute, it can’t have been, I’m so sorry I didn’t get the—”
“I want to call Jack and tell him he can come home.” Cas says as he considers the bottom face of the cube—it was blue, opposite of the green side that Cas had assembled to start.
"Dean, please." Shit, the tears are back. "You are so wonderful. The most caring man in the world. You deserve to experience all the good in the world without being drawn back to this bottle. You deserve to be one of Jack's fathers. We all love you dearly... I love you." Dean's brain short circuits. "I want to grow old with you, Dean. I want you to grow old with me. I know that it will be difficult- I could have cured you of your physical dependence when I had my powers but... but I thought it should be your choice. So I am asking you, please- make that choice now. I will be with you every step of the way." And Cas
“I am proud of you, Dean. I want you to know that. These past weeks have been difficult for you. I should not have assumed.”
raised his eyes to meet Dean's. “I love you enough that I would see all creation burn before allowing you to come to harm.”
The sky was beautiful, not like anything Dean had seen before. The stars were bright and twinkling, woven into a brilliant stream of light that glowed gently and in many colors. There was green and indigo and blue, all swirling together, the colors seeming to chase each other around the stars.
“You are, Dean. You never let yourself see it. That's why I made this for you. I want you to see some measure of what I see inside you.” Cas smiled tenderly at Dean and gently tilted his head up to the sky once more. “Look- you are not without darkness. I know this. But the darkness in you makes the light shine even more brightly- like the stars in the night. This is you, Dean. This is what you are to me.”
Sam started leaving the hallway lights on at night. The bright fluorescents made him blink rapidly when he opened his door, waking his brain up far more than a late night bathroom or kitchen run should. They also crept through the cracks in the door, distractingly bright. Dean didn't sleep as well, Sam noticed. He woke up grumpier. He never talked about why, but one night Sam heard his brother screaming "NO, CAS NOOOOO!!" and as he looked at his door with the fluorescent light around it, the sickening thought occurred to him that it looked very much like an angel's grace flaring out.
“I tried to get you pie. And beer. Before- before Metatron.” Cas stepped into the room, scratching the back of his neck. “When you were angry with me. I- I wanted to make it up to you, Dean.”
All these years, so many crashes and rebuilds later, Sam still can’t believe Dean had pushed those back in every time. Sam puts the car in drive, his eye catching on the toy soldier still dutifully shoved in the ash tray as he backs out of the parking lot. He remembers getting the soldier stuck when he was six years old, pretending it was fending off a hoard of werewolves. Remembers being afraid John would be angry, remembers Dean preempting their father’s reaction by saying he’d done it, and that Sammy would sleep better with the soldier watching over them. Remembers a rare laugh from John, his huge hands ruffling both their hair, a warm rumbling voice saying, “I’ve been meaning to quit smoking, anyways.” He remembers waking up that night to see the soldier’s helmet and the tip of its little plastic gun silhouetted in the window and feeling safer, just like Dean had said.
Sam grimaces as he lifts a third pack of Gatorade into his basket at the local Gas ‘N’ Sip. He had helped Cas do the research, he’d known, intellectually, what this week would be like. To face it though… that has been another matter entirely. It had started mild enough that Sam had foolishly hoped Dean would be lucky- that somehow, he would be spared the worst parts of alcohol withdrawal. Unfortunately, it hadn’t worked out that way.
Love is all these things and more. Some things less pleasurable than others. It’s the way his stomach turns over when the Winchesters are in danger, the way his heart broke in two whenever Jack was sad. It’s the lump in his all too human throat right now, seeing Dean’s hands shake.
“Alright, alright.” Dean recognizes Cas building up to a rant. “I was just making sure. I wasn’t trying to be a dick about it.”
Five months after Jack became God, the boy materializes in the bunker. Castiel is at his side, and they both have identical smiles.
“Mmm… feels good.” Cas mumbles, nuzzling further into Dean’s chest, his own hands resting at Dean’s sides.
“My loyalties lie exactly where they always have- with myself. It's not that I don't adore you, Squirrel. I just love myself more. At any rate, I certainly didn't think it would take you this bloody long for you to realize your boyfriend was out of sorts. Now, I assume you have a plan of some sort, because if not I'm going to have to kindly ask you to bug off before Lucifer gets it in his head to track me down.”
“Yeah, whatever.” Dean rubbed his fingers roughly over his eyes. “I just don't get it, man. Lucifer still needs permission to possess someone, right? I don't understand why Cas would let him in, I really don't.”
“Dammit, Cas. I ain’t good at this.” He looked down at his dirty boots, still wet with vampire blood, then up at Cas again. With determination, he cupped Cas’ face in his hands.
“Breakfast for dinner?” Sam’s voice is far to judgy for someone who once subsisted on Lucky Charms alone. He should bring that up to Eileen, Dean reflects. She might get a kick out of it.
He is not used to Dean in withdrawal. He isn’t used to shaking hands, to a sweaty face and a drawn expression, to food that won’t stay down and rage that refuses to be regulated. The second day he’d asked Jack to go visit Jody for a while, alarmed at Dean’s condition. Jack had been reluctant to leave but agreed after Dean and Cas insisted as well.
"It was my understanding that the purpose of a birthday gift was to demonstrate the depth of my regard for you."
“I think I’d prefer people didn’t swear to me either.” Jack says thoughtfully, and then Dean is wrapping his arms around him too.
Dean feels Cas’ breath in an amused puff against his chest, and another nuzzle of his stubbled face, before the man rolls off of him.
There are no windows in most parts of the bunker, and most of the light switches are decades old and inconveniently placed. There is a solution.
“I didn't mean--” Cas began, but then he felt soft lips press against his forehead. He froze again. The lips moved to his temple. His grace rejoiced within him, dancing and healing. He felt calloused fingers brush against his neck and touch the underside of his chin, tilting his head up. Dean's mossy green eyes searched his for a moment. Cas' grace thrummed in anticipation, pushing against the surface of his vessel to be as close to Dean as possible- he didn't know it was possible to
“Yes, he is.” Cas agrees. Then he holds his hand out to Dean. “I understand that he helped you plant a garden. Will you show me?”
When Castiel was in the bunker, it didn't seem to bother him. Angels could probably see in the dark, Sam thought. And of course the war room always had some lighting, indicating that everything was working-- oh.
TW for alcoholism and descriptions of anxiety (though that isn't the name that is put to it- yet). Please take care of yourselves!
“Ummm, why?” Dean quirked an eyebrow as Cas actually went to the closet to retrieve Dean's shoes for him. “You gonna take me to the bar with the money
Miracle was not overly fond of the smell of alcohol. He licked one of Dean’s beer bottles once and had been whining and passing his paws over his nose for several minutes after. Dean tried to curb his drinking around the dog after that.
Sam tried to be there too, of course he did. Dean’s little brother didn’t have to be told the details of Cas’ death to know Dean was suffering his loss. He tried to be encouraging.
Dean throws back his head and laughs, imagining Cas’ face when he is denied something sweet, and feeling lighter than he had since Cas had lost his powers, he guides their son to the kitchen.
“It’s a seizure, Cas, you need to keep time!” Sam has no time to be nice. Dean’s back is arching as his muscles tighten, his fists curling. Sam takes his brother’s hands, wincing as his fingernails cut into skin. He is distantly aware of Cas frantically scrambling for his phone, but by the time he grabs it, it’s already over. Dean lets out a heavy sigh and his body seems to relax. When he rolls onto his side, it is under his own power, and the groan he lets out is much more natural than that awful keening.
Dean, who had been flipping half-heartedly through yet another ancient book from the Men of Letters library, leapt nearly a foot in the air. Cas had been making himself scarce lately, scarce enough that Dean was no longer used to his sudden appearences.
“You 'require more love.' Jesus, you're a worse princess than Sammy.” He complained playfully. “But I guess it is my duty, isn't it?” And without waiting for an answer, he leaned in to kiss Cas again.
"Mary doesn't cook." Cas had not taken his eyes off of John, his stare intense. John was staring right back.
“What, now you’re getting on my case too?” Dean knows Eileen doesn’t deserve his ire, and at rubs his hand in a circle over his heart. ‘Sorry’ was one of the only signs Dean had learned. “I’m sick of this, Eileen. I’m
“Alright.” He rolls onto his back, reaching to his bedside table to pick up the Rubik’s cube he’d left there. Dean snorts next to him.
Jack greets them in the war room with a cheery wave. There is a board game of sorts spread out on the table, with many colorful pieces. He takes stock of them for a moment- Cas is painfully aware that he’s checking for any tension between them, for the anger that sometimes rolls off of Dean in waves.
“Whatcha got there, kid?” Dean asks, oblivious. Cas knows that he writes off much of Jack’s behavior as ‘weird angel stuff’, much like he did with Cas himself before they came to know each other for so many seasons.
“Not about this, you're not. Not about family. You get dumb about Cas almost as much as you get dumb about me. You take risks, you don't think things through.”
The last two days have been difficult. Dean did not announce his intention to get sober so much as grumpily pour out the most accessible liquor bottles the afternoon after his talk with Cas and leave the bottles out for Sam to find. Sam had tried to address it, but Dean had looked at him with thunder in his eyes and Sam backed off, choosing instead to exchange a meaningful glance with Cas.
“I know I said I was gonna be hands off. But I, uh... I thought you guys deserved this. And I know I’m God now but...” He shrugged. “Cas says I’m still only 3 years old. So... I need my Dads.”
"You've- you don't need to heal our stubbed toes, Cas. Everyone gets them, they're only bruises." Sam rubbed a hand over his face. Castiel's mojo had been a bit inconsistent since he reappeared from Purgatory. He didn't need to waste it on something so small.
“They do, though.” Cas pauses again for a long moment, draining his mug before setting it and Dean’s down on the end table. “You may not see it. Or perhaps you choose not to. But they do care. And they do worry, just as I do. Sam does, especially.”
Cas sighs loud enough to be heard even as Dean heads out the door, making Dean smile. Cas had been brushing once a day in solidarity with Dean stopping drinking, and to hear him, it was the worst part of his day.
“I believe so, yes… though in truth, that depends on you.” Cas shifted and winced, rubbing at his chest where his aching grace was fluttering. “If you are not sincere in your gestures, they will not be effective in healing me.” There was a pregnant pause where Dean seemed to be steeling himself for something, then Cas spoke again, sounding vaguely amused. “You don't have to kiss me, Dean.”
“I won’t.” Cas squeezes Dean’s hand. “And you should not worry about being jealous of the flower man.”
So, I'm all aboard that "fuck john winchester" train, but I don't like to write him as a monster. I think he is a very complex character who Dean has very complex feelings about-- who they all have complex feelings about (except Cas, Cas ain't impressed). I tried to impart here that John was a shitty father, but he did still love his kids and his kids loved him. That he and Mary weren't a story book couple, but they still loved each other. IDK if I succeeded.
“Alcoholism is a disease with both physical and psychological components.” Cas interrupts. “The very shape of the human brain changes because of it. Dean has always been… wary… of any interference with his mind by angels. As have you.”
“Cas says a late dinner, probably.” Dean begins rummaging through the cabinets and refrigerator, cataloguing the available ingredients. “I’m making pancakes for the kid. With the fixin’s.”
“Not if he didn't know it… say, Crowley. That's an idea.” Dean replied speculatively as he finished off his meal. As King of Hell- as a demon- Crowley had access to spells and incantations that may not be in the Men of Letters library… especially considering that Dean was growing more and more certain the spell that he had in mind was demonic in origin.
“What that was, Dean, was a taste of what receiving your love feels to me. Human souls and angel graces are not so different, excepting that souls are smaller and more grounded in the physical. The same way love sustains an angel, so too does it sustain a soul. Of course, humans often dismiss this as sentiment, as it is not a physical sensation- a human will not expire without love, without renewal on the spiritual level. They can remain physically fit, and even content to some degree, and not know what they are missing.” Cas smiled and gently pressed his hand to Dean's shoulder again, noting Dean shiver at the touch. “When I placed this mark on you, I was repairing you- body and soul. In those moments, your soul discovered what it was like to receive love as an angel would- it came into direct contact with my grace. Your mind may not retain the memories- my true form remains too overwhelming for human comprehension- but your soul
“Good.” Dean says after a moment. “I’ve actually missed the kid.” And he had. Jack being gone had bothered him more than he likes to admit. The kid had such a lightness to him, despite… Well, Dean had plenty to be ashamed of there, including his own lingering anger. He rubs at his mouth again. “I’ll make pancakes.”
“I know of them. I think I might know what you have in mind.” There was a hint of hesitation in Crowley's voice. “I think we'd be better off discussing this in person. More secure, you understand.”
It was not a unique occurrence, and even after Sam started using his phone flashlight, they would often bump into each other if they were both in the hallway after they'd turned the lights out for the night. Both Winchesters were large men, after all. This was to say nothing of the stubbed toes on the slight lip that led into the bathroom, or the glasses of water knocked off the end table by searching hands (this happened more to Sam than to Dean, but only because Dean would often fall asleep with his beer cradled in his arms like an infant.
Dean looks at what Cas grabbed, and is startled to find that it is a 6 pack of his favorite beer. His brow furrows—he hadn’t intended to pick it up.
“The lore…” Dean snorts and then shakes his head, looking up at the sky where the first stars are appearing. “Christ.”
"That is something I cannot give you." The angel muttered. Sam bit back a grin and placed a bag containing apple pie on the table.
"You ain't human." John pronounces, and Dean winces, locking eyes with Sam. Sam clears his throat and approaches.
“You planting this garden isn’t going to make you go all… honey crazy again, is it?” Dean asks, remembering in vivid detail how Cas, still suffering from taking on Sam’s hallucinations, had shown up on the Impala naked and covered in bees… though that was not such an unpleasant memory, now that he thought on it. He would not be opposed to it happening again… so long as it was without the bees.
“They are Father's creatures, Lucifer. You did not give them Life.” How many times had he heard this phrase repeated at him, first from Michael, and then from that suck-up Raphael? Gabriel never nagged him so, but that was likely because he was busy badgering Father about the state of the platypus and when would it be his turn to see his designs come to life? Father used to laugh at Gabriel and tell him to be patient.
"Y-yeah." Sam ran a hand through his hair. "See, a lot of kids- they're afraid of the dark. So that even whatever light comes from the window isn't really enough. So, their parents get them nightlights to keep on when they go to sleep, in case they get up." He gestured at the lights. "These plug right into the wall."
“Yeah, but we manage.” Sam pauses, an awful thought occurring to him. “You… are you regretting it? Becoming human?”
Sam scoffed again, but under Cas' unyielding gaze, he sheepishly grabbed a light shaped like Hulk's fist. Cas nodded in approval before grabbing one shaped like Thor's hammer.
"Yes. I enjoyed the films as well. Dean will not hate this." As though that was the final word on the matter, Cas plucked the box off the shelf and dropped it into their cart. Then he turned back to consider the shelf. "One light will not be enough. The Captain has several team members- which is your favorite, Sam?"
“It probably will be, Cas.” Dean says, cavalier. “Hunts haven’t stopped coming in, or gotten any less dangerous. But someone has to do it—”
“I’m not getting drunk off of a couple of beers, Cas.” Dean says unrepentantly, tilting his head back to chase the last few drops down, the evening light caressing his throat and casting shadows with his eyelashes. “This isn’t even the good stuff. It’s basically kiddie juice.”
But John is already crossing the room, getting in Cas' face, fisting his hands in the trench coat, yelling about how Cas wasn't human and had no place in his family and Cas isn't budging an inch. He wouldn't. Dean could hear Sam running towards the room, could hear Mary shouting from the kitchen about what was wrong, but he couldn't breathe as he watched John deliver what would have been a devastating blow on to Cas' face, if Cas had been human.
"There is no outlet near the bathroom." Cas said. He was looking away from the shelves now. "What are those for?"
"It ain't hard to figure out, Cas." Dean shrugs. He goes to take a swig from the bottle and is startled when Cas is suddenly in his bed, stopping him from taking the drink.
John shouts in pain and surprise instead as his hand breaks against Cas' cheek. Cas doesn't even turn his head like he did for Dean back in the beautiful room a full decade ago. John prepares another blow, but Cas effortlessly shoves him against the wall with one arm as Sam skids into view.
He decides to grow up the slow way this time. He decides to be too short to reach the sink without a stool, too uncoordinated to write his name neatly. He decides to use a nightlight and learn to ride a bike and paint messy watercolors of Daddy, Papa, and Tatti in kindergarten. He decides to let Dean sing him old Zeppelin songs to make him sleep when he's cranky, to let Sam lift him on his shoulders to tower high above the world. He decides to curl up on Castiel's lap to read 'The Little Prince.' He decides to let Claire paint his nails and dress him like a doll and sneak him pieces of nougat.
I based what went on in the bedroom on some personal experience and also on the idea that while Cas isn't quite virginal, he still views his relationship with Dean as something big and new because he is human now AND because it is Dean he's with.
Lucifer stood silently near a cave at the lowest point of the Grand Canyon. Distantly, he remembered the battle that had helped form this wonder of the world, one of the earliest battles against the Darkness. That was when he was still a young angel, before many of his brothers and sisters had been created. It had only been his Father and his fellow archangels, standing shoulder to shoulder against the chaos that was the Darkness. He had been the favored son then, the Morningstar, with his eight strong, shining wings beating in the air of a new Earth. The battles had changed the shape of the planet and raged across the stars.
He doesn’t let himself hope that Cas will come home to him. But the first time Miracle digs up some weeds, Dean gently pulls him away and plants flowers in their place. Cas would like them, he knows. Before long, between Miracle’s (targeted) digging and Dean’s planting, there is a respectable garden going. Dean thinks about how Cas would harvest some of the vegetables for “sandwiches of solidarity” if (when) he came back, and he smiles.
Dean still couldn't speak. His brain was barely processing what had just been said. He'd known, of course, that Cas cared for him- the guy had given up everything for his sake, after all. He cared for Cas too- not something that he often admitted out loud, even to himself. Love, though… that was a concept he had long since stopped allowing himself the luxury of considering, except perhaps in his deepest dreams. And yet here Cas was, speaking it aloud so matter-of-factly, as though it were something tangible, something possible.
“I want.” Castiel insists, turning to face Dean more fully. He stretches his hand out and Dean takes it. Cas doesn’t know if it’s his hand shaking or Dean’s. “We can try again.”
Sometimes Dean would start hyperventilating. Sometimes in bed, sometimes at the computer. Once halfway back to his room from the bathroom, he slid down to sit against the wall as he gasped sobs into his hands. Every time, Miracle would find him and press his warm, furry body against Dean’s side, his snout finding his way under Dean’s arms to press against his face.
"We need something to light the hall, or at least stick by the bathroom." Sam got them back on task. He reached for one of the plainer looking lights.
Dean knows he is an alcoholic. But it wasn’t a problem. It wasn’t supposed to be a problem. The more he thinks about it, the worse he feels. What is Cas thinking? Does he expect him to just… go cold turkey? Drink smoothies and start talking about his feelings? That’s not who Dean is, it’s never been. He can’t do this. He pulls the bottle back up and unscrews the cap. The scent is strong and comforting.
Cas’ mouth trembles in what might have been a smile, and Sam congratulates himself on his word choice, even as his heart aches again. He and Dean both need to let Cas know how much they appreciate him more often.
“My grace is bolstered only by your presence. When you put your hand on my shoulder, when you laugh at my jokes… when you gave me this blanket.” Cas pulled the blanket tighter around himself. “I already told you. You do not need to be 'Prince Charming.'”
Castiel should have expected the incredulous laugh. It was precisely the reason he had been keeping to himself and not telling Dean 'No Chick Flick Moments' Winchester why he healed slower on his own than he did with Sam and Dean around. That frankly unattractive snort that said human being had just emitted was exactly why he did not actively encourage the affectionate behavior that would soothe and bolster his grace, allowing him to heal, and instead resigned himself to making his way through Netflix's entire streaming catalog while his wilting, lonesome grace slowly knitted itself back together.
“I am not finished healing. I require more love from you.” Cas said. His face was straight but Dean saw a hint of mischief in his eyes. Dean barked out a laugh, rolling his eyes.
The usual TW in this chapter for alcoholism, withdrawal, and recovery applies, but I would say more so here than in previous chapters. Please stay safe and check the end notes for more detailed warnings.
Dean is quick to get between Cas and his father. His heart is pounding in his throat suddenly. He can't bring himself to look either of them in the eye, and that doesn't make sense. It's not as though-- it's not as though he and Cas are together or anything. Or as though Cas knows how he feels. It's not like John will be able to just-- read his mind-- and know... but then, there were those nuns he had to burn, and he'd been convinced John didn't know then either and shit he's panicking he should say something he should--
Dean doesn't even have to know that Cas is doing that thing where he tilts his head and squints and either looks like the cutest puppy or like he's going to cook you to death with his laser eyes, and he really cannot have a confrontation happen--
"Of course we would, Jack." Sam hurries to answer. He's translating for Dean as well, Jack thinks. Worried that Dean's abrasiveness would make Jack sad like he'd been when Castiel had been dead and Dean had hated him. He shouldn't worry so much.
"Whatever." He eventually pronounced. "If you need to put up lights, decorate your little heart out, Martha Stewart. Just stay out of my room. Meanwhile, I'll be doing actually useful things, like cleaning the guns." Dean shoveled another peace of pie into his mouth, and the conversation was over. Sam gathered the white string lights went to set them against the wall in the hallways. He decided having them on the floor and then going over the door frames would be best.
Sam turns towards his friend and his brother and immediately clocks Cas’ concern. Dean is sitting stiffly, his jaw working, his eyes staring straight up at the ceiling but completely unfocused. In Cas’ lap, his feet are curled and his legs fully extended, almost unnaturally so.
The usual triggers for this chapter regarding alcoholism, and the usual reminder that Dean does not know how to deal with things in a healthy way.
“You said you couldn’t have what you wanted. I say different.” Dean watched Cas’ eyes widen, clocked them tracing over his face and darting to his lips. He leaned in, his nose brushing against the angel’s. “I can’t promise you the world. Cas. I can’t promise to be everything you want. But I really, really want to try. It was never a good time before. But now?” He nudged Cas’s nose with his again. “Can we try?”
“How simple it is to create chaos with a twist of one’s wrist. There are trillions of ways to twist this cube away from its original state. Quintillions, even.”
“You just described the life of every hunter I know.” Dean snorts. “No one in this life is sleeping pretty or making that apple pie thing work.”
“It is so freaking weird that you get references like that now.” Dean muttered, perching on the edge of the bed. “Look, man, I didn't mean to laugh at you, alright?”
“Was it unpleasant for you?” Cas asked, suddenly concerned. Humans were such physical creatures- he had no way of knowing if the sort of metaphysical reaction that had occurred between him and Dean might have been too overwhelming.
“Jack did all that?” Dean mused, looking around at the broad, open concept that was the new Heaven. Bobby- *his* Bobby, he thought with some wild glee- raised his bottle of beer in salute.
Jack looks up when one of the children in the park he is in shrieks. It's a little boy and he's fallen off one of the climbing structures. Jack reaches out a hand instinctively, to fix, to
“I’m proud of you, Dean.” Cas says softly. He gives a rare, toothy smile, and Dean suppresses a laugh at the sight of blue specks of toothpaste lingering at the corners of his lips.
“After coffee.” He stipulates, and is so taken with Cas’ answering smile that he barely processes Cas tilting his head up by the chin to kiss him until he’s already pulled away. Cas slides out of bed and stretches again, bigger this time, before ambling out of the room, scratching his belly. Dean watches him go before drawing his knees up to his chest, resting his head there a moment.
"Yeah. We had a deal, I thought. I was gonna be in control, and then he was gonna leave me. I thought maybe we could send him back to apocalypse world or something after. We-- me and Michael-- we killed Lucifer. But he didn't leave. He took me over and he did things... he's been organizing the monsters, setting up traps for hunters. Pumping them full of angel juice to make them less vulnerable to us-- we ran into a djinn that could full create things, man. Like, in real life. But Sam and Cas, they brought me back. I have Michael locked away, in here." Dean tapped his head. "And he's locked up tight, but I can't... I can't keep him locked away forever. He's pounding and pounding at my head, he won't let up, and so I can't let up. And I'm gonna break, Dad. I broke in hell and I'm gonna break this time, I know I am. I need help." Dean felt his voice crack and his eyes dampen, and he made himself look up at his father. "The pearl... I was supposed to be able to make a wish, and Michael would be gone. But you're here now. And I need you to help fix this, Dad. Please."
"He would have found you entering the Malak box an acceptable sacrifice. Because of his own inadequacies as a father, you also find this acceptable. I cannot forgive that." Cas holds up his hand to forestall Dean's protest. "But I'm glad you got that dinner with him."
It’s the way his name (Cas now, just Cas. No longer Castiel, God’s Shield. Dean had claimed him completely) sounded so right and safe in Dean’s mouth, like it was meant to be there.
"Dean likes this character." Cas said abruptly. He indicated a box featuring a light shaped like Captain America's shield. "We watched two of the movies featuring him together. He believes that Steve Rogers is 'bad-ass'"
?” He snarled, whipping around to glare at his brother. Sam met his gaze steadily, recognizing the wild look in his eyes that only emerged when one of the few people that held a piece of his heart was in danger.
Well, that was longer than I thought. But there you have it. Cas' Thor nightlight is in the kitchen.
“Yeah, Cas, it's great. It's more than great.” Dean shifted uncomfortably- Cas had been keeping him warm, but had not been able to keep the snow from soaking in to his weather- inappropriate shoes.
“That’s great!” Sam smiles up at Dean. Eileen looks up in question, and Sam raises both of his fists, with his index fingers crooked out in front of them as though holding a trigger and his thumbs pointed up. He taps his knuckles and the tips of his bent index fingers together twice in quick succession, then with his right hand closes his fingers like a break and touches them first to the corner of his mouth, then to his temple. Eileen’s face brightens and she stands up, closing her laptop.
“You hate research.” Sam counters. Dean considers this for a moment, before swiping at his lips and turning away.
"Right, so... Cas stuck around after we stopped the apocalypse. Things in heaven... well, it's messy, but the point is it's better for Cas to be on Earth with us. He's family, he... anyway, he's here. And I, uh, I told you how mom came back..."
“Especially me.” Cas corrected gently. “I've… gone off the reservation, Dean. To you, I may not seem so, but I am not the same angel I was when we met. I know,” Cas was swift to cut off Dean's protest before it began, “that you feel this change is a good thing; I do too. The fact remains, however, that my grace has been fundamentally altered for it.” Cas dared to meet Dean's eyes for a moment before returning his gaze to his hands. “I am not meant to feel the way I do. An angel's love is meant to be pure, but cold. Distant. All-encompassing, rather than directed towards singular beings. But it has been years since I have loved that way, and years since receiving that sort of love has been truly satisfying to me.”
“I’m sure Jack is gonna get him out of it, Dean. He’ll come back. Cas always comes back to us- to you.” Sam squeezed his shoulder.
"I go, or you do?" John says at last, checking with Mary. Dean's chest is tight, and he barely registers Cas walking towards him. "You go back to being dead if I stay."
it. He'd fix it, and he'd be disappointed in Dean, but Michael would be gone and Mom and Dad would be together, and Sam would have both his parents for the first time in his life.
“He does.” Cas has both of Dean’s hands in his, his thumbs stroking over Dean’s fluttering pulse. “He isn’t angry with you. In fact, I… I think he believes he deserves your ire.” Dean cannot handle the sadness in Cas’ voice. “He doesn’t. And he certainly does not deserve to feel afraid of you. Not in his own home. Not when he loves you so much. Dean, you
Dean wants a drink. Badly. And he’s absolutely fucking pissed that he can’t have one. There’s not even any booze left in the bunker, from what he can tell. He’d gone on a desperate search the night after he’d had his seizure, taking advantage of the uneasy sleep Cas had fallen into. With shaking hands he’d gone through all the cabinets, checked the garage, looked in the fridge, and the place was bone dry. All his efforts had yielded was a startled yelp from Sam when he walked in on him making out with Eileen in the library. Swearing, he’d returned to bed, ignoring Castiel’s confused sleepy grumblings. Now, another twelve hours of absolute misery later, he’s moving restlessly through the bunker once more. He’s sick of this.
“Sounds fake.” Dean yawns again. “Like flabbergasted. Or everywhen.” Another yawn, and a sleepy giggle. “Or dongle.”
The rest of the trip was largely uneventful. Sam snuck a few of the plain night lights into the cart, hoping that if his brother saw options he wouldn't react with his typical displays of toxic manliness. He and Cas picked up a few groceries. He was unsuccessful in stopping Cas from getting the most sugary cereals he could find, and they spent far too long debating peanut butter textures considering one of them
“Where do you think those stories come from…?” Cas started, then in a very human gesture he threw up his hands in defeat. “Never mind, there is clearly no talking to you. Forget I said anything.” And he turns around and strides to his room, ignoring Dean's half hearted protest. He tells himself that he is not hurt.
"We're serious, Dean." Sam said. "I'm tired of bumping into you in the hall, and stubbing my toes on the lip of the bathroom, and knocking over my water-"
“Couple of weeks??” Dean explodes to his feet, all but throwing Cas’ hands off him. “Holy shit, you didn’t think that
Dean does not want to talk about anything. He wants to savor the moment he’s in. Castiel is sprawled out on the bed like a starfish, one of his legs over Dean’s knees, one arm flung up over his head so Dean’s head can rest against the soft flannel covering his ribs. The former angel is snoring softly, and Dean isn’t even annoyed by it. He’s warm, he’s safe. He’s… thirsty. He rolls over as best he can, prompting a snort from Cas as he disturbs the leg flung over his. The bottle of bourbon is resting innocently on the floor next to the bed, nestled on its side between his slippers. Almost without thinking, he grabs it by the neck and hoists it up.
They drove in silence for a while, with no sound between them but the hum of engine and the rattling of the legos. Dean's knuckles were white where they were clutched over the wheel, the muscle in his jaw spasming each time he felt Sam glance at him. Finally Sam heaved one of those sighs that meant he wanted to have some kind of heart to heart. Dean hated that sigh.
Sam winced as he remembered Lucifer tearing through several gods in the lead up to the apocalypse that wasn't. He had a lot of questions about that, to be honest, and Cas could actually answer them, which was just... amazing. Sometimes his life was kind of cool. But first...
“Jack did wonderfully. Has been doing wonderfully.” Cas’ voice is full of pride for his son. Then his too-blue eyes find Dean’s. “Hello, Dean.”
Then Cas lifted his arm to scratch at the back of his neck nervously (a habit he'd likely picked up from one of the Winchester brothers), and he seemed so damn human. “Do you like it? In truth, it's not my best work.” Cas excused nervously.
“I think the water needs to be still for that.” Eileen says, chucking a rock of her own into the water. Dean shrugs and throws another rock.
“Aw, get goin’ you idjit.” Bobby smiled at him in that familiar way that crinkled his eyes. “We can catch up later.”
Dean perked up and made grabby hands at the bag, immediately pushing the parts he'd been cleaning aside.
"OW, Dean, goddammit..." Sam groaned as he rubbed his chin. Dean was just in front of him, presumably rubbing his forehead, but Sam couldn't tell because it was
“No, not about Crowley. About Cas.” Sam allowed that to hang in the air between them for a moment. He knew that what he had to say next would not be received well, but he also knew it had to be said. “There's a chance he might not
“Charlie and Stevie have settled into their loft.” Cas presses on. “They meet up with some of the other hunters from apocalypse world to speak about their experiences.”
“It’s not a very good story, why it is called a ‘Charley horse.’ But he may find it interesting. There’s baseball involved.”
“Yes.” Cas begins to sign along with his speech for Eileen. “I was thinking of starting a garden. Just a small one, outside the bunker. Some flowers for the bees to pollinate, maybe some herbs.”
"Who the hell is this?" John's voice is gruff, but not hostile, that's good. Dean forces himself to meet his father's eye.
“Nah.” Dean finishes unloading the cart, relieved that there are no more surprises in it, and then gestures to Cas. “Everything he’s got, too.”
Sam’s lips were twitching as he lumbered forward to embrace their son, but Dean and Cas stayed stock still, as though they were sizing each other up. Jack tugged on Sam’s sleeve.
“Maybe it was too much too soon?” Dean suggests, not unkindly. “It’s normal to not want to go fast right away.”
“Dean!” Sam is out of his seat and kneeling at his brother’s side in less than a second. “Cas, time him!”
"You think you are. But a wise man said that family doesn't end in blood." Cas looks at Dean, piercing him with his gaze. "Nor does it start there."
A memory stirred from his host. One of Castiel's earliest memories, and it had to do with the platypus, of all things. Gabriel would be pleased to be so remembered.
Dean stopped the car at a familiar dock where fishing equipment was neatly arranged on the side. He stepped out to the end, took in the view. The air smelled cleaner than any he’d ever breathed in life. He wouldn’t have to wait long, he knew--
Cas covered Dean’s hands with his own. “I always do, Dean. As long as you want me.” His face grew serious. “Do you want--”
Sam glanced up at his brother, who was red-faced and glaring at the phone, and decided to take over before Dean's temper lost them their demon up their sleeve.
“Look…?” But Cas had already lifted his eyes to the night sky. Dean followed his gaze and was barely able to contain a gasp.
“Do not trouble yourself, Dean.” Castiel cut him off, still smarting from their earlier exchange. “I do not need you to… 'be Prince Charming.' I will heal on my own.”
“Of course, sir.” She takes the beer and puts it under her register, her eyes darting between him and Cas curiously. “Anything else?”
“I picked this up by mistake.” He tells her, taking the 6 pack from Cas’ hand, leading to one of the seed packets clasped there dropping. “Can you put it back for me?”
“It’s a one-inch difference, Dean.” Cas sits up and stretches his arms over his head, bringing the well-defined muscles in his back into focus. Dean has a brief thought, a horrible thought, of another version of Cas stretching in a similar manner—although that Cas wore dirty clothes, his hair disheveled, the stench of marijuana strong in the ruined cabin, his eyes glazed over with the opioids he took like they were mints… Dean shakes himself, his hand coming up to rub at his mouth. He wishes he could forget about that future which had never come to pass. He can’t understand why it is so difficult to keep away—2014 had come and gone, and the world hadn’t ended, though not for lack of trying. He watches as Cas, his Cas, pulls a t-shirt over his head and snatches his Rubik’s cube from his bedside table. The cube was close to solved, with only the bottom layer left, and Dean knew Cas was somewhat frustrated with it.
Castiel did not turn to look at the door. He was cocooned in the old grey blanket that Dean had given him while he was fighting Rowena's attack dog spell, glazed eyes staring at the television where an animated, purple dog was being emotionally abused by his male owner. Somewhere inside him, his flagging grace perked up at Dean's presence.
“And,” Sam continues. “This had to be something Dean chose. Recovery only really works when you want it to, you know? I’m thinking even if you had healed his brain like you did his liver, all the stuff we’ve been through might have just started him drinking again, rather than figure out some new way of coping. You’ve got nothing to feel guilty about, Cas.”
“Crowley does what he has to do to keep kicking, but I guarantee you he still wants Lucifer gone.” Dean said, sliding into the driver's seat. He turned on the heat against the winter chill and listened a moment to the legos rattling in the vents. “Look, if it goes sideways, we'll deal with it. But right now this is our best chance at helping Cas. That has to be our priority here.”
“Dammit Cas, yes!” Dean slams his hand against the wheel to distract from the rising irritation and anxiety. “After two damn weeks of being freaking miserable, I think I learned my lesson. Christ, it’s like none of you trust me at all.”
"This is what is going to happen." Cas says, his voice dripping with authority, and Dean distantly thinks that he would find that voice
“No, not unpleasant, just… weird. I dunno, I just felt… like I was gonna bust out of my body or something.” Cas smiled.
"I want this, Dean." Cas says firmly, intensely, his too blue eyes boring into Dean's and Dean's not ready to handle this, he's not, but Cas keeps going. "I want to be human. With you. I want to eat your burgers and learn how to shoot. I want to be Jack's father and Sam's brother. I want to sleep and dream, even when the dreams won't always be good. I want... I want whatever this is between us. I want you; don't you doubt that."
Lucifer explained, biting his finger and rubbing blood across a sigil on the floor of the cave. The sigil lit up with ancient grace and Lucifer remembered…
He hopes that John can find a way to fix Dean's head while he's here... and boy, won't that be a conversation to have. His stomach turns over as he watches John and Mary whisper presumably sweet words to each other. He can hear it now, John berating him for allowing Michael in in the first place. John talking about having to clean up Dean's messes-- and Dean supposes that was why the pearl had pulled John forward to this moment. Dad would yell and scold and send Dean away, he would take him to task and never let him forget what he'd done, but Dad would
, Lucifer explained charitably. He frowned. The spear did not have as much power as it had in ancient days. He didn't know if it would be enough. He laid it to the side and reached for another weapon, this time a pearl the size of a tennis ball that once held a piece of God's own light. The light was dim, now. Perhaps it had lost it's power when God had abandoned the Earth.
Dean teeters on the edge of "bad" drinking for a bit, but ultimately, they determine that Cas isn't dying, merely becoming human as a result of all the angels returning to Heaven under Billie’s command. And for the most part, Cas is okay with that. There are some things Cas reacts poorly to (he is absolutely offended the first time he sneezes, and he goes on a manic frenzy of cutting all the tags out of his clothes), but he admits that he finds the idea of being human and growing old with the Winchesters appealing. That he never actually wants to be in Heaven or around other angels anymore, and that he missed tasting peanut butter and jelly properly. So, it's fine.
“Still can’t believe that kid. He thought it was his last day on Earth, and all he wanted to do was drink crap beer and try to catch a fish.” Dean says, sitting against a rock. His hands are shaking again, and he squeezes them into fists.
"Oh." Cas scowled, but did not put the box down. "Dean will not hate these. The colors will make the Bunker more homely."
"Well," John rubs his broken hand. "That's no choice at all. Seems to me that all there is to do is... well." He wraps an arm around Mary. "I can't say I'm sorry for trying to think of ways to keep you safe. But if all we get is a little time, if all we get is dinner... let's have dinner. Winchester surprise. Let's just have this one night as a family."
