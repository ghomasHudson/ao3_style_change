“I thought I lost you a few times too, I don’t want to have to go through that again anytime soon either. When Carruthers stabbed you… it was all I could do not to break his neck. I never want to spend another winter solstice in hospital again.”
“The case took longer than anticipated and we needed to spend the night. The only room left in town only had one bed, some sort of event. In the middle of the night I woke up spooned to Sherlock’s back, rock hard. I ended up wanking in the loo before being able to get back to sleep.
“Hopefully not, but until we get the mark and chip sorted…” Sherlock reassures John as Greg pats John on his right forearm. “Lestrade, go back into the office and see if you can find any more evidence for the recent abductions. I’ll text Mycroft to send an agent over to assist you.”
There is a large green plastic tank on a small flattened area, there is a building behind it. “What’s the building behind?” asks Sherlock.
“And here I thought you knew everything.” Greg jokes, sitting at the table to watch. “So where is John?”
Thankfully, the first suspect they caught up with, Isaack Burrell, was fairly easy to apprehend. John was able to subdue him with minimal effort. Sherlock handcuffed the man to a secure pipe at the alley entrance with a pair of handcuffs stolen from Lestrade the week before. NSY should be able to easily find their location using him as a clue even in the dim twilight light, they weren’t that far behind; the sound of sirens coming closer filled the air. John took off after the two other suspects with Sherlock following at his heels for a change.
“I’ll start a bloody swear jar then!” Pointing at the leather chair next to the cleaned and decorated mantle over the burning fire. “Sit.”
“Partly. But even back then I knew I liked boys as much as girls. I found it was easier to date girls, fewer problems. As I got older, I found I didn’t care for what other people thought as much.”
“Be back in a bit, don’t lock the door!” Greg bids as they hear his heavy footfalls go back down the hall, then down the stairs.
John had a small flashback when he opened the box from Afghanistan that contained a large canning jar filled with sand. It smelled just like the base he was deployed to in Kandahar. The address on this box was the most illegible so far. The writing was hurried and smudged in several places with what looks like sporadic rain drops. John checked the past weather forecast for Afghanistan, there was no rain reported for the past two months. Odd.
We’re still in bed when I receive a text from Lestrade, he needs me to come in and give my statement as soon as I’m able.  Sherlock agrees to come with me, we can pick up Rosie from Molly on the way home as well.
Rubbing Sherlock’s shoulder again, “Major James Sholto” cough, “He was my commanding officer while I was stationed at Helmand. We were both tired, lonely, and a little too drunk one night and took comfort in each other. We’d just got back from a week of hell, one thing led to another and we were giving each other a hand-job in his office. Shortly after that, I was promoted and redeployed to Kandahar.”
John’s favorite item so far sent by his anonymous admirer was a wool jumper from Ireland. The hand knit sweater was in a lovely shade of blue in a similar pattern as his favorite oatmeal jumper his Mum made before she died. It and its box went on the table. He was not sure if it was safe to wear or not. John ran his hand over it every morning on his way into the kitchen to make tea though.
Smiling, lawyer Daggett asked, “You defended yourself against attack from two aggressors with an impaired dominant side?”
Sherlock and I look at one another quickly. I then open the box and look inside. There is a pile of frilly pink fabric and lace. As I pull it out I find it is a beautiful dress in Rosie’s size complete with matching slippers. Bless the woman! “Oh! Mrs Hudson you are a godsend! I forgot to pick out something for Rosie to wear tomorrow. How did you know? Did Sherlock tell you?” I demand the last as I look to him. He is the same mixture of stunned and pleased as I am.
“I’ll send him a note with his invite. What time should we set the ceremony? I never gave it a thought John.” As Sherlock opens the door to our flat.
“Of course John.” Sherlock cuts the motor, removes the keys and pockets them upon exiting the vehicle out of habit. He grabs Rosie’s nappy bag and walks around to take her from me so I can exit. Kevin has already jumped out the back and pacing around looking at the ground.
I am pissed “Oi! What the bloody hell Kevin?” I stalk over to Sherlock unceremoniously shoving Rosie at him.
“Ah, good.” Something just dawned on me as I’m sitting there. “I’m getting married in two days… I am in need of a Best Man.”
I look at Sherlock, he gives a subtle shake ‘no’ of his head. I reply “Nothing’s up Greg, we’re perfectly fine.”
“You heard me, you know I don’t like to repeat myself. Will you marry me John? I love you. I don’t want you to date anyone else. I want you to stay, I don’t want anyone to take you away from me ever again.”
“Thanks Mike, I’ll see if my brother can arrange something for here.” Following the man out to the kitchen and down to the front door.
“Musgrave Manor, yes, we still own the property. Or my parents still own the property. Mycroft was considering renovating it before Sherrinford… not sure about now.”
“Okay, okay.” Snuffle, “Guess we’re both a mess.” Sniffle, “How about, if you ever have to leave again we arrange a nice fake murder-suicide? No one would question me shooting you and then myself in remorse.” Teased.
When we get to the restaurant, Mycroft has a small stack of papers for us to sign as well as new sets of identification and passports. Medical power of attorney for both of us. One giving me executive power over Sherlock’s trust fund. There is a property in France as well, from Sherlock’s Grand’Mere. The place in Sussex was listed in our unmarried names; now updated.
I raise my glass, glance at Sherlock and state while looking him in the eyes “Sherlock has asked me to marry him and I said yes.” There are congratulations all around. “Not finished yet” I laugh. I look away and back “I asked Sherlock if he would like to adopt Rosie and he agreed.” Stunned silence for a breath, as I turn to see everyone’s reactions they all exclaim their joy at once. I hear excellent, congratulations and how wonderful.
Squaring his shoulders, standing tall and picking up a hanger on which a dove grey tuxedo is carefully hung.
Through the last of the renovations we are all sharing Sherlock’s room on the first floor. Fortunately Rosie is still in her small cot. Unfortunately we have no privacy. Even with the crowded sleeping arrangements I have been getting through the nights without nightmares, Sherlock looks better rested as well.
I soothe his back again, tossing the flannel in the sink. I follow his thought, “Mrs. Hudson has been sharing pastries every morning. Said she won a prize at some bakery, free pastries for a month… most have been almond flavoured. Shit!” I look toward the door, “We’ll have to check her as well.”
Cradling my left arm with the right, “I lost myself in the moment and moved my left arm” I grit back through my teeth in pain. “Let’s just finish up in here so I can get back into the brace and take more anti-inflammatories.”
I gently massage Sherlock’s neck, shoulders, and arms down to his fingertips. I turn off the light and pull the covers over the both of our cooling, sweaty bodies. When I hear his gentle snoring I stop stroking and gently hold him against me as I fall asleep.
Mycroft is at my side and quietly says “I can get her into a rehabilitation facility tonight if she is willing to go.”
Sherlock points toward the hall. “Go” he orders. When I still don’t move he adds, softer, pleading, “Go, I’ll give you a massage then you will take a hot shower while I order dinner. Next we can watch crap telly while we eat, go to bed early and wake up late.”
Sherlock laughs, then sobers up when he realized they were serious “Recheck your facts! The timeline from fire to fire is enough for a vehicle to travel from location to location. The Cal Fire map clearly shows that much information. There is no way that many wires could have been faulty on the same day in so many locations following that timeline. You are looking for an individual, possibly two. Check the CCTV footage, look for a vehicle that keeps showing up; that will be your arsonist.“ Rattled off, practically in one breath.
“Yeah, it is nice here. That is the Garcia River, we’ll end up down there in a bit.” Kevin informs us.
Bunny giggles again, “A couple days later the same man, mind you, the very same man bumps into me on the tube. And yesterday I was at the shops buying groceries and there he was again, only this time he ran his trolley into mine.” She sits back, then adds indignantly, “He broke my eggs!”
Sherlock waves his right hand at John’s back, bruised right knuckles as well as the angry red welt around his left forearm and matching red marks on his wrists and ankles. “How did the injuries incur?”
“You didn’t wait for Lestrade and the Yarders to show up, you left me behind… Let’s see, a punishment is in order. What to do…hmmm?” I give him another piece of his sandwich to chew and take a sip of my tea. I then reach over and take another bite of my sandwich, a bit of the melty peanut butter and honey mixture drip out onto my lap. An idea hits me… I quirk a smile at him and take another drippy bite.
I hear the snick of the tube of lube opening. Shortly, I can feel one of Sherlock’s fingers circling my hole. He gently inserts a fingertip in, I can’t help but tense at first. I force myself to relax as he pulls out and back in again, going a bit deeper. He thrusts his finger in again and again. “Sherlock please, another” I beg of him after a few minutes.
“Don’t be absurd John, it would wreak havoc with your back and shoulder. You will share with me, my bed is more than big enough for two. I made room in the wardrobe and space for another breakfront.” Sherlock waves his hand down the hall to his bedroom.
“I just changed her and put her down for her morning nap, Mrs. Hudson is on her way up to stay with her. Will you come?” the please is silent, but John heard it anyways.
“Yeah, heard it from her own lips after she shot Sherlock. Not sure who I married… if I was actually really married to her at all what with the alias. I think her real name was Rosamond Mary, but I’m not positive. Sherlock read the memory stick, he would know.”
He comes hard with my name on his lips. I follow a couple of thrusts later with his name on mine. When I can breathe again, I slowly pull out and throw the condom in the bin. I hold him while caressing his back, waiting while our heartbeats slow down to a more normal pace. I grab the blanket and pull it up over us, I’m falling asleep. He starts to move “Where are you going?” I ask sleepily.
I’m wide awake in an instant. “Is that really relevant Sherlock? I anticipate on you being the last… “
The kettle was filled and boiled. A pot of tea and slices of banana bread were on the dining table along with three tumblers and a bottle of whiskey. Three men, one with a slightly sore coccyx, are sipping tea, ignoring the food and eyeing the liquor.
“What’s so special about this one then?” John asks. Sherlock seems to be ignoring them while looking at slides on his microscope in the kitchen.
Sherlock reads the note one more time before replying “Everything is fine.” Smiling, he folds up the note, puts it back into the envelope and secures into an inner pocket. He pulls out his phone while following Greg into the building. He sends a quick text to John:
Sherlock hands Rosie over to Greg, “You want tea or coffee?” grabbing the empty plates to leave them in the sink.
“Yes, we should add Lestrade to dinner as well. He should find out through us rather than other channels.”
“Yeah. We did bring down a couple of pheasants on patrol in Afghanistan once. He was a pretty good shot and cook from what I remember.” I smile at Sherlock.
Kevin waves behind him at Sherlock and me standing next to the Jeep. “These are John and Sherlock, they’ll be watching the dogs and keeping an eye on the place while I’m gone next month. They met Kyle and Joan earlier.”
“I hear nothing from him when you are on ‘hiatus’, he tells me nothing of the assassin I start dating and end up marrying. But, when I’m finally, truly happy, the fat arse warns me away from you!”
“Hmmm, it’s warmer already. Where did you learn to do that John?” Sherlock leans against his chair sipping his perfect cup of tea.
“Kevin sent the promised pictures, more than I expected. Let me start over again.” I bring up the picture of the front of the place showing a door, three windows and an American flag caught mid flutter.
Mrs. Hudson places a pot of tea on the table then watches them eat for a couple minutes before she makes her leave, letting both men know if they need anything, she’ll be just downstairs.
Nodding with a fond smile, “Yes, Alton Brown, I’m impressed you remembered. Thought you had deleted the whole ordeal.”
He whispers back “Later Doctor Watson, we have an audience” then brings our lips together again. I can’t help but deepen the kiss running my fingers through his hair. I feel like a hormonal teen again!
Sherlock hugs me from behind, hands over my stomach. “I’ll support you any way you need. I know of a few decent rehab places if you think it will help” he whispers in my ear.
“You’d be a fool not to take it John. It’s closer to home than the clinic you’re at now. Better hours, pay and day-care! Just think about it John.” Mike practically begs.
“I had already re-written my memories of Euros by this time but I have been unable, or subconsciously disinclined, to make close friends with anyone else until you. Mummy and Father never mentioned Euros where I could hear them, and no photos survived from before she set the house on fire.”
John and Sherlock smile at one another. Sherlock then heads up the stairs as John goes out to the lorry for a load.
Greg, glancing around, lowers his voice “Drugs. Sherlock hasn’t been out of rehab for all that long…”
When Rosie is clean and dressed, and we’re once again presentable, we find Kevin in the great room with a topographic map open on the table. There is a dark line hand drawn winding through it and a red line in a large rough circle. A few marks (X) are where I recognize buildings. “I’m going to leave this for you. There is a mistake and no matter how many times the Forestry guys are told, they still print the error.” He points at a mountain on the map and out the window. “This is the hill just here, Buck Peak, we’re at the base. Do you see anything wrong?” He asks both Sherlock and I.
My daughter, with a LOT of help from Sherlock, surprised me with breakfast in bed this morning. Rosie then insisted (via Sherlock) we had to spend the day at the zoo. I did, thankfully, prearrange to have a dinner delivered from our favourite Italian eatery, Angelo’s. We whipped up a quick salad, had a lovely dinner of mushroom ravioli and a risotto Sherlock prefers. Ended up having dinner and a movie, can’t believe Sherlock had never seen The Princess Bride before. Sherlock even said we’ll have to watch it again when Rosie is older and can appreciate it better (she fell asleep in the fire swamp!).
My least favourite song this time of year is the 12 Days of Christmas. I had to sing it in choir for a number of years. Add to that shrill, out of key voices and it is my hell on earth (shudder).
I finish up my statement, sign the bottom and hand it over to Greg. “Thanks John.” He glances down at the form. “Damn your writing sucks even worse than normal and that’s saying something!”
“Good boy. When you’re finished come up to the bedroom, I’ll need help to shower and get ready for bed.”
About a week after the jumper arrived from Ireland, John had yet another nightmare of Sherlock jumping off the roof of Bart’s. After waking, he recalled Sherlock’s words, ‘it’s only a trick’. He spent the rest of the night sitting on the stairs in his dressing gown staring at the table of gifts deep in thought until long after the sun came up.
Sherlock makes sure all our ear protectors are in place, takes a stance, aims and pulls one trigger. The shot hits true, pellets striking around the middle of the target. He breathes a couple times then pulls the other trigger, pellets striking middle again. Pleased with himself he opens the breach, removes the spent shells, handing the empty shotgun back to Kevin.
Sherlock goes over the info Kevin shared, opens and loads the shotgun. With the safety on, barrel pointed at the ground, asks “Which target do you want me to fire at?”
Mrs. Hudson is free and assures them she is able to stay with Rosie as long as John and Sherlock need her to. She has Molly’s number along with theirs in case an emergency.
Sherlock can read me like a book some days. “Relax John, how about the Jubilee Gates in Regents Park? The weather is supposed to be nice this week and it’s a quick stroll to Angelo’s. We can always email or text out invitations. Angelo has a cake his grandmother used to make for special occasions. He rarely makes it but it is delicious.” Pulling out his phone, “Do you think Molly could be a best man, she is a woman after all?”
“Brace the cuff while I buckle it.” I secure the left “again” then the right. “Face down on the bed, arms over your head” I command. Sherlock launches himself onto the bed to get into position. I can’t help but laugh out loud.
Sherlock squeezes my hand in his “Yep” popping the ‘p’. “Euros and I, we played it yesterday. It was the only thing she would play. Mycroft had a copy of the recording made for the ceremony, in a way she was here.”
Mycroft rises, moving away from the chair he was sitting in, when the bathroom door opens a few minutes later. “Gentlemen” a knowing smirk on his face.
Lestrade’s foot bumps a plastic bucket bedside when he steps back. “Oh. Sorry.” Lowering his voice. “Can I get you anything until Sherlock gets back?”
“You don’t have to apologize for taking care of Rosie, Sherlock. Since you are feeding her, what would you like?” I respond as I prepare us each a cup of tea.
“Yeah, you’re right, that and an ice pack will do me some good. We can write up our lists as well.” He pays for lunch, leaving a generous tip for the waitress. We slowly wander toward the Clarence Gate to get to back home.
He sluggishly nods. Sherlock’s pupils are so blown his eyes are practically black. “Good boy. Hold still now.” I lean down with my right hand on his hip to help hold him still. I lick the underside of his cock from root to tip sucking in the tip when I reach it. I curl my tongue around the tip of his cock, slipping the tip into his slit. Finally he moans. I take him deeper into my mouth, bobbing up and down as I take more and more with each decent.
“John, I can help you but you are in no shape to do so on your own.” The nurse looks at me strangely I tell her “Get a sample jar, he would rather pee in a cup than have the catheter. I can assist him if need be.”
Grinning, John turns to Rosie, “What say we put a face on our snowman while Papa looks for suitable arms?”
“Janice told Rosie that Santa does not exist.” Sherlock blurts out then looks confused while adding, “I don’t understand why she’s so upset, Janice is correct.”
Sherlock blinks several times processing what John said. “I. I think so. So I am in fact…” he stalls.
Taking a deep breath, looking Sherlock in the eyes, “I know how easily you get bored love, you’ve been cooped up with me for over two weeks. I’m tired of not being able to do much of anything myself, you must bored to tears by now!” Putting the half empty cup on the nightstand to take Sherlock’s hand in his. “I wasn’t sending you away from me because I don’t want you with me. I was sending you away for your mental health, to use your exceptional brain. I was hoping you would come back home with a few cold cases or an experiment to run.”
Sitting back in his chair and raising his eyebrows in epiphany. “Oh. I, um, forgot. What would you like? There is fish, lamb, beef and chicken…”
The eyes of the blond winged man are the deepest blue Sherlock has ever seen. He is mesmerized by their colour for a moment until the winged man groans in pain.
Grinning, John replies, “You’ll have to be a bit more specific Greg. That sort of thing happens more than you’d think while running around with Sherlock.”
“Morning gents! Missy and I were just finishing up breakfast. She insisted upon banana pancakes with sausages this morning.” Smiling, still bouncing Rosie.
They waste no time checking John out as I start filling out his paperwork. I’ve texted Mycroft as to our locale and situation so far. Just as I finish filling out the form the fax machine behind the nurses’ station comes to life. The Nurse looks at the pages and asks “Who is Doctor John H Watson-Holmes? Is he new?” to the room in general.
Mrs. H picked orchids for boutonnieres with sprigs of maidenhair fern, they are quite lovely. She even has matching corsages for Rosie and Molly. She and Molly volunteered, since Molly couldn’t handle dressing Sherlock, to get Rosie ready for the wedding. I brought a freshly bathed Rosie along with her dress and hair clips to her flat.
“John we should pick up new clothes for Rosie as well.” We wander to the children’s department and pick her up an assortment of overalls, jumpers and warm shirts. Sherlock selects a few nicer outfits for Rosie to wear in New York and San Francisco. I’m thankful we brought the pram and threw in the harness, we have amassed quite a haul!
Unknown to the granddaughter, our client went through the house after her uncle died with a video camera and recorded everything in and around the house. The missing items were listed as being stolen, it is a long list so far consisting of art, jewelry, furniture and two sedans.
Doctor Jacobs enters the room shortly after Anthea leaves, sees the lights are off, he keeps them that way, leaving the door ajar. Glancing around the room he quietly greets Mycroft as he rises to shake hands. “You must know some important people to get me to come here…” he glances at the men intertwined on the bed. “Which one is the patient?” whispered.
“John! We need to leave for Heathrow in less than two hours, what are you doing?” Sherlock, rocking a drowsy Rosie on his hip.
“Well, you’ve just missed pigeon and deer seasons. It’s always hog and jack rabbit season in California. Quail season runs from tomorrow until the last weekend in January. I’ll double check, I think it might be grouse season, they are few and far between though.” Kevin ducks a branch. “Have to get Sean and Kyle out to brush roads again, I give them a discount on their rent if they help me keep this place up. Let’s see, turkey season is split between spring and fall hunts. In spring you can only shoot the roosters, in the fall you can shoot either sex.
First thing out of Mycroft when the speaker is on is “Greetings Doctor Watson”. John dislikes that greeting, it usually means trouble.
Giving me a glance, seeing my nod, Kevin grabs a rifle from the rack “These are both Remington 270, bolt action riffles. These will hold up to five shells, but I rarely put in more than three.” He pulls back the bolt, grabs three shells. “You load it through the firing chamber, you could also just load them singly.” He walks us through loading, safety on/off and unloading. He starts to hand me the riffle, I shake my head in negation.
While Sherlock started to make the sauce for dinner, I used some of the apples we picked while walking the dogs yesterday to make a pie for dessert. Rosie is babbling away while crawling and stumbling around being followed by the dogs who keep bringing her a ball to toss for them. We’ve been letting the dogs spend more time in the house with us since the incident with Kidde. Jagger has even allowed Rosie to use him as a walker to take a few steps while gripping his fluffy coat, adjusting his speed to match hers. I’ve been impressed with their patients while keeping an eye on their interactions. I’m not sure who’s going to miss who the most when we have to head back to London.
Mike Stamford checks in a little before 1pm. He stops, taking in the spectacle, after he opens the door, “Now that is a sight.” He lowly chuckles. “I was just heading out to lunch, wanted to see if you two needed me to bring you back anything, the stuff they serve here is inedible. I was feeling nostalgic and was headed to the coffee shop around the corner John used to work at when we were at school.” He informs Sherlock in a soft voice.
Sherlock shows me the texts “Mycroft will have everything ready by tomorrow most likely if not sooner.”
“Need more incentive Doctor Watson? Doctor Stamford told me you have a child, we offer subsidized 24-hour child care, available 7-days a week. I would really like to lock you down before you’re discharged. Since it will be several months before the position is open, I have been approved to offer you a retainer.” Doctor Murray offers.
Sherlock gives her a warm smile “Smells wonderful Hudders. John, Rosie and I are taking a holiday in the States.”
Considering their violent history, they weren’t too hard to apprehend. Not that they didn’t put up a fight, mind. I think they were happy to finally be caught for the notoriety. So far they have confessed to every case Sherlock has linked them to. They won’t admit to any other victims though. NSY has a task force going through the rest of the unsolved cases for the past few years looking for similarities.
I’m shaking my head no again when Sherlock answers “I can if needs be. I’m a little rusty with a stick but I can manage.”
I square my shoulders “I can shoot just as well as you remember. My firearm instructor insisted on learning right handed as most guns are engineered that way.” Kevin looks at me with a furrowed brow.
I laugh back “Yeah, should be a blast!” Sherlock scowls. Rosie giggles and swats a hand at Sherlock’s face.
It was getting late when we got back to Boonville so we stopped for burgers, chips and milkshakes at the Redwood Drive In. We were going to stop in at the Hanes Fine Art Gallery but they were closed until the weekend, what we saw through the windows was enough for us to want to come back.
I unwrap the wet towel and toss it to the foot of the bed and take another bite of my sandwich. “I am in too much pain to do anything tonight and I am still upset on how you left me behind earlier.”
Mike chuckles, watching, as Sherlock gently shakes John again, “John, we have food. You haven’t eaten much in the past five days. You can go back to sleep once you’ve eaten something.”
There is another road forking off not far below, there are a few pillars in a pile. “There used to be two cabins down there. The closer is one of the first I took apart, I left the pillars, and figure not much will harm the cement. I may pick them up eventually and pile them up outside the storage garage.”
John looking Sherlock in the eyes, “It was a one-off. Whatever I felt for him is vastly eclipsed by what I feel for you Sherlock. Never doubt that love.”
I give a small nod, “Yeah. We were on patrols, almost in tandem. The US and Canadian units were to the west of our position, they were under fire. My unit was able to take out a few insurgents from our position. When the firing died down we worked our way over to offer further support and transport the wounded as they had lost a couple vehicles.
Sighing, “Fine. Fine, we can get it all. Mind, you don’t need to get me anything for the next five Christmases after all of this.” John waves to the pile on the counter. Two three piece suits, pants, socks as well as several denim jeans. Two leather belts, one in black the other a polished brown. In addition a few button down and polo shirts and jumpers in colours Sherlock insisted brought out the colour of John’s eyes topped the stack.
From the bench Sherlock replies “I’m right handed, I’ll start with the right.” He takes a breath, glances at Rosie and me, checking we’re still wearing our ear protection. “Ready?”
These days, one had to carry identification with you to prove you were free, especially after dark. The new curfew laws were meant to discourage the widespread crime still running rampant in the British Empire. Slaves were required to do all of the errands for their owners between the hours of sunrise through sunset.
We play with Rosie for an hour then take turns in the shower, someone needs to keep an eye on her. I start to place some of our shopping in the shipping boxes wondering how far I can push Mycroft before he breaks. I really don’t want to haul the boxes off to ship. I’ll think more about it tomorrow. While Sherlock is out of the room, I add several sterile sets of sealed test tubes and specimen containers to the boxes. When Sherlock is finished in the loo, it’s my turn.
The morning of September 28th finds me making tea in the morning. I picked a variety I wanted to try in the shop yesterday on Pier 39. We eat a couple of the day old pastries for breakfast, they are still delicious. Sherlock opens the bag of complimentary Ghirardelli chocolates, they go well with the chocolate croissants. We’ll be driving north and meeting up with Kevin later this morning.
“Regular ray of sunshine that one is. I see her bedside manner hasn’t improved.” John pipes up from the bed.
“I know you do John and you do contribute more than you know. You can pay for dinner tonight.” as he hands his card over to Stephon.
The door the first floor flat is unlocked, he can’t believe his luck! The room looks almost like it did the last time he was in here, well lived in with a faint hint of tobacco and an underlying chemical smell. He stops to quickly glance at a file left open on the kitchen table from the dim light left on over the hob. The photo shows a blond, blue eyed white male with a sordid past as a thief. A well-used, leather limited choke slave collar is next to the file on top of a closed laptop computer.
“Thanks” I yell over my shoulder as I hastily drive us away. The British Government can get me out of a speeding ticket if needs be! I go as fast as I can drive which is not very on these winding narrow roads. John is still muttering as I pull into the hospital thirty-five agonizing minutes later. I leave both he and Rosie in the car as I run in and loudly demand help. Two orderlies follow me with a rolling bed and help get John inside as I grab Rosie and her bag.
“Do you know you’re out after curfew? I’ll need to see your identification.” Orders the young, white male uniformed officer with sandy brown hair, who disembarked from the driver side asks clicking on his torch. He shines the light in the mans face.
Greg smiles dropping a large paper bag on an empty kitchen chair, “Ah, I see Sherlock cooked you some breakfast, good. I tracked down some of your belongings at the MET. I found a phone, socks, shoes, belt, denims, and a shirt. Someone must have made off with your keys and jacket, sorry.”
Fort Bragg was interesting. We stopped at the Mendocino Coast Botanical Garden and Van Damme State Park on the way. I didn’t pack a picnic lunch today, figuring we could eat somewhere in town. Wandering downtown we found a bakery that had bread that smelled so good Sherlock went in and bought a loaf. We ended up breaking apart pieces of the ciabatta loaf and eating most of it while wandering across the Pudding Creek Trestle. In the end we went back and purchased another loaf to take back to the ranch with us. For a late lunch we stopped at Piaci Pub & Grill for pizza, I wasn’t going to order a beer but couldn’t resist trying ‘Kilt Lifter’, Sherlock tried a sip and pronounced it decent. After lunch we went shopping for supplies at Safeway.
Nodding lawyer Daggett asks, “Last question Dr. Watson. Were you awarded any medals while in the RAMC?”
“We should find someone for Lestrade, he needs someone to take care of him” Sherlock hastily changes the subject.
Once again, he is stripped and searched. He is put on a conveyer belt through a shower of what smells like insecticide and soap then a rinse in cold water. Dripping wet his is shoved into a cement six by six-foot cell with a bench on the far wall and a rusty drain in the floor. There is a dented metal toilet in the corner with a spigot dripping water into the bowl below. He hears a gurgle of the drain as he rights himself before hitting the back wall.
“Oh yeah, that’s much better!” voice still raised in anger. Takes a calming breath before continuing in a normal tone of voice. “Why can’t I just go back to my old bedsit? I need to reassess my life.”
We spent an extra day in Sussex after catching Victoria Parker’s former lover and business partner Dominic Price nicking ducks. Molly and Mrs. Hudson were minding Rosie and agreed it would be alright if we delayed our return by a day, we hadn’t figured on finishing up so fast so they were prepared and looking forward to a ‘girls night’.
“SHERLOCK!! It’s 2am! Quit torturing your violin and go to bed, you must be exhausted. You haven’t slept for days, you need to rest.”
“Rosie wanted a plush chair for her room, we can move the one by the sofa up and put the desk chair in its place.”
Greg pours a cup of tea for himself from the pot on the table while answering, “Yeah. The box I tracked down containing Dr. Watson’s personal effects had several layers to it. At the bottom was information on an escaped slave, John Doe 6-5-1854, he was owned by” Pulls out a notebook and flips a couple pages, “a Charles A Crawley. The original identification was for a six-foot two-inch, blond man with blue eyes. He was a deserter from the Army, picked up trying to re-enter the country illegally. I made copies and sent them off to Mycroft, the box is now locked in my office at the Yard with another I found.”
“Harriet did say it was payback for all the hell you put her through when she dropped it off with Rosie’s present.” Sherlock smirks.
Later, I end up on one end of the couch reading an old mystery as Sherlock taps away on his laptop stretched out on the other end, his feet in my lap. I’m absently massaging one foot at a time. After reading part of a chapter I notice it’s extremely quiet in the flat and look up. Sherlock is staring intently at me, I lick my lips and smile.
“Andy had a girlfriend” he states when he lets me go, gently placing Rosie on the floor again before I accidently drop her.
“It’s the 15th, we’ll need at least three days in New York then a day to fly to San Francisco… I’ve booked us to fly out on the 22nd. I assume your friend Kevin will want to make sure we arrive before he leaves?”
“I stopped dating after Jeanette left. She told me I was a great boyfriend, to you, even though we were not a couple. I realized she was right. It wasn’t fair to any of the women I dated, they were always second best to you. I gave up everything to spend time with you; I was never bored.
John kisses then nips Sherlock’s earlobe before murmuring, “We’ll just have to be quiet then won’t we?”
He was frustrated at only reading ‘I’m fine’ as a text from his best friend. If they were even still friends. Did Sherlock even want him around anymore? John has been feeling rather lonely and confused of late.
Everything that belongs to Rosie, even outfits she’s outgrown are packed. The crib parts are wrapped in spare blankets to keep the pieces from rubbing. They have a small debate over Mary’s belongings, in the end they take her jewelry to give to Rosie when she’s older. They leave Mary’s clothes and any furniture not needed behind to dispose of later. They did however, take all the rugs, towels and blankets.
Pot of tea? Check. Biscuits? Check. Comfortable, relaxed roommate/lover on the couch? Check. Rosie being taken care of by Mrs. Hudson so there are no distractions? Double check. Sherlock’s curiosity is getting the better of him. “John, can I ask… I hardly know anything about your childhood.”
I go through the motions and take my first shot using my dominant, left side. The recoil causes a spasm to lance through my scar. When the miasma of pain subsides, I spot that I did manage to hit the middle of the target. Sherlock had handed Rosie to Kevin and he was at my side with a hand out, not quite touching, a look of concern on his face.
“Yeah, it was nice considering the circumstances. Angelo sent over a lovely supper when he found out you were hurt. We spent most of the day watching a Dr. Who marathon if I’m not mistaken.”
I make a fist with my left hand on the table and release it a couple times, “Yeah. The ring and pinkie finger are a bit numb and there is a tingling in the palm unless I make a loose fist. More irritating than anything else, I can ignore it most of the time. Bit lucky, it could have been a lot worse.”
“Is it even mine? She’s lied about everything else! Who knows who all she’s been fucking all over London!”
“It was cold in here the last time, even with a fire going. Does Molly have power? If so she should keep Rosie until we get power and heat again.”
Greg realizes where he is and what he is witnessing as Sherlock moans out John’s name as he brings himself to climax.
“Oh? How can I help, need me to babysit this little one?” She hugs Rosie to her and rocks her back and forth.
“John? Sherlock? You guys here? Decent?” Greg calls out before wandering down the hall to the bedroom; the door to the flat was unlocked. From the open doorway he spots John lying curled up on his side in bed, facing the darkened hall. The drapes are drawn, lights are off and John seems to be hugging his head and breathing rather oddly. “John mate, you alright?”
The sheriff’s demeanour is so similar to Lestrade that John is finally able to relax a bit. “If we find any plots, you will be the first person we notify.”
We can’t seem to get away from crime even in the middle of nowhere! We somehow caught the attention of a serial killer who targets same sex families. Andrew Kidde found us in Fort Bragg when we went shopping and followed us back to the ranch. Sherlock’s brother, the British Government, was able to find out and warn us as the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted an Interpol search on his intended victims, us!
John rubs his now throbbing temple, “So that’s it? I forget to text and we’re through?” Stepping closer, “How many times in the past did you ignore my texts and calls on purpose? How many times was I left to worry about you? My lapse was accidental. I lost track of the time while talking about how much I love you!” Voice breaking, while waving a hand to the ladies behind him.
Surprised, John looks at Sherlock who won’t meet his gaze. Leaning back, John takes Sherlock’s face in his hands. “Look at me Sherlock.”
Voice low, “When your friend wakes, have him help you have a wash; keep the stitches dry. You’ll feel better, use the call button and have them change the linens.” Patting John on the arm. “I’ll go see about scheduling that MRI.” Looks at Mycroft, “I’ll check back when all is set up.” Doctor Jacobs leaves, closing the door behind him.
The dark-skinned female officer interrupts holding up a hand, “Likely story. Odds are you have a secret escape route up there or something. Trying to pull a fast one on us?” she angrily accuses.
I’m able to remove my jeans and pants one-handed. I do need some help with my sling and shirts, especially for the next few days. Sherlock steps up without asking, after yesterday, I’m thinking he’s extra eager to please me. “Did you have any trouble finding the key?” as I reach for my toothbrush.
“I’ll leave Sherlock to explain, I’ll pop back up in a bit with tea and biscuits.” Mrs. Hudson leaves.
“Any questions so far?” I shake my head no. Sherlock gives a negative, he is filing the information away. ‘Okay, good. Do either of you drive a stick?” Kevin asks.
I run my hand up to turn his head, I need to kiss that lovely mouth. We snog until we are both breathless. “We’ve saved each other. Can we sleep now love?”
Sherlock looks like a hungry, lost puppy someone just yelled at and then tried to kick. John sighs, Sherlock hardly ever begs for anything. “Fine.” Waving a hand toward a vestibule.
Sherlock drove them all in the rental SUV, neither he nor John wanted to reset the baby seat for Rosie. The seat was difficult to say the least to secure in the first place, they had no intention of removing it until they returned the vehicle. John sat in the back with Violet and Rosie, leaving the passenger seat for Siger. Violet seemed ecstatic to have a baby to fuss over and was taking full advantage of the situation.
“Ta, did…” muttered, both eyes opened then John quickly blinks them shut, frowning, pressing his lips firmly closed.
Greg knocks on the door promptly at noon. Mrs Hudson lets him in and follows him up the stairs. I hear her “Woo, hoo” as they come through the open door to the flat.
“I’m at my wits end Mr. Holmes. All I want is contact with my aunt again, the only thing I have ever wanted from her is time together.”
“Good. If you follow the black pipe up the hill about ten yards, that’s where the filter is buried under the gravel in the flow of the spring. The blue tank is to collect any silt so as not to clog the main tank. Do you see it?”
“Boring. So where is this house with the dog?” he’s still reclined, head turned to look intently at me.
Her eyes flick to his cold orbs then back to the floor, “Mmmm… Moriarty demanded to handle the situation himself sir.” She stammers. “Cooper just sent over the file…”
Sherlock observes John a moment, “Of course. Sit. I’ll prepare you a plate. Tea?” Turning off the overhead lights in the kitchen, leaving on the light over the sink.
I’ve curled around Sherlock’s side, left arm over his stomach, legs entangled. I’m happy, sated and on the edge of sleep.
“I have to check in at base by 1700 hours, should only take about three hours but I’ll leave around noon in case of traffic.” Kevin announces as he places plates full of waffles and homemade wild pork sausage on the table.
“Food smells good. I haven’t had time to stop since breakfast.” Greg’s stomach growls loud enough to hear across the room.
“We missed you too. She wouldn’t eat the first day, refused everything, even biscuits until you skyped.”
Sherlock looks up from his microscope at the kitchen table, “For you John, never. What can I do for you? Where’s Watson?” Sherlock is wearing a white button down shirt and dark grey colored slacks covered loosely by his tan dressing gown.
When we finish our appetizers the waiter clears the dishes. He brings an extra bread plate and places it between us “For the little one.” He says as he heads back to the kitchen.
I snarl back at her “Let see. First off I was shot and tortured in Afghanistan then invalided home. But why would you care? You barely noticed me except to blame me for all your troubles the two weeks I lived with you before I moved to an awful bedsit. You were nowhere to be found when my best friend jumped off of a building and killed himself in front of me. I realized I was in love with him after it was too late.” I glance down at Sherlock and squeeze his shoulder again. “The woman I married turned out to be an assassin who tried her best to kill my friend after he managed to come back from the dead. My lying assassin wife had a baby, you haven’t seen since she was born. Your niece Rosie whom you’ve never even bothered with.” Molly is holding Rosie on her hip to soothe her. “My assassin of a wife was shot and then died in front of me. My best friend then tried to overdose on drugs then I beat the crap out of him before a serial killer tried to murder him - again. And after all of this my best friend’s crazy sister tried to have him kill me and when he declined she chained me to the bottom of a bloody well and tried to fucking drown me. All through this and beyond, since I came back from the war, you have been absent. Why did you give me your old phone if you were never going to answer when I called you? Fucking hell Harry! Whatever problems could I have?”
The nurse behind the desk picks up the papers and pales. She hastily brings them over to Dr Angele and shoves them under his nose. The reply on his lips dies unmentioned as he in turn pales. I can’t help but wonder what Mycroft threated him with as I discretely wave at the camera in thanks.
Sherlock just about jumps into the spray of water in the shower, reaching down to remove the cock cage at the same time. I follow, giggling, at a more leisurely pace, being mindful of my left shoulder. Sherlock reaches for the shampoo as I close the curtain and step under the spray. He starts to wash my hair before I can even ask; the massage feels like heaven. Sherlock gently moves me under the spray to rinse then massages in conditioner then rinse again. He wets a clean flannel and adds body wash and starts to clean me gently all over. I am enjoying the sensation immensely as Sherlock can tell when my hard cock brushes against his thigh. Sherlock positions me under the spray again as he starts to lather himself, slowly, erotically.
“They didn’t ask for finished biscuits, only frozen dough ready to pop in the oven. I didn’t think you would be interested… I’m sorry, I should have asked to see if you wanted to help. We can make up more after a trip to the shops for more butter and raisins.”
“You’ll have to devise a way to keep Rosie from him when he’s sleeping, I’d hate to see him hurt her accidently.” Lestrade reluctantly adds.
“Hmm? Oh, no. I have 4 hives in there, only 3 have bees in them though. Black bears roam through on occasion, need to protect the hives from Yogi and Boo Boo.”
Kevin nods “I’ll be up at the office then, need to grab a few things up there before the trip. Do either of you need anything before I go?” We both answer we’re fine just before he drives up the hill.
Sherlock stops at an opening, down below us to the west is a riverbed. “It’s quite beautiful here, I’m glad we came.” Sherlock is gently massaging my left shoulder while looking.
Saturday morning during breakfast Violet suggests they pack a basket for a picnic lunch, since the sun was shining. They should head over to the pond they used to spend time at when the children were young. John left it up to Sherlock to agree or not.
John comes to, feeling dizzy, shoulders stiff, and very cold with a pounding headache. Trying to take the stiffness out of his shoulders he discovers his hands are tied behind his back. Looking across the room at the dim figure in the shadows “You’ve made a huge mistake.” He growls.
“Yes, but when they question my aunt she says everything is fine. They’ve been there at least three times that I know of for wellness checks. The bank called after Kim had her hissy fit. I showed the police this picture and I have since found out one of the neighbors called when he heard Kim screaming abuse at my aunt.”
Kevin waves us back to the first garage “Good. Sherlock you can drive. The jeep in this shed is easier to handle, newer than the white one. John and Rosie can take the passenger seat I’ll stand in the back. I took out the backseats on both.” Sherlock and I must both have looks of confusion “With just Diana and I, we only needed the two seats and we could haul more firewood without the seats. They are stored in the attic. I can pull the one for this jeep down and put it back in if you want to use the baby seat.” Kevin waves toward the house.
Sherlock answers, nose still in the folder, “John has a slight fever. Stamford already prescribed antibiotics, John had a shot about two hours ago.”
“So you did move back to Baker Street then?” Greg asks John, who had reclined next to Sherlock on the bed after they’d finished eating.
John grinning back, “Yeah, me too. I didn’t wake until Sherlock woke me to eat lunch. To answer your question Doc I still have double vision and a headache. Head feels better laying down but I know I have to sit up as well. I’m also sleepy, which is to be expected with a concussion.”
“Hey, be nice Sherlock. I’ve had years of practice following you around. Besides, it’s almost Christmas.” John tries to calm his husband.
Sherlock picks up a picture from the counter behind him, “We settled on my parents’ home. From the front elevation it looks like a single story house. Originally we were going to recreate 221 but there are too many levels and windows. That and we didn’t know what to use for the awning over Speedy’s Café.”
Sherlock is laying on his back on the sofa, while talking on the phone, when John comes through the door to the flat, heavy bags in both hands, Rosie strapped to his chest grasping a package of cleaning wipes. Putting down the shopping John hears, “Yes Mummy, I know.” Pause. “I will check and inform you yes.” Pause. “Yes Mummy.” Pause. “I know Mummy, you already said that.” Slightly irritated, sitting up. Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Yes Mummy, I will notify you as soon as I know.” Pause. “Yes I know.” Pause. “You too.” Hangs up.
Mike comes in a bit closer, “He looks a bit flushed, I’ll have a nurse take his temperature just in case.”
Gripping John’s waist with one hand, “Thank you John.” Rising and looking around, “Now, where did I put the hat and sunglasses I packed for you?”
Nodding, “No thanks, I’ll stay here with Sherlock, keep an eye on him and guard the staff. Mrs. Hudson could use a place to stay though.”
From the kitchen Sherlock hears a simultaneous feral growl and a yelp in surprise. Running into the lounge he sees John kneeling, straddled, over a prone Lestrade with both of his hands squeezed tightly around Greg’s throat. “Fuck” Thinking quickly, Sherlock shouts out “Captain Watson!” even louder “At ease Captain!” once more, a bit more desperate “Stand down Captain, now!”
We have fitted out most of our house in Sussex through Costco. Sherlock went with me the other day to pick up nappies. We spent most the trip sitting on various couches and chairs to find the ones we both liked. We ended up finding a leather sleeper sofa with a chaise and a couple of reclining side chairs. Sherlock noted the appliances, so we picked out new ones for the kitchen as well as a washer and dryer. We’re still debating if we want a telly there or not.
“I took the liberty of having my people check all of the known aliases your wife used. They uncovered several bank accounts around the world. We have closed out each one and consolidated everything into your account.” Seeing the shocked look on John’s face, “You did ask me to take care of the townhouse and its contents while in hospital. The check is the money from the sale of the property, its contents and the vehicle.”
“Really? Maybe it was the pint bottle of whiskey you chugged last night. I left the paracetamol and a bottle of water next to the bed for you.”
Molly shrugs as Sherlock answers “Museum, though there are traces of dirt on this sample. Siberia possibly, they’re found in the permafrost.”
“Right. We won’t promise anything, but we’ll listen to what they have to say. I will not put Rosie in danger. Is that understood?” John announces. Sherlock rises to pace again.
The commotion brings in two more guards, who are more cautious after seeing their colleagues’ injuries. The guards move slowly, staying just out of reach, guiding John back toward the table behind him with beer gut guy. John feels a pinch at his neck, reaching back he feels a needle injecting him with something that is making him very groggy, extremely quickly. Just before he passes out, he feels the whip being pulled from his lax hand quickly followed by the bite of the whip again across his back and a vicious kick to his right side over his kidney.
“Tell you what, I’ll make another batch, for cinnamon rolls. We can freeze half the rolls for a future date. Want to help?” hopeful, barely breathing while talking.
Kevin chuckles “I keep finding cabins and shacks, not sure of the exact number, didn’t count. Some are hiding quite well. There are a few that still need to come down, if you want I can show you them before I leave. You can do what you want with them, I went through the places I’ve found so far and removed what goods I wanted to save.”
I wake up in the morning, very warm and unable to move. There is a Consulting Detective practically laying on top of me. It’s wonderful. I gently glide my fingers through his soft curls, trying not to wake him. He lets out a contented sigh and snuggles closer somehow. I fall back asleep for another hour when I’m awoken by hands running through my hair. It feels nice.
“Right. Ah. Ok. I see I have a lot to think about.” The box is empty at this point. “I can do some research online about BDSM. Maybe learn about tying you up so as not to injure you. Can you recommend somewhere?” I start to put the items back in the box but Sherlock takes my hand to stop me. “Yes? Is there more?”
Violet Holmes threw open the front door and rushed out to the car before John could manage to get his door open. “Darling boy, you came!” Giving Sherlock a fierce hug as he steps out of the drivers’ seat.  “How was the drive?” She adds following Sherlock to the back of the SUV.
John receives a look that would kill a lesser man “I thought that was you?” smirking, “I only want the best after all.”
Smiling fondly at his husband, Sherlock sits, touching shoulder and thigh with his husband while taking a bite of his own biscuit. “I still can’t believe our Rosie is a teacher.”
On the desk between the front windows is a strong box, Sherlock unlocks it with the key. “You can place John’s gun in here. He can retrieve it from here.”
Mike Stamford gasps, “John! Oh my god, you’ve been missing for over two weeks. What the hell happened to you?”
Greg followed the ambulance to the hospital but had to get back to the Carruthers home, aka crime scene, to supervise his staff, mumbling about them all being complete imbeciles on his way out. Greg had also assured John he would notify Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson. Before making his leave, Greg made John promise to keep him posted on Sherlock’s progress.
“Ah. Let me check his chart, then I’ll examine him. Let them sleep.” The Doctor informs Mycroft who was about to rouse Sherlock. Doctor Jacobs grabs John’s paper chart and stands next to the propped open door to read. He states, “Oh jolly good” while reading. “Finally a fellow practitioner who knows their meds.” He puts the chart down. “Let us have a look then, shall we?” Heading bed side.
Sherlock seeing John so upset, “I’ll never use again John. I promised.” Rushing over to kneel in front of John.
“Mike Stanford and his wife should be there, he introduced us after all. Bill Murray and his wife, Bill is the main reason I survived in Afghanistan after I got shot. Kevin is too far away; we can celebrate in the States with him. That’s it really for me. Harry is in rehab and should stay there to avoid temptation. Anyone else you want to invite?”
Sherlock opens another file showing a small bathroom “Shower, no tub.” He brings back the kitchen photo “The sink looks large enough to bathe Rosie in though, good.” Sherlock opens another picture of a long room with a high ceiling. There are a lot of windows and mounted animal heads, mostly deer, on the walls. A dining table with chairs a few squashy chairs, couch and a woodstove with a pile of wood next to it complete the picture. “Your friend likes to hunt? He has some impressive trophies.”
I breathe into his chest “God, what you do to me. You are so gorgeous.” I start to undo the buttons on his shirt kissing my way as I expose his pale skin.
The road back up the hill had several large pinecones at one point, Sherlock stopped. Kevin mentioned they were Sugar pine cones, pointed out a Douglas fir cone. Sherlock collected several of both varieties for an experiment, though his eyes lit up when Kevin mentioned they look ‘really neat’ while burning.
Sherlock is going to enjoy this place from just exploring the trees alone. As the thought runs through my brain he takes my hand and gives it a squeeze, entwining our fingers. We turn in unison looking at our current surroundings. Behind us are two dogs, one black and white and one brown and white ticked, quietly looking at us from their covered enclosure.
That surprised Sherlock who eagerly turns, “Really? Can I sort through the rest of your clothes then?”
“But why twice? Surely once was enough to bring him down? I don’t understand why you had to shoot him the second time Sherlock?” Greg is exasperated himself.
A slurred baritone call of “Jawwwwn! Jawn where are you?” can be heard in the hallway outside the recovery room. Sherlock’s surgeon pats John good naturedly on the back before leaving with a, “Happy Christmas Mr. Holmes.”
Sherlock starts to read, quietly to himself as Mike speaks up, “I came in to let you know we can let you go home tomorrow if there’s nothing irregular in the MRI. Someone will have to be home to monitor you though.” Glancing at Sherlock, who absently nods, grunting.
John is sitting on the couch, Sherlock had been pacing behind it since they came back from church services; refraining from complaining about his wasted time at John’s request, and anticipating Rosie’s nap. John opens the envelope and feels Sherlock’s warmth behind him, reading over his shoulder. John pulls out a rather large check and a few folded sheets of paper.
“I could use another cuppa.” I reply. I start to get up and he gestures for me to stay and picks up the pot and prepares me another cup. I take a sip “perfect, thank you love.” He beams and starts to wash dishes. This is new, I’m not going to jinx it by asking what’s up though. I play a bit with Rosie as I sip my tea. When he is done cleaning up my cup is empty and he washes it as well.
Someone high up influenced John’s care again as his surgery was done laparoscopically. The tip of the nail had stopped at a metal plate the army restored his scapula with. The surgeon was able to remove the nail, a bone chip as well as a small bullet fragment overlooked from the original war injury.
I add in “Perhaps titanium, it’s durable and should be able to resist your chemical experiments as well.”
“I’ll show you how to wash the sheets later.” John, enjoying the shocked look on his lovers face. “We have another clean set, since you’re here you can help me put them on.” Smug.
“Yeah, John didn’t want me to touch him either, said he was nauseous.” Greg adds, rocking Rosie on his hip still.
“I love you too. And if you haven’t noticed, I am dating you. I only date one person at a time and I have no plans on going anywhere without you.” I kiss the top of his head.
We drive up the hill, near one of the largest pine trees I’ve ever seen Kevin tells Sherlock to stop and turn off the motor. We disembark and stand on the edge looking down into a small ravine. “The spring starts about a hundred yards or so further up the hill. Do you see the blue barrel down there?” Kevin asks.
If you are young enough that you believe Santa Clause breaks into your home to leave presents once a year, kindly skip this chapter...
Greg mumbles, “Army Doctor, right.” Raising his voice as he turns to leave, “I’m going in to the station to pick up a fingerprint scanner and my laptop, I want to run John’s prints against the system. Something very fishy is going on here.” Calling over his shoulder on his way down the hall, “I’ll be back as soon as I can!”
John nods, winces then tells Sherlock his address and a short list of what items he’d like along with his wallet. John ends with, “I don’t know how you’ll get in though. I’m not exactly sure where my keys are at the moment.”
“How is your shoulder doing? I made tea, it’s on the counter.” Sherlock says from where he is spooning a bit of mush into Rosie’s mouth. I notice it’s the same pot as last night, he must have brought it down.
Mycroft turns to John, “I believe I will leave you for a while. I shall return with breakfast within the hour.” Closes down his laptop, leaves it on the bedside table and walks out.
I’m still a bit amazed as I reach for my phone to call Mycroft using the speaker, he picks up on the first ring. “Dr Watson what can I do for you today?” he simpers. Sherlock is rolling his eyes next to me.
“If you see a coyote or mountain lion disturbing the livestock you can shoot them as well. Do let me know if you get a lion though, officially they are an endangered species and I have to report the kill. I must have at least twenty different ones on my game cameras though.”
Putting down the axe I go join Sherlock sitting on the deck, taking the cup from his hand. “Ta love.” I kiss his cheek and take a swallow, emptying half the glass. “Guess I was thirstier than I thought.”
This is all his fault, he failed to notify the Yard where they were going while following up a clue. John is going to be so pissed at him for letting them become caught by this pair of psychopaths! As it is, Sherlock is too far away and preoccupied to help John regain his feet after Robert King kicks him. He’s not sure how they will be able to get out of this one.
Calmly “We are already at risk if what Mycroft says is true. Wouldn’t it be better to have help than deal with this psychopath on our own?”
“Alright, I just want to be sure. We’ll all be Watson-Holmes’ then. By the way, have you called your parents yet and let them know?” I run my fingers through his hair and cup his cheek, so bloody gorgeous.
I’m a bit confused. HPV can be tested for with a simple pelvic exam in women. Kevin must see the look on my face and pipes up before I can ask. “She didn’t go to the OBGYN until it was too late, it had spread. Be sure to get your little girl to have her annual physical as she grows. It wasn’t a pleasant way to go. A nice lady from hospice moved in with us toward the end to help.” Kevin closes his eyes and squares his shoulders “That’s enough of that for now. Let me help you with your luggage.” He looks in the window at Rosie sleeping in her car seat. “Or show you to your rooms so she can sleep more comfortably.”
Dressing across the bedroom Sherlock inwardly cringes, desperately thinking, trying to figure out what, if anything, he did wrong. “John?” He can’t help but become unnerved when John is pissed around him since the incident with Culverton Smith.
“Everything’s going to be alright, I’ll take good care of you. You might feel a little discomfort at first. Just try to relax now Mr. Holmes.” John changes into a clean latex gloves and picks up the tube of medical grade lubricant. Naked Sherlock, plus lube, equals sexual release to John’s body; he can’t help but feel himself grow yet harder. John swears he can feel pre-ejaculate leaking down his hardening cock.
“Let me be the judge of that.” Pulling the suit jacket to the side John notices a large bloodstain on Sherlock left side over his ribs. “You’re bleeding.” Turning his head to one of the ambulance techs, “Get me something to clean it with.”
I rise to investigate “Sherlock, are you alright?” I ask as I arrive at the door. I am so utterly surprised by what I see in front of me. “Oh god!” Sherlock is curled up on the bath rug sobbing. I drop down and pull him to my right side rubbing his back. “Shhhh. It’s okay” I soothe, “everything is fine. If this is about earlier I’m so sorry for hitting you in anger. I have no excuse.”
Fifteen minutes and a shared cold shower later find John and Sherlock sitting at their kitchen table as Mrs. Hudson fixes them and Greg eggs to order to go with the bacon. John is happily sipping on his tea, listening to Sherlock and Greg talk shop.
“I could never do a thing like that to Sherlock though, it would destroy him to think I was unfaithful.”
Sherlock looks at me and I know we’re both thinking the same thing as he states “Patrick is getting a rather nice tip tonight” as he takes my hand. We are missing the sunset out the window, we only have eyes for each another.
Missiles are whistling overhead before landing and creating havoc. Bright orange flashes, loud blasts followed by a barrage of debris. Bullets are whizzing by, occasionally hitting home with a definitive, distinctive sound. He’s being called from all directions, “Watson!”, “Medic!” over and over. Too many. Too many. There are so many wounded and he is only just one man. He can only do so much. The bodies are piling up like cord wood around him, soon he’ll be buried, unable to move.
When we arrived Donovan was manning the crime-scene-tape again. She scowled at us as we went by but for once refrained from saying anything.
“Do you remember much of Euros? It’s okay if you don’t…” Asked gently, John’s arm is still around Sherlock, giving a gentle squeeze.
“Odds are nothing will go wrong, I’ve only had one instance where the water stopped and it was my own fault for not shutting off a cabins water when I dismantled it. I accidently drained the tank. You shouldn’t have to do anything, there is another filter in the garage with the generator. Remind me when we get back and I’ll show you where it is, never had a reason to replace it yet though. Anything else? If not let us get this show on the road.” Kevin climbs back into the jeep.
John hisses as he feels a sharp pain run from the left side of his neck and down across his bare back to his right hip. He quickly turns around and grabs the whip as it descends again, wrapping it around his left forearm. He gives a massive pull while throwing a punch with his right hand at the man who just lashed him with a whip.
I lift my hips as Sherlock takes my jeans and pants off in one go, removing my socks at the same time. He gently runs his hand up my cock from root to tip then follows the path with his tongue. He licks across the slit then sucks on the tip. He takes me in his mouth as he runs his hands up my chest to tease my nipples. I can’t help but arch and moan in delight “Brilliant boy, so good!” He groans in pleasure at my praise, the vibration feels fantastic. He keeps sucking and licking my cock while one hand continues to play with my nipples in turn. His other hand he brings down to cup my balls and press my perineum. Damn he’s incredible at this!
“Peanut butter and honey on toast, can’t complain. You made sandwiches as I asked. Good boy.” I take a sip of my tea wondering if I have gone too far calling him a ‘good boy’ as though he were a dog. I notice the tension in Sherlock’s shoulders melts a little, okay, not too far, good.
I look at him in confusion, there is very little blood left in my brain, it all went south with that kiss!
“Yeah, you were hit across the head by a board. Do you remember anything?” concerned, “You have stitches, careful.” As John’s hand touches the bandage wrapped around his head.
We meet the husband in the lounge, Sherlock murmurs his deduction in my ear. “Early 40s, smoker, drinks too much, works long hours, and doesn’t sleep enough, wears women’s panties.” Sherlock smirks at me then asks Mr. Hutchins “Does your wife have any friends or relatives that come to visit when you are away?”
“You and me both John.” Snuggling closer, “We did have a nice quiet Christmas that year though… Just the three of us, you me and little Rosie. Mrs. Hudson was at her sisters, Mycroft was stuck going to my parents, Greg and Molly went to her mothers.”
We are able to drowsily stumble out to the bed, pull down the covers and crawl in for a quick nap. I fall asleep with a blissed out consulting detective wrapped tightly around me with his head on my chest.
A few minutes later Sherlock comes down the hall and flicks on the light in the bathroom. The light coming through the glass door illuminates the bedroom in a soft greenish glow. I hear Sherlock wash his hands, open and close the cupboard in the loo before coming into the bedroom, shirtless, leaving the light on behind him.
Sherlock comes out the door “Greg I need to see the files for the other robberies...” He pauses, looking at me, “John, are you still upset?”
John looks at Sherlock with both eyes, slamming them shut, then continuing, “You’ve been solving cases? From a hospital bed. While I’ve been sleeping?”
“Yeah Sherlock, it was a gift. We’re having a secret Santa exchange at the clinic. This was left on my desk this morning.”
Sherlock puts down his phone and takes the offered folder. He starts to go through the contents while John replies from his prone position. “I’ve already undergone physiotherapy through the army.”
A few more twists and turns and we end up in the river bed at a crossing. I don’t know about the other two but I could use a break to stretch my legs. “Can we stop for a few? Rosie needs changing and I could use a bit of a stretch.”
The original founders of the law thought that petty crime would slowly become non-existent over time. That however, did not happen. More and more of the populace were becoming slaves as paid workers were replaced by cheaper, or free, labour. At first private citizens, then corporations eventually took over the sale of slaves, a cut of each sale went into the Governmental coffers.
Dr. John H. Watson was examining his twelfth person of the morning, his part-time job at St. Bart’s A&E department was a much better fit than working locum shifts at the clinics he was at before. Just as he was preparing to put his stethoscope buds in his ears his cell phone rings with Sherlock’s ringtone. He answers curious, Sherlock prefers to text…
Lestrade, sitting across from Sherlock at the desk, “How do you know he had a bad night?” he asks curiously.
Still growling “You aren’t going to defend your actions? I asked that you not leave me behind or risk your life. I can’t lose you again Sherlock!” I have followed him into the kitchen. My voice starts to break “I can’t go through that again…”
“Nancy married several times, having a child with husband number two, a girl, Kim, and husband number five, a boy, Bobby. Nancy was a handful when she was younger, demanded undivided attention. Always wanted everything her way and was upset when she didn’t get what she wanted when she wanted it. We were constantly told how smart she was, even as she flunked out of secondary school. Her daughter Kim followed her example, but was forcefully expelled rather than just flunking out of school.
John slowly walks up, places his right hand on Greg’s shoulder “It’s alright Greg, no harm done. Our fault for not closing the door.”
Seeing as most of B flat is a crime scene, Sherlock and John take Mrs. Hudson up on her offer of the use of her spare bedroom downstairs for the night. Mycroft had offered the use of one of his spare rooms but Sherlock adamantly refused, insisting Mycroft had done enough damage for one night already. John was thankful as he was exhausted and it was all he could do to limp his way down the 17 stairs.
Three agents look at John, then Sherlock in confusion. Sherlock answers their unasked question “The owner of the property hunts” pointing absently, with his left hand, at the mounted animal heads on the walls around them, exasperated. “He has bags big enough to hold an elk carcass, one should hold Kidde capably. The body should be safe to store in the skinning shed.” More puzzled expressions from the three agents; John smirks tossing Burton a cloth bag. With a frustrated sigh, Sherlock adds “The screened building next to the creek.”
Sherlock adds “It has been many years since I have handled one as well.” Making a concession he adds “Why don’t you walk us through using these.” Indicating the two propped up.
John made a run to Tesco, they needed just about everything, milk, eggs, tea, coffee, sugar and so on.  He took Rosie to the store in her pram and brought her back in the chest harness; the pram full of the loaded shopping bags. This was one of the few times he would not have minded seeing Mycroft or one of his minions in a black sedan, unfortunately none showed.
I clear my throat and look him in the eyes, “First of all, I would prefer for this to be monogamous.”
“I’m fine Sherlock, just a few new scrapes.” John assures as Sherlock quickly assesses the room and its occupants.
“Just after Nancy shot herself, Kim managed to move into the house with my aunt, along with her boyfriend of seven years and their illegitimate baby girl, Maggie. Kim has convinced my aunt that this is her only grandchild, knowing her brother is married with two older children of his own; whom my aunt has spent time with.
Proud, “I am feeling quite fine thank you. There is only one problem with the two of you moving in.”
John’s muffled, “Right, right, sorry, I’ll behave. Whose pyjamas am I wearing anyway? Are these silk?”
Sherlock volunteers to attend Rosie. I do a quick search of the refrigerator, freezer and cabinets and discover I have on hand what I need to make Sherlock his favourite, pea risotto, for supper. Even better, Rosie adores it as well.
September 19th Mrs Hudson comes up with scones and tea for breakfast. She has a box under the tray with her. “Good morning boys and girl” she coos. Mrs. Hudson starts to play with Rosie who’s strapped in her highchair after I take the tray from her. “I thought you might need something else for your wedding tomorrow you may have forgotten about.” She smiles and hands me the box.
As we head upstairs “I think it’s time for lunch, then Rosie here needs her nap. Did you let Angelo know about an approximate number of people yet? He should know as he’s catering…”
John woke slowly thinking Sherlock had tied him to their bed for some reason until the smell of a strange Alpha hits his nose. He knows that scent, he hasn’t had to smell it in years though. Acrid, sour… he treated the soldier after a skirmish in Helmand. John was promoted and transferred before the Alpha fully recovered.
The nurse relaxes a bit, “Nurse Levi, you can call me Jessie. I never left the UK, I was stationed at the Northumberland Military Hospital for several years.” She grabs John’s chart, makes a notation on the last page. “Sir if you sign here I’ll remove the catheter and IV.” She points a spot for John to sign. “Order has to be given by a Doctor, they never specified if they had to work here or not.” She grins, puts on gloves and starts to remove the IV. “Where were you stationed Sir?” distracting John.
Somehow we made it through US Customs quickly, I suspect Mycroft pulled a few strings. Even better, while walking out with our luggage was a driver holding a sign with our names on it. I never asked Sherlock where we were staying in New York, apparently it’s The Plaza.
“Fantastic idea John! I’ll send him a text, remind him about your two years and Mary while I’m at it.” The smirk he is wearing is exceptionally wicked.
Through the ringing in his ears Sherlock hears John swear out “Bloody hell!” just before two police cars fill the alley with pulsing blue lights.
“I’m fine John. Why don’t we get you settled in the kitchen and I’ll clean up your arm while we wait for the police to arrive.” Blushing, she can’t help but notice John’s penis peaking from the bottom of his tan t-shirt when he stands up straight. “I should find you another dressing gown or pyjama bottoms before the police arrive too.” Nodding down to his crotch.
We have been having some fun with all my free time. I’ve been taking Rosie for a walk every day, Sherlock joins us more often than not. Between the walks and going to the gym, I believe I’ve finally gotten back in shape. Quite frankly, I never thought I’d get into this good of condition ever again after leaving the army. Between the exercise and more home cooked meals I feel healthier than I have in a long time. I know my GP at my latest physical was rather impressed with the improvements. I can’t help but notice Sherlock looks healthier as well.
Sherlock takes my hand and leads me out of her room closing the door, through the entry way, closing that door, then down the hall to our room. As he closes the door to our bedroom he twirls around and presses me against it while taking possession of my mouth and any remaining senses. I’ve lost track of time when he pulls back and whispers in my ear “I need you to fuck me John” leading me the last few steps to the bed.
“Yeah, thanks. I know what it’s used for. Ok. Let’s talk about this. You know I have anger management issues.” Sherlock starts to protest. “I’m not saying ‘no’. I’m just saying ‘not now’. I need to know what exactly it is you need from me and if I can give it to you. I’ve never done anything like this before.” I pick up the crop and notice a paddle, leather cuffs and a rope; there is more in the box I can’t see. “I don’t know want to hurt you accidently.”
“I thought you might like to join me in a shower, Rosie will be sleeping for at least an hour.” I wiggle an eyebrow at him and saunter off. I hear the TV click off behind me and grin. I turn up the volume on the baby monitor and place it on the desk in our room.
I brace myself as Sherlock starts to thrust in and out, in and out; slowly at first. He has one hand on my hip and runs his other around to grip my cock. The angle I’m bent at has Sherlock hitting my prostate at practically every thrust. As he fucks me, my cock is shoved through his hand. The pleasure is mounting quickly, I can feel that I am close to release. “Sherlock… I’m close” I manage to gasp out. He tightens his grip on my cock. His pace has quickened, more erratic as he nears his orgasm as well.
Sherlock flies the filled spoon around in circles to get Rosie to open her mouth then plunges it in. He’s smiling while doing so. “I haven’t used if for any experiments, so yeah. Should be in the wall cabinet in the loo down here.” At me, then towards Rosie “Such a good girl Bee, eat up.”
“Hmm.” Taking another sip from his glass, “I’m just glad she’s not out there chasing after criminals like we did though. Exciting as it was, we took too many chances. I almost lost you a few times.”
“Not without a magic hat Pumpkin.” Daddy John tries to calm her down, patting snow into another smaller ball.
John can hear Sherlock putting things away as he answers, just loud enough to carry that far. “I’m ‘Dada,’ you’re ‘Papa.’ She was asking for you.”
Mycroft must still be following us on the CCTV for there is a black sedan waiting for us outside the A&E. Without a word Sherlock gets in the back and I follow a bit more gingerly. We don’t say a thing, caught in our own thoughts. My anger is simmering all the way back to the flat. I don’t want to have an argument in front of Mycroft’s people.
Sighing in frustration “Migraines, for John, bring light and scent sensitivity. The folded towel blocks the light and is a signal to me not to wake him until the designated time. Odds are he has a bit of menthol cream under his nose to block scent.” Lestrade frowns and gives him a confused look. “There was a jar of the stuff on the nightstand.” Sherlock opens the cupboard over the sink, bringing down an old chipped Cambridge mug from the back. Retrieving a key hidden inside he motions for Greg to follow him.
Molly and Mrs. Hudson beautifully redecorated Rosie’s room, fit for a growing lady, with lovely wallpaper and new updated furniture. Mycroft approved of it enough that he asked their opinions about fixtures in Rosie’s new bathroom. With Mycroft’s influence, the attic storage space was renovated as well dividing the space in half. In the end Rosie had a playroom with a wall of cupboards to store toys and games and a separate storage area with open shelves and cabinets with room for a few pieces of furniture Mrs. Hudson couldn’t part with.
I smile at Sherlock “I never told you how Mycroft got my attention that first night, the pink lady, did I?” Sherlock shakes his head in negation. “Mycroft asked me, over a pay phone I had picked up, ‘Do you see it?’ referring to CCTV cameras, exactly how Kevin did. It brought back the memory of being abducted.” I hand him over Rosie, he hugs her and reaches out a free hand for me. “I do agree Kevin has been keeping busy. I don’t think he’s happy living here all alone.”
Smiling, “That I can do, one sandwich and two coffees coming up. John still drink his coffee black?”
I pull out my laptop, there are a few new requests for help on the blog. I see where Sherlock had already solved at least one case while we’ve been gone. I calculate the rate and send them an email with a link to our PayPal account. I find a couple emails that sound interesting and forward them over to Sherlock.
Mycroft exasperated, “The poor woman is in her seventies Sherlock, she can’t be chasing a toddler around day and night.”
John knows that greeting, tone and look, Mycroft is up to something and it’s not going to be pleasant. “Okay, out with it Mycroft. Is this where you tell me if I hurt Sherlock they’ll never find my body?”
He looks at me in deduction mode for a moment, I must have passed as he smiles at me. “Thank you John. You are being more understanding than I thought you would be.” I’ve never hear his voice so gentle before.
John reaches out for his phone as Sherlock hands it to him “Sarah? Yeah. Hi.” Listens to whatever she is saying on the other end while watching Sherlock practically drool at him. “I wouldn’t be able to make it in for a couple of hours.” He cannot help but react to Sherlock staring at him like that, which makes Sherlock’s ogling worse. Cough “You know what, now that I’ve checked my calendar I can’t make it in today. Maybe tomorrow?” Staring at Sherlock, voice rough, John runs a hand up the underside of his own rapidly hardening cock. Sherlock, licking his lips, starts to undress quickly, popping a couple shirt buttons in his haste.
He clicks on the second picture showing the living room/kitchen area, there is just an edge of a woodstove in the corner. There are three solid doors and a set of two open glass French doors leading to another brighter room. “Nice bar area, good height for a lab.” We both notice the microscope on the counter. Next picture is a shot of the kitchen itself “Refrigerator, and a freezer, old fashioned looking stove. Not many cabinets, not much storage. He mentioned a in a previous email as having a large pantry though.”
Doctor Mike Stamford is a chubby jovial man with short chestnut brown hair and bright, light blue eyes, smiling with an open, guileless, bespectacled face. He greets Lestrade with a steady firm handshake, “So, where’s my patient then?” He asks Sherlock jovially.
Shocked and confused, “Really? I’ve never known you buy milk or any other groceries for that matter.”
Half an hour later, back at Baker Street. “Molly wants to do what?!?” Sherlock exclaims, “Is she insane? Has she lost her mind…”
When the music stops, Mycroft coughs regaining my attention. I step up to greet Sherlock half way between the chairs and where the British Government is standing in front of the Gates. Together we walk the last few steps hand-in-hand to stop in front of Mycroft.
John was in his old red chair in front of the burning fire, slowly sipping from a cup of tea in his left hand. Re-reading an old dog eared Ian Fleming book in his right, ‘From Russia With Love’ can be seen from the crinkled binding on the small, soft sided tome. He was dressed warmly in a blue checked button down shirt and his favourite Christmas jumper, a red plaid wool blanket draped across his denim clad lap.
‘I’ve Got My Love To Keep Me Warm’ by Dean Martin was coming through the speakers on the stereo. Outside, snowflakes were gently drifting down the windows, framing the sparkling tree between them. The pile of presents below the decorated tree were reflecting the multi-coloured twinkling lights.
“I do. Didn’t Mycroft say Sherlock was going to sacrifice himself instead of shooting one of you two at Sherrinford?”
A week later a box arrived with a Jerusalem postmark containing a rosary as well as a Star of David.
It takes me only a quick glance to notice. I’m not sure how well versed at reading topographic maps Sherlock is. I give Sherlock another minute before I point out the error “Isn’t the county road on the other side of this mountain?” Sherlock looks at me in admiration, I was able to surprise him again.
“Great. Oh, and I left a gun cleaning kit on the table along with the nature books. Quail season opened today too.”
Sherlock watches in horror as Roberta picks up the nail gun and practically dances her way over to where John is secured to a nearby pillar. Unknown to his captors, he has been picking the lock of the handcuffs securing him.
“He did buy an old hunting club. Open the next email, he sent several; probably more pictures.” I rub Sherlock’s thigh.
From behind Greg they hear a “Morning. What smells so good?” as John limps in wearing denims and a black polo shirt.
“John seems like such a quiet and calm chap until he or someone he cares about is threatened, then look out! He’s protected Sherlock and myself on a number of occasions, saving both our lives more times than I care to recall. He is not above sacrificing his own wellbeing to protect those around him either.“
My left arm is still in a sling as we leave the hospital the next evening. Thankfully Molly dropped by last night on her way to work with a bag of clothes Mrs. H put together. Mycroft must be cleaning up a mess elsewhere as there is no black sedan waiting to transport us this time. Sherlock hails a taxi to take us home. He’s restless and can’t keep still, bobbing his knees in the cab. When we arrive in Baker Street, Sherlock bounds out of the cab and practically runs into 221, leaving me to pay the cabbie. When I get up to the flat Sherlock is pacing like a caged tiger.
Glancing at the small crowd now around them. “We should pick up a change of clothes on the way.” Sherlock adds.
It’s a warm day so I change into clean jeans and a button down, I grab a pair of shoes and wander to the lounge to put them on. Greg and Mrs. Hudson are still in the kitchen talking, Rosie sitting in the high chair. “She gets grumpy without her nap, just saying” I pipe up as I walk by.
John didn’t realize just how depressed he had become until he received an envelope in the mail that enclosed a CD with “Miss you” penned on it. Slightly panicked, John phoned Sherlock to come to the flat. Mary sent yet another message, this time to the two of them. She encouraged them to remain best friends and stay together.
“Oh, John dear, you know me too well. My friend Irma passed away yesterday, she was a year younger than me.”
“Ta Mrs. H. You usually bake more when you’re upset, everything alright?” I ask rising to go help prepare the cups of tea.
John and Sherlock quickly look at each other, “We can always give it a try when we’re done. Magic hats are very rare though baby, I’ve been looking for one all my life.” Her Daddy explains.
“Fantastic.” John mumbles sarcastically. Then questioning, “Is there any way we can slow them down? Block the door or something?”
John and Sherlock don’t hear the knock on the door downstairs or the quick conversation between Mrs. Hudson and a man’s deep voice. They hadn’t bothered to close the door into the flat when they got back as it was warm and the open window in the stairwell allowed a cooling breeze to flow through. The footsteps on the stairs were drowned out by heavy breathing, increased heart rates and moaning.
“I’ve been thinking a lot about this since I moved back here. I, um” cough “I’m not sure if this is something you would want. I, uh.” I can’t look at him, I know he’s staring at me from the corner of my eye though.
I look around, hearing the sound of an engine in the distance behind me. I’m almost to the top of the ridge, damn. I keep walking, feeling somewhat better finally.
“None of my clothes fit anymore, I need to add another hole to my belt to keep my trousers up.” Growled.
“Self-release isn’t as effective, it doesn’t always work. Besides I did that in the shower already” he huffs “I need you in my life John, nothing will change that.” He starts to pace again, agitated.
“Be sure to call, make sure we’re not busy. Yeah?” I order back at him. Greg takes a pace back and Sherlock smirks. I’ll have to remember to be more authoritative in the future with both as I grin. I walk to the door as Sherlock opens it. Greg has an odd look on his face again as we leave but says nothing.
“What? Oh, yeah. Lestrade took them down to the yard. He’s booking them on assault, multiple murders and antiquities smuggling. They didn’t put up much of a fight considering. I thought mafia types would be more intimidating.” Sherlock grumbles, disappointed look on his face.
“Who, who.” Mrs. Hudson lowly announces, carrying in a tray with tea. “I made some biscuits earlier, I thought you might like some.” Placing the try on the coffee table, on top of the papers left from their last case.
“As if there is none here now?” waving a hand around. The flat is cleaner than usual, but has an ‘eloquent’ layer of dust starting up after all the reconstruction.
Mycroft nods and steps closer. “I can keep John entertained if you desire to” he looks at Sherlock from head to toe, “freshen up.”
Sherlock removes both fingers. I moan in protest until I feel three fingers enter. The protest becomes pleasure quickly as he gently brushes against my prostate. I all but arch off of the bed in ecstasy. “Please Sherlock” panting “Please, I need… fuck me… I’m ready.”
Sherlock gives me a surprised look “You know? How? Never mind. It should be fine. I’ll go and get it.” He’s beaming as he walks back in Rosie’s room a couple minutes later. “Is there anything in particular you want to hear?” he asks softly.
“John and I made it yesterday, you did read on his blog he’s teaching me how to cook right?” Testing the temperature of the bottle of formula in his hands.
Not quite an hour later I wake to Rosie making faint babbling noises through the baby monitor. Sherlock is still asleep in my arms on the couch. I try my best to not wake him as I slide out to go attend to my daughter. Just as I shimmy out from under him he mumbles “No. Stay. Don’t go. Comfortable.”
Kevin removes his ear protection “I forgot how well you could shoot with either hand Doc! I have more ammunition in the soft bag. Let me grab the shotguns and rifles, I have no worries about leaving you two with the handguns.” He’s smiling as he goes back to the Jeep.
John squints open his left eye and gently squeezes Sherlock’s hand holding his. The nurse finally comes in, “Oh, Mr. Watson you’re awake. Let me go page the Doctor.” Before either can say anything she’s gone.
“Yeah, we’re, um, ah…, through for now. If we have any further questions one of us will call.” Greg hesitates. “You two alright?”
I lean into him a bit “Ta love” patting his hands over my abdomen. “Shall we bring in the last of our stuff then?” Sherlock kisses the back of my head and releases me grabbing a bag in each hand.
Greg looks at me. “Apparently we’re getting married in two days. Okay. Good.” I’m a bit panicked but okay.
“Here” Kevin announces when he comes back in “Excedrin, it has aspirin and acetaminophen. Take two, it’ll bring down the fever.” He orders me handing the bottle over along with a glass of water.
Sherlock squeezes John’s hand back, “I’ve missed you, I was starting to worry you wouldn’t wake up…”
Turning his head and peaking his left eye open John grins back “It’s not every day I shoot someone to save a person I just met. I didn’t know you felt that way… explains a lot.” Places his hand over Sherlock’s on his shoulder.
“Good question…” Sherlock thinks a moment, continuing to bounce Rosie on his knee. “The train would be faster, but Rosie might not like the rocking and the noise. Plus with all the luggage we would need for a week away with an infant, too much for said train and only two adults.” Rising with Rosie on a hip, Sherlock leans against the kitchen doorway and watches John as he puts away the groceries. “A rental car would probably be easiest, no need to carry luggage too far. We could stop if Rosie starts to fuss.”
“I’m so glad I came to my senses too. I have loved Sherlock almost since the day we met, just too much of an idiot to realize it. I am happier now than I’ve ever been.” We step back to the table as the wait staff bring a high chair and place it next to Violets seat. Sherlock and I sit next to Violet leaving the chairs next to Siger free for Mycroft and Greg.
Pinching the bridge of his nose while taking a calming breath. “Five minutes, it will take all of five minutes then you can do whatever the bloody hell you want!” John growls.
John pleased, “Thank you Sherlock, that’s very thoughtful of you. And yes, we still have the joint account. I’m not sure how much is in it, I don’t ever use it.”
“John, I know you probably can’t hear me and if you do you will think you were dreaming anyway… so here goes.” Deep breath. “I don’t, strike that. I can’t go on without you anymore. I need you. I love you. Please wake up.” Sniff. “Fucking therapist and her ‘I’ statements…” grumbled.
We didn’t hear Sherlock approach as we were talking “He’s always been a conductor of light. John is a lot smarter than he looks.” He quips, hugging me from the back.
I was finally able to go through and look at the cases Sherlock solved while I was in hospital. This brilliant, amazing, mad man, solved one hundred and one cases in five days! Extraordinary! From my bedside, well sometimes sitting on my bed. Point is, he never left my side. Solved them all through pictures and information sent via text and email.
“Hmmm, let’s see; Kevin says it is about half way between Boonville and Manchester.” I get up with my laptop and set it next to his on the coffee table. I sit and look at the map he brings up.
Around 5:30, I’m contemplating on starting supper or just opting out and ordering in when I receive a text from Sherlock.
“Hold on Mycroft.” John, without waiting for an answer, covers the phone with his hand “Sherlock, we’re at risk if this person is already following us.”
Instead of a phone call, he is stripped and thoroughly searched, even in places he didn’t know could be searched and he is a Doctor. They took away his clothes and left him only with a stained, too large, threadbare orange jumpsuit that had seen better days. At least it was clean and it was warmer than remaining naked.
While he’s still coming down from his pleasure I’m able to unhook him form the ropes and manage to remove the leather cuffs. I sit next to him to rub his shoulders, upper arms and chest one handed. He looks sleepily at me “thank you sir”.
Reluctantly Sherlock lets go of John’s hand to rummage in the bag. He brings out a washbag, pajamas a housecoat and slippers. He digs in once more to bring out a tin, placing it on the bedside table. He turns back to John to bend down and whispers in his ear, “I’ll be back shortly, and don’t go where I can’t follow” then kisses him on the cheek.
“Good morning to you too, I’m feeling much better by the way thanks.” Sarcastic. Making up his mind and coming to attention. “I was going to tell you a bit more gently but… I’ve been offered another position and I signed a contract. Vega can have my hours, starting today if he wants. I’ll just go clear out my stuff.” John, giving up on tea as a lost cause, does an about turn to leave.
The two men are facing one another on the bed in the darkened bedroom, Sherlock is lying on his side, John on his stomach. It’s quiet down here, the small bedroom faces the courtyard and alley to the rear of the building. The sounds of traffic going by on Baker Street is muffled almost to the point of nonexistence. The main noise they do overhear are the breathy snores of their landlady in the next room through the old walls. The little light coming through the curtained window is further blocked by a dormant apple tree in the garden plot out the back door.
“Yeah, those tights aren’t hiding a thing are they?” John licks his lips checking Sherlock’s arse out. The green tights his husband is wearing show off his backside beautifully, course they didn’t hide much in the front either. John is very happy his top covers him to mid-thigh with Sherlock in that outfit.
Sherlock nods, “You will learn everything John, in time. For now, Mycroft and I believe it would be best you not know. We still need to make sure she will stay around to have your child.
About the time I finish putting what I need in the jar and try to seal it, Sherlock is done washing the greens. He leans against my back and reaches around me carefully to hold the jar while I tighten the lid. “Thanks” I kiss his cheek “just needs a good shake when you’re ready to use it.”
As he walks out John calls out, “Thank you Mycroft.” Mycroft waves his umbrella on his way out in acknowledgement.
“It’s fine, good.” I reach over and cup my hand over his holding the jar. Sherlock tenses under my touch. I adjust my grip to take his pulse, elevated. His eyes are dilated. Interesting. “So good in fact I believe you deserve a reward…” I rise and walk around behind him, leaning in I softly purr in his ear “What would you like as a treat love?” I run my hands over his shoulders and down his chest, kissing behind his ear and along his jaw.
Molly steps to the side opposite Greg and I. Sherlock stops at the end of the chairs a few steps away, waiting for the music to finish. We stare at one another while we wait, everyone else disappears to me, and it is just the two of us.
The headaches were subsiding (sigh). At least I wasn’t knocked out this time around, I was slammed, make that forcibly thrown, against a wall. The concussion was only mild this time, came too soon after the last one though. Also have a few bruised ribs, at least nothing was broken.
“Euros. She disguised herself and flirted with me on the bus, gave me her number without my prompting. I tried to throw it out but I was so flattered, I couldn’t do it. We texted. Nothing more, but deep down I wanted more. She was clever and amusing. I did end it before it got too far; I felt guilty for cheating.
“I’m just glad he was there, I could have ended up anywhere.” John mumbles, trying not to squirm as Mike tends his wounds.
We talk about possible renovations, mostly between Sherlock and Mrs. H. The delay did give me the opportunity to think more about what kind of rewards Sherlock might like. I brought up items from my childhood I did not enjoy for punishments, keeping him in mind though. For rewards I recall how he reacts when I bring out my authority be it medical or military – the man has a kink or two! Course I’m not complaining mind.
I almost sigh in relief as I hear the door open followed by a high-pitch giggle from Rosie. “What are you doing here Mycroft?” Sherlock gently places Rosie on the couch at my right.
“The drive down was uneventful Mummy. Nothing to note other than John’s abysmal taste in music.” Sherlock answers.
I shudder “I know love, you’re doing really well. He was always an ignorant bastard about some things, relationships being biggest among them. When we went to bars in Afghanistan together I was always able to steal whatever girl he was with, hardly any effort involved.” I lean our foreheads together. “Just remember he’ll be gone in a couple days, then we will have the place to ourselves for a month. Just think of the reward.”
Our first stop after getting the jeep is to visit with Kyle and Joan. Sherlock remembered how to find his way back to their house by the good road. They are very friendly and offer to help if we need assistance with anything. Reminding Kevin they’ll be out of town for a week in October themselves along with Sean and his wife. After them we drive up to the top of Buck Peak to see the view and find the brass forestry marker stating the name (Buck Peak) and height (2657 feet).
“Thank you love.” Giving Sherlock a quick kiss on the lips. Sherlock tasted sweet and tart from the mixture of wine and gingerbread.
