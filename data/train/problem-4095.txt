“This is the old one, from before the Troubles. Luckily the spirits here are quiet, or tend towards staying within this area over bothering anyone. I would say they’re far more benevolent than malicious. It’s only after the Ganems were taken by the Dreadful that the spirits became dangerous for a short period of time.” Millie glances around as they continue to walk near each other. It’s so strange that Castiel is so...soft? No, that’s not quite the word for it. Millie tries hard to figure out what it is as they walk and speak, mostly about the area or any local spot of notice.
Dean glances over at Castiel, his eyes curious and looking even more like Millie’s own while watching and speaking to Castiel. It’s strange, noticing that both are the same height, that they have much the same look, that though some of Dean’s look is masculine, his long eyelashes and freckles reminding Castiel of Millie’s own, and though his voice is deeper than Millie’s feminine one—
“That’s not news,” Castiel mutters, “and I believe it’s likely me he is able to track, though he has shown some sensitivity towards the others. It would also strengthen the theory that he is one of those who was contracted through Hell.” He frowns at the reminder.
?” He lets out a breath, trying to calm down. “I just wanna see Sammy again. I wanna get out of here. I’m stuck here ‘cause you all think I’m enjoying it, I’m not. Every day I’m on eggshells – it’s a wonder they don’t’ see through me, and I got a few of them that might.”
The choices are getting slimmer and slimmer, something Dean hates to admit to himself. The Walls are probably going to be repaired and closed off, leaving escape into the Outland impossible. Hiding down in the Garden or Scrapyard after all of this? Impossible too – he’s a pariah by now for calling down a Seraph on Walt and Roy, and it’s known by now that he spent time in Hell as Alistair’s favorite. If he leaves from work now, he’ll have a bunch of Investigators looking for him too, wanting to find out what happened, why he left…and figuring out who he was.
Dean blinks at the question, looking over at Castiel with surprise before slowly shaking his head. “I just gotta go meet up with him tonight. He didn’t say why there’s another test or anything. Didn’t tell me much, but I don’t think I would’ve listened to him if he had.” He lets out a snort. “I’m kinda pathetic like that.”
The name causes more than a few to make a sign of warding, though Dean himself doesn’t. If he did, he might make a sign to get himself in trouble, or an Outlander sign of disrespect and loathing.
“Since it meant he would be following around someone like Mr. Davies, or since it got us so close to the Smith party,” Castiel mutters as they walk, looking around at the area. “Uriel seems far too invested in that man.”
Dean Smith is male-presenting, so is viewed as he/him by Castiel and others. Dean thinks of themselves as they/them.
If Dean Smith, who was an upstanding citizen, could be so disturbed, then what would one like Quicksilver feel?
When Dean had been younger, and learning about the work that the Winchesters and Campbells did at the seat of their governesses, they’d believed fully in the Cause. Over time, things were how they were. They believed that the Campbells were Blessed, that the Winchesters noble, and that the family motto was true.
The final burst of speed sends him through the final bit of junk and rotting flora and fauna, reams of used plastic printing waiting to be recycled for another round scattering under his feet as he goes. He takes a chance and dives for the opening, barely making it through and feeling the wind from the Seraphim’s wings as it banks up, the rumble in the vent, and everything rattling as he quickly heads down the way. He’s sure that it’ll try to follow him, but for everyone else, the vents are dangerous, a maze that no one has mapped out completely. He still doubles back a few times, and takes the long route to his rendezvous spot, making it with time to spare. The diamond-like structures work to close up a hole made from one of the last attacks to gain entrance into the Echelon by some group outside, though it’s only allowed in a few people to make up the ranks of the downtrodden in what the Tiered folk calls the ‘Garden’.
Impala snorts, and Dean laughs, patting her nose and leaning into the giant black horse. “I’m quite silly, I know, but it’s so nice to not think it’s my fault.”
Castiel glances at her as she looks into one of the storefronts. “Mr. Davies is considered quite handsome with a few of the ladies in town, and he is obviously a very capable man. He manages to fight off a spirit who gained an advantage on Uriel, who is no fainting flower himself.”
Sonny shrugs as he offers Dean another cup of coffee. “You’re a big deal, I guess. Either way, hearing some heavy-hitting Empyrean people will back you up is nothing to be upset about.” Dean sips his coffee as he thinks. “What?”
Benny chuckles and lets out a groan as pain comes back, massaging his sore shoulder. “He’s less of a prized stag, more a--.”
Dean lets out a breath in annoyance at this new development. Running Martin out of town isn’t an option, and while leaving the estate to someone else to run is tempting, it’s already been a month or more that they’ve established themselves in the town. After the fire and attack against Mother and Sam, they’d been on the move so often, Dean had almost forgotten what this was like. Plus, a Fell-touched spirit had attacked an
"The week together only seems to work to confirm the Placement is right. Within just a short period of time, they work seamlessly together, fixing whatever issue comes up to them. Even Uriel cannot really work with Castiel so well. But each day, to have such a temptation, it made Castiel wonder if Dean knew what he was doing, who Castiel was, and what Castiel will ask of him near the end of all of this."
, Bobby! How stupid do you all think I am? How long were you going to string me along before you told me I’m doing this all for some test? If it’s a test, I’d like to know so I could, maybe,
The feel of a gun against his head signals the trap this obviously was as Mick chuckles, though he looks far from happy to see who was behind him. Castiel considers for a long moment before saying, “A gun will gain more attention than you’d want, Ketch. I suggest you don’t try to stop me from what I’m doing.”
It was a truth universally acknowledged that any Dreadful, upon finding a nest suitable to their needs, would go to ground. It’s known by many, yet despite this, just as many cling to their old-fashioned social etiquettes, never leaving them even when it results in their homes becoming nests.
He works as subtly as he can, tracking the bracelet as it leaves the building and heads out. He does his best to remain at a distance, recalling what Dean had mentioned before about his ability to lose Castiel, but also about the cases. If he gets too close, that could cause a problem. Still, allowing Dean the chance to do this would go a long way in ensuring he remained an ally, even after this change.
Dean offers a small shrug, looking a bit pained. Uriel seems to look at him even more seriously before asking, “You heard what happened to your sister, and about the attack?”
“Truthfully, no” he says, not seeing her stiffen at the admission, “but I was hoping he would at least care for his guests, though I’m grateful to have a ball if it means being introduced to you.”
“I did,” Bela told them as Benny nods in agreement, continuing with what he’d been told by Phillip and the others. The Dreadful had attacked even before Christian got out, and spread fast. It’s likely something else was working there, which Dean had to agree on - likely there’s a Fell-touched nearby, or the Ganems tried something and failed at it. Christian had realized he couldn’t fight them, closed and sealed the entrance, and left. The end result was many of the servants had been trapped with the Dreadfuls.
“I am free for the next dance, Castiel,” she says in a near-quiet voice, blushing hard as Castiel all but
Dean laughs at that, hard enough that he bends over in the hallway. Castiel looks down, bending a bit to check on him as Dean finally straightens, putting an arm around Castiel. “I’m ok...just...it’s been a while since I laughed that hard.” He gives Castiel a warm smile as they walk further into the house, Castiel seeing how carefree Dean looks right now, after such a laugh.
“Uriel will still have to speak to Mick, but that might be a feat since Mick is avoiding him for what he said to Millie,” Dean teases, getting Castiel to nod in agreement despite it. “Thank you...for asking, and for standing by my wishes. It’s...hard.”
Dean straightens and motions towards the stairs, “He’s upstairs in a guest room. George will show you the way. Uriel didn’t say a lot about what was going on last night, but he was more in need of rest over interrogation.”
He frowns slightly at the question, coming a minute into the dance. “I am used to dancing, but not so used to talking while dancing.”
Uriel is quiet, glancing over at Castiel before saying, “You should not apologize. I was...I said something to your sister that was not what a gentleman or Angel should say. I will write her a formal apology, and offer my own now to you.” He bowed low, something Castiel hadn’t seen him done in - well, he’d never seen him do it really - before to anyone. Dean seems to read that this is important, and holds up a hand easily to have Uriel straighten.
It’s early when Hannah arrives, looking far more upset than she normally does as he finishes his breakfast. “The Hunters have arrived, led by Sam Winchester. They also include Bobby Singer. Both are names that appear prominently in Dean’s file.” She sits, letting out a long, upset breath. “I don’t like them.”
“I am glad you know so much of the rumors, Meg, but what of the truth?” he asks after offering a slight chuckle.
Your career path, best breeding partner, and friends and family were all set at each visit and Evaluation that took place. Each time a person came in to challenge a Placement, a valid reason had to be given, but the most recent official Evaluation also had to give a 60% or higher chance of the challenge succeeding. Failing to meet that criteria and continuing through with whatever idea there is could result in a ReEvalutation, a mark on all governmental and public records, and plenty of issues for that push if it failed to follow through.
Millie does their best to not sweat. It’s a question they’d gotten so often, but somehow hearing it from Cas made them nervous. “My brother traveled, and picked up many things. Though I doubt it was unsealed without someone noticing.” Sammy’s presence was enough to hint that the broken seal might even have been noticed by the Campbells as well. Martin being there had certainly cemented things, but they weren’t going to let that get to them. Fielkett was theirs, and Sammy and the others would have to deal with it, should the full truth come out.
. So either tell me what’s going on, or just let me know you all think I’m worthless and I’ll fuck off.”
“We’ll see what we can do to draw Creaser out, but carefully. If we’re not careful he’ll spill or try to call in another Hunter, one who’s less likely to take things in stride, or he’ll get Christian or someone else back here.” That was probably the bigger threat - that a Campbell would come after the Hunter did. “Benny, we’re going to go in a week’s time and get some supplies from our contacts, as well as more items to set up the house and make it defensible. If you can get a few servants who need a place, do so.”
Dean hums before saying, “Well, if they do, the hives’ll be useful, and you’ll be able to get in some good honey. That’s always a good thing.” He smiles a bit as Castiel looks at him, “Plus you’ll be able to apologize to everyone with honey.”
Dean can’t think about that, though, his mind too trapped by his body’s need as pleasure soaks through him. “Ah, s-sir…ah, n-no…”
They have a few hours to go before it gets dark, and if they don’t, Bela will have to report the news to the nearest encampment, garrison, or village.
“He was already out looking, and went to call upon Fielkett for aid. Naomi is watching the home and will send word if he returns home, but….”
“I deny something that cannot be proven - I do not know a Lady Winchester here, nor do I know of the Angels in my Garrison courting anyone in any manner.” That might be a lie, but it’s one that Castiel is fine with saying two these two men.
The general atmosphere is less tense than he’d expect, but he can see Uriel giving Dean a look that says he has an idea of what happened. Castiel’s glare at him gets him to focus through the remainder of the meeting before the various screens were closed, Dean relaxing quite a bit more when it was just those two. He seems grateful that no one knew what happened between them, let alone the fact that he was Quicksilver.
“Please,” Allan states, taking both aspirin and water as he sets up things for the day. Despite their start, and Allan’s threat that hung over them, the man was tolerable compared to other Investigators, and he was a good fit for Dean Smith. He seemed to view any of the subtle hints of Dean Winchester as simply a quirk that came up when the stress got to him. The work here gave him enough hints and tips to be better when he finally gets out of here and back down where he belongs, stops eating just this stupid diet food to keep up appearances.
There’s little on the Queue for his liking, so Dean checks on what errands he must run to keep up his appearance, heading out and down a bit before his burner phone chimes briefly in his pocket. He works on the bracelet a bit, making it only pick up the ambient noises so it appears like he’s not speaking to someone, before answering. “Yeah?”
Sam and the others glare at them all, Dean waiting before they speak again, knowing the younger man will listen to this part. “Some of the Dreadfuls got out the back, or were out when the sun rose. The house is cleared up, but we’ll need to stay there for a bit to get the rest, if the garrison nearby doesn’t.”
“I suppose I should preface anything I ask first by admitting that I do not believe good men keep secrets. Secrets are what ultimately resulted in the current anger the Angels and others have towards each other, and secrets have all brought about the rise of the Dreadfuls and Fell-touched.” Dean is quiet as they walk, listening intently to Castiel as he speaks. “It is perhaps a reason we see that rune your sister had as so odd and perhaps distasteful in a sense - protection is granted, but transformation requires one to hide themselves, or change so as to escape a reality. Angels have never had to do such things, though some might argue that we already have, after Cunningham Bridge. We do not see transformation, but instead to take what we learn, and grow from it.”
It’s one of the issues Dean has with staying here. Even though he has a lot of fun playing Investigator, he’s not someone who wants to be in this place. He’s seen the Outlands and being on the Tiers makes him wonder about the issues that Dad and the others always bring up. Before Cold Oaks and Alistair, he’d been all for simply sticking it to the system. Now, he’s more worried about finding Sammy before he gets into more trouble or ends up caught and executed like some of the others.
“Nothing that you’d need to worry about for the moment,” Castiel tells him, offering a warm smile before reaching out to touch his hand. “Rest up, Uriel. I’d rather you are better instead of worrying about me.”
Mick seems to be overly worried as Benny and Charlie seem to take what he says to heart, the group breaking up shortly afterwards, Mick following him as he heads up towards the inevitable talk with Allen - Castiel - about everything.
He was well and truly caught, but so was Cas. Either way, they made a great team, and Dean wasn’t about to waste time wondering if he belonged here or with Sam and Bobby. He was a child of Outland and the Echelon, and he belonged here.
Allen moves from where he’s standing, allowing Dean access to the privacy cover. Dean pauses, glancing at Allen. “Why are you here, really?”
Dean is quiet at that for a moment, giving Castiel a strange glance, before saying, “I suppose, though we do have a brother...though we practically raised him, we are not as close as I believe he thought us to be with him.”
Castiel sighs, shaking his head and finally says, “I’m sure none of us are so bird-witted. Though I would think you’d show the garrison here some respect.” He sees Smith look at him, waiting, before his eyes dart down to Castiel’s blade, then back up to his eyes.
The next vent he gets out is luckily too dangerous to normally leave from, but a brief bit of maintenance allows him to slip through as the fresh rain starts. The water is real, as are the cycles - the corp that built this beast back in the day made sure that they wanted for nothing - and it helps to clear up some of the mess he’d collected before he gets into the groups and weaves through the crowd carefully, managing to walk through all the way up to the entrance of the Third Tier before slipping through a few more places and ducking into a public restroom. It’s a simple enough thing to wash himself off, make himself more presentable than he feels after the theft, and get back to the crowd with no one the wiser. He quickly moves to the green foliage that takes him along the various walkways and tree-lined sidewalks before stopping to check on some of the fruit in the area. It gives him time to clean off his boots more than before, and then he uses some of the ivies to scale up to the closed fire escape on one side. No one seems to notice or care, so he quickly gets to his destination without any fuss. Luckily the bathroom window is still open, and he changes quickly before checking the time.
Dean quickly retreats into the Walls and realizes quickly at the continued panic that this isn’t going to be easy. He realizes it’ll be bad when the sensation and sound of the Seraph are now reverberating
“If I mix you up more in this, Sam will take your head,” Dean had told him, offering a weak smile before taking his hand and kissing it as well. “You’re a wonderful person, but I can’t tie you more into this. If you ever need my help, though, you have it.” Gordon had looked at him sadly, having ensured Dean and Mick got somewhere safe, and then left after ensuring he’d been cured. However, considering that the next time Dean heard anything, it had been that Gordon had killed Kubrik and was now a wanted man. The pain of that had caused Dean to decide to take the simple name of ‘Smith’ and not return.
“You’re gonna take your Evaluation?” One asks, sounding upset. He’s a Savage - a runaway with bright red hair and dark brown eyes - so he would be.
“That was not Mr. Smith’s fault, Balthazar,” Castiel’s stern voice gets them to look over, seeing the other two Angels, including the much-recovered Uriel, there, “he doesn’t have to throw a ball for such a reason.”
It’s bad odds, depending on what’s in there, but Dean isn’t about to let this nest fester and grow. Not when it means saving more people.
“I’m sure after a month in town, Balthazar will be less prone to angering people,” Castiel tries as they head back in, leaving him to wonder if Dean would like that. Having the paperwork would make things so much easier, but this is...also fun. Figuring out what small word or phrase will draw out information from Dean, trying to see around the walls that Dean had built up. At the same time, all Castiel wants out of this is for Dean to get his ReEvaluation so he might properly be with Castiel, fully, and the play and dance around each other can be forgotten.
Dean finds the secured call nodes quickly, shifting to pull it out with his right arm as he quickly sets it to send out the warning tune into the Walls. He gives it a minute as the shaking grows stronger before he pulls and cuts out that part, the sabotage obvious but needed.
“I let them know it pulled one,” Dean said, “and I wasn’t gonna hang around to see if it was the same bastard that tried to get me from Hell.” The reminder of what he’d gone through to try to get Sam out of Cold Oaks, the price that Sam had raked up and left Dean with, gets Bobby to shut up at least. “I’m not responsible for them not getting away or sticking to the Walls. Or did it go in to get them?”
, “a malevolent one...stronger than what we normally see here. It was suspected one got into Fielkett at the initial loss, but we never spotted it…”
“N-not…not fair. Not fair sir, please keep going, fuck, ‘m sorry for lying, for—ah!” The hard thrust in him is almost enough to make him cum, if he hadn’t after that freakin’ touch. The grueling pace is just shy of brutal, and leaves Dean clinging for life as his body shakes from each pleasurable touch, the feel of buttons and cloth against his back only that much strangely sexy, the reminder that Allen - no, he’s the Seraph Castiel - wanted this, cared for this, but that they’re going to hit the ground running and…and…
Dean likes to think that he was just a lot better at convincing the guy as Dean Smith, a man willing to do anything, over Dean Winchester, who wouldn’t’ve put up with this for as long as he has, had it not been for Sammy.
There's a late addition to the Smith party, but their arrival and a letter sent brings up the Hunters - specifically, the next Lord Winchester - to speak to Castiel about "something".
“You’re thinking so much, it’s waking me up,” Uriel mutters from where he’s resting as Castiel looks up. “What did you hear that got you to think he’s bad?”
Sam glances around at that mention, the others looking about worriedly as Dean waits. Sam and the others in his group - well, any of those in the Campbell group - would go after the Dreadfuls if necessary. However, many did not enjoy or even take pride in taking back the estates or anything else they might clear out, often willing them to the Men of Letters to use for bases in the country, or, more often, leaving them to ruin when a garrison was close. The Men of Letters liked their control, and garrisons caused that control to slip.
But even more unnerving is that so much of a push is made simply because they wish for Dean to return for their own reasons. Castiel cannot claim to be free of selfish reasons for why he wants Dean - that was argued already - but he at least attempted to understand what Dean needs, the time he needed, and not to push him into having another Evaluation or Placement when he was in a vulnerable state. If anything, Castiel gave Dean as much space as possible.
This is not labeled for smut 'cause there's no smut, though I TRIED. They wanted their feelings validated first. Also from here the chapters get a bit longer.
“Worried about the little hellhound, are you?” The term is not one that Castiel likes for him. “We’re here about the Hunters and how they used the Evaluation and Placement. Multiple parties, not just yourself, expressed concern when they noted Dean scored high from what was given out. You’re the only one, though, to claim all margins at the top percentile for the most recent Evaluation and Placement. It’s why Crossroads is involved...paperwork and deals are our things.”
them, so sadly I cannot say they lived up to my father’s expectations, and thus cannot say they were truly accomplished, or simply given to lying.”
Allen nods. “Quicksilver came to try to save those within the Walls, and the trail led us here.” Allen’s in Dean’s personal space now, making him swallow. The only other time he was like this was early on, when threats were his way of controlling him. Dean Smith cowed to him often enough, but Dean Winchester hated it. If he’d not needed the work, the place to hide, he’d have shot the man where he stood. Now, the sudden friction of realizing how bad things are for him makes Dean hope he can get out of this.
“He is taking more and more risks. He ran from me early today, and now again.” The attack had given Quicksilver the time and momentum to go into the sewers. “He’s smart…when I do catch him, it will be a day to celebrate.” He sheds his own look, returning to the façade of Emmanuel Allan, before calling up a schematic of the area. “Though, I doubt he’ll be far.”
acting strange to only those who know it. If he does favor Mr. Davies, he’d better start to act like it.”
“Of course, dear Angel.” Her manners were kind enough, as was that of the others who were with her, but the dance never came, as there was the sound of gunfire from outside before a large man and one of the servants rushed in.
Castiel smiles at the suggestion, and while Naomi pouts, she’s the one who speaks up first. “I would enjoy watching Balthazar lose again, if it means he might learn.”
Meg is a bit surprised that Uriel seems a bit annoyed by the discussion before Michal Davies arrives on a rowan horse, nodding to them before he heads into the store. Uriel all but follows him a moment later, Samandiriel following after the other Angel shortly after.
“I didn’t say anything,” Meg protests quietly as they walk down the street, “and besides, why are you so worried over what Uriel does?”
Naomi nods, Castiel bowing as they head back up, Naomi telling him what happened yesterday. The spirit was Fell-touched and had gotten far bolder after managing to hurt Uriel. Luckily, it had not hurt anyone else and had easily been dispatched between Naomi and Balthazar fighting it, though the other group managed to keep it from escaping.
“Had it not been for the different name, we would have assumed it was someone else in the building, and the trail was nearly lost a few times. It was only fatigue that allowed us to catch him, and he did manage to cause us trouble when he tried to help the others escape,” Uriel points out. The thought of it is enough to make Castiel hope that they’re right, but also hope that Dean is able to stay safe in this next part.
It was also the Placement month, and Dean needed that whole time off. If he didn’t have it off, he’d go crazy. He tried, he tried for at least two years, but...yeah.
“Are you gonna do much with the outside?” Dean’s question gets Castiel to pause, looking over at the outside where a variety of things besides the shed are located. He motions to what appeared to be some knocked over beehives and other items that Castiel isn’t quite sure about.
Benny chuckled as Dean offered a smile that showed he seemed to agree with some of Castiel’s assessment. “My...sister was one of them, or so our father claimed. I never claimed it myself for her, since I figured it’s always easier to show off your accomplishments, though not always can one get that across with first impressions.” Davies looks worried as Castiel glances around the group, then back down to the books in his hand, wondering at the verbal territory he wandered into.
She smiles at him before continuing, “The point is many will see Uriel’s attention to Mr. Davies as obvious favoritism if they know how he is. If they don’t, they’ll see it as him being incredibly rude to the one who saved him. He’ll have to apologize if it becomes a big enough insult.” Castiel is quiet about it as Meg finally adds as well, “Whatever else is going on, Uriel
“How can I be sure you’re telling the truth? And either way, the Seraphs went down to the Garden last night. Not a whole lot of people left.” He hadn’t managed to contact Bobby before coming in to work, so he’d have to take his lunch time, if he wasn’t being monitored already. “‘Sides, I’m a liability.”
Castiel sighs. “Yes, though considering what happened to the others, it would have just meant someone else was tasked with these things, one we can’t sense or watch over, meaning we’d have more of a disadvantage, or have to figure out another thief’s motivations. Quicksilver is likely a Winchester or trained by them - he knew the part, even if his knowledge of it is outdated. He knows enough to get items and leave behind enough to make parts work, and within the Garden, he’s viewed favorably until now. Hence why I believe the Men of Letters wish to create a rift - they saw what happens when they attempted a fight while a Seraph was also working. They wish for one like that.”
“That could be their ultimate goal, with Gabriel gone, Lucifer exiled, and Michael and Raphael focused on ensuring our safety from some of the others and fixing up the Walls.” Castiel lets out a long breath as he considers what will happen next. “We will need to act as if the information they graciously ‘gave’ us was what we needed, but we will also have to take out their base as well. We will have to go into the Walls.”
“Then Dean isn’t ready to talk to you. If he is...I’d like for him to meet you at the Centre, for his own peace of mind. If he can’t, we can call you. I’m sure he still has your number somewhere.”
They do their best to avoid Uriel’s eyes as he gets into the carriage, Millie directing it as the Angel watches for others. Expelling such power means they aren’t always able to do a lot after they use it, but they are fearful at that time. Millie has to agree with Mick, though - they are less that, but more beautiful in their own way.
Castiel looks over at him, then back. “What about him? He helped here and is free to go with you or stay. However, with your state, he should go and ensure you are safe.” Dean gives him a long look before nodding, obviously understanding as he says, “I got them.” He gives him a smile that seems almost bittersweet. “Thanks. I won’t forget this sir.”
“Though you’ve been of great help in the last year, Dean, I did manage before you came along. I’ll be fine for today.”
“My, what’s got them so upset?” Balthazar asks as Uriel remains silent, their talkative brother cleaning his weapons and ensuring they are ready for use, “Though I’m a bit sad to hear it’ll be that brother of hers. The woman was cute enough.”
“Isn’t that a type of transformation?” Dean argues, glancing over at him. Castiel is mostly looking forward, but he catches it out of the corner of his eye.
“What’s so interesting about the truth?” she takes his offered arm as they walk out, pausing as they see someone riding up, the dark black, armor-clad horse huffing at them as it comes to a stop. Atop it, Dean Smith sits, offering a small smile to them and tipping his hat to both of them. “Miss Masters. Castiel. I was hoping to ask for a favor from you on behalf of Fielkett.”
Castiel watches Naomi shift in her gray dress, the blue ribbon accenting the high empire waist and along other areas making her appear quite pretty, though gold and black ribbons along the seams near her legging tells of her prowess with magic. Nearby, Samandiriel hides behind Castiel’s dark suit, his own red vest a bit bright in comparison, but working well with the darker trousers he’d picked out, and making him appear far younger than the additional teal corsage would suggest. Balthazar was elsewhere, flirting and dancing around without a care in his dark shirt and trousers, maroon vest, and a few other flairs to show him a master of weapons. Castiel tended to enjoy simply being in his usual dark suits, blue cravats, and simple white shirts, but he did not enjoy the extra attention of being in a dance hall. There was work to be done, and these places, though they aided to raise the spirits of Sandover after the fall of Fielkett, only flirted with disaster as much as Balthazar flirted with the ladies present. His own beige riding coat was elsewhere, and that held all the markings that the others wore so openly among the dance hall.
. He wasn’t so hot after all, if two runs resulted in something like this. He must get out of this situation, and fast.
Lord Wincheter looks like he’s about to call him out on that, but Master Singer decides to finally steps in, holding Lord Winchester back as he speaks, obviously wanting to explain things. Castiel wonders about their side of things, but also is a bit curious why they’re still here when he all but said he doesn’t know who ‘Lady Winchester’ is.
Castiel tilts his head, surprised at the accusation. “Forgive me, I don’t understand what you are speaking about. There are no Winchesters in this area.” He starts to make a motion to have the two leave, but Sam interrupts that, his voice raising as he does.
“I know of someone who’d disagree with the whole ‘accomplished’ thing,” Bela said, smirking at Dean, as if laughing at some inside joke, “What do you think?”
“So... was I the last thing to clear up?” He sees the cool look go from serious to suddenly nervous, a blush spreading across his face as Dean looks down at the floor. “I mean--.”
“True...but he’s a dangerous crazed man, and one who will try to attack an Angel if possible. I’m not losing our good relations now over someone like that, no matter how often he saved Father.”
“I didn’t ask. I was focused on ensuring Uriel’s safe recovery.” He offers her a small smile as an apology, “I am not very good with rumors, remember?”
Millie smiles a bit at that, pausing as they hear something moving in the undergrowth. The two shift as a Dreadful slowly starts to rise up, eyes briefly flashing black to show the arrival of the lesser, vengeful spirits called ‘demons’ by some.
If just having him touch Dean’s arm had gotten him sensitive, the moment he touched that handprint, Dean’s whole body lit up like a string of lights being given a power source. The dim lights seem to flicker at that, and Dean is almost unsure, but Allen’s eyes are glowing the same blue as that Seraph he keeps running from.
Dean lets out a quiet breath and leans back from the letter they’re writing, glancing over to where Samandiriel and Balthazar are sitting, waiting for news from Castiel and Uriel. They’ve done what they could as a host, but it feels like the two Angels are waiting for Dean to do something...more. They aren’t a trained monkey, and the few soft topics have already been covered while they waited. But with Bela out doing shopping, and Benny focusing on the servants, it left Dean to host. Mick was hiding, the coward.
The two bow to each other as the dance ends. Castiel wonders at how Dean looks, though he does appear far happier than normal, before Dean says, “Thank you for the dance. That was enlightening.”
Uriel is already asleep, and Castiel goes back to reading and thinking about the Smith party and what they mentioned.
“Yes. Uriel and I did stay for a little while, and your brother mentioned something while we were there...about a list.”
“The physician mentioned that when speaking to Dean yesterday,” Miss Talbot confirms before saying, “I’m also glad you decided to stay. If either of you need anything, please let us know.” She curtseys as Naomi offers a tight smile to Miss Talbot.
“Nothing on your end?” Uriel is already calmed, and had kept to his word – even after Quicksilver had set off the alarms and everything else he’d managed to not create the damage he could when in the Outlands at his full might. Others are already in, taking care of the structure inside of the Walls and making it easier to repair in case of any attacks, and track anyone who might return for items. “You lost him again, huh?”
Dean smiles at that, chuckling. “He plays a part in this, yeah. Mostly, I wanna know who I am, and what I can do with that. Me knowing that is important, even now. If I was lied to about who I was, and did all the things without realizing it wasn’t my best option, that’d make it bad. That’s against everything the Placements are for. It’s why I have to find out, and I have to go and make sure everything is right.”
Dean appears a bit distracted during the meeting, though Castiel suspects that with all that is going on, that was bound to happen. He’d only just learned who he really was, and from what he’d mentioned before, Castiel had an idea that he had not been raised in Echelon fully, and only integrated into it due to circumstances before him.
Seeing how and where Dean goes is fascinating in a way, and has things not been so serious at this point, he’d take the time to study it far more. As of now, he waits as it stops in a house on the Second Tier, First Choir. It’s rather unassuming, as far as Castiel can see, save that it appeared to have been made specifically to hide from all manners of things in the Echelon.
“I am Emmanuel Allen, as much as I am Castiel. Even if there was deception, I did not take you simply for my own amusement, nor to test anything. You did deserve to be saved. Now, and when we first met.”
Castiel nods as Dean gets his stuff and heads out, Castiel letting out a sigh as tries to keep his mind on straight. Whatever was going on, the priority was finding and stopping the Men of Letters. Everything else would come after that.
He remains with Uriel for as long as he can, writing up a quick report before sending it off in a simple spell. He changes and rests for the night, coming down the next day to find Naomi speaking to Miss Talbot, carrying a bag with a change of clothing.
“You rest, and let us help out. We stirred up the area by clearing out Fielkett, so we can take out the spirit while you relax a bit.” Uriel’s glare focuses on Dean but he complies, the servants and Mick helping him up to the prepared guest room while the others prepare to stay the night and protect the house. Dean oversaw as much of it as they could before the pain from the mark starts to get to them, Benny coming to help and hissing when he helps Dean out of their jacket and shirt. “Well, your sister is due for a visit.”
Bobby grunts in response as Dean gets what he needs – information, as well as some added items – before going back to his apartment. He quickly opens up the information box that the two had given him, and pull out the articles and news from the day. Walt and Roy were normally Hunters, so why would they need that motor? Bobby didn’t get a chance to look at it, and from what he can tell, neither did anyone else in the Hunting community. That meant that they were locked out of the deal…why? The motor was useful, but more than that, a Recycler down meant they could ransom it without puling a Seraph if they were
“Some view dances as a good time to learn more about one another,” Dean answers with a smile as they continue, “Though I’m surprised you initiated a conversation. Forgive me if that sounded rude, but you are not always one who seems to enjoy simple conversations.”
Millie feels a blush on their cheeks as they try to look away, frowning as they see the old, uncared for gravestones around them. “I didn’t realize there was a graveyard here. I thought it was elsewhere?”
Dean goes back to the study after lunch to finish up the correspondence, the first to Castiel, thanking him for sending Balthazar and offering some game, fishing, or something from the library since the stream hadn’t quite been filled yet, before mentioning that they may need help later. The one to Lady Bevell is far more curt, calling her out for writing out a letter to a failed Bunker, and that they will speak to all the others when they were perfectly ready and fine, considering what they were called at the last ton.
Castiel lets out a sigh as he takes the items, speaking to Naomi a bit more before she heads out, leaving Castiel to care for Uriel and try to deal with staying with the Smith family.
The world was once divided far more by one’s blood than by outward appearance, though that could be a factor as well. It had been a generation before the divide was set. In Utero - a live, unaltered Human - over In Vitro - one designed by the family, at cost, to fit the parent’s needs. The statistical probabilities of many genetic issues and diseases were taken down, but then...then things started to happen. Uteros lived longer than expected - when they were tracked, though the lack of such tracking resulted in the first of the Savagelands being created, outside of the Civilized cities. Vitros found themselves also having genetic instability at times, though at others, the smallest defect could mean taking away their chances, yet many others exceeded. The divide became harder and harder to hide, and even more difficult was the continued attempts to keep the In Vitro sciences alive, but failing as “chance” and nature took over instead.
Dean looks over at him, then shrugs. “Not soon. They want the meetup to be by nightfall.” Castiel considers the lie carefully. Dean’s lies were transparent now, but most of them were something that seemed to be geared towards protecting either himself, or whoever he was meeting. “It’s not going to be a big deal, Cas.”
The Dreadfuls were all dead, the new man looking tired as Dean patted his back, Michal Davies and Bela Talbot cleaning off their knives. The other servants, many already hardened from fighting the Dreadfuls out of Fielkett, were unharmed and untainted. Castiel walked forward, Dean Smith offering a strained smile before saying, “Sorry for ruining the party. We hoped they wouldn’t make a move like this, but I guess losing Fielkett and having wards put up will do that.”
Sam Winchester, the next Lord Winchester by right of being the firstborn living male, and heir of the Blessed Campbell legacy, was the glorified product of the union between the Lord John Winchester and Blessed Lady Mary Campbell. He’d gone through much, including being some sort of sought-after prize by a group of Fell-touched that had resulted in at least one death and the disfigurement of his mother in a fire. Still, he’d gone to learn law, and had come near-disownment after a supposed affair with Madame Ruby, though none could be sure. As of late, Sam rode with the Blessed Campbells, working to fight Dreadfuls that roamed the country. However, he also answered to Lord and Lady Bevell, two from the Men of Letters who were, overall, disliked for their rigid stance on all things, Angel or Dreadful.
“I’m beginning to think he might like a Smith, but only if they’re wearing a dress,” Bela grouses as they see Cas, Uriel, and Balthazar all nearby.
.” Dean offers a smile to them all, which only Samandiriel returns. Balthazar’s is far too close to a smirk, and neither Uriel nor Castiel cracks one.
Dean’s green eyes are a bit fearful, but he slowly nods before starting to sit up, wincing a bit as he does. “Fine. What’s the question?”
Balthazar finishes his own dances and arrives back to the group, after grabbing a goblet of wine and taking a long drink before asking Castiel, “So you met the new owners of Fielkett?” He smirks at the group. “Rumor has it that they’re only there until the Dreadfuls that got out of Fielkett are cared for. Not surprising, not for one who probably is employed by the Winchesters and Campbells.”
Well, he was going to do that anyway. At least he knows now that cutting off his arm is something he needs to do the moment he can.
“Oh, he’s Cas now?” the joke at least gets Dean to focus on something besides the pain - that was probably a main reason he’d not been the best host to Cas while he was here, and it definitely was the reason he’d avoided Balthazar’s strange knowing look and Samandiriel’s innocent one.
They speak to Dean only briefly after that before heading back. The next Fielkett ball had been moved back a few days, allowing time for everyone to prepare and to fully ensure the safety of others. Castiel is not surprised that Naomi is against going, but both Balthazar and Samandiriel are able to convince her to join them, though reluctantly.
“Avoidance, I’ve found, is sometimes the best,” he and she take another turn, “but what else can we do with things that are unpleasant?”
“That was the general consensus. Campbells rarely let their own leave their ranks, or tell their secrets, so being able to break a seal is quite a feat.”
“That’s why I didn’t want to come here,” Naomi states as she goes after a servant with drinks. The group move around with everyone, watching over everything and frowning when they see that Davies isn’t there, or if he is, he’s hiding quite well. Bela and Dean are working on speaking and the like, easily explaining away Miss Smith’s sudden need to head out, possibly with Davies helping her travel.
Dean scrubs himself down first before running the water, then doing it again. He’s lost his suit, the Walls are probably uninhabitable right now, and that bastard Seraph nearly got him
The irony of how entwined his life and the life of his alter ego, only needed to hide from the Seraph now giving him chase, is almost funny. Dean stays underwater as long as possible before having to come up for breath, and quickly running down the way that would take him to the next worse place. Composting is so vile that even a dip in the sewer was pleasant by comparison, but it was needed as well for the methane and for the new soil it created. The sewer air is vile but compared to the toxic mess he must rush and climb through, it’s almost pleasant. That the Seraph isn’t following him is worrying, but Dean’s sure it thinks he’ll come up somewhere that leads to the Scrapyard.
“No,” Castiel admits, finally looking at Sam Winchester fully, “because I understand Dean as he is now. If he allows me into his life, I can learn how he was. Beyond that, I would like for him to return with me to a home we both worked on, and I would like for him to remain with me there. If he wishes to continue his work as an Enforcer, that is for him to decide. If he decides to remain as a postal worker, then that is for him. If both, then I am fine. If neither, also fine. However, that is up to him to decide, and so long as we are compatible, I don’t see how that is anyone’s business but our own.”
Castiel cast Balthazar a glare as he considers, looking over at Uriel as he remains silent. It’s not until they get a chance to head outside and wander through their small garden path.
“I’ve heard,” Millie searches for any other subject to get onto and away from this one, “I saw you all in the village a few times when I went there. You all seem very much like you all know your strengths and weaknesses, though...the youngest, Samandiriel, seems...a bit quieter?”
, at least it’s well enough to make demands,” Balthazar snarks back, which results in Dean and he having to hold the two back before Dean said, “How about we have an exhibition? If we’re getting more Hunters and the like who are not always full of themselves, and your Angels obviously have a wish to learn as well. We can both see how the other works, and make things better for both sides, and better for the town.”
Bobby’s silence is enough to say they were dumb enough to leave the Walls. “Yeah, thought so. Anything else you’re calling to yell at me about?”
It’s enough to nearly make the situation comical, if it wasn’t for the dead Hunter or the tense nature with Lord Winchester there. Sir Adler, looking at the four waiting and appearing very upset before saying, “I believe we should all head over to my home, so we might speak on this and leave the constable to his work. Though the witnesses should remain here, of course.” The smile is one that Castiel had not seen in a while, since Sir Adler was fighting at the front line, and pledging himself to Michael’s Garrison before coming here. Then, he’d been far more dangerous and far less friendly. Granted, he’d cooled after arriving in Sandover, but seeing that look, he wonders how this will go, and hopes for the best for all of them.
“You look so beautiful like this,” Allen mutters against the crook of his neck, nipping at it briefly before he pulls back, enough to pull out something as one of his hands moves down and between his legs, briefly stroking Dean’s cock to fullness, hand already slick with something. He’s never been this sensitive, and so out of it that he can’t keep track of his partner. He’s surprised as he feels Allen start to push a finger in, moving them further onto the bed. Dean ends up letting go of Allen’s tie at this point, and still feels like he’s at a disadvantage. Even when Allen lets go of him to move him up, he’s still so aware of how his body is overly-sensitive to any of Allen’s touches.
“We all got the wards against possession on us,” Smith told him with a smile that was starting to look more and more forced by Castiel’s presence. Castiel wondered at it and simply tilted his head as Dean let out a sigh. “I understand the worry, but you needn’t bother yourself much with us. We can handle a few Dreadfuls and spirits.”
“Fine, fine.” The other man hands over the sealed item and he hands back the requested piece of equipment after making sure it had what he wanted. “If you don’t know already, that’s from the Second Tier,
that would hurt. He didn’t even want to think of how quickly he’d give in if it was any of them. If he’s not careful, though, Allen or someone else might come after him. He
“Sir,” Dean says when he sees him, getting Castiel to wish they were alone. “I…didn’t even call you.”
Calling from Castiel’s office isn’t the best idea, but Dean manages a few controls to keep things quiet, smiling the moment he hears Bobby’s voice until his annoyed voice registers.
“What did you tell her?” The accusation is enough to get Uriel to stop, looking up at the sky, while Castiel catched up to him. “I understand your dislike of her due to how she acts around Mister Davies, but--.”
Castiel sits near Dean, shifting to try to get himself put together, then glances over at him with a look of seriousness that Dean has come to recognize on the other man’s face. “We need to talk.”
Going to confront Bobby right now would put a lot of strain on his image, though…unless he did it in a neutral place. The problem was, Bobby wouldn’t go to a place like Benny’s cousin’s restaurant. If Bobby did know anything about it, why was he hiding it from Dean?
Mick’s silent a long moment before he says, “Ok. That might help out.” At Dean’s frown, he says, “Come to meet, have him follow or whatever needs, but don’t take any jobs. The main group has it out for Quicksilver - they think he might be dead, or the Seraphs have him tracked down.”
“So I gather,” Dean answered with a slight smile, glancing back at Fielkett. “I’m thinking of taking it, maybe setting up a few things, gift it to the community or some good couple who can use it well.”
Dean glances at Uriel, while Castiel waits, curious himself. “Bela gave me some of a rundown, but not a lot of it with how quickly things were going. I’m grateful to you all for helping her.” Dean offers them both a smile, and having seen his sister now, Castiel is beginning to see how similar the two can look. He’d not thought they were twins, but then again, seeing Dean now, after spending so much time seeing Miss Smith around, it’s very evident.
Dean offers a smile as they go to help the two up, hugging the girl close as she sobs. “If I could, I’d put up a shield like and not take it down either, not until you came around.” Castiel does his best to not blush. “Constables and Sir Adler will be here soon. Benny isn’t far, but he doesn’t like being chased by such men. If you can get in contact with Uriel, tell him and Mick to find him.”
“Smith,” Mick Davies walks up to him and smiles, putting an arm around his shoulder, “how are things going with you?”
“Wonderful! I’ll hold you to it,” Balthazar says with another smirk as Mick now makes his appearance, coming to show them to the carriage. Dean follows and makes sure the group has left before he glances over to Mick, who appears a bit flustered by their departure.
“Not when you ask like that, what the hell Red?” Seeing her smile, Dean groans and shakes his head. “It wasn’t that.”
Millie glances as Cas touches their arm briefly before the two twist and manage to get through an opening as more Dreadfuls appear, rushing as quickly as possible along the lane. Millie tries to break away to get back to Fielkett, but finds they can’t get through. Castiel quickly grips her hand and pulls her towards the Garrison’s own home, which is thankfully free of Dreadfuls. The grounds hold only one house, but is maintained with a huge wall, open field that Millie can feel holds a great deal of powerful sigils, and they manage to get into a hidden entrance easily and quickly as the Dreadfuls moan and scream behind them.
It was only just after the main rush of morning, but they find the area scented with blood soon enough. Samandiriel is shaking, hiding against a wall, hand stretched out to create a protective barrier around himself and the young woman, daughter to someone Benny had been protecting. Dean had only made it there a moment before, looking down at the dead body of Mister Creaser, sitting back on their heels with an obvious look of upset. Castiel glances back to Balthazar, saying, “Fetch a few others.”
Dean is quiet a long moment as they walk, finally letting out a breath before saying, “I’ll answer the question you brought up in such a condescending tone - Mr. Davies, while not of the gentry, was trained well in their mannerisms and can, when he wishes to, flawlessly work in any setting. He knows how to handle things, and despite it all, I do my best with what I know. Mr. Lafiette knows his own manners, and is far more a gentleman than you are in this case,
“How strange,” Castiel muses, “though all things considered, I’m not surprised one Hunter would know another. I’m more surprised they are so used to fighting amongst themselves.”
The physician nods. “If only so they can offer you both a room to stay and make accommodations. I doubt they’d want to have one upset and ill Angel here, without a garrison-mate with them.”
Miss Talbot gives him a smile as he notes that he doesn’t see anyone else there. “Ah, Castiel - how is Uriel doing today?”
The silence is a sign they might have one, which isn’t good for him. He picks up the pace at a straightaway, the various huge pillars that set up the Tiers above in contrast to the massive farmland, waste dump, and everything else that made up the lower area of the Echelons. The twisting Tiers that made up the huge pylons of Echelon only served to show the massive might of the power he was facing, but that didn’t slow him down or stop him.
estate,” Dean argues back as Benny and Mick examines the well-opening that was constructed quickly - signaling this estate was defended in another way before it all went down, “because someone went in and didn’t do their job? Just got whatever they wanted and ran? Freakin’ London chapter is all about savin’ the city and
Millie blinks at him, her green eyes so similar to that of her brother, but her quiet and look much more of a lady.
Castiel looks up as the resident physician knocks on the door, entering after Castiel allows him in and examining Uriel before stating, “The spirit’s attempts mean his power is working to fight off something like a cold, though the storm and foul weather contributed to his bad luck. I would say he should remain a few days, not simply to relax and refresh but also so his power can be checked for anything else. Clean water, heated over the fire, and some honey. Tea as well, if needed, mint if he catches a cough with the cold.” The physician examines Uriel a bit further before adding, “I’ve worked with a few Angels before, and though spirits are often no match for you, one that is able to get the drop on you can cause some issues. A few days rest, and I will be on call if you need me.”
“I believe that Quicksilver is not ‘clued in’ on what is going on,” he states, “since if he was, he might have taken more from the Recycler - instead, he only took the item requested, or at least what he believed to be the item needed. He also was far more surprised at my arrival, so he didn’t know that the part was that important.”
Castiel watches Dean move a bit slowly to the screen, worried he wore him out, though it could also be from the fight and everything else he did last night. “First would be your real name. I doubt you are actually named Dean Smith.”
“Oh...what luck...lookit who we found?” the half-decayed man nearly lost a jaw saying that. Milie leaves him little chance to continue the thought or conversation, knife easily cutting the head off as black energy sparks but fails to leave. They hear Cas say something in Enochian, others disappearing in a bright fire while Millie pivots, stabbing one of the other Dreadfuls and swiftly pulling out the knife when a familiar hellfire of unnatural orange-yellow color flow up before burning out. Millie sees the silver short-sword flash as Castiel uses it against a few other Dreadfuls that come after him, Millie quickly speaking out as much Latin as possible to get the rest of the spirits gone.
“A blessing on the home. While most of the Dreadfuls were killed yesterday, that doesn’t end their threat, and the fact that there are lesser spirits around could easily make any guests or dances we host later on dangerous, and I’m hoping to host one, if only to get to know the community we’re in.” He pets the horse, calming it. “Besides, I saw some of the sigils you set up in the hall during the dance. They were really good. Ain’t seen something that useful or powerful in a while.”
“If possible. If not, or if you can get a few with what Sinclair gave us, that might help as well. I’ll do my part in it.” Dean glances over to Bela and Mick before saying, “Bela...could you go and pick up my sister? I got a letter from her, about arriving from the Gale.”
” Uriel asks, sounding curious as the others wait. Castiel was put into Investigators for a reason, but so was Uriel, even though he worked mostly with Enforcers. The other man was good with scenes or taking care of low-level gangs, but things like this…patterns, possible motivations….
Allen smiles a bit at that, making him look almost kind, even as the hold remains on his tingling left arm. “Understandable. It will change things.” He shifts, so Dean is almost about to fall back on the bed. He’d got a few inches on the man, yet somehow he’s always felt like Allen is just that much more dangerous than he is, than anyone else, besides the Seraphs, that he’s seen. He’s smart, and able to notice the patterns in a way Dean can as well, but with other contexts that Dean doesn’t have, and it’s
“What the Dreadfuls said to Miss Smith while I was there. I wonder why they would try to find her, and have heard a few questions about how she was doing. Naomi also mentioned she noticed something that she had her own questions about, though she is still curious as to how the entrance here was opened.”
“And then you go and whip up something like this,” Benny mutters as they get him to the horses, “Should’ve banged him up a bit.”
After all, it had been Father and Mother’s love that had saved London on Hingham Bridge. The attack on Sam had given Mary Campbell-Winchester scars that would not allow her to fight as well as before. Father had trained Millie to know her place in the house, to be ready to fight and die for her brother, the heir to the Winchester fortune and presumptive leader of the alliance. Dean had met with a few men that Father had deemed worthy of their attention, and Dean had taken a shine to one of them - Gordon Walker was a good gentleman who knew his stuff and could easily become a fine Hunter. The work to defeat Azazel and Lilith had been long but rewarding, and it wasn’t until Dean admitted what happened - all of it - to Gordon that he showed his true self.
“Perhaps it’s not that,” Samandiriel said, “but perhaps the other man is upset over something else?”
The first is from Gordon, explaining he is coming to visit and speak to them on “various matters” - Dean wonders when, considering how old the letter seems to be. The next from Ellen Harville, stating her ‘disappointment’ in their ‘continued effort’ and blaming them for Jo’s “rebellion against all that is good for them” - Dean shakes their head at it, considering that Jo had always wanted to fight and defend things, and it was only her father’s death that resulted in Ellen trying to protect her.
Waiting on news from Benny means that they have time to plan, hire new people, and start to put more of the finishing touches on Fielkett itself. Millie just feels like a lot of it is that so many are trying to show off their best side to Millie, and also trying to figure out her place in everything.
Dean hates this. Some of it had been explained, and while telling the garrison had been an option, their first meeting had failed so greatly at that ball, and now with all of this, it was a wonder they weren’t already demanding answers. Bela had already mentioned they were asking about the seal - so was everyone else. Breaking a Campbell seal required you to
Sandover is huge, the building set up near the edge of the First Choir, covered with plants and trees to add to the aesthetic or something. Dean understands the reasoning - apparently, right before the Catastrophe, this wasn’t that common, and Mom had mentioned multiple buildings outside of the Echelon were simply buildings, not the huge things with flowing vines and intricate plants and the like. Dean recalls some of the Outland, and what he’d learned before they’d come into the Echelon again. Sammy had gotten upset overall he’d ‘missed out on’ but had helped however he could. Dean hadn’t been put into the same situation as Sammy, of course - the time and memories he had of the Outland, and his various little tricks and acts meant he couldn’t easily hide among anyone in the Tiers. Of course, Dean had been fine with that until Sammy had been sent out and then lost touch with them right after Dad died.
“When he...saved me…” Uriel grimaces in pain briefly, then smiles. “Bright...like Remiel...had been.”
The group do their best to track the Fell-touched, since the attacks by Dreadfuls and spirits appear to be suddenly raised and actively looking for the Smith group. The Smiths are almost dangerous in their defense of the town, as if trying to defeat the foe. Castiel and Uriel finds fighting with them almost invigorating, and Castiel sees many of the same tactics that Millie employed being used by Dean.
“Well, that was fun,” Dean mutters as they rub their neck, trying to massage their shoulders from a pain that goes beyond muscle and into their bones. “I’m glad he’s recovered, though, and we dealt with that spirit.”
“In that case...perhaps the Centre is not best for him at the moment. Empyrean would like for him to have some sense of justice, and unless he wishes to speak on behalf of himself, in front of a Judge and others, he may need to wait. I know this might not be what he wants...but it is already in motion. You may also be wary. My own inquiries might result in Hunters coming this way. If so, please call upon us. My brother, Uriel, owes Dean a debt.”
Dean moves away, but nods. “Yeah. At least then I’ll have something I can say is me, not just something I was pushed into.”
“I am Castiel, leader of the Angel Garrison of Sandover. I believe I know the next Lord Winchester, but I am uncertain of the man with you.”
Dean nods, since it does appear any carpentry stuff is fixed, but the rest is a bit shoddy, and some of it might need to be redone. They go through the different rooms, Dean making mental notes as the dark-haired man asks him about a few things but overall is fairly quiet, apparently content to watch him before he gets back to the front room and looks at him.
“So the last lord of Fielkett told us, and he didn’t exactly prosper either,” Castiel points out, noting the others looking worried, only Michal Davies appearing ready for more fight as Dean Smith looks over at him. They had done a bang-up job at taking out the Dreadfuls, but also didn’t seem interested in help. Castiel isn’t too surprised by a hunter group who’d take an estate after clearing it. He hears Uriel come out near him, sees Davies move a bit closer before Smith tells them, “Easy, Mick. We’re not beetle-headed here. Castiel, whatever the last Lord did or didn’t do, that ain’t us. Your wings ain’t out, so I doubt you’re bird-witted enough to try it, either of you.”
, and had enjoyed the attention as much as possible, but also disliked how quickly things had gone to small mentions of how
"Dean Winchester’s Placement was not a straightforward one, at least according to the Interpreter they brought in to speak to him about it after his Evaluation was all done. "
“You know the price,” the runner says, his voice rough from the run. “You didn’t mention that it was big enough to pull a
“Looks like rain,” Bela mutters as they start to ride back. Sir Adler and the others had hosted them for a good part of the day while Dean asked about ways to keep a house relatively safe during a ball. The noise tended to attract any Dreadfuls, spirits, or Fell-touched in the area. Adler and the families had been happy to give them a lot of useless noise and banter, and just as willing to start cooing and aweing over Impala. The whole night had resulted in Dean leaving with simply offers to stud Impala, a few less-than-useful hints about how best to host a party without allowing in too many dangers through the gates, and a heavy annoyance at all the extra parts they had to play, now that the hint of one was out in the community. Rain was, oddly enough, simply another part of that already dismal day.
“What if the reports are wrong? Created wrong, or...or anything else? What if all of that is wrong?”
The vulgar word makes Castiel glare at Dean. He wants to take him again, make up for all the time between the mark and now, but that isn’t why he’s here. If he’s able, he may even integrate Dean in, stop his actions, and make him a proud member of the Echelon instead of…whatever he really is.
They started by dividing up what needed to be done, though Dean found himself discovering new bits of the house that needed repair with each time, while Castiel appeared more and more inclined to believe Dean’s assessment that while they tried, it was not quite good enough for the house repairs. The day wears by quickly, and before Dean knows it, the sun is setting on the area as Castiel looks over at Dean. “Ah, it’s getting quite late.”
Mick glances at Dean, who’s looking paler than normal, as they let out a sad breath. “That might work, but it’ll be dangerous, Benny.”
“She was fairly upset by the arrival of the Hunters. I’m more surprised they don’t have anyone to recruit here.”
Benny chuckles. “Sounds right, but this time he did pull one. Whatever they paid him to get, must’ve been hot.”
Dean is silently grateful that he knows these areas so well. Slipping into the maintenance shaft and sliding down quickly, he’s also grateful that the Seraphs took so long to get information out of Walt and Roy.
Sam had to know that Dean was looking for him, and even this high up in the Tiers, he could call Bobby or someone. He knew how. He’d survived Cold Oaks, and now he was…what was he doing up in the First Choir?
“I did not,” Castiel admits, “though I doubt that is all you are so worried about.” Davies bows to the Smith sister at the end, Castiel noting a few other items in her dress - the sides were cut, allowing freedom of movement, and she’d danced very well with any who introduced themselves to the group. “If you are so upset by her presence, I suppose we will not have a dance with her?”
Castiel nods in acknowledgment. He doubted it would be so easy, but that someone is acting as a mediator at least helps out. “Then...he’s alright?”
“I’m not here to demand a person. I was hoping to speak to Dean, if he’s up for it. If you wish, I can remain here, or go into the house. No one will leave with me without their consent.” The man relaxes a bit, his thick glasses and gray mustache contrasting with the long hair tied back in a ponytail before he tells Castiel, “Are you the one who helped him out for the month?”
“It’s a dress store,” Samandiriel tells her finally, “and we were hoping to find something nice for Naomi.”
“I know. But that doesn’t stop me from hating it, and him, and all that lead us here. I wish I could focus more.” She sniffs. “I’m no use to you like this.”
“I...sure.” He motions to Dean to follow him, the two walking over to the door as Dean spots more and more signs that despite how weathered the outside and porch look, the actual inside might not need that much. He pauses, touching one of the wood-carvings nearby before the man said, “I know that we are from the City, but we also believe in having...practical skills.”
Millie’s mind goes back to the recent ball. They’d gotten a lot of good information, especially concerning the sour taste that Creaser had left in everyone’s mouth from town, but a lot more was a strange feeling that their actions and appearance was accepted far more than Dean’s ever was. Millie knew how to act as a
Naomi had been surprised and amazed. Samandiriel had congratulated the woman happily. Balthazar had looked at her with a look that could be disdain for it, and
“US?” Dean asks, stopping as they sees Mick standing there, holding up the very disgruntled, wet, and
“Dean, you’ll tell me if something is bothering you,” Allen mutters, moving closer as Dean sits down heavily on the bed, now looking up at him. He realizes that Allen’s still holding his left arm, and unlike Dean, he’s very,
He listens for any sign of struggle, but upon hearing none, he heads back to the stairs and slowly walks down. Reaching the bottom, he pauses when he sees Dean untying two men, one an older male with a graying beard, the other a younger man with a heavy head of long hair who appears to have been tormented. Nearby, a woman lays unconscious.
The apartment is a bit bigger than his last one, but Dean still sneaks in through the bathroom window, walking out slowly into the bedroom and looking around for any sign.
“Of course,” the woman said with her head held high, a confident smile on her face, “Name the time and weapon, and I’ll put you on your winged behind again,
, and they wouldn’t give it up and be on the run again. Not because of scandal, and not because of who they were.
“Of course not,” Davies says as he takes the reins of their horses, glancing around the small group before Bela raises her hand - it was her turn to be the rear guard. “You expected them to have information?”
“That will be hard, as we are all neighbors. I’m sure you all can be cordial with each other when my brother returns.”
Uriel glares at her before letting out a huff and walking off, Samandiriel following him as Meg glances to Castiel. “What made you so upset with the dear family Smith?”
“I suppose, but at one point I may also be caring for a household. No reason to not learn the ropes.” Millie gives Castiel a smile as they walk. “What about you? Are you here for any specific reason?”
“A hard time sleeping,” Mick asks as they get a bit further away, “sounds pretty bad. I heard a few people had that earlier too. One was hoping to find his brother and see if he could get some help.” Dean stops, glancing at Mick as he offers a wry smile. “I couldn’t be sure until today and didn’t get a chance to talk to you.”
Dean smiles as he shrugs. “Well, Allen’s got some stuff to do, and gave me the day off. I got some errands to run, and wanted to check out the Queue, see if there’s anything for me to try.” It was part of the job that Dean liked – helping people that couldn’t get into some of the Investigators, working with people who needed the help. Even when he looked for Sam and tried to get anything on him, he found himself drawn to the Queue and the work there.
she was at hosting things than Dean had been, how long would she stay over her brother, and then also if she was as strong a fighter as her brother, or if not, perhaps she would like to have someone care for her. So like with Castiel’s painfully strange dance request, or Uriel’s continued angry glares at Mick, or any of the other weirdness going on with the Angels or the rest of the town, they’d held their tongue.
Castiel raised his eyebrows at that, surprised at the list. “I’m amazed at you knowing six such women, as I’ve never known anyone in these times to manage both being highly refined
“It’s alright,” Miss Smith says, offering them a bit of a smile that seems forced. Davies sighs as he continues, “May I introduce Dean Smith’s sister, Millie Smith. Millie, this is the Angelic Garrison who are stationed here. I believe Dean mentioned them when you both met on the road here?” Millie Smith smiles at the group, giving a single curtsey to them before Castiel manages to ask, “If you are free, perhaps I might have a dance? Unless Balthazar or the others have filled your card.”
Dean finds the panel he was looking for, helping to control the inner Walls and keep them safe in case of invaders or something else, and throws every switch, pushes every button, then pulls it off before getting out. The sheer cacophony of sounds is so deafening he nearly doesn’t see the third Seraph, the one he was dreading to run into.
“I’m sure an apology to my sister will cover it all,” the interruption gets both to turn, Dean Smith offering them a far easier smile than normal, though he obviously was still upset over whatever he thought. “Forgive the interruption. I was passing through and hear something like someone in pain. I wanted to make sure it was no extra danger, especially not so close to your Garrison.” He offers both of them a smile. “You’ve both been helping us all out in the past few days, especially with the sudden Dreadfuls coming in. I do apologize if in all of that, the first impression we both got of one another was wrong.”
Dean’s smile doesn’t falter, but it seems to subtly change a bit. “Of course. I believe I met him at the dance. Would you like me to send over an official letter?”
The motor probably was going to be used to create or keep the holes in the exterior Walls weak or open, which was why they needed a newer motor and technology. Without that, they would have to use more violent methods, or contact others to come and attack. After the last attack, and the upgrades to Michael’s army, the only way they would be able to attack the Echelon from the Outlands would be using another Echelon.
Millie held up a hand. “Being proper while Dreadfuls are about is an easy way to create more trouble than we should have. I am fine with being checked over by the lady of the house, or the servant charged with it.” Naomi directs her easily away as Uriel comes down at the commotion. Balthazar makes some lewd comment. Millie does their best to ignore it as Naomi and a servant woman check her clothing, weapons, and then her skin for any signs of possession or being bitten by the Dreadful. The moment Naomi moves her dress enough to see the anti-possession tattoo over her left breast, Naomi pauses and continues to examine other things, though not for possession obviously. When they pull to look at their back, Millie hears Naomi cluck her tongue in annoyance.
The man nods as Castiel gets back into his car, driving away and back to his house. The place is empty without Dean, emptier still due to everyone being in town still and working to see what they can do. He wishes there was a better way of doing this, or a way to do this that would have Dean here. Still, knowing he’s safe and sound is a far better thought than having to worry about where he might be, and what his safety is.
“They are trying to get more people. The last time they attempted to gain power like this, they worked in a way that resulted in their near extinction, with a few managing to hide or escape justice in some way. It’s likely that they also might be using you to control another person in their organization. They tend to do that as well at times.”
That despite everything Dean had once suffered, they trust Castiel so fully with not just all they wrote, shows Dean that in a way, they want Castiel to accept them and for their worry to be proven wrong, even this once. That Castiel finds them during a ride two days later and simply asks a few questions - the nature of the rune, and if he might allow the Garrison to know and help protect that secret - makes Dean feel like they finally found someone to confide in. Though they aren’t sure about allowing the Garrison to know, since Naomi was haughty even to Millie, and Balthazar being...himself....
Dean’s amazed that despite the interruption and... everything...that he’s still able to get to work pretty much on-time. Benny, Mick, and Charlie also look at him oddly as he gets something to eat, though he’s sore from yesterday and what happened this morning.
Bela Talbot spoke up from where she sat. “We found traces of it this morning, and are working to finish it off. The local areas are well protected, at least, and it showed signs of being a bit...rash...in its attacks. Mister Davies is on its trail right now, along with a few others from nearby.”
“You sound rather grateful for that as well,” Castiel mutters as he finds a bracelet in Mick’s pocket. “I take it the others are all in there.”
“So, the good news is that it’s not as bad as I thought. The bad news is that you tried, but it’s still pretty rotten.”
The Dreadfuls had been easy enough, but numerous enough to cause trouble. Benny had gotten tossed by one violent one, meaning he’d been sent ahead. Mick glares over at where the owner of the voice stands next to the chestnut gelding. The eight outnumbering their group and all with their guns and swords ready. Bela stands next to her own mare, and Benny is between the two, looking even worse for wear than before. The speaker is close to Benny, enough that both Mick and Dean hold up their hands as Dean moves forward, managing to get between the two as Mick moves slowly to help him.
He’s not sure how much of that Dean believes, but he does look up staring up at Castiel for long enough that the Seraph has to break physical contact in order to make his meeting on time. Uriel is smirking a bit when he sees him, looking almost proud of himself. “So, how is your paramour?”
“Yeah. There’s a lot of them that’d work out for this - chickens, ducks, even some geese, though they can be jerks. It’ll be good for fresh eggs too, if you like that.”
Meg shrugs, noticing some of the maids coming over. “I need to get back to work, it seems. You have a lovely, rumor-free day.”
Dean Smith nods, still petting the horse, then says, “Well, thank you for the advice and talk, then. I do hope you both have a good rest of your day. Castiel, Miss Masters.” He tips his hat again before turning to ride off.
“I see.” He does, of course. Though there were drones and automated delivery systems in Cities and more Civilized towns, the areas like this near Savagelands or in rural Civilized areas tended towards humans as opposed to robotic ones. Most of this reason was due to having humans checking on live animals and their well-being, but also with ensuring that packages with said live-animals were not hurt by robots that might malfunction. An area so close to Savagelands would definitely have someone like Dean Winchester working in this area, far enough out from the Centre that it would cause some trouble for Enforcers of any group to come out here to get him back there.
Allen shoots Ward a look as Dean blinks, confused by this as fear rises, realizing what this means that the two are here. If they were out with the Seraph, like most good Investigators and Enforcers, they were coming after
The Empyrean group’s main focus of their help was to focus on the “vessel”, the person themselves, over competitors’ push to make the
“My sister isn’t going by her real name while she’s here. She’s been called by our father to return to witness my marriage, and we received a letter from her, stating she was not leaving here, spouting some nonsense about being the ‘lady’ of the estate, that she’s already being courted!” Castiel winced at that last part, and how loud things he was. “Father wasn’t able to travel, and Mother was too upset to travel, so we have come here to make sure she’d not be put under some spell or illusion, that your Garrison had not pulled her into something immoral.”
The days between when Dean will return and the ball dwindle fast, in some ways too fast for Millie to really feel comfortable with. The Angels are at least starting to get closer, especially Uriel. The others come by from time to time as well, enough that Millie is on good terms with Samandiriel to a point, is less annoyed with Balthazar, though not by much. Naomi, though, was still as rude with Millie as she’d been with Dean, so they figured she was simply that way.
“A rune for transformation and protection, I was told,” Millie sees no reason to lie about it. They either knew it or didn’t. “It didn’t like the wards Balthazar put up, originally, but we’ve come with a work around.”
Bela blinks as a servant comes in to offer some more wine, and she nods with a tight smile. “Of course. I can’t wait to see her again. Are the others coming?”
“How’re things with the big man, brother?” Benny asks as they sit, Charlie and a few others coming to get some quick breakfast with him.
Castiel doesn’t mention going to his home either, so either Ward and he are covering to keep Dean in their pocket too, or there’s something he’s missing. Between this and what Mick said, if he lets his mind wander too much, he starts to get worried about what he wants to do. Mick will get him to Sammy, but if he runs, he’ll have to deal with Castiel and the Seraphs. If he gets Castiel’s help with this, though…could that work?
The old man glares at him hard before saying, “If you think you’ve got some sort of claim to him, you’re wrong.”
Dean frowns, as if he’s uncertain of what else to say. “You said they were testing me, but the question still remains of why.”
Due to a few issues and attacks against others in the town, talks are had again, but with less amicable endings.
The youngest Angel swallows, shaking, as he looks at Castiel with not so much fear, but obvious need. Castiel moves to touch the barrier, making it drop, as Samandiriel slumps, obvious fatigue hitting him. “He’s good with protection, but our good and sweet Angel is very poor with having it be let down, save by the leader of his Garrison. Forgive us for making it look as if you and the others weren’t trusted.”
Castiel smiles at that, nodding in agreement. “I understand that sentiment. Though much of the Garrisons wished to stay where they were created, and many have had to change and move, we are still happy with where we have landed, so to speak. Naomi may be curt, but she loves her work, even if she dislikes the pomp. Balthazar might thrive in a city, or he might find himself too distracted by other things. Samandiriel is simply...good, I suspect too good, to really wish to leave here. Uriel and myself are not the oldest, but we are the ones who, it appears, have most cause to wish for you and yours to remain at Fielkett.” Dean does their best to not blush at that, looking down as they realize how close they are to Castiel, and how, despite it all, the Angel is making them more and more at ease in a way only a few had before.
Castiel finds things calming down in Sandover, and more are starting to move back into the cleared homes. Bela moves into one from Fielkett - mostly to remain close to Sandover, but it’s between Fielkett and the town, allowing Bela time to visit both Meg and the others in Fielkett. Dean doesn’t seem to mind, and if anything is obviously happy that other homes are open.
“What Naomi can give me, a timeline, and whatever else you can think of. Perhaps my own room, but a wall or board will be good enough. I have a few things to think about.”
Castiel is quiet at that, wondering what had brought on Mr. Smith’s strange attitudes, before going back to speak to a few others. Meg smiles when he approaches her, walking over to say, “My, you and the Smith twins make quite the talk of any ball. I think if Uriel had actually spoken a nice word towards Mr. Davies, he might have had the same attention given to them.”
“We were, however the family that originally owned Fielkett were not...friendly...with us. And they had called in a Hunter from the Campbell family, who stopped our advance. By the time we were even able to get close, the entrance not full of Dreadfuls was sealed off. One of my Garrison wonders how your brother and his group even got in.”
Dean glances at the clock, Benny chuckling as he says, “It’s a few minutes, but it’s enough to worry. You do also look...well, different.”
The tall man huffs for breath as he runs down the wet streets, keeping to the shadows as the men behind him shout and stumble after him. The scheduled rain for this part of the agricultural sector makes it harder for him to follow as he cuts between tiered vertical shelves and shifts to grab hold of one, riding it up to get better access to a few rooftops nearby. He jumps easily, rushing over the roofs and landing semi-gracefully before taking off again.
“Careful with that language,” Dean told him again as they got on their horses. There was still daylight, and a doctor in the main town, along with the lord in the area. Since Angels had been nearby, there was probably a garrison stocked up, and they’d know what else to do with the house.
Dean relaxes as Castiel moves to secure the unconscious woman, sitting back as he hears the others outside. “Seraphs may be called due to the nature of this place. We should leave soon if you do not want to be met by them.”
happy, as a means of creating more perfect and happier beings overall. They admitted to flaws and other changes - Castiel had his own issues that made some see him as ‘abnormal’, but his Placement into Empyrean had resulted in him being overall happy and content. Uriel’s abrasiveness had been tempered by Castiel’s own attitude, and the event that had tested their friendship further tempered that abrasive and cold attitude to one moving towards more understanding.
“He should be, since Castiel gave him that mark,” Uriel points out, though something in Castiel’s posture obviously makes him glance over at him. “What is it?”
The tone gets Millie to look over at Uriel, confused and slowing the horses so they can speak. Uriel’s eyes are bright with power, and Millie thinks there’s a bit of a blush on his cheeks, but that thought stops as he leans forward and says, “You should stop being so close to Castiel. He would never take up ties with you when your brother is so callous and can’t even admit to being in the pockets of the Campbells.”
Allen’s high enough to speak to the Seraphs, though if he knows who they are, he’s quiet about it. “
“Dunno how quick that is,” he mutters, “It’s been a few since I’ve seen him.” He sees some news about the pulling a Seraph to the Garden, as well as the notices about the Recycler being down for a bit. He frowns as he considers that before saying, “I’ll talk later, ok? I got to run a few errands.”
“I don’t believe the mark did more than make him sensitive to our presence. He’s been able to avoid us before Perdition, and after, at the same rate. However, this last theft was even worrisome to him in a way. He claims that he even explained to the two who we caught about my arrival and believed they would be able to avoid my presence. The others in the Walls like him avoided us, but the Hunters we caught went out of their way to cause trouble…why?”
Castiel nods in agreement as the windows and door burst open. He pulls out the silver-colored blade that all Angels carry, making the motion to activate the sigils in the area, taking out Dreadfuls while Uriel and Balthazar fight. Naomi and Samandiriel help to get others to escape while aiding in defending the exit, using polearms and other weapons available to them. It was over in a short period of time, the dead quickly checked and moved to one end of the room so they could be burned outside. Castiel easily heads out to where the new group has gone, finding them exactly where he expected, though he’s surprised by the state of things as well.
That was probably the worst thing about all of this. The year of looking for Sam, of trying to find out if he was ok, all of that was Sam and Bobby’s idea, to get him to show off so that he could see how ‘bad’ things were, how they had to change, how the Tiers were the worst. Of course, after getting their butts tormented until that woman let them take Dean’s phone call and directed him as the Men of Letters wanted.
It’s not something that Dean likes to think about. They get even more upset at each verbal sparring they get into with Castiel, often set off by simple observation or something similar. Benny had already called Dean on it a day or two after Dean had mentioned Father’s list, and Castiel had voiced his issues with it, and Dean had not argued his points. Before all of this, Dean would’ve defended every bit of the list, with steel if need be, but….
It’s still strange to see himself in such a uniform. Dad would have a heart attack if he saw him dressed up as the secretary to a Second Tier Investigator. The burgundy suit-jacket covers the black vest and a silver watch, with the pressed dark pants and sensible, comfortable shoes. By the time he’s out and grabs something quick to eat, so he’s not shaking by the time he’s at work, he’s right on time to reach the office, and act as Dean Smith.
“Then you should go home and rest up. I’m not sure how close the case is to here, and I’d hate for you to run into any distractions.”
“I’d rather not, at least not until I’m established, but at this point apparently everyone thinks I’m rude.” Benny chuckles at that as he helps Dean with more preparation for the night and then heads out. Dean looks at themself in the mirror, sighing at the sight before them. No matter what the sigil did, they were themself - Dean or….
“It’s safe enough,” Dean argues, though they don’t feel like that’s actually true. The claim to the house is pretty set, and while they could probably get used to the sigil that Balthazar put up, it’s likely that Mick noticed them starting to be in pain. “At the same time, I want to solidify our hold at least. I’d hate to run away from this place.”
Castiel frowns at that one, a bit confused by Dean’s mention of family. “No, though you and your sister appear close enough that I would think you value some of that belief.”
Meg shakes her head, saying, “Yes, well, he’s also abrasive. I doubt Mr. Davies would believe that he enjoys the man’s company.”
have you done?” the loud voice echoes, causing both to look over. Lord Winchester gets off his horse, anger in his face, as Master Singer dismounts as well. “What did you allow to happen to Martin, Millie?”
Millie begins to find the walks useful, especially after they worked to keep Fielkett running, and was trying to get ready for when Dean arrives and they head out to...somewhere else. Maybe this time they’ll go on some long travel...on their own….
“You’re so lovely, even when,” Allen’s hand moves to fix perfectly on the print left behind by the Seraph, “you lie to me.”
Shaking, adrenaline pushing him forward as the building static echoes through his head, he twists and rushes, picking the straight line to the vent that the Seraphim won’t follow him into, leaping over obstacles and using his momentum to keep going, hearing the thing taking a parallel path, though it sounds like it’s above him.
“Ah, and here they are - our Angels.” Sir Zachariah Adler smiles as he waves to them, the group bowing - Naomi gives a half-hearted curtsy to the group as they return the bows and curtsies as well. “They’re part of the Angel garrison stationed here.”
Dean Winchester would’ve jumped at the chance for pie, but Dean Smith… “I can’t, not without paying for it later. You want me to give up all my hard work to keep healthy?”
Uriel grips tighter onto Mick, who motions to the servant to help as he holds up the Angel. Dean checked on the wound, though the Angel seems ready to show off his wings if they got too close. Dean backs off and instead helps Mick, helping him dry off while also checking for any signs of him being hurt as well. Bela, who came in later than Dean and the others, looks over at the group with some confusion that Mick quickly catches.
Castiel looks over at Dean, confused, then shakes his head. Dean doesn’t seem too upset as the group goes back to the game, though one of them seems to glare at him. Castiel ignores it, and finds a book he hadn’t read before moving to look for another, so he wouldn’t have to look for anything else.
Dean finishes their own search of the home, coming up empty for the Aquarian star that denoted any sort of link to the Men of Letters, let alone a simple pentagram to protect areas. The same was true for all the possible hidden ways in or out - that certainly explained why so many had died or been infected here. They see some areas that could work for a path out, but they’ll need to get the plans first, and once more call upon the Angels for their help.
He bows and kisses her hand before heading out on his own, leaving Meg to wonder more and more about the mysterious Smith party and their past.
on the one who ruined my worth.” Millie lets out a breath as they pull their hair with a brush, flinching a bit at the pain, then sighing before putting the brush back down. “Now I’m talking to myself. Of course.” With another small huff, the lone candle in the room goes out, and Millie lets out another breath to calm down. They had enough to throw a ball, announcing Dean’s grand return and Millie’s casual departure. Millie doubted that the whole thing would go over as well as they would like, but at this point. What else was there to do?
“If it’s alright, I’d like to also see Uriel, and drop off these things for them both during their stay. We’ll also have to thank you for the help with the spirit.”
“That’s the worry. I was told to come with one of the guys, but he’s not the one they told me to go with.” That did perk Castiel’s interest and worry. If Dean was normally nice around Mick Davies, and instead they picked Ketch….
Knowing Dean Smith had a sister at least made sense for how he acted, though Castiel wonders if he viewed all women by such a strict list that he quoted, or if he simply heard it and mentioned it to show the strict ideals of his family. Either way, it wasn’t something that Castiel could see anyone, female or male, able to reach. Could anyone live up to that?
“I wanted to make sure you were doing alright,” Mick says, some of his lower-class lit starting to come up a bit more. “This whole thing is a bit dangerous.”
The thought gets Millie to huff a bit as her mind now moves to the reactions of everyone at her introduction. Sandover had been a lovely, if stiff, town when Dean was around, but with Millie, they all seemed happy to explain how
Dean also finishes up a few other letters to others who’ve helped them out, before hearing Mick clearing his throat from the doorway. Dean glances over at him, offering up a smile. “What’s going on, Mick?”
“Not as big as the case we had to build against Zachariah?” Dean seems to catch on he’s been caught in a lie, but also looks a bit grateful at the mention.
Dean returns Castiel’s glance, taking a drink before answering, though it sounded more like they were reciting something for a teacher or governess over making conversation, “A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages. That she must be well-trained enough in the family fighting style, as well as well versed in the weapons and tactics of modern Europe. I knew of six who could be so-called accomplished.”
“This is getting serious,” Dean mutters as he listens to the information through the local radio station right before the weather. “I didn’t think this would be that serious.”
The voice who picks up the phone is one he’d not heard in two years, but it makes him freeze all the same, even as a bit of worry lifts from his mind.
“He’s the one I was looking for,” Castiel says simply, getting Balthazar to make a disgusted look as Hannah pouts. Naomi calls for quiet before saying, “
If he’s honest, Castiel almost doesn’t want Dean to go after whoever he’s searching for. Still, when he gets back from the meeting and talks about what the Men of Letters might be planning, he’s surprised to see Dean still there, leaning against his desk and looking almost defeated. He closes the door quietly, walking up slowly and looking over at him to figure out what was going on.
Bela shakes her head, more at the start of their preaching over anything, before stating for Dean as they mutter a spell to release the seal, “Which is why we’re getting Fielkett. A nest here will only add to the problems overall, and the Angels will lose another township if we don’t handle it. Angels lose, we lose, no matter what London says.”
. He’ll have to stay as Dean Smith now until this blows over, if it does, and what good is that? Sammy’s up at the First Choir, and if Dean’s not careful, they’ll be onto him as well.
The supposed Hunter soon leaves, though not before making himself a supposed nuisance before finally disappearing. None of the Angels had run into the Hunter, and Meg had avoided the man after he’d thrown some abuse at her and a servant. It hadn’t been a long time after that when Fielkett had sent out invitations to a ball, which Balthazar had smirked about upon reading it. “Apparently, though Mister Smith won’t be there, his sister hopes to entertain us, as she’ll be spending some time there as well.”
Cleaning and fixing the house only seems to bring out more of both Dean’s and the house’s original beauty. The chuckle and questions that Dean asks him comes up at the same time that Castiel discovers the dusty, frosted glass for the back door have some very pretty designs that create various rainbow designs on the nearby walls. Another time, when Dean mentions having a younger brother he sounds proud of, Castiel and Dean discover a good piece of wood to use to make into a headboard out in the dusty garage. When Dean asks again to stay on the couch for the night, starting in the second week of work, Castiel finally nods.
Castiel stands and picks up his coat. “I believe you were ‘played’ by the Men of Letters, or at least tested. The issue is that I can’t be sure what that test entailed fully. The Hunters were set up to have us attack them, possibly to create more strife, but the problem is that most of those you warned left, and the ones we pick up are tracked to where they go. This isn’t like their attempted coup a few generations ago.”
“Martin Creaser checked into the Inn,” Bela tells them, getting Benny to glance at her in nervous fear. Dean looks at her in equal fear as she mentions it. “He didn’t see me.”
Cas nods, getting Millie to let out a mental sigh of relief before continuing on, changing the subject, “I also heard my brother hosted you and another Angel for a short bit, when they were recovering?”
The woman looks upset at the thought, but nods after a long moment where they look at Dean. Castiel wonders if she wants something similar to Dean’s look and style. It wouldn’t be surprising, though he almost wishes that Dean would wear their hair long and similar to how they tended to while Millie. Castiel suspects because they simply like the look, enjoy watching Dean or Millie appear as graceful yet deadly, dangerous in a way of a beautiful predator.
Naomi glares at them, but drops it as Uriel comes up and says, “I will go with Miss Smith back to Fielkett, then. I am known for dealing with larger groups easily, though the area could get...devastated.” Millie blinks at this, then nods in agreement as Balthazar says in almost happiness, “Well, now that that’s set up, we can start to deal with the ones that tried to get past our wards. Samandiriel, Cassie, let’s go!”
Dean smiles at her as they ride in the direction of Sandover. “For the time being, yes. After all, we’re not about to let those last few Dreadfuls play, and honestly, that was a very nice library.”
Uriel mutters in annoyance as Balthazar barely holds in a laugh, going off to bother Miss Talbot as Castiel sighs.
