“Exactly that.  Fake it. Pretend to have faith.  At least for a little while.  Sometimes you have to.”
“Lasagna is like a pasta casserole thing with cheese and tomato sauce,” explained Sam, well aware that this description would mean very little to Jack.  “And Jody is a friend of ours.  She’s kind of like a mom to Dean and me.”
“Line one on my resume, buddy.” Jody’s unflagging grin was doing wonders for Sam’s state of mind. He’d called her two days ago, desperate, overwhelmed and in a panic that he found himself responsible for this entirely bizarre creature and that his brother, his rock, the unbreakable action hero that had raised him was in fact, broken. Shattered actually, by a pain that he could not handle. Sam had never seen him quite like this. Dean had never been great with emotional pain. Generally he seemed to process everything through anger and varying stages of alcoholism. And truthfully, after losing their mom and Cas and Crowley, Sam had expected Dean’s trademarked rage. And Dean had not disappointed. The search for Jack after that horrible night had gone pretty much the way Sam had expected. Dean had been his usual taciturn, overly controlled self. White knuckling the steering wheel of the Impala, mouth set in a straight, unforgiving line, the picture of grim determination. His focus on killing Jack had been unwavering. Sam sighed, remembering the waves of pain he’d felt pouring off of Dean.
“Okay,” Sam acquiesced.  “But why is it so hard? I’ve seen you throw people across the room.  I’ve been thrown across the room by you.  I’ve seen you open a Gate to Hell.  And now nothing? It doesn’t make any sense.”
“Jack, listen,” Sam crouched down next to him.  “Asmodeus tricking you, Dean… None of that is your fault.  I think that after everything that’s happened, you’re probably scared to use your power.  And me pressuring you certainly isn’t helping.”
Maybe Sam was lying to him, Dean thought as he looked around the pathetic, crappy interior of the Clamdiver, because there is no way anybody gave this shithole four stars on any website anywhere. The shitty half busted lights, the threadbare velvet couches, the way the stage sagged noticeably in the middle, the pole slightly askew.  It was all just desperately, terribly
The skinny redheaded trailed her fingers down his arm and grabbed him by the hand leading him to one of the shabby couches.  Before he knew it, she’d pushed him down onto it and was climbing onto his lap.  He tried to enjoy the dance.  He really did. He tried to let his mind go blank and just lose himself in her soft skin and baby powder scent but he just couldn’t.
Oh it was a mistake.  Dean knew it as soon as he heard those words.  Something hard and painful welled up in his throat and the road before him became a blur.  Dean gasped and pressed a hand to his chest in a weak attempt to calm his panicked breath.  Shakily he pulled the Impala to the side of the road and put in in park.  The hard and painful thing in his throat seemed to be spreading.  Now he could feel it in his jaw and behind his eyes. He wrenched the door open and leaned far out, bracing himself on the door handle.  Dean retched hard, his stomach spasming as he coughed bile onto the gravel spread along the ground. Behind him the music was unrelenting.
“And maybe he should,” Jack continued, “Mom said I could be good, that I had the choice to be good.  That it was up to me. But she’s dead because of me.  I’ve only been on Earth for a few days and I’ve already hurt people.  I’ve already done bad things. And no matter how hard I try, I can’t do the one good stupid thing you want me to.  So I must be evil.  Like Lucifer.”
“The words,” Cas replied with a smile. Then he leaned forward touching his forehead to Dean’s gently and sang quietly, never breaking eye contact, “If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you.  When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me.”
The first thing that struck him was how bright it was.  The startling brightness was so completely different from the strange, inky darkness of the Empty that Cas was momentarily dizzy.  He lay motionless, just feeling the warmth of the sun touching his skin, the press of plants and lumps of soil against his back.  He smiled to himself.  He was back.  He’d won. His long fingers dug into the earth and he reveled in the feel of it. Still smiling, he pushed himself to his feet.  He seemed to be in some sort of field.  Blackberry bushes grew in wild untamed tangles around him and tall prairie grass waved slowly, blown by a lazy breeze that curled through his hair tickling his scalp.  Cas felt a strand of joy rise through him, growing stronger as it filled his chest. He took a deep breath and turned to the sun, letting it wash across his face.
Dean fumbled along the nightstand next to his bed, groping for the glass of whiskey he’d left there last night. His hand bumped the glass clumsily, sending the heavy tumbler crashing to the ground. Dean clutched his head at noise. There was a tentative knock at the door.
, Billie had said, her brows raised incredulously.  And he hadn’t denied it.  He couldn’t.  Dean’s fingers tightened on the steering wheel and he tried to force his brain to stop thinking.  He’d never been this close to giving up before.  He couldn’t see how to go on from here.  He saw his life spread out before him, bleak and empty.  Days sliding into months into years, devoid of any purpose, of any joy.  He tried to steel himself to face it.  His knuckles were white against the black steering wheel and his jaw hurt from how hard he was clenching it.  How long could he endure this, he wondered.  At the moment, it felt like he couldn’t take another minute.
“She loved you so much, Jack.  She did everything in her power to protect you.  She absolutely loved you.  More than anything.” Jack dropped his eyes to the floor, and quickly brushed the back of his hand across them. Sam gave his arm an encouraging squeeze.
Jody moved around Sam to stand behind him and wrapped her arms around his broad shoulders. She rested her chin on top of his head, and Sam let out a long sigh like a shudder. Jody tightened her embrace. They stayed that way for several minutes. Jody broke the silence first.
“Because I know what it feels like to not belong. To feel like there’s this darkness inside of you. To be scared of who you are, what you can do. Dean, Cas, my family helped me through that.  So know I want to help you. Because you are not evil, Jack.”  And with that Sam turned and strode from the room, leaving Jack staring after him, silently considering all that had been said.
“I like orange,” Cas answered, rolling his eyes.  Dean snorted. Cas narrowed his eyes at him playfully. “Now which one of us has on all the fucking clothes?” Dean looked down at his jeans and boots and snorted again.
“Dean,” Cas gently touched his elbow, and it was like fire shooting through Dean’s entire body.  He shivered involuntarily and Cas’s blue eyes widened.  “Dean, you don’t have to…” His words trailed off as Dean moved his arm and suddenly, green eyes bored into his.  Cas’s heart jumped.  Abruptly, Dean broke off the intense stare and opened the door.  He climbed out, shut it and leaned against Baby’s sleek, black side.  Cas narrowed his eyes and exited the car, slowly circling around to stand in front of Dean. He couldn’t identify the feeling in his stomach or was it in his heart or maybe his legs.  It was beyond his experience as angel, it was a thoroughly human feeling.  He opened his mouth to say Dean’s name again but instead he just stood there staring at his face.  His breath hitched as his eyes trailed over Dean’s face. The hunter was pale, each freckle on his face blazed like a brand, his mouth a deep crimson and Cas knew if Dean raised his eyes, the green would cut straight though his body to his pounding heart.
“I can get you to Hastings,” she replied.  “It’s not far from there to Lebanon. Hop in, John.” Cas opened the door and settled himself in the passenger seat.
So he does. He opens his mouth and it all comes pouring out. What kind of deal Cas made. The things he said about Dean. What he confessed. How Dean can still see that rippling inky dark creep across his proud, teary, smiling face. How he sees it every time he closes his eyes and then again when he opens them. How he’ll never stop seeing it.
“Is that fair, Jody?” Sam ran his free hand through his hair in frustration. “I lost mom too.  I lost Cas, too.”
“I know.”  Dean pushed himself up to peer into Cas’s face and Cas’s lap was cold and empty suddenly.  He looked back at Dean with a puzzled squint.
“What’s lasagna? Who’s Jody?” Jack’s innocent confusion was endearing and not for the first time since he’d met the kid, Sam was reminded of Cas. The head tilt was pure Castiel and Sam felt a pang of loss, looking at him.  Cas had been a good friend and Sam missed him.
“So this will stop your heart and this is adrenaline and that’ll restart it. You’ll only have about five minutes here. I don’t know how long that translates to in the Empty but I’m not risking any more than five minutes”
“No.  Not Sherlock either,” he answered, shyly trying to match her playful tone. “But at least I know who that one is.”  It seemed that was the right move.  She grinned as she steered the car back onto the highway.
Finally, after what seemed like the longest three minutes in the history of the universe, Sam’s watch beeped.  Sam grabbed the second syringe and jabbed it into his brother’s chest, pushing down hard on the plunger. He expected Dean to sit up almost immediately, that’s the way this was supposed to work, but several seconds passed and then several more and Dean remained still and unresponsive on the floor.  Sam felt his heart drop all the way to his feet and panic sprang up through him like electricity.
” at it but that didn’t work either.  He was out of ideas.  It seemed like such a simple task.  These powers of his were fickle it appeared.  When he’d been frightened, they’d seemed to flow out of him without even a thought.  But now when he wanted them, nothing.  He could fling a person across a room but he couldn’t move a stupid pencil even a millimeter.  Maybe Dean was right.  Maybe he couldn’t ever do anything good with his powers.  Maybe he was a monster, after all.  Suddenly he grabbed the pencil and hurled it across the room.  He watched as it hit the floor and skittered away into the corner.
When the entity looks at him, Meg’s pretty face is contorted with rage. Then an eerie calm passes across it and it smiles. Dean shudders at the grotesque grin.
“Cas, I…” He swallowed hard. “I wanna tell… I mean, I wanna say…”  He flung his head back and covered his eyes with an arm.  “Fuck, why is this so hard?”
On second thought maybe a case involving a therapist who dealt with losing loved ones was a little too close to home.  Things had gotten altogether too real in Mia Vallens office and Sam was still reeling from what had gone down.  He hadn’t meant to actually get into their real family issues.  He hadn’t meant to really talk about their mom and what it meant to him to lose her but when Mia had started to ask questions, it had just started to bubble over and spill out of his mouth before he realized what was happening.  Dean’s sarcasm and snark had been a like a spark to dry kindling inside him and Sam had just finally had
The sight of Dean’s naked chest caused a wave of arousal to break over Cas and he had to close his eyes in an attempt to catch his breath.  As he lay there, steadying himself, he felt Dean’s hands slide up his own chest, fingers plucking open the buttons of his white dress shirt, revealing his white undershirt.
“I think there’s a lot.” Sam ducked a shower of glass from an overhead light as he and Dean ran back down hall toward the staircase.  All around them, they could hear the ghosts whispering, searching for the doctor that had murdered them.
. What a stupid decision. She didn’t have to die. There was no reason for this shit.” Dean punched the steering wheel in frustration.
Dean nods along almost absently. If there’s one thing he’s not a rookie at it’s dying and coming back. He has faith Sam will manage that part of it and do he lets Sam’s narration of the situation wash over him, his voice a comforting buzz in the background. The forefront of his mind is occupied with one thought alone. What will he say to Cas if he can find him?
And he would.  He would save James and Patience, because that’s what he did.  Saving people, hunting things, the family business and all that.  And he would do it without breaking down again.
“Why do you think I called you? Who better to handle the teenage son of Satan who considers and entirely different fallen angel to be his father?”
“Sam?” She sounded confused and worried and exhausted.  “What time is it? What’s going on? Is everything okay? Do you need help?”
He was calm by the time he was guiding Baby into the bunker’s garage.  Calm and resolute.  He’d go inside and talk to Sam.  And then he’d take a bottle of whiskey to his room and drink until he passed out and all of these feelings would go away.
He’s openly sobbing now on hands and knees and the Entity smirks and cocks it’s head to the side, a painful mockery of Cas’s signature motion.
“Okay.” Dean nodded once and headed for the garage, Cas trailing, bemused, in his wake.  They settled themselves into the Impala and headed out into the warm, Kansas night.
“I think there’s another ghost.” The lightbulbs began to pop and shatter and the pictures on the walls flung themselves to the floor.
A black tendril shoots from the center of the entity’s body slicing across Cas’s neck. Blue light spills from his throat.
.  Definitely their kind of thing.  Sam had even set Jack up with a crap ton of DVDs to keep him busy so he and Dean could go on the hunt by themselves.  Dean had warmed to Jack considerably after he’d saved their asses from Mia Vallen’s crazy shapeshifter ex-boyfriend but Sam thought Dean would be happier if it was just the two of them and Baby just like the good old days.  Okay so maybe the old days weren’t really that good but that was just the kind of thought that Sam was going to push all the way to the back of his mind, lock in a box, bury in concrete and sink to the bottom of the fucking ocean.  For now, he was going to make this hunt as pleasant for Dean as possible and if that meant beer for breakfast and reading reviews of some god-awful strip club with the mind-blowingly offensive name of the Clamdiver, that’s what he was going to do.  And for a while, it seemed like it was going okay.  He’d even let Dean use Agent Page as his alias when they went to speak to the boy’s mother.  But apparently he’d been a little too obvious because now they were standing outside the Royal Towers Hotel and Dean was squinting suspiciously at him.  Maybe telling him how many stars the Clamdiver had was a bridge too far.  Maybe it was the chili fries he’d ordered at lunch.  Whatever it was, it seemed that Dean was on to him.
There’d been no reasoning with him. There never was when he was in this state. And yet this had seemed different to Sam. The devastation radiating from his brother had been so strong, so intense. Sam had never seen him this wrecked. He’d tried to reason with him but it had been useless. And when he’d asked about Cas…
For a long time, Dean tells no one about how Castiel died. Oh he gives the basics. Made a deal with the Empty, cashed it in, saved the day. The things he choked out in explanation to Sam when he found him there sitting in the cold, dimly lit dungeon just feet from where he’d watched the Empty swallow Cas whole. He’d told those things. But the details? Those he keeps to himself. He keeps them so closely to himself that Sam and Jack are suspicious but they, in turn, keep those suspicions to themselves. They fight on against Chuck. Sam is smart and resourceful. Jack is powerful and earnest. Dean is... hollow. He fights. He plans with them and executes the plan they devise and in the end they win. Of course they win. There was no other option but to win. Sam devised a strategy. Jack burns out his power. And then everyone comes back. Eileen and Donna. Bobby. Charlie and her pretty girlfriend. Everyone but Cas. Dean watches as they pop back into existence, hoping. He hopes. For weeks it seems like every day they hear from someone. Jody and the girls. Garth and his wife. Those Ghostfacer guys. But not Cas. Never Cas. When Rowena finally contacts them he picks her brain a bit about the Empty but short of “I’ve got no sway there, dearie” he doesn’t get much in the way of answers. When the archangel wearing his little brother finally shows back up, he tries again but he gets even less from Michael than he did from Rowena. It’s where the angels go when they die. Ruled by a cosmic entity. No he doesn’t know anything more. No he doesn’t think anyone can escape it. Not without divine or demi-divine intervention and neither of those things exist anymore. There’s no god. No nephilim. Just a few angels slowly sputtering out. Cas is gone.
“Dean?” Sam opened the door slowly, peering into the dark room. One of the advantages of living underground, the room could be dark 24/7 if Dean wanted. He was really appreciating that lately.
“Dean and I do share a more profound bond,” the angel had said and Sam had thought he’d understood.  Now he was beginning to think he didn’t understand anything at all.
“I need three minutes,” Dean answered and before Sam could stop him, he thrust the needle into his chest with both hands, emptying the syringe into his heart.
“Come on Castiel, wouldn’t you rather be a fond memory than a constant festering disappointment?” The entity delivered a sharp kick to his midsection and then began to try to coax him back to sleep.  Castiel closed his eyes.  He pictured Dean.  He pictured him laughing, the way he threw his head back, the little star lines that appeared at the corners of his eyes.  He pictured him fighting, his jaw a sharp line of determined bone, eyes like green fire. He pictured all the times they’d stared at each other, minutes without sound, moments in which each seemed to be desperately trying to speak without actually using words.
“Room key.  I’ve been trying to tell you that your room is ready for five minutes.” She took a step closer and peered searchingly into Dean’s face. “You doing okay, kiddo?”
“Don’t.” he said, spitting the words out like they were poisonous.  “If you wanna stay here and Mr. Miyagi this kid, knock yourself out.  I didn’t sign up for that.  So I’m gonna go to work.” And with that, Dean spun on his heel and left Sam sitting in the library, alone.
Cas watched the smile spread across Dean’s face and when he turned his face toward him and snuggled in, a bolt of joy surged through him.  He tightened his fingers in Dean’s hair for a moment, giving an affectionate tug and dropped his head back against the seat, letting the music wash over him.  He hummed along, recognizing the song when suddenly a thought occurred to him.
“Yeah Sam, I’m fine. Everything’s fine.” Dean turned, trying to hide his face from the splash of light the open door threw across his bed, but it was no use. He’d might as well get up. Sam was gonna stand there with that concerned expression forever and besides, he needed to piss. Wearily he swung his legs out of the bed and pulled himself up. God, the hangover was intense. He felt like someone had put his brain in a blender. Abruptly he remembered Cas under the attack dog spell saying he felt like was inside a blender set to puree for a tomato salsa.
“Dean you’re talking about killing yourself!” Sam’s eyes widened in fear as Dean yanked the cap from the needle with his teeth.  “That’s an insane risk to take!”
“The Winchesters,” he began. “They must have made a deal.”  As he spoke, several feeling began warring within him.  Had Sam and Dean done this? And if they had, why? Perhaps they were in trouble.  He gasped a bit at the idea that the brothers might be in danger and he had no way of helping them.  Terrible visions began to crowd into his mind.  Sam and Dean, injured, maybe dead.  Sam’s long body broken, his thick brown hair, matted with blood.  Terror began to creep slowly across his skin.  The idea of Sam hurt, was a stab of pain.  Then his traitorous mind assembled a picture of
There was no alarm. It was the sounds of ordinary life that dragged Dean Winchester up from the depths of his troubled, heavy sleep. Regular sounds. Voices murmuring, a dropped book, his sasquatch brother’s giant clomping feet echoing down the hallway outside his door. Dean rolled over in bed and opened his eyes. He tucked an arm behind his head and fixed a thousand yard stare at the ceiling of his room. There was no life in the apple green eyes and they saw nothing of the ceiling tiles nor anything else in the room for that matter. Instead, Dean saw the same horrific scene he’d seen every time sleep abandoned him. A funeral pyre, the wooden logs stacked like a leaning fence, fingers of flame reaching high into the sky and a linen-wrapped corpse slowly burning to ash. Dean swallowed hard and clenched his hands to fists in a desperate attempt to stave off the feeling he knew was coming. It was pointless of course. His hands had never stopped feeling it. The heaviness of Cas’s body. The unresponsiveness when Dean had lifted his feet to wrap the curtain around them. How cold he’d been, how he’d already begun to feel stiff and foreign in Dean’s hands. Dean turned his face into the pillow to keep from screaming. Outside the door, the regular life noises continued. Dean hated them with all his heart.
“I need you to keep the faith for both of us,” Dean had said, his eyes flashing with pain.  And Sam had agreed.  But at what cost? Could he actually do it? Could he bury his own pain and sorrow deep enough to carry them both? For a moment, Sam felt a hard, ugly ball of resentment rise in his chest.
“Goodbye” there is a great flash of light abd Dean shuts his eyes against it, hands gripping Cas’s arms tightly.
“What do I do, Jody?” he begged her. “I don’t know what to do? He in so much pain and I’m a mess too.  How are we gonna make it through this?  How do I keep the faith? I’m not sure I have any faith either. What do I do?” He could feel the edge of panic begin to creep up on him and he gripped the table hard in an effort to ground himself.
“Fucking hell, Cas,” Dean exclaimed in exasperation. “Why do you have on so many fucking clothes?”  Cas opened his eyes and squinted at Dean’s frustrated frown, amused.
“Beer run.” Dean was brusque, dropping his bag on the map table. Sam looked up, startled by his tone and confused since he knew for a fact there were at least two six packs in the fridge.  Dean didn’t meet his eye.  Instead he turned to Castiel. “Whaddya say, Cas?”  Cas cocked his head slightly, peering at Dean with his trademarked squint.  He nodded slowly.
“What?” Jody looked pointedly at her outstretched hand. It was only then that Dean noticed she was holding a motel key out to him.
The hand that closes around his neck and lifts him off the ground is no longer Meg’s small delicate one but a huge one formed of the swirling black substance that he watched consume Cas months ago. He closes his eyes, resigning himself to his fate and gasps out one last time. “I love you, Cas!”
“Okay, first of all, it’s bizarre as hell that you find Constantine relatable and b. where is your mind that this frickin amazing ass story is not holding your attention? Is it in Lebanon, Kansas?”
Jack had really tried to do what Sam asked of him and move the pencil.  He’d stared at the thing for what seemed like days but he had no idea how to make it move.
“Nothing!” he gasped. “I was just… I was...” Dean shoved past him and vanished down the hallway. A few minutes later he reappeared, arm filled with bottles of beer. He didn’t even glance at Jack as he crossed into his room, kicking the door shut behind him.
Jack made his way cautiously down the long hallway. Until now, he hadn’t felt like leaving his room. At least he supposed it was his room. Sam had brought him to the room, explaining that it was probably a bit musty and needed a good airing out but it would do. He’d said a lot of things about sheets and getting some new clothes and where the bathroom was and the noise of it had washed over Jack like a wave. Sam had seemed to understand how overwhelmed he was and stopped explaining. In the end, he’d smiled somewhat sadly, shut the door, and then Jack had been alone. And he stayed in the room, his room, alone since then. But hearing Sam and Dean’s muffled voices in the hall had made him curious and he decided to venture out and see what was happening. He thought he might like to talk to Sam again. The tall, rangy hunter had been gentle with him and his eyes had been kind. As he passed the bathroom, the door suddenly banged open and there stood Dean, red eyed, reeking of whiskey, swaying a bit as he leaned menacingly toward Jack. Jack shrank back against the wall, dread gathering into a ball in his stomach.
As the weeks pass, the hollow feeling in Dean’s chest grows until he feels scooped out, empty. He hasn’t cried since he sat and sobbed in that dungeon still feeling the grip of Cas’s fingers on his arms, still wearing his bloody handprint. He hasn’t cried. Hasn’t laughed much either. Or talked or eaten or lived. Sam and Jack tiptoe around him, speaking to him in low, gentle voices as if loud words might break him. Maybe they’re right. Maybe they will but the kind, soft ones are worse because they’re too much like the things he said. Life moves on. He stays still. And then one day Sam comes to his room, shuts the door behind him and sits down in the chair at his desk. Dean looks at him with dull eyes.
It took ages, and Cas was on the verge of giving up when finally a beat up Honda pulled over skittering gravel over the top of his shoes. Cas peered in the passenger window.  Inside was a girl about the same age as Claire.  She flashed him a grin.
Dean hadn’t been able to believe his eyes when he’d pulled into that alley and seen the familiar figure standing there next to the pay phone. And when Cas had finally turned to face him, he’d felt his breath catch in his throat and his heart drop to his stomach.  He’d crossed the distance between them in three steps and them he’d had his arms around Cas, reassuring himself that he was real, that this was actually happening.  He was painfully aware of Sam’s presence behind him and so let go of Cas quickly. Too quickly.  He wanted to hold him forever.  He wanted to touch his face.  He wanted to run his hands over his entire body, to squeeze his arms and legs, to prove to himself that this was real. To make himself believe that this was him, his Cas, genuinely here, real and solid and alive.
“Have you tried praying to him?” Sam’s got those trademarked puppy eyes fixed on him and Dean has to look away because he can’t lie to those eyes.
“Yep,” he replied. “Time to get our game faces on.  Too bad Sam’s not here. He’d give them those puppy eyes of his and they’d follow him anywhere. I have a feeling if Missouri’s son and granddaughter are anything like her, we’re in for some stubbornness.”
It took at least an hour for him to find a road. And it wasn’t much of a road.  Just a dusty track really, snaking through the brambly field but it was a start. Not for the first time, Castiel bemoaned the state of his wings. What he would give to leap up into the air, unfurl them and fly out of this field.  Cas shook his head at himself.
“Sure, sweetheart.” He flashed her one of his patented heartbreaker grins but there was no life in it. “Go ahead.”
The seconds felt like years, the minutes like millennia.  As he sat, counting down to the moment he could plunge the second needle into Dean’s chest, reviving him, Sam contemplated how very wrong this had all gone.  Dean had killed himself.  Oh sure, he was going to come back in a couple of minutes, but the way he’d just done it, without a second thought, sent a chill up Sam’s spine that had nothing to do with the ghostly temperature drop.  Dean was not okay. The “just us two like old times” case hadn’t worked.  The booze, bacon and more booze hadn’t worked. The strip club escapade hadn’t worked.  Sam dropped his head into his hands.  The fire of dread still licking at his insides was joined by another of despair.  He didn’t know what to do.  He couldn’t help Dean.  He saw that now.  He swallowed hard past the growing lump in his throat and glared at his watch, willing the time to move faster with all his might.
he thought.  Easily rectified, that.  He signaled to the waitress and ordered another round of whiskey.  He didn’t care how long or how much booze it took, tonight he was going to forget.
.  He’d done it.  With numb, shaking fingers, Sam set a three minute timer on his watch before pulling a carton of salt from the bag and shaking it out in a circle around Dean’s lifeless body.  And then he sat down to wait.
“I’m going to ask them.” Dean opened the tin and held up a fat syringe, its twin still rolling inside... “One needle stops the heart. One starts it up again.”
“What is it? Is it my birthday? Did I win a bet I didn’t know about?” Dean looked at him warily and Sam dropped his eyes to the pavement.
“I’ve found a way into the Empty.”  Seven words that bore straight through Dean’s rib cage to settle directly in his heart. He actually gasps and stares at Sam in confusion.
“Goddamit Sam, I said I’m fi…” The sentence died in his mouth when he saw him. The kid. The reason for all this. The reason Cas was… Dean’s eyes narrowed dangerously.
“I’m sorry about Missouri, Dean.” Jody’s brown eyes were warm and sympathetic. “I guess you’d known her a long time, huh?”
Sam was pleased with himself for setting up the cameras so he could keep an eye on Jack but not crowd him too much.  The kid was definitely scary but there was an innocence to him that gave Sam a somewhat paternal feeling toward him.  He watched Jack concentrating on the task Sam had given him.
“I don’t know.  I am enjoying you removing them though.” Dean huffed a laugh and pulled him up, yanking the undershirt off.  They were chest to chest now without the layers of fabric between them and the sensation of Dean’s warm skin against his own was enough to send lightning scurrying down every nerve in Castiel’s entire body. Dean looked at him, green eyes lust blown and licked his lips.  Slowly his hands traveled down Cas’s chest until they reached his belt buckle. He caught Cas’s eyes and Cas nodded once and lifted his hips, then Dean’s fingers were loosening the leather belt and slipping it from his waist in one fluid movement. Cas reached down to the button on his dress pants, but Dean stopped him with a hand on his wrist.
Cas woke with a start.  His intense blue eyes tried unsuccessfully to focus on his surroundings but there was nothing to fix on.  He seemed to be lying in the middle of a great black nothingness.  Slowly he pushed himself to his feet looking around him in confusion. Where was he? He tried to think of the last thing remembered before waking up in this place, whatever it was.  Kelly had been in labor.  Right, Kelly had been in labor and Lucifer had found them.  And they had made a plan, he and Sam and Dean and Crowley.  A plan to trap Lucifer on the other side of the rift.  He remembered rushing through the rift. He remembered hearing Dean call his name behind him as he charged Lucifer, stabbing him with his angel blade.  And then he’d gone back through.  There was a glimpse of Dean’s green eyes widening in shock and fear and then nothing.  What had happened? And where in the world was he?
“You look sad, honey.”  Her voice was low and purring and she flicked her long reddish hair over her shoulder before looking up at him through lowered lashes clumped with thick black mascara.  “Want me to make it better?”  He didn’t really.  And then again, he did.  He sure as hell wanted
“Also in his goddam room,” Sam replied, quickly dragging an arm across his eyes. “I feel like the headmaster of a really messed up boarding school.” Jody chuckled and settled herself into one of the library’s heavy wooden chairs. She smiled up at Sam.
Dean begged her silently.  Jody took the hint and readjusted her features back to a down to business expression.
“Send me back to Earth,” he said, fully meeting the creature’s eyes for the first time.  And for the first time, Cas saw uncertainly there.
“Yes, I believe I do,” he growled.  “Now take these pants OFF.” Dean wasted no time obeying this obvious command, stripping himself of his jeans, socks and boots in no time.  Now that they were both clad in nothing but boxer briefs, Dean felt an attack of shyness sweep over him and he ducked his head to the side, bashfully.
.  He felt a surge of delight. Nebraska was so close to Lebanon, Kansas.  Now he just needed to figure out how to get there.  Searching his memories, he remembered Sam telling him about a time he and Dean had a fight and how Sam had decided to hitchhike to California. Right, hitchhiking.  Hoping he was doing it correctly, Cas stuck his thumb out and began to walk backwards, trying to catch the eye of one of the people speeding alongside him.
“Easy, kiddo,” Jody laid a soft hand on Dean’s shoulder. She felt a shudder go through the hunter’s body. She could tell Dean was holding himself together with mental duct tape and it was hard to see him this broken.  Dean shook his head and Jody felt that she could see him begin to force himself to adopt his usual tough veneer.  “Remember, if you ever need to talk...”
“We think the fact that you’re not actually an angel or demon will keep you from being put to sleep. Once you’re there, you’ll have to try to find Cas. I don’t know how but this is the best idea I’ve got. It’s the only idea. And truthfully I kind of hate it. But if there’s a chance, Dean…. I know what Cas means to you. I mean I love him too. He’s family but… I know…” Dean looks away as Sam trails off and then clears his throat. “So whaddya think? It’s up to you, Dean. You’re the one who has to pull it off.”
“Of course it’s not fair, Sam.  Who said it was fair? But it’s a thing we do when we love somebody and they tell us they need us to carry them for a while.”
Dean was shaking in earnest now, a full body tremor that had him helpless and frantic. He clawed at the door and the seat in a desperate attempt to calm himself. Because he was remembering again.  Remembering deciding to include this song on the mixtape for Cas.  He’d gone back and forth about including it. It was such a soft, vulnerable song and Dean had had to force himself not to erase it.  It had felt like giving Cas a bit of his soul.  He remembered giving Cas the tape. How shy he’d felt explaining what it was.  The way Cas’s face had lit up when he finally understood that Dean had made this just for him.  The howl was rising in Dean’s chest again and this time he didn’t have the strength to contain it.  Sobbing, he tumbled from the car, the gravel cutting into his palms as he hunched on his knees next to Baby’s open door.  He wept fiercely, calling Cas’s name over and over again. Faintly, from inside the Impala, the song drifted over him.
“I’m already saved.” This time he didn’t even feel the entity’s kick.  “And you can prance and you can preen, and you can scream and yell and remind me of my failings but somehow I’m awake.  And I will stay awake and I will keep you awake until we both go insane.” The entity struck him hard across the face but Castiel focused his thoughts on Dean, his face, his hands, the long line of his back, the way his legs bowed. He pushed himself to his feet.  “I will fight you and fight you and fight you forever. For eternity.”
“Stop,” he whispered. “Please stop.”  He swallowed hard and gripped Baby’s steering wheel until his fingers were white.  He could do this. He’d had years of practice at shoving his feelings down.  He’d done it for years as a child, as a teenager and even as a young man.  His father had made it clear that he was to keep this kind of shit to himself.  John Winchester had not been a man who had an interest in any grief but his own.  And Dean had learned to fold his pain into a tiny package and bury it deep inside his mind.  And he was trying now.  Trying so hard to push him away, to forget.  But Castiel would not leave him, no matter how deep he tried to bury him.
“The bodies have to be buried in the house somewhere,” Dean dropped his bag to floor and began to rifle through it.
Sam places a trembling hand on his forehead and turns his head baring his neck. Dean feels the prick of the needle and hears Sam whisper “Good luck.”
It seemed like ages before Cas reached a larger road.  He looked around him, trying to get some sense of where he was.  How far was the bunker from here, he wondered.  And how could he get there? He searched for something that would tell him where he was.  He continued to walk along the highway, hoping he was at least headed in the right direction.  Finally he spotted a sign emblazoned with the names of cities and miles.  Hastings 161 miles it said.  Omaha 50 miles.
“Sam will be disappointed in me,” he whispered to himself.  He hated the idea of disappointing Sam.  Sam, who had been so
“Well, messed up teenagers happen to be my specialty,” she quipped. Sam managed a watery smile. His relief at her presence was obvious.
“Well if they’re ghost how come we can’t see them,” Dean gasped as they avoided a trio of beds that slid toward them menacingly.
“…and so that’s how John managed to get the angels and God to cure his cancer.  And you aren’t listening to me at all are you?” Nora laughed as Cas attempted to deny her accusation.
“Sam and Dean need me,” he said, his voice steel in the darkness. He was careful to include Sam.  If this entity hadn’t discovered his feelings for Dean, he had no intention of spelling it out.
“Let me tell you about John Constantine, then.  Brother, you are in for a treat.” Cas smiled at her.
Jody’s compassionate expression was more than Dean could handle at the moment.  He took the key from her and turned away, shouldering his army green duffle.
“This is your favorite?” Dean smiled at him, touching Cas’s lips softly as he continued to hum along. “Why?”
, he thought.  Sleeping it seemed, if the entity was to be believed.  And it seemed believable.  Or it least the barely contained fury that was radiating from the entity was definitely believable. It appeared Castiel had woken it up and now it was demanding an explanation.
“Get that stupid fucking trench coat off, Cas,” he growled.  CAS obliged, shrugging out of not only his trench coat but his suit coat as well.  Dean shucked off his leather jacket, tossing it behind him out of the car onto the grass.  He reached down and grabbed CAS’s blue tie, pulling him up into a searing kiss.  Cas moaned into his mouth and slid his hands across Dean’s shoulders pushing at the unbuttoned flannel shirt.  Dean dropped his arms and let Cas push the shirt off.  He grabbed the tie again, loosening it this time and sliding it off.  Cas’s long, deft fingers trembled across the hem of Dean’s t-shirt and Dean ducked his head slightly to allow Cas to pull the shirt up and over his head.
“Oh save it,” the creature sneered. “I have tiptoed through all your little tulips. Your memories, your little feelings, yes? I know what you hate. I know who you love and what you fear. There is nothing back there for you.”  Cas felt his heart drop to his feet at the mention of who he loved and what he feared.  So he hadn’t been able to hide it after all.  And it was like an iron band around his chest to hear the entity say there was nothing back there for him.  Oh, it was good alright.  It had reached into the most secret parts of his mind and plucked out those thoughts as easily as picking an apple from a tree.  And now it presented him with those secret haunts, neatly polished and sharpened into a weapon to cut him down.  The entity grasped Castiel’s head and his mind was flooded with images and memories.  All of the worst things he could remember, losing his grace to Metatron, opening Purgatory, drowning in the reservoir.  More and more horrible memories flowed from the creature’s fingers into his mind.  Until the last thing he saw was Dean’s hands gently rolling him over after he’d nearly died trying to return the souls to Purgatory.  That was a mistake on the entity’s part.  Because then he remembered promising Dean he’d make it up to him.  He remember when he’d been lost and confused as Emmanuel and Dean had found him and brought him back.  And he remembered that Dean had kept the trench coat, in case he’d come back.  He remembered that Dean had hoped he’d come back.  He gritted his teeth and tried to stand.
“Have you ever told anyone else all of that?” Nora asked gently.  Suddenly shy, Cas shook his head.  Nora turned her spotlight of a smile on him again.
“Fucking, get your fucking pants off right fucking now, Dean Winchester,” Cas raised an eyebrow at him and his blue eyes flashed.  Dean gasped as that low voice traveled straight down to his cock again.
“No.” he spat. “No, no, no, no.” He didn’t hear any of the rest of Dean’s explanation.  He didn’t care to hear it.
“Alright,” it replied.  “I’ll wrack it for you.” His double slammed its hand down over Castiel’s forehead and Cas screamed in pain and dropped to his knees.  He could actually feel long fingers dig through his brain.  Desperately he scrambled to hide his most precious, most private thoughts, but he could feel those snaking, sneaking digits prying open every hidden corner of his mind. Every shameful failure, every cherished moment, every secret desire laid bare to this invader. When it finally retreated, Castiel was left a broken rag doll, gasping on his hands and knees.
Dean was silent as they traveled through and out of the sleeping town to the fields that surrounded it.  After several miles, Dean pulled the Impala onto a small, gravelly offshoot of the main road and killed the engine.  They sat there together, Dean and Cas, for a moment, in the soft dark, Baby’s headlights the only light for miles.  Then Dean spoke.
“Holy shit, Cas,” he panted.  “Do you have any idea what that voice does to me?” Castiel reached up to cup Dean, hard in his jeans.
It was a full day before Dean left his room again.  He found Sam sitting in the library talking on his cell phone.
“Dean? Wait.” He put out a hand, stopping the other man for a moment.  “I can still see your breath.”
All the way home, Dean considered the different advice he and Jody had given to Patience.  The girl was gifted, there was no doubt about that, but look what being a gifted psychic had done for Missouri.  Murdered by a wraith.  An ignoble end, he thought.  If she hadn’t been in the life, she probably be safe and sound right now, still on good terms with her son, able to be a doting grandma to Patience.  He shook his head thinking of all the crap he’d seen this hunter’s life dole out to so many people over the years, of all the people he’d watched die.  Pamela.  Jo and Ellen. Rufus. Bobby. Kevin. Charlie. In his head his envisioned a different life for each of them.  He saw Pamela managing a rock and roll band.  Ellen and Jo running a regular bar without a hunter clientele.  Rufus a grumpy old curmudgeon, hollering at kids to stay off his lawn.  Bobby puttering around his salvage yard, fixing classic cars.  Charlie gleefully hacking video games and distributing them to the masses for free.  If only, he thought to himself.  Patience should take his advice and get as far away from this shit as possible. So should Jody, come to think of it.  She ought to go back to Sioux Falls and lock Claire and Alex in their rooms and refuse to let them out until they agreed to stay out of this life forever. Fat chance of that happening, he knew.  Jody would hunt and Claire would hunt and Alex would get dragged into it and pretty soon he’d be standing by a funeral pyre watching them go up in smoke, just like…
Jack had been very receptive to Kelly’s video and Sam felt a sense of relief.  The kid was so intense, Sam felt perpetually poised on the edge of flight or fight every minute he spent with him.  He supposed he couldn’t really blame the poor kid.  Whether or not he was the most powerful being on the planet, he was still only a week or so old.  Sam couldn’t imagine how confusing and frightening this all must be for him.  Nevertheless, he was basically a confused and frightened nuclear bomb and Sam wasn’t entirely certain he would be able to defuse him.  Now, in the kitchen he opened the refrigerator, pulled out Jody’s lasagna and looked at the post-it note fixed to the tinfoil covering the pan.
“No, I was, mostly, actually, this story is weirdly sort of relatable. It’s just, well, I admit, my mind is elsewhere right now.”
Dean’s smile was sad and Jody’s heart broke at little at the sight.  She’d come to love these hunter boys as her own.  Like all hunters, they were fierce and violent when need be, but there was a vulnerability to them that had touched Jody’s mother’s heart.  Those motherless boys had cut straight through the softest part of her and she ached, seeing one of them in this much pain.  She wanted to demand that Dean pull the car over immediately and hold him until he’d cried himself out but she knew that Dean wouldn’t, couldn’t allow himself to break in front of anyone.  She squeezed his shoulder again and Dean let out a soft, quavering breath.
“I will send you back Castiel but I never want to see you again. So I’ll take something from you before you go to ensure that I never do.”
At first a sense of panic starts to rise in him. This dark is like nothing he’s ever seen before. A smooth endless blackness that stretches forever in every direction. His eyes dilate rapidly trying to focus but there’s nothing to focus on. No light. No images. Just miles of deep rich dark. Until…
“Or I throw you so deep into the Empty that you can’t bother me anymore,” it spat, lips curling into a sneer. Cas began to feel a small finger of hope worm its way into his heart.
In the hallway, Jack listened as the brothers shouted at each other.  Sam’s voice was low and measured as he tried to reason with Dean.  Dean’s responses seemed to drip with venom and hate.  Jack shivered, hearing Dean accuse Sam of wanting to use him and pretending to care.  Was that true? Was Sam only pretending to care? Was his kindness an act? And then he heard Dean shout his father’s name.  Jack was startled to hear how laden with pain Dean’s voice sounded.  He could do nothing but stand there, listening as the argument came to a head.  He wished for thousandth time that someone could help him, guide him.  He was lost and confused and the brothers’ yelling frightened him.  Desperately he looked up and whispered a name.
“No, Jack,” Sam said and the compassion in his voice made Jack’s chest ache. “Why do you think you’re evil? Because when I look at you, that’s not what I see.”
“No shit, Sherlock,” laughed the girl.  “Don’t tell me. Sherlock isn’t your name either.” Cas began to realize she was teasing him.
“Okay, kiddo.  Let’s get some sleep and we’ll head for James and Patience first thing in the morning.”  Dean closed his eyes and wondered not for the first time how he and Sam had gotten so lucky to have this woman in their life.
“Cas.” Dean’s voice was a whisper that seemed to catch in his throat.  Castiel brought his hands down to Dean’s waist and then in a second, flipped them around so that Dean was under him.  He caught Dean’s mouth with his own, swallowing down the gasp that punched out of him when his back hit the leather seat. He lowered himself down onto Dean’s body, their naked chests flush now and devoured Dean’s mouth, their tongues tangled together.  Cas groaned with pleasure at the taste of Dean’s mouth.  It was even better than he had imagined it would be.  He shifted a bit atop Dean and suddenly felt Dean’s hard cock brush his own. A bolt of desire jolted through him, and he lined himself up against Dean’s cock again and thrust hard.  He felt Dean buck his hips up and thrust again, harder this time.  His boxers were quickly becoming wet and he could feel that Dean’s were as well.  Dean’s hands slid down his back until they grasped at Cas’s hips and pulled him forward roughly, sliding their dicks together again.  Cas felt Dean’s fingers slip under the elastic band of his boxers and then his cock was in Dean’s hand and he threw his head back, moaning Dean’s name.
Dean’s breath suddenly choked him and he balled his hands to fists again. Sam noticed and took a step forward, hand outstretched. Dean brushed past him, roughly and Sam let him pass silently. Dean could feel his eyes on him all the way down the hall. Once in the bathroom, Dean relieved his aching bladder. When had been the last time he’d pissed for chrissake? He washed his hands and splashed water on his face, rubbing a wet hand over the back of his neck. Then he raised his eyes to the mirror and looked at the wreck he’d let himself become. Unbidden, another memory of Cas surfaced. Cas, unexpectedly, amazingly, back from Purgatory. Dean could see him, his muddy coat, his scruffy face. That beard. He remembered finding him in that hell, grabbing him, pulling him close. He remembered touching that beard softly. The relief he’d felt at finally finding him. The joy. Dean gripped the sink and stifled the howl rising in his chest. His hands tightened on the sink so hard he thought he might crush the porcelain. He could no longer meet his own eyes in the mirror. Outside of the door he heard a sound. He flung the door open.
As the last bits of his grace flow from him, Cas collapses to the ground. Dean crawls over to him and Cas clutches at him desperately.
There’s no mistaking that voice and he’s not surprised at all when he turns to see the image of Meg draped across what looks like a throne. She chuckles, low and evil.
Ten minutes later, Dean found himself redressed in his jeans only, head pillowed on Cas’s dress pants clad lap, bare feet kicked up on the passenger side window as he fiddled with Baby’s stereo.   Eventually he got the volume at the level he liked, loud enough to fill the interior with the familiar sound of Robert Plant’s suggestive voice but not so loud that he couldn’t hear Cas talking.  Cas carded his hand through Dean’s short, sandy hair gently and Dean closed his eyes, unable to remember the last time he’d been touched with so much love.  He could hear Cas humming along to Led Zeppelin above him and it filled him with a sense of completeness he’d never experienced in his thirty nine years on earth.  He smiled happily and turned his head toward Cas, breathing a sigh into his hip.
Dean drove towards the bunker on autopilot.  In his mind, he replayed his encounter with Billie. He thought of the shelves of notebooks filled with versions of his ultimate end.  Once, those shelves would have filled him with anger and indignation.  He’d have been determined to prove every book wrong, to outlive all the stories.  But now all he saw when he pictured those books was rest.  And a reprieve from the nagging, searing pain he’d felt inside every minute of every day since he’d wrapped Cas’s body in sheer yellow curtain and burned him on a funeral pyre.  He’d tried to outrun it, to ignore it, to drink it away but it had made a permanent home in his chest.  He could feel the grief like a physical pain, nestled deep behind his breastbone.  He’d told Sam he wasn’t okay, that he was far from okay but that felt like the biggest understatement he’d ever known.  He was lost, broken, drowning, and he couldn’t fight anymore.
“I know you’re there.  I can feel you,” he said, desperately trying to keep the fear out of his voice.
“Hello.” The sound came from behind him and Cas turned to see an exact copy of himself staring at him with an air of befuddled hostility. A thousand questions swirled in his mind and Cas selected the one that seemed the most pressing.
“What do you want?” Cas asked wearily.  The entity fairly rippled with anger.  Cas tried desperately to get his bearing as it explained that Cas staying awake meant it had to stay awake and it
The noises were still there. Dean could mostly push them out of his mind but they were still there. He wanted them to shut up. He wanted to go back to sleep. No, not sleep. Because sleep had
Not for the first, Sam thanked Chuck for Jody’s presence in their lives.  When Bobby had died, he and Dean had been adrift and Jody had stepped right into that surrogate parent role without hesitation.  Sam knew she loved them and they couldn’t do without her.  She’d agreed immediately to go help Missouri with the case and Sam was so grateful.  He really believed they needed to stay with Jack and help him through this transition, help him learn how to control those fearsome powers, maybe even learn how to be a human. He had known Dean wouldn’t be happy about this but he hadn’t expected him to refuse to even hear about Sam’s idea of Jack reopening the portal to save their mom.  Sam was worried about his brother.  The rage and fury were expected.  Dean expressed all unpleasant feelings as anger, Sam was well aware of that, but there was a cold, dead look in Dean’s eyes that gave Sam a sick feeling in his stomach.  He could feel this grief was different somehow.  Shaking his head to try to clear it, Sam flicked on the oven and stuck the pan inside.  He hoped he didn’t mess it up.  He was a shitty cook but he ought to be capable of heating up a lasagna.  He shut the oven, turned around and jumped back, crashing his hip into the oven door handle.  Jack was standing directly behind him.  The kid was a goddam ninja! How the hell had he gotten there without a sound? Sam palmed the counter to steady himself.
.  For a long minute, he sat there, glaring at the pencil in the corner, then he sighed, the fight draining from him.  Wearily, he pushed himself away from the table and crossed the room.  He sat down in the corner, next to the pencil and dropped his head to his knees. The next thing he knew, Sam’s heavy footsteps were echoing in the hall and he could hear Sam shouting his name.  The hunter fairly flew into the room, his eyes wide and his voice thick with panic.
“I’m awake again. And you know I can stay awake. Forever if I need to. I’ll bet in that amount of time I can figure out how to wake up some more of the angels here. And the demons. We can have a party.”
Sam Winchester was a man of his word.  He had told Jody that he would fake it when it came to faith and carry his brother and that’s exactly what he was doing.  It had taken him a few days but he’d finally found a case for them. One kid missing and another found wandering down the road bleeding from the head and only able to say one thing:
Dean thought he might come in his pants like a teenager before he ever got a hand on Cas when he rutted against him. His hips bucked hard against Cas’s every time he felt Cas thrust against him, his cock rubbing roughly against his own.  Determined to touch him, Dean grabbed Cas by the jut of his hips, yanked him down again, then reached into his boxers and took Cas’s cock in his hand. God, he felt amazing.  His cock was hard and wet with precome and as Dean closed his fingers around him, it twitched hard in his hand.  Dean looked up at Cas meeting his blue with his own green.  Cas pushed himself into Dean’s hand, his eyes still locked on Dean’s.  Dean let go of him and Cas whimpered softly.
“There’s no way. I looked. I talked to Rowena and Michael. I looked.” His eyes grow wide and panicked and a tiny tendril of hope starts to flicker in him again. Has he been wrong? Did he give up to quickly?
Cas continues, “It will be loud. So loud. No one will be able to sleep. I’ll find the loudest demons to wake.”
“Yeah, Cas?” Dean reached out and touched Cas’s lips softly.  Cas sighed against Dean’s fingers and turned his cheek into Dean’s palm.  Dean skimmed his hand across Cas’s cheek, finger sliding upwards, threading through his thick, dark hair and pulled Cas back in for another kiss.
“Did you mean it?” Cas looks troubled and he glances down at his feet. “I understand if you said it just to get away from the Emp-
In his entire existence, which spanned eons, Castiel had never felt anything that even approached the feeling of Dean Winchester pressing his hard, slick cock against his own and taking them both in his hand.  His vision blurred as Dean stroked them together and he began to tremble uncontrollably.  Dean’s hand began to move faster and faster and his breathing became a rough pant.  Castiel’s vision whited out as his orgasm flooded into his body and he came hard, shoving himself up into Dean’s hand.  Dean came a second later, with a sharp gasp and then a shout of “Castiel!” And then Castiel fell forward onto to him, flushed with sweat, sticky with come and gloriously, ridiculously happy.
It felt good to be behind the wheel again.  Headed out on a case. Working.  Not sitting in his dark room, wallowing.  Dean took a deep breath, inhaling the familiar interior scent of his beloved car.  The Impala smelled like she always did, like leather and Armor-all, with just the faintest undertone of smoke that he had never been able to get rid of.  It must have been the countless times he and Sam had clambered into the long front seat, still reeking of smoke from a salt and burn job.  He’d stopped trying to get rid of the smell actually.  It was as much a part of Baby as the Legos in the vents or the army man in the ashtray.  Dean began to relax a bit.  He reached over and pushed play on the cassette player.  Immediately Robert Plant’s languorous voice slithered from the speakers.
“Lick,” he instructed and Cas complied, wetting Dean’s palm with his tongue. When he was satisfied with the slickness of his hand, Dean pulled on Cas’s hair, tilting his head back up and capturing his mouth with his own as he wrapped his wet hand around both of their lengths together and stroked upward.
“Has he come out at all?” Jody’s face was a study in compassion. “I mean besides to pee and get more alcohol and whatever.”
“Is it about your mom, hon?” Sam sighed softly with gratitude. Maybe Jody could help after all. Maybe he wasn’t a giant, idiot baby for calling her.
“No,” he whispered.  “Let me.  I want to.” Cas nodded again and Dean popped the button open and pulled down the zipper agonizingly slowly.  Hooking his thumbs in the loops, he drew the pants down over Cas’s hips.  Cas toed off his shoes and socks and let Dean slide the pants off his legs.  Then he lay back on the seat dressed in nothing but his orange boxer briefs.
Dean had been worried about seeing Missouri so soon after his roadside breakdown.  He had shoved as much of those feelings down deep and greeted both Missouri and Jody with a smile but Missouri had immediately remarked on his losses.  Dean had glossed over that comment quickly and Missouri hadn’t pushed, bless her.  Of course she was dealing with her own tragedy right now.  Her protégée’s death at the hands of a wraith was devastating enough but the idea that the monster was gunning for her son and granddaughter was clearly the foremost worry in Missouri’s mind.  Dean could still see her face as she implored him to rescue them.
“No,” the entity grimaced in horror as Castiel stepped closer and closer until they were nearly nose to nose.
There was a desperate urgency about Dean’s kisses that pulled hard at Cas’s heart.  He could feel Dean’s fingers tighten in his hair and he pulled the other man close against him and pressed his knee hard against Dean’s legs.  Desire sang along his nerves when Dean opened his legs and rutted against his thigh and his legs buckled slightly. Cas felt himself hardening against Dean’s jeans clad leg and he ground into him.  He’d never felt like anything like this.  He knew he had feelings for Dean, he known for years but he had had no idea what it would feel like to actually touch him this way.  To feel him pressed, hard and insistent, against his own body.  He had no idea that every touch would feel like fire, that his mouth would send bolts of desire, of need, surging through him.  He moaned into Dean’s mouth and felt the warm, slick muscle of Dean’s tongue slide along his own.  He was panting now, gasping, his legs shaking barely holding him up.  He felt Dean’s hand scrabbling down the car’s side, searching for the door handle.  He found it, jerked the door open and then Castiel felt himself spun around and pushed down hard onto Baby’s long, black, leather back seat.
Ten minutes later they are setting up in the infirmary, Sam prattling on about the plan, how it’s going to work, the logistics, the time frame, the method.
“Yeah maybe she can. Or maybe she ends up dead because you wanted to skip out on her to babysit the Antichrist.”
“S’ok.  What’s up? Is it a hunt? You guys need help with a hunt?” Jody’s voice was still heavy with sleep and Sam felt a sharp twinge of guilt for waking her up with his personal problems.
“What a fucking waste,” he spat bitterly.  “We could’ve saved her.  She didn’t have to be all goddam
Before long, Dean found himself on the familiar streets of Lebanon, Kansas.  Soon he would be at the bunker.  Dean was determined to get a grip on himself before he got home.  There was no way he was going to allow himself to let any of this out around Sam.  He didn’t even know where he would begin to explain this.  No, better to let Sam assume they were mourning their mother and Cas in the same way.  To just let him be another one of their dead, no different from the rest of the friends and family they’d lost. He could never explain to Sam how different losing Cas felt.  How it felt like he’d never really be able to breathe again. How just hearing his name sent a dart of pain through him that he felt all the way down his spine.  He could never explain it so he wasn’t going to try.  He was going to go home and swallow this and continue on.
“Before God and Amara, creation, destruction, heaven, hell, your precious little Earth, what was there?” sneered the creature.
“Well, I’m stubborn as the day is long so let’s go save Missouri’s family,” Jody smirked.  Dean shot her a small quick grin as he pulled the Impala onto the off ramp, toward James and Patience and the danger that was coming for them.
“Move the pencil,” he’d said and Jack had sat down immediately, and directed a laser stare at the object, seeming determined to fulfill Sam’s request.  Now through the laptop screen, Sam observed him still sitting at the table, blue eyes fixed hard on that pencil, brow wrinkled with the effort of his fierce attention.  Again, Sam considered how fitting it was that Jack considered Castiel his father.  They really were so alike.  Their mannerism, speech, movements, even their facial expressions all so damn similar.  No wonder Dean couldn’t even stand to look at the kid.  If it was a painful reminder to Sam, it must be like a knife in Dean’s heart to see him cock his head to the side like or squint in confusion at a remark from one of them.  It was probably a good thing that Dean had gone to help Jody with Missouri’s case.  Not because Jody needed him, she was more than capable of handling it on her own.  No, Sam was glad Dean was with Jody because she was exactly the person he needed right now.  Maybe he’d even talk to her, Sam thought wistfully.  He certainly seemed to have no intention of talking to Sam.  It hurt him when Dean shut him out like this but Sam understood.  Some things were so big, so devastating that saying them aloud could break the fragile shell around Dean’s heart.  Sam knew that and so he would wait.  He owed Dean that.
