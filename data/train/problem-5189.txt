As if immensely pleased to hear its name spoken aloud, the Hellhound let loose a skull-rattling roar. Dean scrambled out of the storage unit, grabbing Sam’s hand for a boost.
He doesn’t know how many times they do this, how many peeled sheets of skin it takes to get to his core. Reminds him of a bad joke —
The audacity of these people. Dean was astounded Ellen hadn’t wrung Zachariah’s neck yet, just out of principle. Sucked they’d lost their seals and all, but… they couldn’t possibly be this big of a deal to warrant putting
Sam smiled tightly. “No, we’ll stay—”
“Ketch, no! Allies! I think.” Dean steeled himself as he stared Ketch down, the redshirt still bleary with artificial sleep and jumpy with panic, blinking his eyes dumbly. Dean forced himself to ignore the hot stench radiating off of the Hellhound in front of him. This was the closest he’d been to a beast like this since… since...
He had found it in some planet’s mud a few years ago while Dad was teaching Dean how to hunt a Hellhound. Which you weren’t supposed to do to Hellhounds. You were supposed to just avoid provoking them — Sam had read that in the anthology Dean had given him — but apparently Dean and Dad had never read it because they were really interested in provoking a Hellhound. So Sam had wandered off to provoke the mud with his phaser instead, and he’d blasted up some rocks and found this thing buried there.
in a way — some kind of homeyness. In that sense, the chapel was one of the few places Sam could really feel Mom.
“Even Dad?”
he’d been overtaken and tied up plenty of times on a regular basis. Maybe this was a good thing. Proof he was back in business. And he didn’t even need his red tunic to prove it.
Castiel’s ears rang so loud they drowned out the loud thumping of his own heart.
“I’m sick of your macho act,” Sam continued, pulling out the puppy eyes, which wasn’t fair. “You and Ketch are friggin’ children, Dean. I know you’ve been showing off and one-upping each other since the Academy, but it’s gotta stop somewhere.”
Simple. Blunt. Classic. Dean felt a little stupid. “So you knew all that.”
“Okay then, just ask my permission first,” Dean bargained. “For all of it, really. Just
Dean giggled. He fucking
“So I shouldn’t worry about the imminent destruction of the galaxy,” Ellen clarified.
The flames rise. Crackle. Sing. Silver-blue Grace escapes in spurts and coughs. The Seals in the wall beyond the circle pulse. Their ringing is sweet. The smoke of burning Grace is rotten.
“No, you don’t,” Dean said.
have healed, with the cost of knocking himself out cold for a good thirty minutes, and still required Singer’s services to mend the nerves around the wound. Instead the spike had pierced only organs, which Castiel believed he was particularly gifted at healing, as he could repair them to near perfection with a very efficient energy loss ratio.
I got so wrapped up in hunter lingo I forgot how much they say "aye" in the original series. They're not pirates I promise!
“Yeah, had a feelin’ we’d be counteracting it. They put somethin’ in his system, can’t for the life of me tell what it is. Jesus, the nerve damage here — sonic separator, please.”
“That is a little strange,” Castiel agreed, “albeit somewhat endearing. You singing in your sleep must be a projection of your rehearsals.”
“A proposal?” Harvelle raised an eyebrow.
“To put it crudely. As I said, unexciting. There is not much about me you do not already know.”
Cas cocked his head, his vividly blue eyes locked onto Dean’s. “If I described working with you… as ‘creepy’...” he paused as if expecting Dean to lash out. “Would I be using the term appropriately?”
“I’m leading the talk today,” he admitted, his smile twitching weakly with that stupid nervous hope.
“Yeah, Meg’s handwriting,” Ruby said. “I tried to intercept her in the jungle, but she got me with your crew, and—”
Captain Ellen Harvelle strolled into the transporter room just as the landing party’s molecules were rearranging themselves back into their proper forms. Her arms were folded and her face was set and Dean didn’t need to be a trained Starfleet officer to know which order would come out of her mouth first.
type cartoony, but definitely a male voice, and, uh… don’t know what exactly he said, really. But, you know, it was totally creepy.”
“Greens that neon are just… not natural,” Dean scoffed as he took in the trees’ giant, squarish leaves.
“Lucifer was
Ah. Yes. This was the old “arguing tenderly about each others’ character flaws” routine, when they wandered into that dicey territory between normal family dispute and complete existential crisis. They hadn't had the opportunity to do this since Dad died. Dean had been too busy lately, what with a Seraph constantly leafing through all of his personal business, to think about bringing up any of it with his brother.
The eeriest part was he had no idea if it was actually a flashback or worse: some kind of a vision. Or
“I understand the consequences,” Castiel said. “But the Great Father will steer me from corruption. I have faith.”
,” Dean said unhappily. He straightened in the biobed, expression darkening to a pointedly hostile glower. “S’when they let
“You knew we were down here and you just let us hang around?” Jo scoffed. “For four hours?”
“Where’s the trench coat?” Dean asked as he got out of the car, awkwardly pretending to rub his eyebrow to hide the red dents on his face. Castiel was planted in the doorway of the garage, arms frozen at his sides, expression completely unreadable — a normal occurrence in every way, besides the fact that he was wearing fuzzy pajamas. “What’s with the ‘fit?”
Unreal.
“We really have to every time?” Dean whined.
“You can have it,” Sam said. He savored the glow that lit up his brother’s face.
With the elders’ guidance, you completed a procedure wherein the memories Mister Winchester held from his time in the Rack facilities could be buried within his own mind and blocked from his consciousness, allowing him to awaken. He will now finish recovery with the intent to return to his duties as navigator of the
UNIFORMS
Ellen raised an eyebrow. “You’re wearing the latest fashion rather proudly.”
, and something was sticking out through his black pant leg that looked way too much like bone. Dean dragged himself up to Sam, his ankle smarting the whole way, but when he saw his brother’s face — his eyes squeezed shut, his cheeks so pale — all he could feel was his heart falling to pieces.
I've tried to write the story so this is clear already, but just in case, I shall reiterate: these Klingons are like those of the TOS canon, not TNG and beyond. So, no ridged foreheads and bushy eyebrows, and their culture is a bit less complex and refined than it is later on. They sure are proud, warlike, and principled, but they're just... bitchier. Less Samurai-like, as they are in later Trek, and more totalitarian dickbags. You know the ones from The Trouble with Tribbles? Yeah. Them.
Sam shook his head. The brothers made their way to the turbolift in silence, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. For the first time in a while, actually, Sam was starting to feel calm. Grateful, almost. When the scarlet turbolift doors shut behind them, Sam smiled.
“I don’t know.” Dean looked away. Cas was making that face again. The sad one. He didn’t like looking at it. “There’s gotta be something we can do.”
faces and follow the Word as he was made to do. He would like to please his Father. He is not a quitter.
“See?
Jody relaxed and rubbed her temples harder. “
“I would rather not give you reason to doubt my credentials.”
Finally they reached the Sick Bay doors, which were shut, but a small and very messy crowd had formed around the entryway. This group of officers was distinct from those who populated the busy hallways. Most boasted several gold bands on their arms. They were also bloodier, some suffering wounds. The tallest, in blue, was hysterical, the others holding him back from battering the Sick Bay doors down.
* * *
Kevin fake-wretched and, even though Sam felt the same, he couldn’t not laugh. The absolute horror of that implication — Dean would go apeshit.
“Thanks,” Dean said automatically, even though he knew it was weird. When Castiel didn’t break eye contact for a few moments, Dean rolled his eyes and pushed past him to go inside. “C’mon. My rice krispies aren’t going to snap, crackle, and pop themselves.”
“Dean is absolutely fine,” Jo scoffed. She was helping Charlie get Kevin, still crying and trembling, to stand up. “So are we, and so is Kevin, no matter what he says.”
This chapter was supposed to have twice as much content as it ended up having but I think it worked out better this way. Sometimes I try to cram too much in at once. As I'm sure you all have noticed. :D (Also sorry for the chapter re-upload, I made some edits.)
annoying that he was causing his brainwaves to malfunction.
As Nurse Jones handed the device to the doctor, Castiel studied the K3 monitor. Every slow blink of the “pulse” light was accompanied by a deep, throbbing tone. The pain and function indicators for the lungs and brain were hovering in the dangerous red zones of their charts. Castiel had heard of those who recovered from vitals this bad before, but he had never seen it accomplished in the flesh.
* * *
Castiel had learned at the Academy that humans formed trust with others who initiated physical contact. As he and Dean started to step off their landing pads, Castiel trusted an instinct, and reached out to softly touch his shoulder while they walked.
“That arm,” Nurse Mills interrupted, mostly composed again. “We might have to amputate. All his limbs are in rough shape. It’s like they were playing butchershop.”
He pulled out the photo and gave it to Cas, who held the image like a fragile document. Mom was pregnant with Sammy in that picture, but you couldn’t tell unless you knew what date it was taken, because she was hugging Dean against her bump. He had just turned four and his hair, chopped in a straight line above his eyebrows, was still the kind of blonde that blinded people in sunlight. Now with his hair all silty, Dean more closely resembled his dad, but at age four he could’ve been his mom’s little clone.
“I’m not going,” Dean said, his back turned, fully aware that his attempt to be dramatic was not in the least subtle.
Castiel allowed himself a glance at the patient’s face. It truly looked horrible. There were no words.
“Come on. Nothing to wash it down?” Dean wheezed.
“No, I mean—” Castiel watched Dean’s chest rise and fall. “His mind has been broken. I will fix it. I am going to read his mind— I have tried before, but perhaps I will be more successful now that he has—”
“Rendezvous point,” Ellen said. “We’re dropping off the Seal with Zachariah, and then first thing in the morning we’re jumping several parsecs to a space station.”
Every day, though it was pointless and exhausting, he tried to pry into Dean Winchester’s mind, to help ease him back into consciousness. He was stable enough now, physically, that consciousness was truly their next goal; far from fear of death and at risk only of pain that Doctor Singer’s medications would dull to easily tolerable levels, the only thing left to lose was, as Lt. Commander Bradbury had put it, “what made Dean
"To Hell with the oldest rule," Rufus harrumphed. He shot a glare at Dean, as well. “The legacy of your daddy is counting on me, and I keep my word, boy. If either of you fuck up, I’m blaming
“No,” Castiel said. “I will come out.”
Two in one day — some Elasian king was apparently pretty greedy when Bela Talbot was dealing out her spoils and took two Seals for himself. Unfortunately for him, his bargaining skills were shit, and Ellen and the crew revoked his prize without any trouble. It was almost as quick as the space station mission, and much like that last milk run, there wasn’t even violence involved this time.
Sam felt his throat closing up. “I cry a lot.”
That name again. Dean, forgetting his ankle, took a step forward, regretting it immediately. “Who is Lucifer?” He barked through the pain.
“Now,
“They are,” Castiel reassured him.
Gold = command
“He lent you my-” Dean frowned, then stopped. “That’s a weird thing for Sam to suggest. Usually he’s the mindfulness guru gung-ho about wellness.”
“Rather impatient in the heat, these humans, no?” Crowley said, levelling his gaze at Dean, his round eyes so intense Dean didn’t even register the height difference.
Are you… is it your head?”
“I didn’t see the logic in waiting for a temporary balm,” he explained hastily. “You may scan him, of course, but he is healed.”
“We miss you, kiddo,” Zachariah chirped.
Baby was a good thing. That smell — Dean took a good sniff just to be sure he wasn’t hallucinating — was a good thing. Sitting in his Baby, alone, just him and the car and the garage surrounding them, was a good thing. Dean grew up in this car, lived in this car. When he had nightmares, he slept in Baby’s backseat instead of his own bedroom. The virus could take the road from him, take hunting from him, take his life from him, but it couldn’t take his car. Baby was his routine.
“Yes, you have a point,” Meg said lightly, pursing her lips. “You two I don’t need.” She whipped a disruptor gun from her belt loop and pointed it straight at Dean.
He and Dean went unacknowledged as they swiftly, silently moved from the entryway to their seats at the helm, aside from Claire and Ensign Jones leaving their temporary positions as their substitutes to allow them to sit down. Ellen was in mid-conversation with Naomi, and as Sam situated himself, trying to keep his movements as unobtrusive as possible, he tuned in.
“Bull. Y’all live for hundreds of years and invented a crazy complex religion, you’ve gotta have some juicy deets in there.”
“Endurance, Dean,” he said. “Stamina.”
Ellen chuckled. “Real slick, Lieutenant Commander, but you’re not getting back on the security team that easily. No helmsman should have that much power.” Just as Dean began to protest, Ellen cut him off. “All you’ve done is prove to me that I made the right decision swapping your responsibilities. Which leads me to my next question.” She took a step out, addressing the entire landing party. “What is wrong with all of you?”
Sam shrugged.
Dean’s cheeks burned. Castiel wasn’t his fucking mother. He directed his anger at Ketch in a seething glare and marched into position as part of the semicircle, ignoring Sam when he tossed Dean a bright smile.
“No chances,” Harvelle said, approaching Castiel and taking the tricorder from his hands. She handed it to Mister Ketch, who seemed to be enjoying watching the drama unfold. “Castiel, your orders are to take Dean up to sickbay, do your routine thing, and then report back to me.”
“Y’all know each other?” Garth asked, his expression mirroring Sam’s.
“Yeah?” Dean raised an eyebrow. “That what you do?”
The other tentacle wrapped around his throat and Dean’s hands shot up to pry it off, but the grip was vice-like, he couldn’t breathe, and — oh, fuck, this was
“These were unprompted flashbacks?” Singer checked.
Dean got to his feet, helping Castiel up but avoiding eye contact with him — something about the fact that the Seraph grew so weak after a healing was deeply unsettling to him — and glared at Ruby. His mind much clearer now that it was free of the burden of pain, Dean finally noticed the dark welt on the Klingon’s temple.
“Ow! Fuck,” Dean swore as he struggled to regain his footing, snatching his arm away. “What the fuck!”
“Thought I was in time-out. Am I gonna get spanked?”
Somebody yanked Sam to his feet and he caught onto them — Rufus — to steady himself. The stench of rotted meat and dog breath was overpowering and Sam gasped as the Hellhound lurched about just yards away from him, snapping its giant jaws at the security officers firing at it valiantly.
“...Nipples,” Dean was saying, and then dropped his head back, eyelids fluttering shut. Castiel discretely touched the flesh around Dean’s wound, concentrating on the damage, while Sam shook Dean’s shoulders and began to cry.
“Alarm?” Ellen supplied. Ash grunted in confirmation.
The pale Seraph strode across the bridge, barging past a positively befuddled Kevin, to reach the science station. Castiel looked at Zachariah’s chest instead of his eyes, impassive as a machine, as the taller Seraph looked him up and down.
Sam drew his legs up and crossed them. The brothers sat in silence for a little while, thinking. Sam’s chest felt tight, like it was squeezing the beats out of his heart. Like his body was preparing for an emergency, and he needed to find a place to hide. There was nowhere to hide in the dead of space.
“You must excuse my enthusiasm,” Zachariah said. “I find all of this remarkably amusing.” On
Chuck coughed. “What’s Project Genesis?”
“Even Meg, who I despise, has the presence of intellect to study Terran culture as thoroughly as ancient children’s literature,” Crowley sneered with a distasteful glance at the female Klingon, still frozen in that soft glowing bubble. “No wonder you believe you descended from apes. Feral, the lot of you.”
Castiel scanned the officers who were now all clamoring to face him — aside from the tall one in blue, who was running his hands through his hair, leaning against a wall.
For the past two hours, Rufus, Sam, Dean, and three security officers had been bargaining with Chancellor Alastair and his less-than-attentive council on the logistics of a new Federation-sanctioned trading outpost. Alastair was the ugliest Klingon Sam had ever seen — rotten teeth, gangrenous lips, bony limbs, witch-like fingers — but he was also the only one who had listened. And luckily, his vote was the only one that mattered.
” Ellen exclaimed.
Sam swallowed.
Sam smiled proudly, even though his face was still puffy and hot from the final throes of his tantrum.
. And… and opportunities to talk about your feelings with somebody who didn’t
to tell you,” Dean insisted, smiling. “It’s like fuckin’— you feel it all buzzing inside— like he’s touchin’ me and it’s all warm and gooey in there—”
Castiel held up the tricorder in confirmation. “Lieutenant Commander Winchester is telling the truth,” he reported. “He’s plotted all the traps around this area of the building. And these gracion readings — he's found strong evidence of the Seal."
“That’s the Seal?” Dean scoffed. “Ugly.”
The beast was eight feet tall at the shoulder, rippling with muscle, drool flying from its enormous muzzle as it gnashed its teeth in the air. Facts Sam had memorized as a kid flashed through his mind:
“Oh, trust me, Ensign, they won’t be hearing the end of this one for a long time.” Ellen narrowed her eyes at Ash in particular, who had been chilling behind the transporter machine picking at a hangnail to avoid being dragged into it. He glanced up at Ellen and pursed his lips.
The blades carve into him slowly, descending in complete synchronization. Figure skating. There are three today. Maybe more. He can’t tell because he thinks his eyes are inside out, like watching himself be dissected through the reflection of a spoon.
Cas was quiet for a moment. “Creepy?”
“No,” Dean repeated.
Dean was still hundreds of yards away at the tunnel entrance; he hadn’t been with the security officers running after him. His EV helmet was gone, the silvery suit partially ripped off, geysers of flame forming a barricade between him and Sam. Dean was being attacked: not by a Hellhound, but by a group of men.
Dean shrugged. “Sometimes, when he’s…” he swallowed. “Yeah, but, not a lot.”
No. Dean had not been Dean after Gehenna, not physically, not psychologically. But Sam was still Sam. He would be fine. And Dean was fine. Everything was fine.
Cas shook his head and pointed to Dean’s chest. “No. But green does offer you greater complement.”
He looks away but it hurts, it fucking
Singer pursed his lips, as if considering it, and then dropped the expression and threw his hands in the air with exasperation. “You were
Dean turned. Castiel was gazing straight at Dean, not bothering to look around at the room’s decor, even though it was the first time he’d ever been in Dean’s private quarters. It was respectful, in a way. But also weird. But the kind of weird that didn’t bother Dean so much anymore because he was getting used to it.
“The Seal would be too detectible, and powerful, without the warding,” Castiel said.
Castiel was still eight feet away, dutifully heeding Dean’s
“It’s too late,” Rufus yelled over the roar of blazing geysers. “I can’t lose you, too!”
His voice broke completely before he could finish the sentence, and he stepped away, hyperventilating, rubbing his hands over his face.
“Excellent,” Ellen said. “Onward.”
Dean’s face reddened, but not in an angry way, which was new. It was so new that Castiel, completely focused on observing this fascinating reaction for his list of perplexities, didn’t even notice Captain Harvelle approach him from behind.
“But on Gehenna — Chancellor Alastair…?” Sam prompted.
The engineer — Commander Ash — looked at Castiel. Castiel looked back.
“Please,” Crowley said. “I’m a Klingon intensely interested in the diddlings of Starfleet. You think I wouldn’t recognize the one Seraph currently in their rotation?”
And Sammy was safe. And the last thought, the very last thought Dean could still remember, was of the thrilling embrace Rufus would give him when he escaped from this mess.
“That bastard healed me,” Dean snapped.
Sam slammed the door to his quarters and burst into tears.
The archive was visualized like a flow chart in Castiel’s mind: a smorgasbord of boxed categories and lengthy bulletins woven together with color-coded arrows. There was a section on gender roles, an article on eating habits, and a stipulation on humans’ jarring lack of proper instincts, but by far the largest portion of Castiel’s list of conundrums was dedicated to the concept of emotion.
Dean was flailing his arms, which meant he was in the middle of complaining, and Castiel was stiff as a rod. They stopped at Dean’s room, but the conversation carried on. Dean pointed fingers and rolled his eyes and moved his head around so fast it might fly off his neck. Castiel simply observed. Finally, Sam read the Seraph’s lips —
Castiel stopped a respectful yard from the table, hands clasped behind his back and head cocked in what might have been intended as a greeting. Sam couldn’t help but admire the variation of Seraphim personalities he’d seen despite all the stories John had told him. Uriel’s apathy ran cold and smooth, whereas Zachariah’s was like a flaming centrifuge. Castiel was like a swan had been stuffed into a bipedal body and was being forced to pose as a humanoid.
Captain Harvelle smiled at Ketch. “We're working on it.”
had to cringe at his patheticness. Castiel simply raised an eyebrow and extended his hand towards Dean.
“And why not?” If Bobby continued giving Dean that stink-eye, he was going to be leaving this sick bay with some severe self-respect issues.
“Emotions cannot be controlled?” Castiel asked.
Dean shuddered and flushed.
“Sometimes,” Anna said calmly, like a lullaby, “the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.”
“I would rather ‘ransack’ your mind with your permission,” he answered honestly.
Sam whipped around, searching through the turmoil. The Hellhound… where had it come from? And where was—
Naomi took a moment before responding again. “The Council will discuss how to proceed. In the meantime, carry on with your tasks. We will alert you when we have reached a decision.”
“That’s cool, Cas. Why dream catchers? You trying to figure out what’s making me sing in my sleep?”
Sam’s face had been flushed to begin with, but now he was beet-red. From horror or flattery was impossible to tell.
This kind of task was always unpleasant, and he had never attempted a healing of this scale, but it was good to feel useful. It was good to be proud. It was good to feel one was doing right. Confirming the position of the chair behind him, Castiel took a deep breath and pressed two fingers against Dean Winchester’s forehead. With a prayer to the Great Father, his Grace breached the gap between their bodies.
Castiel introduced himself to the bridge. While most officers — with the exception of navigator Sam Winchester, who was absent — manned their stations, every single one stared with a blank bleakness Castiel had grown to understand was rather undesirable in humans. The
“Nothing. Which happens to be the problem.” Castiel blinked. His blinks were few and far between, but when they did occur, they were glaringly sharp. Sam was beginning to think Castiel had to make a conscious effort to force his eyelids to close. “It has been fourteen hours since he slammed the door on me. He still will not leave his quarters.”
Jody shrugged. "If I don't have to patch anybody up when you go storming in, I'm all for it."
to feel bad.”
“I see.” Castiel felt a headache coming on. “What sort of phrases shall I become acquainted with?”
“Fresh piece’a ass,” Dean slurred, then giggled hysterically.
, beneath the blotted lights and flashes of knives and faceless figures looming, holding, prying, peering, touching touching touching.
Dean Winchester glared. Castiel stared placidly back. If that pain killer did not kick in soon, Castiel was going to have a very long day.
“Yes, it would have,” Castiel said flatly.
by you being here.”
Kevin grimaced and averted his eyes. “Dude. Why are your tits out.”
“Hand me a scalpel, Doctor Badass,” Ash muttered to himself as he got back on his hands and knees. He began heating the panel’s lock with his adjusted phaser. “Just a simple incision here…”
Dean stared at the wall glumly.
Mystery seemed to lurk in every storage compartment — space stations had always made Dean feel like he was on some kind of top secret treasure hunt. A troupe of thespians were performing in a lounge, wearing egg-shaped pins on their pastel lapels and ridiculous side ponytails, playing six-stringed circular harps. Travelling merchants lined the counters of the cafes, desperate to interest the Starfleet officers in their dazzlingly colorful odds and ends — it took Dean thirty minutes of the two hour mission to convince Charlie not to purchase a tribble from one in a green coat.
stare Castiel dead in the face while it was happening, like the visual connection was as integral to the mind-reading as the physical contact.
“Isn’t that called gaslighting?” Sam challenged impishly.
Having no clue whether Sam was insulting or complimenting him, Dean responded rudely just to be safe.
“And by the way, might wanna scrub your mouth out with that burger,” Sam added.
“They cannot wait for you to join them, it seems,” Naomi commented, trailing Castiel to the transportation pad at the back of the bridge. “They are desperately in need of your stoic wisdom.”
Castiel studied Dean, his pulse pounding in his head with the prolonged eye contact. He needed to get away from this human for his
“Seven thousand confirmed cases in the states,” Sam said, “and 141 deaths. Over 214,000 cases globally. Jesus, 475 people died in Italy in the last twenty-four hours.”
Jo wiggled her eyebrows at Chuck. “I mean, I
Crowley slowly swept an arm toward Meg. “I thought that was obvious.”
“What does it mean, ‘fuck you’?”
“A pleasure. Sam. Dean. Cas.” He showed no sign of naivety nor suspicion, all cool and collected and a thousand percent at ease.
But it was
“Great, nice to meet you,” Sam said, and wiggled his phaser. “Now spill.”
Castiel’s head was spinning from the amount of energy he’d used to repair the damage. He feebly gestured toward the discarded bloody spike.
Castiel caught Dean in his double-take and dipped his chin towards him, his wide blue eyes bugging out beneath his sharp eyebrows. The gesture was undoubtedly intended as a greeting, but came off as a predatory glower of intimidation. Dean had never suffered from sleep paralysis demons like Sam, but he imagined the effect was similar.
It took everything Dean had not to respond with an anecdote about the separation of church and state on Earth.
“Mister Winchester preferred that I didn’t,” Castiel said, blankly observing Bobby’s ministrations over Dean. He was standing a yard away, directly in front of where Dean was perched at the edge of the biobed, his arms limp and straight at his sides, his head cocked just ever so slightly. His automatic pose of relaxation was so unnatural and stiff that Dean sometimes wondered if the Seraph was not actually a Seraph but instead some ghostlike entity trapped in a body, some weird apparition with terrifying powers that wouldn’t keep his nose out of Dean’s business. Dean had been informed that was just how Seraphim were. Lacking a frame of reference (beyond the horror stories he’d heard from his father), Dean remained skeptical.
Castiel’s hands shook. He pressed them against the cool table and tried not to think about the soft pattern of Dean’s freckles beneath his fingertips and the sharp echoes of Dean’s screams in his mind.
. It’s… you should see a Seraph bicker. It’s very pathetic. And Dean, he’s… well, he’s Dean.”
“Didn’t mean to scare you,” Singer said gently, putting a hand on Dean’s arm. Dean did not recoil, nor did he call him a “creep.” Castiel felt a hot twinge in his stomach, jolting him enough to disrupt his thought process. It was likely just a side effect of his impatience to return to the mission. “I would rather you tell us yourself, Dean. If you’re communicating, I’m trusting you.” The doctor turned his gaze to Castiel for his opinion. “Commander?”
Castiel straightened at Dean’s side. He seemed to have gotten some strength back, but his face was still pale.
“Ketch is guarding the tunnel entrance,” Sam said. “We’ve been waiting it out all night, to avoid excessive conflict. We knew where you were, we just couldn’t get in until a guard had come down to feed you.”
Ellen turned. “Who are they?”
“All Castiel knows is obey orders, read my mind, pray to the Great Father, sleep, and repeat,” Dean said. “He doesn’t care if I live or die.”
“Alright,” Sam said. The tone in his voice reassured Dean that his brother was on at least the same page, if not the page ahead of him. “We’ve established who you are. And why we should trust you. But you still haven’t explained why you’re
And Sam and Dean felt it all become nothing but a memory.
“Big-kid-little-kid,” Sam corrected.
“Klingons manipulate,” Ketch countered, his hand at his belt.
Kevin glared at Dean, then spat something vicious in what sounded like a combination of Ferengi and Romulan before dramatically turning his head away to pout at the other wall.
“Hiya, Sammy,” Dean greeted him, letting the navigator snatch him into a rib-crushing embrace. Dean coughed and Sam, assuming injury, released him instantly.
as if I was
to accept your new position as First Officer, replacing Commander Rufus Turner, who died in a rescue mission of equivocal legality on the Klingon penal colony of Gehenna.
Rufus leaned in close. Sam knew if they weren’t wearing these ridiculous helmets, there would be spit flying between them.
Harvelle took a deep breath that rattled her whole body. “I don’t know what to do.”
“No one’s been inside in a month,” Fitzgerald said. “Although he never really let— lets— anyone in his room, anyway.”
“No,” Dean said. He looked down at his bowl and stirred his cereal around, trying to get the kernels to disintegrate in the milk.
“Okay, I get it,” Dean said. Leave it to Sam to prove that no matter how sad Dean was, he could always get sadder.
“His brother is coming,” Castiel said. He sensed Lieutenant Winchester outside the door, his energy frantic enough to resonate in Castiel’s ears. “We finish here, and then we can strategize about—”
“Put them on screen,” Ellen ordered Kevin
“No, that’s how his face always looks,” Castiel said. Dean shot him a glare, but Castiel’s mouth was flat and his eyes calm. Either he was getting better at sarcasm or the hyperbole had gone completely over his head.
Dean was in hell. He had no idea what was happening; one moment he’d been hiding in the shade of his boulder, using his tricorder to plot a path through the deadly traps, the next moment it was as if he’d been paralyzed in his own mind. The world around him spun in and out of focus, clipping between the scene of a building in grassy hills to a dark room filled with leering faces. His limbs were stiff, his pulse was pounding, he helplessly dropped to his knees as a voice echoed through his head.
But Castiel was right; aside from those words, Dean didn’t remember enough to be any more bothered yet about his deep-freeze trauma. He had already assumed he’d been tortured in a dark room and that there must’ve been creepy silhouettes taunting him, so… it wasn’t dangerous to confirm that had actually happened, right?
blah blah blah ad infinitum. The only people allowed in Dean’s quarters were the Random Alien of the Week and sometimes Sam, on good days. Or really bad days. Really good or really bad days. Right now, Dean just wanted to have a plain old
Sam’s injury was not so minor. His lower leg was bent in a direction that was gut-wrenchingly
Jo leaned forward. “But if the rumors are true, and Project Genesis is the galaxy’s endgame, what side do you choose? Klingons or Seraphim? Or would you stick with the Starfleet humans?”
Castiel nodded. He could not remember what happened in his private trials, where they had occurred, or even how long he had spent there. All he knew was he had gone straight from his trials to this journey to the
in the first place.”
“Yes,” Castiel hollered back, and
Castiel’s head began to ache slightly. Although he knew his orders and the predicament he was about to be thrust into, something about the details of the emergency — the Winchester boy — tore at his brain. His fist tightened.
“That’s insane,” Sam gasped, staring at the biobed. “Commander, I— Bobby— Look at him. That’s
“Fuck.” Dean hastily corked the thing and locked the safe, shoving it deeper under his bed. His throat was still burning and he hoped to high hell he wasn’t gonna open the door and find Ellen there to greet his alcohol flush. “Dean’s residency,” he hollered towards the door.
told him that.
” She giggled as Dean kicked at her, viciously swiping back and nailing him in the thigh with the heel of her boot.
Pinch. Time probably passes. The Face’s fingers roam about while the needle gets to work. And when it does work, it’s something new this time, some drug that spins the room around him until it blurs like a Bussard ramscoop. He has no idea what a “Bussard ramscoop” is, but the word pops into his head, and he clings to it, even though it’s probably utter nonsense, because he’s spinning so fast and there’s nothing else to hold onto and clear thoughts come so infrequently now that when you think them you just have to
Harvelle smiled at him with a strange tilt of her head. Castiel almost regretted that he couldn’t understand what that look meant. He glanced at Sam, who was still hovering with the Seal cradled in his arms. Castiel restrained himself from going up to him and checking over its contents for damage or tampering. Naomi’s mantras took over again.
“I’m really glad Castiel is here,” he forced out. “I thought I could protect Dean. He did it for me all these years and it was my turn, right? But I get hurt too, and I’m just…”
They were sitting on opposite sides of a plateaued boulder in a small cave, taking a brief break from their long trek towards the seventh Seal, the rest of the landing party milling about outside. Dean, facing the cave entrance, was illuminated by a bright swatch of light. He licked his weirdly-shaped lips, shook his head, and furrowed his brow — this was the face he made when preserving his dignity. He pushed up his sleeve, even though it was already bunched up over his bicep after having pushed it up several minutes ago.
Dean spun on him, swatting Castiel’s hand away. “Stop friggin’ touching me, you

The security officer Arthur Ketch, who obviously had much more experience in the field and in gruelling conditions than Sam Winchester, gave a slightly more cohesive report of the Gehenna mission. While his emotions still impaired his ability to express an accurate account of what happened, it was most fascinating that Mister Ketch agreed, almost verbatim, with Mister Winchester’s claim that the entire situation had conspiratorial undertones. Melkotians should not logically have been on Gehenna, let alone working within The Rack, and the insinuations that the torturers relinquished the victim to the
” Ketch hollered, choosing that exact instant to gain consciousness, bolt upright on Dybbuk’s back, and aim his gun at Crowley.
“Castiel.”
“Alright, enough, boys,” Ellen ordered. “Let me talk to Castiel for a moment in peace, and then I’ll deal with whatever’s going on here.”
Sam Winchester spoke of gratitude and grief and guilt. Castiel remembered the way Sam, covered in Klingon blood at the interrogation table, had cursed so profanely at him when they first met. How Castiel, at the time, was just waiting for the moment Captain Harvelle would dismiss him to Sick Bay so he could examine the torture victim at the center of it all.
“Exactly what role does he play between the factions?” Castiel asked.
Dean turned around. This concerned face of Castiel’s had to be an act.
in agony, throwing her head back and yanking on her chains.
Sam smiled. He liked Chuck, and he liked how strongly he valued precision of language. The guy was a great storyteller. Which probably was an important quality to have as an interplanetary ambassador, what with having to construct appealing arguments and quickly adapt to opposition and… whatever else ambassadors did.
“But you were—” Dean sucked back a yelp, shutting his eyes against the stars in his vision. “Only if you’re better now.”
Dean blinked at Sam and put the amulet around his neck. “Wow, what a nice amulet. Thanks, Sammy.”
“Shut your whore mouth,” Rufus muttered, leaving Sam’s personal space and continuing down the plateau. Sam noticed Dean was brushing his fingers over the indentation on his chest, where his amulet was nestled under his EV suit.
Relationships with Klingons on their home planet Kronos were rocky enough nowadays, especially after the political uprising several years ago that had shook the planet. So relationships with Klingon
“My opinion is that the law should be obeyed.”
“He’s right, Captain,” Dean clapped his arm around Ketch’s shoulders, shifting his gaze away from the security officer’s cold and intelligent eyes, gesturing to his wound with his free hand. “
“Let’s not cross that bridge when we don’t come to it,” Sam said. Dean smiled.
“I would like to proceed with the examination,” Castiel said flatly, and Dean had to give it to him: he was patient, and he was precise, and he knew when to get a show on the road. Even if it would kill him to laugh at one shitty joke.
“New extremists arose, as they do.” Crowley said. “And factions with them. The vast majority are those desperate to maintain the status quo, but they lack a real leader. And then there are the progressives — or rather, practical-minded atheists, followers of—” he did a tiny curtsy, “—yours truly. And then there are the fanatics, like Meg here: Neo-conservative religious zealots who adored Azazel, intent on reviving our old ways, followers of our newest psychopath, Lilith. But I believe Starfleet knew the gist of all this, what with your recent efforts to reach out to Gehenna.”
Captain Ellen Harvelle did not meet Castiel upon his arrival in the transporter room as per custom. He was instead greeted by two engineers. Their eyes were wide and faces pale but it did not seem to be Castiel they were afraid of.
Naomi remained silent.
Baby always smelled the same. It didn’t matter if she was in the garage, on the highway, or (God forbid) in a ditch, but she always smelled the same. Leather. Oil. Gasoline. Aftershave. Gunpowder. Beer. A whiff of monster guts. Cheeseburgers from lunches on the road. That weird woodsy smell that follows Castiel everywhere. Sam’s shampoo.
“It was merely an observation.”
Castiel clasped his hands behind his back. “I am Commander Castiel. Your new First Officer.”
“...Sure,” Sam said. Because that more or less sounded legit. And Castiel was staring directly into Sam’s eyes instead of looking above his head, which probably meant something was wrong. “What’s the matter, Commander?”
“They kicked us out,” a woman with red hair said. “Won’t let us see him.”
“Of course,” Bobby said, a sharp
“Welcome,” Sam smiled. And then Dean scooched closer on the bed, wrapped an arm over Sam’s shoulders, and hugged him into his side. Sam stiffened; they didn’t hug a lot, and Dean kind of smelled like onions, since he still refused to accept “becoming a man” meant he should use deodorant now. But the amulet looked right sitting around Dean’s neck. Like it had found its real home.
and I got no problemo diggin’ it out. We just gotta mow some grass.” He tossed back his mullet to let some air on his neck and looked to Castiel. “Confirmation, Mister Castiel?”
Dean looked like he was about to explode. “Aye, sir.”
“Fine,” Dean said. He paused. “You still can’t say ‘bitch’. You can say ‘jerk’ though.”
“I’m Doctor Singer,” he said, and jerked his head at the other two officers. “Nurse Mills and Jones. Hand me that hypospray.”
“Then maybe you should stop drinking tea before bed.”
He walked away down the hall, flooded with an irkingly human relief at the realization he would finally be alone.
His left hand was clenched in a fist at his side. He could not open it. He did not know why.
The last thing Dean could still remember from his capture was a horrific image at the moment he was pulled down: Rufus pushing Sam to safety, protecting him from an onslaught of savage aliens, holding that sobbing wreck of a man back as if he were his own child. The last thing Dean could still remember were the tears glistening over Sam’s twisted face and the look in Rufus’ eyes, the promise that shone there, a droning assurance.
” Ellen repeated. Her face was white with fear.
. “Mister Winchester, you are very intent on forbidding me to do my job.”
in a way it never had after a healing. There was something… something he felt he should remember. Something smoky, something different, something wrong. Castiel turned his head to stare at Dean Winchester’s face, the shiny curved eyelids and distinctly shaped lips. Castiel remembered the string of nonsense words Dean had muttered yesterday that he did not know, but knew he should have.
“Rosencians are a punctual species,” Castiel explained, shutting off his tricorder and pulling out his communicator. “They eat their first meal at 0600 hours, and per custom, that happens to be the one meal during which they feed their prisoners. We did not bother to retrieve you sooner because Rosencians do not harm their prisoners unless provoked.” Castiel made a display of turning his head from the unconscious guard on the cave floor to a deeply accusatory glare at Dean. “Physically
“I don’t think we should have been able to find him,” Winchester said. “That place is a… your worst nightmare. The fact that Dean’s still alive means something’s really wrong.”
was there?”
What would his mother say to him in this situation? Would she agree? Would she refute him? Would he get in trouble for failing his brother or would… would she try to convince him it wasn’t his fault? And would that even help?
. Fascinating. “Starfleet says these are gold.”
. Gabriel did not tell this to the little soldiers. He was not the one who helped them believe it. He did not believe it and neither does the good little soldier. But the good little soldier wishes he could. He does not want to escape in spurts and coughs. He would like to find his friends’ — his
The Winchesters had become, so to speak, the Cavia porcellus of this concentration of his studies.
Shurlion was one of those Class M planets that looked exactly like Earth if Pangea had broke apart at a different time in different places, complete with big blue oceans, arctic tundras, humid wastelands, and a population of various shades of brown that had nearly polluted their home to death. Besides the fact that the planet was plopped at the edge of a neutral no-starships zone, there was nothing exciting about the trip to return the Ambassador — and at Warp 4, Ellen seemed perfectly content taking her sweet-ass time to get there.
Sam stopped. “Physically? What did he do now?”
-worse, a real-time broadcast he was somehow tuned into.
"My sensors indicate several buildings beyond these hills," Sam said, shoving past a still-kicking Dean to show his readings to Ellen.
“Our households aren’t exactly on speaking terms,” Dean said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean— woke up,” Castiel fumbled.
Everybody was treading lightly around him now, but Dean kinda thought they should be worshipping him. Four weeks in the most dangerous corner of the galaxy, and he was fine. Granted, he was “fine” after a month of intense physical therapy in sick bay and a disturbing procedure to bury his memories of the trauma so that he could function again. But he was alive. And instead of rewarding him status as the most badass redshirt ever, which Dean believed he had rightfully earned, Captain Ellen Harvelle had stripped him of his security privileges and demoted him to a freaking goldie.
“Well, I don’t,” said Dean, who was two heartbeats of residual John Winchester panic away from just phasering this dude and beaming the party back up already. “What the hell is going on?”
“Thank you,” Castiel forced out as Sam stood. Sam said goodbye to the lunch table and started to head toward the portside door.
As Chuck nodded understandingly, Ketch spewed a mouthful of water across the table.
The world slid out from under him and Dean realized they were along the edge of a hidden bluff, a drop of thirty feet looming beneath him. As he slid down, he reached out, just barely snatching a root before he could tumble down with the lump of mud.
“I have no idea how you think they look like puppies,” Dean muttered, opening his door to go inside. “Text me if you need help finding something.”
,” he spat, in an obscene imitation of Castiel’s earlier words, “that I must have
His shiny eyelids fluttered shut and his head dropped back against the biobed, his hand slipping from Castiel’s neck to fall heavily on his chest. Castiel straightened and stood, thoughts racing and head pounding.
It was difficult with the light of the torches and the unique placement of the alien’s features, but Dean recognized the Rosencian guard who entered the cave as one who had been present during their first diplomatic discussion. Dean made eye contact with Kevin and dipped his head slightly. Kevin gulped, evidently understanding.
Dean tried not to roll his eyes at the mention of the Seals’ spirituality. He wasn’t usually such a dick of an atheist, but if Castiel was gonna keep bringing up praying and the Celestial Father and the great spiritual power of the Seals all the time, Dean would lose his mind.
More mud slid down the steep bluff, as if whatever Dean had stepped on triggered a whole landslide. Just as the Hellhound roared — it was right at the edge of the bluff, they could smell its rancid breath — Castiel and Sam’s combined weight became too much for Dean’s bad shoulder and he let go, all three officers shooting down the slimy incline.
“Well, actually, I really shouldn’t beam up,” Crowley hesitated, and Dean groaned. “I’m sorry. I mustn’t leave Meg alone. I am to take her with me.”
Kevin, Sam, and the Seraph were well-versed enough in the Rosencian sign language that they’d had one diplomatic conversation with the guards, but it proved they still couldn’t rescue the Shurlian from his gilded prison without a kidnapping. That night, the team had split into two; Ketch, Sam, and the Seraph infiltrating from the front while Dean, Charlie, Jo, and Kevin took the back.
“I’m right here,” Dean grumbled.
“Hmm,” Chuck nodded awkwardly.
voice? Like, uh, like
“I need to talk to you about Castiel.”
Dean had thought Castiel was just weird like that, but now he wasn’t so sure.
“Lots of humans like to talk about how they feel bad, and that makes them feel better,” Dean said, attempting to sound clinical. “I don’t work that way, which sucks, ‘cause it’s not like I
Castiel turned as the doors slid shut behind Doctor Singer, who was holding a cup of coffee, his face paling beneath his scraggly beard.
Dean, failing to hide his discomfort, turned his head away from the science officer. He’d only known the guy for a month but didn't think he'd ever stomach the fact that Seraphim could just spontaneously heal superficial injuries like that, that they had unfathomable strength and immunity, that they could take and give consciousness at ease, that they looked almost identical to humans yet couldn’t feel empathy and, oh, that they
Ketch responded with something, but Dean chose not to give it the time of day.
He folded Dean Winchester’s broken nose into its correct place again with a slow click. Fresh skin blossomed over the tip and spread outward to cover his cheeks, the incisions in his flesh melting into his new complexion.
“You’re gonna hafta get over your irrational fear of non-human abilities if you ever want the captain to take you seriously on an away trip again,” Bobby said, pulling back the re-gen machine to study the newly complete skin of Dean’s chest. He picked up an anti-inflammatory salve, addressing the goose egg on his temple and bruises at his throat. “What’ll you do if you get injured on an exploratory mission and the nearest medic is twenty miles away?”
Castiel stared at Dean. If Dean didn’t know better, he would say Castiel was offended.
“I am not coming to you for advice,” Castiel said curtly. Sam glanced up. Castiel looked, for lack of a less human adjective, distressed. “I am asking for your help.”
“Hello, Ruby,” he said calmly. “Was wondering where you got off to.”
“The, uh, Seraph, Castiel, I think you’d like him, actually,” Sam said. “I don’t mind him. Dean, for some reason, can’t stand him, which is hilarious, really, because— you should see them together. They
Castiel then lowered his brows. “It is not enough for you to promise to ‘behave’,” he said. Dean swallowed. He had kind of hoped he had driven the Science Officer to his wit’s end already and
“Hold your horses, gotta check for a…” Ash crawled around the edge of the square hole, peering inside.
“So, yes,” Ketch confirmed.
“Oh.” Dean’s arm had reached down for the safe beneath his bed, but he now let it fall limp as if he had intended on just swinging it off the mattress all along. “I mean, of course.”
“Sure,” Ketch said, tentatively poking at Dean’s palm. “And, uh, interesting impression.”
“No,” Anna said. Her flaming red hair was twisted up like a giant pretzel on her head. “Not me personally. Azazel is on the Federation watchlist. Starfleet has a trained squadron dispatched to intercept him. I will be leaving the
“That sounds awfully suspicious,” Singer said, raising an eyebrow. He sighed and gestured to the helmsman with a nod at Castiel. “G’wan in there.”
crew.
“Anybody bring goofer dust?” Dean screamed out, leaping over a giant log.
When the sickbay doors slid open, Castiel nearly had to shoot Doctor Singer with a relaxation hypo just to keep him from wringing Dean’s neck. After a litany of curses, insults, and
The Seraph’s gaze shifted dispassionately to a blank spot on the wall as he tuned the frequency on his communicator. “Commander Castiel to Commander Ash.”
Naomi’s smile was wide enough to register in Castiel’s periphery.
heal.” Dean swung his arms about for emphasis. “Shoulder doesn’t even sting anymore.”
They landed in a heap, the pain only setting in after Dean got his bearings. The ground was rocky, but the mud accompanying them had softened their impact.
If Dean could make out much color in the dark chaos of the jungle, he would have taken that warning more seriously. The alternating patches of pitch darkness and piercing light he stumbled through while tripping over roots and vines were so contrasting and sudden he could have believed he’d been transported to a club dance floor. The claustrophobic heat and sweatiness did nothing but contribute to the impression.
“I just wanna thank you for what you’re doing, Sir,” Bradbury said. Her small hand had a strong grip. “It’s really hard for us, so if you’re— if there’s anything in that room that will help you understand who Dean is— why we’re so—”
* * *
Castiel’s fist opened and something fell to the floor beside the bed with a tiny thud. He did not stop to look at it. His head was aching inside this room. He could taste smoke.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, logic is your love language, right?” Dean began.
Who was it that ever said that my life really couldn’t get any duller? My family’s dead and I can’t see a way to carry on… I’m not THAT GUY!”
Correction: Castiel was hoping for a clearer glimpse at what had been done to Mister Winchester in the depths of the Rack. They could not solve the case of the Gehennian slave traffickers unless they detracted the information from the source. Love and affection were merely words for distractions, confusing humans like Sam  Winchester from their primary goal: galactic peace. It was Castiel’s purpose aboard this ship, his
“You’re quick, Cas.”
too close. Castiel knew it, too. He followed Dean and Sam into the jungle, Ellen and Ash not far behind.
“We need to find the others,” Sam said.
The Rosencian leered over Dean, the thick skin of its face so close he could make out flecks of colors in the leathery scales. Dean quickly realized that these were actually dots floating over his eyes as his vision gave out. The ringing in his ears grew overpowering — Kevin’s squealing certainly doing no favors — and just as Dean was losing the sensations in his thrashing extremities, a swatch of blue flashed near the guard’s head.
“A little,” Dean said. “But it’s not like regular high school dreams, where I’ve failed a test, or I realize I showed up naked, or I’m abandoned by a girl at the school dance. These are weirdly vivid, and nothing really happens.”
Sam had long since stopped chewing on his bite of Markab-leaf salad, leaning forward eagerly to catch every word Chuck spoke.
Sam’s powder blue uniform was soaked to near transparency. He wiped his thick wet hair back from his forehead (it then stood stiff in mid-air like a ski jump) and he curled his lip at Dean.
full of humans. Isn’t intercepting emotions the whole gig?”
. Castiel was not certain how he came to be on Naomi’s ship, either, having only become conscious of his presence here what felt like minutes ago, but could well have been hours.

Sam laughed. “It’s like, gentle, but also… invasive.”
“I know, Cast— I
And it was so ridiculous. And Sam didn’t laugh, because he was too tired, but he did sleep soundly that night, free of any nightmares of Jessica or Mom or Dad or Dean. Because even if everything sucked, Dean had lied today. He loved making new friends.
Sighing, Dean pressed the button that opened the door — the image of Castiel knocking once and then standing in the barren hallway with his arms stiff at his sides was just plain sad. He had almost been expecting him, anyway. If Ellen herself wasn’t coming to drag him to counseling, she would send Bobby or the Seraph to do the job.

in his sleep. It had been on and off for the past couple of days. Castiel diagnosed it as an anxious byproduct of cabin fever or some kind of manifestation of his subconscious desires, and when Dean realized Castiel had been watching over him as he slept again, he’d started locking his door at night.
If Castiel had known the flayed body they’d recovered would one day cause him so much bewilderment, he would not have been so enthusiastic to assist in healing it.
“Yeah, but if anybody on this ship gets a pass, it’s me.”
“Yes. However, reading his mind will not allow me to heal him. Not psychologically. Although I may acquire knowledge helpful to the Gehenna case, I would not finish my job.”
Castiel hesitated, then nodded. “I accept. Under the condition that you extend the utmost effort to stay out of harm’s way.”
“No,” said Castiel.
Dean let his neck relax, his head leaning back against the moist rock wall, and tried to ignore how much his whole body was hurting. His left arm remained noticeably weak, his legs significantly less flexible than they had been a few months ago, his breathing still labored despite Bobby’s specially prescribed workouts. But he was fine. Just out of practice. And, as Sam was so scrupulous in making note of, healing.
So humans
Sam, however, did not seem very interested in the fact that Dean was singing while he was asleep. As a matter of fact, he hadn’t touched the dream journal in months. For Sam, quarantine was being spent mostly in his own room, doing crossword puzzles and meditative coloring books, watching true crime documentaries on Netflix, and trimming his hair with safety scissors. Dean hardly saw him outside of meals, which mostly consisted of cereal and beef jerky at this point. He knew he should be more concerned about Sam, but he wasn’t keeping record of his embarrassing sleep outbursts anymore, so Dean didn’t feel like ruining a good thing.
Dean grinned at the captain sheepishly, his face growing warm despite the accurate observation. “It seems we, ah, had a little disagreement about the dress code.”
“In our faith,” Castiel said, “the Great Father created the celestial universe. Seraphim were the first he created, his soldiers, to safeguard his lesser creations—”
“Captain,” Sam announced, pulling a face at his dashboard. “I’m detecting an oncoming spacecraft.”
“Shore leave?” Dean asked hopefully.
“Fidget spinner beads,” Dean reminded him, and closed his door, officially quarantined.
“I am fine,” Castiel reported, blinking away the pleasant ringing. When he looked at the Seal’s engraved container again, his head remained silent. “That is normal. It’s a… profound bond between my people and… How did you find it? I was making haste to join the recovery team.”
Was that any clearer?"
Dean was screaming at the giant Hellhound galloping toward them.
Up on the hilltop, just as Sam shouted Dean’s name, a piercing scream echoed over the hills. Sam took off running towards the sound, footsteps of his crewmates behind him, but it was too late.
-chesters,” Dean muttered as the turbolift doors slid open. It was such a bad joke, Sam entered the bridge cackling.
Dean leapt forward to put himself between the two of them, holding out his arms like some kind of forcefield.
Castiel’s brow was furrowed, one hand lifted to his temple. “It is well shielded. But there is a distinct pulse of energy I can detect in the east. We are nearby.”
Sam threw the pillow off his head, towards the wall. He stared at it glumly. “Learned it from you.”
carried through the trees.
Charlie did her best to illustrate said illness with another twisted scream and stiff contortion. The guard finally conceded, assuaging Kevin with a few gestures before approaching Charlie, a dainty metal key glistening between his scaly fingers. As soon as her wrists were uncuffed, Charlie collapsed, but before she could hit the floor Kevin had leapt from the wall and slammed the tray of gruel upside the guard’s head.
The rice krispies were, indeed, soggy when Dean finally reached them, but he didn’t really mind. Rice krispies were always delicious, regardless of their consistency. He did regret he didn’t make it in time for that sweet spot (just the right amount of cool crunch followed by a moist milky squish), but even if it was just mush, the ricey flavor never let him down. It was like a cold oatmeal. A grainy gazpacho. A sophisticated porridge. Quarantine may not have improved Dean’s palate, but it at least improved his attitude about it.
synthetic.”
“No,” Castiel said, although unperturbed by Chuck’s recitation of his full title.
“Although, I would appreciate access to those files. It’s really Mister Crowley I’m concerned about.”
“What about you guys?” Dean said, spinning Sam around to give him a brief once-over. Although covered in nearly as much grime as the rest of them, his brother seemed perfectly fine. “Wasn’t Ketch with you? How’d you find us?”
“That was a compliment,” Harvelle whispered with a nudge of her elbow.
, Dean told himself, begrudgingly gripping the outstretched hand and yelping as he was yanked to his feet like he weighed nothing at all.
“Can’t help it,” Charlie moaned obnoxiously. “You’re just… so… masculine—
“I think they’re delicious,” Sam said.
“Winchester,” Castiel said, following him. When Sam turned, he saw Castiel furrowing his brow, his distress even more prominent. “Your brother’s quarters are in the other direction.”
"Castiel?!"
“What are we looking at?” Ellen asked.
Singer watched Castiel for a moment, his face softening. Castiel felt his own chest aching with a complex rush of worry. It was not anxiety alone, but he had no name for the sensations that accompanied it.
“I was
Sam decided not to mention he’d already heard Dad say “fuck”. He pulled his arm away from his older brother, but didn’t meet his eyes. He stared at his bed instead. He thought about the monsters that slept down there and kept him awake at night.
The guard, carrying a tray of gruel in one giant meaty tentacle and a pitcher of water in the other, turned to Dean and glowered at him (he assumed; it was hard to tell when they had such lumpy faces), using its free hands to sign something at him bitterly.
“I understand,” Castiel said. Although he doubted this statement, his very utterance of the words were testimony to their truth, for Seraphim could not lie.
Castiel let out a quick huff of air. “Compared to yours, rather unexciting.”
Of course, humans boasted much weaker constitutions than Seraphim. At the sight of the body, Lieutenant Winchester turned his face away, breathing hard. Singer put a hand on the younger officer’s knee and nodded for Castiel to focus on his work.
Jo shrugged, wincing with the movement. “It’s my mother’s job to be mad at me. The
He probably looked like a total moron, pressing his face up against Baby’s steering wheel like this, but Dean didn’t really care. The metal was forming painful welts across his forehead and nose but in a sick sort of way it felt like a gentle hug. He’d slammed his face against this steering wheel too many times before (hitting the brakes too hard when he was sixteen, dancing to the radio too hard just last week), so it was some form of a routine to remind himself of that familiar feeling.
“I found the traps, too, dumbass!” Dean yelled.
Sam had started documenting Dean’s dream quotes years ago, when things were more normal, and Dean’s sleep outbursts were limited to random laughter and perplexingly sophisticated exclamations. Once the hunters had taken a single room at a motel that was otherwise completely booked, and Dean had been fitfully sleeping on the couch. Around one in the morning, as Sam and Castiel were studying the origins of sirens, Dean called out angrily into the night:
Castiel clasped his arms behind his back in a professional stance, but the position didn’t help him look any less awkward.
“I didn’t,” Dean insisted. His fingers ghosted over the bloodstain on his tunic and he glanced at Castiel. “No, I… kind of had an… accident…” Dean forced out an awkward laugh. “
“Down, Dybbuk,” said the voice again, and Dean, still stunned, almost kneeled in response, until the Hellhound ducked its head and folded its legs to rest on the ground. The action revealed that the terrible hound had a rider — a small, dark-haired Klingon woman wearing classic gold chainmail armor — as well as four unconscious captives — two in red, one in blue, and one in Captain’s green — and one piece of precious cargo — the Seal.
” Dean barked around the lump in his throat. Sam’s eyelids fluttered, but remained closed, and he drew his thin eyebrows together.
Thank you all for reading my brain rot discharge. I hope you are enjoying it. Please feel free to leave a kudo and a comment — I love hearing what you think!
Didn’t mean he didn’t miss it.
“Then that makes you Uriel,” Ellen spoke, gesturing to the other Seraph, using that tone that Dean envied so deeply — she was pissed and suspicious but it passed as upbeat diplomacy. She rose from her chair, turning to face the Seraphim. She may owe them respect, but this was her ship. “I must ask, is your viewscreen malfunctioning? I’m sure you’re aware of proper inter-ship procedures—”
“He’s lost a lot, but that wasn’t all his,” Doctor Singer said. Castiel noticed a shake in the doctor’s voice absent in his steady hands. “Ketch was bleedin’, his team’s in tatters, Sam’s a mess, he’s coughin’ up blood and he cut up his leg pretty good too. Barely got him to sit still long enough to patch it and then we had to shove him right outta here. Wanted to give Dean his blood while he’s losin’ his own. Idjit. No, we got him on a donor bag now. If Dean dies of anything, it ain’t gonna be blood loss. Not on my watch.”
The crazy eyes blinked. “Hmm?”
“Ruby,” Crowley warned.
Bobby worked his jaw, studying Dean’s face with the carefully practiced reserve of a surgeon with an anger management problem. “Boy, if you’d lost your nipples in this fight, that woulda been poetic justice.”
WARNINGS: Somewhat graphic gore (no violence). Medical trauma. See tags, but mostly the dubious science tag. Standard SPN gore, more severe by 60s Star Trek standards.
By this time, Dean and the security officers had recovered themselves and were racing for Sam and Rufus. The dog was pawing at its face, stumbling about, then took off running again, this time incapable of following a straight line. It careened
Zachariah’s unblinking psycho smile was instantly redirected to Dean. “Oh,” he said, “we don't. But some of us have a bit of humor and imagination. Long as it doesn’t get in the way of serving our Celestial Host, right?”
little man,” Dean said, and even through his rage, Sam felt his stomach drop in shame. “Don't say bad words.”
Dean groaned. “Why is everything you say an insult?”
Dean pushed Sam aside to hop in the hole himself, and — predictably — Castiel followed.
“In theory.”
But then Castiel said, “I disagree.”

“You are still mending, so do not think about it too hard,” Naomi said. Castiel stopped thinking about it, and the ache receded, although the tightness of his fist did not. “I would have rather you recovered fully, but this must do. You will fulfill your duty.”
kind of gesture. Ketch shook his head.
“Yes,” Castiel affirmed. “I was praying for guidance on this approaching mission, particularly in how best to serve as your caretaker.” He raised an eyebrow at Dean. “Perhaps you approaching me is an answer to that prayer.”
Dean’s voice was little more than a wheeze, a hitch of air, high-pitched and fragile, indistinct from his previous mutterings aside from the fact he was definitely speaking in Standard now. Castiel's mouth snapped shut. His hand was still on Dean’s shoulder, and although his Grace had lost all hold on Dean’s humerus the moment he’d been distracted, Castiel thought he— thought he could still feel something— he wasn’t quite sure what. It weighed thick and dusty on his tongue.
The sound of trees cracking jarred the party. Dean didn’t bother to pinpoint where the sound was coming from, instead trusting an instinct and pointing in a direction. Jody and Ketch took off, Sam and Dean close behind.
“Oh yeah? What do you call this?” Kevin gasped through his sobs as he finally made it to his feet, pointing furiously at his swollen eyelid. Castiel blinked and laid two fingers against Kevin’s eye. When he removed them, the swelling was gone.
. You’re injured.”
If Ellen had really believed the shirt was going to live through the end of the month, she must’ve been delusional. Dean may have practically been rebuilt from the bones up, but habits couldn’t be mended as easily as flesh. Even when his uniform had been red, Dean always seemed to be losing it, to women or workouts or homoerotic fistfights on hot desert planets. There it was now, in a heap, and hey, Garth was right: those uniforms really
Dad was tired. Dean was tired, too. Neither of them had slept since the fire, not without nightmares of Momma’s screams.
“Yeah,” Dean said. He was covered in gallons of bodily fluids and undoubtedly indistinguishable from a porcine biped. Meanwhile, Castiel… What twisted science experiments did the Seraphim undergo to cultivate a genetic code so capable and flawless as his? Castiel’s perfect complexion made Dean want to puke. “Don’t look so bad yourself,” Dean spat, trudging after Sam, “Sir.”
. There must be a plug somewhere they yank without any warning. Red alert. Emergency shutdown. System failure.
crew itself was desperately struggling to understand what had transpired — but it was at least certain they had recovered the hostage and that the majority of fatalities had been Klingon.
The actual mission was brief and easy, almost disappointingly so. Dean was so swept away by the hallways’ streams of bustling rainbow nostalgia, he forgot they were even there for a Seal until Ellen was shoving it into his arms and the walls of the space station were rippling back into the shape of the
“And get this. The musical is about Andrew freaking Jackson, of all things. A musical about Andrew Jackson? I don’t even know who Andrew Jackson was.”
“You’re no warrior,” Dean concluded, stomach dropping as soon as the words passed his lips. To say that to a Klingon meant you were disgracing their honor, and disgracing their honor meant you were disparaging their lifeblood… it was a whole big thing, and it never did end pretty.
“He’s saying,” Castiel said, “that we could afford to make mistakes on this mission, and that the captain could afford to send her weaker officers to do the job.”
Sam dressed himself, downed a whopping glass of ice water, and passed by Sick Bay again to retrieve his brother. Dean shuffled out looking much cleaner and healthier than he had half an hour ago, although he was cradling his midsection, and dark bags lurked under his eyes.
ng to die here. It’s the only thing he knows is real.
“Really,” Meg chuckled, recovering. She paused, tilting her head with a sickening smirk. “You think we don’t know about the vessels? The Last Battlefield?” She leaned forward on her Hellhound, baring her own teeth. “Our Father loves his children. Lucifer will rise, and he will claim Genesis. And so it was
blind date between Dean and Random Alien Of The Week, Sam's revenue would be half that. Unfortunately for Chuck, Dean’s only observed interests had ever been in the feminine.
Castiel suddenly appeared at Sam’s side, one hand hovering over his little brother’s busted leg. Dean’s head shot up on instinct, but Castiel’s intense glare shut down any rising protest immediately. The Seraph gently laid his hand on Sam’s thigh, above the wound, and leaned down so Sam could hear him.
“The Chancellor position is, quite literally, up for grabs,” Crowley said. “I wouldn’t mind having the position myself — it would be grand if we were to finally make peace with the Federation. Isolationism is so twenty-first century. Unfortunately, that whore Lilith is my biggest competition. She believes Lucifer can be ‘risen’.” Crowley tossed his hands dismissively. “That’s all a bunch of conservative baloney, if you ask me. Lucifer died in The Cage eons ago.”
He studied the positions of the spike, the hidden cannon in the hillside that was now smoking slightly, and the tricorder that Dean had, for some reason, flung away. Castiel observed his own tricorder again to verify he wasn’t stepping on any traps before gingerly picking up Dean’s equipment. As he did so, his headache surged.
was cruising at a brisk Warp 7, headed for neutral space to avoid any possible violent altercations with enraged Klingon conservatives chasing them down.
And this time, when Dean laughed, Cas laughed too.
was flirting to the portside just slightly. Dean pressed the amber calibration button and adjusted a dial, the starship righting itself smoothly.
The Programmer is surprised. “The Thursday fledgling?”
“Who cares,” Ruby dismissed. Okay, weird. She was grinning: also weird. “No, you two… you’re the ones from Gehenna! You’re…
Cas folded his hands in his lap and turned up his nose. “Any flattery is a product of your interpretation.”
From the other biobed, Kevin nodded. “A suspiciously terrible decision, really.”
At that moment, a shout interrupted the calmness of their meeting. Dean stepped toward the noise, raising his phaser, and promptly found himself crashing to the mud when his ankle gave out beneath him. Sam jumped awkwardly between the fallen Dean and the new intruder — who could now be seen jogging out from the trees in the opposite direction as Crowley had appeared — while Castiel stepped behind Dean protectively. Dean, adamant to be useful, aimed his phaser out towards the figure through Sam’s wide stance.
“You don’t fool me,” he sneered.
“So, we’ll storm, but we’ll do so with caution,” Ellen sighed. “Ketch, Mick, Jody, I’ll take you up around that hill to study those buildings, and you four will head down there. Analyze the traps and then report back to me, and we’ll formulate an infiltration strategy. Got it?”
” Dean laughed.
And if he stayed in his quarters for the rest of his life, would he even be third in command much longer, anyway? Maybe he could pilot the ship remotely. Reposition his communication screen to his bedside, never wear pants to work, avoid all human contact and any possible need to interact with his babysitter.
“What the
“No,” Sam said softly. He paused, as if trying to remember what it was he actually did.
Dean lifted his head, and Sam was finally close enough that he could see his face clearly; the broken nose, the blood bubbling from his lips, the fear in his eyes. Something glinted on his chest: the amulet, swinging about wildly. In the firelight, it was practically glowing.
“Traps?” Ketch was repeating, instinctively reaching for his phaser. Charlie and Mick mirrored his action.
Doctor Singer was standing over him. Castiel shut his eyes again, ears still ringing.
“Then I shall respect your culture by sparing you the details,” Crowley responded. “Basically — and this is open to any kind of interpretation — it depicts the end of the known world and birth of a better one. It culminates in a battle between the galaxy’s most powerful armies. It involves the religious figures Michael and Lucifer. Fill in the blanks to your own heart’s content, but Lilith has decided Genesis is somehow involved in this.”
Castiel cleared his throat. He was wearing that pained thousand-yard-stare again.
Beam down to Planet X. Avoid contact with inhabitants. Infiltrate mysterious dark facility.
“They aren’t… I mean, it’s just orders, Captain,” the communications officer said, brow furrowed deeply over his dark, darting eyes. “There’s an… ‘understanding’. We’re… we’re to do as the Seraphim wish, until further notice.” Kevin put his hand down and glanced around the bridge awkwardly. “The President backs the order. That’s all they said.”
Sammy was asleep in Dean’s arms, bald and happy. Dean wondered what “extremist” meant. Azazel was a pretty name. The pretty lady also had a pretty name, but Dean couldn’t remember it. Anna… or Ella… or something.
“How’s the arrangement?”
to take over Commander Winchester’s research.”
“You still have this?” Dean smiled, picking up the Idolian amulet.
“The rumors are untrue,” Naomi insisted. “I oversaw the termination of the Project myself. I will grant you access to the files, if it will ease your concerns.”

Nurse Jones passed Doctor Singer a hypospray from the overbed table. The doctor injected it into a nearly undamaged patch of flesh on the patient’s thigh.

“Great,” Ellen said, exhaling deeply. “Well, thank you for your time, and for agreeing to meet with me. We should get your Seals back in no time.”
Castiel nodded, even though the thought of abandoning a sacred Seal of Elysium to a team of only human rescuers made his skin crawl. “Aye, sir. That is logical.”
“No alarms!” Ash rejoiced, popping his head up from the hole. He promptly slid himself into the gap beside the seal. His chest was level with the jungle’s surface. “Who’s gonna help me lift this?”
Castiel followed. “I don’t even want to know what that means.”
expression. It seemed to work on the Rosencian, however, and to Dean’s relief, it turned to Kevin with a concerned look on its bulbous face, the tentacles gently setting down the tray of gruel and the pitcher. It signed something at the ensign while Charlie continued to writhe and moan, recognizing that Kevin, out of the four prisoners, was the only one capable of communicating in something other than Standard.
“You suggested a compromise?”
Dean paced and paced and paced. Control. Maybe he had no control over his life right now — which,
Sam put his spoon down and dumped the rest of his rice krispies into his mouth. “We’re doing it,” He said through the mouthful, standing and bringing his dishes to the sink. He brushed past Dean and Castiel and rapped on the table with his knuckles as he passed. “If you guys need me, I’ll be evening out the layers above my ears.”
Sam pursed his lips. “I don’t think Castiel is an undercover agent, if that’s what you’re implying.”
“Where to, sir?” Dean asked, already pulling up a trajectory map to share with Sam’s screen.
Zachariah clapped his hands with shamelessly bad rhythm. “I am so very glad you asked.”
Dean’s mouth went dry, his already nauseous stomach doing an extra flip. In his peripheral vision, he saw Castiel whip his head in his direction.
Speaking of birth control, it was just about time for Dean’s traditional tryst with the Random Alien of the Week — and there were plenty of contenders to go around in the halls of the space station. An emerald-skinned Orion chick with legs for miles. A Romulan lady who was way too old for him and therefore all the more exciting. An Andorian girl who literally approached Dean asking how flexible he was. There was even an Edo man with these huge blue eyes — and Dean didn’t… at least, not usually… but he’d heard about the

“Fine,” Sam spat. “Jerk.”
Sam had never seen this Naomi, and only knew what he’d learned about her at the Academy, which wasn’t much, besides that she was one of Elysium’s great leaders. But once Sam saw her, he knew her in an instant. Perhaps it was because he’d gotten used to Castiel as of late, and her eyes — huge, vacant, boring through space and time itself — were incredibly reminiscent of their first officer’s. That, plus her dark gray formals, her brown hair’s simple updo, and the pristine white office in which she was located all clued Sam in to exactly who she was.
“Scratch that, sweetheart, why don’t you set the dinner down and show me what else those tentacles can do?” Dean smirked. The guard, who may not have understood the language but had no problem recognizing the taunt, stepped forward, rolling its neck and then promptly socking Dean in the gut with a stone-hard fist.
“Will you tell me what you’ve been dreaming about?” Castiel prodded, a somewhat mischievous grin crossing his face. “You rarely sing when you’re awake. Forgive me for being immensely curious.”
“A lifetime of religious discipline, decades of battlefield training, years of Academy studies, and weeks in private trials,” Naomi said. She looked at Castiel. Respectfully, he did not look back. “You have continually proven your significance within the Garrison and your allegiance to the Host.”

“Oh, he’s been

After Dean nearly vaporized a six-legged koala-like creature in its own nest, he turned to Castiel tiredly.
“Is there any reason we can’t discuss this on the ship?” Sam asked with a breathy laugh. He was so sweaty, Dean could nearly see his own reflection in his skin. Dean’s stomach cramped, his throat tasting of bile, a likely warning of impending heat stroke.
There were many races of non-Terrans on Gehenna, but most of the felon-citizens were Klingons. Perdition, the penal colony’s capital, was particularly dense in the Klingon population. The city was an incredibly important hub for dilithium crystal exports, but the Federation had yet to strike a solid deal with the city’s flaky council and formidable Chancellor regarding a trade agreement.
The tribble wilted, and so did Charlie, and so did the salesman.
, ding dong. Me and, um," Dean winced, "Lisa. Lisa Braeden. She’s there, too.”
Sam was still perplexed at how somebody so focused on professionalism could care so little about the appearance of his hair. Sam himself liked to tease the limits of regulation, but… it was like Castiel didn’t even own a mirror.
“I can heal that,” Castiel said as Dean steadied himself, and it took Dean a moment to register that the science officer was referring to the giant gash across his bare pecs. Dean yanked his hand from the Seraph’s and waved him off.
“He’s saying it should be
“Emily Elizabeth tagged along,” an unfamiliar female voice sang out.
Dean found himself at a loss for words, not sure how to explain that was exactly what was pissing him off, how he couldn’t get the image of a crimson-clad John Winchester out of his mind, how Dean had spent his whole life fighting to control his future and only now was realizing how much agency he no longer had.

Dean nodded. “I’d hoped we led the Hellhound away from the Seal, but I don’t see it anywh—”
Also, sad news.

was the only ship in the quadrant. Didn’t it always work out that way? Some Shurlian ambassador had sent himself to the wrong planet, fucked up when interacting with the locals, and more or less been enslaved as some sort of pet for the queen of the Rosencians: a tribe of bipedal, two-armed, two-tentacled matriarchs, strict isolationists who only communicated in a non-verbal language not offered in traditional Academy courses.
Dean leaned shakily forward until his nose brushed Castiel’s, his hot breath hissing harshly through his teeth. “
Sam smiled. “Sorry, Chuck. I don’t think he swings that way.”
Sam collapsed onto the floor. The cold, solid, silver floor.
” Castiel shut his eyes and tried to focus.
Sorry about the hiatus. For what it's worth, this is my favorite chapter so far (besides the earlier Castiel POV).
“Long ago, these people engaged in a civil war,” Castiel said. “Although they’re a pacifist society now, some of their old traps may still be buried and active. It would be a logical place to store an expensive and illegal purchase.”
But Castiel wasn’t trying to change the way Dean was coping; he was trying to understand it. He asked “why not” because he didn’t know. And, for some weird, scientific, creepy reason, Castiel was genuinely interested in the answer. Or maybe the reason was compassionate — which didn’t make sense, but Castiel was surprising Dean every day. It was so hard to tell what he was thinking. Dean glanced at Castiel's hands.
. Uriel, Anael, Ezekiel believe this. Why can’t the good little soldier?
“Yes,” Sam said immediately.
Still, Dean would remain petulant, or die trying.
and then
Dean sat ramrod straight in his chair. He’d been focusing on color theory so hard he’d completely tuned out an order. “Sorry, sir, can you repeat that?”
“Dude, you are
“Indeed,” Castiel said.
“Captain’s orders,” Castiel said.
“And you
Castiel requested to stop by the victim’s private quarters. The officers escorted him there immediately.
Jo huffed, and turned back to Chuck. “So. Tell me about Project Genesis.”
“That’s set to kill now,” Rufus warned in Klingon.
“Bobby… not… my nipples…” Dean wheezed, and went limp.
It was much too hot out and Dean did not have the patience for this. He jerked his head at his brother. “Sam,” Dean spat, flicking his chin upward, “and Dean,” and after a brief moment of hesitation, “and Cas. Now answer the damn questions.”
Yell at Jo for sneaking away on a mission again, but don’t stay mad at her for too long, because she’s just a dumb kid and she’s happy to be here.
“I thought you guys had no emotions,” Dean blurted, immediately smelling the smoke of Ellen’s laser eyes melting holes into the side of his skull.
“That is not what dream catchers are supposed to do,” Castiel said. “When hung above a person’s bed, they catch the bad dreams but let the good dreams through. When the sun hits the dream catcher in the morning, the bad dreams evaporate. According to legend.”
“The Seals of Elysium have been stolen?” Castiel repeated, his processors stalling.
Dean had meant that light-heartedly, but it was laced with such bitterness, even Cas noticed. The Seraph’s brow furrowed, and he looked at his hands, palm-down on his thighs.
“Jo, don’t ask him about Project Genesis,” Kevin groaned finally.
Your greatest obligations during this time differed slightly than what your regular First Officer responsibilities would entail, but you fulfilled them sufficiently — commanding the
“Alert Captain Harvelle the landing party has been recovered with minimal injury and altercation,” Castiel reported. “Seven for beam-up.”
Dybbuk, blinking his ugly red eyes as he looked from Crowley to the officers, let out a deep huff.
“Dean is at potential risk for further flashbacks,” Castiel said. “I could remove this memory from Dean’s mind with the hope of delaying further leakage, but if this flashback was triggered by something, the precaution may prove useless, as we will ultimately want to isolate what causes the recollections. And, as Dean greatly dislikes having his thoughts examined, it may be wise to spare him the discomfort until that is truly necessary.”
“I had a feeling you would accuse me of that, but no. Not everything I do is about you, Dean,” Castiel smiled a little. “I just wanted something new to pass the time. I was starting to deduce that you and Sam were getting sick of the paper snowflakes.”
Although, all previous violent incidents on these Seal missions had been due to imposters or Dean plain fucking up.
Dean rolled his eyes. “It’s a scratch.”
Dean grabbed Sam and yanked him close. The remaining Klingon lunged for them, but Rufus’ phaser pressed to his head stopped him.

His eyes flew open on the eighteenth day and he choked around the nasogastric tube in his throat, right hand shooting out to grasp whatever was nearest, which of course was Castiel.
“Hear what?” Jo muttered, but she had barely finished the word before the noise grew audible: wet, echoing footsteps, not unlike the ones they had taken when they’d been led down to their cell through the long, rocky tunnel connecting the cavern to the palace. Jo sucked in a breath. “Oh, that.”
“Saved my life.
“Who?” Castiel asked.
“Oh.” Dean allowed himself to worry that he was stupid. “That why you can’t…”
“Sorry ‘bout the mess,” the engineer said as they entered the hallway. He was breathless. The two golden bands on his sleeve indicated he was a commander; therefore he was likely head of his department. “Ellen— Captain’s in Sick Bay. We, uh, we got a problem.”
But just as Dean reached for the Seal, a wave of headrush washed out his vision and buckled his knees.
“Gotta say, in terms of traditions, this one’s pretty metal,” Dean smirked.
,” Zachariah quipped. “They are inscribed with our religious texts, yes, but they also run our schedules, power our homes of worship, simplify our courts… they hold as heavy an engineering and governance responsibility as they do a spiritual one. Of course, I wouldn’t expect your race to understand such an advanced and successfully applied concept.”
“Your brother,” Chuck repeated, brightening as if he just remembered something. “I noticed his absence. In the rescue, was he the one performing a dance routine while shooting at the guards?”
“Captain's Log, Stardate 10918.8, Captain Ellen Harvelle reporting, First Officer…” she glanced at Castiel. “Castiel… attending. After a month of bargaining with the Gehennian government, efforts to permit a search party within the Rack facilities still proved unsuccessful. Although Starfleet’s orders dictated we tuck tail and leave, I elected to disregard this decision and beam a rescue operations team down for the recovery of Lieutenant Commander Dean Winchester…”
Dean tried not to roll his eyes. “At least we’re on the same page about that.”
and therefore, Elysium. I don’t want Lilith to get Genesis, or the Seals, any more than you do. I want to join the Federation, and to do that, I need the Federation to
“Oh, I’ve got it,” Meg smiled, tossing a thumb back to her captives. “One Seal for the war machine, one Starfleet captain for Lilith, two expendables for Dybbuk kibble.” She gave the Hellhound a scratch behind its ears. It bared its teeth and snarled at Dean. “Now, you…” Her dark eyes widened and she gasped. “A Seraph? And a weak one, too! Isn’t this my lucky day.”
“My deets are juiceless.”
present course. The Shurlion mission would be delayed by an hour, at most.
crashing into the Earth, of Dean floating naked through space and burning from the inside out until quasars of white light shot out from his eye sockets.
The dismissal left Dean irked and still stuffed with questions he wanted to ask about Zachariah and Uriel and this stupid freaking treasure hunt for some stupid freaking prayer medallions. This mission did, however, beat hours of boredom on the bridge, no matter how much of a buzzkill the science officer was. And it wasn’t even a pity mission this time.
Ruby huffed. “
Dean told Cas how, for a little bit, life was mostly okay again. But then Dad finally caught up to Azazel, and his mission went sideways, and he died. And how, even after that, life was still mostly okay for a little bit longer. And then. But Cas knew the rest.
Bradbury released Castiel and he entered Dean Winchester’s quarters.
“Allies?” Ketch repeated, taking in the faces around him. He looked down and gasped. “Oh my God, I am on a bloody dog.”
“We may have been protected on the city’s streets, but here, we got nothin’ but ourselves,” Rufus scolded. “Humans are a delicacy in the Rack nowadays, or haven’t you bozos heard?”
“Commander? How do you feel?”
“In our defense, we didn’t break the Prime Directive,” Sam offered.
Dean actually didn’t, which is why he went to his quarters and sat on his bed and stared at his gold? green? tunic sleeves and allowed the painted eyes of John Winchester to glare down his back. As the minutes passed, as his shirt sleeves shifted from yellow to green and back again, he tried to imagine what Sam was saying to the crew right now. Probably something all heartfelt and stupid. He was probably crying. The big baby.
