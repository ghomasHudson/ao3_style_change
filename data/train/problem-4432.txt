And I think it got sadder than I intended it to, it was supposed to be an angry argument but oh well haha - I was trying very hard to keep that theme of anger and it probably ruined it a lil bit but whatever, I still like it
“I’ll try.” Cas said, not wanting to make promises he can’t keep. He was overwhelmed too. Dean just kissed him. It was unreal. And when they met, it wouldn’t even cross his mind. Of course, there were feelings. But he never fully understood them until he spent more time here. And when he was human, he started to understand a little bit more. He still was confused about many things, but there was one thing he knew for certain. That the things he felt for Dean were definitely mutual. At least that’s what he concluded from this situation. He hoped he’s not wrong.
25th! We’re halfway through! (I’m also almost done writing all of them, maybe I’ll post more when I’m finished idk)
Then Dean showed up with pie and beer and they all sat down and talked. Dean told Sam about the case and Sam told them about the small vampire case in town he went on while they were away. And Sam haven't noticed a thing, because Cas and Dean acted like they always did. But he knew that something was definitely off, when his older brother and the angel stared at each other for a while too long, like always, but that stare was different. Not so much with sexual tension, as with fondness and something else that Sam couldn't quite pick up.
“Dean’s right.” Sam said, sitting next to him. “Only Dean calls me ‘Sammy’, which I still hate by the way.” he said with his famous annoyed expression and Dean laughed.
“Bitch.” Dean responded. After few minutes he walked out of his room in blue jeans, black t-shirt with unbuttoned, red, plaid shirt over it. “Be honest, how do I look?”
“Yeah, it does.” Dean was listening carefully, trying to remember. He wanted to know as much as he could about his angel. “Do you do this often?”
“Oh, yeah, right.” Dean chuckled uncomfortably. “Sorry, I’m a little high. Um, what I wanted to say was-” he took a deep breath. “You wanna go out with me sometime?” he said quickly and nervously. The only reason he got it together was weed and even that wasn’t enough to not stress about Cas’ answer. Or maybe it was starting to wear off? He wasn’t sure.
) and I wanted to see if I could write short drabbles (apparently I can't because a lot of those were much longer than I wanted them to be haha)
“Maybe they’re tied to something” Cas noticed, as there were many hunts when things like that happened.
So yeah, they both wanted it. They were naked real soon. Neither of them was with a guy before. Dean was with a lot of women, and Cas was with one woman. So it was kinda awkward. Especially, since they’re best friends. But it wasn’t bad. If Dean had to be honest, it was probably the best, or one of the best, sex he’s ever had. Maybe that’s because it was with the person he cares about. Person he… yeah.
This is really stupid but I kinda liked the idea? Anyway, it's better than the first version I wrote haha
He would walk into the kitchen in the morning and see Cas already there, and his heart would beat a bit faster, and an involuntary smile would appear on his face, no matter how small. And then Cas would hand him a mug of coffee and he felt all warm and fuzzy inside, and that was before he took even a sip of coffee.
Then he took Castiel by his shoulder and he turned him around so that Cas was on his back. Awake. Looking at Dean with wide eyes.
“I thought so too. But this… this is a bunker. For hunters, and research, and books about monsters, and all that stuff. And I think I want to spend the rest of my life peacefully, you know? No hunting.” he admitted, both to Cas, and to himself. He wanted to retire. More than he thought he did. “And Sam seems to enjoy running this whole hunter network or whatever he calls it. And he has Eileen. So we’re not really… needed. Here.” he bit his lip nervously, while Cas seemed surprised.
“Suckers.” he laughed. “I just had ice-cream with Cas. And I got a date. Sorry, Charlie, he’s mine.” Dean grinned and his friends were in shock.
“I was reading. It's nice to see you two finally got your shit together” he added, still smiling like an idiot. Dean and Cas made their way down the stairs, still silent. “You don't have to hide that from me, you know. If it means anything, I approve” it did mean much, but Dean wasn't gonna admit it.
I think for the rest of the chapters I'll post twice a week - and sometime next week I'm posting the first chapter of a new sambucky fic (
? How can you even say that?” she theatrically put her hand on her chest. “Wait, you’re not gonna, are you?” she seemed genuinely concerned now.
“I know.” Dean smiled at him softly. That’s when they started talking again. Lying there, in the backseat of the Impala, naked, covered with some blanket. It was still dark and no cars were driving by. They were alone in their own world for a brief moment.
Dean rolled his eyes and got out of bed. He quickly put Cas’ number into his phone. He knew that Castiel is probably asleep after night shift, and also he didn’t want to be the guy that calls right away. That would seem lame. Although he did not want to wait too long...
Dean exchanged a few more kisses with Cas that night, out in public, in a bar, in front of all those strangers and his family. Doing that made him feel free and happy. Not having to hide his love, his feelings. And, of course, they exchanged even more kisses later, in their motel room, but that’s a longer story…
“I’m sure he will, but shut up.” Charlie groaned next to him, turning her back to him and taking more of the covers with her. She wasn’t a morning person. Well, neither was Dean, but he was too nervous about his date. They were sleeping in his bed, Sam was on the couch in the living room, and Benny on the floor in living room.
"About damn time." he thought, closing the door and letting them sleep a little longer. They didn't have anything urgent to do right now.
They poured all their feelings in that kiss. All the repressed, denied feelings that were always there since the beginning. Even the feelings they didn't know were there up until this moment. It was the most amazing, breathtaking… and freeing experience in Dean's life.
“I mean, on a date.” Dean added, not sure if the beautiful angel in front of him understood. He bit his lip nervously, while Cas just chuckled.
“Dean, what are you doing?” Cas asked, smiling, his face inches from Dean’s. His back was against a shelf and Dean stood right in front of him.
Benny and Charlie were already out the door, with shoes and jackets on. They were laughing about something on the staircase.
“I got that. I would love to go on a date with you.” Cas said slowly so it would really get to Dean. “Just don’t be high then.”
“I think I’d like that.” Cas smiled, turning and leaving one more quick, casual kiss on Dean’s lips, then getting out of bed.
“No shit” Dean rolled his eyes. “That’s kinda obvious, genius” he scoffed in such an offensive tone, that Cas got annoyed again. “We need to ask more about this house.” he pointed at building they just went out of. It was an old, abandoned house that someone recently bought with intention to renovate, but got mysteriously murdered. Why were people so stupid to buy houses where dozens of people were killed? Dean could never understand it.
, but it looks more like a first draft or a rough idea of a story hahah (not gonna rewrite it tho, need to keep writing the next ones haha)
“Me too.” he admitted, slowly getting up, immediately feeling Castiel’s hands on his shoulders, helping him.
“We will. Later.” Dean said, smirking, and scooting his chair closer to Cas’. Sam made a disgusted face, followed by a laugh and shaking his head.
Dean woke up freezing. Well, maybe not freezing, but certainly cold. At first he didn't know what was going on. Then he saw Cas next to him. Well, he saw just the blanket in which Castiel was literally wrapped, laying on his stomach with blanket on top and under him. But he was asleep.
So they stayed there until Sam started wondering what was taking them so long. Keep in mind, he did not know about Dean and Cas’ relationship yet. And Dean was in no hurry to change that. In fact, he kind of liked the secrecy. Not only having this relationship and this happiness all to himself, keeping it between him and Cas, but he also liked even the simple excitement of the possibility of getting caught, like right then. Sam called out to them and when they didn’t answer, he made his way to where he last saw them, between the shelves. Before he got to where they were, they made their way towards him, laughing, in great moods, with red cheeks, messy hair, and swollen lips.
“Who gives a shit? We’re in love.” Dean grinned, and at that, a similar grin appeared on Cas’ face too. Damn, he looked gorgeous. And it was so good to say that, too.
“Shut you cakehole, bitch.” older brother said, but he couldn’t contain a smile. Mostly because he was that high.
He loved when he was driving with Cas in the front seat. He would steal glances at the angel, and he could swear he felt his heart doing flips every time their eyes met.
Wanted to post something at the beginning of new year, before I get back into studying and have less time for writing again haha
“Sure.” he knew Sam rolled his eyes. “I have to make a food run anyway. Well, drive safely. See you, jerk”
Because we got over 100 kudos here (which may not be a lot, but it is to me idk), I'm posting an additional drabble this week ☺ Next one normally on Sunday ☺
“What?” Dean was caught off guard, as they were just talking about the fact that they like the same books.
A day later they finally figured out what was keeping the ghosts there. Of course it had to be in the house so freeing the spirits couldn't happen without a fight. Dean tried to focus, but he was constantly catching himself on observing Cas with the corner of his eye. The angel in a fight… damn, he looked good.
“I mean, I want to have a home. A real home. Whatever that means.” he scoffed, realizing that he actually does not know. Because when he had a real home, he was young and he could barely remember it. But he could figure it out, right? With Cas.
And maybe it was the time, around 5am. Or maybe it was being so close to Cas. Or probably the fact that Dean wasn't conscious enough to think. But he lowered his head and his lips met Cas'. Which is what he wanted to do probably since they met.
"I asked Cas out." he said to himself. He pulled the number out of his pocket, as he didn't change before sleep, and just stared at it for some time. "And he said yes. Fuck me.” he covered his face with his hand, still not believing that it actually happened. But he knew it did. He didn’t remember much of last night, but he definitely remembered his talk with Cas.
“And all kinds of bullets? Iron, silver, all that stuff? And salt? And-?” he felt himself start to ramble, because while his Baby’s trunk was full of useful weapons, Cas used to rely almost fully on his angel blade and his powers, that he didn’t have anymore, so he tried to equip him as well as he could.
“I’m not.” Dean said. “But whatever. We can go there.” not like the guy’s gonna be there anyway. It was middle of the night and Dean saw him there only during days. And he knew for a fact that it’s open 24/7. He’s there quite a lot, especially on weekends, when the guy works.
“I’m gonna be right back.” he pulled the keys out and gave them to Sam. And then he just turned around and walked away.
“Thanks.” Dean smiled. “But I really could eat somethin’. It’s the weed.” he explained. “I think we were gonna get ice-cream.”
Anyway, again thank you so so so much ❤️ Love you all ❤️ And hopefully see you in my other works haha❤️
“Ugh, get a room.” Sam said more teasingly than anything else, which earned him a kick under the table.
“Mhm” Cas mumbled, his eyes closed and hands in Dean’s hair. He expected Dean to pull away this final time and start the car again, but he didn’t.
It was hot, but gentle. Awkward, but perfect. It was like they were made for each other, like they completed each other. And it was a moment of happiness and forgetting about the whole world. Their moment. The one that should’ve happened sooner, what of course crossed their minds. They both haven’t felt so carefree and happy in a long time.
“Don’t you dare dying again.” he said, his tone full of anger and worry and sorrow. “Don’t you friggin dare, Cas” he added sounding way too desperate. But he didn’t care. He closed his eyes. “We need you.
The truth is, Dean was terrified. Not of ghosts, of course. He was terrified, because of all the feelings and emotions he had when Cas was around. And when he wasn't. Especially when Cas died. Of course, his previous deaths were horrible and Dean hated them. But this time something in him changed. This time he started thinking. And realised some things that he tried to block out of his mind. And another thing: he was terrified of losing Cas again. So he wasn't mad at him. But he acted that way so he doesn't do something he might regret, like… na-ah, he isn't even thinking that.
"Dammit, Cas." he sighed, putting his gun away. Castiel was standing over shattered glass and spilled water on the floor, in a t-shirt and pajama pants. "I almost shot you. What the hell are you doin'?"
Lately, Dean’s been happy. Almost giddy. For once, everything was going fine, they stopped the end of the world, again, they got Cas back, they kept hunting and helping people, at least for now… it was great. Dean found himself smiling almost constantly. He and Cas more or less talked everything out, though they were still working on it, and Dean knew he would have to try really hard not to lose him. He was fine with that, he just wanted Cas to stay with him.
"You know… uh." he started. "If you need anything at all, you know where to find me." he said finally, kinda nervously, letting go of Castiel's hand.
It was great. Living all together, in their home… but was it really a home? It felt like that before, after living in motels their whole lives. Maybe it used to be their home, and he loved it, it was the first permanent home he had since he was four.
He walked over to the stereo and flicked it off. In the corner of his eye he saw Bobby look up at him from across the shop. “Sam, you mean. Sam made callbacks.”
“Uh huh,” said Dean, who knew full well his college’s performing arts building was pretty much the same distance from their tiny apartment as the shop. “And?”
“I’m fine. Sam’s fine. Um…” He trailed off, and imbibed a little more liquid courage. “I, uh. I guess Pam must have told you Sam and I tried out for the musical Paradise is putting on for next season?”
, Mary, didn’t he just write one about cats?”), because let’s not expose children to too much violence, unless you feel like getting into fistfights at shitty bars, right? But that was later, after
Before he could formulate a response, the sound of the mini-fridge slamming shut echoed out of Bobby’s office. The man himself appeared a second later, holding three beers. Yielding to the inevitable, Dean took the beers and popped the caps with one of his rings. Pam accepted hers gracefully and sat down in one of the chairs, the men following suit. They clinked necks and downed a gulp each. This solemn ritual completed, Bobby leaned back and set Dean with a hard look. “So why does Sam think you’re trying to bomb your audition?”
“I’d like that too, honey, I can’t wait to see it. It’ll be just like when the two of you used to put on little shows for your dad and me in the family room, do you remember? Now tell me about these other actors that have you so worried.”
“A total shrimp,” Dean agreed, leaning an elbow on one of the dress forms and grinning as his brother’s blush deepened.
“I didn’t start performing because of Mom,” he said quietly. “Not from watching her walk the boards or because I felt some legacy, or obliged to enter the family business or anything like that.”
Now there’s more of what Dean expected. Of all the pompous bastards in the Milton family, Luc was by far the worst Dean had come across. He’d sauntered into the shop a few times, when Bobby was still working at Paradise and Sam and Dean would hang out after school, and the way he’d talk down to the techies and, frankly, give him and Sam creepy fucking looks, well, if he hadn’t changed in the meantime this was typecasting at its finest.
The house, or the performance space of the theatre, had its doors wide open. Even here the Miltons had broken from the fashion, eschewing the royal reds and golds other places favored; the blue carpet continued into the aisles, and the chairs were the same deep hue with silvery white accents. The space was large enough to seat almost 2,000 people, and since the house lights were up all the floors and balconies were visible. On the orchestra level several people were milling around, some who worked for the theatre, and others actors warming up for the dance auditions that would be happening soon. The company’s performance season had just ended, and the set had clearly been struck: the stage was empty. There would be plenty of room for dancers to spread out and strut their stuff.
“Oh, uh, actually she went home to her mom. I’ve been in town, doing tech stuff mostly.” Dean moved on before he could ask any more about it. “This is my little brother, Sam.”
“And don’t try on any of the dresses,” Dean called after him as he bounded off, “you might stretch the fabric now.”
“No, I—” Cas buried his face in his hands for a second. “Why can’t I ever say things right around you? What I mean is you perform the song like I’ve never seen it. You’re a troublemaker but you’re inviting everyone to laugh with you, just like in real life. You’re flirty but not leading on, teasing the ones who aren’t amused by you, but not insulting or demeaning them…except for me.” His entire expression fell, and the hurt he was so clearly feeling took Dean off guard. “You don’t treat anyone else this way. Why me?”
Naomi and Bartholomew shared a look of mild surprise, but Michael, bored, gestured toward the piano. “Give your music to Kevin and begin when you’re ready.”
, and it’d been so spectacular watching all the myths unfold before his eyes it really had felt like a little slice of divinity. “Alright,” he said. “Hit me.”
, really dancing in a way that felt like himself, and even though he was sweating, and Crowley was being a picky bastard, everyone returned his smiles and Dean was flying high.
.” Dean wasn’t often in the habit of playing piano, and there was no point to it, really, he thought, looking at his hands, scarred and roughed up and with crap permanently embedded in his fingernails from working at the shop. Sam was a much better player, with long-fingered, musician’s hands. Not to mention he gave more of a shit about it. As long as Dean could sight read his music, that was good enough by him.
“Whatever,” he replied. Sam couldn’t be convinced, so what. Dean knew what he saw. Castiel might have everyone else fooled, but not him. Yeah, Castiel must think himself so clever singing about tricksters and thieves when really, he was the biggest huckster of them all.
he’d made his naked onstage debut (and under Sam’s direction, no less). Stripping down to boxers for Ezra, who’d probably seen more bodies in her lifetime than Sam and Dean ever would combined, was a piece of cake. Anyway, he’d lost his ability to blush long ago.
As the door shut for the second time, Dean felt the enormity of what had just happened crash down on him. He couldn’t deny that what Joshua said was right; Dean had been thinking about the steps, had been determined to get them perfect, but he’d forgotten completely what they were supposed to mean. God, Crowley was going to run to Chuck, wasn’t he? He’s going to let Dean sweat it out for a couple hours and then he’ll swan back in to tell him to get the hell out, and—
Pamela Barnes was widely considered one of the best agents in the business. She’d been an intern at her agency when Mary Campbell was just starting to make a name for herself, and the women had bonded over local beer and rock’n’roll. Even after Mary left Chicago in her rearview for Broadway, Pam kept her eye on Sam and Dean. Out of friendship for their mother and fondness for the boys themselves, Pam had agreed to take them on as clients, though what she felt she got out of a stubborn college kid and an even more stubborn techie, Dean had no idea. Even after the
Dean froze for half a second, then set himself to work sweeping the floor. He stared hard at its splotchy surface, speckled with flecks of multi-colored paint from years and years of jobs. “No,” he said, once he was sure his voice would be even.
Their presence dominated the room, making it feel small even though it was big enough to fit a few guitars in their stands, various percussion instruments, and a black baby grand. The accompanist sitting at the piano was so young he looked like a kid, and generally gave the impression of a man very much trying not to be noticed.
Lights were already turning on in the city around Paradise despite the traces of orange and pink in the sky, even above the lake to the east. Chicago should have been his city now after all these years, but it never truly felt like home. Or maybe he was the one that wasn’t quite right, not for Chicago, and not for the stage, either. He wasn’t quite right in the head, always expecting the feelings people had for him were real, though he knew,
“Oh yeah? Are you sure? Maybe you just think I don’t know talent when I see it, seeing as I have so little.”
Under the watchful eye of both Michael and the equally formidable assistant director, Raphael Milton, who were standing onstage and talking to each other beneath the din, their underlings managed folders full of music and schedules and other information. As he waited in line for his turn to get his name marked off and receive the goods, Dean kept an eye out for familiar faces. Joshua Gardner was hard to miss; he was dressed casually but had that ineffable aura of control and confidence veteran actors had, drawing many of the younger performers into his orbit. Rowena was holding court, thick Scottish tones carrying loudly over everyone else’s conversations, eye-catching with her long red hair spilling down her bottle green dress. Victor was there, and Dean nodded to him. Luc Milton was the next aisle over and Dean made a note to avoid his creepy ass. There were a few people he recognized just from having seen them perform locally too, but he didn’t have long to look before a folder was shoved into his hands and everyone started making a show of finding a seat to settle in.
Dean returned the gesture, not realizing until that moment how much he’d missed him, the Collins to his Roger in
Dean tried to keep up the attitude, stay psyched up because with voice practice now including the second act, well, Crowley was headed there with the dancing, too. So “Mr. Mistoffelees” dance rehearsal it was. Now it wouldn’t just be Castiel getting up in Dean’s face for a moment; he would be dancing in everybody’s face, and Dean would literally be singing his praises as he did so.
Dean may as well have been an annoying fly, for all Castiel thought of him. He kept it as a cold comfort, then, that the eyes he felt grazing his back as he went out the door were all in his head.
They both breathed into the silence for a moment. Then, a shade too brightly, Mary said, “Well, how are you? How’s Sam?”
Dean couldn’t help but shout at Cas stroking him after an age without, and Castiel took advantage of it by burying his face back in Dean’s neck, whispering dirty nonsense in a steady stream about how good Dean was, how much more he could take, that Cas would give him—and his hand was rough with nothing but sweat, fingers surprisingly calloused, learning quickly how to make Dean squirm, playing him like, Dean didn’t doubt, any number of instruments he could play and this was just another way to make Dean sing.
“I couldn’t sleep. Cas, we’ll find a way.” he added, bringing a chair closer to Cas, throwing books off of it, and sitting down, not taking his hand away from Castiel’s shoulder.
“Dean, look at me.” Dean did as told. “I’ll be fine. And I’ll be back. As long as you come back too.” he added.
“Maybe a little louder, would ya?” Dean said, trying to appear annoyed. But he wasn’t really capable of being annoyed right now, thanks to the weed. He was too relaxed. He pulled Charlie towards the nearest free table. It wasn’t hard, just two others were occupied. “And to you he’s Sam.” he added, knowing that the kid’s gonna say it anyway.
“I mean, when I’m very stressed, or when I’m with my friends and we’re bored... “ he bit his lip. “Maybe quite often.” he shrugged. But then he thought that maybe Cas asked because he doesn’t want to be with a person who gets baked all the time. “But not that much, I mean, it’s not like we do it every day. And weed is not that bad-”
“That’s fine by me.” Dean smiled, leaning in. He was too chilled out to be stressing about it. When their lips met, he felt ten times higher than he was. It was so amazing and new and exciting. And they both couldn’t stop smiling during the kiss. After they broke the kiss, they just looked at each other.
am attracted to him.” she said, a little bit jokingly, but the rest of them couldn’t be sure. “I was never even attracted to you, and according to every girl in high school, that was impossible.” she pointed out.
“Damn ghosts.” Dean breathed out as they went out of the building, needing a plan to put all those spirits to rest. “How the hell are we supposed to find their bodies? Burn the whole cemetery?” it was supposed to be an easy job. Basically a milk run. Find one body, salt and burn the son of a bitch, and go home. But it’s always something.
“Later.” Dean said, rolling his eyes. “Oh fuck, it’s good.” he added, pointing to his food. “But we gotta get ice-cream after this.”
“Gimme a minute.” Dean grumbled, leaving Cas’ lips for just a moment. Sam huffed and walked past them, murmuring something about them being obnoxious and always all over each other, and sickeningly in love. Which was a huge exaggeration, in Dean’s opinion.
“That’s not true, shut up.” Dean took a bite of his food. “If you go out with him, we’re not friends anymore.”
“Dean.” Cas interrupted him, grabbing his wrist, stopping, and turning towards him. They were right next to the garage door. “I have everything I need. It’s a simple case, and it’s not the first time I’m going alone. I did use to be an angel, remember? Literal warrior of God? I think I can handle a hunt.” he smiled at Dean’s cheeks reddening.
“You’re bleeding” Winchester noticed red stain on Cas’ white shirt. Cas looked down and just sighed, putting his had over the wound and healing himself. Ghost must’ve thrown something at him and he barely noticed.
“You go with Sam, as we planned. My case seems much easier and simpler than yours. I’ll call you all the time, and we’ll be back together soon.” he reassured. He let go of Dean’s hand and moved it to his cheek, because his other hand was occupied with his duffel bag. “And stop worrying so much. It’s actually kind of offensive.” he said with a teasing smile, because he had been an angel and he could fight just fine, and Dean knew that, but death seemed to follow all of them anyway, and Cas was more vulnerable now. Not that Dean didn’t trust his abilities as a human, or anything. He did. He just didn’t want to lose Cas again.
"Dean?" Cas said with his sleepy, deep voice and Dean just couldn't bear it. He loved the way Cas was saying his name.
“Well, duh.” she said, laughing again. “Gimme” she took the spliff from his hand, smoking it instantly.
So yeah, he was very happy. There wasn’t much that could bring him down, other than maybe some frustrating hunt. Or, someone blatantly flirting with Cas, which bothered him much more than he cared to admit. Theoretically, he knew Cas was with him now, but he still had doubts, and he thought that Cas deserved better (another thing he was working on - the way he thought about himself).
And it started to bother him. More than he thought it should. And suddenly, he was thinking about it more often than not.
Cas, of course, kissed Dean back, and when they pulled away, both of them were smiling, although Cas was a little confused. That was the first time ever that Dean kissed him in public.
“Then you’re screwed.” Sam joked and got a pair of socks thrown at his head. “I’m kidding! Jerk.” he scoffed, getting up to take a beer out of the fridge. He loved being at Dean’s place, because he could do whatever he wanted, like drink beer that his brother would buy him.
“Maybe.” Sam took a deep breath and flipped open his phone. “Hi, Pam.” He pressed a button and her voice, tinny through the phone, filled the room.
Dean had never met him, but he had seen him smarming around Paradise once or twice, snapping his gum, his friendliness a little too sharp to be totally sincere.
Neither of them spoke again until Dean was washing his hands in the shop sink. Sam leaned his ass on the bench next to it and crossed his arms. He cleared his throat, opened his mouth, and then closed it again.
Dean closed his eyes as Sam began to sing, putting himself in that garden, and opened them just before his cue, letting the softness fill him and infuse his voice, smiling at his brother,
“Good, because this is important. I’m glad you’re not like me. I get my priorities mixed up, I know that. It’s only recently Bobby and Pam mentioned some things about after I left that I…I’m not sure of everything that went on but I hope someday you’ll tell me. All know is I should never have assumed John wouldn’t treat his own sons the way he treated me. I’m sorry, Dean. That’s my fault. That’s on me. So I know you’ve sacrificed a lot and I heard when you stopped acting before it had something to do with a girl? Maybe your dad never stopped me and I think whatever happened with her shouldn’t stop you, but even if it does, I thank my lucky stars every day that you aren’t like me, Dean. You’re better than me and you deserve better.”
“But what?” Dean prompted. When Sam bit his lip and looked away, Dean grabbed the wide push broom hanging on the wall, wishing he could just get the rejection over with so he could accept that his brother was moving on without him, just like everybody else.
ran around his head in an anxious litany. He was especially nervous because if Sam got cast, which Dean was very certain of, he was equally certain that he wouldn’t say no himself. He wouldn’t be able to turn down the opportunity to make Sam happy by accepting, or the chance to be on hand to support him in his first professional venture.
“It was you who performed it, no matter whose directions you were following. And then,” he added, before Dean could protest more, “we danced to ‘Rum Tum Tugger,’ and I saw you weren’t a rock star.”
Back in the hall, Sam sprang from his chair. “How’d it go?” he asked, half excited puppy, half worrywart.
Sam sidled up to him, gulping giant moose slugs out of his water bottle. He tapped Dean lightly with the back of his hand. “What’s up with you?” At least Sam’s Munkustrap was amused during the song.
Jack felt relieved. That meant that Dean was definitely lying to him when he said he wasn’t interested in anyone and he was feeling pretty confident that the person was Castiel. After all, Sam told Claire that it was and the younger Winchester would know Dean’s feelings better than anyone. “Thank you Sam. You have been very helpful,” Jack gave him a polite smile before spinning on his heels intent on going back to his room.
That was it. His time in this universe was about to end. It really did last longer than it should have, he blamed that entirely on himself and his desire to learn more about his alternate lifestyle. But he couldn’t help himself, the djinn designed this place specifically to make him want to say and if it weren’t for his better judgement, he may have considered it.
“Face it they don’t really care about you and you know it. But, in here it can be different. I made you the perfect make and model. They’ll never argue with you, never turn on you, and most importantly, they’ll never leave you.” Michael taunted. “They’re not your family. They don’t care about you and you don’t care about them. You wanted to get away from your life so badly that you said yes to me. Because you know that anything I’ll give you is better than reality.”
“Come on, at least hear me out. You can say no to me after,” Claire pleaded. “I can’t do this without you. Or at least, I don’t want to.” She was hoping to appeal to Jack’s soft nature. Claire was rarely ever this candid with her feelings and she couldn’t imagine that Jack ever heard it too often considering he lived with the Winchesters.
He knew Claire wouldn’t like this plan since it didn’t involve deception and Jack wasn’t exactly known for his subtlety. In fact he wasn’t entirely sure how he’d pull this off, but he would try his best. After all, he may not know how to read social cues, but he liked to think that he knew Dean and Cas.
Jack ran to the black car thankful that Claire didn’t go with him. He could easily open the car door with his powers but it would have been harder to manage with the girl looking over his shoulder. It was easier to telepathically open a car lock than the door back at the motel. He quickly opened the drivers door and searched through the center console. He was back at Claire’s side in under two minutes.
“Look, I know you were sent here to keep an eye on me while your Daddies kill my hellhound, but this is all over once Guinevere is dead. That hunter will be avenged and I will leave Sioux Falls forever and set up shop somewhere else. The Winchesters were friends with Crowley, they’ll understand that this is just business,” the demon continued to plead, thankfully not noticing Claire who was inching closer while still a distance away, angel blade at the ready.
“I know kid, but the sooner you let us go, the sooner we’ll be back.” Dean pleaded. That didn’t stop the tears that started to run down Jack’s face.
“I know it seems sappy, but I really appreciate you doing this Cas.” Dean spoke after they had been laying in a comfortable silence for a while. “Michael hasn’t stopped banging in my head since I got back and I don’t think that I would’ve been able to sleep at all if you weren’t… I don’t know… Just you being here, it helps a lot. Gives me something else to think about.
“I mean it’s not everyday the Winchester’s take a kid in; they’re not like Jody. They’re basically lone wolves outside of each other, with the exception of Castiel.”
“I was never going to stay. Not really. Hell, half the time I was trying to find a way out.” He was content with staying at the time, but deep down he knew it would have drove him mad eventually. All of the little details that Micheal couldn’t have gotten right. The differences between the so called “perfect versions” of the people he loves verses the real ones. There would have always been a part of Dean that didn’t feel right. “I think I was just hung up on the idea. All of us happy together. Not having to worry about people dying all of the time. But, it’s just a dream. Sooner or later there was going to be a flaw, just like the djinn dream.”
“Sam, that’s enough.” Castiel repeated again, but with no bite to it this time. Sam looking at him with raised eyebrows. “Excuse me Sam and Mary, but if you don’t mind I would like to talk to my husband alone please.” Cas said politely. Sam’s eyes finally softened up a bit as he gave his friend a comforting pat on the shoulder.
His talk with Castiel proved that the angel did indeed have feelings for Dean. He didn’t have to say it directly for Jack to see it in his eyes. It also fueled him further to make sure his plan with Claire worked. After everything, Castiel deserves to be happy and Jack would do anything to make that happen. The last part of Cas’ speech did hurt him a little because he didn’t like how lowly the angel thought of himself. Jack knew it couldn’t be true. Dean
The nephilim really wasn’t kidding when he warned her to never call him again. She waited a day before she tried calling, hoping that he’d cool down enough to think straight, but she wasn’t successful. She tried everyday for a week, but every time it went straight to voicemail. She sent text after text apologizing and she’s heard nothing back.
They still had a few hours left until they had to pick up Jack. So, Dean asked Cas to tell him more about this world, since he may have to live in it for the time being. Even if it was only to ease Cas’ mind that he wouldn’t try any more dumb ideas in an attempt to escape. Or at least that’s what he told himself.
“Claire,” Jody interrupted with a sharp tone in her voice that turned back to sweet with her next sentence. “Why don’t you introduce Jack to Alex and Patience? I’ll call you when dinner’s ready.”
“Going after the youngest, you know that’s the cowards way out? Why don’t you come over here and fight like a real man? At least, then you’ll die with dignity,” Dean said cooly, not showing any sign of fear.
Thinking about his world made him look at Cas for a moment. “You’re taking this extremely well. In fact it’s unnatural how well your taking this.”
“Honestly? I probably would’ve done the same thing if I had gotten to him first,” Sam said casually. Dean raised his eyebrows, so he clarified. “Look, you can be pretty overprotective sometimes, but that doesn’t mean you’re never valid. He physically attacked Jack obviously you had to step in.”
Sam cautiously walked towards the table and Jack followed behind him. “Hey Cas, who’s your friend?” Sam asked awkwardly, not taking a seat. Jack decided to follow his lead, taking advantage of Sam’s tall stature to hide behind.
“I do,” Castiel answered after thinking about it for a moment. “Dean is the person I love most in the entire world, with only you holding a contest. Even then I couldn’t compare the two. The love I feel for both of you is strong, but entirely different. It’s not a bad thing, it’s just… different. In fact, I don’t think ever felt for anyone in the way I feel for Dean. I owe everything I have to him, including the love I feel.”
“The way I love Sam is like a brother. I feel a strong sense of loyalty to him and I would fight side by side with him any day. As I know that he would do the same for me. The way I feel about Dean is… well it’s rather complicated.”
By the time they wrestled the kid and strapped him down in the backseat and begun their drive back, Dean’s mind continued to wandering. He couldn’t get the sound of the voice out of his head. It was giving him deja vu. He knew he had heard that voice before, but he couldn’t pinpoint where.
“I don’t understand,” he finally said. “You want us to recreate the night Dean and Cas met? You do know they met in a barn? Or did they technically meet in hell?” He tilted his head in a way that resembled Castiel so much Claire almost felt irritated.
Jack opened his mouth already preparing to brush Sam off and tell him that it was nothing, but he paused. Sam was Dean’s brother and he knew him better than anyone in the whole world, even more than Castiel. He might actually be able to help him out, at least indirectly.“Can I ask you something? It’s going to sound really weird, but you have to promise not to question it.”
“Right. I’m aware of that. Can you just lay with me at least until I fall asleep?” The more times he repeated it, the more he realized how needy he sounded. He was feeling ready to reject the offer entirely, but he reminded himself that Cas was oblivious to the details of dating.
“Besides that, I don’t know what else could have put you here Dean.” Dean thought really hard. He felt like there was something else he was missing. Something obvious, but everytime he got close his head felt fuzzy.
Dean stood up and walked over towards them. “I’m sorry Cas, I think I’m just having an off day. When you get back I’ll be better. I promise.”
“Yeah they were totally cool. He could fly around from place to place and he blasted away bad guys with a wave of his hand. He could even open up portals to different dimensions.” It seemed odd telling Jack about himself, but it was the only thing he could think of. “It took him a while to get his powers under control. He started off small by moving a pencil without touching it, then after practicing real hard he was able to move people. Soon enough Jack was the most powerful hero there ever was and every bad guy feared getting on his bad side.
Jack scrambles for an answer. “I just learned that there are different types of love. Like how the way you and I love each other is different from the way Sam and Dean love each other. I guess, I’m just trying to understand it.” It was sort of a lie. He didn’t just learn this, Dean gave him a long explanation of the subject recently. But he figured that it was a good cover.
“Then there’s Castiel, always looking over your shoulder with those sad puppy dog eyes, making you feel guilty anytime you even think about going on a hunt.” Jack stayed silent realizing that he didn’t have a response to that one. He hated the way that Claire smirked at his sign of defeat.
He skipped a few pages ahead, reminding himself that his time was very limited. He stopped at photos from his and Cas’ wedding. The wedding didn’t take place in a church,but it was in a greenfield in the country. What really caught his eye was the wedding party itself, it was filled with people they had lost back in their world. Clearly Sam was the best man, but beside him was Kevin, Benny, Gabriel, Balthazar, Garth, and Gadreel. It wasn’t a group he could picture hanging out, but it made perfect sense to him why they were all there. There weren’t as many bridesmaids, but they included more loved ones who were long gone. There was Jo with her arm around him looking like she was mid laugh, Meg who looked pissed at being forced to wear a dress, Claire looking equally annoyed, Charlie looking the exact opposite,and on the end with a hand over her slightly rounded stomach was Kelly Kline.
When he felt well practiced he suddenly stopped and took a quick glance at Claire, double checking that she was still distracted by her phone. Once he was sure he turned his attention back to the rock, only this time he lifted his finger slightly upward. He compelled the rock to levitate about an inch off the ground. It took Jack a lot of focus to ensure the rock was high enough to not touch the ground, but low enough to not draw any attention. He held the rock in the air for a moment until he felt comfortable enough to move it. He started off with a similar pattern as before, making the rock fly back and forth, almost as if he was playing catch with himself. Once he felt confident with movement, he tried creating bolder patterns. With only moving his pointer finger, he created circles, figure eights, zig-zags, and star shapes. His shapes were all drawn out carefully in the grass by his floating pebble.
“Dude stop.” Claire said quickly. “Don’t get upset over nothing. Of course Cas is coming back. He loves the Winchesters way too much to not. Besides, you're still here. I don’t think he’d ever abandon you. Especially not because of some dumb fight with Dean.”
“Hold on, did you say his name was Michael?” Dean asked sharply. Jack hesitantly nodded. Michael. Michael. Michael. Dean repeated the name in his head over and over. His gut was practically screaming that this name was important. That this was the big missing piece to the puzzle that was this dream. He tried focusing his mind on this one name to remember why it was important, but every time he tried his mind became foggy.
Guilt flashed on Dean’s face, “Fine. He is my kid. I just mean I’m not his biological father. He’s… adopted. Sorta.”
“He said that there could never be anything between them and that Cas should just shove down his feelings,” Jack said, grumpily. He clearly had not caught on to Claire’s thinking.
“Hell no.” Dean answered immediately. “Can you really imagine the three of us trying to change a diaper? I barely get four hours of sleep as it is, the last thing I need is a screaming baby waking me up. And what would we do during hunts? Strap you to Cas in a papoose? Actually now I kinda want to see that.”
The four of them went to a diner for dinner the other night. Jack immediately picked up on the flirty smiles Dean was giving their waitress and shy grin she returned. He also took note of how Castiel immediately looked away and chose to concentrate on his menu. It reminded him why he was doing this and made him feel less nervous about what he did.
“Need I remind you that I am a celestial being with power a hundred times stronger than a mere human like you,” the angel growled.
“Yep. That’s right next to where his body was found,” Claire said from over his shoulder. “Casey Harp. I don’t remember reading her name on any of the police reports, maybe she’s still alive.”
“Drop your weapons or the boy gets it,” the vamp sneered.  Sam, Dean, and Castiel, having already killed the other vampires, turned and looked at Jack with surprise.
“No. No. No.” He repeated. “I’m going stop you right there. Just because you and Sam went all dreamwalker in my mind does not give you a right to mess with my feelings you son of a bitch. Cause if this is just a trick to get me to leave then I’ll never forgive you.”
“Don’t do this Cas,” Dean pleaded. “It’s the spell that’s making you say it, this isn’t you.There’s no way you…”
Her idea was to hire a stranger to flirt with Castiel at a bar and hopefully make Dean jealous. He tried asking where exactly they would get this “stranger” from and Claire brushed off his question by promising that she would take care of it. All Jack had to do was let her know the next time they all went to a bar with as much notice in advance as he could. Jack pointed out that the Winchesters never plan when they are going to a bar they usually just go, then a very frustrated Claire told him to try his best.
“I’m still mad that you died. How long was it? A week? A day?” Cas asked teasingly, as Dean’s face was getting closer to his.
Meanwhile, Dean felt bold and stoned and he was not thinking clearly. So he decided to do something stupid.
Dean and Benny started talking, Sam pitched in from time to time, mainly just listening, while Charlie was ignoring them completely, drawing on napkins with pen she asked another waiter for.
Dean and Cas exchanged glanced and little smiles. They're still not gonna kiss or hold hands in front of Sam. They weren't ashamed or anything. But they both weren't big on public display of affection.
So Dean leaned in and kissed Cas. Taking everyone by surprise. Of course, Sam and Jack knew that they were together. But Dean wasn’t big on public displays of affection. He was keeping it for when he and Cas were alone.
"Okay." Cas answered with a smile. And before he could stop himself, he added quietly: "But I'm not an angel anymore."
The kiss was getting more and more heated and desperate, hands were everywhere, exploring new territories. Neither of them noticed that Cas started leaning more and more towards Dean, which caused the latter to lean back, which resulted in… the chair falling back and them landing on the floor.
So we gotta believe that he will be back, too. Now, we’re both here, and Sam’s here, and I believe that all three of us, together, we will figure it out. We gotta have faith.” he felt weird, telling an angel to have faith, for once. It seemed surreal, but to be fair, their whole lives seemed that way sometimes.
"No." Dean shook his head. "Sit down." he pointed at the chair by the table. Cas did as told, he didn't see why not. "Now, let's get you your water." Dean walked to the cupboard, took a glass, poured some water and gave it to Cas. "And I'm gonna clean this up." with that words, he started cleaning shattered glass and water from the floor.
He found his way to the war room. That's when he heard something from the kitchen, like shattering glass. Dean walked over there, quickly but quietly. He stopped before going into the kitchen, getting ready to shoot whatever was there. Then he walked in and…
“I could really eat something.” at that they both burst out laughing. So they decided to ask Sam to make them some sandwiches. He wasn’t happy about it, but he did it anyway. It was Dean’s big date, he didn't want to be the one ruining something, even by not making a fucking sandwich.
“I know.” Sam sighed. “And he likes you too, don’t worry. I honestly don’t know any person, who isn’t a teacher, who didn’t like you.” he said, because, yeah, Dean wasn’t so popular with the teachers. He was doing good at school, but his attitude wasn’t always the best. He was kind of a smart-ass.
“Nothing.” Dean said with a pointed glare in his brother’s direction. Then he put a hand around Cas’ shoulders, and Sam snickered. It was a little ridiculous, he had to admit. He had literally no reason to be jealous. After everything they've been through, it was quite obvious. Still, you can't control your emotions all that much. Besides, he had a right to be a little jealous, right? He hadn’t been in an actual relationship for so long he almost forgot what that’s like.
“Hi guys. Had fun?” he asked with too big grin, when Dean looked at him with wide eyes. Cas just looked a little bit flustered.
“I don’t know, didn’t pay much attention to that. Just wear whatever, you always look the same.” Sam was getting annoyed. His brother was insufferable sometimes. “And you never really cared what you wore on dates.”
As soon as he did that, he wanted to pull away, feeling stupid. But then he felt Castiel's hand on the back of his neck, and the other one in his hair, holding him there and not letting him pull away. So he deepened the kiss, also putting his leg on the other side of Cas, so now he was directly on top of him. It was awesome. He never was that close to Castiel. And now their bodies were literally touching and he felt like he was on fire, but in a good way.
also sorry if it’s kinda chaotic, I deleted and added stuff so many times I just don’t know if it makes sense anymore lol but who cares haha
That night with his friends, smoking in the Circle, forever was the memory Dean would cherish, even if he remembered it really vaguely. He got the love of his life out of all this. The person who he would be with for the rest of his life. Turns out, weed can be really helpful, huh?
First, sitting in an armchair, a little bent towards the table, with huge grin on his face, was Dean Winchester. He was laughing at something someone said, tho he wasn’t really sure what it was. Even in his washed out jeans and a t-shirt with a band name, and high, he looked gorgeous. Back in high school he was one of the hottest, most popular guys. Not that he cared about all that. He was a twenty-one year-old college student now, and they were sitting in his small apartment at the moment.
"Sleep here. If you can't fall asleep and want to talk or something, just wake me." Dean said, going back to bed. And despite the fact that he wanted to sleep. If Cas needed him, he wanted to he there for him.
It was late. It was almost 11am. And they were still in bed, despite waking up about an hour ago. Normally, they were busy, hunting monsters or saving the world, the usual. But that day, there was nothing urgent waiting for them, they didn’t feel too hungry, and they really didn’t feel like getting out of bed for other reasons than to go to the bathroom.
Idk, this is basically the first draft of the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the word 'discreetly' (reminder that it's based on a post that is linked in the notes at the very beginning - in the first chapter lol) and I'm not sure if I like it, but anyway
I guess this one is kinda from their both povs idk. haven’t written like that in a while but this happened so
“That was cool.” Dean said. He wanted to say something like ‘you looked hot’ but stopped himself. Fuck, he didn't want to think and feel that way. Not about Cas. It wasn't even about his vessel being a man. Dean suspected he might be kinda into guys a long time ago, although still pushing those thoughts away. But this was his best friend. What if he loses him again? This time because of himself and his feelings?
And that actually was the case. Sam was sick of the way they acted. Especially his brother who was too stubborn to quit it. They needed to be forced to be together in the car for a long time. That should do it. So he came up with some lame ass excuses as to why he needed to stay and neither Dean or Cas believed him but they eventually just let it go. Sam found it kinda ironic how easily that came for Dean, when it was so hard for him to talk to Cas now.
“Um…” Dean wracked his brain for what he could possibly be talking about. His voice was the only cool thing about him. “No?”
But as much as they loved the techies, acting was their job and rehearsals were a train that stopped for no one. The day soon arrived when the entire cast was called to learn the choreography for “The Rum Tum Tugger.” This was going to be the first time Dean would be leading with the whole group, and he was surprised to find himself more excited than scared. The fears he’d had before and after getting cast were sloughing away like an old skin (he was forgetting, just like he knew he would), and in his eagerness he arrived at Paradise more than twenty minutes early, dragging Sam behind him.
When Dean looked back up at him, their faces were close, so close, and the weed had been good and yeah he was out of practice but this giddiness, this floatiness was something else entirely. “Hmm?”
“Hey Ezra,” Sam said, popping his head back through his t-shirt, “do you mind if I snoop a bit through the costumes? It’s been a while.”
He’d loved Robin, and Cassie, and Ellie, and Aaron, but had he ever…No. He’d never gotten up the courage. He’d tried to show them in a million other ways, big and small: cooked for them, smiled at them, made love to them, but…He’d never come out and said it, had he? Not until it was too late.
So he was grateful to Bobby that when acting hadn’t panned out for him he’d had a position ready and waiting for Dean at his little shop. It was little only in that it was maybe half the size of Bobby’s kingdom while at Paradise, but still decently large and square, ceiling a couple of stories high and wide enough to hold whatever pieces a local theatre might ask him to build. If they were big, Bobby might drag Rufus or Tara out of retirement too, or pay Sam to put in a few hours between his college coursework. There was nothing like that at the moment, though. Just Dean, the radio, the frame of an old car, and the clock on the wall, ticking ever closer to midnight.
“I don’t know, Pam,” he said, looking desperately around the room for inspiration, an excuse, any excuse.
“Amen,” said Dean, just loud enough for Sam to hear, and they stifled their laughter all through the next round of applause. In fact, Dean was wiping tears from his eyes so he didn’t notice at first that the anxious assistant from callbacks was shuffling his way to center stage.
A couple days later the community theatre’s car was ready to go, the old frame transformed into something worthy of “Greased Lightnin’.” You couldn’t even tell from close up that Dean had embellished some curves and subtly reshaped others. Bobby had slapped him on the back when he’d seen her, and gone to get the truck. The garage door to the shop was open, letting in the summer breeze, and Dean had the radio cranked high, jamming out to AC/DC while he bent to start hooking the car to pull it onto the flatbed. Then he felt his phone vibrating in his pocket. He wiped his hands on his ratty jeans and slipped it out. When he saw Pam’s name flashing on the screen, he debated not answering – no one liked rejection, even if they were expecting it – but he flipped his phone open at the last second. “Yep.”
Claire bit back a response and settled for an eye roll that Sam and Dean intentionally ignored. Jody gave her a sympathetic smile, “at least this time you’re outside with the monster.”  She followed the Winchester brothers to the front door while Castiel, Jack, and Claire hung back as expected.
Before Jack could come up with a plan, he felt Sean being pulled off of him. He relaxed a little when he saw it was Dean, with Sam and Castiel not too far behind him. Dean looked beyond pissed and didn’t hesitate to punch Sean square in the face. Sean weakly swung his fist in a lame attempt at retaliation that the Winchester swiftly dodged. Dean then threw another punch that hit its mark across Sean’s left cheek knocking him to the floor.
“Yeah, sorry about that,” Jack winced. “I’ve been feeling kind of sad lately, but I’m better now. I talked to Claire about it and I think I feel okay.”
“Are you going to get that?” Dean asked pointing to the ceiling. His fingers crossed that maybe when Cas left the room he could knife himself quickly.
“This is insane,” Claire laughed running a hand through her hair. “You know what? You did save my life when you could have easily let the demon kill me. The least I can do is believe your weird ass story,” she resigned putting her gun safely away.
“I think I’m okay,” he answered honestly. The small cut on his neck had already healed over and otherwise he hadn’t been physically harmed. “Did I do alright? I lost control for a second.”
“It’s cool. Don’t sweat it.” Jess let them inside the house. As they walked in Dean silently mouthed “Ow” to Cas who rolled his eyes. “Jack kinda had a rough night. He barely slept and he kept waking up. He cheered up once I promised that you were okay and that you were going to come home later. Poor little guy was exhausted, so he took an early nap and he’s been knocked out ever since. Do you want me to get him?”
“So, if we can’t work the case. What are we going to do?” he asked innocently, leaning forward from the back row so that his head was between the two.
“Well you did call me. I’m assuming you want something?” she said with an eye roll, “I mean if you wanted to kill me, you would’ve killed me already. A mesley crossroads demon like me is nothing compared to something like you. So, what is it? Do you want to make a deal?”
“Whatever I say, sure,” she echoed, probably knowing exactly what he was thinking. “Get rest and take care. Eight o’clock. Bye now.” She hung up.
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist and drew up close behind him, his hard cock pressing against his ass through their clothes. “Dean,” Cas said, drawing out the word and his voice, holy shit, plumbing the dark depths of the ocean it’d gotten so rough and deep. He nudged Dean’s chin up with his nose and sucked on the tender part of his neck a bit before meeting his eyes in the mirror. “Next time—”
“I’m not like you. I can’t separate myself enough from the work. And…I’m afraid it’s going to all come crashing down around me and I’ll pull Sam down too and all his hard work will be ruined, and…crap, mom, you should see the cast list, no way I’m good enough to be onstage with these people.”
The room was quiet and dim with the sun about to set. Cas kissed tiny kisses back up his neck, his jaw, until he landed a few more on Dean’s mouth. When he pulled back his face was open, guileless. “Can you open the windows?” he asked. “I’ll clean this up.”
Dean blinked. He went over it in his head again and again, but still came up with the same word. “Cats?”
“Heya, Sammy,” Dean said, cutting himself off. He lifted his legs above the bench and twirled on his ass to face the other side of the room.
, he seemed to send them off to go do their work, and urge the practically nonexistent audience (that is, Sam and Dean) to observe, no, keep a keen eye on the great spectacle. Given his character’s identity as a magician, the sequence had all the air of a ringmaster introducing his acrobat clowns and it was fucking brilliant.
Where the hell was he getting this from? “I wasn’t glaring—No, you know what? Just, no. What was I supposed to do, throw you a parade and become your groupie?”
We all know the finale did not happen, but because this came to my mind, why not (ignore the fact that I wrote a fix-it fic to that before and it’s kinda similar lol - titled "You didn't know shit" if I wanna check it out hah)
And he knew that the fact that he found his angel best friend in a male body hot and cute meant that he was not, as he previously thought, straight.
He and Cas were driving in silence. That is, before Dean noticed that the angel is taking off his trench coat.
Also, one more thing: a few days ago I wrote the final 50th drabble and I'm thinking of posting the remaining ones maybe twice a week? On one hand, it'd end more quickly 😢, but on the other, I've been posting only once a week because I didn't wanna run out of chapters that I had written ahead, and since there's no more to write... idk, can't decide - so for now just know that there's a chance I'll post a new one on Wednesday or something
This chapter is based on the scene when Cas comes back in season 13, but here he's been in a relationship with Dean before he died hah
They talked before and they agreed not to tell Sam, or anyone for that matter. This was theirs and they wanted to keep it that way for now. If Sam catches them kissing one day, that's okay. But they’re not gonna announce it, at least not yet, while it's still fresh and… what exactly was that? It’s not like they’re ‘boyfriends’ now. Okay, they both are not gonna sleep with other people or date other people. But screw labels. They haven’t said it and maybe they don’t realize it yet, but they love each other. So they’re together and exclusive and in love. But that won’t change anything in their lives, except for the fact, that now they can kiss or have sex or talk to each other about things they couldn't before. And understand each other better. But it doesn’t change the fact that they’re best friends. And they hunt together. This won’t change much. It will just give them those rare moments of happiness.
Also, I'm gonna try to post more regulary, like once a week (probably on Sundays) but we'll see how it works out hah
"Go back to sleep, Dean. I'll be fine." Cas said. He sounded tired. He was tired. Not only because he couldn't sleep. He was tired of being powerless. And unnecessary. He couldn't understand why Winchester brothers still claimed that they needed him. What could he give them now? Maybe just knowledge. But maybe not even that. He just felt like he didn't matter.
“Cas, wake up” he said quite loudly. He didn't know how this whole angel sleep worked, but Cas woke up immediately. “Imma take a shower. We're leaving soon.” after those words he disappeared in the bathroom.
Finally, Dean managed to find and burn the object souls there tied to. Then they just kinda stood there, catching a breath.
And when a waitress in a diner smiled flirtatiously at Cas, calling him handsome, and Cas smiled back, because he was polite and didn’t get that she was flirting, Dean’s mood went from giddy to angry within seconds.
Then there was a moment when Dean looked at Cas’ smiling, happy face, and he felt like there were only the two of them there, as if everyone else ceased to exist in that moment. He could barely hear the noise of the crowded bar, the sounds of Jack and Sam talking. There was only Cas, laughing at something Jack said.
The angel was sitting at the library table, books all around, on the table, on the chairs, on the floor. And Cas had his face hid in his hands, and it seemed that he was… crying.
All of them took it pretty hard. But Cas… Cas was Jack’s father. Jack’s relationship with him was different, stronger, than with the brothers. And so Cas couldn’t let it go, even for a second. He needed to find a way.
“How does that whole sleeping thing work? I mean, do you dream? How can you just fall asleep?” Dean asked, eyes not leaving the road. Cas looked too adorable after waking up. His hair a little ruffled, his expression softer than usual… blue eyes almost glowing, but that’s usual too. It was getting dark outside and they were on the road in the middle of nowhere, where there weren’t even any cars.
Then they walked into the garage and into their respective cars. They both knew Dean was going to call not even five minutes into the drive, and talk to Cas on speakerphone for as long as he would be able to, to Sam’s annoyance and amusement.
That night, Cas didn't feel the need to fall asleep. To run away from reality and worries. His reality now was laying in bed with Dean Winchester. And when he looked at Dean's calm, beautiful face, all his worries disappeared for a moment. That night he made a promise to himself. He decided to stop doing reckless and stupid things, or things Dean would consider reckless and stupid, that endangered his life. He won't dare to die again, as Dean told him to. After all, around here nobody dies permanently. So if he came back again, Dean would be so pissed. So yeah, Cas will try really hard not to die again. For Dean.
"Sorry, buddy, but I had to wake you." Dean said quietly, more amused than anything else. "I'm cold and you were hogging the blanket and I'm too lazy to get out of bed."
And finally, opposite to Dean, in another armchair, was Sam Winchester. He was Dean’s younger brother. He was seventeen, in high school, and visiting his brother during winter break. But he was… not like his brother. In Dean’s words, he was a geek. With great grades and already knowing exactly what he wants to do in the future. Dean was in college, but even he had no idea what he wants to do. Sam wasn’t smoking with them. He took few puffs just so they wouldn’t tease him about how lame and uptight he is. And he knew them all for years, he knew they would do that. Then they stopped paying attention and he was just observing them with amusement.
Now Dean was above Cas. Well, his legs were next to Cas', but his head was above Castiel's head and his hands on each side of Castiel's head.
“How about this diner around the corner?” Benny said. “You know, the one where the guy you’re in love with works.” he said and Dean was surprised that his tone wasn’t even teasing like always. He just said that so casually, like it was the most common fact.
“Cheers.” Sam said, and they all clinked their bottles together. Then each of them took a sip of their beer.
“Son of a bitch.” Dean whispered, when he realised where his thoughts are going. No. No, no, no. This ain’t happening.
“That waitress was trying to flirt with you and Dean was jealous. Hence the kiss, to show her that you’re taken and she has no chance.”
“I miss Eileen.” Sam murmured, as his girlfriend was on her own hunt and was going to meet up with them later. “I’ll go outside and call her.” he sighed, still sounding amused, and Dean could almost hear the eyeroll.
It was so fun to write it all, and each kudos and comment really motivated me, even when I was running out of ideas or had a writer's block hah
“Don’t be a smartass.” Dean said into Cas’ lips, as he kissed him for the first time. He would never say it out loud, but he could literally see and hear fireworks as their lips touched. And maybe he could? Who knew how Heaven worked, right? He immediately knew that this, kissing Cas, would forever be his favorite thing.
“Dean, relax.” Sam sighed, when Dean was running all over the apartment, looking for his favourite t-shirt. “You’ll figure out what you wanna do together.”
This one is probably really similar to drabble number 9 (in public) but they are all kind of repetetive so who cares lol
But then as she brought their bill, she slipped Cas her phone number, as if Cas had shown any interest in her at all. And that’s when he felt a little petty, and, even though he wasn’t that big on PDA, especially as he was still getting comfortable being with a man (or at least an angel in a male body - it stopped being a vessel long ago), he made sure the waitress was looking at them and chose that moment to gently grab Cas’ chin, turn his head towards himself, and leave a soft kiss on his lips. Before he broke the kiss though, he shot a look at the girl, who was now looking away, blushing, clearly embarrassed. Dean smirked, as he pulled away.
) if anyone is interested 😊 (it might be one of my faves I've ever written, tho the first chapter might be a bit meh haha)
“No. I never intended to tell you, because I knew it could ruin our friendship.” Cas said slowly, as if thinking carefully of every word.
We're at 30! Omg it seems like it's going so fast, even though I literally post one drabble a week hahaha
“Yeah, you did good” Dean started walking to the door. Cas was confused. Dean was confusing him, which wasn’t really anything new. One minute Winchester was basically an assbutt, the next he was quite nice. The angel wasn’t complaining about it, tho. He wanted them to finally go back to normal, without Dean’s weird mood swings, if it can be called that.
After they greeted each other, Sam said “You hungry? I bought some food, yes, including your pie.” he rolled his eyes, as he saw his older brother opening his mouth to ask.
But he didn’t hear an answer. Next thing he knew, Cas was kissing him harder and more passionate than ever before, shifting so that now he was lying on top of Dean. It was a long, hot, incredible kiss. When Cas pulled away, they were both out of breath.
“Hello?” Cas answered and Dean felt this familiar warm feeling he got every time he heard Cas’ voice.
“Not on me, but I got a stash at my place. We could go even now. I mean, if you want to. And my brother’s there, but he’s cool.”
“I know.” Dean sighed, putting his forehead against Cas’. “Be careful. Call me as often as you can.”
“I don’t know how to explain this... “ Cas bit his lip the moment Dean glanced at him and Dean took a sharp breath and licked his lips. This was too much. “I don’t really
Omg we're at 40 😱 ten more to go (and I have just two more to write and I've been putting it off because I kinda don't wanna finish this series hahaha)
The kiss wasn’t anything passionate or desperate. It was more sweet, and tender, and slow, and maybe even casual and lazy. They both had their heads on Dean’s pillow, their lips moving against each other in perfect synch. It was not rushed, or leading to anything, or even having any reason other than love behind it. They were just kissing for the sake of kissing. Dean finished it with a few pecks to Cas’ lips, then grinning at him.
Then one night, he was lying in bed, on his back, observing Cas, who was sitting back against the headboard, and reading a book. And suddenly he made a decision. Which surprised him, because he was not even aware he was seriously contemplating it. It was just a thought he didn’t really take into consideration. Or so he thought.
"Cas." he whispered. "Cas, c'mon." he pulled on the blanket again. It was maybe ten minutes of that, not wanting to wake his friend up. "Well, fuck it." he said to himself.
“So…” Sam started. “Did anything interesting happen?” he watched Cas closely. He wanted them to finally stop acting as if they didn't know about their feelings for each other. This sometimes got too awkward for Sam, when they were all in one room. All that staring and tension and eye-fucking was killing him.
And Sam never said a word. Well, when he was alone with his brother, he did tease him a little about it. Of course he did, they're brothers. But he never meant any of that in a bad way. He was so happy for his brother.
“Just… stuff.” Dean shrugged, averting his eyes. He felt Cas shift and lie on the pillow next to him. “And… I think we should move.” he said so quickly he wasn’t sure even he heard himself correctly. There was silence, so he peeked at Cas, who was looking back at him. “Cas?”
“C’mon, kid.” Dean rolled his eyes, leaning back in his chair and putting his free hand behind Castiel’s chair. “Let’s leave that for tomorrow morning. For now, we drink and relax.” he took another sip of his beer and sighed.
"Hey, angel, what do you say we go to sleep now?" Dean panted, his forehead against Castiel's. There was a little smile on his face, and he couldn't help it. He finally kissed Cas. He spent so much time denying those feelings and cursing himself for always focusing on Cas' lips when they were talking. And now here they were.
“Yeah, I’ll try. I might need a little kiss for good luck, though.” he added with a smirk, and Cas rolled his eyes, but was happy to oblige, and kissed him deeply again, this time for a shorter time.
“So, what now? Do we get back home or do we look for another case?” Jack asked eagerly. He was on enough hunts that he knew how it worked, but he still could get really into it and wouldn’t want to stop helping people.
He tried to convince himself, but really, who was he kidding? He was attracted to the angel and maybe even more… Damn.
“Thanks, Sammy” Dean grinned, going straight to the kitchen, leaving Cas and Sam alone. There was a soft smile on Cas’ face as he stared after Dean.
“Why, do you have some?” Cas laughed, but he caught himself really considering it. You gotta try everything, right?
“Yeah, but this is Cas.” Dean had to go out in twenty minutes if he wanted to be on time. “I really, really like him, Sammy.” he stopped in the door to his room and looked at his brother.
Anyway, it was possible ghost hunt. When Sam told Dean that he's not going, Dean just wanted to go alone. But now he's stuck in the car with Cas. And they had another argument right after they left, at the beginning of this travel. Because of course Dean had to say something. Something like: “I suppose ghosts aren't likely to kill you, but just try not to do anything massively stupid again”.
“In love, huh?” Sam asked teasingly. That he was not aware of, and he was undoubtedly the person that knew literally everything about Dean.
“Of course you do.” Sam muttered quietly, closing yet another book he’s looked through. They’ve been stuck in the library doing research for too long for their liking.
Sam laughed at that and Dean just hung up. It was about making good impression, not...ugh. Well, Cas knew him for over a year now and still wanted to go out with him, so maybe he didn’t have to panic as much. And he kinda ruined the ‘first’ impression when he asked him out while high… All that is left is not making a fool out of himself on the date.
“I guess.” Winchester looked at Castiel. He was smiling softly and looked so relaxed. It was a rare sight. He glanced at Dean and his smile widened a bit. Blue eyes met green ones for about two seconds, and something happened. Something clicked in Dean’s mind.
Finally one in which it’s Cas who kisses Dean, lmao I really have no idea why I always write it the other way haha
I liked it when I first wrote it, now I'm not so sure... but it's written, so posting it without ovethinking haha (It's not that easy, I overthink a lot)
“Just felt like kissing you.” Dean answered and leaned in closely, so that his mouth was next to Cas’ ear - the one the guys didn’t see when he was turned to Dean. “I’m just really happy. Here, with you.” he whispered. He felt weird saing mushy things like that but he felt dizzy. Maybe that was because he had a few beers too many, or maybe he hit his head a bit too hard, but either way, he felt happier than ever.
“His first professional role and he’s practically the lead, oh Dean! Tell him how proud I am! Better yet tell him to call me so I can tell him myself.”
Dean didn’t speak to Mary Winchester much these days, outside the occasional text, and as far as he was aware Sam didn’t either. It’s not that he felt that John had been more in the right – Dean spoke even less to him once he moved out to Minnesota for good, and after he was a no-show at Sam’s graduation that didn’t look to be changing anytime soon – but Mary running off to New York after the divorce was a betrayal of a different sort. Dean didn’t blame her for being hurt, but he did blame her for leaving them behind after their dad had made a choice that clearly wasn’t
“Dean, I would like to know what I did to upset you,” he answered. “We’d barely met, and practically the first thing you said to me was to insult my voice.”
They were most of the way through the selections in the packet when Michael interrupted Naomi halfway into announcing “Mr. Mistoffelees” as the next song. His whisper seemed to catch the no-nonsense woman off guard, and they whispered back and forth for a while, Bartholomew sometimes chiming in, causing the actors to fidget and side-eye each other. At length the music director cleared her throat. “Sam and Dean Winchester? ‘Old Deuteronomy,’ please. Sam, you may open the song.”
Wide eyed, Dean looked up at the voice’s source, and saw a face. In parts, at first: a full, pink mouth, stubbled cheeks, strong nose, very blue eyes, wild dark hair
This time it could be different, it could be real. If he could do it. He tried to choke it out around his nerves, articulate his hopes and desires, wanted to tell Castiel how gorgeous he was, and talented, and how much he admired him and wanted him and— “Me…me too,” he said.
Dean stared at the door as it swung shut. He could feel his face burning with embarrassment, but mostly anger, and an insidious shame that someone like Joshua Gardner had witnessed his humiliation…and a lingering fear that Crowley would make good on his threat and get him fired, and that Castiel would back up his play, because of course he was the untouchable one. And what would that mean for Sam? His brother had only asked him to audition because he’d wanted his big brother’s support, but the reality was – and probably always had been – that Dean has only ever held Sam back.
was to call him out on it, make a joke, tell him to put his money where his mouth is. But his brain wasn’t in charge at the moment. All he managed was, “Yeah, Cas, please.”
The room was bare but for an old upright piano, its bench, and a couple of chairs. Dean tucked his things into a corner and sat down at the piano. He hit a few notes to see whether it was in tune (this was Paradise, of course the piano’s in tune, unlike the shitty practice rooms on Sam’s old campus), and settled down for a little “
