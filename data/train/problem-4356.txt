“I know that was a lot to take in,” he said.
Jody held her breath. “You boys sure do get into some shit,” she said.
“Yes.”
Upon making it to the bunker, Sam offered to go out for groceries. Castiel thanked him. He was being kind and giving them alone time.
“Am I yours?”
He could live without the late-night drives. He could live without the stolen conversations on deserted highways and near-empty diners. He could live without the closeness. He could live without the smiles. He couldn’t live knowing he hadn’t done all he could. He couldn’t.
He had Sam — he would always have Sam — but he thought he’d have Cas, too. He thought, of all people, surely, the angel would outlive him. Surely, the angel would be by his side.
“I did, too.”
“Yes,” said Dean.
do. I missed you,” said Dean.
Or would she find out the truth?
“Cas, are you sure? Absolutely sure this will work?”
Dean sighed. She had read the journal; she had heard the truth from Castiel. What more was there to say?
Sam stilled, but Mary smiled. Warm and inviting.
"Yes,” they said, in unison.
, implied his tone.
He would say it all if he felt Dean would hear him, but he was too caught up in tying his own noose to listen.
In seconds he was in front of Dean, taking the amber liquid from his hands and downing it in one shot.
“Dean…”
The car creaked in all the places he felt cricks. Add to that the blood in the backseat and on the passenger’s side window and the state of their clothes. They went through more bleach than salt these days. Having the King of Hell on speed dial meant he wasn’t exorcising demons as much anymore. He almost missed it. There was a comfort in routine, in simplicity. Demons were bad, angels didn’t exist. God is a deadbeat dad, the angels are vindictive, and the demons? They’re bureaucrats. It shouldn’t make sense, and yet it did.
The machines were beeping and humming all around them. It was a quiet comfort, being in the room with Naomi had unnerved him. Watching Dean battle Leviathans, seeing him confront his brothers and all matter of supernatural beings taught him a thing or two about courage and the strength it took to face his fears. He could do that.
“I raised you from perdition, and I wanted you to remember.”
Dean would only seek the journal when he felt off-kilter. Perhaps with age, he thought, he’d grow to understand the man his father had been, the man he was raising them to be. John kept his sons at arm’s distance, but he was frank in his accounts.
“Pull out the cassettes and pick your favorites,” he said. He kept his eyes on the road but saw Sam’s eyes widen in the rear-view mirror. He knew he wasn’t going to live this down.
, he prayed.
body before.
After some time, they’d settled in the den. He and Sam stood near the wall, listening to the others recount their hunts with Asa. There was a knock at the door. Asa’s mom answered the door and they made their way to the den.
Was it that first day, back in the barn, when he learned there were things he couldn’t kill with Ruby’s knife? Was it when they’d sat across from each other with Cas sharing his deepest secrets? All the things he hadn’t dared share with another soul. Or was it when he pushed him against the wall, covered his mouth, and willed him to understand what he was doing, and for whom?
Live and learn.
She kept her eyes on him, taking in every word.
“Morning, Dean,” said Castiel. He was flipping through the book having finished it early in the morning. He enjoyed these lunch poems. He found them charming. There was a simplicity he had come to appreciate in his time as a human.
He stood then and walked over to the whiskey and served himself three fingers. Castiel didn’t object.
“We know,” said Crowley.
Dean pulled away first. He said, “I've held down jobs and been in relationships, but I've never had a home — not since you died, and not until we found this place.”
Patience stopped and turned; arms crossed over her chest.
“Bed?”
“I didn’t realize you loved him,” she said, after some time.
Dean slept for several more hours, and Castiel remained by his side throughout. He had been drawn to Heaven while there, but now that he was back on earth, he knew he wouldn’t leave. Watching Dean sleep brought him peace and tranquility and being in Heaven had only brought unease. He should’ve felt comforted. Comforted in the knowledge that he was a solider, that he had a purpose, and that God had chosen him.
He opened his eyes and ran his hands across the Impala. Leaning against her felt good. She grounded him. And he needed this. Needed to feel the ground beneath his feet, so he could begin to forget that moments ago, it had opened and swallowed his brother whole.
John was authoritative and distant. Dean’s formative memories were full of fear and submission and violence. And he could accept that, could accept that this was his lot in life until he met Adam.
Jody had been hugging Sam, who came to stand next to Dean. “On the way home, mom and I will sit in the back. Haven’t had a chance to talk to her much,” he said.
God, Dean hated thinking about it. He hated thinking about Lucifer walking around in his brother’s body as if it were his, using his hands as if they were his own. Corrupting the world with his touch.
He kept his eyes on the road. He was trying to focus, trying to will the tears from falling, because if he started crying now there was no way he’d stop anytime soon.
Castiel glared at him, but Dean just smirked and kept munching.
Other times, he would bunch his nose when he was feeling defiant. And though Dean would never say it, it eased him to know Castiel wasn’t cold and unfeeling like the other angels. He was still a being of infinite power. One Dean hadn’t doubted since he had stabbed him in the heart and watched him pull the knife out, cleanly.
"I have some pictures from when we were little,” began Dean.
Didn’t she understand? No… No, she didn’t. The future is still new to her, this is all still new to her. How do I tell her all that’s happened, all that’s changed, when so much is still the same, and seemingly unchanging?
He smiled, sincerely. The genuine smile that made his eyes crinkle. And Dean couldn’t remember the last time he had seen the angel look at him so fondly.
Dean started tossing and turning well into the night. Immediately, Castiel was at his side. By this point, the thin sheet was only covering his lower half. And the black t-shirt was riding up, exposing the small of his back.
At that, Sam cleared his throat.
Castiel stood and wrapped Dean in his arms, and Dean cried into his shoulder. He took short, uneven breaths. Mary didn’t say a word as they stood there. It was the second such time she was privy to a moment between them in as many days.
“How long have you been standing there,” said Dean, as he pulled away and reached for the beer.
The car ride was tense. Dean drank his coffee in silence as he drove but didn’t touch his donuts.
Dean took the seat next to him. “Really wasn’t the plan.”
“Cas?” he said.
“Mom said you gave her perspective,” said Sam, filling in the blanks.
“How are you feeling?”
“If you fucking say you’re sorry, I’ll never forgive you,” said Dean. He was still resting his head on his arm.
Once they were parked on the shoulder, Jody made herself comfortable. She leaned against the window with her feet tucked underneath her. Only then did Dean speak.
“It’s not that, mom. I just — I just don’t want to see you get hurt,” he said.
“I’m much better than that,” said Castiel.
He met Jody’s eyes. His were red-rimmed and welling up with tears. He wiped them away.
Mary stared at him wide-eyed, not unlike Sam in Baby earlier.
His water bottle was mostly full, so he took a big gulp. Castiel didn’t want to ask how long they had been awake, but it was clear they’d had breakfast. There were two empty bowls and a half-empty box of cereal between them.
“I appeared next to him and he swerved. I — I couldn’t. I couldn’t stop it. I couldn’t fly us away, I couldn’t stop the collision from happening,” said Castiel.
“You know, she used to say angels were watching over me. I didn’t believe it. I still don’t, not really.”
“We were back in Lebanon. We went back to our house, for a case. The new owner, she told me she had found these pictures of us — all of us. She asked me if I wanted them. Of course, I wanted them, so I took them, and I’ve been — I’ve been holding onto them since.”
He wondered if Castiel ever felt trapped. He wasn’t meant for this life, and he wasn’t meant to be on earth. Surely, he wasn’t meant to be with a hunter.
“Don’t lecture. Besides, I don’t recommend it. Last time you drank a whole liquor store,” said Dean. There was no need to recount the incident. It played in both their minds.
He pulled the angel into a hug, wrapping his arms around his waist and breathing his scent.
“With me?”
Mary’s eyes started to water. A single tear fell, and she wiped it away. Castiel gave her a moment to compose herself before continuing.
, he wouldn’t say.
He and Dean had that in common, of course.
“I wish his ghost would stop haunting me.”
“Castiel, Castiel… What are we going to do with you?”
Castiel didn’t move or say anything. Dean sighed and took a drag. Cas watched him, expectantly. Moments later, he nodded. Dean laughed and then passed him the cigarette.
“I can’t.”
Dean wouldn’t have wanted Mary to know what their lives had been like. He would’ve said ignorance is bliss.
“Oh Cassie, you’ve died on this very floor. I know making a deal with you is akin to making a deal with the Devil. You angels are all the same: self-serving. And you have the audacity to say we’re untrustworthy.”
He pointed the knife at the demon before him. Crowley, having grown bored, slit the demon’s wrists and watched the exsanguination. There was a metal bowl on the floor collecting the blood. It would be stored and used later. They were always in need of fresh demon blood.
Just as well, some wounds wouldn’t heal. And some coasts would always have rocky shores.
“Now? Now, I understand everything. I think you do too. I forgive you for wanting to spare me, to spare me the pain of losing you forever, even though it meant losing you for a time.”
“You told mom,” he said, searching his face.
“I’m much older than you,” said Castiel. There was a hint of a smile.
“We didn’t want to wake Dean,” said Sam.
Castiel leaned in and returned the kiss. And in response, he said, “Nowhere.”
Dean laughed, “Yeah, angel. I know.”
“You could’ve called,” said Dean.
Castiel sat next to him. Having been human had made things easier between them. What had once been difficult or impossible to explain had come to make more sense to the angel. He understood the wave of emotions that could wash over you. He understood carnal desires. He understood the simplicity of a good nap. He understood more about Dean than he cared to uncover now.
Once inside, they made their way around the house. First, offering their condolences to Asa’s mother, and later introducing themselves to the other hunters. He was happily surprised to hear how far some of them had driven for the memorial. He hoped that when his time came, hunters would gather and recount stories of their times together.
“Car accident.”
“Oh? Did he?”
He took a deep breath.
“Me either,” said Dean, dejected.
"Mom,” he said, standing before her.
And now that man was dead, and the heartbreak was killing him.
“What are you doing,” asked Naomi.
“You know, Cas — well, he was still Castiel back then — had blinded a psychic. He had warned her his true form would be more than she — or any human, for that matter — could handle.”
No, he couldn’t and no, he wouldn’t. But Dean couldn’t think about that right now. Not while his face was swollen from the beating Lucifer had given him. He hated Lucifer. Hated him with every fiber of his being and every ounce of strength he could muster.
Castiel kept his hand on Dean’s cheek but drew him closer. Their eyes never moved, never looked elsewhere.
“What a year of fighting monsters and you’ve gone soft? Or is there another reason you can’t stand to watch?”
Dean pulled back the covers and beckoned for the angel to join him underneath. Meanwhile, he took another sip, humming excitedly.
They were on the Interstate when he looked over to see her leaning against the window and Sam, scrolling through his phone.
“I had a choice to make. I tried to heal him again, I was just trying to stop the blood. I couldn’t even do that. I spent all that time trying to heal him. Maybe I shouldn’t have called. Maybe I should have brought him to the hospital myself. I don’t know why that didn’t occur to me at the time, but it just didn’t.
“Dean,” said Castiel. “When you returned — first from Hell, and then from Purgatory — you had questions you wanted answered, and you sought those answers. I believe Mary deserves to do the same.”
“Yeah, well. I’m not feeling it today.”
, he wouldn’t say.
“Well, he already hated you,” said Sam.
“I didn’t realize it was this tense between them,” said Castiel. He took a seat at the table and Sam followed his lead.
“Your purpose is to do what you’re told! Obey! You’re an Angel, Castiel. It’s about time you started acting like one. You’re needed here, in Heaven, not gallivanting across the American continent with the Winchesters.”
This left Jody flummoxed.
When he was young, Dean read it for its resources. John’s detailed descriptions of the creatures he fought were useful to the boys. Once Sam started joining them, he started reaching for it, too.
He rummaged through his duffle until he found the clothes he wanted to wear and slipped back into the bathroom in silence. But Dean’s silence was very loud. And Castiel hadn’t taken his eyes off him. Now that he knew what it was like to touch him and taste him, he wanted nothing more than to do it again. Feel that skin under his fingertips, lick the water droplets on his shoulders, and dig his teeth into his neck.
She smiled at him as she entered, dropping the backpack by the door. Castiel would recognize that smile anywhere. There was so much of her in Dean. She was so generous with her affection — her smiles, her lingering touches — and so was he.
“If you summoned me here, then you must know. He’s my charge. We’re bonded, and I’m not going to leave him,” said Castiel. He was resolute.
“He loves you. Do you love him?”
As he moved into the room, Castiel informed Dean that Mary and Sam were packing their bags and would be leaving soon. They’d be gone for a few days, perhaps a week. Two, at most. Dean nodded absentmindedly while he worked.
Some nights, he still thought of that demon taunting him with Lisa’s face and Lisa’s voice, but he didn’t speak of it. Couldn’t speak of it to Sam. Wouldn’t dare mention it to Castiel.
“And Moose, what did he say?”
Castiel shrugged, but he already knew the answer.
“He is,” said Dean.
Dean nodded, not trusting his voice.
“It's a long story,” he said.
“Dean, you mean,” said Mary.
The possession was easy.
He looked down at his hands. She was right, of course. He was an Angel. His duty was to Heaven. And though he saw himself as the Winchesters’ guardian, he needed to be here. He didn’t want to be here, though. He didn’t want to be in Heaven. And he couldn’t bear to part with Dean. He couldn’t bear to be without him. This wasn’t her choice to make. It wasn’t anyone’s choice but his.
“Tell me about it,” said Dean.
He forgot to close it, and didn’t anything think of it, until now.
“I’m just, uh, gonna. Stop talking.”
into real life out loud words, says instead: “The lake’s in Kansas,” and yeah, maybe Sam held this back to see what Dean would do, so sue him, “like thirty miles away.”
“Then watch something else!” Dean shouts, willfully missing the point.
“What?” Sam starts. His head whips up to Dean, then to Cas, whose eyebrows are knit.
Cas opens his mouth, then closes it, then opens it again. Finally he says, “I know you keep...asking Dean. About that guy from your case. Mitch, I think? And how attractive he is, but Dean is always—”
“Not if I didn’t have to!” Silence follows the exclamation, and Sam even unburies himself from his laptop to give Dean the most incredulous look he can. Cas, across the table, sports a matching one. Dean huffs. “Oh, shut up. Both of you.”

The problem is, Dean is avoiding Cas.
Turns out, there’s a lot more to sexuality than Sam ever knew. Like - he
Cas! You wanna give me a heart attack?“
“Shit, uh, that’s - that’s not quite.” Well, no time like the present, “That’s a whole thing about, like, who you’re into? Like, a lot of...guys...are into...guys.” They’re both staring at him blankly. Sam takes a deep breath, says, “A lot of people find it reductive, actually, but it’s a pretty simple way to, like, quantify how you don’t just like one gender. And are. Bisexual.”
Dean flings his way off of Cas, scrambling to right himself and casting a red-faced look at Sam and then away from him. Cas, having no decency at all, continues to lounge there and look all at once absolutely exhausted and deeply pleased and nauseatingly debauched.
“So, what?” Sam asks, thinking about being very nearly trounced by the colony of each-usiges back at the lake and hearing the flutter of wings, of opening his eyes to a very vengeful - and very annoyed - angel. “You have -
“You...” Cas’ voice is rough and low, ground out laboriously like it’s vital Dean hear this before he sleeps, “are a

Dean says, “So, what, it’s got these...Kinsey Scales…?”

“Sammy.”
“Earth to Sam? Come in? No reason to pay you the big bucks if you keep sleeping on the job.”
“No, you stop talking.” It takes a moment for them both to realize Cas is making an accusation, not giving an order. “I bare...the soul...I don’t even have…to you...and you...try to die...by

Because he needs to talk about it, Sam’s sure.

Oh, no, uh—” Sam nearly bursts into laughter, but decides by the earnest look on Cas’ face that that’s probably a bad idea. Instead he says, “No. But...thanks, Cas. That’s...really nice.”
“Well, I. Of course I. I—“

There are charts and forums and positively lengthy lists of terms, many of which carry the same whiff of obscurity his usual research into lore tends to.
Cas’ breath is labored when he murmurs, “It seems...this resurrection...comes with certain...perks…”
“He died.”

“Hey, you. Stop talking,” says Dean.
“Oh, yes, fine. I just wanted to make sure you know I’m...here. If you ever want to...talk.”
“I am
“Yeah, that’s great. You know what, uh, I’ve, I’ve got to—”
“Sam?”
“I’m the reason he crashed,” said Castiel.
It was only natural for him to wonder.
It was uncanny seeing the same expressions on a woman’s face. Of course, they were cut from the same cloth.
“I don’t know what you mean by that,” Dean confessed.
“You’re mine,” he said, suddenly feeling possessive, remembering the Enochian sigils on Dean’s ribs. He had carved those himself.
“I knew that was you, in the dream. I knew that was you, and I knew why you were there. It – the dream – had been different before you arrived. And then, you were there, and we were here, and it seemed… Easy, within reach, so I reached for it. I reached for you,” he said, turning to face Cas.
“Mom, please don't do this,” said Dean.
If the endless staring unnerved him, as it once had, he didn’t say. Castiel would stop if asked, of course, but Dean hadn’t asked.
“I’ve been alive for a very long time, Dean,” he said.
“He will still need to have his spleen removed.”
But he didn’t know her. Truth be told, he had never known her, but he knew that now.
“Better,” he said.
She stepped back, unsure. Unsteady.
Was this how Cas felt when he had been stabbed with Michael’s lance? It was a slow, agonizing death, for sure.
He turned his back to them, walked around the kitchen island, and made his way to the sink. There, he turned on the faucet and reached for the sponge, still soapy from the last time it was used, and started washing the mug from which he had been drinking.
“Thank you, Mary. Is that all you wanted to ask me?”
They listened to the cassettes Jody had picked and found themselves singing along. She was in much better spirits when they arrived, for which Dean was pleased.
“This is all my fault.”
She was still, preternaturally still.
They were right about the fire, of course. Everything burned, hotter than lava. And there was Sam, bound to Lucifer for eternity. Forty years had felt like a lifetime. Dean couldn’t fathom an eternity in Hell, bound to the Devil.
“I’ll tell him,” said Dean.
“You have a gift. Don’t lock yourself away if it’s not what you want to do. You’ll be miserable.”
He looked down at their clasped hands.
“I blamed myself, for weeks. Didn’t matter, Heaven had other plans. They got him out, sure, but he was under their control.”
In the dream, Dean was sitting in the library. He was reading a book on angels, Castiel noted.
Dean knew the answer, of course. Dean knew he was the firstborn but never the chosen one, and it pained him. It left him feeling hollow; carved out. For so long he had wanted to understand, to be someone John would be proud of calling
“Damned if we do, damned if we don’t,” said Sam.
Was this an apotheosis?
He watched Dean drink his beer.
To her, these would be but words on a page. Yet, these were their memories. They weren’t just events recounted for posterity.
And now he was sitting in an office. The walls were white and bare; too stark. The fluorescent lights overhead added to the ambience. Though it wasn’t a hospital, there was a sterile, surgical quality to the room that made him uneasy.
Sam had spent so long running away from hunting, from his destiny. He could relate to Mary as a hunter. Or so, he thought.
And maybe he should’ve been more scared, maybe he shouldn’t have gone looking for the being who had pulled him free, but he couldn’t accept something that was too good to be true.
“And?”
“Trust me, Cas. You don’t want to know,” said Dean.
Castiel nodded. He wouldn’t, couldn’t deprive Dean, and so, they bid Mary goodnight.
When Castiel looked over, Dean was eyeing him. He couldn’t read the expression on his face. There was something he wasn’t saying. He would have to read to find out. He could do that. He would finish it by morning.
She’d gotten out. And then, she died.
Sam knew he was being dismissed but he was tired, and he wasn’t in the mode to argue with the angel.
Her eyes betrayed her.
Crowley watched him, his concern deepening.
“I want that, Cas,” said Dean, jumping the gun.
When God remade him, He remade him in His image. The humans were made in God’s image — not the angels and not the demons.
This Mary — who returned to an earth she had left over 30 years ago, who couldn’t look her adult sons in the eye when she spoke — she might as well have been a stranger. He thought he could understand. He had spent four months and 40 years in hell. He knew what it was like to come back, changed, to a place that had also changed.
“You’re asking me for help in overthrowing the Archangel in charge because your boyfriend is playing house and you don’t even have me in your contacts. I’m hurt. Wounded, even,” said Crowley with mirth.
“But you keep doing it. What is this, the third time this week? It’s pathetic. Man up and tell him you need him, or, move on,” said Crowley.
“I should be asking you that,” said Castiel.
She stood before her son and titled his chin. She wanted to meet his eyes. She was surprised to see there were tears. His voice didn’t break when he spoke.
“Yes, we bonded.”
“I know, but that doesn’t matter!”
Once they were on the highway, Castiel opened the glove compartment. Instead of taking out the box of cassettes, he pulled out a cassette that was on the side. Dean smiled. From the rear-view mirror, he could see Sam and his mom resting against each other’s heads. He turned to look at Castiel and said, “Go ahead, angel. They’re asleep.”
“And this is Mary Winchester, our mother,” said Sam, moving to stand beside her as they moved into the room. At that, there was a sharp intake of breath, and then the silence devolved into susurrations.
“No, you’re not dead. This isn’t heaven. I’m here to… I’m here to heal you. Do you remember? Do you remember why you’re here?”
Castiel stayed because there was nowhere else for him to be.
And where was she now?
“Okay,” said Dean.
Dean tensed.
She was dead.
And so, he knew he could only cry when he was well and truly alone.
She was young. She had her whole life ahead of her. Sure, he hadn’t been much older when he started hunting alone, but he hadn’t had a choice. That choice was taken from him when he was four.
When he was four, he held his baby brother in his arms, and watched his home go up in flames. Nothing had been right since. Nothing. And he couldn’t help but think of that day. He had been thinking about it since answering Missouri’s call.
Castiel didn’t speak, just nodded. He caressed Dean’s cheek and as he did, Dean closed his eyes, leaning into the touch. He felt that distant thrumming again. The pulsing light that had been his only source of hope mere moments ago.
He looked at her then, really looked at her. He had been ignoring her for so long. He had been keeping his distance, staying away from the library or the kitchen or the dungeon — wherever she may be, either with Sam or Castiel. But she was here now, in his room. The hoodie she was wearing (borrowed from Sam) was much too big, but it looked warm and comfortable. Her short hair was pulled back, away from her face. She was so young, but her eyes…
“I see so much of you in Dean. You are his mother, of course, but it’s more than that. You’re kindred spirits. He struggles with the things you struggle,” said Castiel.
There was more, of course. Things weren’t so cut-and-dry. No, John wasn’t concerned with holidays or class trips or school dances, but he didn’t want his sons to be ignorant of the world around them — the dark underbelly.
“Castiel, don’t you understand? It’s not up to you anymore. You aren’t God anymore. You never were. You were toying with godhood, with kingship. You were never very adept. I’m here to remind you of your true purpose. I’m here to remind you you’re a solider and Heaven needs its soldier boy.”
He hadn’t said all he had in mind. Dean had come to pull him back into their bubble. This wonderful space they occupied when the lights were off, the doors were closed, and they weren’t worried about demons — past, present, and internal — waging war on them.
He squeezed the excess soap and water, letting it drip down his fingers, and returned the sponge to its resting place. He put the mug on the dish rack and let it air dry.
Often, they would use the journal as a launching point. From there they would seek out more information, consult with experts. They didn’t have the experience or the connections, and so, John’s words were a godsend.
Now, he just wondered if the light was playing tricks on him. Or if this smile was just for him.
Sam and Castiel were waiting for Dean in the kitchen. Other hunters had come and gone. Castiel had noticed their questioning glances, but thus far, none had been brave enough to ask, save for the beer or ice. Dean made his way back to the kitchen, knowing Castiel would be waiting. He was thankful to find only Sam was keeping him company.
He turned to face Castiel and pulled him close. “I’ve told you everything there is to know. You’ve seen all of me, and if you want this… If you want this to be real, then it is.”
He dried his hands on his jeans and left the kitchen. He didn’t have anything else to say, and even if he did, he didn’t want to say it. He wanted to be left alone.
Dean noted the choice of words and smirked.
Sam would’ve thought it could bridge the gap between then and now, between Campbell and Winchester. It could serve as a conduit. Connecting them to a past both had left behind.
Mary nodded and followed her son out the front door.
He moved towards the desk and reached into the drawer. He held up a drawing for both Castiel and Mary to see.
“He was. He was alone. The car was… I’m sure he’ll — he’ll put her back together. He’s the one I’m worried about,” said Castiel.
He asked, uncertain because all the things he knew had come crashing down on him. He was left in a world populated by unknown, unknowable things, and this was the time to ask questions.
Dean kissed him. And for the first time, there was no looming threat. They weren’t clawing their way through Purgatory; they weren’t awaiting the end times. It left him breathless.
Dean was taken aback by the question. He was quiet for a few moments, unsure how to answer. In the end, he opted for the truth. “He raised me from perdition. His words, not mine,” he said.
Dean just nodded.
It was disquieting. The first time he rebelled he had been afraid. Afraid what lay before him, unsure of the outcome. Then he had died. Every atom pulled apart.
“Take off your coat, angel.”
“Didn’t think you were all going to gang up on me,” he said.
And so, Castiel surmised, Dean wouldn’t have given Mary the journal. Dean would have wanted to keep this from her. He would’ve wanted to spare Mary the gory details. And he would’ve wanted to keep the journal among his possessions for when he wanted to self-flagellate.
She was in pain; it was plainly written on her delicate features. Besides, Castiel recognized the expression. He had seen it often enough: on Dean, every time he was close to losing Sam.
“I can hear you,” he said.
Affectionately, he named Baby, and treated her as a home. She had been more of a home than any four walls. Castiel felt at peace in the car, with Dean behind the wheel. He was content to ride in the passenger’s seat.
“I apologize, a gathering of hunters wasn’t the way you wanted to come out,” said Castiel.
“I get that it’s a shock to see your kids as we are now. I had to meet a younger version of you who hadn’t met dad yet. So, if there’s anyone in this life who understands you, it’s me. But I can’t do this. I can’t do this, mom. I’ve lost too many people, but you feel further away now than you had ever been before. And it’s killing me.”
“She gave us her blessing,” he said. He placed his hand on top of Castiel's on his thigh.
With one hand, he held onto Castiel. With the other, he reached over and wiped a tear.
Castiel hid his head in his hands. He took a steadying breath.
“Dean, mom will be fine,” said Sam. “I’ll be with her,” he said, trying to be reassuring.
“I went to hell because he told me Sammy was the most important thing, and I believed him. When Jake stabbed Sam, I knew what I was going to do. I couldn’t live without Sam; I couldn’t live without my brother. But I couldn’t live without a purpose, and he was my purpose,” said Dean.
Later, he would give himself time to think about all this. He would give himself time to grieve. Time, he hadn’t had after Mary died, time John hadn’t given him when he passed, but which Sammy had. Sam had told him to take some time for himself, and selfishly, he would.
There was so much he wanted to say. So much, but he couldn’t form the words, just errant thoughts. There was intent and feeling and he hoped, for the first time in a long, long time. He had hope.
He would never feel at home on earth. He wasn’t a human, wasn’t meant for this plane of existence. And humans had changed this planet far too much. Only humans felt at home here.
He unbuttoned the trench coat and let it hang from the back of his chair.
And he’d pray — one of the rare times — that when the adrenaline wore off, he’d be able to sleep. For the allure of sleep was that he could wake up at any time and whatever nightmare he was in would come to an end.
“Oh, no. Don’t cry,” he said.
And so, through the heartbreak, he reached for this unknown and yet familiar thing, strumming along. It was pulsating. And as if on impulse, he reached for it. And as he held on, he felt it grow stronger. Gaining confidence, as it was now in control, it drummed masterfully.
At long last, Crowley took pity on him.
“Come to bed,” he whispered.
Crowley stood. He started pacing back and forth.
Castiel nodded solemnly. He didn’t need to say anything else. They both knew what Cas would go in to buy.
He couldn’t have foreseen what would happen next. Dean leaned into his space, titled his chin, and kissed him. Slowly, the way he had seen Dean kiss Anna all those years ago. And when Castiel pulled away, Dean pulled him back.
“He doesn’t let anyone pick the music,” said Sam, flabbergasted.
Sam ignored him.
“He paid me the most attention, but never the right attention. I did all sorts of things right under his nose and got away with them, and then there were other times... Well, I wasn't so lucky those times."
“Open up the glove compartment,” he said to Jody.
“Of course, you’re…”
“I needed that drink, but more than that, I needed you.”
Dean hated how long it had taken him to understand why Sam had left for Stanford. Dean had believed in John then, had believed in their mission. He had believed they were saving lives and changing the world. It had been a comforting thought, but it no longer comforted him.
“I thought you didn’t want to go back there.”
And boy, did he want to see more of it.
“What the fuck, mom? You take off, don’t call, and now I find out you’re hunting with Cas?”
He returned to the hospital; unsure how much time had passed. Dean was still holding his hand, though lax. He was sound asleep. The early morning light was filtering through the window. He must’ve been gone longer than he thought. How would he explain himself to Dean when he awoke?
He flipped through the journal and read a passage from Dean’s adolescence. Dean had been caught stealing and had been sent to a boys’ home. John hadn’t come for him, and Dean had settled into the place.
Dean groaned. “I didn’t know your voice could drop any lower. Fuck, sound –”
Once Lucifer tired of his vessel — and he would, for the angels loathed containment — he would leave. See, angels weren’t made for the flesh. They were ethereal. Existing as they always had, unchanged and unmoved. Time and earth and life changed around them, but not the angels. They observed, interfered when commanded, but otherwise, existed seemingly unperturbed.
Much like the angel…
“I just want you to stay. I want you to stay here,” he said, looking at the hands in his lap.
“Mom?” said Sam.
“Yeah, it was bad. Really bad,” said Dean.
He was worn out, stretched thin. And if he started talking now, he would say too much. He didn’t need to unload on Jody.
It was a low-blow, and they both knew it.
“I’m tired, mom. I just… I don’t know what I want, but it isn’t this feeling,” he said.
He never left the house without his gun and a few knives. He tucked them into his boots, in his jacket, and in his jeans. Was it the paranoia if there was precedent?
“I know,” said Castiel as he locked the door.
Give it time, Castiel wanted to say.
“I — I have a question for you,” she said.
“I have been many things to many beings,” said Castiel.
He was at his wit’s end.
Dean hated thinking of Sam, down there. He had died to save Sam from such a fate, and he had utterly failed.
Castiel nodded.
“Of course.”
Castiel saw the tears in her eyes.
Dean closed the space between them. He cupped his jaw and caressed his cheek.
Besides, Castiel didn’t sleep. And Dean was too tired to maintain appearances.
He had been working on the car for the last few days, ever since they came back from the last hunt. It had left her worse for wear. He had used the driver’s side door to decapitate a monster. He had dubbed it a
Mary nodded.
“Please don’t lecture me,” said Dean, holding up a hand. “Did she ask you to keep it a secret?”
He leaned his forehead against his knees and wrapped his arms around them. He looked so young like this. A young man who had lost everything – his father, his mother, and now, the man he loved.
“Do that again.”
Suddenly, he was tired. Tired of the lies; the tiers upon tiers of half-truths upon which everything was built. So, he was going to tell the truth. He should’ve been telling the truth all along, but he had to start at some point, might as well be now.
John thought he was doing the right thing. He thought he was protecting Sam and Dean. He taught them how to protect themselves, how to put their wellbeing aside for the sake of others. Or maybe, that was just Dean. Maybe his lessons were just for Dean, because Sam could envision a different future for himself.
They drove a few more miles until Dean spotted a motel where they could spend the night. The only room left was a single, but Dean didn’t object. And the receptionist was paid too little to care.
“Would you have said anything if I hadn’t asked?”
“Why’d you mark me? Why’d you leave a handprint?”
“Your mother’s going to find her Robin,” he said.
“Does this mean…?”
Fuck, this was not the time nor the place to come to a sudden, heart-stopping realization.
She closed John’s journal and held it close. He knew it well, for Dean read from it often. Castiel didn’t comment and Mary made her way down the stairs. Upon reaching the bottom step, she turned back. Facing Castiel, she started to speak, but the words were caught in her throat.
Cas had become… When had he become an integral part of his life?
She pulled him close and he nestled against her willing himself not to cry.
“Does he get to pick the music?”
Castiel nodded but Sam said nothing more and moments later, Dean opened the door. The towel was wrapped low around his hips. It was hardly secure and Castiel could see a trail of dark hair.
Crowley laughed.
Castiel nodded again.
Dean pulled him into a hug.
“Gimme a sec,” said Dean, taking another drag before putting it out with the heel of his boot. He walked over and unlocked the trunk. He caught Dean’s hesitation when he saw Sam’s duffel bag but made no mention of it. Dean tossed his over his shoulder and locked the trunk.
Dean would hold it tightly, its spine digging into his arm. “You’ll be here?”
“Don’t get cocky now.”
He needed definitive proof.
“If he doesn’t — if he doesn’t wake up,” said Sam.
He had to pause.
John had said he would have to save or kill Sam and God, Dean wished he had been able to save him. He had never wanted to kill his brother. Heaven had its plans and Heaven didn’t give a fuck what Dean wanted.
But most of all, Dean didn’t want to see pity in his mother’s eyes. He didn’t want her to pity them. He wanted her to have been there, goddammit, and she wasn’t. If she had been there, she could’ve prevented everything.
“Oh. He’s understanding. It clarified some things.”
Patience had started walking back to her house, and Jody followed her, calling out. “Patience, wait!”
Castiel’s grin grew.
“No, I do. I
Maybe it was because he kept thinking of his mom — of Mary. For so long, she had been this otherworldly thing, unlike any of the things they regularly encountered. She lived on in his memories, in the stories his dad told, and the pictures he kept in his drawer, but she had ceased to be. That was, until Amara had seen to that.
“Ha, yeah,” he said, laughing at a joke only he found funny.
Castiel didn’t seem to mind, had even expected it. Dean pulled over — much as he thought he would — and cried into the steering wheel. The angel reached for his hand and clasped it in his, squeezing softly.
“Of course,” said Dean.
“If — if he comes back,” Jody started to say, but Dean cut her off.
She said the name with as much disdain as she could muster. Castiel sat in stony silence. He wished he were back at the hospital. Dean was still recovering. He should be with him. He wanted to be with him.
Dean finishes off the call with, “And Mitch? Don’t go in the water,” then turns to Sam and Cas. “Apparently the whole crowd of them went back - looking for revenge or something, stupid kids. We gotta go
“That’s not—“ Dean hisses, but interrupts himself when Cas goes limp, “Cas! Shit.”
Sam doesn’t know
“Well.” Cas says, a voice loud against the room’s tension. He looks mutinous, takes a long moment to lever his way to his feet. “It’s good to know you care.”
“Yeah?”
But more importantly:
"It's not!" Sam huffs, picking a string of guts out of his hair, then focuses on calming down their incessantly barking dog. “Miracle. Miracle, it's us -
“No, no, it’s okay, I—” Sam hastily closes out of a dozen tabs ranging from a full-size rainbow flag to a dvd copy of
The words are sarcastic, and Sam can imagine them playfully so, any other day - or any day before Cas got yanked back from the Empty, anyway. But there’s something sharp and bitter, now, and it clearly leaves Dean floundering.
“I am not.” Cas insists. (It’s impossible to filter them out, apparently. Absolutely impossible, they’re too damn

wanted to push, though now he wonders if he should.
“...What?”
Well, trying to, anyway, and clearly failing, at least today - from Sam’s spot in the library, he’s got a front row seat to the the pair of them post-collision. Dean’s doing that shift-back-and-forth thing he does when he’s uncomfortable, and their favorite newly-resurrected is-it-a-houseguest-when-he-basically-lives-here angel is standing even stiller than usual, as though afraid to spook him. Sam, for his part, sinks down a little in his chair, hoping they won’t notice him there behind his laptop screen.
The confused look Cas gives him is a direct counterpoint to his red eyes. “Yes, of course, Dean. Why do people keep asking that?”
“You know,” Sam says, gentle, “if you need to talk—”
“I come out quite frequently. You always seem to be otherwise engaged.”
Sam shouts, chucking the rest of the bag at his brother, “So you can do all...
Cas says, “Sam, I do not understand how the creature’s sexual proclivities—”
What the fuck. Sam trains his own stare on his brother, and wonders if this is, in fact, the point where they talk about boys. He clears his throat.
“Dean—“ Sam starts.
Cas starts to get up, his glare matching Dean’s. Sam might as well not be in the room, again. “I’m coming,” says Cas.
Dean, Sam thinks, would be blushing if he were prone to it - he’s not, so he shifts awkwardly on his feet instead. Finally, Sam says, “I wouldn’t worry too much. I’m pretty sure people come back from the dead in that show all the time.”
Sam gives them his best

Almost reflexively, Sam grumbles, “You don’t pay me at all.” He does indeed blink back to his laptop screen, though his mind is still more than halfway on Dean and Cas and Dean-and-Cas and the mortifyingly teen-girl question of
“You’re not,” says Dean.
By evening, he’s got at least twenty tabs open and the table is overflowing with open books and print outs, only about a quarter of which have anything to do with the current case. It’s very peaceful, and thus inevitably interrupted - this time by Cas’ voice, in that loud, frustrated growl that probably would read dangerous if Sam were not so used to it. It’s Cas’

“I don’t think you’re overcompensating.”
“Water monsters. In

“I believe Sam is…’giving you a hard time,’ as it were.”

Sam is hiding his own smile when he glances back to his computer screen. His eyes catch on a line. Huh. “Hey, check this out.” He spins his laptop around.
“We did not say anything.” Cas says, but Sam knows him well enough by now to identify smugness under his typical deadpan.
Here I was expecting some bisexual lake guy named Kinsey—”
“Hey Dean?”
“Water creatures, sure! Shapeshifting, totally! But you didn’t say
It’s Dean’s, it turns out, and he casts a final baffled glance at Sam - who is feeling stupider by the second - before he answers it. “Agent Frampton. Hey - hey. Hey, Mitch, dude, slow down. What - by the lake? You sure? Just...just stay put, okay. We’ll be there soon.” He’s moving around the room, now, all business, picking up his coat and tossing Sam’s to him.
“Don’t you correct me!” Dean blusters at him, “You’re an idiot, you don’t get to do corrections.”
“A what?” Dean asks, distracted.
“Uh...a while back. That case in Connecticut. The one with the creepy dollhouse.”
Miracle mostly placated, Sam turns, then trails off when he realizes that once again no one is listening. Cas is too busy trying to hold himself together, and Dean is too busy lowering Cas down into a chair with intense gentleness, a direct contrast to his harsh words.
“Uh...thanks?” Dean just looks perplexed, and Cas looks amused, and Sam has a sudden, perfect moment of clarity where it dawns that maybe, possibly, Dean already knows that. Maybe it doesn’t even occur to Dean that Sam might not. Maybe Sam’s not the one Dean ever had to talk to at all.
. Emphasis on
“Fine.” Cas says, a little breathless, deeply frustrated. “I may not be up to my full strength, but no doubt I am strong enough to help you with— what was it, again?”
“Yes, well. It’s not like you come out. Of your room. I mean—”
Dean stops all his fidgeting. His mouth works, for a moment. He gets up, then sits back down.
“Shared space! This is a

“Shut up, Sammy,” Dean says, and that’s that.
He googles it instead.
“I don’t know what the fuck you’re drinking this morning, but you either gotta share it or stow it, because there’s hoof-prints-and-human-livers-at-the-lake weird and then there’s you-right-now weird, and I’m thinking I wanna hang out with the livers.”
then looks up. He cuts himself off at the sight of Cas, a blanket around his shoulders and his paleness of late highlighted by the slight red rims around his eyes. “Cas? Are you okay?”
Cas lolls a bit to one side. Dean kneels, putting himself directly under the slouch so Cas has somewhere to lean; he peels a bit of seaweed of Cas’ neck.
“I do not know what you mean.”
“There are quite a few things that...do not make sense. And I do not appreciate the implication that humanity is something inherent to goodness, nor the supposition that it can simply be turned off and on at will. I have, however, found some of the characters...compelling. The vampire hunter, for instance. I liked him.”
When Dean leaves the room, he closes the door very, very quietly. Then he leans against it, tilts his head back and closes his own eyes.
and “

“Oh, yes, because you have never gone into danger unless you were, as you say, ‘one hundred percent.’”
“And I told you not to die,” Cas notes. His voice is weak but his glare is fierce. “You were doing a very poor job of it.”
. Cas, eyes closed, probably doesn’t see it.
“Hey! Disappearances, right?”
According to google, this isn’t a thing to be blunt about.
“Not from me,” Sam says. Dean’s eyebrows fly into his hairline and he gives Sam a scornful look that is clearly a dismissal. Sam, having no idea how to put
Another silence. That seems to be a thing, these days.

“I said, I don’t think—“
Which is fair. God knows he’s spent enough time walking on eggshells around Dean’s moods; damn near every apocalypse seems to come with a side of emotional turmoil his brother wants desperately to avoid. As search terms go, “
“Sa—”
And Sam should be someone he can say it to, right? They spend all their fucking time together, anyway, at home and in motels and in the little metal box that is a moving car. They’ve had intense emotional heart-to-hearts with actual literal capital-G God - they can handle a little boy talk. Talk about boys, that is. Right?
“Mary, she’s like you,” said Castiel.
Sam took a sip from his coffee as he reached for it. He eyed it curiously.
Castiel placed his palm on Dean’s thigh and Dean scooted closer.
“Castiel, you do belong,” she said.
“Did you leave then? Why did Sam call you?”
And so, Castiel sat in front of her and pulled the journal from her hands.
“Dean is… Older and wearier. None of his deaths have been kind,” said Castiel.
They both turned to face each other again.
“No, I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t have said anything not because I don’t want you to know, but because I don’t want to share this. I don’t want to share him. I’ve lost him before, and I don’t think I could handle losing him again.”
“Dean, I’m not leaving.”
Dean would hum happily as he drank the sweet, warm liquid.
He just wanted to listen to music and drown out the pain.
Dean couldn’t breathe, couldn’t speak. And even if he could, he didn’t know what to say to that, so he didn’t say anything. He just nodded and made his way to the bathroom.
“You should get some rest. I will watch over him.”
He didn’t know anyone like her. He didn’t know anyone with her capacity to love again after such loses. She put her trust in them, and she put her trust in Alex and Claire. Now, it seemed she had put her trust in Asa. And he was gone.
“Just get it out, and then, we’ll get back on the road,” she said.
“If you fuck with me, you’ll be next. Surely, you know there are consequences to your actions. You can’t keep running around, doing whatever you please. Surely, you get that now?”
Dean didn’t need clarification; he knew what she meant, what she was asking.
“Yeah, she did,” said Dean.
They drove to nowhere in particular so long as it wasn’t in Kansas. Dorothy was right, of course, there’s no place like home. So, what if Dean hadn’t had a home since he was four? There was still no place like it, but Dean couldn’t be in Kansas right now.
“I – I can’t remember if I gave you this,” he said, turning to face him.
Once he left, Sam would be left staring at the blood on his hands, for they were still his. Despite all the damage Lucifer wrought, they would still be Sam’s hands.
That was Sam, that was always Sam.
“No,” said Crowley at the same time Castiel said, “Yes.”
“I thought I could keep her safe that way, but it didn’t work. It never does.”
“Dean, it’s not like that. She’s not leaving,” said Castiel.
Crowley eyed him quizzically.
“Mom, I was 29 when I went to hell. And Castiel was the angel who pulled me out of the pit. I owe him my everything,” said Dean.
As if summoned, Castiel appeared before him. Whole, unblemished, as he had looked that day in the barn. And wait, wait, that couldn’t be… Could it?
When Castiel entered, Dean was cleaning his guns. It was therapeutic. Something he could do and could do well. He didn’t have to think about it, didn’t have to weigh his options.
“Because I know his soul, more intimately than I know any other thing on this earth. I remade him once, I am certain I could do it again.”
“No, no. Don’t say that. You’ve lived, what, millions of years? But I spent more time in Hell than I’ve spent on earth and I’ve been wasting it. Time I could’ve been with you.”
Dean had never told Sam what he saw in that future Zachariah had showed him, and Dean could never tell him. He had followed his future self to the end. And before him had stood Lucifer, dressed in white from head to toe, as if he were a fucking bride walking down the aisle.
"He wasn't concerned with that, mom. He was concerned with finding Azazel — Yellow Eyes, the demon who killed you. That was all,” he said.
Each had a pencil in hand and was circling different phone numbers. Sam was noting the names and addresses into John’s journal.
“I drink,” said Dean.
He rubbed his palms on the front of his trench coat.
Dean pulled away and threw his head back. He kept thinking of those last few nights in Purgatory. He thought of the dream — the dock, the fish in the lake, and the water lapping against the shore. He looked over at Castiel.
Castiel rose from his seat and made his way toward Dean.
He didn’t know how to do anything else, and the one time he had tried, it blew up in his face.
Dean titled his chin and leaned in to kiss him.
“Not here, he went for his run. He should be back in a half hour.”
Angels and demons have no soul, but all beings have an essence. However, Castiel wasn’t an angel, not like the angels in heaven. When he had been remade — by God, after they stopped the apocalypse — he had been remade in this form. He no longer looked at his reflection and saw his vessel. When he looked at his reflection, he saw himself.
He hadn’t given the angels this much thought. But now, he couldn’t stop thinking about them and their vessels. He had been so close to being one himself.
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, angel.”
“After you left Heaven, how long did it take to feel at home here, on earth, in the bunker?”
When Dean awoke, Castiel was in his body. He had taken Sam’s seat in the far corner. Crowley had left, not wishing to be around for another emotional conversation. Sam had left to get something to eat. Though, in all actuality, he wasn’t hungry. He had left to give them some privacy. He knew a thing or two about possession, and knew it was a lot to process.
Mary reached for his hand. “I knew, from the moment I saw the two of you hug in the library. And he’s told me all about you on our hunts. You have my blessing,” she said.
“No, we can deal with damned. We’re all damned. Say it works. You possess him and cure him of his maladies. What next? Without your grace, your vessel would begin to decay. We have no way of knowing how long it would take for an angel to heal a human with these many injuries. He has a concussion, broken ribs, a broken arm, and a ruptured spleen. You’ll have to remove the spleen.”
“Hello, Dean,” said Castiel. The other hunters turned to face Dean, who made his way to stand beside Castiel, who was still standing next to Mary.
“They hunted him in Purgatory,” said Dean.
They had shared dreams before. Castiel eased his nightmares, they chatted about things they weren’t comfortable discussing in front of Sam, Mary, or other hunters. Often, they talked about Hell. The years Dean had been tortured and his time as a demon, torturing others.
The air was asphyxiating. He could roll down the window, but that wouldn’t help.
He was a celestial being. He was light and intent and that luminous explosion was the end. There was blood and viscera scattered through the air, but it wasn’t the end. He was brought back, and this time, he was remade in God’s image and given a body. This was no longer a vessel. It was his body. Though there was no soul, it was his. And he took great pleasure in that. He had been on earth before, and he had been in a human body before, but he had never been in
His convictions had all but dragged him to Hell.
“So then, where are you going,” said Dean, smiling as he spoke.
Instead, here he was, pleading with the King of Hell.
Dean did not.
“And he will have to recover from that surgery,” said Castiel.
He wished he could touch him there, run his fingers along his spine. Turn him over and pin his arm above his head. Dean’s voice would be gruff when he spoke, wondering what was happening. Castiel would hush him, two fingers on his lips. Dean would nod and relax his stance. And then, Castiel would kiss him slowly in apology, for waking Dean.
“This is the only place where I've ever felt I could really be myself. Dad and Sam and I spent all our years together living in motels, and when we couldn’t afford that, in Baby.”
They made their way to Dean’s room, quietly. Tiptoeing as if they were teenagers. Sam was a deep sleeper and wouldn’t wake, but they weren’t in the business of tempting gods. Once safely in Dean’s room, Dean started tugging off his shirt.
And with Sammy in the backseat it would be worse. He’d see all his expressions in the rear-view mirror. Occasionally, Mary would turn around, and direct her questions at Sam. And he’d stutter through an answer. Mary would turn back to gauge Dean’s reaction, and the disappointment that would cross her face when she’d find resignation on Dean’s face. It would break him; he knew it would.
“You have,” said Castiel.
Castiel sat beside him.
“I’m –”
Castiel put in the tape and sat back to listen to his favorite songs.
They returned to their room and Dean made Castiel forget the conversation he and Mary had been having. Though her words reverberated.
Sorry for the spacing, I'll edit it and update the chapter.
“Dean, it’s — “
“I drew sometimes, too, when I was his age, but dad wasn't paying attention.” He scoffed, “I wasn’t a demon to hunt, you know?”
“You’re here,” he said, incredulous.
The line between hunter and hunted blurred. He had Crowley’s number on speed dial, and he had killed that kid in cold blood. Now, he had a connection to the Darkness, and there was seemingly nothing he could do about it. And when he closed his eyes, he saw it all. All the blood. God, there was always so much blood.
Beside him, Dean stilled.
Castiel looked away. He was a soldier. He had seen it all before, and yet, this gave him pause. He had led battles; he had slaughtered his own kind. He had witnessed many demons suffer at the hands of angels, demons, and humans alike. And yet, this lowly demon choking back tears gnawed at something within him.
Dean woke up shortly after that. Sam would be back soon. They wouldn’t have much time before the nurses noticed he awoke.
“We’ll be back soon, Castiel,” said Mary.
Would she meet a hunter who had a different story to tell?
Adam, who was trapped with them. Adam, who hadn’t known the first thing about the supernatural. Adam, who had been living his life until he was dragged into this war by the angels.
If Sam noticed the change in Dean’s mood, he didn’t mention it.
It hadn’t mattered what he promised. And it was such a simple promise.
“Do I know you?”
He faced away from Crowley. This was a fruitless enterprise.
“I’m fine,” said Castiel, and he meant it.
“Cas had gripped me tight and raised me from Hell,” said Dean.
Though at times, Dean had found the angel unreadable, he wasn’t unknowable. Over time, Dean had learned his tells. His eyes would crinkle when he found something humorous. As he had that afternoon when they were sitting on the benches in the park.
Dean had forbidden them from speaking of Lisa and Ben, but that didn’t mean Castiel stopped thinking about the year Dean had lived with them. He couldn’t bear to think about her name on the tip of his tongue, her hands on his waist, and her lips on his. Whenever he did, he felt a darkness claw its way up from the well in which it was hidden.
When Dean woke up next, Castiel was right beside him.
“Dean?”
“Great, just fucking great. Your boyfriend thinks you’re still trapped in Purgatory, and here you are, plotting to possess the poor, comatose son of a bitch!”
“I will,” said Castiel.
They’d talk about it late at night, when Sam was asleep, or in the garage while Dean was giving Baby a turtle wax.
He needed, he needed to think of something else. Anything else, or he’d lose what little nerve he had left.
He had ceased to exist.
“Mom, I don’t — I don’t know that you should be doing this,” he said.
Meeting Mary Campbell was a glimpse into the woman she had been, but the woman she was now? She scared him. They were so alike, and yet she was so unnerved by who they were and what they’d become. She spent that first night reading dad’s journal. Sam thought it would be the easiest way to get her up to speed, and he agreed, but it left him feeling hollow.
“Why? Why now?”
Again.
Lucifer hadn’t held back — not that Dean had thought he would, he was the Devil, after all. Dean had sparred with his brother more times than he could count, and they’d had some nasty fights, but they always held back. And maybe they should’ve used their words instead of pummeling each other into the drywall, but they were young and reckless.
While in the kitchen, Dean had made the mistake of mentioning the wendigo killings. When he said the word, everyone around him took a swig of their drink. He sighed. He hated being caught off guard, and though he knew it was all fun and games, he made a note to tell Sam.
“He was suicidal, almost beat me to death, but snapped out of it in time.”
She didn’t need to know Castiel had tried to give it back to him, when he thought they were through. Dean wouldn’t take it back; he never would.
“Okay,” said Dean, when he and Cas were seated in the library as they had been in the dream.
Castiel was quiet for a moment. The truth was…complicated.
He sighed, put down the knife he had been using, and wiped the blood from his hands using a dirty rag.
Dean pulled their bodies close and nuzzled into his neck.
Castiel tensed, if only briefly.
“Yes,” said Castiel, but didn’t extrapolate.
“Cas,” said Dean, his voice raspy.
A series of emotions flashed across her face, but she didn’t give voice to any of them. Instead, she stood up and grabbed her backpack, letting it hang off one shoulder.
But John had other sons, he needn’t settle.
Mary and Sam left soon after that.
“You’re awake.”
He was barely holding it together. Crowley took pity on him and sat next to him.
“Not sure how Claire’s going to take it,” said Jody. “She might be happy.”
Dean spoke to him about his childhood. The dreams on which he had given up: rock star, wrestler, mechanic. The things Dean had to do to make ends meet when John wouldn’t leave them with enough money, and Dean and Sam had run out of things to eat.
“I have held his soul in the palm of my hand and marked it as my own. I was tortured and forced to kill hundreds of copies of Dean, and the spell only broke when —”
“How bad?”
He’d say what was on his mind, what he had been thinking.
He smiled at the fond memory.
She pulled him into a hug and ran her fingers through her hair.
Maybe Castiel was right, maybe the Mark had changed him. He would never be who he had been before its influence took hold. Those days were behind him, sure, but the thoughts still haunted him. They joined his other, recurring nightmares. It was getting harder to tell them apart. The decades he spent in hell, the decade he spent tormenting souls. He had warned Castiel that torturing Alastair would unleash something in him, something that would be harder to contain.
“Yeah?”
But it wasn’t that he couldn’t understand, it was that she didn’t. She didn’t understand them. She couldn’t understand why they were still hunting when they’d avenged her death a decade ago. She didn’t understand why they had avenged her death in the first place. And Dean didn’t know how to answer. It was all he had ever known. Couldn’t she understand that?
Dean sighed. He really should’ve seen this coming. They had been driving in silence for some time, but it wasn’t companionable.
And sometimes, he would read it aloud.
Sam had lived his whole life on the road and when he had thought he found a home — in Stanford, with Jessica — it burned down before his very eyes.
Now, they were both trapped in the Cage.
“Can we talk outside? They already think we’re celebrities.”
“Oh?”
He turned to face him.
Castiel couldn’t meet his eyes. Mary had asked him to keep their partnership a secret from her sons. She had said she didn’t want them to think she was unwilling to hunt with them, though that was the truth. She was hoping to spare them.
“I was so damn happy to see him, but he wasn’t. Cas had been keeping his distance to keep me safe. And he stayed behind to make sure I got out,” said Dean.
“I — I get it. I do, I went to hell and back and Sam was running around with a demon. My stint in hell saved his life and I had no fucking clue what was going on. I had no idea what had happened to him in the time I was gone,” said Dean.
Castiel took said cigarette.
Castiel looked at him apprehensively.
“That’s — that’s good. How’s he feeling…about the possession?”
Over time, Sam and Dean stopped relying on it.
Why did it have to be them?
“You love Boston crème,” said Sam.
Castiel nodded. This satisfied Dean, who then grabbed his clothes and made his way to the bathroom. Castiel watched him disappear and started reading.
If he’d been avoiding being alone with her, he sure as hell wasn’t going to join her on a road trip. They’d be stuck in the car for hours. He’d have no choice but to answer her questions lest they drive in awkward silence. And that, that would be torture. Hadn’t he been tortured enough?
“Well?”
Sam had offered Castiel the passenger’s seat, and he had accepted. It wasn’t fair to Sam. Dean’s mercurial moods were one thing, but this was something else.
“As if I had your cock in my mouth and let you come on my tongue,” finished Castiel.
She looked at him then, careful, and considerate. Finally, she started to walk back up the stairs to the seat she had been in only minutes ago.
“Is he happy?”
Castiel followed her into the library.
Mary looked between Castiel and Dean, and then said, “Are you two in a relationship?”
Dean’s more interested in cutting off Cas than in anything Sam has to say. “Look, can you just...we don’t need you on this one. So, just, I’ll make you a cup of tea. Hang out. Watch your fang journals show - you gotta have
“You’re missing the point.” Cas says.
“We gonna kill something? Get the keys; I gotta kill something.”
voice. He sounds like he’s grinding his teeth.
“Sam? Sorry to bother you, but—”
“I didn’t notice,” Sam drawls.
There’s a clatter of chair-and-table, and Dean cuts off with a shuffle of feet. From the corner of Sam’s eye, he surmises that - despite his arguments - Cas had stumbled and failed to stay upright. Dean seems to have gotten him into a chair. Sam is staying the fuck out of it.
Sam speaks a little louder. “Each-uisge. It’s a lot like a kelpie—”
Dean blinks once, twice. His eyes do something shifty and he sounds both blasé and skeptical when he says, “...sure. What gives, Sammy, I miss a share-and-care memo or something?”
They stand in the quiet of his absence. It’s very awkward.
He’s still alive - probably, it’s hard to tell with angels, sometimes, but there’s no shadowy image of wings on the ground, so. Still alive. With everyone exhausted and covered in monster-lake-goop, it takes both Sam and Dean (and Miracle, though he's more moral support) to get Cas into the bathroom and then the bed. Sam ends up hovering in the doorway with the dog while Dean goes through the business of fussing with the blankets.
Cas sounds unimpressed, but answers anyway. “Yes. It is somewhat nonsensical, but the underlying themes of—”

is a bit more useful. All the advice is along the lines of “
“You already need therapy,” Cas’ voice is matter-of-fact, but also fading, along with two sets of footsteps. “Both of you do, we’ve discussed this. However, due to the exceptional and incredible circumstances of your lives - incredible in that they tend to strain credulity, I mean - it is unlikely we could find a qualified—”
“That’s not what—” Sam starts.
“Sure. Great. Perfect. When do we leave?”

it. So he googles some more.
” and “

Sam worries about Cas, of course, but not too much. Cas’ll be okay. He didn’t get entirely resurrected and save their asses from, as Dean would put it, a
A moment of silence, and then Dean laughs. “You’re weepy over a teen vampire show? That’s what’s happening here?” He looks gleeful. He bumps his shoulders with Cas’, and even though it sends the angel teetering to lean heavily on the doorframe, things still feel almost normal.
“I need you safe, okay?” Dean says, meeting exactly no one’s eyes. “I just— We just got you back.”
“Huh.” Dean says. The label is almost entirely off his bottle, sitting in a little pile of scraps on the table next to it. He stares down at the corner he’s scraping off with idle vigor, “You know. Maybe we should...put someone else on this one.” Sam waits in silence until Dean glances up-and-back-down, adds, “Not sure we should be...leaving right now. What with, uh—”
Except they never have, Sam realizes. Not that they had deep talks about girls, exactly, but...it comes up. Who’s hot and who’s not and, when car rides get particularly tedious, how many names of one-night-stand they can remember. There’d been a truly obnoxious phase a few years back where anytime he wanted Sam to stop talking, Dean would shout over him with meticulously detailed stories of his own sexual escapades until Sam fled in disgust, because there are some things you

“What the
Cas chimes in, straightening on the table but not bothering to adjust...anything.
They spill into the room mid-argument. Sam would be happy to see them talking - not to mention Cas more animated than he’s been in weeks - but any positivity the moment might have is thoroughly quashed by all the storming and stomping and glaring going down. Sam ducks down and focuses intently on his laptop, trying to filter their voices out.
Sam trudges down the stairs after them, slightly less encumbered. “I’m sure I said—”
(Dean checks on Cas, too, whenever he thinks Sam isn’t looking. Sam’s about to call him out on it when he catches a flash of fake fangs from the laptop screen.
Dean’s back is shielding most of the thing from view, and thank
By the time the entry table comes into view, he’s already put the gun away and stopped even trying to be quiet. Because the panting has given way to moaning, and also some particularly gross wet noises, and he’s pretty solidly certain what he’s going to see.
“Hey, we
“Sam! You’re back! Uh...Cas is. Cas is awake.”
Sam’s sure, he is. Right up until the moment he re-enters the bunker.
Cas tilts his head in admission. “Ah, yes. A fictional death, on the television show Claire suggested I watch.”
Sam worries all night. He worries while he stumbles into the shower and when he stumbles out, he worries while he scrapes the guts and seaweed off the entry floor and burns them in a big, stinking heap down in the basement. He worries all the next morning, too, when he’s brushing his teeth and taking Miracle out for a walk and checking on Cas and dragging himself into the kitchen to get first a cup of tea and then - when it remains untouched - a beer for Dean, who is doing that thing where he doesn’t want to be alone but he also doesn’t want to
“Dean?” Cas murmurs, maybe even in his sleep. Sam watches as Dean leans in close, places his hand on the pillow next to Cas’ face.
“The point is, Sammy and I have got it. There’s no need to jump into danger when you’re not one hundred percent.”
Sam groans into his arms, loud enough for Dean to hear.
about your brother and Dean knows how to use them like a goddamn machete when he wants to end a conversation. But boys...boys don’t come up.
“I heard you. Sam, what the hell are you talking about?”
“Yes, that one.”
“What the fuck! Oh
. And you
“I know I said it once, and I wanted to make sure you knew. I know sometimes really small things can stick with you - I mean, not necessarily
The first thing he hears is panting.
Dean is avoiding Cas, is the thing. Dean has a lot of flavors of avoidant - angry, embarrassed, annoyed - and this isn’t really hitting any of them, and Sam doesn’t like it. It’s awkward, and also unhealthy, and Sam’s about ninety percent sure something
” and “
“I know, I know. I just want to make sure it wasn’t...something you think about. Just in case it’s, uh, a thing you—”
It earns him more of Dean’s voice, facetious: “If you need to talk about it…”
just telling me about how har—”
Mostly, Sam worries about Dean. He worries so hard he barely puts up a fight when Dean bullies him into picking up burgers for lunch, which is good because Dean barely puts any energy into the bullying.
Sam spins the laptop back towards himself - and indeed, the page on
Dean’s attempt to stomp indignantly down the bunker’s stairway is hampered by a number of things: the waterlogged mess of his clothing. The mass of seaweed-and-guts trailing his left shoe. Miracle, usually surprisingly relaxed about this sort of thing, trying very hard greet them cheerfully. Castiel, a barely-conscious dead weight, slumped against his side.
Cas blinks back. “I noticed, on your door. I wondered if that meant you—”
It’s the resignation there that cements Sam’s concern. Plus, he can mentally fill in Cas’ big blue longing eyes even with the man’s back turned, so apparently

“Dean? Are you...are you watching
“No!” Dean shouts. He also slams the laptop closed, so like, it’s pretty weak.)
“You did say you wanted to kill something.”
“Uh-huh,” Dean hums, delighted.
Sam mumbles it back, because he can’t really argue with that. Dean, apparently, can.
Castiel hums in acknowledgement. “Yes, well,” he says, voice heavy with sarcasm, “I suppose that makes it all better.”
here!), and says, firmly, “I support you.”
Dean drops into the chair; slides a beer across the table and immediately starts a jittered leg-bounce-and-finger-drum routine that Sam already knows is going to drive him nuts. A quick glance at the entry - from Sam, not Dean, Dean’s not looking anywhere but the label on his bottle, which he’s already started peeling - shows Cas, half-turned to stare blankly in their direction before his shoulders slump and he moves on down the hall.
“I will be here for as long as you will have me,” said Castiel with all the sincerity he could muster.
“Cas, you’re alive,” he said, breathless.
Castiel loved their book club. He loved having something of Dean’s — his books and his thoughts while he read.
“I have time,” she said.
“I’m sorry for lying. For lying to you when we were in Purgatory. I should’ve told you I didn’t intend on leaving with you. It wasn’t because I didn’t want to be with you. It was because I needed to stay. I’m sure you understand why I needed to stay. I’m sure you understand why I felt I needed to be there, why I felt I needed to atone. Please tell me you understand,” he said.
“Of course.”
“How long have you known?”
He turned and took his seat beside the hospital bed.
After all, angels were energy and intention.
Fuck thought Dean. This never gets any easier. Putting yourself on the line, trusting someone to be who they said they were, and learning the hard way that everyone succumbs to pressure, or temptation, or hell, fucking demons — it never stops hurting.
Once again, Castiel looked away.
Just another reflex, like keeping a .45 under his pillow and reaching for it when someone woke him up.
Dean continued, unabated, “He left, was tricked, and lost his grace in the process. As a result, the angels fell and lost their wings. I know he misses — missed — them. He misses flying.”
“I remember, all of it,” said Dean, alluding to the passionate kiss they had shared.
Then, he sat on the edge of the bed, next to Castiel.
“You’re serious?”
He wasn’t sure it was what he needed, but it had been there listening when he had shut out all the rest, and that would suffice. He beckoned it closer. Listening to the soft thrum grow louder.
“I was not born a human, but I have lived as one for many years. I’ve come to understand this society expects a lot of its women, but you’ll learn that there’s more freedom to be who you are than there had been decades ago,” he said.
This time though…
Beside him, Dean was still asleep. His face was flushed, and his skin was warm to the touch, but there was no fever. Castiel returned to his seat, but he couldn’t read anymore. And it was getting light, the brothers would be up soon.
He would’ve just been in His Father’s image, as all things God created.
“I’m — Yeah, I’m awake.”
What did it even mean? What did it mean to an angel? Beyond that though, what did he have to lose? He didn’t want to be alone, that much he knew.
