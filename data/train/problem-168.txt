Sherlock had googled the number and called the office after ringing off with Mycroft. Now, he draws a deep breath and says, "The whole truth."
What he's really asking is how badly Sherlock's been hurt. "He's just under observation. He'll be alright."
The last thing he wants is sympathy so he shrugs it off. “It’s nothing. Bumped my nose on the stall door, that’s all.”
The music isn’t fast but the swirling turns, the footwork as Sherlock moves with Irina — it looks amazing, as if they are one being. At the corner of the room, Irina leans back, Sherlock's arms giving her all the balance she needs to extend her right leg high with a pointed toe, shaping an elegant pose at just the right point in the music. Sherlock moves around her elegantly and then they are off again, a pattern of turns, rising and falling in perfect time to the music.
Moriarty is either oblivious to Moran’s discomfort or just doesn’t give a damn. "And how delightfully old fashioned you are!" The Irishman points at the bag slung over Sherlock's shoulder. "Bladed weapons? No, no, no…
Lestrade and Donovan are sitting on the couch, each with a cup of tea. There is a plate of biscuits between them on the coffee table — Mrs. Hudson having put it together for them before she ‘left them to their discussion’. Sherlock has turned one of the desk chairs around and is sitting on it backwards, arms folded on the backrest, chin resting on top.
The anger seems to evaporate from Violet, tension drain out of her shoulder. "Of course, we must try."
He glances across the table at Rosie’s artwork. She’s covering it with her arm but he can see a glimpse of stick legs and bright red rectangular feet.
"I just hope tomorrow will provide something worth remembering." He takes the last sip of his beer and raises a hand to the waitress to get the bill.
"Try not to lose this one, please, Doctor Watson; they are not easy to replace" Mycroft had said when he handed over the weapon in the car.
Mycroft’s brows knit themselves together before quickly straightening out again, clearly not wishing to linger on the concept any longer than necessary. John, on the other hand, appears stunned at the idea of Jim Moriarty and Sebastian Moran being anything more to one another than psychopath and his henchman. Sherlock eases himself back on the sofa, allowing the backrest to take his weight. For the briefest of moments, he tries to ignore the pull of the granulating wounds on his chest and the way his ribs scream in protest.
Sebastian is still congratulating himself on a job exceptionally well done when he turns the ignition off and climbs out of the Porsche. The shared residents' underground garage in Soho is silent save for the quiet hum of the ventilation system and the peacefully dim lighting. He reaches behind the driver's seat to retrieve the gym bag and feels a slight movement of air at his right shoulder. He wheels around to his left, coming up behind his potential assailant and slamming
I know I must sound like a nag; I don't want to, but safety matters. "You sure about this guide tomorrow?"
It had been so strange to be sitting there, at the woman's office talking about her William, and Violet wonders whether any of it has really been helpful to her son. It had been eye-opening for her, that's for sure, because this therapist's approach is clearly very different from all those years ago. Violet wasn't just told things at that appointment — she was being asked for her opinion. No therapist ever assumed she had any answers, and they rarely considered or inquired how she felt about things regarding Sherlock. She never felt very
"What would you prefer me to do, John?” He eases the violin down from his neck. “You seem to have very fixed views on what I should and shouldn't do."
Twenty minutes later, John has to admit that she's right. He's looked in every room, explored every nook and cranny, been into the basement and the attic. Nothing. His heart sinks. If Sherlock is being held elsewhere on the estate, he's got a long search ahead. The satellite photos that Mycroft had provided showed numerous outbuildings: stables, kennels, the glasshouse, the boathouse, and then there is the farm to the east.
John pauses, just as Mycroft’s fingers come in contact with his phone, arm outstretched. "I'm not asking for the official
He’s been here once before, just for a look around, using his phone to film his explorations. Jim had been delighted at the opportunity to be a voyeur. That’s the time he'd come across Watson’s misappropriated service weapon in the bedside table upstairs. That’s going to be the trickier bit, so he saves that task until the end.  Halfway up the stairs, Sebastian stops and sweeps again. This time, his app registers two cameras. Smirking, he activates the MI6 codes to connect to those cameras and sets them to re-run current footage for the next fifteen minutes. There are perks to being a former agent specialising in surveillance.
John’s not quite sure how long he had been sitting there, but when he looks down at the paper in his hand and Mike’s scrawl on it, it seems to shake him out of his fugue. He takes out his phone and sends a message to the number Mike has written:
Despite the official American policy of not paying ransoms to terrorists, Mycroft has been able to convince the powers that be on the other side of the Atlantic that the combined intelligence of the British National Crime Agency's cyber-finance team and GCHQ will be able to tag the bitcoin payment to lead them to the criminal behind the hack. Yet, knowing what he knows about the Moriarty—which is a great deal more than he has been willing to tell anyone else—Mycroft knows this is the act of a desperate man.
“Hear me out. If blood found on the floor contained another person’s DNA, every test would have reported it, even the least precise ones. But if Sherlock had been getting transfusions of red blood cell platelets, there'd be no DNA, both you and I
John unlocks the front door and Sherlock follows him through it into the foyer, taking advantage of a chair by a telephone table to collapse into it. As John busies himself with kicking off his boots and hanging his coat on a hook by the door, Sherlock takes a moment to look around. There’s something about the décor, a level of domesticity that Sherlock wouldn’t have expected to find in an M16 safe house. Prints on the wall, not just haphazard purchases from a flea market but thoughtfully selected. And on a shelf in the room down the hall, door stuck ajar, homemade preserves and jams. It feels … comfortable, Sherlock thinks, as his eyes begin to close again.
"The things which our conversation brought to mind today, those past events which still made you rather emotional… I'd like you to put them in writing. Nothing extensive — perhaps an email? Write a draft summarising those events, and then decide if you are ready to send it to me. If not, then let it wait but don't delete it. You can rephrase as many times as you like until you're happy with what framework you want me to have for your reaction today. Will you do that?"
Macdonald is a grey-haired man in an ill-fitting hired dinner jacket that can't conceal his paunch. He spends ten minutes waxing dramatic about the future of hydrocephaly research as if he is the world authority on the subject. Sherlock knows his work, based on research done a decade ago. He'd subjected the man's original proposal to forensic scrutiny; it had helped him know for sure what
The effect of our both saying this while exploring each other's lips is somewhat diluted by my snicker and Sherlock's chuckle.
The Snow Hill Police Station had been the closest to Barts, and that was where Sergeant Hanson had dumped him after he’d been arrested*. His memory of the arrest for assault on the Chief Superintendent of Detectives is fragmented; it feels as if it was a lifetime ago. It is as if the world has been moving at a faster speed than his brain can comprehend.  He remembers Lestrade speaking to him in the reception area of the hospital, but he can’t remember what he said, or why he had disappeared. He remembers the nurse trying to explain why he had to go to another hospital, when John would not, could not, leave voluntarily. After reciting to him his rights, Hanson had cuffed him and man-handled him into the back of the car. He’d not resisted. What was the point?
"It was on the third of November, early hours, between midnight and three o'clock. He was cut up by flying glass, significant blood loss. I never did get his name. The ambulance was a write off, but the crew were unharmed, so they took him into Guy's. The St Thomas's A&E can't track him down without a name, and for all they know, your people patched him up without needing to cart him halfway across London to an A&E again. He could have gone straight onto the ward where he was being transferred. Can you check your records? Any white male patient, aged mid-thirties. Tall, with dark longish curly hair. Text me with any likely names."
John knows that's as much of an apology as he's going to get. John also knows he gives as good as he gets. "That's a weapon we seem to share."
"Can't possibly," Sherlock says. "I need to look at architectural prints for the office space but the damned file is not opening and the Ormond Street IT isn't replying to my messages, and even Edgar's flatmate is unavailable."
Nothing more is said for the rest of the journey, not even when he's parked the car in the underground garage, they've gone up the stairs and Jim's got his keys out to open the flat door. As usual, he walks in first. It's something that has always annoyed Sebastian; Jim's insistence on being first through the door, when every bit of his army and bodyguard training says it's Sebastian who needs to enter the place first and ensure it is clear of enemies wanting to hurt them.
He swears he can smell the aroma of cooking turkey as he leaves Regent Park's Outer Circle, crosses the footbridge over the canal and comes to Prince Albert Road. There is so little traffic that he doesn't need to wait for the pedestrian light to turn green.
John retrieves the now very dead, dried off security camera from his pocket, and drops it carefully in the middle of the newspaper. "And tell me this isn't you."
"This whole situation is ridiculous. A pantomime." Sherlock looks up from his laptop to skewer Mycroft with a barrage of accusations. "What did you
Moriarty had walked into the room wearing Sherlock's belstaff, something that made John want to leap up from his seat and rip it off the Irishman's shoulders. Such a blatant act of provocation is clearly being aimed at him.
What he had been able to find publicly through Google maps he's backed up by hacking into the Ministry of Defense's map system. The higher resolution satellite maps confirmed that the best approach would be from the east. From there it would just be a matter of heading into the upper Lough Erne lake, then under the bridge between the two farms and into Drummond Lough.
Does John feel a twinge of jealousy about that? Maybe a little. He has noted how much Sherlock refers to things that Edgar has done or helped with, so the idea that there is more that he isn't aware of makes him a bit curious.
Blood starts to trickle from his mouth but as soon as Moran steps away, Sherlock resumes baiting the Colonel. "How often did you belittle Jim? Make sure he always knew you were the smarter one?"
The cracks. He knows they are starting to show. One of the rare times John had actually looked at him in the last couple of days, he had caught Sherlock absentmindedly scratching at the crook of his elbow. John’s eyes had narrowed but he hadn't said anything.
The agent walks off to the side, facing away from John and places the call. He’s far enough away that John can’t hear what is said but the way in which the call is ended and the look the man gives him when he turns back around tells him all he needs to know. It’s probably slightly detrimental to the pace at which he desires things to proceed, but John can’t help the smirk that tugs at his lips. The agent’s lips purse in response but soon enough he is leading the way back to the car John arrived in.
After the second such exchange, John seemed to figure out something was up. The slides under Sherlock’s microscope lens suddenly became extremely fascinating as he felt John’s gaze land on the back of his neck.
Sherlock Holmes was alive. Sherlock Holmes was alive and John felt more alive than he’d felt in his whole life. John wiped at his cheeks as he sucked in his breath.
“What’s that you’re working on? Were you given that assignment at the end of the day today when Nana was with you?”
Moran gives him one last appraising look before turning on his heel and heading for the door. He deposits the syringe and a bottle of water on the floor before stepping through the doorway and closing the door behind him. Sherlock hears the click of a padlock, and he is alone again.
There's a bottle in one of the cabinets, beneath the glass—Elixir Heroin Hyd. Conc. The yellowing label reads:
Mycroft’s continued conversations into the early hours of the morning with the Americans had revealed little in the way of additional information. They had confirmed that the plane’s navigation system had indeed been hacked via the onboard wifi network by an android-enabled device. The owner of said device, who had been hauled unceremoniously off the plane and onto the tarmac in Maniitsoq by two airport policemen, turned out to be an eighty-two-year-old widow from Wokingham, whose only crime was using her ancient relic of a HTC smartphone to claim her 'prize'.
“Once you’ve ruled out the impossible, whatever remains — however improbable — must be true,” he whispers to the evidence that flutters in the slight breeze of his breath.
Maybe, just maybe that is the answer. By faking his own death, Sherlock is buying more time to fight Moriarty. So, if Sherlock is still alive, where is he and what is he doing? And what is he trying to stop Moriarty from doing?
“I miss you, you bloody bastard,” he said, lightly tapping his fingertips on the headstone before he turned to make his way back through the cemetery to the street.
) suturing skills of anonymous A&E technicians. Or will there be someone else at Baker Street to do it for him?
One of Mycroft's minions had dropped off a duffle bag to Baker Street just before dawn. Water-based undertakings in the dead of the Irish winter necessitate some high-quality thermal gear, the sort of equipment that special ops teams use on a regular basis, so not that hard for someone with his brother's contacts to source, as Sherlock had informed Mycroft. What he had not told his brother is that he would be using this to approach Moran's rendezvous site on the River Erne. In fact, he's said nothing at all about those coordinates that had been in the glove. Why should he? He'd not told Mycroft anything about how he'd enticed Jim to Hampstead Heath either. There are some things that Sherlock does not feel his brother is entitled to know.
"Please, Doctor Watson; have a seat." Philippe opens the door again, coaxes me to climb in. He then goes to the trunk, which I assume is to deposit the plastic bag there, but when he comes back, he's holding a plastic mug and a bottle.
One thing that is definitely his, is now taken out of the cupboard. Sherlock doesn't like whisky much and really dislikes the peaty aroma of Ardbeg, a single malt given to him by Mycroft as something of a peace offering after Morocco. This variety is called
John wonders why Sherlock can't reason it himself what help he might need with a bad leg. He seems… scattered, in the way that he gets when there's a problem he has been trying to solve but can't. It consumes him, and he can't get any rest.
The Glenmorangie Signet scotch whisky slides down Mycroft's throat. Once he's taken a moment to savour it, he replies to Sherlock with a snort. "Now you're going to tell me he's doing it for money."
––" I give Charbonnet a glare for good measure, and our colleague pinches his lips together in annoyance,
There a faint hum and then the sounds come clearly, piped through the room's audio-visual system speakers.
She hadn’t been invited to the Watson wedding, of course. She’d made her apologies by then, had long since seen the error of her ways and begun a course correction. But, for all that Sherlock had put in a good word for her with the promotions board, they were colleagues at best.
Halfway up to the dam, I can hear over the snowcat's motor a thump of a helicopter's rotors. Once heard in Afghanistan, never forgotten. A rescue helicopter comes up behind us and heads straight overhead, clearing the dam and then disappearing from view.
The grass underfoot is slippery. It's not raining at the moment, but it's been drizzling on the Heath for days, turning whatever bare soil that once formed the path into a sticky brown morass. He’s glad he’s wearing his Timberlands—sturdy, practical boots, with a tread deep enough to ensure purchase in the slick mud.
No, no, no, not when he’s finally found someone! He can’t lose her! He starts hurrying after her. Glancing back over her shoulder, she sees him and starts walking faster, heading west along the Embankment, trying to lose him in the crowds walking along the river in front of the South Bank's skate park.  He starts to jog after her, which panics her into shouting “Police! Police!” She yells, as she keeps turning her head back over her shoulder to keep an eye on him. Pedestrians scatter out of her way.
Despite his best efforts, no solace is to be found at the bottom of his first glass of beer, so he orders another. He avoids ordering a whisky because the last thing he wants to do is confirm Sherlock's worst expectations of him. He's still too angry to want to get drunk. And he needs to figure out a place to stay, because there is no way in hell he is going back to Sherlock and the flat tonight.

"Annoyed. He told me that the murder cases he was working on were proving more difficult to solve than he had anticipated. His attempt to engage Jim Moriarty, to record their conversation, had not produced the evidence he needed to convince a judge to issue a warrant."
As Moran comes slowly over to him, Sherlock leans over so he can keep his eyes on the Colonel. "You're still hiding behind him now, making people think that you're Jim. Did he catch on? Did he resent being used? Is that why you set him up? Or was Jim expen…"
Arnaud is next; the Frenchman is slower, more methodical, but his technique is similar. They are joined by the athletic, agile Gabriel about 100 meters down and to the left, off the main line of fall.
his clumsiness has reduced Sherlock's prized possession to a series of bone fragments scattered across the living room carpet.
Grimacing at the movement that threatens to turn his stomach over on itself, John reaches beneath his chair to retrieve his laptop. Waiting for it to power up, he considers his writing. It was vitally important to him to keep the memory of Sherlock alive when he was “dead,” but he wonders what role it has now? He looks over the top of the laptop screen at the man who is now sitting, sulking at the kitchen table examining a bejewelled deerstalker in disgust as Mrs Hudson potters around him.
Always to the point, Mary's just that little bit too brusque in her manner to make Janine warm to her. Tonight, however, it suits her purpose to let her emotions show. She shakes her head. "Not here, in private. There's something I need to show you and then to ask."
As if on cue, Sherlock's phone pings with a text from Lestrade, requesting a meeting at his office in the afternoon. "Looks like I will need to have my arguments planned by three o'clock today.  He wants to see me, so I must use this as a chance to inform him of the positive aspects of the deal."
After you put your groceries away, you pour yourself a glass of whisky and open the notebook to a new page.
She jogs to Timmy, grabs his hand and drags him off the grass. Predictably, Timmy starts to cry. As she passes Sherlock, he can hear her talking on the phone again. "Bloody hell. I cannot wait for the au pair service to get me a replacement for Danuta. I need someone to keep Timmy occupied and sorted; he starts nursery school in a couple of weeks, and I am desperate for some help in the house.  Not fair to ask Tom to do it all; he's such a brick, but he's got a life, too. The baby is just too demanding for me to be able to manage him, the kid and a husband. Look, I'll call back. Need both hands. Bye for now."
It's what he loves about London—the whole world is here in the space of ten square miles. From the high crimes and misdemeanours of Belgravian expatriates to the petty thievery and drug dealing of Streatham, London is a cesspit of crime. No one bothers trying to shift the graffiti down here, given that it will only be replaced the next night. As his cab passes one particularly vivid set of six-foot high tags, Sherlock knows that he has just crossed the boundary between Moscow17 and 37/OJB.
"DI Lestrade, do you have any reason to believe that Mister Holmes might have been depressed by his failure to solve these cases, or to prevent this last death?"
Written in reverse so that the camera displays them correctly, bright yellow words take shape from the letters written on the glass.
He gets a hum in reply and takes in the sight of his partner. Sherlock is wearing an old pair of pyjama bottoms, their fabric thinned, and the dove-grey colour faded by repeated washes. They are hung low on his hips, and his white T-shirt has hiked up to reveal a sliver of concave stomach. John hopes he's not lost weight because of the rush to finish the GOSH project. The man's appetite can disappear as easily as his ability to sleep when he's stressed or very driven. John can make out the faint, mingling smells of Sherlock's salon shampoo, lemon lozenges, fever sweat, aftershave and the very essence of the man. His curls look a mix of frizzed and flattened, and John rearranges his fringe with his fingertips to prevent it from tickling his closed lids before pressing a kiss to the crown of his head. He wraps his arms around him and gives a squeeze.
Sherlock snatches the packet from Edgar and digs out what he needs. At his PA's rising brows, he responds, "Trust me: this evening will certainly be a three-patch problem."
This, their way, the life they had built together was certainly their relationship, but also their cases, and without Sherlock there were no “their cases”. His eyes fell on a notepad hidden under an old newspaper. One of Sherlock’s, filled with his almost indecipherable scribbles. Phrases. Questions. One word written in uppercase standing out from the rest.
John doesn't ask why he's left early. He can probably guess that something's happened — or perhaps he just assumes that Sherlock had made a hasty escape as soon as he had dared because he hates big social events.
John points into the living room. "I'd rather have your undivided attention, please. I don't like competing with whatever the hell you are growing in that Petri dish."
“Oh. No. I was... um...” Sherlock coughed delicately. “I was just trying to avoid my brother. There will of course be a cover up, paperwork, the whole works...and I…” He stopped in front of John. His face was indecipherable.
As Mycroft settles into his chair, Sherlock swirls his drink and sketches a rudimentary toast, “I stabbed my arm to drink her health.”
A flicker passes over Moran’s face, there and gone, but it’s enough to tell Sherlock that being ordered around like some common prison guard is not something that sits well with him.
They're halfway to the centre of the glade, walking with no more than a yard between them when Sherlock starts his final counter-attack. He says quietly, in a voice that won't carry to their seconds over the wind, “That’s the curse of the second son; always having to prove you are smarter. As long as you live, your people will learn you're a fraud."
"I'm not celebrating. Being here is an obligation, not recreation. I would not voluntarily attend such a function. John would. Not me."
: Victor from being targeted by Moriarty, John from being confronted with the uncomfortable truth that Sherlock was attracted to men, and most of all, to protect himself, from having to admit that he while he had loved Victor once, he now loved a man who would never love him back.
Two days a week at GOSH would not involve Sherlock in routine OR work; he would not be on call there, and there would be no patient follow-up clinic work. Of course, his opinion might be asked occasionally on the details of surgical procedures, but all in all, it would more of a nine-to-five job than King's College has ever been. It would be more predictable in character, and it would free time up to focus on the design research. Maybe he could be as radical as Dahl himself had been back in the fifties and recruit a hydraulics engineer involved in the design. If they are going to solve this need for real-time smart shunt operation, then some pretty off-the-wall thinking is going to be needed. Someone gifted in software development and chip design might also be very useful. Sherlock starts wondering how he would be able to find someone like that.
“Tonight mine will seem relevant to drugs or attempted murder,” Sherlock had predicted. They’d both giggled when it turned out to be “Beware of unexpected journeys.” As a matter of fact, they’d cracked up in a way that had made the waiter eye them suspiciously. But, a Chinese restaurant open until 2 a.m. needs to be willing to cope with oddball customers. Perhaps that is why Sherlock was a regular.
What would be good about that? It might save John from being targeted again by whoever put him in the bonfire. It would therefore be good for John, but not for Sherlock. He's not ready, not yet. Going cold turkey on John Watson is too much to ask of himself right now. He'd rather stop the drugs.
They both chuckled before inhaling the comforting scent of the steamy tea, each then lifting their cups to their lips.
Sherlock shoulders his way through the throng to find a patch of open ground. There is something about the tall, slim and very determined figure in black that makes people move out of his way, allowing me to follow in his wake. As Mycroft catches up, we are lost in a frenzy of snapping boots into bindings. Next up is slipping wrist straps of the poles on, adjusting goggles and grinding my teeth as the biting cold wind whips at us. Yet within moments, I am laughing; after all the palaver, it won't be long before starting, finally, to ski.
John doesn't know if any of his own are good at all. He's trying. He's struggling, and he's trying, and he couldn't do any of this without Sherlock. Not selling his and Mary's flat — Sherlock had talked to the estate agentwith him. Not looking after Rosie 24/7— Sherlock somehow knows when it's all just too much and takes her somewhere so that John can have a kip and some quiet time. Not moving back in — Sherlock had organised it all and led the team of professional movers like the conductor of a symphony orchestra, at no cost; the movers owed him a favour for solving a case of a missing lorry full of antiques. He remembered precisely where all of John's belongings had once resided in 221b and devised sensible places where to put Rosie's things.
Then for a split second, he panics, realising that John might do just that and that he might not be ready for what’s coming. But again, John deflects, using the sound of ping from Sherlock’s phone to avoid the real issue.
“Regardless,” he continues. “When the trap is sprung around me, you need to disappear, keep playing dead. Before I get stopped, I can organise witness protection for you—a bolt hole in Florida? I seem to recall you liked it there once.”
She consults the papers in front of her briefly before continuing, "Yesterday we heard evidence from Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade that the police and Mister Holmes were investigating a number of suspicious deaths that appeared to be suicides. He also advised that insufficient evidence to prove homicide had been recovered from the crime scene at the Old Operating Theatre and subsequent investigation of the circumstances of Mister Holmes' apparent death could not provide this proof either. Therefore, without evidence, homicide is not a viable conclusion for this Inquest. That leaves the choice between suicide and an open verdict."
Why had Holmes let him go? That, too, makes no sense. For someone who claims to be a genius, Holmes is making a lethal mistake. Sebastian will spend the rest of his life, no matter how short that might be, trying to avenge Jim's death.
in that? Are you even listening to me? This is my first chance to fuck with Mycroft Holmes' mind. You think I am going to pass that opportunity up?"
"Exactly forty minutes after it started, the systems woke up again," the breathless CNN reporter announces. "The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Security Agency are investigating as we speak. Nothing like this has ever happened in the history of aviation. The idea that the whole of the system—the automated network, the back-up systems, even the manual handling by radio communications—could be simultaneously hacked and shut down; well, experts are saying it couldn't be done. Mass cancellations of flights and forced landings everywhere across the country; thank God no plane has crashed this time."
Once he's done reading, he looks up to see far too many eyes on him. Almost directly in front of him is Moriarty. His guard dog, Moran, is sitting one row back and off to the side, so John has an unrestricted view of him as well. The contrast between the two is striking. Moriarty keeps tilting his head coquettishly, as if he is trying to flirt with him and Moran looks like he wants to rip John’s head off with his bare hands. Given a choice, he would much prefer the head-ripping; Moriarty’s brand of psychopathy makes him nauseous. Moran—he’s known others of the type, soldiers who never hesitated to obey the most morally questionable of orders. Bloodthirsty, brutal, but still managing to remain just this side of the unadulterated evil space that Moriarty dominates.
"No, he stays at King's. And I will continue to work there three days a week. This research engagement is part-time."
In a split second, John's rage boils over and he goes on the offensive. Briefly, in the first flurry he manages to land a few blows. Unfortunately, Moran then backs him up against the ceramic basin and gets in a one-two combination—the first to John's abdomen which knocks the breath out of him, the second collides with his nose in a crunch of cartilage.
Moriarty turns to look at Sebastian. "I had thought it might take three weeks, but my guess now is that early next week I can let you do what you want with your prisoner in there. And you can take Watson anytime you want; he's superfluous now."
His return to consciousness is less comfortable. Sherlock finds himself lying hog-tied on his side on a beaten earth floor, cuffed hands behind his back. There is daylight filtering through a tiny window over a metal door that can't be more than five meters in front of him. As his senses come back online, he realises that at some point in the past few hours, the drugs in his system had run their course, and he is now painfully aware that he is awake — and not alone.
“John, I’m John.” John returns the handshake and forces a smile. He's grateful that Garry steps hard on the accelerator and gets the van moving fast.
Placing another log on the fire, he settles into the nearest armchair to retrace the path of Agamemnon and Ajax as they try to deal with Achilles' pride and anger at having his prize stolen from him. It was a matter of honour; John had always thought Agamemnon to be the villain of the piece. If he'd only dealt fairly with Achilles, then the war could have ended earlier, with triumph over the Trojans. As it was, poor Patroclus ended up having to carry the can, donning Achilles' armour and leading the Greeks into battle, disguised as the warrior he loved and served. When Patroclus dies in battle as Achilles sulks in his tent, John sets the book down in his lap. Resting his head against the back of the armchair and closing his eyes, his mind is taken, swimming, drowning in guilt, by the fatal cost of Achilles' pride and the ghost of stricken Patroclus.
As John swings open the door, standing with his feet firmly planted, he sizes the man up. He doesn't look a day older than twenty-five. He's very lean and not very tall, standing with admirably good posture, though he's shifting on his feet. His straight, black hair is swept carefully up and away in a style intended to look effortless but neat. He is wearing a dark suit made from grey silk — single-breasted, one vent, sharp shoulder padding.
"Right, gentlemen. Thank you for your patience. Now, down to business. First of all, a safety talk. You see this big backpack I am wearing?" Branger hooks a thumb over his shoulder at what is at least twice the size of any of the avalanche packs we are wearing. "This has two thirty-meter ropes, two harnesses and crevasse rescue equipment. I really don't want to have to use any of these, so you will listen to what I have to say about keeping to lines. Last year an American skier — not on my trip — decided to go off in a different direction without discussing it with the guide. His group found his body at the bottom of a forty-meter cliff. He'd skied right off it. Sometimes, you see where a turn is only after you have gone right past it unless you've been told when to do it."
By Sherlock’s side, where he had always been right up until Sherlock’s “I’m dead” ruse. John tries to drum up the righteous indignation he has been clinging to at being the wronged party —
"I appreciate that this may be difficult to deal with an inquest into the possible death of a colleague, but your testimony as the investigating officer is crucial to the jury's decision today."
She'd returned yesterday early, to find out what Sherlock and Masha have been getting up to in the hour before her lesson.

explain to her that it brings up such painful memories that you want to cry. You shove down the pain and try to move on.
John turns away from the police team, faces Sherlock and totally invades his personal space, leaning in toward his ear. He drops his voice dangerously low, speaks rapidly, as he only does when he's fuming. "Whatever happened to me being a sounding board? Being your fucking conductor of light? Whatever happened to me being a
He shuts the lid of his laptop and closes his eyes, only to be startled by a ping from his phone sitting on the small table beside him. It’s Mary:
. What had been unexpected about Mycroft tonight was that he had been surprised by the evidence on the wall. Useless. Mycroft had been utterly useless, completely oblivious to what Moriarty had done—was continuing to do—blind to it all, and been played for a fool for years. Yet despite all that, despite the revelations, despite Sherlock being able to prove what Moriarty had been up to all this time, Mycroft still won't tell him what role Moriarty was being groomed for.
I doubt Mycroft really enjoys his brother's tendency to offer critical commentary throughout a movie, but obviously, we're both concerned enough about him that getting him to spend some time not holed up in the bedroom would be an improvement. And he needs to eat. Nibbling on what is on his plate while watching the film might help get something resembling a meal down without a confrontation. "Take our plates in, and I will see if I can roust him out."
Where I had expected to see Sherlock in ski wear beside the patient's bed, the only one standing there is a grey-haired, bespectacled man in a white coat with dark green scrubs underneath. Startled, I sweep my gaze past him to see the patient on the trolley: monitors, wires, IV tubing are snaking about, a nasal oxygen cannula in place, eyes closed, messy, blackish curls above an extraordinarily pale face.
Stone cold, his breaths are coming in little huffs now, minimising the expansion of skin over the surface area over his rib cage. The prickle turns to pain as he resists the urge to move, to encourage the blood that has receded from the surface of his skin to circulate once again.
"Who is she? Why do you waste time teaching beginner? If you want a good dance partner, let me introduce you to some of my friends. They won't step all over you."
“To what end? If they made as much noise as you do when you walk, I would hear them a mile away. And you have quite a distinctive gait, as I have often said. Make a lousy undercover agent.”
, he tells himself, because he doesn't want to be that sort of a husband: small-minded and controlling. Research has always been important to Sherlock. Challenging himself is that, too. John doesn't feel very at home in high society, in a world of millionaires and royalties, and PR and CEOs and personal assistants. He comes from a very modest background, much more modest than Sherlock's academic parents. He remembers his mum doing the taxes with a battered old calculator by the kitchen table.
John has taken Rosie upstairs for bed, leaving Sherlock and his tangled-up thoughts to flit restlessly around the sitting room. He settles on the sofa eventually and picks up a magazine at random from the stack but John’s voice carries down the stairs, tired but gentle. His ears perk up without his permission, permanently tuned to the frequency of John’s voice.
That afternoon, John manages to wrap up his administrative duties early, and after a walk down to the OR floor to see that today's operations are not running overtime and that there are no acute rota issues he needs to sort out, he sends his often overworked secretary home early and heads to the staff garage. His day had been too busy to call home; at some point, he'd decided to trust Edgar to inform him if there is something worrying happening.
, and I want to be the one who's with you when you're anxious or scared. It's my thing. I want to be with you when you're happy and sad and hell, even when you're being the worst menace in England. I just… I've had to let someone carve themselves a space in what used to be just us."
The Prachavio cross-country route proved to be better than I had imagined. Gliding through the quiet pine forests in the bright sunshine was amazing, and I seemed to find a rhythm which had eluded me in downhill. There were a few steeper descents on the undulating track, but I enjoy even those, using Marie's example of the stance to take and how far to keep my skies apart.
John flips his side of the duvet off and springs to his feet. His knee complains, which he ignores; he's by Sherlock's side in no time. "What are you…? What? No, no, no…" he mutters when Sherlock appears to be trying to shove himself under the bed instead of trying to get up. "Up we get."
Sherlock knows better. He'd finally found the man's weakness, his area of vulnerability and now he is hammering home, thrusting again and again into that zone, pushing Moriarty back on the defensive. He's shown the man that if he executes his plan to expose Mycroft, the truth of his own failings will be broadcast to the world. No magical three lines of code; it has all been done with smoke and mirrors, to hide his mundane, crude methods.
The distance from the makeshift prison to the passenger seat of Mrs. Burke’s car is no more than ten metres, but John can feel the burden each and every step is placing on Sherlock’s severely depleted resources. In his unsteady gait, John reads a body exhausted by far too many hours without sleep or sustenance. In his unfocused gaze John sees the strain on a system working overtime to rid itself of a poisonous cocktail of drugs. However, it’s the way in which Sherlock won’t quite meet his gaze when John opens the passenger side door, that sets the alarm bell ringing that Sherlock’s physical injuries may not be the worst of it. Duelling emotions of unadulterated rage at those who did this to Sherlock and a sense of overwhelming guilt at the role he, himself, played in allowing it to happen, compete for dominance as John assists Sherlock into the seat. He forces them down
Sherlock roars in frustration as the drug rips into him, all fanciful musings forgotten as every nerve is lit up, every sense on fire, his heart racing.
"I understand that you had been working on a number of unsolved cases prior to the night in question. Your report described these as 'serial suicides'. Can you explain the meaning of this term?"
As Janine obediently steps back, Irina comes in closer and repeats her earlier instruction. "Eight beats to complete basic steps, but don't step on all eight beats. Feet move on beats one, two, three, and then on four,
Sherlock had been correct: a large sign with black text on the thematic background colour Sherlock had picked instructs him to walk on and then turn left for the
John isn't mollified and still won't look at Sherlock. Keeping his eyes on the flames in the hearth, he comments, "Moran will be motivated by revenge; he'll come after you. By letting him go, you may have a very short time to enjoy your… resurrection."
is what John still finds himself asking Sherlock, following him around the flat, suddenly amazed that he's still real, that he's still himself after all they've been through, because John certainly isn't. Sherlock has changed, too, of course; he's changed a lot even just during the Eurus…
Branger leads the way to a wider spot, turning to face us as we move along to join him. The two Czechs make it there comfortably and start putting their skis on. I can hear the Parisian is about two meters behind me when the American in front suddenly stops. He bows his head, poles grasped firmly and then thrust into the footprints made by the three who have already passed this way. Even from where I am standing, I can hear the ragged breaths, interspersed with the occasional grunt. Is the idiot experiencing vertigo or having a panic attack? Both could be fatal if he faints.
It takes almost another ten minutes before the first set of skiers are allowed to start. The resort staff are only allowing groups of ten to depart at any one time, which is probably sensible to avoid accidents, but it only adds to my frustration. I check my phone for messages; I'm hoping to get one from the guide about tomorrow morning's start time. Signal reception is surprisingly good on Verbier's slopes, even if the bright sun makes it hard to read the screen. What it tells me is that I have no messages,and my battery is running low. I turn it off and shuffle forward as the next lot of ten are released. I can hear a voice in my head that sounds like John's-
Greg gives John a ‘you know how he is’ tilt of the head and John responds with a faint smile and a jerk of his head towards the door, giving his blessing for Greg to go.
, then thought better of it, in deference to the 80-ish woman who had sat next to him. “He’s not the most social person. He doesn’t always play well with others.”
He doesn’t really pay attention to anything or anyone during the entire journey back to Baker Street. The outside world only starts to come back to him when he finds himself, standing in the middle of the living room, staring at the wall—at the post-it notes, and the random pieces of paper stuck next to them. The voice in his head warns him that this is a slippery slope. If he starts to believe and then it all amounts to nothing, he is going to fall harder and deeper into the pit of despair than he ever has before now. Would he be able to get himself out of it? Does he
Sherlock stops him with a raised palm and picks up an unopened envelope from the table which he raises momentarily to show the agency label in the corner. "People lie in their CVs."
South London has its own ambiance, swirling currents of commuters going to and from London to the outer suburbs shape the geography; railway tracks demand diversions of road and foot traffic, carve odd neighbourhoods into cul-de-sacs, places off the beaten path. Bridges and tunnels interrupt anyone looking for a straight line of travel. Away from the upmarket homes near the river, at night the thin veneer of trendiness goes home with the office workers. His loose-limbed saunter, cheap joggers and grubby hoodie is a necessary camouflage, even if it meant he'd had to wave cash at the cabbie to take him.
A veil of sadness passes over John's face and he is lost for a moment in another time. He unconsciously rubs at the small scar on his forehead where it had struck the asphalt in front of St. Barts not so long ago, an eternity ago.
think there could be a problem, or are you just chasing this shiny thing and ignoring all the inconvenient facts?"
There is a trace of patience in Sherlock's tone that I accept as an acknowledgement of my right to express concern about my husband.
Mycroft walks to the stand, wishing he was anywhere but in this place at this time having to speak these words in public. He doesn't even glance up at the courtroom when he gives his affirmation of his intention to tell the truth. He has rehearsed the words he has to say often enough; his innate skills of misdirection honed over a lifetime will save him from any risk of perjury.
John springs to his feet and intercepts him before he gets to the small desk in the corner. "Bed. You. Me. Now."
"What would be the first moment during such an event as this when one might leave? In a socially acceptable manner?"
That’s what his fortune had said. The capitalisation had seemed bizarre to him, had stuck like a burr in his head, but he’d dismissed it. For months after Sherlock’s death, he had looked for clues, for meaning in everything. He’d been desperate for some sort of sign that it was all “just a magic trick”, as Sherlock had said. After six months or so, he’d stopped. Stopped looking, stopped wishing, stopped hoping. Sherlock was dead. He’d watched him fall.
John's brows hitched up and he finally let Rosie slide onto the floor, where she instantly began stumbling towards the sofa. "Perfect recall? Is that the perfect recall that never lets you remember anything I've ever asked you to bring home from the shops?"
Half an hour later he's back on the M1, paddle in the trunk, kayak strapped securely to the roof with plenty of “helpful” advice (“one real paddler to another”) on board. He's got one eye on the road southwest while he rehearses his route.
John leans across the table and takes Sherlock's face between his two hands. "No, love. I think you are going to succeed as long as you don't go overboard with the stress and the workload. Every time you operate on someone, there's a chance of failure, but nobody would ever tell you to stop doing surgery because of that. When there
"How much of that time is going to be eaten up by bureaucratic drivel rather than the brainwork involved in design? GOSH is an NHS Trust, and the only thing I trust the system to do well is to bury any supervising staff under so much paperwork that it eats into all the more important things — such as making sure patients get treated in a timely manner or research is actually conducted."
Mycroft has come up behind us and rolls his eyes. "Nothing is ever good enough for you, Sherlock. I swear that even heliskiing would result in complaints about snow quality."
Jim rummages in the bedside side table and tosses a pair of police-issue handcuffs at him with some force. Sebastian plucks them out of the air before they can impact with his sternum.
Sebastian's punch stops him mid-sentence. The force is enough to turn his head and split his lip open again but interestingly, the blow isn’t as hard as it could have been.
"You, getting wound up tighter than a drum. It's not going to stop now. If the project goes ahead..."
“Jo-” Sherlock starts, but his words are cut off as John’s left hand comes up to take a firm grip on the nape of his neck.
“It’s OK, I’m going to take care of you." He looks closely at Sherlock's eyes, trying to judge the dilation of his pupils in the dim light. Apart from being bloodshot to hell, they look relatively normal. "What was in the syringe and how long ago?"
"And you fell for it. So, stay away from him. Now let's go get this paperwork done so you can go home."
"Oh?" My curiosity is piqued; Sherlock will be delighted for any bits of gossip as much as he tries to pretend the notion of Mycroft's social life repulses him.
After that little altercation things have gone from bad to worse for John. He's had to endure more than the usual allocation of stupidity, ranging from tissue samples lost in the internal delivery system and a trainee gynaecologist contesting a decision not to accept her whirlwind resignation mid-contract to take a gap year with a boyfriend, all the way to equipment failures that John is somehow expected to fix with some magic screwdriver. The latest iteration of that particular hell — with OR staff all standing around looking at him like it's his fault — is when a theatre has to be taken out of commission for the two hours it takes to get the new 3D endoscopic system back into working order. When he finally solves that logjam by convincing the company's maintenance team to let them jump the queue (
Edgar steps closer just as John does. "Do you want me to––" he asks, but John shakes his head before saying firmly, "I'll take it from here." Now, a smile spreads easily onto his features as he regards Edgar triumphantly. "You've done great. Thank you. I'll text you about his schedules tomorrow," he promises, feeling very charitable.
out on the lake. Lots of people now—other skiers who were behind the fall zone—trying to find someone else further back." He lifted his pole to point back at the dam. "The rescue copter just went over, should be there by now."
She refills his tea cup, and then gets up to pop two more of the cooling biscuits onto their side plates. "You have to get him under control somehow. I mean, it's a health hazard if nothing else! And where on earth did he get a gun?!”
The betrayal in that thought fuels John's rapid strides as he walks to the Old Operating Theatre from London Bridge station. Anger stops him from going up the tower again. What's the point of returning to the scene of the crime, if all he's going to see is what Sherlock had wanted him to see? Anyway, it's pointless, as his last trip up there had proven. The evidence has been cleaned up; it's as if it had never happened.
it, either, as Mycroft had tutted several times when he'd popped over for tea and reminded his  younger brother that paying taxes was neither voluntary nor a matter of perspective.
Sherlock pauses for a minute then turns away from her and resumes pacing. "Do I need to remind you that you are paid to catch criminals, not to dissect my private life?” He stops for a moment to peek through the blinds that shield the DI's office from the main room. There seems to be a cluster of people around one of the computers, and a few of the officers are looking at their phones.
A month into the new split schedule, over supper, John asks Sherlock whether things at GOSH are living up to his expectations.
Not many people would describe his big brother as average or normal — more likely they would describe him as intelligent, somewhat intimidating and very, very snobby, but none of those things would make people treat Mycroft like a family secret.
Sebastian can’t see Jim's face as his head is turned away from him, cheek pressed to the grass, but he doesn't need to check to know that Jim is dead. He watched a round lead ball exit through the back of his head, the blood spatter visible even at this distance. A round ball leaves no neat wound; he doesn't need to see it to know that there is no chance of survival. He saw the pistol fall limply from Jim's hand. Saw him fall to the ground.
Sherlock's mother had reminisced to John when the topic had come up. Turns out that Sherlock's instinctive panic reaction to an invasion of his oral cavity is still clamping his jaws shut and tearing out of the chair like a bat out of hell, no matter what instruments are still hanging from his mouth. Before John had even been out of his chair, and Jennifer had had time to react, Sherlock had scrambled out of the chair, groggy as he was from all the midazolam and the nitrous oxide. He had ended up on all fours on the floor, hyperventilating a bit and then thrown up on John's shoes when he'd tried to help him to his very shaky feet. His sensory processing becoming overwhelmed messes with his sense of balance, causing vertigo and nausea. The halo rig had been hell in that regard for the first few weeks. Both Sherlock and his mother had told John that he reacts atypically to many benzodiazepines. Instead of calming him like they do most people, lorazepam had given him a panic attack and hallucinations and, as they had learned that afternoon, midazolam wasn't much better. That horrible appointment is something John does not want repeated, and he's sure Sherlock, the dentist and Jennifer share his sentiment.
"Edgar needs a good briefing," John says firmly. "He does need to understand the medical side of things — to know what's to be expected."
To be caught on the hop by an errant fist had been bad enough, but to have the incident recorded for all of posterity just adds insult to the injury. Even worse, Jim had positively
hates how easily he can be flung back into feeling like that, and Violet has always been an instantaneous and devastating trigger for it.
An electromagnetic pulse! Something strong enough to fry all the electrics in the plane. Not a software issue at all, but rather a weakness in hardware. Only military planes were semi-shielded from EMP weapons.
The answer can't be what he is hoping for because he hangs up the call without further comment, and then sighs. His head turns towards the clock on the kitchen wall and Sebastian follows his gaze. At just past four in the afternoon, Mycroft and his team of minions have a little less than ten hours to figure out whatever scheme Jim is planning to pull off. Sebastian laughs to himself.
Sherlock has no way of measuring time; his watch had been removed at some point. Whatever Moran's dose had been, it was wearing off. He can feel the familiar buzz-saw headache coming. His skin is crawling, whether it's from some biting insects on the ground or his own overtaxed nerves, he can't tell.
Now Sherlock gives him an offended look. "You think I am easily distracted, haphazard in my interests, unwilling to see something through?"
Somehow that almost nonchalant attitude of his rubs John's nerves to a frazzle. If the git could be bothered to make eye contact, he'd know that this whole bizarre scenario is adding fuel to the burning fire of John's anger.
Molly stepped into the kitchen to put the tea tray down. These days the microscope and chemicals —and the various bits of biological matter— lived downstairs in 221C. The kitchen table was far more often covered by crayons and glitter and glue, or a handful of plush animals and a plastic tea service, or, occasionally, even dinner.
The red starts to fade and John finds himself staring at his hands still clenched into fists, holding tight to the stranger pushed up against the door. Someone who simply had the misfortune of encountering John Watson - hurting, angry, empty. John throws himself backwards, releasing his hold as fast as he can.
John rolls his eyes as he pushes open the door to the ground floor; the cafeteria should be reasonably quiet at this time of the afternoon. "Sherlock, you're the one who called me. So, why?"
It may only be half four in the afternoon, but the January sun has already set, and John is in need of a stiff drink. Tucking his journals up under his arm, he takes the whisky and his mug into the living room takes one quick look around and is immediately overwhelmed. He doesn’t even know where to begin to start. He flops down into the armchair he's always thought of as his, knowing that it isn’t and he won't be taking it with him.
He flicks her cheek again, this time with more ferocity. She can't stop the squeak of both pain and frustration that emerges from her mouth.
It's not quite a giggle at a crime scene, but it is the  first time since … well, before all of this happened, that John has heard that playfulness in Sherlock’s voice and his heart strikes a discordant beat at the thought that perhaps not everything is lost.
Her eyes are fixed on Sherlock, demanding and expectant. He blinks, feeling the old frustration flooding over. "Don't drag John into this," he warns. "He doesn't like having to pick sides, and I'll have you know he will
It makes John smirk. "I envy your surgeon's eye-hand coordination." He rises to his feet as well, steps into Sherlock's orbit and wraps his arms around his waist. "Come here."
We sweep into the Westin hotel, looking the part with the other patrons. There is something about Sherlock in a suit with his long Belstaff coat unbuttoned that makes a lasting sartorial impression.
"He's––" I swallow, "He's the one they brought in. Not someone else. There was no patient, I mean apart from just him, rescued from the avalanche. Well, there was another, but they died before reaching the hospital."
"It's the staff that make you want to stay at King's, and the staff who are causing you the most doubt about this job offer. Could we rephrase that? What
“There’s no way we could have seen this coming, no matter --” Greg tries, but Sherlock cuts him off.
There is something in these questions that makes John sad. Does Sherlock really believe that he is so shallow and self-centred to be thinking such things? Admittedly, he's had some petty thoughts lately when it comes to Edgar, but it's the last thing he wants to signal to Sherlock that he doesn't believe in his husband. "You've changed a lot since the days when I first knew you and sometimes… sometimes I wonder if I've just stayed the same, and not in very good ways. Sometimes I worry you might… outgrow me, outgrow us if I no longer have to be the one to sort things out with Anderson. You decided on your own to seek therapy to help you resolve some things even though you'd had some pretty shitty experiences with it before while I had to be told off by Greg for being a coward about needing help myself. I'm not the one who finally had the guts to tell your family the truth about the way they had been dealing with you. And you're already doing this thing with Edgar to sort out some of the domestic stuff that gets in the way of our time together. You did all of those things yourself; you didn't need me. And that's okay."
Moran shakes his head. "He doesn't need your help. Bezos will do whatever it takes to keep the Americans from attacking Moriarty, because if he doesn't Amazon will be destroyed. The fate of one Irishman and a bit of money extorted from Amazon on one side of the scales versus the collapse of a three-trillion-dollar company that's one of America's Big Five flagships of capitalist consumerism? Get real."
to lie — upsets him, but he is determined to avoid drowning, and if a fabrication can keep his social ineptitude from making things even worse, so be it.
. Sebastian drops his feet from the table onto the carpet, leans forward, perching his elbows on his knees and zooms in on the object. Mycroft’s phone.
His hands go to his hair where his fingers worry the curls into a dishevelled mess. He needs something, anything, a distraction. And razing the remainder of Moriarty’s network to the ground would be the perfect one. But Mycroft is still going to make him wait another two days for it. Intolerable.
That stings a bit, Mycroft has to admit. His star has fallen a long way in a very short time. The fall from grace, as steep as that crashing plane's final descent.
The violence in Jim’s eyes changes to something… more curious, like he’s looking at Sebastian for the first time.
"I could say that he's the silver lining on that dreadful gift my mother once gave us at Christmas of a concierge service. I simply took that and upgraded it to a more appropriate arrangement. Edgar has proven himself highly useful in making sure I don't have to shift my attention to minutiae. The latest piece of his genius has been that he monitors traffic patterns and the iPhone app Find My Friends to coordinate commutes when possible. Due to his knee, John's running has been put on hold for a few months, and on days when the weather doesn't favour walking, Edgar alerts him to when John leaves work so that we can carpool."
“I don’t mean business partners. Not just, at least. Partners in every… sense. That is, I hope that maybe we can expand that definition to include… more.”
"If I may ask — Violet, when Sherlock was young, did you ever receive counselling for yourself and Mister Holmes when it came to the parenting of a special needs child? I know peer support groups did not exist very widely but were there any kind of counselling made available to you separately from the therapy and support Sherlock received?"
John grabs his crutches, grabs the handles and rises to his feet. Sherlock gingerly grabs his overnight bag.
John’s jaw dropped. When the shock subsided, he shook his head in fond exasperation then started laughing before admitting, “I was running out of insults. I will make every effort to use more accurate terminology in the future.”
Whatever shut-eye Sherlock had gotten during the drive from the shooting grounds has served somewhat to refuel his energy reserves, but he is still a bit unsteady on his feet as he proceeds to wrap Mrs Burke’s long coat even more tightly around his torso and ascend the stairs. His feet are clad in a pair of the drysuit socks and trousers, but the fleece base-layer was never intended to be worn on its own and John knows that the winter chill must be cutting right through. He wants to reach out and catch Sherlock’s elbow, assist him up to the front door, but he doesn’t quite know what his place is at the moment or whether Sherlock would even want that. So, he stands guard, hovering just within arm’s reach as he climbs, one step behind, ready this time to catch him if he falls.
"I'm not a leader," Sherlock says, frustration in his tone as he puts the tablet away and stares at the ceiling. "I don't know what to do with people; I don't care enough to be able to predict what their needs will be. They have to be able to tell me what they need, but how on earth can I manage to put that into a job description?  When it comes to the interviews, there are going to be other people on the panel. I can't come out and ask point-blank, '
," Marie commented while I caught my breath. I had told her that I'd rather have the uphill cardio workout than get stuck on yet another chairlift or gondola. My appetite for them has waned a lot over the past two days. Without Sherlock to distract me, I find the claustrophobia of the
Three and a half minutes of small talk later, the kettle has boiled and John knows all there is to know about Lestrade’s festive activities – obligatory breakfast with his parents in Seven Sisters then a dash halfway across London to dinner with his kids, ex-wife and her (excruciatingly boring, but usefully wealthy) current boyfriend in Twickenham. Or at least it would have been dinner if Greg had been able to stay long enough to partake, but he'd been called into the office due to ‘an incident’ on the Heath. Lestrade shoots a dirty look in Sherlock’s direction and John rather regrets having asked the question in the first place. Though under the circumstances, he reasons there are probably very few safe topics.
The guide nods, acknowledging my credentials, before giving us a stern look. "This trip is rated for expert skiers only, not intermediates. There was good snow last night, so we will have about twenty to thirty centimetres of fresh powder. If you are not experienced on powder, you need to re-think this trip. Mont Fort Backside is not for anyone with doubts. Cancel now, and it will not cost you a centime — full refund. This is better than having an injury or being miserable and slowing the rest of us down. Has anyone here not skied on powder off-piste in Switzerland?"
"It's not a choice you made, becoming the parent of a special needs child and yes, it's going to be very hard, but trying to hide the negative feelings and feeling guilty for them is not going to help," Doctor Pichler says. "That's why we're here — to talk about things you can't easily talk about with your spouses and families and colleagues — or your children."
, swirl of foamed milk," he sits down at a high table and considers what the hell he is going to do.  He tries to tune out the annoying muzak carols that seem to be on a continuous loop in every shop.
There's a red light as John prepares to turn to Caldecot Road which allows him to look at his partner, confounded. "Edgar?"
Sipping his tea, John says, "So, you just want to give up on trying to manage things yourself? How is that serving your plan of showing everyone you can take on more responsibility?"
“In this area we see the sunken floor of the theatre and the rows of spectator seating rising above in a semi-circle around it. Could you describe the evidence processed from the scene and where it was found?”
At least when it comes to his mother, accepting responsibility does seem important, regardless of whether guilt is involved. This realisation leads Sherlock further onto the subject of responsibility. He needs to talk to John about this offer from GOSH because it involves a whole professional new level of just that. It's also the kind of responsibility John's role at King's involves in troves, and which Sherlock has done his best to avoid because he has no aptitude for it. However flattering it may be to get approached for such a position, the thought of its reality is terrifying. Stella is right, of course, in that his initial reaction to it coming from a stranger would have been to say
I pat his dark mop of hair. "Not easy if that role means she has to be believable to both the Israelis and the Palestinians. And, it destroyed her in the end. Living a lie isn't easy."
The sound of a clock striking the half hour makes him glance at his watch in a panic: it's twelve-thirty. He heads back to the kitchen, gun drawn, to find out when lunch is due to be served and whether there will be one at the table, or two.
John glances at the caller ID — Mycroft. Sherlock must sense that John wants to be included, (see desperately needs to be included) in the conversation, because when he answers the call, he puts it on speaker.
Greg just laughs. "Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen. We've got patients on trolleys in corridors and finding anything more than a broom closet is impossible. I can't compete with a brand-new building, can I? So, you're sure Sherlock's not sniffing around at any position at GOSH?"
John considers that and concludes that it does make sense. While he can be the patron saint of irregularity and spontaneity when it comes to food and sex, certain routines matter to Sherlock, especially when they have to do with work. "Are you sure two days are enough — that it won't bleed into your free time and your King's days? And trying to cram in all of your clinical work into three days…"
Another fair point, and she’d already made several. He hadn’t been looking for a confidant, after all. Something in her behaviour had made him conclude that she would be not only safe, but helpful. He’d shoved the scrap of paper into his pocket.
The Cambridge-educated Austrian-born psychiatrist offers them tea; Violet declines it for them both before Sherlock gets a word in.
But the timeline doesn't work properly, given that the Mystery Man had been involved in the attempt to murder Sherlock when he was at the Priory Clinic before he went up to Cambridge. From his research for the Smallwood case, Sherlock knows that Magnussen was in Australia for most of 1997, sniffing around the Fairfax media empire that was also being stalked by Kerry Packer and Conrad Black.
Sherlock is still investigating the memory stick. "There is a very clear fingerprint on this. Almost as if it's been put there on purpose."  He gets his phone out, zooms in and takes a photo, sending it to Mycroft.
Jim strolls back and forth across the rug, his feet moving the air right next to Sebastian's face. He braces himself for a strike, for a kick to the back of the head or one to his nose. Jim broke it badly the last time. And then of course, insisted it be fixed by the best plastic surgeon in the country. But no, Jim’s clearly in the mood to take this really, really slowly.
"I wonder if he ever read that CV of yours or if he forgot about it," John says. "That's one of his better qualities — he judges people by what they say and what they do and how competent they are, not based on educational credentials or pedigree. He likes saying that professor-level university people are often some of the intellectually laziest wastes of space in the medical establishment."
her penchant for their sparring no doubt prompting her to keep the channels of antagonistic communication between them open — but unlike Lestrade, she doesn’t have the authority to bring him in on a case.
It's like watching a car crash in slow motion. The idiot is throwing his upper body into the turn prematurely, forcing his skis to follow, which means he's rotated his chest, head and shoulders too far when the time comes to turn in the opposite direction. Every turn he makes gets more and more extreme and unbalanced. It goes from bad to worse as he makes his next turn, moving not only his inside ski but over-rotating his body, exaggerating the effect and pushing his weight even more on the inside ski.
Moriarty mimes zipping his lips, and looks straight at Mycroft, who is startled by a vibration in his inside top jacket pocket. He'd switched his phone to silent before entering the courtroom, but not off. Given his line of work, turning his phone completely off is not a luxury in which he can indulge.
Lestrade takes a breath. "I can tell you've made a big difference to him over the wobbles he had after Christmas; those reminded me of what happened when you went to Afghanistan. He seems to have sorted things and is back, firing on all cylinders again. Christ, he even apologised to Anderson around that thing with Alice. I wouldn't have believed it could be possible. No patient complaints lately, either. I hope he's happy here."
John laughs, and sooner rather than later, his relieved amusement is mirrored by the smile on Sherlock's features. "Well, I think I can do that. I believe that topic's covered on page sixteen on my extensive notes on the care and feeding of mad geniuses."
She writes down a couple of words. He wonders how many times “trust issues” appears in the notes of his sessions with her.
John’s knowledge. And John doesn’t know if that is better or worse — being on the receiving end of someone’s death or knowingly sending them off on their own to it.
“But that’s half the fun.” She can't miss the opportunity to tease. “I’m learning this so I can meet my future husband.”
The colour drains out of Greg's face. "Oh, shit. You're not telling me he is thinking of leaving us?!"
let him out of my sight again. He may have lied to me, but I'll forgive him for that eventually. What I would not have forgiven is if he'd––
Maybe it's better to write the middle sentence first? At least that should have seven syllables. But you can't think of a single syllable word to add to those six that would make the slightest bit of sense.
“So, no network, no Moran,” Sherlock splays his fingers over the smooth marble surface of the table. “What about family history?”
He pulls himself up to his full height, and makes a move to straighten the collar on his Belstaff, only to remember that he’s not wearing it — it’s still in Mycroft’s townhouse. Instead, he diverts his hands, running them down the front of his jacket to ease out the non-existent creases and heads for the door.
“Not at all. Look it up.” Sherlock brings the fortune to eye level and his gaze narrows. At the same time, his fair skin takes on a faintly rosy tint that John finds unnervingly attractive.
The Coroner frowns. "If it was a suicide, what about a note?  Isn’t that what people do, leave a note?”
Keeping his back turned, Sebastian relives the moment when the cameras had gone mad and the officers dragged Watson off him, shouting that he'd be put into handcuffs if he resisted. Behind him, the TV repeats the barrage of questions that journalists had shouted as the DI had helped Sebastian to his feet. "Do you want to press charges?"
"Is that why I am here? Because you've suddenly decided you know better than me what goes on in my head? Are you going to use this as an opportunity to accuse me of all sorts of things?"
"There is an opportunity cost, but for you, I am willing to pay it," he had explained to me when I'd finally voiced my mounting embarrassment. I assured him that the gesture was appreciated, and that he was off the hook. Now, I just let him do his thing. It's a bit like his scuba diving. Give me a snorkel, and I will be happy; don’t ask me to join him exploring a wreck on the seabed.
They had spoken of those two years only once. For two hours, John had listened and Sherlock had spoken. Ella had sat opposite, quiet and encouraging. It was the last time they'd gone to see her.
John could see Scott warring with Sherlock.  Scott was going to have to win. Sherlock started to mumble what was written.
Moran flinches in surprise, no doubt caught off guard by the sudden turnaround in Sherlock’s demeanour. The look of surprise is quickly followed by a flash of annoyance — evidence of the direct hit of Sherlock's deduction. But any response he might have had is cut short in the next moment, by the sound of an approaching car.
Sherlock looks like he doesn't. He must have been very distracted by the gala dinner, of course. "You need to be on your feet at home every two hours to prevent DVT," he declares.
"Sorry, ma'am—CFR stands for Community First Responders. To use resources appropriately, the Control Room has to make decisions about whether to send ambulances for patient transport, or to include paramedics or Specialist Advanced Paramedics."
My glare should be strong enough to pin Sherlock to the bed, but just in case he isn't getting the message, I add the command: "Stay put. I need to send Philippe back to Verbier to sort some things out."
"Your Doctor is not an idiot.” Mycroft brings up a photo on the screen of his phone and turns it to face Sherlock.
Suddenly, John giggled. He giggled, because they had survived it all and they were here, back at Baker Street where they belonged, and they were fine, and there was a bloody gravestone in the halland it wasn't anywhere near the barmiest thing that Sherlock had brought into their home.
Does it give him a special thrill to be here? Of course; you don’t build a beach if you want to hide a pebble; you just find a shingle beach. And where better to hide in plain sight, orchestrating the downfall of the British Empire’s most dedicated civil servant than here—St Ermin's, the home base for secret British spies and the wartime intelligence community in the 1930’s. He prides himself that even the stiff upper lip of one Mycroft Holmes couldn’t fail to curl in response to the blatant antagonism of making this symbolic gesture.
He directs his words at the psychiatrist rather than his mother. "Before Africa, I simply consulted you about how I could train my registrar more efficiently at King's. I had no desire to embark on a formal therapeutic relationship, and that Christmas which was just mentioned wasn't anything new." He draws a breath. "Things being tense between us is not new but it was just too much to bear at the time; I was under a lot of stress, only some of it connected to my parents. I could say that things were better than ever at work after Africa; I felt like I had turned a leaf in dealing with people. One would assume such things would make it easier to deal with other difficulties, but I was as surprised as my mother was when I suddenly found it very hard to put up with the same old patterns in Sussex. And, the…" he stumbles on the explanation, takes a pause to try to find the right words. He's reluctant to mention the mugging which had acted as a catalyst for that Christmas implosion. He already knows she thinks it happened because he was his usual
“I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again,” the DI had assured before hurrying off, ostensibly, to have a stern word with the aforementioned doctor.
"We took him mostly to private clinics. We found the best people we could find. None of the therapists wanted us in there with him during the sessions; they said it interfered with his concentration."
The man then plops himself down in the chair across the kitchen table from John, before finally catching on to the sombre mood in the room he had entered. Is it John's imagination, or is Sherlock avoiding proper eye contact with him? Perhaps he is relying on the presence of their landlady to avoid any conversation about what had happened yesterday evening.
When Edgar catches John watching him, the former flashes a restrained smile. John finds himself annoyed that it's not smarmy enough to justify his annoyance at the man's presence in their flat. If anything, Edgar's current demeanour is disarming, and it makes John want to roll his eyes.
Sebastian rolls onto his back and shuffles back to sit against the headboard, instantly regretting his earlier removal of the pillows as the rigid steel presses relentlessness into his vertebrae, unsoftened by the thin fabric of the shirt between him and it.
What would Sherlock do? If he is alive, if he were here … John closes his eyes and draws a deep breath. No matter how pissed off he'd be with Sherlock for pretending to be dead, none of that would matter if he is still alive and able to get this bastard, once and for all.
Sebastian’s eyes water as he tries desperately not to gag around the length that is now pressing painfully into the back of his throat as Jim continues to hold his head in place with a vice-like grip on his hair. It doesn't help that the monsoon shower is dousing them both in a heavy stream of water. For a split second, Sebastian thinks of being waterboarded, and it makes him jerk his head back, pulling away from Jim fucking his throat. He gags, coughs and tries to get his breathing back under control.
Branger's expression is stern. "Pierre and a couple of other skiers who have stopped to help will get you the rest of the way out, make sure the emergency services find you."
Donovan sets her cup down on the table. She hasn’t said a word since she entered the flat, but it looks like she is keen to get started. “And how is that, exactly? Official word was that Jim Moriarty put a gun in his mouth on Hampstead Heath on Christmas Day and pulled the trigger.”
Janine nods, as Irina uses her remote to begin the music again. It's perhaps the most popular salsa piece ever,
"I'm sorry," Sherlock says to the people at the table, some of who have begun to whisper among themselves. "I turned my phone off, but because my partner is in hospital just recovering from surgery, so I asked my assistant to contact me if something came up. Please excuse me."
The book lies unopened on the coffee table. You've cleared away the piles of Sherlock's papers, journals, the debris prised off the wall over the sofa —his last evidence board, his attempts to track Moriarty's thinking.
Janine. That's another source of pain. He feels the odd pang of regret that his plan means he has to lie to her to such a degree. Lying is easy when it's useful to trap a suspect, break a crime network, dodge a difficult question from an outsider. He finds it harder with people he knows well. The session tonight with her at the dance studio had been tedious, and he'd struggled to keep up the smile as Irina and her partner did a "catch-up" session, running though the four dances that Janine has learned since she started. The salsa still troubles her, the quickstep still amuses her. She can manage a foxtrot and a waltz, so long as the man she is dancing with keeps to basic steps and gives her a firm lead.
"OH!" Sherlock stops in mid-stride and brings his hands up under his chin. "Oh, stupid, stupid. John, we have to get back to the flat."
Sherlock shrugs, hoping to convey a scepticism that Janine will see as raising his romantic potential. "As everyone tells me, marriage changes people. He's moved out, is working full-time and hasn’t worked a case with me for almost six weeks, so no longer a flatmate or colleague. He and Mary have been back from Morocco a week already and he hasn't made contact. His friendship seems linked to proximity."
He rubs a hand roughly over his face and through his hair. Looking down, he frowns at the wrinkles in the clothes he is still wearing, the clothes he fell asleep in. He stumbles out of bed and trips over his boots lying in the middle of the floor. At least he remembered to take
After the wedding, Greg’s low-level worries had started growing again. Sally hadn’t been certain which of the pair he’d been more worried about, but by then she’d known them well enough to know that it didn’t matter. What affected one of them affected both.
"I will be outstandingly busy for some time and am aware of my tendency to get absorbed by work and my interests." Sherlock is now looking at John with an expression somewhere between pleading and worried. "It's not easy for me to shift from that to anything else. I don't know if anyone can provide assistance with that, but if I had a system, some manner in which to prepare for…" He sighs. "Lost my train of thought."
Sherlock lifts the barrel and moves it to the side, revealing a metal hatch with an equally rusty wheel, and a hose connection — some sort of storage tank? Yes, that would make sense for a farm ... There’s a vent on one side that looks to be clear; it would need to be if the fuel was to be siphoned out. If it's been turned into something else, then the vent would be needed to allow it to be used, for storage. He decides to take a look, grateful that the vent should prove useful. The height of indignity would be expiring due to lack of oxygen in the confined space before Moran even got to him.
A response looks to form itself on Mycroft’s lips but just as soon disappears, and his brother’s eyes land on John, seated on the other side.
The small establishment is crowded but many seem to be locals. Skiers and snowboarders are everywhere in the area but this parking area has more snowmobiles than cars. Perhaps, unless you really know the roads like Philippe obviously does, it might be a challenge to navigate the small, windy and snowy road here, up north, from the centre of Verbier.
A sense of profound loss grabs him by the throat, and he turns away, choking down his anger at the upsurge of useless emotions. Cocaine can do that to him, loosening his grip enough that he can't always fight off the waves of stupid sentiment.
His finger flex into fists at his sides, then relaxes. The lines of his shoulders tighten and shift; sometimes, the intensity of his thought processes can be read on his body. Joanna suspects John Watson has learned to read this language, and that it has made him so uniquely good at defusing the bombs Sherlock's neurological makeup constructs at times.
Sherlock leans his cheek on his fist, looking broodingly thoughtful as he skims the concierge agency website. "Your behaviour signalled you wanted to repel him, yet you are now singing his praises. Odd."
"Not what I meant. You help messsee the potential gains of tolerating certain things, such as the company of your friends or avoiding the risks and potential effect of resp–– repeated general anaesthesia on long-term cognition. Although it's not really been proven very well in any other cohorts bessides the elderly, I would prefer to err on the side of cautery."
"I do not expect us to be that similar, since our brains vary from the norm in different ways," Edgar says, "but it seems we have certain things in common."
He grimaces as he attempts to make way through the delicate strands without announcing his presence. He can't avoid the occasional tinkle of glass beads as he slips through, but he's quiet. Certainly quiet enough to evade detection by the occupant of the downstairs flat who is going to be sound asleep, if the lingering aroma of marijuana is anything to go by. The evidence of self-medication is confirmed when his pocket torch illuminates the stubs in the ashtray on the kitchen table.
Sherlock is genuinely surprised by the question. "Of course! I haven't lived through all this admin hell just to bolt when the
He keeps chanting "Back, replace, forward; forward, replace back." Janine is quite stiff, not moving her hips enough and stepping too firmly so the sound of her shoes clumps on the wooden floor, but at least her steps are more or less in time with the music now. She's counting out loud, "One, two, three,
John remembers the sword hanging up in Sherlock's bedroom. He'd never asked about it; just read the little brass plaque:
John isn't ready for this—to rule out murder before he's even had a chance to speak is outrageous. He’s never going to be ready for this; talking about Sherlock, but this makes it far worse. He manages to get to his feet and strides purposefully to the witness box.
You get to work on the top of the bookcase, spraying and then rubbing until a shine comes up. Mrs Hudson and Sherlock had waged war against each other on the subject of dust. She would do some cleaning when they were out of the flat, but no matter how carefully she re-positioned an item, he would notice and almost flinch in pain. You notice that she isn't being as careful now.
*Pronounced uh ROON-shark: Literally means “secret love” — a very passionate way of saying “beloved.” “A leanbh” (uh LAN-uv): literally means “my child.”
When Mycroft does finally arrive back in the living room at ten to twelve, he gives a huff and an exaggerated roll of his eyes. "Good Lord. Just when I thought it was safe…"
Sherlock averts his gaze from me to look over at the man on the other side of the bed. His brows knit together, and it seems to take him a moment to work out what he's supposed to do. "Yes.
His hand is surprisingly warm. “Now step to the side.” He gives her a firm steer with his shoulders, and then her right foot is moving without her having to think about it. “Now bring the left foot together to the right.”
The startling blue eyes that look up at you are wet, grief etching lines of pain in his face. "No…these are important, if not to you, to me."
He tries to look at her, but somehow can't seem to make eye-contact. "It's a lot of responsibility. What happens if I make a mess of it? If it's too much for me to cope with? If it means that what I've managed to achieve at King's, and with John, is somehow at risk or even damaged by it? I'd be left in an untenable position with
Even the way Jim moves is intoxicating, like somehow the atmosphere around him bends to his will, not the other way round. Certainly, every person Jim comes across does, Sebastian wouldn't be surprised if all the atoms in the universe did so too.
Doctor Pichler got up from her chair. "I suggest we all think about this for a while before making any decisions about another session."
"I saw your mother a couple of days ago for lunch at the National Portrait Gallery. We discussed the Chailey Foundation she's joined."
Shocked into wakefulness, you turn your eyes away from the unfamiliar ceiling. A sense of where you are eludes you until someone slams a door upstairs and the sound allows you to locate your current position: pinned down by a nightmare, lying in bed, at Number 32 Petworth House, Pytchley Road, East Dulwich, SE22 8DD, London.
When it comes, it's a whisper, a puff of breath in his right ear. Although Jim must be standing close, Sebastian can't feel the heat of his body. Cold. It causes him to shiver. And that results in a sudden back-hand slap across his face, so hard that sends him tumbling sideways onto his flank. He doesn't put his hands out to brace his fall, not allowed, so the impact of his hip and shoulder with the floor is jarring.
When he'd said that he didn't have friends, rather than argue that you were one such friend, you'd snarked back, "Wonder why?"
He shakes his head, sweeping away that line of thought as he looks up at the screen above the boarding gate, holding out his phone out for the boarding card to be scanned.
Sherlock's third night in the doss house near Herne Hill is uneventful. A new lookout on the door, who keeps his head down, features hidden in the depths of his hoodie, but nothing else is different, which suits him admirably. He slips another twenty-pound note into the grubby hand, asking him to keep an eye on him during the night, making sure he's still breathing.
"It's okay. You had some really good points about the service which I hadn't thought of. I don't mind having Edgar around, honestly."
“John,” he exclaims as he walks back towards him, transfers his file of patient notes from his right hand to his left, and shakes John’s hand enthusiastically, “it’s good to see you.” The expression on his face then turns to something a bit more like concern as he carefully asks. “How’ve you been?”
He pours her another measure of cognac. "I'm spending time amongst the homeless tonight, staking out a criminal who operates a sex trafficking ring in south London. His people work at night, and therefore, so must I."
It won't be long, though. Mycroft knows that Moriarty has lit a fuse, and the line of gunpowder is heading in Mycroft's direction. Having made his case to the powers that be after the near-miss incident to pay the demanded ransom, Mycroft had to endure the ignominy of having to explain how the bitcoin disappeared into the ether as soon as it was sent. It is no wonder that Mycroft and his actions are now (quite rightly) under extreme scrutiny as the pressure on the government increases. If that scrutiny had been intense before, it has become absolutely forensic following the downed BA flight.
I don't think it'll do either of us any good to start talking about the past right now. He's had a fright, and that's what this ought to be about. "I know you didn't mean it like that. How much do you remember about the avalanche? It must have been horrible for you."
He should be angry. If what has happened is some sort of elaborate plot, and Sherlock has kept him in the dark about it, then he deserves one hell of an earful about it. But when he reaches for that emotion, John can’t find it; he’s empty.
Moriarty's eyes darken; in his pale-skinned face, they seem to go completely black and John's fingers tighten on the grip of his gun.
The DI rolls his eyes. "I'm not Mycroft Holmes, you know. It's only lucky that this time you didn't manage to inflict any damage on Moran. The best I can talk the police into is giving you a Conditional Caution. So long as you admit to the assault, that's likely to involve twenty hours of community service and a referral to an anger-management course. You might want to consider bereavement counselling, too."
Four clicks later and the CCTV film is running. By now Lestrade has joined John and Sherlock as they watch the black and white footage of Steiner leaving via the front doors; the time stamp is clear. John says what they are all thinking. "That's only ninety-three minutes ago."
Violet's breath hitches in her throat. She's never really heard anyone say such a thing out loud, but she understands very well how a mother of might give in to frustration and fear like that. She's had some dark nights of the soul herself.
It's been quite a formidable challenge, overcoming the damage done by Sherlock's prior therapists in decimating his willingness to trust any healthcare professional seeking to explore his mental health and the way he thinks and functions. In fact, it had taken a significant crisis to get him to open up about certain aspects of his life. He had been open to discussing his ASD before, but only in very general terms. He also had, for long, insisted that he was not a patient. Connecting the idea of his autism to needing psychological help appeared to be very difficult for him, and Joanna now understands how that could be connected to the constant signals from his surroundings when he was a child that there was something wrong with him that had to be fixed. And, if not fixed, suppressed, because his mother, in particular, seems to have valued false normality over the well-being of his son. The autistic traits of his which could not be suppressed had been brutally conditioned not to be manifested in front of others.
"Ridiculous, John. Of all the corvids, magpies are the least dangerous to lambs. They do prey on other songbirds, it has to be said, but only for the eggs."
Late that night, looking around at the newly gleaming surfaces, the tidier room mocks him. Everything is in its rightful place except the one person who should be.
Normally, when faced with a confounding conversation such as this, Sherlock would feel apprehensive and anxious. Today, he just wants to be rid of it and sleep. "Thank you for calling," he offers, unsure whether it's the right thing to say at this point.
The agent stares back at him mulishly and John mulls over the merits of murdering Mycroft in his sleep if or when he actually makes it back to England. Pushing that faintly heart-warming though aside, he casts his thoughts about, looking for a solution before landing on the obvious (
"Lead on-call now, and back-up from nine onwards for the trainee I complained about to you just last week. I'll have to stick around overnight in case I need to take over a case from him. Again, I might add. Better pray for a quiet night."
Rosie nods, but her crayon doesn’t pause in its vigorous colouring. Sherlock raises an eyebrow, leaning over to see it more clearly. It isn’t an assignment he recognises.
“I’m not saying anything I didn’t say earlier. I told you that I need you to come to Ireland with me to dismantle the remains of Moriarty’s network. It’s you who is not saying anything sensible in return.”
Poking at the send icon, I don't wait to see that it's gone before I shove the phone back into my pocket, slip my gloves back on and race to catch up with the rest of the group.
John takes a deep breath. "I love you. That means I want to support you in what you want to do in your career. It also means that I worry about you biting off more than you can chew and stressing out over trying to do too much. You set such high standards for yourself that you can stretch yourself too thin, trying to achieve things that most people wouldn't even attempt to do. And when you don't meet those standards, it upsets you. I love you too much to enjoy seeing you stressed, tired and upset."
. Little did Violet Holmes know how apt he now, as an adult, would consider that description of the physical manifestations of anxiety.
In the end, it hadn’t taken too much to track down Jim’s new bolt hole. Never one for subtlety over flair—Jim had booked the premier suite in the name of Mycroft Holmes. A bit more digging through the back end of the Shangri-La Hotel’s booking system showed that it had been paid for in advance—three nights, via banker's draft. The trail that Jim is leaving to implicate Holmes the elder is inspired.
John can see the steps on the left, as the message had described. At the bottom of them, he stops and catches his breath. He listens hard, trying to hear what his eyes can’t see. Who will he find at the top? He can see tall, wind-bedraggled pine trees at the top; a collection of holly bushes screens the area to the right, beyond the wooden handrail.
Head tilted, Jim slowly brings a hand up to Carlton’s face. Carlton is still watching him all wide-eyed, but the instant the back of Jim’s fingers brush gently against his cheek, the boy’s eyes slide shut and he leans into the touch.
was a bigger demonstration of his dedication,loyalty, and caring than what he'd done to himself with the smack and the coke and the homecooked crystal meth to get John to help him.
She does come to his aid. "I apologise, Violet, if that is your experience so far — it is very much not the intention here. Quite the contrary; this is a safe space, a neutral ground on which to discuss things about which the two of you have found it difficult to communicate before."
Edgar, looking apologetic, raises a hand to interrupt him. "You don't have to apologise for him. I've worked with people who take advantage of their employees' willingness for self-sacrifice, with only some vague promise of a good reference as the carrot. I have moved past that stage in my career. My contract at the agency allows me to decline a placement for any reason, at any time. I wouldn't offer my services to Sherlock unless I was willing to give it my best, and if I didn't think we could form a mutually beneficial partnership."
If Moriarty wanted to bring a plane down without a bomb, to stop every system on the plane from working, how could he have done it? Even the black box had somehow been wiped clean, something that the Federal Aviation Administration in the USA says cannot be done.
The euphoric rush is spinning his mind off in a dozen different directions. Why would Mycroft would ever tolerate something like blackmail, let alone put up with it for decades? Sherlock has no illusions about his brother. The man is perfectly capable of ruthlessness, and has been deploying it on behalf of Queen and Country for decades. So, what could be stopping him from taking whatever action is needed to end this crime?
Pouring yourself two fingers of whisky and sitting down, you raise your glass in a toast to the empty chair across from you, announcing "To absent friends, a two-fingered salute."
"Trust what you know," Violet tells the younger woman. "If you don't think it would be any good for — Julie, wasn't it? — to be in a place like that, then nobody gets to tell you otherwise. A mother just
Sebastian is no fool. Mycroft Holmes could well have put security cameras into 221 as a way of protecting his baby brother. Better not to take any risks, Sebastian does a sweep to find there is nothing on the ground floor, but a faint ping from something upstairs. He will have to take preventative measures once he gets in.
John’s smile was soft as he watched Rosie nod at something Sherlock had said, then snuggle her head under his chin. Her eyes found John and she relaxed fully in Sherlock’s hold.
Sherlock shakes his head. "We had some beer. More alcohol might interfere with what John has in mind for the rest of our evening."
Since returning from Malosa, Sherlock has had to share an office with a gastric surgeon who Sherlock has nicknamed
He knows he will eventually have to turn the taps off and get out before the hot water runs out. But it's still only three in the morning and he just can't stomach the idea of going back to bed … back to that cold, musty, empty room. Back to that dream. He screws his eyes tightly closed and tries to erase the image.
"I don't know and he wouldn't say. It’s one of the reasons why I took it from him." He's feeling overly defensive now and he knows it's starting to show.
His tone is bitter. He finds Edgar's presence slightly annoying on principle tonight. His need for such a person in his life in annoying, especially since he has just received a very stinging reminder of that need. Most of all, he is annoyed with
They both stare at each other for a moment, Mycroft’s eyebrows raised in mock question and Sherlock’s narrowed in annoyance. Then, Sherlock breaks the impasse by laughing.
Eventually, just as the sunlight is turning golden and streaming in low between the buildings across the street, the bedroom door creaks open and soft, barefoot steps begin approaching. Swaying slightly in the entrance between the kitchen and the sitting room, Sherlock pauses to yawn and run his fingers through his sleep-mussed hair that's sticking in all directions. A rosy tint on his cheekbones has brought a dash to colour to the dull pallor of his skin is complimented by fever-bright, tired eyes. Wordlessly he takes in the sight and makes his way to the sofa, sinking bonelessly onto it next to John who abandons his computer and leans back. He shifts to the left side on the seat so that Sherlock can pull his legs up onto it and straighten them as he scoots closer to John, leaning against him as though sitting in a deck chair. His head lolls onto John's shoulder, and he whines something incomprehensible as he buries his face between John's neck and the backrest.
John swallows the tiny remnant of ice cube. “Trust me, it’s still hot enough to cauterize what’s left of my tongue. I think I’ll give it a few minutes.”
Their transport is idling at the kerb; it turns out to be one of Uber's so-called black fleet, meaning drivers with slightly fancier cars. Sherlock seems to have taken to the service to which Edgar had introduced him; he doesn't have to argue over price or talk to the driver even as much as one has to converse with a cab driver. And it's still cheaper than booked cab services.
Once that's done, Sherlock eventually — and I am using the word 'eventually' in a rather charitable manner — Sherlock falls asleep. For a while, I think he is feigning, but when he lets out a snore that I recognise from his days in the halo, I know he's truly succumbed. He really does hate to sleep on his back but, as long as his legs and chest need to be elevated, this noise is going to be the norm again. At the chalet, the bedroom cabinet is full of extra bedding, but that isn't the case at home, so I start counting the numbers of pillows at Baker Street and wonder how I can stack them up to mimic the correct angles.
Pichler glances at the wall clock. "There are risks, too, in trying to pretend change doesn't happen. I don't want to sound like I'm attempting to convince you to take this job, but I will give you some food for thought: yes, there is a possibility of severe difficulties with communication in leadership for you, but are you allowing your diagnosis to discourage you when there is no tangible data to prove you would inevitably fail in this position? This job sounds like something you get to choose, rather than having it foisted on you. We will discuss it further next time, see where your thinking is then regarding the potential hazards. Have you spoken to John about this offer?"
“He didn't act like a man who expected his orders to be obeyed,” she said to Lestrade as they watched the two men walk away, hand-in-hand. “He acted like a man who knew they would be.”
The revelation comes to him in a flash. The only person who has been successfully groomed has been Mycroft. Moriarty now holds in his hands, Mycroft's carefully cultivated reputation and entire career. To destroy him, all Moriarty needs to do is make clear that his crimes have been committed while Mycroft
“I told you why I had to do that alone. And now that it isn't necessary anymore, you can come with me. We can do this together.”
From there it's a short journey out the flat's door, into the hallway and up the stairs to 221B. He makes his ascent cautiously, aware that Watson is less likely to be as heavy a sleeper. When one of the steps starts to creak under his footfall, he freezes. Damn these old houses and their built-in antique alarm systems! Standing absolutely still for almost five minutes, he hears nothing, no movement in response to the sound, so he continues on up.
"Ireland, yes," he agrees. He would probably agree with anything I said right now. "Um, yes, I'll have to work out what I am going to do while you are away."
John suppresses a smile as the phrase ‘Chinese chicken soup’ pops into his head. “I don’t have a cold.”
The Prime Minister is frowning. "So, is this man Moran still on our side or has he gone native? What is he to Moriarty?”
As his cab negotiates Friday night London traffic towards Baker Street, Sherlock places a call to John without even checking how late the hour is.
Trapped by a motionless Sherlock, Defratis takes his free leg and rubs his foot up Sherlock's leg. It's a highly suggestive, erotic gesture that leaves little to the imagination.
Emma looks miserable. "I can't change the way people will treat her what they assume she is like when they hear the word autistic. When Joe says things like that… sometimes I wish… sometimes I wish I hadn't had her, for both our sakes." She bursts into tears.
“Do you remember, that day in the lab,” she asked softly as she turned her attention to pouring the tea.
Luckily, we don't have to wait for long; the American starts shouting, "I can see a patrol guy; they wear orange, yeah? Coming down like a bat out of hell, and he's got a monster backpack on."
John nodded agreement, then caught Sally's gaze and nodded again. The gesture was both the acknowledgment of a commanding officer for a job well done, and a expression of thanks.
COBRA—Cabinet Office Briefing Room A. No filming, no notes, no advisers sitting off to the side, or Hansard recorders watching the proceedings from behind glass with headphones over their ears. Just Mycroft and the heads of the three intelligence services, the Prime Minister and Lady Elizabeth Smallwood, his Special Adviser on security matters. The Permanent Secretary, Sir Edgar Laithwaite is also in attendance. Mycroft takes no comfort from the fact that all six of them are sitting opposite him.
“What about my gun?” John’s voice sounds frantic to his own ears. “Did he at least take my gun with him?”
"I want him to be present for this. There may be a need for note-taking, and he needs to be aware of the outcome of this meeting."
go to work. And not the co-codamol, either, if he finds it and of course he bloody will. I keep some in the house for my shoulder, but it's best if he steers clear of that." John doesn't volunteer an explanation of why. A former drug user and a prodrug that gets metabolised into morphine is not a good combination.
Sherlock scoffs, "Hardly. He could have sent me a text; he knows my number, didn’t need to put himself on every phone and television in London and New York. Anyway, as I said,
Sherlock mulls on the last part of that statement. Is that not precisely what he is looking for as well — a chance to challenge himself intellectually? "You don't have to try so hard to convince me you want this position. What you need to do is prove your usefulness, and so far, I have no complaints."
Holmes grabs one of the heavy teak chairs and heaves it into the glass. Sebastian is outraged to see it explode on impact, countless tiny glass shards pouring to the ground like a waterfall. Whatever the hell Holmes had used in the wad had been stronger than a bullet, possibly Semtex, Sebastian guesses. Now the sound of the burglar alarm adds its noise to the smoke and fire alarms.
"Is this how it's going to be, then?" Violet asks. She sounds resigned. "That my interest is never welcome?"
Halfway through, the structure becomes visible; you can see it. Five, then seven, then five. It makes you curious. Is it the same in Japanese? Do their versions of haiku rhyme? Can a translator ever really match the sense of what the poet intended? The Japanese syllables would be quite different from the English ones, making it even harder to translate. You wonder whether something is lost in translation.
She huffs. "Only my pride. This is all for show; he wants you to open this package. Silly man; I told him I'd give you the package. He didn't need to do all this. Told me to tell you that there's nothing explosive in it, but you'd understand."
"How was the conference?" John asks. He knows Greg's pile of paperwork growing is probably the result of having spent three days at a neurosurgical convention.
"I'm not saying they are discussing your diagnosis behind your back, Sherlock," she hastens to add. "That's the paranoia talking which we've established can easily tie you up in anxious knots quite needlessly. People talk, and physicians are no different. Look at it this way: asking your family friend to approach you means that they are doing a lot of work to approach you in the right way  and that they want to be sensitive about things that make you different."
He says a quick "wait for me to call you" to Simone, and we run to the parking area. As he fires up the sleek snow mobile, I dash over to Philippe and throw open the door to the SUV. "Avalanche! I think Sherlock is up there. I'm going to see. Call Mister Holmes at the Chalet, and wait here. I'll call when I know more."
In contrast, what Sherlock tacks on to his doctor persona are his worst qualities. His best ones, it appears, are reserved almost solely for John at home.
He'd looked up with those startling eyes of his, taking their silver colour from the whiteness all about him. "
“I am not! I do not! Oh… I am soft though, aren’t I?” She reaches up to pet her own wild curls, grinning. “But I would like a walk. Can we please?” Her blue eyes look pleadingly up at him, yellow crayon dangling from her hand. She looks so much like her dad in that moment that he blinks, momentarily jarred.
"Wait up," John complains after him. He's not as quick as he normally is, and Sherlock's longer legs always force John to jog after him even when his knee isn't busted.
the lecture had continued. Sebastian is getting a kick out of being able to spy on his former boss and deduce his state of mind.
"My task is to keep this dialogue on a constructive plane," the psychiatrist continues, directing her words at Violet. "You aren't being asked to justify anything you did or didn't do when you were raising him. For Sherlock's sake — for the continuing success of this therapy — it is important to establish ways for the two of you to communicate not just about the past, but also about the present and the future. He asked you to join a session here with me because he thinks your relationship is important to him —important enough to warrant working on so it is more satisfying for you both. Does that sound reasonable to you?"
Then, his eyes had scanned the mantelpiece and narrowed at the empty space on the left-hand side. “What’s happened to my skull?”
"Why wouldn't it be?  I still impose on him when I ask his advice, but at least he's under no obligation to solve my problems. He's not responsible for anything other than giving me advice. That's new."
John huffs and shakes his head. "I’m going to see to it that Mrs Hudson is comfortable." He turns and walks back indoors.
After the extreme challenges of the Phantom couloir, all of us seem happy to take it easier. In the sun, now, I make long, lazy arcs, enjoying the feel of powder again. The looseness of it makes me feel as if I am flying six inches off the ground. As the adrenaline from the couloir eases, I start to get more adventurous. Instead of avoiding the bumps and small hills, I'm tempted into going up and over, tucking my knees up to shake free the powder, knowing that I will land on what can only be described as a plush trampoline. There is an exquisite bounce and give that adds even more to the experience.
John pointedly refuses to sit in the chair opposite. He slaps down the newspaper on the low table in front of Mycroft. "Tell me this isn't Moriarty."
"And there's the fact that I can't be the keeper of your calendar anymore, or your work crisis negotiator — or your chauffeur," John adds.
"People — you, specifically — don't often react to hypotheticals in such a sudden and intense manner. You were lost in thought,
Her hand had lingered a moment longer and then she had taken it away, allowing him to signal to the bartender for another drink.
She insists on sticking by his side so that when they re-enter the court, all eyes are on them. Mycroft takes one look and rolls his eyes, as if John had just confirmed his worst expectations. The effect of his entrance on Moriarty is different. After a quick glance at the visible damage to John's face, he turns to glower at Moran. There’s a flash of dark anger in that look, and John sees Moran's jaw clench. Despite Sherlock’s many proclamations, John is not a complete idiot and he’s aware of the strange dynamic that exists between the two men. And he does not give a damn about the consequences which he suspects will be coming Moran’s way as a result. If Moriarty wants to play the injured party, then losing control of his man could build some sympathy for John's point that he's a criminal.
Sherlock had hoped that John would be supportive of his idea to investigate the concierge idea as a way to help make the offer more palatable, but John turns out to be resistant. Sherlock introduces the concept in a circumspect way, saying he's considering hiring a personal assistant.
John stopped and looked back at Sherlock — his partner, the other-half-to-his-whole. His eyes stung as he looked at him properly for the first time. He was freshly shaven, and had had a recent haircut, but John could see lines in the corners of his eyes that hadn’t been there two years prior, dark circles that betrayed even more sleepless nights than usual, and a hunch to his posture that spoke of pain and suffering. And here he was, apologising to John because his pathetic replacement turned out to be a wanted assassin. John swallowed down another hysterical chuckle that threatened to erupt and instead held out his arms.
"Not up to them," Sherlock mutters. "They destroyed my jacket and didn't even ask for consent when they drilled in that barbaric thing. If I get osteomyelitis from it––"
"Depends on what happens with the interview with this person. They're sending him round soon. If I think it could work to take some of that stuff off my agenda, then yes, I do want to try. If I wasn't prepared to try things that are demanding, then I never would have taken up medicine, never become a surgeon, and never even attempted to love you and marry you. So far, I've managed. Let's see this person first who they think could be a good fit. I don't have to tell GOSH my decision for another week. "
That possibility, however, is shut down as Moran abruptly changes tack, pulling a syringe out of his pocket and uncapping the needle. "You must be feeling the effects of withdrawal. Two hefty doses of opiates in the space of twelve hours … enough to push you into relapse. All those neurotransmitters screaming at you right now."
"Can you tell us something about the state of his relationships? Was he having difficulties that could have been triggering?"
Still, Holmes being alive is a pain. It makes Sebastian feel insecure. Whatever Holmes has got in mind, the thrown glove had a message inside which Sebastian has yet to deliver to Jim. Given that Holmes wants Jim to meet with him, Sebastian has an urge to make that appointment himself, be there ahead of time and use his sniper's skills to bring Jim a dead body.
Next in are a couple whom Sebastian presumes to be the 'medical experts'. An older woman in her fifties and a younger man, thirtyish. Their familiarity with their surroundings and their relaxed demeanor, chatting easily in a room reserved for discussions of death, suggests that they have done this many times before.
My phone is out of my pocket while the cloud of white is still billowing. I hit re-dial last number and wait.
I was scared as I watched that mass of snow moving down the slope, but it must have been much, much worse for him. I'm still scared because residual fear doesn't disappear in an instant. How does he feel right now, really? Even when calm with his full wits about him, communicating his feelings is difficult for Sherlock.
I really try not to be the clichéd anxious spouse, wringing my hands every time he goes off to do something on his own. I know that it gets on Sherlock's nerves, and I'm aware of how fine a line there is between wanting him to be safe and being too protective. I swear that some of his recreations of choice are designed to test the boundaries of what he can physically survive, and I can mentally handle. I tell myself that I would worry in any case and try to stare him down when he protests that I shouldn't, quote, '
John sighs. "It's not my place, Greg. I've tried to point out that it would mean he'd be taking on too much, but… you know how self-willed he can be."
“Thank you. Mister Anderson, you have prepared a report, which I understand you have with you, and I will be referring to parts of that and the report compiled by Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade whom we will hear from later in the day. May we turn, then, to the basic facts of the investigation; On November 3rd of this year, the Southwark police department received a call from a Mister Mark Hughes, a worker at the Old Operating Theatre Museum, that a large volume of what appeared to be blood had been found in a location identified as the Old Operating Theatre, a restored medical facility located inside the attic of the early eighteenth-century church of the old St Thomas' Hospital. Upon arrival, the local police constable confirmed that the substance was indeed blood and contacted New Scotland Yard.”
He's got a frightful headache. The stimulants and cocaine he'd consumed today may have helped him to the brink of a breakthrough, but it's been at a cost. Stretched out on the sofa, ignoring Mrs Hudson's tuts and grumbles about the "state of this place", he'd spent the afternoon topping up the cocaine with Purple Wave.
Lady Smallwood leaves Baker Street at nine pm, and at 9.15, Sherlock is on the phone. During one of the pauses in the endless meal at John and Mary’s wedding, he had found out from Janine that she worked in media — PA to none other than Charles Augustus Magnussen. Having stored that nugget in his Mind Palace, then been distracted by having to give his best man speech, he gave it no further thought. Well, he did have not one but three cases to solve before the dancing started — the Mayfly Man, the Bloody Grenadier and then the attempted murder of Major Sholto.
"He killed himself rather than live with his exposure as a failure. He did it to protect an older brother … whatever the consequences were for you." It's a deliberate provocation and runs counter to Sherlock’s chances of getting out of this situation in one piece. But that was never the plan — getting out.
