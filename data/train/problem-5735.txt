Tony runs his tongue over the seam of his lips. “He’s having an affair,” he says, woodenly, keeping his voice hushed enough that the kids won’t hear.
He drives along the street until he spots the car he remembers from the security camera footage, and Tony’s stomach begins to flutter, anxiety clamping around his body like a vice.
“Wanda could’ve died because of us,” he tells him, something wringing and twisting in his chest. “She got hurt
Steve waits a while before answering. “I need something that belonged to your father, one of the pieces that he collected.”
, Steve has him a chokehold and then, he’s snapping the HYDRA agent’s neck like a toothpick and letting his dead body fall to the ground with a loud, painful-sounding thump.
It’s effectively a dismissal, and Caroline takes it as such, slinking away, her hands folded in front of her.
He sidesteps Grant’s body; he doesn’t feel anything towards the dead man anymore – he feels righteous, relieved that he’s dead; there is no guilt in him.
He pops it open, and the sound goes straight to Tony’s cock, as he lets his head tip back. Steve drizzles a decent amount of lube onto his fingers, which he presses between Tony’s thighs, past his perineum, at the furled rim underneath. He pushes insistently, until he feels the muscles flex and part for him.
Peter follows at a more sedate pace, and then, he’s standing in front Steve with his arms outstretched, hope shining across his face. Steve grins and crouches down so that he can lift Peter into his arms as well, on the other side, and hug both of their children to him tight.
In another universe, of course, he stays with his family, with his kids and Steve, and they finish their lunch and they go back home and they watch a movie or they do something else that allows Tony to not talk to Steve; it’s more and more awkwardness, having to deal with Steve’s increasingly judgy eyes or his puppy dog apology, and he then has to navigate the minefield that his marriage has become – a few weeks ago, Steve went about business as normal; he left the house when he pleased, he came home when he pleased, and he didn’t give a shit about what Tony was doing while he wasn’t there, as long as he came home and the kids were in bed and the house wasn’t on fire; now, after one fucking day where Tony lost track of time with a friend, and he was a couple minutes late picking up the kids from school so Steve could get there first, after he found some stupid bracelet on the bathroom sink that he didn’t recognise, he’s looked at Tony like he’s half-expecting him to confess that he was hooking behind Steve’s back while the kids are school and Steve’s at home.
“I had that software we were using back in Cambridge, and as soon as I came back stateside, I tracked the guy down, found him in some hotel room off the freeway, and I bugged his place. He’s not going anywhere, doing anything, without me knowing what he’s doing. Trust me on that. I’d never have come to you after the shit hit the fan, Tony. We have time. I’m just warning you.”
“So, then, why don’t you believe us when we say that we think you’re the most beautiful person we know, both in body and in mind?” James coaxes, his eyes implacable as a glacier.
Most of the time, it is all very innocuous, and Tony finds himself second-guessing his hysteria, his discomfort; after all, Grant is his goodbrother, his alpha’s twin brother.
James’ fist clenches, and he brings it down on the counter. “I’m supposed to stop him, to kill him, so he can’t ever hurt you again, and I’m… I’m failing.” He looks away. “I shouldn’t be failing, not where your life and your family’s life is at stake.”
“I don’t think there is much you can say,” Tony replies. He hesitates. “Does this mean, well, do you believe me?”
“I’d kill him, sweetheart,” he says, almost kindly, but with that unbearable intensity that Tony had always associated with him when he was looking at Tony (it had been so long since Tony had received more than a cursory glance that it’s like crack to him now). “I’d fucking kill him. I don’t think I could live with the idea that you’d let anyone near you, that you’d let someone else touch you like this, have you like this, let someone else into your body. The universe made you for me, baby. They made you for me and me alone, you understand? You could never have this with anyone else. The universe wouldn’t allow it. I need you, I
“Well, they look at you like something new and shiny, because they don’t see you as much. They want everything from you, because they feel like they don’t get much.”
“Tony’s reaction, even if it is exactly what you feared, does not give you the excuse you need to make that decision for him,” Eshe says, simply. “It is up to him to react the way that he does, and even if that reaction is not what you want, you don’t get to
A scream echoes from the speaker, and the fear is bright and sharp in Tony’s chest, as his head snaps up.
“I did like the gnocchi,” Steve says, wistfully. Then, his face cracks open in a soft, toothy smile. “Okay, baby, let’s get some pasta in you,” he says, wrapping his arm around Tony’s shoulders, dragging him in close.
“One, two, Obie’s coming for you?” Steve lifts an eyebrow. “No, Tony. I don’t know what happened to Pepper. I really don’t. Maybe,” he sighs, “maybe Natasha had a blackout or something, but…” he trails off. “If you’re trying to suggest that some evil guy from a nightmare killed Pepper in her sleep, and she actually died in real life, then, no, I don’t believe that. I don’t think that’s possible.”
The sheets are still a little sweaty from their earlier romp, and when she throws one of her legs over his, he can feel his come, sticky against the insides of her thighs.
He thinks of Maushmi, sweet, bold Maushmi, strapped to a table, chained to a bed, and the desire to destroy something raises its ugly head within him, beats to life in his chest, and God, he can’t imagine what it was like for Natasha, to go through something like that.
Grant will wait until the moon is high in the sky before coming to him, so Tony prepares himself. He readies the bed and the curtains, drains the wine in the flask in his room, and he prays.
“You will have to be prepared for that eventuality. Polyamory is a difficult bone to swallow for a lot of people,” Eshe warns, gently. “It’s… it goes against preconceived notions of what relationships look like, and a lot of people take time to come to terms with whether they’re okay with such a relationship, whether they’re prepared to split their feelings and their responsibilities like that, whether they’re capable of the kind of extensive communication these relationships require. James might be one of those people that baulks at the idea of three men being in a relationship. It might take him time, and it isn’t helped by the fact that he doesn’t remember much from his life before HYDRA took him. He has those things to sort out, the abuse, the torture, the brainwashing, the conditioning, the things they forced him into. Has he started seeing someone to talk these things out?”
“And I hate that, I hate that you lied to me. I hate that you didn’t think much of me, and I hate that you’re using that as a fucking excuse to justify you lying to me for
Don’t get him wrong, Tony loves his children, loves them more than sharks love blood, and there isn’t anything in this world that he wouldn’t do for them, but it’s hard, it’s hard being frankly a single parent to two children that are too much like him to have an easy life.
“No, no, I mean, I haven’t talked about it with them yet, but I’m sure they wouldn’t want to adopt you if they wouldn’t want you to call them
Tony shrugs. “That’s one way to look at it, I suppose,” he says, self-deprecatingly. He looks at the watch. “I should get going,” he says, his voice mournful. “The kids… I have to pick them up from school.”
, and then, regret floods through his body, leaving him limp and trembling and generally feeling like a dick.
Natasha shrugs. “You’re my friend’s husband. I’m your husband’s friend. That seems reason enough,” she offers.
“Rogers, you’re in no condition,” Natasha declares, happy to be the bad guy if Tony can’t quite get the words out.
“Doesn’t sound like it. In fact, it sounds like you are still making decisions for me instead of asking what
“No, Tony, I don’t need to because I already know what’s in there!” Howard roars right back, stunning Tony into silence.
James says his name in a way that makes Tony feel two inches tall, like he’s completely and utterly pathetic.
The man chuckles, sneering, and shaking his head. “Americans! You’re all alike. Herr Stark, I’ll show you what I’m used to.”
Tony takes a deep breath so that no one sees how terrified he is, because there are new arrivals in the doorway to the tent, Zola, the Nazi that burned down Tony’s bar, who is a black leather case. He steps forward and smiles at Tony.
“Still, we’re in this together, and it can’t just be my drama,” Tony mutters, squeezing his arms around him.
“Look, to be honest, before any of this becomes an issue, I think James is still in a position where he’s coming to terms with his past,” she says, honestly. “It is probably not a good idea for him to be in a relationship yet, and I’m not even sure if you’ve had the polyamory discussion
The door swings open, and Howard and Maria are standing there, along with Sarah, who’s wringing her hands together.
could pick them up. Does that sound like two kids who don’t think the world rises and sets with you? Because I can assure you, you are their whole world. They
“She… she was practically screaming into the phone; she was so upset, and she told me that there were men in the house, that they wanted the kids. She was so upset, she was crying,” Tony recalls in a flat, gravelly voice, and when he looks at Sam, he has tears in his eyes, the muscle in his jaw jumping, like it’s physically hurting to hear this. “And then, there was a scream, and the phone went dead, and I ran, I ran like hell to the car, broke a bunch of traffic laws, and when we got there, Steve, James and me, she was on the floor, she was bleeding, and the kids were nowhere to be found. We called the ambulance, and then, we called you, and I’m sorry, I know we should have stayed and it killed me to leave her, it really did. It really fucking did, but-”
“Take this transponder,” she says, all business. “Activate it when you’re ready, and the signal will lead us right to you.”
, like I wasn’t good enough for that part of your life, that you didn’t want me around it because I cramped your style or something, and I hated myself over it.”
He eases a hand up his side, the heat of his palm bleeding through his skin and Tony’s clothes, so that his entire body lights up with it.
Steve pales in a rush, his mouth hovering over the rim of his wine glass. “Uh, Nat? Sure, of course, I have,” he says, quickly, his shoulders setting in a defensive slant.
And then, Steve falls beside him, and Tony splays his hand over his own chest, against which he can feel his heart pumping erratically. He tries to slow his breathing, but it’s still some time before he thinks he can get enough air in his lungs.
Tony leans back in his chair and lets the edge of his foot climb up the inside of Steve’s leg. “Well, it’s working,” he says, a little breathless.
Grant snorts. “My brother, who has everything, love and stature and loyalty and wealth, when I, for the crime of having been born sheer minutes after him, must wait for scraps,” he says, venomously. “He doesn’t deserve you. He doesn’t deserve all that he has. He doesn’t treat you the way you deserve to be treated. Tell me, Tony, doesn’t he disappoint you at all? He travelled all the way from Brooklyn to your home to
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, his voice and eyes wet, as his head sways forward, his forehead knocking against Tony’s. “I’m so fucking sorry, Tony. I really fucked up, didn’t I?”
, and what, this sudden desire to lose yourself in me, that came out of the blew, did it? That was just spontaneous, was it? Bullshit,” he spits. “
“Yeah, that’s what I thought,” Steve says, darkly, and then, starts filling him again, deeper, rougher, pounding into him without any finesse.
He feels the need to say that again and wonders why he has to keep justifying that part of the story, constantly, and maybe, there is something happening, something that he doesn’t want to acknowledge, even though he hasn’t touched James, wouldn’t touch James.
Sam takes a deep, steadying breath. “Yeah. Yeah, I knew,” he says, after a moment, briefly closing his eyes.
He can be that omega, the bold one, the reckless one, the one that sheds tradition and convention, the one that defies the disdain of society.
Tony pushes on. “Her body bag was in the hall, and I followed it, followed it down into this boiler room, like the ones you have in those old tankers, and I went down there. There were all these pipes, and they were going off, and I… he was there.”
home. I’ve dropped the shield. It’s Sam’s now. Bucky… Bucky will do just fine without me. So will you. So will the Avengers. I’ll still be around, but I… I can’t be Captain America anymore. There’s… there’s just not enough of me to be Captain America. I hope you can respect that.”
Tony runs up the stairs in a blind panic towards his wing of the manor. He darts into his rooms, slamming the door and locking it. He presses his ear to the door, trying to hear if the killer is coming up this way or not.
“No, no, you don’t have to do this. I’ll go away. I’ll move away, go to a different fucking continent or something. I’ll never talk to her ever again,” Stone insists, tears in his eyes as he realises that the end is approaching.
He pulls out of James’ arms, feeling suddenly cold by the loss of his warmth, and it’s a dark, acid chill that envelops his body, as if he’s lost something, lost something that made him whole.
“Steve,” Eshe says, sternly. “That’s not fair. Tony is entitled to his emotions, even if they’re not something you would agree with.”
He runs his hands through his hair, fisting in the strands, and ducking out from underneath his arm. He rounds on him in a quick beat.
She’s fierce and unapologetic and stern in a comforting way, and she sits there lets Tony go first, lets him spill out all of his guts onto the floor.
“Wow,” Tony’s face flushes with colour, “well, thank you for saying that. You made me feel a whole lot better about myself. So… Rhodey told you to stay away from me?” he clarifies.
Tony whistles. “He definitely wants to fight in this war. Paramus, New Haven, Scranton, Vineland, Springfield,” he muses, staring at the various 4Fs that litter the file. “He definitely wants to kill Nazis?”
Tony wonders if that’s just charisma, if that’s just how it is, if his hard work and his hungry, desperate urge to be worth a hundred of the father that Howard Stark was will inevitably amount to nothing in the face of Steve’s charisma.
He lifts his arm and stares at the spot he’d just rubbed – the burn is there, the burn from the smouldering pipe, around the size and shape of a dollar coin.
Maybe it’s because she has no dog in this fight, because he’s not afraid of her motives, because she, when she talks, twisting strings from high above. She’s just saying as it is.
at the idea of anyone, let alone fucking HYDRA, putting their hands on his kids, on his babies, the reasons for his existence.
my marriage. I don’t give a shit how good your intentions were. You had no business setting up that powder keg.”
Tony takes a deep, steadying breath. “I’m Jewish,” he blurts out, wringing his hands together. “On my father’s side. It’s not something… it’s not something that I am very open about. Things aren't great for us here either. I’m not… I don’t practice, I’m Hindu, I practice Hinduism. It’s a lot easier to hide than my colour, which I inherited from my bearer, but yes, I am Jewish.” He looks away. “It is very difficult,” he says, carefully. “Living here, hearing the things that are happening across the sea to people like me,
All of the soldiers stop to stare at him, watching him with hungry eyes, and Tony continues walking, confidence in his step.
was death. I was hurting people, and I was calling it justice, and you smiled at me like I was the fucking hero. And I loved that you looked at me like that. And then, I started to love you, because you were so kind, so smart, and you didn’t flinch, you were so fucking brave. And you were still looking at me like that, even after I told you what I was, what I’d done. And then, when it was all done, when HYDRA wasn’t going to fucking poison Massachusetts, I thought about taking you with me when I found out about another HYDRA base in Argentina. I thought about stealing you from MIT and never letting you go. And then, I thought, I
“You’re a beta. Being an omega is very different. It means understanding that in matters of chastity, fidelity, basically anything that an omega does with that place between their legs, is always doubted. We are incapable of telling the truth. If I had told you what Grant was doing to me, what would you have done?”
He hears a woman’s soft purr on the other side, and he feels that dreadful pang in his chest, because that is Natasha Romanoff’s voice, saying, “you need to get here as soon as possible, Steve.”
“Lost the unfulfilled feeling that I had in college,” Tony tells him, sincerely. “I know that’s really fucking sick, because I’m married and I have kids, and I love them, I do, I really fucking do, but I… I don’t know, I guess, I wanted more, I wanted the excitement like I had back in college when I was helping him, and I… I’d gotten so into my life like this, you know. It was just a long line of making nutritious lunches and helping with fractions homework and writing code for the new StarkPhone and signing mountains of paperwork in my spare time. And I guess…” he takes a deep breath, a breath that rattles in his chest, “I guess that isn’t enough for me anymore, and it makes me feel awful, because I do really love my kids, but, yeah, it hasn’t been enough for me for a while, and seeing James again, it really brought all of those feelings back to the front.”
“Then, you have to allow him the dignity of his choice in this relationship, even if it hurts him, even if he leaves. It’s up to Tony to decide whether he’s hurt or angry or forgiving or still madly in love or none of those things and work through it and move on from that. You
“That’s not enough for me,” Steve says, voice sharp around the edges. “That’s sure as hell not enough for Toni, because you’ve done that before, fucked off to Europe, and Toni
“I love you, I love you very much, Stevie. I always have, I always will,” James tells him, solemn and strained.
smiling face, in that ridiculous costume, all red, white and blue, stars and stripes, and a mask with goddamn wings.
Tony chews on his lower lip. “I’m glad, and I’m grateful, so grateful that you were willing to listen to me.”
that movie!” He drags his hand over his face. “After that, it was like Steve was a completely different person. He… there were all these phone calls, you know? Secret phone calls that he’d leave the room to take, and he always spoke in a whisper, like he was scared someone was going to listen in and find out what he was saying. And then, there were all these conferences that he was going.”
“I do, I do love you,” Steve says, with effusive fondness. And his voice is almost awed, when he goes onto say, “and you love me.”
Peter nods. “Uncle Rhodey told me that when people get married, one person gives the other a diamond ring to ask them to marry them.”
Toni narrows her eyes, and then, she turns to the dozen of their friends who are gathered there, and tells them, with a brilliant, rigid smile that is often featured on her Instagram, missing that soft, vaguely flirtatious edge that she uses with Steve and Bucky in private, “give us a second, would you?”
“We’re in a rut; we’ll get through this,” he says, and if he says it enough, maybe he’ll begin to believe it.
, he stresses, and tells her that Natasha and him are often paired up on a mission. He tells Eshe about the necklace incident, how he took Natasha with him to the jewellery store because he knows shit-all about gold and wanted someone else’s opinion before he bought Tony the wrong necklace. His eyes and his voice are heavy when he tells Eshe that Natasha likes to play games, that she knew that Tony and he would be at that restaurant that same night and deliberately came that night, not to cause problems, but to finally meet Tony, because he and Natasha were friends and she wanted to know what he was hiding, these parts of his life that he never allowed to touch. He tells her that all of those secret phone calls were about missions, that he’s never touched Natasha except for a fake kiss on an op that happened long before he and Tony got together, that he doesn’t love her as anything more than a friend, that, yes, he did have conversations about his marriage with her, because frankly, he didn’t have anyone else to talk to, and he’s a coward.
“I guess,” Maushmi says, long-sufferingly, and then, her face twists up. “But he was singing, and it was
She is equally unafraid and terrified, and to see her like this, so quiet, so thoughtful, it pains him, makes his chest crack wide open, because he wonders whether it’s a mistake, whether he’s being selfish, creating this situation for his children that is so confusing and so new and there are no right answers, no roadmaps, no directions, and expecting them to deal with it and to be okay with it and to grow up as functional human beings, even if he does things like this.
“You want trust, give some,” Tony says, his voice low, dangerous. “I want to see the money before you walk out of here.”
But Steve is Tony’s husband, and Rhodey and Tony loved each other like brothers, and Pepper was Tony’s greatest friend, so, between the four of them, they light the pyre.
When the show is done, Tony waits in the crowd wanting to meet the bright and shining Captain America. He peeks through the throngs of people just in time for a camera to snap a photo of Steve holding a crying baby. And then, the baby is pulled from his arms and replaced with another baby.
He slips the lingerie off his shoulders, slowly, making sure that Steve can see the swell of his pectorals, the curve of his hips, as it falls to the ground, pooling around his feet, before he’s stepping out of it and kicking it under the bed.
“Yeah? You that desperate for my cock, sweetheart?” Steve asks, digging his thumbs into the divots at the base of Tony’s spine.
Steve cracks a smile and kisses him, softly. “I believe in you, me, and Trump out of the White House.”
“If you had come to me today, and you’d told me the truth, that you’d made me out as a mark that night in the bar in Cambridge, and you were using me this whole time to get your hands on SHIELD and what they know, to protect the Winter Soldier, to destroy us from the inside-out, I would have let you go,” Steve says, honestly. “I wouldn’t have done what SHIELD would have wanted me to do in that situation.”
about my type, by the way. Just because TMZ only talked about the supermodels, doesn’t mean that’s the only kind of person that I had sex with. Hell, they had a whole no-homo phase where they wouldn’t talk about all the
“I do. Do not think me unfeeling.” Steve approaches the bed, cautiously. “But you are sitting there, naked, covered in blood, and my brother is dead. Forgive me for thinking that there is more to this story than a cold-blooded, thoughtless murder.”
“He left,” Wanda repeats. “He packed his bags, grabbed them, walked out of the house, and we didn’t speak for a whole week. And then, he called me, he said that things weren’t okay, that I wasn’t okay, and that our fight had just proved it. I was so glad that he was willing to talk to me that I was willing to agree to whatever he said, just to… to keep him in my orbit. I loved him and he was all I had left, and he… if I lost him too, I don’t know whether I would have survived. So, when he said that we had to talk to someone, I agreed, I would have agreed if he told me that he wanted me to jump off a cliff, which in retrospect is very unhealthy.”
Tony kisses him, a little sloppily, a little messily, everything damp, and he slides his fingers between his legs, finding where he’s slick the most, using that to ease the way with Steve’s cock.
“It’s entirely possible,” Ms Lewis says, slowly. “But I meant it more in a way that I don’t think you should be too worried at this stage. He’s young; it’s very likely that Peter will get over his shyness, and even if he doesn’t, it might just be his personality in the end. That’s not a bad thing.”
“The right partner,” he answers. He smiles at Steve and heads out. “I’ll see you later,” he says, deliberately.
“And I offered to help you with the faction that was in HYDRA that you were following. That was the only reason you were in Boston, right? From the beginning to the end. That’s all you cared about.”
He abruptly feels like one of those teenage girls showing up to a school dance in the same dress as someone else, the shame prickling at the back of his neck like he should sneak into the bathroom to change.
“Yeah, kid, it’s me,” Steve says, roughly, still somehow giddy with relief, and his face twists up, as his throat flexes.
That’s when the car door opens violently, Obadiah’s hand thrusts through and yanks him out of the car, dragging him onto the lot, which is now filled with this sort of fog that Tony doesn’t remember from when he parked. Tony shouts, struggling against Obadiah’s grip, before he ends up on his back on the gravel, Obadiah straddling him.
“You know,” Tony stretches out like a cat, watches how Steve and James’ eyes track his every move, drag hot across the entire length of his body.
Phillips picks up a thick sheaf of letters, leafing through the first few. “I’ve signed more condolence letters today than I’d care to count. But the name does sound familiar.” He meets Steve’s eyes. “I’m sorry.”
Steve pokes him in the ribs to make him shriek, and then, somehow, both of them topple off the edge of the couch, and the lube goes
Tony grinds his teeth. “Okay, you have me there,” he admits grudgingly. He smacks Steve on that firm bicep of his. “I can’t believe you were having the same dreams as all of us were and you didn’t fucking say anything.”
Tony smiles, widely, a faux, thin-lipped one. “You know me. I’m always absent-minded, especially when I get into something. I was doing something in the workshop, and I must have lost track of time, so I went to the kitchen to fix myself something to eat, and I guess I just left it in the bathroom.”
Tony looks over, his lungs in his throat, and he can see a sheen of tears in James’ pale eyes. James rubs the heels of his hands over them, sniffling slightly.
“Thank you,” he says, haltingly, in a low, rushed voice, “for the talk, for the… for the tea, for everything. You don’t know what it means for me.”
He closes his eyes, breathes hard and heavy, and fades into the maze of the ship, before making his way to the edge so that he can throw himself into the water.
Finally, he manages to break through the wood, and Tony climbs out, cautious. He’s in the middle of an abandoned cemetery, and he’s barefoot against the dirt which clings to his skin. He starts running, without looking back, passing by gravestones with names on them.
“Alas,” Loki offers him a mock-innocent smile, tilting up his palms in a show of surrender, “I do not believe it possible.”
“I really promise, guys. Nothing could take me away from you,” James murmurs, coming around the other side so that he can take the twins in his arms.
Steve laughs, softly, his face slightly pink. “I can imagine.” He bites his lip. “But what about Agent Carter?”
Peter sighs, long-sufferingly. “I suppose it’s okay. We have Appa. He’s always here.” He waves a dismissive hand.
Natasha looks down at Maushmi, her entire face soft. “He had to work. I’m so sorry. But he sent me with the food you two like to eat? How does that sound?” she asks, her voice brimming with excitement.
“I just wanted to bring you food,” she says, in a small voice, trying to make herself seem smaller than she really is.
His eyes are big and shiny in the light of the twin’s bedroom, and Tony can taste his grief and regret in the air, and something in his chest cracks, floods.
“No, no,” Tony says, roughly. “Fuck me, I want you to film me. And it’s the StarkPhone, right? The one that I gave you. It should be safe; no one’s going to be able to hack you.”
“So, I’m just going to come out here and ask you, because I don’t like you and I don’t feel like giving you my A-game of manipulation: what did you do to Steve?”
don’t take this seriously?” Steve demands. “You didn’t,” his voice cracks, “you didn’t see them, you didn’t see her, you didn’t hear that, you have no right,
Tony climbs onto the main deck of the Nazi ship, and then, suddenly, water is washing over his feet. Quickly, he realizes that the ship is beginning to submerge. He runs through quickly deepening water toward the haven of the conning tower. Halfway there, he slips and goes down. He manages to grab the base of the mast-aft light, stopping him from being swept away. He struggles to his feet and sloshes through knee-deep water to the base of the conning tower. Tony climbs the ladder to the bridge of the conning tower and looks down, the water rising toward him fast.
“The gun was-” Steve fists his hands in his hair. “I don’t know what the fuck I was thinking,” he says, all the venom in his voice directed at himself. “I thought… I got the photos, and Natasha was really firm, and I got angry. I just… I let the rage overtake me, and I grabbed the gun, after Natasha reminded me what I had to do, and I thought…” he chews on his lower lip. “I thought I could be cold enough to do it, to kill you, and Natasha said, she said that she thought he’d come after you, that he genuinely had feelings for you, that he would follow you home, and it might end up in a fight between him and me, and that I had to be prepared to kill him too.”
“Tony, wait,” Steve says, his voice building into a protest, reaching for his hand, but he misses Tony’s fingers just by the width of a hair.
“Neither have I.” Steve’s blush deepens. “As in, I’ve never been with an omega, not that I’ve never been with an alpha–”
They are not ending over this; he is not losing Steve or James over this; he is not losing his children over this.
this; he wants to learn ballet, and if he’s showing interest, he should. Actually, ballet’s pretty good in terms of physical acuity. I could teach him and Mouse to fight as they grow older, and the ballet will make them quick and flexible.” He shakes his head, as if he were going off track. “But it’ll be good for him because he’ll start to learn how to stand up for something that he believes in, that people won’t always likes the choices he makes but he’s gotta stick by ‘em if he wants people to take him seriously.”
Steve looks at him, without flinching. “Natasha raised the unfortunate possibility that maybe, you weren’t… you weren’t being completely honest with me.”
“Why, thank you,” Tony says, dryly, and picks Peter right off Steve’s shoulders, throwing him over his.
Steve nods, and his eyes are dark at the memory, just a pale blue ring around his black, black pupils. “I filmed me fucking you, how your hole wrapped around my cock,” he says, his voice barely a rasp. “How you fucked yourself like I was just a glorified fucking dildo, the only thing that put air in your fucking lungs, how you moaned and sobbed for me, all the filthy things that you let me do to you.”
?” Maushmi asks, long-sufferingly, her brow creased in confusion. “You have a nice bed. It’s really big. I like jumping on it.”
“When… uh, when I met James that first time in his apartment, he asked me to run away with him,” Tony says, shifting in his seat uncomfortably.
Steve finds himself smiling; he remembers the way that Tony melted into the kiss on their wedding day. “Yeah,” he says, softly, the grief, now tinged with nostalgia, lashed all the tighter to his chest, “yeah, we did.”
Tony chews on his lower lip, peering up at the lounge where Peter and Maushmi are seated in front of the television, their eyes peeled as Dora asks them to answer a question.
“You don’t realize what this means,” Tony says, his voice dull, as the panic slowly starts to abate.
Steve sweeps away the last of the glass still clinging to the pane, and the two of them duck inside. It’s a proper preschool classroom, with little desks and little chairs, facing a teacher’s desk, behind which is an old chalkboard on the back wall. Homemade arts-and-crafts decorations smother the bulletin boards.
First, they go to a doctor. Most of Steve’s ailments can now be handled with medication. They get an inhaler for his asthma, all the vaccines that Steve didn’t have previously, blood pressure medication, beta blockers, anticoagulants, pre-diabetic medication. He has to have a couple of procedure, which the doctors recommend to correct issues that can now be fixed instead of taking medication for the rest of his life, like a catheter ablation and a bioprosthetic artificial heart valve that Tony and Bruce make for him.
Tony nods, dazed, something hazy creeping into the edges of his vision. “That was pretty fucking amazing,” he murmurs. “I didn’t even think I could come like that. Hell, I didn’t even think that I was hard.”
Tony watches them with keen interest, and then, Steve enters the hall, collects all of his rations on his tray, and then, takes a seat at his usual table with Tony.
“It was great! Today, we fingerpainted! Look at my fingers, Appa, they’re all blue!” Maushmi shoves her paint-stained fingers into his face.
Steve clears his throat. “I just… I remember it was a little while ago? They had just turned four. And they were playing, and I was at home one day, and I was at the bottom of the stairs. I was watching them, and then, Peter was falling down the stairs, and I… I didn’t know how to react. I was just watching, and then, he was on the ground and crying and he was clutching at his arm, and I didn’t know what to do,” he says, almost stunned by his own reaction. “It was broken, I knew that, but I didn’t… I didn’t know how to react, what to do, and then, Tony was there. JARVIS must have called him – that’s our artificial intelligence, he runs the house – and he was there, and he was just… reacting. He reacted. He swept Peter up into his arms, and Mouse was rushing down and he had Mouse in the other arm, and he was in the car, and I was following like a zombie, and he was comforting Peter and getting him to stop crying and making him laugh, and all I could do is drive. Peter was doing everything else, and he didn’t even stop. He didn’t need to stop. He got us into the emergency room and distracted Peter as the doctor set his arm and gave him the cast and he was the first to write on it, and I was just… useless. I was useless.”
He fists his hand in his hair, searching desperately, and then, the far side of the settlement burns away, revealing Steve, tied spread-eagle between two upright posts.
He picks up the pile of bills, walks up the back of the bar, and pulls a small wooden box from under the bar. He flips open the top, puts the cash inside, and closes the top, leaving the box on the bar and starting back toward the medallion. The front door of the bar bursts open, and four men storm in. Tony, halfway between the box of money and the medallion, and not wishing to draw attention to either, stops where he is.
“I went to James’ place after that. I wanted him to know that I was going to tell Steve everything, and then, I rushed back, and Steve… he had pictures, pictures of James and me meeting each other, and he knew about the Winter Soldier, and he had a gun on the table in front of him.”
“It’s not something that’s going to be solved in one session, so I’m willing to table it for now. But do you accept that Steve considers that you are perfect for him?”
They end up settling for string cheese, and from there, it becomes a competition as to who can peel and eat the quickest.
want it to and for a much better reason than you were just putting to me. If you were okay with being with me this morning, when you looked like a fucking god and I was nothing compared to you, then, I am fine with being with you
Maybe that’s what Steve sees now, when he looks at him, sees the fat on his body, the new person that he is now, instead of the boy that he married.
“Enough wasting time,” he says, firmly. “We need to get back to the battle, or these fucking rabbits are going to get past the perimeter.”
Wanda runs her tongue over the seam between her lips and looks down at her lap, her shoulders hunched as if remembering an old grief.
“–collapsed because I recently got stabbed in the belly by an alien warlord who came to decimate half the universe, and you pissed me off?”
“I’ve never done this before,” he confesses, gnawing on his lower lip. “I’ve never been with an alpha.”
Steve’s thumb smooths over Tony’s lower, plump lip, prying it open. “Such a fucking pretty mouth,” he murmurs. “God, maybe I should come again all over your face, make you wear it so I can catch it on the video, so you remember how much you needed to be stuffed full so you took it both holes.”
“I like beauty,” Tony says, bluntly. “Nothing else, nothing more. You are beautiful.” He sets his teeth on Steve’s lower lip. “Please, Steve–”
to do; it’s because you know what it feels like to have a bad father, and you’d never want your kids to feel like that. You’re a good father, Tony. You’re the best one that they could ever have.”
“No,” Tony says, fiercely. “You absolutely did not do anything wrong. They were mean, evil men, and none of this was your fault. If we…”
He’d felt abominably shameful for it, though, and he’d made a real effort to change, but every now and then, he has the sudden urge to scream out a list of swears.
“Yes, yes, I know, you’re both strapping cuts of beefcake, and I should be worshipping you at your respective altars,” Tony says, sarcastically, “but if you don’t stop eating all the chips in the house, well, then, you’re going to become pudgy, and I’ll stop having sex with you.”
Steve wraps his hand around his cock, fisting himself. His free hand comes to grasp Tony’s hip, fingers finding the groove in Tony’s pelvic bone, squeezing. He leans over him, and Tony shies away from biting down on Steve’s shoulder, the way he might have this morning, just in case he breaks a bone with his teeth.
So, today, when Tony second-guesses himself, his husband, his marriage and this family that he has built painstakingly for himself, he tries to remember that first night, how easily Steve had come to his defence, and forces himself to remember that Steve loves him just as much as he loves Steve, that whatever distractions life may hold, Steve will always come back to him.
Ms Lewis looks uneasy. “Look, I do need it for their portfolio, but I can give you a copy. There’s a photocopier in the anteroom. Give me a moment.”
“We gonna rassle?” Hodge asks, suggestively. “‘Cause I gotta say, you alpha bitches ain’t my type. But that O in the jeep, I could show him a few moves I know he’d like. Shame he’s a brownie though.”
care. I’m not staying like this. This isn’t permanent, Tony. It’s going to be fixed, and everything will be just as it was this morning.” He purses his lips. “Until then, maybe it’s better if we just…” he trails off, like he’s not brave enough
“First of all, I’d really like to clear up this misapprehension, but we’re not sleeping together,” James says, firmly, pointing to himself and Tony in turn.
The fire burns in the background, as Steve manages to get the oven working, adding more wood. The boiler room becomes warm, not too sweltering.
“Yes, I think so. One, a white wedding, which is why I’m looking at these white dresses, and then, an Indian wedding as well. I think we might have both of them at the lake house; how does that sound?”
Steve’s fingers hook in the underwear, dragging it down enough so that he can slip his warm hand inside and curl his fingers around Tony’s cock. Tony gasps, almost seizing in Steve’s grip, nails biting into his shoulder. He corkscrews upward, as Tony lets his head fall onto his shoulder, the palm of Steve’s hand rubbing over the head of his cock, quickly becoming damp with pre-come.
you’re having an affair with Natasha,” Tony grinds out, the humiliation blooming all over his face. “I
A kid in the ground stands up in his seat, pointing at a fake Hitler creeping from the wings, Steve seemingly not noticing.
“You said that you would never lie with me until I was much older than what I was; otherwise you would become such a man.”
“Will you stop shouting?” Tony grinds out, rubbing at his temples. “You might not have realised that I’ve gone through one hell of a fucking night, and my best friend is
Tony flees into his chambers and closes the door, resting his forehead against it, breathing slow and deep.
“I love what you do to me in this bed,” he demurs, staring up at him through the dip of his dark lashes.
Steve makes his way from the stove, pressing his lips quickly to the side of Tony’s head. He lifts Maushmi into his arms, onto his hip, while Peter fits himself neatly against Tony’s legs.
“Thank you,” Tony says, gratitude suffusing his voice, and flees the room, making his way down the stairs and out the door towards the car parked out onto the streets.
“I think Buck’s thinkin’ of proposin’,” Steve offers, sinking down onto the couch. “But make sure you don’t tell anyone because he wants it to be a surprise.”
Tony gave Steve everything, his heart and his body and his mind and everything that forms Tony’s identity, and Steve didn’t care, didn’t care about him, didn’t think he was worth it.
Natasha rubs her hand over her face. “Thank you for hearing me out,” she offers, sincerely. “For what it’s worth, I do feel awful about all the confusion that I caused, and I’m glad that you and Steve were able to work things out.”
“Can’t you just send the others, though?” Toni complains. “I mean, there’s four of them; can’t they handle it? And you have other guys too.”
me,” he says, his voice searing-edged, “we’re here, in the middle of nowhere, all three of us, and our kids, our
He nods, almost desperate and half-wild, with the idea, kneeling in front of Steve, like this, in just a scrap of lace covering his cock, and putting his mouth on Steve’s cock, while Steve sits there, fully dressed, with his hand in Tony’s hair.
Just when Tony thinks everything is fixed, that they can get back on track, it’s almost like he’s taken twelve steps back.
“Because I’m your husband,” Tony says, distraught, the distress a fire in his throat. “Because you’re supposed to trust me, you’re supposed to believe me when I say that I haven’t done anything, that I haven’t cheated on you.” The anger floods his face suddenly. “Because I don’t need your fucking permission to see a friend, Steve. What did you want me to do? Crawl on my hands and knees in front of you and beg for the chance to see this friend of mine, just because you might get jealous? Like I said last night, this sounds like a
But he knows all of it would be over the second he put it out into the universe. Whatever Schrodinger’s existence he had formed for himself since he’d first had that aching, nagging suspicion that Steve and Natasha Romanoff were more than just friends would crumble into dirt.
Maybe, things can be better between them now, he thinks, hardly daring hope. Maybe Steve is ready to leave Natasha behind, give up whatever it is that she gives him. Maybe all that Natasha was a necessary distraction, something to make him realise what he has at home, that Tony loves him, would do anything for him. Maybe she can be a black mark in their history, known to all but never given life or light. Tony can live with that; he can live with the terrible, awful thought of Steve losing himself in someone who isn’t Tony, as long as he comes home to him and never speaks of her again. Tony can forgive that infidelity, as long as it’s not thrown in his face, used to shame him and humiliate him, as Howard did to Maria all the fucking time.
Steve’s hand slides further, where he’s already slick, and he thrusts, thrusts until Tony’s sopping. He pushes Tony’s slacks and underwear down, around his thighs and knees, so that he can push his hips against Tony’s.
“She’s wearing the same necklace that I am, albeit for a woman. It’s Indian gold. I can recognise Indian gold a mile away,” Tony confesses dully.
“I will,” James says, fiercely, looking between the twins. “I won’t ever let them hurt you again, both of you. I promise.”
“You stupid fucking cunt.” Grant’s free hand tugs at the knot of his robe at his waist. “I was hoping that you would come to me. In fact, when I heard the knock on the door, and I saw you on the other side, I thought you’d come to your senses. I thought you’d realised that we could be good together, but clearly you’re just another bitch who doesn’t know his place.”
Steve huffs out a laugh. “This is probably the longest conversation I’ve ever had with one. Omegas aren’t exactly lining up to dance with the alpha they might step on.”
Steve comes with a grunt, gathering Tony to his body for a long, quiet moment, as the shudders rack his body. When Steve withdraws, Tony can feel the come leak out of his body onto the sofa, and he says, a sly edge to his voice, “I think we may have ruined the couch.”
I am,” his voice is acid with self-hatred, “but I forgot, just for a night, and the next morning, I left, because I knew I couldn’t fuck-up his life any more than I already had. I had no right to drag him into what my life was by virtue of my circumstances. A few months later, he met you, and that was the end of it.”
“Come back inside. I just have to talk with your Aunt Wanda. You can watch Dora on the TV,” he cajoles.
“Not good,” Steve says, honestly. “He was the love of my life, and now he’s dead. I know,” he sighs, “I know it’s not my first rodeo, losing someone I love but this is… this is worse somehow, more definite. I know, I know he’s not coming back, and it’s going to take me some time to get used to that.”
“So, yeah, you’re wondering why I didn’t tell you about how I was feeling, how much it was hurting me, well, I’m a coward. I was the coward that wanted to stay in this marriage, even though my husband is in love with someone else, wants someone else, finds comfort and puts his hands on someone else when he should only be putting his hands on me, because I settle for a pathetic existence, and I was so fucking desperate to keep you here, to
James folds his impressive arms over his equally impressive chest. “I don’t do that anymore,” he says, his voice matching Steve’s tone.
“Your father gave me an ultimatum,” Steve says, solemnly, his voice strained at the edges. “He told me I had two choices: either I could leave you alone, never speak to you again, never touch you again, and lose all of his support, be blacklisted in the industry long before my career had ever begun, or I could choose you.”
“You wouldn’t have felt that he deserved your help if you weren’t in love with him,” Steve retorts. “So, really, all that’s left is that when he came back, the two of you rekindled your physical relationship as well, and you’ve been screwing him this whole time.”
Tony even starts to take his shirt off, and Steve gets on his feet, padding over and tugging at his wrists.
The mine car suddenly hurtles forward, and the direction of the tracks change, spiraling off into a downward section of a wildly twisting tunnel.
, the perfect idiot househusband who cooks for you and cleans for you and takes care of the kids for you and hell, even makes billions of dollars a year, because it was a great cover, right? You were using me this whole time, right? Who the fuck would expect boring, old insurance worker Steve Rogers to be a secret agent in disguise? Now, who’s the fucking beard?”
!” James shouts, rearing to his feet so that he can loom over him. “You do, because you think this is a game. You think HYDRA is good, or they have mercy, or they have an ounce of kindness, but they don’t. They wouldn’t have even
“He is your brother,” Tony snaps. “Surely you feel some measure of anger towards me for what I have done to your only brother.”
. You don’t need to be happy about it; hell, I’m not happy about the way that it went down, but maybe, now, we can help each other out.”
“Okay, come on,” Tony says, urgently, beckoning him so that they can sneak around the corner towards the garage.
Tony clears his throat. “I have troubles myself,” he explains, “with the whole erection thing, especially after Afghanistan – plus, you know, I had a very toxic relationship with alcohol and drugs back in the day. And at the risk of spoiling the post-coital mood with a conversation about my hedonist past, I’ve been with enough people to know that it’s not as uncommon as an issue that people might think it is. There’s a, well, a lot of stigma for men who can’t get hard, and most people don’t talk about other ways of coming, or how to, well, how to deal with those issues without the use of a little blue pill, so, yeah, there are ways to come without being hard. And now you’re a proud recipient of those ways.”
Tony purses his lips thin in disapproval. “That’ll get me back, but not in the manner I wish it to. This thing must be pretty important.”
“Oh, I trust you. That’s not what I’m worried about,” Steve replies, frustration bleeding into his voice.
“Yes, once,” Steve says, honestly. “It was a long time ago, before we got together, and we were on a mission. We were being followed by the bad guy, and we were on the escalator, and she said that public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable. I agreed, because they make
“Once I’m clear, turn this thing around and get out of here!” Steve shouts over the incomprehensible din of the gunfire.
“You don’t know me. We’re not fucking friends. And what, you think that just because you work with my husband that gives you any fucking right to do experiments on my fucking marriage?” Tony demands.
That is a crushing, nauseating weight in his chest – the idea of having to tell Steve the truth, this horrible, awful secret that everyone had kept from him, that he’d forgotten, and to have him turn away in disgust.
Tony stares up at him through the dip of his lashes. “You followed me out here, didn’t you?” he retorts.
Tony takes advantage of his preoccupation and opens fire, and the bar starts to splinter in front of him. The medallion comes free of the Nazi’s hand and rolls across the floor. His hands blistering, in excruciating pain, the Nazi turns around, sees a window, and runs, diving through the glass.
“Good, ‘cause we have work to do,” Tony says, sharply, pushing past him into Steve’s apartment. “Where’s Sarah?”
They take the kids to the planetarium after breakfast, and they’re both suitably impressed and awed, especially when they do the show, and all the lights go out, and the holograms of all the planets rise into the air.
Tony falls in love with the look in his eyes. “Steve, receive this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”
“Because I thought I could bring you something to eat. I know…” Steve’s expression shadows, and he drags his hand over his face. “I know things between us aren’t great. I know that… I know that I’ve fucked up with you more times than I can count. I just… I want to, I want to talk. Can we just
Tony scowls. “Not that I owe you any fucking explanation about my marriage or whether it’s going to be a successful outcome in the end, but people like
Steve pinches at his thigh, light enough to sting but not hard enough to hurt. “Sir,” he reminds Tony, sternly.
“No, you, you need to, because I can’t have you walking out of here thinking that it’s because of I don’t want you, because I’ve
“So, are you two just going to watch, or are you actually going to join in like you keep promising?”
. I saw the way that you looked at her and the way she looked at you in that fucking restaurant. I saw the way that she touched you, fucking
Sam’s face flickers with surprise, but he doesn’t delve into condemnation like Tony is half-expecting.
“The gem!” Bhim says, suddenly remembering. “They’re taking it on a truck to Porbander. It’s the nearest port.”
“-I’m the only one who can clear your name,” James finishes for him, closing his eyes, freeing Tony of the weight of his stare.
“In any case, you should probably tell the doctor that you’re awake. He might want to give you some other medication.”
Tony comes first, his body pulling tight like stretched piano wire before snapping, his cock spilling onto the wall in front of him, leaving dark streaks where it seeps into the brick. Steve chases his orgasm, until Tony’s hole squeezes him so tight that he makes a noise that doesn’t sound altogether human, his hands tightening on Tony’s hips, until his knot is swelling, piercing his body, locking them together, as he continues to come and come and come.
This follows like a routine: once, then twice, then thrice, then four times, then five times, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
“Everyone's got to dream,” Dr. Banner says, kindly. “If you don’t dream, you go…” He makes the universal spiralling sign at his temple that denotes insanity. “All set?”
Tony’s rushing forward long before the men are actually dead, scooping the children up into his arms, clutching at them tight, and that part of him that he’s missing, the sliver that’s been carved from his soulmate, he finally finds where it’s been hiding, and he can feel it throbbing against his heart now.
Tony’s relief is instantaneous – James doesn’t need any more ghosts dogging his footsteps as he slowly starts to build his life together.
Tony thinks of Howard, his stern, cold, unimpressed face and how much it hurt to be dismissed, treated like he was less just because he had the audacity to be more.
“How are you, how are you feeling?” Steve asks, braving a step forward beyond the threshold of the room.
“It’s hard for me to stay hard,” Tony explains. “It might seem like it’s just the fact that I’m over forty, but no, it’s because, well, of all my health conditions post-Afghanistan. Blood circulation doesn’t work very well. I get really worked up when I need to get hard, and well, my lack of lung capacity and various heart conditions work against me there as well, which means even if I’m getting there, the pain’s kind of a turn-off, and I just go soft. I think, without assuming that our experiences are the same, that’s also what happened with you?” he offers. “And that’s okay, that’s just… well, it’s the same thing that’s happening to me, so I couldn’t judge you for it even if I wanted to, and I don’t want to.”
Toni surreptitiously indicates for JARVIS to record the scene, as she makes her way forward to three out of her five favourite boys in the universe. She rests her hand on Peter’s back.
“Of course I thought you were attractive, Steve,” Tony tells him, measured but fierce. “I wanted you that night in the bar, not just because you looked like that, because you looked like you could pin me up against the wall and fuck me with no trouble, but because you were
“I love you, Tony, and I know that makes me a fucking tool to say that because you’re married and you’re already second-guessing meeting me like this, but I do fucking love you. I loved you then, and the only reason I left was to protect you. You can hate me for it. Go right fucking ahead; I’m so happy to take it from you, because it means you’re still standing here in front of me to do it, and you’re not just a fucking corpse in the ground.”
smart for Mensa. When you first came to me and asked me to help you, I realised that I was getting myself involved in some serious shit, that I was pissing people off that would probably try to kill me because I tried to meddle. I
Tony’s lip quivers. “So much for saying that you love me; you just fucking called me a naïve little idiot, you jackass,” he says, coldly.
“Tony, I don’t think this is going to work,” Steve says, uncertainly, his pupils blown wide, as he looks down at Tony’s hand on his cock, dark against pale skin.
. And it made me sick, it made me want to throw up all over the side of the road, when I saw you together.”
“I do, I want to be put away wet,” Tony insists. “I want you to come all over me. I want you to make me all filthy and messy, sir.”
Tony can’t forgive him for that, can’t forgive him for deciding that Tony wasn’t worth it in the end, wasn’t worth fighting for.
It satisfies him, to see Steve like this, to see Steve feel a fraction of what Tony has felt over the last few months, because Steve will never understand, will never understand what he has put Tony through, without feeling this fear, this hurt, this gut-wrenching awareness that
“I thought you were dead,” Steve rasps when he pulls away, and his eyes are shining and damp. “There was an explosion, and I thought the basket that had you inside was in the area and exploded too, and I–”
. Stupid, because you didn’t tell me about her, tell me about this beautiful woman that you worked with, a woman who clearly knew you well enough to touch you the way she did, to talk to you with all that blatant flirting, like someone who’s seen you naked, and I couldn’t… you made me feel
doing there? What the hell were those girls doing over? Where was Jarvis and Ana? If someone doesn’t answer my questions in the next five fucking minutes–”
Tony has had enough of that from his father, from his mother, has had enough of cheap, inadequate love that only manifests when someone needs something from Tony, and he thought Steve was different, but Steve isn’t.
Caroline’s face turns into an almost sympathetic expression. “That must be so hard,” she muses. “Having to do this all alone. I guess it’s good that you can go straight home after this, you don’t have to go to work. I can’t imagine what it’s like having to take care of one kid alone, let alone two, and you being a man too.”
James’ face twists up at the mention of the name in some undefinable way, but Tony doesn’t press it.
He’s not Steve; he’s not the type that leaves his family behind, his trusting husband and his loving children to go and fuck some random redheaded co-worker because he wants something new, something exciting, something that isn’t his boring, stalwart husband.
Tony’s eyes slide to his, especially when the soldiers, all around them, start cheering, crowding around Steve and slapping him on the back. A few wave around Steve’s comic book, asking for him to sign them. They mill about him, and Steve smiles despite himself.
“And his temperament?” Tony braves himself to ask, licking his lips, even if he knows that it does not matter.
Maushmi stares at him for a moment, stares at him like she’s trying to pick him apart to pieces, see what’s on his inside. Tony doesn’t even know how she learned that, how she knows what to look like, that almost unnerving accuracy that she has that leaves grown men shifting on their feet in discomfort (later, Steve will tell him that she inherited it from him, and James will agree).
If Tony wasn’t hard yet, he’s definitely hard now, stretching at the lace of his underwear. “Yes, sir.”
The one in charge – Tony recalls the soldiers referring him to Dr. Zola – makes it clear to the other Nazi that Tony is to be obeyed.
? Or is it that you think that I’m so down with everything? That I’m such a massive slut, so I’d be cool with you fucking someone else and crawling into my bed?”
“I mutilated the bastard, and then, your father shot him in the head, and Ana, Jarvis and Melina, Natasha’s mother, cleaned up the scene. We all knew about it. All of us, Sarah, Virgil, Patricia, Melina, all of us knew what had happened, and what we’d all done, and none of us regretted it for a second,” Maushmi says, a savage, animal edge to her voice. “You want to me stand here and apologise. I won’t. I
“Fuck,” Steve grunts, his hand striping up his cock, and then, there’s a warm wash of heat as he comes obscenely in thick, white streaks all over Tony’s face and chest.
“Like I said, I don’t give a shit,” Tony replies, the tilt of his face effortlessly regal. “I don’t care about you, Natasha. I don’t care about your intentions. All I care about is that you contributed to some of the worst months of my life. Now, I appreciate your explanations, but I think it’s better if you leave now.”
; they were waiting for me to make the same mistakes that every child actor makes at some point in their career, like starving bloodhounds, and there I went, making those mistakes. I was high and fell in pools in front of a bunch of other high people, so no one really cared. I got drunk and got into a lot of bar fights. It’s… actually how I met my husband,” he muses.
Stone shrugs as much as he can in the ropes. “What can I say? The girl’s a freak. Look,” he sighs in a mock sympathetic way, “I get it. You’re in love with her. Toni’s the kind of girl that guys go crazy over, and you think that you’re doing her a favour here, but you’re not. You’re just a long line of boy toys that Toni likes to find. She fucks you blind, and when she’s done with you, when you’ve served out your use, she throws you out on your ass, because you’re not actually capable of fulfilling her. And when she’s done, when she’s done fucking her way through the whole world, she’ll come back to
Tony coughs, coughs and coughs, ending up on his hands and knees, but it doesn’t soothe the ache in his throat.
did? That wasn’t one of the skills they uploaded into my brain, Tony. They knew. If I didn’t leave, I would’ve led them straight to you-”
“I sent James away that morning, and after I dropped the kids off at school, I went to his apartment. I was angry at him, really fucking angry at him, and most of that day was spent… airing out a lot of issues that we had. I was hurt that he left me, and he was hurt that I was married, and we spent a lot of that day screaming at each other and arguing. But finally, he told me why he came back. HYDRA had chased him all over the world, after what happened in Massachusetts, and he’d left to keep me out of it, because he knew HYDRA wanted me after I helped James. HYDRA finally cornered him in Bucharest, and he fought them, fought all of them, and there was one left. The guy got away, made it back to the States, and so, James returned as well. He wanted to see me because he was scared that the HYDRA guy that got away would come after me. Apparently, during the fight in Bucharest, the guy spotted a photo of me and him that James had in his apartment, something from one of those town fairs they used to do in Cambridge, remember? You, me, Steve, Wanda, we used to go on double dates there all the time?”
“Nope. I was wondering, I… I asked my mother about us, about how we met, all four of us. She said… she said that we knew each other from when we were in the sandbox, all of us, all four of us.”
“Look, I know it’s been frightening. I know your dreams have seemed real.  But... it's okay. Okay?” Dr. Banner adds.
Steve fists a hand in Tony’s hair, the burn from his scalp making the heat grow in his belly. “Do you have any idea what you feel like?” he demands.
Steve licks his lips, eyes flitting from side to side. “It was… it was complicated. They didn’t want me to tell-”
Tony slams the point of his elbow into Obadiah’s broad, fleshy gut, struggling to get free, but Obadiah backhands him hard enough to send him flying into the chair. He collides with Steve’s faux corpse, which spills out beside him, his phone clattering nearby, the alarm flashing on the screen.
The heat of his lust overtakes any shame that might have seeped into his body like a disease without the kiss, without the arousal.
“Steve,” Tony says, quietly, placing a hand on his chest, fingers curling in the lapel of his coat. “I am sure. I wouldn’t have asked if I wasn’t sure.”
“I understand. I wouldn’t have expected that either,” Steve says, solemnly. “We should get going. They saw me. They’ll be on our trail.”
Steve’s hand circles Tony’s bare knees. “You’re such a good boy, Tony, such a good boy for me. Look at you. I can see everything. I can see every inch of you. I can see how good you take that vibrator. I can see what a slut you are, your pretty cock that’s ready to burst and that greedy fucking hole. It’s clenching around the vibrator so tight ‘cause I don’t think you can live without a nice, big, fat cock in there.”
“Yeah, in the first draft, you were completely scribbled out in a fit of rage,” Tony says, coldly, unwilling to spare Steve’s feelings any longer. “But in the second draft, you did feature, just at the other end of the page, just like Maushmi's.”
Tony opens his mouth to protest, but then, he deflates and sinks back against the pillows. “Wow, I really have built my life around my kids, haven’t I?” he says, dully, staring up at the ceiling.
The police swing back and forth between Natasha being the culprit, considering her existing rap sheet and the fact that she’d fled the scene and was nowhere to be found, or it being a plan to slice and dice concocted by Tony and Steve, who were the only others in the house that night, were covered in Pepper’s blood, and were an available, convenient offender that they could pin this gruesome murder on.
Steve deflates. “It’s the same way that you were able to stand there and accuse me of fucking Natasha.”
Tony feels the blow of pride to his gut, even if he’d had his reservations with this particular project being on show, and his smile stretches wide, pressing into his cheeks.
Now that Tony is aware that things have changed between him and Steve, become wrong and broken, he thinks things should get better, just by virtue of him acknowledging the problem.
“You were seventeen,” James grinds out. “You were seventeen and you were looking at me like that, and I wanted you, Tony. I wanted you, and I was in love with you, and I was in a bad fucking place back then. All I knew was death. All I was
“You really think that?” Steve asks, his voice low, hushed, pained. “You really think that I’d just leave you like that, leave our kids, and just, what, never talk to any of you again? Just abandon you completely?”
Tony throws his hands up in the air. “Why didn’t you tell me about SHIELD? About Natasha? Because we both know how this looks, Steve. We both know how our secrets look. They make us look guilty,” he says, coldly. “There’s a reason why both of us came to the exact same conclusion, Steve, that we were having affairs. I was
“Like I said, you’re too good for this world, Tony,” James says, gently, swiftly, before he can second-guess his actions, press his mouth to Tony’s hair and flees the room and the house, judging by the smack of the door as it closes.
Tony steps away from his table, making his way over to an unattended part of the café, all the while his phone vibrating in his hand, and he answers it, putting the cool screen to his ear.
Steve, on the other hand, could sleep easy knowing that his husband, too stupidly in love with a guy that blissfully and guiltlessly cheats on him constantly, wasn’t going to fuck anyone else, because there wasn’t anyone good enough to fuck.
“Ladies and gentlemen, this morning, we do not take another step toward annihilation. Today, we take the first step on the path to peace. We will begin with a series of micro-injections to the subject’s major muscle groups.”
Tony shrugs. “Beats me,” he says, dryly. “The organisation has origins in Nazi Germany. I decided not to think too deeply into the reasoning of people who’d join a group like that.”
Tony’s throat flexes. “I’m worried about this. I think there’s something going wrong, and you know me, Steve, you know that I don’t say shit like that without a reason.”
At the end of the bar, the Nazi that Tony had knocked out had come back to consciousness. He shakes out his head, then reaches inside his coat and pulls out a Mauser pistol. Steve smashes a chair over the head of the Giant Nazi and the huge creature finally goes down. The other Nazi points his Mauser through the smoke and flame at Steve, but Tony snatches his pistol from the shelf of alcohol that was now more glass and petrol stains than anything else. He swings around and shoots the Nazi in the back of the head.
Steve carries Tony away, holding him close to his heart, because this is the last time that Steve will ever carry Tony, and he wants to linger in this moment.
“Got into a fight with the HYDRA bastard,” James slurs. “Don’t worry, he’s worse off than me, but he managed to escape. Slippery bastard.”
“There… there could be a thousand reasons for that,” Wanda offers, full of heart. “There… I mean, they’re used to one thing, and that’s you and Steve sleeping together in the same bed. They’re so used to it, and it’s all they’ve ever known. It makes sense that she would have been weirded out by you suddenly coming out from the guest room. She’s only four, Steve. She can only process so much.”
Tony directs his gaze to the counter. “You’re right,” he says, quietly, relieved that it isn’t him saying it out loud. “Don’t… you know, don’t die out there,” he grinds out, his voice sharp-edged. “Don’t get hurt, and if you do… don’t hesitate to come to me. We’re friends… that means that I help you when you’re injured. We don’t have to… we don’t have to be more, we don’t have to fuck for me to be a decent human being to you, James. You… you can always come to me. That’s not going to change.”
He’s fully aware that they might want this time for themselves, and yes, it hurts, it gnaws at his insecurities, like he thought it would, but he wants the two of them at the end of everything, and if it means setting aside his own self-gratification and his desire to be close to them for one morning, he can do that, he can be brave enough for that.
He knows how it sounds, how it must look like to someone on the outside; to everyone else, Tony and Steve seem perfect, the perfect couple with the perfect children and the perfect life. You have to actually be in the marriage to see it rot.
“Oh, fuck you,” Tony snarls, spitting directly in his face, earning a backhand for his troubles. “Fuck you and the genocidal horse that you and your lackeys walked in on. I’m not telling you anything about the medallion.”
James stares down at him, pale eyes widened in obscene awe, but he doesn’t seem to be able to get words off his tongue, after Tony gets back to sucking his cock with gusto, and frankly, Tony is very good what he’s doing currently.
He faces Steve then, breathing hard, breathing heavy, and Steve is staring up at him, like this is the first time that he’s seeing him, seeing how hard this has been for him, how much this has destroyed him, made he reconsider reality itself.
“You were screaming,” Tony points out. “Both of you, we could hear you. That’s why we came running.”
Tony stops moving, and an ache begins to build up in his arm. He looks at Steve, breathing hard, sweat pooling at his breastbone, at the nape of his neck and on the insides of his thighs. He looks at Steve, the lean lines of him, the way that his ribs cling to his skin, and his thin arms and his huge cock hanging and hard between his legs.
“Of course, I’ll see you at work tomorrow?” Nat asks, hopefully, her eyes wide and luminous in her face.
Steve pales, Phillips’ words sinking in, and Tony’s hands twitch, ready to help Steve if his legs fail him, but Steve pulls himself together, staring at a map of Austria on the wall, alongside aerial photos of a facility.
Tony taps her on the nose. “If you don’t clean up the bathroom, then, you might trip and fall into the drain and be lost forever.”
James casts him a long, measuring glance, his eyes soft and rapt, sorrow lining his face, like he’s never seen anything like Tony on this fucking filthy sofa.
“It was one night,” James explains. “It was after we’d stopped HYDRA, and I was crazy in love with him, and I knew he loved me too, and I shouldn’t have. I should’ve remembered who I am,
“I… I thought it was some misunderstanding at first, that’s the fucking sad thing,” Steve says, woodenly. “I genuinely thought something was wrong. I thought…” his face turns ubiquitously miserable. “I thought he was tricking you somehow, that he was blackmailing you, that he had something on you, that he was
“Missed the rush of doing something with myself,” Tony says, quietly. “I have… I guess I’ve spent so long being a father, a stay-at-home father at that, that I’d forgotten what it was like to have that rush, to fight the bad guys, to be a part of something bigger than myself.”
“No, wait!” Tony snaps, batting at Steve’s forearm when the medallion gleams in the light of the fire.
Pale grey eyes flash through his vision, momentarily, and his mouth tastes like lies, like ash, and he bats it away, horrified, because he’s not that sort of person, he doesn’t need the memory, the image of some other man to get himself off, not when Steve’s inside him.
Tony bites his lip, burying his face in the pillow, his mouth a slack, wet smear, but he keeps his hands there, spreading himself open, even if his arms begin to strain.
“You are allowed to grieve him, even in front of me. If he’d lived,” Tony takes a deep breath, “if he’d lived, maybe we’d have never been friends, but I’d have respected your friendship, and I’d like to think that he’d have respected our marriage too. I just… if you want to talk about him and Wilson, I’ll listen. Besides, I didn’t have a problem with Wilson. Hell, I liked the guy.”
“And so, they drew this family portrait that didn’t include me at all?” Steve says, his voice thin and taut.
No, he started off like a normal kid, if sickly; he got sick constantly, was in his bed for a lot of the summer, while the kids in his neighbourhood played, screaming and screeching, loud enough that Steve could hear it from their modest one-bedroom apartment.
“She will,” Toni says, conspiratorially, hooking her arms through Bucky and Steve’s. “She has deadly aim with those shoes.”
He finds himself in the middle of streets, listening to the slightest sound, but there’s nothing, not even a dog barking. He turns and looks down between the houses, deep into a dark alley. He goes deeper, deeper into the shadows, and he pauses every now and then to make sure that he isn’t missing anything, a knot of tension winding in his belly, as though the killer will come screaming out at him at any second.
He lets out a garbled, thin laugh, and out come those blades on his hands, like knives, which he runs almost seductively over the palm of his other hand.
you that the hover car wasn’t ready, and you didn’t believe me. You trotted that thing out there, and you failed, and for some reason, the audience
Tony sinks his teeth into his lower lip, a lascivious sort of look in his eyes, and waits as Steve drags his knuckles up the inside of his thigh, until the pads of his fingers, slick with lube, find his rim, pressing insistently at the furled skin, and then, Tony parts for him like he’s a ripe peach ready to be seeded and eaten.
“Fuck,” Tony says, breathlessly, and rounds on Steve, his anger lighting up his face, turning it incandescent. “You let this person near our
“He’s right, Tony,” James agrees, folding his arms over his solid, broad chest. “There is no… I mean, we’re not individual relationships within a wider threesome or something. We’re all in this together.”
Steve presses the head of his cock against Tony’s rim, and his swollen rim flutters open, parting for him like a ripe peach. The stretch burns a little at first, the width of Steve’s cock much more than the width of three of his fingers, but Tony quickly gets used to it, and Steve stops with every inch or so that slips inside him, checking Tony’s face, his hands, the noises that he deliberately doesn’t make, to ensure that he isn’t hurting him.
It’s funny, something that meant so much to Tony, was so significant in his downward spiral these last few months means barely nothing to the star of his nightmares.
“Where…” Tony clears his throat, unable to help the hapless, frantic swell of panic that pools in his throat. “Where did you find that?”
And then, he looks up at Steve through the dip of his eyelashes, looking shy, and he says, “Have you watched Star Wars, Daddy?”
Tony purses his lips thin. “Because I’m a billionaire, and you refuse to take advantage of me,” he mutters under his breath.
“Don’t worry about it, baby,” Tony replies, once he’s swallowed down his mouthful of steamed eggplant dumpling, reaching over with a napkin to blot out the oil stain on the glass table.
“Well, you’re the one paying me, sir,” he says, coquettishly, and sidles over, perching primly on Steve’s knee.
in probably the whole world who was willing to do an Iyengar wedding ceremony for a woman and two men directs them to start doing the seven rounds around the
They come up close to the school, where a number of parents and their children mill about, saying their goodbyes and handing out their kisses liberally.
“And then, I was walking up the stairs at the same time, and I was about to pick a fight with the piece of shit, and before I even knew what was happening, you were shoving him down the stairs. He hit the ground, and his neck was broken.”
Pepper’s parents are a wreck, her mother crying noisily, while her father clutches onto his wife for dear life.
Tony is already waiting in the laboratory when Steve enters with Peggy. For a moment, his attention is diverted by the private in his khakis, before Abraham says something to him, urgently, and he’s swept away in the engineering of it all.
Tony’s brow furrows. “I didn’t protect myself,” he tells him. “I let him do what he liked with me; only when I couldn’t take it anymore did I take a knife to his throat.”
The drunken singing behind him alerts his attention. “I see crack squad is prepping for duty,” he says, dryly.
Natasha’s brow furrows. She hesitates. “Steve has asked me to stay with you tonight, if you would allow me to do so.”
“I will get Bucky, and we will dispose of the body. I will send Natasha to you. With her help, you might clean up. I will come to you when it is done, so you know that you are safe. How does that sound?” he asks, gently.
them; they were the first people he loved, after all, after Jarvis, the ones who had no blood ties to him but still stood at his side.
“So, how can I tolerate such behaviour in my own brother,” Steve says, misery pulling the skin tight across his handsome face. “You are still so young, and my brother
He slips his key into the lock and turns the knob, slipping inside, keeping close to the walls, as he pads forward.
Tony turns onto his back just like Steve asks and he scuttles over to the edge of the mattress, reaching under the bed to find his special box, fishing it out from underneath. In the box is a variety of sex toys not safe for public consumption: vibrators and dildos and plugs and cock rings and handcuffs and a fleshlight. He pulls out his favourite vibrator, a long, thick black one, chrome in its finish, and he brandishes it out at Steve, with a waggle of his eyebrows.
“You knew,” Tony accuses, in a voice as brittle as glass. “You knew about Steve and SHIELD this whole time, didn’t you?”
respect you, Tony, I need you to know that. I need you to… I love you, and I respect you, and I think you’re the smartest person I’ve ever known or will ever know, and if I ever made you think that I didn’t feel or think those things, I’m so fucking sorry. I’m so fucking sorry.”
“You will never understand what it’s like for me, as a brown man with brown children, to watch as my white husband outwardly prefers a
“You can’t do that, you can’t just…” Tony falls silent. “I’m married, James. I have children with him. If I…
Tony looks at Steve. “He just moved me with his hands. He manhandled me,” he says, seething slightly.
Bucky stares at him for a moment, and then, he promptly bursts into tears, taking Peter from Steve’s arms so that he can clutch at Peter. Peter doesn’t hesitate to throw his arms around Bucky’s shoulders and kiss him on the cheek, and honestly, that just makes him cry harder.
Steve scowls at him. “Okay, we both know you wouldn’t because no one rubs your hands when they get sore from typing the way I do.”
“Regrettable?” Tony laughs, harsh and grating. “I suppose you would think that; after all, rape is not some unforgivable thing where alphas are concerned, is it? No, it’s only the omegas that have to live with the consequences that you all force on us. And I suppose it is the United States in a nutshell as well, trotting out a rapist as their warrior of choice against the evil Nazis. I suppose the character of such a man means nothing to you, as long as you get your big, fast soldier, as you said.”
“Maushmi’s definitely the bolder twin,” Tony says, chewing on his lower lip. “I’ve noticed… I mean, when they were toddlers, she was always louder, braver, she ate well, and Peter… he didn’t eat well, he smiled a lot, but he liked to read and play quietly with his blocks. Maushmi, I find, demands more attention, or rather, she… attracts your attention more than Peter.”
“You sure it works?” Steve asks Tony, presumably because it’s his name on the side of the transponder.
Barnes’s eyes widen. He straightens, even if there is exhaustion lining his voice and his shoulders.
He knows that Obadiah is there somewhere, in the darkness of the boiler room, behind the pipes, lingering around the corner.
Tony reaches out, ignoring how his cock twitches almost painfully against his stomach, and runs his palm over Steve’s shaven cheek.
Tony flashes him the edge of a smile. “Sorry. Force of habit.” He rocks his hips back. “Keep going,” he cajoles. “Keep fucking me.”
“You said that you think that sometimes Tony puts himself in bad situations and that means that he’s in danger and he needs help, that you think he doesn’t realise how important he is to people, how much you love him, how much you’d hurt if something happened to him?”
“That’s what this is about, huh? Toni and the stories she likes to tell. Look, maybe this is difficult to hear and all, because you’re new to Toni’s game, but this is what Toni is. She likes it. She likes it rough; she always has, and she always will.”
It’s Steve, but it’s also not Steve, at least, not the Steve that Tony knows, the Steve that Tony had dated and fucked and fallen in love with, not because they’re drastically separate human beings, but because Tony wasn’t expecting to see a skinny, short version of Steve swimming in a Captain America costume.
would’ve said, of course, that’s when Tony feels like he’s married, like there’s something definitive that hadn’t occurred to him when the Catholic priest had been saying what he was saying.
Steve’s brow knits together. “Why?” he asks, shocked, like he doesn’t think that there’s anything that Tony should feel self-conscious over.
Although, there is a knock on his chamber door, late at night, once the feast is over and the revelries have spilt into the yard with drunken alphas shouting and fighting and heading towards the brothel for some warm company for the night.
“Do you think Daddy would be angry at me for wanting to call Steve and Bucky Daddy?” Peter wonders out loud, looking up at Toni with those guileless, liquid-dark eyes.
“You two have been a bunch of shit patrons all evening, and I’m done with it. Get lost,” he snarls in Kannada.
Steve’s hands tighten around Tony’s hips – tomorrow, he’ll certainly wake up with a mottled canvas of bruises on either side, but he’ll still be content, content enough to touch those bruises and remember how they got there and smile at the soft, slow ache.
“He didn’t have anaesthetic or antiseptic, but he made do with what he had. I have an arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia. My heart, in all these years, hasn’t returned to its normal rhythm. It’s probably similar to the palpitations that you get. I get tired very quickly, myself, and I can’t run up more than two flights of stairs. Hell, even that’s…” he trails off, “that’s hard sometimes too. At around one flight, I feel a tightness in my throat, and my legs and arms start to tingle. I’m fairly sure that’s my blood circulation cutting off, because my legs turn to stone, and it’s too hard to keep moving. I can’t survive without the arc reactor, but it gives me a lot of shit to deal with at the same time. Half my ribs and sternum are gone. The blood vessels in that area are all distorted, which means I get blood clots sometimes. Normally, when you get blood clots, you take blood thinners, but I can’t, because thinning my blood would actually make things more dangerous. And if those blood clots detach, they can become embolisms that can cause a stroke or be fatal. I have to monitor them very carefully.”
Tony shrugs. “I have a picture of how I want this day to go, and you guys are too slow for my tastes. Get back to what you were doing. Make out like teenagers all you like, and I’ll get things going over here.”
“Tony, I don’t think you’re old, or that you are fat. You are still the most beautiful person I have ever met, I promise.”
Tony sighs and reaches out, dragging the flat of his palm down Steve’s cheek. “You’re the best I’ve ever had.”
Steve barrels one more time into the door – the frame splinters, and they enter. Tony takes a step inside, slips and hits the ground, his hands and knees wet.
Tony grabs the nearest plush toy and throws it at Steve’s face. Steve retorts by grabbing another teddy bear and lobbing at it his head.
Toni narrowed her eyes. “You do realise that I’m an adult, and I don’t need anyone’s permission to get married, let alone a man’s,” she pointed out. “And besides, I am the head of my family, so if you really wanted permission, you would have asked me.”
The winds are howling, and there’s a demonic looking dog in one of the yards, barking at them. On the street, a long streak of blood runs like a line parallel to the curb.
Another truth is that Steve could have taken advantage of him that night, and he didn’t, not just because he didn’t want Tony in that way, but because he understood things better than Tony did, understood what Tony didn’t want to understand.
“But you really went to meet James at the park,” Sam finishes for him, a disappointed edge to his voice.
He’d destroy them if he could, turn them into nothing the same way that they turned Tony into nothing.
child that we did what we did,” Howard snarls, stepping up close. “You think we did it for ourselves; you think that we did it to make ourselves feel better? You don’t know
Steve nods to himself. “So, uh, does that mean that you’re free to go out to dinner tonight?” he asks, straightening, lips pursing thin, jaw setting in resolve.
“I’m gonna fuck you so full, doll,” Steve grunts, his hands tightening around her thighs, as he spreads her wide open. “I’m gonna fuck you so full, and you’re gonna be so full of my come, when you sit like a prim little princess in that meetin’ of yours, tryin’ to keep it from leakin’ out. And then, when you’re done, you’re gonna come back right here, and we’re not even gonna make it back to the bedroom, doll. I’m just gonna bend you over the back of the fuckin’ couch and fuck you all over again until you’re screamin’ my name.”
Tony doesn’t know what to say, can’t help the sudden rush of pleasure at hearing those words coming from Steve, and he immediately hates himself for it, hates himself for being so weak, because even if Steve is a SHIELD agent, even if James is really Bucky Barnes, and he has this unending suspicion that Bucky Barnes and Steve were once in love with each other, and he’s pretty fucking sure that Steve is still sleeping with a woman who may not be his receptionist but is definitely someone he works with closely.
“Europe, mainly,” James explains. “There’s a lot of area to cover there, and the borders aren’t exactly airtight either. I was in France for a little while, then, Germany, and Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Greece, Russia. I finally ended up in Bucharest, when they made a move.”
He thinks that Tony is just going to believe some tall tale about how Natasha is the receptionist that takes care of everyone in the office, how they barely know each other, how she grew up in the south so she’s a little more touchy-feely than people in New York might be.
“No, it’s already late. Might as well let them sleep until dinner time,” Steve says, the lines in his face softening when his eyes drag over the twins. “Come on, you can’t be comfortable on that carpet.”
He sinks down onto Steve’s cock until he’s fully seated, with the thatch of pubic hair at the base of Steve’s cock scratching against the insides of his thighs.
Tony throws his arms around her, and then, pulls back, making his way over to his car, waving over his shoulder. He puts the car into drive the second he’s fully seated and drives all the way to James’ apartment.
Tony manages a smile, but he feels the exhaustion deep in his bones. His mother, standing in one of the corners of the room, looks downright distraught.
James lifts an eyebrow. “Hey, you were the one who was questioning whether we were emotionally healthy enough to make this decision. You sound pretty self-actualised yourself.”
Maushmi nods to herself. “And you’re going to stay too?” she asks James, haltingly. “You’re going to be our
“Believe me, you made a mistake. If you would just give me something to placate them. Some bit of information.”
“Yeah, it was just so that I could start shooting up the place when you guys pissed me off enough,” Tony drawls. He looks over at Steve, who’s still staring at James like he’s a ghost (and if Steve’s belief is correct, then, he sort of is a ghost). “Steve? Honey, you okay?” he asks, softly.
Oh, how could Tony have ever thought that anything would end between them? How could he have ever thought that Steve had stopped loving him, wanting him?
, and just because we don’t get along doesn’t mean that I wouldn’t burn the whole fucking world to the ground if it means that you are safe. Do with that what you will.”
Tony’s hand twitch, and he reaches out, unable to help himself, running his bare fingers over Steve’s muscled abdomen. The muscle is firm, and Steve flexes under Tony’s touch. Tony’s belly clenches in response, and oh, God, there’s slick, he can feel it.
Peter nods. “You’re like that, uh, you know that thing with the black and white swirl in a circle, Appa.”
Tony gnaws on his lower lip, and before he can overthink it, he stands up on his toes; he presses the flat of his palm against Steve’s chest, feeling closer to him than he has ever before, even on the day of their bonding; he can feel Steve’s heart beating, feels it in his hands, all the way down his arm and even in his chest if he believes it so – he leans up on his toes and presses his mouth against Steve’s.
, like he was some fancy, strapping businessman and not a terribly young college student who ate too much chilli cheese fries and often threw vodka cranberries at stupid people.
“No, you’re not,” James says, sternly. “Have you looked at yourself in the mirror recently? You look like shit.”
“That’s how I felt this time, when we showed up at Wanda and Sam’s place, and she was on the floor and the kids were gone. Tony was… he was ready to rush everywhere and anywhere and fight everyone to get the kids back. I didn’t want him to go anywhere near them. I was so afraid that he’d get hurt, and he was… he was so insistent on coming with me, and I was scared. I was so fucking scared.”
“He was sorry about it,” Tony feels the need to defend Steve. “And then, I left the room, went to bed, and when I woke up, he was gone. I just figured he went to work, so I came straight here to pick the kids up.”
bitch, and Steve startles, as if he’d completely forgotten Tony was even here, his eyes so fixed on the beautiful woman in front of him.
Tony’s name never comes up linked with Grant, which he thanks the gods for, but it doesn’t help knowing that he wasn’t Grant’s only victim, just his last.
“You mean, they whore her out, and she goes along with it because she doesn’t know any better?” Tony asks, disgust lining his voice.
, around my friends, and you feel guilty because you couldn’t see what he was doing to me, until it was too late, until he’d already hurt me, until he’d already done whatever he wanted with me,” Tony says, his face gaunt, his voice full of rage. “You killed him, because you felt guilty too, because you felt responsible too, didn’t you?”
Tony frowns and pulls away from James’ embrace, wrapping his arms around himself. “Complication? What complication?”
“I mean, as long as you understand that sex workers deserve respect and are not, by any means, considered lesser because of what they do for a living, and that there’s nothing actually wrong with sex work, as long as everything is safe, sane and consensual.”
it bothered me!” Steve barks at him. “You weren’t here; no one knew where you were; the kids were stressing out, which stressed me out-”
Steve takes Tony’s hand in his, and his free hand flattens against the arc reactor, which is still flickering bravely.
. I love you, I love you like I love Steve and nothing else. That’s it. You’re my life, and you were my life back then, and you didn’t do anything wrong. It was all me. It was because I was selfish and arrogant enough that I thought I could make those decisions
He waits outside the door until the teacher pokes her head out, her face soft and inviting, the sort of faces that teachers who teach little children have, and she lets him come inside.
The third one, Peter’s second one, has Steve’s entire figure scribbled out in dark, thick, black crayon.
“I’ve been in a car with both of you, and no offence, but you drive like great-grandmothers, and I feel like we’re on a time limit,” Tony muses, as he pulls the car into a drive and pushes his feet against the gas pedal.
Tony’s face hardens into an angry mask, his expression flattening. “Yeah, everyone’s made that very clear; Steve’s not the guy to do that to someone, but it’s always the guy that you least expect it that betrays you the most.”
this whole time; you don’t get to come back to me today and act like I’ve soiled your perfect temple with my whorishness because I had the audacity to seek out orgasms before we even met. Secondly, don’t start this
I know a lot of people have concerns about the gun thing. Look, you can disagree with me, but in my opinion, considering that we only have things from Tony's POV and we know what he's been going through the last few months, I do feel like we have to give Steve a bit of a break on that, because it does look bad for Tony from where Steve is sitting – if Tony actually were a Nazi, I'd want Steve to actually consider killing him, and you can not believe him all you like, but Steve was pretty clear that he would have let Tony leave, safe and unharmed, even if he actually was a villain. I just hope you can allow Steve that one thing, because I may not be able to address it in a way that makes everyone happy here.
He reaches for Tony again, touches his cold cheek, and whispers, “Tony?”, like his whisper might be able to bring him to life, as though his pain, his grief, his sorrow is enough to open Tony’s eyes, because Tony had never liked seeing him upset.
Tony rolls his eyes, scrubbing at a particularly annoying oil stain in the corner of one of his Pyrex boxes.
