Jack looks over at Sam, who smiles from the front seat and Dean manages a quick glance over the rearview mirror.
..................................................................................................
After a while, Jack perks up, looks at Castiel and asks: “Hey, so, is it possible that you can show me your wings?”
“I’m here”
Riley stares sadly at Dean “I know how you feel Dean… or at least I think so. I would give up my grace gladly in exchange for your well-being, but I don’t have it anymore.” Riley pauses for a second, she breathes and continues “I may not have my powers, but I can’t be killed… at least according to Metatron, and well, we’ve tried it here to, I can’t be injured by anything so far, not demon killing knife, not angel blade. If we do this, I’ll protect Cas, I promise you to get him out of there unscathed… this is the only way.”
Dean remembers, they ran into her a few weeks ago, she saved them from more demons, and then vanished. And now she’s here in the middle of the lonely road. Dean sees her clearly, long brown wavy hair, her eyes are dark, but he’s pretty sure they’re also brown like chocolate, she’s wearing a grey tank top, red and black plaid shirt, jeans and chucks; there’s something hanging from her neck, it seems delicate and silvery,
“I felt like I lost you tonight, over and over…” he continued, rushing now “Cas I can’t…” he looked up at him “I love you” he said simply, heart pounding.
“Don’t be baby, Winchester. I know for a fact you’ve had worse.” Riley teases.
can do a lot worse than just killing you”
She looks back at Jay and he’s giving her the puppy eyes, damn guys and their puppy eyes, although she’s a sucker for Jay’s.
The demon throws Dean across the room, and manages to kick the knife out of Sam’s hand. Cas turns his attention to Dean while Riley goes after the demon. Dean’s on his feet and while his brother and the girl are fighting; he gets his gun and fires once at the demon’s chest. The demon stops moving and falls to the ground, devil’s trap bullets do come in handy. The others turn to look at him.
I do want to share with you that I already know how this is going to end and I'm working on the last few chapter.
It’s been a few days and they boys have been checking in with them every day, mostly Dean has been calling Castiel or viceversa, it’s like they can’t be apart for too long or they’ll explode and this makes Riley chuckle. Who would have thought that Cas was going to end up here… actually, this is the only way it could have gone, this was Cas after all, he never really liked following all the rules, and this one was kind of important, angels and humans could not be together, could not fall in love, and yet, here she was looking amused at how Cas blushes and leans into the phone, almost as if he wants to go through it to meet Dean on the other side.
Hello!
Hope you like it.
……………………………………………………………………….
Riley’s panting now, writhing, trembling, moaning, gasping, she has no control over what’s happening and this is what she loves the most. Giving up control, only here, only with Jay; it’s exhilarating just thinking about it, she tries to control every aspect of her life after all, everything except this.
“Yeah, but I can’t risk it, besides I know how cheery you are in the mornings” she says rolling her eyes.
They take in their surroundings and head in the direction of the motel. They near the room with the correct number and as Riley steps up and inches her hand to the doorknob, a current runs through her and stops her cold, the angel wings on her neck begin burning her skin, she immediately turns around and she sees Castiel looking at her, she wants to tell him to run and get out of here, but before she can open her mouth the door to the boys room opens and she’s dragged into darkness, her name being said and desperately trying to reach her from somewhere, now, far away.
…And someone clears his throat from the door, making both of them jump; Sam is standing on the threshold, with a wicked smile.
“Well, it’s my responsibility, or at least, I think it is…” She stands and goes around the bed, looking down at Cas, left hand reaching for him, she stops before she can place it over his forehead, and turns to the boys.
Cas groaned, opening his eyes, he tried to push himself off of Dean, but Dean held him back, a hand across his stomach “Don’t move, please. Just - just stay here, okay? Let Sammy check out your bandages first”. Cas stopped moving, compliant.
“What are you talking about?” and the question is directed at Jack. “What do you mean I said… I mentioned… I talked about Cas’ wings?” he finishes, his tone full of surprise.
Sam’s still watching her, a questioning look on his face.
“Also, after last night, I imagined you’d need a good breakfast” Sam adds mockingly. “How are you feeling?”
“Who?” asks Dean.
“Every 10 years?” Dean questioned.
Cas was staring straight ahead. “Promise?” he asked, squeezing Dean’s hand.
Dean’s train of thought is interrupted by the demon shuffling in his seat; he starts mumbling.
“I got more pieces, but not the complete picture. I’m sorry.” Riley turns her gaze to her hands which turn to fists a second later, she squeezes her eyes shut.
Sam snaps his head to look at his brother, then at Cas. “HOW?”
“I’m sorry, I’m okay” he sighs “I just wish you would stop worrying about me” he smiles weakly at Dean “I’m the angel, I’m suppose to be taking care of you, not the other way around” he says sincerely.
“So you fell 20 something years ago?” Sam asks.
Dean’s eyes widen, he started calling for Cas while pounding on the door. Sam appeared behind Dean, he was looking around, alert. Dean kicked the door down.
“It was an ambush” Dean says, disdain clear in his tone. “We were finished with the case, we went back to the motel for our things, about to hit the road… we never thought… we should have been more careful. I’m sorry this is my fault.”
“Someone or something is doing this” Dean assured the angel “when I find who or what I’m gonna send them straight to hell!”
Then a phone rings, Cas answers and Riley can hear him say “Hello, Dean”, she disconnects and continues on memory lane, until she hears Cas’ frantic voice calling out for Dean.
“He is so soooft, and his haiiir… even softer” Dean says while running his fingers through the angel’s hair, and Cas doesn’t move, but instead accepts the caress, trying and failing not to turn even redder with each comment out of Dean’s mouth.
Aside from the nightmares, she’s started to remember more of her past life, Cas is being of great help with context for a lot of these memories, as she often gets flashes and not entire moments. This is also draining her energy, who thought remembering was such a hard task, also, it makes her very hungry and sometimes moody; but she handles it, and she’s thankful that the boys give her space and time when needed.
He felt Cas swatting his hand away; Cas straightened up, and wrapped his fingers around Dean’s length. He replicated the movements he’d felt moments before, and squeezed, twisting his hand a bit to the sides; Dean groaned, his hands coming down on Cas’ shoulder for support.
As they approach the others, Sam notices the pizza and 2 jars of Beer that are now on top of the table, and throws a hard look in Dean’s direction.
And none of them miss the easiness with which Dean has just said the pet name, Riley smiles sheepishly, because hey at least that means she’s part of the family now; so sue her, but it’s been a while since Riley has felt part of something, she’d been alone for a long time until she actually found the boys.
Cas nodded, Dean grabbed his keys and tossed them to Sam.
Riley and Cas stayed at the motel, while Sam and Dean got provisions. They were leaving in the morning, Cas was still recovering and Dean wanted to make sure he was feeling better before they hit the road. It was quiet, Dean’s mind wandering, both hands on the wheel and Sam was looking out the window, a soft orange glow from the sun, night coming.
The silence is deafening. No one moves, no one says a word; they’re all holding their breaths.
Hiiiii! I'm back! finally after so long!
“They covered our heads… I think we’re near to where they caught us though, we were not on the road for long.”
“Umm, what’s going on?” Dean asks a little confused, raising his eyebrows in Cas’s directions, also silently asking why on earth are you not wearing your suit and trench coat. “What’s with all the food?”
Dean stares at him, realization dawned on him, they had been getting these kind of small cases, nothing that would attract too much attention, they almost seemed too easy; which is probably what they were, easy cases to lure them to a certain place, to what end? Kill them? They had worked several cases, why wait until this one in particular? What stopped them before?
Sam stands up, walking behind her “Uh, Cas, this is Riley, she healed you, we were hoping you could tell us who she is…”
“Dean, it’s okay…” hushes Cas. Jack turns to see Dean’s hands fisting Cas’ trench coat, like he’s clinging for dear life.
Images come and go; Riley can’t keep herself awake for more than mere seconds at a time.
When they got back to the motel, they found Riley standing at the far end corner between a bed and the wall, a bruise on the left side of her face, mouth and nose bleeding, angel blade in hand; she was ready to attack but still shielding Cas. Her eyes intense, locked on the enemy. Cas was slouching behind her, holding his angel blade, eyes alert.
“Well yes, but that doesn’t mean you have to be so hasty, Jesus woman!”
The others nod and start walking.
“Come on Cas, like you need help knocking those down” Dean shouts so he can be heard over the loud music. Castiel turns to him with an annoyed look, as he has been distracted from his shot.
Enjoy.
“Most of us don’t know, there’s a selected group who have been pulling strings here and there, but no one knows who’s giving the orders. Word is, he’s powerful and wants to finished what you started”.
“Yeah, he’ll be fine.” Sam answers. “So, lets just agree to not mention any of this to Dean tomorrow, okay?”
Cas and Riley reach the barn, a pentagram drawn on the dirt at the far end, an angel feather on four of the points, and an empty vial on the last point. A glowing scroll in the middle, Cas stares at it confused. “I have no idea what this is…”
“Just muscle” Riley interrupts. “Tell us what you know”
Riley is afraid too, but more than anything, she’s content with having found Cas and the boys and being helpful to them.
“That one time we thought he died, but instead he disappeared and forgot he was an angel, and some random girl found him, and they were together when I got there, I almost died; he didn’t remember a thing and I had to make him remember, part of me didn’t want to tell him because he seemed happy…” and Jack just stares back and forth between Dean and Cas.
Riley feels content with her life at this very moment and she tries to savoir it, it feels almost magical, in the early morning hours, Jay still asleep, her feeling his heart beating through his chest against her back, his breath faintly reaching her hair and ear, it tickles lightly, not enough to make her move.
“Get out of my way” says the girl, moving around to get to him, walking with a small limp “He needs help”.
The game goes smoothly after Jack is shown “how it’s done” by a very enthusiastic Dean; Jack seems more relaxed after a few tries and is clearly enjoying the game, either because he was actually into the game or because Dean seemed to be giving his approval on his progress.
The kid goes to Dean and says “I’m really sorry, Dean. I really wasn’t supposed to say anything.”
“There’s something else” Sam mused. “Cameron had a… fascination with Greek mythology, and there was a mention of The Algea, on her letter. The Algea are the spirits of pain and suffering of both the mind and body. They were also goddesses of grief, sorrow, and distress. They were known as the bringers of weeping and tears. She wrote in her last letter that these spirits helped her move on…”
“I guess you can’t help it” Dean quips.
“What are you talking about?” Cas stands up from his seat, now visibly upset.
“The end” he says.
“Stop it!”
Riley wakes up, blinking, trying to adapt her sight to the darkness that engulfs her; this time she’s able to push herself off the ground and sit upright, she senses ruffling on her left side and turns to search for Dean.
?” he scoffs.
Jack looks intently at Sam, and turns to Castiel, who only nods.
“Winchester”. He barks a laugh. “I’ve been looking for you!”  he growls as his eyes turn black.
“What?” the boys ask in unison.
“What did you do to him!?” Dean demands, while he walks up to her, a hand closing around her throat.
He could hear Sam ruffling through the bags over the running water. Sam called out, letting them know he’d brought dinner. Dean smiled at himself and called back, telling him they’d be out in a few minutes. Dean took the time to wash Cas’ hair, yep, it was a kink all right. Cas hummed content, he hadn’t stopped smiling, and Dean was happy for it; whenever he looked at Dean, it spread wide, making his eyes wrinkle a little. Dean loved it; he’d returned the smile every time.
…………………………………………………………
! WHERE IS HE!?” says the girl, something wild in her eyes, like something is unraveling.
Dean turns to the group “Looks like we’ll have to do this the old fashion way.”
“Hadn’t you started earlier?” Sam asks Dean, while Dean downs half a glass and throws Sam the most innocent smile he can muster.
The world outside the Impala is just a blur, trees coming and going as if on a loop. Dean can’t bring himself to face his brother, there are tears threating to fall from his eyes, and he blinks rapidly, willing them away. He doesn’t respond, he doesn’t trust his own voice right now. A look in the rear view mirror, and when his eyes go back to the road, he sees a figure, he slams on the breaks, Sam reaching back to stop Cas’ body from falling.
That’s all she can think before the darkness swallows her whole.
Jack stands up with a worried expression and they get out of the room, leaving Dean and Cas alone.
“No.” Sam responds, defeated.
“Castiel alwaaaaysss comes when I caall, Sam is still a lil’ angry about that… buuuut Cas and I have a more profound bond, youu know…”
“Jerk” Sam responds automatically, getting out of the car and turns to Dean, a smirk on his face “Funny thing how you said
Riley looks at the boys “Ok, guys, you have to be the distraction, Cas and I will sneak into the barn and complete the spell, you have to give us as much time as you can.”
It’s been three weeks since they got trapped by Metatron and the demons, Riley lost her grace in the process and is now by all intents and purposes, a human woman, again. Sam was unscathed, Dean and Cas were not so lucky but are recovering well. After the boys got some rest, Riley told them about the doors in her meditation, about what she had heard, about what Metatron did and had said about her,
Riley frowns “I think I recognize this spell…”
. He’s always been envious, especially of Lucifer, but if it comes down to getting revenge against Luci, or getting revenge against God, I think we both know he’s gonna team up with whomever gives him the best chance”
“Let me guess” Dean snapped “Cameron couldn’t bear the thought of living without the love of his life and the son of a bitch decided to go all Juliet and wait for her on the other side. Classic love tragedy stuff” he ranted, rolling his eyes. He was so done with this case.
She's been carried again, through the passageways.
…………………………………………………………
After catching their breaths, Jay gets up to clean the mess, they lay down for a while, kissing and talking. Jay is the first one to get up, he takes a shower and asks Riley to rest while he does, she needs it after all.  Jay comes out of the bathroom, and convinces Riley get out of bed and in the shower. She takes her time while replaying their morning sex, she smiles and chuckles at the memories and can’t help but think what kind of spell Jay has on her, that makes her want to be so kinky, so daring. Love, she thinks, that’s the spell. She steps out of the shower and into the bedroom, Jay is gone, but she can smell coffee and pancakes, her heart feels like it could burst from happiness.
Castiel averts his eyes once more, and can’t help but blush; seeing his reaction Dean continues.
On the ride back to the motel, Cas was on the back seat. Dean kept flicking his eyes between the road and Cas every few seconds. Cas stared out of the window for most of the ride. Dean could hear him sigh heavily and look down, and then he turned to the window, once more. Dean was worried now, something was off with Cas, and Dean had noticed it the moment they set foot in town.
Castiel turns to get orange juice and glasses for everyone, and looks over at Dean and motions  for him to take a seat.
Riley opens her eyes, sitting up straight, she’s in a motel room, light spilled out from between old blinds, she squints a little, surveying the room; there’s someone on the bed next to hers. She rises from the bed, making the mattress squeak, she flinches; but there seems to be no movement from the other person, except for a steady breathing. Her hands are wrapped in bandages and her legs feel weak, healing Cas had taken its toll on her body. She peeks at the figure, Cas, lying on his back, features relaxed, he seems to be healing properly and resting peacefully.
Dean got up, ordering Cas not to move, he went to get a couple of wet warm towels and cleaned the mess on Cas’ chest, then proceeded to clean himself.
She turns to Cas, “How are you feeling?” she asks with concern in her voice.
Riley is on her feet in a second and goes to stand next to Cas, brow furrowed with concern. “What is it?”
Riley snaps back and tries to catch her breath, turning to assess the damage. The demon isn’t dead, but after what she just did, she thinks he should be.
“Even if I did know something, why would I tell you? You’re a good fighter; I underestimated you. Won’t happen again…”
Cas shakes his head “I’ve sent word to everyone out there. But so far, no news.”
Dean let go of Cas with a pop, he wrapped his right hand around Cas and started pumping faster, he went in for a kiss, propping himself on his left arm; Cas was beautiful, and he wanted to see him come, he wanted to remember this forever. Cas was so close to release, he put his hands on Dean’s shoulder, as if he was his lifeline. Dean bent down; and grazed his teeth over Cas’ ear. “Let go, angel. Come for me…” Dean breathed.
She’s been carried through a passageway, dark and musty; she hears screams.
Cas turns to her bewildered. “How? I’ve never seen anything like it before…”
The previous chapters are set on the present time, and Cas has his grace back. JUST FYI.
*blink*
His words are met with deathly silence.
Both demons step inside the cell, the woman regarding Sam; the man kneels next to Riley, he touches her arm, no reaction. He goes to her neck to feel her pulse.
Riley seems perfectly comfortable sharing all these memories, but Castiel can only worry, because try as he might, he cannot make any connection between him and Riley, there are no memories, not even the faintest hint that corroborates her existence in Castiel’s mind. Which make Cas uneasy, there must be something very wrong with Riley, or she must have done something truly awful to have the memory of her erased from EVERY angel out there. Even though he doesn’t voice his concern, this is clear on his face.
“You know I have an early meeting tomorrow, a-very-important-to-my-future-kind-of-meeting” she says but, she doesn't feel super excited about leaving. Having spent all day in bed, catching up with Game of Thrones and eating pizza, well it was kind of heaven, for Riley at least, she always appreciated the “little things”.
Dean separates slightly from Cas but keeps an arm around the angel’s hip. “Ok, let’s move”.
“I love you” she says quietly.
Did they went bowling last night? Ah yes, a clear memory of them going into the bowling alley is now present in his mind.
Dean feels panic rising, he angles himself to cover the back door, as if he could protect the angel like this.
She stands and quickly exists the room, she needs to clear her head and the air outside is chilly enough for her to do so: just like before, when she was just a human, when she had no idea what she really was, when all this world of the supernatural was just a thing of the books, movies and TV shows that she loved so much she couldn’t put down or stop watching until she had the closure she needed.
Dean has the urge to kick his ass back to hell, but Riley looks intently at him, a warning.
she supposes, but apparently that’s not the case, and sleeplessness is taking a toll on her, and it’s beginning to notice.
Riley laughing while trying to teach Castiel the things every angel should know but Castiel always asking why without missing a beat. Riley regarding Castiel’s concentration face, eyes wide and inquisitive.
Cas’ expression is serious “You were out almost 4 days”
“More demons have been showing up lately, I didn't expect it to happen so quickly; it was never my intention for you to even acknowledge my presence. The night at the bar, I was sure I’d sent them looking for you the other way, when they showed up again, I couldn't leave you there unprotected”. Now she’s uneasy and anxious “It doesn't matter anymore, they caught up with me, they figured out what I was doing, that’s why they attacked me at the same time they came for you at the motel”.
If she concentrates while touching the wings, she can almost feel him, wherever he is… she lets go of the thought instantly to prevent heartache.
Sam sat, once again on the edge of the bed. “Cas, how do you feel? Do you remember what happened last night?”
“Ok, Ri… I’m gonna fuck you now” Jay says a little breathless, now is Riley’s turn to gasp and shiver.
She snaps out of her trance, gasping for air, eyes wide. “Fuck!”
Riley looks at Castiel whose eyes are wide with worry, anger, disbelief, and regret. They don’t have to say anything to each other, and suddenly both are in the town miles away from the bunker.
!”; then she hears her own name in return, she’s just a few feet from Cas, she can feel his energy radiating from where he’s standing, so close, she reaches out with her hand and then, she hears him scream.
“Fine!” Cas quips “It’s no big deal, but still, there are demons around. We’ve been avoiding them, and the bunker has been of great help but-”
There are benches along the deck, and she sees a man sitting there, she keeps walking and as she nears the man, she recognizes the familiar hunch of his shoulders, Dean. He’s looking straight ahead, a few more steps and she notices another figure, Cas, lying down with his head on Dean’s lap.
“In the meantime,” says Castiel, “there are one thousand four hundred churches in between here and Lebanon.”
He thinks of the great flood: all of Earth’s surface submerged beneath’s Chuck’s temper tantrum. He thinks of Dean living under the thumb of John’s core American heteronormative values.
“You aren’t,” says Dean.
Sam shrugs and turns on the television. “Yeah, I guess?”
“Sure thing,” says Castiel, borrowing a colloquialism from Sam, who is looming in the background like he’s trying to shrink. “I trust you.”
“You’re fine,” the nurse says. “You just need to keep physical exertion to a minimum.” With a finger jabbed in Castiel’s direction: “That means
“He’s right.”
“Sure. Yeah, I get that. I’m a prickly sonuvabitch with intimacy issues. I’ve had enough armchair diagnoses from every hunter who’s watched one CBT TedTalk to know that. But at least I’m not selfish like you.” Dean lets his head fall back against the pillow. Crosses his arms, stares at the ceiling. “Every night, Cas. Every night you made me forget. Only
Dean’s never had
“Especially Rhonda Hurley,” Cas says.
“Everyone has the same
And like, he’s not dumb.
“Some do.” Cas meets Dean’s gaze, something heavy in there, and looks away. “I always tried to.”
“Why do we bother coming if you sleep through the whole thing?” Sam asks, doodling sigils in the bulletin.
Dean scowls. He turns over, slinging his arm across Cas’ body. He doesn’t like to let things go unreciprocated. Dean pays his debts. And he can feel how hard Cas is beneath his fancy businessman slacks. He’s dying to hear what kinds of noises Cas would make if— if Dean were to—
Castiel does. He lets his gaze drift over the other Deans in closest proximity to them: one dozing, one doing push-ups, one reading comic books, one making a noose with his belt, one darning socks, one jacking off, one watching the checker match.
Something like a live wire travels up Castiel’s spine and through his limbs, sparking at the edge of his fingers.
“I don’t remember either,” Dean says. A little sulkily: “You take care of that.”
He is trying hard to remember why or how he ended up in this state, it’s obvious he was drunk, if his present hangover is anything to go by.
“Riley, please…”
“What are you saying? That I’m jealous? Of
“Good morning” he announces from the door, his voice gruff.
“Why?” Sam demands
Dean shifts, towering over her, voice deep and threating “Like I said, we don’t know you, you wanna get to Cas, you go through me first”
They turn to her, Dean staring accusingly.
“I’ll die if I tell you”.
“It’s nothing” Sam intercedes, “just some comments you made last night…” but he doesn’t finish because Dean is now furiously blushing from his neck to the tip of his ears, he can’t stop himself; and Sam knows the cat’s out of the bag now.
They know Dean, they know how much Dean really loves Castiel, and they know that Dean is someone who you can’t push to do anything he doesn’t want to do; they’ve known this for as long as each have known Dean.
Dean wakes up with a weak groan, his body feels heavy, too heavy to even sit on the bed, and his head is swirling.
She touches the wings hanging from her necklace, “After listening to the name over and over, I was able to calm myself and started shutting down the voices, well, I picked the ones I wanted to hear; and I had this urge to go somewhere, so I got in my car and drove to some place near Baltimore, where I found my grace. The moment I got it back, the memories started coming back as well; not all at once though, I keep remembering things now. I guess angels have a long life span” she laughs sarcastically.
“How!? What did you do?” Dean is furious, but his eyes are fearful.
“Of course you don’t” Sam says rolling his eyes.
“I helped him” she mumbles.
Cas nods, he fills her in on updates from the boys, and then angel talk. From the moment she joined the group, she’s been able to remember more things thanks to Cas, he’s pretty much telling her about his existence, at least since he can remember; this allows Riley to get back her memories faster and to construct a timeline from the memories she had already gotten prior to meeting Cas. Still, there are gaps Cas can’t fill, and she guesses these gaps are the most important, she knows she needs those memories, but in order to stay sane, she decided to just go with what’s available and not beat herself up too much for the things she still can’t remember. They will come when the time is right, when she needs them, for now, she has to make do with what Cas offers.
“I don’t think I understand your question, Ri. He was punished and he’s to spend the rest of his existence locked in a cage, a cage that no one can open, except God”.
“The scribe of God, he knows a bit more than the rest of us, right? He had a close relationship with Him. He could have at some point gotten more info than he needed.”
The interview that could give her a job, and probably the stability she needed in order to keep building a life with the man she loved, her family and friends, Jay; always in the back of her mind, is Jay, what must he think? What must they all think?
“Castiel’s eyes are soooo blue like the ocean… ooorr the sky… ooorr sapphires. Point is, his are the most magnificent blue eyes I’ve ever seen…” and Castiel turns scarlet, from his neck to his ears.
Dean reached for Cas’s face, turning his head so he would look at him “I promise, angel”
“Oh, oh, good” Dean chuckled. “Well, yes I think extraordinary is the exact word I would use” he noted. “Are you, umm. Are you okay? Did I do something I shouldn’t have? Or…” Dean hesitated.
“Good, I can’t stay here any longer, this needs to happen soon. You already failed me once, do not do it again.”
Riley is quiet for a moment.
“He doesn't even know her! Why would she want to help him!? Unless she wants something from him, or us” Dean growls.
I'm so sorry it took me this long to post an update, but you know life...
Tonight was no different, he fell asleep, this time dreams weren’t better than reality, he woke up after a few hours, he couldn’t sleep anymore so he got out of bed, Sammy was sleeping like a rock, on the other bed. He looked around the room but there was no sign of Cas, he usually took the couch since he was smaller. He noticed the light of the bathroom through the cracks of the closed door. Dean walked around the beds and reached for the door, he turned the knob but the door was locked. Dean tried again, it didn’t budge, his eyebrows furrowed. “Cas?” he called softly. There was no answer.
Riley kisses his neck, then laps with her tongue and starts biting softly, she does this all the way down to his cock, stopping at his nipples to grab them between her teeth and she hears Jay hiss and grunt, then stops again at his hips, and give the same treatment, she kisses everywhere but his cock, she loves to drive him crazy and it works every time. She goes down and opens her lips and takes his balls in her hot mouth, Jay moans and his breath hitches again, she releases his balls and looks up to meet his eyes, once they do, she slides his cock in her mouth until she feels it hit the back of her throat, Jay’s head falls back, hips pushing his cock deeper; Riley pushes his hips back down and hums, sending shivers through Jay’s body and now it’s his turn “Ri… so good… fuck…” between moans and hums and gasps, Jay takes her hair in his hands and guides her and Riley just follows his direction, sucking, lapping the pre come, grazing with her teeth every now and then. Riley drives him to the edge and then his hand closes on her hair and he guides her up for a sloppy kiss.
Riley stares at him “Okeey… What then?”
She sees the boys tied up in the motel room, hears deep voices talking.
I'll try posting the next chapter in a few days, hope you like it. Feedback is always welcome.
“Crowley’s dead” he answers and there’s a beat of silence.
The Impala roars as they drive through the roads, rain pouring down. “Ri, have you remembered anything else?” Sam asks.
“Metatron. Are you sure she doesn’t know?” Lucifer asks trying to sound nonchalant but there is a tinge of fear that Riley could never miss.
Riley is quiet for a few moments, fumbling for the right words.
A laugh booms loudly on the field, Lucifer steps out of the barn, closely followed by Metatron and a group of demons.
Jack didn’t seem entirely convinced but said nothing more.
Now Dean would never let anyone know, but the case was screwing with his head, people dying because of unrequited love, it was just too close to home. Dean, as much as he wanted to ignore it, had feelings for Cas, and they were most definitely
“He’s still bleeding Sammy!” he said, his voice anxious.
The screeching stops at once, they turn to look at Cas, his eyes wide, staring horrifyingly at Riley.
“I cannot ask anyone to sacrifice themselves for us Dean, I need to give up my grace willingly for it to work, I’m ok with that.” Cas states.
“I’m guessing you know something that we don’t, about the demons?” Sam asks.
…………………………………………………………
“I don’t know how, I just knew what I had to do and… I couldn't let you die” Riley explains, glancing at Cas.
Dean waits for her to calm down and says “Ri, this an occupational hazard for us, ya know. We’re used to this… we just gotta figure out a way of getting out of it.”
Castiel continues “Dean, listen, I know this is… this is… uncharted territory, but”
A thunderstorm roars above her head, feet glued to the ground, water droplets landing and running down her face, it’s a dark and cold night. Riley’s face scrunches as she tries to locate the boys, she can barely see a couple of feet in front of her; but her grace lets her feel even the tiniest change in her surroundings. A lightning strike lands a few inches from where she’s standing, illuminating the field where they’re all at. She feels so tired, like she can’t go any further.
This chapter is set a while back in the timeline, when Cas had just lost his grace.
“I want a name” Dean grunts.
…………………………………………………………
“He’s really drunk. I honestly don’t think he’ll remember much of what he said tonight” Castiel answers with an earnest tone.
Cas breaks the kiss, gasping for air, his hands around Dean’s hips holding him close. “Don’t worry Dean. I’ll always come back to you… Just like the ocean, remember?” Cas breathes against Dean’s lips a small smile on his own.
“I’m not going anywhere”
The brothers take opposite directions rounding the place, trying to go undetected, Riley and Cas run after Dean. They all crouch behind another metal scrap that used to be a car. Dean turns to them “Ok, here goes nothing!” Dean catches Cas’ lips again, he kisses him one last time; then he breaks the kiss leaving Cas gasping. He stands and starts running toward the front of the barn.
She finds Cas at the library “What happened with Lucifer?” she blurts out. Cas just stares at her for a beat and opens his mouth “You already know what happened to him”.
, she thinks, before hearing the voice in her head “
A few more days go by. They cover a lot of events while they’re alone at the bunker, not thinking of other cases or demons is definitely a great help. Riley finally understands the fall and Metatron’s involvement in it, she now also knows the role Crowley played on earlier events. She even gets to hear the story of how Cas met the boys.
Jack smiles like a little kid whose dad is proudly commenting on his biggest achievement.
“Cas” he whispered, closing the space between them.
“All these years and it’s been you who have protected the world.” Riley says. “I think He doesn’t get involved because He knows you guys are taking care of it.”
“HEY! SHUT UP MAN!” a furious looking woman yells back when she reaches the cell.
Dean wasn’t showing how drunk he was in the bowling alley, but he is now. He can't walk straight, and Cas is on his side helping him get to the car, Dean is clinging to Cas and nuzzles his head on the crook of Cas’ neck and whispers little things that Jack tries to understand, but honestly can’t, they are meant only for Castiel.
Hope you enjoy.
Dean looked up to him, wonder in his eyes. He saw Cas’ brow furrow while he searched for the right words, and Dean couldn’t stand it any longer.
Sam kills the engine and stays on his seat for a few seconds. He turns to look at Cas, a question on his eyes but he doesn’t voice it out loud, instead looks down at Dean and back at Castiel, the angel with a knowing smile says “Let’s just get him in bed, he needs to rest”.
Dean huffs and runs a hand over his face. He stands up and goes to sit next to Castiel, he takes Cas’ hands with his own and makes Castiel turn to him. “Listen Cas” - he says with a low voice - “I might not remember what exactly I said last night, but I have a really good idea of what it might have been…”
She stands up and goes to find Cas –
Riley takes the phone and holds it between them. “Hello? Dean? Are you guys okay?”
Riley tenses and the brothers frown.
“It can be done, I wrote that spell, myself…” Riley trails off.
“Dean…” Cas insists, sitting up on the bed. Dean drops his hand.
Riley is still processing what Dean just said when she’s hit with a flood of memories, Riley in heaven, a powerful full voice naming His new creation, an angel, Castiel, while Riley smiles to the newest member of the family.
Dean’s slurring now, and Jack doesn’t quiet catch what Dean is saying, he only hears Castiel’s answers:
They get Dean to his bed, and they all go back to their respective rooms to rest.
Her heart starts racing, this is what she needs, the key to unlocking her memories, she somehow knows that it rests with these two, her mind is racing, and she has to slow down and take a few breaths to avoid messing this up. She gets closer and she can hear their conversation now.
Riley sighs “I – I don’t. I can’t remember, I don’t know who I am. I mean, I know who I am, as a human, this body, my name is Riley; but I don’t know who I really am, as an angel”
“It started” Cas breathes “I know where they are, we have to move.”
Castiel can only stare for a few seconds at Riley, and he gives up with a heavy sigh.
“Dean?”
“Sometimes I wonder if we’re more evil than good. We’ve made mistakes, and those mistakes have cost us.” Sam sighs.
There is faint breathing on the other side, a faint “Castiel…” and she recognizes Dean’s gruff voice.
“You know we’re the Winchester, right? We can help.”
“I want to” Cas interrupted, determined.
The spirit wasn’t happy the guys were trying to get rid of it, so she defended herself. The Algea were just a representation after all, so they just had to take care of the spirit. It was Sam, who ultimately finished the job, burning the book. The spirit attacked both Cas and Dean, leaving them in a state of panic, each imagining various ways in which they would lose the other. The spirit attacked people who were in love, so if it wasn’t clear for everyone in the room before, it was clear now, that the hunter and the former angel were very much in love.
She’s able to make out faint voices and starts following them.
Calm washed over Dean, he sighed with relief. “Forgive me, but I’d thought about this moment for a while now, I just want to make sure you enjoyed it as much as I did…”
Dean leaned back; he stared at the angel for a moment, regarding him before descending on him again. His hands were everywhere; he wanted to memorize Cas, every inch of his body. Dean got the hem of Cas’ maroon hoodie and pulled it over his head; then he removed his own jacket. Cas didn’t waste time and pulled him in for a sloppy kiss, urgent now; hands roaming over Dean’s chest, sides and back, exploring. Dean’s hands got to the hem of Cas’ shirt, and he slipped his hands under it, a shudder went through Cas’ body, a moan escaped from his lips, but it was silenced by Dean’s mouth. Dean removed the rest of the clothing, a piece at a time. It was driving Cas crazy, his hips shifting and bucking against Dean’s to get friction; he really had no idea of what was going on, but it seemed that his body knew exactly what it was doing, so he just went with it.
“Okay?” Cas repeated, astonished. “It was extraordinary”. He was beaming.
Cas managed a sad smile. “I’m not an angel anymore. I wouldn’t be in this state if I was”
“Yes, yes, yes… keep going… Jay…” those are the only words she can come up with for now, Jay slides in a finger and she hums, she’s so wet and Jay can’t help it, he takes the finger out, Riley’s about to complain when he turns her on her stomach and orders her to push her ass up, she complies and shivers at the command, she loves when he orders her.
“I’m human now… again, I guess” Riley finishes.
“But nothing” Dean interjects “Sammy and I can take this, it’s just a little run to a near town, we’ll be okay, right Sammy?”
Sam looks at Cas “Are you sure you want to do this?”
Riley looks down, her eyes pooling with unshed tears “The same” she shrugs, trying to sound nonchalant and failing miserably.
“I’m ok, Riley…” he hesitates “You?” he finally asks.
Riley just stares.
“Why don’t you tell us what you know? And how did you find us?” Sam suggests.
She feels pain, she feels as if she’s been burned alive, or skinned… so much pain. She sees a figure and hears a voice
…………………………………………………………
“We must be in the mines, I saw them on the map while we did research for the case, before you came in… Has anyone else come in, have you seen anyone else?”
“Well, I’m not sure, I mean, I’m 23 but I don’t know if I've been here that long. I could have been here longer than that, a lifetime before, two even” she suggests “It sucks not knowing, I keep trying to get back those specific memories, the ones that could help me understand what happened. Why did I fall? How long ago? Maybe I was a bad angel and they cast me out, I honestly don’t know”
“NO SAMMY! NO! I won’t let him do this.” Dean frowns and turns to Cas “I can’t even believe you are considering this. If you say any angel’s grace will do, then call someone else, and ask them to make the sacrifice.” Dean finishes.
Okay, I kinda had writers block for a couple of weeks after I posted the last chapter, which is why it took me so long to finish this. I wrote some stuff here and there but nothing consistent.
His stomach growls for a second time and he decides to get out of bed now, he’s in his boxers and just a t-shirt, he scans the room for his robe, but it’s nowhere in sight; so he just shrugs and comes out of his bedroom and heads for the kitchen, following the sweet smell of a good breakfast.
They boys get on their way leaving the angels behind.
“We can figure it out, but first we have to make sure Cas is ok” Sam says pulling Dean away from the questions burning in his mind now.
“What rumors?” Riley insists.
“How – umm. Was that… okay?” Dean asked, timid.
And since they can’t help it, and it looks like Riley remembers a lot more about the past, they ask her about God.
A beat of silence is followed by a chuckle, low and malicious. “Oh they’re here…” a grave voice speaks “you can come for your pets, we’ll be waiting.” then the phone clicks and the call ends.
…………………………………………………………
“I wanted to learn how to cook breakfast” Jack answers. “So, I asked Sam if he could teach me”.
Riley lifts her fingers and touches the silver angel wings, a thoughtful expression on her face. “I know that, I just, it feels… I don’t know, like an unnecessary risk, if you have us now” she finishes as she waves a hand between Cas and her.
“I said something about you?” Castiel nods. “Something about… us?” Castiel nods again. “I’m guessing it was not something rather than things, right?” Castiel nods again and can’t meet Dean’s eyes.
Dean laughs, deep and throaty. “He gets annoyed when I do things like that, but I love it when he gets annoyed; so I do it in purpose most of the time” he says wiggling his eyebrows.
Now she feels the heaviness of her clothes clinging to her body, but she has to move, she has to find Cas. And just as she’s starting to do so, she hears Cas’ voice above the thunder and crashing of the storm, feels a tinge of energy run through her body, and it turns her cold, not like the cold of a storm or that of a really bad winter, this is something she’s only felt a few times before in her entire existence, and as hard as she wants to fight, there’s nothing else to do. She regains control of herself and focuses on the mission, willing her vessel to move, and she screams his name… “
She’s sitting on a chair, her limbs tied up, she can’t move; she hears murmurs –
“I remember him” she confesses. “I don’t even know my own name, but I remember him. I even dreamed of him while I was still human.”
“Okay, okay” Sam puts his hands up, backing away, he’s still smiling though.
Lucifer only regards him, there is doubt in his eyes, and something in Riley’s mind clicks, Lucifer’s eyes immediately find hers, she’s stunned at the sudden change in her surroundings, the darkness starts crumbling down on her, the last thing she sees is Lucifer smiling at her.
“Yes, Sam. I… I can’t feel it anymore… I can’t…” her fingers touch the angel wings, and unlike every other time she’s done so in the past, this time, she doesn’t feel anything, she feels emptiness, just a pair of cold metal wings.
?” he frowns.
A sudden commotion erupts from the cells, a couple of demons run towards the screams.
Cas and Riley look at each other, defeated. Castiel clears his throat “There might be a way we can stop this…” the boys turn to him, Cas turns to Riley, Riley frowns and looks down to hide the tears threatening to fall from her eyes. “I’m not sure about how the spell Metatron is planning to use works exactly, but we know a spell that can close the gates to hell and to the cage… it’s sort of a panic button, last resource type of thing…” Cas trails off.
Cas cut him off. “Dean, it was perfect. All of it, I …” he huffed a laugh. He turned to him “You are perfect.” Cas’ tone was serious, but his eyes were glinting, he smiled at Dean playfully.
“Are you ok!?” Dean asks frantic.
Well hello again, since i got my inspiration back, I finished the next chapter rather quickly.
Cas keeps looking at her wearily.
. Now it’s too late.
Riley falters, a few memories crossing her mind. “I don’t know, we have to hurry” she looks out of the barn, where the brothers are trying their best not to die.
None of these makes her feel any better, if anything, she’s getting worse.
Sam reaches for his brother’s arm “Dean, calm down. She helped him, she helped us”.
The trip back was quiet, and the boys started to relax a bit. Not for long though.
Before they can continue, Cas starts coughing, Dean shots up from the chair and crosses the room in a few long strides, he seems worried.
Metatron stammers “No… no, no sir. There is no way she can know. We made sure to erase everything.”
Riley grabs the demon’s hand and twists it while she lands her right fist in the middle of his face. Sam lurches at the woman and knocks her down, silencing her.
“So big sister duty…”
Jack laughs because he feels more comfortable now that Dean seems to have loosen a bit, while Sam only sighs and covers his face with his hands… this is gonna be a long night, he thinks.
Sam turns to face Dean now, he sighs “You know why”.
They regroup at the library. Dean and Cas are standing as close as possible while Sam and Riley are going over the plan.
The demon burst out laughing “Crowley? You really have no idea” he mocks them.
“It must be the shards of angel blade, I don’t know if it’s enough to kill him, but enough to stop him, he wasn’t the target anyway, we were. We need a place to work this out, if the angel blade is preventing his body from healing, we need to get it out”.
“Where is Crowley?” Dean asks.
This chapter focuses on how Dean and Cas' friendship finally evolved into a romantic relationship and something else, I guess... You know what I'm talking about ;)
“There is… I…” Riley frowns “I don’t know how I know this, no one should know about that spell, except me… and God.”
“What?” Dean asks, startled.
The woman nods, “You” she turns to Sam “step aside, facing the wall”.
“I know you don’t remember what you said last night, and it’s okay. No one will hold you accountable for anything” Castiel says with a serious face.
“Past 3 PM” Cas answers.
“I know Dean.” Castiel cuts him off a bit annoyed. “I know you don’t want me to do this, but it’s the only way.”
She feels a hand on her arm, “We need to go.” Cas says drily, he can barely stand. Cas raises his hand, a light radiates from Cas, taking care of the remaining demons. Riley sees Metatron disappear. In the blink of an eye, they’re all back at the bunker, Cas collapses on the floor, Dean reaches for him as best as he can, they’re both injured.
“It was a bomb” Sam says, speaking for the first time since the girl appeared, “Cas tried to protect us, there was angel blade on the bomb, we think the shards inside his body are preventing him from healing”.
Dean looks at her, she looks like she’s hurt as well; he moves backwards, eyes never leaving her, and opens the door. The girl closes the distance in quick strides and kneels, both hands moving to cradle Cas’ face. She looks up at Dean then, a questioning look. “What happened?” she says, demanding.
Dean glowers at him, the tips of his ears turning red. “Sammy” he warns.
“I hope you’re not leaving, I brought breakfast” he scolds, cocking an eyebrow.
“Angel blade?” Cas hesitates, eyes wide with alarm. “What do you mean?”
after all. They had plans, they had dreams and goals, and now she has nothing, no one.
The boys and the angels fall into a routine, that soon become a reassuring familiarity.
Riley and Dean follow Cas to the library where Sam is looking at a table full of books, maps, scrolls, etc.
over and over, and feel his angel smile against his lips, then hearing him sigh, content, and respond ‘
“Sorry guys, but I didn’t finish my breakfast, and honestly I’m starving. Also, I don’t think wherever that” - and he motions towards them - “was going to is apt for a kitchen room, you should move to your bedroom… you know, lock the door and all that.”
Jack reaches the table with a pot of coffee and mugs, bringing Sam back from his reverie, he seats next to Cas; and they all eat for a few moments in comfortable silence, enjoying their meal.
After they cleaned themselves up and put on fresh clothes, they came out of the bathroom. Sam handed them bags with burgers and fries, Dean’s favorites. Sam appeared to be in a good mood, smiling at both his brother and the angel. He never brought up the subject, for Sam, it was something that had been settled long before it even occurred. He was just happy they were all okay, and his brother had finally told the angel what Sam knew Dean had felt for him, for a long time.
The pain is gone, she’s exhausted.
Riley smiles up at him with fondness. “Ok, then.”
Cas was regarding him, visibly alarmed. “I don’t think I could handle something like that. I couldn’t handle loosing you… or Sam…”
………………………………………………………………….
“Maybe, but Metatron wants revenge for what happened to him as well.
Riley remembers a bit of her past both from her human and angel life.
Sam regards her for a few seconds “Ri, you heard Metatron say he couldn’t kill you.”
“It’s okay”
*blink*
“It’s not a big deal” Dean says firmly, looking into Cas’ blue eyes.
Riley has slept a lot these days, which is good, she feels better now, stronger, she’s wondering about her condition, if this is just and adjustment period to become full angel or if it’s going to be like this all the time. She hopes it’s the former, because how things look right now, they’re in the middle of a war, and she’s gonna need all her strength if she wants to end this on the winning side.
“Ugh, awful, I need caffeine and carbs.” Dean answers. “Hey so, who won last night?… I, uhh…  don’t really remember much of the night, or how we got home. Sam, you drove, right? Is my Baby okay? I hope she is, cause you know I”
Dean hated waking up right after having these dreams, because he felt hope and love, and then reality came crashing down and he felt hollow; the feeling of burying his face on Cas’ neck, still fresh in his mind, but unattainable.
Castiel, in turn, is just trying to keep it together, while glancing nervously between Sam and Dean. “Um, I guess, I can try to show you” he says finally to Jack.
Dean finally let Cas lie down on the bed, while he got some food; Dean was afraid of leaving Cas alone, but Cas insisted he was feeling better. They had breakfast and Cas watched TV, while Dean went through Sam’s laptop. He’d been reading about Cameron and Jillian.
As hunters, Sam and Dean had learned to cover their tracks and stay off the grid and one step ahead in every way possible, so how had the demons come upon their location? It seemed safe enough, they had been careful, as always. It didn’t matter now, things had gone horribly wrong. Demons outsmarted them this time, setting up a bomb, to kill them. But of course Cas would never let that happen, what he didn’t anticipate was that the bomb had angel blade shards, and now Cas wasn’t healing properly, more like not healing at all.
“It’s not the trip that worries me” she says calmly “I just don’t think it’s a good idea for you guys to go alone”
Jack followed Sam. Sam began explaining the game to Jack, while pointing at other players while they throw a ball on their respective lanes, he explains that he has to try and knock over as many pins on each turn, the pins that are knocked over count as points, and the person who has more points by the end of the game is the winner.
On their third night there, the boys went to a bar, Sam had his computer and was trying to pull some files from de police department about the cases, Dean was eating and he noticed Cas was quiet, hunched, staring at the table. Dean reached out a hand and placed it on Cas shoulder.
“I have to go” Riley blurts out, she turns her head a little, looking for a way out, which is stupid, she could just vanish, but her human body still responds to its instincts, self-preservation is a priority for humans. She straightens up, and forces herself to stay where she is.
“Orders” he says breathing heavily. “They sent me for the angel” he gruffs.
Riley stays quiet.
She gets out of bed and goes to take a shower, she looks at her reflection in the mirror, this is not something she does often nowadays, she doesn’t like what’s staring back at her; not much has changed in her features, but she looks tired, she wonders how it is possible to have changed so little yet so much; the silver angel wings are the only thing she’s got left from her previous life, her fingers automatically reach the wings and touch them, she feels a tinge of love, still there from everyone in her life, from Jay.
“I’m surprised” Dean says and Riley looks at him, her brow furrowed as Dean continues “I thought gravitating towards Cas was my thing, but it seems you do that as well”
Dean shifted behind him. “Don’t apologize, this wasn’t you… was it?” Dean asked, alarmed.
“I know what he said, but apparently, it can’t be done.” Metatron huffs. “we’ll just have to tell him to take care of her once he’s released… I cannot kill her, I tried everything. DO NOT let anyone else know about this, or you’ll be sitting in that chair next.”
“Umm, you know how Dean is, he doesn’t like to talk about certain stuff with everyone.” continues Sam.
“No, not them, they’re fine, I talked to them last night”
Metatron looks scared, as he should if he knows what Lucifer is capable of.
Cas clears his throat, trying to break the uncomfortable silence. “Sam might have found something; he needs to talk to us.”
Sam and Riley join them while Cas extends his left arm to put around Riley’s hip, his right arm over Dean’s back, holding onto his shoulder. Dean and Riley extend and arm each for Sam to take, and as soon as everyone is linked Castiel shuts his eyes. Nothing happens.
”, makes her insides twist, back then it was a simple jab, now, the word is foul, she has to stop thinking about this.
“Morning, demon” Riley murmurs back, and she can hear a faint devilish chuckle while Jay buries his face on Riley’s hair.
She’s quiet.
“I fucking love you, angel” he smiles while kissing her back, she smiles back even though she can’t see him.
“Okay, well; what would you have me do?” she demands. “Anything or anyone could be here right now, about to kill us. And as I said…” she points to Cas “he is my responsibility, and since it seems you two are his, I’m not letting ANYTHING happen to ANYONE. Are we clear?”
“What exactly happened last night? What did I say?” he asks wearily.
“Sam… Are you ok? Where’s Dean? Cas?”
Riley sits on the edge of the bed, watching over Cas. Dean hands her a cup of coffee and sits at the little table across from Sam, both facing her.
Riley keeps her eyes on him, steady.
“Don’t know, but when it happens, he will unleash hell on earth, the final battle. He wants to fulfill what was written; and to do so, he must free the angels, and they won’t have mercy.
*blink*
“I don’t know Dean, I don’t know what’s going on; all these demons coming out of nowhere, what if the witches were a trap?”
“Okay, well; is there something special this year? I mean you say it’s just been a couple of suicides at a time. We’re investigating at least 10 right now. And it doesn’t seem like it’ll stop soon”
“They know we’re onto them, they are been extra careful, they can’t have us storming in before they open the gates” Riley whispers.
…………………………………………………………….
The silence stretches between them for what it feels like an eternity.
“I didn't want you to know. I thought I could handle it, and I wanted to keep them away from you, I need to keep you safe” she says looking earnestly at Cas. “I don’t remember a lot of things, but I do know that my job is to protect you” she laughs “I felt the need to protect everyone around me when I was human, I couldn't help but feel something or rather someone was missing. That is, until I heard your name. Suddenly, I knew I had to find you, I was able to control myself. I knew what I had to do”.
“Yeah, almost 4 days, I didn’t want to disturb you, since I know you’ve been having trouble sleeping. But after your second day in a row, I got worried, I didn’t barge in because I could still feel your grace, I knew you were still alive, at least” Cas says this with seriousness but hearing that last part makes Riley laugh, the absurdity, the thought of her having
“I hate not being able to remember…" Riley trails off with clear disdain in her voice.
Sam and Riley help they boys up and to their beds, they tend their wounds and let them rest.
“Angel blade” the girl breaths, as if unable to say more.
After a few seconds, Dean raises his head and looks Cas dead in the eye “No.”
“Oh!” Cas breathed. “Of course I did, I’d never experienced anything like it before. I see now, why this is a big deal down here” he mused, blushing; a shy smile on his lips.
“No…” Riley sighs “They took my grace…”
*blink*
I like going back and forth with the story, so this is just some background on our mystery girl.
Cas turns to Riley words rushing “Riley, you have to promise, you’ll take care of them, you’ll get them out of here, even if I can’t make it…”
But the smell of freshly brewed coffee and… is it, pancakes?, fills his nose; as if on queue his stomach growls, so he doesn’t have much of a choice, but to get out of bed.
Was the demon referring to Riley? Who else could it be? She was there, they had sent him there, and she was his mission. But who was looking for her? Who could believe she was dangerous? She was an angel just like so many others living on Earth right now. But dangerous? She though that was crazy talk. Afraid of the only angel who couldn’t remember their own name…
Cas had been an angel, and angels weren’t supposed to feel, let alone fall in love with humans, and that was all Dean was, a human. Even if an angel could fall in love, even now that Cas was human, there was no way he could fall for Dean; he was too damaged, there was nothing he could offer Cas, even if he tried, he was just a broken soul, not even a whole human, not after going through hell and purgatory.
Twist and shout fans, I love you.
The demon tries to keep his cool but it’s clearly fading.
“Is he going to be okay?” Jack asks a little worried now.
Jay goes down on her, his oral game is A++++, according to Riley, she opens herself for him and grabs his hair in her hands, sometimes brushing, sometimes pulling; her back arches and the moans don’t stop, Jay slides in his tongue and Riley gasps.
She veers to make her way out, when the bathroom door opens, and Sam walks out, turning his attention to her; he stops, regarding her with wary eyes, his hands going up a little as if not to scare her.
Cas looked up at him, a serious expression on his face but his eyes were sad. “Yes, of course” is all he said. He then turned to Sam and started questioning him about some of the evidence. Dean didn’t push the issue, but he thought it was strange, Cas and the boys had been on really good terms for a while now, all of them forgiven for previous mistakes, they were family after all.
Cas just stares “I suppose it’s possible…” he muses “…but why would he help Lucifer? He was a dick to everyone, but he was an even bigger dick to Metatron.”
She feels sick at the thought, it’s selfish, she knows, to think of Jay like this, like he could not be with anyone but her, he was
She’s looking at them, searching for something. Sam and Dean exchange a look, then they both get out of the car.
The door opens to a big room and they see Dean strapped to a chair, a demon next to him a knife on his hand sliding on the side of Dean’s arm; the chair is facing an operating table, Cas strapped to it, Metatron hovering over Castiel, a scalpel on his right hand, a vial on the left. Riley sees red.
“RILEEEEEY!!!!!”
Dean couldn’t stop now “I fucking love you, okay!? And it drives me crazy, every time I’m with you I just… you’re my angel, you saved me, and I know I’m fucked up, after everything I’ve done, I know I can’t offer you something better, I wish I could, because you deserve better, you deserve everything and I can’t…” tears were streaming down freckled cheeks.
*****
Cas and Sam know all this, and have an unspoken agreement on the matter; to let Dean do his thing, on his own terms on his own time. No rush, no pressure.
“Dean” Cas said.
Cas’ eyes were unfocused, he hadn’t move since Sam started talking. Dean shifted so he could look at him. “What?” he asked.
Dean is busy trying to hide his face and he feels his cheeks flaming, but Cas waits until Dean meets his eyes.
“Thanks for helping me remember, at least now I know exactly why I’m here”
She tries sidestepping him but she can’t, they back her up against the wall, she should have stayed at Jay’s, she won’t see him again, or her parents or her friends; then she stops, she can’t think like this, the guys are hovering over her now, only shadows and noise, one of them grabs her by her arm. She wants to scream but nothing comes out, and then, there’s a light, and heat radiating from somewhere, she can’t think about it, she just wants to get out of there. The light is blinding, the guys are freaking out now, they don’t know what’s going on either. Riley feels warm inside, she can’t stand the light it’s too bright, she takes a breath and then nothing.
“Sorry pretty boy, don’t know”
Castiel calling her… calling her, and she can almost hear the name, her real name, but she doesn't.
After an interminable assault to his hipbones, Cas felt Dean’s head hovering over his cock, he opened his eyes and turned to see Dean as he took him in his mouth. Cas’ head hit the pillows, back arching from the bed, hips pressing up; he felt Dean’s hand pushing over his hips, holding him in place. Wet heat enclosing his now throbbing dick, he felt Dean bobbing his head up and down at a slow pace at first, sucking and kissing, he’d hummed every now and then, which sent a shiver through Cas’ body and make his cock twitch. Cas’ hands flew to Dean’s head, and ran his fingers through Dean’s hair, fists closing around the soft dirty blond strands. Dean picked up the pace and uncovered his teeth just a bit, grazing over the sensitive skin, tongue lapping on the underside of his cock, and pressing against the slit. Cas could feel something building up in his belly, his breath hitching. “Dean… please…” his voice shaky.
“Why don’t you shut you cakehole and go get us some food, bitch” Dean counters while parking baby at the gas station.
Riley turns the knob to the motel room, regretting it instantly as she turns to Cas and wants to scream at him to get the hell out of dodge.
By now Dean’s hands have moved up to Castiel’s neck and he runs a hand through his hair, and Castiel is now clinging to Dean’s broad shoulders and…
“It won’t happen, sir.”
“Now!” Riley hisses “Move!” Riley and Cas run around to the side of the barn, their eyes flickering to Dean while they make their way.
“It’s fine, we asked more out of curiosity than anything else. From our experience, He doesn’t want to be found, and He won’t get in the way of what’s happening or who’s making it happen” Sam sighs heavily and gives a half hearted smile.
She starts crying, she cries while she takes her shower, she cries for the life she left behind, the people, the plans, the future, she cries for her former life which she can’t remember completely, she cries for Cas not having any recollection of her and for every other angel for that matter, making this journey all the more difficult. She cries for all the times she couldn’t cry because she was in front of the boys, she cries for the exhaustion, for the desperation, for the weight she’s now carrying with her, keeping Cas and the Winchester safe, she cries because it’s a lot, because she doesn’t feel ready for any of it, because she thinks she’s not enough… she cries until she can’t shed a single tear anymore.
“He’s dying, isn’t he?” It’s Dean this time, a look of pure horror and pain in his features.
Also, I want to thank to the peeps who stayed tuned with this one (if you still are, I hope).
“Get on all fours” Jay orders and Riley does, she almost comes again just from hearing Jay’s voice, “Such pretty ass…” Jay hums, Riley’s filled with arousal “I’m gonna wreck it” Jay’s hand comes down hard on her right butt cheek and her body recoils a bit as she pants. “I’ll have to punish you for your comments earlier” he spanks her left side now and gets the same reaction from Riley. Jay caresses her cheeks for a bit, Riley begs “Please, punish me…”. Jay smiles and bites down on her ass making her jump and squeal. “You’ve been naughty, angel” spank. “Coming down here to play with this demon” spank. “Such a pretty face, if only people knew…” spank. “My own pandora’s box… of kink” spank.
Dean opposes at first, but since he’s outnumbered, he resigns and follows the others to the front desk to get their shoes back, Sam pays for the service and they’re on their way.
Dean sighed, “I don’t know man, honestly. I … we’ve lost a lot of people, our family; you just have to find the strength to go through it and move on”
“You have no chance this time” he spats.
They lay there for a few minutes, kissing lazily, talking in hushed tones and laughing softly; whispering I love you’s in between. Dean heard the Impala pulling on the front. He helped Cas to his feet, kissed him and led him to the shower.
“CAS!... SAM!... DEAN!”
“I don’t owe you anything” she counters, exasperated, turning around and reaching for the door. But she’s too late, the door swings open, revealing Dean in the doorway, a look of surprise crosses Dean’s face, his eyes focusing on the girl.
“Look we don’t know who you are, and you showing up to help us at the right time, don’t get me wrong, we appreciate it, but it’s a little suspicious. So, why don’t you just tell me who you are and what you’re after. You owe us at least an explanation”.
Dean keeps quiet, and tries to say something, he opens his mouth and closes it, twice; but nothing comes out.
“Shut up, Sammy!” Dean says his cheeks in flames again, but he doesn’t seem really bother by his brother’s comments.
…………………………………………………………
“I love you, angel” he says as he slides a hand from her face to her neck, resting over the pair of wings that hang from her necklace.
“Sometimes, I wonder how his wings look like… they must be so graceful…”
Sam snorts “Are you sure that’s all it is?”
They boys look at each other with sheepish grins on their faces. Dean is definitely enjoying this, he’s not used to Castiel NOT getting his way, Cas can be a rebel against any angel in the garrison, but he won’t speak against Riley for the life of him.
Riley listens to the defeat and remorse in Dean’s voice. “Don’t” Riley counters. “It’s not you, this is about me, I’m responsible, I got you into this mess, I’m sorry…” Riley trails off as tears begin to fall from her eyes, tears that try as she might, she can’t hold back, not this time. Riley cries, unmoving, in front of Dean. Dean is quiet while Riley sobs uncontrollably.
“Cas, baby?” he whispers, sitting on the bed.
” he counters firmly.
Hope you enjoy this one.
They’re hiding behind old cars, the place is pretty much a dumpster, but it’s crawling with demons, they take out as many as they can as they make their way forward. The barn is radiating with energy, angel energy. “The gates were opened inside the barn…” Sam remarks.
Even though now Dean is a little drunk, his game is still perfect, and he keeps on knocking all the pins in each turn, to Jack’s, and honestly to Sam’s amazement as well. Sam knows Dean’s always been good at bowling, also, is one of the activities that he enjoys the most, not like he plays it much though; for how they were brought up, pool was something that was fun and an easy way to make money, so that’s what both brothers concentrated on while growing up, bowling was just fun, and fun was not something you did regularly while on business.
Castiel speaks this time “And the answer is yes, Dean, you won. Jack almost caught up with you though, he got really good after a few tries”.
Before she can give it more thought, Cas shifts where he’s laying and he opens his eyes to find Dean staring down at him. “Morning sunshine” he chirps and looks up to where Riley is standing, but she's gone.
He remembers watching Castiel play, teasing Sam on his technique, and him and Jack talking, although he has no idea what on earth he and Jack would have talked about.
Riley seems to know Metatron well, when she’s asked for a description, she recalls his behavior perfectly, and remembers the change he had once he was finished with the tablets.
Between the roaring thunder and the dust around them, the team is lost. Riley starts screaming names, trying to find the brothers and the angel.
“I’m good, Cas. I just… I guess I needed it, it’s been a while. But I’m ok now, I promise.” Riley states.
Sam looks at Castiel and then at Riley who is sitting at the table. “Yeah guys, don’t worry, we got this”
…………………………………………………………
“Demon, huh?... maybe we should find out…” Jay trails off as he begins to kiss Riley’s neck, Riley can only laugh, that is until Jay slides the hand he has around her hips downward, Riley gasps as Jay’s adept fingers touch the right spot…
, Riley thinks to herself,
…” Dean closes the space between them and kisses Cas with no reservations. He doesn’t care his brother and the former angel are right there in front of them, he kisses Cas like his life depends on it, like it’s the last time he’ll taste those full lips in this lifetime… that might be the case.
“Um, so I’m guessing you’re an angel.” Sam’s brows go up a little.
Riley can’t stay awake, she drifts off. Dean does not speak anymore or if he does, she can’t hear him.
“If you wanted to leave, you’d be gone already” Cas interjects.
Riley is relieved by that, and thinks it’d be best if she tells them about what she saw through the doors once they’re together. Her mind is racing trying to find any piece of info she can use to make the connection with the Lucifer-Metatron convo.
Sam and Castiel glance over at him with warning looks to take it easy on Jack.
Angels do as they’re told, and that is that. No questions asked, no explanations of any kind, they get the job done.
Suddenly Lucifer stands his face full of wrath. Dean’s eyes flicker again to the entrance of the barn, a glint in his eyes. He fires another round of shots from his other pistol, straight into Lucifer’s chest, Lucifer walking up to him as he does so, not stopping when the bullets hit his body. Sam is running to help his brother and is met by Metatron who makes Sam fall to his knees as he chokes, an invisible force around his neck.
They all turn to look at Cas, Cas tries again… nothing.
, she thinks. Hey, don’t blame her for trying, they boys still can’t figure out what her deal is, having her grace back but still having human needs…
“I found something” Sam interrupted him, while working on Cas’ bandages. “There was a suicide about 80 years ago, Cameron Ackerman, came from an accommodated family and was in love with Jillian Holt, she was like the most beautiful girl in town; unfortunately Jillian had been promised to a man of a very wealthy family, and so, they couldn’t be together, even though according to some of Cameron’s letters to Jillian, they were very much in love and were even planning to run away together. Before they could do that though, Jillian’s parents sent her away to the family of the man she was going to marry…”
Suddenly, Jay grabs her by the neck first his fingers closed around lightly and Riley opens her eyes, when she looks down, Jay’s face changes, from awe to a devilish smirk, and Riley knows she’s in for a ride. Suddenly Jay squeezes her neck and she starts gasping for air, Jay drives her back down to the mattress in an instant and Riley is in a haze, she loves when Jay gets a bit rough and she smiles up at him. He looks down “Looks like I’m gonna make an angel fall from grace” he smirks again, Riley grabs Jay’s clothed cock a smirk on her face, “looks like angels like me can come down here and play with demons”, Jay’s breath hitched as he looked down to where Riley’s hand starts moving up and down Jay’s length, he looks back up “
The guys just gape at her, incredulous.
Castiel and Riley sit at the table and they talk. For the first time really talk about everything and anything angel related. Riley tells Castiel about the memories she got back a few weeks ago while walking in the woods. How she remembers Cas from the day he came to be, the things they learned and did.
“Because it’s fun, that’s why.” comes the gruff voice of Dean.
Castiel looking up at Riley, with a small smile that would melt anyone’s heart, but not Riley’s of course, Riley is an angel after all, and angels can't get attached to anyone or anything.
“Cas, baby, you do remember I’m here to take care of you guys, right? And with all the crazy shit you come across, it’s not an easy feat, so I can’t leave you on your own for too long” Riley says laughing.
“There was a loud noise, like a crash, Dean Is not answering” Cas hurries.
Yes, the whole thing was more than a little shady, but her, a danger? To the people or whatever who were trying to open the cage? What in the universe could she possibly know that would get them nervous?
Dean was frantic. “WHAT THE HELL, CAS!?” he screamed as he took the blade from his hand and threw it away.
“Who is ‘they’?” Dean asks again
Riley isn´t sure if its all the time she’s spending with the boys working cases or just part of her routine now, but she keeps waking up at all times at night because of the nightmares, and this wouldn’t be a problem, hell she wouldn’t even need to sleep…if she was a
As they reach the starting point Riley turns to Sam “If we go that way, we’re gonna face a lot of demons, Sam…” Sam stares at her “… I don’t have my powers anymore, if something happens to me, please just go, try to get out if you can.” Riley whispers.
It wasn’t really Dean’s intention to sound mean to the kid; it’s just that sometimes that kid really gets on his nerves.
“Darkness is in all of us, some act on it, others act against it, but whatever the reason we take control of it. What we do, those are our decisions, decisions that build our characters, that shape our lives, that give us purpose and a path to follow. It may not be easy, but you know in your hearts that it’s right. You may think that you’re a necessary evil, but when I see you, all I see is light, and a drive to change things, to make a difference.” Riley states. “Maybe God thinks that you can change things, that you can learn to be better. Maybe this was His plan for you all along. Maybe He thinks that for now, you are enough”.
“No, Castiel. That is out of the question. I'm not letting you sacrifice yourself,
“The boys…” Riley says
Riley sighs, defeated “It’s a long story you might want to sit down”
Dean frowns “You can’t?
*blink*
orgasm, her body writhing every now and then for a while after, they both smile. After a few minutes, Riley is on top of Jay, Jay laughing at her eagerness, she’s always like this…
Cas sits on the bed, he looks tired; Sam and Riley drag the demon and tie him to a chair. Dean goes around the room. “Cas” he crouches in front of the angel, placing a hand on his knee “are you hurt?”
This is how it’s always been with them, day and night, opposites that found the balance they needed, complementing each other perfectly, well almost. Any human relationship is complicated but as long as both parties want to work for it, fight together against their issues instead of fighting one another, if they both love the other more than they love their own ego or pride, that’s when things work out, and that’s what they have.
Riley feels heavy, her body not responding, her mind barely registers her surroundings, she murmurs something but it’s incomprehensible.
“Yeah…” Sam continued “Except Cameron was also a girl. They started spending too much time together and people of the town noticed, Jillian’s parents wanted to get her as far away from Cameron as possible, so they found a suitable man for her. Anyway, Cameron was found dead on her room, she um… she stabbed herself with a dagger, right through her heart. She explained on her last letter to Jillian, she no longer care for it, since it had always and will always belong to her. I found the letters on the library site, Cameron’s family was one of the founding families of the town, so they keep record of them.”
Riley tells them everything she remembers, her name is Riley Harrington, she’s 23 years old, she was a student at University of Massachusetts Amherst. She tells them she remembers every possible thing from her human life, and how she was attacked one night while walking to her apartment, almost a year ago. She had woken up minutes later, after seeing a bright white light, she remembers freaking out when she heard voices in her head, hundreds of voices and she couldn’t make them stop. She then saw her attackers on the floor, their eyes were burned out. The only thing that kept her from losing her mind was the name that was repeating, non-stop. “
“So, you were following us” Dean counters, visibly upset.
, Dean thinks. The girl locks eyes with him. “Where is he!?” she sounds tired but determined, and most of all worried.
This time, he heard a faint “Dean”.
“And you somehow still mess it up, you’re useless” Lucifer counters.
“Who sent you?” Sam insists.
She snaps her head toward the voice and sees a figure in the dark, she stares for a few seconds trying to assess the situation. She’s finally able to recognize the figure.
“Thank you” he says “for helping Cas, and for helping us, the other day at the bar.”
She thinks of all the plans, she thinks of their future together, it’s about to start, they can almost taste it; and yes, having that hope for their future, their jobs, their lives, their adventures, it’s amazing, but this moment, this is what she’s always loved the most, just the two of them in an embrace, before they have to face the real world, this state in between the simple things in life and the heaviness of modern living. Riley tries as hard as she can to mark this memory on her brain, to tattoo it if that is possible; she lays there waiting for Jay to wake up, minutes pass and she’s almost falling back asleep when the arm around her tightens again, and a quiet yawn comes from behind her.
Dean responded to Cas’ movements, a hand rubbing his cock through the boxers, Cas was hard. Dean alternated between kissing Cas open mouth, and going for his neck, teeth grazing the skin, sucking on his pulse, leaving tiny bruises along Cas’ collarbone. Cas was frantic, touching and holding on to Dean as if his life depended on it, moans, gasps and sighs coming out of his full lips every time Dean started a different task over his body.
The brothers huff a laugh at the same time, and Riley smiles because it makes her feel home, nostalgic; they really know each other well.
Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing, “I love you” Dean whispered against Cas’ mouth, lips almost brushing, he chuckled “I have loved you since the moment you carry my sorry ass back from hell”.
“I- I don’t mean to” and her voice gets higher towards the end, and it sounds like a question.
They hunters and the angel get to know more about their rescuer. Riley is still a little shady and Dean doesn't like that.
“Pretty sure you always knew” Dean says.
The man standing behind the first demon steps closer to the cell. “I need to report this.” Riley, who’s lying on the floor playing dead, recognizes the voice, it’s the same voice she had heard talking to Metatron about her, about not been able to kill her.
“Can´t hear you...” Sam pushes the blade a bit.
I know it's been way too long but, I had some ideas and well, here we are.
“We’ll see” Dean mutters and drives the blade through the demon’s chest.
The brothers exchange a look, worry and mistrust visible. “So, why are you helping us?” Dean grumbles.
Dean was flushed against Cas’ body, his mind racing. He wanted to take Cas and fuck him into the mattress until Cas was crying out his name and coming undone beneath him. But Cas had been a human for just about 2 months, this was Cas’ first time so Dean willed himself to take it slow and make his angel enjoy every second of it.
Jack manages a quiet good morning as well, but returns his concentration to the stove immediately.
On the small nightstand, there is a bottle of water and 2 aspirins, because of course there would be; placed by either his brother or his angel, he thinks… the angel, he corrects himself, he’s not mine…
“It is the family business” Dean continues “but I’m tired, we’ve been doing this for a long time, it’s a burden we’ve been carrying for so long, and I’m tired.” he says sincerely, and you can see the pain and anger behind those green eyes. Riley looks at him and thinks those eyes used to be full of light and wonder before getting involved with the supernatural; so much promise, but here they are, talking in a crappy motel room, drinking cheap booze.
Dean’s eyes widen in surprise, and Sam sighs, long and deep, so much for pretending…
When I sat down and started working again, I was afraid the chapter would be too short, then I got a bit carried away, because the ideas started coming and I couldn't stop writing, so there you go.
“So what?” says Dean without missing a beat. “Don’t need to be forgiven for saying that the angel is beautiful, do I? I mean, he is truly gorgeous, isn’t he, Jack?”
“Hi there” he says “we didn't know how long you’d be out”
“You know God could have prevented a lot of catastrophes from happening, a lot of people from getting killed” Dean counters, visibly upset.
“I love you, Dean Winchester” he announced, a little breathless. “You are the most beautiful soul I’ve ever laid eyes on. The things you do, you do for others. You’re always taking care of everyone, but you never let anyone take care of you. And you tell me I don’t deserve you?” Cas reached for Dean, a hand cupping his face, “You are everything to me. Everything”.
Riley turns slowly, Dean is regarding her, she walks a few steps forward and sees Cas, sleeping peacefully, she laughs lightly.
Sam was shocked; he knelt beside him, passing a towel.
“Dean…” Cas wonders with a husky voice, eyes searching until he finds Dean’s face. Dean takes Cas hand between both of his, eyes worried. Cas just smiles at him, it’s a weak smile but it’s enough to pull one out from Dean.
The boys should be back by now, she thinks, she goes out of her room, and makes her way to the kitchen; no one around but she’s starving so might as well serve herself. After a while, Cas shows up “Hey!”, Riley looks back “Hey! I’m not sure what time it is, but I’m starving so…”
“Or maybe she was and she’s changing her story to get our sympathy” Dean grunts, rolling his eyes.
“You heard them Cas, they’re big boys, they can take care of themselves. And if they run into trouble they’ll call” she finishes.
Sam takes the keys from Dean’s jacket and drives home.
The demon is in agonizing pain and starts mumbling stuff here and there.
By the end of the week, the guys had managed to stop the spirit of Cameron from continuing the killing spree. It turned out that a relative had just moved back to town, and she had carried some family stuff from her previous house, amongst the paintings and jewelry, they found Cameron’s diary.
It’s been 2 and a half years since they met, they shared a class right on their first semester at college, it didn't feel like something too important at first, but hey, Jay was sweet, funny, kind of a smart ass, and the worst, he was a little shy at first, which only made him more adorable. But what struck Riley about him was his response to her, he would never back down from a sarcasm contest, he would even start them, just to annoy her and see her roll her eyes, but she loved it. Also they had these really complex discussions about anything, from how the governments are ruling their countries, to who’s a better couple from the Avengers, they settle on a tie with Steve and Bucky, and, Natasha and Clint; you can feel the sexual tension pouring from them.
“Right” Dean says “well, I’m glad the kid had a good time.” he smiles and takes a sit.
“No idea, man. They took her grace, she’s done for anyway, maybe just a matter of time”
More silence.
Streets are eerily empty; it’s not that late, she’s walked these streets much later but that doesn’t matter. Hands in her pockets, she holds her keys a bit tighter. Another sound, now followed by steps, not just one set either, she feels them closing in on her.
Dean raises his hands to cup Cas’ face. “I just don’t want to lose you. Your grace… that’s just a side of you, but you, Castiel I can’t lose. I can live without the angelic part of you, I know it won’t be easy for you, but I’ll be here to support you in any way I can. But you, this body, this mind, this soul, whatever this is, I can’t live without
She didn’t tell the boys when she first did this, it was a while back but she’s getting better at it, she stands up and goes back to the cabin, and in the cabin she starts opening doors, these doors are leading her to anywhere in the world, they belong to humans and angels alike, she somehow sees, hears and feels everything the person or angel is seeing, hearing or feeling at that very moment, sometimes it’s normal living, sometimes it’s dreaming, or meditation, or they’re so engaged on a given task they go to an in between state of life and heaven. She doesn’t understand how she does this, she just went with it the first time and realized she could start opening these doors, maybe one of them will lead her to the answers she’s been searching.
Dean only hums in approval and the sweetest smile appears across his lips, eyes instantly going to Cas, who is now about to make the second attempt on his turn, half of the pins are still standing.
“HELLO!!!! HEEELP!!!! PLEASE!! PLEASE HELP HER!!!”
Things had gotten out of hand, all the demons they kept finding, it couldn’t be a coincidence, it was all connected, if only he knew how. Maybe if they had figured it out already, none of this would have happened, but they didn’t even know where to start.
“Don’t! This isn’t a game! He’s hurt, please, I can help” she says the last words quietly, eyes searching Dean’s, pleading.
Dean explains what had happened and how Riley had helped him.
“Good morning, sleeping beauty” Sam chirps.
“Listen, we don’t know you, and we don’t know who you’re looking for, and we’re in a hurry, so can you please just…”
Riley gasps and automatically takes a hand to touch the angel wings’ on the hollow of her neck.
“Thank you” Dean breaths, finally “for saving him, I thought we were going lose him”
The figure’s still there, unmoving, in front of the Impala; and there’s something familiar about it too.
Sam got him and Dean tacos at Dean’s insistence, also pie. A cheeseburger and fries for Riley and candy and chocolate for Cas, even though Cas stated he didn’t need anything, Dean always got something for him, especially chocolate.
They got to their assigned lane, and Sam called for Jack to help him get some bowling balls; Jack looked over at Cas, who was standing really close to Dean, and they were whispering, Dean’s lips pulling at the corners, he was trying to hide a smile.
“Where’s Jack?” Cas quips. And he appears at the door following Sam.
They arrive at a wasteland, a few miles away from the bunker, they had heard that the bunker sat on sacred grounds, or that it was easier to cross from earth to hell or heaven from there. Guess it must be true, as Metatron decided to open up the gates right there. Dean gets as near to the spot as the storm allows him to, still they’re a couple of miles out. They can only make out an old barn and grain storage.
They’re almost home when Dean stirs from his comfortable position, encircled by Cas’ arms, and says in a clear voice:
Castiel takes a seat across from Dean, and he looks up to Sam, as they expected, Dean has no recollection of last night’s events, so they are happy to let it go for now.
“Are you ok?” Cas asks, worried.
Dean took Cas’ wrist, and squeezed, he turned to his brother “Sammy” he cried.
“I… I don’t know, I don’t think so, I just, I was feeling so… sad and upset and…” Cas sighed heavily, it seemed like he was tired just for speaking, and he was breathing fast.
“He’s sooo cute when he’s angry… he gets really stressed sometimes… and I just hate it when he up and leaves, I meeaan, we’re his family, I don't like being apart from him, he’s always getting in trouble for not staying with us” Sam runs a hand over his face.
Maybe her parents are still looking for her, but what about the others? She´s sure they have moved on with their lives, even Jay, as much as they loved each other, and as painful as she thinks this was for him, he probably has a life now, a new girl, maybe sharing his apartment, or what was supposed to be
“Everyone okay?” he asks. They nod.
“… and I umm, I just want you to know, that well… it’s true, all of it, I guess.” Castiel opens his mouth to say something, but Dean continues - “I mean, I hope all I said was, you know, all good things… I hope. Not sure, but I don’t think I would have said anything bad about you…” Dean starts rambling now, this is what he does when he gets too nervous and doesn’t have a plan on how to get out of a situation.
“Why?” inquiries Jack.
“Cas” she says, so quiet Dean’s not sure he heard her right. “Castiel, I’m searching for Castiel” she says, this time, voice steady.
Three days later Riley and Castiel wake up gasping for air, as the earth trembles below them, they get out of bed and find the boys in the middle of the corridor, cracks appear on the walls of the bunker in response to the force of the movement, suddenly the tremble stops.
That was all Dean needed to hear, he slipped a hand under Cas’ boxers and closed his fist around his cock, Cas was big and hard; Dean saw the reaction of Cas’ face as he did this, eyes closing, mouth opening. Dean had never been more turned on in his life.
******
Dean smiles again “Yes, yes we do” and he looks down at Cas, he runs his fingers through Cas’ hair and it’s so delicate and intimate, and Riley can’t help but think of when she used to do that same thing to Jay, and something aches inside her.
Dean loved hearing Cas make all those noises, it got him hard in seconds and he was rutting against Cas’ thigh.
Metatron turns to look at them, like a deer caught in headlights. “KILL THEM!” half a dozen demons spring into action. Riley kills two of them as she makes her way to Cas, Metatron stumbling out of her way, and releases him. Sam goes to Dean; he kills the demon that was hurting Dean and then frees his brother. A dozen more demons come running through the door. Riley locks her eyes on Metatron, his face pale, eyes nervous.
“Ri… Riley… Ri! Wake up!... C’mon!”
“Cameron and Jillian had known each other for 10 years when all of that happened, according to some articles I found.” Sam informed.
That she’s dead? That someone took her? Are they looking for her still? It's not like she can’t know all these things, just a quick search of her name and she’s sure she’ll find all the answers; but she can’t bring herself to do that, it’s too painful to even imagine what her family has gone through. She could come back, and say what exactly? Oh hey, some guys tried to take advantage of me, and I tried to fend them off and it’s how I discovered I’m actually an angel? You know wings, harp, and tunic… yeah, she’d be sent straight to the mental ward.
She plays absentmindedly with the wings hanging from her neck.
“We’re all brothers and sisters” Riley responds automatically.
“I know what happened to him. But… I mean, does someone know what he’s doing right now?” Riley demands.
“Best case scenario, you can’t be killed, and we might take longer to get out of here, but we will get out. Worst case, Metatron is lying, and you might get hurt; in any case, I’m not leaving you behind.” Sam says resolute.
Castiel is pointedly averting his eyes from landing anywhere near Dean, finally he settles on his hands that are laying on his lap.
At this point Jay is panting while pressing his cock against Riley’s ass, and Riley can only hold on to Jay’s arm and the sheets, and the only sounds coming out of her mouth are gasps and moans. Riley turns around and in the same movement gets on top of Jay, he automatically grabs her hips with both of his hands for support and Riley starts moving, pressing down on Jay’s hard cock, Riley grabs Jay’s shoulders for support and continues the movements trying to get all the friction she can on her clit, she’s so wet, and she can feel Jay’s the same… Riley closes her eyes, this is the moment Riley lets go of any inhibitions, this is what’s so amazing about Jay, she trusts him completely and is able to let go of everything, and just feel… and Jay is always ready for her.
It’s not like Sam doesn’t notice how Dean’s mood changes based on whether or not Castiel is around. And how when Castiel is around, Dean always gravitates towards Cas, no matter the place or the situation or the people who are present, it just happens.
Dean has known all kinds of people in his life; he knows love and determination when he sees it… the way Riley talks and looks at Cas, swearing to protect him, no matter what the cost. It’s the same way he feels about Sam, he’s sworn to protect his little brother, from the moment he was born, and reinforcing that promise when he got him out of the fire all those years ago, when Sammy was just a baby. He never stopped taking care of him, protecting him, giving up everything so Sammy could have it, because he is his baby brother and…
“I don’t believe you were ever bad, or you wouldn't even bother to help anyone” Cas states.
The other angels bring details on Metatron, things that Cas couldn’t know, and Riley feels her mind racing now, Metatron could be the key to unlocking all of Riley’s memories, she can feel it, the only issue is he’s been MIA after all the mess he left behind last time.
“Her?” Dean looks at Riley. “What about her? And, who is
“Pain and fear make the brain work… faster, more efficiently than it does on a normal state; been under pressure allows me to access the mind easily and also prevents him from hiding any thoughts, since he is too busy feeling and processing the pain, trying to figure a way to get rid of it”.
Cas shakes his head. “I’m fine Dean, stop worrying about me” it comes out harsher than he intended and he sees Dean’s eyes change, from worried to hurt.
Dean rose from the bed; he took his own boxers off, and then slid Cas’ down his legs and out of the way. Dean kissed Cas hard; he started with his mouth, then his neck, and he went down his chest. He went along his stomach, until he got to his hipbones. Cas’ hipbones were sinful, so Dean took his time, nibbling, and lapping with his tongue along the lines, over the soft skin. Cas was a writhing mess beneath him. And Dean was so hard now, precum running down his cock, he didn’t think he’d last long, but he was willing to try.
She sees the sky through a car window, she’s on the back seat, only hears the motor of the car as it races through a road.
Years of built up tension between the two seemed to vanish, their walls finally coming down. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’ waist, Cas’ arms around Dean’s neck. Dean shifted and led Cas to the bed, pushing him down without breaking the heated kiss, his knees on either side of Cas hips, straddling him. Dean turned his head and kissed along Cas’ neck, making him gasp.
Sam is quiet again.
They don’t need to be told twice, everyone is grabbing their things and getting ready to make a jump through space, courtesy of Cas.
She hears Dean huff a laugh and he says, “Cas wanted to see the sunrise, now he’s asleep and I can’t move”
Jay starts eating her as if this is the last thing he’ll do on this earth, and Riley holds on to the mattress any way she can, Jay goes between her legs and continues lapping her clit and sliding his tongue, his pinky finger already inside her ass, Riley’s barely registered this, she’s too lost in desire now. He keeps on stimulating every part of hers he can reach and feels her legs tremble, he knows she’s about to come so he doesn’t stop. Riley tenses and then releases her body, a moan so obscene falling from her lips, Jay scoots out of the way, the sheets now wet with her squirt, body limp, she falls on the mattress.
“It’s late” she says, as she gets off the couch “I gotta get back home”. Riley thinks this has been one of the laziest, yet greatest days she’s spent with Jay since they met.
Lucifer drops Dean on the spot, a growl so beastly emerging from his mouth, suddenly she feels herself been pulled up in the air, Cas right by her side, they’re flying out of the barn and into the open field, both landing a few feet besides Dean. Lucifer’s eyes start to glow, and the storm that was brewing begins to rage with full force, lightning strikes falling mere feet from where they’re standing, the wind picks up creating a dust storm, suddenly, the field is no longer visible.
Riley stares, a question in her eyes.
“Well, I’m not ok with it! And YOU…” Dean turns to Riley “How can you stand there and do nothing? Say nothing? I thought you were here to protect Cas! Even if he gives up his grace, he could die in the midst of things, he’ll just be human, do you really think he can survive!?” he asks frantically.
Cas looked confused. “There is?” he asked expectantly.
He was always happy to see Cas, but he was careful not to let it show, especially around Sam; his brother knew him too well, and he couldn’t risk letting the façade crack.
“It’s a counter spell… it requires…” Cas sighs “It requires a sacrifice… an angel’s grace…”
They get out of the Impala. “This is it, huh?” Dean huffs glancing at the others. “If we go down, might as well be with guns blazing.”
Cas turned his blue eyes on Dean “Being human is difficult, you have to deal with the loss of the people you love, how do you even do that?” he asked, upset.
Dean tightens his grip on the blade he’s holding and turns to look at Cas. He’s still sitting on the bed, but he’s paying close attention to everything.
“What are the rumors?” Cas says, standing up. He’s visibly concern.
“Well, good thing I can’t die…” Riley murmurs.
Dean looked at him, waiting for more.
Sam notices the gentle touches, the warm tone of Dean’s voice when addressing Cas, the fleeting looks he shares with the angel; all, when Dean thinks Sam is not paying attention.
Sam cuts him off before he can finish “Yes, yes, Dean, I drove; your Baby is fine. Relax, sit down and get some food, would you?”
“You’re still healing” he states “besides; I think you might want to talk to Cas”
“Cas-”
Castiel being always stubborn and always inquiring on why they do the things they do. It’s not that Castiel doesn’t follow the rules, but he needs to know why they need to be followed, which is not something the other angels do.
“Yeah, how do you suppose we do that in the middle of freaking nowhere!?” Dean said, this was too much for him, “this was a small case man, how did this even happened!?”
“The end… vengeance… star… rising!
They boys wait.
Riley opens her eyes, and sees dim light fighting to get through the curtain covered window, she wants to stretch but feels a grip around her hips tighten, she peaks down to see Jay's tattooed wrist, a moon with a pair of wings, she drops her own hand to cover Jay's and looks at her matching tattoo, this one with a sun instead of a moon.
” Riley hums as Jay starts massaging in circles over her shorts, he moves and angles himself to get as close to Riley as possible, and it’s almost like they melt and Riley starts feeling hot.
Dean thinks,
“Then there’s nothing we can do.” Dean deadpans.
just friendly feelings. Cas was his family, but he had connected with the angel in a way he hadn’t connected with anyone in a relationship before. They shared what Cas called a
Castiel clears his throat, trying to break the awkward silence. “Why don’t we get started?”
“You” Cas says pointedly.
“Was it Crowley?” Dean adds.
“You can’t” she interrupts him “you can’t help, not this time; trust me, it’s best if you stay out of it.”
Riley is studying the demon tied to the chair; Dean stands up and walks towards him.
Dean was still straddling him; he took his own cock in his right hand and started pumping. It was a miracle Dean hadn’t come just from contemplating Cas, he was so beautiful, so perfect, and the image of him reaching his orgasm, was imprinted in Dean’s mind. He’s hand was going faster, hips shifting erratically. Cas was taking in the view, bewildered. He reached out both hands and placed them on Dean’s hips, at the contact, Dean look down. Again those beautiful blue eyes were on him, full of wonder and surprise.
“Dean? Are you there?” she tries again a little desperation in her voice.
Bare with me please!
…………………………………………………………
“They must be blocking me… but how?” Castiel raises his eyebrows surprised.
“Dean” Sam finally disrupted the silence. “I think I found something” he’d been reading for hours.
“We’ll stay, but if you need anything, please call us”
Cas shakes his head, frowning. “I’m sorry but I don’t think I recognize you”
“Riley, if you lost your grace… that means you’re…”
“Umm, wow, I’m sorry, I had no idea… honestly I just woke up and feel rested, but I didn’t realize it had been so long…” she trails off.
She hears a piercing scream of what she recognizes as raw pain and something in her chest breaks, a pain so jarring, a hole forming in her chest as tears fall from her eyes without her permission. She stops feeling him, even without her grace, she knows Cas is gone.
“Don’t you think I know that? Dammit Cas! Why did you have to stand in front of the damn bomb!?”
“She doesn't remember who she is…” Sam remarks.
Cas stared back at him “The story… that would mean it’s a ghost”.
“You could have warned us” Cas mutters “you didn't have to take it all on yourself”
He thought, proud, smiling to himself.
“Why would I lie to you? I looked all over for you and when I finally found you, I kept track of you, to make sure you were safe. I kept all of those demons away, or did you think that was a coincidence?”
Jay looks up at her, deep blue eyes shining, “It’s ok, you can stay if you want; not like you haven’t spent the night before” a smirk on his face.
“How?” Sam asks quietly.
; all the angels in the garrison use full names, all of them call him Castiel. After so many years apart, even though she doesn’t remember exactly what she’s supposed to be to Castiel, she feels it, the big sibling duty.
“Of course it won’t” Riley interrupts. “You shall be roaming purgatory for eternity if you even think about attacking us again” she says, eyes set. “We can do this the easy way, or the hard way” she continues “Your choice”.
“Dean” Castiel breaths out the name so quietly Dean almost doesn’t hear it.
Sam does as he’s told.
”, she feels a void inside her, tiny, but still real. She shakes her head to get rid of the ridiculous voice, what else could she possibly be missing at this moment?
“I was afraid you were never coming out of that room” Cas states, his eyes wide.
angel; if he could not have him in reality, dreams were his escape. He would dream of Cas, almost every night; bright blue eyes staring softly at him, questioning, demanding, seeing straight through him. Dean holding Cas in his arms, brushing the hair off his forehead and patting it, taking Cas’ face in his hands and kissing him slowly, tenderly, lips brushing as Dean would whisper ‘
…………………………………………………………
“Are you okay?” Dean asks and seems alert and ready to move, the only thing stopping him is Cas’ head on his lap.
The silence stretches.
“Yes, and we need to hurry.” Riley finishes.
Jay doesn’t waste a moment and goes to her nipples at once, hot mouth closing around them, she arches her back, Jay kisses her nipples while his right hand is ridding Riley from her shorts and hipster, she pushes her hips up and they’re gone, now she’s pulling his boxers down and Jay gasps as she makes contact with the skin and in one swift movement, she twists her hand and lightly touches the head, his hips bucking instantly.
Jay kisses her ass again and make it all wet and then his pinky finger slides in to the middle, he keeps kissing, licking and touching everywhere else, and Riley comes again, her face against the mattress, Jay opens his mouth and catches all the sweet nectar that comes down, he doesn’t stop what he’s doing, but slows down to let her ride her orgasm as long as she can; Riley sighs content, once she catches her breath she looks back at Jay and smirks, “don’t stop” she says as she takes her hand to her clit and starts masturbating, Jay looks for a while but then gets back to his task, he kisses everywhere, bites where he can, spanks, and while Riley’s touching herself, his fingers keep sliding in and out of her ass, now Jay slips in two fingers on her vagina and Riley hisses and moans; she comes for the third time.
Baby sounds like anti aircraft starting up, so Dean borrows one of the bunker’s cars from the garage. A nondescript boxy 90s number that makes him look over his shoulder for John following behind. He finds the church Cas showed him not seven minutes away — a white clapboard with a steeple deal. He parks in the dirt lot out back beneath the cover of trees. The wind picks up as he walks to the back door, heavy with rain.
With a private smile, Dean shrugs into it. Zips it up.
He thinks about himself at twenty: hooking up with a guy out back behind a bar, deliberately sloshed as a defensible alibi and/or so he won’t be able to remember it after.
Cas shakes his head. He’s got that melancholy hangdog look on. “Humans built churches for  their benefit. Few angels have ever visited.”
“Hm?” Dean rubs his eyes. Slumps onto Castiel: not like a lover into an embrace, but a fading body dropping into water. “I think we’re dying.”
Castiel says, “Shut up,” which is a human response Dean taught him the day they met: which is to say, winning the argument while admitting nothing at all.
“I wasn't dead,” says Cas reprovingly.
“Sure, no. Just like none of you up there ever listens to prayers.”
Castiel is not so lucky.
“When you would listen to prayers,” Dean asks, lips grazing along the shell of Cas’ ear, “did you ever hear me?”
“Good morning,” Castiel replies, and flees.
“Man, I’m not confessing shit,” says Dean. But the cute girl in a skirt and turtleneck across the room keeps looking over. Sam watches him disappear into the confessional booth not long after; he doubts it’s to meet a priest.
Dean groans against the pressure digging into his leg. He hauls Cas closer, desperate to get his hands across Cas’ shoulderblades, kiss the juncture of his jaw, bite his neck. Cas exhales: pulling back long enough to watch Dean’s face as he thumbs open his jeans.
Dean says, “You never do.”
He’s a selfish bastard.
But this one still could.
Castiel wakes him up.
Shelves crashing at his feet.
Dean puts his head in his hands. He can’t believe anybody ever believed he was straight.
Dean thinks about himself at thirteen: watching a muscular man jog down the street; averting his gaze before his dad sees him looking.
Castiel stops in front of him: hand outstretched toward the coffee filters. Only a body’s worth of air between them; something that only a few years ago Dean would have protested to or taken a step back. Now he just watches Castiel in mild curiosity, swallowing a large gulp of jet fuel. Castiel watches his adam’s apple bob.
“Let me worry about that,” says Dean. He slides the chain off the door, wheels in his head clearly turning. “And we’re getting you a
A pounding at the door jostles him awake. Without direct sunlight, the bunker is like a tomb. Quiet. Introspective. Conducive for hibernation or comas. Gabriel once trapped Castiel in the tomb of terracotta soldiers as a joke for a couple hundred years.
Dean snorts again, but this time with a flush staining his cheeks. The laundromat has no air conditioning, and the fan seems more ornamental than effective.
“Sleep is healthy. ”
He kills Dean a thousand times. An even set. Naomi was big on Fibonacci, on the golden ratio, on matched sets. It’s why she never threw fake Sam at him.
Sam took to mean a casual game of hacky sack in the frozen basement, only marginally warmer than the snowy basketball court behind the sanctuary, but it is empty and private — which is how Sam discovers that
When Castiel appears in the blank space that night, he goes straight for a Dean. It doesn’t matter which. He strides up and kisses him, full on the mouth. Dean jerks in surprise at first, then relaxes into it. Dean’s calloused hand — Castiel can identify which tools he’s been favoring on this replica of Baby idling beside them — cups Castiel’s neck.
“Save it. Whatever you get up to in your own subconscious is none of my business. Oh wait!” He slaps his forehead theatrically. “It absolutely is!”
“You weren’t able to sleep as an angel,” Sam ventures cautiously one evening.
“Lord god almighty,” Dean murmurs, an automatic response triggered by decades of conditioning.
He takes his time selecting a Dean today. These are not reimagined Deans, but rather reanimated. He brought every single slaughtered one back to life, patched their unique wounds, healed their collective hurts. Castiel passes one with a scar across his eyebrow, running his fingers lightly across this Dean’s forehead. Lingers over one that’s sleeping, curled up on the floor, comes to stop in front of one that’s playing cards with himself. Solitaire. Not even a simple cooperative game like War.
