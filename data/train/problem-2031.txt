He pumps slowly in and out, lost in the sensation of John around him, even such a seemingly insignificant part.
Reaching for the now-warmed massage oil with a trembling hand, John attempts to clear the fuzz in his mind, at least enough that he can get the damn top off the bottle and appreciate the feeling of Sherlock's skin beneath his hands. After a few aborted tries, John succeeds in unwrapping the seal.
Water continues to fall over them, the sound of it splashing on bare skin and tiles as John searches for precisely the right words to reassure Sherlock that he wants, needs, that too. In the end, he goes for something simple.
"Because I didn't want to get in the way, John.  When I left, I believed you and Mary were starting off down a path I would not be needed on - parenthood.  Because you and Mary needed time to adapt to the sudden idea of parenthood without me dragging you off, possibly putting your life in danger."  Glancing away, Sherlock continued. "Because you should never be forced to choose between your best friend and your wife."  Taking a deep breath he turned back to face John.  He made a conscious effort to lower all his defences, to let his true emotions show.  If he was going to lay himself open to John, then he would not do half a job.  As with everything he did, Sherlock put his whole self into his decision.  "Because I am a selfish man, John and I would have made you choose.  I would have asked you to come on cases, knowing that you wouldn't refuse and I would get my own way whilst making it seem to everyone else that you had free choice.  I would have made you spend every moment of every day with me and it still wouldn't have been enough."
John's eyelids were growing heavy and his words were whispered.  Sherlock was tired too but knew he must be heavy on John's chest, weakly he tried to move away.  The strong arms that were wrapped around him held him more tightly. "You're not going anywhere."
“John, there’s nothing there.”  Sherlock reluctantly lets his hand drop.  “There’s some redness but it looks like it’s from your constant rubbing rather than from a topical irritant.”
Upon reaching this realisation, John takes a few deep cleansing breaths and opens his eyes, relieved to see a look of patient understanding on Sherlock’s face and John knows, being any shadow of a doubt, that he will never choose someone over Sherlock again.
“Doctor Watson underwent a craniotomy, which is when a small temporary flap is made in the skull.  The haematoma is then removed using suction and irrigation and any leaking blood vessels are repaired.  The skull flap is then replaced, luckily the skull heals very rapidly and usually leaves no area of weakness.”  Mary snorts and mutters something about ‘John, being hard-headed as usual.’  Both men deem to ignore this comment. The surgeon presumes it is shock and Sherlock knows it is the lack of compassion that drives Mary’s words.
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes."  Sherlock's eyes widen at the use of his given name.  How could John know? Mycroft! Bloody Mycroft!  Sherlock silently vows to murder Mycroft the next time he sees him before returning his full attention back to John.  John's words are gentle, but each one carves a special place in Sherlock's heart.  "Sherlock.  My Sherlock.  I love you.  I think I have always loved you.  I will always love you.  You are mine and I am yours.  Never doubt that."  Sherlock melts into the offered kiss. "I.  Love.  You."  Each word is punctuated with a kiss.
“Tenta ficar depois da aula. Pede umas aulas particulares. Ou só vai sem o protetor, acho que vai ser igualmente efetivo”.
John didn't wait to the end of the phrase. He simply pushed Mycroft out of the way, making him stumble against a small table on a corner. He entered in hatred, and started spinning around himself, looking for Sherlock.
“Ah, mas estaremos ensinando ballet, não rugby, Mr. Holmes” ele insistiu, brevemente erguendo-se na ponta dos pés sem nem perceber, para dar ênfase às suas palavras. “E de ballet, não consigo imaginar alguém que entenda mais do que você”.
“Daí ele vem e pede pra eu levantar ele. Segurar na cintura dele. Na perna dele. Puxar aqui. Puxar ali. Ele abaixou na minha frente, Greg. Não importa se você é hetero, não vai me dizer que aquele cara não tem a melhor…” John fez um gesto de apertar com as mãos, olhando pros seus dedos.
Assim que a aula se encerrou, John enrolou um bom tempo para arrumar suas coisas. Quando levantou-se, ele era o último do time na sala. Sherlock também estava ali, arrumando sabe-se lá o quê no armário.
No caminho, desenrolou a camisinha sobre seu membro. Sherlock virou-se em sua direção, mas não andou até ele. Logo John estava apertando-se contra ele no espelho - que sem dúvida nenhuma teria manchas de suor no dia seguinte.
John sorriu mais e conseguiu penetrar mais fundo. Os dois gemeram em uníssono. Beijaram-se novamente, buscando calar seus ruídos na boca um do outro. Nenhum dos dois poderia saber, mas ambos sentiam que iam derreter. Seus corpos incendiaram-se, com certeza. Não tinha como ser de outra forma. Quando John se viu completamente dentro do dançarino, chegou à conclusão de que a realidade era muito superior às suas fantasias.
"You made me believe you were dead when you were alive. And now you made me believe you were alive when you were dead. And everybody knew better. Your brother. Your parents. And London. The whole city knew. Except for me. Again. Again, Sherlock, really?".
Sherlock era simplesmente apetitoso. Era um sentimento novo pra se ter quanto a um parceiro sexual. Sherlock era algo novo. John tinha uma vontade absolutamente irresistível de morder, apertar, lamber o dançarino. Então foi isso que fez. Em seu desespero por realizar essa vontade, interrompeu repentinamente o que fazia para ajoelhar-se atrás de Sherlock, mantendo as mãos em suas nádegas. Suas mãos apertaram a abriram espaço, enquanto seus dedões forçavam a entrada de Sherlock a relaxar e recebê-lo. Novamente, ouviu o gemido involuntário. Dessa vez mais longo, mais desesperado. Ansioso. Percebeu que o rapaz movera-se levemente para trás, de encontro ao rosto de John.
“Mas eu estou falando sério, Greg” ele disse, sorrindo, tentando não rir. “Não, eu estou mesmo. Não dá pra ficar pulando de pau duro. Já tentou pular de pau duro? Não dá pra pular de pau duro”.
“Vai precisar de mais aulas particulares” Sherlock avisou, tentando não sorrir, após um tempo em silêncio, dividindo apenas os beijos.
John fez que sim. Greg passou atrás dele, rindo também, e deu-lhe um tapa no traseiro. “Não vai querer distrair as dançarinas, John. Sem calças apertadas pra você”.
Tudo que John não conseguia fazer agora era relaxar. A posição era extremamente desconfortável pra se começar a ter uma ereção. E como acontecia sempre que Sherlock estava perto demais, tocando-o nos lugares certos, John rapidamente começou a sentir o aperto incômodo do protetor pressionando seu membro enrijecendo. Era ainda mais incômodo, porque durante a aula toda, John teve essa mesma vontade, essa mesma necessidade. Não era a primeira ereção que Sherlock lhe causava hoje. E o protetor só deixava tudo mais complicado.
John pressed another kiss to Sherlock’s lips before pulling away, and moving toward the door this time. He slipped on his boots and pocketed his sopping wet socks before shrugging into his jacket. “It’s not a question of wanting you, Sherlock, because I definitely do. I just have to try to sort this with as much tact as possible. I love Mary, but…there’s no question, ok? I was going to ask to stay tonight, but I don’t think that’s wise after all. I need to talk to Mary as soon as possible. I’ll text you.”
“I know. I know, love. That’s not even what this about anymore. I just – I’m going to need some time. I need to talk to Mary. We have to – we have to tell everyone the wedding is off. I’m going to need some space at first, all right? But Sherlock, listen to me: I am not pushing you away, I’m not cutting you out, and I’m damn sure not giving this – whatever this is – up. Ok?” John asked, his hand brushing gently against Sherlock’s cheek in a tentative gesture, like he was afraid he was going to break the detective.
“Reading minds is my job,” Sherlock whispered, and he smiled at John’s answering laughter. He still hadn’t turned around, and when he felt arms wrap around him from behind, Sherlock let himself relax into the embrace even though he knew he shouldn’t.
There was a long silence, only broken by the sounds of distant thunder and the steady pounding of rain against the sitting room window. Sherlock steeled himself and finally looked up at his best friend, and felt his stomach drop.
John huffed in annoyance as he crossed the flat and sunk down into his chair across from Sherlock. Yes, Sherlock still thought of it as
They moved around the sitting room fluidly, no toes stepped on, no stumbling over the steps, in perfect synchronicity for nearly the entirety of the song. Sherlock had explained that a dip at the end was usually added for flair, but was unnecessary. He did express that he thought it might impress Mary more, so he encouraged it, but John hadn’t tried it yet.
to kiss anyone before, not until John, and then it was a near constant battle to stop himself from doing so.
John only just managed not to drop his glass of water as he gaped at the man across from him. All these years that he had wondered, after The Woman and Janine and every other thing that had made John almost sure that Sherlock was straight – one simple question from a five year old and the cat was out of the bag.
“Stop it, just stop!” John ground out through clenched teeth as he finally turned around to face Sherlock. His eyes were red rimmed and Sherlock could see his clenched fists shaking at his sides.
Sherlock parara em sua frente, analisando a postura do loiro. Ele nada disse por alguns segundos, até dar um passo a frente.
"Sherlock, you asshole, I know you hate family reunions, but you could at least show up to one of my daughter's birthdays!" John spat, yelling inside the house, without actually seeing Sherlock.
Sherlock só aguentou manter-se aberto para John na primeira lambida. Foi mais que o suficiente para que soltasse e voltasse a segurar-se barra, apoiando a testa sobre ela. Porém, manteve as pernas abertas e John tomou seu lugar mantendo espaço para seu rosto se enfiar ali. Sua língua circulava a entrada de Sherlock, movendo-se conforme os gemidos lhe guiavam. Descobriu que ele gostava quando lambia seu períneo, ou quando intercalava com mordidas gentis às suas nádegas. Percebera também que os gemidos ficavam sem fôlego e mais altos quando John passava um dedo tentadoramente pela abertura umedecida por sua saliva. Sentia que Sherlock movia-se para trás cada vez, tentando John a arriscar enfiar o dedo.
"Mycroft?" John said, confused and honestly surprised by the visit. He threw away the dirty diaper and washed his hands, while Mary picked Lisa up. "Did something happen?".
John não sabia exatamente se era isso que queria com isso tudo. Chegar numa das mais tradicionais escolas de ballet com seu time de rugby nunca fora sua intenção. Mas já era mais midiático do que qualquer coisa, então pelo menos, talvez, eles conseguissem mais patrocínio com a atenção do público.
Com um dedo sob o queixo de Sherlock, pediu que se levantasse. Beijou-o lentamente, preguiçosamente, limpando a sujeira que fizera em seu rosto. Era o beijo mais aquecido que dividiram. Parecia nunca acabar. Nenhum dos dois queria ser o primeiro a mover-se dali. Mas ambos estavam cansados e com as pernas bambas. Então eventualmente, os dois sentaram-se e continuaram a se beijar encostados no espelho.
Removeu o dedo e afastou-se do rapaz relutantemente. Sherlock levantara e estava apoiado contra o espelho, respirando pesadamente, pernas em pequenos espasmos. John encontrou um sachet de lubrificante e algumas camisinhas. Destacou uma, abriu um sachet e retornou para o bailarino que o esperava.
John largou a coxa de Sherlock de imediato. Sherlock baixou a perna e virou-se de costas, andando em direção ao espelho enquanto John enfiava as mãos nas calças. Sherlock apoiou-se na barra, virado para John.
“Exceto quando quer demonstrar quem abre mais as pernas” John ameaçou quebrar o tom sério com um sorrisinho.
Quando chegou sua vez, John engoliu em seco. Sua perna não chegava a passar a barra por muito pouco, e o motivo disso era o shorts esticado ao máximo.
John o beijou, lenta e gentilmente. Segurava sua cintura para dar-lhe estabilidade, e a outra mão acariciava-lhe o rosto.
For a moment there, Mycroft thought John was in denial. He thought he wasn't believing it. But then John spoke before he could.
Sherlock revirou os olhos e segurou o rosto de Irene com dois dedos, tentando manté-la na direção certa da luz.
“O de ballet é tamanho único” Sherlock explicou. “Mas você não é o primeiro com esse problema a treinar aqui”.
The second time John heard about Sherlock was two months later. He was going to work on a bike, like always, trying to lose weight. He decided to change the route and pass through the Baker Street. There was a truck in front of it. He slowed down and saw a man carrying a huge piano inside. Mrs. Hudson was watching it being done, outside. John stopped, got off the bike and walked to her.
Sherlock prontamente levantou-se, igualmente sem esforço, e ergueu uma das pernas, sempre com leveza e maestria, para apoiá-la sobre a barra em frente ao espelho. O time todo foi até a barra e tentou fazer o mesmo. John procurou manter-se o mais distante possível.
John nodded and entered. He took the chair and carried it down the stairs, almost falling half the way down. Then one of the men helped him. He paid 50 quid for them to put it on the truck and take it to his house.
Pelo menos foi isso que John Watson observou. Mas, em sua cabeça, a análise fora levemente diferente. E estava voltada no quão bom seria encostar em qualquer parte do rapaz e no quão fácil seria levantá-lo do chão.
“O que exatamente você quer praticar, capitão Watson?” Sherlock questionou. Ele andava na direção de John com os pés trançados, na posição do ballet.
Sherlock permitiu que John lhe tocasse exatamente onde havia tocado o jogador de rugby. John pôs a mão embaixo da coxa sustenida de Sherlock, e a outra mão foi para sua cintura.
“Mr. Holmes, em primeiro lugar, gostaria de parabenizá-lo pelo trabalho com as crianças,” ele começou. A linha em sua testa dizia que esse começo de frase era apenas para que Sherlock não ficasse ofendido com o que o coordenador pediria. “Você sabe o quão desesperado eu estava. Fico eternamente grato pelo trabalho voluntário. Você é um dos nossos melhores alunos e…”
“Ao invés disso você prefere ficar provocando e se divertindo com cada vez que ele fica excitado e se apertado no protetor GGG”
“Acho que só consigo isso mesmo” John insistiu. “Talvez se você mostrasse como é”, ele pediu, baixando a perna.
“Mas é o primeiro a ter vergonha dele” Sherlock continuou. John parou a meio caminho do banheiro e virou-se para Sherlock. Pela surpresa, John não lembrou de manter abaixada a camisa. Só lembrou-se quando percebeu o sorriso do instrutor. “Não tem nada pra se envergonhar”.
“John” Greg interrompeu novamente. “Ele tem arranjado qualquer desculpa pra encostar em você e pra que você encoste nele desde que as aulas começaram. Se ele está atraído por alguém naquela sala, esse alguém é você. E tem também a coisa do protetor genital tamanho grande” Greg voltou a rir.
Na segunda aula, metade da sala usava lycra, metade usava o mesmo shorts. Sherlock insistiu em treinos que exigiam maior mobilidade, além de saltos repetitivos - nos quais os garotos pareciam morsas saltando. No terceiro dia, três quartos usavam lycra.
“Por favor… mova…” Sherlock arfou, movendo seu quadril pra lá e pra cá pra estimular John a mover seu dedo. Havia ficado momentaneamente hipnotizado pelas fantasias de seu cérebro.
"Yeah, well, mate, you're out of luck. That's not his chair." John invented. "He liked the sofa best, he was always laying there. That chair was actually mine, sorry.".
As bochechas de Sherlock coraram instantaneamente. Ele franziu os lábios, apertando-os numa linha fina. Um debate interno se formou dentro dele. Observando os rapazes que agora riam e conversavam no estacionamento lá em baixo, Sherlock amaldiçoou Irene por estar certa.
Depois de rir e terminar seu copo de cerveja, Greg pediu mais uma rodada para ambos e cutucou o braço de John. “E por que você não tenta?”
“Vá ajudá-los, Sherlock” John viu a garota dizer. Sentira algum tom de brincadeira na voz dela, como que desafiando o instrutor, mas não pensou muito no assunto. Apenas assistiu o rapaz, a contragosto, passar por cada um dos jogadores, ajustando suas posturas, forçando-os a esticar aqui e ali, sempre tocando-os com a ponta dos dedos.
Mycroft stepped forward, and then suddenly had to rush to him, as so did his parents, when John simply fell to the floor.
“Is not here and not likely to be here any time soon.  My people have doctored all of the cameras around Baker Street, nothing but peace and quiet is on show there. No-one followed us from your house, my people have ensured that too. You are all on your own, Sherlock Holmes, and you will die all on your own; when I deem the time to be right. But first
“Understood, John.”  He grins back at Sherlock, chuckling when Sherlock rolls his eyes but makes no attempt to get out of the bed.
John queries, his head hurts and his palms are sweating, he fights the temptation of wiping them on his sheets, unwilling to show his distress.
Mrs Hudson receives an eloquent shrug before Enid starts talking, wincing occasionally when the antiseptic solution catches something particularly sore.
"I promise, John." John can see the truth of Sherlock's words in his clear blue-green eyes, their gaze steady, never wavering.
Mycroft leans back in his chair, hands loose in his lap as he studies John, long moments pass before he finally blinks.
"I bet she did." John's brow darkens at the thought of Mary and her implications. "Sholto was my commanding officer, and yes, I admit I felt something for him, a bit of hero worship I guess; but I never wanted to initiate anything between us even though I suspected he may have had feelings for me. A quick fling wasn't worth the risk of my position or my reputation. Despite what the media may say the army is still not the place for homosexual relationships to exist."
"Bloody hell Sherlock, that's a gifted mouth you've got there!" He eventually murmured, his chest still rising and falling rapidly. "If I'd known that telling you I'd seen you in the shower would have this effect I'd have told you yesterday!"
“A spy? The fact that he doesn’t stand out would make him perfect for something like that.”  John sips at his water again, not quite meeting Sherlock’s eye.
Sherlock agrees that privacy for that particular procedure was the best option for John but he can’t help being annoyed that he slept so heavily, anyone could have come in - anything could have happened to John.
Author's Note:  Another wonderful bit of editing by the amazing LockedinJohnlock! We're almost there!
Taking this into account Lestrade stops at the next vending machine and puts on quite a show of deciding what coffee to have, viciously suppressing a relieved sigh when he sees Sherlock sit down. Sherlock huffs and complains but he remains seated, rubbing a slightly shaking hand over his brow.  Lestrade selects a black coffee for himself, an Earl Grey for Mycroft, and a Camomile Tea for Sherlock.  With drinks in hands they set off once again, the wheel still squeaks and the sound of their footsteps echo along the mostly deserted corridors as they sip their drinks. They walk in strangely companionable silence until Mycroft insists that they need some sustenance, citing that they have no real idea when they are going to get to eat next.  Glancing over at Sherlock, Lestrade can see a fine beading of sweat on his brow and upper lip, the reason now apparent for Mycroft’s sudden need for a snack.  With a smothered sigh and a derogatory quip about Mycroft’s expanding waistline, Sherlock sinks gratefully in to the nearest available chair.  Mycroft buys them a twin pack of chocolate digestives each, which they put in their pockets under the pretence of saving them to eat later, before walking the last few hundred metres to Intensive Care.
Sherlock realises that he never gave John the credit he deserved when it came to his acting skills and verbal diplomacy.  John is giving Mary all the right indications that he is coming home without actually saying the words.  He's acknowledged the baby and has very carefully but not overtly neglected to claim her as his own.  Mary takes John's words as they stand, not expecting any duplicity from him.
“No.  The universe is rarely so lazy.  This is purposeful, concocted between you and Mycroft.”  He stops once again in front of John, eyes narrowed.  “My brother playing matchmaker?”  Suddenly his eyes widen, his mouth forming a small ‘O’ of surprise.  “No, that was all you.  You thought you'd take the opportunity to use this weekend to conduct an experiment of your own?  Use the fact that we were required to act as a couple to ‘test the waters’, so to speak.”  Sherlock remains almost nose to nose with John but his body language is no longer confrontational.  “How deliciously devious of you.”  Sherlock’s serious demeanour alters to one of elated delight
"You belong with Sherlock. You belong together. You deserve each other.. " Mary felt her face relax into a grin. "And actually John, I deserve to find a love like that too."
Sherlock saw the moment that John decided on his course of action, a deep breath, the setting of his shoulders and then the slow turn of his body. What Sherlock hadn't been able to foresee was John's reaction to his deduction. John's lips were moist, his cheeks heated from a dusky blush and his deep blue eyes now stormy with arousal, his pupils wide.
"Oh God, John." The words are exhaled on a breath, his face appears troubled and  it's obvious Sherlock wants to say more, but the words are eluding him.
For a moment, both men lean against each other, letting the warm water run over their lax bodies, savouring this new step in their relationship. After a few minutes, Sherlock moves away, pouring shampoo into his hand before briskly washing John's hair but his movements seem almost distracted.
His grip on Sherlock's hand loosens but he doesn't let go. Sherlock's hand in John's hair drifts down onto his shoulder, where he squeezes encouragingly before allowing his index finger to drift, almost absentmindedly, along the neckline of John's jumper. Warm skin meets his cool fingertips and he can feel John unconsciously leaning in to his touch.
"Raise your elbows until they are at shoulder height. Yours John, not mine.  No chicken impressions needed." His breath caught in his throat as he felt the low chuckle John gave travelling through his finger tips. The gentle tingle continued throughout his body, raising a gentle blush onto his cheeks.
Another instalment now awaits, I hope you enjoy it. I would say we have definitely passed the halfway point for the story.
"Of course I do. I'm not a child anymore Mycroft. Please leave. John and I have wedding plans to sort.  Your presence is neither needed nor wanted." Sherlock crossed to the door, opening it and pointing his brother through it.
“Sherlock, you don't know what room he is in.”  Mycroft’s hands flutter briefly at his sides, the only indication of his frustration with his brother.
It had taken Sherlock the merest of moments to catalogue the sensation against his skin, but even that proved to be too long; the kiss was over and Sherlock could sense the empty space next to him, the opportunity missed.
"Yes! And now I'm going out! Coming or not?" Sherlock's words seem their usual imperious selves but John can hear the nervousness behind them. Despite John's laptop being back on the desk, his mug back in the kitchen and his clothes (shirts hung - not folded) back in the upstairs bedroom, Sherlock still seems to believe that John is only visiting, not living permanently back at Baker Street, back where he should always have been.
Mycroft then pushed his father inside. "Go help mum." he ordered, then turned to John. "He couldn't make to our little Christmas reunion. He's very busy. Lot's of important stuff. Criminals. Organizations.".
A mão de John que segurava a coxa perfeitamente ereta de Sherlock lentamente deslizou para baixo. O capitão sentia cada músculo do dançarino com perfeição por cima da calça de lycra. Os músculos contraídos e os estendidos. Até a área tão exposta entre suas nádegas. No momento que os dedos de John se fecharam ali - seu dedo médio pressionando o leve declive da entrada do professor - Sherlock soltou um gemido involuntário de surpresa. As línguas pararam de mover-se dentro das bocas. Por um momento, Sherlock não se mexeu, apenas manteve-se a sentir o dedo de John tentando forçar uma entrada impossível por cima da lycra, desejando que conseguisse.
“...Chegou ao nosso conhecimento que uma equipe de rugby virá fazer um curso conosco. A imprensa está prestando atenção, estão de olho. Seria realmente muito bom se pudéssemos nos empenhar em oferecer a eles um treinamento sério e efetivo”.
“Não-” Sherlock arfou. Havia segurado a barra, como forma de conseguir alguma sustentação. Suas pernas estavam completamente retesadas, na tentativa de se manter dobrado daquele jeito. “Se você tocar aí…” ele tentou continuar inutilmente, e segurou a mão de John sobre seu pau, impedindo-o de movê-la. Quando John a soltou, o rapaz usou as duas mãos para abrir suas nádegas para John. Foi mais que o suficiente para compreender que não precisaria masturbar Sherlock por enquanto.
Irene sorriu de canto. Sherlock a ignorou. “Hm, não sei” ela disse, fingindo ignorância. “Um amigo meu disse uma vez que gostava de um certo tipo específico” ela continuou, virando o corpo para apoiar-se de costas na janela. “É que parece que está saindo 25 homens desse tipo específico daquela van”.
The Holmes family would be there. He was sure that Sherlock would be there. He might not return to him, but he'd certainly return to his parents. His mother would make him. Fuck the exile. His parents would force Mycroft to find a way, and he'd be there, bored as hell, and he'd be so thankful for John to be there. He'd be so glad to see his best friend again. He'd apologize. John would beat the shit out of him for not sending news for two years again. But then it'd be fine. He'd show him his daughter. He'd see Sherlock and his daughter together.
John sorriu olhando para a boca de Sherlock com uma luxúria que mal reconheceu em si mesmo. Baixou a perna do bailarino até a altura de sua cintura, e com o auxílio de uma mão sob a bunda do mesmo, ergueu-o para apoiá-lo na barra atrás dos dois. Com isso, conseguiu tirar a outra perna de Sherlock do chão e carregá-lo. Tal qual imaginou, era muito fácil segurá-lo e realizar a fantasia de foder Sherlock Holmes em seu colo, de pé.
John fez que sim e - sem metade da graça de Sherlock - pôs o tornozelo sobre a barra. Havia ganhado um pouco de flexibilidade com essas três semanas de aula, claro. Não tinha mais dificuldade nesse movimento.
"A gift." Mycroft answered, resting the umbrella on the floor. "Sherlock apologizes for not being here for the baby. He wanted to give her something."
Sherlock sorriu, lábios formando uma linha fina, e se aproximou. Uma das mãos foi pra parte interna da coxa de John. A outra foi para suas costelas. “Está fazendo o movimento errado. Sente os músculos aqui? Estão fazendo esforço. Tente relaxar”.
John stared at Mycroft's stupid lie with his lips slightly parted. It seemed like John was about to punch him in the face.
Sherlock recebeu a notícia logo depois de finalizar a aula de terça-feira. O coordenador da Royal Ballet estava esperando, de braços cruzados, o fim da aula infantil. Fizera um gesto para que Sherlock prosseguisse quando o bailarino ia interrompê-la para ouvir o que o coordenador tinha a dizer. Então, às 10:30 em ponto, Sherlock finalizou com um alongamento.
Sherlock nada disse. Ao invés de comentar alguma coisa, Sherlock passou uma sequência de saltos com pernas abertas ao máximo. E, é claro, o shorts de John rasgou, como Sherlock previra. A sala toda riu. Até John riu de si mesmo, deitando no chão e escondendo o rosto enquanto ria e escondia o rasgo na parte de trás da roupa.
. Don’t twist it around because you feel guilty, John. Your moral dilemma is your own; I have no qualms about what really happened,” Sherlock snapped.
John tilted Sherlock’s head down so that their foreheads rested together, a smirk pulling at his lips as he played with the curls at the base of the detective’s neck. “It’s ok, I won’t need my room; we have yours.”
John’s palms were sweating as he clenched them at his side. He felt like they were at a precipice, and he was afraid to take the next step. “Well…I perhaps may have suspected before, but I was never sure. I never thought I’d hear you say it, bold as brass.”
“So what do we do, Sherlock?” John murmured, his cheek pressed into Sherlock’s shoulder from behind as he held the detective against his chest.
Sherlock thought maybe he should warn John that the dip was coming, but decided that John needed to feel the natural fluidity of how the dip should be included without any kind of pretence. So, with no warning, Sherlock eased John smoothly down into the dip, following him chest to chest. John let out a startled sound and held on tighter to Sherlock, just as the detective had done to him.
Sherlock smiled, his arms tightening around his best friend and pulling them closer so that no space was between them, just like during their first kiss. “No, but you will need your chair,” and then Sherlock closed the remaining space and kissed John again.
John nearly spit out the sip of tea he had just taken. The last thing he expected to hear out of his five year old daughter’s mouth was a question about his best mate’s sexuality.
“I’m not getting cold feet. Mary just kindly informed me a week before the wedding that our first dance is to be a traditional waltz because, and I quote, ‘it’ll be easier for you, I think.’ I have no bloody clue how to waltz!”
John took a deep breath to prepare himself, and then climbed out of the now tepid bath water. He dried himself off and pulled his dressing gown on before wiping the fog from the mirror and giving himself a stern look. He could do this. Sherlock was his best mate, and if he couldn’t be honest with him, then something was clearly wrong.
Sherlock grasped John’s arms and loosened them enough so that he could turn around in his embrace. Now facing the doctor, Sherlock could not possibly ever let this go again. It would break him. “Well, you would have to help me move your chair back downstairs, as I nearly pulled every muscle in my back dragging it up there.”
Of course, because he no longer received updates about John, he’d had no idea about Mary until Mycroft had taken him back to London and put him back together again after his torture in Siberia. Looking through the files that Anthea had handed to him, Sherlock felt his excitement at finally getting to see John again turn to ash.
There was no goodbye, no explanations or excuses. John slipped his jacket on and stopped in the doorway, his back to Sherlock. There was a moment where Sherlock was almost convinced that the army doctor was going to turn around, say something to fix this horrible, gaping wound in his chest where John used to live.
John unclenched his fists and reached out to rub the lapel of Sherlock’s dressing gown between his thumb and forefinger. He traced the fabric with his fingers until his hand was at the back of Sherlock’s elegant neck. John let his fingers slide up into the silky curls at the detective’s nape.
Sherlock should have known that teaching John how to dance with his future wife would be no less intense. He just hadn’t expected for John to feel it as well.
“If she thinks a classic waltz will be easier for you, John, I hate to say that she already knows you’re a bumbling idiot.”
John started with his left, finally, but Sherlock noticed that his entire stance had changed. He was more relaxed without looking lazy, his movements more natural as he guided Sherlock around the makeshift dance floor, even executing the turn that had nearly sent them sprawling across the flat the first time John had tried it.
“Eles vão parecer toras de madeira tentando dançar, Irene. Que oportunidade exatamente eu estou perdendo? Se eu conseguir rir disso, já será algum lucro”.
Houve um gemido mais longo, conforme Sherlock inspirava pela boca. E ele continuou quando o ar deixou seus pulmões. Mais algumas gotas de pré-ejaculação pingaram de seu membro intocado.
John fechou os olhos quando sentiu o calor aumentando e o prazer acumulando. Abriu-os no momento que o orgasmo o atingiu, fazendo as pernas fraquejarem e arquearem, seu coração parar por segundos para então explodir em uma sensação quente que se espalhou pelo corpo todo, culminando na junção entre seu membro e a boca de Sherlock, onde vazou seu gozo na língua estendida, nos lábios abertos, e nas maçãs do rosto finas. Sherlock ainda o tomou na boca mais uma vez, limpando-o e chupando-a até que estivesse sensível demais.
Sherlock muito claramente se espantou. Ele, que raramente deixava transparecer suas emoções, ergueu ambas as sobrancelhas e virou-se para buscar outro protetor. Voltou com um maior, mais rígido, voltado para lutas, e não ballet.
"New renter, dear." she answered. "He's a pianist, I think. Oh, I prefer the sound of the violin. Don't you? I miss it so much.".
His mother seemed to lose her breath as she pointed at a corner in the room. John spun around to look at it. There was nothing, just a box with a violin on top of it. The Stradivarius.
"Oh, dear." said his father, seeming like he lost the life from his eyes. "He… he couldn't make it…"
John só conseguia pensar no quão exposto Sherlock estava naquela posição. Seus olhos pareceram escurecer com as pupilas dilatadas. Houve um breve momento no qual John interrompeu o leve movimento de aproximar-se da boca de Sherlock para pedir-lhe permissão para tal. Sherlock respondeu encerrando a distância entre eles.
O corpo de Sherlock havia sido moldado para o ballet desde os cinco anos. Suas panturrilhas eram invejáveis. Seu torso era esguio, porém forte. Suas coxas eram torneadas, sem ganhar muito volume. Ele era leve, e basicamente constituído de massa magra. Seus glúteos eram igualmente fortes e, devido a isso, empinados.
O olhar dos dois estava travado um no outro. Sherlock não precisou quebrar o olhar para que John entendesse que podia continuar erguendo a coxa do dançarino. A perna ereta subiu acima da cabeça de ambos, até que estivesse em perfeito 180º em relação à outra.
Sherlock gemia desesperadamente. Parecia que todo movimento gerava-lhe micro orgasmos. John movia seu quadril ritmadamente, mas já não conseguia foco para um beijo. Manter as bocas unidas era tudo que conseguiam.
Levou-o até o vestiário masculino. O capitão aguardou enquanto Sherlock buscava por algo no armário de roupas novas. Nenhum deles disse qualquer coisa. John parecia constrangido demais pra dizer algo. Sherlock não parecia se importar com o silêncio.
John entered. The door was still opened, since the men had entered with the piano.  Mr. Fergusson was a short, fat bloke, with a huge mustache. It made John giggle from remembering Sherlock's reaction to his mustache. He'd absolutely hate that one.
“Vou gozar” John avisou, por educação. Mas tinha a leve impressão de que Sherlock não se importava com essa informação, senão para aumentar a velocidade com que movimentava a cabeça pra frente e pra trás.
John kept looking at Mycroft. Mary looked at him as well, but she seemed to understand more than her husband. John was still holding the folder, not knowing whether to accept it or not. But if he'd give it back, it wouldn't reach Sherlock anymore. So he nodded, closed the folder, and put it on a desk. Then folded his arms.
Sherlock odiava rugby. Era muito cru, tinha pouco - ou nenhum - ritmo. Nem beleza. Eram montes de músculos batendo um contra o outro. Pouco entendia das regras também. Não via como o ballet poderia ser misturado com o rugby.
John olhou para a calça, engoliu em seco, e ia recusar, quando Sherlock colocou um protetor genital sobre a calça. “E isso também”.
The third time John heard of Sherlock was two years later. Lisa was already talking more than she should. Things were fine. His marriage was fine. His job was fine. Everything was fine.
John deixou a mochila pra trás e se aproximou do instrutor. Limpou a garganta para chamar-lhe a atenção. Sherlock largou o que tinha nas mãos dentro do armário e se virou para o capitão do time.
Agora John podia ver a expressão de Sherlock pelo espelho. A boca sempre aberta, arfando e deixando escapar gemidos constantes diretos de sua garganta. E logo houve a inquietude dos seus quadris quando um dedo deixou de ser o suficiente.
John nodded. Somehow, that talk was making him feel very uncomfortable. Because now Mycroft knew he wouldn't come back. And Mycroft was rarely wrong.
“Não tenho lubrificante. Temos que ficar em um dedo” John avisou. “Mas acho que consigo te fazer gozar assim”.
“Agora nós vamos tentar o espacate” disse Sherlock. E sem grandes esforços, o bailarino desceu até o chão, pernas abertas ao máximo, em 180 graus. Atrás dele, no espelho, John via o formato das costas do instrutor, e com algum esforço, a forma com que seu bumbum ficou. Firme, e com os músculos tensionados.
John levantou-se sob as provocações do time, que tentava fazê-lo soltar o tecido do shorts, firmemente agarrado pelo capitão. Sherlock novamente insistiu que o time devia continuar os exercícios, e deixou a sala com John.
John sentiu todo o ar de seus pulmões se esvair. Sua ereção pulsava em suas calças. Suas mãos foram imediatamente para as nádegas do rapaz. Apertando a carne, forçando ambos os dedões entre elas. Sem muito pensar a respeito, John baixou as próprias calças para liberar o membro já dolorido e esfregá-lo contra a bunda de Sherlock.
John Watson era o capitão do time. Havia sido capitão do time pelos últimos dois anos. Um feito memorável, já que ele estava cursando medicina em Barts ao mesmo tempo. Ao contrário dos demais jogadores, John não era muito alto. Mas era rápido, inteligente, tomava decisões sob pressão, e era bastante forte para seu tamanho. Fora dele a ideia de levar o time para as aulas de ballet. Eles eram muito lentos, confiavam no tamanho para encontrões, não tentavam driblar. E depois de muito insistir que eles tentassem driblar de vez em quando, para manter o jogo fluido, John percebeu que eles simplesmente não tinham a agilidade necessária para driblar.
Ao final da primeira aula, Sherlock sorria enquanto os rapazes reclamavam de dores nos músculos e de estarem cansados. Ou de como seus pés nunca doeram tanto. Enquanto eles buscavam seus pertences para irem embora, Sherlock resolveu lembrá-los de vir com calças de lycra no dia seguinte. Fez questão de olhar para o capitão do time enquanto dizia isso.
Seu membro pulsou uma, duas vezes, e Sherlock soltou um gemido mais alto, um grito contido, e se agarrou em John com braços e pernas estremecendo, arqueando, músculos em fortes espamos. Ao redor do membro de John, ele contraía conforme jorrava seu sêmen entre os dois. John teve de segurá-lo com força para evitar que ambos caíssem, mas conseguiu manter o equilíbrio mesmo quando Sherlock ameaçou desequilibrar ambos ao tornar-se super sensível e tentar fugir das estocadas.
"Hey, mate. I'm the last renter." John said, raising a hand. "Sorry, I was just nostalgic. John Watson."
"Let me in." John said, between his teeth. Now he was really about to punch Mycroft. And Sherlock, for hiding inside.
“Mais óbvio” ela insistiu, piscando um olho. “Vem, termina logo isso. A Kate já está me mandando mensagem”.
"I'm afraid that would be highly dangerous. For both of you. And Sherlock wouldn't risk your life. Or the baby's." he said, then gave a harsh look at Mary. "I should get going now." he faked a smile and turned around. "Good to meet the baby." he said, before simply going out through the door.
He hadn't sent a single letter or phonecall. The bastard. Not even when his daughter was born, not even to ask if everything was okay. So he didn't ask. For a very long time. It seemed like it was very easy for Sherlock to simply disappear without notice. After all, it was the second time he did that. And he didn't want to hear the excuse that, in his defense, he warned him that they'd never speak again. He knew better, though. They couldn't be apart forever, Sherlock would come back eventually. After six months or so. He'd be back. If not for John, for London, for everything he loved most.
"What? No. " Mycroft said, almost offended. "Believe me, I wish he was, at least I'd have someone to piss off."
O capitão aceitou o convite silencioso. Aproximou-se por trás e pôs as mãos na cintura do dançarino, que era mais alto, mas não o suficiente para que não conseguisse fazê-lo arrepiar os pêlos da nuca com um beijo bem aplicado em seu pescoço.
John dobrou o dedo levemente. Havia estudado medicina demais pra não saber como encontrar uma próstata com facilidade. Mordeu seu próprio lábio inferior antes de assistir a reação de Sherlock.
Sherlock havia cruzado os braços. No auge dos seus 18 anos, ele não havia tomado a responsabilidade da aula de crianças para si por motivo nenhum. E certamente não era para ajudar o coordenador, que havia colocado todos os melhores professores nas aulas de adultos profissionais, até ficar sem ninguém pra dar aula aos grupos menos “glamurosos”.
“Toquem a planta dos pés com a mão. Esse é o alongamento tradicional, vocês devem fazer isso antes de jogar”.
Não ficou muito claro a que tipo de problema Sherlock se referia, mas John achou melhor não perguntar e só aceitar o protetor sem dizer mais nada.
Sherlock finalmente revirou os olhos. “Estarão dançando ballet, não treinando rugby, senhor. Foi o que me disse”.
Pressionou o corpo contra as costas de Sherlock, sua ereção presa entre ambos, achando algum espaço entre as nádegas do dançarino. Assistiu-o pelo espelho fechar os olhos e prender a respiração enquanto sentia-o forçar o quadril para trás. Quando John baixou as mãos para enfiá-las no cós da calça do Sherlock, o bailarino o surpreendeu novamente, dobrando o corpo pra frente, as costas arqueadas, fazendo sua bunda arrebitar contra John.
“Aww, você está esperando ele te chamar pra sair, é isso?” Irene sorriu e apertou as bochechas de Sherlock, que se desvencilhou logo. “Talvez deva deixar as coisas mais óbvias pra ele”.
“Mr. Holmes. Sherlock. Eu…” ele parou para pensar. Não tinha preparado nada pra dizer naquela hora. Nunca preparava. “Estava pensando se você não poderia me dar uma aula particular. Ou mais de uma. Tem alguns movimentos que eu não faço bem, e a turma é grande pra dar atenção pra todos”.
Greg, do outro lado da sala, estava observando John e rindo baixo. Ele era o único dos presentes que sabia do interesse de John pelo sexo masculino. E era também o único que sabia exatamente o tipo favorito do capitão. E se ele pudesse descrever 30 características, o instrutor de ballet marcaria positivo em 31 delas.
“Será um minicurso de um mês. Tente ensinar alguma coisa a eles, Sherlock. E lembre-se, eles são jogadores de rugby, não dançarinos”.
And then the man moved to proudly sit on Sherlock's leather chair. John felt like the man was sitting on his chest. His teeth clenched, but he kept the polite smile. How dare he sit where he sat? How dare he? How come Mycroft didn't take the chair as well? Certainly Mrs. Hudson wouldn't mind.
Entre uma lambida e outra, John reparou que goras de pré-ejaculação pingavam do membro de Sherlock. Era crueldade demais continuar tentando-o, então John deu uma boa lambida no próprio dedo indicador e pressionou a entrada. Houve uma leve resistência de início, mas ficou claro que o dançarino relaxara e deixara ser penetrado tão logo percebeu o que acontecia. E não só deixou, como forçou o corpo pra trás mais uma vez. Apesar de apertado ao redor do dedo de John, Sherlock facilmente deixara o capitão meter seu dedo até a junta dentro do dançarino. Houve um gemido mais gutural. Viu as penas frequejarem. John teve que tocar seu próprio membro dolorido com a ideia de que Sherlock era tão sensível ali. Seu cérebro já estava fazendo maravilhas para imaginar seu pau no lugar de seu dedo.
Mycroft wasn't even looking at him anymore. He was staring blankly at the box. The Holmes father put a hand on his wife's shoulder as she seemed to start crying.
"I don't think so. He's very attached to the new place." Mycroft answered. "And he's exiled anyway. He can't come back, you should remember."
Dentre as várias coisas que se passaram na cabeça de John, ele decidiu optar pelo silêncio. Qualquer coisa que dissesse seria imprópria agora. Ao invés disso, ele simplesmente fez que sim com a cabeça e tomou o kit para ir se vestir.
Durante o espacate, Sherlock notou que John evitava tocar as próprias coxas. Era óbvio que havia ganhado assaduras nas coxas devido à fricção do shorts e de suas pernas grossas. E também não conseguia ir muito longe no espacate, já que o shorts não lhe permitia.
Uma das sobrancelhas de Sherlock se ergueu. Ele analisou o rosto do loiro um momento, confuso. Seu semblante era firme até aquele momento. Só mudou quando compreendeu o que John quis dizer. Ele abriu a boca, surpreso, e, sem jeito, limpou a garganta e voltou para o centro da sala.
Primeiro, John tentou mostrar a eles peças de ballet para que imitassem os pés. Depois, chamou uma amiga sua para mostrar alguns movimentos. A partir da melhora do desempenho, o técnico chamou um professor de ballet da comunidade. A história foi crescendo, chegou nos jornais, e eles foram convidados a fazer um minicurso de ballet na Royal Ballet.
A cada estocada, John sentia Sherlock tornando-se mais quente. “Forte” ele implorou em determinado momento. “Mais forte, capitão”.
"So." John said, after about 5 minutes staring at those words, like if they'd change at any point. "More lies. So many lies."
“Na minha bolsa” Sherlock interrompeu, quase como se tivesse tomado a primeira oportunidade pra falar, antes que outro gemido irrompesse de seus lábios.
Um ardor se espalhou pelo peito de John e subiu pelo pescoço até suas bochechas. Ele prontamente correu para fechar a porta e voltou para o meio da sala.
John não precisou de outro aviso. Puxou o cós da calça que ainda restava entre ele e o paraíso de suas fantasias. Encontrou um Sherlock completamente depilado. Talvez preparado para esse momento? Não pensou mais que dois segundos sobre isso. Logo voltara a esfregar seu membro entre as nádegas de Sherlock. Agora muito mais sensível, carne contra carne, levemente lubrificado pelo líquido translúcido vazando da cabeça de seu pau. Sentia-se pulsar. Seu coração podia muito bem estar batendo bem ali. Mandando impulsos de prazer por seu tronco.
“Vocês têm algum...um que seja… talvez um número só… maior que esse?” ele perguntou, limpando a garganta algumas vezes.
Isso, com certeza, dificultou a questão. John teve de fazer algum esforço, bastante desengonçado, pra encostar na ponta dos dedos.
Mrs. Hudson nodded. "Well, the new renter, Mr. Fergusson, is upstairs. But he's a nice man." she said.
“Você não está aproveitando a oportunidade” disse Irene. Ela soprou a fumaça para fora da janela, sorrindo.
O time de rugby chegou uma semana depois, acompanhados de uma equipe de filmagem. Sherlock os observou chegando. Ele e Irene, sua companheira de dança, estavam na sala de treinamento, debruçados na janela. Ela fumava um cigarro roubado da bolsa de Sherlock. Ele resmungava enquanto os brutamontes saíam do carro. Eles eram enormes. Todos eles. Ombros largos, pernas grossas, tronco robusto.
A mão do instrutor a, literalmente, 10 centímetros de estar indecente, fez uma gota de suor percorrer a testa de John.
John não insistiu. Ajudou Sherlock a pôr ambos os pés no chão, e ia terminar sozinho, se o rapaz não tivesse tão logo caído de joelhos em sua frente para arrancar a camisinha e tomar John em sua boca com avidez.
“Poderia ser” Irene riu. “Se você tentasse pedir o telefone do senhor capitão, talvez fosse você a sair no sábado à noite”.
John obedeceu imediatamente, quase que como saindo de um transe. Moveu o dedo quase todo pra fora e pra dentro novamente. Com a estocada, Sherlock gemeu satisfeito.
Mr. Fergusson rushed to shake John's hand. "Oh, yes, I know. I rented the flat knowing that it was first yours and Sherlock's. It's a shame what happened t him, isn't it?"
" It's a pleasure to be here. Where he stood. Such an honor. To walk where he walked, and standing where he stood. And even sitting where he used to sit!".
Greg ria tanto que engasgou com a cerveja. Bateu no peito para ajudar a bebida a descer e voltou a rir, agora roxo.
“Não, espera” ela disse, afastando a cabeça das mãos de Sherlock. Levantou um dedo para pedir pausa. “De verdade. Você nem pensa em falar com ele? Nem uma palavrinha depois da aula? Trocar telefones. Você mesmo disse que ele cursa medicina, que parece ser gentil. Bissexual no armário. O que exatamente você está esperando? Vai continuar torturando o capitão até ele explodir?”
Six months later, Mycroft paid him a visit. He was changing Lisa's diapers when the bell rang. Mary opened the door.
John stands from his chair and comes to sit on the edge of Sherlock's bed, carefully removing Sherlock's hands from where they are still picking at his cover, taking them both in his, before bringing them up to his chest and pressing them over his heart.
"Jesus Christ, Sherlock, that was amazing." John pants out. "Let me get my breath back and I'll return the favour."
“Come on, Sweetheart.  Auntie Molly will be here soon to pick you up.  Daddy and Sherlock have got to help Uncle Greg.”  John hitches her up in his arms, making his way carefully downstairs, knowing Molly will be arriving soon.
“Both.  I can see that you’d like to be outside enjoying the weather whilst you can, and I admit I can see the appeal myself.”  He hesitates but feels obliged to speak the rest.  “It will also add an element of veracity to our visit here.”
Sherlock looks at John from beneath half lowered lashes, tugging his lip into his mouth and shifting his hips up. John's gaze is flicking all over him, watching Sherlock's teasing flex and pale hand playing at his pyjama waistband. John licks his lips, colour high on his cheeks, heart beating fast beneath Sherlock's other hand. He shifts slightly on the bed, easing the pressure on his burgeoning erection.
John moved back up the length of Sherlock's body, still keeping his body lifted, just teasing with the briefest of contacts. This time John's kisses were less chaste, more intense, his tongue thrusting into Sherlock's mouth, meeting and caressing his tongue with his own. He licked deeply into Sherlock's mouth, running his tongue along the edge of Sherlock's teeth, exploring the roof of his mouth, then returning to stroke his tongue against Sherlock's, finally mimicking a gentle thrusting motion - a promise of what was still to come. John returned his attentions to Sherlock's full lips, a mixture of nipping and sucking kisses, drawing away each time Sherlock tried to reciprocate, returning to cut off the end of each gasped protest. Sherlock arched his back, desperately trying to make more points of contact, all the time battling to retain some small measure of self control. Frantically Sherlock reached for John, once again threading his fingers back through John's hair before pulling him in for a deeper kiss, groaning with John when his wish was finally granted.  Suddenly both men gasped, John had lowered his body and now both cocks were touching.  At the first contact a desperate bolt of intense pleasure shot through them. Both men rocked against each other, foreskin sliding back to expose the sensitive head of their cocks, pre-come easing the friction, making each slide intense. Groaning with pleasure, Sherlock threw his head back, exposing the marks John gave him. Their hearts racing, bodies covered in a sheen of sweat, the lean muscles of both men glistening as they moved.
John doesn't want to fall back into a world where he can’t recognise what is real and what is not but exhaustion licks once again at him, pulling him once more into its grasp.
Sherlock had chosen that particular moment to return, stating it was hardly the first time that England had been in danger since his supposed death.
Sherlock just stares at her, amazed and disappointed once again at Mary’s continued ability to always put herself first, pregnant or otherwise, whatever the situation.
“Perhaps so, John, but you have made me better; a better detective and a better man, more than I knew I was capable of being.”
He leaves, the soft hiss of the door swinging shut innocuous after what has just ensued in the hospital room.
"I guess the next obvious question now would be 'first kiss'," Sherlock muses, his hands in their typical thinking position, tips of his index fingers just resting on his lower lip. "So let's skip that." He meets John's curious expression with an equally curious one of his own. "First sexual experience with a man."
Nodding politely at each person as Mary introduces them the surgeon finally allows his gaze to settle on her.  Her dismissive attitude is jarring but not overly unusual in worried family members.  He decides to privately alert the nurses about the conflict that appears to exist between his patient’s wife and his patient’s friends.
The rapid bleeping of the heart monitor betrays the turmoil that Sherlock is experiencing, the way that his heart is clinging to the hope of what he thinks John is implying. But Sherlock needs the words to be spoken between them, needs for there to be no more misunderstandings between them.
"But who, Sherlock? Who would go to all that trouble?" John's own brow is now furrowed, trying to work the mystery out.
"Sherlock?" At the sound of his name Sherlock's gaze briefly settles on John's face before darting away. "Sherlock." John's voice is stronger now, but still rich with kindness, forcing Sherlock's attention back to him. "I told you before. I'm back working alongside you, living alongside you, for as long as you need me." When Sherlock finally meets his eye John smiles, he tries to make his expression reassuring but is fairly certain it just comes out looking worried. "Besides, I need a holiday!" Sherlock nods briefly before returning to his packing; John knows a dismissal when he sees one. Barely catching Sherlock's whispered words as he walks to his own room,
“So, that’s it then?” John queries.  “No more Mary?  No more living in the shadows for Sherlock and I?  I’m not going to lie if people ask, though.  I will say that she shot Sherlock and that she ended up dying as a direct response to this.  I can’t live a lie anymore.”
"You're lying, John." Sherlock allowed a brief smirk to appear before the throbbing in his cheek intensified too much for him to maintain it.
“John?  You know it won’t always be like this? I won’t always be like this?”  Sherlock finally replies earnestly.  “I’ll still get lost in the work.  Still want to spend time on my experiments.  Still be an arsehole from time to time.”
“John?”  Sherlock doesn’t need to speak loudly, they are standing so close that even a whisper can be heard. “Have you ever considered looking for a new partner?”
John looks confused at the sudden change in topic, valiantly trying to gather his muddled thoughts and reactions. "Er, of course. Get rid of the last lingering feel of the hospital, good idea." Sherlock can see the moment John takes refuge in his Doctor mode. "Don't have the water on too hot. Leave the door unlocked in case you need me. Let me change the dressing for a clean, dry one as soon as you are done." John shifts in his chair, uncomfortably aware of Sherlock's continued gaze.
John stares blankly at the menu he had automatically caught. "You're going out? Let me grab a shower after you, wake myself up a bit, and I'll go with you."
"Is that your medical opinion, Doctor Watson?" Sherlock queries.  He tries to keep his voice serious as befits their overall situation, but John's sudden humour is contagious and a chuckle escapes him.
"Christ, you really are gorgeous." John whispers as he stretches up to steal a kiss from a shocked Sherlock.
“Okay then.  My first rule; no setting me up with deliberately awful dates.  If you’re going to do this, I want it done properly.”
"Yes, I think so." Sherlock eases his legs over the edge of the bed, pleased with his progress and the proud smile John shoots in his direction.
As he had predicted, she strikes him again, this time with the back of her hand across his cheek.  The force behind it is so hard that it causes the chair to rock dangerously  and for a moment Sherlock believes he is going to strike the floor but the chair merely teeters before regaining its equilibrium.  Sherlock’s eyes water and again he spits out blood, he cautiously explores the inside of his cheek with his tongue, the skin has been shredded by his teeth and blood continues to leak into his mouth.
"I'm so sorry for what you've been through, dear. I'll just pop back downstairs and leave you to get sorted." She pauses for a moment before pulling John into a motherly hug. He resists for the merest second before dropping his bag and curving his free arm around her, allowing himself to lightly rest in her embrace. The moment he feels the threat of tears, he pulls away, pinching at the bridge of his nose and clearing his throat. He manages a half-grimace, half-smile when he feels the soft skin of Mrs Hudson's palm briefly caress his cheek before he hears her walk slowly back down the stairs.
John had always thought it was likely that Sherlock was gay and probably somewhere on the asexual spectrum, from the small understanding that John had in that area - medical knowledge being far too clinical to apply to someone like Sherlock.
John opens his mouth to raise an objection but is quickly saved the effort when a cool, collected voice drifts into the room from the kitchen.
"Technically right Sherlock." John rubbed at the back of his neck, before running his hand over his face, trying to keep the fond smile away. " But as I remember it, we were bloody handcuffed together and running away from the cops! It was either hold your hand or have my arm pulled out of its socket! Really not my idea of fun!"  Pausing again, Sherlock could see that John was remembering the after events; events that led up to Sherlock standing on the roof of St. Bart's, the events that led to his 'death'. He watched as John straightened his shoulders and could pinpoint the exact moment that John made the decision not to dwell in the past. "And you, you bastard, had held a gun to my head in front of half of bloody Scotland Yard! I could plead I was in shock.  Didn't know what I was doing."
"Quite." Sherlock presses a careful hand to his chest, wincing at the sudden surge of pain. "I've asked him to bring all his records over.  There's a slim chance, but one I'm willing to take, that we will recognise Mary or an associate of hers in the photos or descriptions."
Lestrade, Mycroft and Sherlock walk along the labyrinthine corridors, quiet except for the intermittent squeak of a wheel on Sherlock’s drip stand.  Lestrade would love to make a quip about The Last of The Summer Wine or The Three Amigos but he suspects his sense of humour won’t be appreciated.  The hospital is built like a rabbit warren and its long corridors wind off in various directions, making for a long walk to the Intensive Care Unit.  The group stops from time to time to allow Sherlock to rest; Lestrade notices that Sherlock isn’t as strong as he thinks he is and knows that if Sherlock is left to his own devices he will try to struggle on.
I need to feel you come inside me and I need to come against you. Please, you are everything I need.”
"Yes dear, we know that now don't we." Mrs Hudson patted his cheek gently; sympathy and understanding clear on her kind face.  "But we didn't know that then.  Your plan worked too well; John believed he'd seen you dead. And he died there with you, on that pavement. The man who came back here was not the man who had left earlier that day. It destroyed him Sherlock.  He'd suffered alone for over a year, trying to live again, but he was a shell of a man. An empty shell. And Mary? Mary came along just at the right moment I think, just when it was all becoming too much to cope with." Mrs Hudson paused and Sherlock knew she was making sure he understood the significance of what she was saying. John had struggled to live without him, had almost given up on living until Mary had found him.  "I didn't know about her until just before you came back. But she put him back together a little, she understood what he went through. I suspect she knows how he feels about you actually."
Standing suddenly, Greg makes to leave but Mycroft is beside him, a firm hand holding his upper arm at the bicep before John has even risen from his seat. Mycroft gentles his hold but does not release Greg.
Billy turns his keen eye on Sherlock, taking in with a quick glance more than many people would in five times the amount of time.
"You're an idiot John." A brief laugh is startled from John and Sherlock uses the pause in his words to grip John's fingers fiercely. "As always you see, but you do not observe. You saw all the things I have done, but you didn't observe why I did them."
, oh God..." Sherlock's hand moves to rest in John's hair. "You don't have to..." Sherlock's voice is coming out in short gasps, his hips moving in tiny increments.
For a moment John looks less than happy with the reasoning for the decision but nods in agreement, before getting up from his chair, using their joined hands to gently encourage Sherlock to stand.  He moves the few steps that are required to bring him closer to Sherlock.  Slowly, allowing Sherlock time to move away if he feels uncomfortable, John stretches up on to his toes.  Again, he meets Sherlock’s gaze before he closes his eyes, golden eyelashes fanning across sun dappled cheeks and Sherlock is mesmerised.  His own eyes flutter shut as John’s breath lightly caresses his skin, a second later the merest touch of John’s lips is felt against a cheek that he is sure has never been so sensitive before.  Nerve endings light up under John’s touch and for a moment Sherlock is overwhelmed, surely a kiss to the cheek shouldn't incite such a reaction?  People do it all the time; parents to their children, friends when they greet each other or say farewell.  He has kissed Mrs. Hudson’s cheek on numerous occasions and her own lips, decidedly different to John’s, have touched his cheek in greeting, in amusement, with affection.  But still this kiss feels different.  Sherlock knows that it is only for their act this weekend, he does, but somehow he can't extinguish the small flame of hope that ignites at John’s touch.
John’s only response is to nod, but it’s enough for Sherlock to know that John agrees with the compromise.
"For what it may be worth, Doctor Watson, I will ensure that you also have the support of the British Government and I am sure the Detective Inspector here will offer his full support." Greg nods in vehement agreement of Mycroft's words.
John wets his lips, swallowing against the anxiety that rises within him. “And when I wake I can’t tell if they are memories of something real or not.
A few hours later Mycroft is interrupted in his perusal of a document he rests on his knees by a soft ‘Mr Holmes.’
"It was inside a hidden pocket within his mattress. The bedroom was in complete disarray, similar to what you saw elsewhere in the house, but the bed had been left relatively undisturbed. John, I think someone wants us to find these gems, someone who can't be seen to be involved." Sherlock's long legs are angled towards John, a deep frown rests at the bridge of his nose and his brow is furrowed. "It's the only thing that makes sense of all the facts. Lechner was taken whilst walking in London; he was kept somewhere that even Mycroft's sources couldn't find. Later, he turns up dead; a professional shot, quick and lethal. He was malnourished but not noticeably tortured, someone was after information from him but they were initially against using force on him. The shot was to silence him, to prevent him telling his story, which means there was something pertinent to tell. The firefly carcasses were left in his pockets, the dirt left on his shoes. My reputation is such, that it is obvious that I would be called in and that I would discover these things. Someone wanted us in Austria; someone wanted us to follow those clues."
