"Stop," John ordered, slapping him sharply. "You wanted this. You will bloody well take it."
Sensing her fragile position, the Dominatrix didn't move a muscle. She just stayed where she was, breathing hard.
"I don't get... hyper," Sherlock said with a pout.
At that, Mycroft nodded and made a grateful sound.
Sherlock spun and faced his brother. "Irene?"
“I guess, sir,” he replied, but he was still unsure.
“Waffles,” Finn said automatically.
"Yeah, babe, the things I plan for you are definitely not child friendly," John patted his boy's knee affectionately.
He swallowed, but knew what he needed to say, the full truth, he wasn’t ashamed of it after all. “My Dom, Doctor Watson.” He turned to said Dom and didn’t think twice about the appellation that was about to come out. “Sir, this is Sergeant Sally Donovan… an old friend.”
"Hello doggies."
This chapter is tougher than normal, mainly because I feel sherlock is not responding the way he should be by this point in the contract. John has to do something he hadn’t thought he would have to do so things may be harsher. JOHN KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING. And it will not always be like this.
Greg screwed his face up looking as if he was going to cry at any moment.
“Good. When we're done here you'll have an hour to write out 'I'll not argue with my Dom again' as many times as you can. If I don't think you tried your hardest on them, you will continue on with them through Miss Adler's visit.”
"Something else we did regularly as children," Mycroft added.
“On your front,” John added when he saw the look of horror on his sub’s face. The lack of verbal objection spoke volumes. He wouldn’t want to lay down on a freshly paddled purple arse either.
John jerked his head in Finn’s direction. “Go on.”
“You stay there for as long as you need, Sherlock, I'll be here.”
“You'll get your interview with him when he's had the sufficient cooling off period.”
John shook his head sadly and leant down he pulled Sherlock to his feet by his arm rather than his hair.
“Until when?!” Sherlock yelled. He leapt off the bed, fists clenched, but he stopped himself doing anything rash to the Dom. The consequences would have been great even if this man had the patience of a saint. Mycroft would also be extremely unimpressed, just what he needed, an unimpressed angry brother.
“Yes, sir.”
The first strike fell, bringing Sherlock out of his thoughts. He hadn't even been aware the Dom had left his side to find the cane in the first place.
Mycroft winced as he tried to twist his wrist in the cuffs.
"You're being my good boy, now, aren't you?"
Releasing his grip, Greg patted his boy on the cheek. "Good. Eat your chips." He dropped his left hand to his boy's thigh.
“N-No sir!”
“Can you- Can you stay with me, sir? Tonight?” he sounded hesitant, but hopeful.
"Before you do anything, tie this to it," Greg said holding the rope up that was attached to Sherlock's bollocks.
He saw who it was and gave Sherlock strict instructions to remain exactly where he was. Not that the younger man could move anyway. It just might give him a sense of achievement if he could obey his Dom.
“Do not let any of that move.” John snapped a picture on his phone to compare to in a while.
In a way, Sherlock was kind of looking forward to it, it was far longer than the current plug in his arse. John had said a matter of hours ago that the one he was currently wearing was only a control plug, it had no bearing on the sub's pleasure.
"You've done nothing wrong mate," Greg assured him, resting his hand on the shorter man's shoulder.
The detective managed a slight nod, a tear leaking from his left eye. John wiped the tear away and kissed him on the temple. He kept running his hand along Sherlock's spine, up and down, as he watched him. He moved his hands around his boy's chest and tweaked at his nipples, "That's a good boy," he whispered into his ear before biting his ear lobe.
“Go on, pet, you can take it if you understand the deal I am offering you.”
The grounds were so extensive they didn’t see any of the guards, nor any of the staff, Sherlock still couldn’t believe no one had tried to stop him when he had climbed out of the attic roof a few weeks ago. He was still feeling proud of himself for that. Nothing was better than beating his brother.
"I asked you a question, boy!"
It took a few moments for Sherlock to manage it, but he did.
Seeing how the detective's back stiffened, John let out a bark of a laugh. "Right. Go ahead, Mycroft, do that. My pet will absolutely love picking it up off the floor and counting it."
At ‘hot copper’ John looked even more confused.
It wasn’t until they reached Sherlock’s room did he believe John was serious.
“If this is what he’s like during, the difference between before and after is going to be massive. Even this morning he was… I don’t know… put it this way when I knew you weren’t there I felt like waiting until you were because I thought as soon as he saw me he would be out of the door. But I invited him to come along and the first thing he said was ‘My Dom’s out’.”
“Bring them.”
"I think we should relocate back to the mansion, dad?" Mycroft prompted.
Still, they stayed where they were, pinning a thrashing Mycroft to the floor.
Sherlock nodded.
He swallowed again, his throat constricting against the inside of his collar.
“I would yelp, sir.”
She didn't let go of his hair, keeping his head held upright so he couldn't really move.
"Sherlock."
John took that as a compliment and went to pick a humbler out from the collection.
John chuckled at that and pulled his sub to his feet by his finger in his collar.
“What crime sc- But I've been working with you all day!”
“Before you get dressed,” John took Sherlock to the bathroom by the hand and removed the tip from the hollow sound still in his cock, “pee.”
4 men moved forward to comply at once, 4 went to stand in a security stance around Sherlock and John and the remaining 4 men set themselves up around Greg and the government official.
“Lay over it. Arms down the sides. You remember your safe word? What is it?”
"Don't worry, I told Mycroft where we were grabbing food. He'll get yours there... eventually."
Sherlock ducked his head as an alternative to arguing. He hoped it was a good alternative.
"Love the enthusiasm, boy," Greg laughed. He leant forward and shoved his fingers into Mycroft's waiting mouth.
Sherlock shifted to help the boy sit up but Finn flinched and rolled from the sofa, taking off at speed up the stairs.
It wasn't long before his hand reached out and rested on Sherlock's leg. The detective looked at it in surprise then looked back out the window.
John had lubed up his fingers and was playing with Sherlock's hole, running his finger around the puckered rim.
“You'll count these 6 strokes and if I can't hear you, you know how it works.”
Finn’s bottom lip popped out, but once again he slowed down.
"Did you seriously think your flat mate would be knelt at your feet either?"
“Can I go to Uncle Mycof on weekend?”
Spotting the Dom, Sherlock pushed himself to his knees, his hands taking the more uncomfortable position behind his head.
“Sir! I’m sorry sir. I tried to run, sir. “
The four of them sat there like idiots for a long time. It reminded John of the day before when he had ended up having to follow his sub up to the apartment after Sherlock's worrying performance. He gripped his boy's hand all the tighter. A sense of unease growing despite the pleasantness of the moment.
Greg melted into it, clearing being caught by surprise as well. "This is nice, sir," he whispered when they broke apart. "Just the two of us."
Locating the warrant card, Greg stepped back. “And what about you?” he asked of the other man.
“Because I control it. I always control it. I do it when I feel safe, almost as a reflex, and I’ve never done it in response to Service before.”
Irene joined tge discussion, "And I intend to see that you gentlemen make up for your last visit. I don't like it when one of my friends is upset."
The simple fact Sherlock hadn't immediately snapped 'no!' Was answer enough.
A cry finally escaped the government official's lips and Irene stopped shocking him with the taser. "There now. That was much more satisfying."
“Sir-“
"Why?" Greg asked. "You got pissed off with him for acting out for so long. There's nothing wrong with that. I can't even say you overreacted by wanting to leave. I would have done. This is his way of making sure."
"You and Sherlock are made for each other."
"Oi!" John dragged his sub away from the government official. "Shut it."
"I know," Eurus agreed. "Mycroft has always been insufferable.
He didn't know how long he sat there but it was long enough to make him thoroughly bored and quit worrying about being in trouble.
"Look in the outer space room. I thought it fit in nicely with the chrome and science fictiony feel."
"Do you ever wish Mycroft would Dom again?"
This time, John took control. "Come on, munchkin. Let's go get drinks."
John smiled. The Superintendent had such a tender, loving look on his face. "You know, you're a real softie."
“I've told you before, I'll not have you acting embarrassed when I ask you a question.” The doctor's voice was void of emotion as he spoke, his boy would behave. And he'd do it soon.
“Come on, Finn, time you finished your breakfast,” John patted his knee.
Somewhat sheepishly Sherlock manoeuvred himself beside the Dom and leant back on his heels. John absently moved his left hand out and guided his head to his knee. Sherlock closed his eyes.
Sherlock looked up in shock then nodded, a smile tugging at his lips.
"Good morning, pet," John said, leaning forward to ruffle Sherlock's curls.
Mycroft popped off for a second. "You've already come once today, sir," he couldn't help but point out.
The sub gave a heavy sigh, then knee walked to the corner John had indicated. He faced the corner and tried to settle in for the wait.
The detective scooped the little boy up and let him sit on his hip. "What do you think, Finn? Do you want to be a ring bearer?"
The doctor just grinned broadly and scooped him up out of his chair. John handed Finn an empty glass, then picked up one for himself. Together, they ended up in front of the drink station.
Greg chuckled. "That's the truth. Still, I like Myc just the way he is."
"Moriarty," was Sherlock's terse reply. He let himself be handcuffed without a fight. They were far too outnumbered to attempt an escape.
Eurus shook her head. "What's that?"
"No, sir," Sherlock sighed. "Sorry, sir."
The Dom had stripped down to just his pants and Sherlock was laid out on his front, his head and shoulder on the older man's chest as he softly dozed in and out of awareness, quite content in his little bubble.
Shaking his head, John headed for the play rooms. Actually, he still thought Greg was irresistibly cute. He laughed as he heard Greg yell out, when he caught him up he was fully dressed again and had clearly gotten rid of the vibrator.
Sherlock did what he was told, his eyes drifting up to meet the older man's but it was clear they were glassy, he was buried deep in subspace. It was obvious he was trying to pay attention, even though he was a little out of sync.
When the Dom had got bored of watching Sherlock, he’d dragged the younger man to the kitchen. Sherlock had been gobsmacked to realise what the Dom planned to do to him. He was now knelt in the corner of the living room, facing the wall with his hands behind his head. John hadn’t even cuffed them together. He was forcing good behaviour, and it was working. He was starting to feel just a little bit bad.
Sherlock gagged as he was grabbed by the scruff of his neck by his sister.
Before he knew what was happening Finn had lunged for him.
John's deep, ragged breath slowed as Greg held him tight to the wall.
“There!” Greg yelled, pointing through the window.
“It's been a long time before I could properly meet you, Mr. Holmes.”
"How harsh do you want it?"
Finn opened his eyes and hugged Sherlock. He'd been pretending to sleep. "I don't want to go away from you!"
“What did I do to punish you then?”
"I think you should put the stool back first," Eurus ordered.
“No Dom’s ever held my hand that way before, sir. It’s usually my wrist and uncomfortably tight.” He’d done it again, told the doctor something about his past. Something he hadn’t wanted to, something that had just come out because of the patience of this man.
“Tell you what, then. I’ll make it worthwhile when we get in. You’ll head straight up to the playroom and clean the bench, then ring the bell and I’ll join you. I’ll check your wrist and, if I’m happy, we can play. How does that sound?”
“No,” he repeated, his tone far more sharp. He paced the edges of his office and closed all the blinds, then locked he door. He sunk into his chair and pointed to the floor beside him where he had pulled out a cushion.
John put two fingers at Sherlock's hole. "I have thought long and hard about where to take your training next. Of course, the three month mark has nearly passed so I've decided to keep it on a monthly rolling contract, to which you will need to agree to. I contemplated taking a military tone with you but feel you do not have the respect for authority that a subordinate would have. That leaves us with this."
"No! Not John. Never John!"
"Let him go, Mycroft," John ordered.
“33 boy. You need to learn some patience. I was merely asking you to stand so I wouldn’t have to bend over, becomes a bit of a pain in the arse with the cane.” He pushed himself up straighter. “Because of your attitude you can remain like that for the entirety of breakfast.”
"It's gentle human contact, the opposite of what I do with them." Irene pointed at the brothers.
"I won't be late again, master."
Once Sherlock had moved to obey, John headed to his study and settled in his chair.
“You’ve got to start trusting me, pet,” John whispered, helping the boy to sit up beside him as he handed him his tea.
The cold drizzle of lube at his crack made him realise he didn't really have much of a choice.
"Oh, no, no, no. We are not going to think about those things anymore."
“That will do for now,” the doctor offered, reaching out and cupping Sherlock’s cheek. “No more attitude or I can take this case away from you. Understood?”
“And you used the traditional method I take it?”
At that, the government official nodded, it seemed like a fair compromise.
“Extra time?”
Sherlock straightened his arms out with a groan.
The detective took the proffered mug with a small smile of thanks, then returned to looking out the window.
With a well-practised hand John had Sherlock’s length encased in the little metal rings, securing the cage behind his balls and locking it with similar technology to what was in the cuffs and collar. “This is more for orgasm control than denial, boy.” He tugged the collar, sharply. “You will ask for permission when the time comes, but you will also have to earn it.” The cage was fairly basic, except for the technology at the base, it would allow him to go to the loo without a problem but getting hard or reaching orgasm on his own was near-on impossible. John tugged the collar again. “Is all that understood?”
Sherlock snorted. “I’m sure Grandad can use yours.”
“For all the small things I did wrong that added up.”
“Steady, boy,” John warned, “hurt me and this will be worse.”
“Found by whom?” Sherlock snorted. “Donovan? She's setting me up, Lestrade, you blind idiot. How can-”
John was glad he had mentioned his past without a direct order or question, it was showing resemblances of trust. But he didn’t want to ruin it so changed the subject. “What way?”
“You have one more chance to ask me your question properly. Without 'you know' in the middle of it.” That was unexpected, maybe there was the beginnings of forgiveness in his tone? It was all Sherlock could hope for.
Now after this rant I am seriously contemplating ending this story here
John had to refrain from yelling at the prat.
“Are you really?”
Sherlock sighed. "What do you want?" He looked straight up at his brother when Eurus let him go.
Sherlock refused to even attempt to respond to that.
Sherlock nodded once, not caring their little moment was interrupted. "Yes, sir." The detective hurried off up the beach leaving John with the older two men.
"Shut up, boy." Greg wasn't sure how to change the position of the machine so he would have to wait for John, but he could uncuff the younger man and redo them up in front of him.
"Me too. But he hasn't eaten so I'm not sure what to do."
He had been laying out on the floor of the Dom’s study, scribbling away as he composed. Sherlock felt a tingly sensation run up his back at the doctor’s obvious approval and from that point on the competition to make the older man mad was over. He liked the tingly sensations. He would aim for more of those.
But no telling off came nor did the strap. Instead John sat back beside him. He placed two tablets into one hand and a glass of water into the other.
Out in the hall, John considered his next move. He didn't want to tie Greg up. If something went wrong, he'd need to be able to count on him in an emergency. He walked back into the sitting room, more than pleased to see Greg still knelt up straight in the corner. "Come over here, boy," he ordered collapsing on the sofa.
“How?”
“Yeah, you lost him, didn't you? Lost him and he went and did the things I told you he would do.”
“Other means?”
“It isn't the fact that I can't get out, it's the fact I can is the reason he likes me close by.”
As time passed, Sherlock had to exercise greater control over himself to stay still. He refused to let his Dom down, not again, not so soon.
"No, you rutting around like a teenager isn't his fault either."
"No, sir," Sherlock whispered softly. He gasped in surprise when John bent and kissed him. It had been the absolute last thing he had expected.
Sherlock froze where he was indeed about to argue.
“Yes, sir.”
Sherlock’s head appeared around the door and the second he caught sight of what was in John’s hands, he rushed in.
John was incredibly surprised when Sherlock did just that, he turned on his heel and headed back up the beach. He stared after him dumbly as he walked passed his brother and didn't make a comment about the ice cream.
The detective's eyes went wide at the sensation and he whimpered.
"Irene, please don't," Mycroft asked.
"Yes, it is. We may have to do this more often. Get up here." He patted his lap and waited.
"What was that?"
"Don't mention it. Now bend over the coffee table," John instructed.
It was getting late and John was exhausted. He'd been fucking himself for going on 3 hours and Sherlock didn't seem to be paying attention to the time.
In the corner Eurus laughed.
"Enough to let them go?"
He sighed heavily again and rolled over, staring into the wall hoping it's blankness would give him some inspiration.
John didn't say anything as he punched the code to the room into the system and dragged the unresisting detective behind him. He dumped him on the bed and used his already chained up hands and feet to attach him to the bed.
“This is all about him, you know.”
“20, sir,” he said immediately. He was not going through 60 with any paddle, he was an emotional wreck as it was... but he knew the second he saw his brother he would be likely to lose it again... he couldn’t face it.
“You only have half the oyster. There’s meant to be two sides,” he showed him with his hands. “And when a bit of sand or grit gets between the shell, the oyster swirls it around to try and get rid of it. Like a splinter.”
“We’ve done a lot of walking,” John pointed out, glaring at Mycroft.
“Sherlock?” The Dom had noticed the flinch.
"Ha!" Greg shifted his hold on his pet so it was more comfortable. "You only say that because he's sleeping. You know good and well he can be as much trouble as yours."
The other two laughed.
“I had pants on the last time, actually,” he spat. He had no idea how this Dom was still managing to keep on top of his temper.
"Please," Finn requested, looking hopeful.
“It was entirely understandable, Mycroft.”
His stubborness didn't go unnoticed. John went to the table and picked up a number of pegs. He came back and crouched down in front of his boy. One by one, he started attaching the pegs to his cock, running them in a line from root to tip.
Mycroft became somewhat alerted at the pairs' appearance but Sherlock didn't. He was just hanging from the cross now.
“I’m going to eat out of your hand, sir.”
John threw him into the wall, pressing him up against it like Greg would with a suspect.
"Nope."
He nodded, jerkily. “I know, sir. I’m starting to get that… It’s just… hard.” He struggled for the right word, clearly something he wasn’t used to struggling with… words.
“What exactly is going on? Donovan said he had murdered someone? Is she mad?”
He kept his eyes lowered, partly through trying to show John he wasn't being deliberately bratty and partly because he didn't want to see what was going to happen.
Greg matched his smile, spreading his mouth wide around the Dom. It wasn't just for his own benefit, though. The sub used those sounds to help gauge how good a job he was doing. Soon, he could tell he had John right on the brink, so he eased off, not wanting to make him come too soon.
Soon, the sub was completely overwhelmed. His nipples ached and burned. His insides were on fire and cramping. He couldn't control the sounds he made or the tremors that ran through him.
"Yup. John and me made him eat last night. He didn't want to."
“Well as long as you abide by my rules that I have set you and you do not remove your collar, Greg is more than aware of the situation and my rules and he will enforce them. Should you slip up, he’ll let me know.” Sherlock nodded and the Dom moved to cup his cheek. “You already knew all that, pet.”
A youngish man, with short cropped hair smirked as he reached for his mobile. He sat in the park opposite the Yard where he had been sat all day on specific orders from his boss. His back straightened in a military fashion as he dialled the number.
Sherlock didn't even grumble as he got to his feet.
Sherlock delved into his Mind Palace quickly, eager to impress the Dom after what seemed like many hours of disappointing him. “About 700 meters, sir.”
The four of them were sat in a cafe, 300 yards from the station. Sherlock was no longer a suspect; his record was clean again. Greg had grumbled about the amount of paperwork he now had to do, but was more pissed off with Mycroft who was knelt beside his Dom rather than sat.
“Boys!” Mrs. Hudson called out. “Not here!” She pulled out a couple towels from
Sherlock's mind raced as he tried to deduce what his Dom had meant by that, but he was distracted by John's hand on him.
"Don't look at me like that, Sherlock, none of this is my fault. I believe you were the one causing trouble. As was your brother. Except, he's stayed knelt where Greg left him."
“You better show enthusiasm when you suck me,” John told him, twisting his fingers around, feeling the inside of his jaw. He knew Sherlock could suck cock and he could do it well, it was only a bit of perfecting that was needed, but he had a feeling Sherlock might deliberately play down his abilities, despite having sucked John before.
The Superintendent and the doctor fully intended to free the boys, but they didn't want to make it too easy for them. They'd have to earn it.
"I'm sorry, sir." John had asked a question?
“Your what? Your solicitor?” She laughed. “Your brother? He's taken off, haven't you noticed? Or were you going to say your Dom? The Dom that found the evidence that has damned you on a murder charge?”
Luckily, John's driver pulled up in time to open the back door for them.
“Stand up, pet,” John ordered softly, but made sure to add a hint of sternness in there to ensure compliance, not like he expected him to disobey, but that was one thing he had already learnt with Sherlock Holmes; expect the unexpected.
"I can!" Irene yelled back. "You just won't let me."
“No,” he said simply.
"Thank you," Irene managed to say while glancing at the detective.
The doctor took Finn from the room and into the kitchen, aware Sherlock would want to ring Mycroft to discuss plans despite the fact Finn was only 3.
“Open it,” he ordered.
"Yes, sir." The Superintendent managed not to roll his eyes, but it was close.
“Hello, Sherlock.” John glared at him pointedly, but not for the first time today, was clearly trying to hide a smile, Sherlock obviously knew so he stopped fighting it and grinned.
Sherlock frowned, "Don't you want to-"
"I- Of course I'm not afraid you'll hurt him, sir. I worry more about what he might to do himself."
"I want to hear the noise Sherlock makes when I do this to him," Irene said with a smirk as she pulled the gag free.
“I do, to a certain extent. Sir.”
The Dom slammed him into the wall again. “Use your safe word and I'll uncuff you. You can walk out of here then. Otherwise, shut your mouth." He waited to see what would happen.
"You're thinking of James Moriarty."
“Whatever bottle you choose, I take the pill from the other one – and then, together, we take our medicine.”
“What?”
"I'm sorry, sir."
“You meant it?” Sherlock frowned.
The government official shrugged. "The last time I was blindfolded in a car, I was being abducted."
Greg smiled up at him, it seemed Mycroft had drifted back to sleep again, his head resting in his lap.
The next morning, the detective woke to find himself completely wrapped around his Dom. When he caught his Dom's eye he blushed bright red. "I’m sorry, sir," he stuttered.
"Oh, you're throwing your own weight around now, are you?" John smirked as he pushed a finger into his boys hole and wriggled it around. Seeing as his boy was bound up nicely and wouldn't be able to come no matter what, he teased his finger over Sherlock's prostate.
Sherlock didn't respond to that.
John couldn't agree more. He buckled the cuffs around his boy's ankles, then sat back and looked up at Greg, laughing. "Thanks, mate."
“What A-levels did you do?” It wasn’t really relevant, but a conversation was a conversation and the more he could get the boy talking, the more likely he was to get something of use from him. Something that could help the both of them in the future.
“Come on, pet, come up on to the bed…”
“You don't even know what she did yet.”
Sherlock had slumped back on his knees, rather than kneeling upright like Mycroft. It meant the collar was pulled tight.
Settling on the floor, Eurus poured herself another glass of wine and sipped it. "Make Mycie lose his composure."
It took all of his willpower for the Superintendent to keep his hips still. He had to bite his lip from crying out as well. Finally, thankfully, John left his finger inside him and added a second finger beside it.
John carried him all the way upstairs and paused in his bedroom, lowering him to the bed. He pulled a shirt and suit from the cupboard and placed it on the bed beside the younger man.
Sherlock turned his head and rested his cheek on the bench. "John, sir. Really, I'm sorry."
“Come in, pet,” he called.

John nodded.
Greg nodded once and snatched the leash up from the table, he bundled it up and threw it at John.
Mycroft dropped to his knees immediately, instantly regretting the impact as it made his cock throb.
Siger wanted to hug his oldest son, but held back, knowing it wouldn't be welcome.
“Do you want me to start quoting the law at you, Donovan?” It would have been quite amusing doing it at a police officer. “Until my submissive has been charged with anything, he is still my submissive! You will bloody well take me to him or I will be speaking to my solicitor. You are, of course, aware who Sherlock's brother is?”
The jerking around had woken the Dom up beside him. “Sir, please may I go?”
“Bollocks,” Sherlock snarled. “You knew he didn’t know.”
“Sir, can I-”
He looked up in surprise when the door opened. He was even further surprised to see Mycroft stood there. For once, the eldest Holmes had no umbrella.
Sherlock’s hands reluctantly fell away from the chain, but clenched so hard his knuckles went white.
Cautiously the government official crawled over and knelt before the younger Dom.
John held his hand up to stall him, the sub's head immediately lowered in obedience. John wondered if Sherlock would ever be like that.
Sherlock barked a laugh. “Play what? It’s a fifty-fifty chance.”
Sherlock had curled himself up in a ball in one of the cupboards when John found him.
John grabbed Sherlock by the scruff of the neck and Greg grabbed Mycroft.
“Would you be more comfortable if I were to undo those?” he indicated his wrists and Sherlock nodded sheepishly, distantly unaware at what caused his hesitance. “If you trust me to untie you and nothing else, raise your hands up a bit.”
Sherlock looked up at his Dom and made a point of thinking about it, despite knowing he hadn't met her. He hadn't even heard the name. Dom's, especially female ones tended to stick in his Mind Palace. He could only think of one.
Sherlock’s Dom had his SIG and the detective didn’t even want to contemplate where or why he had it in the first place. He was levelling it at the smaller of the two men; the one behind Sherlock.
"Then how?" Finn's little nose wrinkled up in confusion.
As soon as she released him and he had regained his composure, Sherlock said, "I can't believe people actually pay you to do that to them."
A month ago, John would have spread his legs with his hands and told him to hold it again. This time, however, the Dom growled wanting to make his annoyance known. He knew he had succeeded when Sherlock flinched.
“I forgot. I was so interested in Sherlock that I-” he cut off when Greg’s hand slipped into his hair.
Sherlock managed to stop himself ducking out of it. If their sister even thought about cutting his hair, Sherlock would show her a fight like she hadn't seen from him yet. John liked his curls and he wouldn't be going home without them.
"Ah," Sherlock said in realisation. Despite the look on the older woman's face, the detective found himself still not wanting to make this easy for her.He tried to jerk his head away, but her grip was too tight.
"Don't you dare," Irene hissed.
He quickly washed and then just stood under the spray, letting it try and wash away the headache of the day, but it didn't succeed.
“Kettle’s on, sir,” he offered from the door of the sitting room.

Irene paced between the two kneeling Holmeses for a while before pausing and glancing at the screen. "What would you like me to do to them now, Eurus?"
The DI got to his feet and paused before responding. "I didn't know," Greg admitted glancing at John. "And I don't appreciate your tone, pet," he added.
As soon as enough time had passed to make their point, Greg and the Superintendent approached the kneeling man, rope in hand and started making a rope harness.
“If you want to be in here so much you can stay in here,” he used the stick that he was back to heavily relying upon and pointed to a clear-of-furniture corner. “Crawl.”
“You don’t want to play with your truck?”
An hour later, John returned, freshly showered and in a clean suit, to his brat kicking and tugging at the cuffs. John just stood there and watched. The boy continued to struggle until he realised the Dom was watching him with an amused smirk. Sherlock flopped back on his bed and sighed heavily.
"I imagine you fed me when I was a little girl, just a baby. I'm going to return the favour, big brother. Open up for sister."
John didn't even ask, he just went and got the orange rope and handed it to Greg.
. 19.51MB
"What?" John asked as he pulled his boy to his feet.
Greg nodded once and headed back to the fridge in one corner.
“I’m sorry?”
“Do you want to go up to 18?”
The lack of responsiveness on Sherlock's part had started to get to the Dom. John grasped his boy's hands in his and looked him in the eyes. "I'm starting to feel like what I'm doing is unwelcome. If you want me to stop, tell me now."
Irene went to the door but Eurus cleared her throat and a guard appeared at the door.
“It’s alright.”
"I'm going to try a lot of new things today. If it becomes too much, I want you to snap your fingers. And I mean it, Sherlock. Tell me if it gets to be too much."
The Dom had recovered quickly and realised his sub was in Panic. It was like a flick of a switch and the doctor had no idea what had caused it. Subs in Panic tended to be destructive, not something John was in the mood to witness, and certainly not something either the Dom or sub enjoyed.
The little boy bit his lip and suddenly looked like he was about to cry.
At that, John's attitude changed. "You are seriously asking for more trouble right now?"
Irene frowned, confused internally because she was the youngest of the three, but she correctly guessed it was Mycroft she was talking about. She stepped up to him and slapped him hard, then she shoved him over onto his side and stood over him.
With a great huff, the doctor took off after Sherlock, more than used to it. Fortunately, the detective was running back towards the house. If he had taken off into the night, he would have been impossible to track.
"Thank you, sir," he said, blinking.
“Keep them there,” John ordered.
The idea of splitting it into 4 chunks crossed his mind, but he realised it wasn’t his fault it had gone up to mid-70’s. It was Sherlock’s own doing. He had been given chance after chance. If anything it should probably be higher given the amount of attitude the Dom had been on the receiving end of.
“I was invited.”
Finn was already on his feet and out the door. But John yelled ‘no’ too loudly, concerned the boy was about to charge out onto a busy street. The affects were instantaneous. Finn charged into the bedroom and out of sight.
He could hear John and Irene talking to each other, but he hadn't tuned into what they were saying and he hadn't even noticed the coffees arriving on the table.
They found Sherlock curled up in a chair in the living room of the house. His back was to the room.
"That could have been you," Greg told his sub, reaching forward to pinch one of Mycroft's nipples viciously, "but you had to misbehave just that much."
As if the answer was obvious the cabbie replied, “There’s a good bottle and a bad bottle. You take the pill from the good bottle, you live; take the pill from the bad bottle, you die.”
Sherlock's mouth popped open immediately. The last thing he wanted to do was end up sorting rice again or counting or anything else the two Doms came up with.
"I know. It's brilliant. He probably wants to know what our decision is, Mycroft told him that is what we were discussing.”
John didn't seem to care, in fact, he seemed to find it amusing. "You deserve this, boy," the blond pointed out. "So don't look at me like that."
He didn’t even need to look up to know the man he had collided with was a Dominant. The stance; stiff posture, the fact he’d yelled ‘oi!’ as soon as he had done it and the not backing away. Thinking on it, he should have actually acted the same. It was hard to tell a submissive at first glance unless said submissive was acting overly so. Sherlock's collar was hidden by his scarf so that also hid the truth. The trouble was, he was so used to being around John now and the way the whole Dom/sub dynamic had worked itself out (no doubt through a very clever John's vigorous planning, Mycroft would have also played his part) that he found it hard to fake his way as a Dom anymore. Bit of a downside really, given his job. Where was John?
John examined his arse closely, touching the edges of the strap marks that laid across his sit spot. "Have you got something to say to me?" John asked when he was content there was no lasting damage and he hadn't broken the skin.
The sub waited for John to straighten up before he turned and shuffled from the room on all fours.
"Good." The doctor slid across the seat so he could lift Sherlock's head onto his lap. "Greg, we never said thank you for inviting us along on holiday, so thanks."
"No, pet," John whispered, running his hand through his curls. "This needs to happen, and this needs to happen now."
John pushed him out of the shower and told him to grab a towel.
Mycroft wisely kept his mouth shut.
"Yes, sir," Sherlock agreed. "I'll do anything you want... need to get back to that."
Why did Sherlock sign the contract?
The Dom tilted his head on one side. "Did you?"
Sherlock stood up and walked to the door when John unclipped the leash.
The Dominatrix went pale. "No! Please!"
“Sir-”

Sherlock realised by the following day there was a pattern to the ghost-like things appearing. The timings were identical to the day before, John hadn't seemed to notice, and he planned to keep it that way.
John went back to packing and Sherlock tried to race from the room but he was stopped.
Sherlock screwed his nose up at that. “Yeah right.”
“Very well. I’ll make some tea. I’m not untying you.”
The game continued in that fashion with each of them climbing ladders and sliding down snakes. Now both Sherlock and Finn were close to reaching the end.
Sherlock’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen. On it was a message from his brother. Mycroft and Greg were waiting out in the car.
John tried to vary his hits, each one overlapping as limited as possible but at “18, sir” he was running out of room and he was only half way, just.
Each burglary had been planned, each one had been a practice, and it was clear from the deaths in the third that he was escalating. But was the escalation planned? Or was it contingency... no witnesses?
“You disobeyed me this time by running away. You are going to run to the end of the street and come back.”
“3 more to add to your tally boy! Now hands above your head.”
“Yes, sir,” he whispered, for some reason wanting to cry.
"I'm assuming any chance of leniency is long gone?"
“Yes we are.”
John swore under his breath. Being involved with someone as literal and logical as Sherlock could be trying at times. Hell, it was exhausting.
He really should have tried to sleep himself, but Mycroft felt the need to watch over Sherlock. He knew the thought was absurd, the only thing he could protect his brother from was nightmares, but he would at least do that much and wake him if he appeared to be slipping into one.
“Don’t apologise, pet. You’ve done nothing wrong.” He cupped his boy’s cheek when he didn’t look up of his own accord. He peered down into the grey-green eyes and almost got lost in the way the colours swirled together, but something wasn’t right. “What do you feel like? Can you explain it to me?” It could be Panic, John reasoned. It had been a few days since events had taken a rather dramatic turn for a few hours, but this could almost be an aftershock, which sometimes happened, and could be worse if the sub had been in Panic when the event had happened as well. It was like going into shock and then coming out of it only to return again when you weren’t quite 100% again. That wasn’t it though. It was almost like…
“You know what it is, sir.”
Sherlock hurried across the room and sat down immediately. He doubted John would change his mind and swap the chairs, but he wasn't about to risk it, even if it was slim.
"How many times, sir?" He asked.
“Oh. Yeah.” Finn started to pull his shorts off right there. Sherlock shrugged and did the same.
"Uh uh, open them, pet," Sherlock said, slapping John's cheek lightly. And without further ado, placed his hand at the base of his cock and squeezed.
“Bollocks,” he hissed. He ran back into the flat, straight to the window.
John couldn’t even see his face, he’d curled himself up so tightly.
He glanced at the food he hadn’t eaten that morning. His stomach had been in his throat at the time and the last thing he had wanted to do had been to eat, but now, now he was hungry. He couldn’t bear to eat though, just the thought of eating on his own felt wrong. He hadn’t done it in what felt like forever, he enjoyed kneeling next to his Dom, being fed each mouthful by hand, his Dom’s hand. He felt like he should still hate it like he did three weeks ago, but he couldn’t lie to himself. No way was he going to eat without the doctor. He sniffed and faced the wall again.
“Well, that’s good otherwise you would have lied on your contract about suitable punishments. However, I am sure that throughout the day you will get bored and decide to irritate me, your tally will then come into account. It is already at 11.”
“It was a good run, pet," the blond said, confirming Sherlock's thoughts. "I was beginning to think we would never find you.” And just what would Mycroft have done to him then? Losing his baby brother... Although, now he knew it was Mycroft's fault he ran in the first place, with or without his knowledge or provocation.
John snagged his collar before the detective could take off down the beach again. He then sunk down to the bench, pulling Sherlock down onto his lap. "Babe, if you can manage 15 minutes without annoying me, you may call me by my name, but that means no running away."
“Open your eyes boy!” The Dom barked immediately.
Sherlock had been given breakfast shortly after his trip to the loo, but he hadn't eaten it. If John wasn't going to be there to be proud of him for eating, he wouldn't even touch the food. He could hear the tell tale sign of Donovan being nearby as her high heels clicked up and down the corridor between the cells as she paced, waiting. Had she left custody at all since dumping him back in his cell? He sighed and glanced back at the food on the floor. He didn't need to eat and he certainly wasn't going to do it for her. Instead, he kicked the tray of cold porridge and the plastic cup of water across the room, splattering the mess all over the place. He then picked up the tray and flung it into the wall, watching it shatter with some level of amusement.
Irene nodded, not daring to argue.
That statement was so outrageous that the other three men burst out laughing immediately. John laughed so hard it brought tears to his eyes. He lifted his hand up to the back of the detective's head and ruffled his curls roughly.
"Why do you hold it, sir? We're doing 80, you don't need that."
John grabbed him by the collar of his jacket and pulled him in for a massive hug whilst pressing his lips to the younger man's. “I love you.”
“If you were to get out, boy, anything could happen to you. I have large extensive grounds, you are wearing nothing but a pair of pants and it is the middle of January and you, my little sub, are a long way from home; you could have got hurt or worse.”
“You hungry?” he asked as he leant over and pulled a bottle of water and a straw from the side cupboard.
"No… but I can tickle you." He reached forward and jabbed at his brother's ribs. Sherlock squealed like a girl and took off running in the other direction. Mycroft chased after him, catching him up and tackling him to the sandy beach. He landed on top of him and held him down.
“About two weeks ago there was a little girl, younger than Finn in a situation similar to the one he was in a few months ago.”
The boy blinked dumbly. “Yes, sir. As long as we don’t get wet again.”
“You don’t have to,” John said, suddenly unsure. “I just thought… you can stay in the lab if you want. It’s yours. I just want to make sure you’re eating enough and you’re in bed at night.”
The detective glanced down at his hardening length in confusion. John laughed softly. "Do you like that, pet?"
"You know coadoption is going to be difficult," Sherlock said randomly over Finn's head. He was satisfied the boy would have no idea what they were talking about.
Greg crouched down on his haunches beside him and grabbed his wrists. Then he pulled them upwards, pressing Mycroft more to the floor.
“You two should be very glad I didn’t just put a bullet in the pair of you, with who his brother is and my connections to authority at the Yard I would have even gotten away with it. But for now, think very carefully about what you are going to say to Greg. Because if I don’t like it I will tell him what I want to, I might do that anyway,” John breathed heavily around his anger as he heard his sub on the phone to the DI, telling him exactly what had been ordered. “and be warned, you pathetic shits. The British Government will be involved.”
“You’re getting good at this, pet.” He made sure he spoke with a smile, any nice gesture in Sherlock's direction tended to be appreciated, even if the sub didn’t admit it at the time.
“What do you say?” John asked.
Mycroft released him slowly, ready to grab his brother at the least provocation, but John took Sherlock firmly by the arm and started dusting the sand off of him.
In all honesty, Mycroft realised it would be stupid expecting his brother to escape now, he hadn't last night and they'd had plenty of time.
"Yes, I see, sir." Mycroft grabbed the back of the seat to steady himself. "Sir, would you mind letting go now?"
When he reached the door he saw the female sub still knelt where she was when he'd left.
Behind them people were starting to trickle into the courtroom.
“Yeah.”
“Sherlock, this is Irene Adler, who I told you about, and this is her submissive, Kate.”
"Sherlock, what is your problem? We came out here because we all needed a break and yet you're being as bad, if not worse, than normal."
“Well?” the sub prodded.
Sherlock was used to the dramatics. He thought himself and his brother were bad, but Eurus was on a whole new level when it came to being a drama queen.
Tentative hands unclasped and slowly he reached over for his favourite thing, grinning widely when his hands clasped around it and he could feel it beneath his fingers.
"That's exactly the point. You took his money and had this place built."
Sherlock fumed as the two Doms giggled. For his part, Mycroft started thrashing madly. "Gregory! That's not fair!"
"Actually, go and fetch my handcuffs."
At that, Sherlock flinched. He needed to be good. For Mycroft. He wished he could see his brother better, but the position they had him in made it impossible. All he could do was go still and hope not to anger the two women further.
John took the hint and kept playing with his pet's messy curls.
That.
Sherlock was biting his lip, feeling like he was being examined like fish on the ice stand in a supermarket. He wanted nothing more than to curl up around his leg that he could feel throbbing beneath his trousers.
Sherlock chewed, wondering if it would be worth it just to not tell him. He would tell Mycroft, and the bastard was smug enough.
Sherlock let out a muffled yelp around the gag. He bit down on it in preparation for the next strike. Oh how he wanted the cage off! He wanted to come. He wanted to come with John inside him. The way John was enjoying himself, though, that didn't seem very likely. He felt like he wanted to cry, to sob and make John get on with it, but he knew from experience that it wasn't likely.
The doctor closed his eyes and let his head fall back against the chair. "Not at all."
That made Sherlock moan and begin his struggle anew.
The resulting chaos was short lived, but intense. The judge called an adjournment in order for all parties to calm down.
Mycroft's head kept shaking but as soon as the doctor stepped forward to roughly encourage him, he scrambled across the floor.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock said softly. That seemed a long way off.
“Yes, sir,” he murmured. John’s hand was still on his cheek and he pressed his face into it a bit more.
The doctor stopped moved the fleshlight and let it go. It waved around in the air, drooping a bit. He nuzzled at Greg's hairline, then nipped at his shoulder.
“12, sir. M-May I have another, sir?”
John didn’t answer just waited. When no polite response was forthcoming he went and grabbed a chair from the kitchen and took a seat by the door so he could watch him. He was still breathing heavily.
He pulled his hand out of Mycroft's grip and turned to stare out of the window.
Whilst they waited, Irene passed the time by pinching the head of Sherlock's very limp cock. "You could at least show some interest in the procedings, Sherly. I actually find this performance," she gave his limp cock a squeeze, "rather insulting."
"Get up!" Greg snapped. "Now!"
The sub glared down at the floor trying to decide his next move. He took too long, however, as John soon had him by the curls and was poking a bit of toast at his mouth.
This time, Sherlock couldn't stop his tears as they escaped his eyes. He lifted a hand and dashed them away before anyone could notice.
Too late, Sherlock realised his mistake. He could see the look on John's face and it didn't take much of a deductive leap to know what was about to happen next. He hid his face against Greg's back, knowing he had started to blush. Sherlock quickly found himself thrown over said bench and pinned down by one Dom while the other tied him down.
There was a wary look in the detective's eyes, but the fire wasn't completely gone from them.
“We could put him out of his misery.” The doctor stared at Greg, his face deliberately blank. He didn't want to give away their answer too soon and watched as Greg went back to talking to the girls who had completely disappeared in their hole, sand didn't even come out anymore.
“Is that why they're fun?” Finn kicked his feet absently. “I think it is. Mad is good thing. That's why I'm swimming in my shorts!”
“Kneel,” the Dom growled.
Mycroft let his head fall back against the cross. This was all they needed, their little sister and Eurus becoming best friends, pals, mates. He looked over at his brother, hoping to see Sherlock pulling a Houdini.
Mycroft kept his face carefully blank during all of this. He didn't want to be accused of gloating. Greg had moved around the bed and sat behind him, resting his hand on his boy's hip.
John walked up beside him and held out the cock cage he had gathered up on his way over.
That was the second time he had been called boy in a matter of seconds, an appellation that the Dom hadn’t needed to use for days.
"You know my brother, John."
Sherlock realised there and then why John was so mad with him as to punish him before their first meal together. It wasn’t just because he attempted to run off. He was worried he would have hurt himself. The level of guilt inside Sherlock’s chest increased thrice fold and his shoulders slouched.
John tried hard not to sigh. "I actually like the idea of walking along the shore myself." He didn't say that it was because Sherlock enjoyed it.
“Thank me,” he ordered.
“How’s your wrist feeling?” the Dom asked, deciding to change the subject for the both of them. Now that he knew his pet wanted to stay and it wasn’t just Panic talking last night, he felt more comfortable in manoeuvring him about. He lifted his wrist up to examine it and slowly unwrapped the bandage that he had secured around it last night. It wasn’t as swollen as it could have been and John kissed it softly, checking the trails of different colour bruising. He reached for the drawer and pulled out a fresh bandage and gently began wrapping it up again. Sherlock winced and the doctor immediately froze.
John sighed, Sherlock would hate him for this. “Coming without permission.”
“But-”
It was a further three days before John kept his promise to deal with the tally. It wasn't as high as the Dom had been expecting.
“Do you want to safe word out? Either your normal or your contract?”
As soon as Finn was dressed he took off towards the sea, John caught him by the hand, “No, Finn. You know the rules.”
"Sherlock. You need to stay away from that man." Mycroft sounded distressed. "Please."
“That is your name…” John trailed off. He had used it the night before, but he apparently didn’t recall. Given the circumstances, John wasn’t surprised.
Sherlock was sat at one of the desks in John's study. He had the leash clipped to his neck that slipped around the doctor's wrist so he couldn't go anywhere, even if he wanted to.
"Mycroft?" Greg prompted, glaring at his sub. "Anything else you would like to add?"
The youngest Holmes stood, her hands held out before her, her fingers like claws. "Irene," she hissed, "don't let me kill him."
John reached down to his rucksack and pulled out a bottle of water.
Huffing, Sherlock headed to the hallway, he had been happily playing on his violin while he waited for the experiment to bubble over, before the interruption.
Siger laughed, then sat down on the sofa. He was proud of his youngest son for so many reasons, not the least of which was the way he interacted with Finn.
Greg fetched the rope and handed it to John. It was dark blue and would bring out the colour in Sherlock's eyes.
The doctor was far from being upset. His cock had stiffened in his jeans and he was getting more turned on by the moment. He was sure, however, as soon as Greg realised that he would begin struggling again, no doubt getting off on it himself. For that reason, he pushed the sub a little towards his knees, hoping Greg wouldn't notice for a bit longer. He grabbed Greg's cuffed wrists and pushed them up his back, twisting his arms passed uncomfortable.
It suddenly occurred to him that he was alone but not, in the sense that the box was talking to him. Did it talk to everyone? He got blasted by cold air. "You read my mind?"
John reminds Sherlock why he’s with him.
He heard John yell his name a few times as he paced up and down the hallway outside before it faded, where he must have gone downstairs. He didn’t know whether he was deliberately angering him or not, but he didn’t think so… all he felt now was guilt so he climbed in the wardrobe and pulled the door shut behind him. Darkness was safe, darkness was normal after what he had done today. He could feel Panic coming in, settling into him like a low fog. He wanted John; needed John. But he couldn’t move. Another hour ticked by and he buried himself in the closet further.
"I'm not complaining, sir."
Sighing, the detective twisted the case about slightly and sprung up the stairs. He flew into the flat to find his brother sat in his favourite chair.
“What have you deduced then, Sherlock?”
The Dom walked away and Sherlock bit his lip, he hoped the Dom at least told Mycroft to leave before the strap was put to use.
Sherlock's head snapped up at that and his eyes went wide. The doctor cupped his cheek immediately, not liking the look he was receiving. “Hey, hey, Sherlock,” he snapped his fingers in front of him and with no response but a dopey blink, whispered, “bollocks.”
Sherlock’s mouth formed a thin line. He hated to have to chide the boy, but he was going to have to go after him.
Sherlock laughed and dropped down to the floor. There was a choice between reading here, on the floor or walking what felt like miles to the kitchen or the study that he wasn’t allowed in. clear winner. He swivelled around on his stomach and laid the files out in front of him, managing to take up the majority of the room.
Greg began to nibble on the head of his cock until Mycroft couldn't help but buck into his Dom's waiting mouth.
Sherlock nodded. "I'm more than alright, this is the best weekend so far in Sherrinford."
"She kills people, little sister," Mycroft said in a flat tone. "She calls it experiments when she does it, but Eurus does it just for fun."
“Mrs. Hudson, would you like me to walk you home?”
"Alright." John yawned, then closed his eyes.
“What was your fault?”
Sherlock nodded, looking to his Dom.
Ben’s hand was back in his hair as he snapped his head back, leaving his throat and chin open to anyone’s mercy – especially two psycho power heavy Doms.
Sherlock was incredibly quiet in the car, so much so that John slid across the soft leather of the seat and rested his hand on the younger man’s knee.
"So are clothes."
Irene unfastened Sherlock's gag and handed it to Eurus. "Is something wrong, Sherly?" She stroked under his left eye with her thumb. "I suppose we were a bit neglectful."
“It might shoot up in the sky and get broken by aliens,” Finn argued.
The doctor shook his head, thinking on how well Sherlock had responded to being here since his arrival a few weeks back. The stern, but fair approach didn't seem to be doing his sub any harm.
"You, pretty boy, are being a naughty little brat, the Superintendent told him with a smile.
"I want you to quit bloody teasing me! I either want a fucking orgasm or the walk on the beach you promised me."
"My staff. You aren't nervous around them. Why not?"
John was gone a few seconds and had him in his sight the whole time so there was no way he was going to be stupid enough to attempt the door again. He looked drained of energy if nothing else.
“You took my phone!” he snapped, albeit more quietly than he would have done if they were at home.
"Be still, Holmes!" John barked, his tone sharp. There was nothing for it, the doctor let the crop fly several times in a row until Sherlock was making heavy breathing sounds around his gag. "Have you had enough, boy?" John asked, panting.
“Talking from experience, Mycroft?” John asked loftily.
"In," John ordered.
"Yes, sir. It was hard. But I understand." Sherlock really didn't but he wasn't after a discussion or a debate on semantics.
John ran his hand along Sherlock's back, not pinching or scratching, just rubbing smoothly along his spine. He watched his boy closely for further signs of rebelliousness, but for now he seemed to be calming down.
"Yes," the detective managed. He peeled his hand away from John's almost as if it hurt him physically to do so.
That made Sherlock return the smile briefly as John buckled the ball gag into his mouth. “Duck your head.”
“You did. You could have behaved the first time and then you wouldn’t be stuck like that. That is what I said about submissives sometimes being the strongest. You going along and behaving makes me happy, in turn it’ll make you happy. Doing what you are told as a submissive makes you stronger than you think. There’s a lot of trust involved in relationships, boy, and therefore relationships are built on trust. From what you’ve already said so far you’ve had no reason to stick around, trust will change that. But it’s a two way thing. So what are you going to do the next time I order you to stay somewhere?”
"I know what it means, Sherlock. What's your point?"
Mycroft chuckled at that and returned his gaze to his Dom's face. "And there's no tie to drag me around with, sir."
"No, sir," Mycroft answered instantly. "I'm sorry, sir."
The detective nodded again and this time spread his legs, groaning at the strain and pressure.
The detective shrugged and turned his face towards his brother's neck. "That doesn't matter."
“Put your knife to his neck,” Mycroft decided.
John didn't even bother asking Sherlock what he wanted, he ordered for the 4 of them and made Greg pay.
Siger did, he’d turned away to wipe tears from his eyes.
Greg ran his hand down over his sub's neck, a silent well done.
He pressed the button, noting the Superintendent's number.
Conclusion; he definitely liked John.
Sherlock tried to pull away but John wouldn't let him.
He yelled out, “SHERLOCK!”
Part of Mycroft wanted Irene to wind his sister up.
Sherlock didn't answer, he hadn't been given permission.
Sherlock heard him sit down, shortly followed by the scratching of a pencil.
Mycroft averted his eyes, it wasn't like he could speak to defend himself.
If anyone saw him he was just another science geek, he snorted at that and searched for the nearest silver figure. They're was one in the supply closet.
"Mm hm." John grabbed his pet's curls and dragged him from the room.
Irene licked her firey red lips. "It will keep his mind where I want it and make it harder to ignore the other things I do to him. Besides," She turned to keep it hidden from Sherlock whilst showing it to Eurus, "extra weight can be added to it if he's a bad boy."
"His glare would get through solid steel," Greg laughed.
Irene smiled. "Why?"
He’d managed to hold his tongue the evening of his last attempted escape. He’d taken his punishment with the paddle as part of the tally when it came around to it, but he was glad he had attempted it, just pissed off he hadn’t been successful.
Sherlock stepped out of 221 and closed the door behind him. “I didn’t order a taxi.”
The doctor laughed. "Don't lie to me, Gregory."
“Don’t think of disobeying me, boy. You should already have done this,” John’s voice was calm, but it didn’t have the same effect on the detective.
Sherlock kept as still as possible, letting her carry on.
"It's all the same thing, brother mine."
When John entered the apartment, Sherlock was knelt perfectly in the middle of the living room.
"Sir, you're killing me."
“The sexual aspect of the contract has been rather lacking due to certain disastrous situations, you cannot leave my custody until we’ve done everything that should be done on a training contract. Another reason why I think extra time will be required.”
"Yes, sir," Sherlock said for the third time.
“Rita?” He paused on sight of the receptionist.

The youngest Holmes shrugged. "I don't know. Don't people pay you for this sort of thing?"
The government official enjoyed his coffee. When he finished it, he set it on the side. He stood and stretched, then headed towards the bathroom to join his Dom.
He judged the idea as stupid when he overheard the men talking. Storage room 8. It would be safer to meet it there than follow it in its entirety.
“Lets just say there is no hot water left.”
"Shut it, Sherlock," John ordered. "As long as that cock of yours stays hard, I won't believe your complaints."
When John turned around again, Sherlock lifted his hands and put them at his neck, in his boy position. He wasn't going to mess up like that, John would end up punishing him for sure.
"If I was hurt, would you react in the same way?" Eurus asked.
"Sir?"
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock agreed. To be honest, he would have agreed to anything if it meant his Dom no longer being angry with him.
"I'm sorry?"
Eurus held out her hand for the device. She didn't recall obtaining it, but she had just ordered whatever she had seen on the TV. The device was heavy and she liked the idea of Irene putting it on Sherlock. Handing it back to the Dominatrix, she skipped over to her brother. "I can't wait to see it on you, little big brother."
When they reached the water, they walked in until the waves broke around their ankles.
"Now!" She barked, her no nonsense Dominatrix tone was back.
The detective growled. "Fine, but I'm not throwing out the toes. I still need them."
Irene glanced between them. "This is old territory."
The doctor almost exploded instantly, but through sheer will alone managed to control himself. Sherlock gave him a knowing smirk.
He found himself being ordered to his knees, his hands behind his head. He obeyed without a word… he was still trying to work or what that man's game had been. Who he was and why he had appeared out of nowhere? And what did he wanted with him.
John hesitated, then set up the video feed to Sherlock's room.
Sherlock didn't say anything, just looked out the window. The doctor shifted across the seats to sit in the middle where his sub usually sat.
John laughed. "Quite right."
Happy comments make for quicker chapters!
“Wh- what?”
"Oh, he's quite good," Greg said, proudly. "I'll let you borrow him for that if you like."
"Good boy," Greg whispered.
The detective looked up at the ceiling and the 'vines' that hung there. He quickly deduced that they were functional, not merely for decoration. "Suspension gear," Sherlock said to his brother who hadn't looked up yet.
"Don't thank me yet."
After a further ten minutes, he lowered protesting shoulders down to see what the click had done. Some mechanism had released extra chain so he could pull it out further. He had no idea what time it was, but he could guess it was late. Realising John obviously wasn’t going to come and get him, Sherlock curled up on the floor, glad the Dom had at least left him his clothes, even if it was only a shirt and a pair of trousers. He drifted off into what promised to be a fretful sleep.
“I should be able to come when I want to.”
“The more you fight this now, the worse it will be for you. That rope will keep getting tighter as will the weights. Behave, calm down and I will let you down. At which point I will deliver your considerable tally, you will apologise to me, and we will go and have a nice conversation with your brother who will no doubt be in a foul mood after waiting for his petulant brat of a baby brother to get his head on straight. For several hours I might add.”
The detective didn't care what Irene said, he wouldn't ask. He knew there'd be consequences. There were consequences anyway.
For every 3 mouthfuls he gave Sherlock, he fed himself once. He wasn’t overly hungry as he’d snacked when he prepared the rest, but it was also Sherlock with the terrible diet, not himself.
“No. I’m sorry, sir. Just, can you untie me? I need the loo.”
“I’m coming to you now. I’ll be about an hour.”
"You can shut up!" Irene hissed.
Sherlock's focus was not on John's fingers. It was on the thing thrusting in and out of him relentlessly and it was obvious.
The detective made a sound of protest when his Dom's fingers left his hole. He knew what was coming next and wasn't looking forward to it.
"Well... yeah. They're rather pitiful."
“I have large grounds. You’ve only been out there during your little mission impossible routines.”
Sherlock stared at him, unsure quite what this older man was up to. After a moment, he straightened up and started to walk around the front of the cab, clearly intending to get in it.
Over the speakers came a distinctive sound, one that was identical to a ringtone on Sherlock's phone: Irene Adler's ringtone.
Sherlock dropped his head in frustration, that soon changed to submission.
John groaned, dumped his beer on the unit and rolled to his feet. He walked the few paces to his sub and toed his cock. "What was that, boy?"
Greg grinned. "I think it's nice. It's about time he loosened up and joined the rest if the world."
“She'll be dealt with, mate, that I promise you.”
Sherlock’s head jerked from side to side in what looked like a painful motion. “No, sir. Please… please don’t make me go. I like it here, sir. I like it with you.”
"Finn, it's time for us to go," John said quietly, crossing over where the boy and Sherlock sat. He picked Finn up effortlessly, then dropped a kiss on Sherlock’s temple. "We'll be waiting on you."
Finn yawned and stretched, then he abruptly noticed everyone was looking at him. "What did I do?" he asked, voice tiny.
He dropped back to the floor again, being careful not to drop his hot chocolate.
"Mmph!" the detective objected.
“Sorry, pet.”
Sherlock glanced at it and looked away immediately.
The Superintendent casually reached over and grasped Mycroft's cock, giving it a squeeze. "I plan on making use of that later."
As if it had been planned, Sherlock let out a stream of loud, but muffled sounds. The doctor rolled his eyes and released Greg. "It's my sub that's the problem."
The doctor laughed as he covered Finn with the towel to let him change his shorts. “Cover yourself, you git. You're going to give Mrs. H a heart attack,” John told his husband.
Mycroft still couldn't take his eyes off his brother, even as Greg made John check his work.
“Do you fancy a picnic?”
"Gregory, sir," the government official whinged, "please." He wriggled and writhed trying to get the other man to pay attention to his other nipple.
"You calming down changes nothing. You're still in trouble."
“How do you know that?” John couldn’t help himself. He loved the intelligence of the younger man.
He didn't know where he was going to start but he knew the signal he found was high up so headed for the lift.
Sherlock tried his hardest not to move, despite the ache in his arms and the touch of his sister.
But it seemed to be the wrong thing to do, as Finn’s eyes widened in horror and he took off towards the toilets leaving the bowl on the side.
"What was that?"
“Speak up, boy! You know how this works.”
Eurus sipped her wine. "You are a fool."
“Mycroft made me.”
“I saw him at yours back when Wilkes was around and earlier today. A few weeks ago I saw how he was around you. It was different, to say the least, there was an almost instant appearance of respect between the two of you. And the following morning… he was… well, not very Sherlocky.”
"I'm hardly old enough to be your daddy, Lestrade." The detective got a three and moved his counter, huffing at falling behind already.
The detective simply rolled his eyes at the absurdity.
Eurus uncuffed him and did them up in front like Sherlock's.
“Her coat. It’s slightly damp. She’s been in heavy rain in the last few hours. No rain anywhere in London in that time. Under her coat collar is damp, too. She’s turned it up against the wind.” He demonstrated with his own collar and John smirked, that wasn’t why his boy put his collar up. “She’s got an umbrella in her left hand pocket but it’s dry and unused. Not just the wind, but strong wind, too strong for her to use her umbrella. We know from her suitcase that she must have come a decent distance but she can’t have travelled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn’t dried. So, where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within in the radius of that travel time?” he pulled his phone from his pocket again and scrolled through it for a few moments. He stopped on the page he had glanced at earlier and showed it to the two Doms, both of which were looking mildly vacant.
“You will open your mouth right now boy or I am going to double your tally.”
“Hey,” Sherlock was on his feet and beside him immediately. Not caring about the expensive clothes he wore, he picked Finn up and started towards the bathroom. "No need for tears. It was an accident and accidents happen."
As they pulled up at the front of the manor, John noticed Sherlock's eyes were squeezed shut where his head pressed against the window. Rather than ask again what was wrong to get a rubbish answer, John clambered out the car where George had opened the door for him and raced around the boot. He opened the door, making sure to catch Sherlock when he inevitably fell out.
John nodded once and followed Greg up the sand. “What is it?
How did he know? Sherlock was silently fuming. This blasted Dom was too good, not like he would ever admit it to the other man. All the same his hands shot back up behind his head, but John didn’t immediately turn around. He finished filling the sink up, rubbing a flannel with soap, then spun on his heel with a big grin on his face.
Every couple of minutes John moved forward and told him he was doing something wrong, or helped shift or swap over each curtain. Sherlock was quickly fed up, but he knew it could have been a lot worse... he knew John would never harm him, not like those before, but he still could have got the paddle out. And that soap had tasted awful. He chewed down on the ball gag in his mouth, glad for the first time it was there.
"As my brother so eloquently put it, piss off."
“Ah, Sherlock good to see you again,” the man at the door said in greeting after he had spoken to John.
"Yes, sir. Although, technically it is Mycroft's fault."
"In fact, lets go and get hot chocolate and sit in front of the fire." John didn't give the sub a chance to say no. Instead, he took him by the hand and dragged him to the kitchen where the doctor made them both the hot chocolates he had promised.
"Right," John said critically. "It doesn't have anything to do with the mess of an experiment I found on the kitchen table?"
Slowly, Sherlock lowered himself over the horse.
“Could my pet have a glass of water please, Mrs. Hudson?”
"Is he breathing?" Eurus asked.
“Sherlock,” the older sub tried a different approach. “You moved in with me because I couldn’t trust you.”
"Can't I? I like to think I saved my little brother by putting him in rehab, but I'm only kidding myself. I thought maybe you saved him, letting him tag along at the Yard. But I'm naïve. John is what saved my little brother."
Irene thought about it for a moment and then walked towards Mycroft instead. “It's best not to.”
“No!” Finn whacked the floor with his hands.
“40,” the Dom said simply. He pulled his sub to his feet and push him towards his cases. “Kneel.”
“But I don’t want to-”
John made a point to rest his hand at the small of Mycroft's back, in Sherlock's view. "Shame your brother is so well behaved, Sherlock."
“When this is done, you’ll come crawling back, won’t you, brat? I don’t know if I’ll have you. You’ll have to get down on your knees on my doorstep and beg me. Things have changed since being a teenager, slut.”
John shut the detective up by wedging the end of a sausage into Sherlock's mouth. "Be quiet and eat that."
It pleased Mycroft to no end that Finn did that with such careless abandon. The little boy was probably the only person besides his parents and the people in this room who didn't see him as the Ice Man. Finn just thought of him as his uncle. He didn't know that 'other man' and Mycroft vowed that he never would.
Sherlock just looked confused and John realised that this conversation couldn’t have been going very well with all these different reactions from the younger man.
Sherlock smirked, his mouth curling up, “Are you deducing, sir?”
Greg cleared his throat. “Breakfast was excellent. Thank you both for cooking.” He searched for something to say to defuse the situation, but came up blank. He caught Mycroft’s eye, hoping he would come up with something.
Fear seemed to get the better of her because Irene stepped forward and removed the cuffs from both of them. "How did you do that?"
"Then that's what we do," John told him with a smile. "We're not idiots. We can do this. Together."
"Then carry on."
"Eurus understands nothing of the sort. She's stuck in her own little bubble and anything that doesn't conform gets destroyed or hurt."
"But I lied, sir," Sherlock whispered, glaring at his brother again after swallowing the pain killers.
The little boy had had enough of that. He ran into the living room and climbed into the government official's lap. "Uncle Myc. You're s'pose to play with me now."
"Nope." John was rummaging through their toys again. He came up with a tube of lube. "I think I'll entertain myself for a while by playing with him."
“Whose fault is it then?”
Reluctantly, both ‘boys’ returned and took a seat at the table with John.
John waved the strap through the air a few times, getting a feel for it again and practicing where he was going to hit, it was too serious a spanking to just hit him anywhere, especially as he was sure the brat would force him to do this again, he needed to be efficient to leave room.
"Sir, I apologise, I was…" he didn't know what to say, he had been expecting to be cut off. "I'm sorry, sir."
It had been what John had requested but he knew Sherlock was going to complain about not getting tea. His complaints wouldn't be heard and he wouldn't be going anywhere with his arms still trussed up behind him.
“Don’t like sprouts,” Finn said shaking his head.
John had had enough, he leant over and whispered low in his ear, "Outside. Now."
“I am,” the Dom agreed.
He picked up a Wartenberg pinwheel and kept looking. Moving a crop aside, his fingers brushed a flogger. Greg grinned, dropped the pinwheel and picked up two floggers, one for himself and one for John.
Greg flicked the switch and the dildo started pounding into Sherlock's hole again, much to his dismay.
“He hasn’t been in touch,” Sherlock offered quietly, looking away, but not stepping away from the firm grip on his shoulder. Greg had such a natural dominance about him that Sherlock felt himself drifting towards subspace. Something he couldn’t let happen, but didn’t know how to stop. He brought his head up and met the Dom’s eyes for the first time since he had arrived.
“It really doesn’t-” John cut the DI off with a raised finger.
"It means John's not needed," Sherlock said without thinking.
"You're a copper."
“Oh, so it was all just a coincidence?” John asked, a mischievous grin on his face.
Sherlock swallowed audibly. “And it worked. I did it. I’m cleverer than my brother.”
John had Sherlock’s neck taught with the way he had his head pulled back. “Well?”
Without muttering a word, John untied the leash from the floor and tugged. Sherlock stumbled to his feet with the jerk at his neck, but he resolutely wouldn’t move and folded his arms in a clear not happening gesture.
"I ate all the chips you gave me."
After a moment's clear deliberation and thought, Sherlock ducked his head slightly. "Yes, sir." He would just have to face the music at the moment, he didn't want to leave after all.
"I don't feel like you do."
“It’s not a friend, sir.”
He had rolled over and was looking up at his Dom from his lap with a raised eyebrow.
He thought about Irene and the needle she had jabbed into him. He sincerely hoped she wasn't planning on doing something like that to them. He didn't want to lose control like that around her.
John’s hand snaked over Finn's head and ruffled Sherlock's hair.
"Look." Sherlock jerked his head at the silver figure that was in front of 221.
“Difference between what? How I punished your previous experiences?’
Sherlock glared.
"Boy," John growled, dropping his fork and snagging Sherlock's leash. "We're done here," the Dom decided on the spot, choosing to drag Sherlock to the stairs.
Sherlock had already been on them, so he knee walked to his brother's side.
The Dom sighed, reached up to Sherlock’s height and grabbed his hair. The sub still fought, so John let his curls slide through his fingers and gripped his ear. The younger man yelped.
“Really?” that surprised the detective’s Dom even more.
Mycroft shot his brother a look that Sherlock immediately understood: Irene was a fool, despite her intelligence.
The government official struggled to stay upright as he was practically dropped.
He wasn’t surprised when a plug slipped into his hole with ease. The presence of it already seemed to calm him.
Sherlock sighed in defeat. “You, sir.”
Of course it was Sherlock who answered, John just feeling rather redundant beside him. “Yeah. Everything all right?”
"Ow! You bastard!"
"Look how excited he is, John." Greg pointed to a spot on the floor next to Sherlock. "Come over here by your brother."
"How," John asked as he approached the other couple, "can he be more of a problem when he's obedient than when he's a trouble maker?"
“No. Go away.”
“I’m not suggesting you have been treating my brother unfairly, John, forgive me if that is the way it came across. I trusted you enough to pressurise him into signing a contract with you. I merely asked because he probably thought was fairly mild in comparison to what he has been through before.”
Sherlock took several long, deep, shaky breaths into the government official's shoulder. “Mycroft, the murder-”
John then wrapped some hemp rope in a figure of 8 around the detective’s cock and bollocks and let the loose ends hang. He weighted the rope and the clamps, then pushed them both so they would sway. With the stimulation in his arse, the rope immediately did its job.
The younger man wanted to complain but couldn’t. He just grumbled behind the gag as he picked up the iron. John made a point to stand beside him, arms folded, watching his every move.
"Let's play a game with his cock," Greg suggested fetching some rope, "I'm bored of his bollocks being pain free."
Sherlock had expected to be forced to eat breakfast. He had been expecting to be dragged downwards not upwards so he was in slight shock when the Dom forced him to his knees outside the playroom door.
"Do what you did before," Eurus demanded. "Make Mycie act out." She shoved Irene between herself and her brother.
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest, but John pushed a finger inside to cut him off, smiling when the sub automatically began sucking like it was the only thing he had ever had. “Let me finish, pet. You’ll spend the next few days in bed or in the lab or in the study with me, OK? You can also have your clothes back, but I still want you to sleep naked.”
Sherlock was trying his hardest not to get annoyed with both Doms complete obliviousness. With a deep breath and pointedly not looking at the DI he turned back to the body, pointing. “Back of the right leg, tiny splash marks on the heel and calf, not present on the left. She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand. Don’t get that splash pattern any other way. Smallish case, going by the spread. Case that size, woman this clothes conscious, it can only be an overnight bag.” He squatted down again and examined the back of the women’s legs again, trying to process any alternative, he couldn’t find one. Sure, he stood back up again. “Now, where is it? What have you done with it?”
“No, boy, do not argue with me. You will do as you are told.”

“I asked him once. He said that was how it was supposed to work. I had never had a Dom before. I had no data to go on. I never really stayed with another Dom to get used to it again.”
He held his wrists out with a lot less caution than John expected. The doctor detached the cuffs from one another and the sub smiled. “Thank you, sir.”
“Do you remember a few weeks ago when you tried getting out of my house and ended up stuck in the press up position?” he asked as he paced towards him.
John watched his sub for a while and then sighed. He wasn't going to just take the Dom's word for it apparently. He looked like all subs did when they needed to be punished for something.
The barrister tried to calm him down to no avail.
John tied the leash around the table leg, that action alone made Sherlock duck his head again.
“Of course, Doctor Watson.” With a nod the car drove around the side of the mansion, towards the garages.
Sherlock just shrugged.
"Do you think anything in the last hour given me reason to believe what you've just said?"
John smiled, lifted Sherlock and stepped out of the hot tub. Sherlock turned into the doctor, asleep in moments.
Grabbing him by the curls, John shook his boy's head. "You are unfucking believable. You stood there, disobeying me whilst saying you would behave. Where's the sense in that?" He threw his boy sideways to the floor.
“No, sir.”
At that, Finn jumped off the stool and ran to John. "But I need you!" he said, arms outstretched and demanding to be picked up.
"One of the silver things." Sherlock craned his neck to look into the flat around his landlady.
"By 'a nice man', you can't mean Jim," Irene mused. "So who do you mean?"
"Brat," he muttered fondly.
Sherlock kept fighting until his Dom turned and smacked him on the arse three times, hard. "The longer you take to settle, the longer that stays inside you." John rolled his eyes when Sherlock stilled, but immediately began fighting again when he had turned himself around once more.
“You are the most wonderful yet confusing creature that I have ever met.”
“She's a bitch.”
“You ready yet, Mr Holmes? Ready to play?”
That wasn’t part of his job that he had told the detective, but he was sure he’d worked it out just by the way his pen scratched over the surface of paper or card.
John shot Greg a glance, unsure what had caused the sudden attitude from his sub.
"You're joking? You're only a dog when you're with him!" He thrusted his thumb in Greg's direction.
“Am I, sir?”
“You may get the opportunity to earn it back tomorrow.”
"Yeah, you little shit, I thought so."
"Hush, Lock." Mycroft said, hugging him. He looked over his brother's shoulder and met John's eye. The doctor looked almost as upset as Sherlock did. "He doesn't hate you," he rocked him and kissed the top of his head.
Amy had climbed into Mycroft’s lap as had Finn. Beth was quite content on Greg’s.
Sherlock hadn’t said a word as he was dragged out of the Diogenes, the cuffs digging into his wrists as the Dom pulled him along by the scruff of the neck. It was far more uncomfortable than he thought possible, as his shirt caught on his collar and John dragged him at his own, shorter height.
“Lift your head up then.”
That was different, John noted, him being nervous. It wasn’t something he would have associated with the boy.
John did much the same and snatched the keys from the beefy man’s hands. He used his gun to shift the two arseholes back and out of the way. He quickly set about releasing Sherlock with half his attention on the other two Doms.
“What? Yeah. It’s weird seeing my brother like that.”
"You're looking bored too, little big brother."
"What? No. I..."
"Okay, pet, you can come out of the corner now," Greg said with humour in his voice.
Eurus wrapped her arms around her and pulled her in for a hug. Out of Eurus' sight, Irene glared at the kneeling detective.
With the simple command, John moved to shut the door and lock it in case Sherlock decided to make a run for it again.
“What number, sir?”
Greg shook his head. "It certainly doesn't look like the old cold war they used to fight." He raised his voice, "Boys, over here!"
The sub was trying to work out why he hadn’t been punished yet. Was it his begging? Pleading? Neither of those things had helped before, but maybe this Dom was different.
"Yes, sir," he repeated, doing just that. Greg knew instantly what the phone call was for and he couldn't believe they'd cornered their man in less than an hour.
"Couples argue," John pointed out. "Normal couples, I mean."
“Take me to my submissive,” he said eventually. It's all he could think of doing. He just needed to check on Sherlock, even though the sod had run off. Again.
Sherlock didn’t need telling twice. He took a mouthful and spat it out, then proceeded to down the whole glass. “Th-thank you, sir,” he didn’t know if speaking would be the right thing to do.
Everything was going so well, but this is Sherlock, it can't stay that way, right?
Greg knelt, stunned, trying to figure out if John was being literal or just referring to following normal orders. He'd have to ask Sherlock to deduce it.
Greg pulled Sherlock into an embrace, rocking him back and forth. "You're trying too hard," he said into his young friend's ear.
Irene's face burned bright red. She stalked over to one of the guards who was holding a riding crop and ripped it from his grasp. "No one makes a fool of me."
“Boy! Are there any of your clothes remaining in your room?”
Mycroft appeared with the posture collar and a cock cage. John had to stifle a laugh. The elder Holmes brother certainly knew Sherlock quite well.
“It's got to come out somehow, sir.”
"No, sir."
“6 months,” Greg said.
With a small nod, he brought aching arms over his head and crawled as quick as he could to where John had indicated. He put his hands at his neck as John settled in the chair beside him.
John paused, waiting to see if Sherlock was going to say anything else, but when the boy merely shifted to get more comfortable he realised that wasn't about to happen.
Something inside him knew that was more to do with the fact he wanted to protect Sherlock than it had been to protect himself. When did Mycroft ever do anything to protect himself?
“What am I going to do with you, eh pet?”
"That's not going to happen. Mycroft has seen to that." The detective didn't even sound annoyed at his brother's interference.
“Yes, sir.”
"Alright." Greg couldn’t help but reflect on how much Sherlock had changed from the sharp tongued youth he had first met. It was a change for the better.
Johns head tilted on one side as he regarded his sub. That was not the answer he had been expecting. It was better. That must have shown some underlying trust beginning to build.
His head dropped in defeat. “Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.”
With a small smirk, he walked in like he owned the place, and held his brother's ID to the security disk by the first door. His smirk grew larger when the door opened, giving him entrance. It was all he could do not to give a first pump. What did his brother's ID not do? It was incredible.
The government official’s mouth opened to complain again.
The government official was quite clearly asleep again. John smirked. "He was like this when I left him earlier."
“Make him kneel.”
The kneeling men blinked at the light, looking around.
Sherlock, who'd already sipped his, spat it across the room when he couldn't control his laughter.

John made a point of cuffing his hands in front of him then moved across the room to turn the light out and get ready for bed himself.
"I'm not hard." Greg folded his arms. "Try again."
The detective shot his brother a look when the women weren't looking. In that brief moment of connection, he was able to reassure his brother that his subservience was for show.
"Hi." The little boy felt more confident in Sherlock’s arms. He looked at the two girls with curiosity. They didn't seem very scary. He wiggled, wanting down.
John laughed, surprised his boy remembered their first attempt. He had been far too floaty to properly pay attention.
John’s anger and adrenaline fuelled his leg to be more cooperative without his cane as he dragged the petulant younger man up the stairs; his grip meant that Sherlock would only hurt himself if he fought and he found that out pretty quickly.
"What? Oh, sorry, I meant 'sir'." He let John lead him out to the double doors that opened onto the beach, well on the side of the house facing the beach. A matter of seconds later, Mycroft and Greg joined them.
He hadn't really been expecting a response.
“Shall we?” John offered, holding out his hand.
It reminded Sherlock of that day all those years ago when he had first come to Sherrinford. When he had smashed up that coffin after putting Molly through hell.
John’s smile was reassuring, soft and gentle. Formal punishment like this was likely unusual for the sub, he wanted him to get used to it. “Come here and kneel there.” He pointed to part of the stool. A section at the bottom had slid out like a tray and had padding built into it.
After 10 minutes, Finn began to fidget, kicking his legs out. After 15 minutes, Sherlock began to fidget, doing much the same.
“I don’t know, sir.” He moaned as the plug was placed at his entrance and eased in.
“It is not down to you to control your little brother any more, Mycroft. I have contracted with him, it's down to me. I have 7 weeks left, he'll learn.”
"I've told you before to call me Siger."
"I know exactly what you are thinking, Sherlock," he yanked his arm up his back. "And you are so far from the truth it's almost laughable."
“Good boy.” John praised him yet again.
“I do get to tie you up when I feel like it, I’m your Dom. But none of this is without your consent, you know that so there is no reason why you can play that card with me.”
John set his face into a determined look. He picked up his boyfriend and carried him from the house. "We're getting ice cream with a flake and as many sprinkles as it can hold. And you know why? Because I love you."
Sherlock leant forward and snagged a piece of toast from the tray and then realised what he had done and glanced nervously at the doctor. “It’s alright, pet. I’m glad you’re hungry.” He smiled before devouring not just one piece of toast but three and an apple.
The little boy's bottom lip popped out. "I don't wanna sit there. It's boring."
He started to take a bite out of one, but John slapped it out of his hand. "Greg! What are you about, telling him that?! You know how he is!"
"I want an apology first," John said, stepping back and still holding the gag. "I want you to apologise to me for your attitude and your childish behaviour and then you are going to beg me to gag you."
“Up you get then, pet,” John ordered, groaning as he pushed himself to his feet.
The sub froze. The paddle was something he would definitely prefer to avoid. "Only if you want me to want it, sir."
"You know why."
John squeezed his eyes shut but wasn't stupid enough to stop himself swallowing Sherlock properly as he came. Sherlock's hot come hit the back of his throat and John actually sighed at the familiar taste.
"Down, sir. Please."
"Now what?" Mycroft asked. For once, he couldn't work out what the hell was going on with his little brother and at he moment, he didn't really care.
“Any explanation you’d like to offer, Mycroft?”
“Wasn't hurting Daddy,” Finn pointed out happily in Siger's arms.
They worked together until Sherlock had been tied from feet to the tops of his arms. The ropes kept him from moving, unless he wanted to thrash in an undignified fashion like a fish.
Sherlock laughed again. "I could do that if you wanted me to, sir."
All John could think was that he needed to get his boy somewhere and restrained relatively confined so he couldn’t get either of them hurt with his anger.
John laughed, “I’ve been a doctor for many years, boy. By your expression when I first came in and the way you are holding yourself now. You are desperate. So I think if you don’t want to humiliate yourself even more than you already are by acting like a child, you should swallow your pride and obey me.”
Greg closed his eyes and continued running his hand through Sherlock's curls, his response shouldn't have been as surprising as it was. He thought about what John had said when he'd found the shoes the night before, but maybe the younger Dom was wrong, maybe being near the boy was the way through this, rather than giving him time to think on his own while he looked for a solution that was probably illegal. Right now, Sherlock needed the emotional support only his Dom could give him more than escaping custody. He sighed and settled beside the boy for as long as it took, then he'd make sure he got hold of John. It wasn't often his friend was wrong, but maybe no instructions from Mycroft in this situation was rather unhelpful.
“Sherlock, my beautiful boy, look at me.”
“Bloody baby brother,” Mycroft growled, his Dom snagged his collar before he could storm from the room. “Kneel, Mycroft.”
It took a very long time for the sobs to stop wracking through the younger man’s body, so long that John was sure he couldn’t cry any more if he tried.
"That's what you want, is it? Hmm?"
She just smirked. "You are nothing but a brat."
Sherlock didn't even move when John pressed the plug into his loose hole. He was used to it by now, as irritating as it was.
With a smirk at Finn, he climbed into the bath behind him.
John barked a laugh at that, much louder than he intended, and the sleeping detective woke with a start.
"Why? If it wanted to hurt me it would have done in the 2 minutes I stood staring at it."
Sherlock took a step back, stunned. “But Greg was against-” he got cut off by Finn grabbing at his swimming shorts and pulling. The detective had to grab them quickly before exposing himself to the whole beach.
Sherlock didn't reply, not even physically.
Greg had clearly had words with the government official because when the Dom stopped, Mycroft straightened up behind him, head down, hands at his neck.
“Shut up, Sherlock. Or I'll gag you.”
“I’m not back on the drugs, Myc, I promise. I got out by the way,” Sherlock changed the subject. “Your little lock me in trick was a pain in the arse but I got out through the roof and before you say anything, yes, I was punished, it was almost worse than that blasted paddle of Greg’s with the holes in.”
John walked into the bedroom and stood at the doorway, a tray in his hand. Sherlock was sat on the bed, staring at his feet that dangled over the side. The Dom didn’t know if he had noticed or not. So rather than jumping to the wrong conclusion he cleared his throat.
Sherlock wasn't going to bother about pulling his trousers up, but the thought that John would be angry if he ruined them, made him fold up the bottoms. Then his hands returned to his pockets as he waded in, thinking the whole while.
Sherlock stilled his struggling immediately and let out a long broken whimper.
With his wrists tied back behind him again there wasn't anything he could do to help even if he thought it was a good idea. He knelt there in silence, staring at the floor instead.
"Please," Sherlock begged, switching tactics. "We picked time with you over orgasms. Doesn't that mean something?"

The following day the four of them were sat in the sitting room in Baker Street. Well, Sherlock was knelt beside the doctor, Mycroft was knelt beside his own Dom even as Greg went through the case he had on his lap.
“I think your brother was expecting some sort of witty retort. That doesn’t happen anymore, does it, boy?”
Irene had stepped back to the side of the room with Eurus once again. She had a full glass of wine in her hand.
The blond sighed, he should have gagged the brat. "What do you want, Sherlock?" He asked, sipping his beer again.
“So, little brother,” the older sub began as John lowered them both onto the sofa, letting Sherlock turn sideways to protect himself. “What was all that about?”
“Then what do you choose?”
“Shh,” the doctor raised his hand to cup his cheek. “I know what you’re like, it’s fine. What’s the plan now anyway?”
“I also have a working relationship with Molly Hooper at Bart’s.”
The Dominatrix rolled her eyes. "It looks like we're going to have to do something about the Ice Man, though that name obviously doesn't fit him anymore. Look how much he cares about his little brother."
Greg glanced between the other couple and nodded. "Sure."
"It's fine, Mycroft," he whispered.
"Relax, babe, I'm not going to bite."
The detective stared down the beach at the boy and saw Mycroft struggling to keep up with him. “I think he’s definitely going to be too tired.”
“He-”
When Sherlock had come down from his subspace high, John told him they should go and eat but he was clearly still floaty as he remained latched onto the Dom. John had moved them to the bed on the play side of the room and settled his hand into his pet's messy curls.
Finn watched him for a moment. “No! The colours are boring.”
Mycroft bit his lip and looked at the younger Dom.
"Uncle Mycie," Finn wheedled, "can’t we have ice cream first?"

“What are you looking at?” he spat at his brother.
"Did you google any of this when bought it?"
“Sherlock, you know the area, where would you suggest?”
Sherlock actually laughed at that, it hadn’t been the answer he was expecting, not from some seemingly uptight professional Dom.
John ran his hand between his boy's legs and fondled his balls for a moment before giving them a hard squeeze. "Greg's right, of course."
15 minutes on the dot, John entered his sub’s room. He was staring down, whether it be at the floor, his knees or his caged cock it didn’t matter. What did matter was the fact that his hands were still behind his head and he hadn’t struggled or fought the leash this time. John found himself feeling bad for the boy… almost. He would have done the same with any other sub. Sherlock had over-stepped the line too many times whilst he’d been knelt at the top of the stairs. It had been uncalled for. But he still felt sorry for the boy. It appeared he hadn’t realised what he had been doing and if he had, he hadn’t realised he was being rude. John was back to thinking about Sherlock wanting to submit, but not wanting to want to. He had known from the first time he had met him that things would have to be different to how he worked with other subs. There would be a lot more patience needed, less routine because he was easily bored and therefore distracted and more second chances.
The younger man closed his eyes, and John quickly smirked. He’d been bluffing about knowing he was desperate. He could have been sat uncomfortably because of his paddling last night rather than needing the toilet, but he had seen his older brother, Mycroft, deducing things all the time and knew how it worked, even if he didn’t necessarily know how to do it himself.
“Calm, babe,” Moran jerked his head at the gun. “Or you'll lose that perfect aim of yours.”

“C’mon, pet, kneel next to me. You know this.”
Sherlock did so, but then he just stood there, basking in the afterglow.
Irene ran her nail down his chest, humming to herself. Then she grabbed his cock and squeezed. He tried his best not to react. All that gave him away were the facts his breathing sped up and his jaw clenched.
John wrapped his arms around his boy and started teasing his nipples. He pulled on then, twisted and pinched them hard until Sherlock started making little whimpering sounds. "Aw, boy, do they hurt?" He pinched them harder. Just as Sherlock tried to move again, Mycroft bit down. "Mycroft is becoming… independent again," John laughed.
"I've got water, if you'd prefer?"
John swore internally. Just what he needed, all because Sherlock couldn’t control his deductions when they weren’t needed. The doctor had a duty to keep Mycroft to hand when Greg wasn’t around, not only because he was the only Dom for several miles but because of specific instructions from the government official’s Dom himself. That had been decided long before he had taken Sherlock on.
A short time later, long enough for Sherlock to have had too much and not enough stimulus from the mounted dildo, John pulled his chair up beside the younger man's and began feeding him from his plate. He was surprised when Sherlock took the bite, chewed and swallowed without any resistance.
“Come up here, pet. I think it’s about time we gave your knees a break, no?”
"You can eat them, you know," Greg said with a smirk.
“Stop right there, pet.”
It was several hours later, they’d sat in the sitting room by the log fire for over an hour, drinking what was left of the hot chocolate and warming each other up.
As soon as his head lowered and the Dom was out of sight, Sherlock flipped. He sprung to his feet so fast he should have found himself dizzy once he was vertical. Instead, he ended up pressed against the nearest wall.
"Sir, sirs, can I have a moment alone with my brother please?" Mycroft asked the two Doms.
“Yes, sir.”
The four men on the arrested Doms led them out.
“Stand up, pet.”
Siger held him tight, glancing at Sherlock and smiling broadly. Sherlock had helped more than one scared little boy when he had insisted he take him in. He’d given them all a family.
A few weeks ago Greg and John had said a month. A whole month on orgasm denial. However, at the time there had been no holiday planned. No escape from work. No reason.
Sherlock shifted against him, moaning slightly as something touched his cock. It wouldn’t be anywhere near as painful as it had been a few hours ago but that didn’t mean it would be completely desensitized. In a way the Dom felt it and tensed when Sherlock grumbled something again.
At 27 seconds John came, hard down the back of Sherlock's throat. He held the boy by the curls while he coughed and swallowed.
"Irene, come here," Eurus ordered.
“I’m not complaining, sir,” Mycroft countered, his voice tight.
The Dom still had hold of his ear and Sherlock whimpered slightly. “I was going to get a cab? Sir?”
John carried him through to the bathroom and put him down on the loo.
“No, sir. Not anymore.”
Throwing all caution to the wind, the doctor let his stick lean against the wall and he wrapped his arms around the younger man. “That was fantastic.”
"Sherlock won't be needing his," John said, taking one for himself.
Surprised, but not about to complain, Sherlock nodded. "Yes, sir."
“You can move from position,” John said absently, there was still an under layer of anger in the Dom’s tone, but it was fading rapidly, especially with a meek submissive in front of him. He watched as the boy collapsed from his knees and curled tightly into a bundle; protecting his mistreated cock.
“Mycie, I didn’t... I just thought... well all the trouble I’ve been in recently...” he thought that explained itself.
Irene lifted the stretcher along with Sherlock's bollocks, then let them drop again. He grimaced and let out a hiss of pain around the gag, causing both women to laugh.
“Go’way!”
John smiled as he continued. “It would be temporary, like your violin was.”
“I’ve never done it before, with strangers, but then again, I’ve never been accosted before.” John couldn’t work out whether to be proud or slightly wary.
“S-Sorry, sir.”
“I do apologise for my sub,” John offered as he reentered the sitting room where Greg and Mycroft were.
Sherlock, in full pout, stood and followed his boyfriend out of the ice cream parlour. "John, I have no idea what you're upset about this time."
“Wasn’t your fault,” Mycroft cut in.
John whisked away the bucket, then hosed his boy off using only cold water. He toweled him off for the sake of the equipment. It wouldn't have mattered to him if Sherlock had started to shiver.
There was a glimmer of hope and once again John found himself imagining what previous Doms would have done at the sight - no doubt laughed and hidden it again.
John tapped in the code for the playroom door and dropped his hand onto his sub’s head who glanced up and smiled. “Of course, sir.”
Sherlock let himself be hugged. “I'm not in trouble?”
He half expected the younger man to protest, but he didn’t. He just reversed and then knelt up again.
Usually, at this point in the conversation, Sherlock would complain about the idea of food, but all he did was roll from the bed to his knees, waiting for John to straighten his suit.
DO NOT start telling me this is unfair, abusive, wrong or any of that shit, it is what I AM WRITING. If you want to write 120000 words on the same fic YOU can choose how you want it to go.
John tipped his head on one side. “We have a son now.”
John picked up the bit of pear that he had dropped on the plate in order to deal with his sub.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, but headed to the bedroom to get dressed. He didn't want everyone making a fuss over him. Things were bad enough already.
He had gone into full strop.
There was a beat of complete silence.
"Permission to speak and not get punished, sir?"
“She could have checked into a hotel, left the case there,” John offered.
"But I need to pee!"
The Dom moved back to the table as calm as anything. He was pleasantly surprised to find his sub hadn’t moved at all. He tied the leash around the table leg.
Sherlock sighed, wringing his hands in his lap, his brother just didn't understand.
“Sherlock, you git,” He puffed. “I’ve been running around London for hours.”
“Sir,” he moaned, brokenly, how had it all become too much too quickly? He knew he needed to regain control over himself. But was struggling, he didn't want to come… well he did, but with John's permission. From now on, always with John's permission.
"No, sir."
When John returned he saw his boy and huffed. "Why are you in such a difficult mood?"
With a sigh, the younger brother copied him and followed.
Mycroft obeyed at once as John finished the rope harness.
Sherlock sighed, he knew arguing never got him anywhere but he did it almost on instinct.
"He's not going to settle down, is he?"
It was Mycroft who spoke. "He's scared, John."
Sherlock didn't move. He felt guilty enough, he couldn't stand the comfort John seemed willing to offer, not when he didn't deserve it.
When the tea was brought in, John paused the maid who had placed the tray on the table. “Would you give Irene my apologies and ask to reschedule?”
“I'm sorry, sir.”
Enjoy!
Irene smirked. "Come sit by me, junior. Mother will take care of you."
“John, just leave him, he'll come out of Panic soon enough.”
“They matter to Mycroft as he pays your bills.”
John took hold of the younger man’s hands and brought them down behind him to rest at his lower back.

“Correct, but we did discuss me taking it away as punishment.”
"You'll like Game of Thrones, Sherlock," he said, pausing to put the disc into the TV that had been set up in the room.
By lunch time, Sherlock was sobbing uncontrollably, he had originally stayed curled up, but now he was sat back on his knees, his hands back resting behind his head, reminding him that the Dom was angry and had called him boy. He didn’t know why, he just felt closer to his Dom in this position, the one John had left him in.
John shrugged, not worried yet, but not far off. "Do you want to go and take a seat in the lounge and I'll go and I will find out?”
Sherlock must have heard his footsteps, because he tensed where he was in a heap. Slowly, but with controlled movements, he shifted around and pushed himself back onto aching knees; that’s what he had to do when the Dom entered the room, so that was what he did. His head touched the floor in front of the Dom’s feet briefly and then he brought it up so he could stare at the floor, his hands raised. After a second or so of trying to work the stiffness out, he he placed them behind his neck with a small sniff, not daring to speak.
"Have you got these two covered?"
Many hours later, John had moved them to the bed in the corner. The detective was still cuffed, hands and feet and he wasn't complaining.
“You wish, brat.” He smiled just as the clouds above them opened. They were soaked within minutes and half a mile from the mansion.
“You, with the gun, take three steps to the right.” The man directly behind the kneeling Dom moved as specified once again and Benjamin could see him out of the corner of his eye.
"Now!" She barked, slapping him and sending him sprawling. With his hands cuffed behind him, he had no way to protect himself.
“I am dealing with your brother, before he breaks something or himself. Now you know what has caused this and you know how your brother reacts to Panic. So kneel there and keep quiet or I shall tie you in the corner.”
"Right, sir."
Greg started pulling on the 'vines' that were hanging from the ceiling. He had a mind to try a bit of suspension with his boy. He got everything just where he wanted it, then called Mycroft over. The government official was looking rather sorry for himself when he turned around, and then he saw the ropes. "Problem?"
“Sir?” the sub repeated again, a deep frown brought his eyebrows together. John let his hand go and ruffled his curls, they were going to be even messier in a moment anyway.
Sherlock had been over the bench for about half an hour so it was time for a change in position. He removed the cuffs from the legs holding the bench up and detached his leash from it too.
Mycroft's mouth watered as he watched his brother squirm. He wished he could have his brother's balls in his mouth. He'd suck on them one by one and bite them, making him writhe even more.
“Help me get him in my car, then you can be on your way.”
It wasn’t unusual for Sherlock not to be about, he spent quite a lot of his free time down in the underground lab, the better behaved he was, the more equipment he was allowed and in turn this meant more time was spent playing with it and experimenting rather than getting up to mischief in front of his Dom and getting into trouble. He’d also had some more human body parts brought over from St Barts, mostly gifts from Molly trying to bribe him to pop his head in when he got the chance. Sherlock had pondered over asking his Dom if they could, but he wasn’t sure of the answer and he didn’t want to set himself up just to fail, because if that happened he was highly likely to get himself into a state and either end up in Panic or get into trouble, something he had been trying his upmost to avoid.
Greg walked over and ran the crop along his boy's spine. "I'm not going to tie you up. I expect you to stay right where you are without moving. Do not disappoint me."
Greg rolled his eyes, finding himself agreeing with the sub in the back. “Donovan, out.”
He realised this Domme was probably a little - or rather a lot - harsher with her sub than John was with his. The detective was instantly glad of that. And the guilt rose up again.
“Oh, no, no, no. It doesn’t work like that. You count in order from the beginning of the number system. That’s how counting works. But as you pointed out, I had hit you 4 times, so we’ll go to 14. Shall we?”
Irene had begun to push the plug into his hole and paused to stop when he began to have a tantrum. "You know this little show won't stop or change anything, right?"
“Yes, sir,” he whispered. The word ‘trying’ got to him though, he thought he was being perfect. He’d even helped with breakfast.
“However if you orgasm without permission, pet, you will be punished as I see fit. The tally will not come into it. I am warning you now, if you think the punishments you have recently experienced are bad, they will be nothing in comparison. I use the method of punishment that other Dom’s do when this rule is broken and if you haven’t experienced it you will know of it, am I right?”
"Turn around. Trousers down."
“Well?”
“Now turn back around and get on your knees.”
Greg nodded once, checking the junction before turning.
“Do you like fishing, pet?”
"You don't want to come?"
“Good boy,” he ruffled Sherlock's curls briefly as he replaced the cap and patted his arse.
“Sam could you request the maid staff to return please? I think it's about time.”
The blond dragged him down the stairs and out into the car that had pulled up at the curb. The doctor pulled him down onto his lap rather than beside him or even on the floor.
“John.”
“Could you fetch us two cups of tea and a slice of whatever cake you have baked today?”
“That I am, boy,” he responded. He smirked as Sherlock’s head snapped up at that term of address and realised he wasn’t really in trouble. “But I meant with the case, you git.”
He glanced up at his Dom and John nodded reassuringly.
"What do you say, pet?"
The sub dropped back to his knees and crawled slightly behind his Dom as John walked through to the dining room.
Mycroft did as he was told, then looked in the mirror. He had to admit the image he was presented with wasn't all bad. If Greg liked it... well, then, all the better.
Reluctantly obeying, Sherlock manoeuvred over to lay as directed and whispered quietly, “Redbeard.” With a touch of John’s box, Sherlock’s cuffs attached to the front leg of the stool. The Dom moved the boy”s legs so they ran parallel to the back legs of the stool and again activated the cuffs. Sherlock grunted as his legs straightened and he was bent double.
Irene went over to the trunk and brought back three pairs of clover style nipple clamps. "I'll start with these." She approached Sherlock with them and attached one end of each set to his nipples and his cock. "Now for you, Ice Man. Come over here and face your brother."
He began to thrash again, now knowing he had not one Dom, but two to show off in front of.
As soon as he was on the floor, John started untying him. When Sherlock was able to shift positions, his muscles screamed with pain. His Dom had expected it, however, and started massaging them immediately.
“No, sir. That wasn’t the worst bit. He would carry me to my room afterward and drop me on the floor and the bubble I was in suddenly… disappeared.”
I know it's been absolutely forever since my last update but I started a new business in January and it just flew away from me but I promise I WILL finish this fic... One day 😂
Sherlock stood there awkwardly for a moment and then smiled sheepishly once he had been let go. Greg was watching the pair of them with an admiring smirk on his face, the detective just poked his tongue out at him.
John perused the shelves, knowing his submissive would take his clothes off without argument.
Greg set Sherlock down on his feet and the detective looked around, grinning at the walk in shower. John flicked the hot water on from the side and pushed Mycroft over to join his brother.
Sherlock smiled. “Loads better. My wrist has been completely healed for days. John’s been great.”
Sherlock met his eyes after a long moment. “I don’t know when to stop,” he whispered.
“You should have done that earlier.”
"Irene, you don't have to do this," Sherlock pointed out.
“Being in charge doesn’t make me more or less of a person than you. It gives me more responsibility, yes. It doesn’t mean you can just disobey me. But obeying me comes with protection. My protection. You were not the only one who signed the contract and you may have done it under certain conditions with your brother, but I gave you a way out just this morning and you refused. You want to be here, pet, and you know deep down that I do not want to harm you in any way, hence the fact you have a safe word. How did you get out of the relationship?”
“Mmm.”
Just for fun, Mycroft indulged in a bit of fancy flying. Why not? The next couple of days would be unpleasant and this was his last chance to have a bit of fun.
The detective sighed, but obediently kept his mouth shut.
John just grabbed him by his collar and dragged him towards the stairs.
Sherlock smirked and then, before he knew what he was doing, he had wrapped his arm around him and was hugging him tight. “I like a lot, sir.”
"Thank god. Get some rope and help me get him tied up. He's absolutely wild."
“So, what happened to that cop?” John asked as he poured tea from the tray already on the table. Sherlock had prepared it 10 minutes ago. The cop situation had been a long time ago - or at least it felt like it and a lot had happened since.
John’s grin was hidden by the device in his hand. He jumped up straight away and released the chain attaching the boy to the wall. “Good boy.”
“I don’t… I… yes, sir.”
The doctor nodded put the glass on the side and then pointed to the corner.
"Don't say a word. You had your chance."
Greg sighed. "Stuff him full with something then," he said with a laugh.
“Oh, is that uncomfortable, boy?”
"John used to work with her. And now he doesn't. Because of me." Sherlock pulled his hands back.
John tipped his head on one side, regarding Sherlock for a minute, he supposed he could understand that. "We need to eat. But first," he leant forward to remove the buckle from his collar to the armbinder.
John clipped him on the back of the head and shoved his jacket into his chest. "Stop being rude."
Before they had a chance to go inside, Mycroft poked his head out of the separate room they were using that night, Greg snoring in the background.
“Shut the door, pet, and present.”
The government official didn't know about his brother, but his arse and thighs could certainly attest to his Dom's efforts. He stared ahead unseeing, paying attention to the heady sensation of the stinging, burning pain.
John stood in front of his sub and folded his arms, watching. Of course, Sherlock didn't know he was there.
Sherlock snorted, but it was Mrs. Hudson who answered.
The doctor watched a moment, until the DI had encouraged him out of the room, and then turned to Sherlock.
The fucking machine had turned itself off, having a time limit on operation, so John didn't have to turn it off, but he would have to remove the dildo attachment from his pet's hole... eventually. He really wasn't in a hurry.
"Something your brother said earlier."
“If I untie you will you remain in position for another 10 minutes?”
"You will answer questions put to you," Eurus hissed.
The doctor ran his hands through the brat's curls, soothing not only the sleeping sub but himself. He hadn't said anything that he hadn't been expecting. But there hadn't been an apology for running off, nor an explanation. He was beginning to wonder how he should go about getting that information out of the younger man. Not that it actually mattered, he seemed to have accepted the new dynamic and for now that was enough.
"Well they wouldn't want me getting free, would they?" Sherlock grumbled, rolling his shoulders.
As the Dom’s steps drew near, the detective’s shoulders tensed, his collar hidden behind his shirt. The blond tugged it free and clipped on his leash and then cuffed him with the handcuffs that the DI had conveniently left on the table for him. The leash was attached to the cuffs and threaded around his fingers.
Blinking up at John, the sub bit his lip, then he finally, finally nodded. It was all the Dom could do not to jump in place, he was so relieved to finally get a genuinely positive reaction.
"Thank me."
Sherlock sighed. "190 something. Don't care."
"If you had turned up in Baker Street, maybe my reaction would have been closer towards happy."
“And Victor,” John spat the name like it was venom, “
“You will have a very sore arse.”
He hadn’t said a word at all, he was looking rather bewildered but the only emotion that was definitely clear was anger but not toward the only sub in the room but at his so called friend who had got them into this in the first place. He kept stubbornly silent, refusing to meet the man’s eye.
John grinned, then burst out giggling. "Alright, fine. Just the one." He collapsed onto the sofa and made himself comfortable. He looked off to the side and watched both Holmes brother on the nearby screens.
The doctor was just glad he'd got to him in time and that he was safe in his arms once again. He didn't know what he would have done, had he have been too late.
Growling softly, almost inaudibly, John pulled the leash until a head of curls appeared from beneath the pillows on the sub’s bed. John kept pulling and eventually Sherlock ran out of room to move and collapsed in a heap on the floor.
"They have to catch us first," Sherlock laughed.
“You ate too much,” the doctor sighed in realisation. “Why didn’t you say anything?”
The detective quickly shed all his clothes in a neat pile and moved back to the exact spot John had put him in. He didn't ask why he had been told to get dressed again a few hours before, it wasn't like they kept apart from the other two anymore.
The younger Holmes shook her head. "No."
“Was that the front door?” Greg asked, looking around the flat. His hand had caught in his boy's hair and he quickly pulled it free when he winced.
“You can't threaten me like that, Donovan, I'll have my-”
“My boy has been feeling rather sorry for himself since we left,” the older Dom smiled.
"You know, there's something about chips from a newspaper," Greg said as he forced a handful into Mycroft's mouth.
"Please."
“Hello,” Sherlock whispered. Feeling ridiculous, as an emotion he had never experienced before became prominent; shyness.
"Enough! Stop the arguing."
He pushed the play room door open with his toe and folded his arms across his chest.
“If you behave today, I will uncage you tomorrow and you will not be needing a milking. If you don't behave today… well I think it's fairly obvious.”
Greg put his arm around him. "Relax. He'll be okay."
He’d been with John less than a day, but he was completely different from what experience had taught him to expect. That didn’t mean he could trust him. He might have just been tricking him, letting him get close to hurt him psychologically rather than physically. It was just as feasible, if not more so than this Dom actually
“Why?”
"Do you have anything to say before we continue?" John wanted to be sure the boy was in control of the scene even if it appeared the Dom did.
Grrr! He kicked at the wall and sunk down it, his head in his hands. He was supposed to be good at this sort of thing, breaking and entering, it was sort of in the job description, but this plan of Mycroft’s, despite the fact he had indeed got out, was practically fool proof.
When Irene realised that Eurus had left once again, she laughed. "It seems you're talking from experience."
“What’s up, pet?” He hadn’t stayed under long, but it should be long enough to get him through the next few days. This wasn’t subspace quiet or even a variant on Panic quiet, this was something different.
“Think what you like, brother-mine, I would never put you in harm’s way for the sake of drama, as you put it.”
At the knock on the door, Sherlock jerked in surprise, realising he’d been drifting away. John moved to answer it, shooting a glance in the corner, ensuring his brat remained still.
Although Sherlock hadn't resisted Eurus, he couldn't keep himself from flushing in anger. "You don't like what my girlfriend is doing do you, baby brother? I can tell. Go ahead, try to act out."
At his brother's words, Mycroft flinched. "You shouldn't have had to face it alone."
It had taken a few days but Sherlock had begun to open up to him before, explaining about some things Victor had done. He had even discussed his violin and why it meant so much to him. Not answering the Dom’s questions had led to Wilkes gaining access to his property and doing far to his boy.
Greg tilted his head in understanding and raised his hand towards his own sub. Mycroft caught the action and immediately dropped to his knees, his hands coming up behind his head, but kept tugging at his hair insistently. He needed a distraction, anything, to keep his mind off what he had let happen to Sherlock.
The Dom wasn’t very long and when he returned he had his collar up and was fiddling with a dark grey tie.
John settled on the sofa and then pulled his sub down so he was laid out across it, his head in his lap.
"Shut up. John, do the same to mine as you are doing with yours."
“You've been missing the last 6 hours. And not that crime scene. The jewellers.”
"Come here before I drag you here and spank your arse."
Sherlock took a deep breath and scooped the little girl up. "I can't promise you that, but what I can promise you is cake and ice cream when I do get back?"
The doctor paused and stared down at his boyfriend, who was in pieces as much as he himself was.
“Of course, dear. Have fun,” she winked.
“No!”
“But that’s mine again.”
John’s growl was deep and threatening. It was enough for Sherlock to sob. “Coming without permission, sir,” and then; “Please, sir, please don’t punish me again. I’m sorry, sir, I’m sorry.” He hadn’t meant to be provocative. His mind was quiet, but it was distracting. He couldn’t think straight around the pain.
“You’re not bored now, are you?”
The youngest Holmes walked over to stand in front of Mycroft. "It will be as I wish."
He then turned to his poor sub, knowing that he was much more important than his feelings towards the arsehole on the floor. Sherlock’s eyes were wide with fear and when he spotted his Dom looking at him, he pushed himself to his knees despite John’s protests. He was muttering out, “I’m sorry, sir. I’m sorry, sir,” on a never ending loop and it made the Dom feel sick.
Mycroft's body clock was all out of sync by the time his sister and Irene reappeared. Way out of sync.
Leaning back slightly, John shook his head. “No, of course not.”
Reluctantly, the little boy climbed up in his chair. He was almost too excited to eat, but it was a waffle with chocolate chips after all, so he managed.
Sherlock couldn’t believe this was his fifth day with John, and he also couldn’t believe the man hadn’t kicked him out yet. He hadn’t done anything drastic, but he hadn’t exactly been polite either. His previous Doms had made damn sure he knew his place. He did know his place, he knew he was submissive, but the thought of being submissive with them, right now, even then made him sick. He tried to process the differences between John and his old Doms and despite the fact that he found quite a few, the patience for one, he couldn’t make himself fully submit. He felt the urge to do so grow more every day and he knew it was inevitable. He liked to think that when it came he would enjoy it, it had been so long since he had managed to reach subspace and the last time he had done, he couldn’t help but think it hadn’t been healthy and the feeling afterward had been terrible.
Sherlock sniffed, “Yes, sir.” He was practically empty and the plug he had inside him was useless, but on top of that, John was going to cane him.
Sherlock snapped his head around to look at his brother. "I'm not!" At that precise moment, Irene's foot impacted his ribs, sending him sprawling.
“Good boy.” He kissed his lower back. “But what if I was to…” he trailed off and twisted his finger inside his hole, pushing it in to his second knuckle.
The older Holmes' mouth opened and closed a few times before he spoke. "He's being perfect."
He found Sherlock curled into a heap on the bed, covering himself with a pillow.
They returned carefully back to the table with their drinks, John kissing the top of Sherlock’s head in passing.
Sherlock’s face is absolute manic delight as he glanced up at him. “Serial killers are always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake.”
The detective shook his head, “John won't mind.” Even so, when he knocked on the door it was tentative.
“37, sir,” he panted, his cheek resting on the edge of the bench in exhaustion.
The two brothers shared glances, not liking the sound of that at all.
“You certainly did that, pet. The question is, did your arse agree with your mission?”
"He's the head of the rest of the world," Sherlock decided on entering the rest of the conversation.
"Talk to me, Sherlock." Mycroft was concerned that his brother was taking to long to wake up. Sherlock had an unfortunate tolerance for many drugs and the fact he wasn't fully awake yet was worrisome.
“I don't know!” His voice rose in annoyance, he still couldn't believe that he actually didn't. The place he ended up was far too complicated for him to have tracked. He didn't know why he wasn't mentioning it to anyone except his brother. His brother that had disappeared. Abandoned him. Left him with... her.
Here it is guys, the long awaited start to the intimate part of this pairs' relationship!
“You, sir.”
"Pet?" John asked, worried, he stood up immediately. "You ok?"
“I like him, I just think he only likes me because I was the reason he met my brother. Not really the same, is it?”
In his dazed confused state at such a sudden turn in events John managed to cuff the copper around a pole and then to his mate.
John let the paddle fall once again.
Greg sighed. "I don't like it either."
The detective squeezed his eyes shut and tried to wriggle away from the pinwheel. John just grabbed one of the ropes and held him in place whilst he worked.
“What?” He was not in the most helpful mood. He was bored and fed up.
"I still have that water." John pulled a bottle of water out of a bag at his feet.
"Because you let me down last time. He was ill and we couldn't play. We can now."
He had promised Sherlock a milking and knew he wouldn't be asleep very long. Not in the position he was in. So he had just waited.
Eurus rolled her eyes. "Don't take all day. My big brother is getting bored."
The sight of Sherlock had it's effect on the Dom. John was finding it difficult to keep things simple as he had sworn he would. His pet was so enticing.
"Because she hadn't seen me in days and was likely worried."
"I wanted to see what it felt like."
The sub scrambled to obey, trying to lower his trousers as he turned. He ended up falling over on his side, legs tangled much to his humiliation.
With a huff, Sherlock wandered into the toilet and closed the door, rather surprised she hadn't followed him in and completely taken away all his dignity. He didn't know if it was his submissive instinct that had been awoken by his time with John, or the fact he wanted to be as far from her as he could get that made him obey her.
