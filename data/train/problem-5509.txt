Tony says nothing, just rests an elbow on the workshop table and leans back to enjoy watching Steve squirm.
Tony gasps as Steve slides his index finger right in. There’s so much lube that it doesn’t hurt, but it does feel strangely detached, like he really is having a medical procedure. Tony groans and bears down on the finger. He slides his head to rest on the crinkled paper of the exam table and takes a deep breath.
He’s about to get fired, he knows it. And just as he was finishing his report on the compound’s security. It is by far the most detailed thing he’s ever written. There are over a dozen security upgrades he’s recommending. There’s even graphs and pie charts!
“You’re being very compliant with the rules all of a sudden” he teases; still not sure if he’s actually glad.
“Fuck, Tony, I’m not gonna last." Steve confesses. "I’ve been hard since you called me… had to tuck my erection into my waistband and run back here full-tilt.”
“Call Jeremy, the one with the lisp in IT? He can figure out the payroll bug, and if not, have him send the test automation results to my pad and I’ll take a look.”
Tony can’t take anymore, he drops his head down to the table and says “Okay, are we ready? I feel ready.”
Upon hearing "only you," Tony presses on Steve’s prostate with conviction. In response Steve’s channel spasms tightly around his fingers. Tony quickly grabs the base of Steve’s cock with his other hand. Steve is on a hair-trigger now. Tony tightens his grip to create a make-shift cock-ring with his fist to prevent him from coming without warning.
He wants this thing with Steve to thrive, and if he’s learned anything he knows that means they need to balance each other. They need to have give and take. Challenge each other, give in to one another.
By evening they are at a good stopping place, and Tony thinks to ask: “So what are we doing about Barnes?”
Steve glances back at Tony’s sleeping form. Guess it’s time to get back to reality. He texts Sam, who responds almost immediately.
One afternoon the week before they are set to leave, Thor is down in Tony’s workshop having a new setting installed in his arm.
The sick shame of getting off to someone he knows hates him. Must hate him after all that’s happened.
He looks up at where he thinks the camera probably is, swallowing, hoping to clear some of the tightness in his throat.
He’s thought about going all the way with Becky, and when she stayed over before he left he was almost to the point of telling her they should… but everything with Tony was happening, and honestly he was feeling unsure before that because, well because he doesn’t want to have sex with someone he isn’t fully committed to. He doesn’t want it to be an easy decision he just falls into.
Eventually he eases his grip, and relaxes into a real kiss, armoured hands coming up to cradle Steve's face before he pulls away.
Steve and Tony work through some things. The penthouse has a rug that really ties the room together... Yeah let's be honest this chapter is just porn.
He pauses before squeezing Steve to him and whispering in his ear, “Did you catch that Scott thought we were hot together?”
Tony laughs and swipes another lick to pick up the foam on Steve’s chest before leaning forward to transfer the foam into Steve’s mouth with a tender kiss.
He means it. Tony can test one of his hairs if he wants. But he also means it literally; he wants Tony to take whatever he needs from him. Take him. He’s pretty sure he can’t be clearer.
Friday says nothing in return, and Tony hops up on the exam table, excited as can be. He’s just realized he has his socks on and throws them onto the clothing pile on the chair when a light knock sounds on the other side of the door.
Tony doesn’t see what Steve’s plan is until he draws himself out and slowly lowers Tony back down over himself, holding Tony’s entire weight in his arms. Oh.
Sam attempts to lighted the mood by saying “I’d like to announce that I’m pretty sure I’m in a relationship with that massage chair Tony has in the spa portion of the gym. Seriously, I am looking into what I need to do for it to be recognized by the state of New York.”
“Tony, look we need to talk” Steve says as he reaches Tony, who is now standing resigned next to the un-opened umbrella and his abandoned towel.
Everyone pauses bringing their forks back to their plates instead of to their mouths (except Vision, who ate a couple of bites at the start, but doesn’t seem to need to eat a whole meal).
He thought he might go soft after that, but then Tony offered him his mouth, still wet and pliant from despoiling his ass and he couldn’t even think. He’s honestly worried about living the rest of his life with a constant hard-on. The serum has unknown limits, and Steve has never tested
Steve feels his cheeks heat with pleasure. He think’s back to Tony’s monologue about what he wants, and his flush deepens. Tony wants him to...
Nebula has made it her personal mission to defeat all of Friday’s training courses single-handedly. So far she has beaten over half of them, but there are plenty more to go. Tony suspects she will use them as an excuse to stay behind for a while, and he’s glad. Tony has grown fond of the killer blueberry, and the training courses have a hard setting he has not even told her about.
But he wonders if she has seen enough of this latest iteration of Steve. And even if Steve wasn’t so obviously taken with Tony, Bruce can’t help but feel that Tony deserves more credit than Natasha is willing to give.
Dr. Strange lures him in, they discuss the Titan that was. Thanos' home world. The genesis of his whole mad plan, to wipe out half the universe.
It’s not like when he’s fucking Tony. Without the pressure on his own cock, he’s able to slide into a wonderful haze of pleasure that’s incredible, but doesn’t make him feel like he has to come.
Bruce glances at Steve uncertainty. Tony waves an impatient hand, "It's fine, I want Steve here too.”
Tony and Steve are sitting together on one of the sofas as usual during Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. About half-way through Tony – having seen the movie several times - has snuggled all the way up to Steve, throwing his leg over Steve’s and slotting his head under Steve’s chin.
His blush doesn’t quite fade either, and he knows that as soon as they arrive and get settled he needs to clear the air. While Tony was gone, it was easy enough to relax and be with Becky and not feel as… confused. He likes Becky so much. Being with her is so easy, and he can’t help but feel that she is what he needs; what’s best for him.
He can keep things semi-platonic. He can’t screw this up; the last thing he wants to do is push Steve and make him feel like he can’t trust Tony to respect what he wants. Honestly, he’s a little floored that Steve let them make out on the sofa. And now they are both in his bedroom and they’re going to share his bed and he’s what? Expected to keep his hands to himself?
Steve comes back to himself and pulls on the plug gently, worried about hurting Tony. His mind alight with his words. There’s some resistance as he eases out the widest part (yes, just about his size), but then it slides out smoothly. He tosses it onto the nearby shelf into a pile of washcloths and positions himself at Tony’s entrance.
“You’re wrong if you think I’m not ready to jump into this with everything I am, Tony. You, god I feel everything you just said for you too. I want, I want like you said, to reflect it right back at you.” Steve lets go of Tony’s hands to bring them up to cradle Tony’s head in his massive hands.
“Hmm,” says Tony, “well Option 2 is me finally getting my mouth on you so I can get a taste of your cock to compliment the taste I just got of your ass.” Tony is touching his cock again, just feather-light touches along his length. Steve has an absurd vision of Tony as a snake charmer, Steve’s penis slithering out of a basket, swaying to his siren song.
Tony doesn’t know what to say, he wants to say “me too” but that seems a little low-effort given the declaration Steve has just made.
It takes hours. The plans Tony already has in place get them halfway there, but none of it assumed the rogue Avengers were on board. Many things need to be re-worked, hard timelines and goals outlined to move things forward. And it’s only the beginning. Tony will have a lot more to communicate to his lawyers and the Wakandian leaders once Steve can confirm the rest are on board.
Steve traces his hands over Tony’s body for several long moments before crawling up on the bed, and inserting himself between Tony’s legs. He slides his hands up Tony's hamstrings and pushes, curling Tony’s legs up toward his chest. Still slow and easy.
But maybe that image is part of what propelled him to accept Steve that night in the tower. His greatest fear manifested, a haunting image of a world where he and Steve never reconciled.
“Ah, wait, uh, Tony just a second!” Steve’s voice caries through the slightly ajar door. It sounds almost panicked, and Tony’s first instinct is to rush into the bedroom… until he sees that Steve is covered up to his neck by the comforter and turning beat red.
Steve takes his hands off his handholds and brings them around to Tony’s front. His left hand wraps around his length, while his right cups his balls. He’s glad he’s already come once, it took the edge off. He is confidant he can handle Tony like this without losing control.
This fic and others to follow is an off-shoot of the AMAZING epistolary fic “1796 Broadway,” where ‘Captain America respectfully requests that all complaints be addressed to him in writing.’ I really admire what the authors are doing, and the slow build they are creating is so so lovely… that said, my brain won’t shut up after each post with “what now???” so this is an answer to that.
Steve just faces it all head-on. No fear. Of course he would treat this the same. Steve stands and moves toward Tony, confidence radiating off him.
Tony eyes some of his toys in the bottom basket, but refocuses on washing Steve. He's taking it slow. Just his hands and mouth will probably be overwhelming for Steve tonight. Man out of time, etc.
When he gets there Steve and Tony are waiting for him on one of the sofas. Man, they’re sitting pretty close. His mind flashes back to what he saw in Tony’s suite.
Tony rips his mouth away from Steve’s, rutting his ass back in a fervor. Steve stills and allows Tony to take control of the pace, thrusting his hips forward into Steve’s waiting hands and then his ass back onto his hard cock.
Steve hums and seems willing enough, but Tony obviously isn’t getting his point across if Steve isn’t jumping up and bridal-carrying him at a run into the shower.
Tony brings his arms up to cover his eyes. Steve slowly moves his fingers in and out, scissoring them. Soothing Tony with a gentle rhythm.
Tony is floored and finds himself blushing lightly. Steve has positioned him on his back with his legs tucked up to his chest, his ass up to the open air, spread out before him like an offering.
“Shh, okay Steve, I’m going to make you come. You’ve done so well. You’re so perfect.” Tony kneels back down behind Steve’s prone form, sliding his fingers out of Steve’s ass but keeping two fingers and a thumb tight at the base of his erection. Steve is so thick his fingers don’t even meet his thumb around its circumference. Jesus, Tony want’s that inside him.
Steve is about to turn to leave and regroup when there’s a distinct clicking noise, followed by quick a series of sliding bolts and minute beeps he’s only able to pick up because of his enhanced hearing. They mean the door is now unlocked, he’s in. He makes sure nobody is passing by in either direction and slips through, the door swings silently shut behind him.
Once he’s truly deep-throating Tony, he feels a tap on his shoulder and he pulls off, giving Tony his full attention.
Tony wishes Steve could just be direct. It’s so strange to see the same man that can make split second life and death calls in the field hem and haw over how to say “I like you.” Tony’s brain doesn’t seem to process his elaborate roundabout language. It’s doesn’t compute, and he hates that even now playing it back for himself he isn’t totally sure what Steve means.
Tony builds a mini underground transit system between the houses that takes less than one minute. In his initial pitch he said it would just be for emergencies, but soon they are using it like a set of stairs (well, one that can be locked out for privacy on both ends).
“Tell them… tell them I’ll be there as soon as I can.” Steve sighs and rubs his face quickly with his still-gloved hands before turning toward the elevators.
Steve slowly turns over and takes in Tony’s strained expression and shaking hands. He does his best to calm his voice. “Tony. Tony, it’s okay. I’m fine… my feet feel fine; they’re already healing.” He lifts up his foot again from where Tony dropped it and Tony slowly examines it. It’s already half as pink as it was before, and getting lighter by the second.
The shelf column on the right retracts and after a few moments the floor opens up and a bench about five feet long and two and a half feet deep raises up from the ground. It has very simple construction, just a hollow stone base, and a memory foam top similar to the floormats. Steve immediately shuffles over to it and slumps down, leaning his head back against the cool stone wall.
Steve can see Tony is actually considering it, so given that this all seems to be Tony getting Steve’s consent beyond a reasonable doubt, he decides to play a little dirty. He licks his lips and carefully slides his hands over Tony’s hips to hold himself steady as he leans forward, tilting his head back and to the side.
Unbelievably his cock seeps even more precum, enough that once again it’s glistening, the liquid sliding down to pool at the base.
“Press the button on the bottom-left of the painting on my side of the bed. A staircase will appear in front of you. Take the steps down and walk until you get to the exam room. Friday can answer any questions.”
Steve is about to come himself from watching Tony, so he quickly stands and inserts the head of his cock back into Tony before sliding a hand over the rest of his length and pumping his hot cum into Tony for a third time. It takes several long moments for him to wring the last of his orgasm out, just the head of his cock inserted. He slips out and presses his fingers against Tony’s entrance one more time. He doesn’t insert his fingers, just holds them there, trapping as much of his ejaculate as possible. There's so much it still just seeps out around his fingers.
Tony clears his throat. “I’m clean, I can have Friday pull up my latest tests… and I think you are probably covered by the serum?”
“I want that,” says Steve nodding, “I want everyone to know they can tell me my call is wrong. That everyone has the power to suggest another course of action and change it. I want us to decide things together. To stand united especially over the big stuff.”
Steve’s mouth quirks like he’s trying not to smile, but he remains stoic as he lifts Tony’s thin gown up past his chest, exposing Tony from the clavicle down. The room is cold, like a real doctor’s office, and Tony shivers. Steve’s hands come down to press firmly against one peck and then the other. It's almost like a massage. Steve’s large warm hands feel amazing against the cool air. His fingers graze Tony’s nipples, but in an unfocused way that Tony can tell is supposed to seem unintentional.
Steve’s voice is shaking with emotion and he’s squeezing Tony tight, just shy of the point where it’s uncomfortable. He goes on, “God I hope I haven’t ruined anything. I hope you know what this means to me...”
His hands move up to press over his eyes and then back through his hair. What’s wrong with him? Saying the right thing used to just come to him. He casts around helplessly and looks out the window. “The A is gone. Off the tower…”
“Thank you for today.” Steve breaths as he moves around the column of Tony’s throat. Tony doesn’t respond, so Steve pauses his hand, just resting it loosely around the head of Tony’s cock until Tony looks at him.
He sits closer to him, kisses him more. Just pecks on the lips, but any time they meet up or part, Tony kisses him in greeting. At first Steve is a little bashful about it. He can’t help the small tick of fear he gets being so… open. Even if it is just around their teammates.
Things are calm for a single day. The day after Bruce gets back, they all get the call from Steve via their nano earpieces.
Steve squeezes Tony’s hand so tightly that it skirts being painful. “I think, when Bruce said he would need to hear about our private lives he meant more
There’s no time for finesse, Steve is obviously almost at his limit. He’s stretched a decent amount from Tony’s fingers, so Tony seals his mouth around Steve’s lighty-abused hole and with one hard thrust inserts his hot tongue.
The nano-comms devices they were all equipped with upon moving in were supposed to be for Avengers business only, but Tony doesn’t know if Steve has his phone, and he’s not going to let this chance slip by.
Below continues a “What if” that follows them to Hawaii and does not follow cannon for “1796 Broadway” where they confess their feelings via letter... here they do it face to face. How will that change things? Dun dun dunnnnn.
Several decent cell phone shots of the kiss were taken by bystanders, and for the next several weeks they are everywhere they look. Tony knows he should apologize. He and Steve have talked about going public, but they’ve both agreed it will be a huge headache, that it needs careful planning.
Steve is hung up for a moment on the “dick pics” part, before he thinks about Tony’s last sentence. He’s pretty sure he said something like that more than three years ago after he moved into the tower when Tony was making an effort to drag him into using 21st century technology.
They stay like that, in a mesmerizing rhythm until Steve feels like he’s getting close again. Tony must be getting desperate too, Steve can see his hardness as he looks down the length of Tony’s glistening body. Red, straining straight up.
Tony steps in. “Yep, this is purely a social call. You see, Steve and I have entered into a romantic relationship, and since we’re all living together, we figured it made sense to tell everyone.”
Below you’ll find a “What if” that follows them to Hawaii and does not follow cannon for “1796 Broadway” where they confess their feelings and then are called back before they can go/cuddle. I repeat, in this fic they have not told each other how they feel, and Steve and Tony are still dancing around their feelings. Cap feels Tony isn’t in the right place to hear it, and Tony thinks there isn’t a chance in hell Steve returns his feelings.
It's exactly what Steve needs to hear. At the end of the day he's just one person. He's barely thirty. The literal fate of the world shouldn't rest on his shoulders. Once he may have thought it did, but he sees there is a better path forward.
“Alright Mr. Stark, you’re going to need to stay just like that for a little while. Then I’ll be back soon and we will proceed.”
Pepper’s crisp face appears in front of him. She looks him over and her mouth turns into a tight line.
Steve’s heart leaps, he can't believe this is actually happening after months of dreaming. After years of knowing Tony, and almost losing him...
“Tony… Tony there’s something wrong with your blood sample. You need to get down here.” Bruce sounds worried. Really worried.
Tony can only mumble, “Uh-huh” and push back on Steve’s gloved finger. Steve takes his time, as always, slowly circling inside him, pulling the finger back to almost the edge of Tony’s entrance and stretching out the rim of his hole, then sliding it back in over and over. Just when Tony is about to complain, Steve slides a second finger in with the first. Again it’s tight, and the stretch and burn feel amazing against the blissed out rush of endorphins this entire scene is setting off within him.
“Yes, I will! Thank you Mr. Stark, and you, Mr. America… er, Mr. Rogers? Wait no, there’s already a Mr. Rogers…”
Steve has never needed to come this badly. He vaguely wonders if it will be like that every time with Tony. It has so far, his need for every new orgasm dwarfing the ones that came before.
Steve buries his head into Tony’s shoulder as soon as Scott is out of the room. “Oh my god, Tony. Is everyone going to find out about us by seeing us in some phase of having sex?”
Rocket shrugs as if Tony doesn’t have a say. “You’re still using nano-tech! We give nano-tech to babies! It’s practically useless after a year with the degradation factor, and then you’re left with a total mess.”
So far their talk has gone about as well as it could have. He didn’t realize that Steve was so hurt by his silence in Japan… or that Becky was essentially Steve’s own version of trying to escape feelings he thought weren’t reciprocated. When he thinks about it like that he almost feels sorry for Becky… almost.
Tony’s machines are like family. Obviously DUM-E is bit of a block-head, and JARVIS loves to sass everyone, but… they’re the best things he’s ever done (he secretly includes the Iron Man armor in this sentiment, though in any interview he gives it’s always his superhero alter-ego that gets the lip service).
Step one is to shrink down to Ant Man size and take a tour of the exterior of the building on one of the local flying ants. He looks for any subtle weaknesses in the physical building itself. Next he takes Auntie (his name for this ant) through the inner-workings of the hanger, the garage, the shared spaces and attempts to get into the actual security system. The security system is locked up tight and Friday notices him (!) trying to find an entry point, which is actually crazy impressive.
“Yes, Tony, yes” Steve gets out. He feels like he’s floating. He’s finally here. He’s with Tony and Tony is going to take care of him.
Tony tightens his grip on Steve’s hair and grasps the base of his own cock, turning to the side a bit at the same time before twisting back to slap it wetly across Steve’s cheek.
Tony doesn’t say much on the way home. Steve doesn’t try to engage him much either. He needs to think. Knowing Tony feels this way, he’s not sure what it means for them, or for his relationship with Becky… but if he’s honest with himself Becky may be what he needs, but he
Steve shudders and gratefully does as instructed. Once again, his dreams have stoked his desire for what he’s doing, but the actual mechanics of it feel unfamiliar. He starts with just the head, getting used to the feel of it in his mouth, swiping at it with his tongue, slowly moving down a little and then back up. Then a little further, working out how to find a rhythm and breath at the same time. Since the serum anything that requires physical aptitude seems to come to him like second nature, and he’s relieved when after a few minutes he’s able to bob up and down on Tony’s erection with ease, further testing what combinations of pressure, suction, swallowing and licking Tony seems to like the most.
Bruce is back in science mode. “So you’ve been together almost… eight months? I think I’ll need to run some more tests. And… I may need to ask some pretty personal questions about your sexual activity.”
He covers his eyes with an arm and just lets loose. Might as well get it out there. Steve will have plenty of time to digest while they all sit through this performance at the New York City Center.
“Please fuck me with your tongue, Steve. Open me up, get me ready. I want to feel you inside me. I don’t want to wait anymore, I’ll hold myself open, just for you. I’m ready, take me with your mouth,
Tony nods, pulling Steve in for another kiss, running his tongue against Steve's. Eventually he eases back and rests his forehead against Steves. “You’re really good at this by the way.” he says, motioning to the exam room. “I didn’t know what to expect.”
“Earlier I think I was just realizing what a big change this all would be. Things are so different now, and I knew people wouldn't be against us, against me liking men too... I just had some old fears hanging around in my head. But telling everyone, it's been so good. I'm ready. I really – god Tony, I don’t even have the words to tell you, there aren’t any that seem like they are enough. Even “I love you” seems too small.”
All the heat and pleasure that was centered against the mattress shifts and Steve feels it radiating out of his entire body, like he’s on fire. In an instant he’s kissing Tony for all he’s worth, because you can’t just hear something like that and not.... He moves to align their bodies, to finally get some friction, but Tony’s hands come up to still his hips before they press down.
Steve is maneuvering him now, pressing forward to slide one hand to the plane where his back meets his ass, the other going up to the center of his back between his shoulder blades. Steve takes a deep breath, and lifts Tony, shifting up fully on to his knees.
His shower has everything you could want, and a few things most people wouldn’t even dream of… yes he definitely needs to get Steve in the shower.
“I’m not laughing because this isn’t serious. It is. And I know you’re just concerned. But… I don’t know how to make you understand Pepper. We fit. He understands the hero gig. He knows me, and all my flaws and wants me anyway, or even because of them? I don't know. We’re a team. A literal team, and a figurative one."
His train of thought is broken as the hiss of the lab doors sounds. He should have known Steve would come busting into the lab. He enters, well, like a man on a mission. He hasn’t even bothered to change out of his uniform.
Steve pulls off his second boot and sock, then his pants and his briefs in one swift movement, tossing it all to the side towards the elevator. Impatient.
And Tony is still apologizing, and still trying to explain how this won’t ruin things and Steve knows he can’t let Tony go on thinking he’s politely not interested…
Steve’s heart lurches. He knew, in an abstract way this was hard on them especially. But he feels like a total asshole for not thinking more about their kids. He knows they chose to follow him, chose to stand by him despite the consequences. But that actually makes it worse.
“Er, right, so the idea will be that I can fly back to California a couple of times a month, and just like, be on-call out there if you guys need me? I can get back to New York in 10-12 hours probably from whenever you contact me. I have that snazzy nano-comm…”
Clint and LASS-E Tear. It. Up. Balls are thrown, arrows are caught mid-air in her jaws, and Clint actually does get to take her on a mission (though she has to stay in the hellicarrier).
Steve knows he’s chickening out, but he’s just so overwhelmed. He never imagined growing up that he’d spend a day walking around telling his closest friends and co-workers that he’s in a relationship with another man.
“How would Friday know that Tony?! Is she watching? You said that she wasn’t, that your security system halts recordings and that we have privacy when we-“ He can’t say it. It’s some metal block left over from growing up in the 20s and 30s. People just didn’t talk about these things. Even the blue humor he heard in the army was full of inuendo and coded language.
Tony in turn, where he once would have made some cutting crack about Steve just grins in response and says, “Right, the point is the kid needs to be trained up too. He’s in sort of a holding pattern as a “potential future Avenger.” So, once a month with his aunt’s permission he’ll be joining our training sessions, like a baby-Avenger field trip. That is, assuming everyone is good with that?”
Tony tilts his head and waves his hand in front of the screen. Pepper looks frozen, but that can’t be right. The new comms system he’s installed should work even in the event of a nuclear blast.
Tony's bite doesn't leave a mark though he bit with intent. Interesting. He makes a mental note to test what exactly he'll need to do to leave lasting marks on Steve's body.
Bucky tested him constantly in their youth to see what, if anything, could wake him. On the list of things that didn’t work: tickling his feet, an ice pop on the neck, loud noises like yelling/banging/clapping, shaking, nose-honking, hair pulling, and ear-flicking. Even the smell of his favorite stew… nothing.
The shower wall with the handles is absolutely covered with Steve’s ejaculate. The auto-rainfall cycle starts, rinsing the wall clean. Tony absently wonders if he should disable that feature. He turns back to Steve on the bench.
, Steve.” Tony is breathing harshly, seemingly struggling to speak around his own rage. “You may not have noticed since you ran away, but everything, and I mean everything is
Steve is actually the one that thinks it’s a great idea first. Tony has been talking about stepping back in the day-to-day Avenging, and so the timing couldn’t be better. Steve has always wanted to be a father, and if in this arrangement he isn’t “dad” he figures he would at least be like… like a stepparent? And the idea of a mini-Tony running around, he just can’t think of anything better.
Steve is struggling to understand. What Tony is saying, it feels like the warm sun on a snow drift. Thawing out his fears. But…
“Yeah, yep that sounds good. Let’s, let’s get this show on the road doc!” Tony can’t take much more before he just starts jacking himself in the middle of the exam table. He’s sure Steve could play that off, but damn, he’s more than ready to get started and have Steve touch him already.
“I’m going to touch you now, just to get a look at the area. Then I’ll be applying the lubricant, and begin the process to prepare you for the treatment.”
As they took several photos with the happy couple, Tony tried not to look at Steve too much, feeling so suddenly exposed.
Tony wants Steve to see him and feel regret, or envy, or some burning emotion he can’t articulate. He wants Steve to see him looking healthy and whole, the opposite of broken and bleeding with a shield jammed in his chest.
He could build the cutest robotic dog imaginable and Steve would realize that a robot dog is the opposite of terrifying. Maybe he’d make the metal alloys in red white and blue …
“I thought we would put some of this to use” Steve says and he works himself roughly with his free hand, cockhead still resting on Tony’s upturned hole. After a couple of seconds Tony’s body vibrates in understanding. He feels the slick moisture drip onto his exposed entrance. Fuck, Steve is milking his precum out onto Tony to act as make-shift lube.
Tony gives in, sliding the finger in up to the knuckle. Suddenly he wants to know what Steve is feeling, what he might be comparing these sensations to.
“I’m… really good. Better than good. Is “best” a feeling?” Steve laughs almost in disbelief. “God Tony, I don’t think there was
And Tony falls the rest of the way into his lap and leans in to kiss him. And for a moment Steve lets himself imagine
Friday!” says Steve, nearly choking in his own panic in a rush to prevent them from having to hear Friday say the words “oral stimulation.”
“Yep, I had Friday order one and it should be waiting for you in the penthouse’s delivery box. You and me are going to need to be in constant contact, sending files, reviewing strategy, exchanging dick pics. I’d give you a Stark Pad but I know you ‘don’t see the point because it’s just a bigger, harder to hold smart phone.’”
Nebula stiffens. “I’m fine. My body… there’s usually one thing or another that hurts. It’s fine. I haven’t had time to conduct repairs in a while.”
Sam>> Hey I’ve been worried ... Whoa that’s great! FYI I didn’t tell the team where you went. I know you said it was up to me, but I think all of this is gonna be better coming from you.
an interesting offer… maybe not my cars but, you could get all dolled up and spangle-y and wash the armor?”
After they've eaten again, Tony says, “Come lay on the sofa with me, I want to talk some more, but it’s not like, logistics and planning. More just, general “us” stuff.”
After laying there for a while, contemplating if it’s possible to die from embarrassment, a thought occurs to him.
Steve rubs the back of his neck and looks like he’s about to sink into the lab’s floor from embarrassment.
Jesus. Steve palms himself to take the edge off and pushes away the self-doubt that creeps up as he remembers Tony’s words. He already jumped to doubting himself and doubting Tony once tonight; he won’t do it again. Steve wants to give Tony what he needs. To show him he can give as good as he gets. And yeah, the idea of owning Tony… he needs to restructure his headspace a bit. Months of dreams where Tony subjugated him have left him at a bit of a loss.
Steve and Tony deal with the aftermath of sharing Tony's bed. This is p0rn, but all they actually do is touch foreheads... Tony's POV with Steve's to follow in the next chapter.
Tony walks over, stripping off his shirt. He isn’t really focused on sex at the moment, even though they’re both naked and he still has a butt plug up his ass. He just wants to feel Steve’s skin on his. He pulls Steve to him into a firm hug.
Steve definitely likes when he talks. He just needs to paint him a picture. “There’s so much I want to do with you Steve. To you. I seriously can’t wait to get in there. To soap you up, to have you soap me up. Really take our time, touch you everywhere. I wanna open you up Steve, and take you apart. Show you how good it feels, to be in control, to take what you want...”
If Tony was thinking of stepping back from the Avengers before, he goes into semi-retirement. He’s on-hand for their tech needs, or strategy for big picture stuff, but beyond that his days are full developing new advances for SI, taking on a larger role with the Maria Stark Foundation, getting BARF out there to the masses and of course, Morgan.
Tony interrupts, "I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You'd better pack it up and get out of here. Get lost, Squidward!"
Steve moves to take Tony’s hands from where they are resting on his hips and tugs them so they’re up on the pillow. He entwines their fingers and re-settles his weight over Tony’s body, pressing his hands down over Tony’s pinning them to the pillow above his head. Steve kisses Tony slow and deep, holding his arms firmly but carefully in place.
Tony’s mouth is watering as he smooths a new soap on his favorite loofa. It’s got little gel beads running throughout it every half inch or so. The gel is slightly cool to the touch in the warmth of the shower and the gel bumps provide a unique massaging sensation when applied with the right pressure.
As far as Tony knows nothing demonstrable has changed, for Steve or himself. So why is he coming here now?
But the truth is he can’t concentrate because his wet dream of a boyfriend is making him the best he can be with his magic cock. And Tony has a fantasy that keeps coming to mind over and over, to the point that he can’t even see straight.
he think that? Steve has already done just that. He let him eat his ass on his knees and Tony wasn’t hard at all. And Steve didn’t even notice, didn’t care. He was only thinking about himself. What if Tony didn’t even
Steve expels a blast of air through his nose and composes himself. “Tony… these communicators were supposed to be for official Avengers comms…”
Tony pauses the opening scene. “You know Nebula, it’s almost always part of a traditional Earth sleepover to take care of bodily repairs and upgrades.”
Tony is shaking above him as he pulls out and leans heavily onto Steve’s kneeling form. They stay like that for several minutes, just slowly breathing, Tony draped against Steve, letting his superior strength support him.
Steve settles into the rolling chair again and rolls up to the edge of the table between Tony’s legs. He presses on his knees again, more firmly this time. “Please keep your legs apart Mr. Stark.”
Tony almost squawks, but holds it in. Steve has lifted him fully off the bed, supporting him with his arms at Tony’s back and ass. They’re still connected, Steve flush against him. Tony looks at Steve’s face to see it unyielding in concentration. Tony goes to lean forward, to wrap his arms around Steve, and drop his legs down but Steve stops him.
Most of them are just passageways that have reinforced rooms fifty feet or so below ground-level. The rooms have communications equipment that is hard-wired and connected to mini arc-reactor generators, food enough for four people for two weeks and a variety of weapons. The entire system is built to sustain a nuclear blast, and honestly Tony kind of forgot to tell the rest of the team about it. Maybe he subconsciously liked being the only one to know it was down there, something deep inside still not fully trusting anyone but himself.
“Ah!” says Steve as he leans forward to grasp the handholds, sticking his ass out even further toward Tony’s waiting mouth. Yeah.
the mind stone. And Vision has an adorable budding relationship with Wanda. So finding them, not hard).
He makes his way through a familiar hallway which only has muted emergency lighting on the floor, the kind you’d see in an airplane. At the end of the hall is the elevator that connects directly to the Avenger’s levels, the executive Stark Industries floors, even Tony’s penthouse. The area around the elevator is lit more brightly and looks like it belongs in a four-star hotel. Steve always thought it was very Tony that a secret elevator that only the Avengers would see is still decked out with ornate trim, decorative lighting and sleek finishings. The way the hall and elevator are laid out there’s no chance of seeing any of it out on the street. It’s just fancy for the sake of it; it probably cost more than most people’s cars to decorate this secret entrance that hardly anyone will ever see.
Tony pauses. “Huh, okay we’ll send you the paperwork to act as an independent consultant. You can still call SI/The Avengers clients once you guys are up and running.” Tony clicks a few more things on the pad and sets it aside, sipping his coffee.
Steve exchanges a glance with Tony that very clearly says “Let’s do this.” Is there anything Steve doesn’t just throw himself into? It makes Tony feel a little invincible.
Steve nods. “Okay good, we can proceed and I’ll work to avoid that area... for now.” As he says it the thrusting resumes. The same regular pattern from before.
“So good, Steve. I’m going to use my mouth now. You earned it. And you can come as soon as I Iet go of your cock okay?”
He pulls his lips into his mouth before answering, “I think I’d like to hear what the other options are?”
- Tony and Steve reunite after their month+ separation. At first they need to play it cool since the whole team is around.
Steve moan-cries into Tony’s mouth. Pressing his mouth closer to get more of Tony’s lips, and his ass out to get more friction on Tony’s finger.
It's a testament to how much he trusts Tony that he can acknowledge that to himself, let alone tell Tony about it. He knows he has to say something.
If he can pull this off he should qualify for superhuman status right alongside Captain fucking America.
Steve, the reason I want you is to take all this longing and admiration and incredible passion I have for you, and reflect it back to you. To show you we’re in this together, that you’re not alone.”
Tony for all the patience he’s shown up until now has had enough. His now-free hands grab Steve’s errection and he pumps him roughly. As usual the precum Steve has leaked provides more than enough lubrication. Steve is shocked by the sudden touch, hard firm strokes that feel similar to how he treats himself when he’s alone. But he’s not by himself, and seeing Tony limp from his own orgasm, face set in determination, working him over with both hands is enough to set him off. He shoots long white ropes of cum all over Tony’s chest, some gets up onto his neck and even into his facial hair. Oh god.
Steve uses the comms to tell everyone at once, “This is no good, they just keep coming. We need to figure out how to actually stop them. Look around for anything that seems different or out of place.”
, ring pops!” says Quill. “I almost forgot those were a thing. Drax, when we finish with Thanos we should swing by Terra and get some Earth candy. I hope they still have pop rocks!”
Nebula looks at Shuri for confirmation. Shuri shrugs, but when Tony catches her eye, nods in agreement. “Ah yes, I have heard of that. It is… an essential part of the bonding process. Upgrades, of course.”
Motherfucker. Has this whole lead up been a tease? Is Steve trying to get him to beg? Ask and you shall receive.
He takes Tony’s legs and hauls them up to rest on his chest and over his shoulders, aligning his cock with Tony’s entrance. He presses slightly and is surprised when the head pops right in through the first ring of muscle. Oh god.
It’s not fair of him to take that step if he isn’t sure, no matter how much Becky assures them they are taking things slow and “keeping it casual.”
The next morning he calls a team meeting, and nobody seems surprised when he says he’s leaving. He’s not even sure he’s making sense, but at the end of his speech he closes with “… I’m sorry to leave you all. I hope you can understand. I just need to see him.”
Sometimes they aren’t about Siberia at all. It’s something from his past, or somewhere he’d never even seen before, but it always comes back to Tony. And not the Tony he remembers, or anything based in reality because oh god… Steve can barely think about it without flushing. These dreams about Tony are, for lack of a better term… explicit.
"Okay, so Thanos is... Managed." hedges Tony. "What about the army outside? Or hell, the whole mess of beings that are probably gonna come after the stones next?" Tony questions the group, arms raised.
“See Cap? Totally under control! In a couple weeks it’ll be like it never happened at all.” His voice is tight, and falsely bright, and it sounds just like it did the first time Steve talked to him after his break up with Pepper.
“Oh you know, just arriving at the Avengers compound, shaking Iron Man’s hand, about to negotiate the terms of my status as a team member… really boring, normal stuff.” Scott knows his grin is a bit manic; he hopes his hand isn’t sweaty.
Tony knows Whirl-turd is still out there, but he takes a second to pull Steve to him, almost crushing him under the strength of the armor and his own fear.
Steve tunes it out and concentrates on what’s in front of him. Having his hands grounded on the hammer allows him to focus, but it also makes maneuvering the way he wants more difficult. Finding the right angle and the best leverage to take Tony in deeply starts to bring him out of the safe floaty feeling, so he gives up and moves off the shaft with a final suck in favor of slowly gliding his mouth and tongue against whatever’s closest.
Steve slips off his slacks and folds them over a nearby chair, leaving him in just his boxers and t-shirt before pulling back the covers and getting in. He slides over to the side without the Stark pad (which he assumes is the side Tony prefers), and leaves the duvet pulled back, resting his head up on his hand, arm bent at the elbow. After a beat he pats the empty space next to him indicating for Tony to join him.
He turns to Rocket who has opened a holo-screen and from what Tony can see, he’s is trying to hack him. “That’s true, nano-tech is pretty useless, unless you’ve solve for the degradation, and implement nanocrystal casings. Which I have. My nanites will outlive us all.”
He leans forward to take Tony in again, but a firm grip on his hair stops him. Tony’s holding as much of it as he can at the top-back of his head, where a woman might wear a ponytail.
Steve had vague plans of prostrating himself before Tony, doing or saying something so sincere that Tony wouldn’t have time to get his hackles up. Something to make him understand that Steve really, truly wants to fix things. But now he’s here, and all he’s said amounts to “yeah let me in, cause I wanna talk to him.”
After the (catered) meal, they’re enjoying pleasant conversation among desert and coffee when Pepper takes a deep breath. “So I know it’s a little unusual for us to have dinner at my place. I actually had something I wanted to ask you two.”
“I figure he’ll be the easiest. He practically worships you, and if we tell him to keep a lid on it for a couple of days while we catch the rest of the team up, he will.”
Steve is on edge now, shamelessly thrusting back against Tony’s hand. “I’d dream of you. You fucking me, touching me, fingering me open, putting me on my knees. Sucking you off, fucking you, you blowing me, god Tony… Can’t stop thinking about you, only you.”
With a new Captain taking over the team, Steve is able to spend as much time with Tony and Morgan as he wants. He is still on-hand to help train or mentor various team members as they come along, especially Peter, who he and Tony try to see at least once a week.
in his mid-forties. He’d made his peace with getting older a few years ago, he’s happy where he is… but the image of him now, as he
“Um… congratulations?” Wait, what if they really do know he was in the suite and that he saw them? Friday is super advanced… Is this a trap? A test of his moral metal? He grits his teeth and prays what he’s about to do isn’t the stupidest move he’s ever made (which would really be saying something).
“What I’m saying is, at this point in my life I would like to have a child, and when I think of who the perfect person is to do that with… it’s Tony.”
Almost echoing Tony’s same thought, Steve says “I don’t know what I’m going to do; how am I ever going to lead a meeting again? I get hard at the drop of a hat around you.” He snuggles into Tony to punctuate his words with affection.
“I know. I know” says Tony, but he’s still sliding toward Steve on his knees, and now there’s less than a foot between them.
He lets out a little gasp as Steve looms over him, running his hands slowly over his knees up to his thighs, still so gentle.
“Tony Stark? Steven Rogers? I’m Doctor Stephen Strange, and I need you to come with us. It’s not over-selling it to say the fate of the universe is at stake.”
“Of course I want you! How could I not want you Steve?!” He huffs a breath and continues, “You’re this island of solid fucking rock in the middle of a rushing river and everything just seems to slide past you – I don’t know how you do it; I never can. You’re the best thing in my life right now, maybe ever, and you’re so beautiful it hurts. Of course I
“Who’s on Cap?” Tony demands into the comms as he blasts away from the grateful mother without a word. The buildings have blocked his view and he didn’t see where Steve landed.
Fuck. Steve is Steve again. Steve Steve. And Tony just told him he wants to marry him. Tony wracks his brain to see if there is a way to play this off as part of their roleplay. He wants to marry Steve, yes. In fact, he’s already made him his ring. But he definitely hadn’t planned on asking him until they’d been together longer. A year from the reunification had been his vague plan. A trip somewhere. Make it special…
Steve swallows and nods, unable to say anything. They walk back to the compound, and after a few minutes he mutters, “When?”
And, maybe it gives him a little thrill, this rug representing something about his past with Pepper, having Steve on it now blowing him… all stuff Steve doesn’t need to worry about…
“No. You have to stay like this Tony.” Steve is on his knees in the center of the bed, holding Tony to him ass-first. Tony’s legs are still up against Steve’s torso running up past his shoulders. Tony can’t move comfortably at all, all he can do is lean back into Steve’s arms, which are acting as a brace keeping him at a 45 degree angle.
As the hole in the conversation made by Tony drags on, whatever was holding Steve back suddenly disappears and he’s talking again without really planning or thinking at all. All he knows is that he has to say something to get that blank look off of Tony’s face. “When I heard about the accident,” he begins, voice dropping low, “I had to come. And it wasn’t because I’m the leader of the Avengers, or because I thought you might cause an international incident… I had to come because you were hurt, and you were far away, and I needed to see you. I can’t keep ignoring this thing we’ve been doing. I can’t ignore that you are someone… I… someone I…”
Steve must be more sleep deprived than he thought. He’s pretty sure he didn’t say anything about Bucky. Just how important this was, and how he can’t focus on anything else until this is done… oh… he must not have mentioned Tony either.
“Steve!” Interrupts Thor. “We gladly accept your invitation to the sushi restaurant.” Thor wraps his gruesome-looking arm around Rocket and goes on “What time should we be ready to accompany you?”
He looks at Tony, who is waiting as patiently as he can with his fists still glued to the wood of the headboard.
Steve pulls Tony close into a tight embrace, rolling his body to press against Tony's slighter form. He struggles to resolve all the stressful emotions he associated Tony a few months ago, hell, even less than 36 hours ago with the surging gratitude he feels now. How could he ever have doubted him?
He can’t even show Steve a nice day on the beach. His hands start to shake. He can’t make anything work.
“Oh, umm, yeah I mean we don’t even have like, letterhead… yet! And I think the paperwork is still going through for us to form the LLC?” Scott is dying. He was just offered up the golden goose of clients on a platter and he can’t take the work because he doesn’t have a real company yet!
And he’s come out the other side… still pissed. He gets that Bucky was brainwashed. That was probably the easiest thing to move on from. He gets that Steve didn’t want evil government overlords babysitting them. With the benefit of time and hindsight, Tony understands Steve’s side as much as he can, but there’s one thing he can’t get over.
“I was thinking that too,” says Steve, smiling warmly. “You don’t need to have Friday call up anything. I just wanted to check. I recorded that damn safe sex PSA enough times. Can’t be a hypocrite, right?”
Tony squeezes his hands so hard that Steve is sure it would hurt if he didn’t have the serum. As it is, it’s a nice firm feeling, grounding him.
He puts Tony’s bags in the biggest room on the second floor with the deck overlooking the beach and places his one duffle bag in a room down the hall (which also has a view of the beach, but no deck). After he’s put his clothes away he heads for Tony’s room and knocks on the door.
Bucky takes over the Captain America mantel for a while, then it passes to Sam. Steve volunteers at several veteran organizations and takes an active role in a variety of social justice causes. He snickers in delight as Bucky and Sam answer the call to create new government PSAs.
Bruce sighs. “I guess not.” He motions to his un-transformed body. “I - I’ll be on the comms if you need any research… sentient plant, maybe I can find something if it’s similar to any known flora?”
Tony says "Sure thing," blows a kiss to his friend and waits, bouncing on his heels slightly. He’s not nervous, more excited. Maybe a little nervous that Rhodey will say something to scare Steve off since he won’t know he’s just out of frame. Rhodey knows more about his past relationships with men than anyone, and he’s seen some things that aren’t exactly pretty. But Tony’s been transparent these last few months about Steve stepping up and making things right. Rhodey never held Steve responsible for things going to shit really, it’ll be alright.
They have not talked about Bucky beyond Tony briefly absolving him over his role in his parent’s death, saying he “gets that Hydra are a bunch of brainwashing dicks.” He'd compared how he felt about Bucky now with how he'd come around to Wanda.
Next up, things get explicit with you guessed it, more shower sex! (See Whatever It Takes the first story in this series to understand Tony's high-tech shower).
Steve runs one hand more purposefully over the plug, his other grasping Tony’s ass and squeezing. He swallows.
“Steve, what we’ve gotten through in the last few hours alone goes a long way to fixing everything, honestly. So if you’re asking if I need something else to forgive you, to move forward, I can’t think of anything. What, were you thinking of something?”
That does sound nice, it’s been a long night… but, Steve actually feels really good. The sleep on the plane recharged him and now his days and nights are a bit flipped. And, well, he’s hard as steel and sleeping like this with Tony next to him probably isn’t happening.
In response to his words Tony can feel a spurt of precum leak out of Steve's ever-hardening cock against his belly.
Steve has gently taken Tony’s ass in his two massive hands and tilted Tony’s exposed hole up to his mouth. Just an experimental brush of his tongue over the area. Soft and gentle.
For dessert the night after the story breaks, Scott brings out a cake with the best kiss photo printed on it in icing. The team has a good laugh at his practical joke (plus, cake!).
He stopped trying to decode any sort of meaning in these dreams weeks ago. They all start with some riddle or mysterious mash-up of people, places and things, only to shift to Tony. Tony and him, and the rest falls away.
He should probably have a Vibranium-level Stark-card made for Steve so he can come back here whenever he wants.
Steve leaves the bathroom in a bit of a daze. He makes his way across the penthouse to what he assumes is the bedroom, enters and takes a deep calming breath. It’s a large room, and the bed is huge. Seeing the bed sets his mind in motion, he focuses. He’s going to concentrate on giving Tony what he wants, give him the focused care he’s given Steve so freely all evening.
Thanos, delirious from pain and shock at his defeat simply slumps over, bound by Wanda’s magic and the entire remaining contents of Peter’s web shooters.
After they tell Scott, Tony and Steve are still on the sofa in the living area. Tony sits up and smacks his hand up to his forehead. “Oh god, I need to call Rhodey!”
“I told you, you’d die for that.” He sneers, pushing the axe deeper and then ripping it from his chest. Thanos' purple blood spraying across the Wakadan landscape.
And he really, really doesn’t know what to do now, because they are making their way to his bedroom (‘I want some time to think… show me your bed’). Seriously, what the fuck even is he supposed to do here?
Steve thought the biggest change after getting the go-ahead from Bruce would be their sex life. But this whole thing seems like it has finally caught up with Tony. While they’re having just as much sex as they ever did (if not more, and once again without condoms), a shift in their relationship takes place that Steve did not anticipate.
Steve knows this should be the breaking point. Going to Hawaii with Tony is pretty much crossing a line. Hawaii is romantic, and they’ve spent so much time skirting the issue already.
“I’m going to touch you” this time stronger, more direct. More like Steve right on the cusp of Captain America.
They’d even recklessly started something in the kitchen the other day just before Scott arrived back at the compound. The only thing that prevented him from walking in to see Tony’s hand down Steve’s pants was the proximity alarm Tony set up with Friday. She warned them with enough time to put themselves together and hastily start a pot of coffee.
He’s lost track of time; he should get out. The smooth granite isn’t especially forgiving on his knees anyway.
Although nobody is fighting Thor, he pleads his case. “Who else, here, has the power of a god? Who else has lost so much? I am alive, because fate wants me alive. If I am to die after 1,500 years, then let it be in the service of my people, my family, my friends.”
Tony rubs a hand over his mouth. Jesus, Steve liberated a concentration camp, and it kind of shaped his world-view... What can he say to that? So he says nothing.
Steve’s eyes go wide, “Oh wait Tony, did you just propose in the middle of our kinky roll-playing sex scene?!”
Tony and Steve reunited in Japan, where Tony is still recovering from a post-Pepper-break-up-binge/car accident. Tony has asked Steve to go to Hawaii with him for some R & R and hula girl fun (*cough*). Steve has a girlfriend he has not told Tony about.
“At this time Wanda and I would like to officially announce our relationship, though much like Tony and Steve’s courtship, I believe everyone is already aware?”
He doesn’t understand why. Why now? The war, losing Bucky, going down into the ice and losing Peggy, New York, finding Bucky again, Sokovia… after each one, night after night he was able to escape into calm nothingness.
Tony makes a partially aborted wave of his hand toward the toy baskets. “Hey, yeah sorry this probably looks like a lot! But this isn’t, I mean, it doesn’t have to be… we can do as much or as little as you want.”
Bruce occupies himself with gathering up soiled gauze and dressings, and sterilizing his equipment. Steve doesn’t say anything, but he doesn’t leave either. He focuses on cleaning, silently hoping that Steve will follow Tony’s lead and exit the lab. It’s not that he isn’t sympathetic to the Captain’s situation… which he really knows more about than he should thanks to Nat.
“Sam,” Steve says into their communicators before they’re out of range, “Fly back to the sanctum with Bruce, assemble the team with Wong, I’m betting Wong and Strange will be able to communicate even if we are in space. We’ll be in touch.”
“… it doesn’t have to be that way. You don’t always have to be the one taking on the world. You think it’s on you? It’s not. Allow someone else to take the burden, to be in control. You’ll feel so free, without its crushing pressure at your back...”
Steve looks up at Tony with a gentle smile. “That’s understandable, but I assure you the procedure is almost completely pain-free. I’ll be performing it here in the office, and it shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours.”
improve the formula to adapt to the elements and provided a few-“ Tony goes on about Spiderman’s web-shooters for a few minutes until Natasha straight up just gets up to leave.
He takes a closer look at Steve’s foot and sees that it is indeed very pink and tender looking. “What were you thinking? Couldn’t you feel that it was hot?”  Tony is suddenly so angry, so angry that once again something that was supposed to be good, something that was supposed to make things better has backfired and it’s his fault. Again.
Tony rolls his eyes but moves to sit opposite Bruce, pulling a stool around the other side of the lab table. He leaves enough room for Steve to pull up another next to him, which he does.
Damn it. Tony has been staring blankly at the screen lost in thought. He addresses Friday and refocuses on the floating display. “Ask him why he’s here.”
“Steve, you’re so beautiful” Tony says, and Steve almost laughs, because Tony’s head is still bowed, and he is definitely talking to Steve’s errection. The laughter dies immediately though, when Steve hears what Tony says next.
Tony examines the orb and notices a small button at the bottom. “I see a button, but it could be a decoy or trap. Cap what’s the call?”
Tony can’t even respond, he’s half hard again and braces against the stirrups to thrust his ass at Steve is a silent plea.
Steve isn’t sure what Tony’s expecting of him. Earlier by the elevator it was all so overwhelming, but now that he’s been on the receiving end of Tony’s attention for two orgasms, he thinks he gets it. He gets how to go about taking the lead.
Tony looks like Christmas morning (if Christmas morning hadn’t slept in five days). “Warm, and smooth, but not wet!” he explains, rubbing his hands together. “I developed some new polymers for her body and tongue. Even the ears are extra soft!”
“I…” Steve pauses in abject horror realizing that in his haste to get here, combined with his unplanned sleep on the plane he hasn’t actually prepared anything to say.
They manage to eject Squidward and pilot the ship to Titan. Steve backs Tony’s play to meet Thanos on his own turf. New York has been a battle ground enough times in recent years. With all of them working together, Steve is hopeful they can stop Thanos here, now, before he gets any more stones.
He really needs to clear this up with Tony, he knows. And he can’t keep not bringing up Becky because it might make Tony feel bad because of Pepper, or because he’s hurt… or because he wants to spend time in Hawaii with Steve.
“Okay, so don’t be mad! Part of X-Con Security Consultants’ services is to basically break in, that is, test the client’s space as if we were really breaking in. I call it, a
Steve considers that sleep deprivation and dream conditioning may be playing a role here, but that doesn’t really feel like an explanation. It’s more that his dreams have been helping him work through some pretty heavy demons… he can’t deny that these dreams have been pushing him closer and closer to something. Something he didn’t allow himself to think about when he was actually around Tony day-to-day. Tony had Pepper, and Steve… Steve never truly let go of the past. Even with Sharron he’d been holding back. Part of him knowing whatever they had was just a nice placeholder because no matter what he did he would always be a man out of time.
and it makes Tony’s teeth ache. He wants to tease Steve about those cheesy educational videos he’s made for the US Departments of Education and Health, but doesn’t want to break the mood.
Steve looks like he wants to die. He is beet-red. “Friday, why didn’t you tell me Tony was on the phone and had a vid-screen up?!”
Sleep is no longer an escape, so he tries to get by on the bare minimum. It’s bad enough that he can’t stop thinking about Tony and the whole situation during the day, but seeing his guilty conscience strung through this awful dreamscape night after night is slowly driving him insane.
Steve’s eyes crinkle at the corners. “We’re really looking forward to hearing your security assessment at the end of the week, but we actually just wanted to talk to you on a personal level for a minute.”
After what seems like just a moment and somehow many hours the thumb is removed and the gauntlet slips around the back of his head to cup the base of his skull. Tony moves closer, the groin of the suit only a few inches from Steve’s now wet mouth.
Also! I believe all we know at this point in “1796 Broadway”  is that Becky has slept over, so I am taking that and creating my own headcannon where that doesn’t mean full on sex… because reasons. No disrespect meant to the original story, or purposeful misreading meant.
Tony continues, “So Yeah, the idea of you taking me while I can’t come, while I just lay there and let you use my body (with both of us consenting and knowing full-well it’s more than that), is so fucking hot I can hardly believe I’m not hard. In fact, I am having like, phantom limb pain but for erections? A phantom erection? Like I
Tony rubs his fingers under the underside of his chin. “I’d say a year ago, once I came, I was done for the night, or day. Basically one and done. Lately two organisms in a few hours is no problem. With enough time I can get to three. Steve remember on the 4th of July when we-“
Tony, Scott and Peter all start talking at once. Eventually Tony is able to yell above them to be heard by the group: “Hold on, team emergency! Who here has
The thing Tony is most proud of however, is the exam table. It’s an actual doctor’s exam table, top of the line. Atop it is a crinkly paper cover, and a hospital gown.
He notices Steve is awake and moves immediately to put the pad aside. He sets it on the bedside table, next to… oh.
Steve smiles up at him as he brings his hands to rest on Tony’s angular hipbones. His head is still leaning back against the stone, like he can’t be bothered to lift it. Hmm maybe they really are done for the night.
Tony goes pale, and then flushes. “Um, you said it’s like I’m getting microdoses of super soldier DNA?”
Tony scoops Steve up and flies him back in the direction of the chaos. “Yeah well, you try making top-tier jokes when someone you more-than-love is in danger.”
“Tony! Are you alright?” Steve is scrambling to keep him upright and examine him at the same time. He looks to the team for help,
He stands and holds out a hand to Tony. “Sam made me realize even a day or two is vital at this point. Are you up for one more shower? I looked and there’s a flight out to the airport closest to Wakanda at midnight. I can make it if I leave in an hour.”
He’d be embarrassed, but wouldn’t leave. He’d watch Tony for a whole minute, frozen, not sure what to do. Tony wouldn’t break the rules. He wouldn’t ask Steve to join him, he’d just look at him through the glass, taking in Steve’s beautiful fucking form, and parted, shocked lips until he couldn’t help but gasp “Steve.”
He finishes cleaning Steve’s legs and considers Steve’s angry cock bobbing above him. “I think we’ve come to a fork in the road Steve. I have a couple of options for you.”
He turns to Steve, who is white as a sheet. “Hey, why the face? We don’t know anything yet, it’ll be fine.”
Steve is so hard it hurts. He can’t tell if he wants to come or not. Tony said he could. He probably should. Since his dreams started, he’s found it difficult to come just once. Usually it takes two or three times for his body to finally calm down.
Steve tries to tell him, “But you’re not… it doesn’t feel right that I’m getting off and you’re not. I get that maybe you don’t
But no, Steve doesn’t regret saying it. It’s the truth. He looks right back at him, he's not afraid.
Tony’s mouth waters as he looks at Steve hard and glistening in front of him. His errection is obscene, sticking out of Steve’s pants while the rest of him is still totally buttoned up and professional. Tony takes a mental picture of it, Steve in his glasses and lab coat and khakis, cock weeping. Fuck, he'll be thinking about this image for years.
Tony dismisses the screen, grabs himself a bottle of water and leans against the bar where he can see the elevator clearly.
Steve does exactly that, his gloved fingers gently part Tony’s cheeks and brush over his hole. “Do you have any discomfort in the area?” he asks, sounding so professional and unaffected that Tony wants to cry. He shifts up on his elbows on the table, backing up slightly to allow his erection to hang freely.
He’s nervous. Jesus he hasn’t been nervous to have sex since… well maybe the last time he did this? It really has been 20 years. He said it to shock Steve, but now he wonders if he told him so he’d know what a big deal it is.
about a security test would defeat the purpose… he opens his report in his pad and suggests a solution - a quarterly team building event where everyone leaves the compound for the afternoon. That way he has an opportunity to conduct a security review with everyone out, and Friday will be none-the-wiser. Plus he can probably attend most of them, a yearly check should be enough for a place as secure as the compound.
"With all six stones, I could snap my fingers and they would all cease to exist. I call that, mercy."
Tony’s brain is blanking out. Not only is hot doctor Steve going to fuck him, he’s going to control when Tony can come.
So I thought this would be one chapter but it looks like the shower will last two, possibly three chapters. What is my life?
But the thought of Steve injecting his hard cock into him in a clinical environment won’t leave his brain no matter how much he tries to move on. Tony knows himself, and once his brain latches on to something, there’s no stopping it until he makes it a reality. It’s why he’s Iron Man.
He draws up his courage to look them in the face. Tony looks a little amused. Steve looks like he wants to crawl into a hole, his head in his hands.
Tony suspects that this whole thing is playing into Steve’s need to control and protect. Taking every step one at a time, checking in to see how Tony is feeling. No wonder he jumped at this.
Vision cocks his head. “If you’re asking how much of the AI Jarvis is present in my consciousness, it is difficult to explain. Often I will think of something, I believe it is similar to the human mind recalling a memory. A conversation we had, or an event that was pivotal to the AI Jarvis’ sense of self. I do not consciously think of all the experiences they had throughout the course of their existence, but they are there in the background, shaping who I am.”
“Okay, sorry about that. Man, I love the Air Force, but I’m starting to look forward to knocking out the last of this tour and enjoying retirement.”
Steve just wants to stay there quietly enjoying the warm cocoon of a bed, lazing with Tony in their own little world. But instead he sighs and says, “We probably need to talk about the team, the accords… next steps.”
When they were in a relationship she always seemed to keep her calm professional demeanor, even when it was just the two of them. Probably thought she could lead by example for him or something.
He picks up one of the fancy forks to have something to do with his hands. “I know, okay? I know how insane this seems from the outside. Hell, it is from the inside too. And yes, I plan to talk to Rhodey. We actually just decided we are telling him and the rest of the team soon.”
sure you have suffered a blow to the head, or are brainwashed, or god, maybe you actually think that I’m
Yes, he is capable of going off the rails (quite literally as he just did in Japan). And he can be self-centered and irresponsible…
Thanks to everyone who took the time to read this! Please let me know if you see any errors or have any feedback, this is un-beta'd.
Tony is about to fall asleep when it happens. Something bothers Tony, every once in a while. A persistent thought he can't shake, usually while he is boneless and close to sleep. He never brings it up with Steve, it feels too terrifying to even name.
After coming a second time, Steve leans forward and kisses Tony between his shoulder blades. It breaks their illusion for a moment, but Tony doesn’t mind.
Steve can’t help but smile at it. He thought Tony would make something that looked like the armor. Sleek and intimidating. But, this is… well, cute. Really cute. It looks like some kind of mutt, with a slightly overly-large head that comes up past Steve’s knees.
Steve’s head spins a little. There’s a little twinge, but it’s not bad. More like the feeling when you stretch out a sore muscle. It’s good.
The entire team is there, plus the Guardians, Nebula, Strange, Wong and Bucky. T'Challa and his senior guard round out the group surrounding Thanos, a righteous judgement council.
“This is not funny, Tony. What if we are called away from each other for a long period of time before we figure this out? What if this really harms you? I need you to take this seriously!” Steve is red again, but this time it’s in anger.
Remarkably, Steve feels better. Until now he hasn’t handled things well, but he can move forward and do better.
. Taking his ass and raising it up while holding his mouth and tongue in place stiffly above him. Up and down. Lifting most of Tony’s body up to his mouth over and over. Tony’s pelvis is being moved like a buffet platter Steve is licking clean. He moves Tony in little circles to swirl him around and around.
He turns to Thor who is looking quite pleased with what looks like a severely mangled arm, complete with exposed bone and spurting blood.
“Of course, of course I will talk you through everything Steve, you know me, I’d narrate paint drying.” It’s a bad joke, but Steve manages a smile because he knows Tony is just trying so hard to make him comfortable.
Tony is just laying back, exhausted. He looks like some kind of classical Roman painting. Beautiful. Steve's warm ejaculate makes it easy as he carefully extracts himself.
Steve pistons his fingers in and out with more pressure, stretching, sliding, trying to find that sensitive place…
Tony and Steve continue to sit in silence. Tony, running through the immense gravity of what Pepper is suggesting. Steve, wrapping his head around frozen eggs, modern science, and working out that chances are 99.9% that what Pepper is suggesting will happen in a lab or a hospital, and she’s not suggesting, well, the traditional method.
And now Tony is hurt and they’re saying he refused to see Medical and Becky has already text him about what his plans are for dinner and he feels sick even though that’s physiologically impossible now.
It seems insane how well-matched they are. Tony doesn’t believe in fate or anything like that, he’s a scientist. But it's just so statistically unlikely that he could find Steve, and for Steve to feel the same way. And for them to have been at such odds with one another and still find themselves here, now, snuggling on his sofa. As much as he hates to admit it, maybe some things exist outside of science.
Tony isn’t even watching the movie; he’s just curled up against Steve with this blissed out look on his face. Peter sneaks a subtle photo.
Tony is ready. He plans to lead with how insanely happy he is, how there’s no doubt in his mind. Rhoedy just wants him to be happy. It’s going to be fine.
Tony speaks first “Okay, so, this is it. The big bad, bigger than anything we've seen before. How do we stop him? What’s our timeline?”
Steve is pulled out of his reverie when Tony literally pulls him into the open-air stall. It’s a big space, larger than one or even six people really need. There are about 10 nozzles and showerheads coming out from multiple directions, but they blend seamlessly with the design. Steve admires the aesthetic, though it’s a bit modern for his tastes. All sleek chrome and expensive-looking deep gray stone.
“Oh Steve. Okay, what I want… first I want to be very clear and reiterate that I am insanely turned on, and have been all night. Again, the spirit is willing, but the body… That said, I actually kind of get off on the idea of you fucking me while I’m soft? I know I just gave you a pretty speech about the deeper meaning of sex, but sometimes… things are just fucking hot.”
What will Steve choose haha... Thanks for reading everyone, this has a mind of its own I swear, things ramp up next chapter as I'm sure you've guessed from that cliffhanger.
Tony feels his cock twitch, but he isn’t anywhere near hard. Doing all that to Steve was as arousing as anything he’s ever done, but he just came less than an hour ago. And unlike some people he’s not a thirty-year-old super soldier with unlimited erections.
The next week he meets up with one Reed Richards, who claims to be an expert on the multiverse. Because, well, it never hurts to just look into things… just to see.
Tony makes both Bucky and Thor new arms. Many jokes are made about them being the one-arm-wonder-twins. Bucky tries to insist that the arm he got in Wakanda is fine, great even. Tony won’t hear of it, and after Steve tells him to just go with it, he acquiesces.
He's so wrapped up in what Tony is saying it feels like it hits him out of no-where. He just lets go, still fully encased in Tony. Tony babbles through it, egging him on. Finally when he's done, he rests his forehead for a moment in the cradle of Tony’s neck and shoulder.
Bruce feels useless until Tony tells him Friday is picking up some kind of micro-spore on the suit that came off of the plant. When the team returns, Bruce leads the decontamination procedure for them to re-enter the compound. He also takes several samples of the spore, and a sample of each team member’s blood for analysis (except Vision, who doesn’t have blood… Bruce really should set up a time to better understand what is going on there…).
He stands in front of Tony and slides both palms up the center of his chest. He doesn’t press, just holding them there over Tony’s heart. Steve leans down, laying light kisses along Tony’s beard and jaw. Down to his neck, along his clavicle. He pauses sliding his hands to look more closely at Tony’s chest, running his fingers over the jagged lines of scar tissue, like he’s memorizing it. Tony thinks about saying something about the scarring, but what is there to say? He knows Steve knows what the scars are from. He wonders if they are off-putting to him, but the way Steve is slowly caressing them, then kissing them, Tony already has his answer.
Steve looks up from Tony’s groin and into his eyes with unnerving calm as he moves forward a little bit, managing to look like some kind of jungle cat. He’s close now, close enough that he could reach out and touch Tony...
Steve rubs the back of his neck, he forgot. “Ah, yes so one more thing to know is that there is a code that will automatically stop all action. The code is “I heart New York.”
Steve rubs the worry line forming between Tony’s brows. “It’s really okay, I knew what I was signing up for. Honestly, I figured I’d be a lab rat for the rest of my life, but look at us now.” He smiles and Tony relaxes.
Probably because he can access SHEILD’s records and see that Steve has never been late for a debrief, let alone left in the middle of one.
Tony hands Steve his shield. A month ago Tony outfitted everyone on the team with their own compact canister filled with nanobots. It allows them all to keep their most vital gear on-hand easily in something the size of a lipstick tube. As a result Steve and Falcon had been able to instantly don their gear, but the Shield is one-of-a-kind and not something Steve can just carry around. He gives Tony a greatful smile for remembering it in what must have been a chaotic scramble.
Bruce spends two months after Thanos in one of Tony’s most isolated properties in the Alps. The Hulk has never just
Tony does a variety of tests, including a blood test, every day for the next two weeks. On day fifteen Bruce reconvenes with him and Steve to go over the results.
Steve snuggles back into Tony and grabs one of his hands to play with while he thinks. He doesn’t even know where to begin.
Tony throws the pad down on the bed and manages to beat Steve to the shower again, even though he knows the way this time.
Thor had on nothing but his cloak streaming behind him and Stormbreaker strategically placed in front of him.
Dr. Strange sighs, “The sparkly portals, we can use these rings to create them” he’s speaking slowly as if to children, “Tell us who you need and we can gather the rest of your team.”
“Well for bath stuff like that it’s usually at random,” Tony replies. “Honestly there isn’t a ton of difference when it comes to loofas and soaps. The best thing about this shower, is that it can change to accommodate the activities and preferences of the user. There’s a setting that creates a bathtub, one for nice soft floormats to appear wherever you want, platforms, seats, handrails… we could watch TV if we wanted.”
He can pretty much do whatever he wants, he just needs to keep an eye on Tony’s reactions. Lean into the things Tony seems to like and move on from anything that doesn’t get a strong reaction. It’s a lot like a fight, or an interrogation. Taking what you want and balancing that against what the other person wants. And Steve has about a million things he wants to do to Tony.
Steve dissolves into a series of incredibly charming giggles. Captain America, giggling. God Tony wants to record that sound and upload it to his private server. Turn it into a white noise machine setting. Maybe make it his ring-tone.
Tony’s exhaustion from their first round disappears as he moves down the table, eyeing the stirrups.
He turns to Tony. “And you’re obviously showing physical changes. So if you’re not purposely trying to alter yourself we need to figure out what the hell is happening.”
Finally, after being sequestered for five days straight, Tony emerges triumphant. He looks like absolute hell, but the team gathers around as a distinct dog-shape pads around from behind him.
“And Rocket! Don’t forget my small woodland friend, he wouldn’t miss this opportunity to experience sushi!”
There isn’t a lot of room in the workshop bathroom. Unlike the other bathrooms in the compound, it’s purely functional. A toilet, a sink, and a (comparatively) small walk-in shower. It’s meant to get the job done when Tony is on an all-night science bender so intense, he can’t even bother to go upstairs. It’s hardly been used, since every night he heads up to bed at a semi-reasonable hour to be with Steve.
Scott summarizes the visitation situation with Cassie. He also tells Tony about the side-gig for his new security company.
A month later Tony’s bloodwork has not changed, and they are in the clear. Bruce recommends Tony continue to get tested every couple of weeks to make sure nothing changes, and if nothing does eventually they can go down to testing once a month, and then not at all.
Steve can’t believe he’s agreed to this. Well, he can, because he’s scared and tense and pretty much the last thing he wants to do is jerk off into a little cup by himself.
“Thanks Steve, it’s great to hear that you regret nothing and that you’re right, as always. Good talk.” Tony begins to turn away.
That’s how they all end up in Tony’s workshop, adapting pieces of the armor and Tony’s nano tech to repair as much of the damage they can. Thanos inflicted untold horrors on Nebula's body over the years; turns out Shuri was right, repairing her is a crutial step to the bonding process.
The ground rumbles and terrain variations emerge up from the previously flat grass. Where there was once nothing but a lush field, there is now an entire mock-environment with boulders, hills, faux foliage. A couple of fake (but sturdy) light poles and even a few buildings emerge to complete the course.
Tony’s heart lurches a little bit, and he pulls Steve into a hug. Just holding him gently in the soothing warmth. He wants to wrap Steve up and protect him from the world. He wants to make Steve forget there’s anything remotely close to “bad stuff.”
And I can see she has almost no training, by the way. What she does shouldn’t be possible, she just, exudes raw power. Once this is over I will take her on as a student.”
Fuck. Tony hastily pulls on his most comfortable loungewear. It’s loungewear, so he knows it makes him look comfortable and like he doesn’t give a shit, but in a “billionaire who can afford $20,000 fuck-you loungewear” kind of way. Plus he’s pretty sure whatever is about to happen with Steve is going to suck some hulk-sized balls, so he might as well be as comfortable as humanly possible.
“Yeah I guess,” says Tony. “I think that must have been when Steve was on the other side of the world for that thing with the werewolf-people? Oh hey didn’t I have that week-long SI tech conference in California? But oh, yeah I flew home early from that…”
different shade of grey. She touches her ear, “Everyone rally to my location, I think I see the lead orb.”
Tony is talking now, mostly nonsense, but Steve makes out some of the words “Jesus… perfect, absolutely… couldn’t have asked for anything better, nothing… the best, most perfect, Steve oh my god… fucking perfect"
Tony retracts his finger in favor of tracing the rim. He circles Steve’s opening several times until the tip of his finger slips in again, continuing to circle, catching at the rim of Steve’s entrance, and gently stretching it. Round and round.
Wanda speaks first, “Natasha and I talk. I wondered why you were so different upon your return. Later I asked Viz about it too and he confirmed that Tony has always had, what do you call it, “The hots” for Steve?” She smiles and takes a drink of her sparkling water.
is his reaction to all this. He just winked! “Um, yeah, I think you’ll be pleased. I’ve been… thorough.”
Friday’s silence speaks volumes; he knows he has to say something else or he won’t even get past the ground floor. Panic wells up in him, his mind is blank. Even if Steve had some grand speech ready, now he can hardly speak, his throat closing up with a hundred emotions. So much pain and so much regret.
Which turns into Steve’s stomach growling and Tony insisting they go out to the kitchen and get him something to eat, because really with all the fluids he’s lost, plus not eating in like 24 hours he knows Steve must be getting hangry, and how can they possibly plan the Fate of the Avengers like that?
He lifts Tony up and down again, slightly faster, like the sight of Tony erect has loosened his iron control just a bit.
Tony keeps his distance. They don’t write each other. They see each other around the tower, and Tony is always friendly, but…
Steve knows he’s being reckless. Selfish. It’s the same rush he used to get when he was a ninety-five-pound weakling picking fights with jerks twice his size. Sure it was about standing up to bullies, but it was also a little bit about the thrill, that hot rush of knowing he was doing something truly reckless.
Noticed that I put in that Tony has the arc reactor, but that 1796 Broadway is set post Iron Man 3. Now fixed!
Tony runs his hands through his hair in frustration. He can’t tell if he’s being too needy or if Steve is being a stick in the mud. Either way he decides to get a move on the proceedings himself. If Steve wants to waste an hour on a run, Tony can a least save them some time by prepping himself.
He wants to yell at Steve. He wants to tell him that no matter how many interesting things she has to say about the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi Art Series, he bets she doesn’t know about Steve’s tallow lamp scar, or the chocolates Steve and Bucky got sick on. She hasn’t seen him in battle, or working so hard to build himself a new family every damn day. Sure, maybe she’s seen him kidding around with Thor some Sunday morning at breakfast with his hair all messy, laughing… but she didn’t see what it’s taken to get there from hitting bags ten hours a day, thinking about the fact that every single person he once cared about is gone.
This is one of Tony’s most ingenious additions to the compound. There are five different courses, with a ton of different training scenarios for each one. All of them are manned by Friday to be totally random, even Tony doesn’t know what’s coming. Each one has a specific challenge or challenger, and the team will have to work together to solve the issue/defeat the villain.
“I know this isn’t something to take lightly. The team, and the “us stuff.” I’m in this, Tony. All of it. Completely.”
Steve takes a moment to let those words sink in and continues. “And as for this” he motions to himself kneeling, “and this” he motions between himself and Tony, “are you telling me that it never occurred to you that part of the reason we used to butt heads so often is the ocean of sexual tension between us?”
Peter does a little fist pump into the air. “Awesome! Can I tell my friend Ned? He’s gonna owe me $20!”
Steve smiles a little at the ‘you and me’ part. Christ, Tony really wanted more time before they did this…
He should be thinking of the team. He should be calmly going over Tony’s unification plan and thanking whatever powers that be that things have gone as well as they have tonight.
He pauses to note that the trademark STARK name isn’t there either, which means Clint’s intel was probably accurate. Just last week he heard Tony was planning to sell the building and move The Avengers (such as they were) to a compound upstate. Maybe he already did, and the tower is empty, sold off to the highest bidder.
“I can’t sleep. I – for months, I haven’t been able to. I don’t know how you’ve been, I hope you’ve been okay.” Steve shakes his head, this isn’t what he wants to say.
In true Tony fashion he holds it in as long as he can, until there’s no way to stop it. He just says it one day as they are getting ready to go see some modern dance thing Wanda has insisted they all see as a group.
So, I didn't mean to pull a Return of the King, but every time I got to a stopping place, there was more I wanted to add! I think I originally planned to end it right after Thanos is defeated.
“’Witch’ is just a term that you people can understand that describes what she is and her power, which is
He gets up and holds out his hand to Steve. It’s a reflex, but he takes a second to reflect on how ridiculous it is that Steve would need to take his hand for help getting up off the sofa. He’s seen this man do a backflip off of a plane, onto another plane, while getting shot at and ricocheting his shield to take down a third plane.
It’ll probably never happen, but it’s a nice little dream. Cosy by the fire, maybe roast some marshmallows… a real dream about Tony, not what he’s had to cling to these last months. Him and Tony, together.
“Great, shower it is! And while we’re in there, we can take care of this.” Tony rolls his hips and abs to press against Steve, drawing attention to Steve’s erection (which Steve had been sort of angling away from Tony’s body during the start of their aborted attempt at the long-serious-talk-that-can-definitely-wait).
“Thank you.” Says Steve. But his tone is serious and doesn’t match Tony’s light one. They both know he’s thanking Tony for something else.
Tony’s hips jerk again, forcing his cock up against Steve’s ass, but the angle is wrong, so it just glances off.
Mercifully, Tony takes pity on him as soon as his decision is made, moving him immediately to turn around on the platform to face the wall.
“Jesus did you open yourself enough, you’re tight, shit…” Tony’s head thrashes as his hands slide around on the mattress, desperate to grab on to something.
He’d like to think he knows Steve a little better than he did before they were quarantined together. As hard as it is to believe, Steve really is as earnest as he seems, and based on Tony’s response to the news about Becky, Steve didn’t tell Tony about her.
Finally he makes his way into Stark’s suite. It’s about four-times bigger than where anyone else on the team is living, but Scott figures he deserves it. He’s not about to judge the guy who’s throwing free planes and security contracts at him.
“It’s not about you making the call Tony, it’s about me giving myself to you.” Steve turns Tony’s incredibly sappy words back on him with this little shit-eating smile that Tony wants to bite.
It hits him like a ton of bricks that he’s… happy. Just, totally happy in a care-free way he hasn’t felt in so long.
Steve’s mind is on fire, he didn’t get out what he wanted to say and now Tony is doing the exact thing he was hoping to stave off. His heart aches, realizing all the pain and fear he’s felt over the last few months probably pales in comparison to what Tony has been dealing with. Tony is about to shut down, or worse, make him leave. He has to do something.
But no one bats an eye, and after a week or so Steve comes to love Tony’s constant physical presence.
“Pepper, thank you for your concern. I know this has come as a shock, and again, I am so sorry you found out this way.” Good, good, that’s a good start. Really mature.
Tony mutters a command that sounds like “Activate Blue 3” and the walls shift. Two handholds/bars emerge and a small platform about a meter square raises in the center of the shower up against the longest wall beneath them. The platform looks like a mini-stage, only 6 inches higher than the rest of the shower floor. Two waist-height columns also slide out of the walls on either side of the platform to reveal two sets of shelves. Steve glances over the shelves to see they are stocked with sponges, washcloths, soaps, little tubes and creams and… and in the bottom shelf of each column there’s a basket which appears to be full of a variety of
Steve takes the last tube at hand and pours it over his cock as he talks, stroking himself to spread it around.
Tony’s mouth drops as he watches Steve slowly piston his cock back and forth through his own hand, spreading the lube and the precum.
Steve wants to tell Tony he feels the same way. He wants to tell him… something, but he stops himself. Does he love everything about Tony? He can’t seem to make the words come out. Tony can be impossible, and this whole thing still seems like a terrible idea half the time…
Tony leans forward and pauses, aware that not everyone loves the idea of kissing someone’s mouth that was just on their ass.
“Yes, doctor” Tony grunts out, just as Steve presses his cockhead inside. Tony still can’t get over how hot and wonderful Steve feels inside him. Six weeks of condoms has really given him a renewed appreciation for it, and he groans loudly as Steve fully seats himself inside, filling him.
Steve nods enthusiastically, feeling the full weight of how much more intense this is than any dream.
Each individual piece I write will have the explanation above, and a summary of what entry from “1796 Broadway” it is based on in the Notes section. I highly recommend you read “1796 Broadway,” even if epistolary isn’t something you usually go for (and also it will make what I write make much more sense, haha)!
to be free, but there’s only so much making out a 40-something billionaire can do without feeling a little ridiculous).
“Tony… what are you doing?? Do you have any idea how worried I’ve been about you just, just being Steve’s
Now that the team knows they are “working on a puzzle” it’s like they’ve been transported back to those two amazing days in the tower. Just them, nothing to interrupt or get in the way.
The please catches Tony’s attention. It’s already edging on a desperate, begging tone. Hmm, he may take pity on Steve and move things along… in a little while…
Another rinse and he’s ready for some lube. Steve lets out a pathetic noise as Tony stands to gather more supplies.
When Steve begins again, his voice is playful. “And I don’t know, maybe I can do something to make it up to you, like, hmm… do your laundry? Wash your car?”
all the way to Wakanda, and then on to your super-secret base of operations that I totally know the location of.”
“You’re doing so well Steve. I’m so close, and it looks like you are too.” It’s not a question. “You can have my cock back in your mouth as soon as you want, but you’ll have to do more than ask okay? Do you remember what you need to do?”
A noise escapes Tony in response, as he lets go of his harsh grip on Steve’s hair in favor of placing one hand on his broad shoulder for balance as the other combs gently through Steve’s hair along his crown.
“Uhg, as if you have anything I would want!” Rocket scoffs. “The tech on this planet is so out-dated. Thor, I don’t know why you keep having him adjust the arm, I’m telling you, I can do better.” Rocket casually throws a series of bundled wires back where he found them.
Steve is about to protest further, but Tony interrupts. He can’t really hear what Steve has to say right now. He can’t hear Steve try to explain why he didn’t tell him sooner. He is liable to say something really scathing… or really pathetic if he has to talk to Steve about... he is not fucking dealing with this right now.
Some nights he wakes up and he’s already spent himself in his sleep. Those nights are the worst; wiping up the result of his dream with none of the pleasure and twice the mess. Finding ways to clean and hide in close quarters adds a layer of shame and secrecy that’s becoming unbearable.
. Everyone has split apart, your boyfriend murdered my parents, Rhodey “ain’t got no legs lieutenant Dan,” the world’s governments are a
Though seriously, “Not boyfriend material”? He realizes he probably has blinders on at this point, but he literally can’t see one thing about Steve that
“See Cap? Totally under control! In a couple weeks it’ll be like it never happened at all.” He looks at his hand, and feels his eyes start to prick. Fuck.
Steve doesn’t hold back. He’s too worked up, both from the intensity of what Tony has been saying and the whole situation. He swallows Tony down without any thought to technique or finesse. Just consumes him, sucking desperately until Tony comes in just a matter of seconds.
That is, until he slides home all the way inside. It feels like all that effort may have been for nothing. Like tossing the ball around in the backyard to prepare for suddenly playing in the World Series.
Steve steps forward, poweraid forgotten “Who is us?” (Sam mumbles, “Uh yeah I’m here to, third Avenger, right here… don’t address me though portal-guy, that’s cool…”).
Hot humiliation rolls over him until Tony’s soothing voice assures him he’s okay. It’s hot even, he said… And then Tony is pressing himself into his mouth again and explaining where he’s supposed to come instead, slotting them together and encouraging Steve to rub up against his leg
Tony gives him a quick kiss and moves so Steve is out of the frame of the call. “Pop in if you want Sugar-britches, I’ve got this.”
.” Tony slides a hand down between them and punctuates the last word with a firm squeeze of Steve’s cock. Steve’s nostrils flare and Tony can feel him pulse in his hand. Jesus.
“It’s obviously a type of Terran berry, that is blue.” Nebula rasps. “Because I have blue skin. You’re not clever, Stark.”
The group decides there are quite a few essential films Peter needs to see to get caught up on the pop culture quips that float around (mainly due to Scott and Tony, but sometimes Sam too). Turns out it’s not just Peter, a pop culture education is needed for Steve, Vision and Wanda as well (who had limited US media in Sokovia growing up).
He braces one arm across both of Tony’s legs to keep him exposed, tilting his ass up again with a gentle pressure. Rather than move to get the lube Tony knows is located somewhere around his head, Steve scoots up and presses the head of his cock against Tony’s entrance.
Her face relaxes somewhat. Over the last few months they’ve found a rhythm. Almost all of their interactions are based around SI or the Foundation, but things nearly feel normal again. The break-up was almost five months ago, and Tony knows he’s been handling it better than any of their previous breaks or break-ups.
The platform Tony is standing on aligns them perfectly. He pushes forward slowly, conscious that even though Tony has been stretched he needs to be careful.
“Huh, guess it turns out we didn’t really need to be sneaking around these last couple of weeks after all.”
God Steve smells great, like pomegranate and vanilla. Suddenly he can’t seem to focus on Pepper anymore. Steve is here, in his arms, finally.
“That’s funny, Ranger Rick, because I’m pretty sure you can’t.” Tony is only half-focusing on Rocket. Almost every conversation they’ve had revolves around Rocket’s insistence that Tony is “only a genius on this planet.”
And they have been taking things slow, especially with the physical stuff, which Steve feels so completely out of his depth with. But it’s been harder and harder to go slow the more they do, and Steve is finally starting to understand how all those girls would just fall into bed with Bucky. It gets… easy.
Tony just allows himself to zone out for a minute, resting his head on Steve’s chest, running his hands down his back as he listens to the steady beat of his heart. Of course, Steve’s heart rate has already normalized. Tony’s is still rabbiting all over the place. Jesus, what just happened?
The other half is on Steve, and when he can be alone with Steve, and what Steve smells like, and how Steve laughs, and
“Alright everyone,” says Steve, catching the hint. “See you tomorrow for training. Tony is ordering in Shawarma for lunch after so bring your appetites.” Nat throws a small smile their way at that, and Steve realizes a little wistfully that she is the only other member of the team other than Tony that gets the reference.
Tony waits but Steve seems to be glitching. Tony needs to solve this. He can solve this. “Okay, never mind that, how about I tell you the reasons I want
“Oh, well you all, the Avengers I mean, you’re a big topic of conversation at school. Everyone has different theories about who is hooking up with who, who has drama, who is going to have who’s babies. There’s a
“I’m… shit I’m sorry Cap, I didn’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable” Tony slides another foot away on the sand as he speaks. Wait, what?
Slowly the images become clearer, not just flashes but whole scenes, like memories. By the time they've been on the run for a month he’s dreaming every night for what seems like hours, even if he knows he’s only been able to sleep for a few minutes.
was a good idea, in every single infinite reality, Tony’s answer would be an immediate yes. Tony irrevocably put his trust in him the first time they met. Gave him a home, and a friend, and asked for nothing.
Tony beats him to the shower, but only because by the time Steve has realized they are in a race, he also realizes he doesn’t know where the bathroom is, so he jumps following Tony close behind.
Of course Tony is automatically trying to make everything better and easier for him. He always did that, just housed the team, fed the team, provided them with anything they ever needed. And they all just took it, like it was expected. Steve is going to be sure things are different moving forward.
Sam>> Wow man, can’t wait to hear about it. Clint and Scott will be relieved too. Pretty sure being away from their kids is getting to them, heard the other day Scott mention he would consider a plea deal if he could get house arrest or something…
“I don’t think you do, and can we, can we go back inside?” Steve looks shyly down at his feet. That’s weird…
Nat turns over her shoulder at the sink to jokingly call after them “Be sure to start with the corners!”
"So anyway, I was doing my initial sweep on Auntie, what I mean is, I was riding Auntie… er, that sounds weird and dirty, the ant, which is an insect, is named Auntie. I actually don’t have an
He knows he should tell Tony to see a doctor anyway. Bruce is a genius, but he isn’t actually a medical doctor. He tries to get the words out but his whole chest has gone tight. Tighter than it was during any of his old asthmatic episodes.
This series is a set of stories based on the AMAZING epistolary fic “1796 Broadway,” where ‘Captain America respectfully requests that all complaints be addressed to him in writing.’ I really admire what the authors are doing, and the slow build they are creating is so so lovely… that said, my brain won’t shut up after each post with “what now???” so this is an answer to that.
Tony’s right, he’s still hard. Once the sparks clear from his vision he begins sliding in and out of him again. He’s a little sensitive, but the incredible amount of ejaculate he just released eases the way. He finds a smooth rhythm almost immediately.
Water has started pouring out of 6 of the faucets, steaming up the shower and making it pleasantly warm, but not hot.
Gah if this chapter was a 10 on the sex-o-meter, the next few turn it up to 11... Stay tuned eeeeee...
“Shh, I know, just… I need to concentrate Tony. Can you relax into my hold? I’m going to move you up and down over my cock until I come. I just need you to move where I put you okay? You can lean back, I won’t let you fall.”
Bruce tries, he focuses on the danger, on the people who may get hurt by this mystery plant. But it’s no good. The feeling fades and Hulk is gone.
“Yep” says Tony, and damn it, that’s all he can think to say. He’s tempted to flirt with “Dr. Steve” more, but Steve is doing so well playing it straight, and Tony suspects he’d just get rebuffed.
Steve laughs and rolls his eyes. “It was bound to happen eventually. The only reason I didn’t kiss you during that mess on the Rhine last month was because of your damn helmet.”
But well, while that is all true, Tony is also basically just dying to see his boyfriend again. Or, partner? Special fella? That’s the thing, he doesn’t even know what they’re calling themselves.
The idea of Tony sucking him, coming into his hyperactive mouth, blocking that constant prattle with his cock… is amazing…
Finally Steve tells him, “It’s time to speed up now, once you feel the first dose coat you, you’ll be able to touch yourself if you want.”
Tony is breathing hard and can’t look at Steve anymore. Fuck he really thought he was over most of this shit.
Steve is half-way down Tony’s throat and about to come when Friday insists that Bruce’s call is urgent.
He reaches out to grip his legs behind the knees and pulls back to where Steve put him. It’s comfortable enough for now, but he’s not sure how long he can hold this. “Yes I can hold myself open for you, Steve.”
Tony briefly wishes he was twenty years younger. Though twenty years ago he would probably have been equally impatient, and all this would be over in about six minutes.
Steve reflects that may be because both Pepper and Scott found out by accident, watching their intimate moments and not through any sort of planned discussion...
“My first impulse is to tell you that you seem to really care about Becky, and that whatever is going on with Tony, it’s not really worth jeopardizing what you have.”
“Same." Tony kisses Steve's temple. "I hope you aren’t feeling at all self-conscious about how experienced you are, because seriously, that was the hottest sex of my life. 100%, no questions, the Best with a capital B.”
He dries off (“activate instant-dry”) and heads for the bedroom, anticipation coiled tight in his belly.
He’s on the right track, he thinks. He begins stroking him again, not hurried, just pressure up and down the length to remind him he’s there.
He turns back to Steve and Tony. “I gotta head back. See you guys in a few months, don’t get married before I come home.”
“That’s right, beg. As soon as I’m back in your mouth, you’re allowed to use my leg to come. You can use the other one since this one is already wet okay?” He motions to his left leg, where the pant material is damp and dark, smeared with the evidence of Steve’s arousal.
Tony doesn’t really love the idea of rewarding Steve putting him off, but at this point he’s too excited to care what sort of message this sends. He’s just slipped the plug all the way in, and is breathing deep to adjust when a vid-screen call comes in from Pepper.
wild and beautiful and so amazing in so many ways that Steve doesn’t even fully understand… he’s wild but that’s not
I don't think all those details really fit here in this fic, but I'll probably explore all that in a different story... Probably with a side of medical-kink haha.
Bruce is about to prompt him again when he breaks his silence: “I suppose… I suppose I didn’t want to risk that things with Tony would change. I wanted to keep… I wanted to keep him.” Steve shrugs sort of helplessly, not sure if that makes any sense to Bruce, given how little he’s explained things (though Bruce is certainly asking some pointed questions, so maybe his feelings for Tony have only been unclear to himself?).
I was re-watching Infinity War, and Rhodey is really welcoming to Steve and the rest when they show up at the compound. He has this sort of "long time no see" vibe, so I figure it's realistic enough that he'd be cool with Steve, especially if Tony has been waxing poetic about him for weeks haha.
He’d better skedaddle, they’re probably having some sort of important Avengers team leadership meeting or something-
Steve pauses, relishing the feeling of Tony around him, his pelvis and thighs press up against Tony’s ass. “How does that feel, do you need a moment?” he asks.
dressed down to their underwear (Natasha was able to wear her usual full-body tactical gear somehow, and Tony was about 40% covered by the nano-armor in mid-application).
Steve gets quiet for a while, some old worries swirling around his brain at the hard prospect of leaving Tony.
Tony lets a happy little moan escape. God damn, constant phantom erections may be his new perpetual state of being around Steve.
Tony’s hand travels down naturally, starting a familiar rhythm before he stops himself. He can’t actually have Steve at the moment, but he might as well imagine what it would be like… Steve would knock on the bathroom door, asking if Tony had an extra toothbrush. He’d come in, maybe thinking the shower had curtains, that he could just slip in and slip out. But the shower is glass, and he’d get a full view of Tony, touching himself, bracing one hand against the glass as the other stroked.
And the whole "difficult to be around" thing… being compared to a mangy cat doesn’t exactly inspire confidence, but somehow Steve made it sound okay.
“Yeah, and apparently jokes about disabilities get funnier by the minute out here.” Rhodey rolls his eyes, but Tony suddenly wants to crack some skulls. “What are those assholes saying?”
Tony pauses to press the cloth’s cool gel bumps more firmly up against Steve’s perineum on his way back to his hole. Steve releases the most animalistic groan yet.
"Hi Mr. Stark, I’m Dr. Rogers, how are you today?” Steve asks, busing himself by looking down at the clipboard through his wire-frame glasses.
Steve looks down at his own erection and blushes from scalp to belly button. He’s leaking. A lot. It almost looks like he's already come he’s so wet. It’s starting to pool at the base of his cock and slide down. Oh god, he’s mortified.
Pepper grins uncomfortably. “Okay, I’ll… I’ll leave it there. I know it’s a lot to ask, and a lot to think about. I would want you two to of course discuss it privately, and think about whatever level of involvement you would want post-birth… Just, think about it. I’m not banking on this, there are a ton of highly respected sperm banks in this city, and so if this is a “no” from you I totally understand, I’m okay. Totally.”
Tony leans back against him and sighs, mirroring the pose they made in the shower earlier. “And also," says Tony, pushing his ass back to grind into Steve "sneaking around sucks and is a major cock-block?”
No, Tony doesn’t do things halfway, and as he enters his exam/medical room he hums in satisfaction. It looks like every standard doctor’s office he has ever seen. Inside two large metal cabinets along the far wall there are weapons and food supplies, but from the outside they look like they probably hold medical accoutrement.
“And when I woke up it felt like people never even knew, never learned. Sure, it’s there in the history books. I think people cover it for about a week in grade school now… but they don’t see… they weren’t
Honestly, he’d love to just spend more time with Tony. They’ve been in the shower for quite a while now, but it’s so big and the spray is so intuitive that it’s not really like a shower. It’s more like a sauna, warm and relaxing. His fingers aren’t even pruney. Steve knows he’s getting ahead of himself, but he hopes the new compound has a shower like this.
“I only saw one camp, in ‘45. We were in the right place at the right time to help with the liberation.  Most of what the Commandos and I did was focused on Hydra. And those bases were bad. Human experiments, weapons. But the camp, Tony...
Another full night of sleep and three intense orgasms the night before mean he feels better than he has in months. He looks over at Tony, who is already up. His back is against the plush headboard, glasses on, tapping away at a Stark Pad in his lap.
For the first time in weeks he feels useful, conducting a variety of tests and experiments on his samples to ensure everyone is safe.
He turns out the light and returns to the group, who have taken to asking LASS-E to do random acts to see what Tony has programed (or what she can learn? Steve isn’t really sure how AI’s work).
He takes Steve’s face in his hands and presses their lips together, short and sweet. “Thank you Steve, you’re doing so well.”
He’s never been this happy. And chances are he won't get to be with Tony like this again any time soon. Even when the new accords launch, and the team coalesces in the compound upstate… it’s just hard to imagine having this kind of time to just… be.
Bruce takes his glasses off and closes his eyes. “Well, I mean I saw you two were getting along really well… Wait, Steve likes men? Gah, sorry let’s focus on the issue, Tony’s health.”
They’ll go to Hawaii, away from Japan and all the negativity Tony has managed to amass here. And once they are relaxed on the beach, Steve will have a straight talk with Tony and tell him everything.
Steve mentally compares this set-up to the system of secret knocks and restricted movement they’ve been using in their most recent hide-out/hovel and shakes his head. As he reaches out to place his palm on the elevator’s scanner Friday’s measured voice makes him pause.
Tony can only nod as he thinks wildly that Steve actually would make an amazing doctor. He feels so safe and comfortable.
“Tony, I know it must be hard to pin-point since as of now this appears to have accumulated slowly over time, but can you think of any other side effects? How is your appetite? Your sleep? Have you noticed any changes? I can download a more detailed survey which may jog your memory, but does anything jump out?”
Not that he was complaining; it’s more than he ever thought he’d have, but like anything else he wants, once he's had a taste it suddenly isn't enough.
So maybe this is something he can give Tony; maybe right now Steve needs to hear that Tony is a ‘Yes.’
So what, so he’s caught Captain America jerking it in his bed, totally normal. Tony can be an adult about this. “Okay, yeah, just yell when you want me to come out!”
Tony shivers and considers the question. “That’s a difficult question Steve, because I want everything, all the time, all at once. I think we’ll have the opportunity to explore a lot of different things together, so what we do tonight isn’t something I need to make the call on.”
“I just… uh, that feels good, it’s just that doing this with someone requires either a lot of carelessness or a lot of trust. I got smarter, more careful, and I didn’t trust anyone enough, so I just didn’t.”
Less than a minute later Steve tells him to come in. The blanket is still all the way up to his neck, but Tony figures maybe that’s some weird, old-timey I-just-masturbated-and-now-need-to-cover-up thing that people did.
They’re in Bruce’s lab, and he is sitting on the stools they always sit on. When he comes down here for any extended amount of time it’s because Bruce is actually taking a break and they can joke around, or he’s working on something so complicated they can really get down to it, just like he’d hoped they would when they first met on the helicarrier… it’s comforting.
Bruce appears to be reaching his limit. “Just put the sample in the mini-fridge with the biohazard symbol when you’re done Steve. I’m going to head upstairs to give you some privacy.”
He shifts onto his side so the issue at hand (ha, he wishes) is less noticeable and just stares. He can’t believe this; Steve is in his bed. His eyes are closed, and he has this small smile on his face that just makes Tony want to…
He gets to work running the cloth over Steve’s lower back and glutes. He presses the cloth back and forth, the little beads providing a mini-deep tissue massage. He then lets the spray do its work washing the soap away. Next he pours more soap directly into the top of Steve’s ass-crack. Steve shifts slightly at the cool sensation as it drips down down down.
“I’ll do it.” Steve says, quickly unbuckling his pants so they can take care of things (at least for now).
Because Steve has been kissing Tony relentlessly, and Tony’s hands are still pinned he has no way to warn Steve. He’s comes in hot waves with no warning. Crying out into Steve’s mouth.
As much as Tony wants to jump into their doctor/patient roles the next day, what he has in mind requires some prep work. He doesn’t want to half-ass this by having Steve throw on a white coat and examine him on their bed in the suite.
This thing keeps growing and growing haha. I thought it would be 4 chapters but now it's probably at least 6. Thanks to everyone who is taking the time to read!
Bruce settles back onto a stool and wonders if he did the right thing. Steve is obviously completely gone for Tony. And he knows he has a lecture coming from Nat about how he’s messing with Steve’s perfectly perfect budding relationship with Becky. That Stark is an unknown quantity that may be doing better on the team, but who is a disaster when it comes to his personal life.
Steve and Tony deliver drinks and glasses while Vision and Wanda serve up the food. Once they are all at the table Tony gets a funny little flutter in his chest. Sitting down as a group and eating together wasn’t something that happened every day at the tower, but they did it enough to make this feel familiar, like coming home.
“Anyone? Cap, Steve what’s your 20?” he’s flying full-speed in the direction he knows Steve was blasted.
He pulls back, smiling, “I’m glad they knew each other.” And he is. He realizes he hasn’t thought about Peggy in some time. And that the old hollow pain he used to feel when he did is gone.
to come out before, especially when Bruce has been in danger. He thinks if he gets calm enough, meditates enough, he can figure out how to “fix” this.
Sometimes he writes about how he can’t sleep. He’s careful not to get too intense. He doesn’t want Tony to shut down when he is so far away, but slowly it starts to feel right again. Like they were before Japan. They share stories and create inside jokes and one day when Tony calls him ‘Captain Tightpants’ in retaliation to some barb of his own, Steve writes back only:
. What if he's just been humoring Steve and his freakish cock... Hadn’t Tony just said Option 1 was a good one? He probably doesn't even want to do anything more and is just trying to go to sleep. He’s such an idiot.
my huge relationship news before him! What was I thinking? Quick, come back to the suite, we have to call him right now.”
Nat’s head falls back and she looks up to the sky and sighs. She holsters her gun. “Here we go…” she says.
So okay, no shirt. Steve knocks and before he can second guess any more he’s opening the door and taunting Steve to catch him like a little kid, running out on the deck and down to the beach.
heard Pepper say the word fuck. He’s pretty sure she has said the word, like, maybe if she was alone and stubbed her toe? But around Tony, not even once.
have used a considerable amount of money to slice through the red tape that normally delays such swift governmental action.
“I know you know, but once again, I am not a medical doctor. Honestly, we may want to bring Cho in if you’re comfortable with that?”
“Hey, you know that ‘eat something and go to sleep’ is definitely still on the table, right? Like, that’s Option 1, and it’s a great one! Where are we on that?”
be breaking all the rules he set out for tonight and he’s already broken so many. Tony’s so good at that, making him break rules that would otherwise be as strong as steel.
The Accords II are passed and everything moves really quickly after that. Once pardoned, Scott stops by the compound long enough to do a meet and greet with the newly reunited team, and get a tour of the place. Then he flies back to California to see Cassie and talk to her mother about The Plan. He doesn’t actually
He walks over to the painting (which he knows is worth at least six figures) and feels along the edge of the frame until his fingers graze a button. It can’t be seen by looking at the frame, but he can feel the slight difference in texture. Steve just barely hears a smooth “click” noise as he presses the button, and moments later the pristine wood flooring at his feet collapses into a series of steps that lead down what looks like 2-3 stories.
Bruce takes his glasses off and cleans them to buy him one last minute of not getting tangled up in this mess.
“There’s some sort of sentient plant attacking the Brooklyn Bridge, all available Avengers assemble. Coordinates to follow… or just head out to Brooklyn, you’ll see it.”
The count-down gets to zero and the session begins. The “enemy” of the course emerges immediately as a group of 10-12 floating orbs. The floating balls range in size from about the size of a baseball up to a basketball, and they all shoot lasers at anything that moves with increasing accuracy.
The facade of the building was designed so the entrance looks like it’s a part of the adjacent building. “Entrance” is probably too strong a word, Steve reflects. The door which isn’t easy to see in the first place reads more like some kind of storage, or maybe maintenance access. A blasé utility box hangs on the wall next to it. If anyone opened it up they would see a series of ancient-looking switches and couple of cracked dials which connect to nothing, perfecting the misdirection.
“Squidward” flys away with Dr. Strange, but Tony is able to snag Steve once the building is stable and fly him up to the now airborne donut.
He yells with the effort, trying again and again, but nothing happens. When he looks up at Thor he’s gone, replaced by Tony in the armor.
Steve interrupts any further social planning, “Tony, they’ve almost breeched the forcefield, where are we at?”
- Tony teases Nebula more and finds out she has a crush (Captain Marvel? Bucky? Sam? ... Loki? They are both blue, hmm)
Scott is crazy-pumped to be an Avenger. But only two weeks in he might die from embarrassment. Steve is right there with him.
He had planned to program even more options, but the Accords II ended up taking less time to resolve than he thought they would (due to the fact that he spent
“We would love some paprikash!” says Tony. “Why don’t we get everyone’s drinks while we’re up? Sam? Nat? What’s your poison?”
Tony looks apologetic, and says “Okay Fri, gather that data, and stay as surface as you can, no need to analyze specifics… yet.”
of them. So don’t feel like there’s any one thing we need to do or not do. Why don’t we get clean and then I’ll give you some more options?”
Steve grabs the armor just before he goes through, and gives Tony a quick, dirty kiss. “Be careful.”
Each individual piece I write will have the explanation above, and a summary of what entry from “1796 Broadway” it is based on in the Notes section. I highly recommend you read “1796 Broadway,” even if epistolary isn’t something you usually go for (and also it will make what I write make much more sense, haha)!
Tony can’t help the strangled noise that rips from him. He knows Steve isn’t going to try to penetrate him from just a thorough rimming, but he can feel him there, the hot head of his erection, just a ghost of a presence. What?
And maybe Tony should take some of what he is dishing out and find a good therapist in New York… and maybe get a dog.
As to the note at the beginning of this chapter: I don't think I'm actually done with this story. This will probably become a series where I do more in this universe since we time-jumped so much at the end. Especially the timeframe where the team is reunited before Thanos shows up... or the time of peace after.
Steve nods slowly, not really sure where this is going. It doesn’t sound like Tony is letting him down easy...
Tony thought he’d found that with Pepper, but it turned out he took more than she could give in the end. Or maybe he gave more than she could take… But the beauty of what he had with Pepper, he’s realizing now, is that it made him grow the fuck up. For once he doesn’t feel like he’s at a loss for how to do this. He can see the infinite ways he could fuck this thing up with Steve, but that glowing ember in his chest is strong, ready. He sees the pitfalls and he is thinking ten steps ahead about how to avoid them.
Tony laughs a beautiful, genuine laugh. “You know what Steve, you may be on to something… nice modern reference by the way, who sat you down to watch Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?”
Tony rolls his eyes and mumbles what Steve’s hearing just makes out as “mixed messages!” before removing his own pants and watch, and taking his phone out of the pocket placing it beside the Stark pad and getting in.
“Shh, it’s alright Tony, I just need to go prepare your medicine. It’s not something I would normally do in front of a patient… but if you’re uncomfortable being left alone I can do it here.” Steve says, voice calm and warm.
