You bury your face into the pillow, trying to chase away the images that flash in front of your eyes.
When Mycroft finally turned to the door, Mme Dessaut was long gone. Soon, they'd meet their eighteenth French governess.
Right. I'm getting side-tracked. But you're just... never mind. I'm babbling. Did you babble in your notebook? I wonder. Probably not. It didn't look like babbling to me. You're not the type. Though I wish I could see you babbling at least once in my life — ideally because of me. How was it that you put it, again? A "begging mess". I swear I will turn you into one too, Sherlock. Some day.
"Take your clothes off," John says softly, undressing himself. He lets go of your hand, but remains close enough for you to touch. Still, the loss of the soothing circles of his thumb on your skin makes terror rise in your chest again. You unbutton your shirt, trying to get a grip, and realize your hands are no longer shaking. But you feel cold. So very cold. "Here. Take a towel, and dry your body," John says. "I think Mary left a hair dryer somewhere around here. I'll take care of your hair."
"You really shouldn't worry about John forgetting you and everything. He clearly hasn't, you know. Well, you don't, but I'm telling you. Your informants are idiots, they don't live with him, they're not close to him. Or maybe you're just the one inducing stupid things from what their telling you, but–"
When he woke up again the ceiling was grey. Daylight fell on the sheets and scattered the shadows like spilt milk. Greg felt the roughness of the sheets against his skin and tried to feel a presence by his side. He looked and remembered Caroline had left years ago. Sometimes he was reminded of what her presence had felt like; but he no longer felt her absence. Another one, more mercilessly potent still, had overridden Caro's.
"I am you – prepared to do anything; prepared to burn; prepared to do what ordinary people won't do."
"John. I wasn't trying to imply that you need be anything more. It seems I can't help but offend you with everything I say."
kind of relationship, even just as a flatmate or a colleague, was intoxicating. And exhausting, too. John had always conceived relationships as part of one's social life: people had friends, girlfriends, people they worked with, people they liked, people they didn't like... An individual was integrated in society through this web constituted by their various relationships to people. There were codes, conventions, and it made everything work smoothly. It brought order. Bearings. Unlike the chaos of war, it allowed you to build something, take a look at your life and create, even in small ways, the person you wanted to be.
The tiger blinked, twice. Then it fixed a haughty gaze on John, who couldn't believe what he saw. He frowned.
"John..." Sherlock moaned, trying to convey in his groan the whole thought: 'Are you taking me for an idiot?'
Since John wouldn't talk about it and seemed intent on keeping things between them identical, as if he had never blurted out his feelings, Sherlock wasn't left with many options. John wouldn't voice or even, perhaps, admit to himself what it was he truly wanted, and so the consulting detective would do what he did best: he would experiment, and he would observe. He was confident enough in his skills that he believed he could learn everything there was to learn about John Watson, so that his deductions about him would never again turn out to be wrong.
Having now unbuttoned the striped shirt completely, Sherlock fondled John's torso and lifted it so he could pull his shirt up his arms gently until it was all crumpled around the wrists, by the manacles. John arched his back, more out of excitation than obedience, and it was quite unwitting – he probably had no wit left at all. It was crazy how Sherlock's hands could throw him off balance so badly, making him feel like he'd fallen into another world, somewhere in Wonderland where Sherlock was surrounding him completely with his strokes his scent his voice...
'. It was funny how John still managed, with such a small, short body, to hold him in such a way that Sherlock felt safe.
He let his hands fall to John's shoulders and roam down to the chest, playing with both nipples through the fabric until they were so hard Sherlock could actually see them. John groaned, chewing his bottom lip. Sherlock caressed the swollen mouth lightly with one finger, while his other hand came to rest around John's neck.
"Yes. Then tell me, genius, why in the world would I give you a blow job if I did not feel like it? As you can observe, there is no weapon being directed at me. Nor at you."
You'll be the one holding the gun this time. Since you're not talking, if you want me to stop, just shoot the wall."
"Once," Mycroft went on, apparently ignoring her, "he asked me if I thought there was something wrong with us."
"I met a very handsome guy today in front of a guitar shop," Mary declares, her mouth still half full of pastries Mrs. Hudson has baked for tea.
Sherlock's voice was sweet and he was still smiling, as if that would somehow make his words less harsh. And perhaps it did, for Sandra seemed to relax a little.
It dawned on John then, that this was a conversation he did not want to hear. Clearly, they needed to talk. John had assumed that they
Sherlock stared for a second, then groaned. He pulled John down and bit his throat, just below the ear, leaving a mark and eliciting a moan.
"Ooh, I'm liking you," he announced in his sing-song voice. Sebastian smirked as he dragged on his cigarette, inhaling deeply.
Since John had insisted, Sherlock had gone through the trouble of getting dressed, even though there was no reason he should go out. His blue dressing gown would have been just fine. But after last night, Sherlock thought he should be as compliant as possible regarding the unimportant matters. And putting on clothes definitely belonged to the latter.
"... Right. And you decided to come because she kept receiving those weird messages, both on her email and her blog."
As he nosed around the victim's room, Sherlock's eyes fell on a notepad next to the phone. He stopped in his tracks.
John bit his lip violently to stifle back what he feared was nothing less than a wail, and his head rolled back. This was torture. Whether sweet or not, it just shouldn't be allowed.
But none among the guests had been linked to his current situation, nor to his past. Furthermore, nothing extraordinary had happened: no murder, no crime had been reported to anyone. If something had happened in Karlštejn during that weekend, it had remained a well-kept secret.
"I think you got it wrong," Josiah said abruptly, "but I guess it's your job. To investigate, I mean. So Brad is... dead, and Henry is gone?"
Once you had nothing left to throw up, you realized you were shaking uncontrollably, and that you were still hard. It made you so sick you thought you'd pass out from the sheer intensity of the nausea, but you managed to crawl into the shower and turn the cold water on, letting it pour over you.
The word 'Sherlock' hangs in the air, weighing it down and making it muggy around them. Mike clears his throat, noticeably embarrassed. Scraping his head, he says:
"Just get out of the way, you're preventing people from getting in and out, standing there like an idiot. Young people these days, bloody blind, can't look where they're going, stupid people with their stupid phones..."
You turn. On the other side of the canyon, there is a man standing. You don't recognize him at first, because he's in uniform, and he's so far away from you... But again a name flashes in your mind.
"Mr. Leverton, this is Mr. Holmes, a very old friend of mine from 'varsity, and his husband, Dr. Watson."
But John didn't even stay to try to understand him. He walked to the door and waited for Sherlock to open it for him. A little vexed at having been ignored, Sherlock scoffed and turned away. But John didn't even look at him, and kept waiting.
"I'm perfectly healthy. I see women when I feel like it, which isn't too often, I must say, and it doesn't usually turn out very well. But I don't mind. I can take care of myself. It's just physiology. And if I want to be a fetishist, I've got everything I need."
John rolled his eyes and Sherlock gave his most adorable moue in an attempt to persuade him. Then he remembered something and dropped the act immediately. Wasn't John supposed to be working at the clinic today? When was the last time he...?
, he thought. Well, just a little. Just the necessary. He was not insomniac like Sherlock, mind you. He was just a busy man. All the busier since his little brother's "death".
I bet you weren't expecting another chapter so soon! Well, I wasn't either... Reviewers are loved :D
Their eyes locked. Slowly, he saw the tide rising within her pupils, waves of disgust and anger and... scorn. Her face broke into a rictus.
Fleeing. Yes. That's an idea. Sherlock's eyes fall on the window. The Woman came in that way once. Or left that way at any rate. Both, probably. But he's already undressed and John will be back any second.
John's stupidity was just boundless. Sherlock just shook his head and grew more desperate: he had no idea what was happening to him, and he couldn't count on John to be of any help. All he'd managed to do was shoot at him.
"I wasn't having some fit of insecurity, y'know. I was just asking if you were as happy as I was that we had a son. A son, John! D'you realize?"
And dangerous, too. He didn't want to bother with something so messy. But sex and sentiments were two separate things. Mycroft certainly had no sentiments, not even many feelings at all, Sherlock mused, and yet he didn't run away from sex like Sherlock did. Probably just like Moriarty. Such above average minds were curious by nature and would want to try everything at least once in their lives. Sherlock's error had been to delude himself so badly. It wasn't that he didn't care. He'd never even tried. What was hidden behind his ostentatious lack of interest in sex wasn't indifference, but fear. Fear of getting caught up into it. Fear of losing control. If he truly hadn't cared, he'd have done just like Mycroft or Moriarty. He'd have tried, got bored, and would've had recourse to it punctually only when he deemed it absolutely necessary.
"There, there," Sherlock assuaged him teasingly, stroking the soft fur of John's neck. The manul growled and bit him. "You're terribly temperamental tonight," Sherlock commented without stopping to pet him.
Knowing that he was in love with Sherlock – badly – did not help. John shivered under the ice cold shower. Love was no excuse. And even if he was an idiot, it didn't take a genius to realize that there was something wrong, very wrong with the dream he'd had.
"I'm on a train compartment with a tiger and we're arriving at Victoria Station in less than ten minutes," John said precipitately.
But John did not give him enough time to protest. Swooping down on him, he bit down on his throat, very lightly, just enough to leave a mark. This seemed to calm the detective, and for one second John wondered if he'd done something wrong, and if his friend had frozen on the spot again. He looked up worriedly, but Sherlock was smiling down at him in a surprisingly warm way, his face glowing with an uncharacteristic tenderness John had never noticed there before, or had always construed as the genius merely indulging him.
"I came to ask about John Watson and Sherlock. But I also thought you might want to be aware of my existence," she commented curtly as she was about to leave the room. She looked Mycroft into the eye. "In case you ever need me."
He knew the tremor and the tears in his voice would haunt him until the day he died. He cherished it, and the ache it brought.
As she pushes open the door to their flat, she remembers that tonight John will come back home late. Which means it is her turn to prepare dinner. Another groan – something else she doesn't want to do. Still, for John's sake, she decides to give it a try and opens the fridge to see what she can make.
It was useless to ask about what. So she let her hand slide down his arm slowly, releasing him instead; her caress, a threat.
As he turns in a sideways alley, John takes out his little notebook in which he takes notes, sketches (very bad ones, he must say), area maps, etc. He doesn't use at night the Ipad Chris and Harry gave him as a gift to this effect – take notes, pictures, drawings on a graphic table... John avoids taking it with him during his nightly outings, especially in risky neighbourhoods.
Sherlock nodded, keeping his eyes on Josiah while answering John; it might have no been necessary, as the man wasn't even looking at him, too occupied reminiscing.
"Of no help at all," she answered with a grin. He stared. "I just wanted to meet you. To meet a Holmes, of course – I've heard so much about you two that I was getting frustrated. But I wanted to meet you especially."
"Look, Mycroft. I saw Sherlock when he played with Moriarty for the first time. He was excited. He was genuinely
John had just slipped into bed when he heard the steps creak and a knock on his door. His throat tightened as he sat up.
"You've got to see the whole picture," she explains. "I was dumped by that guy I was ridiculously in love with, and ever since every guy I've ever had was always only interested in sex, and it never worked out for anything else. It's not that I'm getting old and serious and want to build a family. I'm just a bit tired of it, so I go for women instead. I like both, so I don't mind."
"So, is he any good? Most likely a quick learner, I bet. He must be so endearing, so keen to please you..."
But this was different. It hadn't been self-destruction – at least not one he had planned himself. And John had been involved from the start. Even shocked and traumatized, Sherlock wouldn't stop being rational. He liked putting his own life on the line to prove he was clever, that was the ultimate thrill, and he loved flirting with danger – and with danger alone. But he certainly didn't enjoy putting someone else's life in jeopardy and be proven a fool in the process.
The elder Holmes frowned. "You know how I worry. Sherlock... has a tendency to expose himself to all kinds of dangers."
"Oh. Well. It's been months. Years. I couldn't want to murder you forever. Or I would have already done it."
"They don't even know whether it is the same person or not – it is the same poison, and used on red apples only, but the amount of victims seems too important for it to be only one murderer..."
"When you came back you said this wasn't your flat anymore. I think it's a big improvement, if you see me as your flatmate."
As he walked down the street he thought he felt a presence watching him and sent nervous glances here and there. He had nothing to hide of course, nothing to hide at all, but... One was never too careful. And Yngvar was especially prudent. To be fair, he had more to fear than a legitimately indignant wife.
As he went into the bathroom, he pointedly avoided looking at the mirror and quickly stepped into the bathtub. But he could not avoid looking down at his own body. It was true that he was rather angular, and his skin was very pale, almost cadaverous. It didn't look healthy. He, however, felt healthy enough: his body was perfect for transport. Sherlock was capable of fighting very well without a weapon, ran fast, and was very nimble. His body had also got used to little food and little sleep, which was very convenient. The consulting detective had never needed his body to look pleasant: he dressed well, and this sufficed to make him appear reliable to clients. He was good enough at acting to look amiable, kind, sympathizing if necessary. His body functioned satisfactorily.
"The work's crazy without Sherlock, and the yard is a mess since that scandal," he replied casually, deciding it would be better for both of them to mention Sherlock's name from the very beginning.
The manul shook his head and promised himself he would confess properly to his friend once he'd turned back into his human form. For now, he would be perfectly content cuddling all day.
"I'm not. But... Well, I suppose it's the natural time to go. But we can visit his grave anytime, really."
Not that I have skin cancer, but you never know what might happen! And having one might prevent it.’
Maybe. Or maybe not. Sherlock had no guarantee whatsoever that John would live even if he severed their bond and detached himself from him. Was it worth the risk? Was hurting him worth the possibility of saving his life? Was there any other way?
"Ladies and gentlemen. We will be arriving shortly in London. Thank you for travelling with us today, and-"
When Blake will be born (will it be Blake? Will it even be a boy?) this room, this flat, will be transformed again.
You are vaguely aware that you are the one who has uttered the words. No, no... They keep echoing in your mind. You don't know how many times you've said them. Or if you've said them out loud at all. You don't feel very steady and realize you're shaking. Seb's body has fallen limp on the floor, and a puddle of blood is slowly forming around his head – a macabre aureole.
Sherlock looked excitedly at the manul to see whether he was pleased or not. John was more than pleased. His pupils sparkled endearingly and he blinked, disbelieving. He wasn't sure what made him happier: that he could finally do something of his day, or that Sherlock had been so thoughtful just for him (the tiger's paws were much too big even for this keyboard). It didn't take him long to be sure, though. Grinning widely at his flatmate, he gave him a dazzling smile that, on his heavily furred face, came off slightly more alarming than the Cheshire Cat's. Sherlock smiled back, feeling something bubbling in his chest. He brushed it off as excitement and joy at seeing his friend so happy.
Damn this. Stupid words and stupid voice and stupid throat. Sherlock looks away in shame and frustration.
Would it always be like that from now on? The emptiness engulfing time. The pain eating the hours away so we became old unwittingly. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad, then, mused John. It would, though. If a week had felt like a year, he didn't even want to start thinking about what a year would feel like. Oh, how he just wished he could murder the man. John remembered having written once on his blog that one day, he'd kill Sherlock. It had been after the consulting detective had used him as an experiment in Baskerville, testing his theory even though it involved terrifying John. How stupid. One doesn't know what it means, to kill. John had known, though. He'd killed men in Afghanistan. He'd killed a man for Sherlock. Still, he too used the common expression.
John cursed and hurled the pillow in his face, storming out of the room. Sherlock smirked and held the pillow to his chest, drowsing back to sleep with a smile on his lips.
He didn't have to tell him twice. As he devoured the meal, John slowly realized that this meant Sherlock had expected his next transformation and so had planned everything this time. John hadn't even been aware that they'd had bacon, although he had noticed some unidentified items in the freezer. It could've been frozen
"If you're done here, can we move on?" Donovan cut in a little too gleefully. "Some people have work to do. You know, catch a murderer."
He shakes his head helplessly. "I want..." He swallows. "I want you to live. Happily. With your family. I want you to live the life you've chosen."
No. If this had been a real tiger, he probably wouldn't just lie there and merely push John back when he touched him. A real tiger would've bitten him, surely. Right?
"I'm fine," Sherlock muttered, trying to get the rest of the toast from his lover, and failing as John raised his hand away. Sherlock scowled, but drank a sip from his coffee, and reached for another piece of toast – John however was faster than him and covered his hand with his, stopping his frenzy. He looked him in the eye intensely.
incognito. Mycroft's people were to be avoided too, and in fact all the "angels"'s people in general (
John stopped dead in his track, and took a deep breath – bracing himself for what was to come. Sherlock went on.
"Shh, it's all right," you cut in, pulling him into a hug. You hugged Harry only once in your life, and that was when you had to organize the funeral of your parents together. This is the same kind of hug. The kind of hug you give somebody to pull them together, to prevent them from breaking to pieces. But you can feel Sherlock stiffen in your arms, his muscles becoming tense. Yet you refuse to let go, and repeat instead: "It's all right. Just tell me what you want to do now. Do you want to take a shower? Have some sleep?"
Blow after blow after blow, devoured by anger and desperation, John never seemed to get enough. His voice was getting hoarse from shouting at the lifeless figure. His eyes burnt and the tears refused to stop. He wished the puppet could bleed and scream and cry too, but of course it couldn't, it was just a
, and it was so absurd and silly he couldn't help but break into a fit of giggle – and a manul giggling sounded very much like a hen clucking, which only made the matter worse, since John heard himself laugh and was mortified. The fact that Sherlock would only hold him when he was a stupid, ugly but entertaining cat was really pathetic, but the fact that he knew it and still enjoyed the embrace and craved it was even more pathetic, to such an extent in fact that he kept laughing, and laughing, until his eyes were filled with tears out of laughter. Out of laughter only, of course. God, he must have been tired.
But Mrs. Hudson has already seen them, and Greg, following her gaze, turns around and stares. You can tell from the look on his face that his eyes have met Sherlock's.
"Yes, I will. You're not locking me in this flat, Sherlock. I'm free to go out if I wish." Then, to make up for what may have sounded a bit harsh, although it had been said calmly, he added: "I'm the one with the gun, remember?"
Sherlock looked at John from above and pierced him with his gaze. He could feel his pulse under his fingers, his blood rushing to the carotid artery. Sherlock saw fear, hope, guilt, shame, devotion, courage. There were bruises and love bites and marks from the belt and the collar on his skin.
Some people liked to lie down to think, but Sherlock was not one of them as a child; and as an adult, he always preferred the sofa. Beds were meant for sleep, and sleep was boring. So beds were boring. QED. Rising. Falling.
"You didn't let me finish. Although, I think I was quite clear about it." He snuggled up closer, crawling up to John very much like a predator to his prey, until their breaths were mingling. "I want you to touch me. Touch me.
to him until the very end. His last words to him had been bullshit. And that hurt more than anything.
"I would be terrified by a breast-less woman with a penis, if that's what you're saying. But in case you haven't noticed, you're a man."
(in fact, Molly didn't, because she couldn't read Latin and didn't care much for regimental mottoes)
John seemed so intent on bringing Sherlock to his laptop that finally the detective gave in and followed him. The cat began to type again as Sherlock started reading what was already on the screen.
"I aimed my gun at Seb and turned down the Woman, John. I don't recall having done either of those with you."
'Yes, indeed, my bonny lassie,' said the Brooklet. 'They glint on my banks at night. Paddle about, and maybe you'll find one.'
As he buttons up his pyjama shirt, he cannot get Sherlock out of his mind, and imagines it is Sherlock's hands buttoning him up. Closing his eyes, he concentrates on the image - then realizes he'd rather have Sherlock unbutton him.
"Sherlock, stop this!" John exclaimed between giggles, stepping in closer, putting his hand on the detective's own. Both froze as Sherlock's length throbbed under the newly added contact. Sherlock gulped, and John smirked, pressing himself closer to his lover's back, his arms encircling him and his fingers laced with his, brushing against his hardness.
"Thank you, Dr. Watson! I hope I'll be better next week, my daughter is coming with her husband and her little boys! It'd be a pity if I wasn't well."
Sherlock through fairy tales, because Sherlock was a child. He was playing the king, what with wearing the crown – and didn't he call himself
"Is that why you took a shower? To prepare yourself so I could have my way with you? Do you really think of me as such a man?"
. Yes, that was him. But crippled and twisted, too. Not normal enough to be part of the common people, not special enough to be part of the exceptional ones. He remembered Moriarty's words to Sherlock :
and the current case. Had this note been forgotten there by the maid and not left on purpose? Unlikely, but possible. What did a bamboo rat have anything to do with the murder? Or with John's disappearance?
want to just get on faster with the case. It had come at the perfect time; a time when Sherlock needed to take his mind off the whole relationship issue, a time when he needed to reaffirm the brilliancy of his mind which had quite spectacularly failed him in his deductions concerning John's feelings towards Maggie, and towards himself. All in all, a new case was Godsend.
John smiled, amused. Sherlock had no idea as to the motives of the woman, then. The consulting detective glared.
Two of the men handling a knife was easily taken care of, and Sherlock saw Victor disarm stun-gun man and knock him out as efficiently as he had the barmaid. The other three were another story, and they were closing in on them. Sherlock ended up back to back with Victor.
"Won't you stop grinning like a fool and massage me?" Sherlock whined, losing patience and getting more nervous by the minute.
Sherlock sighed. "So he was about to take it out for a walk. There's a leash that matches its collar near the door."
"Stop being so difficult," Sherlock said quietly into the fur of John's neck, and his caresses were so gentle, his touch so soothing, that the manul wondered if for once he shouldn't give in. All the more so as he heard, perhaps mistakenly, something like a request, if not a plea, in Sherlock's tone. He was being difficult, wasn't he? Suddenly some stupid joke didn't seem to matter in the least. John remembered the sheer panic he had felt upon hearing about the explosion of Brad Campbell's house. A wave of joy and relief washed over him, and something else, the feeling that he was very lucky. Sherlock was alive. He was alive, and he was holding him, accepting his company, wanting it, seeking it, as if John was a necessary part of him. And John felt grateful for it. The way they now so naturally cuddled was precious. Gradually, he felt his muscles relax under the warmth of Sherlock's hands, and rested his brow against Sherlock's collarbone.
Lestrade let out a resigned sigh, and wondered how Sherlock always managed to hail a cabbie so damn quickly.
You catch Seb's eyes as he looks up and you almost feel like the question is addressed to you. Which doesn't really make sense. Sebastian sings on.
John mewling back showed just how engrossed he was in whatever he was writing. Had he paid attention to the sounds he was making, he would surely have been mortified. Sherlock, on the other hand, revelled in it.
John groaned, and started to bury his face into the pillow, before realising it wasn't a pillow. Sherlock's chest. That was just too much.
John saw the only physical fight he'd had with Sherlock replay in his mind, that one on the street when he had asked him to punch him.
"John!" he exclaimed, standing up at once, a betrayed look on his face. Reproach was clear in his voice.
Wiggins had told you John had moved back to Baker Street. Thinking of this now was the last straw, and you threw up again. And cried. Every time you threw up, you cried, and cried, and cried. It was purely physiological, you didn't feel sad or lonely or anything like that – you felt nothing, nothing at all.
Suddenly he felt a tongue lap up the sole of his right foot, while a jam-coated hand palmed his left one. He yelped and bit his lower lip fiercely, desperately trying to muffle his moans.
Well, more than anything apart from the fact that he'd never see Sherlock again. John didn't know why the thought made him sick (literally). He had lost many mates in the war. But maybe precisely because it was the war, it was something to be expected. People die on the front. The army doctor himself risked his life and knew it. He'd lost patients. He'd lost friends. It enraged him and it hurt, but never did he feel such
So they rode and they rode and they rode, till they got out of the forest and found themselves at the edge of the sea. And on the water in front of them was a wide glistening path running straight out towards a beautiful thing that rose out of the water and went up into the sky, and was all the colours in the world, blue and red and green, and wonderful to look at.
"Your friend texted me," she said. She exchanged a look with Sherlock before turning back to John. "He said this was all a misunderstanding, and I was stupid enough to believe him..."
He obliged pleasantly, enjoying the way Sherlock slipped the tip of his tongue between his teeth to tickle the intruding fingers.
They grew to be geniuses in their own ways. They didn't know about each other – at least, Sherlock didn't. Little Jim had heard about that kid who claimed the missing shoes were crucial. He did remember his name, and typed it, years later, on the internet. A website came up: the Science of Deduction. "Consulting detective".
After you've taken your leave and Molly has promised to call tomorrow, you turn to Mary with an apologetic smile.
His eyes are locked with yours, but his face is so close you can feel the warmth of his breath on your throat. For a few seconds, you think he will give in. His breath is short; his face, flushed. You watch a drop of sweat – or is it still rain water? – trickle down his temple. His lips part and you think he will lean in again and truly kiss you this time, and you can find out how your body reacts to it. But he smiles and shakes his head.
"I'm sorry it turned out to be such an unpleasant drive. I guess you didn't get to enjoy the scenery very much..."
Sherlock looked genuinely surprised. Then he seemed to remember something, and his expression became thoughtful, almost questioning. John studied him closely.
In fact, he had spent a month bored to death in St Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, until he was told he could walk around safely. He hadn't specified he intended to chase criminals around London, but considered he'd wasted enough time already. He was lucky the bullet hadn't touched any bone or major nerve, or he'd still be stuck in hospital.
As always in the morning, Sherlock woke before John. He who had always found sleep dull and useless now wondered if sleep wasn't all about opening his eyes to John's slumbering form. It made him want to wake up again and again, John always the first thing he saw; John always the last thing he felt before falling in a world of dreams.
However, getting some very wet dreams, noticing every attractive physical detail (or rather, finding
"No, no. In fact, we do intend to get a divorce. It's just... Well, you know, it has to be two years... Anyway. But I'm not... ready. I won't ever be. I'm flattered, but–"
. But now, as he can feel Sherlock slipping away from his reach, it appears to be the only thing he can hold on to: something real, something that truly happened. It isn't about clearing his name or "spreading the word", as Joshua said. It's just about understanding – not the pain, not the grief, because there's no logic in that. But Sherlock was a logical man: understanding his logic means understanding
"What I mean is that I have to explore the sensations, and..." With his other hand, he traced an invisible line traversing John's chest, all the way down to his hipbone. "... I have to explore yours, too. But that's easier. I think I could be perfectly content if I always touched you, and was never touched."
"... that you've only ever been attracted to women before you met Sherlock Holmes. But now, you can't imagine sleeping with a woman again because you'd feel bad for her. So why don't you try men?"
[1] Hence your playing of the violin when you were expecting old Jim's little visit after his trial.
John was enjoying the hardness against his thigh and the wavering legs of his partner as he teased the two pink nipples unmercifully. He was finding Sherlock terribly endearing and was losing himself in the feel of his lips and of his body pressed against his. He could tell his friend wouldn't last long, and he was intent on making him orgasm on nipple stimulation alone. Sherlock was so new to this and his body was so damned sensitive that there was no need to rush things: in fact, John was very eager to put his virginity to good use. He'd never been with a virgin before, even less with a
"I'm going to ask you something Sherlock, and I need you to answer me. Nod or shake your head. That's all I'm asking. But you must answer me." He raised his hand holding the scalpel. His gaze hardened. "Am I going to need this?"
"He doesn't even try. He's busy," she answered. Sherlock, having forgotten their conversation, and the very fact that there had been a conversation, wondered what she was talking about.
Moran gives John a smile, and Sherlock is surprised to see it is genuine. Maybe all his smiles had been genuine.
You woke up with a start to the sound of thunder, breathless. The sheets of your bed were damp with sweat and your hotel room was colder than you recalled.
"Yes, right, because that would really have satisfied him as far as revenge was concerned. No, I knew he wanted to hurt me, and I just thought, to hell with it, I'm already black and blue, let's get this over with now. If Ana hadn't died of cancer, I would've blamed her death on him. After what I had made you go through, I knew he would want to hurt me in the worst possible way, and trust me, her death had hurt even more than that."
He was still limping though, and had told John he'd been stabbed in the leg in Copenhagen – which, on second thoughts, wasn't a very clever lie, since John was a
Irene merely arched an eyebrow. John had had enough. He jumped off the bed, ran to the door, and rapped on it desperately. Surely someone would hear. Someone h
You stare. Your brain has stopped functioning. You simply stare. Sherlock. It really is Sherlock. Seb is speaking again, but you barely register. You look at him, then at Sherlock again. Sherlock.
. He averts his gaze and the shame on his face is almost unbearable. You wish you could wipe it away. Wish you could just encircle his cold body and give him all the warmth you've got. But you know you can't do that. Not yet. Never, maybe. What you have is so fragile. Every word, every gesture counts, and could break the world of glass building around you. You don't want to hurt him. But you have to get him out of the hole he's been digging for himself.
Yet his irritation with Trevor came back full force when he entered the living-room to find their guest examining the skull. He had picked it up from the mantelpiece and was freely touching it. The way he moved about as if he owned the place was off-putting to say the least.
"Do you even realize the situation we're in? You'll end up in a cage, in a zoo! And I... They'll probably bring me to the police for keeping a tiger on a
"I'm not joking, though!" He leans back to look at you upside-down, pouting. "And don't give me the bashful virgin attitude, I'm not going to attack you or anything. Plus, I have a very cute girlfriend in France right now."
"Your coat is drenched," he goes on, putting it in the bathtub as well. He rubs the towel behind your ears, then along the line of your hair in your neck and above your brow. You want to ask him whether your kiss was any good. It probably wasn't, since he did not kiss back. You try to deduce what he thought of it by observing him as he dries your hair, but he keeps rubbing that towel on your head and over your face and it makes you want to bite. You frown and shake off the idea. He is just trying to help.
"She wasn't... as clever as you, not remotely, but she didn't have to be. Around her, I wanted to drop the mask, so I didn't need her to see through me. I didn't expect to meet anyone like that again. I..." He swallowed. "I didn't think I deserved to."
"Why did you buy such a book in the first place?" Mary laughed. "Planning on going on a trip to the jungle?"
Sherlock was so glad he had to repress a triumphant smirk. He was still terrified and felt like he was walking on thin ice, but he was determined to get John to talk. And when supplementary data was needed, Sherlock was quite unscrupulous as to the means to get it.
. It had been so long since he had felt any that he was at a loss and almost failed to recognize it.
He stands and goes to the kitchenette to make some tea. Every time he does so he is reminded of Mrs. Hudson. He should feel terrible about not going to see her or not even sending her any note as to his whereabouts, but all he feels is sharp pain. Anything related to Baker Street is like a shot – and John would know. A very special kind of bullet though, that doesn't kill you even if you're riddled, and leaves you hanging.
Trembling, Sherlock was trying to keep his distance because his waist and thighs and legs felt disgusting and sticky, and he didn't want John to be dirtied because of him. Noticing him drawing back, John frowned and cupped Sherlock's face, locking their eyes.
"It matters not how strait the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll..." Sebastian paused for emphasis, and finished theatrically, his tone laced with irony: "I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul."
Lestrade shivered. What could Mycroft possibly have filmed that could be used as a threat? He had always thought he had nothing to hide, but now he was very anxious to see what the elder Holmes had devised for him. He clicked on the video file nervously.
Your eyes have remembered the numbers and letters on the cab's licence plate but again your legs have been faster still. Here, take a right, avoid the main road.
[1] Main characters from Les Liaisons dangereuses (The Dangerous Liaisons), a French epistolary novel by Choderlos de Laclos, first published in 1782. It is the story of the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont, two rivals (and ex-lovers) who use sex as a weapon to humiliate and degrade others, all the while enjoying their cruel games. It has been claimed to depict the decadence of the French aristocracy shortly before the French Revolution, thereby exposing the perversions of the so-called Ancien Régime. However, it has also been described as a vague, amoral story. {from Wikipedia}
and rolled onto his side, effectively tripping the poor boy who fell flat on his face, cursing loudly. The man jolted, faking outrage and crying out, alerting the hostesses who rushed to their side. Rubbing his head, Jérémie tried to get up but found that he was stuck and had to be picked up by two crew members like a little child. Humiliated, he turned a death glare to the devious stranger, only to find him looking all lost and confused, as if he had indeed just been disturbed in his sleep by a clumsy teenager.
But he had, after all, a lot on his mind, and even he wasn't sure whether he should be wasting his breath on the case when he had much more important things to discuss with Sherlock. Maybe this was neither the time nor the place for such a conversation, but still John wanted to make sure they would get time later for such a talk. Before he could think too much about it and let his courage deflate, John turned to his friend.
"Don't you have anything better to do?" a voice asked, disturbing the quietness Irene had woven around her in the tearoom.
"Listen, John, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I really think you should start seeing someone again."
John moves on the bed and switches to your left foot, then to your ankle, and slowly goes up. Shin, knee, thigh...
He looked up at her sharply. Their eyes met and she squeezed his hand. She had sounded so much like him.
"I just told you. In fact, I told you last week," John said, walking to the kitchen and opening the cupboard to get the wine he'd bought in the morning. Sherlock followed him.
"I won't see you tomorrow. I'm staying with Maggie until the 27th. We're going to her sister's tomorrow, remember? I told you that, too."
"I wouldn't have jumped, Sherlock. I would've tried to stop Moriarty, have him arrested even, perhaps killed, whatever the risk. I would have wanted to win whatever the cost."
With some hesitation, John complied. Sherlock smiled and brushed the fur of his cheeks with the back of his hand before stroking his belly. For some reason, this appeared to make John tense even more.
"You make it so obvious," she went on, glancing at the name on the bottle. Then she looked up into his eyes. "Everyone who cares to look would know he's your Achilles' heel."
His inner voice and Sherlock's resonating in the room – or so it seemed anyway – were beginning to give him a serious headache.
But John does eat, and quite earnestly so. Admittedly it ends up under the smiley face on his toilet, but still, he prepares his three meals per day, and swallows them. Then throws them up. And the next day swallows them again.
From then onwards, they met regularly at what really became "their" pub. Every time John asked more and more about Sherlock. The poor man was obviously obsessed. Greg couldn't blame him. He answered his questions when he could, told him about Sherlock's past cases. It was painful to see how John drank his words, appeared to physically
Mary bursts out laughing. "I bet you're not used to it! People pointing a gun at you." Her laughter quiets down. "John is full of surprises, isn't he?"
The guest list of other near-by accommodation had not been any more conclusive. Nor had been the staff. Unless, of course, one of them had been one of Sherlock's informants. In the end, there was no way to know, and for once that he had managed to locate Sherlock, Mycroft was quite upset about not being able to get more out of it.
Sherlock still jolted when John spread the lube over his thighs and buttocks, but John was wise enough to make no comment about it. He concentrated on massaging instead, his touch becoming lighter – a caress. Slowly, he went up from the thighs to the middle of the back, then down again. He worked out the tighter knots that had resisted his massage, linking the back, buttocks and thighs together again, sending stirring quivers throughout them, making Sherlock shiver again and again until the detective could finally feel his body as a whole and stop cutting himself off from sensations.
If looks could kill, Moriarty would have been long gone. But John's eyes now became even darker, if that was possible at this point. Sherlock hated the way his nemesis taunted his flatmate and how powerless John must have felt. There really was nothing at all he could do about this.
It renders you speechless. Could you have been more clueless? Your eyes stop on the bags under hers. You shouldn't have believed her when she said all was fine. Of course it hadn't been fine.
Sherlock let John cosset him as he pleased, rather enjoying the attention. From an outer point of view, it still seemed utterly grotesque to him: people snogging did not make sense, never did, and never would.
You don't really listen to the lyrics. You don't really hear the music. Before you know it, you have fallen asleep.
Well, I knew what effect it had had on a superior mind, so I needed to try it on an average one. You know what I mean. - But it wasn't
Slowly, John moved towards the door and listened. He could hear people talk in another room, probably the kitchen as he heard the clatter of knives and forks. But they were too far away for him to make out what they were saying. He looked up to the door handle and searched the darkness of the room for some kind of furniture – a chest of drawer, a bed,
"You've been wondering how it would feel, haven't you?" he murmurs. Another chuckle. "I can tell when you're curious about something. You should have just asked."
"I could have HIV from birth; or hepatitis B or C or even A considering some of the places I've been to."
"I leave for two days, and this is how I find you? Really, Sherlock..." Moran petted his hair soothingly, relishing the smoothness of the black curls – relishing the iciness of the ear and cheek, revelling in the silent cries.
Yes, Carl Powers. Carl Powers minus the pool. That leaves only poison. Or the lab. But John never went to Bart's anymore. Had no reason to go there. There was still Mike. And Molly. Seb could find a way. Sherlock had already given Shinwell and the Irregulars his instructions – if John went to Bart's, he would know.
Sherlock scoffed. "I never said I was sorry." He sneaked a well-oiled hand in John's trousers and fondled his crotch. John cried out in surprise.
Sherlock was sprawled on the couch, his posture regal, and waited until Mrs. Hudson brought him his coffee there. The infuriating tiger still managed to take the mug between his two paws to drink in a human-like manner. John, on the other hand, had to sit on one of the kitchen chairs, his two front paws on the table, and lap his tea from a bowl. He was trying to communicate to dear Mrs. Hudson that he couldn't possibly eat a whole slice of toast without it being cut to pieces when Sherlock, growing bored alone in the living-room, entered the kitchen. Taking in the scene, he went to a drawer and pulled it open with his teeth. Carefully picking a knife up between the points of two of his very sharp teeth, he carried it to their landlady. She started a bit, but then understood, and finally cut the toast into smaller morcels.
John stared with wide eyes. Sherlock caught his gaze and froze. They stood there for a few seconds, and time seemed to have stopped.
Mycroft smirked almost fondly. "A pet to which you keep extending a hand and who bites back," he confirmed.
"Miss Danes, I know exactly what key it is, and so do these gentlemen. May I please have the cards now?"
, really dancing, or at least he was, as Moriarty held him, still wriggling his hips and waving his body. He could feel his enemy's cold hands on his buttocks, not gripping, but simply lying there. A reminder of his ownership, simple and sober. Most of all Sherlock could feel how
, and since he hadn't made a grand entrance, he'd probably decided he should be striking in his leaving the room –
That night after they'd come back from the pool, Sherlock had stayed behind the door of John's bedroom until morning. He hadn't said anything, nor had he made his presence known in any way; he even took the trouble to climb the steps extremely quietly. But John was a soldier and knew when someone was looming right in front of his room. He'd almost opened the door to tell his friend he was fine and he should get some rest instead of just standing there in the dark, but he'd feared the detective's reaction. He didn't want it to seem like he was rejecting him in any way, not when he had reproached him for his detachment just a few hours ago – and especially not when Moriarty had so blatantly implied that he was Sherlock's heart. Or what made him realise he had one, anyway.
He helped Sherlock out of bed, holding his arm in case his wobbly legs gave way under him, but the consulting detective sent him a condescending look and walked alone towards the bathroom, his gait dignified.
"I just didn't want you to take the stairs in the underground, and we're too late to take a bus – I'm not even sure we'll arrive on time."
The cold hand that suddenly lay on his abdomen made him gasp and he started panting. He wondered briefly if that was actually hyperventilating, but dropped the matter as there were obviously other priorities at hand.
You've had very bad hangovers in your life, but nothing can compare to the hammering headache you wake up with this morning.
Suddenly the room was filled with light and Sherlock recoiled, stepped back, tried to hide, anywhere, away from John's gaze.
Slowly, very gently, Mary snuggles closer to you and embraces your cold body, resting your head on her shoulder. You take a deep breath.
His deep baritone voice broke the silence and he enjoyed how the very light tinge of mockery in it seemed to shatter Moran's skilfully woven web.
And so they did. Sherlock turned on the water and sent John a questioning look to see if the temperature was good. John nodded and smiled reassuringly. He was worried, but he knew that he must not let Sherlock settle in a mindset where he despised his own body and refused to take showers. That wouldn't do. He was intimately convinced that the best way to help Sherlock right now was to stop him every time he tried to run away from the fear and to show him he still had control over things. Otherwise powerlessness and hopelessness would eventually overwhelm him, and John certainly never wanted to see that.
"Goodnight, Sherlock," John murmured, and Sherlock could feel his friend's heart hammer in his chest, against his own. He smiled unwittingly, and spontaneously stroked John's hair to slow down his heart beats.
John closed the door behind them as Sherlock stripped of his coat and jacket. His shirt was hardly wet at all, except around the collar. Again, he felt John's eyes on him, but when he looked up, his flatmate averted his gaze. Sherlock's eyes turned to slits. That was... interesting.
John couldn't hear the words, but got the message. He felt stupid for acting so miffed that early in the morning. Lowering himself, he rested his brow against Sherlock's, closing his eyes so as not to think about it too much.
It was thanks to John that Sherlock had become so famous. Because of the doctor's blog, he had received many clients, and his talents as a consulting detective had been given an even wider scope. However that wasn't something his brother had ever wished – he didn't care. Did not give a damn about what other people thought. He just didn't bother. John, on the other hand, did. And now he must have been feeling guilty and completely responsible for his best friend's death. Mycroft could picture it from here: 'If only I hadn't written about him on my blog, if only I hadn't barged into his life and made him an internet phenomenon, if only, if only... if only he had never met me, he would still be alive.'
John glowered and was about to turn back haughtily when a delicious smell hit him. That's when he realized Sherlock had been cooking. Curious, he jumped onto a kitchen chair and tried to see what was being prepared.
"He doesn't even try. He's busy." The room was endowed with only what was strictly necessary, which apparently included a rather important wardrobe and several suitcases whose contents were not visible. "So what if your henchman noticed me? It's not as if he didn't already know you were staying just across the street from his target."
Seb shrugged, but groped for his cigarette packet on his bedside table, and lit one before answering:
That's better. I'm sure you'll say something about the tone, but if we do get a case because of it, you'll be happy enough.
"He's an adult, John! He can take care of himself. Can't you even stay away from him for a week-end?"
he was holding to run off in a hurry, his hat falling in the process without his noticing, or at least bothering to retrieve it. She had seen no pursuer and had found the matter so puzzling that she thought it might interest the detective. While she had him on the phone, she invited him over for Christmas dinner. She planned to cook the goose.
"Fine! Several times these past three weeks a man has come to pick up Dr. Farquhar at his practice at unreasonable hours, and brought him back very late at night, or very early in the morning. The man has always come late, after closing hours. The first time he came it was just before the doctor closed for the night. Mycroft says he saw him because he lives on the same floor as Dr. Farquhar. Wait, Mycroft lives in a
Lestrade did not come in the end, and Sherlock refused to let John go out alone to meet him. John indulged him.
"Yes, Sherlock. But we can do a lot of talking, right? I won't manage it in Morse code, though, especially not if I have to concentrate on the concerto too."
Sherlock's eyes snapped open and they locked with John's. The doctor suddenly realized he was sprawled naked on their living-room's floor. Panicked, he jumped to his feet with a yelp, grabbing the Union Jack pillow to hide his genitalia. He pointed his finger at Sherlock and cried in outrage:
This time the caustic tone in Mycroft's voice made Sherlock look over his shoulder and lock eyes with his brother. He grinned sardonically.
"Sherlock!" John finally shouted once he had found his voice. The violence and the abruptness of Sherlock's gesture had only enhanced the pleasure John felt: he could never have guessed how
"Why are you doing this?" you repeat, more softly. You're at a loss. The man before you is still Seb, still the same old Seb you thought you knew. Yet here he is, threatening to shoot you.
“Is that why you bought the rope? You were trying to coax me into this! Get me in a good mood just to ruin it! John, that is emotional manipulation! I can’t believe you!” Sherlock threw his hands around in mock astonishment causing John to chuckle.
“You were looking for me? Why is that?” John instantly thought he had done something wrong. Surely the prince was angry that he dragged them out of Aponi.
“Welcome ladies and gentlemen to our home. We would like to make this a pleasant stay for you, so if anyone has a question or request don’t hesitate to ask. Now then, you will receive a key for your rooms shortly, then you are to meet us in the dining hall where we will resume our greetings.” A man called out then everyone shuffled about. Sherlock slipped away from his mother’s grasp and escaped to the hallway.
“What’s this mess about?” Irene stepped into the room with the most noise. Either someone was fighting or someone was doing dares.
He wishes he could climb onto the stage and pull the boy off, to kiss him multiple times, to smother him with his attention, yet when he thinks of the reality of those wishes, he changes his mind. Privacy would be best.
“Ladies, calm down.” Lady Hudson walked into the room and the commotion died off. She carried a basket with needles and yarn in it. “Come now, our dear prince has called for my assistance. Let’s see who knows how to knit.” She smiled her elderly smile and walked out.
“Of course not! Especially not to one of these- ladies.” Sherlock flung an arm upwards to emphasize his point.
“No” Johns gaze became predatory as his eyes darkened with delight. Whatever overcame him in that second caused him to lose control. In a flash he bent down and attacked the pale flesh of an unprepared neck. Sherlock jumped in response to the sudden change. John took advantage of the moment and bit down, gaining a whimper from his prey.
“John, you are going to take a little kip. Maybe when you wake up, we can do one of those boring pedestrian things, like sitting by the fire.” Sherlock hated parenting John, but John would be very displeased knowing he acted like this.
A lanky elderly gentleman walked in and cleared his throat. Sherlock sighed as he announced their menu. Fruits from around their country were brought out. Unique shapes and splashes of color sat around the table.
The buzz of excitement shot through the kitchen, busting through the silence of the surrounding rooms. Experiment after experiment were performed in the early hours of the morning. Too much to do. There’s always too much to do, but isn’t that entertaining? The bustle brought about by a deadline. The energy rushing through your veins from the anxiety of being late! The overeager emotions wanting to burst at the thought of being a success! It was all too much, yet not enough. Not enough. Never enough.
“Sherlock did you hear me?” His mother wiped her eyes from tears and cleared her throat. “Sherlock it’s time for your brunch with the ladies.” She continued. Sherlock moaned in distress.
“That’s not odd at all. I miss my father. It’s a natural thing to feel when someone has passed.” The knight tried to show him his reasoning, but it seemed to be brushed away.
“Well?” Mrs. Watson looks to her son. Her warm eyes carry her lips smile. John feels his cheeks heat up as he feels his mother’s stare on him.
“I would send you nowhere, Watson.” Holmes held my eyes, unaware that within his grasp was my heart, as well. “You have proven yourself to be a man of incomparable loyalty and character, and I would do my utmost to preserve our friendship through any difficulty. I am...humbled, to learn—and to keep secret—your nature, but know, my dear fellow, that it sends not a wave against the dam.”
“There’s next to nothing of value about Mr. Ables’s new lover. Nothing that could point to his identity, or his appearance, or even his personality.”
“As no one could examine your place of residence better than you, I would ask you to search it top to bottom for any clues to your brother’s whereabouts.”
“We will both be going to hospital, but he needs more urgent care.” I finally tore my gaze from Holmes’s face to look at the constable standing beside me, frowning down at the unconscious men lying around us. “Constable. Alert Inspector Lestrade. Tell them that Sherlock Holmes has been attacked, and that I know who is responsible.”
“My father.. wasn’t a happy man.” John’s face darken as his eyes clouded over with understanding. “My father drank.. he drank everything away. They almost didn’t let him serve his king. Do you think that’s why he saved him? That’s why he did it, to show off, to prove a point.” Johns sullen attitude bubbled into rage as he worked through his father’s actions. “He left us, he left, because he wasn’t happy! He could have been treated, he could have lived a good life at home with mum. He chose to break apart our family.” John quickly jumped to his feet so he could pace.
Sherlock wrapped the beautiful silk rope around Johns wrists before tying him to the bed. The rules were simple. No touching yourself throughout this. It’s a game, of course, to see who can last the longest without giving in.
“Oh, hush, you know perfectly well that they can’t pin this on us. Now, be quiet, and help me.” Irene’s red stained lips formed into a menacing smirk.
“Who cares about some yarn and needles? This is stupid. What skill does it even take to knit?” Alessia chimed in. She didn't care about this or the princes absence. Did she really have to deal with this? “Irene, want to go find some trouble with me?” She stood up and headed to the door.
Once inside he observed the people that shuffled about. A rather large table sat in the middle of the elegant room. Silver objects and platters filled its top. Sherlock sat at the end of the table. A nervous smile met him wherever he looked. Most of the ladies were accounted for, except for one.
John needs to survive each level their new toy offers for ten minutes. Each level gets ten minutes. There are ten different levels of intensity. John took a deep breath in as Sherlock lubed his fingers.
“I can assure you, I am quite capable of feeding myself.” Sherlock’s bored words shot up at the woman in red. With a smirk of victory, Irene squeezed his shoulder then returned to her seat receiving flares from around the table.
A single light shines down on the lonesome boy with the white tights. John leans forward without realizing it. The boys dark curls have been combed, but they still fall lazily around his face, causing a faint grin to trace Johns lips. The boy wears snow white tights that match his white and gold princes top. He pops his leg out towards the stilled crowd, his features appear emotionless. As soon as a variation of Nutcracker’s Prince begins to play, he loses himself to the music.
“I’m fine.” He said. “Thank you, John. I look forward to our acquaintance..” Sherlock wasn’t given a chance to finish his conversation. A messenger came into the room to announce Enola was ready to go. Sherlock sighed then trudged off. John awkwardly looked around the room until Greg reminded him he needed to follow along. Once he caught up with the prince, a mischievous grin met him.
“John, I don’t want to go.” Sherlock groaned and slung his limbs off the sides of the couch. John picked up some of his chemistry notes and placed them on the table.
“I believe you meant to say, how dreadful..” Sherlock corrected him while rolling his eyes. Mycroft opened his mouth to respond, but a woman followed by four men walked in and rushed to Sherlock’s side.
“I thought you would want privacy on your.. date. I guess that was my bad. I’m sorry, your highness, this is my first day of this job.” John stumbled over his words before sarcasm hit.
“Excuse me?” John only spoke three dialects, he could pick up on her words, but wasn’t sure what she said. Enola stopped for a moment to catch her breath and rephrased her words- this time speaking in the language he could understand.
Sherlock let out a sigh against John's lips, unknowingly offering to further the kiss. As soon as he started kissing back, John pushed him down onto the bed. He pulled away to ask “is this okay?” to which Sherlock only nodded. The lump inside his throat grew as John latched onto his exposed neck. His lips grazed the soft skin, his tongue darted out to tease, his teeth made an appearance and bit. He sucked marks into the sensitive skin, claiming. Claiming, why is he claiming?
“Evening..” Sherlock forced a smile as he passed through the doorway. John kept a few steps behind him as they neared the lady of the hour.
Sherlock watched Johns chest rise and fall as he took in a few calming breaths. After making sure to thoroughly slick up himself, he placed his index finger at Johns entrance. Usually he’d ask if John was ready, he’d be gentle, he say something sweet, but tonight was about endurance. Pleasure would inevitably come later, but right now in this moment, he needed to keep focused.
The princesses stared at her in silence. Was this a challenge? A new test? Why would they care if they could knit? Why was this important?
Hoping no one would see him slip out he followed the hall until he found another large room. Many guards and knights walked past him and bowed to which he awkwardly said wasn’t necessary. He felt the random pains of regret as his thoughts trailed to his wedding.
“Yes, now. I plan on utilizing every hour of this afternoon. If I’m going to do everything I want, we need to start now.” Sherlock shot back as he reached his door.
Not everybody gets to come home for Christmas. Not everyone gets to fall in love. Not everybody has the love of their life waiting at home for them. Not everyone gets to go home and stuff a vibrator up the love of their life’s arse.
“My alien features are easy to find in a crowd. Besides, people only know who I am because of my father.” Sherlock scoffed at the thought. “I’m not important to my kingdom, my mother doesn’t need me. I’m a pawn, I’m here to get married off for political gain.” He rolled his eyes while he spoke.
“Hey, excuse yo-“ Sherlock’s protests were cut off by the sight before him. John was in his pajamas, but wore Sherlock’s deep blue robe. He smelt of mints, he must have brushed the alcohol out of his mouth. John saw where his eyes went, and smirked. A second later and John was standing up so he could climb into his lap. With both knees on either side of Sherlock’s thighs, John ran his fingers into the brunettes curls.
“Refer to me as Sherlock and all is forgiven. Oh, please do not bow. I deal with enough of that in one hour.” Sherlock scoffed as he took in this newcomers appearance. The man before him held a tan glow to his skin that brought out the blue of his eyes. “What’s your name knight?”
“Stay still young master, this will only take a moment.” Lady Hudson adjusted the collar of Sherlock’s shirt.
“I’m glad you did, because when I went out, I forgot to buy some. Come along John.” Sherlock spun around to head back to their room.
“Because you are different.” Sherlock said then stood. “I will fetch you in a bit. For now, please enjoy the rest of your meal. I have some entertaining to do elsewhere.” As he walked away something faint thumped his back. A grape rolled passed his foot. The ladies snickered behind him.. that’s when all hell broke loose.
“His name is Greg. Do what you’d like sweetheart. I’m terrible busy with your brother. There’s been word that the Kineks are planning an invasion of a city around our borders. We haven’t figured out which city yet, but Chenoa is a good guess. Many of our resources come through there, so I’m betting they will attack them first.” The queen traced her finger alongside the map. The prince stood to look at it with them.
“But aren’t all ears listening ears?” Johns eyebrow shot upwards, almost connecting with his hairline.
“He’s clearly into men! At one point, he completely avoided me just to talk to his tiny knight!” Enola felt drained, you could hear it in her accented voice.
“I put your clothes away in the closet. You can change later.” Sherlock bent down and laid John onto the bed. When he pulled away, John grabbed his arm to pull him back down.
Sherlock plopped down onto the couch and pulled out his phone. He tapped away at the keys, ignoring the commotion from the others. A few minutes later, the couch dipped beside him and his phone was plucked out of his hands.
“Alright, thanks.” John let himself be led to Sherlock’s bedroom. His eyes began to shut as they walked through the door. He mustn’t have realized it, but soon he was leaning his head against Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Take a break, John. I’ll be back shortly.” Sherlock turned the little devil, that was still inside John, to the lowest setting. Panic crept its way into Johns system at the thought of being tied up and alone.
“Is this alright?” John whispered into his ear. Another nod passed between them and John was biting and kissing his skin. His hand worked its way to the buttons, then into his pants, until nothing was between them. John wanted it. He wanted it all. He was done waiting. John didn’t stop, he pulled Sherlock’s pants down in one swift motion, then kissed his way down from Sherlock’s chest, torso, stomach, to the base of his length.
“What do you mean, he’s not into any of us?” Ludovica asked with great suspicion. Realizing she couldn’t back down from her statement, she gave in.
The curtain draws back almost at the same time that he leans against the wall. A hand reaches out, fists his shirt, then pulls him behind the curtain. Next thing John knows, he’s being kissed in a poorly lit, very tight, changing cubby.
“No, not for me. I’m not like that.” Sherlock glanced at the wooden desk, then made his way to it, only to trace his fingers along a books seams. “I’m no good at this, but what I am saying is, I don’t typically feel things. At least not the way others do. I’m much more different than people think.” The prince sighed after he spoke.
John threw his head back against the pillow. Sherlock had left him with that stupid vibrator up his arse for thirty minutes! Thirty minutes of stimulation and no way to stop the constant throb of his erection. Thirty minutes of torture. Thirty minutes of pleasure.
Enola brushed everyone off and made her way to the couch. After plopping herself, not so gracefully, down onto it, she let out a deep sigh.
“John, I’m sure he didn’t think about that. He wouldn’t have wanted to break your family apart.” The prince felt as if his lungs were caving in on themselves. His purpose of bringing him here, wasn’t to break the man, but to learn more. Clearly, he’s got enough information, now it’s time to go.
“Goodbye prince!” John called out as they walked off. Sherlock felt his face heat up as he thought of a pair of blue eyes he just met. What had gotten into him?
“So what are we doing here? This was supposed to be a high honor, but with the information you just gave us, it doesn’t seem but a lucky coincidence that we are here. If I’m to stay all week, may I at least know our schedule?” Janine spoke with a mixture of intensity and sheer boredom.
“Morning” John rubbed his hand over his face as he entered the kitchen, making his way to the sink. His motions were slow, but rehearsed as he prepared his daily tea. Sherlock glanced up from his slides. “You’ve already made yourself a cup, or was that Miss Hudson? We really should get her something for all her troubles. Last week she told me that you broke her mother’s vase… how did you manage to do that?” John lifted the cup to his lips. Yes, drink it.
Sherlock paced around the kitchen with his hands behind his back. Questions. Too many questions. Too many negative outcomes. Too much regret. Waiting is always the worst part of any experiment.
The detective pulled out until only his tip was still connected to John, then pushed back in with the determination of a madman. He kept at this until both he and John were red in the face and sweat began to form on their temples.
“Come on guys! Since you guys are late, the others have already arrived and taken most of the bunks. Irene has started passing out drinks, so you may want to get in before they’re all taken.” Molly ushered them inside through the large wooden door.
“Even while fighting in the war? You never encounter such people? Aren’t they beautiful? I thought the men you fought with would have at least given you an opportunity to venture out.” Sherlock rambled on, ignoring the questioning stare of his knight.
“Sherlock are you feeling ill?” Greg felt Sherlock’s forehead. “Your cheeks are bright red! Maybe you should sit down.” Greg teased knowing where the blush came from. Sherlock cleared his throat.
and that I would be the only man alive privileged to their contours, electrified me like a bolt of lightning.
Peter gaped. "Friendless and—my goodness." His features creased in regret. "I had no idea. I...will see what I can do." He exchanged glances with Johann. "I'm not lonely. The farthest thing from it. And I...I know he would like you, given the opportunity." Peter swallowed visibly. "Come home with me? To meet him?"
Worthy was puce with rage, one hand clutching his bloodied arm and the other leveled in a bee line at my head. I flinched, ducking down and cursing as one of his bullets sent my hat flying from my brow.
The partners turned to face us, and the sight of them made my stomach sink in dread. There was a madness, glinting in their eyes. An intensity shared between them, born not just of devotion, but something deeper that I did not yet understand. The woman had nearly poisoned herself, nearly out of protest.
“Very well, sir. I will note this…behavior in my report, but comfort yourself with the knowledge I will mark you down as cooperative.” He narrowed his gaze. “Providing you have told us everything.”
Holmes pressed his lips together, an edge twisting in a mischievous smile. “That, my dear Watson, was a fabrication. England’s best bloodhound could not have detected anything but the stench of tobacco in
Holmes’s gaze moved up to where mine tracked the darkness broiling on the horizon. “Hmm,” he said. “Perhaps you are right, Watson. I do not like letting the trail grow colder, but...” Thunder boomed at the edges of the evening sky, the faint crackle of lightning weaving through the clouds like a glowing spider’s web. “At first light, then.”
The man was perhaps fifteen, twenty years older than myself. His short, fine hair was grey and making its way to white near his temples. His beard was clipped close to the face and the color of ashy snow, and a pair of silver, stout spectacles sat perched on the end of his long, red-tipped nose. The man wore an expression of weary misery on his lightly wrinkled face, and greeted us with a muted degree of welcome. His eyes, however, absorbed most of my attention: they were dark as coal behind his glasses, piercing above bruising, sleepless circles.
a low voice issued in my mind. And it was not the cultured voice of Holmes that spoke to me now, but a mirror of my own, cold and sharp.
in fact carry my own things,” Holmes said, eyes glimmering above his scarf. “Your healing techniques, as it turns out, have some merit...”
“But if that’s the case, then who? The murderess simply cannot be Ms. Tarlton or the housekeeper,” Hopkins said frustratedly. “Neither of them require corrective lenses!”
“Mr. Holmes,” I interrupted, before a row between the country’s two greatest minds could wage war in my sitting room. “Forgive me, but I must be blunt. Your brother
"I wondered the same thing myself, Dr. Watson," Ms. Tarlton said, bright-eyed. "You have a logical mind, sir." In the corner of my eye, I thought I saw Holmes's face twitch. I was flummoxed myself: rarely was that word affixed to me, especially when I stood next to its paragon. "But evidently, it is a matter of pride. The professor, his strength wanes, but he is intent on remaining mobile, Doctor, even if he is not capable of walking down the stairs without Mortimer at his arm."
But more than anything, I wanted none of it to have happened at all. I wanted it all to be a dream. That, perhaps, was why I couldn’t bear to go to sleep. There was no deeper despair than going to bed and waking in the morning to a nightmare that had not ended. That would never end.
“I even found somethin’! ‘idden beneath Peter’s bed! ‘E told me not to look under there and I always listened even when I didna want to, but I s’posed now was alright, and look!”
curious.” He looked up at me, eyes sparkling. “This case really is the most exceptional way to end a holiday, Watson. I could hardly have wanted for better.”
"Be careful," said Holmes, expression tight. Yesterday, the thread of concern for me would have rattled me to my core. Now, it only fueled my determination to see this done, and to see out what would become of us, now that the truth of our affections had been shared.
“I thought you were never coming back round,” Thomas Farrow crowed. I shared a look with a curious Holmes, and ambled my way to my friend’s side. At the sight of my friend, Thomas’s eyes sparked with mischief.  “And look, miracles come in pairs! You devil, you’ve brought a plus one!”
On the other side of the door, Holmes sounds oddly tentative. It is a strange thing, for him to seek me in my rooms so early in the morning without a case to encourage him. Within my ribcage, the flutter that had kicked up in my chest at my reminiscing picks up like a hummingbird.
“I will drink to that,” Quincey said approvingly, and lifted his pointer and middle finger at Johann. “Some whiskys, barman.”
could barely manage to drag you up the stairs! I will not get into this with you again, Holmes. We are going on holiday, you’re going to put on at
I thought, and in a fit of sudden, terrible rage, I seized the pipe and hurled it at the mantle. The second it left my fingertips, regret struck my gut like a blow, and the crack of it against the fireplace siding daggered my stomach with dread. I lurched, stricken, from my seat and staggered to where it lay fallen upon the hardwood. I bent, fingers brushing around the pipe and lifting it with apologetic slowness.
“Watch him, my dear?” Coram asked, and with the hand not pointing a pistol at my chest, he gently lifted his wife into the car beside me.
leaf. You know how I pride myself on the identification of tobacco leaf and ash. The cigarettes were Sobranie. Combined with the photographs of the Ural mountains in the ground floor hallway and Coram's peculiar vocal tic, I determined he was Russian himself.”
Holmes, in a rare display of vivid boyishness, rolled his eyes. “We shall see, brother. But for now you will have to see us off, or Watson will be forced to take drastic measures.”
“The maid is prepared to swear that those were the exact words,” Hopkins intoned. “He tried desperately to say something else, and he held his right hand up in the air, perhaps reaching for her. But he fell back dead before he managed it, or another word. She ran for the cottage in the back of the estate, and after waking the housekeeper and Mortimer they dashed back to the house to wake the professor. They found him sitting up in bed, horribly agitated, for he had heard enough to convince him that something terrible had occurred. However, his physical state left him unable to get out of bed alone to see for himself what had transpired. Mortimer and Susan both swear he was still in his night-clothes, and indeed, that it’s impossible for him to dress or leave bed without the gardener’s assistance.”
“Good idea,” I said, through a fixed, casual smile, and tried not to let my expression shatter as Holmes unexpectedly took my arm and we moved together further into the establishment.
I lifted an eyebrow, and swallowed the sudden and mad impulse to laugh. It did not precisely surprise me that Holmes had attempted to seduce me before even knowing what it meant, or truly how to do so, but it did, on some level, inspire amusement. The most intelligent man in all England, and he hadn’t a clue how to court. “Our friendship has its intimacies, Holmes, but there are things we do not do that other couples perform. Assuming that
Luckily, my experience in an army barracks still enabled me to rise and dress with speed, even if years of laziness had softened my other service habits. Winding a scarf around my neck as I made my way downstairs, I found Holmes sitting at a table in the inn’s dining hall, two piping cups of tea before him bookending a plate of buttered toast with marmalade.
“Tonight, then?” I said, knots furling in my chest. The apprehension I felt at bringing Holmes to such a place, knowing he could be immediately recognized, was mounting the more I considered it. I knew that no manner of argument would deter him, but still I wished he would leave the task to myself alone. The Cleveland Street business still tainted perceptions of us in the press, and Italy’s legalization of homosexuality had seemingly bolstered our country’s resistance to tolerance rather than softening it. Holmes, even if unaware of the Circle itself, was likely well-versed in the corruption that proliferated the Yard where invert-friendly pubs were concerned. There was every chance that this very night, the Circle could be raided. I had faced and feared that very possibility each night I went out, but the idea that Holmes’s face could be painted across the
“I do see,” I agreed, mouth twitching at the play of words. Holmes’s eyes rolled to the ceiling, long-suffering, which only broadened my amusement. “I confess, however, I’m unable to understand how you would arrive at the double visit to the optician.”
And yet, my feet dragged on the street, and my heart sent heated little pulses in remembrance of the soft look Holmes shared with me when he left.
“It’s not that,” I hissed under my breath. “Heaven’s sake, Holmes, for all your powers, you cannot tell me you haven’t noticed?”
“Are you a representative of this damned railway company?” the man interrupted, voice going sharp as his attention was roused. “Because I have a complaint or two for you, sir!”
At any rate, I dismissed Holmes's curious expression: his friendship has made a reluctant skeptic out of me, and I found it easier on the whole to have faith in his abilities and see the truth carried out in due time.
We entered the manor quickly, and its interior proved to be as plain and cheerless as its outside. While there was nary a floorboard unpolished or bannister undusted, the wooden skeleton of the home was dark and uninspired; the home was dreadfully dim. As a doctor, I could not help but disapprove of such darkness in the home of man convalescing. Sunlight was a remarkable restorative, for the mind, body, and heart.
I blinked as from behind Mrs. Hudson, a large, rare figure emerged from the hall to fill the door-frame.
There were men out there who could be responsible, in some way, for Holmes’s demise. Blackguards who would have happily shoved him off the precipice under Moriarty’s orders themselves. The idea was so unacceptable that my entire body seemed paralyzed with it, with horror and injustice and a rage so monstrous and painful that I could scarcely see. My hands spasmed with sudden violence, fingers twitching for the handle of my service pistol. If one of them stood in front of me now—
I quelled the desire once more to sigh loudly and at length, and resigned to delivering a scowl his direction. “If you detach yourself from me, you will find yourself surrounded by potential suitors faster than a pin dropping.”
Pulse fluttering like a hummingbird had been let loose in my blood, I carefully stepped closer. In a handful of footsteps, I eliminated the distance between us, and I was finally near enough to feel the heat of his body once more, looking into his eyes with every cell in my body tense in anticipation.
The moment passed, however, at the faint thread of cursing emanating through the floorboards, and I exhaled a sigh of relief. Distant memories of gunfire and the Afghan fields withdrew their cold fingers from my mind, and my thoughts turned hotly to the floor below. Annoyance dousing the adrenaline in my blood, I threw off my bedcovers, seized my morning robe, and shrugged into it on my way downstairs.
“I implore you, for your own sake, to consider testifying. It will be your only salvation, madam. Repentance, I’m afraid, must be found on your own terms.” Holmes turned to Hopkins. “Without drawing much attention, inspector, I would ask you to have one of your constables ready a carriage. Within the quarter hour, you should have the culprit in your hands, and they will require swift transportation to the nearest empty cell.”
He was still. Cold and soaked and white as bone. Chest unmoving. Watson was silent. The pain in my chest was unspeakable.
“I see,” Holmes said musingly. “We shall have to interview this...mysterious station master. Chesterfield is just one station down the line, yes?”
“It is you, Watson, or no one.” His voice was guarded, quiet, but in the space between us, after years of Holmes sequestering his emotions below the surface for fear being seen as a man who bled like any other, every word rang loud and clear and surreal. “I trust no one else. Desire no one else. It is you I’m curious about, who occupies my mind and attention like no other.”
“Perhaps not quite as much,” Holmes said, shadows crossing his face. I sigh again, and finally, I decide to close the distance between us by leaning forward and pressing my lips to that marble brow.
I thought back, unable to resist chiding back even if he lived only in my head. I felt weak. Like fractured china.
“I have suffered from poor sleep for far longer than I have known you, Holmes." I lift a hand, extending it to the sheets in front of me. “Come here.”
As much as I had loathed the hours of academic discourse on beekeeping, I had deeply enjoyed our holiday on the whole. The time I had spent with Holmes had been restorative for more than just his health; it had done our partnership its own share of good as well. Even in Baker Street, we could not be as we were during those unbroken days in the country. Without Reginald’s presence, we had the run of the estate, and a level of privacy the likes of which I had never experienced with Holmes before. Our rooms had, by stroke of luck, been adjoined, so we had done as we pleased without fear of interruption or circumspection. Three weeks of stolen intimacy, I found, had replenished stores within my heart that I had barely realized needed filling. I had never felt so at ease as I did waking up in Holmes’s room at his side, my arm cast across a torso that had finally regained healthy weight, his quiet breaths a balm on my soul as his body recounted lost time by sleeping in.
Holmes, who was lying at my feet, vulnerable and injured, and the fire in my belly burned hotter and more desperate.
Without a moment’s remorse, I unsaddled the man in a swift move, grasping his ankle and hoisting upwards. He squawked, pitching to the earth, and in moments I was astride and racing after the carriage like the devil’s hellhounds were on my trail. The horse heaved, breath high and thin under my desperate driving, and we wove around the tree-spattered curves, November wind spiriting the blood from my face and whatever warmth was left in my body with it.
“It is a reasonable and practical concern,” Holmes huffed. “I’ve warned you about the dangers of places like these, Watson. I myself will not be caught unawares, not if I can help it. And it’s proving to be a most useful event to prepare for.”
“Carefully, inspector, take out your service pistol and place it on the ground before you.” Grimacing, Hopkins complied. “Kick it over here.” He did, and without lowering his arm, Coram bent to take the gun with his free hand, tucking it into the back of his belt. His piercing eyes slid over to me. “You next, doctor. Your service pistol.” His lips curled into a grin that made the hairs on my neck rise. “Smith wasn’t the only fan of yours in this household.”
“You’re not the only man here who knows how to defend himself, Doctor,” Johann said, through a chilling smile.
Holmes’s eyes flickered, smoke transfiguring into iron, and I could not help the faint, smug smile that broke across my face.
“A businessman,” the man said proudly. “And an engineer. I’ve already found several potential customers for my invention, but I was very optimistic about the director's board of buyers who were travelling on the train last night.”
“Could it have reversed?” I asked, struggling for an explanation. The station master’s pace slowed, and he paused to shake his head, clearly bewildered. Beside me, lantern light spilled into the fog as Holmes bent his arm over the tracks, silently observing the dull metal with intent.
“The final piece only just now fell into place,” Holmes said. I looked up from the floor and found myself staring at the Professor. More specifically, at his blanketed legs, and the shoes that poked out at the hem, and the dusting of cigarette ash on his loafers.
"Look sharp, Watson, we shall be entertaining visitors within a quarter hour. I believe Mr. Hemingway’s case can wait for us to hear out another."
“Our partnership has changed since I returned from the dead,” Holmes said. “You know as well as I that…” He pressed his lips together in a thin, colorless line. “I know you have not forgiven me. And I will not attempt to minimize the…difficulty you have experienced, boarding with me again. But I can no longer ignore the obvious, Watson. I do not know if you had planned to inform me soon, but I will save you the effort—and merely hasten that which was inevitable. I suggest you find lodgings with another more suitable to your preferences.”
“How did you know I'd be down?" I asked, to draw him from his glassy-eyed fixation on the wallpaper. Holmes was still in his robe, the pale cotton nightshirt beneath drawing his skin porcelain in the cool London morning. His hair was uncombed, dark fringe across a pinched brow.
, I beg you—do you truly believe me the machine you described me as in your stories? Have I failed you so in our friendship that you could assume such cruelty from me?"
“Holmes,” I protested, and as my voice reached his ears he halted midstride. Turning on a heel, he looked back to me, and for a fraction of a moment his mask of concentration slid away.
“Precisely. Meanwhile, I required proof. I went in search of wet clothing, which I knew had to exist if Coram was complicit and, by proxy, had a close accomplice. Observing the hallway, I hypothesized that there was a hidden room attached to the Professor’s bedroom, but such a deception...it could not have been maintained by the professor alone. A living person, hidden in a home for years? She required meals, transportation to town for her needs—like, perchance, optometry. All these were things the Professor could not have provided himself without giving something away.”
“Mrs. Hudson has seen far worse than a bit of blood,” I scoffed. “You’ve come home in much poorer condition before. It would have gone according to plan, but a footman escaped the Yard's net and delivered a message that the police were on the move.”
Fred nodded vigorously. “He looks after me, he—” He stumbled over his words, eyes going wide like a doe’s. “Mr. ‘Olmes, how—how’d you guess he was my older brother?”
“Wait, you’re leaving? No way, take me down. Sherlock, I swear to god, if you leave me here I’ll kill you!” John knew he wasn’t a threat while tied up, but that didn’t stop him from plotting his revenge for later.
“He’s just down there.” Molly points to the last black curtain. John hugs her, congratulates and thanks her, then turns to the curtains. He makes his way to the last one, then leans against the wall beside it. He doesn’t have long to wait.
“You know my weakness for making bets, my dear fellow,” I said, propping my cane on a neighboring chair as I sat down and reached eagerly for my cup. “And I believe you owe me one breakfast, consumed posthaste.”
Holmes had turned to look at me. I was shocked to see that his eyes had lost their steel, and to hear a strange, uncertain thread in his voice.
“...But you do know most of it,” I pressed, burying the sudden longing that rose up in me. I shifted in my repose, face twisting in discomfort as my leg twinged, and my friend frowned at me.
In the floor of the bureau, soaked in totality and dripping a modest puddle out of the door and onto the dirty floor, was a sodden violet dress—finer than anything else in the closet—and at its soggy hem was mud, deep brown and flecked with the tiny white petals of baby’s breath.
“Stop her!” Holmes cried, bounding across the room, but before either he or Hopkins could make it, she held a small phial to her lips.
“Not quite yet, Watson. I had no evidence to support such a theory, and you know my position on speculation without facts. But...it was increasingly likely, as you pointed out Watson, that the murderer was closer to the manor than any stranger or possible enemy of Smith’s from outside of it. The broken window, that was another intriguing piece to the puzzle—whyever would an intruder, a lady at that, decide to smash a window and flee through it, as opposed to departing the way she came? She certainly had the time to go back through the back door. No one in the house was certain of Smith’s cry, and Ms. Tarlton did not come running until after the window was broken.”
“He is waiting for you eagerly at home,” Holmes said, eyes flickering to mine as I winced under a gentle press of wet terrycloth to my naked shoulder.
“I would rush you to nothing. We need not participate in it at all, or never more than once if you find there are…actions, or sensations not to your favor.”
He twitched backwards, almost in a flinch, and I jerked back my hand, surprised and burned by the reaction.
“Very good,” I said, glad to hear that my friend's mood would not match the weather outside, and Holmes raised an eyebrow at me, eyes moving in that thoughtless, scanning manner of his down my body. I directed my attention elsewhere to keep myself from shifting under those smoke-colored eyes. Cold leached from the windows in tendrils, and the sound of rain was a low hum in my ears. Noticing the empty hearth, I gingerly stood to rouse a fire, and as I did so Mrs. Hudson, directly on time, brought in a tray with a kettle I could see issuing steam from a distance.
“But that is it, Watson. We did not see the train itself.” He inclined his hand a pile of spare wooden pieces, distinct from the metal parts which filled the entire room and which lay curiously separate on the far side of the wall.
“This case was the final straw,” Holmes said. His handsome features had transformed into untouched stone, and when his gaze moved to me—those smoke grey eyes, completely removed of emotion—it chilled me to my core. “The endless letters, the incessant attention. The risk to you. This is the last adventure we will share, Watson.”
There have only been two times in my life where I have regretted putting my adventures with Holmes to paper. Both of these instances occurred on the same case, nearly two weeks ago, and leveled such an impact that I have questioned whether or not I can continue—in good conscience, and for either of our sakes.
” the man spat. Now I could fully view his ugly face, and I could see that his nose was bleeding profusely, the skin split open at the bridge from a critical blow to the face. My answering smirk was black as pitch, knowing Holmes was responsible for it.
We made it to Baker Street in record time. I grimaced the entire ride as the hansom rolled over the cobblestones, jostling my wound, but I would not have diverted our journey home for anything, not even stitches.
"Of course," said Peter quickly. His youthful face was striking in its joy as he and his lover stood. "We will leave you, but do not expect this to be the end. By my word, we shall find some way to thank you."
I have often wondered at the changes my life with Holmes has rendered in me. Before his companionship, my heart would have dropped in sympathy at the mention of murder. Now, however, though I do feel for victims whose injustices we aim to resolve, my pulse tends to race with excitement instead of dread.
I sighed heavily, conceding the point. I could recall all too well Holmes’s morose coastline wanderings during the case of the Devil’s Foot; I had no desire to see him in such a depressed state any time soon. “Very well.”
I breathed into him, giving my everything too late, and when my lungs were spent I collapsed upon him, shuddering.
If it were possible, Holmes blushed deeper, his porcelain skin turning red as a summer rose. “Essentially,” he said. “This is most awkward for me, Watson. I detest being so uninformed. I feel like a boy in boarding school.
Holmes returned by half past two, and with effort, I managed to convince him to swallow down some tea and one of Mrs. Hudson’s excellent pastries (baked fresh upon learning that young Wiggins would return later in the afternoon). Holmes had come home with some purchases in a small bag from a store I did not recognize the name of, and his very body seemed to crackle with anticipation for the night’s investigation. I was in the middle of telling him about the Circle’s neighborhood and culture—with as much respect for my fellow members' privacy as I felt was due—when Wiggins entered our sitting room, a scone already lodged in his mouth.
Satisfied I’d found nothing of import, I returned to the meeting room to find Holmes already waiting for me, and the riveted manner in which his gaze found mine told me his search had been far more successful.
“I’m off to gather intelligence,” Holmes said, swinging the door open, and he angled his chin over his shoulder. “Unless you have any other life-altering secrets to confess, Watson?”
Watson,” he said, and when he turned back to look at me, he was almost returned to normal. But his small, reassuring smile did not touch his eyes, and my heart snagged at their flat, emotionless deception. “I will return in the morning.”
“Sleep well, Watson,” returned Holmes, at the same tender volume. Feeling like the lead in some penny-farthing romance, I buried the willowy exhale trapped in my throat and nodded.
“Mmm, actually, it is precisely those things to which I refer. There’s something missing from this picture, Watson, and I believe we could find it, should we set ourselves to the task. Every station has a luggage room, repair room, and storage room. Take the former, Watson, and I shall search the latter two. Meet me back here by the hour.”
Mycroft sighed, his mountainous shoulders bending down to form a summit. “You are capable of infiltration the likes of which most agents are not, and you well know it. The Prime Minister is becoming...concerned, and my work becomes so much more tedious when he is displeased.”
I could not accept this. I could not stop trying—my mind hurtled about, flying through memories of Watson’s medical journals I had carelessly thumbed through, reports of attempted drownings and their survivors, and—my heart seized—a flash of memory, a newspaper article five years ago, a doctor had tried to save a child who’d fallen into the Channel with a French technique.
“Forgive me if I am interrupting, gentlemen," Holmes said, with a voice like woven silk. I searched for words and found I could not manage a reply. I could not concentrate on anything but his face. Where before, darkness had lined Holmes’s eyes, now their lids were shaded with ashy powder, making his eyes glitter like veins of silver in rockbeds of granite. His face was powdered pale and perfect, and soft rouge swept in rosy, Cézanne brushstrokes across his cheekbones. His thin, expressive mouth had been painted in a flush, inviting pink, just a shade darker than its natural color, and my heart seemed to batter against the gate of my ribcage at the sight of his loose hair, which had been mussed enough to appear nearly disheveled, almost as if someone had run their fingers through it like I had craved to—
I stared at him, gutted by the venom in his words. I felt as though I had whiplash, receiving concern and guilt a mere night prior only to be dragged across the coals the very next day.
“Do continue,” Holmes said intently, and his eyes flickered to mine with an intrigue that reflected my own. I buried a smile as I extended tea to the inspector.
“The...the news has turned for the worse. I did not want to risk exposure...or bring the police to our door. And I did not expect I could go often without you suspecting something.”
“Your hands, my dear fellow,” he said, knees knocking against mine as the cab swayed on the country road.
“Watson,” said he, beckoning me close, and I drew magnetically to his side. He pointed a leather-clad finger, and I drew close to inspect its focus: faintly, I saw the whiskering strands of torn fabric in the light caught on the edge of one jut of glass, lilac in color. Torn from a woman’s dress, no doubt, and a fine one at that. My mind boggled at the idea of a highborn lady assassin, blind as a bat and soaked to the bone, and I shook my head in disbelief.
“I am wont to do so, on occasion,” he teased, breath white in the air. “And this is a very promising mystery indeed.”
“No, I don’t,” Mr. Robinson said, scowling. “And frankly, I don’t care! My prototype is missing! This level of gross incompetence is completely unacceptable, and I will be suing the line
Fred hopped off the couch, and after a beat of clear hesitation, he nervously tottered forward to wrap his arms around Holmes’s dark trouser leg.
“It were yesterday! Earlier in my shift! They just wanted to lift the edge of some railway near one of the stations on the line, so the—so the water of the lake wouldn’t come in too close, they said.”
"You'll never pay for drinks in my bar again," Johann promised, and the both of us looked at each other and broke into quiet chuckling.
“The Chilean “Barcazas” company. They were...” The man’s voice dropped in volume, his face layering with a distant emotion I could only label as fear. “They were on the train when it disappeared.” Fire relit in his gaze, ruddying his drooping cheeks. “With
“I need you to ensure Johann’s safety, Watson. You and Johann will meet the Threadcap representatives in a neutral location. The Yard will wait at a distance to arrest them, but
In three strides, I crossed the sitting room floor and took Holmes's face in my hands. In the space between one moment and the next, I watched his eyes widen in shock and knew that brilliant mind had understood my aim as quickly as I had summoned it, and it was because he stared at me unblinking and did not step back, did not lean away, that I seized the opportunity at hand. I cradled his lovely face in mine, and I kissed him.
I inhaled sharply, and the oxygen seemed to dagger holes in my lungs. “I understand if you can no longer abide my presence here in 221B. My only request is that you withhold the truth from Mrs. Hudson. I could not bear—”
Altogether, he looked like a rich dandy about to set out on the town, and a terribly dashing one at that. I felt at once hideously underdressed and strangely unsettled. I had known Holmes was handsome from the moment I met him, but the meaning, the unspoken language in his clothing—and the darkness surrounding his eyes, making them shine like steel in the low apartment light—seemed to rattle me to my bones. Feeling as if my tongue were inflated, I struggled for words.
By sheer stroke of luck, the rain had ceased on the train ride to Kent, but the cold still nipped at my hands and cheeks and burrowed into my collar. The journey to Yoxley Old Place was secluded and winding; though it wasn’t so far removed from Chatham’s city limits, the curving nature of the road—around thickets of trees left wild to divide the land, and across stony bridges and modest streams—it seemed more like the countryside than a manor not far from town and station. A constable at the manor’s tall brick gate met our taxi at the entrance and allowed the three of us passage, and Holmes had clambered out of the carriage to examine the only way in and out of the manor’s premises with his own senses.
“Yes,” I said unhappily. “It is unfortunate.” I sighed, squaring my shoulders. “But we have persevered and shall do so regardless. To arrest us all would be to arrest half of Parliament, it seems.” I inclined a head to the other end of the bar. “And some of their wives.”
She trembled, whispering prayers I had not heard since my youngest days as a child in church, clutching her cross.
I thought, and meant it to be cruel. Silence greeted me then, seeping in from the uncaring room around me, and I almost regretted spurning Holmes’s spectre even knowing it was a fiction. Baker Street was so quiet. I missed him in my bones, and I thought then I might have done anything to keep him, even if he were only a fragment of my own mind.
“My dear Watson," he said. "I wish that...” Head bowing, his voice faded in anguish. “Deceiving you has been my greatest regret.”
With that, Holmes turned on a heel and faced the crying woman with ice in his features. “Mrs. Marker,” he said.
The maid practically beamed at my offer, looking for the first her proper age in the liveliness of her relief, and left us. Holmes muttered something to himself, and I turned to him. "What was that, Holmes?"
“I implore you to study my treatise with more attention, Watson,” Holmes said haughtily, and I nodded like I always did at the suggestion. “I direct you to the first letter of the first word. And then to the second letter of the second word, and so on per line.”
Holmes dipped back into the repair room and returned with a very large gas headlamp, a large loose steam whistle part, and curiously, a fire extinguisher in his hands. Carefully, he hung the light on the dividing beam of our construction, affixed the steam whistle to the side on a bolt, and twisted the hose of the fire extinguisher onto a pump he’d insisted without explanation we install. Soon the pump was connected to the steam whistle in such a fashion that when Holmes squeezed the fire extinguisher trigger and pulled down our design’s handle, a shrill, familiar shriek pierced the air as pressure rattled through the whistle.
“Gathering her courage, she ran downstairs. She found Mr. Smith’s door shut, and opened it. Inside, she found him stretched upon the floor, lying in a substantial pool of blood, and the bedroom window facing the lawn behind him had been broken. Ms. Tarlton tried to raise Mr. Smith, kneeling outside of the blood which pooled beneath him, but some of it stained the fabric of her nightdress. Mr. Smith had been pierced by a very small but very deep wound at the neck, a wound which had divided the carotid artery. The instrument with which the injury had been inflicted lay upon the carpet beside him. It was one of those small sealing-wax knives to be found on old-fashioned writing-tables, with an ivory handle and a stiff blade. Later, we learned it was part of the fittings of Professor Coram’s own desk.”
“You only made it to the fifth setting, John. I’m disappointed, maybe next time I’ll cut the time in half.” Sherlock slipped in the rest of the way, only stopping once fully inside the smaller man.
When all was done and quiet, they were able to rest. Sherlock laid on his back with John leaning his head on his chest. A hand found its way into the blonde spikes as another found itself rubbing circles into the skin of his back.
“No. There is no way she is staying with us, John. John, you don’t understand. She can’t come. No, I refuse. She has to stay with Mycroft.” Sherlock sulked as he drew his arms to his chest.
“Bed? What? No! It’s only one or two or somethin’ in the afternoon.” John protested, but Sherlock just carried him out of the room.
“Sherlock, please..” John wiggled his wrists against the restraints. He pulled until one became free, then he wrapped his hand around the back of the detectives neck and pulled down until their lips crashed together.
“John, what are you- why would you..” Sherlock didn’t finish his sentence, only sat up as a blush threatened to break free. John wasn’t phased by his sudden movements. He looked around the room then met Sherlock’s gaze.
“What is?” John looked at him as confusion and concern fought over his features. Sherlock looked to the walls before speaking in a cautious tone.
“Yes.. that doesn’t worry me. If they come against then my allies will help. I’m not worried about a few offended families. I’m not interested in that drama. If they want into our kingdom then they should try other tactics than marriage.” Sherlock sighed.
“Sherlock, John, you came! Ah! I’m so happy!” Molly rushed out of the cabin only to throw herself around Johns neck.
How was he to believe that a royal actually cared about their people? A king should not be bothered by a lonesome knight’s death. A king wouldn’t be bothered by that. He just wouldn’t be. He couldn’t be! John snatched the book off the desk and cracked it open. He skimmed the pages until he found the correct date.
“Mummy is going to be displeased to find that our walls have been put in jeopardy. You mustn’t tell her that we were here when this happened. She will have my head and yours…” Sherlock looked to John then to the window.
“Who he killed? Why ask such a thing? Isn’t that something you normal people find- offensive?” Sherlock’s voice shot venom as he switched to her language. Johns airy demeanor dropped while Enola paled and looked at the prince with wide eyes. “I speak more languages than others can comprehend. Surely you aren’t still caught up on our people’s old feud. Your father died on the same battlefield as mine. No need worrying a former soldier of your demons.”
“Today starts the beginning stages of a joyous adventure brother mine! Do cheer up! Mummy dear is awfully excited. She claims to have invited the fairest ladies from every royal family in the surrounding area. How promising.” Mycroft’s teasing tone irritated his brother.
Hints of peppermint trace the air. Mothers, fathers, siblings, and aunts, bundled in winter coats, take their seats. Cousins scan their tickets and search the rows for their matching numbers. Dresses of red and suits of black fill the open room. All is calm once the lights finally dim.
When all is done, the lights are raised and all are on their feet as the dancers bow on the stage. John claps enthusiastically as his mother cheers.
Now, with his hands tied up to the bed, and exhaustion setting in, John finally received what he’d been denied for the past week.
“Don’t give up on me now, John. You’re almost there.” Sherlock turned the vibrator up another notch, then set the remote down on the nightstand.
When he is finished, a faint sheen of sweat glistens his forehead. From where they sit, John swears the boy is looking at him. Their eyes meet for the briefest of seconds, then it’s over. After the lights dim, the boy scurries off.
“No! I- I can’t” John couldn’t stop himself from bucking his hips. He couldn’t stop himself from letting go. He couldn’t stop Sherlock from taking it all in and swallowing every drop. He couldn’t stop the small bit of pride that came over him when Sherlock smiled up at him, just like he couldn’t stop the large amount of embarrassment that overcame him when he realized he lost control.
“I’m off,” John said once more. “I’m not sure what is happening, but- but I like it. I’ve never felt so,” He looked at his hands as if for the first time, “alive.” His eyes shot back up to pierce through Sherlock’s. “And right now, I feel like I’m going to explode. All this energy is pent up. I don’t know what is going on, but I need- I need something.” John sat frozen on the bed as time slowly ticked by. “You.”
“Yes, you, I want you.” John inched himself forward until he was right in front of Sherlock. They stared at each other for a long minute before Sherlock cleared his throat.
“Uhh, Fine!” Sherlock threw himself back against the cushion. “You tricked me into promising to go. You know I don’t pay attention while in my mind palace. That was a cheat move, John.” Sherlock continued to pout at his circumstances.
She made her way past the others in the room to find John stuffing his tongue down Sherlock’s throat, and dang was that a sight to see.
“Not another word.” Sherlock glared at John in fake anger, his cheeks tinted crimson. Once he was standing properly again, they were off. He zipped past maids and noblemen, until he came to a darkened part of the castle. The hallway seemed to own a depressing spirit. They walked slowly as they neared a dark oak door. Sherlock crept it open, then found an oil lamp to light.
Their ride across the kingdom took some time, more time than expected. Enola attempted to make small talk every few minutes, but the prince didn’t seem to care. His attention was turned to the window by the knights head. John caught him staring at him a few times, but said nothing.
“This is my pride and joy. She is the purest of her kind. She lives to serve and love. I hope you two find a connection of sorts.” The man winked causing his daughter to blush. Sherlock’s mother smiled and asked of her name.
“You’re right, he didn’t care enough to think about us. That bastard! Mum is a widow, and no man has touched her since father-“ John looked up at Sherlock through shocked eyes. “I didn't mean to- I’m sorry.” He bowed in a not so graceful way. “I should go back to my room. Please forgive me, we aren’t- I’m not.” He stumbled over his own words before finding the ones that fit. “We aren’t friends, I am beneath you. You shouldn’t have to listen to my babbling.” John backed away from the prince as his face became heated.
John pushed against Sherlock’s chest, pinning him down against the couch. Neither of them were aware of the cameras filming them, or Sherlock would have forced John off his lap. The hell the brunette would have to pay for this one.. even if John started it..
This chapter was longer than the last so yay. Next chapter will introduce Enola and her background. Just to recap, the princesses are: Irene, Molly, Janine, Enola, Ludovica, Alessia, and Artemis.
Sherlock wanted to ask questions, he wanted to know why this? Why does John seem so determined? Said man slipped his hand under Sherlock’s shirt and worked its way up to the now hardened nipple. He pinched it, gaining a gasp from Sherlock. He continued to tease and nip at every inch of available skin, but that wasn’t enough. It’s never enough.
So sorry this took me so long to post! Things have been hectic at my house so i havent Had much free time. I’ll try to do better!
“As long as you keep me alive, then you’re doing fine.” Sherlock smiled giving him leeway. They fell into a comfortable silence until they reached the door leading to the outside. Sherlock paused with a sigh escaping his lips.
Enola’s light blue head wrap covering her hair matched her shin length blue and white dress. The fabric clung to her thin stomach, but fluffed out near the end. The patterns changed as they swooped around her body, Sherlock thought them to be traditional. The light shades of her outfit caused her dark complexion to stand out.
“Alright, no need to be a cock about it. What’s in the box?” John finished unbuttoning his shirt and pulled it off. Sherlock sat next to him on the edge of the bed and placed the box between them.
“Gavin would pick out a boring man.” Sherlock huffed and let himself fall further down the seat. “I could meet the new guards, maybe steal someone away from their duties to come serve me.” Sherlock gave great thought to this.
“What if I don't want to? Hmm? It’s too hot in this bloody flat. I blame you for that. You and your cold feet and your cold hands! Never able to stand a normal temp. I’m hot, therefore I won't be putting my shirt back on.” John glared back like a problematic child. Sherlock grabbed the shirt and forced it over John’s head.
“Don’t over exaggerate, brother, they aren’t that bad. They all seem to care for you, or your looks.” Mycroft looked up from his papers to stare blankly at the prince. “Get off my bed, you’ve messed with the sheets.”
Sherlock bucked his hips a few times, causing John to writhe under him. Johns back arched once more, disconnecting their lips. Sherlock took this chance to bend down and bite a lovemark into his shoulder. John cried out and wrapped his legs around Sherlock’s bottom half.
This is when things get interesting. John let himself be taken by his loves hands. He closed his eyes and just felt. He let his senses be invaded by the younger man, let his body enjoy these practices movements. He was doing fine, up until Sherlock found the spot. He added another finger and kept at his steady pace.
Mycroft unconsciously took a step backwards as his mother’s gaze became heavy. “Sorry, Mummy, but I shouldn’t concern myself with such normal simplicities. Ordinary people do ordinary things such as wasting their life-”
“Yes, only two or three drinks can turn John into a blubbering lunatic. Molly, he’s going to hate me in the morning.” Sherlock pushed John's face away from his neck.
“I- I didn’t know. I’m sorry, I won’t touch anything next time, thank you.” Enola shied away from the man. Her eyes turned to the plants on the far side of the room, where the prince and his knight interacted.
They walked through the corridor until they reached the dining hall, which Sherlock’s mother decided to be a good time for expressing her sentiments about his marriage. Sherlock watched the tears slip down her cheeks, but felt nothing in regards to their situation.
A small smile came to float on his lips. Her eyes lingered as she remembered the man he once had been, sharp, mocking, broken – one she would have loved to hear begging.
problem. She'd been thinking about it for days now, and had concluded that if the consulting detective was so important to the man she loved, she should make an effort. Either she dumped John Watson altogether, or she learnt to deal with Sherlock Holmes as well. Considering she'd been overly depressed these past few days, she picked the latter option.
Because he was so engrossed in cosseting him, it took him some time to become aware of the trembling.
"Well, you've come all the way here even though you have a flight tomorrow morning for Washington, and you've invited me to a restaurant, so I imagine you have another request."
The skull. Weeping. Crying blood. Mouth open and screaming. Death throes. Skin glowing in the moonlight.
It was distracting, but even more distracting was Seb's annoyance with Sherlock. Jim had been a hassle to live with sometimes, but most of the time he was just interesting. Sherlock was interesting, of course, but right now he was being an idiot – or a smart coward, if you prefer, which is even worse – and this irritated Moran to no end. He never liked idiots. Dealt with them when it was strictly necessary. But with Jim, he'd got used to
Your hair was black again and you were glad – you had missed it. You also found it suited you better, no matter what women said – and you'd met quite a lot recently. Women, that is.
“And I’m taking you to bed.” Sherlock came to the conclusion that pushing his tiny boyfriend to the floor is frowned upon, so he put his hands under his thighs to help support him.
The crowd is captivated by his movements, the swift pulls and kicks of his legs, the gentle gliding of his arms. It draws the people in. The care he takes with each step is absolutely stunning. John's mother holds her breath as she watches the boy twirl around the stage.
“Yes, that could prove to be troublesome.” Sherlock looked down to his feet, avoiding Johns gaze. “I think it's time for us to join the others.” The prince walked passed by his knight, stopping by the door. “Thank you for- for this. For- mm.” Sherlock nodded his head as if John understood what he was saying before walking off.
Sherlock’s form melted into the tile as he cried. His eyes would be puffy, red, too swollen to see, but he didn’t care. His nose would be runny, proof that he cried. He knew John would be able to read his features, but he couldn’t stop himself. Regret filled the void he felt. Questions bounced inside his head. How could he have let this happen? For the first time in his life, Sherlock didn’t know what to do.
John glared up at him, but new whatever he said or did wouldn’t help his case. Sherlock does what he wants, when he wants. Even if John didn’t want this, he wouldn’t fight him. This was a game after all, and John loved to play.
“Are you alright? How do you feel?” Sherlock managed to keep himself seated, fighting the edge to jump forward and examine. John looked up at him as questions rose and fell between them.
John’s unable to focus on the other dancers, his mind wanders off to the beauty that is the boys dark curls. He wants to run his fingers through them. He can’t draw his eyes away from the boys pale skin, the way it practically shines in this lighting. Thoughts of tainting that skin cross John’s mind more than once.
“Out with it, John.” Sherlock stroked his hand through the blonde spikes. John leaned upwards so he could whisper into Sherlock’s ear.
“This is absolutely ridiculous. Mummy and father have lost their heads. How anyone is to carry through with this baffles me..” Sherlock grimaced as he looked at himself in the mirror. Lady Hudson smiled her charming smile and patted his cheek.
“Get off! This is absurd. Let me go.” Sherlock wiggled against his grip. John pinned his arms so that his head was between them. His hold over Sherlock’s wrists only tightened with the struggle.
“Are you kidding me? You, Sherlock Holmes, are a ridiculous man. I certainly didn’t see it, and even if I did, it wouldn’t matter. You were amazing. Besides, everyone messes up, no one is perfect.” John offers a smile and lets his wrist go.
“And I’m certain we’ll determine the truth of it eventually,” I said firmly, and when Holmes looked up at me with a curious expression, I lifted an eyebrow. “But it shall have to wait. Recall you made a bargain with me, Holmes.”
“No?” I incline my head to where he sits on my bed. "You only just admitted to fretting, my dear man."
Despite my feelings, and disregarding how often he captained my thoughts in the day and their quieter, tugging night wanderings, I was content with my relationship with Holmes, and not merely because I knew that his reciprocation of my feelings was quite impossible. He was my closest friend and confidant, a man with whom I shared more than lodgings, adventure, and goodwill. He was my time-tested, mosaic, ingenious companion, exceptional in mind and his meaning to me. I was happy. With our days, with our shared meals, our conversations and orchestra shows, and our cross-country investigations. I treasured our time together, unembittered, with the memory of life without him a still-healing wound in my mind.
“Very good, Wiggins,” Holmes said, lifting an expectant hand. Wiggins ambled over and handed a few scraps of parchment to Holmes, in exchange for a polished silver shilling. “Did you see the young Mr. Ables home safely?”
"Are you certain we cannot repay you in any way?" Johann asked. "You have given me..." He trailed off, and Peter visibly took his hand and squeezed. "You have given me back my life."
I'd never heard that word leave my friend's lips with such frequency, nor had I ever seen him look so aggrieved. It was this, and only this, that kept me where I stood instead of storming out of the apartment to escape the mortifying agony of betrayal.
” Holmes insisted, hand seizing mine. “I know my own body, and it has known worse wounds than these.”
“But what could you possibly—” I moved to his side to peer into the trunk’s shelves, only to freeze in disbelief.
“No time, my dear fellow, we must move while any evidence is fresh. I regret that we even had to wait until morning to investigate.”
me, Watson, and it angered me, because where once our friendship had been a positive outlier in my history with others of our kind, now it seemed…insufficient.” Holmes’s cool mask cracked, and he dropped his head. “No. Not insufficient. It was not that your friendship did not sustain me. It merely incited more. More within me, and a greater, more foolish desire to…”
With measured slowness, I dropped the edge of my paper low enough to raise an unimpressed eyebrow. Wisely, Holmes lifted his palms in surrender, retreating to his desk to leave me in peace as Mrs. Hudson entered with tea for the both of us.
“Your theory is interesting to me, Professor,” said my friend. “Very interesting, indeed. I have much to ponder. I should prefer, by your leave, to go quietly down to your garden and turn the whole matter over in my head. We must apologize for having intruded upon you, Professor Coram, and I promise we won’t disturb you again until we take our leave.”
"Ms. Tarlton," said Holmes. "Do you perhaps know why Mr. Smith resided on the first floor, as opposed to one of the guest bedrooms up here and granted the privacy of the whole upper west wing?"
shall rest here. My uncharitable ruckus this morning took a great deal of sleep from you—” I immediately opened my mouth to protest, “—whereas I have matters to attend to this morning in town. I will be back within a few hours, which should give you plenty of time to brunch and to doze. I expect we will be up very late tonight, my dear fellow.”
“Only an accomplice, my dear Watson, a player in a much larger deception. A deception that we shall see the pieces of more clearly when we speak again to the Professor. All shall be revealed, my dear man.”
it to,” I said, shaking my head. “Some may prefer…“frippery”, as you called it, but it's hardly a requirement. I have been a part of relationships with both men and women, and their definitions came from
“Alright,” I said gravely. “But you must promise me that you will not bring undue attention to yourself. I could not…” I cleared my throat, voice going gravel-rough as I attempted to conceal my anxiety. “I could not bear the responsibility of dragging your reputation through the mud, if you were recognized.”
“Nothing of value, really, that’s the strange bit. A few hundred feet of standby rails and some spare parts. Wouldn't have been an easy task, to steal all of that...And why would anyone want to?”
“Lean back, my friend,” he said, his voice regaining its strength and discipline. “I can see you shaking from the effort of leaning up. Lay
“I cannot say for certain,” Holmes replied. “It depends upon those cigarettes that I smoked. It is possible that I am utterly mistaken but—no, there is something there, and the cigarettes will show us the truth.”
Holmes was underestimating both the power of his own attractive novelty and the forwardness of the patrons around us. The last thing we needed this evening was Holmes frustrated from an inability to escape a throng of flirts, I told myself, and I crossed my arms at him.
“No,” I said immediately. I resisted the foreign urge to twist my hands together in awkwardness. “I…haven’t been to the Circle in a few months or so, and that was only the once. I…had stopped attending, for a few years, and haven’t returned this year due to the recent…public feelings, towards the community.”
For all that I smear the pathos in your stories, it is fact that you are not a creature for soppy poetry or knitted gifts! You are not meant for the doldrums of a partnership that stagnates on fading compliments and coquetry! We are the same in that. The very same. I was satisfied. I
“I…was uncertain if you would…if you would have welcomed my presence after a dream that disturbed you,” he admits. “But now, perhaps…”
Holmes swallowed again. "At your discretion," he said, with bravado. I grinned, and happily obliged. Sliding my hands back to where they had found a home cradling Holmes's face, I gently tugged him downwards into a kiss. Gradually, heart hammering against my ribs, I deepened it, mouth slotting over a bottom lip and carefully coaxing it with my teeth. I tasted tobacco and brandy, and inhaled the scent of ash and roses. My fingernails carded back through Holmes's hair, and he pulled back an inch to inhale, sharp and shaking in my ears. Another article of evidence to store for later reference.
“Oh, many,” said Holmes, and for the first he appeared optimistic about our holiday plans. “I should be pleased to hear his point of view on colony growth in the region and the effect of local mining on larvae development.”
I soon learned the source of Holmes’s grim mood as he informed me about the latest break in the Baron Gruner case. The news he delivered was dark enough to turn my stomach. Ms. Winter’s testimony of abuse, and the attack she and Mr. Shinwell had experienced, made my skin crawl with horror and outrage. Holmes and I had faced much by way of humanity’s agency for darkness, shoulder to shoulder, but never had we come across a blackguard so foul as Gruner. I disliked, deeply and fiercely, that I was so caught up in my practice now, at such a time, when Holmes was going up against a man with such a clear capacity for cruelty. It was not only that I felt moved to ensure the man’s swift entry behind bars for the sake of those he had harmed, but the idea of Holmes facing off against such a villain alone—though he was certainly up to the challenge—rankled me beyond measure.
"You made a mistake, Holmes. Recall I misunderstood you, too. I thought you had learned of my feelings, that you were casting me out for them. Many men would react poorly to learning they were loved by another."
“The manuscript can wait,” Holmes said, drumming his fingers on the table as I carefully turned hot water into his cup. “And the puzzles offered in the post last week have been dealt with.”
“Is it? I had not noticed.” Regardless, he rose from his chair, the fabric of his robe smoothing in a silken line down his lean frame. “My apologies, Watson. I should have lit the hearth hours ago.”
“Fine,” he said to the wall. His blunt dismissal was the final dagger to my heart, and I was almost glad to see him move away, retreating towards his bedroom. “I will inform Ms. Hudson to put an advert in the morning post.”
“That leaves us at romantic intimacy,” I said, with false bravado as heat climbed up my neck. “I believe we are of the same mind regarding commitment and monogamy. That our plans for the future are—erhm. Intertwined. But where are your preferences in the realm of…open affection?”
“Mrs. Marker,” my friend said, and there was a firmer quality to his voice that had me straightening over my tea. “Oblige my curiosity about the good Professor Coram. You have worked for him for many years now, yes?"
“A conspirator? You think there’s some plot at work, then. Holmes, really, if you have pieced together any sort of answer to that missing train—”
Holmes’s mouth twitched, perhaps in amusement at the boy’s exuberance, or perhaps in mild panic at the idea of a child tugging at our heels for an entire investigation. “You would aid us best, Mr. Ables, by remaining safe at home and waiting to see if your brother returns. If something is indeed afoot and your brother is caught in the web of something dangerous, it is far better for you to remain out of harm’s way.” When the young boy looked unconvinced, Holmes lifted a considering eyebrow. “But I shall give you a task, hmm?” The boy nodded, so enthusiastically I feared his head would dislodge from his neck.
“What a gloomy night,” I said unhappily, shivering as the evening fog pooled around our knees. “What are we doing out here, Holmes? It was warmer in the waiting hall.”
” I said, exasperated. Holmes tipped his head at the door, eyes flickering with amusement below the ebony brim of his hat. I realized that the scowl on my face had been transformed into a laughable, offended facsimile. Only Sherlock Holmes could lift weight from my shoulders by insulting me.
“How do you do?” Holmes said, voice smooth and slightly more posh than its usual tones, and Thomas practically beamed.
And it was close enough to the truth that when he smiled at me, eyes gleaming with the light of yet-unraveled mystery, I could mirror him without the slightest tremor.
“I see you've had a busy morning, inspector,” Holmes remarked, and I watched him cast about for his pipe with a subtle,
I found the luggage room quickly, unsurprisingly unlocked considering the master’s conduct, and once inside I squinted in the low light for anything unusual. The shelves where luggage was stored were barren, and all I could see in the dark was a burlap sack, thrown across the floor over something misshapen and lumpy. Frowning, I lifted the sack by its corner with the edge of my cane, pulling it away only to immediately wrinkle my noise at the cloying scent of alcohol. More rubbish bottles: wine bottles, to be exact. The station master was an even bigger drunk than first appeared—and quite sloppy too, to leave them in the luggage room so carelessly.
“You will never step foot into danger without me at your elbow, I swear by all the gods,” he muttered, hand sliding up my neck and sending gooseflesh rippling down my spine.
“What on earth is that?” I asked, staring. “It’s enormous! I thought you were packing for our holiday, not a trip to America!”
It was proving to be a terrible truth now. Coram stepped forward, reaching out his free hand without wavering his aim. His wife, no longer frothing with rage, looked at him with adoration on her face.
“...ger me sideways,” the man garbled, squinting up at us with a foul expression on his ruddy face. I scowled down at him, repulsed by the vulgar display. “Yeah? What is it, don’t have all day.”
