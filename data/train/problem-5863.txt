“Ever think about joining the football team? Even I didn’t catch half of these things.” Tony leant over and scanned the page he was looking at. It was notes from a few practices ago.
“Sorry, the missus is calling. See you ‘round.” Bucky gave him a particularly dirty wink before spinning around and jogging to who Tony now knew was Natasha. Steve’s glare followed Bucky, and Tony let out a long breath.
Tony started sliding his notebooks and his textbook back into his backpack, the team beginning to wander out from the locker rooms. With a glance at his phone, Tony confirmed that Happy would be there to pick him up in 15 minutes.
“If you bothered us, you would have been kicked out long before Rhodey left, and ignore Steve, he isn’t glaring at you.” Bucky’s smile turned into something almost soft.
Without waiting for the next Steve’s poking Peter interrupted him first, “Your Tower is lined with his portraits, for God’s sake! And Mr. Stark, you were upgrading his shield at the board meeting, and…”
“I told you so,” Rumlow muttered angrily. He was locked up in the guardhouse for the whole eternity. “I told you that it would end like this.”
“You can stop hiding,” the guy said and tapped the shield lightly. It hummed as if it caught a bullet. “Firstly, I’m not dangerous… Secondly, I’m inevitable. Muahaha. Joking. Well, now what, my dear master? What do you wish for? Just keep in mind that I can’t resurrect, or kill, or make anybody fall in love… And I can’t grant you additional wishes. There are only three of them, but don’t worry, if you keep your wits about you… Hm. Wait a minute.” The bottle-habitant made a second pause, turned his legs into a bluish swirl for no apparent reason, and flew around Steve, peering into him. “So, eternal life and youth are in place, we can cross it off. As well as fame, I guess. What about wealth? Adventures beyond all measures? A sky-high statue with fire letters on…”
“I figured that in the very moment when this miss took me by the collar and pulled here,” the priest answered bravely and added out of place. “I have a couple of posters with you too, Captain Rogers. So, have you come here today of your own free will to be joined in matrimony?”
“It’s true, but I don’t think that this is about science as it is,” Tony chuckled. “This is about me, isn’t it?”
Of course, they were late for the festive dinner. Tony offered to forget it completely, but Steve protested because in that case Thor or Romanoff would come to fetch them, and heaven knew what would be worse.
“I’m telling you that everything depends on it, that the whole world depends on it! You don’t care about it? Then you shouldn’t care about saving it right now, because it’s over anyway!” He glared at them, boiling from helpless anger at himself. Everything was going wrong, and he couldn’t think how to make it right. “You could’ve let the rocket fall on the city, that’s it!”
“No way,” Tony pressed his fingers to his forehead and then to his heart. “She was there and there. Now I’ll create her for real. I can bring her to life, I can do a million things… and you know what, Steve? I start with one where I invite you for a cup of coffee with lokum. What do you think?”
“He provided them with the ammunition of the latest modifications,” Cap said with fake calmness. “From the underground. He had never misstepped, we caught him just because Rhodes had been heavily wounded. Am I right?”
“Cap, what’s going on with you? Do you have a fever or what? It would be at the wrong time, you know. We have to resurrect half of the Universe, and you’re going to take a sick leave?”
“Well, while you think, I can brew us coffee,” Tony suggested in the sweetest voice. “If you want, of course. I love good coffee.”
“I don’t understand...” he began, and Tony shook his head once again and touched the soft skin with his lips. Steve felt so much at once that he couldn’t help groaning. A sharp but pleasant shiver ran through him like a lightning caught in a Leyden jar. It fluttered in his body harshly and burned him inside before fainting slowly and reluctantly. “Tony!”
Steve dared to look at him. It was rare that Tony smiled like this but his eyes were clearly worried.
As Steve was passionately licking Tony’s dark nipples, Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s blond hair and pulled, making him stop, as if he felt those doubts somehow. He said hoarsely, “Let’s lie down. I’m weak in the knees.”
“Why do you…” Steve’s neck reddened. His preferences were his deepest secret, he sincerely tried to make it with Peggy, to do everything right, how it should be… but… “How?”
“Our victory,” he said low and ultimately as if he drove in a nail in the coffin with his every word, “is impossible without a crushing defeat of the rebels. We can hunt after them a few more years, destroy their bases, catch their leaders, but the most smashing blow to them will be Tony Stark on our side. If we kill him, his legend will live forever. I hope it’s clear for all of you.”
“I had no idea that physics inspires you so much,” Tony said at last. He lost the biggest part of his usual sarcasm somewhere.
“Wha-a-at? Rogers, you… you promised me that you’d delete all traces from the system!” Stark’s voice showed his anger, slight fear, and… amusement?
“I have,” Peter answered quickly. “I took them with me. Or rather… Strange gave it to me at the last moment. Here.”
Weariness and anxiety of this day closed in on him in one moment, he felt an itch in his nose and scratch in his throat from dust. He coughed, rubbed watery eyes with his fists and the seemingly steady world started to swing. Peter tried to say something—he didn’t even know what exactly. He caught sight of Romanoff’s and Clint’s surprised faces, and then two kissing figures—Steve kissed Tony as if the whole Universe, as if all realities depended on that… and in some sense, it was true. Something mighty and irresistible pulled him up and to the side, the world faded to bars and spun around him.
Steve leaned across the table and shut his mouth with a kiss. Never was he wrong about his chances, never.
“Remember how Cap grieved when he thought that Tony was dead. After that?” Nat chuckled too. “I don’t think so.”
“It’s a personality,” Rogers answered confidently. “By the way, your counting is right, I’m definitely… firm. And charismatic.”
“You like donuts with cherry jam.” Rogers went on, pressing the advantage as if he was in a battle. “And I like to watch you eat...”
Frankly, they all were not in their right minds then. Even Tony said just that, “In fact, it was no sweat. The most difficult thing was to lose all hope, and then it dawned upon me. There was something missing in the theory of relativity, so I completed it, and after that, it was easy as a pie. I just needed to calculate all fluctuation points of the space-time continuum and…”
Tony sighed once again. Then his eyes flared up with vivid fire and he said excitedly, “I am screwed if we don’t succeed in passing the law for gay marriages. Rogers proved to be a romantic. He declared his feelings for me at Hawaiian sunset and presented me with a handful of pearls that he had picked up himself. And now he waits for my answer.”
“My crush is a genius,” Steve wrote honestly. Well, he almost didn’t hope that Tony would understand it and save him from a declaration of love, but it didn’t hurt to try.
So, Hulk has broken two dozens of lampposts over his knee. Now he is trying to take a bite of the beautiful plaster on the front of the city hall.
“Shut up,” Pierce advised him. He was angry and disappointed because Stark showed no sign of letting up. His giant drawing with the obscene suggestion (or proposal? You couldn’t be sure with damn Stark) now seemed an innocent joke at most.
“I’m genie Tony. Don’t confuse me with gin tonic.” It was a canned joke, for certain. “It’s clear why the old man decided to pass me to you exactly: he wanted to find you so badly that it almost drove him mad. He wasted his wishes as good as for nothing and he tried to extend my potential, shall we say. But, as you can see, he didn’t manage to do it so he gave me to you in case you’ll find a way to deal with me. You know, he talked his arse off about you. That you are a hero, a brave man, and a nice guy who left his friends too untimely.”
For a day and a half more Tony can’t leave some awful hospital room. Cap Giant Guilt wanders around nagging, whining, and sympathizing.
“Nonexistent God, grant me patience and strength!” Tony cried rolling his eyes. Peter laughed, caught something weird in Strange’s eyes, and felt some change in him, inside him. It was as if he remembered yesterday after a colorful but chaotic dream. One brick after another is put in place—and you have what hasn't been there a moment ago.
“Yes,” Steve answered firmly. As far as Peter could tell—thanks to the firsthand experience of communicating with Captain—if Steve made a decision, he would stick to it no matter what. Nothing and nobody could sway him from the path. “We came here, on this battlefield, by our own free will, and we want to be joined in matrimony.”
He wrote it but didn’t send it. He should force himself, he should, but… It was so easy to stay guard over justice and equality, to be for all good against all bad, and it was so hard to open fully to the man who was his first love, it seemed. Peggy was something different: she embodied everything that was forbidden for him, she was a symbol of the fight, she strived against the stream, she never felt uncomfortable with herself. It won him, it inspired him; he was delighted with her and even a little jealous. Steve couldn’t be like her despite what he tried. She understood him, and it would be a great foundation for a slow-burning relationship if not for the war when the battle (and personal) front evolved too fast for a man to keep up with it.
“Back off from Bucky,” Rogers answered, as if he heard Pierce’s thoughts, “and tell me your decision. You had enough time to think, and it’s not like you had many distractions in here.”
His home was dark and silent, and the bedroom was cold. Steve was freezing constantly despite him being warm as a stove; now no one needed any more heating here. Tony pulled off his Tom Ford jacket and unbuttoned his vest. He had to survive today, somehow. And tomorrow. And the day after tomorrow. California could wait for him. In the end, the New York branch of SI desperately needed new ideas. He needed to prioritize that.
At this moment Tony already hiccups because of endless laughing. Steve carefully pretends that he isn’t insulted.
Surprisingly, Steve still has never been caught. Even after the monstrous alien ship crashed down on the compound’s lawn, smoking and falling apart, and Tony stepped out of it, talking the same way as always…
“Listen, Steve,” Tony said firmly. “I need to show you something. To confess. No, please, don’t interrupt me, or else I’ll lose my nerve and never… fuck. It’d be better if I was without pants here, it’s more familiar for me, and Pepper’s found me in such situations… no, stop, it’s not what I meant to say. I’m sorry.”
Rogers turns red. Tony imagines himself the ancient Greek god Zeus in anger (at least, repulsors can pass as lightning, right?). That is, he is enough majestic and terrific.
“Oh, and what would it be?” Stark interested. “Listen, what about a disarmament program? There is no one to fight anymore, so we can put all our efforts into progress. Or I have another thought — why our surroundings are so… well-ordered, green-colored, whitewashed, and perfectly covered? Maybe we could begin to contribute to personality? A soldier-personality is a way better than a soldier-cog and a civil…
Before he even sat near Tony, flowers grew up and blossomed. Explosive goosebumps seemed to crawl down his skin, causing his nipples to tense and his cock to half-harden. Steve felt his cheeks heated and he hastily flopped on the sofa between an elbow-rest and Tony. He took the popcorn bowl and placed it on his thighs as fast as he could.
“In his teeth,” Captain Hydra repeated it in such a manner that even Barnes hunched, despite he was well regarded. “In Stark’s teeth.”
So at breakfast, Rogers says, “I haven’t rested in nature for so long, You know, outside the city. It seems my last time was even before the Depression. After that my mother never had enough money to ride somewhere out. So I’d like to try it now. Light-handed, like it was before. I think modern people are too used to comfort and don’t appreciate it. Take it for granted.”
Tony leaned against the doorpost and watched Steve shaking his thighs and singing something under his breath.
“And it will be just in time to judge Pierce for his crimes.” Tony huffed. He looked almost indecently content; his eyes seemed unusually bright with his new tan which shouted of his well-being. For the whole two weeks Rogers had been checking battle-readiness of the Pacific fleet and of course he couldn’t leave Stark without his surveillance. “He is the last one. Others are just small fries, they already sincerely believe that Hydra and democracy are the same.”
On the sixth day after that disastrous interview, Tony came back home and smelled the instantly recognizable scent of apple pie. A crisp white tablecloth laid on the table beside the floor-to-ceiling window of the penthouse, and a wine bottle was cooling in an iced silver bucket between two lighted candles. Steve was standing with his back to Tony and dishing out something resembling fettuccine with salmon. He looked so beautiful in his plain white t-shirt, pants, and funny apron that Tony's breath hitched and eyes burned.
The priest cleared his throat, straightened his shoulders, and began, “Dearly beloved, we gather today to join two loving hearts…”
Besides, stories about models and cocaine parties (as well as LSD parties, champagne baths, tequila pools, and drunken orgies involving exotic animals) look much better than huge interviews of psychiatric superstars (or, more accurately, high-profile assholes). They tend to nod pompously and claim that Tony Stark, genius, playboy, philanthropist, and genius, has PTSD after his Afghanistan experience. What could they know about Afghanistan and experience? What?
“Your former friend with washed-out brains and bionic arm? Nobody has thought yet of a more or less sensible programming algorithm, really? It is totally ineffective to reset the combat unit every time. And this prosthesis of his… When was the last maintenance? I can hear the joint groaning from here.”
"No, Meghan. Once, at the beginning of us living together, Steve hid something important from me. He thought he would protect me from pain and disappointment, but it all turned out for the worst. I won't get into details, but at that moment we agreed we'd tell each other everything, whether it’s good or bad. Nevertheless, it wasn't easy for us."
Why is he smiling? Why and for what?! Tony doesn’t know what to think about his absurd and clumsy smile.
“No magic,” Strange answered quickly. Peter couldn’t blame him: a massive blue-and-red figure was rising threateningly behind the red-hot from rage and fast flight armor. “We discussed a scientific paradox.”
“If you want a scout tour, Rogers, you’ll get it,” Tony grumbles. “Tents, sleeping bags, and sausages on a fire, yeah?”
Tony didn’t say a word. He just kissed Steve in the middle of his palm, and that kiss was better and more final than anything Steve had experienced in his life. It was like a final drop into a tincture ready to crystallize. In just one moment an obscure liquid transformed into a whole world full of phantom wildwood, wonderful towers, and bridges, and there was no way back.
Steve couldn’t say a word even if he wanted to—emotions choked him. He stared at tan fingers: they went deep in the chest porthole where they tinted with blue and white because of the bright light. There they opened up a thin door of an intricate cell, and a pulsing fire started to beat faster—what was it? Could it be magnetism? Or ether? Or rebellious electricity? Or all that together?.. It beat to the rhythm of a heart and stuck to fingers as if it was afraid to...
So soon after his fucking, Tony's ass gaped without being touched, but Steve wanted more. With a consciously gentler touch than before, Steve pulled Tony’s hole to its limit. He didn't say much, or if he did, Tony couldn't understand him. He simply watched. Watched the unnatural stretch of Tony's fucked out hole, watched his come filling Tony's body. Watched as some of it leaked out of Tony and slowly slid downward, tickling his skin and raising gooseflesh.
“I don’t know who the hell this ‘Barnes’ is, I’ve never heard of him in my life,” Steve was glowering into the phone. “This isn’t an entry level position. Who are his references? Damnit, Carter, how difficult is this? When I said clear out the inexperienced applicants, I meant it. I’m not going to waste my time with novice no-names—shit, I’m here,” he interrupted his own tirade. “I have to go. I don’t trust Hill, she hired Sitwell; vet the applicants yourself, and whomever you think is worth my time, schedule him or her at my place at 11:30am tomorrow morning.”
Even with his eyes open the blindfold blocked out everything around him. Tony didn’t have a chance to question it before Steve even slipped something snug over his ears to block out all sound. Tony reminded himself that the students were gone and that Steve had promised the masters wouldn’t touch him again. So long as Steve was there, Tony knew he had no reason to panic - Steve would keep him safe, just as he’d promised. And now that his senses were limited to smell, taste, and touch, Steve made a point to exude more of his warmth so that Tony could feel his presence even from a short distance.
“He seems better, you know,” Clint said after a while. Steve wouldn’t look at him still, but he could hear a smile in his tone. “I don’t know if it’s you or what, but man. I never thought he’d be back here. You just don’t tell my brother he can’t do something; he’ll find a way,” Clint couldn’t help but point out, his tone lowered in his pride. “Didn’t matter if he was twelve and that bison was well over eighteen hundred pounds—”
But instead of spending the rest of his time wishing his flight had been scheduled earlier in the morning, Steve distracted himself by looking back over the IBD posts from the Cannes festival earlier in the year. Tony had nearly made Steve weep at the vision he made in his tuxedo. It had been a classic style, something that theoretically should have allowed him to anonymously walk the carpet on Steve’s arm and blend into the waves of other men in black and white tails as needed, but it was still Tony. His buoyant laugh, his loving eyes. And fortunately, every time Steve stared too long and forgot what he was supposed to do, Tony had been the steady reminder that kept him moving.
Bucky was on his heel in an instant. “Steve, what are you—Steve!” he snapped and shut the safe where Steve kept his weapons from his time in the army. “You know we can’t do that, what do you think you’re doing?”
Tony listened carefully in the hopes of finding the little tell-tale signs of how Steve felt. “Are you sure? You’re not going to scare me away if you, you know. If you do.”
“I practically lived in your bed for the past five months,” Steve continued, and it was enough of a non-sequitur that Tony gave him a curious look. “The more I think about it, the more I want you to have it. The mattress. I’ll order myself another one,” he promised when Tony’s jaw dropped. But Tony didn’t look mollified; he was gearing up for an argument. Steve quickly pushed the John Lewis bag into his hands before he lost ground. “The money for the mattress and for my share of living expenses is there.”
Tony didn’t know what to say. He had lost an operative, once. It wasn’t a double-oh, though somehow, he imagined that didn’t mean a damn. Watching it happen from a distance without any power to help, living in someone’s ear while they were hunted and killed - it was an experience he didn’t wish on anyone. The horror had nothing to do with titles or designations.
, Tony,” he whispered, his lips brushing over Tony’s skin with every word. “You, not the money. Never the money.”
When Steve was next distracted ordering a third round of rum and cocoa, Tony quietly asked Natasha to arrange for the artist of the tobogganer kings ornament to make them a full collection of all ornaments depicting himself and Steve. If he were lucky, it would not take the artist long, and Tony could hide them on the tree in their private drawing room to surprise Steve. He and Steve had already agreed on only exchanging one handmade gift for Christmas, so if he could get it on the tree (instead of under it) before Christmas Day, it wouldn’t count.
“Suit yourselves,” Thor pouted, curling his hands more protectively around his stein of tequila. “What do you know anyway? Too kinky for your Christian ears.”
Steve breached him slowly, and in his sleep-addled mind, Tony could have sworn it went on forever, filling Tony’s body until he scarcely had space left to breathe. He could feel his eyes rolling back into his head as consciousness faded into intangible pleasure and the mounting desire coiling deep within his body. A warm suction pulled on Tony’s nipple until it stung with pleasure, and with every leisurely, full-length thrusts, Steve further asserted his claim. If he had an ounce of strength left in his body, Tony would have latched on and urged Steve to put all his power into it, to core Tony’s body out in a way that no other man could satisfy.
“Do they use them to fight lions, too?” Harvey wanted to know, but Flora seemed upset by the thought.
“I, uh,” Tony stammered, blinking up at Steve in his shock. His Steve, his kind, gentle Steve? “Um, yeah? Yes, please?”
“You upgraded,” Natasha observed instead as she took in his new apartment. It was substantially bigger than the one-bedroom hole Tony once shared with Steve in the Lower East Side. Back then they barely paid attention to decor and design; they worked long hours and preferred to come home to their shared, comfortably familiar mess. Now, Tony had new, stylish furniture, living plants, and big windows with floor-length curtains that brought the large living room together with a refined, stately touch.
“The professionals call it a work-life balance,” Tony rumbled playfully once he pulled away, panting softly again against Steve’s parted lips. “You’re a big part of that, Steve. I want to marry you; I want you in my corner, full stop. You took seven months off to be with me before this,” Tony reminded him. “Did you regret it?”
If he was striking and elegant in public, he was breathtaking in private. In the hazy hours before dawn, with the world kept at bay beyond his bedroom door, the alert tension in his posture and flawless presentation gave way to loose limbs and soft hair. Asleep and carefree, the man was almost too beautiful to look at, with his long eyelashes, full bottom lip, and strong jawline. Tony was mesmerized, and would have been happy to continue cataloging the minute changes he could see in Steve’s existence as a private and a public man for hours on end.
After all the pampering and the treats Tony had spoiled Steve with today, Steve was ready for him. Gone were the sleepy legs and the groggy mind. He put Tony down long enough to sweep him up in a bridal carry and walk them to the bedroom. But Steve hadn’t really had much time in the suite before Tony knocked on the door, and while Tony nibbled and licked at his ear and offered no help whatsoever, he carried Tony into the office and then out to the jacuzzi overlooking Central Park.
Just hearing his voice brought a smile to Steve’s face. “Tony! You’re home late,” he called back. Slowly, and with more care than any healthy person would need, he shuffled around from the small breakfast nook separating the kitchen from the studio room in time to see Tony hang up his coat.
, Carol! Whatever your, your boyfriend told you is a goddamn lie. Tony is smart and clever, and he’s too damn strong to be bullied into some business arrangement by his parents.”
“You didn’t look worried when we first met, and your English was flawless,” Steve whispered, almost to himself, and Tony predictably leaned closer in his curiosity to hear more. “First day, you were something else, talking with everyone on the crew, the cast. I watched you—”
“This week’s your night to cook for movie night,” Sam said to Steve and Thor thoughtfully. “He likes sitting next to you anyway—”
“Did you get a chance to rest? Or have you been scrubbing the house all day?” Clint asked while he got his ingredients in order.
They moved in together days after deciding to give their relationship another try. Technically, it had started out as Tony’s apartment - except Steve had picked it out of three choices Tony liked equally, and Steve’s name was right next to Tony’s on all the papers that mattered. It was a two-storey penthouse apartment in Hell’s Kitchen built at the turn of the century, and what it didn’t have in view or fancy facades, it made up for in design. Steve had fallen for the privacy and the Spanish tiles, and Tony was glad they couldn’t see Stark Tower from any window. It hadn’t even been unreasonably priced, and Steve had offered to pay his half of the monthly cost, except there were none. Tony sold an original Goya from his private collection and paid off the apartment outright.
Tony couldn’t resist singing along to the classic tunes with a bright smile on his face. “They are mini-tunes, but I believe in your time you called them commercials, or advertising jingles. They are most cheerful and evocative - does it not bring back fond memories, Steve Rogers?”
The silence hung between them for a long, long time. Sarah stared at him, baffled to a point of shock.
This was what Steve had asked for, it was what he wanted. Steve sucked in a shallow breath, then went quiet and still. He knew this was the plan; this was exactly what he had asked for. But rational thoughts were irrelevant sometimes. Unbidden, his memories from the past, the fear and anxiety associated with being fucked, used up, and being discarded after, all hit at once. Instinctively, his toes curled, and his legs started to close even with Tony lying between his thighs. Despite the near-desperate need only seconds earlier, his erection started to wane.
“What is this place?” Tony whispered, intentionally keeping his voice low in case he started shouting uncontrollably about how many times Steve had been there with Benedita.
Steve could practically feel Bucky peering back at him over his safety glasses with a pained expression. “…now why the hell would I do something like that?”
Tony shut up immediately, but it only made Steve worry more. The only thing worse than a rambling Tony was a silent Tony.
“Tony, we’ve talked about this,” Steve reminded him with a smile warm in his voice. “You’re stating an opinion, not a fact. You don’t get to decide or tell me what my opinion is. So,” he finished, “what happened?”
Steve didn’t turn around to look after him to be on the safe side, but when Maria came back to him a few moments later, he quietly asked, “Did it work?”
“Think you’re ready for the toy, sweetheart?” Steve growled under his breath, and despite his cock’s eager twitch of interest, Tony glared up at him.
“Tony, sweetheart,” Steve rasped with a deep rumble that left Tony whimpering in reply. “Just woke up.”
“I don’t know where he was shot, I don’t want to move him—Tony? Tony, look at me,” Steve suddenly hissed as Tony’s eyes slipped shut. “Tony, talk to me, you—Tony, you’re going to be okay, look at me.”
But simply knowing that Tony was there, and hearing his soothing, even breaths made Steve want to snooze the morning away, and steal under the covers again to share a pillow with his boyfriend for endless hours.
Caffe Italia was an unassuming little spot not five minutes from Vauxhall. Five minutes was enough distance to discourage most SIS employees from overwhelming the space at every hour, but close enough that those in need of a break could entertain a short stroll for a decent cup of coffee and some homemade shortbread.
Tony waited with bated breath and barefaced hope, and, luckily, he didn’t have to wait very long. He couldn’t see his own face, but by the way Steve rolled his eyes and quietly chuckled with a slow shake of his head, Tony figured looking goofy was better than not having cinnamon buns with breakfast.
“Sure,” Steve whispered very, very quietly, trying not to shrink in his seat from embarrassment. His monosyllabic and unenthusiastic reply seemed to do the trick, however: Tony didn’t speak again.
No adrenaline rush was worth the loss of human life. No fulfilling car chase would ever restore Jane’s sense of security. Tony regretted every rotten word he’d ever said against the peaceful slumber of their serene civilization.
“You’re getting too comfortable letting me be your go-between, but I could have said it better. I’m sorry, Steve.”
“The scenes the killer took from? All three cases fall into the specific ‘so spectacular it had to be commemorated’ category. I don’t know how he would have know. I’ve been reading them out loud, I’m trying to compare them to see—even Pepper’s helped, and we think there may be a change in tone that a very careful reader might detect. I’ve convinced myself, anyway, that they could tell the difference between imaginary and real, but what I can’t figure out is how anyone can separate ‘real and planned’ from ‘real but improvised’,” he admitted with a frown. “I’ve been trying all afternoon, but I’m at the point where words don’t look like words anymore. I thought maybe you’d have more luck? All the real and staged scenes are here on the table. Everything printed is ‘real and improvised’, and they’re all arranged around the books or series they belong to.”
From breathless kisses in Tony’s office to eager, roaming hands in the library, they finally made their way to the living room in a laughing, tangled mass.
A morality box buzzed from the kitchen, but neither of them paid it any mind. Five credits might have paid for a loaf of fresh bread, but Tony was too relieved that Steve was dealing with his emotional blemishes in such a healthy and productive way.
Hammer looked him up and down with an unintelligible expression. There was no telling if he was checking Steve out or had other intentions, but eventually he heaved a dramatic sigh and looked Steve in the eyes. “When they said some bookworm figured out the pattern, you weren’t what I pictured… Guess you got some brain for that brawn, am I right?”
The heat really wasn’t all that bad, but after just ten minutes of digging, the layers had to come off. He pulled off his long sleeves and tossed it into the back of the truck.
“Bark Magazine, Chris, such a pleasure,” Tony continued happily, and even Steve gave him a curious look. “Seriously, I can't wait. This is the first time I've ever heard that we have a puppy contingent in our fan base; is this cause I'm the new guy? Did you keep this from me?” he demanded of Steve suddenly, and Steve looked like he wasn't sure if he should laugh, or if Tony had officially lost it.
is,” Chief Director Fury snarled, “you need a steward. The conditions of your parole are full reinstatement into the NYPD and immediate assignment to the apprehension of Brock Rumlow. On the recommendation of your steward at the end of your parole it will be determined whether you can be granted gold class status as part of returning you to an equal class which you enjoyed at the time of your sentencing.”
Steve’s first clear thought was everything felt pleasantly fuzzy. Everything was beautiful and wonderful and so sweet in his cocoon of delicious cotton candy.
From the minute Steve stepped out of his dorm room, he could feel people watching him. Most of the curiosity came from people he vaguely recognized - other first-years who knew about his unusual background and remembered the shock when Hawley picked him for one of the four coveted internship spots.
“Oh, wow,” Steve said after a momentary silence, genuinely surprised and at a loss for words. This was the Magic Mike guy? “Uh. Thanks, thank you, I appreciate that. And you’re, uh, you’re such a good dancer.”
He didn’t have to tell Tony to stay on the platform. The thought that Tony might disobey him - or that he might try to escape - was laughable at best.
And it wasn’t an emergency, was it? Steve looked at the beautifully decorated wicker basket next to him with its assortment of 24 enormous muffins. He was at Harvard Law School, in the finest clothes, all because his mother loved and believed in him, and his professors had been there when he needed them.
“You made that decision for both of us. Why didn’t you talk to me? Rhodes said you’d known about it for months, why—you never treated me like I was dumb or incapable, so why this? Why was I not qualified to be a part of this decision, Tony?” Steve demanded—begged—to know. “There was nothing we couldn’t do, if we worked together.”
“Hardly five and a half,” Tony felt the need to add, but Steve gave him a flat look that told him just how irrelevant such a detail was.
to becoming Mr. Brock Rumlow III, son of the governor and a future politician in his own right. If he was even half the man Steve knew him to be, he would be a Congressman before their second wedding anniversary.
Bucky stared across at his partner in the kind of disbelief that, not for the first time, begged the question of how Tony had ever made it to this age, but Rhodey shook his head slowly and went back to his paperwork. Some questions were better left unanswered.
“Was acting something you’d always wanted to do?” Georgie wondered, and Tony’s honest answer was a little shrug.
“No, nothing like that,” Steve replied with a smile. He took Tony’s hands in his and squeezed them gently. “The case is closed, Tony. My paperwork is done. There’s nothing more I can do right now, the rest is up to the FBI. We can do anything you want: we can stay in and order take out, we can go on our second date to the Factory Bar. The last time I felt stressed and in over my head, you took care of me,” he lowered his voice to say, “let me do the same for you, Tony.”
“It’s not his dick that’s magic, Barnes!” Tony shouted after him, turning heads all around the garage. “It’s the whole package!”
A long, soft moan escaped Tony’s lips as Steve started finger fucking him to spread more and more lube inside him, until he was fisting the bedsheets. “Sock!” he gasped the first time Steve grazed by his prostate, “sock, sock sock sock, can’t—”
Tony let her threat roll off his back with an easy grin, but the moment his back was turned, he furtively hurried his pace. Rhodey didn’t forget shit, and the last thing Tony needed was his best friend with some mission to keep any tabs on him.
. It was before I knew this project was taking off, and I approached the book as a story about an isolated man who returns after World War II, where he has seen the worst of humanity, and instead of finding the love and life he loved and wanted to protect, he is now facing problems that he is powerless to effectively address. To a great extent, that speaks to Cap’s experience, and thinking through Pollock’s perspective was meaningful in capturing his isolation, so, that was how the story first came to me. And I like my books as books, you know what I mean? As paperbacks with paper pages, because I, when I read, I like making notes in the margins. I like flagging the parts that stand out to me, for whatever reason. Now, Tony,” he added with a small sigh that should have been exasperated but verged on exceedingly fond. “When Tony learned that Peter was signed on to this project, he sent Peter my book. With all my old notes about how Russell’s experience could help frame Cap’s perspective, and apparently that connection to Cap helped Peter find Arvin’s place in all of this. Which is great, it was all for the better, but that certainly was not to my credit. And, you know, he still hasn’t given me my book back,” Steve finished with a wry expression.
Peter stared at them with hope. They were so different and at the same time so equally stubborn in their will to protect what was right and important for each of them. They bumped and sparked over and over again, like two flints, and only they could warm this world… or burn it down.
“Stark swept it from the sea six months before his death,” he said. “And a separate paragraph in his will declared that he wanted you to have this thing. After you were found.”
But Tony wants to sleep because of the sudden weary warmth and not because of the cold. So he thinks it’s okay. Snow falls and falls. No, it’s a bad idea to sleep under the snow, Cap is right. Tony keeps his eyes open, and it’s way harder than he could imagine. In the end, he falls asleep.
“You’re such a puppy, Rogers. Сute, goofy and always underfoot,” Tony decides in the end. “Like Dum-E or Butter Fingers.”
“Natasha reported something strange,” he said and leaned to Peter as if he was a three years old kid. “Who are you, son?”
“Not a big deal, St. Patrick's Cathedral is just a step away, and it remains intact,” Steve said equally automatically. They stared at each other in the same amazement.
“So it is Bruce, in the end? I don’t think you had many chances to fall in love with the other genius—and also, a man. I understand you, he is awesome, but he is hetero, for sure, and he personally said that you aren’t his type. If that is the case, it seems that there is something between him and Natasha.”
“Fried marshmallow is way more delicious. Leave space for it,” Clint adds in a disgustingly sentential tone.
Tony cursed under his breath and stepped back for a moment. Dread flooded Steve, but it turned out that Tony just needed to undress. After that Tony pressed even closer to him, skin to skin, and all dread disappeared right then and there, melting like an ice cube in a fire. Tony’s prominent Adam’s apple, his firm collarbones with a soft hollow between them, the scars sprawling over his chest (Steve caressed them with his lips, barely touching), the fast tap dance of the heart (it echoed in Steve himself) — all this was for real. Steve tried and failed to believe it once and for all.
Nat also wore a simple gold chain around her neck and occasionally she’d pull her hair back with a delicate gold clip. Red and gold were some of Nat’s signature colors, besides black, and so Steve had incorporated gold into the art of her.
Sam rapped on a door when they arrived and there was some music littering out from it. The dorms in this section were larger, at least double what Steve and Sam’s were, and more like suites. After a minute, a lanky boy with darker skin than Sam opened the door. He had a warm grin but the same set shoulders all ROTC kids had.
Nat also loved to wear gold jewelry. Her long fingers were coated in thin gold bands and she wore a bracelet that had gold beads. She teased (or at least Steve assumed it was teasing but he was never sure when it came to Natasha), that when she pressed the bracelet a certain way the gold balls would tase anyone who tried to get handsy,
“That was not how my mother did it,” Steve told him in a whisper. “Tony, I’ll follow the rules in the Palace. I’ll be quiet about people cleaning up after me like I’m a bedridden child, I’ll give up my privacy. But nobody - not your ancestors, not Queen Elizabeth, and not even you are going to tell me how to connect with people.”
“I know someone,” Tony said then in a slow, thoughtful voice. “He comes highly recommended. We’ll go to him and talk, and, and hear what recommendations he has. If he thinks this is something we can work on, and you are willing to work on it… okay. One chance.”
Tony’s pleased, bashful smile was more beautiful than anything Steve might see through the windows, and he found he couldn’t look away.
Tony must have drifted off at some point. He rolled over in Steve’s arms until they were chest to chest, and Tony could rest his head comfortably on Steve’s shoulder to rest. “Is this a dream?” he mumbled in a whisper, his voice so quiet Steve wasn’t even sure Tony was speaking to him. “You stay with me?”
They had spent the better part of their late teens at Shield, drinking root beer and catching whatever game was in season without their mothers chiding them for shouting at every bad call the ref made.
He said it so softly that Tony wasn’t sure he was meant to hear it. Tony pressed a chaste, lingering kiss to Steve’s cheek before straightening in Steve’s lap to watch his face more carefully.
Steve would burn in hell for this some day, he just knew it. How badly did he want to go along with it and try again? Tony had explained himself, he had apologized. What more could Steve ask of him? Tony was making it so easy.
“The on switch is over the right cheek,” he told Steve as he put on his own helmet and flicked it on. “Now, you only need to relax. We will begin momentarily. Dim lights,” he added to the room at large, and the warm lights mellowed to a dim evening glow.
“The most important, difficult fucking decision of my miserable life, you don’t think I thought about it?” Tony all but hissed, trying to speak quietly even when he couldn’t contain his heartache. “I just—I couldn’t do it, Steve. I, the risk? What’s my fucking life compared to thousands?”
was a mess. Diving had ended weeks before graduation, and between finals and being miserably lonely, Steve hadn’t groomed from the neck down for almost two months. Even if Tony understood that he was less than perfectly hairless now, he probably wouldn’t expect the amount of body hair hiding under Steve’s clothes now. After all, his chest hair didn’t end at his pecs, it dusted over his torso and abdomen, and
Gently, he put pressure on the chain. Tony followed his lead until they stood toe to toe and shared the same air. Steve only needed to lean his head forward to rest his forehead against Tony’s.
Tony rolled his eyes, and instead went to pick up a rope like he had used the day before. “We’ll be fine.”
“So, uh,” their novice interviewer began, eyeing Tony cautiously. “I have some questions for you from our loyal readers. These are all for both of you,” he clarified before kicking things off by asking, “What is your favorite new toy?”
,” Maria told him in a flinty, clipped tone that had both Tony and Clint shuddering in their chairs.
When he turned to leave, Tony found he didn’t really want to. He didn’t want to be that far from Steve. In the end, the decision wasn’t difficult to make: Tony undressed quietly and crawled in under the covers. Steve’s voice floated through his consciousness, and Tony closed his eyes to relax as he listened to the sound of his voice.
“Our computer’s algorithms are more effective and efficient than one meat-eater’s suspicions,” Fury replied with a low, dangerous bite in every word. “It has considered every feasible scenario in order to calculate his next target. Do not project your own inclination for violence onto others, Captain Steven G. Rogers. Just because you fail to contain your primal urges does not mean that he cannot.”
A slow, shaky inhale interrupted them for a beat before Tony composed himself. “Are you experiencing pain in your chest, Steve Rogers? Can you breathe without pain?”
It had all been so perfect until the very end, but just because Brock couldn’t see past their differences didn’t mean Steve had to accept it. Sure, he didn’t have some fancy family tree or prized politicians in his family, but there was no rule that said he couldn’t be just as good as they were.
“Pepper, my ex. She’s a school teacher, second grade. She’s… she’s special,” he said like it was a promise. “You’ll see her if we go out; she loves to dance. My best friend, Rhodey, he owns and runs this converted barn—the best drinks, great music. Mechanical bull,” he added with a smirk and a playfully exaggerated wink. “We call him the Captain.”
But instead of obeying his demands, he only got a quiet laugh in reply and a squeeze of his shoulder. “Tony, we got less than an hour before we’re live on the Today show, we can’t—we don’t have time to—”
“Boy, are they going to love you,” Tony drawled sarcastically, drawing a surprised laugh out of Steve. “I don’t even know how you could make that any worse. Vegan?”
Tony had forgotten something back at his place and promised to meet up with Steve as quickly as he could. They were going to dinner; he asked Steve to wait for him at the bar, relax after a long day. Steve had been given a key when he checked in at the desk, but he had no interest in seeing the room without Tony. Instead, he handed his things off to the concierge, who were kind enough to take his duffle and his portfolio up to the suite. Tony had said he wouldn’t be long, so Steve took his advice to sit at the bar, where he could enjoy the calm and nurse his beer until Tony got there.
An hour later, Stephanie took them to a clearing where the sun shone. She lifted the discombobulating haze from Tony’s mind, and, when her dragon took to resting far enough away from them, the fear of being scorched or eaten alive lifted from Clint’s thoughts. They could sit together around a small fire, drink from the clear spring water Stephanie generously shared, and speak of what was to be.
That was when Tony noticed their reflection in the mirror. Clear as day, he could watch himself and Steve—he could watch Steve fucking him, taking him apart, like his very own private viewing channel. There were recent scratches across Steve’s chest and over his shoulder, contrasted clearly against the red blush coloring his skin. Tony had no memory of scratching him up, but he felt a surge of pride and lust in the knowledge that the marks were his. A flash of shameless desire overcame him with this new perspective of their position, the obscene display of how he’d been folded in half and spread open for Steve’s taking. Heat pooled behind his cock, and he thrust up instinctively, but there was still no mouth, no hand, no heat to find satisfaction in. Tony had never come without touching his cock before, and he was so close, so desperate for release; the way Steve’s thick cock filled him with every thrust, the slow, punishing burn of his rim, all of it was enough to bring Tony repeatedly to the edge of release, taunting him with both pain and pleasure, but never enough to push him over.
“One last date,” Tony mumbled unintelligibly behind his hands, then finally dropped his hands in defeat and took a deep, steadying breath. “Fuck. It’s—I’ve got him on the ropes, I’m so close I can taste it.”
Bucky watched him quietly for some time before replying. “We had to pull out of tunnel 11 last year. That’d be my guess.”
“This feels good,” was the first thing he told Jane as he stepped out of the dressing room. “How does it look?”
“Buck, it’s only been four days,” Steve tried to explain, when beside him, Tony rolled over and looked up at him. Tony wasn’t pleasantly rumpled and half-asleep like the other times Steve had seen him waking up: he was wide awake, and he was visibly worried.
They made it to Tony’s studio. Steve had stood there in the little space that served as Tony’s living room, bedroom, and dining room while Tony filled a pint glass with water for the fresh cut flowers.
“Now, hold your horses, Tony. Not that it matters, but Laura’s grown up just like everybody else, and she’s a beautiful young woman. She even took home the Flower Crown in last year’s Rose Fair, and she’s a kind, remarkable lady besides,” Maria told him, then turned to Clint with a proud smile. “Forgive your brother, darling. He likes flashy blondes and little else.”
“Here you are… jogging on the beach, or auditioning for Baywatch? We’ll never tell. And what’s this?” Graham whispered in a deep rumble. He had stopped at a candid photo of Tony in his running tights, wiping the sweat off his face with the bottom of his shirt. The photo was taken at an angle, nearly at profile, and it showed off his strong thighs, a teasing flash of his abs, and most importantly, highlighted the perky, generous curve of his ass.
From across the kitchen, Steve stopped mid-way through separating an egg and turned to look at Tony over his shoulder. Sure enough, he was back in the armchair he’d pulled up to the kitchen table where Steve had abandoned some offers the previous night. Steve preferred a regular kitchen chair to read in for work since it kept him from getting too comfortable, but Tony leaned hard in the opposite direction - especially if he was reading scripts for Steve. He cozied up with a script like a new thriller by a favorite author, and if he was quiet for more than thirty minutes, Steve knew it was a winner.
“Jim, you’ll never know how badly I needed to hear those words,” Steve whispered unevenly as his exhaustion as his relief mounted into a new state of delirium. “I am deeply grateful.”
Yet when he finally got a good look at the monstrosity of a man whom Tony had pissed off, the tables turned immediately. Whatever he was, the man had a foot and easily a hundred pounds on Steve.
“Except when you’re with me, of course,” he finished with a playful nonchalance. “You are my priority, Tony. What we have together matters to me.”
“Maybe just, reach out more often the next time you leave?” she suggested mildly, “or invite him up north?”
“No solicitors wanted,” Steve mumbled around the tail-end of his yawn. “Try a library if you want the paper.”
What man was he to turn down that kind of an invitation? Tony pulled his clothes off without any grace or modesty and crawled into bed to plaster himself against Steve’s gorgeous, inviting, and very
They finished with the computer and took the stairs back down to ground level. Tony’s resolve lasted until the 47th floor where he finally promised not to jump into sacrifice plays and demanded to be let down. They rejoined the party long enough to show their faces to the right people, then got out of there before their luck ran out.
“Be good,” Steve murmured into Tony’s ear as the robe was shoved aside, exposing him entirely to the customer and to their audience. When the creature caressed Tony’s inner thigh, admiring him, what envy he might have felt for the beautiful, glossy skin was immediately forgotten and replaced with fear: whatever this creature was, it didn’t have skin, it had coarse scales. It’s cold, jagged palm squeezed around his balls hard enough to make Tony kick out and shout in pain, but his strength was of no concern to Steve, and nothing he did could free him from Steve’s vice grip.
“Right. The one who’d stuff newspapers in his shoes,” Steve added quickly, grasping for details that Bucky might remember from their childhood. “My mom’s name is Sarah.”
Shoes on and leash in hand, he pulled the door open for his excitable girl. She tap-danced down the stairs and leapt the final step to the pavement, where she stopped to wait for Tony to lock up and trundle down after her.
“He asked me to come out for a day and play the kid’s teacher,” Steve continued to say as if Tony wasn’t busy staring at gulls and gaggles of teenagers pretending to be hip. “Apparently, he wants my best impersonation of Charlie Brown’s teacher.”
“I apologize for my untender tone, Steve Rogers. Unsanctioned life terminations are upsetting to us all, but I should not take it out on you who depends on me,” he said in the awkward silence between them. “With genuine effort, I will do my best to make this world more at home for you, Captain. Perhaps you would like to hear some music from your time to feel more at ease? Our oldies station is the most popular station in town, it will not disappoint you.”
Eventually, Tony knocked back the last of his drink and cleared his throat. “Yeah. Yeah, we broke up. Two weeks ago,” he added and tried to smile. “Time to get over it, you know?”
“It’s Tony,” Steve said quietly, looking at a particularly captivating crack in the pavement he wish he could fall into. “He… uh, he’s been stressed out. I think. He’s not really answering texts, or phone calls. I don’t know wh—”
“I like that blue,” Clint said when they met up in the hallway, grinning at his brother. “I was afraid you’d go for white.”
“Tony, I’ve missed you,” he whispered then, and Tony turned his head back towards him, his eyelids fluttering open in his sleephaze.
Steve sat motionless on the sofa for some time thinking about what he should do. His first instinct was to call Tony and leave him a video message thanking him for listening to Jim and Natasha, but if Tony saw him now… Steve couldn’t do that to him. In the end, Steve decided to take a quick shower, take the sleeping pills Coulson kept offering him, and left instructions not to be disturbed for ten hours.
Steve needed a moment of silence to regret the serum’s two-fold curse of enhanced visual problem-solving and an eidetic memory.
In the early days of winter, once the issues of taxes, citizenship, and social benefits were finalized, Tony finally gained some traction. His first victory had been a fellowship for graduate work in trauma counseling. On the heels of that success passed an initiative to fund employment opportunities for recent graduates from old Machtberg in Terrini, whether they were civil engineers, school teachers, or medical care providers. They called it the Queen’s Exchange Initiative in Sarah’s memory. Steve had been behind both proposals, and as satisfying as standing in Parliament and seeing the votes on their proposal cast in their favor, Tony’s victory was still outdone by the grateful smile Steve greeted him with later that day.
In the end, Steve avoided calling Tony fat, scrawny, or small, and even convinced him to settle for one of the classics: the current white or blue jersey.
“A dinner date can’t be leftovers until, what, the tenth date?” Tony decided without so much as asking for input. “I wanted to take you to the Factory Bar. They have these apple and bacon dumplings I thought you might like.”
“They are Scraps, voluntary outcasts from our peaceful society,” Pierce answered Steve with measured words. “They cower in abandoned tunnels and sewers, where they live off the scraps they find or steal.”
The happy surprise of Steve’s words warmed Tony from head to toe with excitement. If he kissed Steve again, they’d never rejoin the party, and while that didn’t sound so bad, they had promised to stay for dinner.
Tony narrowed his eyes at him, suspicious of the word ‘short’ so close to a blatant compliment. “I’m not sure I like it when you’re clever,” he murmured thoughtfully, mostly to himself, but Steve’s face warmed with a little smirk, as if he was amused that Tony had caught on to the jab. But he had handled Tony’s admission better than Tony could have hoped for, so he wasn’t about to question his good fortune—after all, Steve had every right to be angry about the blatant lie.
With an off-hand comment about Steve’s greedy ass taking up all the space, Tony kicked his shoes off and climbed onboard. After all, if there was no space for him to nap on the couch because of Steve, Steve only had himself to blame.
…” Steve said with an exaggerated sigh, but as predictable as ever, Tony responded to the silly references with a beaming smile and renewed excitement.
“I picked up some curry,” Tony told him, blissfully unaware of Steve’s unhelpful thoughts. “Lamb and eggplant for you, pumpkin and paneer for me.”
“You heard them fighting your whole childhood?” he asked quietly, following Tony’s lead into a long hallway.
“A little louder, please, I don’t think the Prime Minister heard you,” Steve muttered. “Look, I don’t have anything against Harry Potter, Tony, I just don’t want to spend our two and a half hours in the city stopping off at movie locations. We’re in one of the most historic and exciting cities in the world, there is so much else we could be spending our time doing.”
Steve opened his mouth to say something when the announcement was made that first class passengers were welcome to begin boarding. “That’s us,” he said instead, then got up and offered his hand to help Tony to his feet. “Anything I need to know before we get in?”
“If he is not there, we might at least find a lot of people who know of good places to hide in the city. Scraps are people, too, Stark,” Steve added in a gentler voice. “They don’t deserve Rumlow any more than your New Yorseylvanians.”
Bucky shrugged. “77 isn’t unthinkable. There’s always Viagra. Maybe he was researching a book about World War II?”
The minute the three of them were all free from their respective meetings, Thor, Tony, and Bruce all hustled into Tony’s office and shut the door behind them.
In the two weeks since he’d returned to his own job, Tony rarely heard from his old team (his old family). The most substantial update he got was a text from Sam thanking him for pooling the phrases, word choices, and patterns of speech that the sugar babies used to communicate with their prospective daddies. It wasn’t easy reeling in highly-sought sugar daddies, and like everyone else, each daddy had his own preferences. For people like Natasha, Bucky, and Sam the mannerisms and flirting style of sugar babies might as well have been in Greek. With Tony’s bank of introductory messages, flirty innuendos, and witty remarks that served to show intelligence without being intimidating, they had some scaffolding to get them started.
All heads turned to stare at Steve, again. All, but one. Fury glared at Tony from across the conference table, and without a word Tony could feel the rising fear that he was failing. This was his chance to demonstrate his aptitude and maturity, and he couldn’t even prevent his insubordinate charge from speaking out of line.
“Hang on, my question first,” Bucky insisted, and before Steve could get a word in edgewise, Bucky and Tony shared a look worth unpacking. Steve wanted to call a time-out and see what had just passed between those two, but Tony was speaking again before he got the chance.
“Tony, I’m so sorry—I came as fast as I could,” Steve was telling him, not that his words made any sense.
“Second,” Steve pushed on, doing his best to keep a straight face. “Tony, I’m all hair. If anyone should be worried, it’s me—like, we’re lucky it’s not coming out of my ears yet, but fair warning, it’ll probably happen in a few years time, okay? I didn’t think about grooming cause I never thought you’d… uh,” Steve gave Tony a bashful smile he hoped conveyed ‘come to bed with me,’ but instead he said, “Catch me looking like a hairball.”
“Say no more,” Sam said in a clipped tone, and there it was. The proverbial kick in the teeth. He should have just braced for it, let them rip into him and move on, but Steve held up his phone to show them he had absolutely no messages waiting on his lock screen.
Steve sipped his drink without saying a word, but he draped his arm over the back of Tony’s chair just to close the distance between them. Tony didn’t stop pawing at his arm, and soon his chest, and across the table, Bucky scoffed.
“Tony,” Tony said quietly, eyeing the little terrier that only barely seemed to restrain himself from bouncing with glee. Steve, with his blue eyes, pearly white teeth, and unreal wingspan seemed just as happy to see him.
Pepper looked at him like he’d grown a third and then even a fourth head. “...you want to run home because of some flowers?”
Tony pursed his lips in frustration, glanced down at his own shoes for some time. When he looked up at Dr. Odinson again, he quietly said, “My ex. Eight years ago.”
“Oh, you think that’s it, it’s over? You can’t just leave us hanging!” Stephen finally complained, and Tony’s composure broke with another burst of giggling, delighted laughter. “Stick around, we’ll be right back with more Tony Stark!”
Some of them would not return, and for what? Rumlow was not threatening their way of life, their laws. They were either dumber than Tony had ever imagined, or braver than any New Yorseylvanian gave them credit for.
Steve rolled his eyes, but rather than give in to Bucky’s childish bickering he considered what Bucky said more carefully. “You think he was always that lonely? He had enough social skills to get married once. Why wouldn’t someone like that be able to find a girlfriend or… anyone?”
As the alcohol had faded from his system the night before, so had Tony’s insecurities about their relationship. This morning, brunch had been a laid back, unhurried affair, an opportunity to indulge. They had very quickly become the obnoxious couple who could enjoy each other’s quiet company as easily as they could fold into passionate arguments about the use of modern CGI and green screen, or the pros and cons of having a global food basket that gives some access to fresh strawberries every day of the year, while others can’t afford to eat local crops.
It wasn’t news; Steve had made his feelings clear on multiple occasions in the months leading up to Tony’s graduation. But his faith in Tony always had the same effect, and even now, in a relatively unfamiliar campus, Tony desperately wanted to find a corner where they could hide and he could express his sudden inspiration of gratitude.
The CompuKiosk was a computer terminal in an open booth that was operated by a series of buttons organized in four rows. There were the expected access points, like an Atlas, Banking, Mail, and Telephone Directory. But the second row of buttons read, Ego Boost, Citizen Confessional, Public Psychiatrist, and Serenity Sayings. Rumlow couldn’t resist.
. “So, we are back with an action-packed fourth installment. The good Captain, handsome as ever and at the height of his powers, and we have everything we can expect of a massive blockbuster. But, this may come as a surprise, ladies and gentlemen: under those smart three piece suits and grungy workshop sweats, what do you know? We have a pretty fit and spry Tony Stark, as well.”
Tony nestled in close, too. Steve wriggled his hand through the clouds of magic keeping him warm until he found Tony’s hand. Tony returned the squeeze and moved in even closer. Steve could even smell the salty brine in his hair.
Tony couldn’t wait to introduce Steve to all of it, and after an early end to an otherwise long day, he raced back to the Palace to find his husband. After a short search, Tony found him in the ground floor library.
It took all of Tony’s strength to resist averting his eyes in his shame. He had been so caught up in looking forward to basking in Steve’s anchoring affection that he hadn’t put two and two together. As a teen, Steve had found his dad executed and heartlessly discarded. He did the only thing he could have then, he carried his father’s body back so that he could receive a deserved resting place. Then for his mother to keep her illness from him, leaving him to watch her waste away over several days. Tony couldn’t imagine the trauma. As much as he missed his own mother, Tony had never known her, and Howard… well, Howard’s only role in Tony’s life had been to point out Tony’s faults and weaknesses - every way Tony needed to improve to deserve the throne. His two nannies had lived long, healthy lives that were filled with love, family, and friends outside of the palace.
The conference room door opened and revealed the mysterious redhead Steve already considered a friend. She acknowledged Hawley with a nod as she took her seat.
“I’m going to take them home and find a place for them upstairs where I’ll always see them until you come home. I miss you, Tony. Thank you for thinking of me.”
But more often than not, Steve used Tony’s cock like he used his ass - ravenous, insatiable, and impatient, like nothing mattered except wringing the orgasm from Tony’s body.
Bucky glowered after his partner and marched after him to catch up. “And just for that, I’m driving: give me the keys.”
