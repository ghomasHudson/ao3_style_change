“Did- would you want to do that? To stay over?” Dean asked, fixing his glasses and staring at his feet.
"I guess I made a little mess and forgot to clean it up, no biggie, man." Dean replied, kicking at a stray spoon on the floor.
“Take another left up ahead, then stay right, there's a dirt turn-off.” Cas said as he kept looking around the road.
The rest of the day passed in monotony. Classes had passed by so blandly and slowly that by the time the final bell rang he had forgotten his promise to meet Castiel after school. He would have blown off the situation all together, if not for Castiel’s persistence. He stood overly long at his locker, staring in and wondering if he’d forgot something. But making his way to his car Dean could see him, half across the school parking lot, leaning against the impala and finishing the last dregs of a cigarette.
Dean shook his head and focused back on his own food. He had only taken a few bites of his burger and the fluttering in his stomach was staving away his hunger.
The smell of cinnamon and pastry wafted through the apartment, and when Dean took a step inside he couldn't help the deep inhale he took.
It was a cold November Monday when he dropped Sammy off at his middle school and headed off to his own classes. The parking lot was just as over-filled as he parked the impala and the hallways were just as loud and stifling as he made his way to his first period.
“Right.” Jo confirmed. “And she’s the one whose basically running the winter art show. Hers is the centerpiece and she asked me to come see. But I don’t wanna like, go alone, ya know? I could totally strike out. But if I had my totally cool wingman with me we could totally make fun of some dorky art if she blows me off.”
He shook his head and tucked in closer to Dean, pulling the blanket tighter around them. “I know you don't like it. Plus I didn't grab them. I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could. He's such a fucking assbutt I couldn't deal with it.”
"I've been telling Sam what I want you to do for a month now, and that seems to be getting absolutely nothing done so far."
It was easy to hate Cas, or at least he had told himself he hated him. About a year after he quit anticipating his phone calls he promised himself if Cas ever called he would shout in his face and hang up. So far, he was par for the course, but it didn’t help the niggling wonder what the hell he had done to make his supposed best friend cut him out completely. Every time he felt a pang of regret or pain of guilt he just repeated the same mantra over and over again to himself.
“Did I or did I not see Cas freakin Novak walking through the halls looking like the wrong end of Hot Topic?”
echoed through the intimate space of the room. They both sat stock still, waiting for who knows what to either stop them, or let them go on in peace.
Dean was stoked to be back home and have nothing to do for the next five days. On his way out of school Charlie tried to guilt him into joining her D&D group that weekend, but he had totally deflected and changed the subject and then got out of there before she remembered. Now he was playing Fallout 3 and eating a whole pizza by himself because Sammy was staying over at his friend Kevin’s and Mary was working a late shift at the hospital.
When he found the source of the photo he was elated to see it tagged #me. He scrolled through the rest of the blog, and it was quite obviously someone’s photography side blog, with no link to their personal. It just said
He slipped his hands under Dean's t-shirt, feeling the broad planes of his chest and scraping his blunt nails down the warm skin of his back. With another swirl of his hips he found himself grinding against Dean's clothed ass and nipping at his neck. Cas' stubble was a welcome burn against Dean's jaw, and he tightened his fingers in his hair, letting slip an over-eager
. He wasn’t sure what it meant, but he was definitely sure he wanted to know what that bed was like.
Dean laughed as Cas sleepily hopped up from the couch, almost knocking himself back down. He slipped his hand into Dean's and mumbled a c'mon lets go while shuffling quietly towards the stairs. He nearly jumped out of his skin when he felt Cas' hand in his, but the insistent tug towards his room kept him grounded. He followed Cas up the stairs and into his own room, and stood stock still when Cas let go of his hand to wiggle out of his jeans and hoodie, and collapsed hard and face first into the far side of the mattress.
“It was, y’know. It was Christmas.” He said distractedly, trying to keep his eyes on the road. “There was a big tree. And some presents. Books. DVDs. Sam gave me a necklace. My grandpa gave me a pile of plaid. Watched Doctor Who and ate a whole pie. Christmas-y.”
"Your brother has told stories of your past promiscuity, I didn't expect you to change your behavior simply because you sleep with me on occasion." Another tidbit he supplied like it was an unavoidable fact. Dean could feel himself emotionally reeling from it.
"Welp. Go see what he wants." Dean punctuated himself with a slap on Cas' thigh and he leaned away from their shared heat.
"Dean sweetie, would you be a dear and load those chairs into the back of Ellen's truck?" Mary call out out from the kitchen.
"This isn’t me yelling at you, Cas. You’ll know when I’m yelling at you. And honestly I don’t wanna have to yell at you. Hell, I don’t even wanna
Dean stopped in his tracks and turned, trudging back to where Cas was still standing. He stared him down, but Cas looked earnest. "After school." He sighed out with an eye roll. He turned again and rushed off down the hallway before Cas could really get a hold of the situation.
By the time lunch rolled around Dean was starving. He ran through the lunch line as fast and he could and hurried to his usual table, overloaded tray in hand. Charlie’s eyes widened in surprised as his tray clattered down full onto the table.
Dean was running late. He knew he was. So when he heard Becky’s excited whimpers on the other side of his open locker door, he contemplated just crawling in until she left. He closed his locker with a little more force than necessary, and let out a big sigh when he saw her beyond happy expression.
“Yeah I’m not really sure what any of that means. So the car stuff is done? Is not done? What’s going on?” He asked with a questioning eyebrow. Mary laughed into her wine glass across the kitchen table.
eerie. It was also a little flattering. He stepped closer and let his fingers roam over the plane of plastic covering it, like he could feel his own face underneath it. A glint under it caught his eye, and he finally saw the name plate.
Cas nodded his head again, eyes still on the ground, and pulled his leather jacket tighter around his waist. "I’ll just go then." He said quietly, stepping away from the impala.
“Let’s just find Meg, okay? I’m supposed to be your wingman. This,” he gestured at the painting “doesn’t change why we’re here.”
He faced the board and tried to listen to Mr Fitzgerald talk about whatever the hell they were currently studying, Shakespearean sonnets or something. He didn’t really care. There was a poem structure written on the whiteboard and he doodled it in the margins of his notebook, next to a lopsided TARDIS and a really big AC/DC.
“Yeah I'm going to probably make a Facebook event and send it to everyone with the confirmed details. But I just wanted to throw it out there before you all go home and log into whatever things take up your time."
"Yes, two in the oven. Can you please watch the timer and pull them out when it beeps? Bobby offered to do the grilling, but he can't get the new grill figured out and I need to go help him real quick."
"Cas, if you want me to buy groceries, or vacuum of whatever, you have to tell me. I can't read your mind, and I definitely don't understand angry huffing and slamming doors." Dean felt himself getting angrier, crossing the kitchen, getting closer to Cas and shouting back louder.
Dean sighed again and turned to Jo. She gave him a sympathetic look and mouthed “Sorry” before standing to take control of the room. Dean sat back into his chair and watched the rest of the club move around the folding chairs into a wide circle and gather in the middle. He reluctantly got out of his chair to join the group and get the game started.
Dean moused over out of tumblr and clicked at the Skype chat list, hoping for a little green icon alerting him to Clarence’s online arrival, but he still remained offline.
. He stomped back into the room and snatched up Dean's hand, yanking him up from the ground and towards the door. Michael stayed in the hallway, arms crossed and trying yet again to call Castiel's name, but to no avail. He pulled Dean back down the hall, and it was all he could do to hang onto Cas' hand and keep his glasses on his face.
"Sam told me your birthday was this week. I recalled your previous disagreement on the merits of pie versus cake, and figured you would find this more agreeable than a birthday cake." Cas stated, not looking up from the sink.
The silence sat thick around them, sucking up all the air in the room. Neither of them could look the other in the face, eyes skirting the corners of the room.
"Boys could you move your backpacks from the bottom of the stairs?" Mary called out from the doorway, stepping over the offending bags, balancing a big paper bag of take-out in her arms. The boys bounded down the stairs quickly when they heard her voice. Sam swiped the backpacks and lugged them back upstairs as Dean snagged the bag out of out of his mother’s hands.
He kept questioning himself, but his hands kept moving. Setting the camera settings. Attaching it to the tripod. Pointing it towards a clutter-free wall. Removing his Star Trek tee shirt and tossing it on his bed. Unfastening and dropping his jeans. Giving the button a hard press. He leaned against the wall and put his hands on his stomach.
It was Cas who broke the kiss first, gently leaning his forehead against Dean's still smiling against his mouth. "I should check on the pie." Cas said, in the most unconvincing way possible, and still very much attached to Dean.
"Yeah our break here lines up with the ones back there. His name is Balthazar. He was sort of my only friend in Pontiac so I'm very interested in seeing what you think of him."
Dean nodded and continued attacking his slowly disappearing lunch pile, the rest of them watching him in both contented and disturbed silence.
"Oh my god, Cas." Dean whined, and strode across the small bathroom in a few steps. He reached down to pull Cas up by the armpits, but Cas pulled himself out of Dean's grasp and stood up.
“Once when I was thirteen I put my fist through my upstairs hallway and I broke my hand. Didn’t know that, did you, smart ass?” Dean spit back at him, trying to control the venom in his voice.
When they walked in the door and tossed their shoes and backpacks in the entryway the smell of lasagna assailed their nostrils, and Sam took a big exaggerated inhale.
“Oh,” Mary sighed, looking down at her scrubs. “I didn’t realize I had..” She trailed off looking at the dark bloodstain across her stomach. “It’s been a long day, boys.” She said, pulling her scrub top over her head and tossing it into the hall, tugging down her long sleeved shirt in the process.
Dean tore his gaze away, removed his glasses, and pillowed his head in his arms on his desk. If he didn’t have anything to do he wasn’t going to chance Cas trying to talk to him for the next 45 minutes.
“I’m stuffed, I can’t eat another bite.” Sam said, leaning all the way back in his chair. “Good way to start winter break, thanks mom.”
"Never again." He whispered, with his voice thick and rough, and tore out of the kitchen. He nearly collided with Sam, tossing an angry
He was intimidatingly gorgeous. The ripple of his back muscles under those wings. The sharp curve of his hip under the soft white lily. The ridge of his ribs under something new and fresh and frankly, looking a lot like gibberish. He looked fucking beautiful and had Dean half hard in his jeans already, just knowing that those pictures were for him.
he asked himself as he leaned against the shower wall and gave himself a few swift strokes. He wondered what the guy would look like in real life. If all that lean muscle was just as gorgeous close up, or if he tasted as good as he looked. He wondered what his lips would feel like on him. If they would be round and plump like Cas’
The usually empty gallery was full of students projects, photos, drawings, sculptures, you name it. It was all pretty good stuff, too. There were students and parents, and a few teachers milling about and looking at projects, but Meg was nowhere to be seen. He could feel the butterflies starting to swell in his stomach as he looked around the room at all the people. Before Dean could even open his mouth Jo was rolling her eyes and turning to him.
"Back so soon?" Dean asked, trying to pull one of the decorative pillows into his lap in the most nonchalant totally-not-hiding-a-raging-hard-on type way he could manage.
“I have to go back inside. I’m not supposed to leave while my project is still up.” He let go of Dean’s waist, to search through his pants pockets. Finding the right pocket, he dropped back onto his haunches and pulled out a sharpie. He grabbed Deans’s arm and pulled the cap off with his teeth. “Text me, alright? We have a lot of catching up.” He mumbled through the marker cap, as he scrawled out his number onto Deans’s skin.
isn’t worth it to you." He stared down at Castiel, but the other boy still wouldn’t meet his eyes. "And honestly at this point I don’t have the energy to even be mad about it any more. I just
“Cas..” He half-whispered, and in response only received a groan and another mark being sucked into the skin of his hipbone. “Cas, you- you gotta stop. Man, I'm not- I can't do this. I gotta, we gotta stop. Stop.”
“Don’t worry, I learned from my last mistake. This guy is totally smokin’ and totally gonna feel right at home in our little group, I promise!”
They stood a moment, nearly chest to chest, before they were colliding, mouths hot and frantic. Dean quickly had Cas backed up against the counter, licking into to plush warmth of Cas' mouth. Kissing Cas was absolutely electric, every second of it was rough and hungry, like a flood breaking a dam and rushing out into the open forest, swallowing everything in its wake. Dean felt swallowed up in Cas, tugging his shirttails out of his stupid stuffy slacks to run his hands up the skin of his back.
“Not really, not since Zachariah and his little band of assholes discovered I could fit in my locker.”
Dean rolled his eyes, as Becky took a step back and gave Cas next to her a hard nudge with her elbow. He scrubbed a hand through his hair anxiously and took a step towards the center of the circle.
The beep of the timer jostled him out of his own head. He shuffled around looking for over mitts and pulled the two steaming pies from the oven, setting them on the rack to cool. Cherry and Apple.
Dean shoved his tray out of his way and stood up, pushing glasses back up his nose and grabbing his backpack.
He stepped into the hot spray of the shower and let it wash over him, it had been a long day and he didn't realize how comforting the steam would be until he took a deep breath.
“It’s like half done. I mean you could probably drive it home? But the tune up stuff isn’t done. I could drive you home if you want.”
"You're cute when you're angry, did I ever tell you that?" Dean whispered into their close shared space.
The last class of the day went smoothly and before Dean knew it he was walking out of the school. He knew he wouldn’t be home for a while, but that didn’t bug him. He was just glad to be out of there and have his mind off Cas. He hopped in the impala and drove to Sam’s middle school, parked in the circle drive and waited. He knew he had a good half hour before Sam was out so he pulled his phone to check his six new texts.
“I may have to head out and start working before it gets out, I’m gonna start to lose daylight soon.”
“When is it, anyway?” Dean asked. “Like I know it’s the winter opening show or whatever. But what day of my vacation am I giving up to watch you embarrass yourself?”
Dean hummed again and felt Cas press in closer to his side, turning and tightening the blanket around them more. Cas' face pressed into Dean's neck and it wasn't long before it had all turned into a big impromptu and rather sentimental hug. It was actually more like cuddling sitting down, but Dean wasn't going to say anything and risk ruining the moment.
“Yeah, it’s not, not really. Jo wanted to date some artist chick, so I was uh, I was playing wingman or whatever.” Dean said, awkwardly staring at his shuffling feet. “I uh, I saw your- your thing or whatever. It’s really good.”
“I got it mom.” Dean said, sticking his face in the bag and giving it a deep inhale. “What did you get?”
“Becky Rosen. That’s my name,” she sang with an excited gestured toward herself, “I’m also a junior. And I’m straight, but I’m totally the biggest ally you’ll ever meet. And currently I have 170 pending article edits on Wikipedia.”
“Yeah well don’t make it weird. It’s not some chick flick mom, no one is confessing their love at the dinner table all Hallmark-style. This is just car stuff and dinner.”
“Okay okay, I’m sorry, I just. That was the last time.” Cas said, quickly backing out of Dean’s space. “I’m really going now. And really, text me before the night is over. Please, Dean.”
He pondered about it through auto shop. It was his only class he could stand to slack off in. Mr Singer was an old friend of the family, and happened to be Dean’s auto shop teacher. A few summers previously Bobby had taken Dean out to his scrapyard and showed him how to gut and replace just about every machine he had out there. Dean kept taking auto shop to keep himself practiced, should anything happen to the impala. Before he knew it, the bell was ringing to let out school, and he was headed toward the gym to set up chairs and tables.
"God, you piss me off, do you know that? You fucked off out of my life once, can’t you take the hint and do it again?" Dean shouted, and slammed the receiver down into its cradle. He pulled his glasses off and scrubbed a hand over his face.
He capped the marker and stuffed it back into his pocket, leaning forward into Dean’s space. Dean’s head thunked against the window as he met Cas’ eyes. It was hard to forget he was still sprawled out in the backseat of his car, but Cas still between his legs was an enticing fucking offer no matter what the situation. Part of him hated his wounded heart for turning Cas down. The other part was glad as hell that Cas was still the same understanding and loving person he always was.
The ending bell for first period rang out, jolting Dean back to the real world. He gathered up his things and stuffed everything into his bag quickly. He hadn’t meant to zone out through the whole class period, but he wasn’t terribly worried about his grade. He was the only one in the class to do any of the extra credit essays, and Mr Fitzgerald always posted his lesson plans on his website.
Dean was easy. He knew he was easy. There was no point in his life that he had found such a warm, willing, and
Eventually he did find the photo he was looking for. It was a black and white picture of a man’s back, all thin lithe muscle and perfect angles, with a gorgeous pair of angel wings tattooed sprouting from his shoulder blades. The face was out of view, but you could see a perky ass and the tops of his thighs. The guy was gorgeous all over and Dean did not hesitate a second finding the source blog.
"This is so stupid." Dean scoffed into the phone. "So, what, you’re just gonna sit here and listen to me yell at you?"
“Okay, this is how the game works. Everyone in a big circle. You say your name, your grade or age or whatever, your orientation, and something nobody else in the circle knows. And we just go around until we’ve all gone. Jo will go first.” He added, shoving Jo playfully on the shoulder.
“They’re all having a big Christmas Eve lunch. So, we’re going to miss that, but we’ll go over on Christmas and pick up the presents from the family.” Mary said, picking up the empty containers and paper plates and dumping them into the trash can. “Alright, you boys are free to do whatever it is you do on vacation. I’m going to have a nap. If you need anything, get it yourself and don’t tell me.” She smiled at them and left the room.
“Heeey. I’m Charlie. Totally a junior. Totally operating at maximum lesbian capacity. And once when I was a kid I hacked into NORAD.” There were a few chuckles and scoffs as Charlie made a flourished bow and stepped back.
, sending water cascading out onto the floor and Cas' already wet socks and bathmat. Cas just wrinkled his eyebrows, trying to pull his arms out of Dean's grasp, which Dean was having
of. He tightened his wet grip as much as possible and tugged Cas hard as he could, sending him into the bathtub with him. He landed with a soft thud on Dean, still grumpy expression, and Dean was quick to wrap an arm around his waist.
Cas sputtered and splashed back, trying to dunk Dean's head under the water, and failing miserably. Dean rolled quick and dumped Cas into the tub next to him, sloshing more water onto the floor. He rolled over onto Cas, laughing at his grumpy wet cat expression.
"I don't suck at Caravan, Joanna Beth, you just don't know the rules. I'm on a whole other level from you."
Dean stood in the doorway to the kitchen, watching Mary with her hands in a sink full of soapy water. She pulled the plug in the bottom of the basin and threw a smile over her shoulder.
If anyone was going to call him on his shit, it would be Ash. He sighed and chucked his phone in the cup holder, just in time for Sammy to climb in the car.
He pulled into the school parking lot, parking in his usual spot and thunking his head against the steering wheel.
“You know like, a video game. I have Halo, Mario Kart, Mario Party, other non-Mario related games. Do you have a preference?”
Dean sighed and replaced his glasses on his face. "I just really don’t want us to change our long distance provider. That’s all."
Dean rolled his eyes and turned on his seat to where they were all looking. “No he’s not, he’s drawing or whatever. Like he always is. Just drop it, Jesus.” He said, taking another bite and turning around.
He could see the cockiness in Cas’ eyes harden over and turn cold, but he refused to break eye contact. When Cas finally shifted his gaze to the floor the group was busy with mindless chatter about the holidays. He knew he should reign in the group and get them on topic, but he just couldn’t find it in himself to care.
They both took a step back from each other, still smiling. Cas wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and took a step back towards the oven, ready to check on his pie. Dean leaned back against the counter, and shook his still wet hand over the sink, sending soap bubbles cascading across the counter. Sam took a step into the kitchen and threw a confused look at the both of them.
"Dean, you better not have eaten everything in the kitchen, or Cas is gonna be pissed!" Sam called out from the entryway, toeing off his boots.
Spending time with Cas at home like this was easier than he thought it would be. Yeah, he made him nervous and looking at him hurt a little sometimes, but the way he fit seamlessly next to him like not a moment had passed was all he had wanted as a kid. Well, almost all.
“I saw Michael Novak at the market today.” Mary said to no one in specific, “He said they moved back into town. Apparently Jimmy’s boss transferred him back to the Kansas branch.”
Cas looked down at his bare arms. He had barely even managed to shove his boots on on the way out the door, it was clear he hadn't considered the wintry weather blowing around outside. Dean rolled his eyes and leaned back over the bench seat to the floor of the backseat where he kept a pillow and oversized blanket. He grabbed the blanket and tossed it over the back of the seat at Cas.
He slinked quietly down the hallway to the main bathroom and locked the door behind him. The water warmed up fast and he gave himself a precursory tug in the cold air as he stripped off his clothes and dropped them in the bin.
"Yeah," Dean scoffed, "there’s a lot that’s unsaid. I waited for you, Cas. I waited years for you to call, or write, or do something, fucking
He didn’t stop or turn around. He walked right out of the gym to Coach Mills office, to tell her the meeting was over. Dean didn’t want to see Cas’ face, but he was hoping it at least stung a little bit. He was hallway to his car when he felt his phone vibrate.
“My name is Jo Harvelle, and I am a sophomore. I am bisexual, and when I was twelve I broke my arm almost clear in half.”
"Dean, I have seen you naked. I don't understand why its necessary for me to leave the room so you can vacate your bladder."
stashed it in his closet. He pulled it out from the back and set it in the middle of the room, pulling it into open position as he dropped it. He grabbed his digital camera out of the desk drawer and started clicking through the features.
He could feel the blush creeping up his cheeks and he ducked his head back down and tried to start working on the morning journal exercise. When he heard Mr Fitzgerald plunk a textbook down and Cas shuffle into the desk he chanced another look in his direction.
It was kinda cute the way got all worked up over it, and blushed when Dean complimented him was even cuter. He was still mid conversation with Alfie when something caught Jo’s eye and she dragged him across the gallery. He threw an apologetic glance and shrug over his shoulder at the kid and got ready to chew Jo out. When he saw what she was dragging him to he stopped and
“I don’t want anything, silly!” She annunciated by playfully smacking his arm, “I just wanted to let you know I got a new recruit for the GSA meeting today!”
Dean leaned against the cool shower wall and gave himself a few long firm strokes. He thought again about Clarence's photos, the lean muscle, the glint of a pierced nipple. Clarence had posted those gifs a while back and he still hadn't forgotten. The way his body trembled with release. The way his fingers deftly skated across the skin of his ribs. Almost a familiarity to them. The shape of them, so familiar he could almost imagine what they would feel like if they were pressed against his chest, sliding down his stomach, unzipping his jeans, cradling his face gently, just brushing softly against his cheekbone-
my fault. The truth is I didn't know what I would have done if I had to hear you tell me what I did. I hoped so hard that you had moved somewhere else and found someone who made you happy, and that if I had managed to actually find and dial your old number I'd get that stupid 'number disconnected' message instead of all this guilt. That it wasn't that bad because the number I wasn't dialing didn't lead anywhere. Because I knew that if I heard you on the other end it would take everything not to fight to come back.”
“Jesus, Cas, are these all yours?” Dean asked, kicking at the plethora of cigarette butts at their feet.
“I didn't call after. I know. I didn't even know how to begin to apologize. Man, I promised you everything and then I left you high and dry. It was really shitty. Possibly the shittiest thing I've ever done.”
He didn’t look back at Jo, but he knew the face she would make at him if he did, and he didn’t want to see it. Instead, he headed toward the back of the gallery, where there were big red lights pointed at something dark and weird and strangely visceral looking. It had to be Meg’s, there was nothing else that has this much focus on it, and her name was clearly on the art show fliers as the ‘artist on display’.
Every picture Dean had taken Clarence had take one of himself in an identical pose. And it was gorgeous. He was all inked planes of lithe muscle and seeing his body next to Dean’s was kind of daunting.
Dean tapped his pencil against the edge of his desk, and sighed loudly at the ceiling. He was bored. English class was boring.
but in all honesty if he was going to get into anything involving penetration he would be a little lost. He had seen enough porn to not make a fool of himself, but had enough understanding to know that anything he was going to do was in no way going to happen like that. He didn't even know if he was a top or a bottom.
“This is kind of gross. And terrifying.” He said as he approached what appeared to be some sort of latex skin and metal hook monstrosity. “And it’s clearly made of actual people. Jo, hate to break it to ya, pretty sure your little girlfriend is killing people for art.”
They both grasped tight at each other and somehow Cas managed to find Dean’s mouth with his own and it was like
“I’m not gonna be able to ask about Doctor Who without getting a long winded list of plot holes am I?”
Cas chuckled and bumped his forehead into Dean's, nudging at his nose and letting their heavy breathing fill up the space around them.
Dean stared in confusion as Castiel crossed the parking lot, headed back towards the school. "So that’s it," he called out after him, "you’re just gonna drop this whole fuckin' deal, and never talk to me again?"
Dean was ready to shrug it off and go grab another beer from the fridge when he felt Cas' hands on his shoulders, pushing him back against the arm of couch. He wasted no time slotting himself between Dean's legs and licking into his surprised mouth, hard and hungry. The shock of it took about half a second to wear off before Dean was kissing back with fervor and knotting his hands in Cas' thick dark hair. Cas stifled an excited moan against his mouth, and ground down his hips, earning himself a moan he quickly swallowed from Dean's mouth.
and clicking send. Anonymity on the internet was one of his favorite things. He knew he'd never be able to say that shit to someone in real life. But to someone he would never meet, that didn't matter. The worst thing that could happen is that the guy deletes his message, right?
Dinner was eaten in contented silence, the three of them chewing and occasionally laughing and Dean’s yummy noises. Mary finished before the boys could and went digging through the fridge, resurfacing with a bottle of white wine.
Dean had a guess ready, considering they were most of the way through the semester and Cas had just moved here. Still, Sam didn’t need to be texting during class. He popped an ACDC tape into the deck and shot back a couple of replies.
sleeping with other people?" Dean asked, in what he hoped was not hurt and vaguely accusatory voice.
“Yeah yeah, she’s inside. You don’t have to stay all night. Just long enough to make sure I’m not reading the wrong signals. If I strike out we can go watch Star Trek or something, I dunno.” Jo said as she finally climbed out of the car.
He clicked send and leaned back in his chair again. He was a little nervous, but more excited than anything to see what Clarence had planned.
“Really, Dean. I’m fine with your mother. It gives me more time to digest and enjoy a slice of pie.”
Cas rolled his eyes, but still got up and followed Michael out into the hall. He heard a quiet murmur from beyond the door, mostly it was Michael's stern angry voice and Cas hissing out responses. He couldn't understand anything they were saying, but he could pretty much imagine it was entirely Michael getting pissed about his being there, and Cas not giving a crap.
“And what, mom? I haven’t talked to him. He’s different now and I don’t wanna hear any of the excuses he’s gonna make. It’s not gonna make it up to me.”
Cas took his real first steps into the Winchester residence and looked around. Dean gestured towards the living room and Cas followed expectantly.
Dean joined Jo up at the head of the gathering and cleared his throat, effectively silencing the chatter and gathering attention. He adjusted his thick frames and looked out into the group.
Tomorrow was the first day of thanksgiving vacation and he planned to sleep all the way in. Maybe play some Mass Effect. Maybe go down to the comic shop. Most everything was going to be closed Thursday and he didn’t plan on going fuckin anywhere on Black Friday. Those soccer moms could get crazy and he didn’t really want to get trampled to death or tazed. Maybe if it wasn’t too cold he’d give the impala a tune up. Or take Sammy to a movie. Then again they might be visiting his Grandparents again for the holidays, and grandpa Samuel could talk forever.
Dean tried to keep his eyes on the page, like maybe if he didn't look at Michael he could will his presence away, or the book might suck him up inside. He wondered absently if that was Cas' goal all along.
"I'm glad." Dean hummed in response, leaning up next to him, feeling the long line of heat to his side in the cool night air. The sun had been out and clear early, so he had only worn a t-shirt, but now that the sun was down he was regretting leaving his flannel inside. Castiel seemed to sense his chill, and leaned closer to him.
It was, well it was beautiful, but it was definitely Dean. It was part painting, part chalk, part- hell Dean had no idea. It was all green eyes and white stretching smile and sun-kissed freckles. The butterflies in his stomach turned into excited bees, warm and buzzing in his insides. Dean was stunned into shocked silence, but Jo was gawking and shoving her face up close to it, fingers moving across the plexiglass, tracing the freckles on the bridge of the piece’s nose. She grabbed Dean by the collar of his coat, yanking his face forward and shoving his glasses up onto his forehead.
His first class of the day was English 11 and he was intensely bored with it. They were discussing The Great Gatsby in class and if he had to hear one more comment about how romantic Gatsby’s love of Daisy was he was going to up-chuck. It was like reading Romeo & Juliet freshman year all over again. He took his same seat towards the back of class and popped in his headphones, listening to Metallica and waiting for the bell. He still had a good ten minutes so he took out his phone and opened up his tumblr app and started scrolling through the posts he missed while sleeping. Not a whole lot of new stuff. Some more screenshots from the new Hobbit trailer, more Hiddleston fan girls, apparently they had announced a date for Sherlock, a few firefly gifs, some surprisingly graphic gay porn, Doctor Who meta regarding the 50th special. It was all the same shit he always saw. It was like his dash was on a big loop. He put his phone away, telling himself he’d find some new blogs to follow when he got home, as long as he wasn’t swimming in homework. He pushed his glasses up on his nose and tucked his face into his arms to wait for class to start.
Throughout his entire highschool career Dean Winchester told himself that the next year would definitely be, at the very least, more bearable. He was nearing the halfway mark on his junior year and still completely certain this year was going to be just like the others, miserable and overly long.
“He's not really around. He only really uses the house as a place to sleep, and even then he doesn't come home every night. It started when we moved to Pontiac. He stared working later and later for more and more overtime to pay for mom's medical bills. When she died it really messed him up, but he kept going into work. Kept staying late, and throwing himself at his job. Michael just got worse and worse. I mean, he got nasty. As soon as I was old enough to get the hell away when I could, I did.”
He looked around the room again, and poor little Alfie was standing all by himself just twiddling his thumbs and staring at his feet. The kid was seriously adorable, Dean had definitely contemplated asking him out to a movie or something once or twice, but every time doubt won over and he chickened out. The other boy caught his gaze and smiled at him, that big sweet smile he always gave. He turned back to get Jo’s attention, but she was in the middle of a very close and quiet conversation, Meg’s fingers tangled in her belt loops, both of them oblivious to the world. He turned to leave and tapped out a quick “txt if you need me” text to Jo as he walked.
“I know that now. It took a couple years, and Balthazar's help, but I did come to terms with who I am. Realized Michael was full of shit. I mean, he's still scary, but it's a lot easier when you don't believe the fire and brimstone.”
“My name Samandriel. You can call me Alfie if that’s too much of a mouthful. I’m a freshman. And I work part time at the Wiener Hut.”
Cas tasted like mint and cigarettes and Dean could feel it in the bottom of his stomach, like the butterflies in his gut were rusting out and combusting, popping apart and painting the inside of his ribcage with a brilliant stinging emptiness he wanted Cas to fill. It had never giving the inkling of even starting as a chaste kiss, but it wasn’t long until Cas’ hands found themselves into Dean’s hair and angled his head
“Everybody cancel your weekend plans.” Dean said, letting his lunch tray clatter onto the table, the force knocking a package of twinkies off of his tray.
"I guess? I mean I don’t want to hear his excuses, but I’d kinda like some answers, y’know?" He placed the dish in the cabinet and turned to face his mother. "What d’you think?"
into Dean's mouth and quickly kissed back, wrapping his wet hands around the small of Dean's back and allowing himself to be pressed up against the counter. The heat was gone from the air almost instantaneously, leaving them pressed together and trading lazy kisses, just smiling into each others mouths. Cas reached down and shoved his hands into Dean's back pockets, giving him a squeeze and a chuckle, and earning whatever the manly version of a giggle is in return. Because Dean Winchester definitely does not giggle. And if he did, it would be because of a
Dean had convinced Sam and his friends to move the tables back into the garage, Kevin and Andy had both showed up, along with Ava and Anna that was certainly enough middle schoolers to clean up faster than he was going to get done on his own. He stood on the deck watching them all work while Ellen packed up her crockpot.
"Yeah, he didn't want to wait for me to get to his office, so he's not closing the assignment officially until I can get in tomorrow." Sam replied suspiciously, eying them both. "Why are you on the floor?"
Before he knew it he was digging through his closet. Last year the yearbook had needed a group picture of the school’s Gay-Straight-Alliance for the yearbook and everyone voted to take it in Dean’s backyard. And Jo had left her tripod in his room afterwards, where he had
He yanked his bag up off the floor and rushed out of the classroom, eyes down, knocking full force into a warm body. He adjusted his glasses and looked up, meeting a familiar pair of dark rimmed blue eyes. Castiel was opening his mouth to speak, but Dean flat-out didn’t care.
Cas was right. The dirt road from the turn off ended at a small dirt parking lot, perched at the edge of a small lake Dean wasn't even sure had existed. The other side of the lake had a big play area and a trail, but because of foliage it was entirely unreachable. This small alcove only housed a picnic table with a short section of roof over it and a small dock, most likely for fishing off of.
“He’s fine, he can stay in here and catch up with me.” Mary said, finally pouring herself a glass of wine. Dean flashed Cas a silent are you sure? Look.
“My mom died.” He said as if testing the air around him. He seemed to wait for Dean's surprise before he continued. “Like six months after we moved. I guess that was why we moved or whatever. She had late stage pancreatic cancer, and there was this doctor in Illinois who was trying this new thing that could have saved her or whatever. It didn’t save her, obviously. I mean we didn't really see eye to eye on like anything before we moved, but she was my mom, man. And Michael-” he stopped to pull his leather jacket tighter around his chest with a bitter laugh. “From the second we left Michael was telling me I was damning them. That
"I think that boy used to love you quite a lot. And he must have his reasons for what he did. But you’re not obligated to listen. I think he knows that too." Mary said, pulling him into a hug. "Maybe you’ll eventually get your answers, maybe you won’t. But I’m glad you let him know how you felt."
“Earth to Dean!” Jo shouted and snapped her fingers in front of his face. “What the fuck are you drooling at?”
Cas couldn't help the quiet laughter that bloomed in his chest. Neither could Dean. They're both laughing and rolling off the couch together before Sam could figure out how to respond, or get away.
He felt Cas' hand behind him, grasping at the impala for god knows what. Cas found what he was looking for behind Dean, which was clearly the door latch
Dean helped his mom clean the rest of the kitchen up and locked up the house. He headed upstairs to his computer, logged into skype and popped tumblr back open. He wasn't sure what he was looking for, but he was still too wired to sleep. He hadn't really been terribly active on tumblr since he'd exchanged skypes with Clarence, no reason to sit and refresh his blog looking for acknowledgement, he'd always message if Dean was online. He was mostly running on a queue he'd refresh occasionally, but today tumblr just wasn't scratching the itch it usually did.
“You’re going to laugh at me but my father never bought us gaming consoles after we moved, so the only time I played video games growing up was over here. I’m afraid I’m not going to a terribly formidable opponent.”
Dean scrubbed a hand over his face. Clarence was exactly how he figured he would be. He had even convinced Dean to take more pictures.
"Dean, stop teasing." Cas tried to growl, but as out of breath and broken as he sounded he completely missed the 'scary' tone he usually imbued and shot straight at 'completely wrecked'.
The rest of dinner passed by quietly, if not completely awkwardly. When he was done eating Dean put his plate in the sink and headed back up to his room. This whole Castiel situation was stressing him out and giving him a headache.
"Oh perfect." Mary smiled at them "Castiel, if you'd like you can stay over again tonight, I know it's getting late."
“Yeah I know you do. I won’t be forgetting that any time soon, either.” Dean replied, unwrapping a sandwich and taking a bite.
“Me and Kevin and Andy are gonna build an igloo when it snows, but we have to wait.” Sammy said to the ceiling.
"No, I'm washing sweaters. I have to be here to assure that the water temperature does not shift, and that they get the correct ratio of detergent to water."
Dean was like putty in Cas' hands, and he knew it. Every move Cas made was eagerly received and mimicked in turn. Once he felt the weight of Cas against him, it all came crashing down around them, and the inevitable roll of Cas' hips had him stuttering and groaning out against the other boy. Every one of Cas' movements had him gripping harder against him, putting more insistence into each kiss, feeling his heart hammering harder against his ribcage. It was too much, but he couldn't stop it. Couldn't stop the feeling of Cas' hands against him, or the way his skin tasted, the way he completely yielded to Dean's touch.
"Yeah." Castiel replied before taking another drag, ember burning orange and putting off smoke in the cold winter weather.
Castiel smiled back and turned to Dean. He was going to pretend it didnt make something inside of him flutter.
Cas brought his hand up to Deans’s face, thumb brushing softly against his cheekbone, and leaned in. Dean didn’t try to fight it for a second as Cas placed one more chaste kiss against his lips. He could feel his resolve begin to wain as Cas pulled away. If he really wanted, he could just pull him right back and keep getting ravished. Honestly, he really did want to keep going.
"No phones on movie night Sammy, you know the rules." Dean griped. If he couldn't play flappy bird during the stupid friggen bee movie, Sam wasn't allowed to take social calls.
When class finally ended Dean waiting for most of the class, including Cas, to clear out before he left the classroom and headed at full speed to the art wing for Auto Shop. It was going to be a long day.
Dean came hard. To something in his mind that felt almost like a memory, but still too far away to make a clear picture. He panted softly and laid his head back against the cool tile, hot water streaming over his stomach rinsing off the mess he'd made.
They sat down and started dishing out food. Their usual was beef & broccoli, general tso’s chicken, and and huge fried rice from the Chinese place down on the corner. It had opened up the previous summer and they already were very familiar with the Winchesters. Mary had told Dean once that she wished she could be home for the boys more, cooking them real food. He knew she would be if she could, but she worked a lot, and both boys understood. Mary loved her job. She loved helping people and she loved all the people she got to meet. Sometimes she’d come home upset, like if she lost a patient she had been particularly close with, but those were the days Dean tried his hardest to keep her happy.
He pulled off his glasses, massaged the bridge of his nose, and put them back on his face. There was still another hour before he was going to even entertain the idea of going to sleep, so he tucked in and got on tumblr on his phone again. The gorgeous photographer boy he had started following posted a new picture of what appeared to be a bedroom. The bed was larger than even two people would need and a small dark fluffy cat was sleeping in the middle of it. The only caption said
They settled on the heavy seat of the picnic table, wrapped in a blanket and leaning heavily against the aging rain-warped tabletop.
“Huh-uh Joanna Beth, that’s cheating. I’ve seen that nasty scar. It’s supposed to be something nobody here knows.” Dean chided her.
The food was good, it always was. The company was enjoyable and the night was cool. One by one people had started to trickle out, stopping to thank Mary and fill up a tupperware they brought.
Dean’s head shot up from his desk to look. He was just standing there in the doorway picking a string off the overly-long sleeve of his striped hoodie and looking almost unrecognizable. The left quarter of his head was shaved and his eyes were ringed with black eyeliner. He had a silver bar in his eyebrow and a ring in his nose like a bull. He was chewing at the stud on the right side of his lip while he picked at his nails waiting for Mr Fitzgerald to find the extra textbook in his messy desk. His straight legged jeans looked fitted in all the right ways and had what looked like thorny vines hand drawn around one of the thighs. He was not the kid Dean remembered but he was fucking
“Chinese. The usual. Go ahead and take it to the table, will you sweetheart?” Mary said, toeing off her shoes in the entryway and hanging up her coat.
Dean quickly turned into the kitchen to find Cas plunking sticky utensils into the soapy sink and rinsing a rather large bowl. He looked around the rest of the apartment rather quickly. No TV on in any other rooms. No evidence anyone else had even been here all day.
Dean was secure in his sexuality. He always knew he wasn’t straight. He was interested in guys. He was interested in girls. Hell, he even had a thing for androgyny. He never made a big deal of coming out to his family. He dated his first boy in 8th grade, his name was Aaron, and when Mary caught them holding hands under the dinner table she kissed Dean on the top of the head and told Aaron he was welcome back anytime he wanted.
“I have Christmas off this year. Not Christmas Eve though, so we’ll have our big dinner on Christmas.” Mary replied.
“I'm totally awake. I'm like the most awake person ever.” He replied groggily without opening his eyes.
Dean quit spinning and pulled himself back up to the computer desk and wiggled the mouse to wake the screen up again. Clarence’s blog was still up on the screen, unchanged. He clicked over to Skype, still greeted with the same grey offline icon as before.
He clicked over to google chrome and opened his mystery photographer’s tumblr. Opening his submit box, choosing the photo, and figuring out how to make himself
“Good,” Dean yelled back, following her up the circle drive to the schools gallery entrance. “Because you still haven’t seen Voyager. Janeway friggin' rules and you’ll love it.”
Dean was a virgin but he wasn't completely without experience. He had participated in his fair share of clothes on dry humping and half-assed in-the-pants hand jobs. He knew what it felt like to have someone else's hands on him and he yearned for it. He adjusted himself in his jeans and winced at the constricting fabric.
"Told him I waited for him." He said, finally drying the dish in his hands. "That I don’t care any more and I just wanna be left alone."
His morning routine went quicker than normal. Wake Sammy. Brush teeth. Wake Sammy again. Find clothes. Grab breakfast. Into the car. Drop Sammy at school. Head to his own school. He was halfway there when he remembered the previous day had even existed. That’s right. Cas was back.
and both boys tumbled into the backseat of the impala. Dean quickly scrambled back against the far door, Cas following closely. They were barely apart a few seconds before Cas had reaffixed himself to Dean like he needed him to breathe, sucking bruises into his skin, and
Dean smiled and carded his fingers through Cas’ messy dark hair. He felt Cas’ arms tighten around him as he sighed into Dean’s tummy.
“I never stopped wanting you, Dean Winchester. Not even for a minute.” He mumbled into Dean’s neck, and it was like suffocating.
between them, and he stifled a chuckle into the soft bit of skin he was sucking a mark into under Cas' jaw. Cas tightened his fingers in Dean's waistband, earning him an interested
Dean rushed down the hallway and ducked into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him, only to find Castiel on his knees over the bathtub, swirling his hand around in it.
to let me know I mattered to you. I even tried to find you, and I got jack shit. So I get it, Castiel. Loud and clear. The thing I don’t get is why you’re trying to waste your time and energy on someone who
“Oh.” Cas sighed. “That’s kind of embarrassing. Can I talk to you, like outside or something? I mean, you can say no, but I’d really like to talk to you now.”
he was right there asking if I was thinking impure thoughts. If I was trying to kill our mother. Who the fuck says that to a kid? By the time she died I had heard it so much I thought it was really fucking my fault. I even tried to pray for forgiveness, but Michael just got worse from there. It was,” he paused to wipe his eyes and lean further into Dean’s touch, arching like a cat into him when Dean finally just wrapped the arm around his shoulders. “It got bad, man. Michael is scary as shit. I mean, he’s my own fuckin' brother and I’m scared shitless of him half the time. I’m not even surprised you hate me, either. I mean shit, I hated me for the whole situation. I mean yeah it’s been years, but what you must’ve thought of me in the beginning. Man, I deserve it.”
[southern_comfort] which he knew would be a sore spot after his however many years of not doing that exact thing
Dean slung his backpack over his shoulder and turned to see Cas standing a little too close for comfort.
His voice was deep. Deeper than he would have imagined it getting at twelve. Dean gave him a once-over and counted the glints of metal. He could only spot six piercings, which left the last two to his imagination. He tried not to think about it too hard. Cas had already stepped back in line with the circle. Dean had already mostly stopped caring. He already knew everyone in the circle. There wasn’t anything anyone was going to say to surprise him. He picked at the grease under his nails and waited for his turn.
"Maybe I wanna talk to you, you ever think of that? Why can't you just talk to me, Cas?" Dean practically yelled in his face.
"Can you guess why I'm upset about this mess, Dean?" Cas asked through gritted teeth, trying not to jump across the kitchen and strangle his roommate's brother.
He made his way to the library and hid himself in his favorite plush chair in the back. He was sure Ash was filling his friends in on the rest of the story.
Now Cas was in his English class. His sister and brothers were no doubt back in town too. He gave a brief thought as where in their small town his parents might have moved to. It didn’t really matter, he supposed. Cas clearly hadn’t given Dean a second thought since they were eleven, and Dean didn’t need to give him a second thought now.
Jo and Charlie laughed and turned back to their own food, picking through whatever disturbing lunch meal they had picked out. If you actually stopped to taste the cafeteria food it was all really sort of bland and grey and unappealing. Jo sighed and gave up after a few soggy tasteless fries, pushing her tray away and looking around the room.
He checked to make sure he was definitely anonymous and that his face was cut out of all of the pictures, before one by one beginning the upload. He wrinkled his nose at the quick compression he knew was happening to the hi-res images he had taken. He had only taken five, in varying angles, degrees of undress, and stretched posing. Clarence had said he wanted to "play with them" whatever that meant, so Dean figured weird artistic posing would be right up his alley. He labeled them all out of five and on the last one his hands hovered over the keyboard, brain whizzing to think up a witty caption.
This chapter was written in when the fic was written in 2014 but revised in 2020 when it was updated, so if you read it before its different now.
Dean nodded dumbly and followed Cas out of the gallery and down to the circle drive. Somehow Cas had spotted the impala in the dark and bee-lined across the circle drive to it. They both leaned against the car, an awkward silence hanging between them. The bees in his stomach turned back into butterflies, dancing in his stomach, wings fluttering out against the lining in wide motions. Cas took a shaky breath and blew out a big steamy huff of air, scrubbing his hands over his face.
"Fuck." Dean dropped his forehead and sighed into Cas' stomach. "I thought you said he was in class?" He asked, words muffled on Cas' body.
He didn't bother redressing before he uploaded the photos to his computer. The first was too blurry around the hands. The second was a little too boring, not enough twist in the wrist or grip of the fingers. Left too much to the imagination. The third picture was perfect, enough firm grip to look alive, didn't look graphic, but still got the point across. He opened it in photoshop, cropped out his head and played with the colors until he realized he was stalling. By his own standards it might even have been something he’d be interested in.
Dean had practically sprinted to his study hall, so he wasn't particularly surprised at being the first person into the classroom. He ducked into the back corner seat, closest to the door, and pulled out his phone. The few seconds it took to load the tumblr felt agonizingly long, and waiting for his blog felt even longer.
Dean leaned back more comfortably against the side of the couch, having more room now that there wasn't a Sasquatch squished into the middle of them. He had a comfortable buzz going, and could easily get tipsy if he kept going, but being the only one in the room who was drunk wasn't his idea of a fun time. Maybe Cas would drink with him until Sam came back. He looked over at Cas, sitting stock-straight and picking at his nails. Cas always managed to have a serious tone to his look, even if all he was doing was sitting on the couch. Maybe it was button-down and perpetual bedhead he always wore, making him look overworked and frazzled, and maybe it was the squinty glare he always had focused on Dean. Either way it was hot as hell and incredibly distracting. It was also probably the reason he meant to offer a beer to the guy, but when Cas' gaze finally met his all he could manage was
When lunch rolled around it turned out Cas had the same lunch period as him as well. He was trying not to be a creep, but he ended up sitting there watching Cas sitting alone and scrolling through something on his phone while picking disinterestedly at a basket of fries.
Dean headed out the driveway and looked at Cas’s car in the driveway. The sky wasn’t dark yet but he still had limited time to work.
He watched Cas snuggle into his pillows and stretch out, and he felt a pang in his stomach. Having Cas back in his life was great, but seeing him in his bed was something else all together. This was something that made his knees turn to jelly just to see.
"I don’t wanna listen either. I have a lot of shit to say to you before I even begin to listen to whatever you’re gonna say to me."
Dean took a look around once he actually took a step inside and yeah, it was definitely ridiculous inside. Everything looked expensive, yet
"Coming!" He replied, closing out of skype and putting his computer to sleep. If people ended up here later they didn't need to see any lurid messages from any tattooed admirers. He bounced down the stairs to the kitchen where Mary was shuffling stuff around, still fussing over stray crumbs and paper napkins. The whole room was filled with an incredible baked scent he could always identify.
By the time he came downstairs Sam and Mary were digging into the lasagna. Dean sat down at the place Mary had set for him and scooped himself up a fat piece. They ate in silence until Mary finished her first piece.
Cas was in the front center seat on the classroom, slouched against the bent side bar of the crappy desk, and chewing on a pen cap and doing what looked more like drawing than writing to Dean.
Everyone stopped and turned to Dean, who was still not paying attention. Jo elbowed him in the ribs and gave a jerking nod towards the center. Dean rolled his eyes and took a big step in.
"Thank you guys, seriously." Sam replied jumping up from the couch to grab his backpack, frantically running around the apartment.. "Yeah I'm still here, I'm leaving now.." He practically yelled into the phone, nearly dropping it, as he hopped into his untied shoes on the way out the door.
He made it through the first half of his day without issue; gym was always easy, and US History had him bored out of his mind and done hearing the mindless chatter of other students making plans over the break. It wasn't until lunch break that he remembered the anonymous message he sent to to mystery photographer. He was almost giddy to know what he had said back, or if he had even seen the ask yet. He wanted to check right then, but he knew if he pulled his phone out Jo would badger him to know what he was doing. Dean almost never bothered to check his phone during school hours, it usually only served to captivate an hour of his time when he so much as glanced at it, and that tended to be bad for his grades. He’d have to wait until 8th block study hall. He didn't know anyone in his class, and he didn't have any homework yet. For now he’d have to calm his heartbeat and eat his lunch.
"Didn't you play sports in high school? How does one deal with the locker room and still have a bashful bladder?" Cas mused, mostly to himself, and swirled his hand around in the tub again.
[thrsdy_bby] I am a little abashed to admit that I’ve had quite a hard time getting you out of my head since the first message you sent
"Dean's birthday is approaching. Is this not more suitable than any cake we could buy?" He replied, still peering in the oven.
He looked up from his phone and realized the classroom was full, study hall had apparently started 45 minutes ago.
The entire contents of silverware drawer has scattered on the floor, along with a concerning amount of.. what are those, cornflakes? Cas sighed into his hands and turned back towards the kitchen door.
“What’s wrong, don’t wanna support your fellow classmates?” Jo teased at him while she tapped away at her phone.
He couldn’t put a finger on what it was about Clarence that was so enticing. Might have been the mystery, might have been the ink, might have even been his attitude. Either way he definitely already had Dean wrapped around his finger, and they both knew it. So Dean got off the computer and went in search of the tripod again.
“I'm not sure what you have planned here, Cas, but it's still like 35 degrees out. And we left all our crap on your floor.”
“We could always go to the lake house, too.” Cas replied, leaning back against Dean, and placing his head gently on the taller boy's shoulder. If he lifted his legs he'd essentially be in Dean's lap, and Dean tried not to think about how that made him feel.
He pushed them both out the front door, trying to not mind to bitter cold, and trudged on down to the impala. Castiel's rings clinked against his own, but his hands were warm and he kind of wished he wouldn't let go. When he did finally let go he rounded the front of the car and ducked into the passenger side door. Dean had barely shut the drivers side door before Cas had one hand wrapped around his bicep, squinting angrily at his brother standing at the front door.
quick as he could, shut his laptop, and headed off to take a quick shower. He still had grease under his nails from auto shop.
Cas wrinkled his nose and stared down Dean with that same glare he always gave, but didn't move from his spot on the couch.
a thing I just saw? Knowing its happening is one thing, but there is not enough brain-bleach in the world to deal with you, Dean. Can I just keep telling myself you guys probably don't do it on the couch, and you guys can just go back to sneaking around and being relatively quiet and
“Cas, you made it!” Dean joked as he finally entered the room. Cas smiled back at him and wiggled out of his mother’s grasp.
"Nah, mom got the idea for it after Cas left. Wanted me to be social or whatever. Not a huge deal. Anyways Cas, this weekend at my place, potluck style cookout. Bring a dish, something cool and fun. Obviously mom would kick my ass if I didn't tell you that Anna is also invited. Not Michael though, he sucks."
“Jesus, even the freckles are in the right place.” She huffed at him, continually moving her eyes from his face to the painting. “I mean, you’ve got more than that, but every one in the picture is right here. It’s like, perfect, Dean. It’s eerie.”
Has it been literally 6 years since last update? Yes. Is that an insane amount of time to wait to finish this? Also yes. Anyways Happy Canon Destiel Week I'm posting the rest of this fic this week, this absolutely wild canon confession of love has given me the boost I needed to just finish writing the last few chapters.
He could feel Cas' hands on his bare chest, hot, heavy, and insisting. It was way too much. His heart was in his throat banging against his windpipe and he was struggling to breathe it all in. He could feel Cas' hands roaming up, rucking his shirt under his armpits to get more skin to kiss quickly blooming bruises onto. He raked his blunt nails through Cas' hair, mouth sputtering as he tried to come up with the words on the tip of his tongue, the words Cas' tongue was very nearly erasing from his mind. Cas' wet kisses trailed lower and lower, and when they finally met the jeans he was working to unfasten Dean's mind kicked into gear.
Things went back to normal pretty quickly. Dean watched his mess a little better, and Sam agreed to calm down and enjoy his time more, after both the boys cornered him and threatened to move his mattress out to the deck while he was sleeping. They had even all agreed to having movie night once a week, alternating who got to pick the movie. This week is was Sam's turn to pick, and he had come home with a pile of documentaries from the library, of course. Dean rolled his eyes while Cas and Sam picked out one about bees or something equally boring that made Dean reach for another beer and completely zone out.
"This has been nice." Castiel mused, leaning against the side of the truck. "I'm not certain what I was expecting. I'm not a big social function person. But this has been very nice. I'm sure Anna has been having a wonderful time as well."
Cas dragged himself through the door, and into the dimly lit apartment. He quickly ducked into the kitchen and went shuffling through the fridge. He was starving. Some days he had time between classes to grab lunch, and some days he had to wait until afterward. If he was lucky, on those days the cafeteria would still be open. This was not one of those lucky days. Cas stared into a carton of old Chinese take-out and attempted to cross the kitchen, first running directly into an open drawer, throwing it off the hinges and scattering cutlery across the floor. Cas grumbled and set the Chinese carton down, carefully back pacing to get to the lights he had neglected to hit on his way in.
There was always a good half hour after school was actually out before anyone bothered to show up. It was fine, it gave Dean and Jo a chance to set up and talk about what they wanted to get accomplished in the meeting.
"Can we please just not, okay?" Dean asked quietly. "I don’t wanna hear his excuses or any of his dumb crap. I’m not over it. I don’t know when I’ll ever be over it."
“If anybody’s starin’ it’s cause he’s eating like a damn black hole.” Ash responded and starting picking through Jo’s soggy fries. He quickly came to the same conclusion as Jo, shoving the nasty potatoes away and poking at Dean’s tray.
“C Novak? Isn’t that that Castiel kid?” Jo asked. She took a sharp intake of breath and Dean felt her small hands on his shoulder. “Oh, Dean.” She sighed, and it would have felt comforting if it didn’t feel pitying.
Dean tried to shift and remove himself from the tub as best he could, without squishing Cas, which proved to be a challenge. He gestured a hand out to help Castiel climb out of the tub, bracing himself on the sink. They were thoroughly soaked and Dean couldn't help the laughter that bubbled out of him. Cas stared at him bewildered a moment before the bathroom door tentatively creaked open revealing a confused Sam standing on the other side.
“Jo’s already tricked me into going with her to some school art thing next week. And there’s a big Doctor Who thing on Christmas. But that’s all I got.”
He let the group continue talking and started picking and stacking folding chairs to return to the supply closet.
"Spending my time with you is not what I would classify as 'having a good time.'" Again, with the finger quotes.
Most everyone had left in the time it took to clean up. Just the Harvelles and the Novaks left helping pick up. Ellen and Mary were still stood around the kitchen talking while Mary loaded the last of the dishes into the dishwasher. Jo was clutching a big paper plate with foil over it labeled DONT TOUCH FOR CHARLIE.
“I know honey, it’s just been so long since I’ve seen you two together, I’m just so excited the two of you are friends again.”
He took off his glasses, setting them on the desk, and rubbed his eyes. It was late. But he was still painfully hard just thinking about actually talking face to face with Clarence, the rush of possibly having a little something more than just a chatting jerk-off buddy. Like bees in his stomach again.
“Oh, right!” Jo said, bouncing in her seat. “The winter art show is like, right at the end of winter break, and I need you to be my wingman.”
Cas wound his arm around Dean's waist and nuzzled his nose against his neck, humming contentedly. Dean all but melted against the contact, placing his glasses on the bedside table before wiggling back against the other boy. He could feel Cas smile and nuzzle just a little deeper. He had waited a long time to be intertwined like this again.
and opened tumblr. Not a whole lot going on. Same basic posts as every other day. He quickly was growing bored with it when a Skype alert sounded for a chat invitation from
"Because you left the drawer wide open and allowed this to happen. And on top of that, there are cornflakes everywhere. Why is that, Dean? Can you explain to me why that is?"
"So why are you even here Dean?" Cas crossed closer to Dean, fire in his eyes, kicking the stray silverware out of his way. "You have an apartment of your own, yet you come here after work and watch the same six channels I know you have at home. Why are you here?"
“Mno he iffnt!” Dean nearly shouted again, half spraying food across the table, and nearly knocking his own glasses off.
They were maybe 20 minutes (and four and a half beers) into the movie when Sam's phone started going off, earning him a scowl from his roommate and brother.
Dean hmmed in approval and leaned into Cas' warmth under the blanket. “You know, we could probably swim out here when it gets warm enough.”
“Whatever. It was like 6th grade. The point is he doesn’t wanna sit with us. And I don’t really wanna sit with him.”
Jo looked at him with an indiscernible face and elbowed Charlie next to her. “Do you believe this crock of shit Winchester is spewing? It’s more cryptic than the weird shit Ash says.”
Castiel sat back on his knees, eyebrows knitted together in confusion and hands up in surrender. “Sorry, I didn't mean to- what'd I do wrong?”
“My name is Corbett. I mean, my name is -uh Alan, but nobody calls me that except my dad. I’m a sophomore. And uh, I’m really into paranormal studies.”
“Uh yeah, I’m new or whatever. They told you about me, right?” A gruff and unamused voice shot back flatly.
"Because you're a fucking neat-freak and you're gonna want to wash all that shit before you put it away?"
Dean rolled his eyes hard and didn't miss and angry burn in Cas' eyes. "Telling Sam doesn't get jack shit done, Cas, hes never fucking here. He comes home to sleep and then hes gone again. You see him more than I do."
“There’s also an apple pie finishing up in the oven right now.” Mary said, searching through the cupboards for a glass.
“Well, yeah. You girls just gettin’ to notice this?” Ash replied while Dean tried to get his food situation under control.
“Does that Cas kid keep staring at you?” She asked, gesturing at him with a thumb and taking a bag of chips from Dean’s tray.
He opened his mouth to respond, but his brain was unwilling to cooperate, so he just nodded back. Cas smiled at him and stared maybe a little longer than he should before he crawled back out and headed back up to the school.
[southern_comfort] careful brother i head everyone you meet online is a creepy old man in a trenchcoat
It ended up not being too bad. Alfie had a fairly large painting on one wall, and they found him right off. It was some sort nondescript figure, but it was big and angelic and looked kind of like it was wearing a Wiener Hut uniform. He was pretty excited to have something in the gallery at only his freshman year, considering a lot of artists at the school had to wait until their junior or senior year to be noticed, apparently.
Dean shucked his pants and overshirt and crawled into bed, curled up and tense, listening to Cas breathe and shift. He contemplated just getting back out of bed and getting a snack or maybe checking if Clarence was online when he felt a warm weight against his back.
“Considering your previous track record,” Dean bit back, pushing past him, “I’m not entirely sure you’re capable of it.”
“I have a raid this weekend,” Charlie said without looking up from her phone. “But depending on what time everything goes down I can make an appearance.”
"So, uh. What are we?" Cas asked out of fucking nowhere, and in the middle of a Star Trek marathon, earning himself an incredibly confused stare from the other man.
“I thought you didn’t want me.” Dean whispered, almost too quietly, but entirely too loudly for his own well being. The words hadn't even checked his brain before they were spilling out of his mouth. Before he could mentally chastise himself he had an armful of Cas, wrapped around him and holding him, pressed against the impala.
It only took a single trip with both of them working, they crammed the folding chairs into the bed and closed the gate.
when he felt the other boy sucking a dark mark into his skin. He hooked his legs around Cas' thighs and definitely did
Dean got quickly out of the impala and jogged up the drive, and yeah the house looked even bigger when he was standing close.
"DEAN!" Cas shouted into the main hallway of the small apartment, "Dean I know you're here, I can hear the TV in the living room, get in here now!"
"What do you mean what? Its a pretty straightforward question, Dean." Cas bit back, a pinch of anger in his tone.
and before he knew it he was spilling onto the shower floor and only feeling a little guilty and a little more ashamed. Jerking it to thoughts of a complete stranger was one thing, but to thoughts of Cas was a whole different ballpark.
“I hope you all had an awesome and fattening short break. We’ve only got a few more weeks til finals, so I’m not gonna really put pressure on you guys to get stuff done before then. We are, however, going to get a jump on Awareness Week and its uh, awareness, I guess. The Kinkos down the street only lets you get so many free prints a day with your school ID, and we need, like, a metric fuck ton of flyers. So we’re gonna need to figure out what the hell the flyer is gonna look like soon, so we can delegate out whose printing how many, what days.” He glanced up and saw Becky with her hand all the way raised, practically vibrating in her seat. With a sigh he gestured towards her. “Becky, what.”
. He tried to rocket his mind into another pocket of thought, but with Cas his brain had very limited range of things it wanted to contain.
“Can I help you?” Mr Fitzgerald’s voice broke the silence of the classroom and had half the class’s gaze momentarily.
. He wasn't even aware there were houses this size in the neighborhood. He pulled into the drive and took an appraising look at the house before checking his GPS again, and yeah this was definitely the right place. He was half tempted to call Cas just to make sure, when the front door opened and Cas waved at him from the porch.
"Stupid." Dean muttered to himself, and climbed into the impala. "Freakin’ pointless ass conversations.
“Is it that guy over there?” She whispered twisting around to gape at him. “He doesn’t look like your type but he’s a total babe. He’s new right? I bet I could get him to come sit with us.”
When the chairs were set up and students began filing in Dean ran down to Coach Mills office to let her know they were starting. She gave him a polite nod and he turned on his heel and ran back.
He didn't really mean to work himself up over the situation, but honestly he did this kind of thing more than he was willing to admit. It was the real reason he tended to hang out with his friends less than he really wanted to. He was always judging the things he said after the fact, harshly criticizing every word that came out of his mouth. Usually once every few weeks he managed to convince himself that one of his few friends hated him, or thought he was obnoxious for whatever reason. It was never
He could feel someone’s eyes on him, and when he turned to look he saw Cas, eyes darting away and back to the open sketch pad on his desk. Dean rolled his eyes and turned back around. In the last couple weeks they Dean had fallen into a comfortable pattern of pretending Cas wasn’t around. Ignoring him in English class. Ignoring how close their lockers were. Ignoring him in study hall. Ignoring the abstract painting in the art hallway that definitely resembled Lilith Novak. The thing he couldn’t ignore was the staring. He tried, he tried to pretend it wasn’t weird or creepy or excessive or really happening at all, but it was.
Dean nodded and they fell back into a comfortable silence. The air was biting cold around them, but their shared warmth was nice. The pool of warmth coiling in Dean's stomach was a little less nice, and he mentally scolded himself for the way his mind always went back to thinking about Cas
"That’s disgusting." He spit back, watching the other boy pinch the glowing cherry out of the filter, and flick the butt away. "You’re not even old enough to buy cigarettes."
“Mom! It’s a totally normal day. I told you I didn’t want a big event or anything. I didn’t even mention it to Cas, he just wants me to do a little car maintenance for him.” Dean replied grumpily, straightening his glasses on his face.
Dean could already feel the arousal pooling in his stomach as he scrolled through more of his pictures, some more and less explicit, all of them without his face. He clicked
“I'm so sorry, Dean.” Cas muttered into the junction of his neck and shoulder, and it practically punches through him.
Dean was ahead on his English book and his only homework for the week was to read a few chapters, so he was as good as set for the night. He headed up to his room and opened his laptop.
Jo sat down next to him, scrunching her nose up at his lunch pile. “When you come up for air I’ve got a favor to ask you.”
"Whats up, Cas?" Dean asked, poking his head into the opposite kitchen entrance. "Woah, big mess, nice job, dude."
"Its not a 'no biggie,' Dean." Cas shouted, finger quotes and all, "You never clean up after yourself. You don't even live here and yet I find myself cleaning up after you every day! You show up, eat food you didn't pay for, make a mess in a place you don't pay rent to, and I'm the one who has to clean up after you!"
Dean turned and placed a hand on Cas’ shoulder, eyeing the tear tracks streaking his cheeks. “Cas.” was the only thing he could think to say back, but Cas met his eyes and leaned into his touch.
He felt Cas’ eyes on him again, but he ignored it until the bell rang, quickly jamming his notebook into his bag and rushing out of class.
"Fine," Jo sighed back and tossed her hand on cards into the discard pile, "Ash sucks at Caravan anyways. Now that you're here we can at least play blackjack." She gathered up the cards and dumped them on the card table.
"Are you sure?" Sam's voice rang through the hallway. Cas jumped back off of Dean, sprawling himself onto floor, still wide-eyed and flushed. "Thank you so much, honestly, I really appreciate it. First thing tomorrow. I'll be there as soon as you get to your office. Thank you so much, seriously."
When he came to there were kids swarming around his car, running to buses and getting in cars and his phone in his lap had a new text.
“Like freshman year. He didn’t like the way I talked to him, or some shit. You think he’s weird and creepy now, you should have seen him then. His head has always been that big, his body just caught up. Plus I guess he’s just always friends with seniors. Anyways, he found me after school, got one of his cronies to knock my lights out, guy called Uriel. Friggin' huge for a teenager, all bald and grumpy, whatever. He shoved me into my locker and left.”
Cas nodded and fastened Dean’s pants again, smoothing his shirt back down his tummy in the process. “Can I at least..?” He asked, motioning a hug with his arms. Dean nodded and Cas leaned in wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist, face snuggled into his chest. “I would very much like to be friends with you again, Dean.”
“I’m fuckin’ starving, man.” Dean mumbled, shoving half a slice of pizza into his mouth and unwrapping his twinkies.
"Yep, same as it always was." Dean spit back. He heard Cas sigh on the other end. "What do you want, Cas?"
“If I can make one person physically sick a day, I feel like I’ve done my job.” She said with a smile.
He followed Cas down the hall and to a big room devoid of furniture. Instead, were plush pillows and beanbag chairs scattered around the room, a pile of books and Cas' backpack in the center. He plopped down on a particularly squishy looking beanbag chair and popped open his latin textbook, ruffling through his bag with the other hand to find his notebook. Dean shrugged off his backpack and jacket and plopped down probably closer to Cas than he needed to and pulled out his own latin notebook.
The front door slammed hard, and Cas winced. Without looking up from his latin book he he sighed, grumbled, and shifted away from Dean's side.
"So fuckin' gorgeous, Cas," he whispered into the tanned jut of skin and bone, nuzzling his nose against the man underneath him and placing another tender kiss on the bruise mottled skin.
The annual barbeque was as it always is, which is to say, chaotic. Mary planned all week for it but there was always something crazy that happened last minute and threw a wrench into the gears. This year Mary had finally replaced her ancient rusted out grill with a fancy propane one from Sears and Bobby was fighting with it. Dean surveyed the yard looking out for anyone who had arrived early. Sam and his friends were all gathered up at the picnic table they had dragged out of the garage. Jo and Ash were playing cards in the grass, suspiciously next to a pile of folding chairs Ellen had sent Jo over with. Pastor Dan was making small talk with a few other adults he didn't immediately recognize, probably Mary's coworkers. Rufus was challenging Sheriff Mills to a rousing game of corn hole and losing terribly.
Cas smiled back and snatched them from Dean's hand. And if he leaned a little closer to than necessary Dean, neither of them said anything.
"Yeah yeah I can-" Sam pulled the phone from his face covering the mouth piece and looking apologetically at the others. "One of my assignments submitted wrong, and if I don't go sort it out I could fail the course. You guys aren't gonna be pissed if I leave are you?"
Dean snorted a laugh and mentally checked out of the conversation. He didn’t particularly care for Meg, or her weird friends, but if it made Jo happy he was willing to go to stupid art shows or go shopping cart racing or take her knife shopping or whatever dumb thing Jo came up with for him to do, like she always did.
He made it halfway to the door texting and walking before he bumped into somebody. He lifted his eyes to apologize, but before the words could leave his mouth he was met with a familiar blue gaze.
“It might.” He replied distractedly, eyeing a particularly strange and vaguely vulva shaped sculpture.
They started up a game of blackjack, and when Cas arrived they dealt him in. A few times Dean caught Mary watching them silently, smiling when she turned her head away. The Novaks leaving ate up Dean, but knowing what Castiel went through when they arrived in Pontiac broke Mary's heart. Mary had always had a soft spot for helping people, and Castiel was always told that he was welcome in their home when his own got to be too much. The thought of him hundreds of miles away and suffering the loss of a parent without the same safety net that he had given Dean when John had died just made her sick. Seeing him here now and fitting right back in where he had been torn from filled her with light.
[literallybatman] yeah well I’m trying to get as much living as I can done before I’m fucking swamped with finals bullshit
Before Dean could answer back she was off down the hallway, scurrying to class. He slung his backpack over his shoulder and rushed off to auto shop.
Dean picked up a dish towel and stepped up to the sink, taking a wet dish from Mary, quickly drying it, and placing it into the overhead cupboard. Half of the dishes were done before Dean paused and cleared his throat.
Sam snorted a laugh and Cas covered his mouth, presumably stifling his own laughter. Dean side-eyed them both.
"Nobody knows the rules to Caravan, Ash. You ever stop to think the reason no one understands it but you is that the rules are made up?"
Cas Novak in a seat facing his on the opposite side of the room. And looking at him with his stupid eyebrow quirked in a confused expression. Making eye contact with those stupid gorgeous blue eyes Dean always loved.
look he usually had. He couldn't help but smile and lean it, placing one more chaste kiss on his lips.
He reached on hand up his chest, thumb grazing a nipple. The other hand slid down, gripping and adjusting his
was going to find a way to punish me for the way I was. When they sat us down in the new house and told us why we had moved Michael looked at me with hate in his eyes. I mean, I was just a kid, and hes- hes-” he cut himself off with a hand over his eyes, wiping away whatever it was he had taken issue with. “And it sounds so
and checked to see what his queue had posted while he was at school. It wasn’t long before his Skype noise chirped and a message popped up.
[southern_comfort] goin out in the bay while the weathers still half decent, nothin but us and the water
Dean smiled to himself. There was something about Clarence that got him happy and half-hard and really fucking sexually pent up.
“Yeah. I mean, we didn't do anything too it since we left. Its still basically an electric shed at the lake, and now there's probably some weird animal living in it. But no, we never sold it. We could go this summer, if we wanted.”
“Ash, actually. When I woke up and calmed down I called him. He broke into the school and got my locker open. I had a black eye for like a week. It was so stupid. My mom wanted me to do something about it, but it turns out Zach’s dad is like the superintendent or something. Ash planted drugs in Uriel’s locker though, got him expelled. You should have seen the look on his stupid face. It was almost worth the panic attack. Since then I’m not really big on hanging around, or really even making eye contact with people from our school. Or really at all, actually.”
The minutes until his class ended seemed to stretch for ever, and by the time he was headed to study hall Dean could feel his skin vibrating.
He clicked back to tumblr and went to Clarence’s blog. No new posts in weeks. He kicked out away from his desk and spun his chair around in circles, staring absently at the ceiling.
“Oh. Hey, Cas.” Was the only thing his brain could awkwardly spit out. The bees in his stomach buzzed so hard he could feel them in his fingertips.
Ash was the only one who had gone to the same school as him since elementary, he met Jo in middle school and Charlie freshman year. They didn’t really know any of the backstory with Cas, but even Ash never knew just how close the two were. If anybody was gonna call Dean on his shit, it would be Ash. Jo had no problem trying, but she didn’t even know the beginning of the story there. He leaned his forehead on the steering wheel and zoned out.
Dean sighed deep and thunked his head onto his desk. It wasn’t as if he didn’t have any friends. He had plenty of friends. They just didn’t ever really hang out with him outside school. They all had their own lives. As long as he had an Internet connection he’d be fine without them. He could stream whatever movies or series or talk to whatever online friends he wanted. Besides, too much social interaction tended to make him anxious.
and Dean was off like a firecracker. They had actually somehow managed to make it to Cas' room before Dean had pulled his shirt open and hoisted his own tee over his head. It wasn't long before he had Cas flat on his back on his own bed, whimpering as Dean pulled open his stupid pretentious slacks and trailed soft little kisses down his abdomen.
