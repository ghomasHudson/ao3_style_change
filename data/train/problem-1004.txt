talk about that, yeah?” John continued amused, still completely unfazed.
"Let's never do that again, yeah?" He searched Sherlock's eyes, hoping his beloved would understand the depth of his regret. However, he was rewarded with that adorable way Sherlock scrunched his nose when he was confused.
And now? Now that he was back? John had hoped to feel less lonely. He had hoped to get his Sherlock back. He had hoped to feel as if he belonged again. But where was that smile? The glint in his eyes? He hadn’t seen it in a long time. Had it ever been back since Sherlock’s return? There had always been a silent understanding between the two of them, but now John had the feeling that he didn’t understand Sherlock at all…
Flashes of intangible non-memories. A very young self running through a forest, calling for something, someone, yelling, screaming until his throat was sore. A bit older version of him in back alleys, beaten up, sore for other reasons, in other areas of his body. A fairly recent Sherlock somewhere foreign, languages he faintly remembered, faces he couldn't place, different kinds of pain on body and soul.
“Yes, you berk, I perfectly know what a… oh, for fucks sake.” John growled, annoyed that he once again fell for Sherlock’s banter.
Additionally, wasn't it quite a hilarious coincidence that on top of everything even the music seemed to play tricks on him. Everything and everyone seemed to conspire against him. Of course he knew the song John was playing upstairs! After all, it was from the same album as the song Sherlock had danced to not mere hours ago. Even if his brother kept insisting that the universe was rarely so lazy; this was definitely proving him wrong! At least one satisfying thing about this situation.
Sherlock was afraid.
That was also the reason why John didn’t notice any of the incoming texts
Oh god, what a mess. How would he ever be able to sort this again.
Godforsaken bollocks-eating motherfucking Christ! Uhm… John cautiously peeked at the people around him through half closed eyelids; he hoped hadn’t said that one out loud. But well, it
“How can you be sure?” Sherlock shouted, but reigned his temper in immediately. “You can’t know,” he said, in a lower voice, calming himself down. “John, be honest. How often have you been in danger because of me? How often have I hurt you?” When John stayed silent, Sherlock only nodded. “It would have been too much eventually. At some point it would have been the last straw, it was
"You’re a Doctor who owns a white coat and a stethoscope, aren’t you?" Sherlock purred into John's ear. "You’re also an army Captain who kept his old fatigues and dog tags." Sherlock straightened and looked into John's eyes, suddenly much more serious. His voice low and soft when he said, “I have all I need, I couldn't possibly wish for more."
One finger explored the tender skin, the wrecked, badly healed, scarred flesh, which made him feel inferior, which had caused all his current misery.
to do. Even being in the middle of a warzone hadn't stood in the way of John Watson being a doctor. There was only one thing that had stopped him so far and that had been his injury from being shot. This was really the only cause Sherlock could think of which could interrupt or end John's career as a doctor — injury, illness, death. Evidently, John wasn't dead — Sherlock shivered at the mere hint of that thought — and last time he had seen him, walking out of Baker Street without even bothering to climb the stairs even though Sherlock was finally awake after a pretty nasty breakdown, John hadn't seemed to be injured either. If he hadn't been harmed within the last 24 hours, which didn't seem to be the case given the recent phone call, there was left the option of illness which Sherlock could rule out considering… Sherlock's thoughts came to a screeching halt. Could he rule that out? Why? How? Not
After that the poor little razor didn't stand a single chance. It got flung to the side, ending abandoned and ignored on the floor next to the bed.
“Sherlock…” John huffed dismissively.
When Sherlock heard a choked gasp his gaze involuntarily wandered to the spot, to the figure that slowly got shape.
He didn't know what to think. What to make of it. John didn't make sense. Was it the alcohol talking? Perhaps the whole call was only encouraged by the drinks...
"Alright. That's enough. I think it's time for us to leave."
"You better keep your slimy hands off her, otherwise you'd regret it. Understood?" John straightened to his full height and even if it made no difference and he still had nothing on his opponent, his fury made easily up for it.
John kept picking up random objects, eyeing them without seeing, considering them worthless, ignoring them the same moment. Some of them landed in the duffle bag. But at the same pace they were thrown out all over again, nothing seemed important enough to bother himself with.
(See the end of the chapter for
He waited a moment, but when John was only listening attentively and encouraged him to go on, he continued.
“This is the most important thing in my life up to now.” He said, slowly, seriously, after a moment of mementally bracing himself. How much more plainly did he have to be?
Clambering up from his crouch on the floor, he tried to recall details of what they'd told each other, especially of the things Sherlock had shared with him. He bent down to pick up his phone, images of Sherlock flashing through his mind. Sherlock with his violin swaying in front of the window; the vulnerable look in his eyes when John had reached out to touch him; Sherlock furious and yelling in his helplessness; sobbing into John's shirt when he had held him in his arms; Sherlock quiet and thoughtful in the cab: Sherlock passionate and powerful in his dance; Sherlock pained and embarrassed by memories of his past; Sherlock concerned and supportive while he listened to John's confessions; Sherlock agitated and anxious at the prospect of returning to Baker Street; Sherlock currently gaining his confidence to open that door and come home to John. This contradictory man, this wonderful mysterious man; so many layers to unravel, so deep and winded a soul and mind to explore… John suspected he'd never be able to fully understand him. But he'd never stop trying.
"And then you happened." John shrugged a bit bashful. "You just came barging in my life, pulled me along, made no demands. And, yeah… you saw me. Like no-one ever had."
"Well, hello to you, too." Greg answered, yawning.
*** link to song within the chapter (underlined) and in the end notes ***
“Case?” He tried to keep it casual.
"That was…" John said, grinning like a lunatic.
In disbelief and with a bleeding heart John watched as Miss Pirate sweetly traced the lucky chap's chin with her finger while she pulled them closer and closer still; the traitorous Jolly Roger her silent accomplice. She blew the slimeball of a man a kiss, then pretending she got weak in her knees, she landed in the guys lap, straddling his thighs. The notes tucked under the straps shifting, a single one escaping and floating to the floor.
"Good." Sherlock spat and stabbed the food on his plate to death for lack of other volunteers.
“How did what go?” John asked flatly, turning his back on Greg, avoiding his gaze.
If you want to educate yourself about Drag Drama™ I strongly recommend some episodes/seasons of
Slowly, slowly, Sherlock lowered himself, knees shifting, hands gently following the motion—gliding down John’s nape, his neck, his shoulders and chest, brushing over his erect and sensible nipples, making him hiss. Sherlock settled lightly on John’s thighs, both Sherlock’s hands sneaking behind John’s waist, down to his arse and tucking John’s hips forward until their groins met. When their erections pressed against each other, Sherlock pinned John down with his full weight. John let his head fall back, tried to breathe, took a shallow and shuddering breath.
Oh, screw it — quite literally. Or rather, imaginary. What did it matter anyway? Some anonymous bloke who didn't know him and whom he'd never have to hear again in his life... Nothing to lose apart from a couple of pennies. And if it turned out to be a disaster, it wouldn't be his first half hearted wank lately. He'd survive one more. Probably.
When he finally drifted off, in the early morning hours, he slept restlessly. He was thrown from one dream into another, chasing each other as if battling to get the upper hand. All of them circling around one word. John.
They had never talked about any of that. They had never talked about
As if alarmed Sherlock suddenly threw himself fully into the music. It made his curls bounce with every agitated strike of his bow, with every high-pitched note, chased by the relentless beat. It was as passionate as his dancing and John could now see that it was and had always been the same thing. Sherlock bursting from emotions with no other way to express them.
"Told you, that's how I am. What I do. Keep doing." He tried to keep his mood under control. Now they were finally making progress.
"That's not all, is it?" he said under his breath, and John needed a moment to make sense of it. What did he mean? The moment his mind caught up, he groaned. He hated Sherlock just the tiniest bit for reminding him, but he loved him even more for staying true to their promise, to their agreement. For both of them. It was just… he was tired of it. All he wanted was to hold Sherlock, to drown in their kisses, to explore what lay ahead of them. To leave the past behind. But for that…
“Of course… of course, we are, John! I told you that. In my text. Don’t you remember?? You’ll always be my friend. No matter what.” He even looked a bit desperate now, panicked, John thought. He couldn’t wrap his head around what was happening here. He was losing track of Sherlock’s train of thought, of his change of mind. He felt fuzzy. They spoke with each other, but did they talk?
Although, if John would be amenable Sherlock wouldn’t say no. Sherlock would want everything John would be willing to give. He would be just as curious to explore… in which way it would feel different to touch John on a lazy morning in bed than an accidental brush of hands or an awkward hug at a wedding. Was it possible to feel the line between bronzed and pale skin on his neck? Would he be able to detect traces of a healed limp in the lines of thighs and calves? Would there be palpable remnants of a non-existing tremor if he ran his fingers over the palm of John's hand? Was it possible to feel bravery and stubbornness and loyalty in the curve of a bicep? Sherlock tried to swallow the lump in his throat away. He wanted to know every little detail about John. If he’d only be allowed to...
He was so deep in thought and so absorbed in the content (the hotson person was right—the military stuff was quite… uhm… nice), that he was startled by a new incoming message. He frowned. Another answer? Why would they bother with that? Shrugging he opened his inbox anyway—and almost had a heart attack.
“Stop wiggling, Sherlock!” John scolded him.
“You berk,” John chuckled and hugged his ridiculous partner even tighter. “Right, proceed, we must then. With… what precisely?”
Oh, fucking hell!! Watson! Who said anything about him being attracted to you? He’s a fucking sex line operator!! And you’re one of a million, goddammit. And considering the whole thing had been a one off experiment anyway, he had no intention whatsoever to get in contact with that Scott guy ever again. There was really no use to keep thinking about him. This was futile and laughable and not Watson-worthy! He was a soldier, for fucks sake. And a doctor. He didn’t do this sort of thing. This had to stop. Now!
"Arguable…"
John eyed him, “How did you… I mean, how do you know then?”
is what you want to know?” His disbelief undisguised and plain to see on his features. When John didn’t say anything, because he couldn’t, Sherlock straightened and squared his shoulders.
“John,” Greg said, bowing his head a bit to look John firmly in the eye, “first of all, there’s barely a time you're
“Black.” came the answer unprompted. Crisp and in no small way impatient. Well, Mister — you’ve just revealed another boundary to be stretched by Captain Watson…
"I once knew a guy," John said, voice a bit lighter, almost a bit playful. "A great guy, by the way. Yeah, a… a really good man… And he used to say he hated not knowing. And now I understand at least that." he chuckled, got serious again. "I hate not knowing."
“To the very best of times, John.” Sherlock whispered.
if this could work. This specifically gave John the confirmation that Sherlock was serious and intended to make this work, to give it a chance.
John snorted. “What?” he barely managed to ask under his laughter.
Moriarty had played his game well.
“Oh, were there...”
He thought.
But there was John, sitting slumped and boneless on their couch, music like thunder roaring through the air. At first Sherlock had thought this was just his way to get out his anger and aggression. Loud music was known to accomplish that, wasn’t it?
John almost giddily watched the transformation Sherlock had made from the sobbing man in his arms on the kitchen floor at Baker Street to the man he was holding now, confident and composed, relaxed and open
“Wax!” Sherlock exclaimed and sat up, eyes gleaming like a child's at christmas.
" while holding on to Sherlock's hips and thighs and slim waist. Running his hands up Sherlock's sides, over his chest, his nipples. Gliding down again over the rippling muscles of his belly.
"Bit not good. No." John said good-naturedly. This was really endearing. What a breathtaking versatility of entertainment combined in one single person.
"Seriously?" John couldn't believe his ears but followed lead anyway. Wow, what a relief, his cock had strained the front of his pants more than he had been aware of. How could he be this aroused already?
Another smirk, a genuine one this time.
He straightened his spine and took a deep breath. He had to make the best of what he got to offer. He picked up razor and shaving cream and got to work…
*play*
Silence on the other end of the line. Confused and a bit insecure, Sherlock lifted the phone from his ear and checked the screen. Yes, the caller really was John.
, John thought eying and contemplating  the disc. He wiggled it in his hand for a moment.
“Right you are.”
“Being impossible to read.” Apparently, it almost pained Scott to put it into words. John laughed.
call me, won't you?" A tint of worry, a tint of hope. "Contact me? Which ever way?"
“Considering we don’t know how long this case will take I can’t risk any stubble…
Surely John wouldn’t be this sorrowful about Mary leaving, not to this extent anyway. Or was he? Did he miss her face and her smiles? Did he miss coming home to someone he loved? Sherlock had tried to force him back to Mary, but John wouldn’t let him. It had been John’s own choice, not his fault this time… Sherlock was fuming internally. Why was everything always his fault? Why did he always miss things, getting things wrong when it came to people he cared for… when it came to John. Why was John Watson not as transparent as all the other idiots he knew. It was infuriating.
"Nope. That's out of the question. Absolutely no option whatsoever," the man in his arms murmured, trying to look very serious and determined, which made John only laugh harder.
But her only reaction was a grin spreading her lips and her hands sliding down his lower arms. She loosened his grip, laced their fingers together and raised his hands to her mouth. A hint of a kiss blown onto his trembling fingers and she lowered them again to place them on both sides of her hips.
John let himself sink into the sensation of being held. He had difficulties recalling if he had ever been held like this—as if someone deeply cared. He came up blank. Neither his mother, nor his father were very physical; later at uni he had pals and mates… absolutely no comforting hugs there. And with his lovers it had always been him who had done the comforting. He was the super-caring doctor bloke after all, a shoulder to lean on. He had never realised how desperately he needed such a shoulder himself. Until now.
John gulped. Well… uhm… there were only two (rather big even cut up as they were) pieces of sausage left, which lay at the bottom of said cup to frame the base – oh, he couldn’t even think it without cringing – well… the “base” of the bread-roll, he still hadn’t touched. John cringed again. ‘Not touched’ he thought. ‘God, stop this at once!’ But with this new view he couldn’t deny that his so desperately needed food rather closely resembled the shape of….well… a cock.
"Gregory." He said calmly as farewell.
There was a pause. He was seeking for confirmation then?
"Did anything… dunno… happen yesterday?” He inquired. What could possibly have happened yesterday? He felt horror rise.
“You’re too small to emanate a sufficient amount of body heat to meet my needs because your short height diminishes the effective expanse of surface; in this case temperature transferring skin.” Sherlock prattled while inching even closer to John, who—despite his apparently too small surface—tried to engulf his beloved in his arms and warm him; angling with one hand for the blanket on the floor to cover them.
They snuggled in bed together, as John thought that might be most comfortable, and John opened his laptop.
“John!” Scott inhaled sharply, scandalized. Only when John couldn’t hold back his chuckle, Scott blew out his breath and picked up again. “One high at most would be much better for your leg. I’d say 17 steps would be the optimum – not too straining while still the perfect amount of daily exercise.”
A short awkward silence fell between them. But rather than being put off John felt strangely honoured. And excited. Thrilled even, which his cock, still hard as a rock, could confirm.
John cleared his throat and sniffed away the tears threatening to fill his eyes.
After one last stare he hoped was threatening enough the cabby shut up. John closed his eyes again and wished himself to be far far away, anywhere but here.
“No, John! No. I…” Sherlock seemed to squirm internally, “I want this, John.” He looked up at John. Face open and honest. “I want this. I just don’t know… how. I’m not good at... I’m not good at this.”
"You did that for me that… bouncy-thing?" John blushed, which was absurd considering the extent of their physical… uhm… activities.
Suddenly he realised the way John had
Wrong side.
“Oh, but I'm not wearing a jacket right now.” Scott purred. John swallowed, his eyes dropping shut. Christ, this voice. “Do you want to know what I'm wearing, John?”
“Client? You’re not a…” This time it seemed to be honest confusion and apparently it took Scott a moment to process what John had said. After a short pause though he seemed to have sorted his thoughts. “Ooohhhh… Right. You mean
for himself. To live with him. In his quarters. As some sick sort of treasure, just to sit behind glass like some breakable China. That matches what I deduced. At least as far as him wanting me alive, or rather something in that range. That's also why I was certain he wouldn't harm me. At least not seriously. As he said, he just likes to ‘watch me dance’…”
“What do I look at?” he asked.
John, conveniently calmed down again thanks to over-heated tubes crowded by sweaty smelling people, followed him, came standing next to him at the sink and waited to be briefed about the upcoming agenda. When Sherlock started to unpack and inspect various versions and sizes of cold wax strips though, he couldn’t stop himself from  intervening. Rembering the totally unnescessary torture some of his girlfriends went through to achieve the desired hairlessness, he couldn’t just wait and watch Sherlock putting himself through hell.
“That’s not exactly how it works. And you damn well know that, you git.” John had huffed about Sherlock’s silly behaviour.
"John…"
His head snapped up, his eyes forced open. He needed a moment to get the dizziness out of his head. Sherlock's gaze fixed on the crook of his arm. He tried to digest the sight of bruising marks tainting his skin in rainbow colors - varying from purple to green and yellow. He stared in disgust but couldn't tear his look away. He felt something drop inside him, some sinking feeling and with it he sank back in his pillow, staring into the void. Finally he closed his eyes again to break the spell.
When he stopped right in front of John, planting himself between John’s splayed knees and feet, John felt the heat emanating from Sherlock’s body, could smell the warm distinct and familiar scent of Sherlock’s skin.
“So will you tell me or not?” Scott’s voice shifted to annoyed but he couldn’t fool John. Definitely pouting, definitely adorable as fuck. Jeez, John was so done for. Ridiculous.
"MYCROFT!" Sherlock jumped from his chair and the force of it made it tumble over and clatter on the floor. "If you don't stop this insanity right now I will…"
With difficulties John pulled back, tenderly pushed Sherlock’s curls out of his face. He reached for Sherlock’s shampoo, squeezed a bit of it into his palm and started spreading it in Sherlock’s hair. It was a bit awkward, reaching up for it like he had to with their difference in height, but the blissed out expression on Sherlock’s face made it all worth it. John increased the pressure slightly, moved on to massaging Sherlock’s scalp and marvelled at the man’s beautiful face, all relaxed, eyes closed. Lashes clinging to pinkened cheeks.

John bawled and hiccuped and tried to breathe and wiped the tears from his cheeks which already started to cramp from the non-stop laughter. And all the while Sherlock stood motionless and wondered if he had woken in a parallel universe.
John thought amused, affectionate.
"Cup your fist with your other hand now. Keep stroking your penis." John hurriedly fumbled to pin his phone against his ear with his shoulder, eager to follow suit. "Can you feel my throat? Can you feel your glans bump against it each time I go down on you?" Scott's voice was husky and rough now. Shit, that man really needed a license to be allowed out in the open, this couldn't be legal. Each contact the sensitive skin of the head of John's cock made with the rough calluses of his hand palm, sent sparks flying through his neurons. Wouldn't take long now to set him completely on fire…
When a hand settled on his shoulder and squeezed slightly, he turned furiously to bark at whoever dared to touch him. When he met the pleading eyes of an obviously exhausted Miss Pirate he could have wept of the relief that flooded his entire being.
John swallowed hard. He was certain that he could literally physically feel the heat radiating from that other body in the room. He was certain that he could feel that heat spreading through his veins until he felt it simmering under his skin, until his heart and body were burning. This was really not a good time to be this affected.
"..."
“Sort of.” John answered. “Doesn’t matter! Still, would you go now? Please!” he added.
"When should I have? And how?" Sherlock hissed, hurt, eyes narrowed to slits. "Should I just have walked up to you, sitting cosily on the sofa together and tell you ‘John, by the way, let me show you where I go, to
This time, knowing he had said what had needed to be said, he could allow all the happiness to bubble up and to infuse the way he met John's kiss; much firmer, less chaste. A tight press of dry lips moving against each other, slowly more and more sliding, moistened by nipping teeth, sucking lips, the tips of tongues darting out, tracing lines.
John’s knees went weak and he had to regain some composure when suddenly Sherlock straightened and cheerily, all back to business, said, “Alright, let’s get it over with then.” God, living with this man was one hell of a rollercoaster ride.
“When did you tell me?” Sherlock asked quizzically.
“That's my man.” Scott said content, warm and smooth, and John wondered how a voice could feel like velvet on his skin. ‘My man’... yes, please...
Just staying there, just breathing, just existing.
"..."
“Thank God,” he whispered over and over again.
“Can I show you one of my songs, too?” John asked cautiously. When Sherlock hesitated he added, “I’ll explain along, yeah? It’s just… it’s so damn fitting.” He searched Sherlock’s eyes. “And yeah, I never thought I’d show it to you either.” The thought made him smile. “But that’s good, no? Because now we can!” He looked for Sherlock’s confirmation and was happy when it came.
, yes.” John answered happily with all the passion he felt rising in that moment.
"It wasn't so much about me, about 'coming out' or whatever. I didn't support her one speck even though we both knew we were the same. Or at least similar. I was the lucky one who could hide behind a facade of half-truths though. The day she moved out I literally saw the hurt of betrayal in her eyes. The bond we had broke that day and has never been fixed since."
mean to me!”
"No, actually I don't. What
"You… didn't?"
John was tired of worrying about Sherlock. It was eating him up to sit at home and to wonder if Sherlock was alright, if he would come back, if anything had happened. He had the feeling he should be at his side, have his back, but wasn’t allowed to do so. He was tired of being left in the dark.
John snickered, completely unnecessarily blushing at the sudden turn of topic. He rested his head against the window to his side and closed his eyes.
When he couldn’t drag it any longer he stood, paid, nodded to the barkeeper and left the club.
John refused to react to any of this, too tired of all that, too confused at the moment. He tried to shut the cabby down by glaring at him, clenching his jaw and hissing at him: “If you’re not bloody going RIGHT NOW, I’ll make you see some ghosts yourself,
When Sherlock didn’t answer, just rolled his eyes and looked away again, she added: “And not just me, you know?” There was a hint more stubborness in her voice now. Sherlock sighed.
John stared at the phone. Was this…? Couldn’t be the same Scott, right? But then… What were the odds that there were two Scotts working for the same hotline? Or was Scott just a common sex worker alias? The male version of Lolita? John wouldn’t know…
This gaze made John quiver to the core and he had to control himself not to pull that gorgeous face down from where it was towering high above him for a deep thorough kiss. He felt slightly ridiculous—or rather not only slightly—next to Miss Pirate whose heels added at least another 4 inch to the usual 5 Sherlock had on him anyway. He felt like a hobbit. However, nobody but him seemed to care, which might have been caused by his possessive hand visibly placed either on her back, arse, hip or occasionally on her nape, even though he had to reach up for that. Or, Miss Pirate’s bashful attitude displayed in the moments John paid her obvious attention. The way she created the illusion that she'd deliberately make herself smaller while still losing none  of her grace—John was fairly impressed—might have added to the image that John was fully in charge.
actually… I don't know anymore what is you and what is the song, Sherlock. I mean…" the tiniest of pauses, passed almost unnoticed, almost, "I'm here, listening to that song and trying to understand—I really do try, Sherlock—but you're all the way over there, far too far away, and I can't ask you and you can't… This way we'll never… What I mean is… God, why is this so difficult?" Sherlock could picture him running his fingers through his hair in frustration. Whispered under his breath, "Sherlock? You still there?"
“And?”
He sighed deeply and buried his face back into the duvet. Wishing the day to pass and his mind to shut the fuck up, John let the music of his playlist just randomly wash over him. Trying not to feel anything, trying not to feel anything, trying not to think about anything.
"Well then…" Scott said with a small voice.
“I couldn’t risk losing you.” Sherlock whispered. John frowned.
“Hmmm,” John winced, quite embarrassed, “I guess…”
He leaned up and kissed John tenderly, the taste of their mixed tears on their lips.
so much is the better question." Sherlock said quietly, tracing John's forearms with his fingertips.
“Don’t worry, I keep my nook tidy and well guarded. No predators—natural or not—ever got to me.” He spread his arms as if to say ‘look, here I am’ and John had to give him that; he had at least taken good care of himself.
Mycroft had his eyes squeezed shut and his face was still an interesting shade of red. When he calmed down a bit, Greg stood again and looked down at Mycroft, his hands stemmed into his sides, frowning. After a few more coughs and downing his tea Mycroft looked up, embarrassment clearly written over his face. He winced and opened his mouth, obviously to offer any kind of excuse, but the moment his eyes met Greg’s, no words did come out. For a moment there, John felt reminded of the situation on the porch with the two men ignoring him. When Mycroft’s gaze started roaming over Greg’s body, still damp from the shower, drops of water still clinging to his skin, some slowly sliding down his neck, shoulders or biceps, others meandering their way between softly defined pecs downwards over a not quite muscled but nonetheless fit and trim middle, John actually had to avert his eyes because he felt like an intruder. His eyebrows raised till under his hairline and his mouth pulled into an unbelieving grin. He shook his head. A high pitched chuckle escaped him, which seemed to shake the other two men out of wherever they had drifted off to.
Even John himself felt the tension rising each time Miss Pirate was about to leave the stage again—balancing herself on her heels as if it took no effort whatsoever, her hips swaying broadly while she was strutting over the narrow extensions spreading from the stage in all directions.
“Because now...” Scott whispered as if letting John in on a well kept secret. “I can open it with my teeth.”
Internally John chuckled. As if that was even necessary. This creature had wrapped him around his little finger already. So he only answered vaguely: “Mmm, yes.”
He had been angry! With himself. For lowering his shields, for getting weak, for letting his defences slide. With John. For making it so hard for him to stay determined, for making it so hard for Sherlock to protect him, to do the only reasonable thing. Sherlock had been scared by how much he had been tempted to give in. He had been so close to making the biggest mistake of his life.
Like in a fog he knew he was moving but no direction, no goal, no reason crossed his mind. He had to remind himself to keep breathing. Breathing was boring, but it kept him alive. And as much as he wished otherwise he had to stay alive. For John. Even if they would never cross paths again, John would find out if Sherlock died. And even if John excluded Sherlock from his life, he was a man of sentiment. He would grieve if only for the good old times. And that was something he would never do to John Watson again.
He nudged her goodnaturedly and one last time they entered the club. One last time donning the attitude of her pimp; and this time it felt good—because he
“So…” His voice was still croaky, “you looked for a job as a medic then?”
When he turned he was able to breathe again. He tried to get a grip on himself, some defined steps, something that needed strength but was calming. Arabesque stretched to the extreme, back bent, abbs straining. Developé high, higher, until his muscles burned, his inner thighs felt torn. He let his upper body fall to the side, evade the strain, the pain; dove into the deep. Turned, resurfaced. Better.
This explained things; a lot of things actually. But not all of it.
"More comfortable around Captains." Sherlock winked, but John felt something sharp surge through his intestines.
Sherlock had apparently lost all ability to argue and just followed suit. He wobbled a bit on his legs but John helped him. The moment the hollow of Sherlock’s knee settled over John’s shoulder he abandoned Sherlock’s cock, under very vocal protest and curses, for the sake of fondling and checking Sherlock’s sac for hair in need of a trim. The detective cursed some more only now for different reasons.
, John had written. What was that supposed to mean? Because John
“Yes. Yes, he’s up. And his own old self again. As snarky as ever…” Sherlock could literally feel the wink she gave John. Apparently she was expecting to provoke some easiness, but all that happened was John clearing his throat.
Sherlock only huffed and shifted a bit in John’s arms; most likely sitting in the same position was a bit uncomfortable after the rough treatment he had inflicted on himself. The blush John could spot on his cheekbones also indicated that he was either abashed or flattered by John’s words. Or both.
“Yes.” Sherlock said, calmly, closing his eyes for a short moment before looking back at him, “Yes, John, you’re right.”
"It wasn't your time." Sherlock said softly.
“Don’t need biscuits anyway,” he smirked at Sherlock, who smiled coyly back and looked slightly embarrassed about having been that transparent. “Or do you have a raging need for food right now?” John winked at him and Sherlock only huffed but couldn’t hide his smile, because they both knew that food would be the absolutely last thing on Sherlock's mind right now. With that the tense atmosphere in the room got a bit lighter, breathing was a bit easier.
"Preferably forever if you're amenable." John leaned over to speak into his ear and Sherlock felt the distant hum turn into a buzz that sizzled over his skin like the gaslike flames of his Bunsen burner.
"Now listen… The correct metric is: 'O-Christmas-Tree-O-Christmas-Tree' rather than the ear insulting 'Ohhh-Christmas-Tree-eeee-Ohhh-Christmas-Tree-eeee' you're indulging in. Hear the difference? Obvious, isn't it?"
“Black,” Scott answered, more clearly now though still not as wordy as he usually was. John considered that a good sign.
So, how was he supposed to have a sensible conversation there and then? Being brutally pulled out of his reverie, still half lingering in his mind's delights, facing the object of his indecent thoughts and trying to withstand the almost unnatural gravity surrounding his… friend?
“I meant ‘here’ as in ‘it’s my stop’.” John rose from his seat and made his way to the door just in time. “I have to get off.”
him leave? Why did he let him leave?
"You're hot, too, John."
But watching his friend being this devastated, on the verge of collapsing, breaking, John swore to himself to never let this man down again. No matter if Sherlock wanted him in his life or not and no matter how strongly and often his own feelings would be hurt, John would never be far away again. He would always have Sherlock's back. If Sherlock wanted it or not. That was where John belonged.
John. You're ridiculous!
Sherlock hummed, still observing John's reaction.
Is there a way to show endless love to persons who live much too far away? Because I want to shower my betas with hugs and hearts and love and life!!! Darlings, how do you even stand me and my 3am emergency beta requests?? 😅 Love you to bits!!!
"Not what your naughty mind comes up with, mate!" Greg still half laughed. "Sweet Molly here is determined to get some healthy food into me. Keeps telling me off for my eating habits at the Yard. She whitters on about why I don't own the donut place on the corner yet. Dunno why?" Greg said, now full on laughing again.
He stared up until his eyes began to water… from the chilly night air. He shivered a bit, went inside to pick up his coat and scarf and settled back in his former spot, wrapped both, coat and scarf, tightly around himself and leaned his head back. He retreated into his mind palace, entered the planning office of the mission and tried to review all the available facts. Because he didn’t want to know, but… he wanted to know. He couldn’t prepare himself like this. Although, he didn’t even know what to prepare for. Prepare… his eyes popped open and he scratched the back of his head on the cracked bark of the tree when he hastily sat up. He looked around and was surprised to see the first wisp of dusty pink along the horizon. The star constellations were hardly visible anymore and he felt a strange kind of melancholie spread through his chest at that realisation. His legs and back felt stiff, his bum was numb, cold and damp from the morning dew slowly creeping in. He stood up, straightened and stretched his limbs and back and cracked his neck.
Still wondering why his senses played cruel games with him, Sherlock entered the kitchen and found it deserted. Even when this was what he had expected, his shoulders sagged a bit and he felt the stab of loss with a force that made him stumble the last steps into the kitchen.
“But you
"He… he didn't say anything?" He made one last attempt.
His foot picked up the rhythm, his heel tapped the dust, his fingers snapped accordingly. His shoulders, his abs, his whole upper body began to work to match his movement, forcing his spine into rocking motion. The muscles in his back contracting and bulging on either side of his spine, sliding underneath his skin, making it stretch and reminding him pleasantly of the boundaries of his own body, his transport.
John only whimpered and went back to preparing tea. He tried to keep breathing as normal, tried to avoid a fit of hysteria. He succeeded, close call.
"Yes, I am."
Why? John felt as if hurled through a salad spinner. This man gave him a mental and emotional whiplash. Until realisation dawned on him and a smirk lifted the corner of his mouth.
The room was desolated, wrecked. Shelves were pushed over, papers that have been sorted were now all over the place. And the photographs he had pinned to the walls neatly arranged by date and occurrence were now dangling on a net of annoyingly bright coloured ropes and cords crossing the room from one wall to the other.
That night John couldn't bring himself to go to bed. Not even to lie down. For no idea how long he stayed where he was, sitting on the uncomfortable bar stool until his buttocks had passed the stage of pain and had settled into numbness. Eventually, he had to get up after all and for the first time since he stayed at Greg's home, he went over to the window facing the water and therefore also Battersea power station. He just looked and stared and watched and wished he could turn on the lights inside by pure willpower until his eyes began to water, which of course was due to not blinking for too long. That's what he told himself. He still felt as if he couldn't see it clearly enough, blaming the layer the window presented, separating him. So he went up to the roof; on his way he grabbed a blanket from the sofa and, cocooned in it, sat on one of the chairs looking in the direction he had avoided for so long, he had feared until now.
To be honest, which John tried very much not to be on this topic, it hadn't even been his first Sherlock themed wank. He had always known that he'd found Sherlock attractive, that in the early days he hadn't been averse to deepen their friendship into something more, that his mind had more than once pondered and wondered about Sherlock's sex life…
“Hello, darling…” Sherlock smiled warmly at her and held his arms out to engulf her in a hug she accepted without hesitation.
"What if
“Okay, great.” John smiled warmly at Sherlock. “Shall I just…?” He pointed with one thumb over his shoulder to signal that he’d make his way to the sidelines. The moment he made an attempt to turn, to give Sherlock some space, Sherlock grabbed his wrist and held him back. John looked curiously at him.
, John." Sherlock frowned.
"John, please pass me my phone." Sherlock groaned.
He reached out to turn the volume down while opening his eyes. His view was blurred by tears and from his eyes being squeezed shut far too long. He cleared his throat and reached forward for the laptop and only then realised a little movement to his left. John turned his head and froze, his breath faltered. He didn’t dare to move let alone say anything.
he wouldn’t deny his love any serious request for help, he raised himself out of his chair, still demonstratively slowly though, and indicated Sherlock to lead the way and that he would follow.
"Okay." hesitantly.
The demands of his bladder woke him. The sun was up high and Sherlock was still out of it. After a visit to the loo and a quick brush of his teeth, John snuggled back under the covers. His cold feet made Sherlock stir and he grumbled and turned to nuzzle his face against John's neck.
“Now?” he rasped, incapable to control his voice.
"Always and only ever right here, on this spot."
In which John Watson is tired of polishing his gun.
"I pretended to need a fix and locked myself up in one of the stalls of the men's," Sherlock continued. Before John could voice his shock, Sherlock went on talking, "I quickly changed, left my purple dress visible, propped into the bag. They found me dressed like this with a strap around my biceps and a syringe half full in my vein."
until now. Perhaps because she had proven to understand Sherlock better than he had expected her to, shown that she knew him on a level far beyond just acquaintances would. Perhaps because he had seen in her eyes that she still held some affection for him but nonetheless supported him to find happiness elsewhere. However most of all, what shocked him into silence was her trust. As she had said
“Oh my god,'' he whispered even though he wanted to scream it out loud, for the whole world to witness the miracle that just happened to him. “Oh my god”, just a breath, barely words at all.
“Honestly, what makes you think you know stuff about me? Who do you think you are?” John hissed.
There were four texts in a row. Sherlock counted the seconds between them. He didn't pull out the phone, although his hand was clenched around it in his trouser pocket. His arm almost trembled with the effort it took him and he was relieved when after the fourth text the seconds kept going by without further interruption. Gradually, he relaxed, tension seeping out, well aware that text messages didn't vanish by ignoring them. This was a problem he had to address later. Why had he even brought his phone?
, it still blurred into his ears.
"No, John, fairies have no lights. Those are fireflies."
In the mornings however, the notes joined their friends in the tin and John tried to stay calm, if it had the right to be called 'calm' at this point, and to convince himself that it didn’t mean anything. Nope, it didn’t. Why would it? Sherlock had said so—it was part of the disguise, no? Part of the game. Miss Pirate's natural behaviour. Christ, was
"Good."
“Hi, uhm, it’s John here.”
“Funny.” John said affectionately.
After a well calculated dramatic pause to give the willing eye time enough to revel in the spectacular sight, she spun around to take in the same position on the other side, as if to secure the deck of her ship; it made the longer back of her skirt swoosh, revealing more of bare skin and taught straps for a short moment, guiding the gaze to the flash of metal, gleaming in the spotlight, at her back—the handcuffs, as always, resting against the swell of her arse, even more pronounced by the layers of leather and lace covering it.
Footsteps faltered.
Trying to clear his thoughts he opened his eyes again, only to find the object of his desire crawling across the stage exactly in his direction.
was the only way Sherlock could express his maleness underneath all the other components and accessories screaming “woman”. As he had said, he liked the sensation of the fabrics on his skin, he liked the process and transformation of applying make-up, he liked the shape and aesthetics of the costume, he liked to dance… but nonetheless it had nothing to do with feeling like a woman. He didn’t want to lose himself while being Miss Pirate. And John wondered if Sherlock had gifted him with that lapdance back then to reveal himself to John, to make sure he wouldn’t miss it.
"Being Miss Pirate." John grinned.
me, John. Deep within. I’m a different man than I’ve been before.” He said, urgently. “You turned my world upside down.”
"You said things. And I also wanted to say things. But then there was too much wine. Which is your fault. Because… candle."
Standing here now, secretly observing Sherlock, he wondered how he had never known. He knew Sherlock was fit even if his lean body had always been just this side of skinny. Since they've been hunting down criminals and running the streets of London often enough, it was only natural to be some kind of athletic. But now, faced with well pronounced abs and pecs, upper arms shaped with bulging biceps, the whole body pure muscle, John found himself staring, swallowing hard, heart racing, holding his breath.
John looked back down at his hands, folded and trembling. He leaned on his elbows propped up on the kitchen counter to hold him upright. After a while he groaned and let himself fall forward until his forehead hit the wood of the kitchen counter with a thud. The dull pain seeping into his senses was a welcomed addition.
"Uhm… okay?" John didn't know what to make of Scotts sudden change of mood. "What reasons?"
Never ever doubt the "Happy Ending" tag.
“No! Stop! Don’t even think about it!” John interrupted him forcefully. “No way I’d let you do this alone! Nope. Not an option!” He shook his head and looked sternly at Sherlock, whose face softened.
"Oh God, sorry!" the precious air came forcefully rushing out of his lungs again. "Yeah, yeah… I… think so. You?"
much… I don’t know where to start.”
Later that night, when his fingertips were tracing circles on the sweaty skin on the back of the man cradled in his arms, John said, "I think we owe Greg a Thank You. We should give him something. Maybe a case solved completely under his name or something." John chuckled and revelled in the feeling of a warm, from laughter trembling body pressed against his side. He cherished the sensation of having the man he loved right next to him.
“Yeah, he's always like that.”
"Okay then. Go ahead, don't let me stop you." John turned to get comfortable on the bed to watch Sherlock, but the man stopped him.
John said emphatically.
Sherlock's insecurity about what "broken up" means is borrowed from the talented
“All of it?”
She lifted the cord holding them with one delicate finger, running it down the chain while making sure she was still gliding across his skin. It made the tags rattle and he could feel more than hear the ragged breath she was taking in.
Placing his feet on the cold wooden floor he hissed, a chill creeping up his shins. Goosebumps made his skin tingle, and there was an unknown thrum in his ears. A sort of numbness damping all his senses.
old grumpy, angry, stubborn and damaged John Hamish Watson.
It was as if this man simply felt no desire and had no needs at all. John had always thought of him as asexual. Probably that was one reason why he had suppressed the slightest hope he once might have had of their friendship becoming something more. Now it all came back with full force, and it frightened him.
Sherlock had to steady himself on the wall. He pulled his left hand free, he now realised was still trapped between the wall and John's arse, and all but collapsed against the wall; catching himself just in time, bumping his hand on eye-level on the wall next to John's head.
"God, no! Heaven forbid!" Scott exclaimed horrified. "Normally, I’m here every Tuesday, Friday and Sunday."
Still sitting on the dusty floor, John drew his knees closer, circled them with his arms and lowered his head to rest his forehead on his knees. He tried to take deep breaths but failed, unsure if it was caused by his crouched position or by the memories flooding his mind. He tried to cherish them though, as they were probably the only thing he had left of Sherlock. Nevertheless, he couldn't help to feel torn between adoration and anger, between gratitude and hurt, between fondness and irritation, between love and… love and…
"You're whistling four-four-time. It really can't be that difficult, can it? Considering it is a tedious Christmas Carol, for God's sake!"
Song for the chapter:
Sherlock could still feel the song waver through his mind, knew the lyrics by heart. But he was curious to listen to it and to imagine  being in John’s place instead. How might John have experienced it, heard it?
"Yeah, that's how it started. After that, we made use of every opportunity we got to see it as often as our time and our money allowed us. I would never have admitted it though, found excuses to avoid telling my mates, complained to my parents, sat in the seat next to Harry and sulked. But I went, you know? I went with her, every single time." He sighed. Thinking back, how utterly ridiculous it had been. And how much hurt it had caused.
John flopped back onto the mattress and rubbed one hand over his face. God, he was so fucked.
*stop*
Without further warning he dove for John's neck, biting there playfully before running his tongue over John's pulse point only to latch on to that sensitive spot and suck vigorously.
"Don't worry, John. You're in good company. Almost everyone is too daft to get it right."
John cleared his throat. “Just think about it... what if my first fears would have been confirmed, what if he
“And then?” Sherlock snarled. “It wouldn’t have made any difference. What would it have been to you anyway? With all your… display of … manliness. All your… rugby… and pub nights and… mates.” He spat out like poison. “The dancing fairy? Just one more to add to the list of the freak’s oddities.” Sherlock turned, his back towards John, keeping his hands busy with the buttons of his shirt.
“Yeah, actually, it was a bit more him than me, but I guess… it doesn't matter anyway. It is what it is.” John shrugged.
He shouldn’t have worried as one of the unusual tunes characteristic for Miss Pirate’s shows announced her in time. The babbling guy zoomed out of John’s focus; he only marginally registered him asking, “That’s her, right?”, before he briskly nodded to confirm and waved him away like a blowfly.
“So... if the lap dances... are all yours alone…” Sherlock puffed out between sharp breaths, holding John’s gaze, holding his cock, “How much are you willing to pay, Captain?” And with a wicked dirty little grin, Sherlock lowered himself and guided the head of John’s cock inside.
Then again, it was 3am. He had been awake after all. Not able to sleep. Never went to bed in the first place. He sat fully clothed in his chair in the sitting room engulfed in the nightly dark. The fire in the hearth long gone cold.
at least have a reason for it…"
“Really, Sherlock?” John hissed furiously. He shifted on the bench to face Sherlock. But when he met the sincerely puzzled gaze on his friends face his anger evaporated like mist in the sunlight.
on tumblr.
Not even a second later there was a slight snoring coming from the man on the bed and Sherlock was left befuddled in his mind and half hard in his pants.
That moment Sherlock had known that it had been a big mistake to come here.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You bet! And when I do I'll break every single bone in your body while naming them!" John called after him, but the man didn't turn and didn't react and then he was gone.
Disappointed, yet relieved, he reached into his coat pocket and fetched his keys. As silently as possible he turned it in the lock, pulled the door a little before opening it to avoid the slightest possible creak. Tiptoeing, and feeling immensely ridiculous while doing so, he made his way up the stairs to the flat he had lived in, expertly avoiding the squeaking steps to not wake Mrs Hudson.
"But the marks…" his voice wasn't as steady and sure as he wanted it to be.
John had the unsettling feeling of being dismissed, discussion closed. He felt dread creeping in on him from the shadows, caging him in, threatening to suffocate him. Was this it? Had this been
Finally able to peer around the corner of the doorway, John's breath hitched and his throat burned in the attempt to keep his breathing quiet.
It’d been several months since they had been back together. Well… when he said back together he didn’t mean like
“Why?” Scott sounded a tad insecure. He was so endearing it almost hurt. “Isn’t that something one does?”
"Love… you're suffocating me." he grunted out, muffled by a shoulder half covering his face and short of breath because of the octopus leg slung around his middle.
When he was able to breath again, he let himself sag against their bathroom cupboard, pulling Sherlock against his chest. The detective let go of John’s softening cock and wiped his hand on John’s trousers.
“I’ll start with the—to me—most important thing.” And back was Sherlock’s tension, but John held his hands, held his gaze, tried to hold him in the here and now. He never averted Sherlock’s eyes when he said, “Sherlock, I need you to stay.” Sherlock looked a bit puzzled. Apparently he had expected something else. But then, that was the whole point, wasn’t it? So he went on, “We’ll talk and see about everything else, but… to me, the most important thing is, to have you here with me! Sherlock, don’t leave me behind again!” Their gazes linked, both still cautious about the others' reaction, they sat in the silent kitchen. “Please. Stay. Here, with me.” John tugged slightly on Sherlock’s hands, trying to further support his plea. “Will you? Stay?” he whispered in the end, when Sherlock only kept looking.
of a goddamn surprise that it was
John would sit at home, waiting for Sherlock to come back, and wondering what the hell was going on.
Sherlock stretching his bare muscular arms forward in a smooth and fluid motion blurring with Sherlock gripping John’s face with both leather gloved hands, turning him and turning, so very close, John could breathe in Sherlock’s fogging breath in the winter air. The look of Sherlock's eyes boring intensely into John’s.
John turned and beamed up at the mesmerising eyes scanning his face.
John’s mind raced; this was not what he had expected. He was clueless as to why Sherlock would react like this.
“Really, Mycroft?” John gave a short and unamused laugh, briefly looking up at the roof, shaking his head in disbelief, then looking back at Mycroft. “I thought we both discussed that one already. A pretty long time ago actually What are you up to?” John turned in his seat to face Mycroft, frowning.
“I'm not wearing any and yours are hideous anyway.” Sherlock said, as if they hadn’t just shared some mind-blowing and absolutely insane sex.
“Sherlock,” John growled. Sherlock clicked his mouth shut, pressed his lips tightly together and swallowed. John nodded, apparently satisfied. “And you said you’re not good with words, yeah? Although I
this blouse (to cover the fake décolleté of course)
He watched himself holding John’s hands; he watched himself being led, following, without resistance. He watched himself gravitating towards the man in front of him, watched the two of them, secure in their own orbit, like two elements connecting, forming a new substance.
“For everything.” John said, plainly. “Just for… everything.” He shrugged. Sherlock still looked puzzled so he continued. “For everything you’ve done for me, Sherlock. For existing in the first place,” he gave Sherlock a tiny smile, “for choosing
, Sherlock thought.
He sounded slightly annoyed.
Holding her hand in place she started bending her knees and sliding down and further down in slow motion, her hand-cupped groin rubbing along the shiny dancing pole until she ended in a crouching position. Heightened by her heels it gave a free view under her skirt, suspenders straining along pale skin, stretched and ready to snap. The black lace of her panty just that sort of non-transparent that heightened the effort to catch a glimpse of forbidden territory underneath. But most of the desired sight was hidden behind a slender hand with spidery long fingers holding the Pirate's most delicate part.
He didn't get an answer. His hopes were faltering. Maybe he had got it all wrong. But this song. The song! Sherlock had chosen it deliberately. This wasn't random or just a personal preference. This was meant to be a message. Something that he hadn't been able to express in his own words. Nothing to misunderstand there. Hopefully. Why didn't Sherlock answer his texts then?
"John…"
“Why can’t you boys take a bit more care of yourselves?” she had mumbled. “Poor John looked even worse.”
"I was just thinking scientifically, I promise!" he said, still not totally free from amusement. "Didn't expect it would turn into this."
"There you are." A relieved smile bloomed on John's lips, making his eyes warm and soft.
However, at some point the fragile lines had begun to blur. It had all started with some crumpled banknotes in a tea tin. John had found them one morning, sleepily reaching into the cupboard and fishing out the wrong tin. His not yet completely awakened brain hadn't been able to make any sense of it and hadn't deemed it important. So, he had just switched the tins, because brewing a tea out of 50 pound notes would be a shame.
“John!” Sherlock gasped, seemingly sincerely surprised and shocked. The hurt flashed through John like high voltage; had Sherlock really thought John had left him behind?
He ran up upstairs taking two steps at a time. He picked the duffle bag from his army times he still kept in his closet and threw in his clothes; randomly grabbing a few of each, stuffing them deeper into the backpack. On the top shelf he happened upon a lidded box he once put there and had successfully forgotten - until now.
“No… not exactly said… not in words…” John squirmed. When he only met Greg’s puzzled gaze, he sighed. “I don’t know Greg, but that’s the vibe I get.”
“You honestly did research?” John asked in disbelief.
"No, John. Please. Spare me… spare
“Doesn’t matter,” he just said and already meant to hang up when John started talking more earnestly.
Walk. Walk. Walk.
"No, John. Nope! Definitely not!" Sherlock shouted. "I'm not including Mycroft or Lestrade in this. I won't hear the end of it!!" Sherlock cringed at the thought alone.
… and still observe instead of turning into a drooling lump on the floor.
The grin he gave John was quite devilish.
As treacherous as his brain was these days, he didn’t succeed. The fingertips of his outstretched hand traced patterns on the cover, cold to the touch. Those high thread fabrics always felt so silky and smooth, soft to sensitive skin, but also sleek and impersonal. The feeling of being on a business trip, residing in a posh hotel, was indivisibly connected. Sherlock had never minded, as the time he’d spent in his bed had always been out of mere necessity anyway. There had never been anything intriguing enough for him to spend more time in bed for. His transport needed time to recharge to go on with The Work and that was it. Tedious. Cold hadn’t been an issue as he’d only gone to bed when he was dead on his feet and was sure to fall asleep the moment he touched the mattress anyway.
"Sherlock, you know how this will end, right?" he squinted his eyes.
But watching Sherlock it oddly made sense. These high pitched sounds, screeching searing violin underlaid with an arrhythmic beat… sounding like a stuttering racing heart.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
It didn’t matter. Not anymore. Sherlock was back and nothing had changed the way he had planned. And now there was this. A cryptic question which meant nothing according to John and was important nonetheless…
"Dunno…" John squirmed, averted Sherlock's eyes. "Yeah, okay, I do, but… it's silly actually." To put it in words was actually pretty embarrassing.
"John, don't be a fool!" Greg had enough. "Just… dunno… look it up, yeah?" He threw his hands up in the air in exasperation.
or this one here:
“God, you…” John whispered when they parted and looked at Sherlock in wonder. “How do I even deserve you…”
Naturally, the equipment was all a bit dusty, but it still worked. So John put in the CD and
Should he go get the box? He was still curious what else would be hidden under piles of Sherlock's death notes. But no. He couldn't fathom that just yet.
I hope you're all safe and well!! Here's to a 2021 that will hopefully be a bit easier on all of us!!!
” Jesus Christ, he had to get this back under control. He hunched over, pulled his curls. It was not okay. He was not okay.
Taking a deep breath he steeled himself for what was about to come next.
He would have died. It had been his heart on the trigger. He would have done it. Pulled the trigger. Died. But only together with John. But he hadn't. Because of John. How was he supposed to knowingly…
Well then, there was nothing to it; his bladder screamed for attention and he felt no desire to ignore it. That desire arose in an instant the moment he moved as much as his little toe. Hell, he had known it.
When he started to feel uncomfortable he shifted and wiggled to get up. He cringed when he felt damp and sticky goo being smeared over his thighs and belly.
"Because we're having tea." Mycroft's unfazed answer came immediately.
Only now, sitting in their respective chairs, enjoying the cosiness of a domestic evening in each other’s company; John reading and Sherlock typing away on his laptop while sipping a G&T each; he realised it had started after the habitual morning with tea and toast and… newspaper.
He sat up on the corner of his mattress, stretched… and groaned. Damnit… Unfortunately, The Voice hadn't been able to magically cure all the tension and contortions and aches and all that crap as well. Pity. Would have been too good to be true. Although, right now, in the under-caffeinated state of his brain, he couldn’t be completely sure what was real and what was not to begin with. So, apparently there was nothing to it — another dreary day to get started.
Sherlock scowled but had nothing to counter.
he wanted to talk about. Then again, were they the same 'things' John meant? He didn't want to assume and he didn't want to show his cards. Showing one's cards was a sure way to lose the game.
“Please, Sherlock, give yourself this chance to try. Don’t deny yourself. Don’t hurt yourself. If not for yourself, at least do it for me.” John said quietly. The words floating in the back and forth of air wavering in the cocoon they formed. “Let me in. Show me.” He looked up without losing the contact, the angle awkward, the distance too short, but it was everything he needed. Sherlock’s mesmerising eyes were already looking back at him, his open and vulnerable gaze resting on his face.
God, that girl was tall. All long limbs and slender body, heightened by the ridiculous high heels.
“Yes, but you realise you could also go south, right?” Scott deadpanned and John jolted from his seat, frantically searching for any sign that would show if he was indeed on the right train. Until he heard the quiet deep chuckle on the other end of the line.
He had expected it at some point. It had all been too good to be true. He ended the call with Greg and waited for the return of his most probably disgruntled partner.
After a while, John had to lower his heels back to the floor, which broke the kiss and gave them the opportunity to get some dearly needed air. Both panting, their gazes locked, John could feel the mutual agreement; they were in this together. No need for caution, no need for anxious mood swings. No need for doubts the other would change his mind. Together meant… well… together. As one. Sharing their lives, not hiding.
the stage.
"Ciao, Captain." he chirped.
Silently he added: “We should stop fighting the inevitable. Spare us all the troubles. It’s not worth it.”
“Sherlock. What have you done, you silly boy?”
A little whitish roll lying under the sofa caught his eye. He frowned, leaned forward and crawled over until he could reach under the sofa to fish out the little object. His back and shoulders ached when he stretched his arm to reach it. Poking at it with his fingertips he rolled it slowly forward and grabbed it as soon as it was within reach.
"Charming," he huffed, but Sherlock ignored it.
Forgive me? For what? For cutting yourself off of me? Why would I? For failing to cut yourself? Why ever would I?
John thought terrified. '
And with it the room around him changed shape, shelves full of memories appeared, paper snippets floating through the air.
"Christ, Sherlock…"
Sherlock pulled off the soiled sheets and then laid out his costume on the mattress. Seeing Sherlock handling all the lace and velvet and leather, made John's pulse speed up in joyous anticipation. But Sherlock also pulled a box from the depths of his cupboard John had never seen before. John frowned and walked over to him.
This time he hadn't been late. He had been there to catch him.
A smaller curtain in the background was raised with a swish and a in a cloud of fumes and mist a figure was hiding in the shadows. A slow deep humming music started playing, the creaking of ropes and masts. In the background, the person waiting, not moving.
“I won’t let anyone get to you, honey. Do you hear?
“I’m glad we agree on clarity, John. That’s... all I wanted actually. Sorry, you know I’m not good with words.”
John startled when in this moment his Pirate-non-pirate jumped from the roof, all grace and ease, coat billowing behind them, and landed at John’s feet. Raising to their full height and needlessly, teasingly ruffled their hair, they said in a low voice, holding John's gaze: “No. Consulting detective. The only one in the world. I invented the job.” And when John failed to answer, just staring, they added: “And very much male, if you wondered.”
Reaching one corner he proceeded to big long leaps alternating with fast turns in a big circle, trying to take over the whole room, owning it all, leaving no space for anything else. Just him, just the music, just his movements. Feeling all the power reigning his muscles.

conversation at all. Greg thought that the email from Sherlock was 'talking’? John himself hadn't seen it in this light, yet. After all, the last time John had actually talked to Sherlock face to face was almost a week ago.
He regained his courage and opened the door, entering the hallway and being grateful that Mrs Hudson didn’t bother to greet him.
While watching Sherlock with piercing eyes, John took hold of Sherlock's hands, eased them from his hips and guided them around himself, leaving them resting low on the small of his back.
“As I said before, if you paid attention, it would be preferable, if the situation wouldn’t be reversed in any sort of way… so what I actually want to express is, don’t move out, but
"Could be dangerous." Scott practically purred, voice almost as dark as the topic they were talking about. It sent icy tingles down John's back, although not from dread as it should be, but from excitement. John inhaled sharply. Something was seriously wrong with him. He swallowed.
in the spirit of ‘no more assuming’
"No-one. Not important. Work." Mycroft answered, mimicking Sherlock's earlier response. Making clear that he knew. Both men watching each other, scanning, evaluating. Sherlock could see right through him, Mycroft had never been good at lying to Sherlock. Sherlock swallowed. Paled.
“And you love it.” John smirked.

“He’s…” he swallowed against the raising feeling of being sucked into a maelstrom, “... he’s coming over here, Molly.” he said under his breath. Molly’s face lit up with relief and euphory.

But for now there was nothing left for him to do than stare. He could hardly walk up to Sherlock when he was standing there, coming out of nowhere, half-naked… no, nononono. No… he couldn't even think that, no! When he wasn't properly dressed, apparently not expecting anyone. He couldn’t say all those words, when they had never before come even remotely close to this sort of subject. When he didn’t even know what Sherlock thought… wanted… felt. Suddenly he had to think about the vow he had made to himself. He couldn’t let this chance slip… not again. But how could he knowingly risk the tiny chance he was given just now. By accident. By coincidence. By sheer and utter luck. How was he supposed to take that risk? But he had to. He knew it. If
Today better known as the 21 gun salute it originally had been a sign of surrender/truce, when a war ship wanted to enter a foreign or enemy port. As a sign of truce they'd fire their guns to show that the guns were not loaded, thus they'd enter the port disarmed and without hostile intentions. As a sign of acceptance the opposite party on shore would clear their arms as well, so that the entering crew would know they were safe to approach the port.

"Why would you?"
“Then what?” John asked, puzzled. It was true, John hadn’t seen the chemist in action since that memorable Bad Hair Day.
“That obvious, am I?” He said weakly and glanced at Greg out of the corner of his eye.
He realised that he couldn’t avoid taking care of the lower regions of Sherlock’s body any longer. Immediately, he regretted his former administrations when he came face to face with Sherlock’s deeply flushed, desperately hard and already leaking erection the moment he knelt in front of him. His mouth watered and he leaned forward to run his nose along the crease of Sherlock’s groin. He inhaled deeply and his beard covered cheeks scratched along Sherlock’s cock and made it twitch.
Sherlock wanted nothing more than to forget him. And apparently he had.
,” Encouraged by Sherlock’s responsiveness John ran his thumbs over Sherlock’s nipples, circling them, felt the tingling of the hardening nubs under his own sensitive skin. The sharp inhale through Sherlock’s parted lips, sent a buzz through John’s body, causing a tension that had nothing to do with the former hesitation, but all with restrained impatience and want.
"Yeah, you know? That scruffy flat that means hope and refuge when life gets too strange or frightening? Where those two men use to sit arguing like they've always been there?" John was still smiling and holding out his hand. "They always will, Sherlock!"
, thought Sherlock.
With that he steered an even more confused Greg back out on the streets again. In his coat pocket the folded piece of paper Molly had handed him earlier. He tried to hide his mixed feelings behind a mask of indifference while going back to trudging next to Greg without actually feeling like it.
“I’ll just call Mycroft.”
"You're late." It sounded like a moping five-year-old.
"What do you think you're doing?" John whispered into her face.
He remembered his usual repertoire of dirt and dust and danger, gunfire and death. There had also been your customary amount of dread and agony. However, last night there had also been a fair bit of irritation mixed into the dreamy blend of abominations. Irritation about an annoyed voice, which kept undermining and weakening his well nurtured habit of suffering.
"So, that's what you're going for?" John tried to handle all this weirdness as stoically as his soldier self expected him to do.
“Unscared skin, on the pale side it’s said,” Scott began after a moment, more quiet now, his breathing evident in each word. John held his, impatient to finally learn more about his mystery guy. “On top we start with the claviculae, rather sharply pronounced due to minimal fatty tissue…” Scott continued, almost murmured under his breath, although clearly audible for John, as if spoken close to the speaker. It had something thrillingly intimate. “Same applies to the costae, I’m afraid they’re quite visible at the flanks. If your… fingers…” Scott swallowed audibly, “would continue in the direction of the sternum however, there would be, I dare say, noticeable pectoralis muscles covering them.”
Sherlock stopped reading here. Everything was said. Everything was heard. He felt the need to actually hear it and searched for the song to listen to it.
"See…" now they were getting there. John needed to understand. It hurt. God, did it hurt. But it needed to be done.
"Sentiment." Sherlock rolled his eyes, but the effect was ruined by the fond smirk playing around his lips.
John’s, despite everything, throbbing cock in his hand agreed, apparently just as impatient as the guy on the other end of the line. God, he had never felt this turned on by mere talk, especially with talk this far from sexy. What was wrong with him?
Mrs Hudson's telly switched off, the groaning of the water pipes died down.
It only took two, three strokes for him to come as well with a deep grunt, covering Sherlock’s hand in a fair amount of come.
It seemed as if he didn’t know the man he had seen in there at all. How had Sherlock been able to hide something like this? Why had he hidden it in the first place? Why hadn’t he told John?
Slowly coming to his senses again, John realised what had just happened. Well, apart from incredibly sexy Sherlock in suspenders fucking him into oblivion in his chair which he'll never be able to look at again without getting a raging boner.
He had never thought that there’d come a time he’d miss someone else’s warmth lingering in the covers in the morning. Though, ‘miss’ wasn’t quite the right term as he’d never had someone warming his bed for longer than a couple of hours in the first place. The body warmth of other persons had always been a tad off-putting for him. Most of all in his own bed. He had always tried to avoid bringing people to his own place for sex. Of course he’d had sex. Sometimes including a bed, sometimes not. At good times to satisfy basic human desires, at bad times to ensure the supply to sate a different kind of craving. He had tried to delete that part of his history, but apparently he had done a poor job. The memories had come back full force after waking in that much too familiar place a couple of days ago and hadn’t left him since. Luckily they weren’t his only experiences. The more enjoyable ones, mainly from his young adult years, had stayed with him as well. They had outweighed the vileness and disgust he had gone through. They hadn’t erased it, but counterbalanced. He knew both ends of what sex could be like. Sex didn’t alarm him. He wasn’t intrigued or impressed by it. He was aware, he could estimate, he could judge and rationally decide if, when and what he needed. It wasn’t always bad. At uni he’d even had a permanent bed companion. It had held its advantages not to have to go through the initial rituals of ‘getting to know each other’ every single time. Also to have someone who knew the physical and sexual boundaries: what is welcome, what is wanted, the dos and don’ts. They’d had a good time, enjoyed each other's company during the day, enjoyed the sex at night and sometimes not at night. They’d been friends, one of the few Sherlock had made in his life. Thinking back, it might be called more than friends. Perhaps even a relationship, although it had never held any deep emotional attachment. They had liked each other, they were most definitely physically attracted to each other, but Sherlock had never missed Victor’s warmth in the morning when he had snuck out of the room again in the middle of the night.
“Ow!” Greg half serious rubbed his side. “I speak nothing but the truth! And you know it, Molls!” Greg defended himself, pouting.
"No." With a bit more force. Still shaking his head.
They continued their way in comfortable silence. They left the bridge behind, made their way into the delicately woven web of London's streets. Sherlock matched his steps to John's shorter ones and revelled in their closeness; in their shoulders bumping against each other while walking, his bare forearm brushing against the fabric of John's shirt, their legs sliding one against the other when they lost their rhythm for a moment… which barely happened. John had to bend his arm slightly upwards to be able to hold Sherlock's hand. Sherlock found that extremely cute, although he would never let the man know. If that was the reason that he held him a bit tighter, if he pulled him a tad closer, he didn't care because it was all fine and it was no-one's business but theirs.
All the air trapped in John’s lungs escaped in one rush, a laugh that made him almost choke on his own breath. His belly muscles started cramping and rippled his entire body with waves of complete helplessness. The deep chuckle seeping through the speaker didn’t help in the slightest and only elicited a new bout of breathless giggles.
Sherlock opened his eyes, suddenly very much aware of his surroundings. He straightened his spine, sat up so quickly that he got dizzy for a moment and clenched his phone in his fist.
But why would John need this volume and why the hell would he need to listen to the same song on repeat? This had to stop! Immediately! But how? Staring down the phone hadn’t worked, but Sherlock absolutely wouldn’t give in and go upstairs to beg for it! Never!
When they parted, something occurred to John. He frowned.
His worst fear crept up on him and made him shiver. John turning his back on him, mistrusting him… the one person who had said 'I know you're real' when everyone else had fallen for Moriarty's mind games… the one person who had said 'You could' when Sherlock had convinced everyone else that he was fake… the one person who mattered. He couldn’t allow this to happen!
“No, John,” Sherlock chuckled a bit sadly, “you don’t understand. You didn't know me before; the me before you.” For a short moment Sherlock’s face seemed to relax and a tender expression took over. When he spoke again it was less sombre but still very earnestly. “I really was that sociopath I claimed to be when I met you.”
“Just… don’t you dare disappear on me, alright?” John added without any hint of annoyance, just his affectionate, slightly teasing and
“No.” John whispered, not able to think of anything in this moment, when they moved closer. “And actually it’s Doctor.” He didn’t know where this was coming from. “Doctor John Watson.” he murmured the moment the soft lips of this absolutely intoxicating man covered his own in a daring and passionate kiss.
and if you want a no-show for your cock but don't want to tuck either, something like this might be your friend:
He couldn't believe his luck that, after everything, they were still this. They were still them—completely bonkers, them. Good God, he loved this man. Not able to hold back any longer he got up, circled the desk to cradle Sherlock's face in both his hands, lean down and pull him into a deep tender kiss. With difficulties he pulled away from those addictive lips and looked at his friend, his partner. In the truest sense of the word: his other half.
"So, what were you two up to then?" John asked. "No saucy details, please!" He winked at Molly. She blushed furiously and her eyes widened.
He felt the weight lift from his lap, feeling the loss of their weight and warmth painfully and the cold empty air taking its place felt like a punch in his gut.
“Why else would you just ‘end up’ somewhere late at night?” There was a confused uptilt in his voice, but somehow he seemed rather intrigued than averse.
you are anyway…"
“I never had a serious relationship before. Never cared for anyone this way.” He willed John to understand, hoped he had said enough.
Sherlock heard John puff his breath out through his nose, the way he always did when he decided to go into battle, when he was on a mission.
Holding Mycroft's gaze John nodded shortly,  thin lips pressed tightly together, and turned on his heels. Huffing a breath he squared his shoulders, tugged the seam of his coat down. Into battle.

Even though a lot of it looked familiar, as any other of the standard and interchangeable clubs, the stage here was bigger—a narrow catwalk led from the backstage area to a circular stage in the middle of the club, which allowed a free view from all sides. There were several sort of pointy extensions, not unlike the catwalk, spreading from the stage into the room like crooked fingers. It divided the audience area into different sections, furnished with chairs with small tables or low platforms with comfy looking sofas to lounge in. From there, the stage and its tentacles were freely approachable which left no angles to hide anything by well timed moves. John swallowed. He hoped Miss Pirate was aware of this and had taken it into account. John's hackles rose. He didn't like this one bit!
?" Miss Pirate narrowed her eyes, the dark lines around her beautiful eyes almost met and only enhanced the fierceness of her gaze. John almost flinched back from her, but just
He cleared his throat and tried to concentrate on the supplies he had gathered in the kitchen. A bowl with warm water in one of his hands, some disposable cloths and one of their blunt butter knives huddled in the other and a bottle of olive oil clenched under his arm. There was work to be done.
John felt lost. He didn’t get it. Sherlock wanted to tell him something, and he didn’t get it. He studied Sherlock desperately. Sherlock lowered his face, mere inches away from John’s. Shaking him slightly.
he scolded himself, but his mind self cleared its imaginary throat.
together…they never have been together that way, so they couldn’t be back to it! Right? Obviously! And considering the amount of time spent in their shared living arrangement in comparison to the period of separation in relation to the overall duration of their… friendship, it was questionable if it could even be considered 'being back'. That would imply a vast amount of time in a permanent arrangement to even come back to. So, maybe it would be more appropriate to say… since he moved in again.
Maybe
“John is the most common name in Britain since the 16th century and was given to more than two million people since civil records were established. I should have guessed that a man with your trust issues wouldn’t reveal such an intimate fact to a random stranger and would settle on a misleading and ordinary and bleak alias even though it’s obvious and beyond doubt that you of all people wouldn’t be given such an unremarkable name.”
Sherlock only nodded, John leaned in to give him a tiny peck on the top of his nose and got to work.
A quick hop into the shower, a quick wash, paying some thorough attention to his genitals… Jeez… Scott!! Fuck off!!
“Everything, huh?” John couldn't hold back, smirking. He sensed that it took Scott a second to catch up. Then the man cleared his throat.
"Sherlock," Mycroft tried again sternly. "Setting up an entirely new and, by request if I might remind you, untraceable identity takes time."
“Double standards, huh?” John couldn’t hide his disappointment.
Still mortified about the extent his anger and jealousy had engulfed him beyond any rhyme and reason, John cringed and grimaced.
John was being silly. Sherlock wasn't the one losing his abilities to deduce. It really wasn't a nice move of John to mock him. Sherlock was a bit annoyed. He only wanted to help here. Apparently, John didn't take this seriously enough.
Out of his depth for once, Sherlock opened his browser again and typed into the google search bar, feeling very silly about doing so: ‘whose life to save?’
"Did you… mean it this time?"
“Take it off.” Sherlock said in a flat but unmistakably demanding voice. John’s head snapped up, he looked at Sherlock eyes wide.
He hadn't heard someone coming up the stairs. He hadn't expected anyone
Was he flirting? He was flirting, right? It wasn't just a figment of John's imagination, was it? No wishful thinking… John swallowed. When he spoke his voice was a bit croaky.
Aside from the awkward… no, that might not be exactly the correct term to describe that encounter… the unexpected surprise of… for fucks sake, what was wrong with him… wasn't it exactly the
“”Listen… Apparently Moriarty’s organisation is even bigger than expected. Well, unexpected for everyone but me maybe…” he muttered.
“Okay, then. What about this?” he cleared his throat, “I’ll start.” and immediately he felt Sherlock’s relief about being released from the duty of kicking off their conversation. Good, for now. Maybe Sherlock would ease into the conversation over time.
It took John a moment to remind his body that it needed oxygen, but when Breathing 2.0 had rebooted he whispered, "Sherlock?"
"Hearts and all?" Sherlock asked, whispered.
His eyes stuck to a small stack of pictures which was lying on top of it. He picked it up tenderly and immediately memories floated back to one of the happiest times of his life. There was a picture of his youth, he saw himself in swimming trunks, sun bleached hair, smiling into the camera. Next to him Harry circling her arm around the waist of the girl next to her. A sharp pang of pain pierced his heart at the sight of the next one. Upside down, dark hair, blues eyes, gazing intensely right into the camera. They'd been on holidays in France, the first and the last time, it had been glorious. Even though the memories of the aftermath of said holidays weren't exactly glorious at all. When John's parents, most of all his father had found out that Harry's friend wasn't only just her friend but that they had been on the brink of moving in together, live together, love each other, the hell had been breaking loose. Harry had then moved out indeed... and never came back after. She had cut all contact with John too, when she had realised that John hadn't mentioned the boy he had met there with a single word. He hadn't dared to confess the kisses, the shared cigarettes, the night swimming to his father. And with that it was as if it had never happened. He'd never seen the boy again. Harry had felt betrayed by John. He had also betrayed himself back then and he had ever since.
In the meanwhile the hand had reached the waistband of his jeans, hastily unhooking his belt, flipping open the button and lowering the zip with relish.
Shaking her head a little she had finally turned around and left. John had been left behind, speechless. Yes, he knew he had been an idiot not to realise who Mary really was. Yes, he had been an idiot, too slow to prevent
“Same thing in this case!” John laughed. “Christ, Sherlock! Really, that was…” There were still shivers running up and down his spine at the mere thought of it. Wanking material for the next century!
With these thoughts in mind John dozed off, still fully clothed, lying on his belly across his bed on top of the duvet. He wasn’t aware of the music still droning on from his phone. At some point he had set the song on repeat, trying to listen to it more closely. He didn’t get the chance to turn it off though, that’s why the song kept blurting over and over until the battery of his phone died. The quiet surrounded him like a blanket and carried him deeper into his sleep. Drained by his own emotions, oblivious to his surroundings, not caring about anything. Rejecting the new morning and the day to come. Not wanting them to be an option, let alone an unstoppable reality, because he had to face the man who was causing all his misery.
While hurrying away Sherlock shouted over his shoulder, “Keep up, John! Suddenly I have the urge to go home and have... dinner! With you!”
"Without asking!"
He felt a pang of regret.
It didn’t ease the pain he felt on Sherlock’s behalf… on his own behalf… in the slightest.
"I think I could be tempted to give it a try. With you." Scott admitted sheepishly.
John thought,
"I know. That's true. And it's certainly not forgotten." There it was. Although it sounded strangely calm, no anger, not the usual resentment this subject never failed to cause. "And we sure as hell have to talk about it. At some point. As we have to about a lot of other things."
place.” He wasn’t able to hide his aversion to that term.
I refuse to make a list. -SH
“Me?” That came out much too high-pitched for his own liking.
"Sherlock… I…
Overall, whatever they were up to, Sherlock seemed to be brimming from energy and excitement. John on the contrary didn't get the impression they made any progress at all. He also didn’t see much difference regarding the spicing up part—not the way Sherlock had implied at least; no danger beyond the usual at the horizon. The only thing that might hint at an underlying threat was Sherlock sometimes asking him to be particularly careful or to keep an eye out or not to mention this or that during his conversations.
"That was... Wow. Correct on all accounts." John was at a loss for words.
John swallowed, not sure how to convince Sherlock that he was wrong. With all of it. But this wasn’t the moment. Sherlock wouldn’t accept any of it. Sherlock would refuse anything John had to say. When Sherlock spoke again he sounded small, defeated, insecure.
didn't need to be said.
He had told Sherlock that he loved him; that he'd give everything, do everything to make a relationship between them work; that he knew and accepted Sherlock's flaws, that he wasn't himself without Sherlock; that Sherlock couldn't do anything to ruin it; that John would stay at his side no matter what crossed their path.
"Yes , I’ve been told..." he sounded a bit distant now. Probably, he was used to that sort of acknowledgement.
He was restlessly pacing the living room of 221B. Occasionally interrupted by Mrs Hudson's fussing.
“You wouldn’t have invaded Afghanistan either without proper training in the army, would you, Captain?” Scott said, sounding sulky.
“Yeah, right, it never is…” With a disdainful glare she scanned him from top to toe before she hooked her arm with Sherlock’s and pulled him along. “Come on, love, you’re late. Time to prepare yourself.”
“So?”
Most of all, did it make sense to be slightly happy about this call anyway and cling to a small "for now" as to a lifeline. No, it didn't make sense. Not at all. But here he was. In a life that didn't make sense anymore. And wasn't that the most terrifying thing?
been on my own.”
“Oh, fuck it.” John growled.
Did time still exist?
"Mycroft?" Sherlock spat and glared at John. He was lost, it was as if he and Sherlock weren't talking about the same thing, as if they had lived in parallel universes. "Why Mycroft? When did you talk with Mycroft?" Sherlock inquired confused. Angered?
Ignoring it, was most definitely no long term option. It was standing between them like the proverbial elephant in the room. Only this specimen was more the size of a mammoth. Standing in their way, leaving them no possibility to move. This way they were not able to take any step forward, but there was no way back either. He couldn’t believe this was a state Sherlock would be willing to live in. Staying. Just staying… boring. So something had to be done about it and John was determined to do so.
Sherlock’s hand closed around their joint ones. Sherlock’s eyes were fixed on them—Sherlock holding John holding Sherlock—watching full of wonder. Their forearms were leaning against each other this way. Tension was slowly seeping out of their muscles, trusting the steady construction of support. John observed in awe how the unwinding meandered from Sherlock’s arms over his shoulders and spread from there down over chest and between his shoulder blades and up over his neck then jaw then his whole face. Sherlock sucked in a deep breath, as if finally being able to, and closed his eyes; his face as relaxed as John had ever seen it. Sherlock dipped his head and let it sink forward to lean his forehead on the tangle of their hands.
Holding his breath, he felt his heart hammering furiously in his chest. He wouldn’t be surprised if they would be able to hear it all the way across the hall. He tried to willingly calm it, but without the possibility to take deep breaths, his stupid heart wouldn’t listen. He felt a panic attack bubble up.
What was Sherlock anyway? Saint? Surely not? Sinner? In all the ways possible.
"You'll never get what you want!" he heard Sherlock say and peered around the corner, trying to estimate the perfect moment and the urgency to step in.
John swallowed, at a loss for words. What was it that he had wanted to say? He honestly didn't know. He cleared his throat a bit uncomfortably.
Taking full control now, John shifted slightly to align their bodies and changed the angle to deepen the kiss.
He gave up his attempts to remember for the moment as even his brain seemed to need food.
“No, not precisely. From your video I was luckily able to rule out some places and concluded that you most likely stayed at a friend's… a
"The beard." John huffed. "The beard itself, Sherlock. Don't you think it won us both over?"
"No need to get protective, mate. Guess she's had enough dicks between her legs to be used to it by now, yeah?" the man raised his hands apologetically. But John wasn't calmed in the slightest.
John had seemed lost and hadn’t known how to answer and neither had Sherlock.
The thoughts kept whirling and nothing had meaning anymore. He couldn't make sense of anything actually… Sherlock jumping, John struggling through is grief, Mary appearing, Sherlock coming back, John marrying that wife – good god- her shooting Sherlock, his fear, his anger, his confusion… and now this mess of his friendship with Sherlock…
“What happened to your other mascara?” he asked weakly.
“You really are a fucking moron, John Watson!” Greg shook his head and slumbed angrily against the backrest. John had to agree, he probably was, but what did it matter anyway.
Sherlock let out a shuddering breath, not even knowing what he had expected or hoped for. Although he couldn’t deny that it hurt to see John walk away. He didn't know if any other outcome would have hurt less, but this one sure as hell did.
He cleared his throat, suddenly uncomfortable. This wasn't anywhere near as anonymous anymore as he had hoped it to be. On the contrary, this Scott bloke had seen him in a way not many people had in the recent past. Or ever. However, the guy didn't know John's name or anything else that could reveal crucial data about his identity, so he should be safe, right? Even more so, this was merely meant to be an experiment anyway. Nothing to lose...
“Yeah, right. I’m sorry. Go on.” John said apologetically.
"Nope. Won't let anyone else suck you!" John laugh-growled, looking down at Sherlock who grinned back at him.
"Don't worry, John. It doesn't bother me. So it shouldn't bother you. For my part let him be happy with it; as long as he stays away from you. From us. Maybe it's good this chapter is closed and we start writing our own story. Together."
In silent agreement they refrained from taking a cab even though it meant a walk of an hour to get back. It would give them time to adjust to the new situation. Sherlock wanted nothing more than to have John back at 221B, at the same time he was nervous. What would it mean to come home as more than just friends? How much more than friends were they now? Were there expectations? Or rules on how to behave? Did John have expectations? They hadn't particularly defined their status, they hadn't even clearly vocalised it yet. Was it what Sherlock thought it was and wanted it to be? What if John didn't mean it the way Sherlock thought he did? What if…
lived! The whole time Sherlock had been dead. He had even moved on to live a life without Sherlock in it. Had Sherlock not come back, what would have happened? Maybe John would even have forgotten Sherlock…
She waited a short moment for any reaction then she raised her hands, moving slowly, hesitantly, expecting rejection?
"You saved me, Sherlock Holmes. Just accept that fact." he said over the lyrics.
"..."
John felt his throat constrict and fought the tears welling up, because seriously, he had been in the Army, right? And… and… he was a British man whose uppermost rule was not to show emotions and damn… there went the first unruly tear. Was there really no-one and nothing obeying his orders anymore? To make it all worse, Sherlock reached over and wiped the tear away with his thumb.
“No… you can’ be Jjjohn. Becaus’ tha’s meee.” He giggled. “I think…”
“No. Unfortunately not.” Sherlock rolled onto his back and crossed his arms under his head, staring at the ceiling.
Okay, not aware after all then. John didn’t wait for an answer from his “mate” and soldiered on to conquer the stairs. The bedroom door banged shut, the bedsprings creaked, the flat was silent.
Shoulders sagged.
Although… once he had read or heard somewhere that earworms would stop if one listened to the song again, satisfying the brain's craving for it. Maybe it was like being cured from a glorifying memory of a holiday location by visiting it again, realising it actually wasn't that great after all. Perhaps he should give it a try. Call the hotline again that was. Although... not at 10 in the morning covered in the evidence of his earworm-obsession and with breath smelling of dead sparrows. Not that Scott would be aware of any of this. Still, it would have to wait until it was an appropriate call-a-sex-hotline-time. If such a thing existed…
"What…" John felt the dread and terror creep through his veins.
“Yeah, guess that’s true.” John tilted his head. “It really can be hurtful to speak up. For yourself. And the other.” he nodded, contemplating. “But actually, they also say that it’s even more damaging to keep them inside, right? It’s true that the shadows sometimes win, no?”
John swallowed. Well,
in the eye again? Well, at least the man wasn’t aware of his role in yesterday’s illustrious pub-talk.
Also simultaneously the three-taps stopped abruptly while Greg cheered: "Hey old groundhog, are you finally awak…" and faltered.
"None of
Support their needs and blablabla surely didn't mean to mollycoddle the victims of amnesia? John could at least do his best to be
Looking very pleased with himself, he tapped *
"What?" he sputtered.
"After our little argument in the corridor of the club—you gave a pretty good show there by the way—I noticed some fellows I've seen before a few times watching with interest."
“What’s it to you?” John was a bit irritated now. However, if he was honest, he was actually rather out of his depth and confused; mostly about himself. Somehow he felt stripped bare by this man — and not in the way intended by this call. And somehow — for a reason unknown — he didn’t mind.
Seconds felt like minutes felt like hours felt like eternity before John noticed the sound through the ringing in his ears.
didn't want to risk misunderstandings! Why…?" He realised that he almost sounded frantic.
Sherlock lowered his eyes, looked like a child awaiting punishment. John took a deep breath; tried to calm down. It wouldn’t help one bit if they argued now.
“I am… I was… it's complicated.” John sighed.
"Breasts." Sherlock made clear.
When he was finally back in his body, when he finally was aware of his surroundings again, he felt a tear tickle down his cheek.
Now John was even more at a loss than before.
John sounded determined but insecure.
John didn’t know where this was going, so he answered hesitantly: “Yes,” the question mark at the end clearly sensable.
“That much I had figured out myself, and also that he had taken a special liking to me. Obviously. Also, that he was behind what happened to some of my fellow dancers. Some were gone for days, turned up again bodily unharmed but frightened to death, not one of them dared to say a word about what had happened to them. Those who let slip the tiniest hint ended up dead and were found in the weirdest places—abandoned factories, on the shore, in a car in a car park. I didn’t find a connection back then…” Sherlock trailed off, frustration evident in his voice. “I thought there must be clues, that it would lead me somewhere, but he was always a step ahead, never got a grip on him. Now he confessed that it was all just a great game for him. Misleading me, making use of my, what he calls a weakness, that I always want everything to be clever.” He sighed. “It was his way to make me dance when he had no other possibility to do so because I refused to work for anyone but myself.”
That was true. John knew it was true. However, he had to shake himself out of his pondering and sort his mind to be able to keep up with the direction the conversation was heading for. It was hard to be honest, but that was the only way if they wanted to solve this mess. He cleared his throat.
He was standing at the window again. Observed the long shadows, only the rooftops still bathed in sunlight, people now wearing cardigans or light jumpers. Mrs Hudson watching one of her pre prime time series. The smell of something oven baked hanging in the air. How long had they been on the phone? It hadn't felt that long. But then, time never felt long when spent with John Watson. Actually, it never felt long enough.
And more so, any less of a show would have made it less believable; as contradictory as that sounded. Sherlock had to see the ease, to understand the serenity with which John was conveying the message. It wouldn't serve the purpose if he'd try another serious attempt to explain, to convince, to permeate the intricate windings of that silly old brain. They'd never get rid of the graveness that lay heavy on this fragile beginning like a thick layer of snow over the first frail sprouts at the end of winter. That wasn't like them. They'd never been icy; that was more the speciality of other parts of the Holmes' family. They were more like the chaotic weather in April; back and forth between sunshine and rain and hail and storm and warmth. As unpredictable as it was, as nurturing it was also.
“Only one more thing, but I really do need your opinion for that. Don’t dawdle, John.” And off he was again.
"I called them first. They were already on their way." With that he released John's hands shortly to turn him around and push his back against the surface; only to immediately grab his wrists again and hold them above John's head.
"No need to rush me!"
John's hands clenched into fists at his side, fighting the urge to grab the infuriating creature in front of him by her shoulders and shake her; ask her what game she was playing; if she
As expected, he found his big brother residing behind his unduly pompous bureau. As always he was dressed in his impeccable bespoke three-piece suit, his never missing umbrella resting at his side. Apparently, he was already awaiting Sherlock.
“That will never ever happen. I won’t let him. I won’t allow anyone to harm you or take you away from me! Never, Sherlock! They’ll get a proper dose of Captain Watson! I’ll throw them from the next cliff!” He growled and held Sherlock's gaze, squeezing his hands to underline the sincerity of his intentions.
“Okay then…” Scott sounded amused. Why the fuck was he amused? How dare he? “What was the last thing you did before calling me?”
"You really didn't know." almost breathless. "I wanted to tell you. At the park. But you left and I couldn't… Why did you leave, Sherlock? Why did you leave me behind? You promised!" all said in a rush, faster and faster. Then a break, shaky inhale, "You… promised, Sherlock."
Sherlock directly strode into the living room; John could hear him agitatedly pacing on the rug. He himself took his time to get rid of shoes and jacket, to feel more comfy, to feel more like being home. And, to be honest, to gain some time.
Crawling back onto the stage—because… of course she would; John almost rolled his eyes—Miss Pirate gave some attention to the dance pole again. Although, this time she was only leaning her back against it, letting her head fall back as if being tired and taking a break. Her legs, bent und propped up on the heels one after the other, told a different story though. John narrowed his eyes; what was next? After everything he had witnessed this night, he was becoming slightly suspicious.
Memories flashed back with every new and oh so painful familiar note… John could almost feel himself again sitting slouched down in his armchair, bare feet, staring into the void… again and again replaying in his mind that moment he had screamed “Sherlock!” up to the man standing on that roof, seeing him fall in slow motion, running towards him as if he were able to catch him, rescue him, hold him, make everything alright….
It didn’t take long though until a fuming John Watson stomped out of the bathroom anyway despite Sherlock’s efforts. After having endured Sherlock’s meticulous instructions and his complaining about John’s lack of technique, it was Sherlock shouting abuse at John for ripping off the strip — as instructed by the way — that was the straw that broke the camel’s back.
Sherlock cleared his throat.
of who you are, you massive idiot genius detective! I don't care what others say. I'm finally free, made my very own choice. And it's the best fucking thing I've ever done!" He smiled and it was genuine happiness sparkling in his eyes.
“Then why…,” the detective breathed.
“Uhm… don’t know… let me think for a moment,” Greg said in mock contemplation, the cloud of fury nearly palpable around him. “Maybe, for a starter, that he’s a fucking idiot. Or… you could have kicked his arse and told him that he’s talking bullshit! What about telling him that
Sherlock swallowed, nodded.
"Yes." Sherlock didn't even know what he was confirming. Probably the smile he imagined on John Watson's face. Or the gleam in John's eyes he knew was there. Or the tingling that got hold of his whole body. Or the tiny shiny undeniable trace of relief that wormed its way inside his heart. He'd see John again. The only remaining problem now was—how would he survive it?
"Gavin is a spoilsport." he pouted.
The sitting area became more and more crowded and there was some hustle around the stage. After a moment a low ting seemed to announce something, the music faded and the lights dimmed. All eyes turned to the stage and John had to admit that he too watched with some curious anticipation.
“First of all, I didn’t spy on you,” John had to force himself to sound serious as the adoration he felt for the man in front of him constantly threatened to make him grin broadly. “And no, it wasn’t only twice.” he stated.
All he cared about was how he could get out as soon as possible without attracting any attention. Which would be a challenge with his rumpled shirt, messed up hair, burning cheeks, and ragged breathing anyway. Wouldn't there also be the difficulty to walk with a raging boner like he had never experienced before in his life currently hiding in his much too tight denims.
“Yeah, great,” John interrupted him impatiently, not listening at all. “You know where he is now?”
The detective taking advantage of his reaction pushed desperately into John’s willing mouth. John melted at the feeling of the hot tongue sliding against his own, caressing and exploring every single bit of John's mouth it could reach. John’s body tingled, he tried to breath, desperate to sense and value every single second of this moment. But he was swept away by the force that was this man, that was the pleasure and heat he was experiencing. He tried to gasp for air but he was drowning, drowning in his own feelings, drowning in the moment - he wished to never surface again if it meant for this to be over.
Why was all this so complicated? He had always been of the opinion that it all was nothing but simple chemistry. If that would be true he had found a solution long ago. Literally…
"No, you'd better not." John whispered, looking up at Sherlock who had reached him by now. He towered over him, tilting his head and watching him as if contemplating something.
“Of course I have,” he reached into his breast pocket and pulled Sherlock’s phone out. It was warmed by his own body heat.
"Hero?" John hissed, from irritation and stimulation. "If not for me…" he panted, "All Lestrade and his... team would have found... were... our cold corpses. I called them just in time."
As the realisation sank in, the buzz of the happy amusement turned into a flood of gratitude which moistened his eyes. He blinked several times and swallowed to get the knot out of his throat so he could continue what he had started.
to… Yeah, that's it."
"No reason." Mycroft said in the end.
How on earth could Sherlock look this sensual, this tantalizing?
Quite a while after they had settled again and enjoyed the regained comfort between them, John suddenly froze; the fingers that had run through Sherlock's hair still buried in the ruffled mess of curls.
“You don’t think I was born knowing how to dance like this, do you?” Sherlock told his window.
Good luck for you two!!! We’re all rooting for you! <3<3<3
"John, aren't you feeling well?"
! You do have to find a different way to get what you want!" John shouted.
He dumped his bag in a corner, carefully placing the violin case on top of it. He then closed the curtains. He didn't want to be watched, not even by the sun, or the bee, or anything or anyone else who wasn't himself. Actually he didn't even want to be here himself, but it couldn't be helped. He couldn't hide from himself. As much as he would like to.
“Uhm… Sherlock… you alright?” John asked hesitantly. “If this smells weird or something, I can go stand elsewhere to eat or… dunno…” He trailed of because actually he had no idea what was wrong. He would definitely NOT bin it now that he had finally gathered something at least likely nourishing just because Mr. Fancy-Food disliked it.
"Fuck, Scott… I…" John pleaded desperately. Both hands occupied now, it was pure luck the phone stayed in place.
Rather the opposite actually. Hastily, clumsily, Sherlock fumbled with the  button of John's denims between their bodies, a low groan reflecting his frustration at the discovery of more buttons in place of a zipper.
John had expected to maybe discover a new one of Sherlock’s boltholes. Or maybe that Sherlock would retreat to the morgue to torture some poor corpse in frustration. For a shocking moment he had even feared to witness Sherlock buying drugs from some sort of old-buddy-dealer.
"I should have known…," John whispered exasperated, "... how to save a life after all."
“Like what?”
This felt familiar, this felt safe, this was his duty. Having Sherlock's back.
"No!" John said forcefully and dropped the phone between them to have both hands free to grab Sherlock's face, to force him to look at him. "No, not the point. Listen to me, alright? Just… listen. What I wanted to say is, when I thought I'd lost you again I realised the only thing I wished for was to have another chance, to make it up to you. I wanted a chance to prove myself, to show you how much you mean to me." His heart pounded fiercely in his chest. Why was this so insanely difficult? He even felt his hands tremble; Sherlock took hold of his wrists and lowered their arms to rest on his lap. On the way down he pressed a kiss on each of John's palms and then covered it with his own hand. A kiss held close and safe.
“What do you mean, ‘yet’?” John frowned. “Didn’t you solve the case?”
“Nope!” Sherlock grinned.
"John, I really don't know why you, always proudly proclaiming to be a doctor, would be uncomfortable handling my genitals, most of all considering all the other things you don't seem to mind doing to and with my body. You do realise that you just a moment ago immensely enjoyed letting your
With each and every memory the strain around John’s heart intensified, like a chain being tightened bit by bit until his heart felt wrung out and bloodless.
“Oi, what’s wrong with my name? What do you mean ‘of course’? Don’t tell me you guessed that one as well...” John reacted, offended.
! One could also fall in love, although that was mostly hurtful in itself. Falling. The fall. Following him everywhere. In the end, he was always coming back to it in his mind. Like the never-ending circle of the come and go of the seasons, year after year inevitably withstanding the storms of autumn... of the fall. No escape.
“On you go then, I don’t want to stand between you and happiness.” He said.
He pressed play and immediately paused it again. He took John’s hand and gently opened his clenched fist. John hadn’t even realised how his body had reacted to the distress of hearing Sherlock so nonchalantly talking about the horrid time away that had almost broken both of them. Sherlock carefully laid his phone in John’s hand, closed John’s fingers around it and swallowed.
“Well… that was Molly explaining to you where you should or shouldn't put your fingers.” John giggled.
"What?" John shouted, as far as that was possible in his wedged-like-a-sardine-in-a-tin-state. "I thought you liked my beard!" As punishment he only intensified his efforts, reveling in the sniggering and wiggling it caused.
“We?” John asked with a curious tingling in his belly, stepping inside his flat. How was this the only thing standing out to John? Limp? Undeniable. Psychosomatic? Probably. But… We?
Sherlock knew. He had done it.
"What do you mean 'you walked this way' this morning?" he looked questioningly at John. The man seemed puzzled himself before realisation brightened his features.
“I’m terribly sorry, if this doesn’t meet your sex hotline client standards.” John hissed, dripping with sarcasm, and only afterwards noticed some interested glances thrown his way. Fantastic, so much for keeping it decent…
"I can't believe that Mycroft didn't…" the same small whisper.
“Sherlock, listen… Why are you doing this? Why are you trying to find something to scare me away?” A deep crease formed on his forehead. “I won’t, okay? I won’t leave. I won’t run to Greg, crying. I won’t run from idiots calling me names.” He shook his head slowly; a man out of his depth. “What are you afraid of? What kind of man do you think I am, Sherlock? Why would you think I’d leave?”
“What, dear?” Mrs Hudson asked, interrupted in her tirad of chatter she was currently engaging in.
Leaning closer, dipping his head, Sherlock told him,
? Not happening! Cock-block-atmosphere at its finest... He couldn't afford a hotel room for a night either. And... “Hey honey, where do you want to go? Your place or your place?” Honestly? No way!
Then he turned one last time, squared his shoulders and marched away in the direction of Marylebone road.
“You know what it does to me,” he chuckled. “From our first crime scene on. No-one except you has ever made me enjoy myself that much, made me happy. I still don’t know what I’m even doing there apart from conducting light,” he smirked, only slightly as if he just made an inside joke with himself, “but I keep traipsing along like a puppy only to watch you.” Sherlock tried to hide the involuntarily growing fond smile spreading on his face.
"Fine! I'm fine!" Sherlock hissed irritated. "Why wouldn't I be fine?" He glared at his brother, who didn't bat an eyelid at Sherlock's anger. Mycroft held his gaze, kept on eating, absolutely unaffected, which only spiked Sherlock's irritation.
"Sorry."
John tried to continue pitying himself. But there was a kind of feeling taking hold of him, spreading in his chest, he always tried to avoid. The warmth that crept through his veins was carrying memories of other days they’ve had together, the days that had been much happier than those he was cursed to relive lately. There had been smiles, there had been fun, there had been excitement, there had been trust, there had been … yes, love. There had been that special bond they’d shared. Whatever anyone liked to call it, for him and Sherlock there never had been the need to specify it. It just had been there. It just had been them! On that note… yes; it was kind of perfect love Sherlock had given him. But when and why has that changed? Had it changed?
As time went by, more than just the content of their tea tin was changing, but it happened in such a slow and subtle way that John didn’t notice it immediately. He was so absorbed in their little roleplay—trying to get it right, trying to stay in control and, admittedly, not only a bit distracted by the irresistible beauty that was the perfectly shaped lean male body only barely covered by the teasingly tight lace and velvet attire, bending, bowing, twisting and twining on stage. The air of ravenous vampire that now inextricably clinged to lashes like raven’s feathers and eyes dark and gleaming like coals didn’t make it any easier for him to concentrate and to have enough working brain cells left to notice the more obscure changes. Really, how could anyone expect him to see…
John rubbed his neck. God, his head was killing him. He looked forward to a glorious breakfast of preferably a bucket of coffee, black no milk, toast with nothing and a whole pack of paracetamol.
"John, I would never have expected you to be this disloyal."
"No, John. Spice up as in 'could be dangerous'!" Sherlock lowered his voice and winked at John before he hustled out of the door; John could already hear him on the phone in the living room.
Still gripping his head, his whole upper body came to life, gliding in one powerful circle around his middle, head thrown back, fingers clutching his hair as if to be afraid to lose hold of something.
He slammed the laptop shut with much more force than needed, janked the disc out of the device and threw it, in childish panic, across the room in the direction of his bags. With a satisfying bang it hit the wall and bounced off, flipped and tumbled to vanish somewhere behind his bag.
"If you want me to." Mycroft answered calmly, cautiously.
However, while munching on his cereal after he had conquered the journey from his bed over to the kitchen counter and then to the chair at his kitchen table — which all in all took approximately 5 steps — he couldn't shake the weird sensation of feeling content.
There were vegetables spread over the kitchen counter, pots and pans on the stove. A bottle of wine opened, wine poured into two glasses.
John thought, his heart rate speeding up.

“But… you slept…” John's brow wrinkled even further in confusion. “You never sleep during a case…”
“Oh, is that so?” John grinned.
Sherlock took a deep breath. He had to gather all his strength not to run away, hide. He wouldn’t, this time! He would stay, he would try, he would let John know. He would let John see. Then, it would be John’s decision to make.
“Because you left.”
“See? That’s the problem. You see two different people. But it’s all me, John.” Sherlock said urgently.
"Talking about that…" John eased his hold and picked his fork up to resume eating but didn't let go of Sherlock with his other hand. "You let everyone get tested, I assume we will as well, right?" He waited for Sherlock's confirming nod. "I think we should take precautions anyway. We've been exposed to so many people and I don't completely trust those tests and just imagine we spread it; I couldn't live with the thought and if one of us gets sick... I want to be able to keep an eye on you at all times…"
He never answered the phone. Or the doorbell. He tried to pretend to be gone already. Did his best not to even be a shadow of himself. He couldn't take any risk. To be seen. And to see.
He sighed, half pleased by that image, half frustrated about the situation. Where was Sherlock? What was he doing? Was he safe? What if Sherlock needed him and he wouldn't know? They were on a case after all! John didn’t like that one bit, losing sight of his Pirate, not knowing what was going on. Yes, fine… girls’ area didn’t sound too threatening. But what was there possibly to still be prepared anyway. Hadn’t they done all that at home already? And what was he supposed to do now, huh? Stupid case!
So John made work to unpack the bags; shaking his head in disbelief and snickering more and more in amusement the deeper he dug into them.
Female, in her late forties, attempts to appear younger, husband had been having a love affair, lover half her age, midlife crisis. New career after divorce. No kids. Now single. That would also explain the sultry and seductive voice she put on to torment her audience with. Clearly out to coax some poor lonely and needy creature into calling and chatting her up.
Finally up, he padded to the loo, took a quick shower and after being dressed made his way to the kitchen for his first morning coffee. It was already brewed, so Greg was already up, and when John took his first sip his eyes fell on the clock. It was late in the morning already, nearly noon, which explained the sun already being high in the sky. John also got aware of the windows being ajar and still the boat being hot like an oven. No draft, not even a bit of air moving inside the room. The weather had made good to the promise of yesterday evening's implications then. A very rare warm and bright early summer day over London.
“Well, yeah.” John huffed. Really, only Scott would be able to make a shift from temptation to toddler in a nanosecond.
"Well, I had hoped to introduce you to my roof terrace, maybe…" Greg answered and John sensed the teasing undertone. "I could get us some… donuts, for starters." Greg smirked and it made the skin around his eyes crinkle in glee. Even John had to admit that Greg was a handsome man, although he had never felt anything but camaraderie for his mate. Surprisingly though, Mycroft seemed to think differently.
words to say what you want to hear. There are No. Words."
Oh dear God, was he wanking himself? Jesus Christ, John closed his eyes and groaned. Not that he'd really need any further assistance at this point anyway, but — this couldn’t be over already, right? At least, he realised, he didn’t want it to be...
“That was what made me realise what I really wanted. For myself, for you. All I want is for you to be happy, Sherlock. I’d do everything for that."
He didn't open his eyes. He didn't move. He didn't wipe it away.
John swallowed. Maybe Mike was right and this could be fun after all, just for tonight. At least it wouldn’t hurt to watch.

“I don’t know what to do about it! I thought I knew myself, John. I don’t. I don’t understand.” He wanted John to come closer. He wanted to vanish into thin air. He wanted to see John’s face. He’d never dare to look at John ever again.
he thought.
Sherlock took one short glance at John and said frostily: “No time for a proper dinner, you know that John! We would lose track of him! What good would THAT do?”
"Thanks, mate." John mumbled and revelled some more in the peaceful quiet in his head.
On a different note, remember: songs on the left=chosen by the boys, songs on the right=chosen by author
When the music gave way to the silence again, John took a deep breath of air that smelled like washed clean of all the dust that had made it heavy and thick.
Without taking any breath, his lungs void of air, vacuum, he pressed play and watched John Watson settle onto a sofa. A sofa Sherlock didn't recognise. John looked… ragged. Deep dark circles underneath his eyes indicating sleepless nights. Posture stiff not solely from nerves but also from sore muscles hinting on an uncomfortable sleeping surface. No bed then, thus no hotel room and more importantly not his own flat with his own bed… Sherlock had to close his eyes for a short moment… draw a shivering breath… not in bed with someone else either. So probably a lilo. Or the sofa he was currently sitting on. Unknown sofa. Not good. Sherlock swallowed. But then, John's shirt. Crumpled, collar only poorly tugged in shape, not ironed. No iron available. So, probably not in a woman's place then… clichés, but true often enough. Good. Another breath, a bit easier. Also not in a place of a man concerned enough about his appearance to own an iron… or use it. Also good. Sherlock had no idea why it mattered. Only, he had but didn't want to think about it. So, a friend's place probably, sleeping on the sofa. A makeshift arrangement. Good. Good! It didn't matter anymore. But… good! Sherlock exhaled.
OOhhhhh, lookingforclues (yes, we do!! hahah), thank you soooooo much for this update! I’m so happy for you!! And I know for certain that my followers are as well!! You two are honestly so cute! Thank you for letting me take part in this!
“Hmmm,” John hummed, amused, some of the tension shifting into eager anticipation. “What though, if I don’t care about your posh shirts?”
“The poor sod, though, who had to buy the other stuff…” he smirked.
With that being the current mood in 221b, in retrospect, John should have been suspicious about the sudden contentment.
******
John’s breath hitched when Sherlock reached up and crumpled John’s collar in a tight grip. Sherlock pulled him closer, face to face, stared at him with an intensity to melt whole mountains. He only held him, breathing, roaming his face. They were so close, John could feel the heat of Sherlock’s body gather in the narrow space between them. Sherlock’s hand on his collar trembled, his whole body vibrated with the effort it took to hold back. John held his breath, didn’t dare to move. How was he supposed to survive this?
They showered quickly and efficiently, toweled each other dry, grinning like infatuated teenagers and headed back to the bedroom to finally dress up and get ready for the evening.
"Yes. That's… my duvet. Stupid idea. I'll just take it back to my room and you can…"
"How can a flat beige-ish shapeless… mush..."
guy on the line.
“It wasn’t exactly an experiment though,” Sherlock fidgeted. “No pipettes, no beakers, no bunsen burner acquired, John.” Sherlock sounded like trying to convince his granny that he wasn’t the one who had nicked the cookie. “Not even a microscope!” He looked triumphant.
“How do you know about my leg though?” John frowned, fiddling with the key to get it into the slot.
