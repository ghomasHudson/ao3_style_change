Another speaking look. This was why Tony didn't want Rhodey and Pepper in a room together; they always ganged up on him. "What we need," Rhodey said, straightening back up and dropping Pepper's hands, "is a party."
Pepper smile at him, a little wry and sad. “Tony. The only person he wanted to see when he came back was you.”
Tony snorted. "Happy isn't the word I'd use." He pulled out another book. "Any interest in Shakespeare?"
from here on out, i'll be writing chapters as they're posted, so I'm not sure how regular updates will be. but I'm in the groove for this story, so hopefully i'll be able to keep them coming!
"Your ankle." Captain Rogers seemed to realize how abrupt he sounded. He cleared his throat. "Does it feel better?"
"It's a pet project of mine," he said with faux-nonchalance.
(See the end of the chapter for
one?" He brandished his schematic. "This one is going to change all of that."
's personal tormentor."
"Tony, you can't seriously tell me you'd prefer an earthquake to dinner with Captain Rogers."
It was early still, the sun barely peeking over the trees. Tony had not slept at all through the night and had waited until first light to leave his room, as it seemed more respectable than skulking about at night and alerting the servants to his insomnia. Tony passed one of the new housemaids in the halls; she dipped into a nervous curtsey and hurried on her way without looking him in the eyes. Tony wasn’t sure why all the new staff seemed to be afraid of him; he did his best to reassure their nerves with kindness and smiles, but it didn't seem to help.
“Oh? What about when Rhodey broke his leg? Or when Jarvis had the terrible flu? Or what about—”
"Tony," she said. "I already forgave you for it. Okay?"
"I've read in front of you!"
Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw Barnes offering his arm to a blushing Sharon. Tony gnawed on the inside of his cheek but lifted his head with a cheerful smile.
"I think I might pass out," Tony said. "No beauty in equations! You couldn't have challenged me more directly if you'd insulted my own mother, sir."
“What kind of accident?” Yinsen asked, never once pausing in his motions. “How long ago?”
It was one lance after another. Tony wanted to be relieved, but there could only be one explanation for Captain Rogers' improved mood - the introduction of a new love, one that could actually return his affections and accept his proposal. Peggy was the cause of this uplift in mood, not Tony. He swallowed.
"Well, if you're
they fight together? Every day there was some new monster haunting the woods that could only be stopped by their combined power. They rescued imaginary damsels (often played by an exasperated Pepper or, on several memorable occasions, Rhodey). They protected the village with made-up patrols, ignoring the indulgent chuckles of the townsfolk. They rescued each other from nefarious rebels or thieves. Captain Rogers had been the instigator of most of it, always ready with a story and a villain they could use for that day's adventure. Tony would embellish, add in details, and mark out the places to have their heroic fights.
Tony flinched. “I don’t hate it,” he said. “It’s not—I don’t—This is my
He set the box gently on the bed and opened the lock, dropping the key back in his pocket. The box’s hinges creaked as he pushed it open. There was a fine layer of dust on the neat rows of letters arranged just so in the interior. The box was the perfect size to house them all sitting on their edges—there were enough to fill the entire thing to bursting, divided by ribbons to keep them organized. Tony stared down at the neat rows and swallowed hard. When he looked up his heart twisted.
Tony couldn't argue with her about that; it was only the truth.
“None to speak of,” Pepper said. “His parents are long dead and he has no siblings or cousins. Not that they would have helped me if he did. Things were not—well between us, those last few months. Finding out I was pregnant after his last visit was something of a mixed blessing.”
, anyway? Tony was sure his father wouldn't share confidences with Fury even though they'd been neighbors for years. Fury was just a baronet; not worthy of an earl's time, in Howard's opinion.
"You're very attentive to her." Captain Rogers took a deep, steadying breath as Tony watched, completely baffled. "I guess I should say congratulations."
Pepper managed to get close enough to smack his head. He pouted at her and she rolled her eyes, turning away with a mutter that sounded suspiciously like a wish for Rhodey to be there. More the fool her—Rhodey had never managed to get Tony to behave either.
It wasn't until nightfall that Tony was finally, blessedly alone. In the darkness of his room, in the comfort of his bed, he allowed the clenched emotions he'd kept locked down to release at last and bitter tears swelled up in his eyes despite his better judgment. He swiped angrily at them and pressed his wet, hot face into a pillow. His despair and fury were almost too much for his body to contain - he wanted to scream them out, to hurt or smash something, wail like a toddler. He gritted his teeth against the overwhelming wave of them and eventually he relaxed, the worst of their potency dimmed.
"—can survive without you for a few hours. Harley's already gone down there to help her, after all." Sharon smiled at him. "Please come?"
Pepper regarded him sternly. “You don’t have to do this,” she said. “I’ll be fine on my own. I’ll stay at home and work on embroidery for the child. You can tell Mr. Jarvis to call in on me, if you absolutely have to. Fury’s charges will probably be down to visit once they arrive. I’ll be
Mr. Coulson was waiting for Tony in the foyer when he arrived back at the manor. He was as solemn as Jarvis, but there was a bit of a smile playing around his mouth.
Pepper stuck out her tongue at him. "It's true. You come, you find something to fix, you leave. We've hardly talked about anything
"Pepper—"
"I've heard Stark Manor has a marvelous library," Sousa told him. He was a quiet man, almost dour, especially in comparison to his rowdy companions, but Tony appreciated his thoughtful conversation. "Do you have much poetry in your collection?"
Tony waved a hand. "It's been a long time since they lived here," he said. "I would have thought they'd find the sea more comforting. Isn't that how it's supposed to be for you Navy men?"
Tony clenched his fists. “Yes. I’ll return it as soon as she’s settled.”
“We’ve been friends since we were children,” he told her.
"Well,
To his credit, Fury’s irritation dispersed immediately. “The child?” he asked.
Sharon grinned. "He was paying
Tony wanted to curl up under the hedge and never leave. He clenched his teeth. Hobbling forward, he made enough of a racket that by the time he got to the garden gate, Captain Rogers and Peggy were already silent, watching for him. Peggy hurried forward, the only sign that they had just been talking about him a slight flush to her cheeks.
“There’s been some complications with the pregnancy,” Tony said. Peggy’s eyes widened in dismay and he waved a hand. “Nothing too concerning! Dr. Yinsen made a full examination just yesterday. But since she’s living on her own…”
"I couldn't do it." He shook his head. "Howard meant it. He'd ruin Captain Rogers and I couldn't—couldn't do that to him. Not for something he might regret ten years down the road." He could still remember Obie patting him on the back, telling him that they were both young men and they'd find someone more suitable. "If I let him go, he'd have his future and a chance at finding someone else to make him happy. I was going to tell him but he—" Steve, down on one knee, his mother's familiar wedding ring held up in supplication. Tony had panicked. "He proposed before I could. I refused and said a lot of awful things to make him really believe it. He left for sea the next day and we haven't spoken since, until now."
“Oh, I think I can come up with a few,” he said and threw in a wink for good measure.
is Euler's number, a mathematical constant, while i is an imaginary number. I'm sure you recognize the quaint pi and, of course, 1 is 1 and 0 is 0."
That made the boy snort, which was what Tony had been aiming for.
Tony didn't look at Captain Rogers. He shrugged. "It's not that important," he said. He reached out and took the little sword. He gave him an experimental flick and smiled. "Lighter than I remember."
Tony propped his hip against the nearby counter, tucking his borrowed books close to his side. "My point is if I'm going to be tarred and feathered I want to know exactly what crime I committed. Call me old-fashioned."
"I wanted to tell you, both of you," Pepper said, drying her eyes on Rhodey's much-abused handkerchief. "But what kind of letter is that? We haven't seen each other in years, I'm having a baby, please come help me?" She scoffed, a deep, mucus-y sound thanks to the tears. "I couldn't bear to do it."
Peggy blinked. "You fixed it
Tony took this information in. He didn't soften or show any of the outrage he was feeling. Harley didn't want it. Instead, he nodded briskly.
It had been one of his mother's tricks, to answer something uncomfortable with a vague question. It had always seemed to work to pivot her out of things she didn't want to talk about.
. Do tell."
Tony's guilt was an old friend.
Captain Rogers deserved privacy for this. Tony had had his time and said what he wanted to say. He needed to leave.
"Not at all."
"Not as much as Lord Stark."
“Yes, thank you, I’m aware of that!”
Tony closed his eyes, clenching the charm in his hand. Captain Rogers had found it during the open market that the town had every other Sunday. He’d bought it with some of his meager savings and given it to Tony the night before he’d left to become an apprentice on

that."
"He's quite handsome," Peggy said. "And very personable. I would be happy if the two of them were to wed, but so far he hasn't made any move to make things official."
“I see. And his wife?”
"How is Pepper?"
Her face had a familiar mulish cast to it. "You should
The next morning, Tony rose early and out of sorts. He’d been besieged by dreams, half-remembered memories that made him irritable and melancholy. The thought of breakfast on his own only worsened his bad mood and he made a last-minute decision to visit Pepper again. She was always the best at getting him out of his bad tempers.
"You gave me a heart attack," he said as Sousa approached him, leaning heavily on his cane. "I'm too young and pretty to die like that."
“Ready, Fri?”
Walking into the living room, he stopped at the threshold and silently looked at them for a moment. There was a sea of pillows on the carpet where the coffee table used to be, but it had been pushed to the side. Tony was laying on the carpet, his head propped on the pillows as Peter cuddled up to him, half on the pillows and half on Tony. Steve quickly snapped a photo with his phone before making his presence obvious.
“Or maybe I’ll be totally wrong and you’ll like the most common food” Tony said as he set another bowl, this one with food, right beside the water, arching a dark eyebrow when the kitten pretty much tripped over her own feet trying to get to the food as fast as she could “Did they starve you back at the shelter by any chance?” Tony saw as the kitten pretty much inhaling her food, doing a great impression of Thor when the god chomped on food as if it’d suddenly disappear; Tony guessed she thought it would, after being abandoned.
But after a full month, T’Challa had finally cleared his schedule enough to spend a couple of weeks with Tony, he hadn’t even mentioned it to the man in hopes to surprise him, but the only one surprised as T’Challa himself.  He had meant to look for the man, assuming it was very likely he would be down in his lab, and just appear there, Tony would turn around and smile and rush to hug him, kiss him and maybe, if things heated up, he’d wrap his arms around the shorter man and carry him up to his bedroom. But after Jarvis informed him Tony wasn’t in his lab, T’Challa had to scratch the first part of his plan, and it wasn’t really a bad thing, it was just a few less steps, the thing he did find strange was the fact that Jarvis told him Tony was sleeping –which was rare enough on its own- but the fact that he had company, and not only with one but six; T’Challa knew better than anyone that Tony liked to cuddle, so it was usual for the man to do it, usually Rhodey was Tony’s personal pillow whenever T’Challa wasn’t around, Banner occasionally, but the prince wasn’t so sure the other Avengers would be so willing.
As he started to walk out of the living room, the sound of Tony humming and singing softly to their daughter made him smile.
Steve didn’t need to say aloud that it wasn’t his forte. Sure he could lead a team into battle, create fighting strategies, rescue civilians, talk in public, face vicious criminals, but baby-sitting a cat wasn’t among his repertoire of abilities. He wasn’t familiar with the language of cats, they weren’t as easy to read as dogs, they seemed to say one thing but mean another; the two cats he had encountered in his life, had hissed at him, and due to his many ailments before the serum he wasn’t keen on finding out if he was –also- allergic to cats.
“Pepper?”
He made the short walk down to Pepper’s cottage, trying to think about the knotty problem in his latest project and not the wisps of dreams that had followed him to the waking hour. Still lost in his own thoughts, it took him a moment to realize that it was taking an uncommonly long time for Pepper to open her door. Tony frowned and peered through the front window—he could see the light of a candle inside. Was Pepper ignoring him?
"Rhodey!" The great shout leaped out of Tony unbidden. He let go of Peggy's arm and began to run, uncaring of his ankle or the dust kicking up around his legs. "Am I dreaming? Rhodey!"
Tony was surprised by her genuine concern. Pepper was his childhood friend and he cared for her deeply, but as a daughter of the local parish, she wasn’t someone who would normally be well acquainted with the local lords. Especially not well enough that they would know her special nickname. To most of the world, she went by Virginia.
The table was too quiet. Tony was very aware that he'd just spoken more in the presence of Captain Rogers than he had in years, never mind that the Captain knew his feelings on the matter personally. They'd had this exact argument before. Some of it must have stuck if he could still rattle off Euler's identity without pausing.
"I don't
“You are
"We'll see you all back at the house," Fury told the others. "Don't let anyone else step in a rabbit hole."
Harley didn't look convinced. He was a sharp kid. But he also didn't question Tony, just hovered by his elbow as Tony took several more breaths and continued up the stairs.
“Oh,” Peggy said. “I didn’t realize you knew Mrs. Killian so well, Lord Stark.”
"Oh, Tony," Pepper said. She tried to get to her feet again, managing this time and nearly falling over Tony as a result. "Do you think I'm stupid? Or blind? I've been with you this entire time, you know. I can see what being around him does to you."
Tony was trying to remember if he even knew Bruce's address in London when the hairs on the back of his neck stood up. Tony curled his fingers in the grass and cautiously looked over his shoulder.
Tony hummed. "How would you feel about keeping an ear to the ground?"
Coulson’s eyebrows went up. “Surely you’ll at least stay for dinner!” he said. “They are aware that they are displacing you, Lord Stark. They seemed most eager to meet your acquaintance.”
“I was under the impression this was urgent,” he said.
“Maria tells me the new tenants have safely moved into Stark Manor.”
"No, I haven't had the pleasure," Sousa said. "But I was stationed in intelligence during the war."
? It was as infuriating as it was mysterious. Tony adopted his most outraged expression.
"Is there something else I can help you with, Lord Stark?"
Harley made a face. "You can just call me Harley, you know," he said. "And Lucy wants to go to sleep. We need our bags."
"Lord Stark!"
There wasn't any reprimand in his voice, nothing intimate at all, but Tony couldn't stop the flood of memories of Captain Rogers finding Tony curled up with a book or a schematic and scolding him for losing track of time.
Tony waited, but the Captain didn't offer an explanation. Barnes had loved Mrs. Rogers as much as the Captain had. As much as Tony himself had. He should be there as well and it niggled at Tony's curiosity that he wasn't. He'd always had a terrible time containing that particular vice, but he bit his tongue. If he stuck his nose in Barnes' business, he had a feeling it would get bitten off.
“I have my ways,” Jarvis said. He met Tony’s eyes. “This isn’t just a visit, is it, Master Stark?”
Yinsen smiled. "I think my faith will be rewarded, Lord Stark." He pushed the book in Tony's direction. "Please."
"I'm not sure marrying you would be trading up, my lord."
! Can you believe it?"
Tony bit the inside of his cheek so he wouldn't laugh at the kid's honest indignation. He reached over and ruffled his hair just a little.
Tony wiggled his fingers at the boy. That kind of full-hearted enthusiasm was a lot to deal with but it was endearing.
stole their flowers?" He pointed emphatically at Barnes. "
He bit the inside of his cheek as that made everyone in the room pause and look at him. Captain Rogers was the only one who did not stare; he, in fact, had not even come into the house yet. Tony didn't twist to look for him, but it was a near thing. He'd been trying very hard not to notice the Captain's presence, but he hadn't realized it was easier to avoid him because he wasn't in the room.
Why was she torturing him like this? "We were friends. That's all."
haven't seen anyone there and I'm there a lot. They stole from Mr. Sitwell last month after he sold all those dresses to some ladies traveling through the area - it was more money than he'd had in three years, he said."
“Master Rhodes has been in London for some time now, as you well know.”
"I couldn't say," he managed to gasp out.
turn into a reality - but he'd sent the plans to Steve years ago. He'd sent everything to Captain Rogers, eager to hear his thoughts and maybe trying to show off, just a little.
and you're not even paying attention to what I'm saying." Harley stared over Tony's shoulder. "What are you looking at you little
Tony could feel the flush crawling up the back of his neck. He cleared his throat.
"Old friends of the Captain and the Lieutenant," he explained. "They came to visit for a few days to catch up. I suspect they're also here to check on the Lieutenant's health."
Harley stared up at him. "You're crazy," he said.
"No. He didn't often speak of his own private feelings, even before. But I've known him a long time. I can make some guesses."
“I see,” Coulson said. It was difficult to tell with his stern face, but he seemed disappointed. “I’ll convey your regards, then.”
"Who can remember that far back?" he said, glad his voice concealed his turmoil. "I'm looking to the future, Captain. Can't have anything weighing me down."
"You can't just - take people you don't know into your big, fancy house!"
Tony didn’t want to air that dirty laundry to a relative stranger. They’d always been so sensitive about it.
"My husband says that Mr. Wilson will present his suit by the end of the month, but I'm convinced Captain Rogers will make a bid for our Peggy very soon. What do you think? You knew him best as a child - do you think he will propose next week? The week after?"
"Mr. Stark?"
"I know you don't," Tony said. That seemed to take some of the wind out of his sails and he blinked at Tony. "But Mr. Toomes seems determined to punish you and he won't be convinced unless you give me a reason to convince him."
She smiled again, maybe at the heavy sarcasm. "Mrs. Natasha Barnes. A pleasure to meet you."
Captain Rogers sighed. "Clever as he is, Lord Stark changes his mind with the wind." It was impossible to ignore the bitterness in his voice. "If he were to marry, I could only pity the poor fool he chooses."
"But what exactly
"I can make it," he said.
Tony wanted to ask about these so-called strange ideas, but Sharon tugged hard on his elbow.
yes, that's me." Disconcerting to be known so quickly by a stranger in the forest. "I don't suppose you'll give me the pleasure of
He turned and walked away. It was more difficult than he'd expected; he kept wanting to look back and take another glimpse of Captain Rogers no matter how cold his eyes were. His heart felt like it was beating in double-time and the moment they were officially out of sight of the doorway, he had to stop and breathe.
“The baby?” Tony looked down and stiffened when he realized Pepper’s nightgown had blood seeping through it between her thighs. His body went cold. No, no, no. “Gods. I’ll call for a doctor.”
"Your father is Lord Howard Stark, isn't he?"
Tony feigned being stabbed in the heart. "I give you my time and my devotion and this is how you repay me? With betrayal?"
name?"
"He's been devoted to Pepper, though," Peggy continued thoughtfully. Tony wondered if she noticed any reaction from Captain Rogers - she was perceptive. But her voice was light and airy and he couldn't see her face, so he couldn't tell. "He's been going to see her every day. Oh, I'm so sorry - do you know Pepper? I mean, Mrs. Killian?"
He had headaches often enough, but this one was a lie; better if to set the groundwork early if he needed to escape with a legitimate sounding excuse. He nodded at the exclamations over his health and didn't look out the window to watch Stark Manor loom out of the darkness.
"Gentlemen." Their squabble cut off abruptly under Mrs. Barnes' icy stare. Tony wondered if she would teach him how to do that. "Lord Stark has a point, I assume?"
"Well, well," he said. Did he sound normal? He couldn't tell. "Look what the cat dragged in. Lieutenant Barnes, Captain Rogers."
“Howard sent me a letter,” he said. “He’s lending out the manor. I’m to oversee the new tenant and then make a leg for London straightaway.”
he imagined them whispering to each other.
“Don’t be sorry,” Pepper said stiffly. She sighed and seemed to relax a little. “I would never want you to apologize for being yourself, Tony,” she continued. “I’m the one with the issue. I’ll get over it.”
“Yes. The lieutenant, he used to live nearby.” Tony forced his voice to stay even. “You remember Bucky Barnes, don’t you?”
Color began to suffuse the Captain's face. "You made them to me. Many of them."
much.”
Fury turned away. Tony followed after him, starting to panic. If Fury said no, he’d have to inquire about renting rooms in town and he had no idea if they’d even have anything available. Not to mention the distance would make it that much harder to help Pepper.
“Yes, Tony," she said. "I forgive you.”
"A soft—I am—That is
A walk. A chaperone. Tony took in the cozy intimacy between them, the flush on Peggy's cheeks. His stomach hollowed out. Oh. So Sharon hadn't been wrong after all, about Captain Rogers paying particular attention to Peggy.
“It’s stupid,” he said. It was easier to admit that to himself now that the shock had passed, now that he could think clearly again. “It’s just—the new tenants. Turns out they’re not strangers after all.”
Barnes finally looked at Tony, his cheek still cradled in his wife's palm. His expression was chilly despite the tender gesture between them.
Rhodey softened. He crouched down in front of Pepper and took her hands in his, even the one with the snot-covered handkerchief. "I get that, I do. But we're here now, okay? So let us help."
Jarvis had never been particularly demonstrative, always solemn and reserved, but Tony could see the warmth in his eyes and the small crease to his lips that was his particular form of a smile. Tony smiled back, some of the tension leaving his back. Stark Manor had so many unpleasant memories that he’d almost forgotten that it had good ones, too.
Tony wasn't surprised. The kid was smart, a survivor; why wouldn't he grab food when he knew he had it to save for when he wouldn't have it anymore? He bit into his toast, ignoring Fury's stare.
Toomes' face twisted. "
Yinsen firmly told Tony he had no place hovering while Yinsen worked and shut the door in his face before Tony could even check on Pepper. Tony managed to distract himself with indignation for a full twenty minutes and then he spent another ten pacing. Thoroughly fed up with the anxious cycle of his own thoughts, he turned his attention to Pepper’s living room. It only took the work of two minutes to find a grandfather clock shoved in the corner, quiet and broken—Pepper had begun to dismantle it, but had yet to finish. Tony knew nothing about clocks, but how hard could it be? And, at the very least, it would keep his mind off of how bloody long Yinsen had been sequestered in that bedroom with Pepper.
"When was this?"
Tony made a little disbelieving sound. "It's a child's toy, Captain. It was fun enough at the time, but it's nothing I need now."
"Meant or not, I can't let slander like that go unanswered," he said, keeping his voice light so that Sousa would know he was joking. Mostly, anyway. "Here, a wager; I'll bet I can convince you of the beauty of just one equation - just one! - or I'll drop out of Cambridge tomorrow."
For several long seconds, he could only stand in front of the door. He’d made the decision to come down here at the last minute late last night as he’d stared at the ceiling in his old childhood bedroom. Coulson was supposed to hear back from the potential tenants that afternoon—if it went well, Tony would likely be out of the manor before the week’s end, on his way to London. If he wanted to speak to Pepper, to finally clear the air between them, there was no better time. It had been years, he’d reminded himself as he’d come down from the main house. Pepper surely couldn’t still be that angry with him.
“What kind of fellow is he, this tenant?”
Tony pointed at the paper again with more emphasis. "But they're all there, too!" he said and saw his enthusiasm catch, just a little, in the answering smile on Dugan's face. "See there—addition, subtraction, and exponentials. Simple forms holding down the more complex ones, all intermixed. But the true beauty from this equation - this one especially, but really all equations - is the
." Parker shivered. He leaned in and said, in a confidential whisper, "Sir Fury scares me, sir."
nickname.”
"Oh, it was a grand old time," Tony told her. He knew the Captain was looking at him, so he kept his focus on Mrs. Barnes, kept his voice light. "Not that there was much challenge. My parents always used to drag me to London, throw this big soiree with all of their friends - deadly boring, as you might imagine. Pretty sure that was the best birthday I'd ever had."
Tony lightly took a step until he was between Toomes and Peter.
He cocked his hip and crossed his arms over his chest, leaning against the nearest bookshelf. "You don't know him. Otherwise you wouldn't say that with a straight face."
to summon up some propriety." He cleared his throat and in a stuffier, more proper voice, he said, "Lovely to meet you, I've only heard good things, etc. etc."
it read.
Pepper's wine was indeed drinkable. So drinkable that Tony found himself soused in less than three glasses. Tony tried to sit up properly on the floor but everything went wobbly and his head spun.
The question came out like an order. Tony flinched from the bite in the Captain's voice and hurriedly got to his feet. He wobbled on his bad ankle, still tender and mostly asleep after sitting for so long. Captain Rogers' eyes flickered down to his bare feet and Tony resisted the urge to try and hide them from his gaze.
"Oh, I know."
Before he could duck away, Peggy saw him. She smiled, giving him a little wave, and Captain Rogers turned to see who she was greeting. Tony had a brief moment to take in the warm smile he was in the process of offering before he realized who exactly it was he smiling at; the expression froze on his face. Tony bit the inside of his cheek.
, sir and he's been wanting to go into trade and—"
"Sorry, what was that? You're going by Lord Stank now?"
The inside of the clinic was small but bright, clean and tidy and smelling of herbs. Tony paused in the threshold.
"Very proper indeed." She didn't have a particularly expressive voice, but her irony was undeniable.
Captain Rogers thought him a weak-minded coward. He would pity anyone Tony married. Tony had always suspected the Captain's feelings, but it had hurt more than he thought to have them confirmed. And yet. And
"I told them they must come along, too!"
“Not at—?” Tony gaped at him. “Excuse me?”
"Not a one," Tony admitted. "I did spend over a week trying to examine a rock that turned out just to be simple granite."
"I couldn't get out of bed for three days," Tony said. The thought of it was enough to make him feel sick now. Was he going to throw up? He waited but his stomach settled.
Tony's father could go rot as far as he was concerned, though he doubted anyone at the table would want to hear that. He'd learned to keep any harsher feelings about his father carefully concealed, even among those he might consider friends; more than one person had tried to convince him that he should pay the old man proper respect and follow his words like orders.
Tony dreamed—
Tony assessed the situation. He was bruised and in pain. Goose was still obviously spooked and unsteady. It was a long way to walk in a dark forest even in the peak of health - and there were supposedly bandits about, though Tony had yet to see any evidence of that himself. All signs pointed to Mrs. Barnes having the right idea, but Tony still balked.
Her mouth quirked. "Did you have a good time?"
it was fun writing fury as a baronet - i have to giggle at the thought of shoving all of that intimidation into a frilly overcoat. he'd rock it, tho.
Then he managed to choke out a wild laugh. "You think I don't
The envelope was a little grimy but the writing on the front -
At the bottom of the letter was a drawing of a tousle-haired boy wearing an oversized captain’s hat, staring doubtfully at the shoreline of a country. The shoreline had the little note
"Thank you." Peggy sounded a little breathless. After a pause, she added, a little uncertainly, "But do you really believe that Lord Stark isn't the type to marry?"
Barnes considered him. "You really mean that?"
"The more the merrier, really," Peggy said. "I'm sure Mr. Wilson would love to meet you both. He fought in the war as well, in the army."
Sharon sputtered. Peggy winked at Tony.
. Tony was grateful even Pepper’s wrath didn’t make her cruel enough to actually say the name out loud. But then, she’d seen the aftermath of that whole terrible debacle, had to live with its consequences as surely as Tony had. She knew, like Rhodey did, exactly what Tony had lost.
He kept up his cheerful façade until he made it to his room. Only then did he drop his face into his hands to breathe. He didn't move again until he felt like he had regained at least some of his equilibrium, but he still felt out-of-sorts as he started to strip off his filthy clothes. Why was it that every encounter with Captain Rogers left Tony feeling small and crushed and vulnerable? Would Tony ever be able to face him normally again?
"Of course." Tony often wrote on and defaced his own books - he found he made better sense of things when he could write his own thoughts - but he would never do something like that to someone else's. "I'll treat them like my own children. Not that I have any children, but if I
It made no damn sense. "Captain Rogers?"
Yinsen thought about it. “She has recovered,” he said at last.
." Tony looked away from her again. "I broke his."
"I'm fine," he complained without any real heat as they walked. "I'm sure I'd be able to make it back if I just caught my breath for a second. I'm barely even bruised." Mrs. Barnes ignored his complaints, steadily moving them forward without even turning her head. Tony scowled at her and tried to tug free again. It was useless. She had an extraordinary grip. "Mrs. Barnes, this really isn't necessary. It's hardly the first time I've been knocked off a horse!"
“Pepper!”
Falling out? Could something that had ruined Tony so grievously, had left him shattered so completely, be summed up in such flimsy words? Tony almost laughed at the thought. But Jarvis, like everyone else, was not privy to the details. No one knew them entirely outside of Tony and Captain Rogers himself and Tony was determined it would stay that way. His pain was his own, not to be shared or gawked at or whispered about, even amongst the people he considered his friends.
"—any books to recommend or miracle cures—"
Tony didn't flinch. He widened his smile until his cheeks hurt. "No," he said. "I'd be surprised if he did. Maybe we can keep that part between us, hm? Our little secret?"
you miss dinner?"
Barnes scowled. "I'm not an invalid," he muttered.
Goose was much calmer now that he was away from any scurrying animals and whickered softly as Mrs. Barnes patted his side.
Pain. Tony cried out in surprise as the ground rushed toward him and just managed to catch himself on his knees and elbows to avoid planting his face directly in the grass.
He jumped and the book thumped to the ground. He collected it with a curse and turned to find Mrs. Barnes watching him from the door, faint amusement on her pale, beautiful face.
"What?" It was more grunt than a word but Rhodey obviously understood him.
Tony straightened. Well, he thought grimly. Time to start getting ready.
"What's
Tony took the lance of pain that brought as gracefully as he could. "Well," he said. "So am I. So there's no need to warn me off. If he can be polite and keep his distance, so can I."
"That's the first time I've heard that."
She agreed with a laugh and they started off. Tony waited and stayed at the back of the party, safely out of sight from both Barnes and Captain Rogers. He made a face once he was sure no one was looking at him. Of all the ways to spend a morning, traipsing around having to watch Captain Rogers dote on Peggy was not his idea of a good time.
"Idiots," she said and reached down, big belly and all, to hug him.
“On your own? What happened to your husband?”
"Tony was telling me about his automobile engines," Harley said. "Do
Tony's stomach twisted. He'd spent too many years looking away, he thought as growing, icy dread began to crawl down his throat. He hadn't wanted to have anything to do with his father and he'd been content to bury himself in his work at Cambridge. He wanted to say it couldn't be true but the sad thing was that he just had no idea; it wasn't like he'd ever spent enough time with Howard Stark to really know his character. And hadn't he thought it odd that Howard would lend out Stark Manor?
Tony exchanged a startled look with Captain Rogers. After a moment, the Captain made a little motion for Tony to keep talking.
Tony didn’t answer. He was already running up the stairs.
"I may still yet grow," he sniffed.
Tony's heart leaped into his throat. Had she found out about Pepper's confession? He hadn't told anyone about that and he doubted Pepper would have.
handsome and so rich now after his spoils during the war!" Sharon waved her hands. "He's the most eligible bachelor in the area!"
"In the end, though, it didn't matter." Tony's hands clenched just remembering. "Howard got wind of what was going on and he put his foot down. He wouldn't approve a marriage with some lowly sea captain with no title and no fortune. Not with his only son." Tony snorted, still bitter. "He didn't give a damn for my entire life until I tried to do one thing to make myself happy."
“I’m to take my proper place as a peer of the realm,” Tony said with no little bitterness. He shook his head. “Look, Pepper. I wanted to say that I’m—I’m sorry about what happened last time. It was awful of me and I shouldn’t have said any of it. I was just—” Tony shook his head again. He couldn’t even begin to voice how he’d felt then. “I’m sorry.”
"Understood." He reached for a hardboiled egg and the coffee.
Tony blinked in the most innocent way possible even as he wondered what exactly the Barneses had told Yinsen. "Lieutenant Barnes?
Tony swallowed. "Sounds circumstantial to me," he said.
Fury's scowl deepened. "I just think she's a little too interested in us," he grumbled. "She asked a lot of questions about you especially, Stark."
, I am
"Red," Captain Rogers said. He smiled down at the helmet. "It's his favorite color."
Peggy, seated near Captain Rogers at the head of the table, seemed enthralled. Whenever enthusiasm for Navy stories flagged, she encouraged another one and the Captain and his friends were happy to oblige her. Tony found it difficult to look at her sparkling eyes focused on Captain Rogers and the way he seemed to straighten under her adoring attention. He focused on Sousa instead.
Peggy dimpled. "I wouldn't worry about that too much, Lord Stark," she said. "Uncle Nick doesn't much approve of you either."
Tony found the box precisely where he’d left it. He doubted any of the staff had neglected to clean under this bed for six years, but Jarvis would have instructed them to leave it alone. The box had come with a beautiful gold lock. Tony had hidden the key years ago underneath his bed. He groped around for it in the darkness and breathed out a sharp sigh of relief to find it exactly where he’d left it.
The Keener children weren't at the table. Tony reached for a piece of toast and started buttering it unconcernedly. If they had truly done something terrible, Fury would be much angrier.
Tony settled back in his chair. He was hardly going to take that kind of skepticism lying down. "How is a poem beautiful?" he challenged.
It only took a few minutes. "Well," Yinsen said, leaning back. "The swelling is down considerably and there doesn't appear to be any further damage. Does it still hurt?"
“Now, now, there’s no need for such filthy language,” Tony said, adopting the prim, proper voice he’d heard one of his many governesses use. “In front of a peer of the realm, too! What would your wife think, Sir Fury?”
“I hate it when you do that,” she said.
Was this just his life now? Taking unexpected and embarrassing falls?
Tony paused in the second floor library. He ran a hand over the books on the nearest shelf. For a second, it was almost like he was twelve again, listening to Bucky try to convince him to try one of those gothic horrors he liked so much. Gods, how long had it even been since they’d seen each other? Over ten years, certainly. Bucky had never returned to Somerset after getting his promotion—he’d gone straight back to the sea on his new ship. Not like—Captain Rogers, who had come back for a few months.
Tony hadn't thought about Happy in years. "He's still here, then?" he asked through a rapidly tightening throat.
," he muttered weakly.
“And maybe she brought some friends. Although there are Fury’s wards around now, so she won’t want for company as much as she could have.”
"Steam engines are the future of travel," he said. "I'd wager we'll all be traveling on trains powered by them within the next ten years, if not sooner."
"I'm sure he won't," he said.
He looked up. Yinsen stared down at him, eyebrows high on his forehead.
Saturday was beautiful and warm, with clear blue skies. Before Tony could slip away to Pepper's, he was cornered by Sharon.
It would take too long to return to the manor for a horse—the town, and the town’s doctor, was in the opposite direction. Tony ran his hand through his hair, considering. Baronet Fury’s mansion was on the way—if he stopped in to borrow a horse from him, that wouldn’t delay him too badly, and it would be faster than running the entire two miles.
back. "Won't your father be pleased to have you back at his side after all these years?"
you?" She didn't sound disbelieving, merely curious. "You're favoring your right side."
"Mr. Jarvis was the one—"
Captain Rogers made a low noise. "I'd be surprised," he said. "Lord Stark has never been one for settling down."
in London are hardly a secret."
me, sir,” he said. “An upstanding university graduate like myself, a bad influence? I am a
“As it happens, I am,” she said. “What of it?”
"He's told me that his mother is ill enough that she can no longer work and that his acts of thievery were to provide food for himself and his younger sister." Tony said it all lightly, but he kept his eyes focused on Toomes. He saw the way he grimaced. "Were you aware of his circumstances?"
He waited for her nod before he raced out of the house, running faster than he had since he was twelve years old.
He was proud of the way his voice didn't skip on Captain Rogers' name. He still couldn't look him in the eye, could hardly allow himself to focus on him, so he turned his attention to Barnes.
He'd gone out in just his undershirt, not even a jacket or a cravat. He spared a moment to wonder if she was disconcerted at all to converse with an unknown man so underdressed; if she was, she didn't show it. She herself was dressed as if she were going to a ball in full skirts and a little cape.
She just inclined her head. He offered her his arm and led her into a surprisingly full and boisterous parlor.
"Um." The boy fumbled. Tony waited for him to speak. "Mr. Stark, it's, uh. I'm Peter, Peter Parker? I'm a tailor's apprentice down in—sorry, that's not. Um. They told me I shouldn't bother to come but everyone says the Starks are who we're supposed to talk to when things happen except there hasn't been a Stark around to talk to until now, by which I mean you, obviously, and—"
Tony kept up the easy smile as he was examined by an extremely suspicious child. Luckily, his years of practice maintaining a facade were coming in handy; if he could fool his father and his peers at school, it was small potatoes to fool a boy who didn't even know him. Harley relaxed a little.
Captain Rogers' hands clenched and unclenched. "I don't see why you'd lower yourself to visit a peasant's grave, Lord Stark," he said, all ice. "You've made your feelings about our differences
“I have never in my life been able to get you stop something you’d set your mind on,” she said. “Where are you going to stay, then? The Manor?”
He managed to get over to it fine, but the back seat was high enough that he would have to jump to get on it. He stared at it, feeling the back of his neck and ears begin to flush. His ankle throbbed and pain reverberated down his leg as he shifted his stance. If he tried to jump on his own, his ankle would give way and he'd be flat on his face in the dirt again, of that he was sure. And yet, the thought of having to ask any of the others for a boost into the carriage made him balk - he was no child. He could do this himself. He gritted his teeth and prepared himself for the pain that was sure to come as he braced his legs for a jump—
Tony swallowed. He could go oversee the carriage being put away. He could go upstairs immediately to begin preparations for the children's bedrooms or duck into the kitchens to grab something to eat since he'd missed dinner or—
Tony offered a salute, trying not to show how much this new version of Barnes unsettled him and how little he wanted him to see Tony when he was still vulnerable and hurt.
Peggy straightened. "Oh! You must have some opinion on these so-called steam engine trains, then," she said, her face bright with interest. "I've read so many differing opinions in the papers, it'd be nice to hear from someone who might actually understand what's going on. Do you think they're going to ruin society as we know it, as everyone's claiming?"
Yinsen cocked his head. "Would it bother you if I said yes?"
“There’s me and Rhodey,” Tony said.
The long explanation to Jarvis had been unpleasant, but they had worked things out between them. Jarvis would make inquiries in town about additional staff that afternoon and Tony, well—Tony walked the house.
Tony quickly sketched an equation on a little slip of parchment feeling, as he usually did, a deep sense of satisfaction, almost peace at penning the little formula. He finished the last number and admired it for a moment before passing it to Sousa.
“So let me get this straight.” Sir Fury crossed his arms over his chest, eyebrows high on his forehead. Between his bulk and the black eyepatch he perpetually wore, he always looked intimidating. However, there was the tiniest twitch at the corner of his mouth undermined that a little at the moment. “You want to come stay with me at my manor, which you made a point to never step foot in despite living only three miles away for eighteen years?”
Tony considered it. He didn't think it was any more likely than Pepper did; Steve's sense of obligation, always iron-clad, would make him attend no matter his true feelings on the matter.
Tony made a face at her blatant betrayal. "I didn't have any use for the
Mrs. Barnes, patiently waiting through his contemplation, seemed to sense his reluctance. She reached over and took him firmly by the elbow.
"You could write me your own letter telling me that you don't believe there's anything to worry about. Then you would be following in your father's footsteps."
The others were talking, but Tony didn't pay them much mind. He was making contingency plans for the visit at the Wilson house - perhaps he could entice Miss Wilson to a game of some sort to distract the others or find something that needed doing or fixing in another room while the others visited. The thought of being shut in the same space as Captain Rogers without a sufficient exit strategy was enough to give him palpitations.
Tony nodded and turned away as Toomes stormed out of the room, well aware that he'd made an enemy today. He didn't regret it; Tony had been making enemies since he was six and stole a pie from the bakery, but few had felt quite as necessary as this one.
"You're very quiet," Tony said, narrowing his eyes. "
Silence stretched between them, heavy and taunt. Tony's heartbeat kicked up and his stomach twisted into a hard, uncomfortable knot. He needed to say something. Anything. But he could barely focus under the weight of Captain Rogers' blue stare, his steady presence. Sweat broke out along his neck.
“Lord Stark—”
“I never thought I’d be grateful for your odd hours,” Pepper said. “I’m not sure what I would have done if you hadn’t come by to check on me so early.”
"Like overkill." When Bella scowled, Tony sighed. "It feels fine. Are you done coddling me now?"
Across the table one of the other single men - Farnsworth, Tony thought his name was - laughed too.
"You." Rhodey's mouth hung open, eyes wide as the moon. "
Lit candles added a soft glow to the room and the moon shone in through the line of windows on the outer wall. Tony's shoulders dropped as he walked around, taking a leisurely look through the bookcases. His father had purchased most of the books on the shelves. Tony smiled as he came across a small, well-worn copy of Donne. He took it out and examined the broken spine, wondering who had spent so much time reading it; he knew that he'd never cracked it open when he was a boy.
anything," Captain Rogers said. "You ran away."
Tony had long since developed the skill of taking in information even when he wasn’t truly listening to what was happening. It had helped him enormously at Cambridge, when he’d been more preoccupied with his designs than his classes, but it had always exasperated professors (and Pepper) who thought they could catch him daydreaming with little tricks like that.
Obie had managed to convince Howard of the merits just barely. Perhaps his father would have sent letter after letter heckling Tony to return, reminding Tony of his proper future, if Tony’s mother hadn’t died from a sudden illness only six months after he’d left home.
Peggy inclined her head toward Captain Rogers. "He's never called you Tony before," she said.
In his hands, the little wooden shield, sword, and two helmets - one painted a faded red, the other a milky blue - were tiny. It boggled the mind that the red helmet had once been big enough to slip down Tony's nose whenever he put it on, forcing him to constantly adjust it just to see.
"No can do." The words came out in a rush, one on top of the other. Peggy blinked, obviously surprised, but Captain Rogers didn't so much as twitch at the outburst. His face was stoic once more, not even the minute signs of surprise Tony had noticed there anymore. Who had taught him to have such a poker face? "I haven't been home in some time either; I'm afraid I wouldn't be much use as a guide. Besides, I do believe if I don't make use of the nearest bathtub, your aunt won't let me sit at the dinner table. I'll be out eating with the dogs instead."
"Have you
." Tony scowled down at his little teacup. He loathed tea. "We don't owe each other anything. Peggy is lovely."
about people.”
The boy tensed. His head lowered further.
Tony smiled at her and her mouth ticked up just a hint. "Poetry gets its beauty from all of these things," he said. "Composition, image, word choice and, yes, even rhythm." He grinned as Dugan pointed a triumphant finger at Farnsworth. "How a poet uses all of those things together, that's what makes it beautiful - to those of us who give a damn about it, anyway."
He tapped the paper. "Well, mathematics is the same. Here, look—" He pointed to each aspect as he explained, using the visual aid to make his point. "See the five mathematical constants - 1, 0, pi and e, both irrational numbers, and i, the square root of -1, the fundamental imaginary number."
"Sir Fury—"
"—am happy to have you visit any night."
Yinsen blinked. "Excuse me?"
His father had written.
There was the rush of feet on the ground and Tony lifted his head to find four faces looking down at him with varying levels of concern. He forced down his embarrassed blush; half of them had seen him do much worse things than fall down on flat ground.
"He was too damn small to start so many fights," Rhodey said against Tony's neck. "But he's not small now, Tones. He hurt you."
“Let me up,” he said when he felt something approaching normal again.
"I don't want to convince him! He's a mean old sod and—"
." Captain Rogers stepped forward again. The tall breadth of him wasn't intimidating but it was overpowering. Tony held his ground. "Were you and Pepper courting? Did you propose to her?"
"You have to know—" Captain Rogers voice was low and pained. He cleared his throat. "I've always cared about you."
He ignored the burn building at the back of his eyes. "I know, Pep," he said softly. "Me too."
Fury steered Tony further into the room. Tony wasn't usually shy, but he couldn't help but be aware that if these
him, Tony. He's being so distant with you because you lashed out at him and he thinks you—I don't know, toyed with his affections! He doesn't think you care for him at all and that you didn't back then either. He deserves to know that's not true!"
"She's
Yinsen considered that. "Thank you," he said.
Of course Fury cut right to the heart of the matter. How did he always just
"He is rather pleasing," she admitted.
"Excellent." He stepped forward and offered Peggy his arm with a brilliant smile. Tony's heart clenched and he looked away, down at the grass, until he felt like he could keep his expression under control. "Shall we?"
Tony kept his distance, wary of another box to the ears, and sighed. “Mrs. Killian seems to be having a troublesome pregnancy,” he said more seriously. “With Rhodey out in London, I’m the only one she’s got, God help her. I just need someplace to stay until she’s settled and then I’ll be on my way to London.”
Pepper did an about-face as she looked back at Yinsen with her sweetest smile. Yinsen blinked at her. He had a good poker face; Tony couldn’t tell at all what he was thinking beneath that placid mask of his. He glanced Tony’s way once, then seemed to make up his mind.
Tony was brought back to the present by a persistent pain. He looked down and winced, uncurling the first he’d made around the little charm. He’d clenched it so tightly it had left deep indents in his palm, angry red lines that began to fade as he released the pressure. Tony stared at the tiny charm. It was a piece of trash, really. Barely worth whatever Captain Rogers had paid for it, a ill-made knick-knack to amuse a child.
Sousa hummed. "Less so. He's much happier here than I expected him to be. Or—maybe not
Tony didn't exactly want to start a fist-fight at a dinner table. But he could hardly let something so horrific pass without saying
"Not quite. You show no interest in the town itself, not what I'd expect from someone gathering information for a group of thieves. I rather doubt someone trying to pretend to be innocent would have asked about the rumors in the first place. And..." Yinsen smiled, tiny and wry. "I find it difficult to believe someone so devoted to a childhood friend would be ruthless enough to pillage his own people."
Her eyes narrowed. Tony didn't think his mask had cracked but she'd seen the way her words landed anyway. What a scary woman.
The little town on the edge of the forest had grown considerably since Tony’s childhood, turning from a sleepy two-horse village to a bustling area with several shops and storefronts. Luckily, it was still small enough that it was almost impossible to get turned around. The shops were all closed up now, the streets empty and quiet. The sun had fully risen, but it was still quite early.
"Just until your mother's better," Tony said agreeably. "How's that sound? I get you out of this, you come and help me look after my friend Pepper."
“Not even the family heirlooms!” Tony said and dodged a clap to the ear with a laugh. “Just some plain, regular old silverware will do it for me!”
Hm. Tony considered Parker's honest, righteous outrage. A good-hearted kid who didn't know the meaning of subtlety. Tony could feel the weight of that little journal in his breast pocket. He could use someone like Mr. Parker in his corner. A little back-up from a place no thief would think to look.
flowers." Tony's heart turned over. "We didn't know what else to do for decorations," he added to Mrs. Barnes, a little abashed.
"It's not enough that you're facing him tonight, you have to spend every moment torturing yourself on what he else he might have done to crush your heart further?"
Barnes swung around to look at Tony, a concentrated head-to-toe inspection that made Tony want to squirm. What? Tony straightened under the attention, then forced himself to slouch, ignoring the pull on his bruise.
. My father's old schoolmate is the captain. They're not friends - Howard doesn't have friends, too plebian - but they get along all right. I knew he'd take them in if Howard wrote him, gave them his blessing."
thank you for all the encouragement and support for this story! I really appreciate it and it keeps me trucking along!!
Tony carefully put the book back. "You've left your guests to fend for themselves, then? Not very hostess-like. Miss Manners would have a thing or two to say to you."
“Take my horse,” Fury said. “Goose is the fastest there is.”
"You set her—" Captain Rogers shook his head. "Why would you even want to visit? There's no need."
For a moment, the Captain's hand tightened, the heat of his palm like a brand. His pinky finger curled into the vulnerable bend of Tony's elbow, exposed by his rolled up shirtsleeves. Tony's skin shivered at the unexpected, delicate touch.
Her face brightened. "I
Still, his determination for independence didn't stop his relief when a carriage came down the road and slowed next to them, revealing Fury and Bella. Tony could have crumpled to the ground in thanks.
"You really don't have to call me ma'am, Captain."
“Nobody
"Tony!"
"Oh," he said. "So you want me to work for you?"
"Yes! I understand!"
If he walked slowly enough, he might be able to miss the visit altogether. Tony could only hope.
He offered the stack to Tony. Tony reached out but before he could take it, Yinsen trapped his hands.
Oh, God. Tony's stomach dropped. He needed an excuse, any excuse, but he couldn't think of anything. Useless, useless brain.
"It means that if there's a sad little stray around to pick up, you somehow inevitably sniff it out and adopt it, Stark. You're a soft touch. You always have been."
Tony had stored it away as something to look at. He didn’t remember there being a thief problem when he was a boy, but the river town had grown significantly in the past several years according to Pepper. He’d have to talk to Obie about it. Perhaps they could get some men stationed on the road to ward them off, or at least have someone in town to keep an eye on the shops. The new tenant might even have some ideas if he was a military man.
do. There's a fine line between those two, that's where you want to be."
"Your eyes are getting too big for your stomach," Fury said. Tony couldn't look at him and couldn't decipher his tone. "He hasn't proposed yet."
The kid kept up as best he could, though. He leaned over to look at Tony's schematics and asked questions about the different parts that Tony pointed out. It wasn't until Tony was talking about the new kind of metal he wanted to introduce to make the engine lighter that he noticed his attention drifting. He frowned, straightening from where he'd been bent over the table.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I found someone on the road," Mrs. Barnes said.
“Of course they’re welcome. I’ll spend tomorrow saying our farewells to the tenants and be packed by the next morning.”
Tony grimaced as Sharon tried to help him to his feet. His foot didn't want to leave the hole and the jolt to his ankle nearly made him cry out. He bit his tongue.
"Rumors? How
just realized as i was putting the finishing touches on this that it's tony's birthday today. let's all pretend that was the plan all along.
“Mrs. Killian is severely ill,” he snapped. “She needs a doctor and quickly. It's faster to ride than run and you’re on the way there.”
"I'm just fine," Tony told them. "A little fall is nothing, I fall all the time."
, Pep. I couldn’t hate it.” He sighed. “I’m just tired of knocking over ant hills every time I turn around. Cambridge doesn’t have so many blasted ghosts.”
"One of us should stay behind with you—"
Tony was glad to be in the back, mostly facing away from the Furys. He couldn't imagine what his face looked like at that moment and he didn't have the strength to summon up a pleasant mask. It was far easier to modify his voice.
"Lieutenant," he said. "Fancy meeting you here."
"Uh," he said and cursed himself when it made the tiny smile disappear. "We'd better—I mean, they're leaving us behind. Better keep up."
The room was dim and cool; the curtain had been pulled, but the window was open and letting in a breeze. Pepper sat in the bed. The sheets must have been changed at some point while Yinsen was in with her, for there was no sign of any blood. Pepper was pale and tight-lipped, but she smiled when Tony came in.
Tony recoiled. "I don't think
"Eh." Tony waved a hand. "I think I've gotten too used to my little apartment at Cambridge. This place has too many rooms for me now. The Barneses are welcome to it."
He knew Fury wasn't convinced, but Fury was the kind of suspicious that made armed officers look at ease. He leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms over his chest, and surveyed Tony keenly. Tony tried to ignore it by drinking more of his coffee.
"Well." He sounded a little less on edge. "I guess it's kind of the same thing, isn't it?"
Tony shifted again. Saying the pain was mostly gone wasn't really true - standing on his ankle was still mightily uncomfortable. But he was hardly going to admit that.
"You two have been friends for a while, I take it?"
Tony's scowl deepened. What a devious woman, he thought with begrudging respect. How she'd known that Tony would hide away his injuries was anyone's guess, but she'd selected a practical method of preventing him from doing so and making herself look even more compassionate in Bella's eyes.
Tony couldn't do this anymore. "Well," he said and shoved the sword back at Captain Rogers. "As neat as this trip down memory lane has been, it sounds like we've worn out our welcome. You can keep these - burn them, throw them away, whichever you like. I'd better go find the others. Mrs. Barnes, Captain."
"Inside. Yes."
“Still don’t like it when I’m nice to the servants, J?” he asked.
What could Tony tell her? That the sheer thought made him want to wither away and die, that seeing them together was a lance in a wound that had never truly healed over? Peggy was a genteel young woman who deserved a good husband; Captain Rogers, in turn, deserved a wife who would support him and who could give him everything he deserved. Tony would never be able to be that person and he'd known it even as he'd been swept away in the whirlwind of Captain Rogers' regard.
Tony bopped him gently on the head. "Don't call him that. And we
Tony snorted at the same time Barnes did. Tony looked over and caught him rolling his eyes.
Despite the warnings from Yinsen, Fury, Bella, and practically everyone in Shield Hall (including a disgruntled Harley, who threatened to sit on him in punishment) Tony went into town only two days after his fall. He took a carriage most of the way, stopping to check on Mrs. Keener. She looked much better than she had even the previous week. It wouldn't be long until Harley and Lucy could go home again.
"You'd be surprised. We went to see doctors. All of them suggested the same thing - rest, plenty of exercise, and peace. Most of all, they suggested peace." She sighed. "That is part of why we came back here. To try and help recover his memories."
He'd sent the children home ahead of him an hour into the whole procedure; Harley had been interested in watching Tony mess around, but Lucy had grown bored quickly and Pepper wasn't really up to babysitting fidgety children. At least she hadn't protested when Tony had introduced Harley as her new errand boy. She'd simply given him an assessing look and then started explaining some of the chores that would need doing around the house. Tony could have kissed her for her discretion; Harley had relaxed more and more as she'd kept listing out things that needed doing, clearly happy to be put to use.
"Miss Carter tells me you've been spending almost all your free time with her."
Pepper snorted. “Was it manly dignity I saw on your face whenever I beat you at cricket? I could have sworn those were tears."
"Uncle's just being suspicious," Peggy said with an eagle eye turned on Fury. Fury looked indifferent to it. "He can't imagine why anyone would want to actually get to know their neighbors, considering he's avoided his for so many years."
"I thought he should know," he said. "Besides, he's Rhodey. He's better at this kind of thing than me, I needed advice."
"Undeniably. Do you need help returning to Shield Manor?"
Tony stared down at the kid. Why did he sound like he was issuing some kind of challenge?
"Anything else you want me to do, madam?" Tony asked. "You're pretty keen to give me orders."
(See the end of the chapter for
Captain Rogers surveyed them, arms tucked in the small of his back. His face was flinty, eyes cold. Tony forced himself to meet that look with indifference, even sardonic amusement; he raised an eyebrow and offered a smile. Captain Rogers' brow furrowed.
"Well," Sharon said with mock severity, "young Mr. Keener made off with some bread from the kitchens last night."
“Master Tony.”
acting like that - but it seems like everyone is giving me some nasty stares. Now I know I tore up some gardens and probably stole more apples than I should've as a child, but considering that was ten years ago it seems petty to hold a grudge." Tony watched Yinsen's face as he chattered on, catching when he winced. "Or is there something else I've done I just don't know about? It's been a while since I've drunk enough to forget what I've done the next day, but maybe—"
Tony didn't like the way Sousa looked at him, like he was staring right into Tony's tumultuous inner world where he was both tenderly overjoyed by Steve chattering on about him when he was a young man and wounded to his core to think that their falling out had ruined Steve in such a fundamental way. He wished he could attribute it to something else but he knew better. Having your heart torn to shreds changed a person. Tony had known that and done it anyway. He'd decided Steve's feelings weren't as important as other things and he'd ended things between them knowing full well that his rejection would change Steve's future, Steve's outlook on life. Tony had done that and he'd carried the burden of that choice for six years.
Her smile widened. "I think," she told her husband in a particular tone of voice, "it would do you both some good."
After dinner - thankfully he'd passed inspection and was allowed at the table, even if listening to Sharon and Peggy giggle about her walk was nigh on unbearable - Tony tried to go back to his room and work some more. It turned out to be impossible. An itch began under his skin, uncertainty turning into restless energy that he couldn't dispel no matter what he tried to distract himself with.
clear."
"If I take the boy in, no more thievery. If I help his mother get well so she can work, no more thievery." Tony knew his voice was too hard, his face too angry, but he couldn't quite keep it hidden anymore. "If you
Some time to himself would be good, he thought.
Rhodey's eyes flickered over Tony's shoulder. "This and that. Introduce me to your friends, Tones."
“Argument, call it an argument,” Tony muttered under his breath, willfully ignoring the glare Pepper turned on him.
? Rhodey?”
“I’ve never once lost at cricket and you well know it, Tony Stark!”
He smiled, bright and wide, and sauntered up the drive with his shoulders back and head held high.
The last thing Tony wanted to do  was talk about the old days. Even thinking about them was painful. But he could hardly deny Peggy’s bright-eyed enthusiasm, especially not with Fury standing so close, watching everything. The last thing Tony wanted, especially with Barnes and his wife settling into the community, was any undue gossip resurfacing about Tony’s relationship to Captain Rogers. He'd given up too much to make sure there hadn't been a whisper of everything that had happened between them.
“If their offer is good, accept them,” he said.
"Is there anyone else in your house?" Tony asked when Harley didn't speak. "A father or brothers? Sisters?"
Tony gave her a disbelieving look. "He's been there every day, Pepper. If they aren't engaged by the end of the month, he'll shock every person in the area, myself included."
"All right," he said. "Come on, Stark. Let's get you back before the sun comes up."
Tony breathed in, breathed out. "He said." He swallowed. "He said if I went through with it, he'd withdraw his support from Captain Rogers publicly. He'd whisper just the right kind of depraved lies in just the right ears. The Captain's reputation in the Navy would be ruined, his future and livelihood gone."
"All right, all right," Tony said gruffly. "Put a lid on the hysterics, will you? Wait until I've actually done something, then you can thank me."
He wrapped his arms around his waist, trying to anchor himself. "What was I supposed to say, Pep? Don't mind me, I just broke the heart of the only person I've ever loved?"
They both looked at Rhodey. "Don't call him that," Tony said as Pepper nodded vigorously.
The terse order for Tony to come to London hadn’t been a surprise. Tony had been waiting for that for years. No, what utterly flummoxed Tony was this business of letting out Stark Manor.
"You'll really come?" he asked.
Pepper let out an annoyed breath. Thankfully, she set the needles aside and turned her full attention to Tony with a thunderous frown.
The door opened. Tony's heart kicked into overdrive. Two figures were outlined by the light, tall and broad. Oh, no. No, no, no.
Bella raised her eyebrows. "Cooper delivered a letter to my chambers this morning from Mrs. Natasha Barnes," she said. "She mentioned that you had suffered a fall late last night and she was worried you might have injured yourself more than you said at the time."
"Hm." Yinsen didn't look like he believed Tony. "Well, I don't. Believe it, that is. At least, not about you."
"Do I?"
Rhodey laughed and dragged Tony closer to ruffle his hair. "Let it go? You're kidding, right? When I die, I want my tombstone to read, here lies James Rhodes, he was best friends with Tony Stank."
?" She seemed to realize how clear her own disbelief was; she flushed and stammered a little. "I mean
He closed his eyes. He wished for sleep, but it took its time to come.
He was a young man, not even 18 if Tony had to guess, with dark hair and rough, worn clothes. He straightened to attention when he saw Tony like he was facing an admiral. Tony bit down on a smile.
"Happy Hogan?" Captain Rogers asked. He sounded confused. "The smithy?"
Tony blinked, taken aback. He'd expected questions about his relationship to Captain Rogers; surely Barnes had told his wife what had happened between them when they'd decided to stay in the manor. Or perhaps he hadn't? But he had no idea why she'd be interested enough to ask about renting the manor more than once. Shouldn't Coulson have already informed them about that?
"No complaints," she said. "James is recovering well here, I think." He felt her eyes on him but he kept his attention on the books, restlessly prowling up and down the shelves and pulling ones out at random. "How is Mrs. Killian?"
Rhodey's lack of greeting to Captain Rogers was noticeable; Tony noticed Sousa and Peggy exchanging raised eyebrows. The Captain, on the other hand, looked pained, his brow furrowed and mouth tight. Tony had no idea what caused it but he burrowed a little more into Rhodey's side. For some reason, that made Captain Rogers' jaw clench, nostrils flaring.
"Relax, kid." Tony tucked the letter into his breast pocket. "I'll make sure he gets it. Unless you want to come for a visit?"
"Father!" she called. "Father, Lord Stark is here to see you!"
She didn't blush or stammer. She smiled, a sly, coy expression that made her face almost foxlike.
Peggy grinned. "Is that why you two had your heads bent together so cozily the other day?" she asked. "Talking about
Or perhaps he could claim an emergency, somehow. If he dashed off a note to Harley once they arrived, he could arrive within the hour on foot, make some excuse about Pepper's condition, and get out of there in one piece—
, honestly."
"I see." Tony tried to crack a smile. "And they think I'm taking a cut too, is that it?"
"Am I?"
He swallowed several times. "What's your take on it?"
“God, Pep,” he said. “You’ve been holding out on your own all this time? Doesn't he have any family to help?"
thank you for the kind response! it's been fun to see reactions to this fic & that keeps me chugging along.
“Tony,” she said. Her voice was sharp enough to drag Tony from his work. He looked up at her. “They’ve moved in. The Barnes couple.”
"We've hardly seen you this week!" she said, folding her hand into his elbow. "You
"Feast your eyes on this."
The head came up further. "How do you know about that?"
It had been something just for them. While the others would join in from time to time, it had mostly been just Captain Rogers and Tony, together because they'd liked each other best. The thought was tender as a bruise. Tony flinched away from it.
“Dully noted, Sir” Jarvis said.
When Steve came back to himself, it took a few moments for his eyes to adjust after the blinding light from the Vita Rays receded, the searing pain that made him feel as if his very bones were melting also faded. He had woken up a new man, a better man. Not a soldier but a good man, Erskine had said. He had woken up ready to do good by others, to fight the bullies and protect the little guy, to defend those who couldn't defend or fight for themselves. And after feeling useless for most of his life, sick and barely able to make a living, Steve had been given a purpose.
"You're his papa." Tony said as if that was an obvious answer.
Tony stared at the kitten and she stared right back at him in what was their second staring contest, this time Tony was lying on his belly on the carpet, leaning his head on one of his arms as he reached out with his free hand, ignoring the mild warning hiss when he got to close. Very slowly, he reached to touch the kitten and scratch behind her ears and under her chin, smiling as the little thing closed her eyes, purring like a happy little engine.
T’Challa looked up and saw his lover looking at him, blinking owlishly and sleepily, barely moving, surely he wanted to avoid disturbing the other cats.
“Is Tony up?”
Steve didn't know for how long he was there but the pain didn't go away like other times. The tears seemed endless as they blurred his view and ran hot down his cheeks and no matter how many times he breathed he still couldn't get enough air into his lungs. He felt as if he was back into the ice, the freezing water all around him and getting into his lungs; he felt like drowning.
“Papa is going to get some food and meanwhile you and I can take a nap, how does that sound?” Tony spoke softly to the kid, who nodded and snuggled up closer to him.
Rhodey held his hands up in surrender and resumed the search.
And that did it. Tony cooed at him and wrapped his arms around the kid, hugging him to his chest and rubbing his back, while Clint rubbed his nose and earned himself a smack o the back of the head from Natasha, her cold glare made him shut his mouth.
Their security consisted in a very balanced system between technology and human efforts. T’Challa had the Dora Milaje and Tony had Jarvis. The Dora loved and cared for Tony as much as Jarvis loved and cared for the king, even though T’Challa had a bit of a hard time understanding that at first because it was an AI. Due to their status both as King, business man and avengers, to keep themselves and their loved ones safe was their priority which meant there was always someone looking for them at all times, with Jarvis being the ever present eye that saw everything while the Dora Milaje took turns both to work, rest and train. So T’Challa wasn’t surprised when he found one of his guards, this time Okoye, standing by the door that gave to the living room, her dark eyes quickly spotting him and he greeted her softly when she bowed her head slightly.
“Okay, I won’t, I promise” Steve smiled nonetheless, content that Tony had at least agreed to try.
“No kiss mama!”
"You took him to a meeting with you?" Steve asked, terribly amused by the mental image of their tiny son in a formal business meeting among people dressed in sharp, pristine suits while wearing his Thor pjs. "And he didn't get bored?" Steve knew SI meetings could last for hours depending on the issues they had to go through. Peter usually spent that time at home with Steve.
Steve felt himself smiling fondly at that. Happy wanted to appear tough but he just melted like ice cream around Peter, and no matter how much he grumbled at being put on babysitter duty, Steve had seen him play with Peter for hours.
“I will see you for lunch” T’Challa said, pressing a kiss on Vela’s cheek before turning up to his husband, pressing a soft kiss on his lips only to hear a whimper and a chubby hand pushing at his cheek. The little girl grabbed at Tony’s cheek to tilt his head so he would kiss her.
“Okay, okay” Steve smiled at his husband and leaned down over the couch to press a kiss to Tony’s lips “You want Chinese, right?” he asked, his lips brushing warmly over Tony’s own.
“Honey… I need you to do me a favor” Tony could barely recognize his own voice.
"Papa!" Steve looked down and spotted Peter, still holding his plush toy and wearing a big pout.
Someone touched him but he barely felt it, as if his senses were numb and everything was closing up on him. The feeling of despair and pain were too overwhelming for him to be able to focus on anything else, they wrapped around his throat like snakes trying to suffocate their prey, and they were winning.
"Maybe wait until he wasn't looking." Steve whispered against Tony's lips, pulling away from the kiss only so he could hug him tight, holding him against his chest.
“Maybe I should call you Hulk Jr” Tony chuckled, wrapping a soft towel around the hissy kitten while carefully drying him before setting him back with his siblings, who welcomed him with playful pounces and purrs.
It was only a matter of time for everything to start taking its toll on his health. Tony hadn’t tended his wounds properly, not allowing any doctor to assess his condition further than the cuts and bruises on his face and the pending concussion, he hadn’t let anyone see the massive bruising on his chest or the cracked ribs that were left there after Steve smashed his shield against it, instead he had thrown himself to work through exhaustion, not giving himself time to rest, to think, he had so much to do, so many things that needed his fully attention. Tony worked days on end barely eating, and only because Friday kept reminding him; he lost weight, he had bags under his eyes and his skin lost a bit of its healthy color but he achieved so many things; he was making the accords better, he was helping recruit and train the new superheroes, he had sent the blue prints and designs for Barnes’ new arm to T’Challa so they’d start constructing it, he was working and improving BARF to make it a viable cure for whatever Hydra brainwashing and mind control still remained on Steve’s dear friend’s brain aiming to successfully cure him and help him to have a new, better life.
“Not a chance, Cap, we’ll be fine right here, besides, Petey looks about to fall asleep and I’ll be damned if I let you clowns screw with his sleep schedule again” Tony hummed as he lied comfortably on the couch with a little boy curled up on his chest, sucking on his thumb and blinking slower each time and Tony thought, hopefully, he would fall asleep, then maybe Tony would take a nap too, and yeah, it took having a child for Tony to have a more stable sleep schedule. And that thing books said about ‘take advantage to sleep when your kid sleeps’ was totally true.
“How soon?”
"No, it was—"
“You think that matters? You’ll always be Miss Potts to me.”
Pepper and Tony exchanged surprised looks. They’d shouted that in unison at a startled Yinsen. Pepper immediately went sheepish, eyebrows drawing down.
“No longer in danger. But I must insist—if you want to know anything else, you must ask Mrs. Kilian herself.”
you drive yourself back?" She examined him from head to toe, so critically that Tony almost shifted from foot to foot like a guilty school boy. He forced himself to straighten. "Perhaps I should
Tony nearly closed his eyes at the long pause that drifted between them. He wanted, with a physical ache, to see Captain Rogers' face at that precise moment.
“Miss Hill,” Fury said to a severe woman with dark hair standing just outside of the parlor. “Go and tell Simmons we have a new house guest and the housemaids that they should prepare the Blue Room. Lord Stark will be staying with us for a few weeks.”
“I asked him not to.”
"You can't seriously—"
“A few young people were interested, yes, but—”
"Tony."
? He loved it, silly child. He used to tell my husband all about the new things you would build whenever we stopped by. He was very proud when you left for Cambridge."
"Your friend went out on quite a limb for you," Tony said. "I imagine he's not going to be in Mr. Toomes' good graces after tonight. It's hardly going to help in his suit of the man's daughter, I suspect."
“Young Peter fell asleep in the studio, Vision is in his room and boss is currently in his lab, Colonel” Friday’s voice spoke with ease, she didn’t take a second too long without responding to his question, indicating there were no abnormalities.
"Please." The words that came from Steve's mouth could barely be understood in his desperate effort to breathe.
“Mh… What are you doing here?”
“No”.
"... Steve?"
Right there then there was nothing of that man, in that room lied a broken hearted man, soulless  and tearing apart at the seams. He had tried to give hope when he had none, he couldn't see the silver linings right then, all he could feel was crippling, soul-shattering pain. His world crumbled down on him the moment he saw the life leaving his eyes as he held him. His future, his hope, his love was gone. How could he possibly go on after that? Where was he supposed to draw his strength from? How was he supposed to move on if he missed what he had so much he could barely function on a good day?
“You’re a grumpy one” Tony declared but there was no heat in his voice or tension in his features “In your defense, I would be angry too if I were all alone in a place I didn’t know, and of course, Spangles brought you and got all on your face, didn’t he?” he hummed, holding a finger out in front of the kitten and letting her sniff at him first, he consider it a small victory when he felt the tiny sandpaper-like tongue on the tip of his finger “He can get a bit overbearing but you can always scratch his nose”.
Then there was Steve, the epitome of perfection to many eyes; righteous, fit, holier-than-thou who thought he made no mistakes, that everything he did was right, the very same man who had scolded Tony for hiding and causing the whole Ultron mess when he himself had been lying to Tony’s face for years, and it hadn’t been something as simple as to not liking the color of the walls but the truth about the death of Tony’s parents.
