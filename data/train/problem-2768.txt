Dark eyes glittered.
Cas took another breath. And another.
Usually he would thrive on a night like tonight and live on the high it gave him for at least a couple of days after, but not tonight. Tonight he was distracted and he couldn’t shake it off. It was like he’d been sleepwalking for so long, and someone had woken him up and he was expected to just carry on like normal.
"Cas isn't the reason that we can't be together. Don't keep Jack hostage just to get back at him. Cas - he's done nothing wrong. He's hurting more than any of us and he needs his kid back. I need… I need Jack back too. He's my kid too, Amara. Please, let him go."
True to his word, it seemed that Dean really was going to leave him be.
"You look about as distracted as you did when I asked for the rings earlier. But you’re not quite as dewy eyed about it this time."
"I'm just saying things
"Because you love Dean," Eileen stated matter-of-factly.
"I don't think it was just his face she was painting."
"You chose Easy Lover here - and damn the consequences," Gabriel argued. "And that's fine. It's not like we were under any illusions as to how you feel about this Big Hunk of Love, and really, who could blame ya?"
“Right. I think you should go home now. You can see for yourself that Cas is likely going to be fine, and I can sit with him until he falls asleep. You can't do anything to help.”
He missed Cas. It had been eight days since Dean had seen him. Eight days since he’d been able to accidentally on purpose brush their knees together under a table or even just shoot the breeze over a beer. He couldn't keep his mind focused on anything else without it wandering off to the way those beautiful, big eyes darkened like a storm was coming every single time Dean had even got close to kissing him. The way he'd let out these tiny moans when Dean had kissed his neck. The way his hips had pressed hard against Dean's, unconsciously seeking him out, trying to get closer.
"Do I strike you as the poetry type?"
. But-"
"Why don't you taste for yourself?" His eyes glinted, his eyebrow arched, his entire focus on Dean's mouth, hot and wet around his fingers.
"You can always whisper them in my ear," Cas whispered hotly into Dean's own ear, sending a shudder of need through him. What would happen if Cas ever actually touched him properly, he wasn't sure. Some sort of cataclysmic, world-wide event, with his implosion at the centre of it, if what these small touches were doing to him was anything to go by.
“Bite,” finished Cas in a whisper, as if speaking loudly when he was like this was an unwritten transgression, like shouting in Church. "I remember, and I think we established that you
"Go to sleep. I promise I'll be here when you wake up."
"What, Cas?"
"Yes, Dean?"
"There's nothing left in there anymore. Jack's explosion woke everyone up, and the noise was driving the Empty to insanity. So Jack made it a deal. It doesn't get any more souls, every soul it did have was set free, and The Empty has eternal peace."
"Dean, could you stop humming? Or at least try a different tune? Please?"
When Dean arrived back at the Bunker Garth, Bess and the kids had already gone home, but everyone else was still there, chatting, drinking, reminiscing. He'd already sat out in the car in the garage for thirty minutes in the hopes that his red eyes would become unnoticeable. Sitting there, he'd found himself scrolling through his phone, looking up properties for sale, of all things. Now he stood in the doorway watching them, the people he counted as family.
“How was
Dean winked at Castiel.
“Clothes. You have to wear clothes. Both of you. All the time! I don’t care what you do behind closed doors but...” Sam sighed exasperatedly. “In the kitchen? C’mon.” He huffed, then left without another word.
“...Gabriel’s comic won the art show last year...”
The upstairs hallway was long and dark. A runner rug was lying cockeyed and the kids’ doors were open to the left. The EMF spiked right away in the corner of the small landing near the top of the stairs. Dean half expected to see a stain there, too, but the wallpaper looked new. Dean stopped in the middle of the hallway and looked up. A string hung from a square door leading to the attic. The EMF spiked there, and Dean decided he’d check that on his way back.
Sam broke out of Dean’s grip, grabbed his older brother, and pinned him to the floor just like he’d done all those years ago. Dean groaned. Sam was always the calm, rational one, which was probably why it was so damn sexy when he went into rut. He lost most of his control, going purely on instinct - it was Dean’s guiltiest pleasure.
“Sam...”
“Shut up,” Claire glared at him.
“I am,” Dean sipped his coffee. “I can have a look at the circuit board if you like. Unless you have to get to work?”
“No! We have to…”
It wasn’t so bad, actually.
They were out of time. A strange chill passed through them both. For a moment Castiel wondered if it was death. But then they both saw, as if through a tunnel, Mrs. Bishop rising up over them, staring down the creature that had destroyed her family. She screeched, and it raised his sledgehammer.
Crowley raised a brow at him, “That was a little too easy. Something on your mind?”
Castiel carried him the short distance to the war table, never once breaking that kiss, and sat Dean on the edge. Castiel pulled Dean's shirt off, revealing scared yet firm skin dusted with freckles. Dean quickly reciprocated, getting Castiel out of his coat. It fell right through Castiel's wings as if they weren't there, yet Dean could see them growing in size, puffing up like a stormy, frothy sea. He unbuttoned the top of Castiel's shirt and kissed the bare skin of Castiel's neck.
“F… fuck!” Sam breathed.
“Enough.” Dean’s voice shook. His gaze was fierce, but it hid something weak and uncertain.
“Sure. Just don’t ask me about sex, okay?”
“I mean, because of the way the shadows moved on the porch,” he said, trying to sound convincing. “The branches must have really been…”
“Dad, we need to call the cops,” Jack insisted.
Claire stared at them all. “How come I didn’t get to skip school? You picked them up but not me!”
Castiel ignored his struggles completely and ripped Dean’s pants down with ease, although he fumbled a little getting them around his boots. In another lifetime, Dean might have laughed. But he suddenly found himself naked from the hips down and didn’t feel much like laughing.
But Lucifer kept talking, burying Sam's cock down Castiel's throat and thrusting his hips.
Sam ravaged Dean like it was his first rut all over again. Only this time, Sam wasn’t inexperienced. His blind, greedy thrusts now had an edge of intent to them. He stroked up and down Dean’s seeping walls, stirring each and every little niche that had Dean unraveling into a horny, writhing mess on the floor. Dean had never moaned so hard in his life. At one point, he whimpered like Sam had in his sleep when Dean first sucked him. Dean would have been mortified if anyone but Sam heard it. Dean slammed his fist on the floor, bucking back into Sam and making him curse.
Dean gripped Ketch behind the thigh and by the ass, rising to the challenge with vigor. Dean prided himself on being an excellent fellator, and was rewarded with a series of not-so-Alpha sounds from Ketch. Dean undid his own pants and began stroking himself, unable to resist any longer.
“I’m skipping,” Gabe said, beginning to circle him like a dog after a treat.
Claire rolled her eyes. “Back to normal? When were we normal?”
Crowley smirked. He slipped a hand down Sam’s boxers and withdrew Sam’s flaccid cock. Sam watched hazily as Crowley maneuvered Sam’s cock and balls through the ring at the base of the cage, sliding it firmly up against Sam’s body.
Gabriel attached the collar to the seat so Sam could barely lift his head, and definitely couldn’t look behind him. He did the same to Sam’s wrists, so his hands where on either side his face and he couldn’t lower his arms. Gabriel was happy to see Sam’s back rising and falling with each shallow breath. Gabriel kicked Sam’s knees apart, then bound those, too. Sam couldn’t speak.
“Mr. Shurley?”
“Whozeewhatsisthere?” He snorted. In less time than it took Gabriel to appear, Dean was sitting up with the pillow on his lap, pointing a gun at his midnight visitor.
It was a nice house, Dean thought. He took another sip of coffee then scrunched down to see under the cabinet. He had to bend at a weird angle to get at the section of pipe he needed. Maybe he should’ve worn looser jeans afterall.
“No! Jack!” Claire exclaimed, laughing breathlessly. “You’re...choking me!”
After a few moments of contented silence, Dean frowned at his screen.
But Gabe snatched the newspaper out of his hand and leapt out of Charley’s reach.
His inner thighs were so sensitive. Even a light hit would have drawn a response out of him. How on Earth was he supposed to endure that? Not to mention his cock was so hard it was pushing out every thought in his head.
Sam smiled, then coughed. All of a sudden, he couldn’t stop coughing.
As he flipped through the papers, he spotted something startlingly familiar—a photograph of his new house. He read the first few words of the article below it, then stopped abruptly. His eyes flew back to the horticulture article, but he was no longer reading it. He was wide-eyed and pale, the words ‘deceased’ and ‘tragedy’ burned into his retinas. A morbid curiosity began to rise in him, outweighing his sense of dread, and he looked back at the article. But before he could read on, he felt someone poke him in the back. Charley nearly jumped out of his skin. He spun around angrily. He knew that poke.
As Castiel stepped into Dean’s room, he was glad to see Dean was conscious and talking to his nurse, a dark haired woman Castiel knew well. She gave Castiel a knowing look which Castiel remembered well. It was the ‘this one’s a handful’ look. Dean was clearly still drugged and was hitting on her. Castiel suppressed the urge to smile and went to Dean’s bedside. He had a thick cast from his thigh to his shin and was wearing a hospital gown. When he saw Castiel he grinned toothily. Castiel couldn’t help but smile. He had never seen anyone look so carefree in a patient grown and cast.
As Dean’s groans subsided, neither of them spoke. The silence rang louder than the lockdown alarm, the memory of which felt like it came from another lifetime. Slowly, Dean’s head drooped onto his chest and Castiel dropped the syringe. He knelt down and grasped Dean’s face, supporting him. The effort was astounding, but Castiel fought through it. He wanted nothing more than to pass out himself, but tending to Dean gave him strength. At last, Dean looked at him, his green eyes glistening.
“And no more fights,” he said, trying to maintain the authority in his voice. “You go to a teacher next time. Or talk to me.”
Castiel nodded solemnly, “It’s about Dean.”
Castiel looked up at him, feeling unusually ruffled. Without explanation, Dean sat on his lap. Castiel's arms came up automatically, holding onto Dean as Dean leaned down and kissed him.
“Did you see where the sledgehammer went?”A mover was asking.
And yet, Sam was keeping secrets. So Dean waited until Sam woke up that morning and made himself breakfast -- whiskey with a splash of demon blood -- and made his move.
The kids look alarmed. Castiel glared at Spruce.
“I have a gun.” Dean stated.
“Stay.” Crowley threatened.
Dean watched the embers slowly eat the newspapers, reflecting gold in his eyes. It was cold in the cabin. Dean could feel it on his arms and face, on his frostbitten nose and ears, but it felt like someone else’s body, and the warmth growing in front of him provided no relief.
Megan Shurley had been a registered nurse before she died. The Shurley’s relationship, while a healthy one, was the subject of much gossip among the staff. There was no doubt in anyone’s minds that Castiel and Meg were deeply in love, but Meg was much more troublesome than Castiel. She was a skilled nurse, but she had little patience for rules and regulations and she often butted heads with other staff, including the Head Nurse and many physicians. The Chief of Medicine wasn’t nearly as fond of her as she was of Castiel. Still, her death was tragic. It marked the loss of not only a talented nurse but of an equally talented physician, Castiel.
“I’m not asking you to,” Dean grumbled. “Just get some sleep.”
all the sex. They’d been not so subtly hooking up for a while, so much so that Sam had become very good at going temporarily blind and deaf. He was so good, in fact, that it took him a few minutes to realize Castiel was still standing there, watching Sam work.
Castiel’s efforts the previous night ensured that his family had their smoothest morning yet. The only caveat was that Castiel was exhausted. He made breakfast in a daze and let the rush of morning activity consume him.
“And you will take it.” Crowley went on, twisting his fist over the head of his cock, “Because when I’m done here, I’m going to force that last piece of defiance out of you. I’m going to fuck it out of you, and make you wholly and truly mine. I’m going to make you want it more than you’ve ever wanted anything. I’m going to make you beg for it, Samantha.”
A crashing sound suddenly echoed throughout the neighborhood, and they realized the roof had collapsed. A huge plume of smoke rose into the air, blocking out the moon. It sent a chill through the murmuring crowd and everyone went silent. Officer Mills turned the kids away from the scene. Garth was barely holding onto Jack. Charley had joined him, holding onto Jack’s wrist. Gabe and Claire were both looking stunned and teary-eyed at Officer Mills, but Meg had peered back at the house.
“Sorry to hear that,” Dean said. He had that conflicted look again, but when he spoke his tone was light. “Well, I know who I’ll be going to for rehab next time I break something. Kansas’s most overqualified physical therapist,” he grinned.
“Daddy!” Meg cried.
"Alright! Let's kill some werewolves!" Dean slapped Sam jovially on the back.
“What, I thought we were just saying names...”
“Alright, alright,” Sam said, taking a controlled breath.
“Some son he is! You’d think the King o’ Hell would have enough on his plate to spend a whole day at work! For once!”
“I’m not… I’m not lying,” he mumbled.
“That sounds great, Sammy,” he smiled.
The rest of the day pushed Dean from Castiel’s mind. It wasn’t until the kids were in bed that Castil was able to fully recount everything that had happened. He cleaned up the kitchen in a daze, remembering what Dean told him about the Bishop family. It left him feeling tainted—Cursed. But then he remembered what happened after Dean had told him the legend.
Dean leaned over him and kissed him, pressing him back down on the table. Sam didn’t object. Dean’s kisses were like Hell fire. He was all tongue and teeth, and he could suck the breath right out of Sam. Sam kissed Dean back just as hard, until he felt him slide something down his shaft. Sam nearly sputtered out of the kiss.
The young men jumped and turned around in surprise. They had clearly thought they were alone.
"Hear that?” The man said to her. “Claire says you snore."
Sam was bringing some dishes back to the kitchen and found Dean standing in front of the refrigerator drinking orange juice from the carton, butt naked. Sam shouted in surprise.
“Small town,” Garth said. “Dean here’s the best mechanic in the area. Fixed my ride about a hundred times,” he said fondly. “Well, don't let me interrupt you. I’ll see you guys later. Don’t forget to floss!”
This started as a Foot Fetish kink, but as I was discussing it with a friend, Breath Play got involved. Both are pretty mild.
This one was recommended by thor94. I just so happened to have 'breeding kink' as one of my bingo squares XD so enjoy some Sabriel smut!
Dean smirked. "Are you going to keep secrets from me again?"
"Oh, Sammy," Dean bent down to kiss his neck. "You're really in it deep, aren't you? Big brother's cock isn't enough anymore. You need his blood now, too." Dean dropped his pants and slid his boxers off one handed. His other hand has returned to Sam's neck, fondling it obscenely. Sam tilted his head back eagerly. Once Sam was this horny, he was putty in Dean's hands, and Dean loved it.
“Sam?” Castiel appeared around the corner.
"That's it. Come on, Sammy. You're my Alpha, aren’t you? My bitch." Dean groaned. "Say it."
Once Meg was asleep, Castiel went around and said goodnight to everyone. Claire ignored him, but Castiel was used to that. Gabe said a garbled ‘goodnight’ and got toothpaste all over his nightshirt. Felix similarly had his mouth full of mice when Castiel said goodnight to him and Charley.
Charley came running up to Castiel at once. “Dad, look! Mortimer gave me these. They’re seeds. He said they’ll grow moon-lilies, and once we get a new house he’ll come and help us make a whole garden.”
“What’s going on out here?” Castiel asked, stopping just short of the driveway.
Castiel used a little grace to be able to tell when Sam really needed to come up for air, and he set his pace that way. He found that Sam looked absolutely breathtaking coming up for air over and over again, plunging back on Castiel’s cock with renewed vigor. Soon Castiel had to stop him because it felt too good. A new urge was taking over and he didn’t want to come yet.
Dean began counting his breaths again. It had helped him endure the caning to his back, but he had no idea if it would help now. He could only try.
Never in his wildest dreams did he think he’d be cuddling Castiel in his bed, but it felt too good to question. He felt Castiel relax in relief, and Dean couldn’t help but indulge that voice of his. He fell asleep in Castiel’s arms, dreaming for the first time in a long while.
"We hunted a Wendigo, Cas. Fifteen years ago. It got away. So we came back here to finish the job," Dean said. His voice was gruff and worn. He could feel Castiel squinting at him.
"Can you… see them?"
Castiel looked surprised. For a moment his wings shrunk a little, like they were hiding, but then he relaxed again. “Oh really? Well...” He nuzzled Sam’s lips with his own. “Sam Winchester is welcome to see them anytime he wants.”
Castiel stared at her in shock, unable to look away. She grinned at him, then gave Dean a bold look. Dean understood. While Meg circled her family, protecting them from Mrs’s fury, Dean got the kids to their feet.
Sam blinked. “What?”
One was still in her bed. One was against the wall in the hallway. One was on the middle of the stairs, and the last one, the youngest, had made it all the way to the kitchen, her hand reached out for the front door. Their bodies were all unrecognizable by anyone but their own mother.
“What?” Claire glanced around. “But you were all home.” Claire saw Castiel and Jack exchange looks.
lots of smells and tastes, Top/Dom Castiel, Angel Grace, Cum Eating, Dirty Talk
Despite her tough demeanour, Sheriff Mills had a warm, motherly air about her. Castiel appreciated the effort, but his family had seen too much to believe her. Before any of them could respond, the police radio went off.
‘How about next Friday at 7?’
"No,” Sam helped Dean over, "he means... what was that." He pointed his gun at the bloody pile in the middle of the warehouse.
“Thank you, Dean” Castiel sighed.
like to put playdough up your nose.”
“You need a break,” Castiel said. “You’ve been at this for hours. I can take over for a while.”
“Okay…” Castiel said slowly, “So you don’t need salt or iron or anything?”
Castiel laughed. Dean winked at him. Castiel knew it was a stage wink, but he still felt himself flush a little. He took another sip of coffee.
“Only on Sundays,” Dean grinned at him. “Are you hurt?”
The bubbly water seeped over the edge of the tub as Sam got in. Sam didn’t care; he already had a whole mess to clean up. Castiel made room for him, but they fit together perfectly. Sam slid his legs under Castiel’s and put his arms on Castiel’s bare shins. It was nice and hot, and Castiel’s skin felt soft and slick with all the soap.
Dean frowned. Something roared to life inside of him. He felt hot and angry. “You know Meg,” he said, “I have a grenade launcher in my car.”
Dean paused. “W...what?”
Dean smirked internally. Sam wasn't like other Alphas—it was exceptionally hard to rile him up unless he was in heat—so anytime Dean got the upper hand, he ran with it.
“Dean...” Sam started.
“I can see that.” Sam skirted around Dean like he was contagious and dropped his dishes in the sink.
“So what happened?” Sam asked, bewildered.
"Fergus!"
Castiel pictured Mr. Mashal taking a sledgehammer to the wall behind the sink, perhaps even a sledgehammer he’d found in the basement, and then he saw that eye again, staring blindly at him from the darkness. “Do you, um,” Castiel tried to collect himself. “Do you know where the other one was found?”
Dain (Dean x Cain)
Meg gasped softly as Castiel ate her out. “That’s it, Cas. Mmm… you’re a natural. Use that tongue, baby,” she rasped.
“He left for college right after high school. Ran away more like,” Dean said. “My dad was furious. Hell, I was too. After everything we…
Dean didn’t look nearly as angry anymore, but he didn’t say anything. His expression was inscrutable. When he finally spoke he didn’t look Castiel directly in the eye.
“Yeah, good idea,” Ed said, quickly counting Castiel’s kids.
Gabriel purred in pleasure. This was it. This was Sam’s weakness.
“He just… showed up. So I figured we should get out of there.”
“Black’s fine.”
Charley nodded, but Gabe looked conflicted. Meg was watching her father curiously.
But by the time Sam returned, Dean was passed out and snoring softly with his arm over his face. Sam scoffed in disbelief. He had half a mind to take care of business right next to him, but he decided he didn't have the heart. So instead he grabbed his book and laid down beside Dean.
Castiel laid back down, grinning.
Sam wanted Gabriel to breed him.
Castiel leaned forward, toppling Dean onto his back. Dean saw Castiel eyes—shockingly blue and electrified—and he felt a second jolt of arousal that sparked into flames as Castiel yanked Dean's pants and boxers off in a single motion. Dean swallowed a moan. He always enjoyed when Castiel used his inhuman strength in bed, and this time was no different.
When Dr Hannah came in to check on Dean, she spotted Castiel there and smiled, but then her eyes fell on the empty burger wrappings and napkins in the trash. She eyed Castiel flatly. Both he and Dean feigned innocence.
The elevator doors dinged open and it took Sam several long seconds to come back to Earth and realize what he was seeing.
When the last box was securely in place, Castiel slid the door shut and thanked Sheriff Mills.
“Very generous of you,” the man said, holding up his glass to toast. “To the health and happiness of you and your family.”
“It wasn’t me!” Gabe said angrily.” I didn’t do anything!”
Castiel chuckled. “Good, you can fix my van this weekend.”
Castiel didn't help at all, even though Dean was sure he looked like an idiot trying to wiggle out of his jacket with only one functioning arm. It was cold in the cabin, but it felt good on his burned arm. Finally he was free and returned his arm to Castiel.
“That’s a relief,” Castiel said. At least he didn’t need to spend any more money.
Everyone smiled.
Despite all of the hardships that had come with the house, Castiel couldn’t help but feel proud of his home. The only thing it had been missing was Jack.
Castiel nodded numbly.
“That’s probably why they left so soon,” the officer said gently. “They must’ve kicked the door down, realized there were people home, then ran.”
“We have a lot to be grateful for,” Castiel pressed on, “Charley’s going into honors English…”
Special thanks to Captain Shade (Tumblr: felix-the-white-wolf) for beta-ing!
Castiel said Dean’s name again, like he was making sure it was still him beneath him. Dean didn’t get a chance to think about it, because in the next second Castiel’s thick cock was parting his ass without warning.
Dean chuckled. He leaned in and kissed Castiel. Castiel savored the warmth of Dean’s lips and the pressure of his body beneath the covers. A happiness filled Castiel that was so powerful it almost made him sad.
Small sounds disrupted his counting, and he concentrated instead on the sharp footsteps circling him predatorily. He could only listen to them because, on top of everything else, he was blindfolded.
Dean looked away. He was about to leave when he saw a whole series of framed pictures arranged throughout a bookshelf. They were mostly pictures of Castiel’s kids, a few of the same woman again but with long, blonde hair, and a picture of an older boy in high school graduation robes. The picture beside the boy was of two people Dean didn’t recognize. They were both young adults, maybe even younger than Dean. He realized with a start that one of them was Castiel. He couldn’t have been older than twenty-one. He had lighter hair and a young, almost babyish face. He was beaming. The girl beside him was laughing. She was petite and kind-looking, with a warm, gentle smile. She didn’t look anything like Meg, but was just as pretty. She looked a lot like the boy in the graduation robes, actually. Dean suddenly checked his watch. Twenty-one minutes had passed. He swore silently and hurried out of the room, shutting the door carefully behind him.
As he passionately, carelessly hard his way with Dean, Dean finally began to submit. It was almost out of necessity. The sensations were beginning to feel way more good than painful, and Dean couldn’t handle it. Every thrust made his skin light up, and the way Castiel was dragging his cock up and down his walls made Dean want to die from pleasure. He slammed his fist on the floor, looking in completely agony, but he’d never felt anything so good in his life. He cursed himself for it, but at the same time he needed more.
"You haven't even been inside yet, Claire," the man said patiently.
Non-con
Dean dropped the flask and dove into his trunk. There was a hidden, second layer beneath all of his tools from which he pulled out a shotgun. Then he slammed the hood, and raced up the driveway.
Sam nodded, “Yeah. Go ahead, Cas.”
They all broke into giggles.
Castiel beamed at Mortimer. “That sounds great, Charley.”
“I do,” Mortimer said. “Just up the stairs. In the wall of the landing.” He gestured vaguely upwards.
“I’ll bet,” Dean chuckled.
Castiel fucked Dean into the concrete floor like an animal, making him shout and moan into his fist. He could barely breathe. No matter how he writhed or twisted, he couldn’t do anything about the cock fucking him raw and hard. He couldn’t even reach down to touch himself, and he could tell Castiel wasn’t thinking about that. He was groaning in satisfaction. The sound was incredible. Castiel may not have been in his right mind, that groan… that groan was all Cas.
This wasn’t supposed to happen.
Under the table, Dean could tell that Sam had just narrowly avoided Castiel grace-touching him because, far from 'curing' Sam of his nonexistent illness, Dean was sure Castiel would have sensed exactly what was going on if he had entered Sam's mind.
"It's not a line," Dean protested. "It's amazing just laying here and watching it. I won't try anything. I'm the one who said the sex stuff had to stop remember?"
There were hugs, and suspiciously dewy eyes from Donna, and when Dean got up to get some champagne to toast them with, Claire came back over to Cas and leaned on his shoulder.
"It took us twenty minutes to escape," Kate explained. "The guy at the front desk offered us another go in a different room, because we did it so quickly. We had lunch, went shopping and then came back again and you still weren't done."
“Yeah, join the club,” Dean muttered.Then louder- “Just don’t try the beer.”
His inner critic informed him that he'd been horribly sulky and petulant before, storming home because he didn't have Dean's attention for once—but really, who could happily sit through an evening of watching the love of their life deep in conversation with a beautiful woman who would in theory be perfect for them? He was never going to be that selfless a person, however much he tried.
and that had never been more evident than it was today.
Luckily the restaurant was inexpensive and as his taste buds slowly adjusted, he discovered the food was borderline edible as long as he chose the most simple items on the menu. He wasn't winning at life by any stretch of the imagination, but he was surviving. Life wasn’t perfect, of course it wasn’t. Cas was used to feeling like a piece of him was missing whenever he wasn’t with Dean, so he wasn’t expecting to feel magically fulfilled, but he did hope that it would gradually start to hurt less.
"You like it," Cas stated, and Dean couldn't have disagreed if he'd wanted to—the proof was pretty evident if Cas just looked down, though the inadvertent lapdance had been a definite factor too.
Achingly hard now, Cas bucked his hips against Dean's, moving to where his neck and shoulder met to suck another dark red mark.
"I don't know, some people get off on that," Dean quipped, not expecting to be taken seriously or to get any kind of followup question.
By the time he had made up his mind to stop feeling sorry for himself and face the day, he could hear the subtle noises that indicated Sam and Eileen were getting up for the day too - the murmur of voices, water running, a feminine giggle that could have come from either of them.
"Either. Both?"
Satisfied that he wasn’t doing something Dean didn't want, Cas pressed another kiss to his wrist, but this one was open mouthed. His tongue snuck out and the tip of it slowly traced a hot, wet line over Dean’s skin. With a groan, Dean’s head fell forwards, his eyes closing. Cas watched him, his eyes dark as he got Dean’s senses used to this new level of pleasure, before letting the tip of his tongue dance over new skin, tracing patterns and shapes. He watched Dean as his entire body reacted and he squirmed in his seat, his breath coming in quiet gasps and pants. Dean's other hand clenched and unclenched on the table and Cas reached for it with his bandaged hand, letting Dean grip his unhurt fingers almost painfully hard. Dean clung to him, using Cas like a rock in a storm of pleasure that assaulted his senses.
The sky flashed above them with another fork of lightning, then another. The rain was so heavy that it was bouncing back up off the road they were driving down, so dense it was like a sheet in front of them. Dean could only see a couple of meters in front of him and was now crawling along the road, back in the direction of the bar and Bobby, who could hopefully throw some (literal) light on the situation.
Was this allowed to turn him on?
"You're close enough to feel the heat from my body, close enough to smell my cologne, the cherry shampoo I've used."
"Yeah, of course. They're so soft and real clingy."
“I know what it’s like to miss someone at Christmas,” Dean offered with a shrug. “Mom, Jack, Bobby—Christmas wasn’t a big deal for any of them, but with all of our family here it feels like there’s a gap where they should be.”
Dean rubbed his stubbled jaw with the palm of his hand, the tiny hairs scratching and rasping against his skin, making Cas' fingers twitch with the urge to replace that hand with his own.
"And I know money isn't an issue for us these days," Dean was saying, like he was continuing a conversation that Cas hadn't been present for, "But we don't really need two lots of bills going out each month, when we could be pooling our resources."
“Fuck this,” he growled, reaching up to hook Cas around the waist and tackling him down onto the bed next to him. Cas let out an undignified squeak and a snort of laughter that had Dean grinning down in wry amusement.
Amara wrapped her arms tightly around him and soothed him while he sobbed. And unable to do anything else anymore, Dean let himself collapse against her. He had no idea how long he lay there for, half sprawled on the ground, trying to remember how to breathe, but when he eventually sat up it felt like hours had passed. His eyes were raw and aching, and somehow while he'd been sitting there Amara had dressed him, probably in the first clean clothes he'd had on since he'd come out to this hell-hole to find Cas.
"I'm not expecting anything," Cas muttered. "I can't control this. I'm not doing it on purpose so that you'll feel obligated to do something about it. It's just… there. It's there and it is what it is. I'm sorry."
“What the fuck?” Sam let go of Dean, horrified. "No. No. We
Face filled with concern, Cas spun to face him.
“I was going to say 'flirt'.”
"Fuck, yes," Dean groaned, fingers tightening in Cas' hair. "Want you so fucking much."
John and Mary Winchester. A mother who both loved and disregarded him, who fought for and abandoned him. A father who he had once looked up to with an almost slavish devotion, but whose views and actions were questionable at best, sick, twisted and irredeemable at worst. How was he supposed to process any of this? How was this even possible?
“Did you get it? Tell me you got it.”
“Not yet, but she lives nearby. They all do - all our people together in little houses dotted about everywhere. I’m honestly not sure how much of an improvement it is. The beer tastes like piss and Dad lives around the corner. I’m not really looking forward to having the conversation with him about how disappointed he is in me for letting vampire mimes end me.”
and I don’t want to be with anyone else.”
"That night my dad sent me on my first solo hunt. I truly thought he was sending me away to die, that I'd let him down so much that he didn't want me to even exist anymore."
Then I drank myself into a stupor so I didn't have to keep remembering you were gone!"
"Fucking?" Dean finished for him. Then, channelling his inner Jody, he smirked back at Cas. "Hey, if we can't talk about it, we shouldn't be doing it."
"Yeah, that too," Dean agreed. "Don't call, don't write. Send takeout and beer."
Leaning over to top up Cas' cup as well, she said, "
"It's either clever and knows we're screwing with it, or this is all alcohol and sleep deprivation and we're just going insane and imagining all of it. I'm not sure it
Playing dumb wasn't something he enjoyed doing, but Cas did consider it for a long moment. Dean didn't want people to know, but there was very little chance Eileen and Sam didn't already know everything. Dean, for all his worry about being found out, was neither subtle nor quiet.
It was so tempting to ask for what he wanted. The desperation, the open sincerity in Dean's gaze—Cas knew that if he asked for Dean's heart that Dean would truly try to give it to him. He would try to love him, try to give him what he needed, try to fake it just like he'd done with Lisa for all those months. But what Cas wanted was something real, not given out of loyalty, guilt and pain. He didn't want Dean's sacrifice, he wanted his love and it was the one thing he could never ask for.
Sam's hand on his shoulder made him jump and reflexes honed by a lifetime as a warrior, Sam's wrist was in his grip and twisted behind his back before Cas had realised what he was doing.
bad. He'd shave it if Cas asked him to. Maybe Cas would like it?
"Don't you
"The only way for you to have people around you is for you to take people and force or trick them into it!" he snarled at her. "Cas, Jack, me! That's not what love is! You can't force people to love you!"
"And until then?"
He came home and found Miracle brutally murdered, blood staining his beautiful sand-coloured fur. Eileen was there sobbing, blaming him because his selfishness caused this and the dog had no chance with him around.
Laying in his bed, staring up at the cracked ceiling, Dean wondered if Cas had been attracted to him in the same way when he'd had all his Grace. He wanted to call and ask, but knew he wouldn't. Was love as an angel different to love as a human being? Sure, they'd exchanged some pretty heated looks, but Dean had never been sure if Cas felt it too. But then:
"Uh-oh. Something's not right. You need to talk? Drink? Fuck?"
them kill me, instead of ending them."
Kate was walking towards them, worry and determination written all over her face.
"Is this before or after you beat some poor guy bloody?"
. Dean chuckled against Cas' lips and earned himself a low growl of frustration.
Cas pulled Dean to him, the sudden tightening of his arms around his back made Dean gasp out a puff of air, and Sam watched in horror as both his brother and the angel who loved him glowed brighter and brighter, seeming to absorb all the light around them, burning so brightly that it felt to Sam like trying to look at the sun. When he looked back, they seemed to have burned away.
"Then there were these chickens, and I don't know if you've seen possessed chickens, but they were fucking hilarious!"
Cas' smile was dark, almost feral, dominant, and made Dean want to drop to his knees and beg for more. Then as if it had never been there at all, the look broke into one of gentle humour and compassion. Dean blinked and wondered if he’d imagined it entirely, through pure wishful thinking.
If Cas added raspberries into the mix, Dean was going to have to wipe away literal drool from his chin. Was it normal to be horny
not like opening the same old gift twice. "Only I don't think it really works like that with naked bodies. The thrill you get when opening a gift? That isn't a one time thing when you undress someone. You sorta get to relive that exciting, uncovering feeling every damn time."
. Who set them?"
by having her body taken over and being forced to slice into me with a scalpel over and over again, or had that little fact slipped your mind?"
"Watching you, I came so close to experiencing it that I feel like I really don't need to try it myself," Cas grinned. He took a small, almost demure sip of the champagne, loving the feeling of the bubbles bursting all over his tongue. "This actually isn't bad, even if only for the sensory experience of it. It's so bubbly."
The sound of Dean's throat clearing from the doorway startled Cas and made him blush. How much had he heard?
For once, hope was rising in his chest—soaring, lifting him up and making him feel invincible. How could he just sit there, when these feelings were pounding through his body with every beat of his heart?
Dean's eyebrows shot up and he spread his hands on a gesture of helplessness. He had to say, he wasn’t really expecting a guilt-trip as their first interaction, but he could roll with that. Anger he knew, understood. Cas needed to get that anger out and Dean more than owed him that.
. None of that is on you.”
"Wasn't it? I'm sorry - I didn't get the memo," Dean said sarcastically, dragging his fingers through his hair. His knee was jiggling under the table, bouncing like Dean had a load of pent up nervous energy that was just desperate to escape.
"Thank you," he whispered. "Dean—" he said his name more urgently, causing Dean to open his eyes again and look at him. "I mean it.
what I'm saying. I haven't been to visit her, so I really can't say what memory she is likely living in."
“You free yourself, Cas,” Kate said with a shit-eating grin, ignoring Dean lifting his head to throw her a
"So… how did it go?" Eileen asked pleasantly.
"It's nothing serious. I'd have bandaged it better, but it's very difficult to dress a wound with only one hand."
"You think I've got a thing about Cas? Really? Are you absolutely fucking blind?"
"I think this is the least subtle we've ever fuckin' been," Dean laughed, ruffling Cas' hair to try to make it look less 'recently fucked', but only succeeding in making it somehow worse.
"Dean-"
“No one else?” Kate asked. “No one at all, ever? How do you even know?”
“I'm staying here,” Claire argued. “If you’re trying to shield me from a fight, I’ve seen worse and I’ve done worse. We both have.”
“Sorry Sam, you’re going back!” Jack said, and then with a click of his fingers, everything faded to black.
“Thanks.”
"Just how much have you had to drink?"
"What do you want from me, man?" Dean asked tiredly.
"Cas?" He asked, needing to hear his voice, to know he was still there.
any way to show you that I'm telling the truth. I have some Grace left, but I can't waste it on a display for you."
It was like a gunshot straight to the heart. Cas almost gave in, and he felt his body swaying towards Dean, betraying him silently. But he couldn't do this. He knew he couldn't do this.
“Cas?”
"Well, it's about time for my set, and I promised Sam I wouldn't take all night about it."
“Okay, Dean. I’m just saying that he doesn’t seem to be suffering. He had fun, and now he's tired. You can stop doing your mother hen thing now—Cas is fine.”
Amara looked at him in consternation, and Dean knew what her answer was before she opened her mouth.
Despite his words, Dean's hand closed tightly around Cas' fingers, holding on as if Cas was his only anchor to the world. He closed his eyes.
Before she'd arrived, they'd all gathered to discuss how they would keep the monster talk to a minimum. They'd agreed that they would just talk about other things. That wouldn't be too hard, would it? Cas was sure it would be easy—he’d been explaining the unexplainable to Kate since he'd first met her and she seemed to be inclined towards not believing in anything that couldn’t be explained by science. A fallen Angel of the Lord? Not easily explained by science. A woman brought back from the dead in a bath of tepid water? Definitely not easily explained by science.
was going on, but Dean didn't need to confirm it for them.
I'd like to say a massive thank you to Mason and ValandraEvans for all their help, advice and for saving my readers from all the Britishisms I keep inadvertently trying to throw at them 😁
He hadn't considered it, not once. And now Dean was talking about giving Cas up two minutes after he'd vowed not to, and it filled Cas with an aching sense of dread. The warm hands tangled in his hair grounded him, Dean's head pressed more firmly against his, making the conversation less terrifying. He'd sacrifice anything to get Jack back, but not Dean, not again. He didn't deserve that sort of ending.
Dean's eyes met and held his for a beat, then he shrugged and sighed dramatically. He pushed his chair back and got up with far too much grace to truly be drunk.
Body wash covered hands were sliding over his back, down his sides, over his ass. Cas slid one hand around him and wrapped it tightly around Dean's cock.
Just friends. They were just friends. He couldn't do more. Cas deserved more.
Another ten minutes and it occurred to Dean that Cas could have gone for a 'before bed shower' himself. Dean had only known him to shower a handful of times before, but he was human now, right? With all the feelings, needs and sweatiness that came with that. So yeah, Cas was probably showering. It's not like he would have stayed in the library to hang out with Sam and Eileen, surely? He’d definitely noticed Dean’s none too subtle signals and he’d never ignored Dean before.
There was the sound of Cas swallowing and a cup being put down on a counter or table. Cas had evidently become on edge enough that he couldn't just lie in bed any longer and by the sound of it he was pacing around his flat.
By the time Dean threw open the door to his room, Cas was gone, his shoes and coat still sitting neatly by Dean's bedside table.
"Wasn’t needed?!" Dean banged his hands down onto the table so that the coffee cups jumped and spilled. “
"If he's so completely useless, you won't mind handing him over now, will you?" he asked, none of his inner excitement showing on his face, in his voice.
, and if Dean wanted to talk to him he would have by now. He was never shy at coming forward when he wanted to see Cas normally.
“I don’t understand how
"Chuck, if you don't get to the point, so help me…" Dean threatened.
a problem before trying to deal with it.
“Try feeling like this for years,” Cas said, his hands reaching for Dean’s belt, working quickly. His fingers were momentarily clumsy in their haste, but persistence won out and the belt was finally out of the way, allowing him to fumble with the button at the top of Dean’s jeans.
Cas didn't feel like him agreeing with Dean would help, and now he seemed to genuinely feel bad, all Cas wanted to do was comfort him. He was such a mess when it came to Dean.
Sam bit back a whimper. He’d never been so turned on his life.
“Well,” the bespectacled man cleared his throat impressively, “we’re the
Neither of them even tried explaining how Castiel had beaten the curse on his own. Sam eventually gave up and assumed it was because Castiel was an angel.
They sat in the car in silence, watching number 252 Elmwood. They didn’t leave until the black sky lightened to a deep, early morning blue, and even Mortimer Tod’s house went dark and silent.
“Now then,” he began, “You know about the family I assume? Four children went missing, their mother committed suicide in the attic, etcetera?”
I've officially started another Bingo on tumblr: SPN ABO Bingo! I'll still be doing non-ABO chapters for those of you who aren't into it. I'll always specify for which Bingo/s each chapter is in the Summary.
“I noticed,” Castiel smiled weakly. “But, I understand. A lot of people move in and out of this house. I’m sure it’s hard to keep track.” He found himself repeating Dean’s words and took another sip of tequila.
It was there in the kitchen that Mrs. Bishop went mad. She took a sledgehammer from the basement and began breaking open the walls. She spent all night making the holes, one for each of them… The kitchen, the livingroom, the upstairs hallway, the master bathroom… She had to hide them. She had to save them from him. The kitchen, the livingroom, the hallway, the bathroom… She would make sure he never got them. She would make sure they were safe. Forever…
“You can’t even tie your shoelaces,” Claire scoffed. “How are you going to fight a ghost?”
Sam did a double-take. Sure enough, a man with strikingly blue eyes had come in and stopped at the sight of him. Dean hadn’t told Sam how much older Castiel was, but Sam was the judgemental type. Sure enough, Sam smiled and shook his hand. “Hey, I’m Sam. Dean’s brother.”
As if reading his mind, Dean said, "Don't worry about it. I gotta shower anyway." He wiped a tear from the corner of his eye.
“Uh, right...” Sam fumbled, holding back a laugh. Okay, maybe the prankster was alright after all. He settled down to get to work, but as he neared the screen he realized something. “Wait a minute…” Sam squinted at the video, “Doesn’t that guy look like the new intern? Ha, it totally does. What’s his name? Cas...” Sam stopped immediately at the look on Dean’s face.
Castiel eyed him sadly. “I’m sorry, Dean.” Sensing Dean didn’t want to talk about it any more, he changed the subject to Ellen and Bobby.
The silence was cold and electrified.
Dean couldn’t move his head, so he gave him a silent thumbs up. Gabriel chuckled, rocking Dean’s body gently. Dean could vaguely feel himself back in the bunker with the real Gabriel. His body there was melting with pleasure, too. He could feel Gabriel’s fingers inside him, yet he was here with dream Gabriel’s cock inside him.
Therefore, when St. Francis received word that Castiel Shurley was coming in for immediate care on that cold, August night, the entire hospital went into a frenzy of speculation and surprise.
Dean swallowed. One look at Castiel confirmed his worst fears. Castiel was horny. He was fucking horny. Dean’s mind went blank. He looked away quickly, telling himself it was just a malicious side effect of the mind control spell, but he knew that wasn’t true. Castiel hadn’t been attacked by the mind control spell; Dean knew that the moment Castiel killed the witch. The spell she’d attached to the revenge spell was something much worse. Sam called it the attack dog spell, but Dean knew it wasn’t that, either.
into this. You and me, in his body.”
Castiel looked feral. His eyes were radiating blue energy and he was trembling with a ferocious need.
“Get down before you break your leg.”
Sam's submission had Dean reeling. He was normally so hard to break. Seeing him so far gone so quickly made Dean want to celebrate. He started thrusting off the chair, no longer rocking his foot to keep Sam on edge. One good thrust pushed his cock down Sam's throat again, past the collar, and Sam sputtered anew.
“Told you so, assbutts,” Meg said.
Wincest (Demon!Dean x BoyKing!Sam)
“You know,” Kaia said quietly, “my mom says this house is haunted. They said there are demons here.”
“Dean...”
Dean didn’t say a word.
“Don’t think I haven’t noticed, Samantha.”
Sam watched him, biting back a smirk. “Would you like me to… whip our Dr. Winchester?” He ask in a mock professional tone.
Charley’s expression was blank as he tugged on the cord in the hallway. The stairs fell neatly in front of him and a breeze descended from the attic, blowing the hair out of his face. It was as if something was whispering from the darkness above. Tears stained Charley’s cheeks as he dreamt on, blind to the night around him.
They bickered as Charley tried to calm him. Suddenly Gabe’s hands flew off the knob as if he’d been electrocuted. Gabe clapped his hands over Charley’s mouth. Charley glared at him, but then he heard it. Something was scratching at the door from the other side.
Tessa smiled slyly. “I’m sure."
Crowley voice seemed to have at last broken Sam. He hung there in complete submission, his cock throbbing while Crowley grunted and came into his own hand.
Finally, Sam released Dean’s arm. Dean felt light headed, but that was well worth the sight of Sam's lips coated in his blood. Sam didn’t even have to presence of mind to lick it off. His head was tipped back, eyes closed, feeling the rush of blood mingle powerfully with the stimulation to his cock.
Dean didn’t respond.
Dean chuckled. He eyed the pie fleetingly, then moved over to Cas. He no longer needed crutches or a knee brace, although his gait was still a little stiff. He was wearing a well fitted Batman costume that Castiel had greatly approved of. Castiel smiled as he felt Dean kiss the back of his neck. He smelled like whipped cream.
Sam grimaced, but did the same. He nearly gagged. True to Dean’s word, the taste was so terrible that he forgot all about haunted pornos.
Dean’s eyes flashed and he quickly stepped back to remove his own jeans and boxers. Castiel felt himself perform a similar, heated gaze as Dean stripped in front of him. Dean was freckled right down to his navel, disappearing into a well-trimmed patch of hair. He had prominent tan lines that stopped at the defined curve of his hips. Castiel had forgotten how gorgeous a man’s body could be.
“Yup,” Dean repeated. He knew what Garth was thinking—if the thing in that house really was demonic, then they had no idea how to stop it. Ghosts were one thing. They could salt and burn a body any day. But demons...
“Those exist?” Claire asked, a flicker of uncertainty betraying her skeptical expression.
“Where’s your cast?” She looked up at him.
It felt like a long day, although Castiel was grateful he didn’t get any more calls from the school. He just hoped Dean was still holding on to his sanity.
Dean slowly slipped off of Sam’s cock and looked up at him. Sam looked like an angel. Well, maybe not that. But he looked perfect to Dean. That’s what Dean wanted to see. Sam completely spent and dripping with satisfaction. Dean gently pulled the dildo out of him, earning a shiver from Sam. Sam’s eyes were closed and his head was drooping his chest. Dean smoothed his palms up Sam’s muscular body and stood up. He kissed him, rousing him ever so slightly. Sam kissed back weakly, and it spread warmth through Dean’s post orgasmic body. Dean loved all the moments prior to this, but this was his favorite, still. He loosened the restrains and eased Sam into a sitting position on the floor. He pulled Sam to him, back to front, and cuddled him through his orgasmic bliss. Dean kissed Sam’s ear, his temple, his hair. Sam was putty. He rolled his head back to bury his face in Dean’s neck and Dean smiled.
“Anytime,” Dean winked at him.
“Come on, Dean,” Cain goaded.
“He is?”
“You should go to
Dean continued to amaze Sam by making him a grilled cheese sandwich for breakfast. Then he spent the rest of the morning doing all the miscellaneous chores Sam normally did around the bunker. Laundry, dishes, fortifying the demon warding; normal household things. Sam stopped complaining. Although he couldn’t help but notice Dean forgetting little things. He’d put the dishes in the wrong place after he washed them, he’d misorganize the books Sam had left out, and when Sam asked if he did the bloodied clothes separately, Dean just made a noise in the back of his throat.
Castiel didn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon. Dean’s ecstasy soon inverted, and Castiel began overstimulating him to the point of tears. Dean couldn’t even move now with his arm trapped behind his back. He wanted to thrash and break free, and yet, he was grateful he couldn’t. He was grateful that he had no choice to lay belly down and endure. It was his deepest, darkest fantasy. He groaned Castiel’s name as his knees and chest repeatedly scuffed the floor.
“N...ninety-six.”
“Yeah!” Gabe and Charley both said.
Castiel pretended to think about it. “I think I know a patient of mine, a very recent patient, who could handle a few weeks off.”
“A hundred.”
Dean woke up slightly confused. Once he recalled why he was naked in Sam’s bed, he grinned to himself and got up. Sam wasn't there, nor was he in his bathroom, so Dean got dressed and padded into the hallway.
“Get out of my house!” Castiel repeated firmly.
Castiel frowned. "But you were just a child. Surely he didn't blame you."
Sam shut his eyes, getting a little rush of submissive arousal despite his efforts at self-control. He flexed his hands, “Are we gonna start or are you just gonna stare at me all night?” Sam teased.
Dean's body was equally powerful, and Lucifer had to admit that Michael looked good in it. He looked like a King, yet at the same time, like an animal -- Unclean and wild. Sweat dripped down Dean's neck and onto his bare chest. Michael tipped his head back and Lucifer knew he was close.
“Dean...”
Sam Winchester stood stationary in the bunker’s hallway. The dull, yellow glow of the light above him highlighted the unkempt state of his hair as she stood, his head bowed. His arm was in a sling, and his free hand was rubbing the bridge of his nose. He was exhausted, yet the dull ache in his arm and the pounding in his head was nothing compared to the burning in his chest. He inhaled deeply. It was only when the sound of footsteps echoed down the hall that he forced himself to look up.
The next day was spent cleaning the motel room. Sam couldn’t believe he’d had a rut like that, but Dean was grinning with pride. After a greasy meal and several coffees each, they hit the road. On the way to their next case, they found it surprisingly easy to talk to one another. They laughed about dad, about their worst hunts, they even talked a bit about mom. Every conversation seemed to come back to what would surely happen if anyone took a black light to that motel room. Very little seemed to change between them, except that once every couple of months they’d take a few days off to take care of each other. That - and Dean was now on birth-control.
Dean was the one who made Sam think it was all in his head. Dean always acted completely normal, until one night when Sam making tea.
an idiot.”
Sam stripped on the bed while Castiel stripped in front of him. Castiel was already fully erect. The sight gave Sam chills. He lived for these moments, when Castiel’s lust was so strong he reverted to some primordial angel claiming his mate.
Two men, much less stealthy and coordinated than Claire, were moving towards her yard from the walking path.
Castiel offered him some tea then led him to the office. Garth Fitzgerald IV was the local dentist in Derby. He was laid back and laughed easily, and he was able to tell Castiel all about the local medical community. Castiel could tell his bad back wasn’t quite as bad as Garth claimed, but Castiel didn’t mind. Garth was a great client. Castiel sent him home with some exercise instructions and was looking forward to seeing him again. He was just walking him out when he heard a familiar car door close nearby.
He stopped in front of Dean and touched the rod to his leaking tip of his cock.
"How rude...”
He zoomed in on Castiel’s face. Castiel squinted at him. He heard the Impala roar off, and Castiel’s heart seemed to fall through the earth.
They both jumped when Castiel’s phone rang.
Dean glowered at his flask. “Buncha idiots. I can’t believe they haven’t gotten themselves killed.”
“You’re clearly delirious from blood loss. I am driving ‘Baby’ and you are going to rest.”
A few hours of his little brother’s begging and pleading, and his failure to help him, finally broke Dean. He succumbed to his own instincts at last, and let Sam fuck him on the motel carpet.
Sam huffed breathlessly, “I am having fun.”
Dean smirked, popping his finger out with relish. “I’m going to give you one chance to tell me why you’ve been sneaking around lately. Tell me, and we’ll have a nice, normal breakfast.”
Crowley was immensely pleased by Sam’s reaction, “You were awfully eager to meet.” He eyed Sam indecently, “Shall we skip the small talk?” Crowley walked past him and began inspecting his tools.
Then he struck Dean’s chest, making Dean flinch and suck in a sharp breath. Cain proceeded to give Dean a series of lashes over his chest that were rhythmic and light, but were almost harder to endure than the hard, sharp smacks. Dean’s breathing was quickening, like the air in his lungs was being replaced by the rapid sensations. Just as he felt his lungs burn with the need to breathe, Cain stopped. Dean gasped for air. He could feel his skin throbbing in the absence of the cane.
Clothing Sharing
“He pushed him, dad!”
“What’s going on?” Castiel asked shrewdly.
“What?”
Downstairs, Kaia’s necklace was hovering in the air above Claire, gleaming silver in the moonlight. It became taut, like hands were pulling it by its string. She rolled over irritably and the clasp broke. The chain fell and the pendant was lost in the blankets.
“Amazing?” Gabriel supplied.
Charley didn’t know how many exorcisms he watched. It was like he was trapped in a loop. At last, he realized something had changed. Days had passed, and when Mrs. Bishop climbed the attic steps to perform yet another ritual, she found the chair was empty. Mrs. Bishop’s horror reflected on Charley’s face. He watched her frantically descend the ladder, but Charley didn’t follow. He knew what she was going to find and he dreaded it with every ounce of his being. Sure enough, a scream reached his ears—a scream so terrible it made Charley want to sink into nothingness. But he couldn’t. He was in tears. And then he was beside Mrs. Bishop, watching her discover her daughters’ bodies one by one.
The cane dropped and lifted Dean’s cock, like Cain was observing it.
“Well, let’s just say John’s generation wasn’t so keen on guys dating guys.”
Dean’s struggling confused Sam giving Dean the upper hand. He wrestled Sam to the floor, slapping his face just enough to ground him. Sam sputtered and gasped, staring at Dean incredulously.
Sam and Dean both stared at him. Seeing Castiel in those kind of clothes was just as jarring as walking in on someone naked.
Suddenly, a cracking sound wrent the fiery air. A burst of fresh, night air blew through the house and Castiel turned to see Dean Winchester stepping over the busted down door, rifle in hand and face set.
The morning passed in a blur. His clients all complimented him on his new home, and Castiel was happy to see them, but all he wanted to do was put his head down on his desk and take a nap. He was relieved when, several hours later, his final client of the day showed up right on time. Castiel had never met this man before. He was a local and had only made the appointment the other day. Castiel opened the door to greet him.
Castiel looked over at his youngest kids. Charley had fallen asleep in his glasses. Gabe was holding his water-gun full of holy water. Meg was snoring next to Claire, who had her arm over her. Castiel felt like a horrible father and, thinking of Dean, a horrible friend. He wasn’t sure what came over him in that moment, but as Jack dozed off beside him he quietly took out his phone.
saved us,” he said, still grinning slightly, and Garth stared at him in surprise.
“Are you going to use karate and grenade launchers?” Gabe asked excitedly.
“Dean!”
“Oh fuck, fuck’s sake… there, Cas. There…”
Dean closed his eyes, getting a feral pleasure out of those words. They spurred him on, and soon he was grunting with every thrust, “I want you lubed and ready at all times. When you’re sitting on your throne, or giving orders, or drinking demon blood…I want you to know you’re mine.”
As the week went on, Dean continued to receive visitors. He was grateful for this, but he wished Castiel came by more often. Dean was happier than he’d been in years to have his brother by his side again, but in Sam’s absence he found himself thinking of things he wanted to say to Castiel; things he hadn’t said to anyone before. Whenever Castiel did come by however, the moment didn’t seem right, and Castiel couldn’t stay long anyway. Dean didn’t want to be selfish—he knew Castiel’s entire family was going through a lot at the moment—but he couldn’t help but feel like there was something amiss between them. He seemed to be coming by less and less each day. Dean didn’t talk to anyone about it. Not yet.
“I’ll call my friend at school,” he said, “maybe she’ll know something.”
Cas shook his head.
"Are you Barbie or Ken in this scenario?" Cas asked suddenly, his face screwing up in contemplation.
"Hey," Cas murmured softly, catching his arm and halting his pacing. "We'll be out of here in no time, and you'll be drinking beer and looking at naked strangers with Sam before you know it."
"Thank you…?"
"I dunno, man. I asked him if he was on his period, does that count?"
"Being in your arms is what comes naturally," Cas choked out, before he'd realised his mouth had even formed the words. When he realised, his eyes flew open and his relaxed movements ceased entirely as all three of them came to an abrupt stop.
Because there was no natural light coming into Dean's bedroom, Cas had no idea what time it was. All he knew was that around fifteen minutes earlier, Dean had woken up, stretched and then slid a hand into Cas' hair. He'd been playing with it ever since.
When Sam wasn't hanging out in his apartment with him, Cas spent a lot of time in the restaurant below. The apartment was furnished with a small kitchenette, but Cas very quickly discovered that cooking was not one of the life skills that he would excel at. He'd managed to burn toast, turn porridge into one solid smoking lump in the microwave and somehow he'd set fire to a bowl of soup. Soup - a liquid - on fire.
"Mmm," Cas made a noncommittal noise, forgetting Eileen couldn't hear it. Suddenly remembering, he signed, "Thank you," and squeezed her arm back, before going back to pretending to be looking at anybody but Dean.
"Cas. Hey. That was… um…"
"You're making fun of me," Cas observed. "Do I look ridiculous in your clothes?"
So the new, non-Kate-approved plan was that he was going to stop pushing, and most importantly he was going to stop being a selfish asshole. He was going to forget about what he wanted and needed right now—he didn't have a fucking clue what he needed for himself anyway. Making life decisions had never been one of his most finely honed life skills—what happened in his life had always been either what his dad wanted, or what was best for Sammy. With Sam and Eileen about to move out, he had no idea what direction he was supposed to be moving in.
The sky, which moments ago had been clear and blue, had gathered thick, ominous black clouds at such a speed that it was like turning day to night, like flicking a light switch. Dean peered up into the semi-darkness, and decided that he really wasn’t sure about Heaven. It was unpredictable, the timeline was just fucked up, and the people who were meant to give a damn about him had turned into dicks who couldn’t care less. Fuck Heaven. This was shit.
Sam frowned like he disagreed, but he didn't argue and Cas appreciated it.
Dean screwed up his face, trying to remember the last time.
"I really appreciate that," Cas murmured between Dean's soft, barely there kisses that were driving him mad. Every time Cas was tempted into deepening the kiss, Dean pulled away and started kissing his neck, face or jaw instead.
Dean took the scolding and the corsage related violence in good humour, despite the rising levels of panic in his chest that were threatening to overwhelm him now he was this close to seeing his parents again. He clapped Sam on the back, catching his eye with a genuine look of pure brotherly affection.
"Alright."
As if sensing his thoughts, Cas glared, his glorious wings beating just once, sending a gust of air past Dean that was strong enough to ruffle his hair. Dean was momentarily torn between his hurt, and wanting to excitedly tell Cas how freaking awesome his wings were.
"Lie down on the bed," Cas instructed. "Now, Dean."
"My what now?"
Looking was fine, right? He could look.
"Alright, I get it. I really fucking get it, Cas. But he's my dad, and mom loves him. Just, don't go asking anyone for any Mafia-style favours, okay?"
Dean was so very close to suggesting that Cas come over and try him out to see how he compared. Instead, at the last second, he changed his mind.
"There were rockfalls, animals that shouldn't have been there that were not particularly happy to see me… things like that. Nothing I can't handle."
"Cas…" Dean choked out his name, and Cas loved how responsive he was to everything Cas did.
When they broke apart again Dean could feel wetness on his cheeks—his own tears, not Cas’. He didn’t know why being loved by Cas had ever scared him, ever confused him. It was
Cas chose a plain ring donut, loving the way it seemed to almost melt in his mouth. Kate held the box out to Dean and he shook his head, making Cas narrow his eyes in suspicion. Dean turning down food was always a warning sign.
"Better than the Cartwright Twins?"
"I like this," Cas admitted softly.
guy. You."
Dean looked at Kate sharply and she held up her hands in defence.
“Hey guys!" Chuck greeted them glibly. "Did you miss me?"
When Cas tore his eyes away from Dean as the band changed to a slower song that Cas vaguely recognised, Sam was nodding his head, not a hint of surprise on his face.
"I can't lose you again. Every time I think you've died I lose a piece of me, and I'm not sure I’ll ever get them back. There’s not much left of me, Cas."
Cas wasn't expecting the door to open. He was steeled for the passive rejection of being ignored entirely. He'd expected to have to turn back, to go back to forcing down his pancakes, left to try to pretend Dean’s aversion to his presence didn’t hurt.
“Do I have something on my face?” Cas asked, frowning.
He tried hard not to let his eyes find his parents to see if they had noticed his moment of weakness. He
Dean nodded, waiting.
was the disapproval.
"I'm fine," he declared stubbornly. "aren't you joining me?"
"Admittedly I'm a bit drunk, but you did say that. And ever since you said that, you've been flirting almost constantly. I swear that when you look at me sometimes, it's like you want to do it again."
"So are you going to give in gracefully, or am I going to have to go through with my plan to start casually enacting scenes from Tombstone?" Cas grinned at him in such an infectious way that he couldn't help but smile back, even as he was vividly picturing himself throwing Cas onto the bed and sinking into him. Maybe while Cas still wore the cowboy boots. The hat was optional.
"Alright," Dean murmured, pulling their joined hands up to his lips and brushing an apologetic kiss against Cas' knuckles before letting him go. "We can do that."
Their lips were less than half an inch apart and the intensity in Dean's eyes as he held Cas, his hands in his hair - it made Cas feel sure that he
survival." Dean swiped at his eyes angrily with his free hand, refusing to cry. "I could have found a place, or slept rough. But not Sam. He needed a roof over his head. He needed to be fed. He needed something stable in our fucked up, crappy lives."
Cas’ forehead touched his and Dean let himself lean in, increasing the pressure. It felt so good to be this close to Cas again that he could have cried from it. The fresh, familiar scent of him assaulted Dean’s nose, and he breathed deeply - Cas always smelled like the air did after a storm. He’d missed that smell so damn much. Tears pricked at the back of his eyes and he took a shaky breath.
They broke apart minutes later, both breathless, both clinging on to each other, anchoring themselves with handfuls of clothes, as if afraid that the other might slip away if they didn't. Dean revelled in the way Cas seemed to unconsciously drag his hips against him, so obviously hard from just their kiss. Cas leaned his forehead against Dean's and made him shiver as his fingers explored the sensitive skin of his lower back.
“I will
Cas still straddling him, Dean slid his hands through his hair, cupping the back of his head, meeting him in the middle for a long, slow kiss. It gradually built up until Dean was sure it could no-longer count as kissing - this was mouth fucking. It was heat and longing and as pornographic as anything Dean had ever known.
Dean ran his hand over the scratchy, rather unkempt hair on his chin that had crossed the line from stubble to beard around four weeks ago. This was so fucking hard. Hearing Cas's voice had made it almost bearable at first, but lately it had just been adding to the increasingly heavy ache of loneliness in the pit of his stomach.
sorry," Cas said to Claire, who responded with a growl as she attempted to shove past Dean to get to Cas. "I was in Heaven and I had orders not to interfere on Earth. I didn't realise my not coming back would have caused this much upset."
"I believe you," Cas reassured him. "What the hell did Kate say to you the other day?"
"I'm not sure that's very hygienic," Cas observed, dropping into the chair opposite him and pressing his hand firmly against his side to try to chase away the stitch under his ribs.
It was the first time that he'd ever truly come close to doing anything like this. Leaning closer, feeling Dean's breath warm on his face as he did, it made him feel like the world was tilting on its axis. Everything was being thrown off kilter, his head felt light, butterflies danced in his stomach.
Calmly and with a long suffering look on his face, Dean reached out an arm to thump Cas between the shoulder blades, shaking his head in something akin to despair.
"He's gone for a drive," Eileen explained, grabbing a fork and digging into a waffle. “He wouldn’t talk to me. I think he went looking for Cas.”
was that was between them.
As he walked back up the hallway, he paused outside the door. There were voices. Two, maybe three, all whispering frantically at the same time. Then, as if a switch had been flicked, there was nothing.
"You know what, Dean - I think you
“You know, I never understood the embarrassment human beings experience when it comes to talking about sex. It’s what you were created to do. Parts of your bodies are created precisely for this, yet you insist on blushing whenever the subject is brought up.”
"I've seen the future - well an alternate version of it, but it's more the changes in Sam that give you both away. He's preparing to be a father."
"Yeah. I hope it was alright to let her in. She came to check on you and brought this big bag of Chinese food. I felt a bit awkward asking her to leave after that.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas said, filling his own glass and downing the wine in one.
"I'm yours," Dean affirmed breathlessly, hands sliding over Cas' shoulders as he writhed against the onslaught against his skin. "Just like you're mine, Cas."
Their hug was brief but heartfelt, but his eyes never left Cas', drawn to him like he was under some sort of spell, as if his connection to Cas was more important to him than the air he was sucking into his lungs.
"Still feel like I'm a good guy?" he challenged furiously. He wanted to throw things, hit things, break things. He wanted to destroy everything around him, because he didn't deserve any of it. Not one fucking bit of it.
Cas nodded sleepily, ready to agree to anything Dean suggested. It was adorable and Dean felt his chest swell with a warm feeling of protectiveness. How
"Oh?" he eventually said. He took a long drink. "What did you tell her?"
Cas when he moved, when he sat down. It was all he could think about. Every time Cas came near him, Dean wanted to reach out and touch him. They'd yet to make it into the main area of the Bunker, but Dean wasn't sure he should be allowed to be in public around Cas anyway. He kept finding excuses to touch him, to lean into him.
A hand on his shoulder stopped him, and Dean gave him a small smile.
right? A glimmer of hope burned inside him.
“Well, they say the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem.”
"I am
Cas stared at the text. Replying would be incredibly stupid, would undo weeks of being strong, not giving in. But…
"You won't lose him at all this way!" Cas didn't have time to reassure Sam, to argue with Jack. The sky was full of flash after flash of lightning, thunder rolling and growling constantly like a warning from an angry dog. A fork of lightning hit a tree that was so close to them Dean could smell the ozone in the air, the acrid smoke as the branches were instantly scorched. Cas turned to Dean urgently.
Sam refused to look at it. Dean knew his blood lust fed into his sexual lust, and vice versa. Coming to that realization was still the best Friday night of Dean’s life.
It occurred to Castiel that most plumbers wouldn’t follow up on a simple blocked sink, but Castiel was finding that he didn’t really mind. Dean was a little strange, but Castiel had been called that himself quite a few times and, well, Dean really was cute. Especially as he smiled at Meg, who giggled over her toast.
Again, Castiel saw Dean looking at him and again Dean lowered his eyes.
Charley, Gabe, and Claire all shushed her.
Garth sighed. He couldn’t remember the last time Dean had been in his car and not scoffed at the ill-fitted cd player, messy floor, and leis (or flowery hippie shit, as Dean called it) hanging from the mirror, but tonight Dean barely noticed.
Castiel smiled to himself as Dean hovered over him. Castiel had been all but covered in the pink frosting which now adorned Meg’s cake. When Dean had finished, he looped his arms around Castiel’s waist and smiled in his ear.
Castiel used his fingers to hold her lips apart as he ravaged her with his tongue. He brushed his chin stubble along her weeping entrance, making Meg jump and giggle. Then he pressed his nose into her and sucked, using his teeth to gently coax her clit into his mouth.
Castiel was radiating angelic power from inside the trap. It should have been enough to keep Dean away, but like it or not, it only made enticed him more. Dean closed his eyes resolutely.
Overall, not much had changed, except now Sam and Dean weren’t ashamed of needing each other. Dean told Sam about the shirt he used to keep, and Sam replied with the story of Dean’s pants. Sam knew they’d be okay when, at last, Dean let it slip over the phone with their dad that his Omega cycle was starting soon and he couldn’t start another hunt right away. Sam heard the receiver go silent before a calm voice replied “Okay, son.”
Charley wiped his eyes. “Yeah. She saved us.”
A cop car was parked on the road, its lights flashing red.
Garth waited for him to continue.
Dean shot a smile at Jack. “...so you should be good, but if you feel it shake again then you’ll need new plugs. I know a guy who can get ‘em for you for cheap. Otherwise, I changed the oil and the wipers. Both were looking worn.”
“You...” Winston rose a shaking finger at her and approached, “...trollop! You whore! You…!”
Dean chuckled.
Ketch paused, a subtle smirk on his lips.
“Oh... naughty boy.” Gabriel’s eyes twinkled.
Wincest
Dean considered this. “Your kids are very lucky,” he said soberly. “I lost my mom when I was young, and my family fell apart. My dad started drinking. It was rough. I practically raised my younger brother.”
“Aw, c’mon, Dean-o.”
Dean spent the rest of the night domesticating Sam, giving him only commands like ‘sit’ and ‘stay’, and Sam obeyed every one. By the end of it, Sam was a mess, trembling with both exhaustion and ecstasy, an incoherent flurry of sounds coming from his lips. His hole was dripping with Dean's cum and his cock and balls were aching from so many orgasms.
“I thought you were…” Dean tried to justify it, but then gave up. “...forget it.”
“Good morning, Sam.” Castiel came in and looked around, “Where is Dean?”
Ketch’s hand tightened in Sam’s hair as he bobbed about him. He found a steady, comfortable pace, making Ketch melt against the table. Soon Ketch was pulling his hair in earnest, forcing his cock down his throat. Sam craned his neck and closed his eyes, but he wasn’t just letting Ketch face fuck him – he was fucking him back. While Ketch thrust his hips off the table, making Sam’s lips brush against his hot skin, Sam’s fingers were woven into the belt loops of his pants, pulling him back and forth.
“So much for friendship.” Ketch muttered smartly, directing Sam’s hips to rub against his erection as they made out against a table in an unused artifact room.
Sam lost himself in the kiss, but so did Crowley. It was a possessive, savoring kiss; like Crowley was trying to absorb him. Sam’s submission seemed to have awoken something needy in Crowley. Something human. And after Sam’s overwhelmingly vulnerable display, Crowley didn’t mind giving Sam some of his own vulnerability in return.
Castiel put the folder on the kitchen counter and took off his shoes. “Great. Her teacher seems really nice. So, what’s the diagnosis?”
“I might have…accidentally...”
Restraints
Dean winked at Castiel.
“You’re so fucking tight, Sam. Oh bloody… you feel incredible.”
“Mostly, yeah,” Sam chanced a glance at the CD tray despite himself. It was not full of peanut butter.
“Shut it, Mr. Spock,” Dean snapped.
In the morning, Sam was surprised to find Dean awake first. He was sipping coffee and sitting funny at the Men of Letters' table, looking oddly at peace with the world. Sam poured himself a cup and joined Dean in silence.
Sam stared at Castiel in surprise. “I can’t leave now.”
Then, when they got to the night of the fire, Castiel paused and looked to Charley. Castiel had only woken up because he heard Charley scream. Charley admitted he’d been sleepwalking, but Castiel could tell he didn’t want to say anymore about it so Castiel took over again. He told them about the fire starting from the attic lock, and about Mr. Bishop throwing him down the stairs. Jack told them how the fire had cut him and Claire off from the others, and how they only escaped because the kitchen window had flown open.
"There. Exorcism over." Dean threw the blade on the ground, "now, how many vampire-mobster-family hit lists are we on now?"
He let go of Dean’s cock and smoothed his hands up Dean’s body, nestling under his jaw and ears. Dean’s eyes fluttered closed in surprise. Castiel was amazed such a gentle touch could affect him so strongly.
Meg eyed the device skeptically, then gave Dean an oddly profound gaze. “You’re not a plum-ber.”
“Dean isn’t who he said he was,” Castiel explained gently. “He lied to us. I think he’s… remember the Ghostfacers? I think he’s one of them. I don’t want him in the house anymore. Not until we fix this.”
“It’s okay,” Castiel winced with pain. His whole body ached, but nothing felt broken. “Jack!” He hollered. “Go through the kitchen window! Now!”
Outside, Officer Gadreel was walking up to the porch. He raised his flashlight, but instead of illuminating the figure standing there, it vanished. He lowered his light, and it was there again. Gadreel didn’t understand.
Suddenly, Charley was back in that small room. Mrs. Bishop had trapped her husband in the attic while she figured out what to do. She told everyone he was away on a business trip. At last she found it—An old leather bound journal her mother had left her. It told her all she needed to know. It was a late summer night when Mrs. Bishop began to exorcise her husband.
“I’ll get some towels,” Dean offered.
By Thursday Dean’s cast was removed and he was given a hinged brace to wear. He was also advised to start physical therapy. Relieved he finally had a reason to get on Castiel’s case about something, he called him the moment Dr. Hannah left.
“I’ll do it!” Charley said.
“CS & KN.”
Sex while possessed, Grace sex, Possession bondage, Anal, Slight wing kink, Cuddling, Seductive Meg!Sam
Jack ended the call and looked at Castiel. They both looked deep in thought.
Mortimer looked at him curiously. “Oh I suspect it has much more to do with the ghosts.”
“What did I tell you about bothering him? And touching things that aren’t yours?”
Sam looked over his shoulder. "Good morning." He held back a smirk.
She gave him such a stern look that Castiel was forcibly reminded of her mother. His smile softened. He wished she could’ve seen the morning they had. Then again, perhaps it was best she didn’t.
Monday morning Dean finally conceded to go see another physical therapist, if only to placate Nurse Tessa who had been giving him dire warnings all weekend about atrophying muscle, needing a wheelchair for the rest of his life, and a million other things Dean didn’t care enough about to understand.
The backyard was large and grassy, with a firepit in the middle and the barn-like garage off to one side. It didn’t have a fence, but the surrounding foliage provided a lot of privacy. They could barely see the walking path behind their yard. Gabe was already climbing the biggest tree to get a better look at the neighbors’ yards, while Charley yelled at him below.
It had been years since Charley sleepwalked
“Don’t worry about it, Cas.” Sam said honestly, idly smoothing his hands over Castiel’s legs.
The Bishops weren’t a religious family, but Mrs. Bishop had no other explanation for it. Mr. Bishop would walk up and down the hallway for hours. He would stand in the kitchen all night long, unmoving. Mrs. Bishop didn’t know what else to do. Her mother used to tell her stories about monsters and ghosts, demons and possession. She’d never believed in those stories.
No one was there. The cool air hit his face, and he realized he was sweating. Anger was coursing through him, but in his moonlit solitude it faded, revealing bone-deep fear. He walked around the side of the house, dropped the hammer in the garbage bin, then went back inside. He slammed the door and leaned heavily against it, his whole body shaking.
Dean’s brow furrowed. “Cas, I’ve been calling you all morning. I thought...” but he didn’t finish.
you didn’t pray right.” Gabriel bit back a smile.
Castiel needed to send Sam a gift basket. Dean just so happened to be thinking the same thing.
Castiel beamed at him. Then he raised Dean’s hand to his lips and kissed it.
The shock of everything that had happened and the relief that they all got out of it one piece was gradually replaced by the overwhelming reality of what was to come. They had a lot of work ahead of them and it settled like a debilitating weight on Castiel’s chest.
“You think that one was a prank?”
Once Dean had stopped trembling and cursing from his orgasm, Sam helped pick him up by the shoulders. Dean let him change positions, so that Dean was on his knees with his chest and forehead on the couch seat. Dean gave a murmur of thanks. Sam was clearly still in fuck or fight mode, but Dean was impressed by just how much he was able to control it now. Still… Dean clenched around Sam’s knot and got a surprised moan out of him.
Dean gave him a sarcastic look.
Suddenly, something Jack’s friend Charlie said came back to them.
Beyond the shiny metal doors wasn’t a small, cramped space ready to take Sam back to the seventeenth floor, but what looked like an expansive, private office that stretched well beyond the confines of the elevator shaft. Sam’s mouth went dry. His eyes flew to the lights above the door, checking to see if he hadn’t accidentally walked into someone’s office, but the frame was all there, clearly showing that the elevator was stopped on his floor and waiting for him to board.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed in thought. He looked over his shoulder, trying to image the direction in which Mrs. Bishop would have been reaching. Almost at once he spotted the small carving he saw just after they moved in, directly across from the blackened stain on the floor. Castiel got up. The floor creaked beneath him. He lowered his head and wiped dust off of the carving. It was a small circle with a star in the middle. Except, he hadn’t noticed the first time, there were little symbols between each point of the star. It looked strangely familiar. Castiel took out his phone and took a picture of it before heading back to the stairs.
“Jack!” Claire felt small hands around her ankle and kicked out in fright. “Jack!”
Castiel and Dean both ignored him.
“You, too.”
Castiel nodded, his pupils blown and his lips parted. “It’s… ‘fucking hot’,” he rasped. He lowered his hips and angled a thrust into Dean’s prostate felt a rush of satisfaction as Dean’s witty retort fell apart on his lips.
Dean knew Castiel would have been happy to just stand close to Dean forever, but Dean suddenly found himself wanting more. He leaned in and, when Castiel didn’t back away, when they were so close they could taste each others’ breath, Dean kissed him.
Castiel lifted his hand to Sam’s forehead.
Castiel's hands were warm and surprisingly gentle as he rolled up Dean's sleeve. The burn was worse than Dean thought. He regretted pushing Sam away, and yet he knew he was doing it again to Cas by being so rude.
Sam considered this as he tossed Ketch his clothes. He had taken off the most, yet was still the more fully dressed. “We had olive oil? In the artifact room?” Sam asked, getting dressed.
“Shut it!”
Dean looked dazed and flushed, but he grinned at Castiel. Castiel grinned back. Dean pulled him into a kiss, savoring the taste of their post-orgasm bliss. Neither seemed to want to do anything else. They kissed for what felt like days. At last Castiel pulled out of Dean, kissed his forehead, then got up to get a washcloth for them.
"That's not what I said." Dean folded his arms defensively, his jaw clenching.
"Your assistance is very much appreciated, Dean," Cas grumbled sarcastically. He called him some choice Enochian insults in his head, but it didn’t make him feel any better.
, talking to him. Cas backed out of the room, not even noticing what he was doing until his back hit the wall. He looked at Dean, met his red-rimmed eyes and then he ran.
"Give her some space for now," Dean advised, reading him like a book. "And remember later? Later is what we hang on to today, okay? Whatever happens, we're gonna end today naked in bed together. The things I'm going to do to you later, Cas… you won't be able to form a single thought to worry about any of this."
Words flowed from Dean's mouth easier in this space without time—or, perhaps, it was his desperation that urged him on. "We've had time travel, cosmic kismet, and the powers that be plotting and putting things in place several millennia in advance. Something, somewhere designed us for each other. We met and it just felt right—for a reason. It just clicked into place, because we were always destined to find each other. We will always find each other, Cas."
" Dean admitted in a low tone. "I feel like I need to be touching you all the time. I don't know what's got into me today."
Eileen and Kate glanced at each other and simultaneously pulled several shopping bags out from under their seats.
"You know, it's always possible that I'm not sleeping because you're just not shutting up long enough for me to get a chance to." Dean could hear the scowl in his voice.
Cas' eyes widened in a panic that he couldn't suppress. Really? They were really going to do that here? With kids in the room, and their friends and…
echoing in his mind, because no, he didn’t trust her. And he wasn’t even sure
"They're combination locks, Dean," Cas pointed out. "On the
"Do you want to go first?" Cas asked, his stomach twisting with nerves. Was it better or worse to go first?
Dean swore, searching for Cas' mouth with his, jerking his now-pinned hips against Cas'.
"Yes?"
"So impatient. Are you completely sure you want this, Dean? I need to hear you say it."
"You can claim every other Castiel in every other world out there doesn't love his Dean, but I wouldn't believe you," Cas ground out. "He made me who I am, he taught me what it
“I got you a bee!” he announced before Cas could finish reading the words on the certificate. The delight was evident in Dean's voice as he bounced in place on the bed. “It’s got its name on there, and its job! It’s a honeybee!”
"Just like that?"
didn't sound like some cheesy tale of romance come true, did it? It was the first time in his life that Cas wished his life were a predictable, trashy romance novel—the kind you picked up for a dollar from the bargain bin, a woman on the front cover with a heaving bosom and a shirtless man with perfect abs wrapping her up in his steely embrace. Not that Cas would ever admit to anyone that he sometimes bought and read them.
"Because this isn't Jack," Cas said, his words harsh with anger and pain. "It hasn't been from the moment he absorbed Chuck's powers,
Cas nodded, then with two distinct spots of colour on his cheeks, he handed Dean the feather that was in his hand.
Dean's mouth brushed over Cas' lips again and again, each almost-kiss more firm than the last one, each one stealing Cas' breath away, making him light headed, making him forget everything except Dean's perfect mouth, the hand sliding up from his hip, under his t-shirt and sweater.
Dean thought for a moment. "It might still be potentially ass related, but I want to know more about Angel sex."
to, that if he didn’t he wouldn’t survive, like he would somehow starve without it. He took a steadying breath.
Dean shook his hands free, glaring at Cas accusingly.
that I'm the one who screwed up and pulled away, but what we had mattered. It mattered so fucking much. And I'm such a dick for getting upset about this, because I don't have the right to, but it really fucking hurts to have thought I wasn't entirely alone in this, then to find out that actually I am."
"Are you going?"
"Okay, so which cowboy movie do you think I should start with? Picking a favourite might take so long you'll be asleep before I start."
"Just for two minutes."
Cas’ vision swam as a wave of nausea hit him and he fought not to close his eyes - he couldn't let Dean see the tears spill over. Dean's fists were clenched at his sides, and at Cas' plea, he spun away from the door, going to sit on his bed with his head in his hands. Cas hovered in the doorway for a moment, not knowing what to do. He couldn’t stay here, couldn’t be near Dean. Every single cell in his body was telling him to run before he broke apart. He turned.
Her fingers massaged, but if her intent was to relax and soothe him, it was actually having the opposite effect
"We'll be living at the Lake House together before you know it," Cas reassured him, knowing instinctively that Dean needed it. "I was thinking that we could get chickens—Sam was telling me about a protection spell that would keep away predators, so we could section off half the garden and they'd have so much space to roam."
Cas pushed himself back from the wall so that he could look down at Dean, and his fingers wrapped around Dean's jaw, stroking his face with surprising gentleness, considering how close he was to losing himself. He traced Dean's mouth with his fingers, heavy lidded eyes unable to tear themselves away from the sight of Dean's lips wrapped around him.
"It's a score that needs to be settled," Cas said and Dean shot him a look. Sam looked even more worried.
"What are we, twelve?" Cas muttered, before putting a slightly strained welcoming smile on his face and unlocking the door. "Kate!"
“It’s just a hug,” Cas said thickly.
"It's not like you two have been here that much longer," he observed. "What, ten minutes at the most?"
were you?"
"If it helps," came the gruff voice from very close to Dean's left ear, "when he gets old he has hair like Doc Brown's from those Back to the Future films you made me watch with you."
“Why doesn't this happen when you heal me?”
Then there was Cas - Cas dead on a hunt, killed by vampires, by werewolves, by his own hand because the Mark never really faded and he was still a Demon. After one of those dreams, Dean finally broke down and cried, so exhausted that he just couldn't cope anymore.
With a horrified expression on her face, woman and dog disappeared inside, where their ears would be safe from Dean's casual depravity. Dean raised his eyes sheepishly to meet the narrowed ones belonging to the owner of the aforementioned ass.
“Dean...” Cas’ tone was pleading now. “Let me fix this? Please let me fix this?”
Eileen, who had followed him over to the group to stand back next to Sam, punched his arm. ‘He said nothing of the sort. And even if he did, he didn’t move fast enough. He’s mine now’. She squeezed Sam’s arm, and a sparkle suddenly appeared in her eyes. ‘Although that’s no thanks to…’
"Cas," Dean hissed his name, threading his fingers through his hair. "I need you. Show me I'm not… not
“Dean, stop,” he choked out.
"He's a nephilim, not a human child, and he's actually
"I want Jack back," Cas' voice broke as a sob threatened to escape. "I can't-"
"I don't think so. Not since the lakeside."
As Dean's body directed Cas, his feet started to follow without him even needing to think about it. It seemed that his problem really had been his inability to relax, rather than some innate lack of coordination. The more Dean soothed him, stroked his hands over his sides and hips and sang softly in his ear, the more his body warmed and his muscles loosened, until he managed to move to the beat of the music. He wasn't sure he'd win any competitions, but he wasn't stepping on any feet and he'd take that.
"No. He's not dead—I would know. Rowena would know… his soul would have moved on. He wouldn't… he's not…"
"Okay," he breathed. "Let's go."
Porn. That's what he needed. He pulled the laptop out from underneath his bed, popped it on his bedside and turned on his side. What should he search for? Girl on girl had started to bore him years ago. There was a threesome at the bottom and one of the guys did have a look of Cas. He had his body type, and making the video bigger, he could sort of imagine Cas' face if he squeezed his eyes half-shut.
Deep breathing exercises hadn’t helped. Running his fingers over the quartz stone in his pocket hadn’t helped. He’d even tried the trick of finding three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. All three things he could hear were Dean and Kate - their laughter, their whispering, their clinking their glasses together in a toast before they drank to, '
She squeezed his shoulder, her long nails digging into his skin through his thin t-shirt. Once upon a time, before he fell in love with Cas, he might have enjoyed the sensation—now it just irritated him.
"You smile and I want to kiss you. You stretch and I picture what you'd look like with your wrists secured to my headboard."
"Not a word to Cas. I don't want to make this harder for him, and if he knows that Chuck might not have been entirely wrong about how I feel about him, it's just going to make this that much harder on him. On both of us."
"Thanks, Cas." He smiled, sliding his fingers into Cas' hair and massaging his scalp lightly.
is Nigel?!”
Eileen nodded encouragingly.
"Dean? Dean, I need to warn you—"
Dean realised that he was trembling as much as Cas was. His knees were buckling, his legs too weak to keep holding him up. He started to sink to the floor of the shower, and wrapping his arms around Dean's chest from behind, Cas came with him, slowing their fall until they were both on the ground, the water pounding against their bodies as they moved against each other mindlessly, every thrust setting every one of his nerve endings on fire.
Dean felt the anger rising up in his chest before he could even begin to try to quell it.
"Nope," beamed Sam, not even trying to be helpful.
"How arrogant to think I wanted
"Cas," Dean whimpered. "So close."
"Have I asked you to leave? Did I tell you I didn't want you living with us? Living with me?" Dean took a breath and when Cas didn't respond he carried on. "I'm sorry for what I said all those weeks ago. I shouldn't have lashed out at you and I regretted it the moment I did, but dammit Cas, I was really hurt."
"So close," Cas whimpered through clenched teeth. "Dean."
Dean tore his attention away from Cas, who was snoring softly for the third time now. He hoped this time he would be able to stay asleep.
“Cas!” Dean interrupted, raising his voice. “That isn’t why I was angry with you.”
"I will take whatever you want to give me, Cas. I'm a selfish fuck and I won't do what's better for the greater good when it comes to you—I can't not have you in my life."
"No, not really," Cas sighed. "He seemed more angry than anything else, afterwards at least."
Laying there against the fluffy white pillows, Dean watched Cas watching him, a small, sexy smirk on his face. He was wearing a short sleeved t-shirt that did nothing to hide biceps that Cas had actually seriously considered biting on several occasions. He was obviously still hard - even the blankets he’d pulled half over himself were doing nothing to hide that, and now Cas was supposed to get into bed with him and somehow not lose the control that was currently stretched so tightly that Cas was worried it would snap completely.
try to rescue you.” Dean looked at him like he had never heard such a stupid question.
Dean seemed to have taken Cas' hesitation as an answer, and he rubbed the back of his neck hard, before getting to his feet. "Coffee. Would you like a coffee? I need coffee."
"The kitchen is huge," Dean yelled, sticking his head through a rounded archway and making an already on edge Cas jump. "And the cabinets are proper solid wood. With a bit of sanding and tlc, this whole kitchen would look like something you'd find in a farmhouse. Kids and chickens running in and out, bread baking in the Aga. It's awesome."
Luckily Dean was too busy to notice Cas watching him, and that was because Gertie was demanding his complete and undivided attention. They were still sprawled on the floor together and Dean was patiently showing her all the tricks Miracle knew.

Trying not to focus on the sinewy muscles of Cas' beautifully defined upper arm and shoulder, Dean placed a towel in his hand.
"I know we're meant to talk about any large chunks of money we take out of the Men of Letters funds," Dean said, bending to stroke Miracle so he didn't have to look at everyone as they stared at him like he'd grown an extra head. "So I'm letting you know. It's gonna need some work - a lot of work, actually. But it's for sale with a shit-load of land. I think it could be home - more of a home than the Bunker is anyway. I feel like I could be at peace there."
would leave me alone long enough for it to be a very relaxing experience, however."
Dean's eyes blatantly said he didn't, and for good reason - there hadn't been one.
"What the fuck is wrong with you, Dean?" he hissed in a whisper as if to avoid waking the unconscious man from his enforced slumber. "That's Gary! He owns the place!"
Cas got to his feet, unsteady for a moment and then regaining his balance as he strode over to Kate.
"I can go with you to talk to someone. It doesn't need to be the same person I talk to. It could be anonymous, if you like? We'll find someone who will talk to you, like in a confession box?"
He couldn't breathe. It was like all the oxygen had been sucked out of the air around him. Not again. This couldn't be happening again.
Sam shook his head. "Yeah, me too."
"I really fucking hate being locked in anywhere," Dean muttered, as he broke away from Cas' lips to press their foreheads together. "And I wish you'd agree to come with us tonight instead of going to Eileen's crappy bachelorette party."
"Dean, if you don't start enjoying yourself, there will be no strippers tonight!" Sam threatened, throwing the magnet back down onto the table, where it bounced and rolled off under the couch.
Dean didn't think it was wise for him to point out that if Cas hadn't opened the door to his pain in the ass of a friend earlier today, they could have been on their second or third round by now.
“Hand,” Cas demanded, putting his hand out for it.
"I know, Cas. I get it. I think about him all the time too, but you've gotta be strong, man. Claire has knocked down all your defences at a really bad time."
"You're family, Cas," Sam added, seeming to realise that sorting things out with Cas was more important than beating Dean over the head with a Monopoly board for ruining his winning streak.
He grabbed the thick blankets and pulled them up, so they were both covered right up to their noses. The heat from Dean's body was almost burning hot next to Cas' chilled skin and Cas tried to hold himself as far away from Dean as he could, turning onto his side and laying his arm flat down his own side.
Since his first glimpse of her familiar brown eyes and freckled nose, Dean had seethed. She was Eileen's friend and he'd had to grit his teeth and firmly tell himself that today wasn't about him, wasn't the time for him to make a scene. The seats had each been marked with tiny name labels, and Dean wished he'd had the foresight to sneak in early and switch them, so Kate was sitting right at the back, as far away from Cas as humanly possible.
"Yes, Dean. It's always for you."
Cas felt sick with panic and horror.
"You didn't think to tell us you were alive?" Claire had returned Dean's hug, but quickly rounded back on Cas. "Do you have any idea what you put Dean through?"
love her." Dean's eyes pleaded with him.
"It's turned into the Angelic version of the Hunger Games up there. Auntie Amara won't put a stop to it, as long as we're only harming each other and staying away from the humans. She's pretty much just cordoned off an area of Heaven for us and left everyone to brawl."
He couldn't. Another moment and he'd be in Dean's arms. He'd be kissing him and holding him and begging him to never leave him again. He couldn't do this. He was down the stairs before Dean had got another word out, hands shaking, breath coming fast, like he had just sprinted for miles rather than just come down a flight of stairs.
Kate’s wary look broke into a smile and she nodded. “I know, Dean. I’m protective of Cas too, because like you said, he’s just so incredibly
Cas' finger was properly bandaged now, and Dean knew he should really let go of Cas' hand.
for the need that coursed through him—it was like all his nerves were on fire.
Dean smiled as Cas racked up the table again, loudly declaring that he was going to 'whoop Kate's ass' this time, a phrase that had definitely come from Dean.
The crippling guilt that crawled inside him was quelled almost instantly by a surge of indignant anger. Cas could accuse him of many things, but neglecting his brother's safety was not one of those things!
“I want to,” Cas interrupted. “But do you mind if I put some music on?"
"Nice one, Cas." Dean shook his head, incredulous. He started to shrug off his coat, apparently of the opinion that this wouldn’t be a five minute conversation. Cas wouldn’t have been surprised if his next move had been to wander into the kitchen to whip up a nice passive aggressive soufflé while he waited.
"Thank you for your help, Sam," Cas said sincerely, and Dean wandered over to pick up his phone. What had started out as a hypothetical date had turned into a hypothetical date… with food. He could definitely go with that.
Dean was still shaking his head, still holding Cas, tears welling up again. It was like everything was overwhelming him, like now he had finally let himself feel, it was like a dam had broken and he couldn't stop it. Cas didn’t know what to do to make him see that he was Dean’s from the moment he'd first laid hands on him. How could Dean ever doubt it when he could see what a mess just a few words from him could make of Cas?
Cas looked at him quizzically. Then more determinedly this time, Dean reached his hand out again, this time stopping an inch from Cas' cheek.
He reached out as if to rub Cas' arms and Cas froze, waiting for the touch of his hands. It never came, Dean had stopped himself and instead was staring at him, looking torn and pained.
"If you're avoiding me, I can fake a headache and go to my room. You shouldn't have to miss out because of me."
Three was overkill. Three was practically a striptease. Three showed the sprinkle of hairs over that triangle of tanned skin that shouldn't
The day wasn't over, it wasn't yet time for Cas to lick his wounds and assess the damage. He had an entire afternoon alone with Dean to cope with, and he knew nothing good was going to come from it. Maybe he'd read Dean wrong? Maybe he wasn't about to be pushed away so hard that Cas might shatter with the force of it? Maybe he was just being pessimistic?
try to dance again.
Cas was pretty sure he started their second kiss, but by the time it was their fourth he no longer had any idea where he ended and where Dean began anymore. They were clinging to each other, hands almost tentative in their exploration of each other, like it was brand new, like something could shatter at any moment.
Cas immediately felt like a selfish asshole.
Dean's hands were relaxing on his hips, not directing so much as gently guiding now. Slowly, purposefully, one of Dean's fingers slid under Cas' shirt to caress his hip bone. Sliding along it he found an indent and explored it with the tip of his finger, sliding just a little way under his waistband. Dean's touch was exquisite and Cas was torn between giving in to it and remembering that he was in a room full of people, with Kate inches from him, hopefully still unaware of what was happening.
