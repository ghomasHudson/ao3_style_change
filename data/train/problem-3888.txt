Dean never forgot that...
Dean never felt as powerless as he did at this very moment…
“Is it true? Did I break the first seal? Did I start all this?” Dean asked with a weak, shaking voice, although he already knew the answer.
“I don’t,” the angel looked at him with the softest look he had ever shown, getting more and more worried about this human with every second. He could sense how guilty he felt, how much it all hurt him… “Dean, they don’t tell me much. I

Why did he agree to Alastair's offer, why after 30 years, he started tearing all these souls apart, when his own father, the man he had always admired the most, the man he had always craved to be like, the man whom he promised himself he'd never fail lasted so much longer than him...?! And to all that he liked it… He enjoyed it… Taking out all his pain on all these souls… It was so liberatory to him… and at what cost…?
“Lucifer? The Apocalypse? What does that mean?” he was on the verge of tears, yet still tried his best to keep it together. “Hey…! Don’t you go disappearing on me, you son of a bitch,
,” he stated - because he was honestly sure of that. He knew their faith rested with him… and he knew Dean, this man, this strong man who had been through so much pain, yet still was lying here, next to him, was able to do it. To conquer it all. Castiel was completely sure of it. Even beside the prophecy itself… he already got to know him as much to believe in him, to trust him… to see how much of an amazing, sincerely good-hearted person he was.

seasons.
The witch screamed louder as she watched the dagger fall, its glint lost in the depths of the river. “What have you done!? Give it back! Give it back!” She shook him, her nails digging into his shoulders.
Castiel breaths a quiet sigh of relief. Should he erase their conversation? He is confident in his technological skills to remove them from the network entirely so that no one, not even Naomi, would be able to find them if they went looking. While his main focus has been zoology with a slight branch into psychology, Castiel has also dabbled a bit in computer sciences.
They must be lying to themselves; trying to make the best of a nightmare.

child’s ear-wings perk up and forward, all the feathers on it puffed out. Does that help it hear better? He has no idea, and he’ll probably never know if the kid doesn’t start talking to him again. Either way, the whole look with the puffy feathers and the head tilt, and the little ‘o’ of its mouth is kinda cute, in a really weird way. And that’s a crazy enough thought to make Dean drop the blade of grass.
The ravaged church still swirled in a vortex around them, bits of wood and books circling the eye of the storm, like planets around a star. Sam had to stop him. Stop the angel from whatever he was doing. Cas was
They spend almost two hours over all the maps, before Rowena points at the tiny park in the middle of the town. Sam frowns.
“Well, since it looks like we’re gonna have to go there anyway, I’d rather have you with us. There’s probably mountain lions and crap out there.”
Dean smirked and reached up to ruffle Sam’s shaggy hair, “Yeah just go get some more beauty sleep now little brother.”
It is not that Castiel does not believe that socialization is not important. Socialization is important in Aetherian society, and Castiel has learned since studying 1-M-7 that it is equally important in Homosapien society as well. He fully understands that it is pertinent to development, managing his own emotions, understanding others’ feelings and needs, and learning to interact with others in a respectful and acceptable way. But he feels like he already has a good grasp on all of that. His lessons provide excellent theory on it, and Naomi has taught him quite a bit on her own. And Castiel has always spent quite a lot of time with her and her co-workers at her place of employment.
At that, Balthazar simply shrugs, though his nose does wrinkle slightly. It is the only indication of his disgust at the thought of actually
Dean huffed a small, nervous chuckle, intent on making yet another ill-timed remark, but he never got the chance.
And this is quite shameful for him to admit, even to his own mother.
“Nope.”
Eventually, the
Sam does slow down a bit, but he’s still focused on eating more than picking for the basket. Dean rolls his eyes at him, only to notice a big log crushing the grass just away from the bush. It’s been there a long time. Long enough for soft green moss growing over it, and it’s gone weak ‘coz half of it is falling inside. A bunch of mushrooms are sprouting under it, fat white heads on fat bodies.
Naomi sighs through her nose and approaches him.
The muscles in Dean’s arms are trembling, and his toes and fingers ache where he’s gripping the rocks. He’s colder than he’s ever been since he came to this place, but it’s not enough to get him to stop. This is his last chance. If it fails, and if he can’t think of any other ways out, then he’s stuck here. And Dean refuses to accept that.
Cautiously, he begins to move forward, parting the grass ahead of him with his hands. By crouching as he walked, 1-M-7 damaged less stalks around him. With the breeze, the grass waves together and obscures everything from view except for the bit of the path directly in front of him. Now Castiel can no longer tell if 1-M-7 is moving again, but at least he can continue to follow the path.
Except…
“And leave Cas?”

steps back from the window to the other side of the passageway again. It drops into another crouch and balances the flat thing on its knees as it turns its attention to that. Dean knows that basically means that they’re done talking. He’s not going to get another answer out of the child. At least not right now. Maybe he can try again later.

Castiel sensed when Dean's mind finally sunk into slumber. A light hum in his conscious told him that Dean’s dreams were pleasant ones, ones filled with contentment and love and a hint of feathers. He caught flashes of images and chuckled to himself.
Sam sighed, the weight of his frown felt over a hundred miles away. “Just be careful Dean and no drinking. I’m serious. If the coast guard calls and tells me your drunk ass fell off the deck, I’m going to- to-“ A note of frustration leaked into the kid’s voice. Sam was a freshman in college, and Dean could never think of him as anything else but ‘the kid.’ ”-you know what I mean! Be safe!”
Instead, Castiel leaned his head in his palms, elbows resting in the dirt. “Will you come to my island again? Are your curiosities sated?”
Balthazar smiles back at him, closed lipped and eyes shining.
Another shadow joined the other and Sam was suddenly aware of his loud heartbeat. His mind raced through all the things he knew about wendigo. He stared at his lighter again, and a smirk spread across his face. He lowered the lighter and the corpses lit aflame. Sam grabbed a broken table leg from off the floor, ripping a piece off of Dean’s already ruined shirt and wrapping it around the top. He popped open one of the oil vials and poured some of the contents onto the now makeshift torch. He dipped the wood tip into the fire, now spreading across the room. Surprised roars echoed as the creatures sprung away from the growing flames.
Castiel’s vessel had disappeared, replaced with his true body, the mighty seraphim. He hovered, impossibly tall, beautiful, and deadly. There was a long pause where all stared at him, a strange silence of bated breath. The obliterated room began to swirl, pieces of debris slowly floating and joining the stream of wood, books, and stone until all was chaos. A hurricane of wind and ruin surrounded them from all sides without a single break. But all seemed peaceful in the center, the eye of the storm silent with false calm. They could do nothing more than cower against the light.
She pulls down a different one with a mold generally resembling the shape of the inside of the

Once everyone has been introduced, the girl shakes her hair out of her face. It’s all loose black curls spilling around her head. Dean thinks it’s really pretty, and not even just because it’s different from the hair of everyone else here.
“Cas.”
Thank you guys for being so understanding, I am glad I could get this chapter out for you guys ^-^
“Lost it?” Dean’s expression soft and accepting.
There are songs in the story, links for the music videos are in the lyrics ^-^
“As long as we don’t gotta hear you two getting it on we’re good.” Gad chuckled as he watched Michael grimace at the thought.
“I’ll make sure you do.”
As for my fic I do plan to come back to it and hopefully soon. It was very hard to come back because i felt like was going to disappoint everyone. You guys however have left so many encouraging messages and nice comments. It's just my own self doubt. I am feeling better and more motivated now. I want to jump back in but I think the best thing to do would be to go back do some editing and fix the story a bit. Refamiliarize myself with everything. I also have this really cute one shot idea for a Beekeeper Cas and Elementary school teacher Dean fic that I wanna write. So I think writing a short fic and doing some editing will help me ease back into things. ^-^
*this is a mini life update you can skip if you'd like  ^-^*
“Cas stay calm.” He was already standing up and rushing to grab his things.

“Explains the price.” Dean smiled goodheartedly. This wasn’t free but their scholarships would cover the housing fees. That didn’t mean they hadn’t taken a look.
Dean could see the tears welling up in Cas’s eyes.
“Sorry….it’s just,” Cas sighed. “Alan and the guys were arguing loudly and I kind of…” Cas covered his face with his free hand.
Somehow that entire exchange was either ignored or unseen by the girls because once they joined everyone else a few girls came over and tried to flirt with them. They were doing their best to try and get them to stop but they weren’t being taken seriously. That is until a few of the guys walked over.
Dean shrugged, “Maybe not right away, he seems like a guy who’s gotta work up the courage to ask. He’s a bit on the shy side.”
This one is a little shorter than normal since I had very specific start and end for this chapter. From here on out I am hoping to get this ball rolling a little bit faster ^-^
Now as luck would have it the day the friendly barista, whom Castiel considered a friend, finally mustered up the courage to ask Cas out was the same day that Dean’s class was cancelled. Dean had decided to grab coffee with Cas before walking him to class the morning of his day off. They walked in as they always did fingers laced together and making sure they were as close as they could be without tripping each other as they walked.
Stay safe out there 💚💙💚💙💚
The Angel stared at him for a moment longer before grabbing him by the collar of his flannel shirt and yanked him in for a deeper kiss. Dean hummed in delight. He had to admit he found aggressive Cas hot as hell. The angel’s tongue darted out and licked deans lip. The sensation ran straight to dean's lower half. He let out a groan. This time the Angel smiled as he pulled away. “I think you can guess my answer.”
"I'd be down if you are. It'll be great to hang out with them." They don't get to talk much these days. He did call them after the football game. He still couldn't believe they all tuned in.
“Cas, babe.”
“No costume?” Cas asked glancing over at his cousin.
“We’ll you are a stubborn one.”
A male barista had found himself drawn in by the blue eyed baseball player that dropped by every Tuesday first thing before classes. He’d remembered Castiel’s drink and how to properly spell his name. Castiel was not a flirt in any definition of the word. The barista could tell that from his end Castiel was simply friendly and bright. However, he couldn’t help but hope that if he asked for a date he might get a yes.
Hey guys got this one out on time wooh
Dean frowned in confusion. “Babe? Where are you?”
Hey guys hoped you like this chapter. I've had this idea in my head for a long time now and was looking for the right spot to put it in. It's much shorter that any other chapter i've written for this story but I had fun with it. Now if anyone didn't like it no worries, this was the only chapter I had in mind like this.
PS: I am going to leave this up even when I add more to the story. I would hate to lose the comments everyone has left me. However, if it causes reading and story issues I'll take it down. Please let me know.
“Are you behind?”Dean asked non judgmentally. He felt Cas shake his head. He was sobbing softly against his shoulder. His messy haired boyfriend shifted to sit in his lap on the floor.
“Yeah but not outside the bedroom or bathroom.”
I love the friendship between Gad and Micheal in this store. I never planned on them being childhood best friends but I love that bond. I am also happy with some of the development Cas is going through and them learning College and Hs are quite different. Hope you guys enjoyed the chapter. I think I am easing into this new pacing system. I am excited to move this along. I have so many cool things planned.
Headed home
“Dean….my uncle is still writing it’ll be a while before it’s over. “
“Will someone please tell us what’s so funny.”
“Dean I really think you should have just stayed at Benny’s.”
Cas sat in the living room watching a netflix original, it wasn’t too bad, as he waited for Dean to get home. He must have fallen asleep because the next thing he knew he was being woken up by his phone ringing. He shot up and grabbed it not looking at the name or time.
Cas chuckled, “Only this time you’ll get more than a kiss at the end of the night.” He watched Dean blush as he winked.
“I know,” Cas ran his hand through Dean’s hair. “My uncle said he’d send you an advanced copy of the next book when he gets them.”
“I’ll keep dat in mind, probably need it at some point. So tell me how’s your betta’ half doin’?”
“I don’t know but things seemed to have worked out for the better.” Cas glanced over to see his friend giving Dean’s friend his number. The girls smiled with a blush on her cheeks. Huh, maybe more confident then Dean gave him credit for. “Seems he worked up the courage pretty quickly.”
“Sorry sir, only family.”
Hey guys hope you liked this chapter. This was supposed to go up last week but IRL stuff got crazy. Back in sept I believe my store got a new manager and it's been so stressful. it was getting very bad. Then two weeks ago she got moved to a new store and the new manager is great. She's so opposite the old one it's feeling like whiplash, but things are doing better. That last store manager almost had me going on my anxiety meds after not needing them for 2 years. I am feeling much more creative now and much less stressed. I even spoke with my district manager today about the issues me and my team had had.
“Hold on Dean give me one second.” Cas? He was sure that was his voice. He heard Cas get up and move around wherever they were. Sounded like linoleum flooring. Where were they? They weren’t at home. What happened? His brain felt fuzzy. He heard the pull of window shades and then Cas walking back. “You can open your eyes now, I pulled down the shades.”
Dean groaned in pain as he woke up. He felt like he’d been through hell, back and then some. He tried to open his eyes but everything was too bright.
“Hey brotha’,” Benny’s voice rumbled through the phone Dean held up to his ear. He was currently sitting at a table outside waiting for Cas to get out of class.
Mary hung up her phone and looked over to see a crying Castiel. The poor thing. She went over so she could give him a hug but before she’d even taken a step John had to boy wrapped up in a hug. She ran a hand over her mouth, she was close to tears that her oldest was in the hospital and now tears were threatening to bubble up at the sight of John and Cas. She’d always hoped to see John finally accept him fully as one of their own, and here it was. Dean and Cas didn’t need to be married or anything to consider Cas part of the family, to the Winchesters he and his family were their family.
“I need to see him,” Cas was near tears, should he lie? How much trouble would he get into? Did it matter?
“I get the feeling you have an announcement.” Cas leaned against him and sipped his coffee.
“I am sure my uncle will make the ending as best as he can for everyone.” Cas had gotten off the phone with his uncle. Chuck had given him permission to tell Dean that they’d decided on a book cut off number. It was still going to be a while before the series ended but his uncle said he needed to put a number on it or he’d never stop writing. He had other ideas and projects he wanted to work on.
“If I got final decision I’d say yes but you know it isn't that easy.”
One more kiss before Dean helped Cas into his coat and took his hand as they left the room to head to the diner.
“No, no, no,” Dean stopped him, putting both hands on his arms, “No — you did nothing wrong… Trust me, what you were doing was good, but…” Dean searched Cas’s hurt face, trying to explain what he needed. “I — I just want to be with you right now Cas. I was dead barely over a day ago and am still processing all this… I know you’ve been waiting for this for a long time but — give me some time, please, be patient for me. I’m not saying no to you Cas, I’m just saying no now, alright?” Cas nodded but there was still a hint of underlying confusion that Dean could sense from him. He sighed, “Once we get into bed I’ll tell you, okay?” Cas nodded again, this time a bit more reassured. Satisfied for now, Dean took off his own clothes while Cas slipped into his sweatpants and shirt. He caught Cas looking once or twice but he just grinned at him, trying to defuse some of the tension. It seemed to work as Cas smiled softly back at him.
of an idea that he might be leaning towards being a Sapien Sympathizer.
for it all.
Dean huffs and rubs at his arm while they’re crossed over his chest. He’s sitting in the corner across from the pond, shoulder against the clear wall, and waiting. Cas is probably going to show up soon, and he’s gonna be
“I found it!” Sam yells, when really in the middle of all these trees a very small cave is seen. It’s pitch dark in there, but around the cave are even more poppies. Rowena is out of breath once she reaches him but she nods.
A rumble of frustration vibrates in his chest and Castiel drums his fingers against the edge of his desk. He shuffles his wings, and his ear-wings flicker in annoyance. Should he message Anna for a hint? His pride does not want him to, but if she wants him to read the file, then why did she protect it to this extent?
Dean swallowed and nodded, “I’ll go. Impala is fast, she’ll bring us back in time.”
His bitter cursing of this place cuts off sharply when May doesn’t return to Lily’s side. Instead, she puts her hands on her hips and turns to look at where Dean is mostly hidden. His stomach sinks and he knows exactly what is about to happen next. May has been really trying to get to know him, and he’s flat out refused to allow it to happen. Because of how nosy she is, Dean hasn’t even told anyone his name yet, purely out of spite.
than Dean and he hates it. At least Lily still treats her like a kid. If May was treated more like a grown up than Dean, he’d be a lot angrier with May than he’s ever been.
“Yeah yeah, gawk at the freak.” Dean offered the blond, bright-eyed woman a grin as he glanced around, “How’s the wife?”
He started up the shore, immediately noticing the driftwood was surprisingly sparse. There should be a lot of debris clogging up the area, churned up by the sharp rocks dotting the shoreline. Instead, there were wavy lines in the sand, long and broad, that, he knew it sounded crazy, sort of reminded him of the patterns of a ‘Zen’ garden he’d seen while channel surfing through some home-decorating channel.
Dean closes his eyes, when Castiel leans closer. Finally he would

It’s kind of funny, isn’t it? Dean always thought that he would prefer to live on the ground. He thought it would be safer. Now he’s down here and he doesn’t feel safe at all. They said it’s perfect here, which must mean that there are no predators. He did a lap of this place, and he didn’t see anything that would suggest the pack hunters – the
“That’s great, Sammy!” Dean ruffles his hair and holds up the basket. “Add ‘em, kay?”
“You talked.” 1-M-7’s voice is barely more than a hoarse whisper. “You
Dean swallowed, “I don’t know… what you think it means, and why Cas…” He cleared his throat, avoiding his brother’s gaze.
No matter how many times he is sedated and moved to the calming room, and this has happened at least once a lunar cycle, it does not seem to be doing 1-M-7 any good. He continues to isolate himself from the tribe, and Castiel believes this is negatively impacting him. Unfortunately, there is nothing Castiel can do to help, aside from actually

here. They don’t need to make preserves to last through the
Cas chuckles softly. Dean really cares about him, didn’t he? Why an angel would have such an interest in a hunter is beyond him, but maybe it would be a nice change having Dean around. If it were anyone else, he would’ve fought harder on the issue. But Dean is an angel, the chances of him dying because of Castiel are slim to none. Maybe he should push him away, make him realize how much of a risk he was, but Dean has been nothing but insistent so far. Deep down Cas knows that no matter how hard he tries, he will never convince Dean to leave him. Dean has seen his stubbornness and his anger and seems all the more persistent because of it. What does Dean see in him? There’s only one way to find out.
Thick branches support the platforms of the village. Posts line the edges with nets of vines strung between each of them, made strong by the addition of rope. Dean has even helped his parents make the rope. He’s gone down to the forest floor with them, found the fibrous plants, gathered them, and carried them back up. They sat in their home tree, took sharpened flint, and spent days peeling and cutting them into strips before weaving them together.
of her totem. Is that what wool looks like?
He barely even has the time to picture it in his head before its grasping hands are closing around his back and yanking him away from the wall. The knife stays stuck between some of the rocks, and Dean loses sight of it quickly behind all the water. It’s the last thing he cares about right now, because now he’s dangling in the middle of the air underneath the smooth silver thing that stole him from his family. Its pincer hands are wrapped around his shoulders and digging into his armpits, and that’s the only thing keeping him from falling down, down,
“No…” Dean cut him off, pulling back from their circle, facing the angel, “Don’t be sorry… be thankful.” Dean’s hand came to rest on the angel’s neck, thumb gently stroking the skin there. Sam eyed them both, eyebrows raised in question, but neither of them seemed to notice.
. The new specimen will be designated 1-M-7; the seventh male specimen from Alpha Sector (or, colloquially, Sector One). Age to be determined by analysis of his teeth. As of yet, 1-M-7 has not had a negative reaction to the tranquilizer, thankfully. He is from Tribe Site C in the jungle trees.

As the light grew brighter, Dean felt more disconnected. He was floating far away, further and further from everything he’d ever known.

means he will need to get used to seeing them talk and eat. With that firmly fixed in mind, Castiel takes control of one of the cameras and focuses it on 1-M-7’s face to observe him specifically. His face is red, covered in tears, and filled with emotions.
Dean freezes when he hears that unfamiliar hiss. He looks up, bowl to his lips, and watches as two

them.
It’s really weird. His teeth sink deep into the weird squishy part of the arches. Everything about it makes his whole mouth tingly, and Dean tries poking at the sides with his tongue. That just makes it numb and tingly too. What in the world is this thing?
His little brother pushes the rest of his ridiculously long body through the circle and swims towards him.
Finally, he knocks on the clear wall again. “Are you gonna give me a name or not?”
Castiel’s voice ravaged Sam’s eardrums. Sam shook his head, knowing this had to be done, “hoc maledictum, et ponam —”
The vines shift, parting right down the middle, and Dean holds his breath to make sure that he doesn’t move. Ellen –
Beyond the government building, a waterfall rises up from the lake. It is not very large, and again purely aesthetic, but the science district of the city lies above it and spreads to the far edge. The majority of their city is devoted to this district. It is composed of domed buildings grouped by their branches of science and connected with covered walkways.
After making sure the longlines were untangled, and the hold still had a functional layer of ice, he readied her for the day. The chances of getting back before dark were slim to none, but he’d faced worse before.
“Are we done now?” He looks at Cas again.
His toes hurt, and his hands hurt, but Dean still drags himself up against the push of the water. He figures he’s probably about halfway up the rock wall at the moment. This part seemed to have the least amount of water falling down it, but it doesn’t feel that way right now. Dean shakes the water out of his eyes and tests his grip on the rocks with his free hand and his feet. When he’s sure he’s got a good grip, he pulls the knife free and stabs it between a few rocks even higher up.
“The police officer is still awake, I called him earlier and he will expect us.” Sam says and Dean nods. Leave it to Sammy, always prepared before the fight even starts. Dean parks right in front of the police station at  the end of the town and gets out of his car.
He rocks his head side to side and then back and forward. As he leans back, Dean looks up at the clear bridge. There’s only a handful of
And there he stayed until the dawn came, and with it, the sound of sirens as the sun rose to start another day.

language that they have on file. This interest in their languages has placed Castiel within the minority of his future coworkers. From what he has gathered from listening to his mother’s conversations, most do not see the point of trying to understand a species they see as inferior.
Dean’s vision went white. He felt Cas splatter across his stomach and a strange buzz of something brushing his arms. He collapsed on top of Cas as they rode out the high together, panting breathlessly until they were finally left hugging each other in the darkness of the room.
Castiel is completely and utterly mystified by 1-M-7. He has seen many
Yeah, of course Dean remembers. He’s pretty sure he’s never going to ever forget it, even when he dies of old age in countless seasons from now. Still, part of him is excited to see who it could be. Even though he would never wish this place on anyone, not even his worst enemies (though the closest thing he has to that is Dick), but it would still be nice to see a familiar face.

More of her co-workers are crowding in around them, and a half-dozen adults are now pressing in to watch the initial review of their latest specimen. Castiel is barely tall enough to see in and he stretches up as tall as he can to watch.
For now, he ignores the food and focuses on the wall across from the door. What could possibly be on the other side of that wall? Are there more rooms and passageways like Rufus mentioned? Dean chews on the inside of his cheek, thinking hard about it. He has no idea when the

“Dude it’s fine. We don’t mind.” Dean tried to hide a smile as Cas wrapped an arm around his waist.

“Cas, I am not getting in that flying death trap.”
“The workload for your classes overwhelming?”
He was quickly introduced to Dean. As the name left Cas’s lips the man remembered all the times Cas had mentioned him. Thinking back over the conversations now he couldn’t believe how he’d missed all the signs. The affection in Castiel’s tone as he mentioned Dean not to mention how frequently he mentioned Dean. The signs were there he just hadn’t paid attention.
Dean surprised Cas first thing in the morning with a beautiful bouquet. Cas had to walk into his first class with it.  He was beaming in pride at all the envious looks he’d gotten. Dean had made a replica of the bouquet from last year and Cas was absolutely in love with it.
Some of you might know I worked in retail for quite some time. I hit my 5year anniversary at my job in 2020. It was so stressful last year running a store during all of this. I did it and the store did well. I was up for promotion. All that was left was to check the boxes and send out the emails. But, at the last second they gave my store to someone else, told me to wait. (they'd made promises they couldn't keep and figured i would be the one to put up less of a fight) That was the final straw. So two weeks before black friday I put my two weeks in. It was the best decision ever. I've seen an uptick in my physical and mental health since i left. My new job makes me less money but I am in a much better place now. It's been rough but we've been making our way. I've started an online shop and taking time to do things I never had the time to do before.
Pursing his lips, Cas looked up again, a determined frown adorning his features. “Dean — I want to stay here.”
There was a large shift in the air, a dark wave washing over the room like a sigh.
Cas nods at the ones watching, and one of them nods back. Dean kinda feels like he recognizes that one, but he can’t really place where or why. He’s probably seen it around at some point. The wings aren’t anything special, not rainbow black like Cas’s, but white on the underside and mottled brown on top.
“Dean, I’ve just had a thought.”

Cas and Sam followed down the steps behind him as he plopped the duffel bag on the table, sighing as he paused and took a relieved breath. He was home. Dean thought he would never see this place again yet here he was. It welcomed him back, same as always. Funny though how so much had changed since they’d left.
“Man, that must’ve hurt,” Dean mumbled as they rounded the table. “It looks clean. Any idea what it was?”
He stepped out on the deck with a thermos of coffee, watching the waves filter by. Gulls were left by the shore, and soon there was nothing but a stretch of dark ocean. Spray kicked up over the coaming, threatening to salt up his coffee. Scowling, he tugged his knit cap down a little further and angled his shoulders away from the spray, determined to enjoy his brew out on deck instead of the weathered wheelhouse.
One building has been devoted to the arts, both visual and musical. His people do not sing, but they have many instruments that produce quite lovely sounds. They make paintings, and pottery, carve statues from stone, and reliefs in wood. Those that feel an artistic calling, or need to give their minds a break, flock there to try their hand at
Castiel documents each member of the tribe that speaks with 1-M-7, taking note to monitor if any relationships form between them. At the moment, the mated pair of 1-M-2 and 1-F-1 seem to be the most concerned with his well being. They have a young female child of their own. Are they going to attempt to adopt 1-M-7 into their familiar unit? That seems the most logical. The only other specimen with a child is 1-F-2, but she appears to be intent on raising her daughter on her own.

There are many new things that Castiel has thought about since 1-M-7 was collected. He has spent a

Dean almost wants to laugh, and he doesn’t really know why. Instead, he shakes his head and sits back, propping himself up on his hands.
“What do you think you’re doing, Castiel?”
And Castiel does not doubt that 1-M-7 would
The sea is dark, as it always is this late at night. The shimmer of fish overhead mimics the stars Dean so occasionally sees when he heads to the surface. He eyes the silver school as they swim together in a single harmonious body, unaware of his presence, his dark grey tail blending into the bottom of the depths.

His movements gradually begin to slow. He can feel the exhaustion weighing him down in the water. This is it, isn’t it? It’s all been a lie and now he’s stranded in the middle of nowhere. But he couldn’t give up, not yet, even if his belly protests with hunger and his limbs sink like stones.

“What if you run from them when you’re in the passageway?” Dean turns back to Rufus, interrupting him about the testing room.
“Dude, save some for the trip back.”
How any of them can say that it’s
“The ‘Sleepy Hollow’ is very nice.” The nurse answers and the name alone makes Dean reconsider his options for the night. But the nurse smiles again and Dean can’t really help his own smile. Something about her makes him almost dizzy and he nods. The other nurse comes back and glares openly at him.

compared to Dean, even from all the way on the other side of the room.
His first urge is not to listen. But, the sooner he complies, and sooner he can get out of here, hopefully. Dean sighs, and then takes a few deep breaths. Holding them for a moment before whooshing the air out again. Big must be satisfied with whatever he hears, because he steps away and goes back to the shelf. He puts the listening thing on shelf and looks through some other things while Cas starts poking away at the flat thing.
As promised, an encrypted file comes in a moment later. Castiel stares at it for a long while, unsure how to answer Anna, or whether he should attempt opening the file. To open it would be to admit his interest in Sapien Sympathizers. To open it…
? But… If he wants the kid to trust him, he should probably build some kind of

“Why don’t you call Rowena? I’m sure she would love to hear from you.” Dean grins then and laughs, when he hears how Sam smacks his head under the bed, before he comes up again and gives him another bitch face, now rubbing over his head.
Cas finally lets himself fall onto the steering wheel, absolutely drained, emotionally, physically, it didn’t matter. He knows he shouldn’t have been such a dick but he just wants some peace and quiet — and some damn coffee. He can apologize to Dean later.

will ever be able to catch him again.
Dean huffs and crosses his arms, pulling his hand from Ellen’s in the process. He glares at Cas, trying to figure out how he’s going to argue with him about this. But then he feels a pressure against his upper left arm. He looks back quickly to see Big turning away and already going back to the shelf. Dean rubs his arm and looks at Ellen, and her face is pulled into a wince.
Dean’s eyes widen when he sees Gabriel sitting next to him and he already believes this is just another nightmare as the door burst open and Sam comes in with Rowena. Sam is at his side in seconds and he hugs Dean almost too hard.
It’s starting to get hard to breathe. There’s no ceiling above him; just the clear space the

It’s his short patience that Dean blames for what happens next.
“Why is he angry?” Dean asks and Castiel sighs heavily.
you.”
Unfortunately, since they are not shouting like 1-M-7, Castiel cannot hear him. He has to rely on the recording devices within the transition room translating and sharing the conversation for him. The adults try to lure 1-M-7 from under the furs, and they do succeed… to some extent. 1-M-7 launches himself from under the furs and sprints past them, and Castiel finds that very interesting.
It took a minute to comprehend what Cas was asking. He had so many questions, so much he wanted to know. But for now, he turned, looking down at Dean’s body. “Do it,” he said without hesitation, quelling the desperate excitement in his voice.
Naomi looks away, ear-wings twitching back again, likely thinking over the hypothesis.
He reaches out to nudge Castiel’s shoulder, which is in and of itself an odd gesture. Aetherians do not often touch others without reason.
It takes Dean a moment to realize that she must mean her son. He has no interest in replacing her son for her, or sharing a tent with another family. None of these people will ever be his

HIs body was worse for wear but his mind wasn’t any better. He was in shock. The image of twisting light was burned into his mind — literally, it felt like. It wasn’t Cas’s fault, Dean knew this… but the pain resonated through his body, making it difficult to think straight. Wings, eyes, flames…
There was a moment of irrational amusement when the chirp of a bird snapped him from the accidental staring contest. The birds began chirping again, and that had to count for something- Right?

fault that he keeps picking fights with him. If Dean had it his way, he would never interact with Dick at all. But he’s the one that keeps seeking Dean out. All Dean does is stand up for himself.
“Tua fortitudo recedes et potentia fades,” Sam started again, rushing through the words, “in hac terra manere, donec ego levo —”
Now that leaves a bitter flavour on the back of his tongue. His stomach grumbles and Dean realizes that he’s probably going to be pretty hungry today. The

“Nice to meet you too, Cas,” Dean smiles sleepily.
“It sounds interesting. Not sure if it’s supernatural but we can judge that once we get there.”
His wings flare and he stands sharply, nearly falling backwards off his roost. If it were not for the grip of his talons, he may actually have fallen. Instead, Castiel pinwheels his arms before grabbing the bar on which he usually rests his arms and head as he sleeps. Once satisfied he will
Dean failed to hold back a groan as the angel ravaged his throat with tongue and teeth, sucking and nipping and soothing. After a minute, Cas reluctantly drew back, hissing into his skin, “Too long.”
“Let it happen Sammy!” Dean’s voice was cracking, breaking like his body and now his soul. “This can’t end any other way. The least I can do is get most of us out of this alive. This is my burden to bear.”

to the homo sapiens as it always should have been. Without an Aetherian presence, they could evolve across the planet like they were always meant to.
“I thought I’d lost you both,” Sam whispered.
And then he fell, collapsing onto the cold stone floor.
“Dean.” Castiel says, when he comes back in the room. Sam raises his eyebrows, when Castiel addresses only Dean, but then again he is probably used to this by now. Dean wants to wipe that shiteating grin off his face anyway.
Ellen, not moving-painting Ellen – leans through them. She glances around the room, frowning slightly.
The cecaelia glances up briefly before eating again, this time at a much slower pace. His tentacles slowly return to their blue hue as he deflates back onto the cave floor.
Fear gives way to anger and Dean throws the fur off. He stomps over to the door that Ellen pointed at and he bangs at it, shouting at the painting-Ellen and up to the

At some point, May comes over to help for a while. She chatters away, mostly to Victor and Rufus.

It gets her all huffy, but Victor or Rufus are quick to distract her from bothering him

And then an idea starts to form. Dean crosses the short distance to bang his fist against the see-through wall until the child looks up at him again. He crosses his arms and looks away. “Can you get me seeds?”
Rowena is sitting close, but working on sewing beads into some new piece of clothing. Lily has all but dragged May away to the pool, getting back to work washing and hanging furs, leathers, and other clothing. Jo is trying to help them, but she gets distracted easily, wandering off and back again when it pleases her.
Continuing to ignore May, Dean finishes off his first fish. He tosses the bones into the basket where they’re kept to be cleaned and used to make tools, or as decoration. The second fish is cooked fully, and Dean pulls the stick from the dirt. He’ll save it back at his camp for something to eat later on. If he’s not going to eat anything brought to them by the
The angel’s touch grew colder and his face twisted in despair as he gazed upon Dean’s face. “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry.

Dean remembered roughly the direction he’d gone the week before but navigating back to the clearing was still difficult when he had the cooler in his arms.
He is fascinated by 1-M-7.
There’s a really big pile of sticks shoved off to one side of the entrance of Frank’s tent. Someone must have collected them for him, because Frank would never leave his tent long enough to gather up all of that from what falls from the trees in the sad excuse for a forest this place has.

have been around for generations.
He bows his head further.
On their way out of the field and into the small room with the pile of furs, Dean checks the bridge. Cas had been there earlier, crouched off to the side like usual. He’s not there now, though, and Dean can’t help wondering if that means Cas will be in the room for the test again.
May has been using Dean’s name almost nonstop since Ellen told them what it was. She’s been a smug little jerk about it too. All she’s wanted from him, besides pestering him to play with her all the time, has been to give her his name. Luckily, she hasn’t said anything that would make him want to fight with her. Mostly, Dean has been trying to ignore her. She tends to lose interest pretty quickly if he doesn’t engage, but she still uses his name the whole time.
What kind of meat is in it? Fish, probably. Dean really doubts that there’s any
“Um, hi,” he replies, voice not as strong as he would like.
Determined to show just how much he cared, Dean grabbed the back of Cas’s shirt, pulling himself as close as possible, almost aggressive as he pressed himself against the angel in a hug. His arms shaking he pressed his face into Cas’s shoulder, still sniffling. He pushed his legs between Cas’s, tangling them so they were as close as possible. Trembling he spoke into Cas’s ear, “You’re one of the best things that’s ever happened to me Cas. I can’t ask for a better friend, you’ve done so much for me, probably stuff that I don’t even know about — and I love you Cas, I love you so much and I don’t know how to tell you.”
Lily starts up another song, and May joins in. After a few plinking tunes, a drum starts up from inside Frank’s tent. Dean doesn’t know this song either, and he desperately wishes for the familiar songs of his own tribe. He pulls the blanket over his head, and puts his hands over his ears. Another sting of tears makes his nose tingle, and he squeezes his eyes shut against it.
Dean paused, “I know she did… G-got a plan?”
Dean isn’t the only one growing like a weed. May and Jo are getting bigger too. Often, May runs around in the same kind of loincloth that Dean does. Or she wears shapeless dresses of fabric that are stiched simply together in a way that can be undone and adjusted to be bigger as she grows. Jo is wearing hand-me-downs that May has outgrown, and she is
The realization he had accepted the presence of ‘mojo’ right along with the fact that there was a fairy tale species living on the island tore a delirious chuckle from him, harsh in the quiet of the small ensuite.
Dean quivered where he lay, hands over his face as he huddled on the floor. Dean tentatively opened his eyes, a whimper on his lips. “C-Cas?”
May passes by under his tree, and he holds his breath so she doesn’t notice him. “C’mon!” She sounds frustrated as she stomps around, checking behind every tree. “You can’t hide from us forever, you know! We’re a tribe and you gotta be a part of it!”
Sam smiled, “Yeah, I think I found that out once I accidentally ripped one trying to put it on.”
as they speak to one another. If he wanted to, he could easily listen in. His
The urge to shift on his feet makes his muscles tense and Castiel steels himself against it. He takes another deep, steadying breath.
He turns his gaze away only to stop at the odd look Sam is giving him. “What?” he frowns.
He averts his gaze, instead burning it into the tree in front of him. “I called you here for a reason, you know.”
got back.
Several minutes pass before he is forced to stop, his limbs refusing to let him go any further. He yells in frustration, his lone voice echoing into the water and out into the unknown. He hates this place and its infinite nothingness. He wants home, he wants Sam. For a while, he floats in silence and then he hears an answering call.
Castiel breathes a quiet sigh of relief through his nose when 1-M-7 finally picks up the food the tribe left for him. He stands and looks up at the bridge and the gathered Aetherians with one last glare. The camera on Castiel’s screen magnifies it enough to show the hatred in his green eyes. Castiel is almost taken aback by it. He has never had anyone

to be bothered by it. There are too many unanswered questions where Cas is concerned, and it’s an itch at the back of Dean’s mind that he can’t get any answers.
. His wonder only makes her smile grow, and she sits down on the log next to Dick.
Cas’s face softened, hands raising to rest on Dean’s own, “I stand by what I said… good things do happen Dean. Trust me...”
While Sam studies the grass around them for the green shoots of garlic or onions. Either would be good to add to the food they’re going to cook at the celebration. Dean finds a kinda flat rock nearby and he uses the edge to help him dig up the mushrooms. He tosses them into the basket, mouth already starting to water thinking about how good

Why can’t he just go
Castiel starts for him, the manta rising from his place in the sand, “It was nice to meet you, Dean Winchester. May the sea bring you many blessings and —”
While the tribe does have big clay pots where they keep water, Dean doesn’t know where the pots came from. At least he knows the bowl was made by Donatello, having watched him make it from the pieces of wood Ellen and Bill gathered from the trees. Donatello carved and sanded the bowl just for Dean, so it must be safe to use. It hasn’t been

Once, Dean used one of the words that Frank had said because he cut his finger while working on a project Bill had given to him to do. It made Rowena, Dick, and Victor laugh. Lily was really angry at him for it, and she dragged May away for the rest of the day. Bill and Ellen took Dean aside afterwards and gave him a stern talking to about how some words aren’t appropriate to say in good company. Except that Frank says them a lot of the time, especially when he’s muttering about the
“Maybe someone lives there,” Dean said as they watched the tall edifice, “It's the closest thing to us. We might be able to stay the night and get some info.”
Taking two strips of cloth from his wardrobe, Castiel props first his foot against the bottom rung of his roost. One end of the cloth has a hook in it that attaches to a corresponding loop on the outside end of the cuff of his pants. He latches them together and starts the somewhat tedious process of wrapping around his calf and down to where the downy feathers start at his ankle. The other end of the cloth strip has a rough patch that adheres to other fabric. With a firm press, it holds to binding and won’t come loose until peeled apart.
After a while of wiggling the stick in the dirt, Rufus and Victor join him. They both have sticks of their own, and they start two more lines a few paces apart from where Dean is working, going in the same direction as him. Dean nods at them, but otherwise doesn’t say anything else. One of these days, he’s going to have to get over himself and actually talk to the people here normally. Even though everyone here doesn’t seem to mind talking at him without him talking back, Dean kind of misses actually talking.
“You want me and not him?” Lisa asks and she reaches out to cup Dean’s cheek. Dean leans against her and nods, his long eyelashes touching the blush, when he closes his eyes under her touch.

of berry bushes nearby. Dean has a basket and he holds one side while Sam holds the other. He leads the way and Sam follows along, the grass almost up to his shoulders. As soon as Sam spots the berries, he drops the basket and staggers forward. Dean is right behind him, and he starts picking. Sam helps, but for every fistful that goes into the basket, another goes into his mouth, blue smearing across his chubby little cheeks.
“Dean…” Sam’s hand was on his shoulder again, “Are you okay?” Both him and Adahy’s eyes were on him still.
“And you will not be leaving.”
She looks down at him, confused. “What?”
He had to know. For his peace of mind, he had to go back.

The angel’s mouth curled slightly. Then Dean turned and opened the door, herding them out of the building and back to the parking lot, where they proceeded to drive back to the nearest hotel to prepare for the day ahead.
“Yeah, but only we share a profound bond.” Dean says and is surprised at that himself. He never mentioned that bond before, only Castiel ever did that, but Dean fights a blush right now, while his tummy flutters.
“Goodbye then, for now, Dean.” The Naga’s rough voice speaking his name prickled up his spine and Dean dumbly nodded with a weak handwave before he turned to meander his way back to the beach.
Dean patted his gun, “Ready.”
Minutes stretched by, and after the Naga had ‘consumed’ three oranges, Dean couldn’t take the silence any longer. “So…Are you the only one here?”
“They want to learn about us.” Ellen pats his back lightly. “You saw the other me, right?”
Dean smirked, confidence rising in his chest, “Oh I’ve got an idea alright… but you’re not gonna like it.”

The curiosity gets too much and Dean looks up at Big. “Are you a boy too?”

“I’ll do what I can,” Dean resigned, “But if I can’t… you keep to your promise.”
Castiel tensed, Dean felt it as his claw dug further and he struggled silently, vision blurring. “Dean! DEAN!” Sam’s voice cut through the chaos but Dean knew he couldn’t help. He looked up.
Dean hummed, just staring at Cas’s smile and the joy that came with it. Eventually his eyes wondered, exploring the expanse of Cas’s body. It was his turn to touch.

Burying under them, Dean flattens himself out as best he can and ignores any aches in the back of his neck. He lifts them back just a little bit, just enough for him to keep an eye on the door and whatever might be coming through it. Painting-Ellen did say that she would be waiting, but what if she’s as flat and unresponsive in person? And who else is here? Will there be anyone from his tribe?

stays up all the bridge all day. It just stays there and watches them work, or pays attention to the stupid flat thing it carries around everywhere. But it’s not alone. While Dean, Rufus, and Victor work, more and more
With a huff, Dean runs a hand through his hair to fix it before fixing Bill with a squinty pout. Of course Ellen went and told everyone his name before he was brought back from the Alone Room a few days ago. He doesn’t mind that too much, but now everyone keeps saying it every time they talk to him. It’s a little weird, especially as he kinda got used to everyone calling him ‘Kid’. Now they’re all being… really…

He could hear Sam snort, spoon clinking in what was no doubt a cereal bowl. The kid had never gotten the hang of being able to fix anything but cereal or a salad, no matter how hard Dean had tried to teach him the basics. “At least wait til someone can go with you. I don’t like you being out there alone.”
“Or two-spirit?”

She smiles and waves at him, even though her eyes aren’t really looking
Big finishes up whatever it is that he was doing, and he walks back to the shelf. He comes back right away with two arches stuck together with a little flat piece between them that Big is holding on to. The arches look soft and spongy, and Dean gets an uneasy feeling in his stomach. He doesn’t like the look of it, and he turns to Ellen, and then Cas for some kind of explanation.
Victor nods along, because of course he understands. They were from the same tribe. As far as Dean knows, Victor was younger when Rufus was taken, but they still knew of each other from their tribe before then.
Why is 1-M-5 doing this? He should have allowed 1-M-7 to adjust to his new surroundings. Eventually, he would most likely have sought the care and comfort of others.
expressions. Like, his ear-wings will twitch, or his eyebrows will pinch together. He’s even smiled a couple of times, and his eyes get all wide when he’s excited. But he didn’t move a muscle while he was talking during the tests.
“Dean!” Castiel calls out, but there is no answer. Castiel’s shoulders sag and that’s when he realizes something. He gasps loudly and turns his head to one side and just as he had thought, his wings are back.
The Beta Sector enclosure is built fairly similar to the Alpha Sector. A waterfall and pool of water are at the far end, but the thicket of trees in the Beta Sector enclosure is much smaller. It is located on the far side from the Alpha Sector enclosure. The vast majority of the rest of the space consists of high grass from the plains. It sways in an artificial breeze, rustling quietly. From where Castiel is standing, he can see the Beta Sector camp is also on lockdown like the Alpha Sector camp. Aetherians are starting to activate and release lanterns to light this enclosure as well.

Instead of waving, he lifts just his middle finger and holds that up in Cas’s direction. Victor taught him that it’s an offensive gesture, and that it’s just like swearing at someone. Dean has also learned a few colourful words from some of the grown-ups. Frank, in particular, had some really good ones to learn. Rufus always shushes Frank when he uses them while the kids are near enough to hear him. Dean doesn’t really understand why. It’s not like any of them know what the words actually
The faint memory of jagged rocks around the island flared briefly to life in the back of his mind, but that too felt unimportant.

about his health or anything else about him. It puts a bad taste in Dean’s mouth and he turns on his heel, stomping back to his corner.
Cas cocked an eyebrow, a knowing smirk on his face, “Well next time don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
“Just a spell we found along with that book of yours. Oh and your welcome to try and look for it, but it may be a pile of ash when you find it. Kinda had to use it as an ingredient.”
“How do we kill him?” Sam only asks, because he hopes that Dean would wake up from that. Otherwise he has no idea how to kill the god, maybe a bullet would be enough? Or cutting his head off? Some wood through his heart?
The messaging application indicates that Anna is typing a reply, and he is briefly surprised that she is responding so promptly. His heart starts pounding in his chest when her messages finally comes in.
“Oh, I hate this part.” Ellen’s whole face crumples. She takes Dean’s hand that’s closest to her, and squeezes it. “Just look at me, okay? Don’t look at what he’s doing.”
tribe is a lot more strict about clothing than his.
He nods, PADD and stylus at the ready.
A simple touch to a panel on the wall opens his wardrobe, and it slides out into the center of the room from next to the panel. Bolts of cloth and the belts that hold them hang evenly from the spaced rungs along its length, along with his shirts and pants.

Thankfully, it does not take long for Castiel to finish transcribing the conversations and completing the report. He even includes everything that was said to Dean today. Castiel takes extra time to outline and acknowledge his mistakes. He gives his reasoning for why he did it, such as his concerns for Dean’s declining health. It also means including his failing in that he was

“Speak of the devil.” Sam mutters quietly and walks over to the table, where he puts his phone down. Castiel watches him, frowning and tilting his head at the same time.
He would love to see how Rowena and Gabriel fight for the phone, but then tries to focus back on her words.
As such, as difficult as it is, he pretends not to notice them. He is still very much aware two of the three adult females rush from the camp and into the field to gather their children. They bring them back to the tents and disappear from sight.

face.”
He staggers and falls as the world goes dark.
Dean knows that’s supposed to give him comfort, but all that does is make him mad. The seasons are constant. To make things so perfect that there are none is… It’s wrong. As wrong as stealing people from their tribes and putting them here in this place. He doesn’t even care that there isn’t much of a cold season in his forest. He just hates the idea that everything is the same here.

Emotions should be kept from the
“Don’t worry,” Castiel whispers to him, “They just look grumpy but they won’t lay a claw on you while I’m here.” At that, the warm feeling in Dean’s chest only grows. Castiel eventually slips his hand off of his shoulder and Dean almost protests but thinks better of it. They swim wordlessly side by side.

“That’s not a very solid plan,” Sam deadpanned, “Last time you tried that you ended up dead.”
The urge to touch and be close we too much. Dean rested his head against Cas once more. He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, feeling Cas’s breath on his face, his heat radiating as Dean rubbed their noses together. “Thank you Cas…”
He swallowed down the bile that had been churned up with the rest of his insides. He felt like he was going to puke. “I — I think I’m fi—” Dean winced, the rough drag of clothes snagging on a sweep of irritated skin.
“Fine, just take Adahy. You’re safer in numbers.”

“So people there are a bit lazy, why would that be our problem?” Dean says and he turns the bacon in the pan, he loves the sound it makes. Sam behind him huffs and Dean is almost a hundred percent sure, he just rolled his eyes at him. Whatever.
“I don’t know if it will be. We need the guns at least as a distraction — they slow her down. Maybe there’s stuff around we can salvage. At least see if there’s any medicine.”

Dean gasped. Sam watched his eyes fly open, sucking air into his stagnant lungs, muscles convulsing as his frozen limbs finally awakened from their deep slumber. He sat up, taking in deep, shaky breaths as the color returned to his face, the cold of death melting away as his blood flowed back through his veins. Sam watched in utter amazement.

disappointed her. Unfortunately, 1-M-7’s health and safety is paramount. If he has the means of learning what is going on, then he is going to do something about it.
. “You mean that you wish to farm? Have you ever farmed before?”
He definitely sounds amused when he repeats Dick’s question. “How did they know, Kid?”
Dean nods.
Cas chuckled quietly, “The feeling is mutual.”
Dean scratches a line into the wall to mark another day. He frowns at it and all the other marks, most of which are hidden by growing moss and hanging vines now. It’s officially his twelfth summer. Twelve summers old, and next summer he would receive his totem. There still hasn’t been any mention of it within the rest of the tribe, but he still doesn’t even know if any of them realize that he’s almost that age.
Mother admonishes him as he drifts in thought around the edge of the building next to theirs. It lengthens the trip to the biology division of the research sector, but it is hard to resist the urge to weave between the towers.
As he shouldered the camouflage pack, Ethan dug in his pockets for the keys to the rusty truck sitting outside. By the time he was at the door, he was still fishing around for them.
The small one looks up at the big one for a moment, and then they both look at Dean. He presses back against the far wall, frowning between the both of them. They’re each holding a flat thing in their hands, and they both look down at their respective flat things, not looking at him as they start tapping at them. Neither one says anything to each other that Dean can tell, and they definitely don’t say a word to him.
Dean saw the worry of the angel’s gaze, felt it bubbling nervously in his stomach. Cas merely wanted to know because he cared. It was always his instinct to help and Dean loved that about him even though it got him in troubles sometimes. But this was safe, for the both of them, there was no need for Dean to hide.
Dean feels a slight throb of nostalgia, and a yearning for his home, when he walks into the camp to see Rowena doing just that. She uses the strip to measure around Ellen’s waist. In that moment, all he sees is his

Dean fidgets a bit with the pouch he wears at his waist, full of safety snacks in case he gets sent to the Alone Room. He’s basically the same age as May, but he still thinks that she acts a lot like a child. The two of them are practically adults now, and next summer would be time for their totem ceremonies. Back in Dean’s home tribe, that would mean they would be adults and expected to fully contribute to the rest of the tribe.
have. Since Castiel is not a liar, he did end up writing a paper on it.
Finally voicing their concerns and questions built up over the years was far less hostile and awkward than Dean was expecting. He guessed after knowing Cas so long and trusting him with every fiber of his being, he was comfortable enough to wear his heart on his sleeve and feel safe. They were never angry when they brought up old wounds, just aware that they should’ve been dealt with a long time ago and that they were fools to have waited so long. It was freeing, tying up loose ends and voicing their forgiveness. There were so many things unsaid between them, some that needed to be spoken and others that didn’t, but either way, it was a relief having the weight lifted from their shoulders. The guilt still lingered, but it would fade with time.
This is quite the opportunity, and Castiel would be a fool to pass on it.
Castiel
The only time that Naomi has been even vaguely disappointed with him is when she learned that his thesis relies slightly on psychology. She considered it odd, but is otherwise always very enthusiastic about everything else that he does. Except for this. Apparently she draws a hard line at speaking with the specimens, and Castiel is sure he can hazard a guess as to why.
Cas is here, and he’s looking right at Dean. He can’t imagine that Cas would be around if they were taking anyone else but

“How many?”
Dean shrugged, “I’m good Cas, I’m really good.” Cas narrowed his eyes, lips pursed as he assessed his next words.
Dirt caked under Dean’s nails as he dragged his fingertips against the ground, loosely balling up his fists in disbelief. “Well, why the fuck not?” He blurted, blanching immediately after. It still hadn’t cemented into his mind not to say the first thing that came to his goddamn brain when he was faced with some kind of friggin medusa-creature!
a little older than you, but it’s been a long time since I saw him.”
Castiel knows that he should never have spoken to Dean. He did it anyway, if only to satisfy no one but himself. Having his access cut off like this will make completing his thesis harder. It will not be impossible, but if he wants access to any further information about Dean, he will need to go through the proper channels. He will need to submit requests for logs and observations from the archives instead. It will slow him down, but at least he will not be completely cut off.
has been to see them, and their tribe is as big as this one, if not bigger.
With the file now open, he transfers it back to his PADD. With a few quick keystrokes on the touchpad, he removes any logging about the file or his messages with Anna. Naomi has full access to his desk and he does not wish for her to find anything regarding Sapien Sympathizers should she ever go looking. She tends to respect his privacy, but in light of his current situation… It is not unlikely that she might restrict him in further ways.
Now that gets a guilty look. He ducks his head and his upper wings start curving over his shoulders. “Omitting is not lying.” And then he has to explain what

“You’re brushing me with your wings.”
The return to the island only spurred a curiosity in Dean that had no hope of fading. He'd be smarter about it this time (if there was such a thing), but something is looming in the background, a whisper of unease that Dean can't quite figure out.
He tasted blood in his mouth, the life of him bubbling in his throat. With a spiteful grimace he snarled at her and spit the bloody saliva in her face. She chuckled and leisurely wiped the red from her face, “Oh I don’t mind. The messier the better.”
doesn’t move. It stays where it is, looking at the flat thing, and Dean growls to himself.
“Dean.” She says and Castiel frowns, when he sees how Dean smiles at her. Of course, he still has feelings for her. Castiel tries to ignore the pain in his chest and glares at Lisa. She would not take Dean away from him again. Castiel had always liked her and Ben of course and he knows how good they were for Dean, but he can’t help but feel jealous.
Turns out that it’s not even necessary. The moment the girl sees Victor and Rufus, both people who are obviously from her tribe, she starts sobbing. She runs straight into Rufus’s arms. He looks surprised by it, even a little uncomfortable with it, but he doesn’t push her away. Rufus is nicer than that, even when he likes to pretend that he’s a crotchety old guy. He picks the girl up and awkwardly pats her back while she wraps her arms around his shoulders and cries heavily into the curve of his neck.

Dean continues to swim valiantly forward, long green-spotted tail curling from side to side. His nocturnal vision has done him well enough so far. He’d seen a few fish pass by in the dark, but he still loathes the emptiness that surrounds him; a great emptiness that would swallow him whole and no one would even hear him scream.
He’s too wrapped up in his thoughts and getting his breathing under control again to hear soft footsteps in the graze. Dean doesn’t realize that someone is sneaking up on him until he’s being yanked to his feet by a hand on his arm. His first instinct is to fight back, but he’s pulled against a hard chest. Whoever grabbed him wraps their arms around his waist, pinning his arms to his sides. They lift him from his feet and Dean
A slight blush reddens Cas’s cheeks. “You’re welcome. I was happy to help. There’s no need for pointless suffering if you can do something about it.”
Normally Cas’s wings will drop, or he’ll look away when Dean insults him like that. This time, it doesn’t even get him a flick of the ear-wings. Cas does blink, but the rest of his face and body doesn’t reflect anything. He’s blank. Empty. No expression. Just like Big and the rest of the other

The muted tap of her fingers against the PADD follow her thoughts, and a message appears on an opaque screen on the wall above the machines.

Dean swallowed, lips twitching. “It’s worked,” he insisted, “It’s always worked . Whenever he’s been under a spell or mind control — whatever! I’ve always been able to get him out of it. Do you not trust me?”
His breathing was heavy but he never slowed. After several minutes, it finally came into view. The space before him flattened out, dipping as the landscape descended away from the cliff, the groves of cacti now burnt to a crisp.
“... ten minutes,” Sam sighed.
Dean grabs a couple more pieces of coral and anemone. They definitely have enough now, so Dean stops gathering, instead just wandering the cave. Dean’s never seen a cavern so large. It’s surprisingly light and Dean soon sees why when he spots the spread of bioluminescent wildlife bathing in the heat of the vents. It’s not often Dean dives deep enough to see such a sight, and this type of ecosystem seems to be closer to the surface than is typical. Too bad Sam isn’t here with him to see it.

But now, after five days of watching 1-M-7 refuse to join a tribe that would mean safety, security, and support, all Castiel can think about is what could be going through his mind. He wants to understand the why, the how, and the

Since Frank isn’t really one for conversation, Dean spends his time sorting while thinking about the strawberries. The fruits he grows are sweet and he finds himself liking them a lot. There’s a lot that they never had back in his tribe, and Dean is going to miss them when he finally manages to escape and get back home. Though he’s probably looking forward the most to having fresh meat that is fish. Dean sometimes can stomach the meat given to them by a

Dean parks Baby a bit away from the motel, so hopefully no drunks will damage her and then walks over to the dark blue house. It looks nice enough and since it’s getting dark outside a few cars are already there.
He nods and looks down at his own PADD, covered in the notes he had been taking during the lesson.
Now that brings a pause to his typing. He glances at her, noting that she is heading for the door. It is likely that she must return to work and deal with the fallout of Castiel’s actions.

The figure took a shaky breath, raising a broken and bloodied finger to jab at a point on the map. He paused, swaying slightly as a cough wracked his frame. It was a wet, heavy sound, causing liquid to drip from his lips and unto the floor.
Dean runs a hand through his hair, frustrated, and pauses mid-sniffle. Even his
“Well ain't that a cute little name,” Dean huffed as he saw beyond to the roads and houses within. He didn't see any people or indication of them, only a glow further up in the fog. The sick feeling grew heavier, a weight setting in their stomachs as silence reigned. It waited for them, seeing what they would do. Dean swallowed, his instincts telling him to turn tail and run. But they were here to figure out the problem, not hide from it. “I guess we just walk right in,” he cracked a smile.
“It is a requirement.” Cas is starting to sound a little frustrating. “You will not be returned to the enclosure until you have received your vaccination.” He pauses, and that frustration passes. “If you resist now, I am afraid that we will need to make you sleep prior to administering the inoculation.”
He shrugs and brushes a few strands of gray hair out of his eyes. “Nobody knows. But if you ever get one of them –” At this, he gestures to the

“I just thought you’d be someone uh… someone older.” The man rolled his eyes and tried to pull himself off of Dean. He found that their legs were tangled and the Magician’s robes had caught on some of Dean’s armor. Dean felt the heat rush to his face as Dean helped push the wizard off him. The Magician straightened up, flattening his robes and attempting to tame his hair. Dean stared way longer than was appropriate but he couldn’t help it.

, but sometimes he feels sick to his stomach and the food goes to waste when it doesn’t sit right.
For the first time in a long time, Dean doesn’t really have any actual plans for himself. Obviously, he’ll work on his garden at some point, but there isn’t much of a rush. With three of them devoted to the garden, it’s well taken care of and he doesn’t need to obsess over it anymore.
The rest of the afternoon was spent resting and staying out of the heat. “It would be unsafe for you to continue in such conditions,” Cas said. “And if you rest and regain your strength, we can make it to Supai before nightfall.

The child looks up at him again, its bottom lip sucked in just a bit. One of its ear-wings twitches, and it checks both directions of the passageway again.

The flat thing in its hands has its attention again, and it’s staring at the stupid thing like it’s
Naomi nods again. She crosses her arms loosely over her chest and leans a hip against the counter.
Rufus turns around and starts walking towards the camp, probably to settle her down by the fire with a blanket and some food to try and help calm her down. That’s what they did for Dean. She’s crying loud enough to hear across the whole field, and Dean’s chest goes tight. He almost wants to cover his ears, because the girl starts crying for her family and wanting to go home. Dean remembers that part too, and it’s a feeling that hasn’t changed.
“Dean, please believe me. You will never be useless, you are anything but. I hope one day you will understand, how much I…” Dean starts and just as he gets lost in Castiel’s words and eyes, the door to the kitchen opens and Sam comes in.
With the blanket still around his shoulders and the bowl in hand, Dean stands up. He looks up at the
“Okay, okay,” Sam muttered as he helped lower Dean to the ground, “Here, lie down.” He grabbed Dean’s discarded jacket and balled it up as a makeshift pillow, placing it under Dean’s head. “Okay,” he repeated.

1-M-7 is on top of him. He barely weighs anything to Castiel, and his punches are weak at best. They do not hurt in the slightest, and Castiel doubts that they will even leave bruises behind. It takes no effort at all for him to catch one thin wrist and then the other, overpowering 1-M-7 easily.
“Benny has a new kid, and Ash broke his foot. I’m fine Sam; I can make a damn halibut run.” Dean grumbled as he stood to zip himself into his heavy, water-resistant jacket. The bulky coveralls made him look like the great pumpkin, but they were warm and kept him from freezing his ass off during the cold nights at sea.

stops and looks back up at him.
Mother is nowhere to be seen, but that could easily be explained by the cover of the trees. Perhaps she is checking into 1-M-7’s secluded camp? Castiel would ask, but he does not want to set off a lecture any earlier than he needs to.
His breath was loud in his ears, catching in his throat. The growls were louder now, more angry. He’d lost count how many of them there were. They were everywhere, leaping from house to house, nothing more than blurs across his vision. How were there so many? He kept going, turning sharply down another alley.
Cas frowned slightly, “I… I felt that reminding you of my inhumanity would be discomforting. You’ve only known me with this face for so long, and the only time you saw me as I am… I hurt you Dean…”
The gunshot rang out as Sam ran through the houses, dirt flying under his feet. A dark shape fell into the gravel somewhere behind him as he sprinted as fast as his legs could carry him, growls sounding too close for comfort. Bracing himself, Sam twisted around and swung his torch as hard as he could. It hit its target with a satisfying thunk, sparks momentarily lighting up the twisted face and yellow fangs. Sam ran faster.

Dean ignores her and continues to bang on the clear wall. “Why are you avoiding me?”
“Was it?”
A growl drew Sam’s attention. A rustle and the cutting of a silhouette through the slots of the wall made his eyes go wide. Shit. His eyes tracked the shadow as it sped silently around to the other side of the building. It stopped, crouching down to sniff at the ground. Sam could see clawed hands and pointed ears in the dim light, and hear it’s rugged breath as it sniffed loudly. Sam easily recognized the creature. Wendigo.
Cas’s voice echoed in the confines of the room. Though not understanding, Dean knew the words were for him and held them close to his heart. Dean continued to sear his love into Cas’s body and kiss it into his skin. He poured as much love as he could until he staggered, feeling himself driven closer and closer to the edge, his vision growing brighter, “Cas I’m —”
Dean chuckled a little more earnestly, “Kind of one of those ‘Chicken or the egg’ questions, right? What was called an orange first, the color or the- You’re supposed to peel it first!” Dean squawked, reaching out to cover his hand over the orange before Castiel could shove it down his throat after the mutton.
“But Cas can’t help us fight.”
“Cas…” Dean licked his lips, his mouth feeling dry, “What's goin’ on here?”
Dean whines quietly, when he gets the pan out of the cupboard and his brother shows up. Nothing good ever comes of it when Sam starts a conversation with that sentence. So Dean rolls his eyes, since Sam can’t see that, and decides to ignore his brother for now.
“No…” Dean shook his head, “No goodbyes. Whatever you have to say Sammy, I already know.”
by the time they land on the platform outside their living unit. He resists the urge to take off again and fly
“He’s not your guardian,” Dean stepped forward, “He’s not yours and he’s not mine. He is his own self. He does what he wants.”
“I’m May.” A quiet voice from behind him has Dean flinching so hard that he nearly falls off the log. He turns around sharply to find the older girl with the braids piled on her head standing at the end of the log, looking at him with interest. “That’s my
“Are you ever gonna talk to me again?” 1-M-7 is pressed up against the quartz glass, his hands, nose, and forehead resting against it. His eyes are fixed on Castiel where he is crouched on the other side of the hall.
“Nothing…” Dean kept quiet, his eyes focused on the dark in front of him, “Nothing you need to know now.”
Dean grits his teeth against the thoughts that always tend to bubble up when he’s trying to escape. He reaches up, arm shaking, and stabs the knife that he stole from Frank’s tent in between the rocks. Frank was sleeping at the time, and he didn’t seem to notice. None of the grown-ups did. The only one who noticed was May.
His boots stomped over the deck, and he dry-heaved over the railing. Nothing came up, thankfully too late in the day now for his early breakfast to make a reappearance.
As such, Castiel should not require another meal until they return to their residence. If it is at all necessary for him to eat prior to that, there are cafeterias at the research lab where he could easily obtain something to satisfy him.
“Jesus, you’re just a regular Mr. Rogers of conversation, aren’t you?” Dean snorted, ignoring the incredulous look of confusion Castiel was aiming his way.
Dean shakes his head, but he does feel a little twinge of regret when Rowena’s face falls slightly. She looks a little sad, but still manages a smile. “Well, little one, if you get lonely or need a tent, you can always crawl in with any of us when you’re ready to retire.”
They already had searched at almost every bar, when Castiel points out the window. There is another bar and it looks as if nothing good could happen in there. The bar is obviously closed, but Castiel doesn’t care about that. Sam parks the car they had stolen and they step out of it.
(Apologies for any errors in my translations! And feel free to correct me :D)
It has been a long time since his lessons about
“It has a big garden, maybe it wouldn’t be too conspicuous if some poppies tried to bloom there.” Rowena says and Sam nods. That could really be it. Before Rowena can say more Sam already packs his bag. He needs to burn those gods now.
Not having full access to Dean’s most current information has been difficult, if only because Castiel was used to having it in the first place. Granted, he already has more than enough information about Dean to do his thesis. There is not much else that he needs aside from casual observations to monitor Dean’s growth during his time here. And that is all information that he can get from public record.
From just her chatting away while he’s been fishing around her, Dean has learned that she was collected in the same season as Dick and Donatello were, but she was taken nearly a moon before they were. Half the reason she’s able to go toe-to-toe with Dick is because she knew him back in their village. She told Dean that there’s no hierarchy in this tribe, and that Donatello is fine with that, but Dick wasn’t. He arrived and immediately wanted to be their leader, and is still feeling stung when they turned him down. No one listens to him when he tries to give orders.
“How are you so beautiful?” Dean whispered.
Dean sighs. Lately it gets harder and harder to keep his feelings to himself. Feelings, alone that word scares him a whole lot, but he can’t really deny it anymore. At least not to himself. He just wouldn’t tell his brother… or worse Castiel about them.
Just like how Dean is going to have to look after everyone in the village one day when he becomes
“Poppy seeds.” Castiel murmurs and Dean rolls his eyes, before walking inside. Poppy seeds. How fascinating, they have other problems right now, but of course Cas and his brother get distracted with things like this.
But Dean had…  only a few moments past, spoken like embers, fighting to burn one last time, raging against the death of time. Even if the words had burned in the fire, had Dean not shown Cas for years how much he cared? But did he understand, Dean thought. Had Cas realized that all he said, all he did was because he wanted him to stay alive, to keep him safe. Maybe not with Dean, as he desperately wanted, but safe somewhere in this cruel, uncaring universe. Cas had to know. Cas had to know that Dean loved him. He could only hope…

Dean takes it back, he totally sees how they can be scary as shit. Once Dean's gotten over the obvious threat display, he sees that most of the cecaelia’s large appearance is due to the splay of tentacles, but the rest of his upper half looks dangerously thin. Dean knows this look—he mustn’t have eaten in a long while.
Now this is something Castiel takes issue with. His lessons are succinct and to the point. They contain only facts uncovered through the extensive studies his people have done on other species, but the forums on which he can discuss his lessons with others of his age group are cluttered with opinions. And none of them are good.
normal enough, but the thought of actually eating it makes him feel queasy, no matter how hungry he is. He turns his face away without a word. Ellen waits a moment before putting the plate down at his feet. She makes no effort to get any closer, and Dean is a little bit grateful for it.

. She takes a moment to say something to Ellen that’s too quiet for Dean to hear from where he’s standing. Her skirt rustles when she walks, and soon she’s standing at Dean’s shoulder and she holds out her hand.
After a minute, Dean turned his gaze to the bedsheets, gathering his thoughts. He could feel Cas’s concern radiate from him like the warmth of his body. He wanted to comfort him but he couldn’t find the right words. Dean blinked back up when he felt a hand on his cheek. Cas’s thumb stroked along his jawline and cheekbone, soothing and soft. It anchored him, his eyes slipping shut so he could hear the thrum of grace like a heartbeat against his skin. They were alive and Dean was so grateful that they were.
“Yes,” Dean confirmed silently.
As if she heard his own private thought, Anna tilts her head.

When they finally turn around, Cas pokes once at the flat thing and holds it out. A strange voice comes out of it, and it isn’t Cas’s voice. It’s hard, and flat, and there’s no inflections or emotion in the voice at all. “
Castiel shakes his head, though he does appreciate knowing that he is wanted elsewhere.
People of the tribe are gathering along bridges and platforms around the clearing, watching because hunters have returned. Dean just can’t wrap his head around how everyone else can just walk around without needing to stay close to the tree trunks, or having to keep a hand on the rope. People keep passing by, cutting around them to take one of the many different paths through the village that lead to the up-down place.
Castiel stands at the edge of the internal bubble at the center of the terrarium; the hub to which the observation tunnels are connected. A

Huffing, he blows the hair out of his eyes, and realizes that it’s gotten pretty long. Maybe he can ask Ellen to cut it for him, or Rowena. She always seems to like playing with May or Jo’s hair. Dean likes it better when it’s short. He doesn’t like how it tickles the back of his neck, or flops into his eyes when it gets too long. Sammy liked it long. Dean does
The man looked up at Ethan, meeting his gaze with wide, puffy eyes. He said nothing but lowered his finger, leaving a blotch of red where he’d tapped the paper. Ethan looked at it, frowning at the remote location the man had indicated.
