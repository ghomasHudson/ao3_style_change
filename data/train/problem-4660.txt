“Yes, Castiel, believe me, you were not the easiest baby, Father could never calm you and the nanny’s use to pray for me when I got home from school, you would not stop screaming unless you were with me, it even got to the point they put your crib in my room.”
“I hope you weren’t look at that hideous jumper Casey,” his brother said pulling a disapproving face.
“Baby, while you were asleep, Uncle Gabriel called.”
“Sorry Daddy.”
“I think you’ve got nearly every puppy thing in the store Sammy.”
Picking up the stuffy, Castiel handed it to his little boy. “It’s a perfect name for her sweetheart. We can’t leave Rosie behind, can we?”
“Work?” Gabriel whispered, not taking his eyes off of Dean. “Work was fine...Oh, I have the paperwork, you are officially Daddy to a Mr. Dean Winchester?”
Dean eyed the high-chair. It did look comfortable, but he didn’t want to sit in it, he wanted to stay with Daddy. Feeling his bum on the soft cushion Dean held onto his bee with one hand and the other on to Castiel’s shirt of dear life, “..nu..”
“We’re here to check something you said to us earlier.” Michael frowned towards the man.
Giving Michael one last glance, Lilith smirked, picking up her phone. Well, if he can’t find it in himself to do it, she was going to have to deal with it herself.
Pulling up onto Castiel’s drive, Sam waited quietly for his Daddy to come around the car to open the door.
Seeing tears forming in the young girl’s eyes Gabriel got up from his chair. “Hey pretty girl, come give Uncle Gabe a cuddle. I’ve missed my special girl’s hugs.” Standing in front Hannah he plucked Charlie from her arms to give the girl a big hug. “Don’t be sad flower, do you remember how tried you were on your first night with mommy?” Seeing the girl nod her head Gabriel continued. “Dean has had a long tiring day and he’ll have to go to bed soon, and look at Uncle Cas! It takes a lot of beauty sleep to look that pretty,” hearing Charlie giggle Gabriel tickled her cheek, making her giggle more.
Standing up from his chair, Castiel picked up the diaper bag before heading down to the back of the store with Dean.
“Da...ddie..orry...I..I..sorry..no cry please.” Wailing into the man’s shoulder, he wrapped his arms tightly around his neck.
Gabriel raised an eyebrow before looking down into the stroller. Dean looked up at him, frowning at both the men with his bee close to his cheek. He looked so mad, but so cute at the same time.
“What’s wrong Dean?” Michael asked, glancing from the baby to his brother.
“I think the toy store first, oh and then the sweet store,” Gabriel said, grinning licking his lower lip.
To be calm when you've found something going on, But take your time, think a lot,
“Gabe, can you hold Dean and start feeding him while I make him a bottle please.” Without giving ether of the boys a choice Castiel placed Dean into Gabriel’s arms.
“Why did you get Dean a dress?” Castiel asked, sounding a bit angry. What was his brother playing at?
Realising what Dean was doing Castiel wrapped his arms around his baby. His boy was trying to make him feel better. He really did have the sweetest boy in the whole world.
Shutting the door behind him Castiel let out a low sigh. Standing on the spot for a moment he looked down at his baby, “I’m so sorry Dean,” he whispered to himself.
“What wrong?” Castiel asked, concerned.
Dean wasn’t happy with his Daddy, not happy at all. Daddy had said they were going get ice-cream and meet up with Gabriel. He was so excited, he hadn’t had ice-cream in years. He was looking forward to trying as many flavours Daddy would let him and if Daddy didn’t he knew he could get Gabriel to get him whatever he wanted.
Rolling his eyes Castiel pulled one of the chairs over to sit on. It was going to take a while to get this stuff in his boy. Tapping the spoon on the bowl’s edge, he tried to think of what to do. For a few minutes he sat having a staring competition with his baby before he came up with an idea.
Sighing, Castiel held the bottle to his baby’s lips. He wasn’t mad at Michael, not anymore, he just really didn’t know what to say to his big brother to make it alright.
“So what took so long in the bathroom?” Gabriel asked as he watched his nephew.
“It’s over baby boy, it’s all over. You were such a good boy, my brave little man, you can have whatever ice-cream you want.”
Dean lifted his head, he wasn’t sure if he did or not, even though he had bad memories of his dad with this car, he also had good ones, like when they had to go on long trips he would play with his little brother Sammy or if they were driving at night Sammy would lean into him while he slept. Every special moment he remembered in this car was with his little brother, god he missed him.
“..Da...Da..Stop..lese..” Sam laughed, feeling tears in his eyes.
“I will, I promise,” Gabriel laughed, pulling up onto Castiel’s driveway.
Dean had always wanted a tattoo, but could never get the money or the courage to do it, and now that he was Castiel’s baby, he knew that was never going to happen if his Daddy had anything to say about it. The ones Castiel had was very beautiful, Dean loved the wings that filled his whole back. He wondered if they had any meaning or if Castiel just got them to have them.
Charlie patted Hannah’s shoulder to indicate that she wanted to be put down, coming round to Castiel’s side, Charlie put her arm around her uncle’s neck.
Castiel sat in one of Gabriel’s office chairs close to his brothers table, flicking at the Newton’s Cradle, making the balls swing.
Turning back to look at his Daddy, Sam felt his stomach drop. His Daddy looked like he was almost going to cry. He didn’t mean to upset his Daddy so badly, he just wanted to play, not make his Daddy cry.
“Hey what’s the matter with my baby boy?” Dean looked up with watery eyes, blinking back his tears as he soon saw a different face looking down at him. The new face was on a smiling man. He looked around the same age as Gabriel, his black hair hug over his bright blue eyes. Dean couldn’t help but stare the man. He was very good looking, even with a goofyish smile.
Both brothers waited a while for Dean to fall asleep. Getting out of the driver’s side Gabriel headed up the church. Castiel climbed into the back seat ready nervously watching out for other people.
“..Da..Dadd..ie..”
“That’s awesome Baba, what do you say to your brother?”
“Sammy, I have something important to tell you,” Gabriel stopped when he sees Sam lift his head from his shoulder. The boy had such beautiful eyes, Gabriel felt butterflies in his stomach has he looked into them, “Sammy, your brother Dean, he’s my nephew. My little brother is his Daddy, Dean is a little just like you.”
“No..ied,” Dean cried, laying his head into his Daddy’s neck. He didn’t want to go to sleep.
Placing the boy on his hip, Michael beamed as Sam looked round with exhilaration.
“Wow Sammy! What have you got there?” Gabriel asked, smiling down at his happy boy.
“Please Unc Mick,” Sam nodded his head, giving Michael puppy eyes. He liked his new Uncle, he had been really nice to him since he woke up. The man had changed him, feed him and showed him his cool laptop.
“Ohh no. Don’t look at me like that baby boy. You hurt Daddy’s feelings.” Unfolding his arms Castiel leaned in close to Dean. “I think Daddy has to teach his little boy a lesson.”
“What happened?” Gabriel asked angrily when he came in closely behind Castiel.
“Okay, Mr Novak. Please remove your shirt and we’ll check your lungs,” Dr Bailey smiled, picking up her stethoscope.
“You don’t have to be embarrassed, baby.”
Hearing Gabriel, Castiel moved his hand away from his boy’s head making Dean let out a small whine.
“We have been told that the documents you have are forged and we have being given orders to take the Little.”
“We’ll be okay Hannah, but thank you, thank you for all you’ve done,” Castiel said, looking at his friend with tired eyes. Today had completely drained him. It had been one of the worsted days of his life and all he wanted to do was curl up with his baby and sleep.
“Slow down Dean, you’ll get a stomach ache if you drink too fast,” Castiel said, pulling the bottle back.
“Does Dean know?”
“I know and I am sorry for not telling you Cas, with what happened I knew Dean needed you and I didn’t want to put more on you, but Cas, there is something else you need to know.”
He was very proud of his work and he knew he was good at it, but because of his dedication he lost having a close relationship with his brothers and that hurt him most. But he would never let anyone see anything upset him.
“Aahh,” Dean mumbled around his bottle as he tries to sit up.
“My sleepy baby.” Cas said, kissing Dean’s forehead. “Dean, Daddy has some very important new to talk to you about.”
I promise this time, I used spell and grammar check, but please tell me if its still bad, I found a website to help me but you cant always trust them xxxx
“I think that’s a great idea, but first I think we should say thank you to Crowley. Can you say thank you baby?”
Dean let out a small squeal as Castiel tickled him all over. “Does that tickle baby boy? How about this?” Dean looked down with watery eyes to see Castiel place his lips on his belly. Suddenly he felt the man blow a loud raspberry into his skin, making it tingle. Feeling tears run down his face, Dean shrieked with laughter. He couldn’t remember the last time he laughed so much but it was amazing.
Dean watched his Daddy. Seeing him start to undo his shirt buttons Dean felt his cheeks turn red when Castiel removed his shirt, exposing his back to him. Dean eyes widened when he noticed the large tattoo of wings filled Castiel’s back. Looking at the design of the wings, Dean could see a lot of detail had been put into every feather. Each one shaded in black and grey with a hint of dark blue, making them look like they were alive.
“We go give it to him?”
“Dean?” Sam mumbled pecking out from his Daddy’s neck.
Chuckling, Michael left his coffee. Moving closer to the boy he noticed him flinch when he went to pick him up.
I've always loved the song I used, my granddad use to sing the original 60's version, but i have to say Disturbed version is beautiful :-)
“Take your finger out of your mouth. What came up that was so important? Dean’s okay, he’s a bit shook up and hasn’t left my side till now. I’ve managed to get him down for a nap, but he’s been asking for you. I needed you.” Castiel sounded really upset with him.
Sitting at the table was Michael, with a happy looking Sam sitting on his lap looking at a laptop on the table.
Hearing nothing, Gabriel started to panic, “Cas...Cas are you still there? Look, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. It all happened so fast and I couldn’t just leave him there in that place, and oh my god that place it was hell. He just looked at me and I fell for him and he’s just the cutest thing and...”
Looking back into his room Dean noticed a blue puppy stuffy sitting on a shelf. “Dada?” he asked, making grabby hand towards the toy.
Gabriel watched his brother’s face. He really did look like he was telling the truth. “You really didn’t send them, did you.”
Chuckling Michael combed his fingers through Castiel’s dark hair. He couldn’t remember a time when Castiel was a child that he wasn’t with him. Sadly their mother died giving birth to Castiel and that devastated Michael at losing the one person that always loved him, his father wasn’t a loving type. He would just dump the baby with the nannies who didn’t care for the child, only for what they got in their paycheck.
“You giggling at us baby?”
As he lay by himself, he just kept thinking of his Daddy, He couldn’t get the image out of his head of his Daddy laying on the floor with blood coming from his forehead and a large man pinning him down. Daddy was hurt, that’s why he couldn’t stop them right? The question kept going through his mind, if Daddy wasn’t hurt he would have done something to stop those mean men from taking him.
“I think you have been forgiven Gabe,” Castiel laughed.
“What you thinking about pretty boy?” Gabriel asked, seeing Sam was stuck in his head.
“Okay, silly boy let’s get you clean.”
Sam watched in amazement as Meg left the room without a word, he had never seen anyone talk to her like that before.
“Castiel’s Little, I know you know about him!”
“He’s more than that, but he means nothing now, we’re going to give Sam and Dean a better life then that bastard ever did.”
“It’s going to be okay Castiel. Gabriel will find him.” Castiel could hear Hannah talking to him as she cleaned the blood from his forehead. She had been with him since Gabriel had left him with her, but he just couldn’t find it in himself to talk to her.
Walking down the baby aisle, Castiel looked up at the toys. He really didn’t know what to pick. He didn’t want to get Dean toys that his boy wouldn’t be interested in. I knew a few other parents that didn’t give their babies a choice, but he didn’t want to be one of those parents. He wanted Dean to enjoy and want to play with his toys. Still looking at the toys nothing stood out to him. He wanted something special for his baby from him.
Dean lay still, letting Daddy moved his limbs into the soft fleecy fabric. Close to sleep Dean let out a wide yawn, making his eyes water.
Gabriel stared at his brother, he couldn’t believe it. He thought they were taken to a high tech hospital, but this was awful, there was rubbish everywhere and the building itself looked like it would fall at any moment. “Michael,” he whispered, he couldn’t say much more than that, he was truly in shock.
Dean let out a loud groan, he was watching that. Why was Daddy moving him? Dean frowned up to his Daddy.
Feeling his legs being pushed up to his belly Dean looked down to see Castiel holding his ankles in the air.
“I won’t do anything Casey. Dean should just be thankful I’m not his Daddy,” Gabriel frowned, looking down at a scared looking Dean.
“Hey there, is your name Samuel?” Gabriel asked knelling down close to the boy.
Castiel turned to see his baby staring up at him, smiling. He quickly popped his night shirt and bottoms on. Climbing onto the bed Castiel sat next to his baby. “Are you hungry baby?” Dean nodded his head, he was looking forward to having takeaway.
“No!” Dean frowned holding his arms out to Gabriel, he wanted to stay up and play. Seeing the man shake his head, he knew Gabriel wasn’t going to pick him up, he dropped his arms in a huff he let out a loud howl.
“Gabe, why do you want to see this boy?” Michael asked.
Walking in Sam gasped at how big and busy the mall was. There were a lot of people walking past them trying to avoid walking into them. Sam looked around in amazement. There was so much to see that he didn’t realise it when they stopped.
Seeing Castiel checking Dean all over after hearing Sam explain, Gabriel’s face softened picking up his crying boy. “Oh Sammy, it’s okay Baba, I’m sure that was scary. Why didn’t you call us?” Using his thumb to wipe away tears Gabriel kissed his baby’s forehead.
Dean just stared at this man holding him, he couldn’t stop looking into the older man’s bright blue eyes. They were sparkling, which Dean surprisingly found comforting. Sucking on the pacifier, Dean didn’t try to move, he didn’t feel like the man was going to hurt him but he didn’t want to risk it by trying to escape.
“Are you sure baby? You’ve been very quiet.”
Dean frowned. Why was this man calling him baby? He’s not a baby, he was nineteen.
“What?” Gabriel said, but before he could protest anymore, Castiel lowered his crying boy into his brother’s arms. Cradling Dean close Gabriel looked up at Castiel, a bit shell shocked.
It had been a few hours since Gabriel had taken Dean. While pacing the room Castiel hears the door open and heared crying coming towards him. Seeing Gabriel walk in with Dean wrapped up in the blue blanket his heart skipped; his baby looked so small in his brothers arms.
“Dean, it’s okay, Daddy’s just wants to change your diaper, then we can go get some breakfast, hmm? How does that sound?”
Sam continued to silently cry, which Gabriel thought was worse than wailing. His baby looked really hurt at not being able to see his brother.
“Cassie, you never ever need to apologise to me.” Placing his free hand onto his little brother’s cheek, Michael waited for Castiel to look at him. “I truly didn’t know what Lilith had done. If I had known she would go behind my back, I would have stopped her. I’m just so sorry you felt you had to hide from me. I’ve been a poor big brother to you. Can you ever forgive me?”
Patting Dean’s diaper, Castiel walked around the room shushing his baby,trying to calm him down. After Dean having his shots and so much ice-cream, he knew there was going to be some kind of meltdown.
“Oh Deany, you don’t need to be sorry. I understand. You want to be big for Sam, but you don’t need to be. He has Gabriel as his new Daddy, also now he’ll have you and me.”
Smiling to himself Gabriel hugged the boy close, he was going to be a Daddy, he couldn’t believe it.    He was buzzing with excitement.
“Well he’s not your boy,” Castiel interrupted “Dean is my baby and I’m not punishing him.”
As Castiel lowered him down Dean let out a high squeal, trying to hold on to his Daddy. He didn’t want to go into the chair again. “Aww Deany, you have to sit in you high-chair baby.”
“What is going on in here?” Gabriel asked, looking shocked. Seeing Castiel on the floor he quickly moved to help his little brother up. “Cas, what happened?”
Not really caring for her excuses Gabriel turned his attention back to the boy, “I want to meet him,” he said, opening the door Gabriel didn’t bother waiting for Meg.
“Deany, I’m sorry I was mean to you earlier. I really am sorry baby boy. When I saw your Daddy was hurt, I forgot myself and took it out on you. I hope you can forgive me.”
Seeing he had the boy’s attention he continued.
“I’m not doing it for you Castiel, I’m buying it for Dean.”
While waiting for the takeaway, Castiel took Dean up for his bath. As the bath filled he removed Deans clothes and wet diaper. Checking Dean’s skin he could see small patches of red starting to form around Dean’s genitals.
“Oh I’m sorry. She looks very soft,” Hannah patted the bee’s head. Looking up at Castiel she pointed her eyes to his hand. Catching on, Castiel pulled Dean’s fingers off of him, and as soon as he was free Hannah moved to be in front of Dean fully. “Does your bumblebee have a name?” she said, keeping the boy distracted.
Sam smiled into Gabriel’s shirt. He couldn’t believe how lucky he felt. He had never been treated like this before, even in the hospital the caretakers didn’t play with him like Gabriel did.
“I lived with my Dad, he made me come here,” Sam mumbled with his eyes on his bear, he felt more comfortable looking at his friend then Gabriel.
“We’re not spanking my baby Gabriel. It was an accident. It was my own fault for not watching where I was going,” Castiel said as Gabriel wiped the blood off his arm.
“He’s Dean’s little brother,” Gabriel watched Michael’s face change to shock, he should have really explained to him why they were here, if he was honest he didn’t know why he was ether, he just had the feeling he needed to do this, for himself or for Dean he wasn’t sure yet.
“Good, I think I know something that you’ll enjoy more,” Dean looked at him, a little confused. “We need to get Uncle Gabe back for his mean joke, don’t we?” Castiel smirked. “No one messes with my baby boy and gets away with it.”
“Where did you learn that?” he asked coming to kneel in front of Michael’s knees.
Dean giggled, he wasn’t going to stop Gabriel as long as he shares with him.
Gabriel let out a groan of frustration. He was tired and in need of strong coffee. He wasn’t sure how long he had been in his office but he could tell it must have been around lunch time when he sees Betty going past his window with her trolley. “What anything from the trolley Gabriel?” the elderly lady asked, stopping at his door.
But seeing Dean happily cuddling his Daddy, Sam was just grateful Dean was safe and loved.
Dean couldn’t believe it, Gabriel had got him a car, his first car, this was without a doubt the best day in his whole life. While his Daddy and Uncle sorted the paperwork, Dean looked on at his new car. He couldn’t wait for Daddy to take him out for a drive.
Dean frowned, that was not what he wanted. He wanted to stay here and watch Kion and Bunga, Daddy was making him miss it. Feeling Castiel lift him up Dean started to wriggle to make him put him down.
Dean nodded his head, looking into Castiel bright blue eyes.
“Shh It’s okay Deany, Daddy’s just cleaning you up baby,” Castiel said while wiping Dean’s soft, smooth skin. Once Castiel finished he pulled the messy diaper way and placed it next to him as he moved a clean one under his baby’s bum.
“No…Dean...he big boy,”
He was just walking home from a night out with Gabriel when he passed the closed church. He heard a loud coughing from the archway. Quietly glancing in he found a shivering young man curled up in a ball in a damp, torn up sleeping bag. Seeing the boy’s face, Castiel felt his heart stop. The boy was beautiful.
Dean nodded his head, opening his mouth for more. “Is it as good as Gabriel’s pancakes?”
Castiel looked down at his forearm to see small splinters of glass poking out of his skin. “It’s okay. I’ll go clean it up in the bathroom. Can you watch Dean please?” Castiel hissed behind his teeth. It really was hurting bad. Looking down at Dean his boy looked like he had gone into shock, it must have scared him.
“.No!!..Dada…ahhhh”
“Can I get a toy please?” Sam asked, looking at him shyly.
Castiel watched as his baby stared up at him. He couldn’t figure out why his baby was so fascinated with him, his boy seemed to just like looking at him. It didn’t bother him though, he loved that he had his baby’s attention. Sticking his tongue out, Castiel pulled silly faces making his baby giggle.
Giving a weak smile, Michael tried to relax as he drove to Castiel’s. He just hoped that his little brother felt the same.
Sighing Dean nodded. If Daddy said it was okay, then he’d stay as he is for now. And if he was being truthful with himself, he didn’t want to stop being Castiel’s baby. Castiel has been the best thing that had ever happened to him.
Michael’s heart stopped when Castiel waked away. He knew his little brother would not forgive him, he had hoped he could have explained, but it was clean Castiel wasn’t in the mood to listen.
Feeling his heart pound, Castiel hesitatingly opened the door. “Can I help you?”
Dean couldn’t help but roll his eyes, he knew he couldn’t touch them. Even if he could, he wouldn’t, they were too special. Dean knew if he owned any of these cars he wouldn’t want people breathing on them, let alone touch them.
All the adults chuckled, Charlie was a sweet kid but she could be very abrupt at saying what she thinks.
Castiel sighed to himself. He could understand Dean being a little nervous, this was all new for his baby. “Do you not want to go in?” he asked, combing his hand through Dean’s soft hair.
“You couldn’t find anything else about Dean?”
“I never wanted this. I never asked you to go this and now because of you my family is hurting,” Michael yelled, slamming his hand down on her desk and making Lilith shake.
hi all, I'd love to thank everyone for the kudos and comment, please tell me what you think, :-)
Walking back into the living room, Gabriel smiled when he saw Dean cuddled up with Michael while drinking his bottle.
Seeing both Daddy and the doctor looking stern, he knew he wasn’t getting much choice. Dean nodded.
“Morning baby, did you have a good sleep?” Castiel said, smiling down at him.
Letting out an annoyed huff Dean shook his head, turning away from him.
“No,” Dean responded, holding his other arm out he tried to sit up so he could get closer to his brother.
“Do you like it baby? it's our house, and hopefully when we go in your room will be all ready for you.” Studying Dean’s face. Castiel could have sworn Dean looked a bit shell shocked. “It’ll be okay baby.” Kissing Dean’s hair, Castiel made his way up to the front door.
“Dean!”
“Deany….Dean, you okay?” Castiel asked, looking concerned. Looking up at the man Dean nodded, trying not to think.
“Thanks Cas. Alright little man let’s get you cleaned up,” Gabriel smiled, heading up the stairs.
“Me too, I’ll hear from you later maybe?” Gabriel said, grinning like a fool.
“I found your name written in your old coat Dean,” Gabriel reassured the boy when he sees Dean open his eyes. Letting out a loud sigh out of his nose Dean continued his bottle, hoping that was all Gabriel had found out about him.
Both Castiel and Gabriel watched their boys with tears in their eyes. Its couldn’t have gone any better.
Dean’s heart stopped when he saw a women standing in front of him and Castiel. She looked around the same age as Castiel but she was slightly taller. She stood her distance from where Dean was, which Dean was happy about he hoped she didn’t fuss over him like the last lot he met. Thinking about the mall, Dean pressed himself closer into his Daddy there was no way he was leaving the man again.
“It’ll be fine baby, Daddy won’t be long, he just need to go find something. You can pick whatever you want, within reason. You’ll have fun with uncle Gabe.  Just don’t let him go to crazy okay baby?” Castiel kissed his boy’s cheek before turning to Gabriel. “You look after him and remember you’re looking for toys for Dean, not you Gabriel.”
“Okay, thanks Gabe,” Castiel said, placing the folders next to him. Looking at it was just pissing him off. What kind of father didn’t make sure his children were taken care of? This John Winchester, by the sound of him, was an asshole. Now that he had a name for the man Castiel knew if he ever meet him, he would punch him in the face.
“Gabriel you can’t do that for me...”
“Guess I don’t have much choice now, the master has spoken.”
“Please, its urgent that we find the Little. He came in today not that long ago,” Gabriel said, trying not to sound despite.
“Sam.” Glaring back Sam saw his Daddy giving him a warning look, but he didn’t care, he wanted to play with Dean. Daddy was just being mean. Sticking his tongue out he turned away smiling at Dean, ignoring Gabriel. “We play De,” he said pulling at the tape on the box.
“Yes..yes of course, I’ll call for Meg to take you to him.”
Shaking his head Sam laughed, holding his pacifier between his teeth. “Mikey funnier.”
Tilting his head up he saw nothing but a pale blue around him. He soon came to realise that he was wrapped up tight in a soft blue blanket. Trying to move, Dean started to panic. The last thing he remembered was that he had fallen asleep in his sleeping bag in the damp corner of the church’s arch way. He didn’t know how he got here, wherever here was, but he knew he had to do something.
“Let me tell Dean when he wakes from his nap. If he is okay with it, we will come over to yours, but Gabriel I’m not promising anything. I’ll text you in a while.”
Feeling his nerves kick in, Dean couldn’t help but suck on the pacifier. He felt scared. He didn’t know who Gabriel was taking to him to, what if he was mean or wanted to hurt him or worse?
“You we’re in daydream land baby, you okay?” Castiel asked, gently bouncing his boy. Nodding his head Dean placed his head on his Daddy’s shoulder. Castiel hugged his baby close grinning at how cute Dean looked. He did look adorable with his small hand covered in soft mittens.
“Da..Da..”
“It’s okay baby,” Castiel said, trying again.
Dean shook his head. He didn’t want Daddy to put him down, if Daddy let’s go he’ll be taken again, he was not letting Daddy go. “No! Dada!”
“No, it wasn’t,” Castiel smirked into Dean’s hair.
Dean felt butterflies in his stomach. He tried to keep distracting himself, watching the world though the car window, but the tingling kept rolling around his insides. This shopping trip would be the perfect chance to escape from his kidnappers. He could scream to get people’s attention try and tell them he was taken against his will. But as he thought about it, it made him feel sick and nervous. If he tried anything and failed Castiel might change the way he treating him, the man could start being mean or decide to punish him by hurting him.
“You are such a beautiful boy,” Castiel said, kissing Dean’s cheek. Dean smiled, his Daddy was always saying that to him, it made him feel warm hearing it because he knew Castiel meant it.
“I’m a big boy,” Sam groaned from Gabriel’s neck.
Castiel couldn’t say how he was feeling. He didn’t think he would be able to put it in to words.
As they walked up the warehouse Dean eyes wondered, looking at the cars going past, he recognised some of the cars from when he lived with his Dad, his Dad had fixed many classic cars while he lived with him, but because his Dad didn’t let him near them, this was the closest he had ever gotten to see the amazing machines.
Taking Dean from Gabriel, Castiel kissed his boy’s cheek. It was clear to Castiel that Dean knew if he used calling him Daddy Castiel would do anything, he was really wrapped around Dean’s finger, but he didn’t care, he loved his baby.
Grinning proudly, Castiel lifted his baby from his brother’s arms, “Thank you Bumblebee, tell mean old Granddaddy to leave your poor Daddy alone.” Kissing Dean’s check, Castiel smirked to Michael as he turned to leave the nursery. Seeing Michael rolling his eyes, Castiel laughed happy to have his family back both old and new.
“Go…” Hannah sighed, rolling her eyes with a small smile.
Flinching at the feel of the wipe, Dean whimpered, “..Sti.ng..”
Thank you all for all your lovely comments and kudos, was upset to see that my story offended someone and I do apologise for that, I never thought my story would do that, but I have added warnings now and again I am sorry I'm rather new to writing on here and I wont let it happen again.
Pouting, Dean looked back at his car. He didn’t want to leave it behind. “..I..car.”
Castiel and Dean smiled to each other as they watched their brothers, they really did look so cute together.
“You’re funny,” Sam smiled, he was loving the banter between his Daddy and Uncle, there was no nastiness between them. He used to be the same with Dean when they were younger, he just hoped they could have that type of relationship again.
“Okay Cas, hand him over,” Gabriel said holding his arms out.
Quickly moving into the room, Castiel picked up tired little boy, “Shh my poor little bumblebee, aww my baby is so tired.”
“I thought we could watch a film tonight,” Gabriel said, placing plates on the table.
Shaking his head Gabriel, soon spots a young dark haired girl walking up to them.
“It’s okay Gabriel, Dean was having a tantrum and he knocked his soup onto the floor. I wasn’t watching where I was going and slipped in it. Ouch!”
Smiling down at the boy’s Castiel watched them for a moment as they cuddle in close to one another. Seeing the boys smiling he knew that this was what the boys really needed. Seeing Michael walk back in with the blanket, Castiel took it and lay it around the boys. Leaning over he kissed both on the forehead. “We’ll just be in the kitchen my angels, call if you need anything okay.”
Dean honestly didn’t know what he was feeling. Castiel had spoken with such honesty and emotion, he knew none of what the man said was a lie. Castiel genuinely wanted him, he thought Dean was special. Dean knew he should hate this man that forced this life upon him but he just couldn’t find it in himself. This life Castiel was offering wasn’t something Dean thought would ever happen to him, but even he would admit it is a better life than the one he was living.
Castiel breathed in heavily, looking at his brother. Gabriel looked like a kicked puppy, with his grey eyes shining. Castiel was closer to Gabriel more than any of his other brothers. He trusted him above anyone else. He really didn’t want to not have Gabriel around Dean, but he would if he had too.
Dean could definitely say he was very comfortable when he woke up, with the softness of the mattress under him and his covers over him he could have stayed in his sandwich of warmth all day. Wiggling into his covers more his felt something cold and heavy between his legs.
Dean giggled. He was starting to like Castiel. It seemed his knew Daddy knew how to have fun.
Without waiting for Dean to say anything, Castiel lifted up his jumper. Pulling down Dean’s jeans Castiel lay them on the chair next to him with his shirt. Unsnapping the bodysuit, he pulled it up over Dean’s head, leaving him in just his diaper.
Smiling wide behind his pacifier, Dean couldn’t help but get excited. He remembered Gabriel saying they were going, he just didn’t realise that they were going to go today. Feeling something on his lap Dean looked down to find a red rubber toy car on top of him. Picking it up Dean hummed at how soft it felt. Hugging it into his chest Dean looked back at his Daddy grinning even wider.
Shaking his head, Dean looked into his Daddy’s eyes. He wasn’t going to let Daddy put him down.
Seeing the man looking between him and Michael, Gabriel watched as the man typed on the computer.
“..ank..ow” Dean mumbled into his bee.
Gabriel huffed with a smile. “Let’s just say that was pay back for biting me yesterday. I got the dress for Hannah’s little girl for her birthday and I thought I’d have a laugh,” picking up a different bag Gabriel pulled out a pale green onesie and a pair of denim overalls. Handing them over to Castiel he pulled out a pair of white socks as well.
Dean stop wiggling. He didn’t like the sound of having something strapped to him and Gabriel sounded like he wasn’t messing around. Seeing Gabriel let go Dean kept the paci in his mouth, but didn’t suck on it.
Castiel watched his baby, he really did look adorable while drinking his bottle, he couldn’t believe how well Dean had taken to being his baby. He was expecting some kinda fight to come from the boy, but he seemed to be content.
Why, think of everything you've got, For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not.”
“Wow. Michael must like you Sammy. He doesn’t tend to do things like that for anyone.” Sitting with Sam on his lap Gabriel looked to his brother with his cheeky grin.
Hearing the noise Castiel quickly turned with his bowl and glass in hand to check Dean, heading over to his boy without noticing the red liquid on the floor Castiel slipped making himself and his bowl and glass fall with him. Letting out a loud cry Castiel felt his arm land in the broken glass, cutting into his skin.
“Yes, I’m afraid so,” Michael nodded, sounding disappointed.
As he walked up, he could hear Castiel laughing behind him. “Smug git,” he mumbled walking into the nursery.
“Now, as for Dean, there are a few things that need to be seen to. Physically Dean is okay, it looks like he’s had previous broken bones but they have healed well. He is underweight but I’m sure you’re feeding him good food and he’ll put some weight on. I will prescribe a specialised formula that will help with that. He has a small diaper rash as you know, and it looks like a has a small abdominal tear. It’s healing, but I will give you cream to help it if it reopens.”
“I’m sure Dean will be excited too.”
Without saying a word, Castiel held out his free arm to his big brother. Moving closer, Michael came up beside his youngest brother, soon as he was close enough he felt Castiel grab his t-shirt pulling him into the hug. Sighing happy Michael relaxed as he hugged his baby brother, he was so happy Castiel was okay with him.
“Okay, you’re right. I won’t say anything,” she said. Nodding to each other Gabriel and Hannah decided to leave it at that.
Dean sat quietly on his Daddy’s lap. Everyone was talking about stuff he really didn’t care about. He remembered hearing Daddy tell the lady Hannah about how he had come to be with Daddy and how Gabriel had made him the way he was, but he really didn’t want to re-live that, so he blocked them out by playing with Daddy’s fingers. Plus, he was feeling kinda hungry, he hoped they were going to eat soon.
“Can I get that for Dean?” Sam asked, pointing towards a toddler race car track.
“It’s okay Deany, we’ll be back with Daddy soon, he’s missing his baby so, so much.”
“Hello gentlemen, my name is Meg. We meet earlier,” the girl smiled, smugly looking Michael up and down.
“Your Daddy has no fashion sense, does he Deano.”
Walking straight to the high-chair Castiel lowered the roaring Dean into the seat, seeing his boy’s red, tear stand face made him start to feel guilty. No no, Dean is just having a tantrum. You have to stay strong Cas, he thought, trying to keep himself from breaking down. Clipping the tray in place he turned to pick up Dean’s lunch. “Look baby, Daddy made you soup! See? Nice, warm tomato soup.” Putting a smile on his face Castiel placed the bowl on Dean’s tray.
Gabriel nodded, knowing not to push his little brother. He needed time. “Cas, Hannah is going to take you and Dean home, I’m going to take Michael.”
“He no like me.”
Moving quickly to his new spot Sam looked up to his Uncle and held up his arms.
“Why did you do this Lilith?” Gabriel asked, pulling Michael back before he did something stupid.
Dean listened to his so-called Uncle. He did sound upset, but Gabriel had been so mad at him, he had left Dean all alone in his crib. Gabriel had every right to be mad, he had hurt Daddy, but Daddy said it was an accident. Dean could feel his head start to hurt, he was so confused.
Gripping onto the sheets he tried to sit up, only to fall back onto his back. Gasping for air he looked around hysterically thinking he was back in the dark horrid room of the hospital. He had been taken from his Daddy, he was never going to see his Daddy ever again.
Smirking to himself Gabriel patted Sam diaper, “You are a big boy Sammy, but some big boys need diapers too, and besides, they just make you look even cuter then you already are.” Tickling behind Sam’s knee, Gabriel laughed when he hears his boy let out a babyish giggle.
“Sammy, we won’t be able to go see Dean...” before he could finish he sees Sam’s smile disappear, big tears start to form making Gabriel’s heart wince.
Opening his mouth Sam sucked on the nipple. He closed his eyes, and cuddled closer to his Daddy.
Picking up a yellow jumper, Castiel turns to his bored looking little boy. “What do you think of this Deany? Do you like this one?”
Taking a breath, he tried to relax, “I adopted a Little last night.”
Gabriel watched as Dean started to drift off. Feeling his own eyes become heavy, he removed the half empty bottle from the baby’s mouth and replaced it with the pacifier. Watching the paci bobbing under Dean’s nose, Gabriel lay his head close to Dean’s, placing his hand lightly onto the boy’s belly before closing his eyes happily falling asleep.
Nodding Sam grinned bring his fingers to his mouth. Sucking on them he soon felt Daddy holding his paci to his lips. Taking it, he glanced to see Dean watching him, causing his cheeks to redden and he spat it back out in embarrassment.
Gabriel felt a lump in his throat, he knew that voice without even having to look up. “If I recall Michael, Dad left the company to all his sons, not just you,” Gabriel said, finally looking up at his older brother. The man in front of him stood tall in a clean cut, grey suit close to his desk. Michael looked very similar to Castiel. His dark hair gelled back perfectly and blue eyes shining, only unlike Cas’s blue eyes being bright and loving, Michael’s were a blue like ice. Amongst the staff Michael wasn’t known to be very nice, most tried to avoid him if they could, which did upset Castiel, especially when the staff mistake him for Michael.
“Hello Bumblebee, are you feeling better, you scared your Daddy and Granddaddy,” Castiel asked rubbing his thumb along his baby’s cheek.
“Yeah right, were you? That would mean putting your baby down, and I knew that wasn’t going to happen, was it?”
Sighing, Castiel realized he wasn’t going to be able to do much without Dean having a mega meltdown. It was clear that the trauma of yesterday had made Dean regress.
Castiel wasn’t sure what he was; more nervous about the fact that he and his older brother had kidnapped Dean, or the fact that he was doing to be a Daddy.
Sam was with Gabriel? Dean felt a calm feeling in his heart hit his chest. His Sam was safe.
Gabriel looked up seeing Michael’s ice blue eyes in the mirror look so glum.
“My...my baby’s gone...he’s gone..” crying into his brother’s chest Castiel broke down.
“Sir...”
Taking Dean from Gabriel, Castiel bounced his boy on his hip. He felt better now he had his boy back in his arms. “Baby this is Crowley, can you say hi?”
“Shh baby Daddy’s here...Daddy’s here.” Hosting his boy out of his brother’s arms, Castiel held Dean close, rocking gently. Looking from his brother to the women Castiel frowned. He could only guess what was going on,but he really didn’t care; the only thing he cared about was Dean. His poor little boy looked so distressed. His eyes were red and puffy from crying so much.
“Are you sure Uncle Mickey?”
Smiling to himself Sam crept back out. Even though he had a very wet diaper he didn’t want to wake the man.
Dean felt his heart stop in his chest, the last car was something he never thought he would ever see again. In a glossy black with shining silver sat a Chevrolet Impala. It looked exactly the same as his Dad’s most treasured car. His Dad loved that car, maybe loved it more then his sons. Dean remember one time he was playing with his brother outside, while his Dad washed his car, Dean slipped in the water hitting his head on the back door of the car. When his Dad saw, he started to yell and scream at Dean for hitting his beloved car. Without a caring if Dean was okay, his Dad grabbed him by the arm, dragging the boy into the house locking him in his room.
“Samuel panicked because you took so long,” he said, sounding how he looked.
“Yeah Daddy, Dean happy?” He asked.
“Babies cry Cassie. He’ll stop…..eventually. I’m just doing to go out of a bit.”
“What if Michael finds out? And Dean...Dean probably won’t do this willingly.” Castiel started to panic a bit.
“Okay, okay we’ll go now. Honestly Gabe, are we shopping for Dean or you? Let’s go pay,” Castiel said, walking up to counter.
“Alright, I’ll just put the baby to bed.” Standing up Castiel cradled Dean in his arms.
--------------------------------------------------------
Cringing at the wet stop forming on his shoulder Gabriel hugged Sam closer.
“I stopped him watching cartoons” Castiel said, not looking at either his brother or Dean.
Before Castiel could answer Gabriel combed his hand through Sam’s long hair, “Not right now Baba, it’s nearly time for dinner and you still need to drink your bottle Uncle Cas made you.”
“No! Hmm. Are you going to try something like that again?” Gabriel raising his eyebrows, looking serious. Dean shook his head again faster. “Okay then baby…. I was going to let you regain the used of your legs but I’m starting to rethink that idea.” Walking past Dean, Gabriel picked up a readymade syringe. flicking it with his finger Gabriel approached Dean quickly to inject it into the boy’s neck.
Gabriel placed his hand on top of Castiel’s to stop him playing with his stuff. “Cas, you slipped the boy money. If he had any sense, which I doubt, he’ll sort himself out.”
Smiling, Dean held his Daddy’s fingers in his own. He was back where he belonged.
Nodding, Dean turned away from Castiel giggling behind his pacifier.
--------------------
Castiel grinned as his baby leaned into him, he hadn’t thought Dean would be ready to do that. Rubbing his hand along his boy’s back he felt the bumps of Dean’s ribs. He couldn’t believe how thin his baby was. Frowning to himself, Castiel kissed Dean’s shoulder before slowly pushing the boy head up to see his face, “Are you hungry baby?”
“Hello there Dean, My name is Meg. I’ll be looking after you,” she said, smiling down at him, “How are you feeling?”
Letting go of Castiel’s shirt, Dean bought his hand up to his Daddy’s stubbly chin.
“Oh shut up,” Gabe said feeling his face warm up. “I’m Sammy’s Daddy now. I’ll do anything to make my baby happy.  You didn’t see him Cas, he’s so lovely and sweet and the fact that his father tried to sell him, just makes me want to find the bustard and make him pay for what he has done to them, boys.”
“It’s so nice to meet you Sammy, Dean is super excited that you’re here,” Castiel said as he rubbed his hand along Sam’s back.
Taking his hand away from his face Gabriel beamed. His boy thinks he’s the best! He hadn’t been a Daddy a whole 24 hours yet and he was already the best.
“Let’s get you changed, the it’s nap time,” Gabriel said. He might be mad at the boy but he wouldn’t leave him in a wet diaper as a punishment, plus Castiel would probably kill him if he did. Dean stayed silent letting Gabriel quickly change him, he didn’t want to make the man any more angry than he already was. Letting out small hiccups Dean tried to stop himself crying but he couldn’t seem to stop. He wanted Daddy to come in and cuddle with him, tell Daddy he was sorry.
Michael looked at Gabriel in shock. “Gabriel, come into my office please,” he said holding his hands up in surrender, “Please...”
“How old are you Sammy?”
Castiel looked at Gabriel noting a few holes in his shirt. “You must have scared him.”
“Hannah this is Dean..he’s a bit shy,” Castiel tried to lift Dean’s head from his shoulder, but Dean was having none of it. Hearing his baby whine into his neck he gave up. “Deany it’s okay. This it Hannah. She works with Daddy and Uncle Gabe. She’s nice, she even has a little girl like you.”
Closing the car door, Castiel turned to find Gabriel pushing the stroller to him. “All okay Casey?” he asked,  nodding his head towards Dean.
“..ank..ou.” Dean said shyly, looking up at Crowley from his Daddy’s neck.
“He will be when he’s back with Cas,” Gabriel whispered, combing his long fingers through the baby’s hair.
Seeing Gabriel pout Sam tried to stop himself from laughing. His Daddy really was a big kid.
“What are you having Cassie?” Gabriel asked.
“Hmm, I think we’ll have scrambled egg and toast. How does that sound?” Castiel asked, looking to his boy.
“Oh well, guess we’ll have to get you new things, won’t we Uncle Mikey?” Gabriel said winking up at his brother.
“Hey, just thought you would like to give Dean a bit extra since he didn’t eat a lot earlier,” Gabriel whispered, walking up to the rocking chair.
Nodding in agreement, Sam cuddled into Gabriel. The man was right. It was rather late into the night and he was feeling hungry and sleepy.
Castiel chuckled “I know baby, Daddy wants to stay and cuddle too, but someone else needs the room. When we get home we can cuddle on the sofa, but before we go Daddy’s got a surprise for you.” Picking up his bag, Castiel pulled out his gift and held it up.
“Yes Dad,” Gabriel smirked, sticking his tongue out.
Sighing, Dean watched as Sam’s face fell. He didn’t want Sam upset with him, but he wasn’t going to let him get away with being a little monster.
Dean looked over his Daddy’s shoulder to see Michael with tears in his eyes. He didn’t understand why wasn’t Daddy listening.
Dean stopped sucking on his bottle. How did Gabriel know his last name?
When the boys nodded lazily Castiel smiled, once he knew they were all comfortable, he turned on the TV putting on a Disney movie.
Rolling his eyes, Castiel shook his head. He had lost count at how many times his brother had said that to him the whole car journey. “I don’t need a car Gabe. I get everywhere fine walking or getting a lift with you,” Castiel grinned, showing his teeth. Gabriel gave him a quick glare before turning back to the road.
“Not a baby,” Sam said, looking serious, “I a big boy.”
Hearing the others laugh Gabriel bit his lip trying not to laugh himself.  “You cheeky monkey, what are you implying?” Sitting in his chair, Gabriel started to tickle the curly haired girl more. “And its Gabriel not Gabrielle, you silly bean.”
Seeing Hannah walk in, Castiel smiled hugging Charlie tightly. “You’re the sweetest girl in the world Charlie, but your Mama is right. Goodnight Sweetheart.” Handing Charlie over Castiel gave her kiss on the check.
Dean lifted his head off his Daddy’s shoulder, looking at his Uncle in shock.
Taking the man’s hand, Michael hid his displeasure at having to be touched by him. He wasn’t a fan at being touched by people he didn’t know.
“That does sound like something he would do. Have you finished the reports on the new AB’s we have acquired this week Gabriel?” Michael asked.
Giving a weak smile Castiel tried to make himself relax. He knew Gabriel was the best at sorting these things, but he just couldn’t help but still be worried.
“Aww Sammy, of course you can,” Gabriel grinned wider, he couldn’t believe how shy his little boy was. “Baby, you can have whatever you want.”
Feeling Daddy tug on his jumper Dean whimpered, he didn’t want his clothes off in front of the lady doctor.
“He’s not your baby yet Castiel. He’s a boy we’ve kidnapped,” Gabriel said seriously “And I don’t want you to come because some of the stuff I have to do might upset you. I don’t want that for you. Just wait in the living room and when I’m done you’ll have a your baby boy,” he added still with his arms out, he knew his brother too well. If he saw what he had to do to the boy he wouldn’t like it. He didn’t like thinking about himself, but he wanted his little brother to be happy.
“So where is Dean?” Gabriel asked climbing into his car.
Sitting in his office chair facing the full wall window, he couldn’t get the image of how happy his brothers looked, especially Castiel, out of his mind. He couldn’t remember the last time he saw his little brother smile so happily.
Seeing Hannah smiling down at him Dean felt himself go stiff when they came closer.
thank you ambersagen for editing for me your awesome :-) x
“Shall we go find your uncle? He’ll make my baby boy feel better.” Laying Dean down in his stroller, Castiel handed him his bee before wrapping his blue blanket around him. Letting out a displeased moan Dean snuggled into his blanket while Castiel said goodbye to the doctor. He was just glad it was over and he wouldn’t have to come back in a very long time.
Dean pouted towards his brother, he was happy his Sammy wasn’t crying anymore, but seeing big sad hazily eyes looking at him made him feel so guilty for telling his little brother off. He hadn’t seen Sam in forever and he’s been mean to him already.
“Maybe, if you’re a good girl. Anyway you’re having a party, do you want to invite Dean to come?”
“Of course, if I’m your angel and Dean’s is your little angel that makes you his Granddaddy, doesn’t it Deanie, can you say, Granddaddy,” Castiel laughed at the horror on his brother’s face.
Jumping at the sting Dean started to cry again. He really didn’t want to be here, he just wanted to get out. Dean would have wanted to go home, but he had no home to go to. His dad had kicked him out when he just turned sixteen, leaving with his little brother to a different state. Leaving Dean to look after himself, which didn’t end well what with him living on the streets.
Dean hummed, nodding his head at the idea. A bath did sound amazing.
When Castiel went silent again Gabriel knew his little brother was debating what to do. He just hoped it was good news.
Grinning, Gabriel shook his head, “Afraid not big bro, anyway you’re always in suits. Today we are going to be comfortable,” he said, handing Michael the clothes.
Nodding again Sam look up at him unsure.
“N...no..my Dada,” Dean mumbled from behind his fingers,  holding his free hand out to Castiel, he wanted to go back to his Daddy now, he needed Daddy.
Sighing to himself, Castiel turned his attention down to his baby. Dean lay quietly with his face pressed against his chest. With his eyes closed, the boy looked so peaceful, he almost looked like he was going to sleep.
“No...” Dean cried out in frustration, giving his Daddy an angry glare.
Soon he spots Gabriel coming towards him caring Dean in his arms. Quickly opening the door Castiel held out his arms to take the boy.
“Because Cas, I’ve always known you wanted to be a Daddy. You’re always looking after everyone, especially me, but Michael has made it a rule that only couples can adopt.”
“Cas?”
“Thank you Cassy, this really does mean so much to Sammy.”
Feeling Dean’s head sink into his lips, Castiel smiled as he pulled away to look into his baby’s eyes.
Lifting Dean’s legs up, he pulled the back down to snap it up over his diaper.
Frowning into Sam’s soft hair Gabriel lightly bounced his boy around the room, “Aww Buddy, I was only gone a minute. Shh its okay, Daddy wasn’t leaving you.”
It felt strange think of Castiel that way. It was strange but it felt good. Pouting, he looked up to his Daddy with puppy eyes.
Castiel could feel his eyes tear up at the sight of his baby. Dean’s whole body was shaking in his arms, his baby was having a terrible panic attack.
Turning his attention back to the boys, Castiel rubbed his hand across Dean’s belly making Dean glance up at him. “Baby, can you let go of Sammy’s hair for a moment? Daddy needs to stand up for a second.”
“We are your bosses,” Michael smirked as he opened the door to let Gabriel and Sam out, “And believe me, you haven’t seen the last of us I assure you.”
Dean couldn’t help but hum as the water made his muscles relax into the warmth.
“Cas! That’s a type of stalking I think,” his brother laughed making him blush more. Seeing Castiel’s face Gabriel placed his hand on the man’s shoulder. “Cas, do you think you might like this guy?” Castiel frown up at him, “I mean like like him.”
“Dean, you don’t need to stop being my baby, Sam won’t care that you’re a little.”
“Wow, Dean calm it’s okay.” Castiel said, trying to hold Dean tightly.
“Yes baby, Home, do you need to get your things?”
After taking a minute to realise what had happened Gabriel started to laugh as well, “Well, they do say revenge is sweet,” he said wiping the stickiness off his face.
Gabriel pushed Castiel up the stairs with his hand on the man’s back. Dean could see his Daddy’s arm covered in blood, he had really hurt himself. His eyes clouded over with tears and Dean looked away, feeling ashamed.
Pacing around Gabriel’s living room, he was starting to doubt that what they were doing was right. He remembered the first time he saw Dean.
“Why don’t Sammy.” Gabriel asked looking confused.
“Okay sweetheart, you can help Daddy,” Patting Dean’s diaper bum Castiel hears Dean sigh happily. Standing at the sink Castiel turned on the radio sitting on the window ledge. Hearing the music start Castiel walked over to the fridge, “Let’s see what we can have, hmm?” Opening the door they look inside to find one of the shelves full of the AB meals. Turning his nose up Dean hoped Daddy wasn’t going to try and feed him that again.
“He’s okay, just got a little scared because I left the room,” Gabriel said, standing up with Sam in his arms.
Dean could feel his heart ache. He couldn’t believe what he had done. He just hoped Daddy would forgive him. Or would he get rid of him? He didn’t want to go back on the streets. Looking up at the stars shining above him Dean quietly sniffled as tears continued down the sides of his face, he really hoped Daddy was okay.
“Don’t be silly. Now sit and feed him the awesome omelette you made before it gets too cold.”
Yawning, Dean blinked up at his Daddy. He still felt sleepy. He wanted to go back to sleep. Closing his eyes Dean snuggled into Castiel’s shirt, happy at being held by his Daddy.
“Who wants to know?” Castiel frowned. He wasn’t liking this.
Seeing his Daddy’s face, Dean felt his heart sink. He didn’t mean to hurt Daddy’s feelings, but he needed to be big for Sam.
Giggling, Dean watched as his Daddy licked his hand clean. Daddy looked a lot happier now.
“Are you okay Sammy?” Gabriel asked as he taped a new diaper on. His little boy hadn’t spoke to him since they came up the stairs. Laying on the changing table Sam was looking around the room not paying any attention to the man standing over him. A part of Gabriel kept thinking he must have done something to annoy his baby, but for the life of him he couldn’t think of what it could be.
“Did I hear my name?”
“I know, but it’s not your fault,” Castiel said as he stroked Dean’s face. “I know you would have done something if you had known, but you were going through a hard time yourself.”
“Where are you going?” Castiel asked, looking panicked.
Picking the soft blue dog up, Dean turned back to his little brother with a big smile on his face. “Sammy...”
Both brothers looked to each other in shock. Why would Sam think such a thing?
Shit! Gabriel thought. He needed to come up with something to tell him fast. “I can come with you Michael, but Cas has taken his month’s holiday from work. I’m sure Hannah is more than capable of filling in.”
Seeing the happiness in Charlie’s face Dean nodded his head, making her smile wider.
When Castiel got home he couldn’t stop thinking of the young man’s face. He looked too young to be sleeping rough and Castiel he just wished he could do something to help him. The whole week since Castiel had walked pasted the church to check on the boy he was always there in the mornings, looking rough and exhausted. Some nights he wasn’t there, but one night Castiel heard someone yelling at the young man get out of a car. “Next time don’t scream so much Dean,” said the older man at the wheel. Seeing the way the boy limped away with cash in his hand, Castiel knew this poor child, Dean, was doing things he shouldn’t be to survive.
“Not to let myself in until someone opens the door,” the girl pouted. “Sorry mama. I was excited to see Uncle Cas,” the young girl looked up at Hannah with puppy dog eyes.
“Has my baby enjoyed today?”
“This is my son, Dean,” Castiel said, rubbing his hand along his baby’s back. Feeling his Daddy’s touch Dean turned to face him. Letting out a small whimper Dean stretched his arms out to his Daddy. He wanted Daddy now, it was starting to feel like forever since he cuddled his Daddy, he knew he was safe there.
“Let’s go get a cart Deano. I think we’re going to need one,” Gabriel said, bouncing Dean. Once they managed to find a cart Gabriel walked with Dean still in his arms. There was a seat in the cart but Gabriel didn’t really like the look of it. Dean looked on with his head on Gabriel’s shoulder. He kept looking up at the walls of toys passing them. Stopping at the Lego area Gabriel grabbed a giant bag of toddler building blocks and placed them in the cart. “Can’t go wrong with blocks, can we buddy? Do you see anything you like here Deano?” Gabriel asked, looking down at the boy. Dean turned his head to look behind him. He figured he should probably pick something just to keep him happy.
Castiel didn’t know what to say to this, he had never liked the way Michael did things sometimes, but this was too much. Just thinking about it made him feel sick. What if Michael had got to Dean before he did? his baby would have gone through the same thing and he would be with a family that wanted a mindless thing.
“Let’s get you out of that wet diaper hmm,” Gabriel said, patting his hand on the white plastic and making it crinkle loader.
Raising an eyebrow at his brother Castiel didn’t bother responding.
Gabriel didn’t try and hide the anger on his face, it was probably because of her why Dean was so quiet and withdrawn.
“Nope, I made everything look legal before Michael’s change in the rules of adoption,” Gabriel smiled.
“Tongue back in your mouth Mr Novak, that’s where it is meet to be,” Dr Bailey said, tapping Castiel’s tongue with a small wooden stick. “Your Daddy is very silly Dean, isn’t he?”
Seeing Hannah laughing behind her hand, Castiel glared at her. He couldn’t see what was so funny. Standing up, Hannah moved next to him. Making him move over, she knelt down in front of Dean. “Hey sweetpea, I like your bee...” she waited for the boy to look at her to continue, “He looks very soft.”
Clamming off of Castiel lap Sam wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck. He had the best big brother in the whole world.
Walking into the living room they find Gabriel had moved all the cushions and blankets onto the floor, making it all cosy around the coffee table.
Castiel smirked. If Dean knew the power he had with those eyes of his he would probably get away with everything.
“Oh! Ice cream?” Dr Bailey smiled towards Dean. “You didn’t say you were going to get ice-cream, Dean.”
Coming out of his thoughts, Gabriel could have sworn that Sam looked shell shocked. Looking up to Michael he sees he had the same look too. “That’s only if you would like to...I know it’s silly...you don’t know me..” Before he could say anything else, Gabriel feels a tight grip around his neck.
“Sorry, are you mad with me?”
“I have….. clearly they have pulled a few strings and have tried to hid this from me,” Michael couldn’t believe this had happened. Why would they do this and not tell him? His brothers must have known he would find out eventually.
Dean nodded his head quickly. He had always loved cars. His dad was a mechanic, so he had grown up around them. His dad wouldn’t let Dean near the cars he worked on, which did upset the boy because he would have loved to learned to fix the beautiful machines, but his dad had kicked him out before he could go to school to learn how to. He even didn’t get the chance to learn to drive, and he didn’t have money to pay to learn. Hearing Gabriel ask him to help get Castiel a car, it kinda made him feel important.
Gabriel tilted his head looking confused, “Do you not like pink?” he really thought his boy might have wanted this, especially since Sam kept staring at it.
Jumping out of his bed, he opened the door to see a large grumpy looking man in the hallway caring a heavy looking box.
“Don’t panic. He’ll be here, we just have to wait,” Gabriel said, turning off his car.
Looking to Dr Bailey, she nodded to him that she was done. Picking up his naked baby, he held Dean to his chest and moving back to the chairs he cradled Dean close to his skin loving the contact between them.
“Of course, you don’t need to ask Gabe. I’m sure Dean’s diapers will fit Sam, so just use what’s up there,” Castiel said as he picked up the warm bottles. “I’ll leave Sam’s bottle on the table for when you come back.”
As he walked up the stair Castiel turned to see Michael following close behind. “What are you doing Michael?”
Quickly grabbing it before it hit the ground, Gabriel held it up to his boys lips. Turning his face away Sam shook his head. He didn’t want it if Dean thought it was weird.
“Yes...lease,” Nodding frantically, he didn’t just want to see Sam, he needed to.
Coming out of his thoughts, Gabriel rolled his eyes at the same question his older brother kept asking. “For the last time, Yes. It’s fine, you’re a part of this family, so you’re coming,” he said sternly. This was making him feel really odd, having to be serious with his normally up tight big brother. “Plus, Sam wants you to come, right Sammy?”
“That’s it, forget the scabby horse. I’m going to eat baby Dean instead.” Rolling Dean onto his back again Castiel tickled his baby’s sides before blowing loud raspberry into Dean’s belly.
Letting out a groan Dean nodded tried to move Daddy’s hand forward. Sighing, Castiel let Dean have it back but noticed he did slow down a small bit. Sitting in silence for a while, Castiel hugged Dean close into his body. For the first time since Dean was taken, he finally felt himself relax. He couldn’t believe the day they had had. Now that he had a chance to think, he realised he really needed to talk to his brothers, especially Michael. He hadn’t really given his oldest brother a chance to explain, but he was going to have to wait. His priority was Dean. He needed to make sure his baby and himself was okay before anything else.
Seeing the disgust on Gabriel’s face both Dean and Castiel burst into laughter.
Gabriel pulled Castiel’s arm closer to him “Castiel, you’ve got glass in your arm and you’re bleeding.”
Opening his mouth Dean hummed. Daddy made good eggs. “Does my Deany like his breakfast?”
“It’s okay baby, Daddy’s got you. Just two more then we can go get ice-cream!”
“All’s forgiven Baba.” Kissing Sam’s forehead, Gabriel moved his baby to lay in his arms. Seeing his little boy’s sad, puffy eyes looking up at him, he smiled softly, hating seeing his baby upset. Picking up the bottle, he held it to Sam’s pouting lips. “Here baby, this will make you feel better.”
“You didn’t have any trouble?” Castiel asked, looking concerned.
“We’re here to find a car for Cas and Deany. Now that my little bro is a Daddy he cannot depend on me to give him lifts everywhere,” Gabriel explained.
Gabriel got up from his chair and pulled out a file from his cabinet. “Do you remember the government’s A.B program?”
Dean frowned. His Daddy was looking at him very seriously, he wasn’t sure he was going to like this news.
“Alrighty then, let’s go see what they have,” Gabriel said, opening his door. Climbing out he opened the door on his side to help Dean out. “Are you ready kiddo?” Gabriel asked as he tried to undo the straps of the car seat.
“Dean, I know me making you my baby was something you didn’t have a choice in, but I knew the night I first saw you that I felt something for you, and every day since I just wanted to look after you,” he stopped again when Dean let out a small sigh. Bringing his hand up, Castiel started to rub his finger along the boy’s cheek. “Dean, you are so beautiful and special to me and I know you must hate me right now but I hope that soon you will see that all I want to do is show you the love you deserve, baby.” Feeling a tear in his eye Castiel quickly wiped it away with his thumb.
Doing up the last button Castiel smiled down at his tired boy. “Lets get comfy and cuddle on the rocker baby.” Picking Dean up, Castiel handed Dean his  bee before moving over to sit in the rocking sofa by the window., Looking out, Castiel and Dean could see the stars shining brightly above them. Pushing his foot on the floor Castiel started to rock his baby slowly. Enjoying the peace Castiel gazed at Dean, he could feel his heart skip, he loved his baby so much he just hoped Dean could see that. Dean looked so small in his arms he didn’t want to move from this moment and just stay like this forever.
"No-"
Sam turned on his heel, dragging Dean along with him. The mans blue eyes pierced Deans green ones as they walked away. He was strangely drawn to them.
Cas turned angrily on his heels, stomping away. Sam tried to stop him, but Dean grabbed his shoulder.
He shoved his can towards Castiel, who accepted it without second thought.
"Im so hungry."
Castiel set his can down, still feeling hungry. Dean tried to ignore him, but he just couldn't. There was something about him that made him feel sorry. Like caring for a puppy.
+    :    +    :    +    :    +    :    +    :    +    :    +
Sam said, and Castiel felt his already short life flash before his eyes.
"Sam? Sam, wait!"
Castiel asked in a small voice.
"Uh, thanks, Sammy."
"Dean!"
"...I'm Castiel."
"Close enough to become like this."
Cas said, grabbing his hand. Dean quickly withdrew it, looking at him like he was crazy.
idk what im doing but i hope yall enjoy (if anyone reads this)
"Um...nothing, nevermind."
"Uh, huh, sure."
"Thank you..."
Dean sighed, but decided to amuse the chap.
"Dude, what the hell has gotten into you huh? And you've had plenty of rest, so don't bullshit me, okay? Tell me what's going on."
"Your wing should be fine in a few weeks. Or...I think so anyway."
+:+:+:+:+:+:+
Sam sighed, watching Dean walk away. He didn't go after him. After all, there wasn't anywhere to go. Castiel sat awkwardly, running his thumbs on the ridges of the can.
"Sorry about that, Cas. It's not like we have to know your background or anything. Curiosity, you know?"
"It looks broken, does it hurt?"
They continued on their path, planning to set up camp when they found a suitable spot. The rendezvous point for survivors was another thousand miles or so away. Dean was glad he and his brother were together when it all happened, and thanks to their hunting background they knew just what they needed and how to stay on the low.
Dean snickered before bursting out laughing. Cas frowned.
"I'm serious."
Sam said, joining Deans side. Dean clenched his jaw, going over to the crumbled person.
"Sammy, I think someone needs to update their match.com profile."
Sam said, trying to hit the spark at the right angle to light the wood. Dean scoffed in agreement, pulling out two cans that Castiel couldn't make out from his angle. 'Probably just beans' Castiel thought, and that thought made his stomach growl. He sat up to leave, but lost his balance and tumbled down the hill.
"I...do. Um..."
"Calm down,"
Castiel couldn't help the smile on his face. Warm food in his bely, two bickering fools. Almost like home, but he was dirtier.
Dean swung his bag on, following Sam to the figure, who surprisingly didn't  move when they approached. As they got closer the persons figure was more prominent. They were slightly pale and had dark brown hair. They wore a tan-ish trench coat over back dress pants, a white (or previously white) dress shirt, and a blue tie.
Sam asked, going over to the two. Castiel flinched away from them, but they again assured him he was fine. After a bit of bickering and convincing, Castiel finally jouned the two near the fire. As Sam checked his wing, Castiel cowed on much needed food. Sam chuckled
"Who's  that?"
Dean butted in and Sam smacked his head, as to which Dean flipped off.
"Dude the blast was like...2 years ago, stop exaggerating."
Castiel quickly got up, brushing himself of and giving them a nod before trying to scurry off, but Dean grabbed his collar. Castiel flew forward, trench coat now gone.
"He decided to leave, I didn't do anything."
"Dean..."
"Were you lying to me just now?"
Dean nodded, still laughing.
"Yes."
"Yes, thank you. Um Dean-"
"Hell if I know."
Getting up on shaky legs he followed slowly behind them.
"Cmon Dean-"
"He's harmless. Plus, he probably wont even make it to the bunkers."
"Uh, Sammy?"
"Does it matter?"
"Dean!"
"No."
Sam called, already quite ahead of his older brother. Dean ignored his comment, picking his bag back up. Mid-way he saw a figure ahead of him, hiding in the trees.
Dean quickly whipped around, holding the back of his neck. Sam look over at him, concerned.
"R-Really? Like a circus clown?"
"What?"
Dean followed reluctantly, but the two stopped suddenly, watching Cas fly up into the air and in the direction they just came from.
"Hey,"
"Do I really look that bad...?"
"Well, like I said, I want to get closer."
"How does everything fit? Good?"
"U-Um...I don't know why you don't like me...but it would be nice if we got closer, don't you think?"
"Jeez, Dean, leave him alone. Can't you see he doesn't want to talk?"
"Well my past wasn't pretty, and doesn't matter, does it?"
"I was a clown."
Sam said, apologizing to Cas.
"Dean,"
"You'll protect him. Just like you protect me. And like you protected Bobby, and mom, and Charl-"
"Have mine."
Dean helped him back up.
"Uh, right. Well, Dean, you heard the man."
"Um, well...we have. But it didn't end well. Dean blames himself but there was nothing he could do."
Dean sighed, stopping and turning to Cas.
"Do you remember anything?"
Although the blast was small, fallout was spreading quicker than anyone thought, and more and more Familiars showed up. But they weren't the ones that accompanied witches or anything, it was just one of the many slangs for the people with abilities from said blast. The only downside other than the occasional pair of wings or cats tail was that they didn't live very long.
"Dude. You've been paranoid since we saw that guy. Scared he might come and shank you or something?"
"Shut up, Sammy. I just...feel like someones watching me...or something. It's whatever! I just need some sleep."
"Suit yourself, I'm going after him."
"Hello,"
"Isn't that an angels name?"
Sam gripped Dean's wrist, pulling him back. He hadn't noticed that he almost just walked off a cliff.
Cas stayed silent. He was probably talking about Charlie. Cas knew Charlie, but just barely. As a Familiar they had just naturally gotten closer, but it didn't last long when the bounty hunters started rising. Whenever he thought about her he couldn't help but feel like that wasn't really her name though. He liked Charlie as a name better anyway.
"You provoked him, and now he's gone."
"What."
"Sam- Sam! Ugh..."
"We don't, but we can't just let him wander like that."
"Cmon, it's not like we need him."
"Let's find out."
"That doesn't sound like a healthy lifestyle."
"Wait is that-"
He grunted out.
The day seemed to pass quickly despite all the climbing of fallen trees and walking. Sam mentioned they would be traveling on the highway soon, and that suggested the end of their long trip. It would only be a day (maybe 2 with Cas) before the brothers parted ways with Cas. Dean couldn't help but have a sinking pit in his stomach thinking about it though. What would happen to the winged mut? Just turn him away? Run experiments on him?
"Trench coat."
Sam glared at Dean before sighing and taking a seat across from the two.
Dean kept his frozen stance, the two just staring at each other. Sam appeared at Deans side, quirking an eyebrow.
"Dean..."
"You stop right there. Don't bring them into this."
He nudged him.
Dean hesitated, but clenched his jaw and stayed silent instead. Sam scoffed, shaking his head.
"Move your ass! You want cancer in 10 years?"
"At least let him enjoy the food. He looks like he hasnt eaten since the blast."
Cas's smile left his face.
"Come on!"
"I sure can."
"Look what you did."
"I'm Sam, that's my brother, Dean, by the way."
Dean muttered, glancing back at Cas, who was...looking at bees. Sam rolled his eyes, tired of hearing the same sentence a million times for the last 3 days.
