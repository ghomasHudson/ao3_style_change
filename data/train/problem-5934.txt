“Sam,” Natasha stated.
Steve looked out into the yard. “Bucky and I are going to head to Wakanda after Thanksgiving. We’re going to have dinner at Rebecca’s house, and head out to the quinjet afterward, stay in Wakanda for a week. I’m not sure exactly what Shuri said, but between the Colonizer and stupid holiday, I think she said that if we were going to choose such a horrible family holiday we should come to see them. So we are.”
“I want a cat,” Bucky muttered, “a black cat, and we're going to name him T’Challa.”
Sam rolled his eyes and lead Natasha back to Loki’s room. Together they managed to get him ready for bed before he passed out completely.
To Tony’s surprise, the little puzzles helped and he didn’t feel the need to talk a mile a minute as strongly as he usually did.
Loki gave him an exasperated look. Really Loki had the best bitch face Sam had ever seen, including Tony’s. This was a relatively new thing for Loki to do and Sam derived more pleasure than he ought to from it.
But the fact that Sam was living in the same apartment said something about progress.
“God yes,” Scott agreed.
The women sucked in her lip. “About a year I think.”
He posted the picture. “I got Instagram now as well.”
He hung up. “So you’re good with kids,” Tony noted.
Natasha was laughing as she hung up. Sam chuckled rolling his eyes. The room was more or less just as set up as the last room was so Sam called it close enough and went back downstairs using the fire pole because sue him, he had wanted to be a firefighter when he was little.
He looked over at Peter who just about squealed. Sam stuck out his hand. “Nice to meet you Peter,” he greeted.
It was a small metal, Falcon. “Really,” Sam complained but pocketed the little metal bird before Bucky could demand it back.
Sam laughed and brushed his hands through Loki’s hair. “When you are with me, always,” he promised.
“That isn’t reassuring,” Sam answered stopping next to him.
Loki nodded and they watched a lazy episode together. When it finished Sam’s Mom burst into the room. “Get up,” she exclaimed, “we have things to do. Hi, Lo.”
“Loki!”
Sam woke up to the smell of fried eggs and ham. He rolled off the couch and crept towards the kitchen. Natasha and Loki sat at the counter with Natasha silently doing Loki’s hair as music swelled into the air and they both had a look of peace on their faces. Sam knew that they knew he was there, but he leaned against the wall anyways and gave thanks that this was his life. It was horrible some days and the trauma came at levels the army hadn’t. But he had a ex Russian spy who snuck into his house in the morning to make breakfast and a small teenage demigod who made his house feel full, and that was good enough for him.
Gideon handed a file over to Sam. “You deserve to have those records,” he informed him.
Because it was Natasha. Because she had been destroyed in horrible ways, way too young. And the need to know everything was tied to how safe she felt. “I know. That’s why I have to.”
“Go where,” Loki asked.
Despite his apologetic tone he was smiling and the keys kept flying through the air, even as he kissed the other super Soldier. “Anyways I walked them home and then I made my way back.”
“I was running away from imprisonment and changed into a mare. They released their best stallion to catch me. I gave birth to Sleipnir. When Odin took me back to Asgard he took Sleipnir and used him as his horse until Sleipnir was slain in battle.”
Natasha choked on her drink and leaned against the counter. “You’re saying that your a teenager,” she demanded.
“Bless that child,” Gideon tutted, “well enough of this. Come help us cook Sam.”
Thor and his friends talked and argued. Loki ignored them. He ignored them and Thor’s lies. He wished Thor would start out easy on him. He wished he had been more like Odin and started beating him first for being a dishonest, untrustworthy, selfish, entitled, brat who needs to earn his place. Loki did not miss the fact that in order to make up for all those things he did he had to do those kinds of things. But that didn’t make him believe it any less because either way, Odin had been right. But if Thor had beaten him first, then Loki could have kept pretending that Thor loved him, that Thor wanted him around. Instead, Thor was sending him away for all the reasons their father had. It was cruel.
“I never sent those,” Steve yelped paling.
The reporter asked Sam and Rhodey questions about the process and the new accords before asking Wanda about some of the specific clauses about training and age of Avenging and things like that. Which she answered easily. Tony had had a mini session about how to handle the press with her. “So it’s pretty common knowledge that you are attending a public college,” the interviewer stated, “what do you plan to do with your degree?”
She squeezed his arm and walked away. Steve smiled, he loved the kind of people who treated him just like a regular person just to reveal they knew who he was. Yeah, Tasha was right in saying his disguises sucked, but they allowed him a bit of privacy while still being approachable.
Peter watched Clint and Rhodey run around one of the small kitchen making popcorn and hot chocolate and such. Wanda had just finished her very first club meeting and apparently, both men were very excited over that. Even though they wouldn’t say it to each other. It was not the relationship Peter had been expecting.
It wasn’t like they had known that Hydra was Nazi’s or what they did. They just told them that they could help them kill the people that killed their parents and bombed their home, throwing their lives into chaos.
Sam turned towards the golf carts. Loki paused at a window looking at his reflection. “You ok,” Sam asked.
“Why have you not started an apprenticeship,” Loki asked Wanda as her breath evened out and her eyes cleared.
In the quinjet Bucky and Steve were ignoring safety and laying on the floor of the plane. Really, Bucky had decided he was going to lay the fuck down and Steve was going to lay with him if he wanted to or not.
“Steve has very strong ideals and he hid them earlier. Wait until Pride comes around.”
“Kid you practically live with us for half the week and May asked us to join her for your parent-teacher conferences,” Tony noted.
Everyone was waiting in the building including Peter who stared wide-eyed at them. The party started in full swing and Tony brought his son over. “Petey the Icesicles, Iscesiclse Peter Parker. Keep it Pg.”
“Trust me, Pete, she is going to love you. Now go make sure you have everything in a bag you want on you when we move, who knows what could get lost and who I’m going to get fired.”
That was exhausting. Wanda looked over at the tv and saw the news, which had the headline Creepy Professor Assaults Scarlet Witch: Tony Stark Demands Repercussions “If he Does this to my niece who will he not do it too?”
“Yes if you would,” Steve answered.
“Are you here to tell us the world needs saving or some bullshit like that,” Tony demanded.
Loki looked at him but said nothing. Every bone in Sam’s body told him something was very wrong with the man in front of him. Who seemed to curl further into himself the longer he was there.
It had been a Sunday evening and he was walking around Queens, disguised in his hat and sunglasses. If Natasha saw him she would throw a fit, but it wasn’t like he was on a mission at the moment. He’d spent the evening at Sam’s apartment helping him move in.
Tony almost asked where Steve was but they weren’t there yet. Tony put his hands into his pockets. “Sure,” he stated, “waiting is good.”
Tony shook his hand. “Welcome home,” Tony answered.
“Aren’t you hundreds of years old,” Bruce asked.
Clint burst out laughing. T’Challa’s eyes sharpened on him. “I don’t think you have room to laugh.”
Ten minute later MJ glanced up again setting a sleeping Peter off her lap and standing up. “Time to go,” she announced.
He watched every muscle in the captain's body relax, a very forced effort. Without a word he took it and started to read.
“Thank you,” Wanda choked out.
That wasn’t really descriptive. Loki followed Bucky and Sam over to one of the larger kitchen. All the Avengers and friends were there. Peter waved from where he was sitting. Rhodey pulled Sam into a conversation and Bucky wandered back over to Steve. Sam handed Loki an empty plate and nodded towards the laid out set of food. Loki bit the inside of his lip and looked at the others plates. They were stacked high with meats and vegetables and grains, but mostly meat. Stake. The Midgardians called it stake and some of it was dripping with blood.
Steve beamed. “Don’t worry Tony you are very cute when you blush.”
“You should leave now,” Tony announced.
Strange raised an eyebrow. “Do you really think I’ve come to collect him after I  read and watching all this? Besides the spell keeps him harmless. He’s more of a danger to himself than anyone on this planet.”
“Brooklyn,” he responded.
No, Ned nearly whined but bit his tongue. Mj shrugged. No one said anything again. “Oh hey. It’s the other scary chick I know,” Clint explained walking in an hour later.
“When you want to have sex with someone you give your consent to them. When one party isn’t giving consent or isn’t able to give consent that’s called rape, and that messes up a person. And from what I understand you didn’t give consent and you weren’t able to give it. You didn’t want it.”
The interviewer smiled like he didn’t quite believe him. “So we heard a very interesting conversation early before we started,” he hedged.
“And God forgives all sins,” Gideon agreed.
Bucky snorted as Peter took off running. Everyone had gotten into the habit of calling Steve Peter’s father and it was so ingrained that no one could stop. Really though Peter didn’t seem to notice it that much, especially if it wasn’t Tony taking. Or maybe he did notice and just decided to ignore it. Who knew?
Thor’s head swung over and he jumped out of his seat. “STEVE! My friend!”
Loki shook but let her guide him until she was cradling him. After a few minutes of soft words and touches, Natasha announced, “I’m going to call Sam over, ok.”
He slumped down next to Loki without any grace. Loki finds it both disgusting and endearing and that’s troubling. “Peter, ask him how he I settling in, but not in that way,” Wanda demanded.
Sam flinched. Great he had not figured out how to have this conversation yet. Well his mom did appreciate blunt honesty. “I’m not coming home for Thanksgiving,” he admitted.
“But I’m supposed to be your favorite superhero,” Tony whined, “where is your Iron Man blanket.”
“You’d care if one of us could kill you,” she pointed out, “you would have fought Strange if you could have.”
After all fifteen of the Peter Parker R5 videos Pepper and Rhodey became the main focus on the screen again. “Sam do you know any part of the training regiment Steve was planning for Peter,” Pepper asked, “I’m sure we could work something out on our own, but it wouldn’t be anywhere as good or productive as Steve’s.”
“I’m sorry I killed them,” Bucky answered.
Sam nodded. “Yeah. Rylie is the dorky ass white guy in the picture.”
The days faded into weeks. Loki and Peter got closer and closer with Wanda tagging along at their side whenever she was able, and Shuri when she came to visit. As a result, Tony and Clint gave up their leftover animosity to the demigod. Which made Laura happy since Loki was very good with her kids and was always happy to babysit, not like any of the other Avengers weren’t happy to do so as well. Tony built a dance studio in the rec center claiming it was for Natasha, but everyone knew it was for Loki. Tony would sometimes sneak in and watch the boy dance. He was still perplexed at how the boy was the same demigod as the one who destroyed part of New York, but that didn’t matter anymore.
Steve shrugged. “He’s alive,” Steve answered, “I’m responsible for him. He’s still my best fella. I’ll search forever for him if I have to, but if he was killed,” Steve choked, “or brought back to Hydra I couldn’t live. Tony, I put that plane in the water to join him.”
“Not really,” Rhodey answered, “Wanda gets in tomorrow and then we are moving.”
Sam hadn’t thought about taking Loki out of the neighborhood. Loki was so recognizable, but now he looked like Sam’s biological kid. Sam could take Loki where ever. He could get Loki some damn therapy. He’d been probing around the Recovery community, like he had when they got Bucky, but he hadn’t said anything concrete about it. Sam made a note to call T’Challa and see if he would help. Sam didn’t like to ask much of the King, but Wakanda did not care much about what happened in the outside world. They had not cared about Bucky so maybe they wouldn’t care about Loki.
Sam laughed. “You’re ahead of our times.”
Sam had said they had been best friends. Sam didn’t answer for a moment. “Rylie and I meet in basics. We were at a based in Texas and for some ungodly reason, I was the only black guy there so I wasn’t making any friends fast. Nothing against those guys, love them all, but in some cases, I was the only black guy they’d ever seen outside of the media. It was a weird situation in general.
Loki froze and Sam sat up. “Is everything ok,” he pressed.
“Shuri is very enthusiastic,” Nikita sighed.
Steve’s mouth opened and shut quickly. “No, we didn’t we just went out to get Thai food with him.”
Sam laughed. “Thank you for the cactus,” Loki said to Wanda.
“Because you are both annoying,” Sam answered with a playful smile.
Sam groaned. “She’s great, the best really, but hell no.”
No Mom he didn’t really destroy New York I promise. Except Loki didn’t walk through the door. Not really. Sam knew it was Loki because of the green eyes, the same height, weight, and stature. The posture was the same, but Loki’s skin was the same color as his and his facial features reminded Sam of one of his nephews. “Sam how in hell do you have a kid,” Sarah demanded.
“Where,” Peter questioned.
Behind the camera, Tony laughed and Peter stuck his hand up and pointed at the girl. “I can’t believe my own son is trying to disown me” Tony teased.
Loki glanced up at them. “House Temptress please reveal the events of Sokovia,” Loki requested.
“Do either of you have personal boundaries,” Tony inquired as Steve leaned into the touch.
“Everything has changed from when you were born,” Rhodey exclaimed, “it’s changed from when I was born.”
Bruce did his nervous shuffling. “Deviant but not Evil sounds right,” he agreed.
Rylie’s Ma, bless her, was surprised as hell when a black man followed her boy’s casket home. Still, she took me in kept me going until I could stand by myself again. Then she shoved me out into the world. She’s the only person stateside that knows about it all. The army made the marriage certificates disappear and all the paperwork. And I don’t talk about it. Not even to all my friends. I suppose Natasha would know if she went poking around my room, but they respect my space.
"I keep forgetting where we are too," Tony pulled a wry face. "I thought I'd be up early enough to get this done before anyone woke up. Well, it's been a good enough run, I guess."
seven players on each team, ergo, Wenlock
"All by hand." Tony clapped Steve on the shoulder with a spare hand in illustration, companionably squeezing his shoulder for a second before letting go. "But I'll take it as a compliment that you think my decorating can masquerade as professional."
Steve wants to fire himself from his own brain. Is that possible?
Constantly having to swallow back so many sentence fragments must be exhausting. It was going to take him a lot of time to process all the scheming and comments Tony Stark had made to cover up his secret identity. Steve was getting resigned to the notion that he was probably going to want to slap himself for how obvious a lot of Tony’s subterfuge had been. All the things Iron Man has said! “Oh,
a beautiful way to say that everything that happened was due to one thing:
"You could stay," Tony whispered, into the nape of Steve's neck. He was sweaty, starting to feel unpleasantly sticky with it. He was lying in the damp spot.
"Still nothing?" Carol's voice floated in from the doorway.
Steve stared dubiously at the small strip of material carefully pinched between his fingers. He couldn’t hold himself up anymore and had to let himself drop back to the ground, sliding him back down the pole an agonizingly painful four inches. He knew he hadn’t hidden his wince of pain from Tony, but Tony was politely not mentioning it.
″ Steve stared at Tony. ″That
When Tony appears in the kitchen this time, Steve promptly forgets how to function like a regular human being and ends up spitting coffee all over himself. Steve sags, looking at the mess. Sometimes he's so glamorous.
Iron Man makes a gesture and the material instantly hardens again; he raps on his head and a clanging noise rings out. "And now it's polarized," he says.
"Haha," Tony says weakly, "yeah."
The closet was dark and small, but not too dark that Tony couldn't see the amused expression Steve angled at him. "I think I can manage," Steve said. The amusement was in his tone, too. Super strength, of course. Sometimes Steve was so solid and real it was difficult to remember how spectacularly
“How is she a witch,” Loki asked Natasha.
Sam’s eyes widened in surprise. Tony and Peter both made cutting off motions at him. “Well no,” Wanda corrected “Dad went to the cellar to find potatoes and then they got into an argument.”
Sometimes Bucky’s bad days lasted a few days sometimes it could be hours. It amazed Steve how quickly they could switch. “How come I don’t like sex,” Bucky asked.
“Well I haven’t decided yet,” Sam answered.
“Technically, but he puts Red Bull and monster energy drink in it and that’s poison enough,” Rhodey answered.
They sat in silence. “Is it safe to bring Peter home?” Tony asked, “I haven’t told him why we are staying at the tower right now and he’s getting antsy.”
“Am I safe,” Like questioned.
Peter jerked back as he read the first few lines.
They had all agreed that if Peter knew about Loki he would want to see the demigod. And Tony wasn’t very good at lying to his kid and Pepper didn’t even think about trying. So they just didn’t tell him.
“Nice to meet you too Buddy,” Alex answered.
“Alright,” Clint exclaimed, “what the hell is going on!”
“Sorry,” Wanda told her, “I just-”
Nikita took T’Challa’s hand and he kissed her's. Bucky smiled at her. “Selfie,” he asked waving his phone.
Steve looked away and towards the window shuffling his feet “she uh, well cancer got her two months ago,” he answered.
Wanda laughed. “You’re such a good Dad,” she teased before getting into the car.
“Hey,” she answered kissing his cheek, “I made mimosas this morning. Come drink one before Clint gets his hands on them.”
He almost dropped the tray of cookies when she walked in his eyes going wide. The only thing that saved the treats was Rhodey’s watchful eye to catch them as Peter abandoned them and stumbled over.
Sam squeezed Loki tighter. Tony looked torn. “Sam,” he said, “we have to ask.”
Loki sucked in a deep shaking breath. “And most don’t let them in public very often. But he doesn’t look like he is easily dominated, so that was confusing.”
Steve looked down at his feet for a second but brought his head up putting on one of those I’m trying to be brave smiles “well that’s what fresh starts are for,” he replied.
Sam snatched his phone back and tapped on the picture shoving it back in their faces. “Oh,” Dax stated, “so it’s an actual eggplant.”
Steve chuckled softly but sobered quickly. “I'm sorry that someone used my image to hurt you,” he told the man, “but we just wanted to reiterate for you that what they said has nothing to do with our views and that we support you. Now we’re going to let you go and Daniel is going to come home and take care of you.”
“Right,” Clint agreed but he didn’t offer anything else.
“Kids,” Steve answered without hesitation, “they’re starting to let guys like Bucky and I legally adopt. Not easily, but that’s progress right?”
“I do,” Bucky answered.
Tony went and sat down. “Alright, so this might sound complicated. Pepper and I are non-monogamous. We’re engaged but we can also date people outside of our relationship with each other. She’s been dating Rhodey for five years now. It’s pretty usual for me to only be in a relationship with Pepper, but Steve and I were dancing around a relationship when he accords happened.”
Sam choked on his breath before he continued. “Bruce removed the bullets. Strange cracked your skull. When he dropped you. So he fixed that up as well, that's probably why it took you so long to wake up.”
“I can teach you Instagram.” Tony offered Steve.
Loki crept in. “The first hundred years after I lost Angrboda I kept her favorite earrings on me at all times,” he whispered sitting beside him, “it was as if I let them go I would be letting her go. I imagine my face looked like how yours does now when I decided to tell Thor. Who have you decided to tell?”
“What did you think,” Sam asked.
The three of them talked and tried to include Loki, but he didn’t say much. Nothing more than he had to. Why did the sorcerer leave him alive?
Sam remembered the long afternoons in Wakanda of Natasha and Steve playing with Bucky’s hair. The pride he had felt when Bucky had first asked him to do the same. The fact that he had Bucky’s trust was breathtaking.
She set the drawing on the couch next to Tony who calmly picked it up to study it. “While I don’t appreciate how big my head is here, I approve of the theatrics and coloring, so nine points.”
“Through the mind stone’s control they were able to tie the last remains of the binding spell on me. They controlled the mind stone and their will was placed on the staff. As long as I had it they would be able to control me.
He stepped in front of his wife and children. “Loki crawl to the foot of my throne,” Odin demanded walking in.
“Who’s Mom,” Tony asked.
“Well between Rylie’s death and when I got discharged they eradicated the records,” Sam explained.
“What time did you get in,” Tony asked flipping a pancake.
“Not helpful Steve,” Sam complained.
“He agreed,” Natasha repeated giving him a patient look, “he still thinks you’ll hurt him, but I don’t think he doesn’t think that about anyone. His brain is a mess. He likes you through, thinks you are kind. He wants to trust you which I suppose is why he’s agreed.”
“Did they hurt you?”
“Well that’s different,” Peter answered, “you’re Tony Stark, he’s Captain America!”
Sam felt his throat tighten. “I wouldn’t blame you if you did,” he answered.
Sam was beside him in an instant and Loki reached for him. Loki’s breath came in ragged pants and Sam helped him breathe through it. “Are you done,” Sam asked.
“Not at my eye,” Sam shouted.
Steve smiled at Tony and Tony smiled back. They spent the rest of the night watching YouTube videos of Spiderman thinking about how to help the young hero.
“So do you hate him then,” Peter pressed.
Sam took in a deep breath. “Technically when I was in the Air Force I did something that wasn’t entirely legal nationwide.”
“Look who’s here,” Sam said and nudged Loki.
Clint hummed his agreement, “but it’s kind of driving everyone nuts trying to figure out who you mean when you ask for your dad, so you’re gonna have to call one of us something different.”
Sam felt Natasha’s body relax and he breathed easier. “Good,” Sam breathed.
Tony rolled his eyes. “I wouldn’t ask you if you couldn’t.”
“Tired,” Clint yawned, “if Cap is going to schedule an interview this early he should have the decency to be here.”
Sam: I didn’t give you my address.
The three men in the kitchen turned. “Sam! You’re late!”
T’Challa laughed. “I would believe that would refer to my mother.”
“Shut up and hug me back,” Steve ordered.
The movie credits started to roll and the Captain looked over at him and Tony leaned forward pressing this lips together. He heard Steve gasp and he started to pull back.
Darcy whined and Jane laughed packing away Sam’s fine China that Tony had rescued from his house in DC. Which was great because that had been his grandmother’s and she would kill him from the grave if the government confiscated it.
“Very bisexual,” Shuri agreed.
“Let me brush your hair,” Natasha order Loki her face soft.
Steve was stunned for a second when he saw Spiderman at the airport in the suit he had made for him with Tony. That almost hurt more than anything Tony had down so far, but he could yell at Tony later. He had to stop Zemo and he had to make sure Bucky was safe. Get that programming out of his head. Then he could fix things with Tony, or just fight for fucking custody of the kid.
He threw his arm out towards Loki who flinched. Loki flinched way too much. “I killed my colleagues because he mind controlled me,” Clint added.
When Steve and Bucky went to their house that night Bucky took a picture of the house and posted that as well.
Loki looked at the blanket in his lap with confusion and then over to Bucky with admiration. He pulled the blanket up to his chin. Rhodey flipped on the movie. Loki was enamored by the movie. Sam felt proud by his choice of “Because Of Winn Dixie”. Loki laughed and cried at all the right parts which helped the rest of the team relax.
Loki watched as Bucky looked him over. “You’re a diplomate right?”
“Pepper please,” she requested with the same kind smile, “honestly I feel like I already know you to go with formal. Steve, when he lived with us, talked about you so much.”
So the next three or four chapters will feature Loki and Sam, I didn't expect this part to get this large, but it got a little away from me. Hope you enjoy.
Like they didn’t know that she was telling the truth but that wasn’t what the question was aimed at. And she knew that damn well. “How did you get in here,” Vision questioned popping up from behind Sam.
Steve bit his lip. “I do,” he stated, “I just worry.”
He did not wait long until the music switched off and the bathroom door clicked open, but he did not dare move a muscle. “Loki,” Thor asked.
Fury grunted and stood up. Sam wondered what kind of power Mj had to make Fury listen to her. They said goodbye and left. Sam and Loki followed soon after. “Are you ok,” Sam asked as they arrived home.
“Want,” Loki repeated, what was there to want?
“Just ignore Tony, everyone does,” Bucky encouraged.
Tony looked at him with stars in his eyes and the biggest smile he had ever seen. “We can make that happen.”
She sat on the bed and patted the spot between her legs. “Well come talk.”
Tony hesitated. “Please,” Wanda almost begged, “I want to go home!”
“I see,” he mused fighting down panic.
“Never say that again” Tony ordered.
“Must I?”
“But Captain America did sign the accords,” the reporter kept on.
“I was tired of his misery,” she answered and went into the ranch house.
She always had, but Solviva falling hadn’t helped. “Good news is that it’s over,” Tony answered, “welcome home.”
The tender moment dissolved and Bucky ruffles his hair “punk,” he answered and shoved Steve out the door closing it on his ass.
“Why goats,” Loki questioned.
There was a gasp from the studio. “And Steve he looks us dead in the eye and goes This One, and I swear everything made ducking sense then.”
“What,” Peter asked as Sam tucked the plate into the dishwasher.
Loki took in a deep breath feeling more relaxed suddenly. “Natasha said that there is midgardian dancing theater called musicals,” he stated.
Loki raised an eyebrow. “Oh,” he said softly looking away.
“I’d like to see Africa,” Bucky hummed, “Shuri keeps sending me lists of places in Africa to go and Nakia keeps telling me not to fuck up her missions in response.”
“And it’s pretty damn clear that Loki has some problems of his own. Get your heads out of your asses.”
Tony Stark had a nasty habit of destroying things he feared. Not that he meant to, but coping was a very strange thing.
Lo: 12-14, I’m still winning for now
“Nope,” Tony agreed popping the p.
Loki searched his magic to see if he could do anything with it. Anything. The cookies were in the air but he couldn’t direct them, he couldn’t create illusions. Damn Thor!
Two kids ran out of the bar holding hands looking high on love. Bucky and Sam stopped their bickering. “Want me to call a cab,” Bucky asked them.
Loki went flying again and the sound of gunshots went off. Loki twisted in the air and flipped as best as he could, he knew that the wizard had opened his teleporters and sent them flying at Loki’s they shot into his back as he landed. Loki felt himself lose balance so he rolled with the impact getting to his feet again. “You think a few bullets are going to kill me,” he spat.
“Not tonight,” Bucky teased.
When he woke up and the shower was running. Loki looked towards the closed door in the room. Then he looked over at the room. It was mostly neat and organized, but overall pleasant. Loki rolled over and saw a picture on the nightstand.
She joined Rhodey by the counters and dipped her finger into a bowl of cookie doe. “This is good,” she noted giving Peter one of her friendlier smiles.
Peter ran off and Rhodey meet Tony’ eyes. “How are you doing?”
Five days later Rhodey stood on his own power for the first time in a year. Everyone cried. Shuri stayed for another week. Spending the day with Bucky when Peter was at home or school until the other teen arrived. Her visit seemed to add some light into Bucky though. Tony, Sam, and Wanda all loved spending time with her through. No one could pass up a chance to spend time with the girl, and they quickly found out that if she wasn't entertained she would entertain herself. Which often involved getting into a prank war with Clint. T’Challa collected her with much fan fair. It was hard not to adore Shuri.
Sam felt sick and Loki dissolved into maddening screams of grief. It wasn’t the kind of thing you could fake. Sam gently combed his fingers through Loki’s hair until he cried himself to sleep.
Wanda looked around that the other people in the room. Tony had found tours specifically for transfer students so these people were close to her age. Still, they all stared at them, just like they had at every other college.
to go into the family business one day, and Sarah Stark was the perfect kind of alliteration for that.
"Ah, the old empirical method," Tony said, pulling the fake Santa beard back out of his pocket and fastening it back on his face, silently vowing to call up the company that was arranging the secret vacation package he'd planned to surprise Pepper and Happy with for Christmas and adding an extra round of spa treatments to it. Happy deserved it for not calling him out for changing the subject.
in the world. I'd—I'd kind of like to—"
kissing Tony.
in his company. Does Tony ever rest?
It's for the best. Tony's handsome and kind and he'll find someone better for him soon; Steve's sure of it.
to say Steve's name like it was special, and Steve hadn't known there were so many ways to hear his name where he would
you. I would—" His chest tightened, a heavy band of agony, "I’d regret never getting the chance to kiss you."
"You… unionized the villains," Steve said, flatly.
"I'll make sure to put coal in their stockings," Tony said, just to make Happy laugh. "Right after I sock it to 'em, of course."
"Oh, please," Tony waved a gauntleted hand. "Like I don't mask and filter all the conversations we have in public areas anyway." He shot Steve a glance when Steve looked relieved at that. "So you just might as well spit it out."
″I'm okay,″ Tony breathed, his voice crackling. He was gasping for air at an increased rate, terribly betraying his own words.
“Did you mean it?” Steve shifted his chair with his ankles, scooting closer to Tony, and he looked him directly in the eye. “When you said my attention wasn’t unwanted.”
"Still want to go straight to the Mansion, boss?"
Tony didn't kiss Steve goodbye when he left, because he figured it would be too difficult to leave if he did it again, and Tony had no other option left but to leave.
far from his body, so he kept his hand in front of his face and concentrated hard on staying on the steps; it was only when he got to the shower floor that Tony realized that he was technically about to perve on Steve in the showers.
assume that? She wouldn't be
"Wow, if I wear a mask my identity will really be hidden," McCoy grunts, but he's beaming down at the invitation anyway.
This was the last time he might ever see Steve again, if Steve had his way. Tony's eyes stung more than he wanted to admit. His vision swam a little. He made it safely onto Steve's doorstep before he turned around, inhaling sharply, readying himself to say a goodbye he wasn't ready to make.
Steve's shoulders tensed. "It's just—that reporter—she—When she propositioned you—"
"And so you preemptively decided it was better to break my heart and run away to the middle of nowhere so that I could keep being Iron Man and

"Oh," Tony says, smiling when Steve sits next to him. "Yeah. Just tired. That was a long battle."
covering his own tracks, it was obvious. One large ATM withdrawal, and then some footage of Steve accessing a lockbox at the Empire Municipal bank, and then Steve's route was meticulous; Tony managed to track him partially across the city via CCTV, but Steve turned down an alley, and although he looked, Tony couldn't find where he re-emerged.
"Yeah, okay."
"I'm glad you're up and about," Steve said. His voice was stiff, polite, and then he paused. "You've already talked to Carol?"
″ He slipped into the chair next to Tony, putting his mug down, smiling softly when Tony unconsciously mirrored the gesture. They were so used to working in unison on the field that even these small domestic moments echoed that easy physical familiarity with each other. ″You're the bravest person I've ever met.″
Tony tossed the bundle of mistletoe and glanced around the room consideringly. "I think I'm gonna put some up by the main door, just to be a brat. Come hold the ladder for me?"
It's the mask. The whole disguise. Steve feels brave. This must be why Iron Man enjoys staying in his identity-concealing armor, because like this, Steve almost feels invincible too.
It wasn't fair for Steve to think of Tony so possessively, not when Steve was the one to wreck their burgeoning…
″Strip of unstable molecules. Mr. Fantastic helped develop it. Just give it a shake.″

Steve to keep kissing him. Or to not stop kissing him, because Tony's surge of bravery had unlocked the thing simmering between them; it had knocked the whole dam down and they were both drowning in each other.

what you mean for once in your life."
Tony turned, looked up at Steve, and just—lost it. The impulse was too strong. Tony was unable to help himself; he leaned over Sarah, carefully cupped Steve's cheek, and kissed him.
A world without Steve Rogers in it made no damned sense to Tony Stark, and that was a tenet to live by.
to reduce how much blood you’re losing."
"A bug," Tony said. Steve pulled a face, exaggerated enough that should the childhood lie about wind changing ring true, he'd have to skip the next batch of official Avengers photoshoots. Not that they did that often, and even less so now they were a truly independent outfit. "A bug trapped in a box."
"Oh, I'm sure Santa knows where to find him," Steve said.
"I freak out when I try to say what I'm feeling and it's not fair. I was never fair to my past partners and I've not been fair to you, Tony. They deserved better and so do you." Steve's mouth tightened into a smile that looked too close to self-loathing for Tony's comfort. "People keep describing me as brave, but they've got no idea what that means, do they?

"Timely," the man said, and at Steve's obvious confusion, he said it again. "This town here is called Timely." The man pointed behind Steve.
"He can’t be all you have in life," Steve reiterated, because it didn’t make a lick of sense. Iron Man deserved more than all of them combined, and the only family member he had left in the world was Tony Stark’s
"Good," Steve smiled, and pressed that smile against Tony's mouth.
"Mm," Tony said, "I

"It's irritating that you always know it's me," Steve declared. His distinctive footsteps quietened as he drew up to watch what Tony was doing. "Do I even want to ask what you're doing?"

Steve joined him as the reporter wrapped up a brief interview with him; he stood out of view of the camera, keeping close to a wall, looking uncomfortable. Tony was okay with being the only one on camera; now the Avengers were an international rather than a purely-American endeavor, they could do with some good press, and Tony was exceptional when it came to that sort of thing.
“Tony my love, look at me, I’m right here”
“Tony? Are you alright?”
He was going to die. He knew for sure. He was trapped and he still couldn’t breathe.
Tony wasn’t really sure where to start. Steve was sat opposite him on the couch in the lab, eyes wide and attentive. How do you go about explaining to someone why you freaked out over breakfast? (Welcome to another episode of
He heard Steve’s grumbling about Fury, and couldn’t supress the giggle that escaped. He cursed himself internally. It was all over now, what with Superbot and his Superhearing. Still determined to avoid cooking dinner (he’d had to deal with grumpy old men all day too, Steve wasn’t special), he prepped his rifle and stared intensely at the door, waiting for Steve to come bursting in. He was all ready to shoot his husband the minute he cracked that door. Instead, Steve’s next words made his blood run cold and his fingers freeze on the trigger.
So Tony did. He told Steve about the greatest shame of his life, that he could make a man hate so much, that he stayed, that he was weak. He spoke and wept and shook, and all the time, Steve’s hands never stopped comforting him, he never moved and he never left. Finally, Tony pulled back, convinced that he would see the same hate in Steve’s eyes as he had caused in
“How did you know what I like for breakfast? I’ve never told you; you shouldn’t know.”
Tony looked down, resolutely avoiding Steve’s eyes until he felt a hand under his chin, gently drawing his head up to meet compassionate blue eyes.
“Oh baby. I’m so, so sorry. You deserve the world; you deserve love and compassion and gentleness and someone who adores you. Everyday I fall more in love with you, and everyday I am shocked at the idiots in the world who can’t see that. It is my joy to spend the rest of my life showing you how much love you deserve.”
Tony was hiding in the closet (no the irony was not lost on him) in bedroom when he heard Steve walk into the penthouse. For all that he could be as stealthy as Natasha on a mission (well maybe not quite as stealthy as Nat, but close), he tended to lapse into a rather heavy tread around the house. Tony loved it, it made him feel safe and protected (not that he needed protecting, but sometimes it was nice to pretend).
No one ever spoke to him with that much love. No one but…
It was at that moment that he had an idea. On the way back from the debrief, he had been listening to an interview that Tony had done when he was 19, just after he had come out. The interviewer was friendly enough but Steve knew that Tony hated the “get to know you” style of the interview, preferring the comfortable familiarity of talking about his work over sharing himself with the public. As such, he mostly gave pretty generic answers, but one moment had stood out to Steve. He had been asked about his ideal guy. Tony had looked pretty uncomfortable. Then, his brow had smoothed, and he’d answered “Well, I wouldn’t say I have a type, but if you want to get into my pants, you’d better be willing to bring me breakfast in bed. Two eggs, soft not runny, a side of bacon and black coffee if you please. Oh! And bonus points for roasted red pepper!”. It had exactly the desired effect, the interviewer was mildly shocked, laughed and moved on to a different topic. Well, if Tony wanted two eggs (soft not runny), a side of bacon and a black coffee (and roasted red pepper), then that’s what Steve would get him. He set to work, humming softly to himself.
One person Tony trusted, or at least loved, was Steve. Steve was safe, at least to an extent. Steve loved him back (he was pretty sure), and Tony had never known Steve to use personal information against anyone, or abuse anyone’s trust. That was a pretty good record for a guy who spent his days working at the most effective intelligence gathering agency in the world (well… most effective apart from the research Tony did on his own time, but that was his business).
You see, as previously mentioned, Tony had Trust Issues. As such, he knew exactly what information he had given Steve. It was all stored, in a select compartment of his brain. He wasn’t paranoid (okay, he was, but could you blame him?), he just needed to know what Steve knew. He needed to know where he was vulnerable. He needed to know what could be used against him. If he knew, the inevitable betrayal wouldn’t be a surprise. Then, maybe it wouldn’t hurt as much (who was he kidding, it would still hurt like his heart was being torn out, but at least he could tell himself he knew). And he knew he hadn’t told Steve how he liked his breakfast. Not that attack by burnt bacon was a big threat, but how he liked his breakfast felt like a special thing. His parents had always felt that breakfast in bed constituted coddling (heaven forbid!), and he’d always imagined that it was something he’d one day share with someone special, someone who would truly love him (if that was possible). He’d never shared it with Steve, not because he didn’t love him (he loved him a scary amount), but because it felt too vulnerable and he wasn’t ready yet.
Steve gave a quiet smile (okay, maybe it was more of a grimace) and reached over to pull Tony into his arms. He couldn’t erase the pain from Tony’s past, but he could spend forever making his present as beautiful as Tony himself.
Which is why he willingly picks up the gun and enters the penthouse with a smile on his face. Nothing delighted him more than showing his husband how much he adored him.
“Yeah sweetheart, I’m right here.”
Steve looked at him, puzzled.
Tony extended a shaking hand to the only person he trusted not to break it. He felt a strong, secure hand wrap gently around it, encompassing it in warmth and love and good.
The fact remained, however, that Tony was scared of people. Not physically, he could spar better than your average thug, and he could summon the suit at a moment’s notice. Not mentally either, he could wipe the floor with experts in about fifty different fields, and he was yet to lose a game of chess. No, what scared Tony about people was trusting them.
Steve got up and walked towards him.
What he saw astonished and panicked him. Tony was staring down at the food, his eyes wide and round with fear, and a gentle tremor in his hands.
Steve picked up the note taped to the penthouse doors (and the nerf gun taped next to it), and grinned. While Tony might seem like a childish playboy to the outside observer, Steve knows that his husband’s heart of gold was wrapped in carefully crafted methods of communication unique to Tony. He knows that he only blasted AC/DC in the lab when he’s feeling safe (if he’s having a bad day the lab is deadly silent so that he knows immediately when someone’s approaching). He knows that Tony cooks Italian when he’s missing his mum, and that if he leaves his suit jacket on the floor, he’s getting heat from the board. All of these are completely unconscious on Tony’s part, and invisible to the casual observer. But Steve knows. Which is how he knows that this note is Tony’s way of reaching out. Tony’s feeling insecure, and wants to know that his husband cares about him enough to put up with his idiosyncrasies in order to spend time with him. Tony probably doesn’t even realise that’s why he did it. But Steve knows.
you know how I like my breakfast?”
“How do you know where… you know what, never mind. The mission finished early, so I thought I’d come back and surprise my beautiful boyfriend!”
Slowly, Tony’s breath evened out, and he looked up to see Steve sitting in front of him, compassionate and caring.
Lying in bed later that evening, something occurred to Tony. He spoke into the darkness.
Tony shuffled his feet and looked down. “Um… do you want to come in?”
On his less psyco-babbly days, Tony would just tell you to fuck off and leave him alone.
Instead, he saw heart-breaking love. He searched for the judgment he was convinced must be there, but he couldn’t find it.
“…great job baby, now breathe out for me… good, and in again… and out… and in…”
Too tired to respond, or even think, Tony collapsed forward into waiting arms. Steve lifted him into his lap, holding him close and rubbing his back. Exhausted, Tony’s last thought before falling asleep was that he had been wrong. There was at least one person in the world who he could trust, one who would keep him safe no matter what.
Anyway, that was his current situation.
Tony collapsed into Steve’s shoulder, weeping gently at the words of the man he loved more than life itself. Steve gathered him up in his arms, and the two made their way to the bed in the bedroom. Dinner long since forgotten, Steve laid Tony down in the bed and wrapped himself protectively around him, holding him until long after they had both drifted off, an unspoken promise to do so forever.
“Can I hold you, my love?” Steve asked.
“…Steve?”
On his more psyco-babbly days, Tony could explain to you that an abusive father and a neglectful mother was more than enough to give him trust issues (it does things to a child to walk into a room and not know if they’re going to be beaten or ignored – and to not know which they’d prefer), but the real kicker was Obadiah Stane. If you’re not messed up enough by your parents, having your ally and business partner stab you in the back (figuratively) and leave you for dead (literally) really gives you issues.
Unfortunately, Steve didn’t know any of this. Without this knowledge, the whole thing was rather comical, so he had started laughing. Not full on belly laughing, more giggling. Tony looked up, hurt and vulnerable. “Um… I’m going to the lab for a bit… lots to do… I’ll see you later”. He scrambled out of bed and headed towards the door. Looking up, Steve realised he had messed up. He tried to call out to Tony, but his lover was already out of the door. Dumbfounded, he leaned back on the bed and tried to figure out what had gone wrong.
It is also worth mentioning that Tony had in front of him what could only be described as a military grade assault rifle. He’d built it when he got bored in the lab this afternoon (in fact, that was where the whole idea for the current activity had come from). It was entirely harmless, it would only fire nerf bullets, and with nowhere near enough strength to hurt. It also had heat and motion sensors, a carbon monoxide alarm and Tetris, because why not.
“…Steve? I can’t breathe”
On a completely unrelated (definitely related) note, Steve had been away on a recon mission for a couple of days. Tony knew where he was (most effective intelligence gathering agency in the world, remember?), and it wasn’t as if he slept better with the bodybuilder/space heater hybrid next to him. He absolutely didn’t miss his personal Captain Justice, and waking up next to Mr Muscle definitely didn’t make him feel protected and comforted in a distinctly un-ironmanlike way (okay… even to him that sounded laughably false). Either way, Steve was gone, and sleep clearly wasn’t an option, so work seemed like a good idea.
“Can you tell me what happened babe?”
“Tony, I’m so sorry people’ve let you down before. And I’m sorry you felt like I was prying into your life. I never meant to make you feel unsafe. I love you so much, and I want to spend forever making you feel safe like you deserve to be.”
“…look at me, baby”
Tony nodded shakily, and he was drawn up into big, strong, eternally gentle arms. Steve cradled him on his lap, running one hand through his soft hair, and the other rubbing grounding circles on his back.
“Tony! I’m coming to find you! You better believe I’m not cooking dinner tonight; I’ve already spent the whole day fending off a pissed off Fury…”
Tony woke up to the smell of fried bacon. Sometime around 04:00am, his eyes had started to close against his will, and he had drifted off into fitful sleep. Now, though, he had been awoken by his stomach’s insistence that he Must Eat. He rolled over with the intention of getting out of bed and investigating the source of the smell, and was surprised by the sight of his boyfriend, holding a tray and wearing a huge grin. Startled, he sat up. “you’re supposed to be in Chile. Why are you here?”
“Oh…” Tony rubbed the sleep from his eyes and made grabby hands at the food. “Welcome back”.
Steve didn’t say anything. He just waited, knowing Tony would share if he was comfortable.
Steve didn’t know how long he sat outside Tony’s lab. At some point he had drifted off, but he woke with a start to the sound of the doors of the lab sliding open. He looked up and saw Tony standing in the doorway (was he imagining it or did his lover almost look… scared?).
“I saw an interview you did after you came out. You talked about it then.”
Steve chuckled at the sight of his barely conscious partner, and handed the food over, sitting down on the bed. He swung his legs over and leant back against the headboard, eyes falling shut of their own volition. But, after a few moments of silence, he opened them again, looking to his right to see if Tony had fallen back asleep.
Tony put a finger on his own mouth, dazed. He wanted to remember every second of it. His poor, damaged heart was
"Toxic masculinity?" Tony pursed his invisible lips. "Internalized misogyny?" He considered it again. "Too many blows to the head?"
" Tony said, drawing out the two syllables, "is obsessed with those cinnamon pastries from that bakery on twenty-fourth, and they do gift certificates."
Steve pulled a noise which either meant he hated that Tony had said something like that, or maybe he didn't like the implication that they'd
Steve inhaled sharply, like hearing those words out loud rattled him. "I wouldn't have put it like that."
"And yeah," Iron Man added, in a low reluctant rumble of voice, "nauseated works."
Steve couldn’t raise his eyebrow any higher. He tried regardless. "I appreciate optimism in a scenario like this, but—"
, but there was a noise at the front door – a key being turned in a lock – and then Steve murmuring musically under his breath, probably humming to Sarah, and wasn't

Steve suppressed a smirk. "I think I could probably muster enough energy to crash some skulls."
"Huh?" Steve said.
"Oh, yeah." Steve blinks. "Yeah, I just wanted to know if he liked Italian food?"
"I'll get back to you," Tony said, and fled; bravery always came with its limits.

Tony shrugged. "Hm. I did wander in on Jen and

Sharon had clearly not been herself. Imperiused, he thought, trying the term out in his head. That fit.
"Uh," Iron Man says. He's probably wincing behind the mask. "It's expensive, so—"
Tony's worried gaze slips from Steve to the door, clearly worried about the Avengers emergency, and then back to Steve in confusion. "A third ball?" he questions.
You always defeat death, Tony, that's what you
"Let's just go home," Tony said, and regretted saying even that much, because that word was wrong. How could

already.
Steve's heart aches. "Well. I refuse to leave here with you so sad." He leans in and solemnly offers Tony a gloved hand. "Dance with me?" He smiles a little, encouragingly. "It might cheer you up."
Tony continued to stare helplessly. He was the one that was frozen now. But Steve wasn't. And because Steve was brave, always so brave, Tony kept watching as Steve got to his feet and took Tony's hand in his again. It was just as electric and Tony couldn't help the gasp that came from his throat at the realization it wasn't just a one-off fluke. For a moment, Tony wondered whether Steve was going to sit in his lap—Tony chalked that thought off as a hysterical daydream brought on by so much time of wishful thinking—and then Steve blew his expectations away like he always did.
"You probably won't," Strange said.

"I think I asked the wrong question," Steve said, staring uncertainly at the town. "
to be true, because Steve was so freaking
Steve didn't stop Tony, probably realizing it was useless to try, but he did continue to look dubious as he steadied the ladder.
"Have you looked up local schools yet? Nursery places can be hard to get, even at her age. And have you registered her yet with a local physician?" Tony pulled out his StarkPhone, immediately looking up the town on his browser. "We should check out their reviews, see which one is the best one to ask for—"
Tony blinked rapidly, several times in a row. Steve was staring at him completely perplexed. "I did," Tony said. "But—"
I'm making the most of it." His gaze lowers to meet Steve's. "The way I see it, someone wants us to suffer. Let them try and make us miserable, or keep us from having a life. I'm going to live my life here, with you, as best as I can. Someone wants us miserable? Fuck 'em."
Iron Man had come towards him? And there'd been noise, and pain, and—oh. Steve was impaled, too, on one of the same pipes that was cleanly buried through Iron Man's body. They were skewered together. That was...interesting. Interesting. That's what Steve's art teacher had said when Steve had brought terrible art to class. If interesting had meant terrible this entire time, Steve was on board with it.
"What do you think I mean?" Tony demanded, setting off again to the disembarkment co-ordinates at an even brisker clip. His eyes threatened to sting and Tony blinked furiously. There was no way he was going to let Steve
"Let's take the day off together," Steve says, impulsively.
Jan blew out her cheeks and squinted at Tony's body speculatively for a long moment before leaning in and pressing a quick kiss against his cheek. Tony fancied he could feel it, just a little.
"Whoa," Hank Pym said, very loudly. "Um—so there's an emergency—uh—"
Steve's opponent disappeared instantly and Tony tried not to think about how close he'd come to a similar fate. Steve's face was a complex storm – like a wheel of emotions, his brain cycling him through them one by one – before it settled onto something ambiguous.
Tony had to fight hard not to smile. He could do this revelation right. Just blurting out the words was awkward. It was much easier to show, not tell. The armor was just downstairs, after all.
Tony couldn't keep it all in his head without feeling like he was going to explode.
"I'll see you tomorrow b—bud," Happy squeaked the last word, swerving from saying
"You said once the helmet was open we could get something that I could use to pack your wound," Steve said. All-business he could do. He was dizzy, and didn’t know if it was from the pain or the blood loss. Or maybe the dizziness was because of the sneaking thought that had crept in, that Steve really
Steve opened his mouth, probably to ask exactly what that meant – apparently Tony hadn't explained being able to
"I'll start without you," Steve says.
Steve took a shaky breath. This had been his decision. A little hurt now was worth a lifetime of heartache, wasn't it?
“Oh?” Steve raised both eyebrows and then, when he realized, his stomach flipped awkwardly, but that could be his own body’s vasoconstriction kicking in. He pictured his veins squeezing shut, desperately trying to divert blood flow, like there was a tiny person redirecting traffic inside him. Hm. Maybe this whole blood loss thing wasn’t working too well for him either. “Oh,” he repeated, eloquently. “I just. I’m not opposed to it.”
Sam flinched. He beckoned Loki in and away from the doorway. It took him a minute to remember that Loki was a shapeshifter, but once he did it made sense. “Lo this is my sister Sarah and my mother. Guys this is Lo. No, I did not get a girl pregnant only to find a kid on my doorstep seventeen years later.”
Steve laughed. “Bucky tell you I’m feeling whimsy?”
“Pepper got everyone tickets to see Swan Lake tonight,” Tony explained his eyes sparkling, “it’s your congratulations for dealing with trauma celebration night. Which needs a better name SAM,” Tony yelled the last part glaring at the other man.
Then he watched Supernatural with Clint and then searched Supernatural on Tumblr and apparently Dean was a flaming bisexual and being only three seasons in Steve didn’t get any of that and had to google bisexual and that was like a punch to the gut. Which made him spiral into a google and Tumblr search of everything LGB and later when he figured it out T.
“Just want to make sure you know where you are with him,” Sam answered because the almost dating thing between Steve and Tony never really got fixed.
He walked out of the room and Sam laid against his bed. It was horrible. He was a bisexual widow, one of the first guys to get married. And his best friend didn’t know. Even if as Peter claimed Steve was the bisexual to end all bisexuals. Sam knew that no one would judge. But he didn’t have the heart to tell them that he was still broken and agonizing over his love’s death.

The door hadn't even fully closed when he shoved Tony back up against the shelves. Steve was insane.

"Ugh, no, my mystery guy was an absolute gentleman who rescued me from Mary Wintermouth's endless self-absorbed monologues," Tony sighs and lifts up his face again to stare miserably at Steve. "You must think I'm kind of awful, huh? Kissing someone and not even getting their name? Ugh."

a mental image cute enough to give Tony a cavity. Tony gritted his teeth and nonchalantly worked on screwing in the next latch.
"Well," Tony says, holding back the noise he wants to make, "certainly I'm disappointed. But I'm not surprised. Iron Man's pretty great." Tony can say that easily; Iron Man is all the best parts of him, after all.
Strange didn't even flinch.
"Believe me, if I could we wouldn't be having this conversation," Strange said.
in their current situation, but Tony's face went pale and slack, his mouth open and his whole body jolted. and Tony was wheezing then, fighting for air, and all Steve could do was stare upward and hate this whole situation with his entire being.
Iron Man laughs, the modulator flattening it out into a beep. "I'll ask him to get some sent here to the mansion."
If there was pain from the shelves digging into him, Steve's lips against his were a balm that took away all sensation but sheer, transcendent

"Yes?"
Steve smiles at him. "I'd rather you fucked me." He considers it for a moment. "Maybe after a nap." He squints. "I don't think I could stand up right now."
Tony might not have cared.
Iron Man makes a low humming noise, which is his usual equivalent of a shrug. "More like a tent. The armor isn't hard until it's polarized."
"Well, that's kind of true—" Tony meant to laugh it off, but realization came, slow and like a slug to the gut. His mouth was suddenly dry and he had to swallow hard to get his next words out. Even so, they came out in a strained hiss. "It's a standard excuse, Steve. One I tend to give reporters so they leave with a relatively okay image of me, rather than pissed off with a handy deadline and column issues to take out their displeasure of being rejected."
Tony commanded his brain, but it didn't listen to him.
Steve glared at Carol, his exhausted face managing an almost combative expression.
Steve shuffled, but nodded jerkily, a pleasant pink flush creeping up his neck. Tony pressed his smile into Steve's matching grin and kissed him thoroughly.
It understandably took a few moments for Tony to be able to talk again. Steve tried not to count the number of rapid, jagged inhales and exhales from Tony’s mouth as he waited.
had an unattractive Avenger. It was true, Tony thought idly, that superpowers tended to land squarely on the conventionally beautiful. They suffered for it, enough; maybe the pretty faces were compensation, the result of some sort of cosmic karmic balancing for all the shit they went through.
"Yeah," Tony breathed. "I
"He's going to be fine," Carol said.
"Looking good," Tony called out, gaining him a full row of faces turned his way: Thor, Robbie, Carol, Jen, and Steve. T'Challa wasn't there; he took his role as leader much more seriously than any Avenger ever had, and was probably in his office, brooding. Or maybe he was healthily getting enough sleep, unlike the rest of them. "Why the early morning?"
Sometimes things weren't meant to be.
And Tony, well, he was just startled enough to do as Steve ordered.
"Tell me," Steve said slowly, his voice shaky but determined, "if I'm reading this wrong."
He didn't agree with Steve's earlier assessment – that Tony might regret doing it. And he
someone to their dream, and then a thousand steps beyond—looking past Steve’s bright ideas of happiness into some far-off vision that Steve couldn’t even imagine.
Iron Man, all the parts that mattered. Knowing his name hadn’t changed Steve’s regard for him. Well, maybe it had changed a little. Steve’s quiet level of being impressed with Iron Man and his awe of Tony Stark had combined into a weird, low, pulsing feeling that took up space in Steve’s chest every time Steve saw him. So. There was that.
Tony said something and Steve strained to piece the sounds together. “You should glue me back together.”
"Is that safe?" Steve asks, because that's more important to him than satisfying their collective curiosity. He can't deny that he is curious. Iron Man isn't exactly an open book or effusive about things, so every time Steve gets a tiny scrap of information about the technology
Steve pursed his lips. "Um… you to share your cookies with me?" His sad expression twisted into something more sly. "You're going to get enough of them left for you by all the chimneys you're due to drop down."
"Do you feel nauseous yet?”
"You could bring him here. We'll be doing something here at the base."
"What's distracting?" Steve asks, and turns in the direction McCoy is pointing to see one of Steve's favorite things about the twentieth century: Iron Man.
Tony grinned at him. "
Tony smiled at Steve, somewhat giddily; Steve matched it after a moment.
Tony was being stupid if he thought it wasn't enough. That was it; it was just Tony's brain misfiring. Probably some sort of semi-buried instinct for self-sabotage: Tony
"You know what this means?" Carol smiles at Iron Man. "You can come to the ball out of the armor and your identity would still be safe."
