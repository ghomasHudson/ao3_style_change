“Yeah?” Tony panted, “Well, you have the most perfect cock so let’s get them together.”
Steve grabbed the bow tie, making sure it’s the right size, before standing up.
Tony looked up at Steve. Large brown eyes looked even bigger from this angle, and a pout completed the sad puppy look, “Does that mean I don’t get ice cream?”
In his mind, Steve promised himself that he would fulfill every childhood wish Tony ever had, and if it started with Father Christmas himself, then so be it.
wet and flushed. She walked over to the refrigerator and pulled out a bottle of water, before crossing the kitchen to land a kiss on Tony’s cheek. “Good morning.”
“You’re not usually the type to attack from behind.”
Just then, they heard a scream. A scream that sounded like a child’s and could only belong to one person.
“Hey, Thor. Glad to see you’re back,” Steve greeted as he walked out from behind the kitchen counter with a plate of cut fruit and a small bowl of yogurt.
“It’s wonderful, Tony. I’ll send this to the rest of the guys. They’ll love it.” Tony gleefully smiled and Steve couldn’t help pinching those cheeks.
many lives. Without you, HYDRA would have taken over humanity. Without you, the Avengers would have no one to lead them. Without you, I’d probably have just jumped off the fucking roof a damn long time ago. But nope, none of that matters, because motherfucking Piece of Shit Loki Laufeyson
Then Peggy died.
The world burnt around them.
Of course Tony wanted to help. Of course he did. Barely even able to walk, and it was the person who’d put him in that state that he was more worried about than himself. That was… that was the most Tony Stark thing Steve had ever heard. He sat on the floor like while Bruce watched over him, just listening to the sound of Tony’s voice through the thin walls. His sounded desperate, voice cracking as he asked Clint to go get Steve again.
Wearily, he turned again, watching Tony hurry toward him, jumping down the stairs two at a time in his ratty jeans and faded band tshirt. “What do you want, Tony?” He asked.
They worked tirelessly and seamlessly, having drilled this three other times previously. And although Tony loved to complain about the way Steve worked them, he and the rest of the team all understood their value and knew that they really did improve their performance out on the field. Unfortunately, Steve also knew they understood, and so never let them have a single inch of leeway either. And after an hour of ruthless training regimes, it left them a little bit weary, to say the least.
The whole team were positively beaming, and everyone seemed to have forgotten how to stand still- even Steve was fiddling with his hands as Tony read through the first note.
He felt a few eyes on them as they walked up together, but Tony was used to that by then, as were most people in the school, so they barely even batted an eyelash when Steve left Tony at the door of his science class with a long kiss and a shared laugh. They were just that weird Baseline Unhuman couple that everyone was sure was a sex thing, or a forced thing, or a whatever the fuck. Tony didn’t give a shit what they thought, personally. All he cared about was Steve.
“Nah,” he waved a hand, trying for nonchalance. “Just cranky.”
are the stalker,
With a short wave that quickly turned into a middle finger, Steve just turned back around. He was in a good mood, and no slimy asshole was going to ruin that. “If only all your girlfriends told you that when you fucked, you might actually be able to hold onto them!” He called back cheerfully, bouncing up the stairs and not looking back. By the entrance he spotted Clint, Jane and Carol, and he waved at them all before nudging his way into the circle. “Hey guys.”
contracts— with the military, with other weapons companies. That didn’t make any sense.
He went still in the cot while everyone continued to bustle around him, distantly hearing Thor ask whether they could cut the turkey yet. Steve was sat right next to him, but Tony kind of didn’t want to look his way. This was probably going to be embarrassing.
"Child services?" Bruce offered, but then Clint's brow furrowed in disdain and he shook his head.
Guess it didn’t really matter, anyway.
“Tony, your problems are my problems—”
“Just let it go, guys,” he said before they could attempt to comfort him. He didn’t need it. He knew the situation, and he’d known it going in. Tony was complicated, and his friends were assholes. There was nothing new about that.
, Peggy," Steve rolled his eyes, "and I do... well, I mean I try to post pictures of him. He just doesn't like them- says he looks bad, and I'm not gonna post them if he doesn't want them up. Obviously."
Steve and Tony are fighting- Peter doesn't agree with this.
Steve raised his eyebrows, slamming the side of his shield into a soldier’s face before opening the door that he’d been guarding. “Sorry Romanov, but I regret to inform you that I’m in a committed relationship.”
Tony Stark was definitely plotting something, and was in it for the long haul here, because he wouldn’t just be nice to Steve for no reason. No way.
“-We’re all still gonna be right here, yeah?” Sam finished, smiling across at him and giving his shin a gentle kick under the table.
Tony’s fingers curled just that little bit tighter against Steve’s chest. He was tense; stood to his full height as he stared off with Zeke in the hall. Steve hadn’t ever seen him like that before- not even the last time he’d been in confrontation with the other guy. In that moment, Steve could sort of understand why everyone thought Tony was trouble. His eyes were fire and his gaze hard sharp enough to cut.
“You need to fuck off, Ty,” he spat, “I’m sorry I didn’t come out with you last night, okay, but I actually
“Artificial Intelligence,” Tony answered, “don’t worry, you won’t feel a thing, the scan’s just external.”
Once he’d managed to open the door for the remaining SHIELD agents to flock through, the fight was short-lived. There weren’t nearly enough HYDRA to combat the wave of defenders, and Steve knew he wasn’t needed any further in regards to the round-up of enemy forces.
was the one Darcy had been talking about earlier that week- Heather Whateverthefuck- and suddenly he didn’t feel particularly like just walking away from that.
them. That’s why I flew over there. They… it was my first flight out as Iron Man. I saw them on the news. The Ten Rings. They were… they had
He walked slowly over to the empty chair, and then sat down in one fluid motion, looking over at Tony. Tony’s head was turned to the opposite wall. Every muscle in his body was taut, still. Steve tried to think of what to start with. He knew he didn’t have long, after all.
Bruce pulled a face. “I honestly don’t know. And I’m sort of wary to send anyone in there, because he’s, uh-”
asshole, and Steve felt uncomfortable with the thought of Ty being anywhere near him.
But then Steve leaned in again. He kissed Tony’s nose, of all places. “I have very positive thoughts on that matter, actually,” he admitted, before his eyes flashed with seriousness and he looked deeply into Tony’s eyes. “I thought… I thought that I might lose you out there,” he admitted, and under the table he found Tony’s hand, lying flat on the hospital bed. He squeezed tight. “You were so pale and—and Helen Cho is a miracle worker, but it was touch and go for a little while, and… yeah. The point is, I don’t think I should waste any more time hiding the fact that I’m pretty damn in love with you.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve said again, tilting Tony’s head back upward gently with his two fingers. His eyes were tired, but full of life. It was enough. “I know it must have hurt you to watch that.”
Of course, his heart promptly jumped all the way up to his throat when he saw Tony sat in his spot. It did that whenever he saw Tony anywhere, though, so he was fairly used to the feeling by that point.
Even if they did piss him off to the ends of the earth some days.
“Oh look, Steve,” Zeke laughed, turning to him, “it’s your knight in shining armor, come to save your honor. Sweet. How long do you think you’re gonna last, huh, before he gets bored of you? Before he fucks you over just like he does to everyone else? He’s not really good at staying. Not really good at anything except getting on his knees for anyone who asks. Like to beg for it, don't you Tony?”
But then suddenly Steve comes in and wrestles the bottle of whiskey out of his hand like he’s gonna die within the next three seconds if he continues to touch the damn thing, and Tony realises it probably looks a lot worse than it is.
Or at least, he did for about two seconds. Until Tony swung back his fist and punched him in the face so hard that his whole body snapped back from the impact, sending him hurtling to the floor as all his strength deserted him at once.
“Come inside,” he said a few moments later, pulling away with a final light press of lips, “we’ll hang out at Bucky’s for a few hours and then go home, how does that sound?”
“Then there’s not much point, is there? I don’t want a party where the underlying thoughts are about Natasha not being there and why that is. We could… it could just be us, tomorrow. Just hanging out, normal day.” Tony paused, before adding, “Maybe with the bunny ears thrown in.”
God. But
Tony looked slowly around the room, hearing Clint stand up from the couch, having apparently sensed the growing tension around him. “Take Peter to your floor, Clint,” he ordered, pointing a finger, “now, quickly, before they get up here.”
Tony paused, feeling the gazes of his team fall on him. Only then did he remember that he was now without the armour. But… he could still be an asset without it, surely. “I’m coming with you,” he said defensively, turning to the rest of the team.
There were moments, some survivors Steve had talked to said—moments before things happened, when they felt like they just knew, deep in their bones, that something was going to change their entire world in those next few seconds. A woman in her forties; Katheryn, Steve think she was called—told him that before her son was turned to dust, she’d looked into her little boy’s’ eyes and just known, deep in her soul, that these were their last few moments together, and so she’d told him she’d loved him as quick as she could, and sure enough, a moment later he’d been gone.
At the end of the night, when Steve was finished with dressing Tony for bed, Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck.
Update finished! I posted before a week passed, is that impressive or what?
, Fury. Tony is part of the Avengers and as team leader, he is
“Tony Stark
Tony immediately knew what to do. With a giant grin, he tossed the ball away from him, “Fetch, Dum-E!”
“Jarvis, what’s the emergency?” Steve asked as he looked at the still locked door.
Tony practically melted in Steve’s arms. Their kiss was mind-blowing as always. Every soft swipe of their tongues, every gentle tug of their lips, every little nip from teeth, they never failed to make Tony feel like goo, and he loved every bit of it.
Steve crossed the room, and stood in front of the door with one hand closed around the doorknob. Locked.
Tony would usually be running into his room by now. Curious, Steve hopped out of bed and made the short walk to the room next to his where, upon entering, a mop of black hair immediately caught his eyes. Tony was still sleeping, cocooned everywhere but the top of his head. Steve smiled as he went over and gently tugged the blanket until it revealed the face it was hiding.
,” Clint said with a snort. “How’d Tony even agree?”
Steve neared the bed and carefully laid Tony down between the pillow fort he created yesterday and slipped in next to the sleeping toddler.
“Most likely things from before his change.” Bruce said. “He’s trying to make sense of his memories, but having been four in one period of time and being four now, it’s more like trying to connect two different timelines together.”
“Tony?” Steve knocked on the door. His uniform was on, and the shield was against his back, but he couldn’t help but feel like he was going into battle with a heavy heart. “I have to go to work for a bit. Nick is going to take care of you while I’m gone, alright?”
“Tony!” Steve ran to Tony and scooped the boy up into his arms, burying his face into the top of Tony’s soft hair. “You’re okay! Oh, god, you’re alright!” Steve’s throat felt like it was being squeezed between a fist. He couldn’t get anymore words out and instead showed his relief by holding Tony tighter.
“He didn’t exactly...”
“What kind of ice cream do you want, Tony?” Steve asked, shaking Tony’s left foot lightly to get his attention.
“What happened?”
he was. The only people he considered his closest friends were James Rhodes and Pepper Potts.
“Thanks, guys.” Steve said appreciatively. He looked down at the top of Tony’s dark, wavy hair, chuckling when Tony start nodding off, “Alright, kiddo. Let’s go get you ready for bed.”
“Great,” Steve said and placed Tony down. He gave him one last pat on the head before crossing the floor—his steps quick to prevent Tony from waiting—and stepped into the elevator. Once inside, he pressed the button for the floor he hadn’t visited since Tony was de-aged.
To Steve it just looked like smart people in white lab coats and tablets walking around and making random marks as they looked at unfinished projects, but to Tony it must have been like he stepped in a fantasy world.
Instead of heading to the training room—he was confident in his team’s ability to keep each other safe—Steve made his way to the common floor.
Tony looked down at his blanket, contemplating for a moment, before returning his gaze back to Steve. “It was dark and smelly. And my face was really wet. Someone kept yelling, but I didn’t know what they were saying...”
Steve felt like shards of ice stabbed his heart and froze his blood, and immediately, a wicked kind of dread filled his heart. Tony never talked about what happened during his abduction in Afghanistan, only a short sentence in his file said that the Ten Rings tried forcing him to make weapons. But here Tony was, nine years old and having those memories violate his sleep.
“Yep,” Steve grinned proudly, as if feeding Tony was an accomplishment. “He finished his bottle about ten minutes ago. I didn’t realize he was such an early riser though.”
“Save and send this to the rest of the group, would you, Jarvis?”
“Tony, I told you. You can’t go into the lab. It’s too dangerous,” Steve said for what felt like the millionth time. A tight frown was on his face as he attempted to deal with Tony at eight in the morning.
The elevator slid open, “What’s with the crying? I could hear it all the way downstairs.” Clint and Natasha walked into the living room, both with concerned looks on their faces. They looked like they just hopped out of bed, in a rush to hurry to Tony.
Shuffling up onto his hands and knees, Tony could hear the moment Steve saw what the underwear was truly hiding. Or in this case,
“Each subject had different methods of exposure, but the ones that showed results came through consumption. Injection, surprisingly, showed no results. The dosages seem to range from one to two tablespoons of his ‘concoction’ diluted with eight ounces of water.”
“We had a bit of an argument.”
Natasha and Clint, having returned from their mission for Shield, were making dinner for the team—a recipe inspired by their recent trip to Germany. The sounds of cracks, pounds, and metal against metal made it sound like a small war was happening in the kitchen.
“I t-thought…” Tony mumbled something, and even with Steve’s enhanced hearing he couldn’t make it out.
Tony looked over to Steve with a pulled face, setting down his tablet. “Then change his diaper!” He called out, “there are some in the cupboard where we keep the condiments.”
idea what effect you have on me- just sat there on my stupid desk, talking with my stupid robot, looking so
Tony had essentially just bared his entire soul to him, and Steve had… no idea how to react to it. Part of him wanted to shake him senseless for thinking so lowly of himself, and the other half was having to be restrained from just launching himself at that idiot boy and kiss the smoke right out of his mouth.
“Oh- sorry sir, I’m going, I’m going,” Steve mumbled in embarrassment, pulling his bag hurriedly off the bag and then shoving all his shit inside quickly- how the fuck had he not noticed the whole classroom emptying? Thoughts about Tony were dangerous things, and far too easy to get lost in.
“-and you think you can just do that to him in his own fucking home, you sick fuck, he
“I- I don’t- that’s not-“
But honestly, Tony, despite all his many issues, knew that Steve would. He couldn’t deny Steve’s love for him—not here, not now, when they were sat up in some uncomfortable fucking tree in Ohio where Steve had whisked him away in response to Tony’s earlier mental collapse.
A minute later Tony came back and sat next to him, a safe distance away. He handed Steve his whiskey and then instantly threw back his own glass in one. When Steve raised an eyebrow at him, Tony just waved him off. “Oh, come on. My ex fiancé just showed up at my door saying the US government is trying to kill him. I deserve this.”
Everyone laughed. “Wasn’t he chained to a lamp-post at the time?” Natasha asked with an amused cock of her eyebrow, looking out of the window.
But he never found what he always was. A second later and he was out, the blood-loss knocking him into peaceful oblivion. The last thing on his mind was Tony’s face; creased with concern and determination, and something that looked dangerously close to love.
Steve grinned down at his phone and then lifted his head as he heard Mrs Wilson hailing him from downstairs, undoubtedly for dinner. He jumped up and pocketed the phone in order to go eat, bumping into Sam along the corridor as he went.
“Yeah, just no using the laser, got it? And you can’t fly it around unless one of us is with you, and definitely not anywhere but the practice room.”
“How was meeting Santa, kid?” Clint asked as Steve waited for the picture to be printed.
“Look at you. Wrapped up so prettily, like a gift just for me.” Steve pulled the fabric again, this time it was the string directly down the crack of his ass, and let go. The sharp snap had Tony letting out another moan—his hole was clenching against the fabric, trying its best to find relief from the teasing. “On your hands and knees.” Steve’s hand landed a light smack on his ass.
“The water hasn’t boiled yet.” The hopeful looks on their faces dashed, especially Clint’s since Tony’s scream was right in his ear.
“But, Steeeve. I can fix it! I just have to disconnect the camera and remove the fingerprint scanner and-“
Steve shut his eyes and, wrapping his hands around Tony’s waist, walked backwards and dragged Tony into the water with him.
He predicted a slime splash back, he did just blast the thing, but he didn’t expect it to fucking land in his mouth. Tony reeled back with a grimace and shout. That was a weird taste that he didn’t want to experience ever again.
“Is anyone else here?” Tony asked. He pulled off his t-shirt and tossed it somewhere behind him.
“Look, it’s either I catch you or I drop you! You think this is fun for me?”
*****
“You flatter me.” Natasha nodded up to the ceiling behind him, “Better hurry up. You got forty minutes left.”
Tony was practically jumping in excitement, an adorable sight especially when he still looked so little engulfed in his coat and hat. When the group first walked into Macy’s, the first thing they saw was the enormous Christmas tree standing right inside the department store.
the elevator, and ended up seeing the gleaming robot when he called the elevator down again. A few more trials occurred before they even got anywhere, most of it consisting of:
Tony’s hair was damp from sweat and his face was red as he took in deep stuttering breaths. Steve looked at him solemnly, wondering what he saw in his nightmare. Sighing, he placed the blanket carefully over Tony and sat at the edge of the bed. He then let one hand rest on Tony’s head and idly stroked his hair.
“Fail and you must buy us ice cream! Mwahaha!”
Steve quietly gasped out as he reached in to gently remove the fragile being from the suit.
“You really do have the most perfect ass,” Steve said entranced as he squeezed said ass between his hands, bringing them together and spreading them out again, forcing the two strings to rub against Tony’s sensitive hole and exposing it to the air over and over.
see me, exit the elevator.”
“Please, Steve. Get your cock in me already.” Tony mumbled, his brown eyes pleading as they rested their foreheads against each others’.
After what felt like a few seconds away from having his arm dislocated, Steve gently retracted his hand, gave a nod, and went to gather his teammates.
Steve began slowly walking over, eyes never off of Tony. His eyebrows were furrowed, and the intense gaze finally met Tony’s eyes when he was right in front of the bed.
Steve immediately tossed the papers away with an annoyed grunt. God, did people have no shame? Poor Tony, Steve thought. The rest of the team was lucky to be able to maintain a private personal life thanks to the fact that no one knew their real names. But Tony had been in the spotlight since he was born, and it made Steve so angry to know that people were willing to create false rumors about him just to gain a moment of fame.
Steve was surprised yet wasn’t when Tony quickly disassembled the clock with a toolkit Steve borrowed from the workshop, and just as quickly put it all back together. It was one thing to hear that Tony was a genius ever since he was a child, but to see it was completely different.
Of course, that had sounded like a good idea when he’d been walking up to school this morning. Now put into practise, with three curious and worried faces staring intently at him, he was beginning to think he should have just stayed in the bathroom.
Then the noise sounded out, loud enough to make even Tony wince.
Steve needed to get to them. To Tony.
“I SAID SHUT UP!” Steve was yelling at him, standing over his body as he curled in defensively on the floor- for the first time completely and utterly aware of exactly what Steve could do to him if he got angry enough. “THAT MEANS
to be a protective friend, it just ended up being… slightly misplaced,” Bucky snapped irritably, walking into the front room with Steve at his heels. He stopped halfway through the door though, and Steve almost brained himself on the guy’s shoulder. “Although, now you’ve actually fucked, that
Natasha froze for a good few seconds, before sighing dramatically and patting him on the shoulder. “Oh baby, you really think that’s it, don’t you?”
Tony gasped, feeling a rib crack with the impact. He bent double but Steve caught him in his arms, holding him steady as he wheezed. Tony was too busy trying to tamp down on the urge to cry out to push him off, so he just sagged into Steve’s hold instead, broken and pathetic.
Steve did. “You want me to act as a honeypot,” he said, voice blank, and when Fury nodded, Steve just felt himself sink further.
wanted to explore that thoroughly at some point. But, back to his point—maybe that was what Tony was missing so much. Maybe he kept getting little tastes of it every time he kissed Steve. Was that a thing? He’d have to ask. Although, if it turned out that it
Bouncing off the side of the wall, he arced up and got a hand around the branch, quickly taking firm hold and then pulling himself up to join Tony. When he saw the other boy staring a little incredulously, he just laughed and looked back over to the other, more illegal side of the wall. “Shall we?” He asked.
It was a sombre thing to say in the dark and silent room. Steve swallowed, then nodded slowly as he squeezed down on Tony’s hand and moved to rest it on Tony’s chest. He tucked his knees up to his chest and looked at his boyfriend with a watery smile.
Tonight wasn’t one of those nights, though. Steve had been called out for active duty that day alongside the rest of the Avengers, and so they’d spent most of the afternoon and evening in battle with a new wave of robots that had almost managed to take London. It had been hard, and tiring, and Steve had come home sore but miraculously uninjured. The same couldn’t be said for Tony, though.
Of course, Tony was correct. It wasn’t fun at all. He and Steve religiously trawled through each segment of information in Tony’s workshop, hunting for extra information, anything at all that they could find. Unfortunately, it seemed that Lewinsky’s work had only been about developmental milestones after his birth and not any of the science behind Peter’s initial creation or the DNA that he was carrying. That seemed to have been the responsibility of a different faction. Tony had thrown back a glass and a half of whiskey before he’d started looking through the files again, unable to handle it all without the Dutch Courage of alcohol to ease his way, and even then, his hands never stopped shaking, not for the whole night. Steve wasn’t much better either—he was quiet, achingly quiet, as he looked through all the information Lewinsky had on her phone, and every twenty minutes or so he abruptly left the room for a short while in order to take a small break from it all.
“Yes,” Steve answered instantly, “I’m positive.”
Tony just shrugged. “Thugs don’t give up easy,” he explained, and then held up a finger in sign for Steve to wait a moment as his other hand began digging into the pocket of his jeans.
Tony hissed through his teeth, “I… we lost, Steve. Fucking accept it. He won, and he beat us, and we have to fucking move on. Isn’t that what you tell everyone at your support group? Isn’t that what we all tell the world, every damned day?”
Tony didn’t care about him. Tony was just lying to him to further his own agenda.
Steve’s face stilled as he put two and two together. “You watched them… hurting him, didn’t you,” he whispered, looking down at Peter as he played with Tony’s tie, completely oblivious.
For a moment, the words simply buzzed around in the back of Steve’s brain, but then when they settled in and actually absorbed, Steve suddenly felt himself jerk his head up, looking at Tony with huge, wide eyes. “What?” he hissed, a little too loudly, because someone swore at him from over to his left, and a marshmallow went flying into the back of his head. He blinked, and then said in a quieter tone, “Tony, are you serious?”
God, Steve didn’t think he was ever going to get tired of listening to him speak.
“Sir, the temperature is below freezing—”
Steve grabbed him by the waist before he could kick at Ty’s stomach and pulled him back forcibly. Steve didn’t weigh much, but he knew how to work his angles and made sure to throw Tony over his hipbone, pushing him backward and sending him away. Clint and Sam and Nat, who had suddenly joined the front of the crowd, all grabbed him before he could try and go back for round two, and they shoved him away and out of sight of Ty. Steve glanced down at the boy on the floor, now just beginning to sit up with rapid blinks, blood spewing from his nose and pooling in his hands. He locked eyes with Steve, just for a second, and the hatred that was in his eyes in that moment almost made Steve want to look away. Almost.
“Perfect,” Tony nodded, “I’m fucking starving. Let’s get brunch.” He let go of Steve’s hands and turned around, fingers fiddling with his hair, “just give me five minutes to clean up first. Although…” A small grin flashed across his face as he twisted his neck, looking back, “-before any of that-“
“P-promise?” Tony wobbled out.
Feeling the effect of Steve’s soothing pats, Tony’s sobs slowed down to hiccups.
Hopefully Tony's adorableness will get you to forgive me
“… I am anywhere you need me, sir.”
Tony thought as his head tilted back.
Tony ran up to them, waving his controller, “Did you see it? I made the bee shoot a laser!”
“... And then you connect this wire to this. Now the bee can melt the steel with the laser!” A child’s voice exclaimed right before the Avengers witnessed the same bee-like drone Steve saw earlier fly to the thick sheet of steel near the other side of the wall, use its stinger to melt a hole just slightly larger than its body, and fly through.
“Captain Rogers! I tried to keep him away but he was extremely convincing and suggested that we should make adjustments and then he jumped on the table and
“Yes, sir?”
“S-Steve,” Tony whined. Steve’s balls slapping against him, the slick, wet noise filling the room, Steve’s voice, his cock. “I-I...
Steve felt his grip slip a little, and sensed the pain as the metal cut through his skin, but he couldn’t let go- he had to stay and get Tony, stop Tony falling, save him,
Tony, for the first time, smiled. Soft and small, he looked over to Steve and squeezed their hands together gently, before the smile faded once more and he turned into Steve, thumb tracing almost imperceptibly soft underneath Steve’s eye. “I promise I’m gonna make this right,” he said, “I’m not… I know you think I’m ashamed of you, that I don’t want to be seen with you, but I’ll fix that, I will, I’m going to-“
Before they knew it, there was a buzz at the door, and Thor got up to let Rhodey into the apartment. Tony’s frame perked up when he heard the deep tones of his best friend’s voice talking to Thor, and both he and Steve watched as the boy marched straight around the corner, eyes immediately falling to Tony. A variety of emotions crossed over his face while he stood there in front of them and took Tony in—fury, grief, sympathy, sadness—but in the end, he just settled on a smile. His march became a gentle stroll, and he slowly moved forward in order to sit on the couch next to Tony.
Peter babbled then, apparently agreeing. They both huffed in amusement, glancing between one another and the baby in the middle of them. Tony sighed. “We should probably talk to the team,” he said in the end, getting to his feet, “this is somewhat of a development. I’m guessing that they’ll want to hear it. JARVIS, wake ‘em all up and tell them to meet us in the kitchen, will you?”
Fury said nothing for a moment, his jaw twitching the way it always did when he was uncomfortable. Something began to sink in Steve’s stomach; an ominous forewarning that he was not going to like what he was about to hear. A sudden terrible thought popped into his head not even a second later, and suddenly the breath froze in his throat, veins turning to ice. “Is—is he dead?” He leaned back imperceptibly, like he could physically avoid the answer he didn’t want to hear.
“What can I say, I’m a complete hypocrite,” Tony admitted, smiling softly at Steve, before nudging him with his thigh. “I’m serious, though, you need-”
Rhodey’s eyes were serious as he turned to Steve again. They looked at each other for a moment, and then Steve nodded once. He felt like some sort of mantle had just been unconsciously passed to him. “I promise,” he said firmly, which seemed to be good enough for Rhodey, because his shoulders dropped a little bit and he relaxed, turning away once more with a wave of his hand. Steve watched him all the way to his car before closing the door in front of him and then just sighing tiredly.
Steve’s mouth was still hanging over in shock as he brought the phone to his ear.
The last time he had, Steve had been beating him half to death.
Peggy waved a hand vaguely, “you have to get out there! Hang out with people when they invite you places. Engage in conversation. Throw yourself into new situations! You are a free spirit, Steve, you are a child in the midst of the best years of your life! Go to… parties and stuff. Do kids still do that?”
Steve wondered how much the boy hid about himself in order to give his friends the person that they needed.
He paused and swallowed down the lump in his throat, but he didn’t let go of Steve’s hands. “But I was dying up there, and all I could think about was you. About how I wish I’d just put aside my pride and talked to you, about how much still loved you. I spent two years of my life too angry and stubborn to back down and talk to you first, but up there, I realised how fucking stupid it was. I made myself unhappy just so I could act like I was better off without you.” His eyes were filled with regret as he looked down and whispered, feather-soft, “I wasn’t. Not at all.”
God, this was weird.
“Yeah?”
“How does someone exactly get ready to fight an intergalactic army intent on wiping out half of the universe?”
He had to have heard that wrong. “What?”
Tony shot him another look, face smug as he watched Steve try and pull his eyes away from Tony’s mouth. “Hot, right?”
Steve felt his breath hitch a little, and he waited for the reply. Ty remained silent for a second, head cocked. He seemed almost amused.
“There have barely been more than five consecutive minutes of you talking to me where you haven’t dropped in a ‘husband’ somewhere, Tony. I can’t imagine how it must be for the team to go through this, every day,” Pepper told him, placing a hand on Thor’s shoulder supportively as he looked on sadly, shaking his head a little.
“Love you too, Peggs,” Steve muttered, moving slowly to his feet from the couch which has been slowly swallowing him. His ass had left an imprint. “Give me the money, Nat- you all want the same as last time. Right?”
He didn’t speed up, look around or hold the trolley too tight as he wheeled it along. All of those would be things that could give him away, and contrary to what Tony might try and say, Steve could play the part when he needed to. And right now, he really,
Steve’s brow creased a little. “I love you too, but what are you thanking me for?”
have stayed a little longer.”
Tony very much did not want to think about that, however, so he shoved it into the dark corners of his mind and then focused on simply batting away the nurses and demanding that they let him go. Apart from the elevated heart-rate, he was physically fine, and so after a few minutes they rescinded, and he was out like a shot, hurrying over to Steve’s room with anxious, flighty eyes. He looked for doctors hurrying, looked for worried glances his way. Those were usually the signs that there was something wrong.
“We’ll talk about everything in the morning,” Tony promised, “just sleep, baby.” His hand squeezed down around Steve’s, and he tilted his head backward, giving Steve access to his cheek for a little kiss. Steve was still sort of reeling from their conversation, and he had… a lot of stuff that he needed to say—but Tony was right. He was exhausted, and he didn’t have the energy to broach all the subjects just now. God, just being awake for those thirty seconds and thinking that he’d murdered Tony had been enough to just take any energy straight out of his body.
“Okay,” Tony clapped his hands and then made a shooing motion to the three other people in the room, turning back to Steve with a sly look in his eyes, “time for you to leave again. We need to do some celebrating on our own.” He leaned back down and caught Steve’s mouth in a searing kiss, uncaring of their audience. Steve hummed in agreement, his hand sliding over Tony’s hip and then making its home on Tony’s butt.
“Hey,” he mumbled, “s’rry ‘bout… didn’t…”
“Where is he,” Steve whispered, his voice wet as he looked at Bruce. Everything was so fuzzy in his head, and he was so Goddamn confused. They’d messed with his brain. They’d made him attack Tony. Now Bruce was here saying he was okay, but
“I’m gonna miss my flight,” Tony whined, looking up at him with an attempted glare. It didn’t really work. He looked far too cute, with his nose and cheeks both pink from the freezing cold and his wool coat zipped up all the way to his mouth, shrouding him in fabric. He extracted Steve’s arms from around his waist with leather-gloved hands and took a step back, wrinkling up his face when he was subsequently exposed to the harsh wind. “God, why do you have to be so irritatingly warm?”
Rather than scoff and admit he was joking, Thor just shrugged, which,
Steve knew, looking back, that the words Loki had whispered to him had been just that: words. Empty. Designed to throw him off.
“No, nothing dumb, I promise,” Steve hurried to confirm as he shook his head, “I’m just… wondering what you’ve gotten Natasha for Christmas?”
All this fucking time?
Brains were simple, right?
“Yeah.”
Five Enhanced Versus four Avengers? Piece of cake. Hopefully.
Steve frowned. “What?”
“You consider laboratory explosions to be an inconvenience?”
Tony stifled a laugh behind his hand at that. Clint threw a pen at him. Steve caught it immediately, before it could land anywhere about Tony’s person, just as everyone had known he would.
Fucking
It was fine.
Steve just huffed. “You’re an asshole.”
It was quiet when Tony woke back up from where he’d drifted off on the couch, and he jerked his head upright in surprise. He hadn’t even realised he’d fallen asleep.
Steve paused, stomach dropping. Oh, shit. They were probably freaking out right about now. Fuck. Well… that was probably not good. “Uh- no. I should… do you have a phone?”
deciding it was going to be quicker to analyse things with his own eyes, Steve grabbed Tony’s body between his hands and searched for an entry wound, looking for tears in his coat, dark patches of blood. He couldn’t see a wound. At least that meant there was nothing imminently serious.
Tony shrugged, running a hand through his wild hair and then winking. “Well where the hell is the fun in that, Steve Rogers?” He asked, before hopping off the ledge, his hands curling around the drainpipe that ran beside Steve’s wall. Steve just watched, coughing out a shocked bark of laughter as he surged forward and stuck his head out of the window whilst Tony scuttled down the wall as if it was the easiest thing in the world.
“By looking up at the sky, thinking- ‘oh, hey, that’s the most famous star in the sky and changing it to something obnoxious would make my boyfriend cry real tears, so I’m just gonna put my credit card away, this once’,” Steve told him firmly.
“Steve, this isn’t some- some
Fury stepped into his office at 8 in the morning, as he did on any other day, and then sat in his chair, as he did on any other day. His coffee was tepid, but he drank it anyway. It’d been a long, frustrating night in SHIELD, and now he was mentally preparing for more of the same. The WSC were on his ass about creating a faster response team to deal with the things that the other branches of public protection couldn’t deal with, but then kept rejecting his proposals for said response teams at every turn. Not to mention the fact that they were still hounding him over the Rogers case, holding it over him like some sort of damned noose. He figured they wouldn’t stop that any time soon. A security breach of that proportion
Tony raised his eyebrows and laughed. “How high is your IQ Doctor Banner? Learn to. I’m not going near the kid until it’s my turn to change the thing, which it is not.”
It stopped about twenty feet away from the edge of the compound, hovering in the air for a moment, bright enough that Steve could hardly even see a thing. He lifted his hand to shield himself from the light, but a moment later it dimmed back, revealed something…
Peter bumped him on the shoulder and he laughed quietly. It was nice to see the tension ease off his face a little.
Ty flailed, grabbing Steve’s throat and squeezing. He barely even felt it, yanking himself out of the grip and then ducking in, using his height to strike a blow straight into Ty’s kidneys. Someone tugged him backward—Ty’s friend, he assumed—and a fist landed in his face, sending his vision spinning. Steve turned to them, ready to hit them too, but then suddenly there was a blur of green jacket and curly brown hair, and the boy went sprawling, one furious Bruce Banner straddling his midsection. Steve saw his friend’s face; teeth bared, such a look of intense rage on his face that Steve almost felt sorry for the guy underneath him. Almost.
Steve shrugged non-committedly. Apparently, that wasn’t as much of a negative response as what Natasha was looking for, because after she’d found her hairband she flicked him over the back of the head. “Steve, parties with those sort of people in them are not good parties. Don’t even bother, honestly.”
Steve looked down warily at the child. “I have no idea. Are there… can we do tests or something? I mean—God, are we supposed to tell social services this? Do they even have a way to deal with this?”
Before Bucky could retaliate, he ducked around him and made his way back into the living room where Tony and Sam were waiting, wandering into the room and catching Tony on the tail-end of what appeared to be a pretty in-depth explanation.
Partly because he didn’t exactly
Tony broke away.
Natasha was quiet, and Steve figured she was probably remembering that day too. Maybe minus the kissing. “Well, guess we just gotta make do with whatever it is we have left,” she said, unsheathing a pistol as the creatures started to scrabble through the energy wall. Steve nodded, and when he caught her eye, there was something knowing in them. “He loved you too, you know,” she said softly, so that no one else could hear it but them, “even afterward. I spoke to him about it once, when I visited. He still loved you, Steve.”
“Eat,” Steve told him, and Tony could admit to himself that he wasn’t feeling particularly hungry, but the resolute look in Steve’s eyes told him that the command wasn’t exactly up for discussion. So he caved and chewed slowly while Steve texted on his phone, to whom, Tony didn’t know. His face was set determinedly, shoulders hunched up as his fingers moved. He made sure to keep his ankle wrapped around Tony’s as they both sat at the table, though, and as soon as Tony was finished eating, he dropped the phone and looked back up with a smile. “Bed?” He asked, voice hopeful.
…Things were getting confusing.
Solving the mystery of perpetual motion. All in a day’s work, really.
Steve was the exception, obviously, because he’d been under some stupid mind control, but the point still stood. And maybe, one day, he’d snap too. For real. Tony could drive even the best men to the worst things, if he put his mind to it, after all.
Bucky was looking at him solemnly when Steve turned his head to face him, and he could feel Peggy nodding along with her own words on his other side. His own face twisted incredulously. “What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”
, and it’s making me begin to regret my decisions. Is the sex really worth the disgusting upbeat attitude next morning?”
“Mr Rogers,” JARVIS’ voice was quiet and soothing, “please take a few deep breaths.”
“Come on then, Steve Rogers,” Tony looked down at him, leaning over to grab two of Steve’s bags and hoist them up, “I want ice cream.”
“Yeah- I need you to come over. Briefly.” Steve frowned when he heard a few clatters in the background and a muffled curse. “I’m having a few technical difficulties and I would appreciate some… assistance.”
“He doesn’t talk about it,” Sam finished sadly, “yeah. I get it. Right. You want me to pass you over to dad? It might be better if I just give him a warning first.”
Again, Tony was quiet, save for his antsy shuffling. Steve watched him worry at his bottom lip and twist his wedding ring around and around his finger, deep in thought. “What do we tell Maria?” He said eventually, “how are we supposed to just… ‘hey sugarplum, Daddy and Pops are going on a trip for a little while, and we might not—we might not make it back, but—”
Tony couldn’t really see the figure. His head was hurting so, so much. But it was blonde and there were blue eyes and his touch felt like home, and he just wanted the person that all of that belonged to to tell him everything was going to be okay. Steve always made things better. It was part of the reason Tony loved him so damn much.
Fuck. He’d definitely overreacted there. Tony wasn’t… he wouldn’t be ashamed of Steve. That just wasn’t the type of person Tony was. Steve knew that; of course he fucking did, and he’d gone and abandoned Tony in the middle of their date anyway. Because he was a selfish asshole like that, obviously.
“Hey!” Steve called, and Bucky’s head turned, looking up at him, “Go fuck yourself, Fuckhead!” He finished, before sticking two fingers up and ducking his head back inside.
“Mmm, nice to see you too,” Steve murmured, looking up at him through his long blond eyelashes, stuck together from the bathwater. “Wanna join me?”
“Are you good?” Bucky asked, hand curled around Steve’s arm.
Michael smiled once more, the expression sticking on his face a moment too long. During that very same moment, Tony came to a rather important conclusion about the two men in front of him, and a dozen tiny details clicked into place to make a big and rather ugly picture. The weird glassy expressions. The slightest stiffness to their movements.
about T-“
“And you’re hot.” Steve hung the towel back on the rack and then opened the door, “don’t be long.”
“Then why are you here?” He asked again, glancing over at the Pepper girl who was still stood outside the door and looking at him with an observant gaze. Because he was polite, he opened the door a little and made a notion with his hand, gesturing her in. She smiled briefly and then stepped inside, her heels clacking on the tile and emphasizing just how much taller than Steve she was.
He couldn’t help but crack a smile at Steve’s analytic face, watching the man observe the situation and clearly attempt to visualise how he was going to go about removing Peter from the tub. Tony left him to work it out while he hurried out of the bathroom and made his way over to the crib they’d rigged up into the corner of the room, plucking the small outfit out of it and then balling it up into his hand. It was covered in little cartoon ducks and, admittedly, incredibly cute to see Peter wearing.
He broke alongside it.
His friends had to have started wondering where he was, by that point. He’d been half an hour, which was ten minutes late. Maybe they’d go out and look for him. Maybe they’d find him in a few hours.
the voice in his head said,
Natasha grunted, not taking her eyes off the screen as she waved at him half-heartedly. "Peter cried for two hours until we turned this on," she said, "then he shut up. This is where we've been for the whole afternoon."
Hit after hit after hit, Tony was crying and he was so afraid, he could feel it settle right under his heart, pure and visceral as he pleaded for Steve to stop, but he didn't, he kept going until everything went blurry and Tony woke up, head lurching off the desk with a painful snap.
“Sharing the power stone?” He tried, curious despite himself, “what do you mean by that?”
Or maybe there had never been any assets at all. Maybe this had always been their plan: lure Steve in, then… then make him one of them.
“I understand, you know,” she told him eventually, “and I believe you if you say that you were provoked, because I know that you wouldn’t just do this for nothing. I’m not trying to be difficult here-“
Bucky called him a creep when he spotted Steve looking, but Steve just flipped him off and called him a voyeur, which seemed to do the trick, because Bucky made a face and then turned away again, muttering under his breath and pulling out his phone to undoubtedly bitch about it to Natasha.
“Rhodey, it’s not his fault,” Carol said, shooting Steve an apologetic look, “I think they were all just stressed out and worried- but I agree that you need to talk to them. That wasn’t right.”
Tony just paused, eyes locking back in on the growing purple mark on the left side of Steve’s nose. His face fell, the memories obviously coming back to him. Steve braced himself for the inevitable deluge of apologies but, at the sight of Steve’s face, Tony seemed to think better of it. Instead, he just traced the mark gently with his finger. “How does it feel?” He asked, guilt evident in his eyes.
The three of them stood slowly, looking at Steve and Bruce as they backed out of the room. Nat stopped at the door, her curls flicking into her face as she turned to look back at the Principal.
Those thoughts only remained on his mind for the first few minutes of arriving. Being the Director of an organisation like SHIELD meant you tended not to be able to dwell on one particular thing at once- not when there would undoubtedly be at least five crises happening at any moment, somewhere in the damn world. He considered briefly about taking a vacation. The Maldives, maybe. Maria had been there once. She had said they were very serene.
one. So no, Tony. Unhumans don’t celebrate Halloween. It’s not designed for us. It’s designed at the expense of us.”
have a life outside of you guys and I didn’t really feel like getting shitfaced on a Thursday evening. Call me crazy.”
known one another they’d been an unstoppable force, and now, with training and knowledge and comradery on their side, they were damn near perfect.
that, I do, and I know that that’s not enough and I understand that you probably still don’t want to be with me any more, but I want you to know—”
He shrugged and turned the TV up a little louder, making a shushing noise over to the corner. Because that was what friends were for, obviously.
“Mmmf,” Steve answered simply, tightening his hand against Tony’s hip and then opening his mouth on Tony’s neck, beginning to spread little kisses into his warm skin. Tony shivered and hummed against his will. “Will the box have you in it?”
Bucky heard it over the line, and actually growled. “Put me on the phone to that guy,
He woke up on a bed that wasn’t his own, and he knew this because there was someone else in it.
Tony tilted his head and then brushed his lips absently over Steve’s temple before picking up his tweezers. A second later and much to his surprise, Steve felt a sudden sting under his brow and he jumped in shock, eyes flying open to spot Tony’s amused face as he held the metal pincers in his left hand, clamped around one of Steve’s hairs. “Sorry,” he said, with a face that spoke of his complete lack of sorrow, “it was annoying me.”
bad, Clint, you really should consider changing your diet. And possibly getting tested for rickets," Steve frowned and backed up, putting his hands behind his back. Tony side-eyed him. He was pretty certain Steve hadn't even touched Peter once. "But if you're the dad, then Peter's your responsibility now. And if he's not- well, you were the one who said we shouldn't call social services."
At least it was a Saturday. Thank the fucking
, he thought, a finger going up to touch his lip-
Steve had done that.
Bucky whispered, and he sounded so sad, Steve looked up to him despite himself. “He’s okay, Stevie. Tony’s okay. Look- Thor’s got him, they’re coming up, right now.”
They looked at each other for a moment, before Dad huffed and dropped his head on to Pops’ shoulder, whilst Pops looked relieved and wound an arm around his waist, shutting his eyes and turning his lips to the crown of Dad’s hair.
"Alright, alright, I was just asking!" Steve sighed and then stood up off the bed, running a hand through his hair. "We should get Bruce."
,” she said like he was stupid, “don’t play dumb, I know that you know who I-“
(Tony had just thought… one day, maybe… but it had been silly. Hadn’t even discussed it with Steve— and sure, the man had confessed he’d dreamed of marriage and kids and a nice family home when he’d been fighting on the front lines, but that was a long time ago. That had been when he’d still had Peggy. And obviously, Tony wasn’t… built for that. Steve knew as much, so he’d dropped the idea. C’est la vie.)
They drove through New York quickly, and soon Steve realised they were heading to the richer side of town the further they went, as the houses got bigger. They turned out from the busy main roads after ten minutes or so, and that was when Steve lost himself completely- just taking in the sights of all the huge houses lined along the roads and wondering where exactly Tony was heading.
They spent a majority of the rest of the day trying to come up with some semblance of a plan.
“Mmmm, you’re one to talk,” Tony answered quietly, head slowly tilting until it was resting against Steve’s shoulder. “Your uniform could never damn stay on in a fight. Always hanging off you like you’d been in a scuffle with a bear.”
“Yeah, we were expecting you at Zeke’s last week, we came all the way down especially!” One of the other girls called, and Steve had to step back as the gaggle of people enveloped Tony from all sides.
She smiled, and then got comfortable on her thin mattress. She was out in less than five minutes.
“Hey, shush, you’re injured, I’m supposed to be looking after you and I haven’t even started yet, come here-“ Tony waved off his words and looked back down at his chest, and Steve stopped talking, but the smile still flickered across his face.
Luckily, Tony’s face was obscured by Steve’s chest, so no one saw the way his cheeks warmed up and his eyes pricked. Family. He’d always thought he was the only one who’d considered the Avengers that way- but here Steve was, saying it was reciprocated. Tony wasn’t used to people caring about him like that. Not even his real family had done that before. This was new, and scary, and-
Tony spun, hands up to fire at them, but then Clint raised his bow and fired a shot off somewhere behind him, and Tony had to turn once more, spotting the next man who came around. This was the fire guy, by the looks of his glowing skin. Tony blocked his path.
Tony was silent by his side, but when Steve shot him a look he was smiling just the same as before; head cocked gently to one side whilst he watched him.
“He once moved an entire classroom onto the roof with a bunch of his friends, you know,” she said casually, twirling her fork through the spaghetti absently as she recalled what had happened. “It was because of his physics teacher. Everyone hated him- he was shit at his job and took it out on all of us. But yeah- I can’t remember the story very well- something about the teacher giving the whole class an hour’s detention for nothing and saying-“
‘together’
It was messy. It was home. Steve smiled fondly around the room and wound his ankle around Tony’s absently as he tucked into his dinner enthusiastically, and felt Tony’s eyes fall on his profile a second later, the corner of a warm smile catching on Steve’s periphery. He turned, watching Tony’s mouth continue to move as he squabbled over something utterly mundane with Clint while his eyes fixed themselves to Steve over Clint’s head. They shared a smile, and Steve thought absently,
“Is she okay?” Steve stumbled to his knees and took Natasha in. She was bleeding from her head and her arm was bent funnily. For a second, there was only the terror of a negative answer.
Steve slid his knee between Tony’s open legs and pressed gently down on his crotch, and yeah, okay, wow, that shut him up pretty fast. Tony swallowed and looked down at his bastard of a husband- but the other man’s eyes were already fucking closed. He quite clearly was not intending to
Of course, after that little outburst in the kitchen, Tony knew it wasn’t long before someone- most likely Steve- called him out and asked him about it. But that didn’t mean he couldn’t drag it out a little bit, and what better way than to scurry right back to his workshop and find more things to work on? It wasn’t like he was short of them, what with being a CEO and a superhero and all.
Oh God, that was true. So many things to think about that Tony had never even considered. This... this was definitely not what he'd been wanting to spend his brain-power on tonight, that was for sure. He looked around the now-empty common room, hoping for an answer. "Uh, we could shove the couch right up to the bedside and then put him on that? That way he won't accidentally roll off."
“Tony?” Steve called out from the other room, voice starting small but becoming decidedly panicked the next time around. “Tony? Tony, come here, I don’t… Tony!”
“Tony!” Steve cried out. “Tony!” He checked the living room, under the couches, even—terrified of what he might find—out of the windows. He could hear the rest of the team searching for Tony, just as frantic as he was, but he couldn’t register the noise.
“Can’t.” Suck. “Have.” Nibble. “That.” Lick.
Hope you guys enjoyed this chapter!
Sensing something in front of him, Tony opened his eyes. When Tony saw the red, white, and blue toy held by the man wearing the same red, white, and blue uniform, he ceased his crying and stretched out his arm.
They were in Steve’s guest room where the third transition was to happen. Tony, lying against the large pillows and freshly showered, looked unnervingly little in the large bed.
Steve frowned. He couldn’t just leave Tony alone, but those aliens were attacking civilians, “Who’s the closest person around that’s not an Avenger?”
“Geez, Nat, are you made out of steel or something? How much do you weigh?”
If only it
“Nuh-uh. I’m not done with you yet.” Steve moved Tony’s arm so it could join the other in wrapping around Steve’s neck. “Have some patience, sweetheart.” Steve whispered before capturing Tony’s lips with his own.
In his mind Steve could see Tony before his surgery—the one that removed the arc reactor from his chest—and imagined the horror he must have felt when he woke up and realized a foreign object was inserted inside his body, exposed where anyone could reach in and yank it. Fear. Confusion. Anger. He could imagine the panicking breaths that assaulted him, worsening when he could feel his skin and muscles contract against the thing that was keeping him alive. The wires hanging from his chest like visible nerves.
He was twenty feet away.
“Sorry, Josh. He’s just excited,” Steve smiled and the scientist widened his eyes, probably in disbelief that Steve remembered his name. “Calm down, Tony. You said you would behave, right?”
As they sat around the dining table, plates full of beef covered in gravy, noodles, and roasted vegetable, Steve couldn’t help the warm feeling that was radiating throughout his body. Natasha and Clint were telling the group about their mission and having a silly argument—something about how Natasha wouldn’t have had to blow up a car if Clint ran faster—with Bruce injecting sarcastic and witty comments in-between. Tony was teasing Dum-E with a carrot stabbed on his fork, only to chew on it moments later when the robot reached out to get it.
Tony nodded quickly.
“And speak of the devil.” Clint’s voice held amusement as he yelled, “Aren’t you supposed to be skating with Nat?”
Tony’s fingers stopped their movements and his eyes widened. “What?”
superglued,” Clint said with a grin before turning around to toss the used colander and spatula into the sink. The resounding clang had Natasha glaring daggers at him.
“Just a little longer,” Bruce said as he carefully removed the needle from Tony’s arm. He quickly placed gauze and a bandage over the small wound. “Done!” He yelled out in elated exasperation.
Tony let out a long sigh. He really hoped for a more visceral reaction, though.
“You’re not going to leave me, right?” Tony whispered. Oh gods, no. When he thought Tony was in danger earlier, he felt like his heart froze over. Purposely leaving Tony? Steve had no doubt that he wouldn’t be able to do that. Ever.
“And arrows,” Jarvis replied.
*****
Steve reached the still standing armor first, an anxious expression on him that quickly transformed to confusion when he heard a whimper from within the armor.
Natasha started ripping open the pastel boxes on the counter, “Help me find a toy, or a pacifier. Anything!”
“Yeah, great start to the day,” Steve heard Bruce mumble as he dabbed at his shirt.
Steve took his eyes off the little robot, “What? Of course not! Why would I be mad?”
Steve frowned even harder, “Nat, is Clint teaching Tony how to shoot deadly—“
“That shouldn’t be too hard. Tony’s been good with everything else, so far.”
“Aw, okay,” Tony pouted and placed the sketchbook down on the coffee table. He then grabbed Steve’s hand and led him to the bathroom.
to know what’s in that thing?” Clint asked.
“Perfect. Your ass bouncing every time I fuck you, your hole stretching around me, like you don’t want my cock to leave,” Steve growled out, hands kneading Tony’s ass. “Love this view, you’re so beautiful.”
Using Natasha’s kick to his advantage, Steve grabbed her leg and tossed her at Clint.
“I know. That’s why I’ll need to take a blood sample before I can do more.” Bruce said and slowly pulled out a white package from the inside of his coat. He gave Steve a look, lips pursed and eyes wide and glanced at Tony, who noticed the new package object and was scrutinizing it from Steve’s lap.
Really, how could Steve refuse that face?
“Nu uh.” Steve said as he twisted the plate away from Thor. “These are for Tony.”
“Yes, please,” Steve said through a mouthful of foam.
As if he just woke up from a day dream, Tony shook his head and looked around in confusion, before spotting the ingredients on the table.
“Sorry I yelled today. And knocked the eggs. And locked the door. And-“ Tony began mumbling against Steve’s chest, but was cut off by the man’s laugh.
Steve looked down at Tony, who was waving his Captain America toy around, oblivious to how concerned the two men in the room were for him.
“Focus, you two. And that is a
A distraction. That means Nat was close and had just been given enough time to find a safer spot. But who would Tony be with? Natasha, who moved swift and silent and could camouflage herself to near obscurity? Or Clint, who was capable of finding the most creative places to hide and would probably sense him coming a mile away?
needed one.
The elevator slid open on the communal floor, revealing a sight that had even Natasha gasping.
While hiding the box kept it out of sight, its presence was always in the back of Tony’s head. Tony and Steve had spent the first three days swimming, tanning, eating, and exploring. They found a waterfall, swam with turtles, went zip lining, and even did a couple’s bungee jump because Steve gave him puppy eyes. He enjoyed it though, mostly because of Steve’s muscular arms wrapping tight around him and nowhere felt as safe as within Captain America’s arms. Every once in a while, when Steve would say something that Tony would call cheesy but not so secretly loved, or when Steve would give him that look before kissing him, Tony had the urge to do something
. “I made him food. Give it to him when he comes out. He tends to take a nap at eleven. If it’s noon and we’re not back, give him the yogurt and blueberries in the fridge for his snack. There are juice boxes in the fridge as well but let him poke the straw through and only let him have one. If we’re somehow not back by six, there are meals in the freezer.” At Fury’s deadpan look, Steve added,”And takeout menus on the counter.”
Tony’s eyes were dazed and glassy, narrow slits framed by eyelashes clumped from tears of pleasure. He was moaning low and seemingly never-ending—his voice husky and uneven. The neck next to his face was littered in red love bites, as was the shoulder he was resting his head on. The back he was gripping onto had red lines running up and down, left to right.
Bruce held up the two small vails of blood with a slightly sheepish look, “My fault this time.”
A long beep signaled the end of their game, and twin groans could be heard echoing in the gym.
He dug his heels in the back of Steve’s thighs as an urge for more.
“Blueberry pancakes!”
*****
Steve swore the smile on Tony’s face was like the sun.
Nick Fury was not looking happy.
Steve couldn’t help but laugh as he got closer to get a better look. “It looks great, Tony. The colors are spot on,” Steve said and gently ruffled Tony’s hair. “Dinner is almost ready. Let’s go wash your hands and face.”
Steve couldn’t stop at just one photo—Tony looked too happy and Steve wanted to engrave this moment into something physical. By the end of their impromptu photo shoot, Steve had thirty wonderful photos.
Steve looked around as he walked to the center of the floor. Scattered on top of piles of paper at a desk were five mugs, previously containing coffee no doubt; a gauntlet sat on a worktable with a blowtorch and a welding mask next to it. Steve could practically picture Tony hunched over the table, sparks flying in twenty different directions as he created the hand for his armor.
Steve pulled Tony into his arms, wrapped him tight within them like a security blanket, and let the little boy cry.
Something was wrong.
Steve’s face was flushed a healthy pink, his biceps bulging as he lifted and slammed Tony up and down his cock in an superhuman speed—finding that this way was easier than holding Tony against the wall.
“Well, I’m going to make some breakfast and then head to the gym. You up for some sparring?”
“Cash now and I’ll do it.”
Wandering around, ten minutes had passed before Steve saw little footprints imprinted in the grass. Steve couldn’t help but smile. Clint and Nat were too well trained to be leaving marks like these, but Tony obviously wasn’t. Following the little trail, which had disappeared in front of a tree, Steve bent as low as he could before jumping up and grabbing a sturdy branch. Hauling himself up and steadying himself, Steve was able to get a wide view of the surrounding area.
“Let’s make breakfast, Steve!” Tony said before sliding off the bed and running out the bedroom door. Steve could only stare blankly at the indent in the sheets where Tony disappeared from, his mind still not fully awake, before kicking the blanket off his legs and heading out as well.
“I’m not letting you take Tony.” In his arms was said toddler, face still sticky from the slime even though Steve cleaned him up as best as he could with a wet cloth. Tony was wrapped up in a white towel, his legs fidgeting and arms stuck out from a tiny gap.
And Tony felt warm despite the freezing water that ran down his back.
Tony turned his head, smiling at the computer as he wiped his face. His eyes were red, face even blotchier now. “Where I go, you go, bud. I’m not leaving you behind. Ever.”
