He’s sitting in a dark corner of the room. He breathes quietly but it sounds labored, as though he has to think about it to keep on doing it.
I’m grateful for the nights when they leave me alone. I huddle up on my wicker mat and close my eyes, trying to shut everything else out. The squelching noises of fucking, the muffled cries for help, the desperate attempts at refusing, the well-placed punch to the gut, and then, occasionally, the dull gurgle of blood filling a mouth, the echo of a severed limb hitting the floor, the sharp intake of breath as a blade enters the lung. The screams. The chronic coughing of those pretending to sleep. It’s from the stone dust.
“It’s… God, Tony, the way you feel around me is…” Steve closes his eyes, lost and falling into something that can’t be Tony. “You’ve no idea how much I need you… How much I—” Steve trails off when he becomes distracted by something only he can see across the skin of Tony’s chest. He stares at it, rapt, moves a hand to touch the scarred area but he stops at the last moment. He looks at Tony and must read consent on his face, because Tony doesn’t say anything, but he wants Steve to touch him, and Steve touches him. Still, Tony gasps when Steve’s fingertips land on him, the tender, insensitive skin there made all the more receptive by Tony’s imagination—what Steve feels like, on him, inside him, what he’d feel like in his head.
“I didn’t know you had curls,” Steve replies, with the tone of someone who didn’t want those words to get past their lips at all.
Steve locks his feet around Tony’s back, pushes him deeper still. Tony braces himself with one hand on the carpet and one holding Steve’s wrist, and then he’s not afraid anymore.
Steve wraps him up in a towel and leaves him in the bathroom, where Tony combs his hair and rubs his face cream into his skin. He hangs the towel on its hook.
To keep his mind and hands occupied, Steve starts packing and straightening up the bedroom, so they won’t have to do it in a rush later. He doesn’t have many things, and he’s been his usual tidy self during their stay here, so his stuff isn’t scattered all around like Tony’s. Still, he separates his things from Tony’s, folds some of Tony’s clothes that still look and smell clean, lines up his canvas shoes against the wall.
Steve wanted to help him bear this duty, more than anything, but he betrayed Tony’s trust, and now he barely knows where to start to fix this mess that never would’ve happened in the first place if they only had time to sit down and talk, for real, and be kind and open, and tell each other the truth.
He distractedly thinks that he’d like for Steve to come closer. Maybe brace one hand against the door, next to Tony’s head. Steve would smirk, and then blush a little. Tony would lift his face towards him, slowly, and—
“Maybe it wouldn’t be as beautiful, if it hadn’t gone through all that,” Steve says. “It wouldn’t be so unique.”
It takes a while, and Tony’s erection comes and goes a couple of times. But in the end, Tony wins this strange battle against Steve’s muscles: he finds himself on top of Steve, carefully pushing into him while Steve lies on his back, stares at the ceiling, and possibly puts dents in the headboard with the way he’s clutching at it.
“I wanna eat fiorentina,” Steve says while Tony is walking a couple of steps ahead of him, clearly with a destination in mind.
He comes up to break the surface of the river, and sees Tony in the distance. He hears him mutter a soft
Sometimes he really says things that makes you think he left the ‘40s just yesterday. And maybe sometimes he feels like he has.
Tony walks into a bar in Barcelona a couple of hours later. He’s barefoot, and still in his pajamas.
“There are, you know. Pills… They didn’t hurt her,” he hurries to add after the face Steve makes. “They’re safe, I promise. She’s fine.”
Tony stops at a gas station, fills up the tank. Steve stays in the car, still as his own statue in Brooklyn.
“I can’t. I—” Steve feels like crying again and he doesn’t want to cry, he’s not supposed to cry anymore, Tony has forgiven him, he loves him, everything is—
And for a moment, oh, for a moment everything is just perfect. There’s a warm sun shining in Tony’s mind, and the whole world feels just right.
It’s been a tough couple of years, but they’ve made it to the other side. To the other side of the war, the other side of the destruction, the damage, the death, the two months Steve spent in the hospital that felt like twenty years to Tony.
“Goddammit,” Tony sounds exhausted. It’s Steve that does that to him. That drains all his energy away, that consumes his soul piece by piece.
Tony starts caressing his face, then places little kisses all over it. He travels down Steve’s neck, kisses behind his ear, licks at the hollow of his throat. He makes Steve touch him, too, guiding his big hands to take off his t-shirt, and he slowly gains confidence, stroking Tony’s back and his stomach, kissing the scarred skin around the reactor, rubbing the pads of his fingers over Tony’s nipple.
“You can barely sit. Wait for a little while, okay? You wanna eat something? I can fix us a couple sandwiches.”
Tony uses wet wipes to clean up as much as the situation allows. He dresses—sweatpants, a blue sweater. Boots. He turns to Steve.
He doesn’t want to think about how his heart broke that day, with that single word that he knew would come out of Steve’s mouth even before he asked the question, with Barnes standing in a corner and looking at the floor and waiting, just
Okay, okay. Steve tries to remain calm and be confident that he can contain the second disaster of the day. Possibly—ideally—without Tony noticing. Pretending to straighten his sweater, Steve covers his crotch with it, even though his jeans already hide most of his, uh, problem.
Soon, Steve tries for a third finger. It doesn’t work at the beginning, so he adds lube. It eases the way in, but it’s a long time before Steve can start fucking in and out of him again.
Steve takes his time fingering Tony, slowly, but he knows what he’s doing now and there’s no hesitation in his movements, pushes deep and deep and deep as far as he can go, as far as Tony can take it. There are tears in Tony’s eyes, and Steve pulls him in, hugs him even tighter with his free arm.
When it’s over, they need to work on the bond again. The rut, the heat, the hormones, they messed it all up. The equilibrium they reached the very first night, when they nurtured it for the first time in a decade, has been disrupted.
But still, when it happens… when he wakes up hard, Steve never touches himself. He wills his erection away quickly, the self-loathing that the whole experience infuses him with makes it easy.
Maybe someday he will. If he doesn’t die first, that is, then maybe in ten, twenty years, who knows, he’ll wake up and not think about how much he misses Tony. But it’s not going to happen sooner than that. Steve knows it perfectly well, because he knows himself that much.
They move to the living room, Stella taking the couch with the cats, and Steve and Tony occupying one armchair each.
They enter the guest house, and Tony closes the door and leans back against it, his hands behind his back. Steve turns once he realizes Tony isn’t following him to the bedroom, and walks back a few steps. He’s very tall, but Tony doesn’t feel intimidated. He doesn’t feel scared.
The view from the top is great, but it’s the attitude that fascinates Steve the most, the fact that people decided to keep this thing, even if it wasn’t complete, even if it didn’t serve any purpose at all like this. They had built it, so they left it there, so Steve could stand on it now, centuries later. With Tony, who tries to pretend he isn’t out of breath with the effort of climbing up the stairs. Steve, for his part, pretends not to be worried sick by this, and walks in front of Tony when they go down.
And at the end of it all, while Tony lies in bed with Steve, Sarah curled up between them smelling of love instead of heartbreak, he gets what Steve meant.
Yeah. He’s too tired to point Steve’s attention to it and make a joke, but Tony’s joy must reach Steve through the bond anyway, if his warm chuckle is anything to go by.
There are hands on his face, big warm hands, and a body kneeled in front of him and the scent of roses that floods his mouth with blue.
For two hours because Steve is a super soldier who has super ruts and super knots that last two fucking hours.
“Daa,” she says, while Steve scrambles to his feet and almost trips over Maria’s toys strewn all over the carpet.
“My mother was born here, you know. She inherited the house and decided to turn it into a hotel.” Tony smiles to himself. “She was such a practical person. She always saw the potential of things.”
“Tony, you don’t have to tell me. Really. But I mean it... If you need help, I’m here. It’s just that without knowing what’s wrong... But you know best, I’m sure.”
I have to. I was hoping I could avoid going into town this morning but... I'll get us some chicken at the market for lunch, what do you say? Two, okay? One for Steve. Will that be enough?
“It’s called stress cardiomyopathy, or broken heart syndrome. Happens after traumatic events. Bad news, it felt like a fucking heart attack. Good news, it wasn’t.”
“It is! It’s so gross that you wouldn’t wish it on your worst enemy! Go downstairs, okay? Uncle Rhodey is reading very important stuff in the living room, he’d love to be disturbed.”
But this one time, right before the mission to retrieve Loki’s scepter from the HYDRA base in Sokovia, Steve came down to the workshop to ask Tony something about their equipment, and he caught Tony talking to JARVIS while looking up at the ceiling. They laughed about it for half an hour, and it wasn’t even that funny.
A drop of come drips off Tony’s jaw and onto the glass of the arc reactor. Steve looks at it, looks at Tony. Tony nods. Steve licks it off, slowly, careful not to put too much pressure on the glass even if he’s pretty sure it doesn’t make a big difference, and he knows that Tony can’t really feel it.
Tony seizes every occasion to tease him with his jokes, with his feigned carelessness, with the obvious proof of his superior intellect. He pretends to be the more reckless, irreverent, irresponsible version of Howard, but he never pretends to be less intelligent. Tony wears many masks, but never the one of the stupid.
The drive to Bagno Vignoni isn’t long, and they’re both quiet in the car. They leave it in a small parking lot hidden between the trees when they arrive, and walk side by side towards the centre of the small town.
There’s a long pause. Natasha seems to be thinking about what to say next, but she’s displeased about it.
It’s not like Steve is forcing him, obviously. When Tony really can’t, really doesn’t have time, really doesn’t want to, Steve backs off. But it’s still sex at least twice a day most days. Tony feels weak in his legs. He feels like he’s happy all the time. Which is weird. And when for one reason or another they can’t have all the sex they’re used to having, Tony becomes kind of nervous, and a bit more of an asshole than he feels comfortable being.
Tony kisses back, holds onto Steve as if he might run away, licks into his mouth like it’s the cure for every illness and Tony is the most sick man in the world.
It’s a good routine. They’re getting used to each other’s bodies, they’re getting more confident in their respective knowledge of what the other likes. It’s easy and straightforward, serves the purpose of making them connect physically and helps Tony with his erections.
Tony is stripping. He took off the sling and now he’s carefully using both arms to undress, in front of Steve, on the river shore, leaving his clothes on a rock, setting his shoes on another.
The words come out of his mouth before he can stop, before he even realizes he’s saying them. “I’m sorry about the other night.”
“She would say I was her star,” Stella says, getting up from her chair and taking something from a drawer, “she said I burned so bright for her that I was her sun.”
, the black silicone against his flushed skin, seeing it poke out of Steve’s mouth, it makes him harder than he can be on his own. And he can get hard on his own again, without much coaxing, even while Steve’s inside him from time to time, which is really amazing.
He imagines Tony’s serious face listening to his words. He imagines him nodding, brushing a hand over his mouth, immersed deep in thought. He imagines his resolute gaze at the end of Steve’s perfect little declaration of intent. He’d say, “Welcome home, Cap,” and maybe he would even hug him. Friendly, warm. Nice, like Tony is with so many people.
“I know. I was taking pills. I didn’t want to keep it from him, but I… I didn’t want him to go through that pain, in case I couldn’t… I was forty-six, I mean, why would he even want me at all is beyond me, or have a kid—”
It feels like a prison, Steve’s body—he’s so tight. But the slide, once Tony starts moving, it’s so sweet. Steve is warm and soft, he feels like sunshine on Tony’s skin.
There’s a long moment of silence. Steve holds his breath, waits for Tony’s reaction. Maybe it was a mistake. God, Steve is so stupid and—
Steve doesn’t exactly look happy, but he seems to be serene, more than earlier. He stares at the walls, the stones, the old well in the middle of the piazza, the little baptismal font inside the tiny church, the inscription with the verses of Dante’s
I discovered a beautiful song the other day, it's already a couple of years old and I don't know how we never talked about it. It's by Mia Martini, the title is
) time together and they’ve just finished a sparring session that didn’t end with them covered in each other’s come, if only because Matt and Jess were also there as far as Steve is concerned. After everyone leaves, Steve goes to take a quick shower, but he lingers under the hot spray of the water, lets his muscles relax, and it still feels impossible that he
, extremely handsome Omega, taking up the incredibly smart initiative to kiss an Alpha that grew up pre-World War II and is regarded as the ultimate moral paradigm by large parts of the Western world. Fantastic idea, Tony. Congrats.
Steve squeezes the muscle on the side of Tony’s thigh, burrows his nose into Tony’s pubic hair, and Tony comes.
But he can’t. At the last moment, he can’t. He doesn’t know why; he has no pity for this man. But maybe he still has some for himself. Maybe he’s just scared of what else he could justify doing if he allows himself this.
“No, Tony, I… I’ve never been happier than right now. You… you needed your time. I get why you did it. You needed to be sure. I appreciate that. You didn’t want to rush into things, and that means this was important to you. I’m glad.”
The pain is unbearable. Worse than having a piece of metal shoved into your chest; worse than the serum changing you from the inside out.
“Scared, but you know how stoic she is. She put on her brave face and let everyone do their jobs. Not even Pepper could get her to put down her She-Hulk plushie for a single second, but she’s okay. We searched for you, but the trail went cold around Wainscott.”
Steve clasps a hand against Tony’s mouth. He can’t make a sound, and he doesn’t know what Steve is up to, but he’s not scared. Steve’s end of the bond is cool and determined, with nothing threatening for Tony.
There’s a French window at the end of the corridor. It opens into a backyard populated by more plants and trees, and a wooden table with chairs, for dining outside.
They lie there for a while, sharing more kisses with their mouths and their minds, trading love across the bond.
Steve keeps looking at him while he places a pan with some oil on the stove. A clove of garlic is next, and Tony takes it out and throws it away after a while.
The two times they had sex during the three weeks they have been dating, Steve could feel that Tony wasn’t very hard. That it took him some time to come. But he didn’t think much of it right after it happened, because they had been busy with work. Maybe Tony was just tired.
Steve pulls away and rubs Tony’s lips with his fingers, caresses his chin and his neck. Steve’s hand brushes over Tony’s chest then, over his soft belly that never quite went back to being toned after he had Sarah. Finally, Steve’s hand curls around Tony’s erection, hanging hard and painful between his thighs.
“Come on,” he says leaning forward and wetting his lips, and he doesn’t need to explain. Tony parts his lips and a drop of Steve’s come trickles down his chin. Tony lets Steve plunge into his mouth, lick and suck away his own come, and more of it spills down but it doesn’t matter now. It doesn’t matter.
“That’s not true. But we can learn how to figure things out when it happens. We’ve done it a few times already this past week. You won’t make me believe that doesn’t mean anything to you.”
He doesn’t even get to finish. Steve lowers the upper part of his body on the bed, arms to his sides, a cheek pressed against the mattress, ass in the air. Tony feels himself slip even further into him with the new position.
“I volunteered as a test subject for a high-risk experimental procedure to enhance my body, so who am I to judge? I mean, sure, it’s a bit creepy, but if you actually manage to do it, it’d be—”
He’s sitting under a tree in the middle of the woods, one of the roots digging sort of painfully into his butt, a ladybug crawling over the back of his hand.
Steve inhales, deep, holds the air in his lungs until he can almost taste the dust, the time, the history of this place. He closes his eyes and can almost hear every word that was ever said with these stones as witnesses, can feel the presence of anyone that has ever stood here at any point in history, exactly here where he is standing right now.
“I had fun the other night,” he says then, quietly, tone neutral, and maybe just to fill the silence that Tony was ignoring for the sake of his meaningless introspection. Steve smiles, but Tony can see it tastes regretful, even bitter. “Now you seem to be slipping away from me. If I did something that offended you or—”
Steve passes understanding through the bond, but Tony feels his regret too, his guilt. But there’s also hope. Steve has so much hope; he’s made of it.
Steve stops thrusting and strokes Tony’s dick again, and it doesn’t take much for him to come, with a pained sob that struggles to come out and just dies in his throat.
Tony watches him fall, horror and something else, something that Tony has already seen there more than once, clouding Steve’s eyes before he can’t help but closing them.
on the black and white display, and feel his heart rate go back to normal while he counts every single pixel it takes to spell out that name.
If the crowd loves me, they’ll be even more thirsty for my blood. The most loved gladiators get brutally executed, and the screams of agony are drowned by the screams of joy and excitement. The people adore seeing their favorite warriors go to the slaughter. It’s enough to put every dream of glory or freedom in perspective.
He wonders how Tony feels about the song, which seems to have been written for him. But that could be just Steve, so stupid with love that every song is about Tony to him.
“You’re not afraid of me, of calling me out on my bullshit. The whole Captain America thing, you respect it, but you don’t let it stop you from telling me what you really think. I think we’re both stubborn, but about different things. I think that in many ways we’re opposites, but I also think that at our core we’re not that different. We fight for the same things. We believe in the same things. And maybe we have different methods, maybe we see the world in different ways, but if we trust each other... then we can turn these differences into our strengths, instead of our weaknesses. And if we do, no alien threat stands a chance against us.”
There’s been tension for months. Not the kind of tension they experienced on the helicarrier that first day, a different type. After New York they started talking, started agreeing, or at least disagreeing in a productive way; there were lingering touches and lingering gazes, soft smiles and whispered tactics, murmured ideas.
On the other side of the bond—but it’s not really a side anymore, it’s all so confusing—there are Steve’s thoughts, mirroring Tony’s in many aspects, but without making an exact copy. Steve is more forgiving of himself, of his own reasons. He’s made some sort of peace with having been forced into an awful situation all those years ago, with having kept a secret out of fear, and he doesn’t hate himself for it, not anymore, at least, but the regret still burns deep into every recess of his mind.
Tony nods, almost imperceptibly, as if that would make it less of an admission. “I knew I had to do something since the moment I flew into that damn portal, but
Steve loves watching Tony create things. He loves seeing him in ragged jeans and an old tank top, arc reactor poking out, glasses perched on his nose, streaks of motor oil all over him, his shoulders hunched low, concentrating hard on a piece of armor, on one of Clint and Kate’s exploding arrows, on a prototype for a machine that can and will redefine the medical field. But he loves it even more when Tony is like this: inventing, discovering, imagining things and ways to make them real. It’s beautiful, it’s breathtaking, it’s— hot as hell.
“I’m sad you have to go so soon,” Stella says, “I’ll miss having you boys around. I didn’t even get a chance to make you try my ragù.”
Steve taps at the keypad in the glass. Nothing seems to happen, but Steve draws to the side, making room for Tony.
Steve’s thumb is drawing small circles over Tony’s cheek. He must love feeling himself through the stretched out skin of Tony’s face, especially around the knot.
And after all this talking and agreeing and deciding, Tony asks, “Wanna make me do some dick exercises, soldier?” and Steve says, “Go get naked, Avenger. I’ll get the cock cage.” And that’s how Tony ends up kneeling on his heels on their bed, cage snapped on, two of Steve’s fingers fucking into him relentlessly, brushing at his prostate over and over and over again, and Tony is going crazy, he’s completely losing it; he can’t think anymore, there’s nothing he can focus on except what Steve is making him feel right now, and just
He resumes licking into Tony, less careful now, bolder. He runs his tongue all around the ridged muscles just past the entrance, where Steve’s knot fits.
He breathes until he can open his eyes again and speak, but he has to stifle down the pleased warmth unfolding in his stomach at hearing Tony so upset about him. Tony still cares about him. He doesn’t love him anymore, hasn’t in years, but—
“Oh...” Steve says, looking at Maria, tone quiet and full of awe. “Would you look at that.” He sounds out of breath.
“I don’t know how I survived all these years without you,” Steve continues. Only Sarah kept them sane, really.
Steve is still nowhere to be seen. Tony misses him. He wants him close, wants to hold his hand and make sure he’s alright. He hopes Steve’s alright.
His lips are so chapped that they bleed. He looks at the red stain left on his pillow and he wonders if there’s anything else inside him, anything else except blood, vomit, shit, and piss.
“I love you,” he says, and Tony gives him a hesitant, abortive smile, defeat still evident in his eyes, now full of tears.
He tries to breathe, but he can’t; his lungs are burning, his throat, his eyes, that stretch of skin between his legs. He gets up slowly, chances a last glance at Tony’s body—a silent apology, a quiet confession, as if saying
When he sees Tony, his pupils dilate, and his gaze travels from Tony’s shoulders to his narrow hips, to his naked forearms, and then up again to the exposed hollow of his throat.
Steve takes his ruined henley and throws it in the trash after a minute of silent debate with himself, then puts on another one. He tucks it into his waistband so it doesn’t ride up while he sleeps. Tony thinks he looks kinda silly like that, but also cozy, comfortable. A bit old-fashioned.
They walk around the town while they eat, and Tony seems to be in a better mood than before, but he also kind of looks distracted, like there’s something else occupying his mind.
He texts Rhodey, but doesn’t get an answer for half an hour or so. Anxiety starts creeping back into his mind. Is he okay, did everything go alright, is something wrong, did Tony miss anything? But his phone buzzes in his hand.
Tony props himself up with a hand on the mattress, twists his hips and turns to look down at Steve, says, “I’m hard, Steve, I’m—”
“At all. But I need your consent, Steve. I know you’re not feeling well right now but I need you to say that you want this and I need to feel that you mean it.”
“I’m an asshole. That’s old news. I’m sorry. I’m not mocking you. I swear. It’s the bullshit that comes out of my mouth.”
“There are solutions to that, Tony, don’t tell me you haven’t already thought of them. I know it’s hard, but—”
Steve squeezes his eyes shut, his heart is hammering in his chest. He can’t breathe. He shakes his head.
It takes more than Tony was expecting, but he forgets all about it when he fucks Steve with his tongue and listens to him scream his name, tugging on Tony’s hair and shuddering as he comes.
Steve’s eagerness quiets Tony’s mind, but his voice is still unsteady when he asks, “How do you mean, for real?”
No, no. There was no respect. For the man, Tony was just a thing. A hole to be used and thrown away. Not a person. Not someone. A doll. A thing. A warm, hollow body to fill up with his violence. Something you—
Natasha makes him roll over, and the air hits his skin, bringing him more pain. She makes him sit up and places a glass between his lips. He drinks some of the water and the contrast with the cold liquid makes him realize just how warm he is. Natasha places something cold on his forehead, and he opens his eyes.
Steve jerks himself off and Tony watches him, and his come is warm against Tony’s skin. He bends down for a kiss and he’s still panting against Tony’s mouth when he swallows to catch his breath and says, “Tonight?”
filling Steve’s nostrils, the taste of his come flooding Steve’s mouth, Tony’s shout echoing through the empty workshop.
Steve would lock his gaze with Tony’s in the mirror and Tony would stare back with no shame. It wouldn’t be difficult, it wouldn’t make Tony feel self-conscious and exposed. In Tony’s mind, holding Steve’s gaze would be the easiest thing.
Tony takes his StarkPad and opens the Kindle app to read the same thing for possibly the tenth time.
Tony shrugs and looks down at the carpet, Steve walks up to him, crouches down in front of him. Slowly, like Tony might break, like Steve’s heart might break, he places a hand on Tony’s knee. When Tony does nothing, Steve kneels between Tony’s legs, rests his cheek on the inner muscle of Tony’s thigh. Tony lifts his hand, uncertain, lets it hover in the air for a moment, then buries his fingers in Steve’s hair, kneads his scalp.
, the way it feels to have an open bond inside your head... To have someone understand everything you feel, bit by excruciating bit. But what surprises Tony now is having Steve look at that side of his mind that he always kept hidden. He can already predict Steve recoiling in horror, making up an excuse to leave, asking him to break the bond.
Steve wipes Tony’s face with a handkerchief and kisses him, biting his bottom lip in the process, and he tastes like freedom, and Tony swears it’s not a joke about America.
He listens to Tony’s breathing, the muffled beat of Tony’s heart under his hand, his own heart matching every
“Barnes is out of surgery,” Tony says, quietly, after a few minutes. “Sedating him to attach the arm proved to be quite the challenge. Predictably. They wanted to call it off, but he said he could take it. He’s in a lot of pain right now.”
for him, because he can’t say it, not right now and not like this. “And then I… inside of you. And it felt, it felt, it… The way it felt…” He touches his forehead with his fingers, lost. “And I almost said it. That I love you.”
Steve’s breath hitches, his chest shaken by a horrible convulsion. He covers his face with his hands, and Tony spares a moment to mourn the loss of Steve’s skin on his.
No part of him is missing after the upheaval. After the revelation, Steve feels as though all the little pieces of himself have been scattered around, messed up; he feels as if he’s wearing his own skin inside out. But every part of him is accounted for, in a way that wasn’t true half an hour ago, when he still thought Tony was—
Tony turns and sees him sitting up on the bed, squinting in the darkness, the blanket bunching up in his lap. His mouth is slightly open, and his breath gets caught in his chest with a horrible sound.
He thinks about how he always comes across as too eager, too enthusiastic, it’s too much, and why do you care so much about this, Tony? No one else does. What, you feel so alone that you need to fund an entire team of superheroes so you can pretend you have friends? As if any of these people would actually like
At some point, they even manage to change the sheets and take an actual shower. Tony is pretty impressed with it.
“Yeah. We were in that HYDRA base in Sokovia. Your shield was broken, and you were dying, and I touched you to check your pulse, and, and you said... you said—”
He looks at the time, but he hasn’t been gone for long. He doesn’t really feel like running, so he fishes out his sketchbook and his black marker from his pocket, and draws for a while.
Tony is silent for a very long time, until Steve just wants him to say something, anything, but not leave him like this.
Tony melts into him, between his arms. Touching him is familiar and new at the same time, and so strange. The point of contact sparks with electricity, with excitement, with every emotion Steve has ever felt for Tony. He’s spent days, months, trying to remind himself that this was never going to happen again. Because Tony was gone. And now, now. Look at them now.
They rest in the park for a while after lunch, while Steve draws and Tony talks about everything and anything that crosses his mind: new projects, old and half-forgotten ideas he could implement in a different way, this paper he read recently, how he figured out that one issue with the armor that he mentioned to Steve before everything went to absolute shit. Steve seems to barely listen to him, but then he asks a couple of pointed questions, proving he’s actually paying close attention to Tony’s chatter.
“‘It’s way overpriced,’ said the billionaire who could literally buy all the restaurants in the city with the spare change in his pocket.”
The door is closed so Steve rings the bell. She greets them, cheerful and sincere, and Tony hugs her tight, glad that after all he does get to see her again.
“Tony? Hey. It’s Steve. You’re safe. You’re in my bedroom, we are in Avengers tower. Everything is fine, you’re not in any danger. Tony?”
He’s thought of calling him so many times. Of just getting his head out of his ass and calling him. He never has.
Steve managed to undress. He’s naked now, lying stomach down on Tony’s bed, trying to breathe in the scent he left on his pillow, and fucking into his hand and into the mattress with a desperation he’s never felt so keenly in his life.
“I woke up… and you weren’t… there,” Steve says, words timed by the slap of his skin against Tony’s.
“Just so I know, is this tree yours?” Steve asks. Tony squints at him, a puzzled look on his face. Steve continues, “It’s just that, you know, it’d be crazy if we got arrested by the Italian police for stealing someone else’s cherries.”
That was the point of no return—everything that happened later was too much, too fast, too awful. The discussion about the Accords, Peggy, Vienna, Berlin, that damn airport, fucking Siberia, fucking Zemo with that fucking tape and Tony’s small voice saying
Steve knows from the rhythm of his breathing that Tony isn’t asleep, and after a few minutes of silence and overthinking he decides that he’s gonna ask Tony, after all.
It all happens in a second, so it’s not too late when Bucky covers his eyes with his metal hand, scrunches up his face, and says, “Ew, I don’t wanna know why you guys are shirtless right now.”
You can’t lose hope when it comes to how much you love your family and the things that love can make you do.
“No. It’s fine. Just tired, you know? Long hours staring at screens and everything.” Steve’s expression turns hurt at the obvious lie, and Tony can’t deal with it anymore. He needs to cut this short. He lifts a hand in the direction of the heavy bag. “Thank you for—”
“No. It was... Steve. I wasn’t scared. You didn’t scare me. I was surprised, I didn’t expect you to do that. But it wasn’t a bad thing.”
During those few seconds, Steve is awake enough to be aware of his feelings, but he’s still also asleep enough to believe the lie that Tony is still alive. But then the moment passes, and reality slaps him in the face with all its brutality, and Steve opens his eyes, and the other side of his bed is empty because Tony isn’t there, because Tony is dead.
Tony nods, thoughtful, but doesn’t say anything else. Steve finishes shaving him quietly, then makes him rinse his face again, but Tony insists on using his own aftershave. Steve is more than happy to let him; he loves Tony’s aftershave.
Steve pushes Tony’s hair away with his fingers, and presses a long kiss on Tony’s forehead, a soft brush of kind, wet lips, coupled with the rough scratch of his beard.
He clears his throat, and it’s almost worse, it’s Steve confessing that whatever Tony’s doing right now is working like a charm. Which is true, yeah, but Steve wants to pretend not to be this easy to undo.
Tony comes back to himself guided by the sound of his own harsh breathing. His heart is thumping in his chest as if he just ran for an hour, his dick is half-hard. Steve’s teeth are still biting into his skin, but the pain is only a dull memory.
Steve takes a quick shower, then cleans Tony up with a wet towel. Tony doesn’t feel like getting up right now: he’s lying comfortably in bed, stomach down—his side slightly lifted so he doesn’t crush the reactor with his weight—a hand under the pillow, completely naked. He feels sore, tender, still open, but he’ll be fine soon. And it was worth it, anyway. God, it was so worth it.
“Steve—” Tony whispers, and god, his lips are so close. If he concentrates enough, he could recall the taste of Steve’s saliva perfectly, could almost feel it again on his tongue, the memory clear and exact.
“I can’t fucking believe no one told me she died. That week, what a mess. How did I miss that? Un-fucking-believable.” His voice isn’t as steady as he’d like, and he drops the knife in the sink with a clatter that sounds deafening in the quiet of the room. Steve, who was sitting in his chair, gets up and steps closer. He lifts a hand as if to touch Tony, but then thinks better of it, and sets it down on the countertop.
Steve wonders if he should leave or not. Tony hasn’t acknowledged him, but this thing looks like is gonna play out pretty much like the other day, with the only difference being the person Tony is worried about.
No. No, it doesn’t. It doesn’t. The man didn’t care. Anything he did or didn’t do was part of his sick power game, and there’s nothing deeper than that. Even asking Tony to join him as leader of Hydra was just to see if he could push Tony over that particular edge, if he could destroy him so completely, make him turn on his friends. He didn’t really want Tony by his side.
And after that, of course, Tony doesn’t suddenly love himself. He isn’t magically healed. But he doesn’t think about the way he sees himself for a while, and he feels grounded again, centered; he finds his balance again. And for the time being, that’s enough.
Steve notices he stopped breathing a while back. The little bubble of air provided by the shield is not enough, and it’s filled with the fumes of the decomposition of Tony’s body.
Steve slams the door shut and then presses Tony up against it face-first, grinding his erection against Tony’s clothed ass. Tony already feels wet.
“I don’t know. What’s going to happen… We still know so little about it, we don’t even really know what we’re up against. But if we’re not even together, then we don’t stand a chance for sure.”
Then Tony sees it: there, hidden by the tuft of hair that usually falls on Steve’s forehead, just on the hairline, there are a few strands of white.
God, he’s gonna screw this up so much. He can’t possibly be a father. What the hell was he thinking?
“Here, here,” he hears Tony say, and then he’s pressing a slick finger against Steve’s mouth, and Steve licks it clean and wants more, more, more of that, exactly, exactly—
Steve drops to his knees on the gravel trail, tears streaming down his face, the hot air filling his lungs transforming into ice there—it seeps into his bones more acutely than ever, freezes him over.
He can’t reply with that, but a noise betrays him. It comes from a place that’s hurting deep in his chest, in front of his heart, right where the reactor used to cut him open.
It’s Stella, when she was a teenager. She’s wearing a white, old-fashioned bathing suit, smiling while she eats ice cream on a beach chair. Next to her there’s Mom, wearing a similar bathing suit, only in a darker color. She’s laughing so much that her eyes are closed with it.
Tony closes his eyes in the dim light on the room. The sun is setting, and the shutters are half-closed. The curtains are billowing out with the breeze softly blowing from outside.
He walks to the car. Pepper arranged it for him, as a personal favor he shouldn’t have asked for in the first place.
“No, he can’t,” T’Challa replies, and shows Tony a bracelet on his wrist, which is all the explanation Tony is going to get.
He watches Tony throw his head back and stare at the sky with his lips parted. He takes a moment to savor the anticipation, and to memorize the shape of Tony’s throat now that it’s stretched and exposed like this.
“It makes me sleepy, though. Not drinking... it can happen. It’ll pass, it’s just a temporary side effect. It’s only been a few weeks.”
That causes another sob to shake Steve’s chest, and more tears spill from his eyes, roll down onto his beard. He covers his mouth with his hand to keep himself from making too much noise.
Tony gets up and rearranges their positions. He kneels behind Steve’s head and reaches back up Steve’s body, towards his cock. In a flurry of skin and harsh breaths Steve suddenly finds Tony’s dick pushing past his lips, while Tony’s mouth is around him again a second later.
Maybe FRIDAY will hear him, Rhodey will come and save him... But no, no, that’s impossible because FRIDAY isn’t there and Rhodey is hurt and hurt bad and it’s all Tony’s fault because Tony always hurts the people he loves, always, always, that’s why they leave him—
The relief Steve’s touch brings him is instantaneous. Like sitting in front of a fire after a walk in the snow—warmth seeps into Tony, and his sense of safety knits itself back together every time he draws in a breath and smells blue roses, with every beat of Steve’s heart that he can hear so clearly now that his ear is pressed to Steve’s chest.
A bird lands on the ground in front of him, searching for food. Tony observes it peck in the dirt, then take off as soon as it realizes that there’s nothing there. Its nature screams at it to keep looking and looking, and it doesn’t fight it.
Steve is fucking into him faster now, harder; the slick easing the way in and out, the knot already starting to swell inside Tony even before Steve comes, and the slap of Steve’s thighs against Tony’s ass is obscene and pornographic and mind-bogglingly poetic.
They set off down the hill, in the opposite direction Steve took that morning to reach the main road. The landscape is pretty much the same as Steve appreciated during his run. The sun makes Tony sweat, his skin shines with it.
Tony takes the blue blanket from the back of the couch and goes outside, walks around the building to the oak tree on the back. He spreads the blanket on the grass, sits down on it.
And then Steve thinks about himself, about how he’s received one single text from Sam since he got to Italy, while Tony instead keeps in touch with so many people, he has Rhodey and Peter and Pepper and Happy and T'Challa and meets
He dreams of no one but their closest friends knowing that Steve and Tony are buried together in the ice.
Steve fucks into him slowly, it’s more painful than anything for him so early on, but it also gives him relief. That much is clear from the way he sighs and moans on top of Tony, like a starving man being fed for the first time in ten years.
“I thought… I had this thought, that I was in this place that was so old, that had been there for centuries, you know? And it made me feel... I don’t know how to explain it with words, but it made me feel like maybe I wasn’t lost, or drifting away. I belonged here, now. I could find a home, and it wouldn’t be ripped away from me again. I felt like… like there was something in my life that wouldn’t change again all of a sudden, and leave me behind.”
He can barely move. His muscles seize up every time he tries, giving him shocks of white-hot pain that make tears well up in his eyes. He can usually stand physical hurt pretty well, but this is beyond everything he’s ever had to tolerate.
“You know what I don’t get about this stuff?” Tony says, nudging Steve’s elbow, and Steve stops staring at the little golden stars that decorate the ceiling to look down at him.
“Well, life turned out to be more complicated than she expected, Steve. Tony’s father resented the fact that they didn’t seem to be able to have children. Of course, he blamed Maria, not the fact that he was old and spent his days drinking and smoking. He’d made her feel guilty about it. As if she’d been… a bad investment.”
“Of course I have. Last time, it was right after New York. Our last attempt at making it work. It didn’t work. As you know.”
Tony comes in Steve’s throat and trembles in his arms for a while, then says, “Please, fuck me. As hard as you can.” And Steve does.
He strains to reach the emergency release button, hidden between two plates of the armor in his thigh. The suit hisses, and he’s immediately free of it.
He bends down to look closer at her for a minute, then locks his gaze with Tony’s without saying anything for a while.
, and Tony knows Steve means this earthly life, not just after waking up from the ice. He means his entire life.
He swallows around the lump in his throat, sobs again, wipes at his face with the palm of his hands. He nods. Breathes.
Finally, an order. Something to grab on to, something that breaks Tony’s free fall into the hole of his own terror. His heartbeat slows down.
“We’re going to eat something called panino col lampredotto. Lampredotto is the final part of the stomach of a cow. It’s chopped up and boiled and served in a sandwich dipped in broth, then it’s seasoned with lots of salt and pepper. You can top it with a spicy sauce or salsa verde, or both. It’s super good and I haven’t eaten it since, like, 1999, so we are going to eat it now.”
“I don’t know what happened. It… it scared me,” Steve says. It felt just as bad to him as it did to Tony.
With a spoon, he adjusts the herbs inside the fish, then places the slices of lemon over their sides.
Steve appears next to him. He drags the cowl down and Tony looks at him and wants to laugh when he sees his hair, all messed up and sweaty and standing up in spikes.
He doesn’t hurry up. He can’t risk hurting Tony, who is possibly not really thinking with his brain right now. But he doesn’t stop, either, and soon Tony is as open as he’s gonna get.
Tony feels Steve lace their fingers together in the space between the armchairs. Steve’s hand is strong and warm, and Tony feels his limp and lifeless.
She poops a lot, Tony finds out. How is it possible for a baby so tiny to poop this much? Jesus Christ.
Tony flicks his wrist just so, crooks his finger up, and barks out a laugh when Steve jerks around him and lets out a string of impressively creative curses.
Tony snuggles up against Steve’s body, presses his face in his chest, rubs at it with his cheek, and it tickles; it makes Steve shiver. Steve hugs Tony closer to himself, strokes his back, his shoulders. Tony lifts his gaze to look at Steve, small between those massive arms. It’s a long time before they avert their eyes, and even then it almost feels like a loss. What a strange thing, to become so dependent on something that you didn’t have for most of your life, on something that you had resigned yourself on having to live without.
“It’s nothing serious, it’s supposed to pass in a couple weeks. But for some reason, it’s sticking with me. I keep having the illusion...” Tony shakes his head. “Conflict and memories usually trigger attacks. They’re exhausting, I pass out right after, you saw it.” He sighs. “So. It’s a bunch of things.”
Tony thinks about that night at Clint’s farm, about Steve sleeping next to him, about how careful they were not to touch at all.
Steve waits near the trunk, stupidly worried that Tony is gonna slip and fall. It’s unlikely, Tony is fit and agile, has quick reflexes, is a grown man who doesn’t need Steve to look after him. But Tony also sleeps too much and has bad dreams and his arm and chest hurt when he’s angry.
through the bond and Steve rolls him over, and again keeps him still with a hand between his shoulder blades—as though Tony is going anywhere, but Steve is all Alpha instinct now—and fucks into him without much preamble.
He barely remembers how he got back home that night. He climbed the stairs back to their room and everything was there, ready for Tony to use, like always, like normal. Tony’s things didn’t know that Tony was gone, never to be back again.
Tony grabs Steve’s wrist, brings his hand up to his own mouth, and plants a kiss—the most delicate touch of his lips—on Steve’s fingers.
He remembers panicking. He remembers the control wheel bending under the terror in his fingers. He remembers watching the surface of the sea getting closer and closer. He remembers Tony sitting next to him, tapping the reactor to activate the suit.
“Tony,” Steve repeats, but he doesn’t seem to have anything else to say after that. He sighs—lets his chest rise and fall with it, lets his misery draw a shadow on his face. He looks at the floor and doesn’t notice Tony walking towards him until he hears him rest the book on top of the coffee table.
Stella apologizes for not walking them to the car, but she watches them from the door until they drive off. Steve insists on driving, and Tony lets him without a fight. He’s starting to feel really tired. Fraying at the seams, exhausted.
He reaches up to clasp Steve’s arm, in a gesture that it’s meant to bring him comfort, but it’s probably more awkward than anything else.
The grand opening of the charity’s activities. The Sarah Rogers Foundation for Widows and Orphans. It will operate worldwide; Steve insisted he didn’t want it to be a US-only thing.
“I wasn’t! I was sitting on the bed! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry… Ah, fuck—” Steve squeezes his eyes shut and visibly tries to breathe through the pain, swallows his panic down.
I always stared too much, and my eyes always fell to his lips. Sam told me once. Rhodey too. And Bruce. And Nat. And Scott. And Rocket. And Thor.
The kitchen is on the right, spacious and bright, and the smell of apples coming from the oven makes Steve’s mouth water. On the opposite side of the corridor, past a big arch, there’s a living room—it looks cozy and lived-in, and Tony spares a few moments to pet the three cats sleeping on the couch. “My little girls,” Stella says fondly while one of them walks over to Steve and brushes her body against his legs. He bends down to caress her head, and she lifts her paw to touch Steve’s hand, as if to welcome him in her home. He looks at Tony, and finds him nuzzling the neck of the black cat. She purrs at him.
“There’s... there’s meat inside... inside the pasta. The, uh, the pasta is made with eggs, it’s not... it’s not regular pasta.”
But Steve starts to wonder what it would be like to come inside Tony, you know, just because he really likes feeling like a kicked puppy, and because that’s the thing that never happens, and, sure, it could just be that Tony doesn’t like bottoming, plain and simple; not everything Tony does has some weird, hidden motivation that Steve isn’t privy to. But Steve wonders, and the more he wonders the more it doesn’t happen.
“Yeah, I know. I don’t know. Thinking back on it now, maybe she was trying to tell me about my parents. Maybe she hoped you’d tell me soon, and wanted me to know something about Barnes, before. I don’t... I really don’t know.”
Steve reaches for Tony’s soap. He lathers up his hands. He starts massaging Tony’s back, slowly making his way up toward the injury, towards the swollen, red-blue skin of his shoulder. He goes above it, over Tony’s collarbone, and below it, reaching as far as Tony’s elbow, coming back up again on the underside of his arm. When Steve’s hands move over the nape of Tony’s neck, pressing his thumbs deep into the skin at the base of Tony’s head, that’s when Tony lets go of the sob he’s been holding in his chest this whole time.
The kid turns and points to a woman sitting at a table outside a coffee shop. She raises her hand, and Tony waves back. “Mi chiamo Luca.”
“Of course I want you. Of course I love you. I just wish you didn’t… that you could see yourself with my eyes. And I know you need me to be your Alpha now, but maybe this is what… Ugh, I can’t… I just… You were crying. I can’t pretend that didn’t happen.”
“‘Course. Here,” Steve says, grabbing Tony’s hand tight. His fingertips brush the silver band at Tony’s wrist.
Tony laughs, cups his hands in the water stream and washes his face. It’s not refreshing, but it’s clean water, and it takes away the sweat and the fatigue of having his emotions always so close to the surface.
“Remember,” Steve says, then shyness stops him. He hesitates, comes to sit on the couch next to Tony, tucking a leg under himself. He’s wearing a dark, thick cardigan that clashes with the rest of his wardrobe. He has a white t-shirt underneath, gray sweatpants. He looks good and cozy, but different.
He lowers his head, rests his forehead against Steve’s like they’ve done many times in the past few days.
, and Steve does. He starts slow, letting Tony get used to it, pulls almost all the way out and then pushes back in, over and over again, with heavily controlled movements. The air catches in Tony’s chest, he gasps a few times, Steve keeps looking at him because he loves him, because he wants to make sure all Tony’s reactions come from pleasure and not pain or discomfort. Tony seems to not care either way, like he would take anything right now as long as it comes from Steve, and this level of trust scares Steve for a moment, makes him feel unworthy and unfit, undeserving, like it’s inevitable that he’s going to screw this up eventually and betray it, betray
He scolds himself, shaking his head. He should answer the call before Tony gives up and hangs up. After all this time with no contact, he can’t have Tony think that he doesn’t want to talk to him, that he doesn’t care. He’ll always care.
Then Steve hugs him. Doesn’t kiss him, doesn’t touch him, he just takes Tony into his arms and keeps him there.
Steve sits up abruptly, and Tony does as well. Tony takes Steve’s face into his hands, keeps their eyes locked, but Steve can’t look at him, can he? How can Steve look at him?
The knowledge weighs on him at first, then it blazes through him and leaves him ashamed, needy, overwhelmed, and beyond incapable of keeping it together, of being decent and demure and worthy of an Alpha such as Steve.
could ever glance twice in your direction with anything but mild annoyance, like you look at a cockroach you just killed with your shoe.
He changes into day clothes, takes his phone and his tablet, picks up the blanket from the back of the couch on his way out. He spreads it a bit closer to the oak tree, where the shade is deeper. It’s very warm today, and he’s glad he doesn’t have to wear the undershirt.
“Want you to fuck me,” Tony says, his words harsh against silence and darkness. “Want you to spread me open and take what’s yours.” Tony circles his hips to press his ass down against Steve’s cock. He’s not hard yet, but he’ll be soon. “I’m tired of being angry. I’m tired of being dead.” He sucks down on the skin of Steve’s throat. “We’re gonna die pretty soon anyway.” He laughs, hollow, bitter. “Might as well try to fuck the fear away. The stench of death…”
Under the covers, Steve feels safe enough to cry. He shifts to get closer to Tony, hides his face against the reactor. He can see its light through his closed eyelids, hear its subdued hum. The scent of coconut. He can trace the ridged shape of the scar from over Tony’s t-shirt.
Steve’s chest rises and falls with the rhythm of his breathing. He looks up, at Tony’s face, lifts an arm to press his hand to Tony’s neck, in that position that has become almost a comfort for Tony at this point.
Stella’s face turns very serious. “No, I guess she wasn’t. She thought moving to the States would ensure she’d never live the horrors of the war again, and she didn’t. But that wasn’t enough to make her happy. Maria was very ambitious, just like her father. They made sacrifices to get what they wanted.”
Steve slams his shield on the Iron Man helmet, over and over again, until it shatters to reveal Tony’s face, distorted in a mask of blood and terror.
Tony has lost track of time. He doesn’t really know what day it is. He knows Sarah is okay though; Bucky and Nat text him regular updates.
He stops jacking Tony off. He splays out his hand and uses the palm to trap Tony’s dick against his belly. He covers it fully, from head to hilt, and presses down on it, hard. He fucks into Tony one last time from behind, as much as the knot lets him without it being dangerous, and just enough to push against that one spot inside Tony that makes him see the stars. He stretches his hand just enough to roll the pads of his fingers into Tony’s balls, and past them, over his perineum.
There’s still some conflict about it inside him, because he wishes he could just make the pain stop, but… yeah. The voice—Tony’s voice—has a point. It was a matter of principle too. A matter of morality, of a system of values that had to be true for Steve if it was true for everyone else.
When he nudges Tony’s hole with his middle finger, Tony arches his back and moans, but there are no signs of discomfort on his face, so Steve keeps pressing in, fighting for every inch, and after a while his fingers are pressed together inside Tony, so Steve moves them. In and out at first, just a fraction, just to see how Tony handles it. Then he scissors them, more and more, to get Tony used to the sensation.
“That’s me. Nice to meet you,” he says, shaking her hand and kissing her cheeks. She hugs him too, but not as tight or as long as Tony. She really is short.
Tony kisses him back, and he whimpers, and he curls into Steve a bit when his knees seems to give up on him, but Steve is there to catch him before he can fall and when Tony rests his head against Steve’s shoulder and closes his eyes again, Steve knows that Tony knows, right then and there, that none of this was meant to punish him.
He washes his face with cold water, puts on the aloe cream Sam gave him for Christmas. He doesn’t need it, the serum takes care of any irritation in minutes, but it has a nice scent. It reminds him of Sam, who uses the same brand for himself.
“And you will. But not right now. Right now you need to rest. Please.” Voice kind and warm. A request, again, and one to which Tony can’t reply.
He forces himself to get out of Steve’s embrace in a natural way, but a shiver of loss and regret runs down his spine a moment later. Tony closes his eyes and waits for it to pass.
Steve goes very still. He dips his head low and presses his forehead against Tony’s chest. Tony wonders if he’s listening to his heartbeat. Steve exhales heavily, his hot breath grazing the skin of Tony’s stomach.
Steve grabs his hips and keeps him still as he lines himself up and thrusts into him. He lets out a grunt of relief, and Tony would snicker at how well his little game worked out but he can only let out a shout.
His dick is hard, and he needs to fuck Tony, but he wills himself to ignore it. There’s something else attracting him, luring him, and he goes, willing and gullible as the young hero at the beginning of old stories.
Tony does. But it shifts away from him from time to time, doubt kicks him in the face and forces him to reconsider all the variables, go over all the fluctuating pieces of data again and again until he’s nauseated by it. How much of it is a well-pondered decision, how much of it is his own unrestrained, carnal desire for Steve’s skin on his, Steve’s lips, Steve’s raw attraction for him. How much of it is the ineluctability of being so desperately, masochistically in love.
Okay. That’s okay. Tony has every right to be angry with Steve, has every right not to want to speak to him.
The time after that, Tony sucks Steve off against a wall, Steve is so on edge that his orgasm hits him after only a few minutes, and when he comes to, he fixes his eyes on Tony, who is jerking off with that same merciless and ferocious pace he set on himself that time in the gym shower. Steve crouches down next to him, slowly brings Tony’s head up with a hand under his chin. Tony’s eyes flutter open and before he can close them again, Steve holds his gaze for a moment, then looks down at Tony’s lap, then Tony’s eyes again. Then he licks his lips. It’s a silent question, a voiceless request for permission, but it’s a very obvious and clear one, and Steve has no intention of proceeding until Tony allows him to.
“We came to Italy in the hottest part of the year, and I can’t even complain to you about it,” Tony says with a little grin on his face.
“Yeah. They’re the same ones I made right after Afghanistan. I brought them here to wear in public, but then you were here too, and… I didn’t want to tell you at first, I wasn’t even talking to you, and then I just… went on hiding it. It’s been kind of a nightmare though, ‘cause the shirts are kinda thick for this muggy weather. And with another t-shirt over...”
Tony kisses him, deep and unashamed, his tongue meeting Steve’s in the most familiar way. Steve chokes out a muffled sob and Tony starts bouncing on his cock in earnest, setting up a punitive rhythm that makes the bed squeak under their weight, and—
She comes into the doorframe from a room on the right, and the first thing Steve notices is her eyes: blue, but different from Steve’s—lighter, brighter, bluer. The spark of intelligence behind them is not unlike Tony’s: it’s the brilliance of genius, a vivacity so intense it becomes pure light. It’s the sign of a mind that has never stopped creating, not ever, not for a second, since its inception.
The first rays of sunshine allow Tony to see inside the room, and he finally decides that he’s stared at the clock long enough. He shifts his gaze to another part of the room, the one he’s been trying to avoid.
Tony bows his head, nodding over and over. Steve can practically feel him turning the words into his head, acquiring new confidence with them, with their tangibility, with the new reality they shape.
Tony leads Steve to the centre of the town, in front of a small ice cream shop with a ridiculous queue outside.
He tries to remember Tony’s scent, the aroma of the other night’s spaghetti, the sound of Tony’s laugh under the cherry tree, the timbre of his voice.
One of them turns me over and forces himself inside me, the others waiting around, more or less patiently. Suddenly, a hot liquid hits my back and the guy fucking me protests, disgusted. He says that
Tony’s chest clenches with the familiar sting of anxiety. He brings his hand to it, swallows his frustration and tries to keep the trembling at bay. He doesn’t quite manage.
Tony drives, and Steve is quiet in his seat. The sun is still up; the countryside appears still and silent, a desert full of hidden life. The wheat glimmers under the scorching light of the sun; the asphalt too. The trees are so motionless they seem painted against the empty sky.
I’m lying in bed. He woke me up. I feel a tear roll over my temple and into my hair. The painkillers wore off. The painkillers wouldn’t help with the bite of hearing him talk about someone who was and wasn’t me.
God, if only Tony hadn’t acted like a dumb, insolent, recusant Omega who doesn’t know how to behave on a first date. But he did, and now he can say goodbye to all his timid hopes of a bite on his shoulder, of a bond in his mind. Of a relationship, finally, at forty-
“After Ultron, you told me you felt at home at the compound. Then you wrote me that letter and you said that the Avengers weren’t your family. I don’t... I don’t understand—”
He draws the city skyline multiple times, using different styles and colors, but after a while his heart isn’t in it anymore, and he closes the sketchbook, puts it back in its drawer in the desk. Steve picks up his favorite pencil and walks to his bed. From the bottom drawer of his bedside table he takes out another sketchbook, hidden behind his socks. He leafs through it.
Steve wakes up half an hour later on that same couch, with Tony sitting in his lap and kissing his neck. He must have showered in the workshop bathroom, his hair is damp. He is wearing a tank top and— nothing else.
Steve puts the toy in Maria’s crib. She squeezes it, grips it tight with her tiny hand. She presses her open mouth against it, leaving a trail of saliva.
Steve’s warmth radiates off of his chest and onto Tony’s back. He’s not touching Tony, he’s very careful about not touching Tony.
Her grin is huge and friendly as she extends her arms towards Tony, beckoning him into a hug. Tony has to bend down to hug her back, she’s so tiny.
Maybe Steve is mustering up the strength to reject Tony’s apology. To shoulder all the fault, because he made the mistake and he’s the one who should pay for it. Maybe he even thinks that ten years aren’t enough. Ten years of the most lonely hell that could ever exist, Sarah the only thing that kept them both anchored to reality throughout it all.
“I’m so sorry we made you feel like that, baby,” Tony says. “But it’s really not your fault. We love you, and you got caught into this fight between Dad and me, but it’s not your fault and you weren’t supposed to do anything to make it better for us. That’s not your job. Dad and I, we should’ve talked sooner. That’s on us. On me.”
Tony doesn’t look at himself in the mirror. He takes a quick shower, dresses, hops in his car and drives to a secret lab where he reboots his whole biology, effectively erasing every physical sign of what the man did to him.
He hears steps on the gravel, opens his eyes and sees Steve. He’s sweaty, but shivering; there’s a deep furrow on his forehead and his eyes are red and puffy.
Steve hesitates for a long time. He sits next to Tony, takes his hand in his own, plays with his fingers.
Steve dips his head to his chest, his shoulders shaking with laughter. He can feel Tony’s eyes on him, gauging his reactions.
He would whisper something in Tony’s ear then, something about how beautiful Tony is, or about how much he loves him. And maybe Tony would be able to believe it.
Steve wakes up the next morning to the familiar sound of his daughter’s voice. She’s turned away from him, facing Tony on the other side of the bed.
Steve conveys all that in a shy smile. He blushes a little, too, and being aware of that—of how easy he can be to read, of how his skin sometimes betrays him—makes him blush even more.
A few months pass and Tony has a new suit of armor. He’s part of a new team with an old name and they even get a new base in a mountain, of all things.
Steve takes a long shower, jacks off to unwind a bit and to calm down so he can avoid meeting Tony in this somewhat pitiful state.
The man never wanted what can be done with hands and mouths, so Tony was never forced to do that. He just wanted to fuck Tony. But the man also wished to kiss him, and yet he never did, since Tony didn’t want it. There was a small amount of respect in that and Tony—
“It’s early. We can go to Florence if you still want to,” Tony hears himself say, but Steve doesn’t reply. Steve doesn’t do anything at all.
Steve takes off his clothes. He stands there, naked in front of Tony, and tries not to shiver by thinking that soon he’ll sit in the tub.
“Might sound like a case of pot and kettle, me saying this, but the world’s problems are not on you. They’re not your direct responsibility.”
“We did,” Tony says, “but it’s a… work in progress.” He sounds unsure, and Steve feels the same. They’re trying to explain what changed last night, but it seems so confusing for Sarah. And what if they end up crashing and burning again; that would just hurt Sarah even more. They haven’t even talked about the future, or decided anything important, but their daughter is asking questions about it right now, and neither Steve nor Tony know how to answer.
He’s covered in bruises. The man grabs his skin too hard, even though Tony never struggles. Maybe it’s that. Maybe the man wants him to struggle. Maybe he wants to make it as bad as possible for Tony until he snaps, yields, and joins him in his folly.
The white trail, the dust, the countryside, a beautiful church so close to them. In ruins, and prettier than ever because of it. The way Steve feels about it is peculiar; it’s the same way he feels when he looks at Tony, more or less naked, and finds bruises in the shape of his own hand on his hip. When he thinks about how Tony said it, that he liked the way it felt the first time, after their night together. The night they made love.
The cold that has been chilling his bones for months, that hasn’t left him since that terrible day in Siberia.
Steve unclasps the sling, and something warm blossoms inside Tony, just below the arc reactor. It uncurls into him, wafts of blue light that share Steve’s scent. It spreads, up towards his shoulder blades, and down, prickling at the base of his spine. He looks into Steve’s eyes and he finds it there, too, the same thing he’s feeling.
The sign with tourist information next to the entrance says the church was built during the 12th century, but the abbey was founded in the year 1001. More than one thousand years ago. One
He fucks into Tony’s mouth, still holding him by his hair, and he’s rough and distracted and using too much strength but he doesn’t worry and he doesn’t care and he looks down and sees Tony trying to unfasten his pants.
But an unavoidable fact is this: Tony is much older than Steve. Twenty years, without considering the time Steve spent in the ice. Which is a lot for most couples, but in their case it’s probably worse because the serum keeps Steve in top condition, so much so that he’s doesn’t look or feel forty. He has displayed signs of getting older, thankfully (Steve was starting to worry he would live to watch all his friends die,
Tony squeezes his eyes shut, forces himself to regain control. He opens his eyes again, blinks a few times, blinks the tears away. Steve dabs at his face with one of his sleeves.
“Hello,” he sing-songs, his bloodshot eyes stark against the dark circles around them. His gaze lands on Tony’s naked chest.
“Okay,” Tony says, and sighs. He’s very excited about this. A bit nervous, but definitely thrilled. He likes the idea so much. He knows it’s impractical and it can be really dangerous, but… he loves it.
It hurts so much to speak, and as soon as I try to open my mouth to let the words out I taste blood on my tongue.
before he realizes that Tony is shoving his pants down his thighs and scrambling at Steve’s waistband, urgent, trembling in a way that makes it look like he’s keeping the worst of it under control and this is what spills out because he just can’t hide it all.
“I can’t do this, I can’t—” he says, pushing Tony away, starting to walk back to the shore. “I can’t, I’m sorry, I—”
“He disguised himself and brought an LMD into the morgue. Faked the papers. No autopsy. They cremated him right away. Uh.
He hears Tony start the shower while he turns on the stove, and as soon as he enters the restaurant kitchen from the back door, a young girl greets him with a quick, “Captain Rogers,” and pushes a glass jar in his hand. There’s a label on it that says
“It makes me feel like a rich asshole. And I don’t wanna feel like a rich asshole. I wanna feel like a rich good person.”
“Yeah, I… I shouldn’t have done it. I know. I should’ve called S.H.I.E.L.D. and…” He releases a breath of barely-contained anger. “No, you know what? Fuck that. I don’t care. They got what they deserved. I don’t regret doing it and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. Go ahead and be disgusted or disappointed or whatever the fuck else, I don’t give a shit. They hurt
Tony looks at Steve’s bed. He’s buried under the covers so much that only his hair is visible. And just, why? Why is Steve cold? It’s 100 degrees outside. There’s no air conditioning in here.
Tony feels Steve rest his head on his shoulder. It’s a bit heavy, but it feels nice, Steve’s weight against him, like this. Tony bends his head to touch Steve’s.
“Yeah. Very much. That’s true. But the reason why you did it—did you do it to hurt me? I don’t think so, right?”
They don’t ring the bell, the main door is wide open. Tony knocks on it, calls, “Stella! It’s Tony! Ciao!”
Steve grabs at Tony’s clothes, yanks at his loosened tie, starts undoing Tony’s buttons but he’s not really in control of his strength at the moment and he feels some of them shatter between his fingers. Tony doesn’t seem to care, he’s pulling at Steve’s sweater like it personally offended him.
Steve’s thrusts grow faster. It’s all gonna be over in a minute, and Tony isn’t exactly glad about it; he doesn’t really want it to stop—he just wishes he didn’t feel so hopelessly alone.
, as though Steve stopped just right after he started writing it, unsure, all of a sudden, if he should use it or not. Obviously he must have decided to go for it, for whatever reason.
“Something ripped this away during battle. I don’t remember what it was. I saw it on the pavement and picked it up. I didn’t even know who Iron Man was, back then.”
He’s angry. He snaps at people, even at Riri once, who really doesn’t deserve it. She gapes at him, and he bites his bottom lip and apologizes and she says that it’s okay. She squeezes his hand softly and says, “It’s okay, Tony.” He squeezes back and turns his face away, so she doesn’t see his eyes gleaming with shame.
They take a moment to laugh about it and diffuse the weird tension that talking about sex always creates between them.
One night, a few weeks later, he showers and changes into comfortable clothes that he’ll probably end up wearing to bed. He takes a laptop from the lab and a few notes he’s scribbled on loose sheets of paper.
is a list of all the places Steve and Tony visit during their stay in Italy. If anything isn't clear or you need any kind of explanation, don't hesitate to ask (even on tumblr or twitter!).
And Steve is ashamed of himself, because he knew this was a thing here, of course he did, but he just—
Then, Steve makes a sound, and another, and Tony realizes that he’s laughing. Tony smiles too, bitter, and sad. There’s no real joy here, there’s no real joy on Steve’s face either.
They spend the night together in Tony’s bed. He rests his cheek against Steve’s rib cage, and lets his strong, regular heartbeat lull him to sleep.
Steve can’t sleep, so he holds Tony close to his chest and protects him from invisible monsters, trying not to wonder if he’s one of them.
