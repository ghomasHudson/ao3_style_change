“Great. Let’s go.” He muttered, stepping to walk towards the stairs exiting the bunker.
“Dean?” Cas interrupted his thoughts softly.
As his hand fluttered back and forth between the two he was interrupted by a knock at the door. He glanced at the shirts again for a second before heading over and opening it.
He smiled to himself, having received the expected reaction. He went to type a response before suddenly stopping himself. He put his phone down, deciding to let Dean stew for a moment. It didn’t take long for his phone to buzz again, and despite wanting to hold out longer, he couldn’t help but pick it up.
He decided to let it go for now. He’d need longer to fully process what Cas had said anyway, to respond in a way worthy of what Cas deserved.
“It’s a mixtape. Dean made it for me.”
“Cas I- I love it.” He smiled down at the object again. He really did. He wasn’t just saying it.
“Oh.”
“If it was the only way... And if it’ll really bring you that much relief to have me out of this deal then I’m willing to do it. I haven’t felt like an angel for a while.” He replied softly.
“Well aren’t you sentimental.”
“Maybe, I don’t know”. Dean responded, mellow.
He didn’t. Dean knew he didn’t completely understand. He couldn’t. Not yet. Not until it was safe.
“I didn’t get to say it back.” Dean breathed out. Just like that, the words were out. He was surprised at how little resistance they put up.
“Wait! You might be onto something though.” He turned to Jack with a smile. Jack looked back up at him with wide hopeful eyes.
“What the hell are you talking about?” He was confused, scared. It came out angry.
He kept going over the conversation he’d heard. No matter which way he interpreted it or tried to find some other meaning - it always ended the same. Like in the movies, Jack had said, and Cas had agreed. Cas was in love with him. Angel of the lord, cosmic entity Cas. Powerful. Good. Too good for-
Cas tilted his head questioningly when the silence stretched out and no explanation came.
“Nope. Looks like that’s all it took. I’m free.” Sam replied gleefully.
“Okay well, if it makes you feel better-” He began, trying to catch Cas’ eye. Cas didn’t waver, opting to look pointedly at the wall behind Dean.
“I now understand your urgency about getting me out of this deal. And believe me Dean, I want out. But until we defeat Chuck and I become human, we have to be careful. I don’t- more than ever now, I don’t want to lose-“ Cas cut himself off.
Dean immediately rushed over to Cas who had been blasted into a wall earlier.
Four whole weeks had passed. Not a clue.
“Oh calm down Sammy it’s not like it’s the first time baby’s facilitated uh- adult fun times?” Dean stated with raised brows.
“Trivial Pursuit?” Sam offered.
“I don’t think we should keep this up for much longer Dean.” Cas responded stoically.
“I- What?” Sam sputtered out.
“Uh sure,” Sam replied, sounding not at all sure.
Sam was leaning halfway out the driver's side window.
“You sure like that thing huh.” He tried sounding casual and light, but affection and a hint of pride seeped through his voice.
“You want to retire… with me. Why?” There was a curiosity and glimmer underlying his eyes as he asked the question.
He looked away from his phone for a moment, flickering his eyes towards Sam. He was preoccupied with driving so Castiel looked back down. He wasn't sure if he should betray Sam like this. He stewed in guilt for a moment. But, ultimately, he did what he always knew he would. He continued his text, hitting send when he was done.
Please. Please. Please. He chanted it like a soothing mantra in his head. It didn’t help.
A shot sounded through the air.
He could feel Cas’ gaze on him as he squirmed in place.
Finally, when the emotion prickling at Dean’s eyes started to get dangerously noticeable, he coughed.
“Good to know some things haven’t changed.” Sam cut in, before awkwardly shuffling over and grabbing the bowl he needed.
“So the crystal shop was a bust. Didn’t get anything useful from there.” Dean stated, hoping that the added buffer of conversation would distance him further from the previous moment.
An hour had passed. Maybe more. No fish. Cas sighed to himself.
He’d only been making his way to the bunker’s kitchen for a late night glass of water. How was he supposed to know Cas and Jack would already be in there chatting amongst themselves? He couldn’t not eavesdrop now. So he stood there, in the hallway, a slight distance from the kitchen... listening. He wouldn’t have done this usually, but the word “deal” had pricked his ears and sent a feeling of dread throughout his body.
“Can I come in?” Cas hastily asked, not seeming to pay any mind to the other man’s question. His focus was clearly still on the hallway.
Cas glanced over at Sam again, who was stifling a yawn. His phone buzzed in his hands. He ignored it for the time being.
Normally he’d have minded missing out on a hunt. But with Cas permanently in the bunker, it didn’t seem as big of a deal as it once would have.
“I know you and Jack haven’t had it easy but I know you wouldn’t be willing to sacrifice him like this either.” His voice was cracking, emotions breaking through. The hurt was evident.
He and Cas both ignored Dean’s humourless snort.
Dean swore to himself.
I love you Cas, he thought to himself as they took off out of the parking lot.
He tucked whatever it was back into his one of his trench coat pockets gently, and then patted the item lightly as if to make sure it was still there.
Dean pursed his lips and shrugged. “Yeah pretty much.”
“Jack, I understand why you’re worried, I do. But- I told you, I’m not going to be happy anytime soon. It’s just- It’s not going to happen for me. You have enough on your mind, you don’t have to worry about me. You already carry too much weight on your shoulders.” He responded, despite the gravelly nature of his voice it was comforting. Dean had always thought it sounded like home.
He looked down at the crowd. Jody and the girls, Donna, Garth, several of their hunter friends, their family. All together.
“Great,” Sam whispered to himself.
“Also, I assumed you guys would mention it yourselves when you were ready.” He shrugged, before suddenly pausing and glancing up at the other two quickly. “Wait, so have you guys just been waiting for me to figure it out this whole time?”
“Right now we’re gonna go continue what we were doing” Dean quietly started talking to Sam while glancing sideways at Cas - who looked back at him wide-eyed but smiling ever so slightly. Then he turned back to his brother and continued. “And then I’m gonna make you pay-”
“So what- you’d give up- this-” Dean gestured around the bunker vaguely. “And settle down into something…” He seemed to not know where to go with the rest of the sentence.
he doesn’t have it on anymore. sorry
Cas sighed. Not harshly. But with a deep sadness Dean could detect even without seeing his face. He could imagine his furrowed brows, his soft oceanic eyes, his pink lips parted-. Dean sighed. Those thoughts again.
“Oh! Oh. I-”
“Nothing, I just..." Dean sighed, looking away. "Sam was asking why you don’t drive yourself to work,” He finally admitted.
“Dean I’m worried if I drop the ‘L bomb’ right now I’ll rattle you.” Those damn air quotes again.
“What the hell?!” Dean glared up at his brother, whose face was bordering apologetic, pained, and slightly hysterical all at once.
“To create a power vacuum yes. But for that we would first need to detonate the bomb- Jack- in a contained environment.” She interrupted.
“I have to go talk to Sam!” In the time he’d had to stew in the Impala, Jack had grown more and more panicked. So, he hurriedly bolted past Cas, rushing towards the direction of Sam’s room.
Many things happened at once.
Dean glared back at him wordlessly.
“Dean do you have a crush on Cas?” Jack suddenly interjected innocently.
“Hey, our family is only metres away, that’s all you’re getting for now.” Dean smirked at him. His boyfriend was not amused at the twisting of words as he looked back at him. “Come on, don’t be grumpy. I have a gift for you too.”
“Yeah well, I’ve been living with you two love birds for months now. Can’t blame me for assuming.”
At Jack’s solemn expression Cas added, “Any one of us would be happy to go to the beach with you Jack.” Then he looked over at Sam with a squint. “Just not the two of us together.”
“Alright then.” Dean nodded uncertainly, not bothering to ask for further clarification.
“What you’ve been- What I’ve heard you thinking.” Cas glanced around, awkwardly asking the question.
Dean frowned. “What are you grinning about?”
“I’m fan-friggin-tastic. Can we get going?”
“I don’t think so. I mean, I think we were pretty convincing.” Sam smiled smugly to himself. Together, he and Jack had come up with what he thought was a pretty great plan. His brother and Cas needed a bit of push, and this would hopefully be a start.
What he couldn’t understand was Cas’ point of view. Really that was what always kept him right on the precipice of it, not going any further.
Sam continued to ponder.
Cas feared he had made a mistake. He was going to inquire further about Sam’s seemingly strange reaction before the bunker door swung open.
He talked himself up as he pulled up to the Gas N Sip. He’d arrived slightly early, having a few things to pick up from inside. As he exited the car, he hoped his resolve wouldn’t crumble in the time it took to do that, for Cas’ shift to end, and for them to drive away.
When Cas didn’t seem to respond he glanced over to see him awkwardly flickering his gaze around the interior of the car. Dean raised a brow at him.
Cas took a sharp intake of breath. His oceanic eyes widened, as he looked down at the simple silver band and back up at Dean. They immediately began to water.
“Don’t be. I know I complain- but- I’m happy you like that place.” He reached over to pat Cas’ shoulder lightly.
“Yeah well you weren’t this-” He gestured at Cas vaguely, his cheeks now wholly tinted red. “Like this about it- Like you’re enjoying yourself.”
“We know that completing this mission will destroy Chuck as well as kill Jack in the process. We can’t- we won’t let that happen.”
“How’s everything?” Cas questioned as he looked at the now clean floor where the previous pie had been massacred.
Dean snorted, nearly choking on his beer.
They stood in silence for a moment. Their lips remained neutral, but both of their eyes showed a flicker of a smile. Finally, Cas furrowed his brows, as if suddenly remembering something.
“Is it because of what I asked?” He suddenly questioned.
“The way you’ve been acting. Why have you been av- Did I piss you off or something?” He decided his first choice of question would’ve put him in too vulnerable of a position. That didn’t seem to matter however. His voice betrayed him anyway, with the hurt bleeding through clear as day.
“But, you encouraged me.” Cas frowned this time in confusion. His statement sounded like a question. A familiar head tilt framed his befuddlement.
Cas stepped forward. “In case something goes wrong, and I don’t make it back. There’s something you and Sam need to know”
“Cas, uh step out for a sec.”
“You’ve ruined the moment Dean.” Castiel deadpanned back, his eyes flicking up to the ceiling in exaggerated frustration.
“Oh come on, it’s pretty funny.”
he did seem happy though
“Is there something else?” Cas questioned.
Dean sighed, going to take the seat next to Cas. However, he hesitated slightly, finally opting to leave one seat between them. The hesitation wasn’t missed by anyone in the room.
The Impala swerved for a split second.
“I know- I- Here, hide these in the fridge- Quickly!” He sent Jack scurrying away to the kitchen, boxes in tow. He ran his hands through his hair nervously as he watched Jack go.
(See the end of the chapter for
He wasn’t sure what it was about Cas that got him so defensive. And he didn’t know why Sam pressed the matter so much.
“Cas, you got your ears on? We need to uh. We need to talk. It’s. It’s important.” He awkwardly spoke out into the room.
“Hey, you got a minute?” Dean stood in his doorway, the night after Sam’s conversation with Cas. He was occasionally leaning back to peer out at either side of the hallway. Sam considered telling him to go away.
“He said he-“ He swallowed. “He told me he loved me man.” His rough voice breaking on the all important word. Eyes glazing up. He looked around tensely, making sure not to meet Sam’s gaze.
“I was thinking, what if we threw a surprise party for him?” Dean suggested hesitantly, not making eye contact as he spoke.
“This is awkward” stated plainly the man in front of him.
“Before he- before Cas saved me. He told me something.” He took in another breath.
“These aren’t Enochian letters.” Sam replied back, the suspicious look from earlier returning.
“I was just wondering if it had anything to do with the store clerk-“ He paused for a moment. “The one whose number you did not keep.” He ended casually. He wasn’t sure what had prompted him to tack on that last detail.
“We’ll see about that.”
They made him look... soft. But perhaps more terrifyingly, they made him look vulnerable and within reach. Dean tried not to dwell on why that made his chest swell up with fear and hope, and so many other unnamed emotions.
It stormed that night.
“I actually did want to talk to you about something.”
Turns out Dean had been both right and wrong. Cas did love him, Cas could love in that way, and love even the most broken of men. But loving Dean had also been his demise. About that Dean had been right.
Cas didn’t seem to be following in their footsteps, much to Dean’s disapproval. They had Chuck-related end of world crap to be dealing with. But apparently his- whatever he was- had decided a talk about feelings was in order.
Dean took in a breath and attempted to figure out where to start the conversation. After a moment he just let the first thing on his mind come out.
Dean looked back out at the road. Sam finally spoke up after a few moments.
“Yes Dean. He is. Great observation.”
Dean continued, wanting to get the conversation over and done with.
“There’s something I didn’t get to ask you, when you were here. You uh- you brought everyone back but- Cas. I dunno, part of me thought we’d get back to the bunker after you left and he’d be there or somethin.” He felt awkward, silly. His voice tinged with uncertainty.
But he said nothing.
“Maybe. But perhaps he just wants us all to spend more time together. We haven’t had a movie night or anything of the sort in a while. That may be why he was acting strange today.” Cas offered, sounding partially unconvinced, yet smiling lightly.
“Didn’t you guys already eat?” Sam frowned at them as he walked in and took in the scene.
That argument had gone on for longer than he cared to admit. He’d presented reason after reason why it was a bad idea, and yet nothing stuck. Eventually, he’d given up.
They lingered slightly near the bunker door.
“Where are we going?” Sam asked.
“He’s got crap taste in music, I was trying to help him out!”
“What makes you think that I-“
Before anyone got a chance to interject she was gone, and so was Cas along with her.
“Yeah. Who am I kidding?” He breathed in. Now or never. “Yeah, I do.”
“Well-“ Dean started.
It hadn’t been easy for him the last time, and Dean sure hadn’t helped. Guilt poured over him in waves as he remembered the previous time. Cas. Helpless. On his own. All because of Dean’s stupid decisions.
Dean tore his eyes away from the angel's face, trying to compose himself. He still had something to do.
Sam sighed the sigh of a long-suffering man. “I didn’t want Dean freaking out.”
Dean snapped out of his embarrassment and looked up with pinched brows.
The problem was that when Cas returned the most Dean had managed was a hug and a “Welcome home buddy”. It was like when Cas came back from the Empty the first time around. Dean had known then, how he felt about his best friend. He was sure everyone around him during the grieving had known too. And it had all been on the tip of his tongue when he saw Cas again. But none of it came out.
“How am I gonna get out of here?” Dean whispered, “I can’t go back to my office like this!”
“Not at all, I abhor everything about the culture of it, but my ex forced me to learn the language. You?”
“I think I understand,” Castiel answered quietly. “I’m
"That's what I asked
Castiel’s face spread into a slow smirk, his eyes half-lidded, his expression completely devilish when Dean finally looked his way.
Dean lifted his head, his eyes glazed, that intoxicating flavor a perfume now, too, he was breathing it in from the air around him.
Castiel’s slick hand reaching down to cradle Dean’s balls, gently caressing, tickling back behind them, Dean’s tension rising suddenly, almost violently, and he tried to tap out with a warning cry, but Castiel only doubled down on his efforts, swallowing and swallowing as Dean bucked and twitched and
“Ah. Yes. That.”
stances
“You don’t have to keep thanking me Cas,” he finally offered, meeting Castiel’s worried eyes with an uncomfortable smile. “You’re helping me more than I’m helping you and - “ Dean shook his head, his face pleading.  “It’s just... making me feel weird.”
Castiel sighed and gave up trying to deny it. He nodded slowly, carefully not looking at Dean.
“Do you get these a lot?” Castiel asked, his voice so gentle that Dean’s shoulders unhunched a fraction of an inch. His hands dropped to his lap palms up. Dean’s glance dropped to study the palms of his hands absently, chewing his bottom lip, before finally meeting Castiel’s eyes.
Sam, would you have some manners!”
Castiel didn’t offer any instruction this time, nor did Dean need any, tilting his head back and opening his throat, moaning and rocking forward to meet Castiel’s thrusts as Castiel roughly took his pleasure, his body rippling with the effort. Dean’s entire body flushed with waves of heat as Castiel fucked his throat, Castiel’s hands moving to cradle the sides of Dean’s face and his groans guttural and increasingly feral as he watched Dean with hooded eyes, his attention flicking from Dean’s mouth to his eyes in rapid succession.
“Okay,” said Dean, “Okay. And thank you Cas, we’ll find a way to make this up to you.”
good Dean,” Dean’s eyes welled with pleasure, tears trickling unheeded as he gazed up at Castiel in worship; Castiel’s hooded eyes darkening with pleasure the most exquisitely gorgeous thing he had ever witnessed.
, Cas. So I wouldn’t have to look at - “ Dean’s voice hitched and he squeezed Castiel tighter for a moment, gulping air, Castiel’s hands coming up to hold Dean’s hands over his chest.
“Relax, Dean, I am
” she repeated, smiling, “Did you get your homework done this week, Castiel?”
sending a thrill up Dean’s spine.
“Can my customers request a high chair when they book a table?” Castiel asked plaintively.
didn’t want to admit to.
“Tell Baby I miss her.”
Castiel snorted, releasing one of Dean’s wrists to trail a finger down the extremely appealing lines of his stomach, following the arrow of his obliques south, tickling lower, his fingertip trailing a slick trail of lubricant as he leaned down to nip at Dean’s lips, his fingers questing. Dean yelped in surprise as Castiel’s fingers got really personal, warm and slick and teasing his entrance, and he forgot to kiss back, his mouth hanging slack, Castiel licking at his lips until Dean moaned a question.
Castiel lifted his head from Dean’s chest where he was currently torturing a nipple, his face fierce. His eyes grazed over the tear tracks on Dean’s cheeks, and his expression softened; he met Dean’s gaze with such approval on his face that Dean gasped out loud at the pleasure that bloomed in his chest to see it.
Folks settled down with their bounty.  Castiel selected a couple slices of pepperoni pizza and stacked them on several thicknesses of paper plates. He grabbed a wad of napkins and made his way over to sit between Anna and Ash in the last row. Let the salesforce take front and center; Castiel preferred to observe quietly.
Dean glared at his would-be poster.
was a strong word. Dean swallowed thickly, his voice suddenly shy now, too.
“Really?” Dean teased, smiling for real now “Because I’ve only ever seen this one -”
You shouldn’t have to deal with this situation, but we’ve started down this path and it’s too late to make a complaint to HR now that we’ve made our request to Zachariah. We’re going to have to take the meeting Dean, I don’t see another way.” Castiel’s face was an agony of apology, but Dean nodded. He was right, they’d already played their hand. Dean sighed heavily, ran a hand absently through his sweat-damp hair.
“Cas, I don’t know if this is a great idea.“
Castiel waited in the dim fluorescent light of the tiny locker room - one of the bulbs kept blinking and buzzing - sitting on one of the two wooden benches between the rows of metal lockers with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands. It smelled, too, like rubber floor matting and old sweat. This was a terrible idea, they should go somewhere else, somewhere nice, somewhere that
Castiel led them rapidly down the hall in the opposite direction from the elevators, his tan trench coat flapping a little behind him with his long strides, then he ducked through a side door into a stairwell. Dean breathed a sigh of relief as the door clanged shut behind them, no one was going to see his wet knees - or his red-rimmed eyes - now.  He flashed Castiel a grateful half-smile. Castiel quirked a lip and gave him a conspiratorial wink, turned and just
Come look at this.”
He started at his Friday night run. Baby. Dean in the gay bar. He gave no context for his panic attack, just related the experience as it had happened, Anna’s eyes enormous, her sandwich forgotten. He described the argument in the car, the misunderstanding, the discovery that they wanted one another the whole time. Castiel smiled softly and stopped there, adding only that he and Dean had spent the weekend together and that they were now - he hesitated on the word monogamous, Dean had said that was private, but it was
I write so I can sleep. I *share* for the book club comments & discussion, and when there aren't any, I take it super personally. Yes I'm needy and whiny, we know this about me. I don't want to quit, and I super want to assume you don't want me to quit, so this week I'm publishing one chapter, and I'll push out the second (steamy) one once I feel seen. There are half a dozen of you that are so goddamn good about it when your schedules allow, I promise this isn't about you. This is about the silent everyone else. If you appreciate the work I do, please don't be a cricket. I need you to make a noise out in that great big abyss I toss my humanity into, so I don't feel alone in the dark. Think of this like live music. I fought through the stage fright, played a brand new song for you, you'd clap or yell "woo," right? You wouldn't leave me up there to dead silence - or dear god I hope not. If you are too shy or don't know what to say, even picking a line you resonated with to quote or a thumbs up or something like that helps. If you don't want a public comment DM me on twitter, that totally counts! I get that it's vulnerable commenting. It's hard for me to overstate how vulnerable it is for me to put this raw shit out there and feel like no one cares.
“Wait, Grabby McGrabAss? The one that wouldn't keep his fucking hands off you?” Sam looked furious, but Dean waved a hand placatingly at Sam as rage slowly coiled deep in Castiel’s gut.
“Clean suit delivery!” the child yelled cheerfully, bright white teeth flashing a smile, bright eyes  barely visible under an unruly shock of dark curls. “Mamá found you a new one today Dean!”
question, the one you are clearly too embarrassed to vocalize; I am a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent, Dean. I can kill you with a touch. I can heal your body from injury. I can bend
Castiel took a deep breath, and leapt from the cliff face.
with you... but your sex drive is like the happiest accidental bonus jackpot score of my
but Dean was beautiful, not cut like the guys at the gym, but solid and strong, like a man who worked with his hands. Castiel shut his eyes, but smooth freckled skin still swam in his vision, and he mentally scolded himself for looking; that wasn’t fair to Dean. Dean didn’t know Castiel liked looking at men and wouldn’t appreciate being objectified without his knowledge or permission.
“Hey, Cas.” Sam’s voice was smiling. “Dean’s in the shower. Can I have him call you back?”
Castiel looked smug as Sam crossed to the bureau to haul out underwear, averted his eyes just in time as Sam’s towel dropped to the floor.
“Y’know, the one nine hundred number under the words should clue them in that it’s not in person. You’d think.”
“Yes please. I mean, Hello, Sam, it’s nice to talk to you, but yes please have Dean call me.”
Castiel stared at Dean, nonplussed.
don’t want to come?”
The approval on Castiel’s face made Dean’s chest so tight it ached. He took a long, quavering breath, and waited to see what Castiel would do, which turned out to be stand up, hold his hand out for Dean’s. Dean stood up, wordlessly surrendered his hand, followed Castiel up the stairs to the linen closet, where Cas pulled out fresh sheets and led Dean to the bedroom so they could make the bed again. Cas disappeared downstairs to start some laundry while Dean used the bathroom, traded spots with him to freshen up and arrived in the bedroom naked to find Dean already lounging on the sheets, naked as well. He climbed in to lay beside him, leaned up on his elbow to gaze down at Dean’s face in the soft amber light.
There was a head shot of the new hire attached. Oh. OH. Mystery solved. The guy looked like a model. Striking green eyes, full lips, cheekbones to die for, perfect hair, and that smile. Christ, he could probably sell condoms at a convent.  Castiel rolled his eyes. If he were fifteen years younger and still innocent he would have been inexorably drawn to that face, beat his wings against that flame until he burned alive, falling to join the inevitable drifts of other moth corpses in their waxy shrouds at the foot of that candle.  Ah well. He sighed and deleted the email just as his Team Lead Anna popped her head into his cubicle.
” Dean shuddered, sank into his chair and and clasped his hands tightly together so Castiel wouldn’t see them shake. “I’m sorry Cas, I’m being a giant pussy.”
Castiel cranked the heat even though it was a warm day, for which Dean was silently grateful.
Dean stared at him, nonplussed. “I don’t think you have, Cas. I’ve never tried to use my... let’s say my ‘powers of persuasion’ on you. Or anywhere around you.”
She spoke to the room at large without turning around, the volume of her voice barely needing to increase at all to carry in the dead silence.
Castiel sounded breathlessly pleased with himself, but more than that, he sounded like
We arrive, now, at the edge of a precipice. This chapter is one of the most beautiful things I have ever written. A love letter, if you will, to Jensen in motion. I am publishing it this week and waiting until next week for the leap off the cliff face, because I want you to feel the love I felt here, this moment of seismic shift, to hold your breath with me and feel how I felt. If you are reading this after the original publication date, please take a breath, shut your eyes for a heartbeat after this chapter,  and feel that moment at the top of the roller coaster rise climb where gravity hasn't caught you yet, and just for a second, you can fly.
, his cock felt huge it was going to rip him apart he just knew it and Dean couldn't help tensing in terror but Castiel paused, soft fingers petting him, soothing him, the stretch was burning but it didn't hurt, exactly, Dean's nerve endings clanging confused alarms until Castiel broke the kiss to whisper into Dean’s ear, his breath igniting a trail of gooseflesh that started at Dean’s ear and rippled in waves down his spine.
Cas -”
That last was directed at Castiel, asked as the child heaved his burden into Castiel’s completely off-guard arms, and he struggled to catch it without dragging any of it on the ground.
“Aye.”
“How -
Dean ran his hands through his hair and shut his eyes, his face pained.
of money for this orchid, Dean. I’ll sell her to you for my cost on two conditions.”
Castiel’s front door opened right into a spacious kitchen, painted a cheery yellow with white trim and white cabinets - not what Dean would have imagined but it suited Cas, his tousled dark hair shocking against the white backdrop of his cabinets. The window over the sink faced the neighboring building which couldn’t have been more than four feet away, but the window in the front door and the big Victorian picture window facing the street let in plenty of sunshine and the space was bright and charming. There was no door into the next room, just a wide arch that opened onto a carpeted living room which Sam was already exploring, his sock feet testing the carpet as he found an outlet for his laptop, set it down on the coffee table and claimed Castiel’s couch, dropping his book bag on it and disappearing out of view only to pop back into the kitchen breathlessly to marvel  “You have a

Castiel’s whisper sounded unsympathetic, and Dean shrugged without answering.
“You don’t mind?” Castiel looked worried.
and his cock start twitching in his hand before he gave in and let the feeling take him, gasping and shuddering into Castiel’s mouth and spilling his pleasure into the scorching heat and exquisite, rhythmically spasming grip of Castiel’s body.
Dean was taken off guard, startled into staring at Castiel blankly for a microsecond before a pleased smile flitted across his face and settled into a sheepish grin, his attention studiously on the clumps of elbows he was separating.
- the desire he'd been holding back bursting free in a violent torrent, a rushing crescendo of carnal thirst and a burning need to take the control Dean was offering him, to make Dean beg some more, to see his eyes grow dark and his body tremble with pleasure or pain or both and to make him come over and over and over until he wept for mercy.  When Castiel groaned, his voice was a low snarl, and he did not recognize the sound of it as it fell from his own lips.
“Shall I stop getting dressed, then?”
“Do you trust me Castiel?”
Dean woke with a start, disoriented and fuzzy-headed. He didn’t know where he was, so maybe… he turned his head warily, but no, he was alone in the queen-sized bed. He smelled coffee and heard muffled conversation - obviously Sam, and a deeper voice, chatting amiably.
Castiel took a deep breath, blew it out slowly, and his voice was almost normal when he spoke.
down the stairs, leaving Dean flummoxed and then scrambling to catch up.
“Dean, this door has
“Tell me,” he commanded.
“Are you
“Me too, Sammy,” Dean whispered back, grinning softly, “Me too.”
“Holy Shit, that kid is getting a fat tip!” Dean exclaimed, both delighted and relieved. “Wait, am I that predictable?”
“No.”
Castiel was already trailing soft kisses down Dean’s stomach before Dean had time to react, his little noise of protest lifting Castiel’s glance to check on him.
, but -”
Dean looked surprised, his forehead crinkling, but he answered, “Sure, Cas,” without hesitation, and Castiel nodded gratefully.
“I don’t know what to ask for, but I need… more. Something else. This hurts.”
Sam snorted. "Yeah, me too, but I
He wandered into the kitchen to see what Castiel was up to, and found him splitting the scant contents of a steaming rectangular ceramic dish of beef between two plates. There were other, similar dishes on the table containing cheese and lettuce and tomato and sour cream and slightly browned guacamole in a pleasing grid and Dean poked one with his finger. It had a nice heft to it, and he nodded his approval as he sat down and Castiel handed him a plate.
“He’s fine. Get in,” Castiel said, “and shut the door. We’ll talk inside. I need you to drive, is that okay?”
“- Oh yeah it does.” Dean shook his head, wincing. “He said - he said he was ‘
Dean guiltily thought about New Year’s Eve, the way Cas had sighed and nestled against his cock in his sleep - he felt a pulse of arousal at the memory and shook his head, fought it down. Cas was asleep; he didn’t know who was behind him. Okay in retrospect that might be a point for Sam’s original argument he was definitely never going to admit to, but Cas could have been dreaming about anyone. There was no smoking gun interaction he could point to as any sort of proof, no “Aha” moment that would point to Cas wanting
“Right back atcha, Cas. Listen, Sam’s about to get home, I need to clean myself up and make dinner -”
"Computer games."
Dean, I
Sam glared at Castiel and Castiel had the grace to look ashamed.
Castiel pulled his hand all the way out of Dean to hold it up in front of Dean's face, Dean moaning at the loss and then shying away in horror, only to realize in shock - and relief - that Castiel’s hand was clean and completely dry.
“Gentlemen,
It had taken Dean several seconds to register what had happened, and the fury that had twisted his stomach at seeing Castiel’s reaction was still simmering in his veins. He had been ready to kill the bigot, hands curled into fists as he turned with his nostrils flared, but Castiel’s hand on his arm had stopped him.
Dean backpedaled a couple inches, laughing and protesting, arms up to shield his chest. “Unarmed, unarmed!” he hollered, and Castiel stood down, leaning against the table with his towel in his fist.
“I know how to do this, I think. I watched the men in the steam room do this for each other, and they seemed to enjoy it - “
Castiel turned back to observe Dean's game in plenty of time to watch him win it, helpless to keep his pride in Dean in check, his approval laced with tendrils of desire, dark and powerful. Dean met his eyes to smile at him, and his eyes widened and darkened at Castiel's expression as he shook his head almost imperceptibly in warning. Castiel slammed his face impassive again,
Castiel could hear the eyeroll and the gentle teasing, and he blushed furiously in solidarity with Dean, helpless to mount any sort of defense.
Castiel turned to the table as Dean disappeared out the door.  Ash grinned at him and observed wryly “Hey Cas, nice of you to join us!”
to bend you over this couch, Dean,” Castiel murmured, turning on his heel to cross into the kitchen while Dean stared after him and then turned back to gape at the couch, picturing it.
a little -
Castiel stared at him in shock, but he smoothed his face almost immediately, answered evenly. “Yes, Dean. Dozens of kinds. I’ll get you the address of the place I get it, they have samples there so you can take them home and figure out your preferences before you commit to a whole bottle.  I had to buy a gross of those samples actually, I can send you home with a handful until you find a time to get out there, if you like.” Castiel grinned and tilted his head towards the living room, still whispering. “I assume you wouldn’t want Sam in tow.”
“ - How did you get that bench back there? That thing must weigh a
Dean shrugged noncommittally, his lips a flat line as he turned off the spray and stepped out of the shower, reaching for a towel.
and that felt nice, although he felt a little confused as to why, after all this time he’d have gone there.
Castiel gripped his erection angrily through his briefs, his rage pushing Dean back a step, Dean shaking his head at himself, suddenly, to realize that the boner hadn’t.
It was definitely immature. If it were Cas on his own, he would have just asked Sam and Jack what was going on. But Dean had roped him into an elaborate plot instead, and while he still thought it was childish, he was in fact having fun. More notably Dean seemed especially excited. And that was important to him.
What are you doing, what are you doing, what are you doing? Alarms went off in Deans head. Why would he ask that? It was out before he had the chance to stop it. He braced himself.
He glanced back at Cas, who’s eyes were widened. Nervous, yes. But also pained. Like he was watching something slip away.
Jack — confused at the reactions he’d received —continued on, more unsure of himself this time.
He hadn’t meant for that last sentence to come out defensive, but it did. He felt cornered. It was his own fault, but he didn’t know how to get back to safety and so he pushed.
“If I tell you won’t that-“
At that Sam straightened up from his slumped position. “Wait what? What are you talking about? When?”
He beamed at both of them. “You guys deserve this so much.”
Sam snapped out of his inquisition for a moment to smile knowingly at his easily amused brother. His eyes then shifted over to Castiel. He was watching Dean chuckle with an affectionate look in his eyes.
“So. What other times were you secretly in love with me?” He smirked at Castiel, raising his eyebrows.
“Adult fun t- how old are you Dean?” Sam rolled his eyes, walking up to Cas pulling him into a hug.
“I should’ve kept it.” He smiled knowingly as if he could read Dean’s mind. Deciding to spare him from a complete breakdown if they went any further down the cowboy conversation, Cas continued.
“Fine, whatever. Well, we’re headed out, so-“ Dean trailed off, he glanced at Cas who was still looking at him disapprovingly.
Dean detected a hint of excitement in Castiel’s tone. Clearly, he too quite liked the family dinner idea.
“Where is she?” Dean muttered
Dean stared down at the ground. He hated being right. Their lives could never be easy. Things could never click into place.
“Do you want it to be?” Dean flashed his eyes at Cas’ hesitantly.
“Well, you could always quit if you hate it so much.” Dean suggested innocently, raising his brows and shooting Cas a look.
That had been the plan.
“Nothing.” He quickly said back before continuing.
Dean wandered in, closing the door behind him.
Cas looked back at him with furrowed brows, worry crowding his face.
That night Dean stopped Cas on his way out of the bunker.
He gritted his teeth, remaining in place. Damn it Cas.
Castiel rolled his eyes, looking out the window for a moment before a thought hit him.
“I told you man! I don’t know, I only heard bits and pieces!” Dean threw up his arms in seeming frustration, though really he was feeling defensive.
“Hey you know what man- you can use Enochian words, it's fine.” He got out the words between light chuckles. He shook his head fondly at the angel, clearly deeply amused by his lost puppy antics.
All three men groaned out in pain and glanced around confusedly. After a few moments the couple looked up at Sam incredulously.
Cas looked up to him through the mirror with a smile and slightly raised brows.
so you don’t want to hear about the wife?
He looked over at Cas.
He was getting tired of their worrying. It had been like this ever since they’d driven away from their failed showdown with the witch.
“What- I- Well you know what-” Dean cut himself off as he noticed the smirk playing at Cas’ lips. His face began to heat up as he realised the other man's eyes were flickering downward to his own lips. “Oh-”
“You didn’t even realise that at the time!”
“Nothing.” Dean quickly stated, not exactly remembering what Sam had asked in the first place.
He told himself it was just because the Gas N Sip already took Cas away from him so often and that she was just adding to it. However, she seemed to bother him more so than any of the other employees. Cas’ mostly teeny-bopper coworker’s did not elicit the same jealousy that his manager did.
“Oh it’s- it was a gift” Cas replied, his gruff voice almost reading as shy. Sam couldn’t gauge why.
He’d been saving people, hunting things, since he was a child. Hell, he’d never even gotten to be a kid really. That part of him died with his mother the first time around, back in that burning house. After all that, all those years, surely retirement was more than earned.
“Maybe if they think we aren’t fighting anymore they’ll leave us alone.”
However, a feeling of guilt began to stew in him as he considered the rest of what Sam had said.
Castiel squinted... or glared? Sam couldn’t tell.
“Zeppelin huh. That’s uh. Interesting. You know our parents loved that stuff.” Sam stated too casually. He had a mischievous glint to his eyes as he passed the tape back to Castiel.
“The second one. Way too fancy.” He clarified.
“Hey... are you okay? You’ve been really out of it ever since we took down Chuck” Sam inquired, his brows furrowing, eyes knowing.
“Not really.” The frown had transformed into a pout of sorts.
After a moment of silence he strained out a laugh that sounded forced even to him.
His throat felt tight.
Dean glanced back and forth between the two as the silence festered. He didn't have a good feeling about whatever it was Cas was doing. The fact that he couldn't talk to her in front of all of them was especially telling.
“Promise me you’ll come back man.” Dean replied, taken aback and almost embarrassed at how desperate he sounded. He felt too vulnerable. He felt like ruining the moment with anger, with humour, something. But he couldn’t do it right now. He was just so tired. He was tired of hiding.
He hadn’t realised that had even been a possibility at the time. He replayed that nights events in his head and then considered how they could’ve gone differently. He was sure he was blushing, which was quite the feat as all his blood seemed to be rushing elsewhere.
He didn’t look at his friend for too long, only catching a glimpse of a blue button up under the vest.
Dean muttered under his breath at Cas at that. “Yeah we gotta talk about that shopping addiction you’ve got going on bud-“ He cut himself off at the glare he received from Cas, sheepishly looking back at Sam.
This is pretty short and filler-y but the next chapter will be more plot heavy!! xx
He had been trying. Going on trips and outings in between or even during hunts with Jack and Cas. Sam too when he was around. They’d even taken to binging TV shows together, much to Dean’s surprise the kid and he had similar taste. Though if Sam ever found out about the Riverdale thing his life would be over. Dean shuddered at the idea; he’d never hear the end of it.
Cas peered at the hand with curiosity. Looking back up at Dean in question.
“Do you like it!? Oh- Sorry- Happy Birthday!” He was beaming.
Castiel's face perked up with interest. He attempted an even tone as he responded.
Finally he settled on breaking into a grin. “I take it the date went well?”
Dean jumped slightly in place. He rubbed the back of his neck before waving at Cas awkwardly. He hoped Cas wouldn’t realise he’d been starring- watching- whatever.
“Is something wrong? Everyone seems down today.” Jack stated with a worried glance at Dean .
Right now he was looking at Dean with wide concerned eyes.
The following night Dean wandered into the bunker’s kitchen for a glass of water, or something stronger. He hadn’t made up his mind yet.
No. Never mind. That was, again, one of those dangerous thoughts.
“Uh, pretty much heard what I just told you buddy. You made a deal with the empty? That’s about it.” Dean replied, glancing up Cas with a nervous frown.
He glanced away from the road ahead again, this time looking up at the rearview mirror.
Dean stared back at him for a moment.
“I don’t know man, becoming human? What if he doesn’t want to give up being an angel? It was hardly easy for him last time.” Dean responded, attempting to sound casual.
“How?”
“Dean, I don’t want to bring up Dr Sexy while we’re having a serious discussion, but I will if I must.” He stared glibly back at him.
Dean only grumpily pouted back at him.
“I meant it.”
At that Dean finally looked up at Cas, half pleadingly.
“Uh yeah?” Sam responded, it sounded like a question.
“It’s not like tha-“
“I-” Dean sighed, moving forward to sit across from Cas at the table again. Both of them pretended not to notice how careful and stilted he was while doing so. “I just want to be safe. I can’t lose-”
“We were in the kitchen you dumbass.” Dean huffed out a laugh. Looking over at Cas amusedly.
Dean snorted out a laugh, and he was pleased to hear Cas also chuckle lightly. The sarcastic comment shouldn’t really have been inspiring warm and fuzzy feelings. But nonetheless, Dean’s face warmed at the pseudo-compliment.
“Will Jack agree?”
Aside from the regular clothes, Dean particularly liked him in his blue Gas N Sip vest. He had it on over a light grey henley that day, so it stood out more so. If he had been the host of one of those makeover shows he'd never admit to watching, he’d say that it made Cas’ eyes pop. But of course he wasn’t, and so he’d never say shit like that.
Cas smiled softly. “I’m glad to have it at all Dean, I never even let myself hope that it could be possible. That you could love me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” snapped Dean, glaring at his brother who stood in the doorway.
The tension had continued to rise as they sparred back and forth. Dean’s last sentence had come out louder than he intended.
Sam rolled his eyes, but sheepishly so. Which meant Dean was right, it was definitely another hippie camp. Sam began to open his mouth, however closed it again when he noticed the shirts formally laid out on the bed.
Cas smiled up at him, tears running down his face. He was pressing his lips together, holding it all in to let Dean speak.
He immediately sighed at the thought and internally swore. Why was he so scared to admit it even in his own head?
“I quite liked ‘Good Times Bad Times’.”
“Nothing I- So what would it be that could actually make you that happy? For the Empty to come snatch you up?”
He stared off at the now empty space in front of him in horror.
“She got over it.” Sam snapped.
“Yeah yeah, it’s all great. Now Sammy, you can find your own way to the motel.” Dean remarked, interrupting the positive back and forth.
The next text came through much quicker. What Cas didn’t expect was the rush of warmth that would flood him when it did. His heart rate quickened slightly, while confusion overwhelmed him.
Like hell he did.
“When Lucifer killed you. The night Jack was born.” He gulped, remembering the weight of the pain. “It was- I was a wreck man. I’m pretty sure everyone around me knew- knew why.”
He was glad he’d done that.
“Boys." She nodded once. "It’s time.”
Dean sighed and began walking out.
He looked back down at the shirts with a sigh.
“Sorry Jack,” Castiel muttered, sighing as he watched the blocks topple.
“About the chick from the store?” Dean countered.
“What’s wrong?” Cas questioned again, the concern blatant all over his features. Dean had been the one to suggest the trip, however he didn’t seem to be enjoying it at all. He hadn’t even commented on the impressive dessert menu.
“What are you talking about? Is this about you not wanting to become human?”
Damn it. It was supposed to be the other way around.
The gravel crunched under their feet as they stepped out. The only other sound being birds and cars in the distance.
now go to sleep
Dean didn’t look up.
“You mean? You wanted to- I- Oh.” Dean blinked blankly at the space before him.
Sam conceded, only nodding in return.
“Okay, it was me. But it was an accident I- I’m-”
“Hey, get in.” Dean responded with an impatient wave inwards.
“Mean what?”
He was jealous of a goddamn convenience store... great. He sighed to himself before attempting to start up conversation again.
“I- I can hear your thoughts!” Sam continued, a tone of guilt seeping into his voice.
And yeah. Dean thought to himself. That was it.
“Instead of someone praying directly, for me to be able to hear them-“ He glanced down and back up at Dean again hesitantly. “If their longing or some other form of emotion is strong enough, that can also act as a prayer.” The words came out slightly strained.
Dean rolled his eyes before focusing back on the road. “Yeah, yeah. Just tryna help. Whatever.”
They swiftly stood, their hands separating and dropping to their sides. Jack gestured out of the kitchen and began to hurry towards the map room, the two of them followed behind him. Sure enough, Billie was there. An awkward-looking Sam stood by her.
“Well, thanks I guess.” Dean smiled at him. “Still though, I’m gonna try harder buddy. As much as I hate to say it. Sam was probably right.”
A light snoring sound removed him from his thoughts for a moment. His eyes flashed to the side.
“Dean it’s-”
Cas turned back around. His face was tightened in contemplation, as if he were trying to decide or gauge something. His eyes flashed around the room.
“I’m really sorry but the booking is for two on our system.” He glanced back and forth between the men at the table with the most apologetic grimace.
He looked over at his friend with a small smile.
Cas hesitated as if he weren’t sure he was allowed to say anything. He didn’t know why he felt that way so he pushed it aside and answered.
“Then what’s it about?” He didn’t mean to gulp as he finished his question, but he felt tense.
Dean breathed in before sheepishly making his way inside at a sluggish pace. He was met with a stone-faced Castiel looking up at him, holding some kind of engraved bronze receptacle.
“I’m not trying to have sex with you while our entire family is only metres away.” Cas stepped up to him. “I wanted to give you your birthday gift.”
“We aren’t fighting though.”
she wasn’t fun. she screamed at me for sitting in her husbands chair
I've also got a little epilogue written (it just happened when I was doing this chapter), that I'll post now xx
“You’re saying I’m making him feel bad.” Dean countered incredulously. Though there was a hint of uncertainty in his tone, a question.
“Yeah it uh- Usually when you give a mixtape like that to someone it’s- You know.” He muttered, flushing. He still wasn’t great with all this.
"De-"
Dean looked back at him. At his soft blue eyes that crinkled at the edges. Comforting.
His comfort. The ‘I love you’ he had been chanting over and over again in his head. What he thought had been harmless, he had been sending directly to Cas. He cursed himself inwardly for being so stupid.
“What was that chick whispering about?” Dean eventually broke the silence, questioning in a too-casual tone.
Deciding to finally spare him, Sam stood up, shaking his head and laughing lightly to himself.
“Oh god. I need to bleach my brain.” He muttered out in horror, covering his face.
“Get your own stuff.” Dean muttered after him under his breath.
If he brought it up now, would that mean it would be the end of his chauffeuring duties? He supposed he should be happy about that. After all, he was always muttering about being parked outside that damn store half the day.
“Well I asked Dean what he wanted for his birthday and that promptly turned sexua-“
Sam was again, at a loss for words momentarily.
“Jack really wants to throw one, and Dean will play along if he must.”
Dean turned back around, pointing accustorily at Sam. “No more hippie camps.”
Dean hadn’t processed much of her rambling. He was still stuck on a particular word she had used.
“Hah. I was just- I was waiting for you to be done. Got there a bit early.” Dean responded with an unnecessary laugh.
Sam spared him from having to speak further. “He knew Dean. He had to- I- I’m so sorry.” He cleared his throat, composing himself.
“Yeah, yeah. But you’ve seen them it’s-“ Dean attempted to sputter out an end to the sentence but it did not come.
“I love you too Dean.” The smile was audible in his tone. He sniffled slightly.
They had literally been trying to Parent Trap them. Holy shit.
“Did I misinterpret it’s meaning?” Cas asked carefully, sounding worried.
But to be fair, his life was on the line here.
Sam called out hesitantly as he searched for the two missing party-goers.
As he did, Mindy; the eccentric store-clerk he’d been questioning; walked up to them. They’d already been taking for a while, which is why Jack had wandered away in the first place. He didn’t understand most of their conversation and they’d stopped talking about the case a while back.
Sam put his hands up in surrender and replied with a chuckle.
Dean stifled a chuckle at Castiel’s seriousness. Whatever Sam and Jack’s plot was here, he had to admit it was fun to get to team up and spend time with Cas like this.
Sam nodded sincerely.
“What?” Dean tried sounding confused.
“It wasn’t me! I-” At that Jack frowned over at him, slight annoyance, but mostly sympathy behind his widened sad eyes.
“I think I’ll stay, actually. I have some things to sort out back here.” His expression dared Sam to ask for an elaboration.
Their eyes remained locked together for a moment longer until finally, Cas looked away. Dean instantly missed the connection.
“What is it?” Dean made a face at the bloody item encased in the bag.
“I’ve been in heaven helping him reshape things, I think I may have also convinced him to come back to the bunker once he’s done patching up heaven. He can be God with his family around him.” He rambled, clearly having too much too say while avoiding what he was really wanting to address. He looked up at Dean, gulping. Dean was frowning back, eyes questioning still. So he continued tentatively.
“Hey Cas can we talk?” Dean interrupted.
The conversation in the car the previous day hadn’t left his mind. It was all he could think about. It was driving him mad.
Cas narrowed his eyes slightly, but to Dean’s relief he allowed the obvious detour.
His phone buzzed again.
“Don’t get me started.” Dean huffed out dramatically, turning his head to glare in Castiel’s direction.
Sam continued looking at him worriedly, so he continued.
Cas returned his gaze up to the roof before closing his eyes. When he didn’t seem to want to make any more conversation, Dean grew restless.
“I assumed so.” Cas politely replied.
After a quick moment of surprise Dean’s full-blown smirk properly returned. Cas rolled his eyes again, this time less so annoyed as if he’d intended to gain that reaction.
However, he softened his gaze a little when the disgruntled response seemed to heighten Dean’s embarrassment. He sighed lightly, feeling bad. Dean had clearly just been trying to do something nice for him, though why he thought Cas would need a picture of himself he did not necessarily understand. Perhaps since Dean was particularly fond of anything cowboy related, he thought Cas would share the enthusiasm too, he reasoned to himself.
Dean breathed a sigh of relief. He took down a mental reminder to wake up early and spit in Sam’s smoothie the next morning.
He looked up at Cas to see his brows slightly raised.
Cas looked at him, squinting.
“I just- Sam said something-”
‘You ever seen Brokeback Mountain Sammy? Well-’
It was a disaster.
Cas finally looked up. Eyes not revealing anything, though he smiled softly.
Cas and Dean are together. That means Sam and Jack can stop scheming. Right?
After the fumble from the previous night he didn’t want to mess up again. He didn’t want to hurt Cas again. He’d seen it on his face. The sliver of hope, which had promptly shattered into a million tiny pieces. All because of him.
“See you around agents” Mindy called out as they walked away.
Even more so when Castiel finally allowed himself to react. A small and gentle smile broke out onto his face, his eyes were welling, but he didn’t hold back in the same way Dean did. He let the tears fall.
Sam poked at his pizza for a moment before responding. He was also curious, and kind of wishing he’d gone with Jack's 'let’s follow them there and watch them from another table’ plan, as flimsy as it seemed.
“Dean at least she’s helping us.” Sam reasoned.
He seemed to finally reach a conclusion though as he looked up at Dean and breathed in with purpose. He spoke carefully, each sentence constructed with care.
Happiness wasn’t something he was used to keeping for long. Not only that, but he was still unlearning so much. Not cutting himself off right before he said something vulnerable. Not flinching for a moment, every time Cas reached for his hand.
“It’s just- crazy that you’re reassuring me by telling me how not happy you are. It’s kinda funny, but kinda messed up.” He frowned down at their hands.
As the words began to stumble out Dean suddenly cut himself off.
Dean’s face began to heat up. He should’ve just stayed in bed.
“You’ll have to talk about it someday Dean.” He called out as he left.
Sam pinched his brows. The plan was taking a lot longer than expected and they were both starting to lose it slightly. However, he was glad to see that even he still had limits.
Dean exhaled.
Sam whipped his head up suddenly at Jack, who stood in his doorway with a sorrowful expression on his face. 'Kicked puppy' was the description that popped into Sam’s head.
There was an incredulous pause.
A response immediately came back.
“Dean, are you- taking pictures of me?”
Dean continued to look at him, unsure of how to keep the conversation going.
“I should go… Dean’s waiting.” He slowly began to back away, turning around when Sam opened his mouth to speak.
“Cas this is important damn it!” Dean said gruffly, clearly making an effort to not raise his voice too harshly.
“Might even go take a stroll after.” Dean internally winced at the use of the word stroll, but clearly desperate measures were in order.
He had spent so long being afraid of what would happen if the dynamic between him and Cas shifted. So much so that he’d been content just stifling anything that threatened it. He hadn’t realised it could be more of the same but so much better, and so much more freeing.
Castiel, with his now done up pants interjected.
“No I- You’re right Cas, I know you’re right it’s just- Just when we’d found a way to help you.” He replied with the prior harshness in his voice now stripped away.
Cas smiled at him knowingly. “Are we not listing moments I was in love with you anymore?” He raised a brow.
“Are you angry Dean?” Cas asked softly.
“Fine.” The silence broke as Billie finally walked up to Cas, coming to stand before him. She didn't bother looking at the others as she spoke. “We'll be back. Contact Amara, tell her to get here.”
Sam sighed. So that was still going on.
a few hours still. you should go to sleep we’ll be back by the time you wake
It was him. The photo from Dodge City.
“Well. If it makes you feel better I’m not an angel anymore.” Cas responded.
“Cas you’re not helping.”
“Dean I’m confused, why are you bringing up purgatory now?”
"What about you?" Cas continued.
“So what did you mean about being jealous?” He questioned.
“You’re a priority too, don’t think you’re not.” Dean somehow managed to throw out the caring words roughly.
Sam blinked. Castiel’s mouth had not moved for that last bit, and yet Sam had heard his voice. He stared at Cas who paid him no further attention.
While there were moments that he could maybe convince himself otherwise. The moment’s where he sensed something from Cas’ side of things. They weren’t out here living cookie-cutter white-picket-fence lives. There wasn’t space for something even close to a- Dean scoffed internally at the word- a relationship for them.
“Ask Cas!” Dean gestured over at the man next to him. Sam turned his head to Cas, who nodded gravely at him. Sam huffed.
“What? No! No. God damn it.” Dean burst out, immediately looking over at Sam to make sure he hadn’t woken him up. To his relief, his brother was still out cold.
Screw it, he’d just wait parked outside the Gas N Sip. Better there than hanging around Sam’s smug ass any longer.
Dean looked up at him like a deer in headlights, still unable to form sentences. He was certain hearts weren’t made to beat as fast as his was at that moment.
Dean’s eyes widened, his face flushing. “I- I didn’t mean-”
At that Dean sighed, tilting his head up to the roof in frustration. Sam continued to glare at him.
Yeah, so he kept Cas’ work schedule memorised. It made it easier to plan things. Especially since Cas had been receiving fewer late-night shifts in the recent weeks, and therefore, had more time and energy to spend. It was a matter of convenience really, he justified to himself for the dozenth time.
Some things he was scarily quick at picking up, to the point where Dean was certain there were still some weird angel powers lingering. No one was that good at Mario Kart (which absolutely fell into the life skills category). Other things, not so much… he was just glad he’d used Sam’s shirts when teaching Cas how to iron.
“Weird how?” Cas questioned. His worry was apparent.
“I’m sorry am I bothering you?” Sam suddenly questioned, his brows raised. He blinked pointedly a few times.
“No! Not that. I mean you’re an angel- I thought- There's no way you could feel that way about-" He cleared his throat. "I'm a mess.” The words faltered at the end. He looked down, frowning at his hands.
Dean looked up and instantly relaxed slightly. With a sigh he concluded that his homicidal plans could wait for another day. At least he’d be escaping that damn knowing smirk while he dropped Cas off at work.  (What did the smirk know? Hell if he knew.)
Cas tilted his head, looking up at him knowingly before giving Dean a quick peck on the lips.
When Dean looked back up Cas stared at him in slight confusion. Though Dean also thought he detected a flash of embarrassment pass over his expression. He wasn’t sure what that was about.
Dean frowned, looking up at him. “Huh?”
Dean glanced side to side with a huff. “You know! It’s like in those chick-flicks-“
“When you’re truly happy, yeah I know.” Dean snapped back. “And you’re okay with that?!” He continued. He wished he could get Cas to understand without endangering him. He wished he could inspire in him the same urgency he felt. He needed Cas out of the deal so that-
Dean nodded tensely at him, eyeing Sam.
“I’m traumatised is what I am. And yes it is the spell.” Sam snapped.
As he stood there he wondered what Dean's plan was for Cas' not-birthday.
“It’s Cas, he was asking for updates. I told him this was a bust so we’re on our way back.” Dean explained as he walked back over. He scrunched the paper he’d been holding as he did so, absentmindedly dropping it before sliding into the driver’s seat of the Impala.
“You know what I mean.” Dean rolled his eyes.
“No, but I think he’s in the storage room.”
“I love you.”
“What else would there be?” Dean was already feeling defensive.
“We have to tell him you overheard.” Sam looked at him, waiting for the protest to come... and it did.
Or that’s what others would say. People who weren’t Dean would think it was adorable.
“Yeah, yeah.”
So they had been flirting! Did that count as cheating? Jack didn’t know much about the topic. He decided that he’d have to go find out more back at the bunker. As he drafted his plan, he was snapped out of his thoughts again by Dean’s voice.
Sam quirked a brow, looking between the two of them. Dean seemed anxious, however, Cas seemed to be beaming. So it couldn’t be anything too bad. He decided that meant it was okay to mess with Dean some more.
Hope yall enjoyed this lighthearted little thing xoxo.
Cas made a face. “Yes. While we didn’t agree on the first one, even I have to admit that wasn’t the most welcoming establishment.”
Dean’s heart rate quickened. He wasn’t completely sure what this meant but he had his suspicions. He hadn’t exactly been repressing how he felt about Cas lately. It was constantly in the forefront of his mind. But surely that was no danger to him. Wanting Cas around could be seen as friendly, longing didn’t have to mean anything more as far as Cas knew.
Cas paused for a moment, before shaking his head and continuing on in a rush.
At that Sam quirked an eyebrow in frustration. Dean didn’t bother finishing the sentence, even he knew there was no use.
Waves of guilt used to wash over him whenever those thoughts would permeate his mind back in the day. He’d chastise himself, remind himself that this was his job, his purpose.
Dean’s frown washed away, and he straightened up. “Oh. Um- Good. Nice. Thanks.” He nodded awkwardly. For some reason, he felt more nervous. It’s not like he hadn’t had dinner with Cas before. Hell, they’d spent more time together in the previous weeks than they had in a long time. But still, he couldn’t help the unexplainable nerves.
At that Dean’s heart melted.
“Pretty sweet huh?” Dean huffed out with an awkward laugh.
“You don’t even legally exist Cas, how are you-”
Dean was starting to get a bit antsy and impatient, to say the least. Sure, he could just tell Sam, but at this point, it was about the principle of the matter. That’s what he told himself as he wandered towards the map table one night, determined to get Sam to crack once and for all.
“The manuscript says that a similar ritual can be us-“
Dean looked down at the ring in his hands. And then looked up at the ceiling helplessly, wiping at his face. “I forgot- I forgot to get down on one knee.” He mumbled, groaning dramatically.
That all too familiar guilt panged in his chest again. He had been making amends since, but it still ate him up inside. The guilt of not just recent events but how he’d treated Jack for a long time.
While the stress of defeating Chuck and keeping their son alive was eating at them it surely wouldn’t endanger Cas to have this.
Dean wasn’t sure how Cas was going to respond to that, and he himself was seconds away from telling Sam to mind his business before the angel spoke up with no hesitation.
“Sam says he’ll be back later today. It was a simple salt and burn.” Cas relayed formally, placing his phone back into his pocket.
He furrowed his brow in contemplation. As far as he knew you weren’t allowed to flirt with people if you were married.
At that, Dean just huffed out a dry laugh, looking away in the direction Cas had left.
“You’re right. I’ll- I’ll talk to Sam.”
He swallowed down the lump in his throat as he looked away, back out at the road.
Cas snapped him out of his thoughts by speaking up again. “What were you going to say about the restaurant?” He questioned, genuinely curious.
“Cas, wait.” Dean rubbed his eyes for a second, it was now or never.
He rolled his eyes and tuned back into their thoughts for a moment. He was realising it was something he could focus in and out of, though he couldn’t block out the loud ones. No matter how much he tried. And- Oh god.
Dean clutched at his stomach as he doubled over in his chair, laughter echoing throughout the room. He glanced up at Cas when he finally began to regain composure.
By the time he pulled up to the third orchid nursery, Dean’s head was swimming with afterimages of flowers and details the eager old ladies in the shops had been happy to load him down with. The flowers all kind of looked the same to him and he found himself frustrated and a little out of sorts as he pulled up the gravel drive to the third place and parked in front of the fairly dilapidated looking greenhouse. The ancient wooden sign hanging over the door was almost unreadable, but Dean could make out enough letters to match his scribbled note of “Devereaux’s”.
They’d escaped Dad’s wrath and scored weekend food money with the successful lie, and when Dad had showed up to collect them on Tuesday morning he and Sammy had kept the new cell phone and Dean’s new job a secret with practiced ease. This new town Dad had dragged them to had a High School that he was supposed to be attending, same as Sammy, but more importantly, and more relevant to Dean’s current interests, barely two miles from here, it had a University.
“She taught me something else, something I didn’t get to do with you - “
I didn’t ask first, I’m sorry -”
Castiel gulped, cleared his throat guiltily.
Dean flushed darker and took a deep breath. He was going to have to admit he wanted it.
“I thought
Dean slammed Baby’s trunk shut over his duffel, stepping around to slip into her driver’s side seat, still searching for anything to say beyond, “Would you like some pie?”
Chapter Mood: Uncomfortable, then, *I* think, satisfying. I'm told I nailed it, which is patently horrifying.
” Dean’s forehead wrinkled in confusion as Castiel stared at him in surprise.
“Whenever you want, Cas. This mean you’re gonna pull a Michael Jordan for me?”
José beamed, and accepted the high five he was due with pride. Castiel watched Dean count out twice the amount José said his Mom wanted. “For your Mom,” Dean said sternly, as José nodded seriously.  “And tell her I’m sorry these clothes are so bad. Tell her I said I owe her one.” He handed the plastic shopping bag over with an apologetic smile and José wrinkled his nose at the smell. Dean slipped him a fiver. “For the delivery service.” José nodded again, now grinning ear to ear, and scampered back out the door, wad of cash firmly gripped in one fist, the plastic bag in the other.
Castiel’s face went conspiratorially delighted in an instant, and he leaned forward and whispered back “
Sam picked up the thread after a beat. “Manuel listened to Dean spill our life story and looked at him reaaally carefully, then he looked at me - I’ve never felt more naked in my life Cas, not even when I was actually naked - and I guess he decided to let us live.”
“When I panic. My palms sweat.” Castiel shrugged, half smiled. “It’s the weirdest thing, I’ve literally pissed myself in terror, but sweaty palms are still the thing I hate the most. Shall we?” He held his open hand towards the door, the question hanging in the air, and Dean couldn’t stop himself from staring at his hand, imagining it sweaty. Dean grinned guiltily as Castiel followed his glance and his eyes narrowed.
“Dean.”
“Wh- What?”
Dean felt the familiar weight of Castiel’s glance as it landed and looked his way with a smile and a wave. In that half-second of distraction Diego managed to break free of Dean’s cover, hollering, “Sam! I’m open!”  Sam made the pass to Diego in a flash, and Dean was left scrambling to catch up as everyone headed up the court en masse, Dean leaping heroically out in front of Diego to block his shot and earning a bodyslam that dropped him to the asphalt for his trouble. Dean’s interference caused Diego’s jump shot to hit the rim but it went into the basket anyway, to a chorus of various cheers and groans. Dean groaned as Diego extended him a hand to haul him to his feet, and the entire court looked over to measure up the gringo who had distracted Dean from more important pursuits. Castiel threw his hands up in apology as Dean laughed and apologized.
Sam laughed. “I’m not offended, Cas, he can’t think about anything else right now either. I’ll have him call you whenever he fiiinally gets out of there.”
Cas. Come on, I’ll show you.”
“I - I owed you - I didn’t give you, uh, you didn’t get to -”
This time, when Dean's lips spread into a slow, delighted smile, Castiel smiled back.
Castiel relented; he didn’t mean to be a tease, exactly, and that boy yearning to meet his approval had certainly been him twenty years ago. Rejection always hurt, but he could soften the blow. He smiled kindly as he shook his head gently no, stepped towards the boy as his hopeful face fell to lean down and murmur quietly in his ear.
“ and came up entirely dry.
Castiel's eyes were suddenly wide and black, his body lithely flowing up the length of Dean's body so he could lace his fingers through Dean's hair, leaning down to growl in Dean's ear over the sound of Dean’s helpless moan, every hair on Dean's body rippling upright to join his cock, already so hard it hurt.
Need a Friend?
“What do you mean?”
Sam’s fond teasing smile hanging in the air like the Cheshire Cat,
Can you
<3 <3 <3
Castiel swallowed guiltily and finally managed to avert his eyes as Dean didn't bother to shut the bathroom door before pulling off his boxers and tossing those into the same laundry pile by the bed.
“RIGHT.”  Dean jumped up to wash his hands, Castiel grinning and following suit to get the delicious grease off his fingers.

is for you to do whatever you want to me, whenever you want.” He grinned wickedly as Castiel’s cock threatened to bore a hole in his hip, and rocked against Cas a little, smugly watched Castiel’s eyelashes flutter and his eyes roll back in his head for a second.
“Only the first one hurts, after that they taste fine. And they are

and that the angels - the ones with a sense of humor anyway - find it hilarious. Beyond that, I never cared enough to find out. Is that something that would help?”
"Ooh, that's a really good idea." Sam's face went into study mode as he typed furiously into his laptop. He made several notes, then tore the sheet out and handed it to Dean. "Here are the numbers and addresses of the three nearest orchid nurseries, go make some calls. Or drive out and take a look, I
“Oh come on, Dean,” Sam muttered, scratching at his own notebook. “It’s not a bathroom wall. Besides, that’s gonna make them think you’re looking to meet up in person.”
“I thought you said you aren’t supposed to watch porn in a room with other guys,” Castiel accused, the alcohol apparently already gone from his tongue, and Dean stared at him, his mouth falling open.
Dean nodded guiltily, doodling dicks in the margins.
me to have it. Do you like gardening?”
Anna grinned and punched Dean lightly in the arm. “I invented you a work emergency. Castiel, I just remembered I forgot to tell you to train Dean on one of the new features that he needs to be able to talk about in one of his meetings tomorrow. Go on, get the hell out of here.” Her grin turned wicked. “Teach Dean something.”
Dean squeezed his thighs together and earned a surprised yelp. He grinned and relaxed, fought inertia and ignored the mess to flip himself over so he could look Castiel in the eyes.
Dean looked up from the bowl where he was currently cutting butter and flour into pea-sized chunks with a pair of butter knives. Castiel hadn’t had a pie plate but he had a takeaway round aluminum salad container in the recycling that Dean had washed and reshaped, buttered and floured, and it was sitting on a cookie sheet on the counter, waiting for the crust he needed to roll out.
“That’s what
Castiel smiled softly, thumbed in his reply.
“I can help.”
Castiel stared at Dean’s fingers. “I’m sorry I lied,” he apologized softly. “I was upset when you left early even though I have no right to any claim on your time.” He studied Dean’s hand, his eyes downcast and his forehead creased in distress. “I didn't want you to know.”
“No.” Castiel’s tone was clipped and his mouth formed a flat line.
“Let’s see: Thank you very much, the other fish are named Oscar and Henry, respectively, watering needs depend on ambient humidity, I had the bench delivered through the garage - there’s a door under the deck -  and yes, it’s the same water, it helps with aeration. A hidden pump and piping system circulates the water through a filter, up to the fountain, and it returns to the pond by gravity. Did I miss anything?”
Castiel practically looked panicked, his eyes huge, his breath coming in short, sharp gasps.
Dean snapped back to the present, looked up at Castiel’s crinkled forehead from his slumped position sitting on his heels.
Castiel’s face remained entirely innocent, but his eyes twinkled. “Ahh, wonderful. I make it a point to try to to anticipate a guest’s every desire. I trust you found everything to your… satisfaction?”
“Oh Shit. Thanks, I didn’t even think about it” Dean groaned, dismayed. His face registered almost physical pain - although whether from Castiel’s reminder or his car there was no telling.
“Are you sure?” Castiel asked, his eyes searching Dean’s face.
Castiel?”
“You didn’t tap for breath, Dean.”
“You okay Cas?” asked Sam. Castiel swallowed the hint of longing curling around his consciousness, clamped it down hard. His family had abandoned him for being different and he didn’t need them. Besides, he was making new friends right now, and that felt good. He smiled at Sam. “I’m okay Sam,” he answered, “thanks.”  Sam was still looking at him, his brow furrowed with empathy, and Castiel found himself adding, in a small voice he barely recognized, “I still miss my family sometimes, even though I hate them.” He blinked away some sand or something that was suddenly in his eyes and found himself in a casual sidearm bro-sandwich, Sam’s arm around his shoulders on one side and Dean leaning into his other side. The brothers were silent while Castiel hid his face in his hands and gulped air. Only when he had collected himself enough to uncover his face did they step away, Sam smoothly reclaiming his spot on the couch to loud protest noises from Dean, which lightened the mood, got a laugh from Castiel, and no more was said about the spectre of loss as it hung, brooding, in the air above them.
I stand by what happens next a thousand percent. :-D
Dean hung the suits with the others on the makeshift suit rack, and crossed the room to rummage under the tiny kitchen sink, triumphantly pulling out a plastic shopping bag. He stuffed the clothes he’d left hanging over the kitchen chair into the shopping bag and reached for his wallet where he’d dumped it on the table.
“Thank you Castiel,” she murmured, then she had a thought. “Do you need help with how to explain your PTSD to your new partner? I have several pamphlets with ways to start the conversation, or you could just give him the pamphlets to read?”
Castiel snorted and retorted smoothly “In my day we showed our elders some respect...” he raised an eyebrow and added “or they showed us the back of their hand.”
and he wanted Anna to understand the magnitude of his joy, so he said
Dean couldn’t look more embarrassed, for really real now.
Castiel’s breathy little gasp was electrifying, and Dean froze, gripping his slippery cock tightly for a second to catch his breath.
.” Dean answered huskily, his voice cracking as he uttered the words.
, Cas.”
The thought gave Dean fierce pleasure he would never in a million years fess up to, a deep satisfaction curling in his chest as he leaned into the kiss for real, his hands sliding down the inside of Castiel’s shirt to untuck it, refusing to admit to himself how good the sharp planes of Castiel’s abdomen felt under his hands, wrapping them instead around behind Cas to grab his ass and pull their hips together, terry cloth rubbing against wool, the rock hard length of his erection shoving against Castiel’s groin as he pushed his tongue into Cas’s mouth, the taste of ozone in his mouth now, and something else; something new, something exotic and intoxicating.
Dean grinned and shook his head, cutting in to comment,  “Those kids should have won an Emmy or something. Big Man too, but damn, those kids blew me away.”
Castiel, it turned out, was incredible. He was fast, he was agile, and he could sink a shot from practically mid-court. The third time Castiel dribbled low and feinted around Sam to pass to Dean for a successful layup Sam threw up his hands in exasperation and cried foul. “We have to split those assholes up!” Sam hollered in frustration, “Pit them against each other! I’m out!”  There was general frustrated agreement as Sam repaired to his gatorade in disgust, throwing Castiel’s shirt to him in a wad. Castiel looked to Big Man, who was watching from the shade of the concrete balcony. Big Man nodded his permission for this changeup and strode back onto the court to replace Castiel on team Skins while Castiel dragged his erstwhile clean shirt down over his dripping torso.
“I’m not lau-“ His own escaped chuckle interrupted his sentence. “I’m not laughing Dean, it’s just. I mean. I thought we all knew and were pretending not to that you two are obsessed with each other”
“You know Dean. As an angel I had some sense of human emotions and feelings. However, I don’t think I ever truly comprehended them in their fullest form. But now- Now as a human, those feelings are all so overwhelming, so clear.” He spoke almost reverently.
“What?” Sam questioned defensively.
Cas sighed. “Me handing you a beer isn’t going to kill me. You didn’t have to leap away like that.”
“Whatever you say babe.” Sam continued to chuckle under his breath, while this time Cas patted Dean’s shoulder reassuringly.
Cas eyed the first text, slightly confused. He decided to save that conversation for later when Dean could explain it to him face to face.
“We’ve been looking Sammy. There’s nothing in the lore. Jacks gone. We can’t summon it here. He’s-“ Dean managed to get out, no harshness or edge to his voice. It was just. Empty.
“It might go better than you think.”
“Dean, I’m not stuck with you. I enjoy time with you- I-” Cas sighed.
After what seemed like a lifetime of deliberation, Cas finally, tentatively, spoke. “They may have, but- I did- I did correct them.”
“Yeah but they think we are! So let’s- ya know- make up!” Dean had exclaimed. He’d assumed that would be it, and so they’d walked back into the bunker after another set-up, acting as chummy as ever.
“I did try telling him that, there are a lot of breakable objects here.”
He glanced at his phone for the fifth time since Sam had started explaining the hunt he’d found. Something about potential werewolves... or shapeshifters... maybe he’d said vampires. Whatever.
And then he heard John Winchesters voice echo through Dean’s head.
Jack glanced back and forth between the two, frowning slightly. Was this flirting? He’d seen it on TV a lot, but he couldn’t always tell in real life. He tried going back over the bits and pieces of their conversation he’d listened in on earlier, but that didn’t give him any more clarity.
“Didn’t realise you’d end up being such a Led Zeppelin fan.” He continued with the same feigned lightness.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah-“
Sam sighed.
“Don’t lie to me Sam.” Cas dejectedly sat down on the bed.
“Um. You know what don’t worry about it.” Dean responded anxiously. Now that his brother was standing in front of him, this conversation seemed like a terrible idea.
Dean just blinked back at him. That didn’t help Cas’ worried expression. Though his worry seemed to shift slightly as he glanced at his coworker, who smiled teasingly at the two of them.
“I love you Cas.” It was barely a whisper.
“You guys done?” Dean imitated in a high pitched voice. Sam rolled his eyes.
“Because- I-“ he swallowed “-why do you think Cas?” Dean half whispered. His voice sounded choked. He couldn’t understand why his eyes were watering in that moment. Why did he feel like he was drowning? Why was he so scared?
Dean focused on parking. He didn’t answer Cas’ question straight away, taking a moment to think.
“What were you two talking about?” Cas immediately questioned. He’d clearly been wondering for a while.
Cas only looked more confused.
He was back an hour later, pie in hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
He came down the stairs and casually dropped two six-packs onto the table, before slouching into a chair next to Cas.
“I have to say, that was a great date.”
That damn burning in his eyes again, and the closing of his throat. The back of his neck dampened slightly. His breathing quickened as the room seemed to get smaller and smaller.
Cas huffed out a small laugh.
Then, he looked over at Cas, and they shared a look. Sam tilted his head curiously, Dean had suddenly seemed to grow nervous. His expression was tight.
Cas’ hands found his hair this time, not tugging but gripping onto it slightly. He was slightly clumsy, however, all but made up for it with intensity.
Dean picked up his phone, and hit some buttons. It rung for a few moments before a groggy but frantic voice answered.
“You’re right” Dean replied, now serious.
They’d forgotten Sam’s shopping again.
With that the moment was gone.
“Are you going to keep calling me that?”
“We could pick a random day, or hell we could even share birthdays, he can have mine.”
A disgruntled, disheveled looking Sam greeted him when he opened it.
“What? No. No he can’t know that I-“
Dean smiled playfully at her, tilting his head. “Really?”
At some point, the scraping of Cas’ chair as he stood up drew Dean out of his thoughts. He seemed to have missed most of Cas and Sam’s conversation.
Sam had been trying not to eavesdrop onto their thoughts but at this point, he was getting frustrated. So he listened to their conversation through each other’s minds, trying to not intrude on their actual thoughts too much.
Sam choked down his giggles and nodded at Dean to continue.
The only plus side had been their friendly waitress who’d given them recommendations of places she liked going to with her girlfriend. ‘A lot friendlier’ she had said. He found it strange she’d taken such a liking to them at first, but ultimately he’d come around.
“Dean, it’s okay. Like I said. It’s not like we need to worry about it anytime soon. If ever”. Cas replied sadly.
Dean ruffled the kid's hair, earning him a chuckle. “I love it Jack.”
Deans heart sank. And it only dropped further as Castiel explained to him why he was leaving.
The car was silent for a while after that. Nothing but the sound of the engine droning on in the background of his thoughts.
Cas and Dean exchanged a quick glance before returning their gazes to him.
“Also maybe next time you use my computer to take multiple ‘Am I Gay?’ quizzes online and then to read articles on bisexuality, delete the history if you don’t want me to know.” Sam smirked at him, eyebrow raised.
Then Castiel looked back up, and the weight of that thought and the blue eyes upon him became too much. He backed away to the safety of his beer.
The four of them stood in silence for a moment before Dean spoke out again.
His brother rolled his eyes dramatically at him and began to sluggishly walk out of the room. “Fine. Whatever.”
Dean could feel the potential panic simmering in the recesses of his mind. But he pushed it back and allowed himself the moment. If Cas was so certain, then Dean would choose to believe him. That’s all he really could do until they defeated Chuck and figured out how to make Cas human.
Dean started to interject, but Jack cut him off before he could get the first word out.
"He's got you, Dean. He's going to get through it." Cas finally responded, walking up to stand next to him against the counter. The tension in him settled slightly, the closeness providing some sort of comfort.
After they’d saved the world this last time around Dean had promised himself, he was going to be the father he knew he could be. The one he’d been to Sammy, one nothing like his own dad. Jack deserved it.
Dean nodded but didn't respond. It was quiet for a moment.
Dean felt his cheeks flush. Damn her.
“Okay, yeah.”
Jack looked over at Sam conspiratorially. At first Sam was confused. However, after a moment it clicked.
“Hey.” Dean stated, louder than necessary to get Castiel’s eyes back on him. “Right now we gotta keep you safe, so no over the top happiness or whatever. But. We’re gonna get you out of this deal, okay? I- I can’t wait to get you out of this deal.” He tried to sound firm but the last phrase came out soft.
“I mean- the other two are on their way.”
What he didn’t expect next, was for Cas to snort out a laugh. He whipped his head up to see the other man holding back a smile.
Sam chuckled as he left. “Sweet dreams Dean” he replied in a deep voice, attempting to imitate a certain angel.
Jack was not going to be happy.
*Click*
“Yes,  I was serious about retiring. But only if it’s together.” Cas gazed at him intently, as if trying to decipher where Dean was going with the conversation after this. Or perhaps, trying to seem that way; subduing his hopes so that they wouldn't be painted across his face too blatantly.

“I need you to decide,
“Would I be correct in surmising these ladies have last names, Cas?”
“Sam can you give us a minute?” he asked very quietly, without taking his eyes from Dean’s face.
was a language he was fluent in, one that didn't change substantially over time no matter how rusty he got. Alex had seen him watching Dean and said nothing, beyond this brazen blackmail of course. It was a fair cop, and well played to boot. Castiel shucked his tee without argument, balling it up to toss it onto the hood of his car, and quirked Alejandro an eyebrow that said, in no uncertain terms, “Like what you see?”
Dean dropped the charade and sagged.  “Yeah, I think I’m made after next week, week after at the latest, Sammy.”  The young man was looking at Dean but motioned his eyes pointedly towards Castiel, and Dean sighed. “It’s OK. He knows. Sam, this is Castiel from work. I told him. Castiel, my brother, Sam.”
“I know. But you got all the shots and stuff and the paperwork is in. They won't know it’s lapsed until the next quarter, and by then I’ll get us enough money to pay the school for theirs. Okay?”
“Uh, East Side, straight down the 101 to the exit just past the intersection with 280, near King and Story. Do you know it?  Wait, am I anywhere remotely on your way?”
Zachariah glanced at a different sheet of paper on his desk and then back up at Castiel “But, Castiel
to get to come!”
He ate his pie sitting at the kitchen table, Castiel’s attention caressing him, making his chest tight and his cheeks flush while Castiel’s eyes danced to see it. Castiel really did just watch, following the fork with his eyes and watching Dean’s lips as the fork went into his mouth, watching his lips as he chewed, until Dean couldn’t stand it anymore and handed him the fork, blushing furiously.
That actually got a snort from Zachariah and a bit of a smile as he stared at Castiel calculatingly. “I feel you there,” he muttered. He steepled his fingers for a moment, considering the men standing at attention in front of him.
“If possible, yes. I anticipated feeling your neurons firing, and giving your body pleasure with my hands while I possessed you -”
Castiel drove home in his Old Lady Lincoln, purring like a kitten now because of the kind hands in the dangerous neighborhood where Sam and Dean had been adopted as family, to claim him in turn as one of them. Not a guest.
Dean,” Castiel breathed. “I am
Dean gasped, Castiel’s words landing in his gut and pulsing there as heat, everything betraying him by twitching, and Castiel’s lip lifted in a snarl of success as he slooowly pulled his finger back far enough to add a second one, sliding both in to his knuckles, lubricant dripping down his hand and onto the sheets as Dean tried to breathe but found himself groaning instead, his lips struggling to form words.
The next three chapters including this one were SOMEHOW accidentally left out when I originally published the Thanksgiving section. I had a ton going on at the time but I am still rattled by this egregious error. So these were always in the work, not added later, but they weren't always *published*, first appearing 6/29/19. I swear I am not pulling a George Lucas, these are and have always been canon for this work; think of them as a deleted scene that have been put back into the Director's cut, explaining a good dozen references down the line that will make sense now DAMMIT I AM SO FURIOUS ABOUT THIS. :-D
“ Dean’s breath made a strangled noise as he listened to Castiel’s breathing speed up, listened to him moan into the receiver.
The cashier’s name tag read “Brandon,” and Castiel remembered now that he had been the flirtatious bag boy from their Thanksgiving shopping. He stared, nonplussed, while Brandon examined his items with a practiced eye, remarked, “You forgot salsa. And guacamole makings if you’re into that, and onions, although I approve forgetting the onions if your boyfriend is staying over.” Brandon shuddered at the thought of onion breath while Castiel got over his surprise to examine the ingredients with dismay.
Castiel’s groan just as he hung up had Dean wondering if he was starting over from the top, but he’d have to wait until tomorrow to do any more practicing choking up on his own bat. Or Cas’s bat, for that matter.
He made it, just barely, crying out just as the phone rang, and answering it on the fourth ring with his left hand, his breath still short and his body still rippling with aftershocks of pleasure.
“I got this one!” Dean exclaimed, jumping up, clearly delighted for a homework break. “Wanna come, Cas?”
This was impossibly hot, the hottest thing that had ever happened to him, maddeningly, desperately, painfully arousing, and he was technically alone in a room with his hand. He didn’t dare touch himself again, he was too close, so he took long, slow breaths and strained his ears to hear what Castiel might be doing.
“Alright Cas, shall we make pies?”
“I - I - want
“Jack – Cas and Dean aren’t married” Sam spoke slowly, narrowing his eyes. He stepped toward Jack gently as if he were approaching a skittish animal.
Cas couldn’t think of a reason why not, though he was still hesitant, especially now that Sam was reacting oddly. He removed the tape from his pocket and tentatively passed it over to Sam who was now grinning.
“Why not man?” He stopped in place, arms gesturing out in confusion.
“Dean you-“
“Yeah, Sammy didn’t take it well. I told him though. We’re gonna find a way out of it.” Dean responded, straightening up.
“Cas.”
“So. It’s my birthday soon.” He stated once inside. Sam wasn’t sure where he was going with this, but he wondered anxiously if Dean had found out about the surprise party.
“Oh- I seemed to have put down an Enochian phrase.”
“Wait.” Before she could elaborate, Cas called out from behind Dean. Everyone turned to look at him. Billie raised a brow.
As he contemplated shifting from where he stood, his focus was pulled back to the window again. A blonde woman walked up to Cas, laughing as she whispered something in his ear. Dean felt the discomfort from prior grow, his face falling into a frown, his stance stiffening.
Then, Cas sighed. Dean sensed the man next to him shift away slightly.
At that Cas’ expression grew curious. He eyed Dean warily. “But it’s your birthday.”
“We’ll just tell him we know about the deal. Not the rest.” Sam attempted to reason.
“Well sorry for being careful,” Dean muttered not-so-quietly under his breath.
Sam looked back at him with a raised eyebrow, his expression curious. He squinted his eyes slightly as if he were hazarding some sort of guess in his mind but not saying it out loud.
“One that isn’t a snoozefest Sammy” Dean muttered, rolling his eyes. Sam pursed his lips annoyedly in response.
A thought struck him. He had agreed to that way too easily. “Wait. What kind of animals are we talking?”
Time passed. A minute, maybe an hour, maybe days, he couldn’t tell. But the rain began to beat down again, there was an electric energy in the air. He couldn’t tell if he was going crazy or if it was really there.
“Shut up.” He muttered. However, he did finally head towards the exit. Cas trailed closely behind.
He cut that thought off. He always cut thoughts like that off. They didn’t feel, safe. It felt like prodding something dangerous.
“If you were there. Then yes.”
He could sense Cas turning his head to look at him, he presumed with a squinted expression.
The brothers, Cas, and Jack all straightened up, naturally shifting closer to one another.
The boys continue to look for a way to save Jack and Cas. Dean doesn’t know how to cope.
Dean lunged forward to where they’d been standing. “Where-”
he wore a cardigan. it was maroon.
“Yeah like. Quitting all the saving the world crap. Just having a regular life.” Dean pressed on, his heart beating out of his chest. He attempted to steady his breathing.
“The Empty? I, uh- No?” Castiel sounded confused about the change in conversation.
After a few moments he reappeared at the door, making his way out the building up to the Impala. Dean got in the car wordlessly as Cas followed.
“We’ll go with you.” Dean stated, starting to make his way over to his room to grab his things.
“How are you- is that really?! I’m so happy to see you man!” He fumbled out the words over each other striding towards Cas with each, before slowly stopping.
“I agree.”
Dean doesn't get why Cas wants a job in the first place.
Three dots immediately appeared on the screen. He watched, waiting patiently for Dean’s response.
“I did ask him if he was flirting with her, but not about Cas.” Jack considered for a moment. “Should I have?”
Dean frowned for a moment, then shrugged as if to say ‘fair enough'. That was definitely early on, and knowing that even back then Cas cared about him in that way- he couldn’t think too hard about it.
Cas decided he would save it as his contact picture later. It was a nice image. The hat seemed to suit Dean in a way Cas wasn’t sure it did himself.
“Fine.” Cas paused, wracking through his brain for a moment. He finally seemed to land on an example, as his demeanour changed. He straightened up slightly, glancing around the room and taking in a breath.
They made their way out of Jack’s room, down the hallway, and towards the map table. Dean and Cas were still seated where they had been before, and were talking among themselves quietly. They stopped as they saw Jack and Sam approach. Sam could swear they shared a scared look of sorts as they saw him and Jack walk up.
“Nope.” He responded too quickly.
Dean frowned slightly. The kid looked way too happy, almost conspiratorial.
Dean and Cas seemed to be preoccupied.
I’m nervous about posting this one but I hope y’all like the direction it’s going in 🥺 Enjoy and have a lovely day xx
“Yes.”
Sam continued on in a rush.
He sighed. He was tired. He was too damn tired. “Jack- if you can hear me. Please. I- I need him. Sam’s got Eileen, you’re off being God or whatever, and- he’s gone- he’s gone and I can’t move on.” He closed his eyes, tears were brimming, but these days that was a constant for him.
“I didn’t realise you- I didn’t realise it affected you so badly.” Cas’ voice sounded raspier than usual, his eyes pooled.
Dean walked back to the Impala where Sam waited while chastising himself internally. He was feeling a little sorry for himself.
“What? No kid, no that was uh- That was no big deal.”
“Ah, you were drawn to the Lapis Lazuli, a powerful stone.”
“Hah. It’s no big deal pal.” His voice was unconvincingly gruff and jokey.
He sighed to himself and glanced away from Jack’s sleeping form, back over to the road, attempting to focus on it. However, due to the thought of emotions and being open, his mind began to veer to the fourth man in the car.
“Yeah. I think- I think that’s what made it hurt more.” The guilt which flashed across the angel’s face had Dean continuing on in a hurry.
“Dean and I. We’re engaged.” He stated softly, smiling up at him.
“You know I don’t eat right?”
The boys talk to Billie. Castiel pushes Dean away.
He glanced over at Dean. Dean who was hyper-focused on the coffee in his hand right now. Despite his casual demeanour though, Sam could hear all the ramblings in his head, and even worse sense the ooey gooey feelings he was radiating right now.
“I thought you- I enjoy our drives- But- Do you not want to-”
“I’m gonna go now.” He glanced around. “Uh- Just remember that this is a communal space.” He finished before starting to make his way out.
Dean sighed. When Sam continued to look at him expectantly he caved.
At that Jack and Sam whipped their heads over to look at Dean. Cas was nodding next to him as if he already knew what he was about to say.
“What about Scrabble?” Jack suggested as he squinted over at the pile of board games in the corner of the room, carefully considering each one.
A gentle breeze washed over him, reminding him of where he was, and the task at hand.
“Oh wow. This is. This is great.” He smiled up at Cas, reading the handwritten label on the tape.
“I know that!” He finally exclaimed.
Dean blinked back at him. Oh.
“Oh- Uh.” Dean stepped up to Cas as he clicked on his phone. Eventually, standing in front of him and holding it forward.
“This is- You’re joking right?” Dean asked, his voice strained. He looked like he was going to bolt out the motel room door. Or pass out.
“What does that have to do with anything Cas.” He asked, his voice wavering.
“I’ve told you. It’s a part of the human experience.” Cas huffed out petulantly.
“Dean.” Cas replied, exasperated. The list of questions had been never ending and Castiel’s response of ‘I don’t know’ unchanging.
Swiftly, as the other man’s exterior began to waver, Cas stood up from his end of the table, moving over to the seat next to Dean. He placed a hand gently on his cheek. It was immediately covered by Dean’s. They let the silence linger for a moment.
It’s not like any of them could’ve stopped him if they wanted otherwise. Him being all-powerful at the time and all. But Dean had to admit, he was relieved. The kid was only four years old; he had so much living to do still. He didn’t deserve to be burdened with the responsibility of- well- everything.
Just as Jack was out of sight, Castiel and Dean appeared before Sam. He jumped slightly as he turned to face them.
Jack happily shuffled in his seat and reached over to grab his age-appropriate ginger ale from the table.
But then, there was Cas sitting by himself at the table, mixtape in hand. Dean inwardly swore.
“Come outside with me for a sec” Sam gestured out the warehouse door.
Sam barely glanced up from the book laid out in front of him on the map table. “Okay. Have fun.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I didn’t think you’d want me around after I-. I appreciated you praying to me, those were the best moments of my time in the Empty, and then heaven... but I didn’t think-“
“Oh. Nora, my manager. She was uh- She told me my-” He coughed before continuing. “She told me that my friend-” He emphasised the word “-was watching me.”
“It’s clearly not nothing man.” With that Dean stepped up closer to him. Staring intensely at the man in front of him. Almost wishing that he could see right into him and understand what was inside his head.
“I don’t know, but the kids been acting weird today.”
“Sorry?” Cas asked. Dean was keeping his eyes on the road, but he was certain Cas was tilting his head at that moment.
“I enjoyed the songs, though that may be because I know you enjoy them. I thought it was a helpful gesture to try and broaden my musical tastes.” Cas responded. He stared at Dean inquisitorially.
Dean attempted to agree, to convince himself, but he couldn’t stop the worry simmering.
“That’s not what I was- I was talking about you being-”
“I- In the movies I’ve watched that’s what it means when you make someone a mixtape.” The statement coming out more like a question.
“Dean” was all Cas replied, clearly frustrated with the conversation.
“I didn’t say like, by the way.”
“I still don’t understand why she asked you to babysit.”
“You’re welcome by the way!” Sam called out to their retreating forms.
Dean’s brow furrowed, he nodded slightly as he considered the words, before looking up at Cas.
The what now?
Shit. The door had been slightly ajar, he should’ve known his presence was no secret.
“Ahh n-” Dean began to refuse.
Though, maybe he would like a little more time with Cas, and the Gas N Sip was robbing him of that. Maybe that factored into it still.
“You’re right.” He responded, his tone serious all of a sudden. His face was blank.
“Seriously, it’s fine.” And to make sure he got that it really was, Dean added on.
Cas looked at him glumly. He’d clearly been stressing about this for a while.
As if on cue, as soon as Lee was out of sight, Castiel’s phone began to ring.
Dean couldn’t help but grin again, this time more so at how adorable Cas looked. Like a grumpy teddy bear, he thought to himself.
The call ended.
Jack and Sam stayed seated at the table, though they’d stopped pretending to be paying attention to the laptops in front of them a while back.
“Well, I may as well start at the beginning.” He stated plainly. “When I rebelled for you before the final seal was broken. I was in love with you then.” He glanced around the room casually, though it was clear the admission was anything but casual.
Sam sighed up at the ceiling. He just wanted to get back to his book.
Cas only shrugged stiffly in response.
“What is it Dean?” Sam asked accusatorially.
Dean frowned, turning his head over to Sam. He knew that. It’s not like he was stopping Cas from having friends. Sure, he liked spending time with him, and sometimes that made him a little possessive. But that was a perfectly normal reaction for a best friend to have.
“I- uh” Cas composed his confused self, and sighed. “I know he doesn’t Jack. And that’s okay. I’m glad to even be a part of his life. But, he sees me as a brother, he’s told me many times.” Cas replied tenderly. But he could hear the ache underlying it all.
