"Gaoaza," Steve muttered just loud enough for Bucky to hear and begin laughing at him. He braced himself against the pain and pushed himself to complete another push up. Seven.
surprised to find him on the terrace of all places, sitting at the table with a sketchpad open, pencil scratching away at paper. Bucky was happy to see it, as it had been far too long since Stefen had taken the time to draw anything. He only wished it wasn’t the dangerous endeavor of passing coded messages that had brought it back again.
“Farkas has collected a tidy little sum, but he would have gained much more had you stayed there for life.” Pavlok pointed out unnecessarily and Tony grunted uncharitably in reply. It was hard enough coming to terms with Farkas letting go of a fortune seemingly for Tony’s best interest. He did not know what to make at all of his father setting aside a trust for his future this way. A future neither dependent on Stark Industries or touchable by Stanislov. Tony’s mother had probably put him up to it, but half a million marks was no small lump of change.
"I don't recall your uncle giving you permission to use his given name." Steve decided to say, in regards to the unusual new habit he'd noticed. At first he'd let it go, chalking it up to Natacha's desire to feel more grown up, but Péter's bought of rebellion had left him feeling far less charitable. The fact of the matter was, neither of them were grown up yet and they should remember that.
Why in God’s name the captain kept a music room and yet forbade music was beyond Tony.
Then I knew that you were here with me, with me
Steve didn’t like it, but there was no good reason to deny her (and he knew that Tony would demand a reason). He grabbed his own coat, following as she opened the door and stepped out into the fresh snow that had covered the garden walk.
Tony’s heart was beating wildly as Stefen made his goodnights and walked away.
"As their tutor I am not obligated to mind them beyond the classroom." He reminded.
Steve wanted to ask the woman if she were insane. He must have lost control of his expression because he could feel Charlotte tense against him and saw the way Frau Greer and her circle of clucking hens drew back, as if he were growing larger and more threatening right before their eyes of them.
“Time for bed” he announced to several groans of protests. In Tony’s arms Maria just blinked with a tired yawn, watching to see what events might play out and he smiled, standing with some difficulty.
Prince Loki didn’t say anything but Steve felt a prickle go up his spine and looked up to find the dark haired prince staring coldly at him. Thor might think highly of him but Steve got the feeling the brother was going to be a harder sell.
Instead of answering Tony stepped backward into the room on silent feet and Stefen followed, steps measured and slow, closing the door behind himself with a quiet snick.
Thank god. Steve took a shaky breath, feeling slightly overwhelmed. It took several moments for him to regain his footing. Damn but they were lucky no one had come to see what was taking them so long. They were mad to be touching each other like this out in the open. Bucky was right. All his good sense left his head when it came to Tony.
Steve didn’t know her name. Had she told him and he’d forgotten? Or had she already learned names meant nothing here. Only numbers.  Subject U-1610.
“Have you gone mad?!” Hammer interjected, looking completely scandalized. “Tarnish the captains good name by associating with known radicals! He won’t have it! He’ll be furious if you even suggest it. Nobody in this household is to even look in their direction.”
"What do you think Buck, rabbit stew?" Tony was surprised to hear Stefen offer. He couldn’t resist turning slightly to look back at the captain with a raised brow.
It had given him hope once. A reason to long for the future, when he could be free of the abbey for good. The world had seemed better then, ready and waiting with arms open.
Neither of them spoke again for ages, but he thought he saw her eyes blinking in the dark as she watched him not sleep.
He wasn’t just a stupid boy fighting off boredom in an old stable anymore. He was building a boat that Stefen and his friends would escape in. Risk their lives in. Fight the Reich in. Twice as fast as anything out there wasn’t good enough any longer.
“This isn’t one of our gentleman's night’s after all.” The man said with a wink of hazel eyes and Charlotte jumped on Captain Khalmmers rescue as if he’d offered her absolution.
“Yes, a very good thing. Minding your brother is a virtue as old as Cain and Able. It's the brother who doesn't mind that you have to watch out for.” Stefen was looking at him as if Tony were some sort of miracle happening right before his eyes and Tony felt his mouth soften into a smile. He winked at him before going on.
“French,” she interjected with a gleam almost like lust in her eyes. It was the most enthusiastic he'd ever seen her be so of course he couldn’t resist teasing her.
(gypsy) that seemed to be their worst offense. After all, a little petty theft and a public brawl was just a wild night down at the pub for one man and a criminal offense for another.
But those were words Tony knew would not fall on fertile ground. It was a soldier’s creed, to die for others and in that at least, Stefen was no different from his comrades.
“ Are you mad?” She whispered after some time, unable to understand his strange mood.
Tony highly doubted that.
, which look like little worms.” Tony wiggled his fingers in the girls face and she giggled, ducking behind her sister. “The females drop their eggs close to where the ants build their nests. Who remembers why?”
Agent Holmes didn’t need to say that the same risk applied to Tony Stark, nor did he need to say any more plainly for either of them to get the message. Tony Stark could take his chances with the tribunal if he liked. Stefen Rogers would not be wise to try. Tony clenched his teeth together, simmering with rage. SIS had known all along that Stefen would be arrested if he stepped foot in London, and they had kept him ignorant of that fact on purpose to ensure he agreed to their mission. He was a captive now. Holmes was just politely showing him who held the key to the cage.
More worrying, there was nothing to suggest that Steve lived there either… as if he had counted himself among the dead.
"He told me women are supposed to like older men." She replied and at the face Tony made she laughed. “He probably thinks I fancy you.”
Anamarie's whisper came back to him and the question she'd asked him. Was he the kind of person who acted on knowing what it meant to be a good man, or did he just wish on stars?
Steve tensed and Charlotte turned her head from the window as if sensing it and offered him a slightly amused half smile.
“Very good.
Tony watched those powerful arms as they rose and fell in quick breast stroke, watched his strong back supporting James, Artur or whichever child had won his attention that moment. He watched and watched, stomach tightening with a strange discomfort.
But Stefen was a father, and that night Tony was going to make sure he remembered it.
Johann, still sore with Péter for calling him out in front of the girls in Vienna, seemed determined to remind Péter that he was by everyone's definition an undesirable waste of space.
It was wonderful that Stefen was putting more of an effort into being there for his children, but Péter was at an age that saw much, forgot little, and was particularly good at holding grudges. He wasn’t happy with his father and even after what had turned out to be a wonderful trip (perhaps even because of it) those feelings unresolved, had few ways but to manifest in bouts of rebellion.
he pleaded silently, and Steve could see in her eyes that the message did not go unheard.
“Every time I'd make a mistake he'd be there with a bucket and brush and the longest hallways always left filthy just for me. I spent most of my twenties on my knees.”
“No, no, none of that. You were there. All of your incessant nagging about keeping my arms up in a brawl came in handy. The lollipop guild even got a few licks in. You taught us how to fight and then you came for us. Job well done soldier.”
"Péter Rogers the sheer nerve of you! You darling creature!" She threw her arms around his neck and pressed her plush mouth against his cheek in a smacking kiss, the glitter of mischief in her eyes as she laughed at his utterly stupefied expression.
“Lovemaking? I’m not delicate Tony,” Stefen scoffed, and as if to make his point for him the rise and fall of his breath pushed the rigid evidence of his lingering desire against Tony’s ass. Warmth curled in Tony’s belly, his groin tightening, and he bit back a grin.
He thought. That way if anyone decided to go looking, they’d be headed in the wrong direction.
Yes, he was much stronger than Steve had pegged him for but what had he expected, a feeble scholar with more book knowledge than people skills?
“I would have thought you’d have enough sense to quit mouthing by now,” the man muttered.
"Will Father be at home when we get there?" Artur, who was sat on the long seat opposite the seat the girls had chosen, asked halfway through the ride and the baroness had smiled sympathetically at him with a shake of her head and a wink.
"Steve, we gotta plan that don't involve him. He's a liability. On his best fucking day!"
There was no stopping her, from everything he knew about her, Janneke was a strong capable woman who knew exactly what risks she was taking, but there was a heavy feeling of regret inside him as Tony reentered the crowd. He doubted they’d see each other again after tonight, but he’d have liked to. They might have been very good friends in a different life.
He’d only narrowly dodged Dr. Earnhardt’s questions about the fortitude of his men. She and her colleagues were curious, they said, about which of his men he thought lacked natural aryan strength. He learned only after offering up some paltry statement of the men being young but promising, that one of her fellow researches, Dr. Ernst Rüdin, was advocating examination on a national scale to identify non-affected carriers of mental diseases and starting with the army as a test. He believed a propensity for mental deficiencies could be anticipated before a soldier ever saw battle simply by noting
“Have a good day, children. Listen to Herr Stark.”
“H-he was m-my friend! H-he wasn’t s-supposed to
Ssgt. Zimmerman was a compact little man with a boy’s face that did not match its serious expression. His round glasses glinted, giving him the appearance of having solar caps for eyes.
Péter nodded, the smile on his face turning sad as his shoulders drooped.
“Hey, hey, Artur relax or we’ll all be going for a swim.” Bakhuizen warned even as Tony sharply whistled for the boy’s attention and gestured for him to sit.
“I don’t want to work for the damn Reich Stefen,” Tony huffed, a tremulous smile forming on his lips. “But I won’t live under their thumb anymore either. I want to fight them. Together. I want you to help me remove the shadow they’ve cast over us and to trust that we’ll be better men for it.”
Steve swung around as Maria appeared from behind a group of women in sparkling dresses, her eyes wide with excitement. He intercepted her in one jerky motion, crouching down to her eye level, his hands clutching at her waist. Before he could say a word or chastise her for disappearing - as if it were her fault he’d failed to keep eyes on her - Maria shoved something small and wooden into his face.
Steve jerked awake, gasping for breath. Cold. He was numb with it. Weakly he struggled, but his arms, his arms... cold... snow... under…
“I suppose so,” he agreed after a moment, calculation practically coming off him in waves. And something else as well. Something far more open and vulnerable.
Tony had always hated the quiet. Too often it was just the breath before terror.
He tried to catch his breath, sluggishly rubbing sweat out of his eyes. As the room began to come back into focus around him his heart began to pick up pace again but this time it was accompanied with the sour tendrils of fear.
Yinsen had taken his own life in prison. Or so they had said. Tony had never really believed it. He’d seen the way those policemen had beaten him. It would surprise him if Yinsen had even made it to prison still breathing.
They were standing so close, Harry’s hands gripping Péter’s arms as they traded heated words that for a startling moment Tony thought he’d stumbled upon something intimate.
Péter wasn’t so sure.
Steve swerved to avoid the crumpled body lying in the path. Some of the men were beginning to drop. Hearts couldn’t take it.
They were all heavy with bottled adrenaline, like snakes sunning themselves on a rock, slow calculated but every bit ready and dangerous. Bucky reached into the duffle and made a face at the sight of the canned food it held.
He caught Tony’s hands and held them tightly.
"Of course." He answered with a squeeze of her arm. He'd bear a thousand times worse for them than a walk in the snow. Up ahead with the axe slung over his shoulder Bucky whistled sharply and the children froze. James even stopped trying to shove snow down Artur's coat as all eyes turned to him.
“Of course. We can’t have a pretty little thing like you walking home alone in the dark.” Emil said, with a leer at her skirts that he surely thought was more subtle than it was. “Tell your father I will walk you home from now on. It would be an honor to -”
He took a step forward but froze when Schmidt snapped, “Your place is where I tell you it is. Captain.” The General’s voice seemed to echo in the quiet little office.
James had become increasingly emotional as the weeks went on with no sign of the captain returning, and it hadn’t escaped Tony’s notice that with their personal letters to their father gone unanswered the boy had started melting down into a tantrum at least once a day. Tony felt for him (he could curse Rogers, and himself for ever thinking to have the children write to him in the first place) but his nerves were worn thin.
"McCabe, and no I really couldn't eat a thing, I'm so nervous it's liable to come back up."
More than once Tony had to snicker at himself and resolutely push such ridiculous thoughts out of his head. Captain Rogers cared as much about current fashion as Tony cared for morning vigil (which was not at all) and while he was surely as passionate a fellow as any under all that military regimen, he was hardly what Tony would call knowledgeable in the games that lovers played.
Artur and Steve sat and listened as Tony played on the notes rising in a swirling heart pounding rush until they finally changed, slowing to a more mellow thoughtful sound.
Weeee're back. All the apologies that this took so long. First life. Then we wanted to get it just right. Then more life. The good news is we have prepared THREE WHOLE CHAPTERS in advance to put more of a buffer between timely updates and life, so they should come steadier from now on. We hope you enjoy, and if you love us anywhere near as much as we love writing this story please feed us with a kind word or two. If  you hated it I guess you can say that too. ;)
“Where is he?” Steve asked, never taking his eyes off his daughter.
"That's not true." Péter interjected, feeling a protective urge toward his tutor. "I've seen you memorize whole books, just reading them once. You know more than some professor at some Swiss school."
"No, I mean, you see, if the children leave with a woman, their mother, my...wife, a wife with Swiss citizenship, the Reich won’t be able to touch them once they’ve gone.” He explained, swallowing thickly again before he continued. “It’s the best way. Even if I could send - I cant send them to their Grandparents and I don’t want them to be alone or end up separated. You could. You would have my name. You could look after them."
He didn’t agree with Susann, that he was a good man. He’d known better. Men who hadn’t had half his chances and who had died before they ever got even close to what they’d deserved. Then there was Steve, who got everything and didn’t deserve half of it.
She was tempted to believe that all of this could be blamed on Herr Stark, that he’d poisoned her Father’s mind somehow (just like the Führer always warned against) but she knew her Father and he’d been afraid and unhappy long before Tony had come to live with them. Natacha had always liked to watch and when you watched you saw things, heard things… and Natacha never forgot anything either.
“As if you were any good at hiding it,” Bucky snickered from the seat beside him at the breakfast table. “Why do you think I stopped talking about getting married?”
“Stevie.” Bucky greeted again, his tone short. His lips flattened into a line and he took a breath to cool his temper. He'd never been able to stomach Steve being injured. Seemed to take it as a personal insult.
Striker had once more brought up the unfortunate circumstances regarding the children’s health and made thinly veiled threats, only this time not so thin.
The fog had cleared and it had begun to snow. Sheets of it lit by the moon swirled around them in a cocoon as dangerous as it was beautiful. Bucky drove on as if he knew the way by heart, undeterred by the way the road had disappeared underneath them. They rattled along a mile or more by Tony’s judgment, until finally there came a slight break in the trees and the silhouette of a modest hunting lodge peeked into view.
Kehlsteinhaus - The Eagles Nest. Commissioned in 1937, and gifted to Hitler for his 50
Anamarie's eyes lit up and her mouth curled in a jubilant smile. And even though Péter lost that battle with his traitorous cheeks he still felt taller than he'd ever felt before.
There was another crackle of static before the radio quieted once more.
"What's this?" He questioned arching a brow.
Tony’s heart cracked in his chest as Stefen grabbed the trembling boy by the shoulders, forcing Ian still even as Ian continued stammering something unintelligible, eyes wide and pleading. With an eerie calmness Stefan took hold of his face, hands gentle but firm as they held him.
“Major I don’t think I need to remind you of the importance of this package. I’m hesitant to trust it into the hands of an untrained operative as it is. I’m afraid I must know what his stakes are in all of this.”
He should have known it would be a losing battle doing things the captain’s way. Tony was no good at following orders and now look how turned around they all were. Better always, to do things his own way and ask forgiveness later.
“There’s that wit. Well you’ve always been clever Tony, that’s for sure.” the older man drawled reaching inside his jacket for one of his trademark cigars and all Tony could hear was his Nona, crying into the phone about how that wicked man had threatened them and refused to let them burry their daughter. Stanislov hadn’t even let her throw flowers on his mother’s grave.
Stefen pressed his lips to Tony’s once more in a hard kiss that felt one shade claim and the other plea, before he pulled away to look down at him. His fingers threaded through the hair curling at Tony’s nape, and Tony leaned into him.
Péter gingerly took the journal from Tony’s hands, his eyes widening as they slowly took in the sketches, the equations and schematics, his slender hands turning the pages with delicacy. It was impossible, but it did seem as if Péter understood their importance.
“Just him?” Tony prodded gently. He could make a fair enough guess, but that sigh told him that there were burdens on Stefen’s chest that he needed to relieve, and he hoped with a little prodding he’d give into it. Stefen’s tired smile told him that he knew what Tony was up to, but he gave in anyway.
"He was as skinny as a pole, nothing like now. He had this terrible accent. We all called him our Goulash Rat."
“Latcho drom,”he muttered, just under the fading echo, slowly lowering the barrel of the gun, satisfied with the stillness inside the car. It held for a second more before it was disrupted by a distressed cry from inside the car and then the car began to rock and tilt on its uneven tires as Stark moved inside. Bucky watched as he scrambled out from under the body in the backseat. Stark fumbled for the door with bloodied hands and fought to get it open, spilling out onto the road in a heap when he’d managed it.
“Very good.” Tony called back to Artur, who was grinning happily at his find. “Our snares aren’t strong enough for wild goats. If you see one leave it alone. They’re stronger than you’d think.”
“Clothes, papers, tickets. Dad took your Captain and the children to Šijana this morning. They’re in the group the Rabbi is sending. No problems that we’ve heard yet.”
Tony smiled thinly.
Ian gulped, doing his best to hide the violent shiver that went down his spine.
It was alright if he killed Stevie, his best friend, his prala, because they should have died a long time ago. There was nothing beyond that thought in Bucky’s head. Nothing at all.
Steve chanced a glance in the rearview mirror and saw that Tony, although he was sandwiched between the children with Sara asleep in his lap and Artur using his shoulder as a pillow, was listening. His gaze met Steve’s in the mirror and though he didn’t say a word, Steve got the feeling that he knew exactly what Steve had been thinking about.
That issue handled for the time being, Steve turned to his head house maid.
"How's that going?" Bucky asked, a sardonic twist to his smile and Tony grimaced.
Stefen took a deep breath and released it slowly, letting the tension drain from his body – blinking rapidly to dispel the betraying prick of moisture in his eyes and refocused on the faces of his children staring back at him without much hope.
“Let them go with friends their own age, Stefen,” she said softly. It was meant to sound cajoling, teasing her overprotective fiancé but it fell flat. The smile didn’t reach her eyes but she continued, to his horror, addressing the other children.
“Artur what the hell is the matter with you!”
Tony would call himself a practical man. One with his priorities in good order. Sometimes. Not now. Definitely not now.
"That's Yonas, the priest from Lenze. " Bruce muttered, completely abandoning all thoughts of escape as he rushed toward the man, only pausing long enough to carefully shift Lucas' weight onto Leshnerr. Richter started when the other doctor jabbed him rudely with his elbow, prompting him to lend a shoulder to help carry the big man.
“Are you quite sure?” Tony asked quietly. “Last year there was a world of difference and for almost one hundred and fifty years before that. But our beloved Führer put an end to all of the ways in which, for a century or more, a group of people who built their own society before his very existence were learning incorrectly. This one man. He must have keen passion for education.”
"He's going to pull through." Tony declared, tone allowing room for no arguments. And of course, nobody gave him any except for the man's supposed best friend. Who you'd think would be more supportive, considering.
“Maria! Maria, come back to the music room.” Baroness Shrader called from the bottom of the stairs. Even from far away, Dvorak could hear the exhaustion in the woman’s voice.  “You’re not supposed to be near your father.”
“I am curious, how a man like
Mindful of the little time they had, Tony laid a hand on her thin shoulder and pressed the other to her cheek, leaning close as he quietly implored, “It’s the right thing. You know it is.”
She’d relented in the end when the little girls had begged her not to stay behind, but she was refusing to so much as look at him now. Tony could admit he was just fine with that. He’d take James pestering his brother mercilessly over Natcaha’s indignant fury any day. He watched as James, tempted by Ian's focus on Tony, shoved an elbow into his brother’s side just for the sake of it.
"Yes Captain?" Pepper stepped forward at Stefen’s call, as straight backed as a soldier.
Tony tried to surreptitiously reach for the pistol tucked against his chest without drawing anyone's notice. He knew Clint would be doing the same.
When they finally reached the hilltop the children barely waited long enough for Tony to unpack their lunch bags and spread the blanket out before collapsing onto the grass. Not minding Artur’s sprawled form Tony placed their basket of food next to him and promptly flopped on to the ground in a similar fashion, exhausted.
He desperately moved his legs while trying to maintain his hold on James, struggling to push them closer toward the bank and get his feet under him. James didn’t make it easy in his panic but Tony managed it, relief washing through him when the water became shallow enough for him to stand on his own two feet again.
"Gadje, that means not Rom, not Gypsy. Doesn’t it?"
“I made a mistake sending you to be a teacher.” The monk said with a dark kind of glower, but he reached inside his dark cloak and pulled out a small lumpy envelop. Péter could just make out a single word scrawled on the front starting with a loopy T, before Nik had smacked the envelope against Tony’s chest.
Buried in the heap of sad memories that constituted Tony’s boyhood there were happier memories of his mother. Her whispered stories and endless lists of songs and proverbs, honeyed apples to welcome in a new year ahead of the flock (a new year all their own), matzo cooked by loving hands and shared like a secret within his mother’s garden, putting him to bed with the story of Ruth because
Building bridges over land and sea
"He wouldn't do that. He's one of us. Aren't you Spider?" Péter fought the urge to blush as he nodded and answered.
“I don’t think that’s true.” Tony began carefully. “It’s just that, when you love someone a lot and then you lose them, it can be hard to talk about them.”
“Who cares? We aren’t having brunch with him.” James, who was hugging a stripped vest to his chest, responded with a shrug. “Can we have brunch with Baroness Schrader on a boat?”
Bucky lunged and Steve didn’t even flinch. He’d long since stopped fighting back. He just lay there, ready to let Bucky bury him and that was worse than anything else he might have said or done.
Even in sleep her father’s shoulders were bowed inward, like they were weighted by something heavy sitting on his chest. When Maria was born, he used to lay her on his chest, and it had looked as if the baby weighed nothing at all. She didn’t remember if he used to fall asleep with her like that, but she thought he must have. Where else would she have gotten the silly idea that is chest never caved, his back never bent, and that his shoulders would always bear just a little bit more. Maybe every little girl thought her father was untouchable. It was a lie though. He wasn’t unbreakable. She knew that. She wasn’t a little girl anymore, and yet…
Tony made up reasons to pass Stefen’s study in order to get a good look at the lock, and once to hold a torch close and peer inside the cylinder at the inner workings. From there it was a matter of doing the measurements by recall, and drafting a sketch of the appropriate shape needed to throw the levers inside. Once he had that, the rest was easy sailing, thanks to the fresh sheets of steel and the steel cutter Stefen had purchased for him in Berlin.  Cutting the key and filing it down until it was smooth and rounded took the better part of an afternoon and left his arms aching (he was going soft) but the work was satisfying in a way that sat deep in his gut, heavy and warm like one of Willamina’s hearty soups.
And yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was coming. It was like a breath on his neck. A silent warning of an approaching threat that he couldn't see, but he could feel with every raised hair on his body.
The afternoon that Rogers had joined them in their boat making had been promising. It had certainly come as a surprise to the children (as well as Tony) and it was painful to watch them get their hopes up for more of his attention only to have those hopes crushed when he retreated back into his solitude the very next day.
“I’m an ass?!” Stefen barked, but mercifully Tony could hear a telltale warble in his voice, and as if in confirmation his eyes had softened, taken on a wounded roundness that hurt to see but was nevertheless necessary to get through to him. “That’s rich coming from you. You barge in here throwing around insults.”
With a start James realized that he no longer knew what day it was. He had stopped counting when he got sick, and when he started to get better, he hadn’t remembered to start up again. Tony had suggested building the sled when he was well enough, and James had been so excited to get out of bed again he hadn’t thought about it.
“That so?” Bucky laughed swinging at Steve’s weaker side. He countered the blow, grappling for Bucky’s shoulder in order to pull him in close and bring his knee up.
She handed them over without a word, her eyes falling on James who was curled up in her arms, and silently stroking his back.
The riots had happened weeks ago, and they were all here at the villa safely healing he reminded himself, sliding his shaking hands down into his lap and out of view. Steve blinked hard to clear away the vision but it stuck. As his heart began to pound he reminded himself again that just because he saw it didn’t mean it was real and resolved himself to ignore it. He’d get through the meal, for the children, and then he’d ask Tony to help him to bed. He’d feel better when he could touch Tony and hold him, feel for himself what was real and what wasn’t.
"It was supposed to be the two of us, and three others." Stefen admitted, perplexed.
He knocked Switzerland down the list. No big gloomy houses and stiff faced adults demanding children that were seen and never heard. No child deserved that. Adapt. He thought of Pola, the only place from his childhood where he could remember consistent happiness. Sun and pebbly shores. His mother singing. Ana,Jarvis, and Rhodey teasing him, watching over him. His uncle Isiah and aunt Antonia. Nono and Nona teaching him to speak Hebrew and sneaking him sweets.
Yes he’d be just fine with that: regulated to the kitchens with the cook Willamina and the other night staff. It was better there anyway, to be in the kitchens with the room to move about freely without the social constructions of a formal dinner weighing on your shoulders. He’d always hated formal dinners.
He jumped, flinching away at the hand Tony had tentatively rested on his shoulder. Tony pulled back, giving him space as if Ian were a spooked animal and swallowed the scream for them all to go away that was building behind his teeth. Darting forward he swept up the pieces of his book and its crumpled pages into his arms. Shoving James out of his way Ian ran out of the room, ignoring Tony's shout after him.
“Are you done swimming?”
Finally, it was done.
Cameron nodded weakly, wet eyes latching on the captain though he refused to let go of his brother. "What about mama and papa? What’s going to happen to them?"
“I’ll have the lawyer put it in the details of the children’s trust.”
“I’ll love it either way, but I do hope it’s something scandalous. I’ve always wanted a string of pearls. They look marvelous with my coloring,” Tony teased, delighted when Stefen’s eyes widened with a fever brightness.
“She’s not going to listen next time, if she sees you don’t eat your food either” Ian pointed out.
"It looks as if our monk is in trouble again," Steve met the anxious eyes of the children and was gratified when their anxiousness gave way to mirth and curiosity as the commotion outside the doors got closer.
“Speaking plainly gentlemen,” Holmes’ voice cut through the fog of panic swirling in his head and Tony struggled to breathe past the knot in his chest, “There is a future where Steven Grant is allowed to walk away from this. Where he disappears, only remembered in classified records.”
“You’re green. Are you about to be sick?” James exclaimed loudly, leaning right into Bucky's face. “If you are, do it on Ian, I don’t want -” Bucky cut him off, shoving him away and James sat back in his seat with a plop and stuck his lip out in a pout.
He startled at a crack of thunder. In the room the children’s voices rose even louder as if they were trying to drown out the storm. And suddenly anger welled up within him, swift and forceful.
“Antony Stark” Obadiah breathed his name with wonder, as if Tony’s appearance there was somehow miraculous, the tall man rising from his chair in one slow graceful movement despite the slender walking stick Tony spotted resting against his chair. Shock held Tony in place as Stanislov’s mouth split into a wide happy grin and his godfather extended one broad palm to shake. Tony’s brain was struggling under the weight of shock and when it did kick start enough for him to numbly reach for Obi’s hand his thoughts only got muddier under a storm of impulses as the man gripped it firmly and pulled him in for a full-bodied hug.
He’d been gone just over a month by Tony’s count before Bruce deemed it safe enough to set out. It had been nearly a week and a half since anyone had come to the abbey to question the brothers, and to the best of their knowledge the police had stopped patrolling the nearby roads.
"So you’re a doctor now?" Bucky growled and Tony snapped quickly in reply.
“Because I designed the armor and the weapon.” Tony confessed. He’d told Stefen of course, how he’d signed away Stark Industries, but he hadn’t gone into detail for exactly this reason. “The metal I developed to fortify my workshop and the formula for the high-powered explosive I made when we liberated Bruce and the others from Dachau, I sold them to my godfather to buy our escape.”
“Here I am, Captain.” Tony said with a small smile, drinking in the way Stefen’s eyes roved over his face, as if looking to memorize it. Tony’s voice was far steadier than he felt and he wondered that Stefen could stay so unaffected when he felt that at any moment he might humiliate himself and start begging for the man to touch him.

“Get down, they’re coming.” Bucky waved franticly at Scott and Jons who quickly ducked down inside the bed of the truck. Bucky kicked Harrison’s feet where they stuck out beneath the truck. “And you, numskull, it’s a fucking act. Don’t break our getaway vehicle!”
“Has he really gone to teach somewhere else?” James asked suddenly, the beginnings of a distressed whine in his voice that given his infamously prickly attitude on the train, too Charlotte somewhat aback as he wailed, “I don’t want him to!”
Globocnik, true to form, had launched into a passionate tirade against political Catholicism and a plea for the necessary subjugation of the church.
“I’ll shoot you Stefen if you force me to put that child on a boat without you.” Tony responded without a hint of humor, stepping in closer to Steve like he might not wait for Steve to do the claiming. “And that would be a terrible waste, when there are so many other things I’d rather do.”
The food was tasteless in his mouth and under so many watchful eyes it felt like lumps of wet clay landing in his belly, an unpleasant sensation that he was fearful would result in a desperate need to be ill if he continued.
Had he ever felt something so warm before? He thought not and recognized on some level that it was a sad thing not to remember. But he was just glad to lay at night listening to the stuttering snores and steady heartbeat of another being besides himself. He would burrow down with one hand on the goat, always, always, touching him in some way, and Patroche would let him. Gentle after all. A good boy.
“Tony made a glue.” Peter explained as if he’d read his mind. “It smells rotten but I don’t think you’ll care if it works.”
“It is.” Stefan agreed, taking the pistol from Tony and reloading it. “But ya gotta hit them first.”
"I can’t be in two places at once." Stefen replied, voice low and ragged with frustration. "And we won’t have the others to help either. They’ll never be able to mobilize in time, not now that they’ve been sent to the polish border."
They'd gone outside Tony recounted to himself and froze.
“He’s actually not wrong,” Stark announced unexpectedly and Bucky stared at him. Stark went on with a wave of his hand. “About the Divas and their
“I knew your father.” The older man stated with an air of sobriety. “His loss was a terrible blow for us all.”
"I do." Steve said tightly, looking up with a hard jerk of his head, resettling back into the man the world knew as Captain Rogers. He pinned Bucky with one last look, murmuring, "And you’d do well to remember that" before he turned and walked back into the street.
"No, I won't!" Artur pouted with a dark scowl. "Tell him to come back!"
He felt eyes on him and looked up, expecting to find Bucky or one of the children trying to catch his attention, but when he looked around everyone was busy, chatting away as they concentrated on their projects.
"He's right. I'm sorry," Péter apologized, feeling chastised, but Natacha didn't meet his eyes as she nodded.
Least of all where his children were concerned.
Charlotte trailed off, because she was watching same as Tony was, so she didn’t miss the moment when Stefen finally noticed the décor of the hall, his eyes locking on the giant red banner hanging in front of the ballroom doors.
Stefen’s breath tickled over Tony’s skin, his voice little louder than a murmur. Tony cracked open one eye, to find soft blue ones staring steadily down at him.
When she looked back up at Steve there was new trepidation in her eyes.
“You’re not finished with me?” Tony asked, the cheeky bastard but Steve loved that about him. God help him. Tony's breath caught in the back of his throat and his eyes almost fluttered shut as Steve raked his fingers up the column of his throat and into the soft hair at the nape of his neck murmuring, “not nearly.”
somewhat Jewish. Not when they would do it again (again and again and again) until his brains were smeared across the pavement and there was nothing left of him.
This was, surprisingly, directed at the children.
“We’ve been in contact with foreign governments through the help of the church and other operatives.” Coulson explained. “The rest of the world is not interested in a costly war and many leaders within the German Army find themselves wary of a war they fear Germany can’t win.”
“Fraulein Rogers! Wait up.”
"… give it here, James. I was using it first!" What sounded like Artur's shrieking was followed by an alarming crash and ominous silence.
There was a massive effort underway to expand the railway before war broke out, and the führer wasn't going to be stopped by the weather. Which meant that there were a great number of men set to work laying track headed south, and therefore a great number of Gestapo in place to watch them. The upside, and the hinge of their entire plan, was that there were also a lot of trucks ambling back and forth with supplies.
The night his parents had been killed had started like any other. He’d gone with his parents to the shipyard where Hughard was to give a special presentation to a bunch of high ranking military officials. Stark ships were the best ships in the world and Hughard had wanted to assure the Austrians and the Germans that their navies would be the best outfitted and best gunned in the world. It was an unpopular move with the workers. Italy had sided with the allies and too many of the men and women who called Pola home remembered the days when Pola had been part of it and did not think themselves Austrian.
Lying through his teeth.
Rogers, who was being held up on either side by two men, struggled to lift his head. Managing it just barely long enough to meet Schmidt’s eye as the general finished his speech. His eyes looked glazed with pain, but there was a fire in them, a violence bordering on the rabid.
“I believe we’re finished here, doctor?” he asked, and Fischer nodded shortly, already moving to join him as Dvorak all but fled from the room.
Steve pulled on the coat while Magda watched impatiently, bewildered and anxious over his slow lethargic movements. He had to lean on her to stand, but once he had his legs under him, he stayed upright. Teeth clenched, he put one foot down in front of the other until they reached Magda had pulled one of the big doors open and they’d exited the barn.
“That’s a fine thing. A very fine thing.” Slowly a smile returned to Joshua’s face. He nodded, as if turning it over in his mind and when his eyes met Tony’s he could see in them that he was just as eager as Tony was to see a party come back to the Roger’s villa.
The side door for staff was the most vulnerable entry point. He cased the entire building until he figured out which room was Dvorak’s, lucky enough to spot the man through a window as he entered the room. The inn kept a pen full of goats, and they had a girl looking after them. It was easy to stop her for directions and chat her up, like any fellow would when they came across a pretty woman who gave them the time. While she was distracted by his flattery, he slipped the latch on the gate and it wasn’t long after he’d pretended to leave on his way before the curious goats discovered the gate ajar and made their escape. It was almost funny watching the poor girl running after them. A soldier jumped in to help her try and recapture the willy creatures and they made quite the spectacle.
"He was sick all over the washroom." Harold grunted as they dropped Steve's heavy weight into the space where Virginia had pulled back the covers, and the woman was smart to immediately rest both palms against Steve's shoulders and push him downwards, as he immediately tried to raise himself back up again.
She thought about her father; saw him holding Ian afloat in the water, lifting Artur up onto his shoulders. Saw him walking in the garden with Herr Stark.
"But so you know, I have nothing at all against getting married when I am finished with my schooling. And if it is my womanly duty to find only the best, well then I am determined to do exactly that."
are we here?” There was enough moonlight to see Tony’s face just barely in the dark, but no one would be able to see much of them, should they look this way.
She slammed into him with the side of her hip, catching him by surprise. She grabbed at the gun as he stumbled, grunting as he found his balance and began to wrestle her for it. Steve had just reached them when she kicked the man violently in the shins and wrenched the gun away from his hands. There was a loud bang as the gun went off and Steve hit the ground hard, covering his head and rolling away from the shots with a terrified shout. He was still hearing gunshots in his ears, the repeated crack crack crack of bursting shells, so it was too long before he realized that it was only his mind and that he wasn’t being shot at. He lifted his head, shaking, risking a glance above him where the man and Magda faced off, their chests heaving.
God help them all, Steve thought desperately.
“I... I ought to apologize.”
Stefen’s eyes glittered with amusement, mouth turning toward a smirk but he must have seen that Tony was determined because when he did finally speak, it was at least somewhere in the general vein of what they needed to discuss.
“All I’m saying is he was watching your door like a hawk and – come on you can push harder than that.”
Péter wondered if that were true. Natacha could do it, probably better than any of them. The little ones were young enough that their memories would dull with time, and they'd parrot the things they were taught. But Péter would never forget. He’d seen what they did to people and he could
James looked to Stark with a flicker of uncertainty as if he’d just realized that the vein throbbing at his Father’s temple did not bode well and Stark nodded with a small smile, ignoring Stefen’s glower (like he always did).
Wouldn't it just be the love story for the ages? Hortense the wallflower and Herr Stark, the monk who drank like a fish and slept with the father of his charges because he was a god damned fool.
“Yes Stark as their tutor – ”
Bucky knew that expression. It was the same expression he’d worn before he'd approached Peggy the first time, the same one he’d worn as he’d stepped into the recruiting line.
"How many were you expecting?" Bucky just heaved an aggravated breath and Tony shot him a look he hoped begged for the other man to just work with him on this, because Stefen was wound tightly and not in any place to think clearly. Stefen wanted to beat himself up, not Bucky, Tony knew that, but those two had the strangest sort of pact that they were free to knock each other over the head in substitute of punching bags; and there was no time for it now. Fighting over what they couldn't change wasn't going to help a damn thing.
Music floated to them on the wind and Steve pushed back the wave of despondent anger threatening to overwhelm him. They were passing through the square now.  But instead of the usual sight of families of refugees camped together in misery, a crowd had gathered around the fountain. It was their voices raised in song. Their hands playing music and their bodies dancing despite the cold. Many were holding candles, Steve realized watching a woman with a basket of thin little candles passing them around to those without. They weren’t alone either. There were lights dancing in many of the windows of the surrounding houses and apartments, the dark pushed away by candles burning brightly from candelabras. Gone was the scent of death that always plagued his nose here, replaced by the fresh scent of snow and sweet notes of sugar and cinnamon.
Tony didn’t need to look at Natacha to feel her disapproval. He could see it reflected in the widening brown pools of Péter’s eyes. It was treason to speak against their fearless new leader and his regime. He couldn’t help a smirk of satisfaction, but it was ruined by the fact that a second later he had to dodge one of Sara’s swinging arms, the child still attempting to find her way back to the ground.
“When you’re stuck in uniform every day you take advantage of leave when you have it,” Stefen replied evenly, stepping toward Tony and reaching for the bag at his side without taking his eyes from him. When he was unbearably close Stefen lowered them slowly to take him in fully and when they raised again to meet Tony’s, there was an unbanked hunger in his eyes that sent arousal twisting deep within Tony’s gut.
And why not? Tony was everywhere in his head. He didn’t have to close his eyes to see his long shapely fingers, or remember they way they had climbed over his arms, scrapping his nerves into a raw fire.
"Don’t call me that!" Péter snapped immediately in reply, horror warring within him with shame and fury for supremacy. Fury came out on top. He wanted to hit something so badly. Pietro was bigger but Péter wasn't going to back down. Not this time and not ever. And he could see it in Pietro’s eyes, how he wanted to hit Péter too.
It would be easy.
Could he really say goodbye to two of his oldest friends, knowing he was leaving them to face whatever was ahead alone? Bobby and Johann were going to the officer school. Harry’s mother was still refusing to allow him to go but who knew how long she’d hold out to the pressure from Harry and the rest?
“Someone has emptied the alms box-”
The man blinked slowly at Tony and said nothing, so Tony shook off the unease his stare had caused and whispered as not to wake Natacha, “I might need you to hold him down. The injection will be painful.”
“Jobs have opened up, money is more lucrative now, the streets are cleaner than I’ve ever seen them, and citizen are not being taken advantage of.” Zimmerman replied with a snort, his voice losing some of the confidence it had adopted. “As long as we don’t get cock deep in a war, Germany can rebuild itself.”
“They won’t reach town for a few hours yet. Countess Schrader is loath to travel at night. They’ll be here in the morning when you wake.” Not that Tony expected him to sleep. They both knew he was in for another night of restlessness, only made more impossible by waiting on a razors edge for the children to return. Tony crossed the room to the bed and spread the blanket out over Stefen’s lap and slid back in behind him. He made sure his legs were still halfway off the bed to avoid suspicion if they received a surprise interruption.
“Rachol’s dead.” He allowed himself to say out loud for the first time, all of the fight draining out of him like water through bullet holes in a barrel. He felt the words settling down in his gut like boulders. He let himself finally hold them up in the light of day and look squarely at them without flinching back into the safety of empty hope.
“Very much.” Tony answered with a short laugh and Stefen chuckled warmly in his ear.
Fighting for calm, Steve turned his head back to meet Artur’s pleading eyes.
!” Tony implored, his voice drowned out by their excited exclamations.
Maria looked at the baroness and then back at him. Squaring her little shoulders as she commanded, “Get Dr. Erskine. He always makes us feel better.”
The lodge was bigger than the one Ian and his family were staying in. It looked out over the valley, and there was an old fence running around it to keep the goats in the yard. There were lights burning inside and the yard looked well-tended, in a way that made Ian think whoever lived there lived there year-round. There were clear pathways between the shed, the trough and the latrine; and the snow had been shoveled around the base of the home and packed down by consistent trod back and forth.
When Steve failed to muster up some sort of reply to whatever it was he was nattering on about Artur clutched his leg with even more force and turned large pleading eyes on him.
Ian rushed past Tony like a bullet to get to his sister, Péter not far behind, both boys kneeling down and brushing off her the smear of mud running up her pinafore. Artur watched fearfully from where he sat behind James, his fingers crammed in his mouth.
Stefen Rogers, the boy from nowhere, crouched in the corner with his pencil and the bits of paper he liked to sketch on in the quieter moments of officer training.
Was it over?
[Droll] I always loved that the last shot was us walking through the hills with no food or supplies.
And that was the very realization that made her grip finally go slack, the knife clattering to the garage floor.
Inexplicably, when Steve squared his shoulders and thrust his hand toward Bahkizen, the man took it, pulling Steve marginally closer to himself as the captain leaned down to whisper something solely for his ears. Bucky nodded firmly just the once and stepped away. And that was it.
“Tony?”
The captain nodded and took the plate from him. And because Tony wasn’t a fool he kept watching him expectantly, bright smile in place, until good manners demanded Stefen actually begin consuming the sentimental little gift. Tony was even happier to see that he didn’t just stop at the one, that apparently his mother’s favorite afternoon treat had found favor with Rogers.
Steve tore his mouth away, panting for breath and Tony shuddered, swaying as if he might fall. Steve pulled him back in until their foreheads pressed together. His heart beating wildly against his ribs in tandem with Tony’s.
Tony wished they could have risked saying yes. It was miles uphill to get back to the cabin and a very winding path to get there. But at least now they had more blankets, and hot soup to warm them. He and Ian didn’t talk much during the first leg of the journey. As soon as the lodge had disappeared on the trail behind them Ian had told Tony of the couple’s suspicions. They’d thought he looked familiar and might be a runaway Jew. Tony didn’t trust them not to dwell on those suspicions or get it into their heads to try and look into them.
Tony swallowed thickly but couldn’t immediately answer. He had wondered - especially after Yinsen - it was just that, he’d always assumed being sent away to a monastery was his father’s way of punishing him. For not being the kind of man at seventeen that Hughard had always thought he should be. For not being ready or willing to see Stark Industries through war time; but mostly as punishment for feeling more Italian than German and rejecting good German blood (for rejecting Hughard). Like many of the German people who had settled in Pola, Hughard had thought himself superior to everyone else. Tony’s father used to say the only thing worse than a lazy Croat was a lazy
There would be no need to dress the sketch up for his daughter’s active imagination. His royal highness and his wife the duchess were already something out of a picture book as it was.
When he had enough air and presence of mind for it he stumbled into the washroom to splash water on his face. He stood over the sink, staring into his reflection as the vestiges of the dream faded.
“Then you aren’t thinking. It’s easy. A child could do it and you’re children so come along.” Tony motioned impatiently with his hand and in his chair Péter sat up straighter, anxiousness stiffening his shoulders as he thought through the math.
“The finest. And it will be the finest of parties. Fine china, wine so expensive it will make you sick, opera singers…”
Artur blinked up at him, cheeks still flushed with anger but his brow had wrinkled in confusion and he wasn’t attempting to run anywhere (or at anyone) so that was good.
“Now hold on a minute, I didn’t mean – ”
It sounded rehearsed even to Tony but that didn’t matter. They just had to keep saying it over and over until the Germans believed.
It carried him back to strong hands pushing back his fringe. Frigid water being poured on his face - the whole time his mother clinking as she worked to briskly scrub him. His aunt, shot gun in hand, laughing with another auntie, their skirts wrapped up around their waists revealing the dumpy trousers and men’s work boots the wore as they dragged him and Stevie through the woods on little wooden sleds.
Following the rescue mission at Dachau Tony is stuck at Engelzell Abbey while the SS comb the countryside looking for him. Meanwhile Steve and the children make a trip to the Berghof for a weekend with the Fuhrer that could have dangerous consequences for them all.
“Thought I told you to come alone?” he countered, blowing smoke out the side of his mouth.
“Naturally if they cross our borders to kill good Germans we will do what is necessary to protect our people.” Striker continued, relaxing back into his seat. “Just as we must do with the growing threat from these Czech roaches.”
Yes well, if you don’t come back what good does that do?
“Vati!” Artur squealed, so excited to see that father had returned that he dropped the jar. Ian made a lung for it but couldn’t catch it in time, but thankfully it landed with a soft thump in the grass none the the worse for wear. Artur plowed ahead and threw himself at father, James scuttling not far behind. Ian followed much slower, his stomach doing funny flips unable to shake the feeling of dread he had.
He wondered if it was the same for Bucky. Did he feel it too or was he just putting up with their strange new addition for Steve's sake?
"Daniel!" Cameron came suddenly alive, shooting up from the couch and rushing towards his brother. Daniel met him half way, the older boy's shoulders shaking as he choked down a sob and buried his face against Cameron's shirt.
He really was no good at spy work he thought irritable, and not very good at tutoring either it seemed.
It was a moment or two before Tony could trust the stillness ringing in his ears enough to pry his eyes open.  The two monks from Engelszell lay close together, one passed out and the other muttering prayers and crossing himself as he clutched his comrade tightly to him. Bruce was uncurling from where he'd thrown himself on top of Clint, blinking rapidly and peering around them cautiously.  Lucas and Richter had been thrown up against the side of the truck, and Leshnerr was sitting up nearby, blinking through the trickle of blood oozing from a red gash on his forehead.
"But we're good aren't we?" James pouted.
Stefen stared back at him for a moment, fondness creeping into his tone as he murmured that he’d never doubted it for a second; but it couldn’t completely smooth away the worry in his eyes. Best to assist him with that, Tony decided. He’d read often that good deeds must be rewarded, and the Captain had been nothing if not good to him these last few days.
Truth was it didn’t make much sense and he knew that. He just didn’t know what it meant that he was alright with Tony doing what he himself found unfathomable.
Stefen’s hands came up to frame his face. Tony looked up into his eyes and ached at the tears he saw there. He knew Stefen wouldn’t allow them to fall even as the gruff edge in his voice betrayed the heart Tony knew was crumbling within his chest.
“I’m sure.”
“Harold! It’s good to see you,” Bucky exclaimed hopping from the car to envelop Hogan into an enthusiastic embrace, a shark toothed grin splitting his face wide at the driver’s startled expression. Bucky never had held with propriety. Steve watched them with an exasperated smile.
