"She keeps saying that!" Charlie complained. "'This is something I need to do alone! 'Alone and
"Ok, well, it sounds like you guys are ready for a buddy-cop show. An angel and a demon. Together you solve crimes!"
Billie shook her head and her lip twisted in a smirk. "Winchesters. You all drive me out of my mind. If I find you brought one more of you back into this world, I swear, I will give up my rules and reap every last one of you and dump you in the empty." She pointed at Mary. "If you change your mind, I'm still willing to take you and only you to heaven. You know my name." She waved at Dean and Sam, "You two monsters are still on my shit list." Then she turned to Charlie. "And I will figure out who changed your fate, little red."
Surprisingly, Missouri decided she was going to come along on this outing. She told Charlie to stay with Magda and Elijah, but the redhead refused and got into the car anyway. Missouri shrugged and murmured, "Your own fault, girl."
"Yes, please," said Dean sullenly, and Cas pulled a second bottle from his trench coat. Apparently, even this lesser trench coat had deep pockets. He continued with more grace. "Goodnight, Cas. Thanks for, y'know. Being here."
Dean trudged into the bunker. He called a general hello and there were loud echoes of movement through the halls. Magda came around the corner from the study room first, then Elijah tumbled in from the stairs to the garage. Cas came in from the hallway towards the archives with more dignity.
"I mean... Sam was in hell for like a hundred and fifty years!" He tried to divert her attention.
Mary and Magda had a similar quietness about them and seemed drawn to each other. They would sit in silence for ages, just putting their faces up to the light and sharing the peace. Elijah liked how Mary could throw a football as far as he could, and he happily submitted to her hair-tussling.
Soon Abraham and Gail Peterson were tied to two of the dining chairs, and Cas sat in another next to them. Elijah and Dean headed down to the cellar to get Magda and Sam.
"Oh," she said breathlessly. "Oh, Castiel, you were wrong. This is not an abomination but the seed of a
"Maybe," Sam said." Kid delivered groceries all over town, so I checked his route against Olivia's case files."
But when there were cars around, or he had to make turns, Cas was a model driver and took things very slow. He always seemed aware that there were rather breakable humans riding in the car with him.
!'" she quoted dramatically, and Dean snorted and glared. She had sullied his brain with her stupid cult tv shows. "Look, we've been taking it slow. She doesn't seem to notice I'm here half the time. I just stay with her, put food in front of her, and credit cards and good ID in her wallet. It's going okay, but I don't know what's going on in her head."
They had the Petersons restrained with more professional looking zip-ties when the ambulance and police arrived. It was a bit of a mess. Crime scene techs and uniformed cops were all over the farmyard. It felt like a scene Dean should be escaping, not staying in.
He hadn't heard anything from Charlie or Mary this morning, and he was getting worried. Maybe he should text them?
Billie shrugged. "Alright. I've got another soul in there to reap anyway." She disappeared.
Cas and Mary appeared from the trees near them and tugged the bunch into a tangled hug. Dean could feel Sam shaking badly.
Dean closed his eyes. "Well, without Rowena, we're outgunned."
"Yes," Cas answered calmly. "He's recently... been released from the cage." Dean met Cas's eyes in the rearview, having noticed his voice tighten at the end. He gave the angel an encouraging nod. Cas breathed and continued, "Anyway, he's been jumping from vessel to vessel as they are too weak to hold him for long. We followed him to Wallace Parker, and from there to the Archbishop. That's why we came tonight. We are hoping to confront him and do... something, I guess."
Sam said, "Hey, maybe uh, you should stay here?"
"Rainbow wig? What?" Sam huffed. "You know what? I'm done apologizing. Lucifer possessed Vince Vincente. This is Vince Vincente's music, so listening to it is research."
"You're the one who was hunting Magda in that hospital," Dean accused. The tension shifted around him. Cas started pushing Magda into his car. Sam seemed to grow as he moved into protect mode, and Dean was about one slimy word from pulling the trigger.
Looking around in confusion as everyone cheered and drank, Dean asked, "'Wendigo,' is that, uh..."
"What are you doing here?" Charlie asked.
"Because I'm awesome. Anyway, I need you to sort of make Cas a legal foster parent."
Dean understood suddenly what Cas had meant the night before. These social workers really were like hunters. That was the voice he used about someone he hadn't been able to save and couldn't forgive himself for.
He trailed off as he twisted around, spotting Missouri standing calmly behind him. "Oh, hullo," Ketch said, "I don't think we've been introduced."
Clotho, the spinner, reached down into the already woven cloth and pulled on a tied-off string. She pulled off a tiny bit of shining wool from the edge and freed it. Lachesis, the apportioner, took her measuring string and measured the tiny piece of fluff. She tutted and shook her head.
"She hates the way we were raised. She hates the fact that we're hunters. Maybe she starts walking, and she doesn't stop." He laughed humorlessly. "You know, she obviously has zero interest in keeping this family together."
Sam was working on his laptop, too. "Yeah, right now, it looks like his whole party—aides, Secret Service, the whole circus—is staying at an estate owned by Ron Forester, the, uh, hedge fund zillionaire. It's right outside Indianapolis. But it is completely surrounded by walls, security, Secret Service, military." He shrugged. "Plan B?"
Perhaps the drama was deserved in this case.
"What is that?" Sam asked.
" Sam's voice again. Dean was almost crushing his phone in his grip. He left the phone on the step and went to tug uselessly at the door handle.
"Ok, so Charlie hacked into-" Dean saw Jody's mouth and eyes open wide. "-Ok, there may have been a few more things we didn't tell you yet. But, look! We're already here!"
- forgot eggs
Sam stammered. "We gotta go. Get her out of here. Go."
"Come on," Dean said.
Dean turned to Cas, hoping to get some answers, "so what happened here? Where's Sam?  He's not answering his phone, there's blood on the floor. What's going on?
Charlie figured it out one minute after Vincente's bandmate texted Cas the address. She was quite pissed. "I had it! I was going to be the queen here." She muttered.
- Cas clothes
Cas sighed again and leaned back against the stair rail. Dean released him now, satisfied the angel wasn't going to run. "She doesn't seem to feel like she fits here. Like she belongs."
Dean followed closely. He tried the light switch, but nothing happened. Sam and he pulled out their flashlights to light the way. The first room they entered was a familiar scene, the whirlwind evidence of a struggle with detritus on the floor and overturned chairs.
"Welcome to Los Angeles," Crowley said.
"Well, thanks." She chuckled. "It's better than walking around in that nightgown the rest-"
Cas looked up, confused. "I have no idea if she was hot. And I didn't wear a gown. We were on a mission. I wore a sensible walking skirt and tailored overcoat. Hm. It was very much the same color as my trench coat. Anyway, it was not a pleasant mission, and I'd rather not think about it anymore," he finished crossly.
Dean slumped against the wall, tired from his rant. Cas reached over and touched Dean's temple gently. The headache eased, and Dean smiled at the angel gratefully. "Thanks, Cas."
"Ok, let's take this one down to the cellar. He can stay there for now. We'll have to get him tied up."
Sam tugged out his earbuds and tossed them aside. "Dude."
"I feel like James Bond," Dean whispered to Charlie and Magda. Charlie laughed, and Magda smiled.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Uh..." Billie said, trying to take the conversation back, "everyone dies."
Sam sighed, "What?"
"No, actually," Cas said helpfully, "he left."
They were sitting quietly on the edge of the Impala's hood, Dean's arm around Charlie's shoulder as she breathed slowly. Loud heels clipped across the cobbled stone of the drive, and Dean called for the person to leave them alone.
It was a tangle of limbs before Dean managed to extract himself. He took a deep breath and looked up at the ceiling, trying to keep all his emotions in check. These voices and embraces, from people he thought he had lost forever. He wasn't sure he had ever received as many hugs as he had in the past twenty-four hours between the goodbyes the evening before and the hellos today.
As she turned a page, a picture slipped out from between the pages. It was a photo of her and the boys, taken just a few weeks before her death.
They found the priest who had been interviewed for the article in the main sanctuary, speaking to one of the altar boys.
"Go to Hell!" Sam replied.
They pulled up to the Men of Letter's base in good time. The sight of the bunker's ugly wall poking out of the hillside helped ease something in Dean's chest. Just 24 hours ago, he had been ready to die. Again. But suddenly, there seemed like there was some hope. Amara was gone, Chuck was gone. Lucifer was out there, but he was out of Cas. Sam was waiting for him and would be so excited to see Mom.
Sam looked unsure, and Mary hesitant, but she nodded. "Sure."
"I think you would have to decide very specifically what your goal is to save," Cas said softly.
"I promise to explain everything later. Just stay as quiet as you can until we're clear, okay?"
"It's probably nothing," Mary started to backtrack her enthusiasm. "I just thought I might...get out there, stretch my legs."
"Umm..." Dean hung his head and rubbed the back of his neck. "Yeah, but Charlie stopped me. Anyway," he looked up, "everything is fine! We don't owe her anything, Jody is fine, and I'm home, and they'll be home soon!"
Dean sat on the edge of the ancient washing machine in the bunker. It had to be babysat and kicked every once in a while. He really needed to get a full washer-dryer set if there were going to be so many people living here full time.
Cas didn't respond, and Jack looked over to see his father was crying, quiet tears running down his heartbroken face. Jack had all the power in the universe. Surely he could do something to keep his father from crying.
"Does this mean you're coming home?" Sam asked Mary hopefully.
Cas glared at him. "At least I don't look like a lumberjack." Dean met his glare with startled surprise at the comeback. After a moment, the glare softened, and Cas said softly, "I know you are anxious right now, but please stop taking it out on me."
"God help us, she's going to monologue about you," complained Billie. Charlie elbowed the incarnation of death in the side.
Cas was looking at Dean with concern, and Dean tried to brush it off but was caught there. He nodded at Cas gratefully and focused over on Beth as she retrieved the case files. The angel dropped his hand and put it into the pocket of his trench coat.
Cas came out of the bathroom. "I found something," he said, holding it up.
"Oh, yeah." Dean had no idea what Charlie had done with the paperwork, but he played along. "Sorry about the confusion."
Dean gestured helplessly. "It's Jody, man."
"Well, at least he'll be outside of the mansion, then," Cas commented.
"Then what do you want to do next?" Cas asked.
Cas looked at him steadily. "In a locked cabinet in the kitchen. Here's the key." He held out his hand, a small key lying on the palm. Looking back into his eyes, Dean saw only trust. He'd expected Cas to fight with him more about it. They'd had a few arguments about his drinking already.
He started up a news video as Charlie and Magda, and Elijah came in to crowd around the small screen with the rest of them.
Dean gave Cas a grateful look. Magda spoke more quietly. "I mostly read."
"I have to go." Cas blurted out and turned away from the kitchen.
He laughed dryly. "Well, I've done it myself enough times. No big deal."
The sound of his name made Dean's heart sink. If this guy knew their names, Lucifer had probably put them on official watch lists and stuff. They were going to have to go back to Frank Devaroux levels of dark.
"What do you want, Squirrel?" The demon complained.
"So the show is tonight?" Cas asked.
"He could be an agent or something." Sam defended.
"Now you give each other hugs, you fools," Missouri complained from her seat. "And don't forget to hug me, too."
Also, chapter tags: #child abuse, #ptsd, #John Winchester's A+ Parenting. I'll add them to the tags. Dean has a flashback, but Cas breaks him out of it before it gets too bad.
"So, you were a hot, thirty-something brunette with pretty blue eyes in a
- Need 3-4: Cas, Mom, Charlie, and maybe Sam?
Charlie came in to join the group as Ketch started talking. "It's all very simple, really," he said. "Mick Davies asked you to join our effort, which we're taking international. My instructions are to strongly encourage a "yes."
"I knew you were going to fucking say that," Dean groaned.
They all ended up sitting around the Bellaqua Hotel lobby, waiting for Charlie to break through someone's email or other.
"That's all we're asking. Thank you."
" Crowley finished and hung up.
Sam shook his head, "No, I had to call him! It was important."
Dean shrugged, "He adopted the girl. So you need to understand if there's any possibility of us working with you or your friends, she is off-limits. If something bad happens, we'll handle it ourselves. Is that understood?"
It was probably a good story to start with. It was cold and showed John's priorities, but there was no screaming or pain. Dean sighed and put his face in his hands.
Mary pulled him into her arms and held him for a moment before letting him leave. He closed the door quietly, and she sat to look through the pages of  John's journal. She touched the photos quietly and ran her fingers along the familiar handwriting. The pain of losing John was sharp and fresh. He should have been here to see this family.
Sam stepped in, "Claire is my niece, but she's Dean and Cas and Jody's weird daughter somehow."
"Claire makes me playlists that fit her mood," Cas said as if that made sense. It sort of did, though. "Here." Cas attempted to mash the earbuds into Dean's ears until Dean took over and did it himself, and then the choral intro started.
"Who is it? Sam?" It wasn't Sam's voice, but he called out anyway. There was an arch, and a couple of steps separated the map room from the hallway.
Crowley waved them off, still looking confused but also flattered.
"Guess we're walking from here," Dean said. He awkwardly climbed over the gate, feeling all of his thirty-seven years. Sam and Cas just watched him, then walked through the now-obvious gap to the side of the gate. Sam gave him a mocking look, pleased to have one-upped his brother, but Cas just smiled in amusement.
" She paused.
"Yeah, sorry about Elvis," said Flannel guy. "He's uh... Elvis. I'm Bucky Sims." He shook Dean's hand.
"Aw, crap," Dean muttered.
"I have no clue. She said she had a vision and then went to hug Magda, so maybe she's here to help her?" Dean shrugged. "Why does anything happen? Lucifer's back, we have to go to LA, Magda's still struggling with her powers, Mom can't come in the bunker, Sam's strings are still being pulled by something, we don't know who brought Charlie back or what ulterior motives they might have, and now Missouri shows up out of nowhere. I need to go do possession tests and shit on her, and I have such a bad headache."
everything.
of flannel," Cas whispered to Dean.
"One sec." Sam cleared his throat and tapped away at the keyboard for a moment. "No way. So this is from today."
Dean was happy to hand off computer duties, though he felt fairly competent at them now. "Charlie, there's a laptop in the library. Do your thing." She grinned and cracked her knuckles as she rushed up the steps.
"Billie, what are you doing here?" He asked.
"Are you playing games on your phone? So I've been trying to dig up info on the British Men of Letters, keeping an eye out for cases, and you've been goofing off with a game that went out of style five years ago?"
Cas looked pleased with his idea, and honestly, Dean couldn't think of a complaint. So he just grumbled and insisted on putting on a Doors cassette for the rest of the drive. Cas rolled his eyes when Dean met them in the mirror. It was a soft look, though, and Dean had to look away quickly.
"I'm also kind of a mess, Dean," her voice shook as much as her hands. "I'm terrified, like all the time! I have to leave the bathroom door open and take really short showers because I'm so scared of being alone in a motel bathroom. Because I was murdered in one." Her voice choked on the word.
"Mia Farrow," Charlie replied absently.
"And she cut
Charlie followed Dean outside. She stood quietly to the side as he took a drink from his flask and leaned on his beloved car, just watching him. He tried to ignore her.
Sam embraced her and nodded. "I know." He let go, though the tears were rolling down his face, and his body was actually trembling now.
Hugo turned to look at Sam. "I'm a priest," he shrugged. "Plus, I have two PHDs in Hebrew Bible and Classic Religions, so I'm pretty well up on angel and demon differences. Speaking of which," he twisted to look the other way so he could see Cas, "I didn't get your name!"
Dean looked at Sam, not sure how to convince her to let them come. Sam spoke up, "Yeah, no, Jody - we know you'll be fine, but... you know, we never go to Hunter gatherings, outside of bars. Dad always said they were trouble, so..."
Dean swallowed hard. "33 years."
Instead of heading for the bunker, Sam turned into a small apartment complex near the center of town.
Ketch replied, "I don't care about you one way or the other. I'm not an ideologue."
"So, what happens now?" Cas asked.
"Mom?"
Dean breathed out a sigh of relief. "What do you know?" he asked.
"We really need a doorbell," Dean growled as he grabbed his sidearm from under the map table.
"What?" He mocked. "The Wicca'd Witch of the West in there. Little Miss Positive Energy wanted a bigger office, did a little hoodoo... boom. I say we put a witch-killing cap in her ass, call it a day."
Sam had stopped too, and Charlie and Cas hovered by the doorway.
"Yeah, she's adjusting."
"Every few months," said Abraham.
"Come on in," Loraine called out. "Don't hover."
Jody seemed to think about it carefully. "I think that depends on why you're doing it."
Cas tried to hide a snort under a cough, but considering he didn't actually have to breathe, it wasn't convincing. Dean punched his shoulder in retaliation. Cas must have been expecting it because it didn't feel like hitting a brick wall. Just normal muscle.
"I'm so sorry." He whispered into her hair. "I'm so sorry we got there too late. I'm sorry you were alone."
"Dean!" Sam forced his attention back to the road.
Another long look, then Cas relented and followed Dean back to the kitchen. Sam seemed surprised to see Cas return but smiled in welcome. "Cas has a lead on Lucifer, but he's worried about Mom." Dean filled the others in. Charlie had made her own coffee, but Dean's mug was empty now, so he made some for himself and Cas.
Cas deadpanned, "Yay," brought a smirk back to Dean's face.
office.
"Just feels like yesterday," she went on, "we were together in heaven, and now... I'm here. And John is gone, and they're gone. And I thought hunting, working, would clear my head."
"Ok, so we're not the picture of mental health," Dean admitted, "but we're trying, and we keep trying to hold whatever threads of family we have together. And we would like you to be a part of that. Like Jody and Charlie are. We've had a lot of family, but we've lost a lot, too. And not much of it was blood. Jody gets to be the fun aunt and Charlie's our little sister. Alex is our niece-slash-cousin, and Claire is-"
"Which released God's sister, the Darkness..." Dean finished.
She hesitantly put her hand on his chest and whispered, "Dean."
"Well, they also cut the pole down, Dean," Cas said. "And the electricians would have had to reroute the lines. They should have just detached the cables from the home itself. This is vandalism." He sounded outraged, and Dean just patted his shoulder.
" Mary said, "
"The second time she came, she stayed longer. She told me a little of herself and how she had changed things for you. I was pleased. Then the third time she came, she told me about Magda. She didn't even have to say it. I told her I was going to be packing up right away. She let me know where to find you and when I needed to be here. So I settled things in Lawrence, and now I'm here. I'll stay as long as you want me to."
"Not so much," Dean replied. "New duds look good." He nodded at the clothes she had picked out at the store.
"I kicked ass?" She scoffed. "You saved me!"
They left Charlie there to get Mary settled. Dean hugged his mom tightly and promised to meet her for breakfast in the morning. Then he hugged Charlie and promised that Sam would be back to get her soon and she would be home with them that night.
He rushed over, catching one of Cas's elbows. The angel was shaking and holding his head with one hand and grabbing for support with the other. Elijah rushed to steady his other side.
"So here's the deal," Charlie said. "We are sort of monster-hunters, and right now, we're hunting down Lucifer, aka Satan, aka the Devil. Yeah," She nodded in response to Kelly's disbelief, "I had the same reaction. Unfortunately, a lot of the stuff that goes bump in the night exists."
There wasn't a lot of chatter as they worked. Missouri seemed far away. Dean was still struggling with his wake-up.
Transportation Shit:
"I'll be right back." He smiled at them and tapped the top of the car before walking off.
"It's the spell that Rowena is using," Missouri explained. "It can only trap the grace of the angel, not the soul of a human."
"He was," Dean agreed, coming over to crouch in front of Kelly, "but now... Tell me he hasn't been acting different."
" Beth's voice sounded old and resigned.
Dean jumped up to help her get up to her room on the top floor. She paused at the steps, though, and turned back to the group. "You all need to go to bed now. You need good sleep and then a hearty breakfast in the morning. Everyone's going to need their strength." Then she took Dean's arm to support her across the war room and up the stairs.
The night before had shaken something in one of the lockboxes in Dean's brain. One that he'd locked up so many times it was a damn Matryoshka doll of denial and betrayal and anger and grief. But it was coming closer to the surface these days, and he could feel the emotions rattling in their little cage. And this morning had threatened to shatter it. But he shoved it down hard again, locking it in another layer of "not the time."
"Wow." Charlie sat quietly for a moment.
"So you'll text us once a week, maybe, but you-" he stopped, his throat tight. He turned. "I need a minute."
As Sam walked out, Dean held up Cas with a hand on his shoulder. "Hey, does he seem a bit off to you?"
Dean assessed Sam's condition quickly, used to triaging his brother by flashlight. Alive, thank Chuck. Obviously beaten, and the pale, sweaty skin and blue lips indicated he was in shock from some kind of trauma.
"Mr. and Mrs. Peterson," Sam began once everyone was sitting. "We're here because your previous caseworker, Olivia Sanchez, has passed away."
"Well, we are not taking them into a battle with Lucifer," Cas said bluntly. The teens tried to protest, but all of the adults glared them down.
"You sure you got the swing of that thing?" Dean nodded his head at Mary's EMF reader. It was kind of a moot point since all three readers had completely lit up before the door had even closed behind them. This house was very clearly haunted.
Dean was waiting in the adjacent room with Sam, Rowena, Charlie, and Missouri. He could hear when someone opened the closet door where Cas and Magda were hiding.
"Yeah. Who wouldn't?" Dean grinned and struck a chord on the guitar.
Cas looked up then and regarded Dean thoughtfully. He nodded. "That is true. I accept the idiom."
Sam rushed out of the room. Dean tried to crawl past Mary to get the iron chain, but Moriarty threw him back into the wall again.
"I thought we did, but then we invited Mary to pick a room, and she picked yours because you never decorate, so it looked empty. And now she's going to be living at her apartment. The bunker is just too much for her. Charlie needs a room, but she said she wants to be upstairs near the workroom. I think she just doesn't want to share a shower."
Cas looked confused. "I think he just gave me the plot of every story, which was terribly rude of him. I enjoy understanding a bit more of what you say, but I have all the spoilers and none of the enjoyment of the stories."
"Yeah," Sam said after a moment of silence.
"You, Jody?" Sam asked. "You didn't tell us you were in a relationship with Asa."
"Technically, only Cas has kids," Sam said, walking a little ways away from the car, apparently waiting for Cas and Dean to finish their argument. Charlie joined him.
Dean laughed despite himself and put an arm up to fend off the slaps Charlie was now raining on his shoulders. "Okay! Yes, we eventually started to find other people! Yes, Charlie! You know half of you died, right? Okay, ok! I get it! But at first, it was just us!" Charlie seemed appeased, and Dean glanced in the mirror at the huffy angel in the backseat. "And I'm sorry, Cas, I didn't mean to make you feel unappreciated. You know you're family." Cas glared at Dean in the mirror, but it was an easy glare. Dean couldn't break the stare until headlights flashed in front of him, and he had to jerk the steering wheel back into place.
Dean looked at Charlie and she took up the reins. "You really, really don't," she said. "We can find a safe place for you in Lebanon if you aren't comfortable living in the bunker. You don't have to feel trapped in a place with us. But, it's also not healthy for you to wander around alone while you're feeling so depressed and detached."
?" He was shrieking now. "Are you saying
"What the-"
"Oh, Sam." Cas' voice was soft now, and he pulled the tall man into a hug. Sam hesitated but cautiously put his arms around the angel's shoulders for a moment before backing away. "What about a... um, movie night?" Cas suggested awkwardly. He was clearly at a loss as to how to comfort Sam and looked over at Dean imploringly.
"Castiel! Angel of Thursday or Saturday depending on the text," Hugo said excitedly. He quietly hummed as they drove. "The Angel of Solitude and Tears, if I remember right."
"No, we heard you," Dean said harshly, and Cas put a hand on his shoulder.
Charlie hummed sleepily, "I think I'd rather stay down here, then. I'm happy to share with Magda, and I think Elijah should choose where he's more comfortable. It's ok with me if he uses our bathroom. I just can't handle that," here she waved towards Sam, Dean, and Cas, "much dick in my life."
"Cranky, huh?" Dean tried to focus on the case file papers in his hand. Honestly, he thought he had been handling the whole thing better than Sam had, but whatever.
The reporter asked him, "
"You okay?" Sam asked.
"Yeah," Dean muttered, "I wouldn't have voted for him, even if I did have legal ID, but I'm pretty sure Satan is worse. Especially now that Satan is in a bad mood because he and God had that not-fight and God went off to explore the universe, and now Satan feels all rejected and pissy."
Missouri gave them little palm readings at the end, which was an adventure in and of itself.
"Always, Princess."
Sam seemed confused to see Dean, but he did seem to recognize him now. He hugged him as Dean untied him, and they both helped Elijah undo Magda's chains. Elijah gently fixed up the back of her dress before they walked upstairs.
Dean spun around and realized he'd managed to miss a shiny black Bentley pulling up during the chaos. A man was coming towards them, peering into the distance at the disappearing SUV. Dean already assumed he was a douche based on his car.
Magda's hug was more ginger, and he was careful of the still-healing wounds on her back. They were keeping her under human doctors' care for the moment so that her parents could be fully charged with abuse. It had been a difficult decision, but she had made it herself. She knew she could ask Cas to heal her anytime she wanted, but she wanted justice, and the current pain was worth it to her.
"He said he'd meet us here," Cas said. "Frankly, I appreciate the break. It's been weeks, and he's been right there, just texting and texting and texting. It's relentless."
"What have you done this time, Dean Winchester," scolded Missouri Moseley.
Dean wrapped an arm around Charlie's thin shoulders and pressed a kiss into her hair. "I've missed you, kiddo. We'll talk later, ok?"
The morning came with a call about another body. Dean and Sam got showered and changed while Cas picked up food since he was already ready for the day. He had read over Olivia's case files and watched TV all night. Dean was grateful he hadn't just watched them sleep.
"Cas, you have to pick less obvious names! This is Beyoncé all over again! You and your freaking pop music."
" Charlie screeched and rushed at Mary, but stopped when the other woman flinched. Charlie let it go easily. She just grinned and waved her hands. "Wow, I can't believe I'm meeting the mythical Mary Winchester!" She tilted her head and commented, "I thought you'd be older, for some reason."
Dean followed Charlie's look over at his mom, who was staring at him and Charlie with obvious curiosity. He released her slowly and scratched the back of his head, trying to pull himself together. His mom was here. Charlie was here.
"Alright, let's go over the plan again."
"Mom, I really think you should consider coming back with us, too. It's not just about Sam and me, either. We've picked up a couple of teenagers that we're trying to help." He waited until Mary looked at him curiously, then continued. "Especially Magda. She's psychic. We thought about sending her to Jody..." He glanced over to her.
"What are you?" Magda asked, her face filling with wonder. "I can't read your thoughts; I just get like... an aurora."
Dean glared at Sam, who was still so deep in the couch, he might need the jaws of life to be retrieved. "Don't tell her that." He complained.
," Sam recited.
Dean flashed a smile and his FBI badge, not giving them time to look at it closely. "Federal Agents, guys. We need to keep going."
barely know what Spotify is."
A swell of panic threatened to break through the carefully constructed walls in Dean's mind.
He lay back and muttered more curses as he got himself into the blankets, still in the dumb bathrobe. Cas primly tucked the blankets around him, but then Dean squirmed free, not liking the feeling of being trapped. Cas huffed again and threw the edge of the blanket over Dean's face.
"And, uh," Jody continued, "here's a newsflash- dating is hard. It's not like I just turn into a boring small-town sheriff when you guys are gone. I do stuff. I hunt. I meet people. It was no big deal. Right? You shouldn't be surprised I'd enjoy the company of a ruggedly hot man."
Dean and Sam were both up and working by mid-morning. They had their computers out and were quietly plowing through research when Mary finished getting dressed in the bathroom.
"Do you think he was legit?" Dean asked. "I guess we really could use some info and help on this one."
The phone call seemed to have ended. Dean looked to Sam, who nodded that it had gone well.
"Ha-Ha." Sam retorted maturely. "Figured we'd stop by on the way home, see you, Claire, and Alex."
- Sell bunker cars
"You like it," Sam said.
There was a clanking Dean instantly recognized as chains because his life was messed up like that. He got himself settled at the window and could see the girl, bedraggled and bloody, in a room as satanic as any summoning he had done. These people were seriously fucked up.
Dean raised an eyebrow but let it pass. He noticed Cas was still wearing the sweater vest he had gotten him. It looked soft on him.
They decided not to kill Ketch for now, as he could still provide information on the Men of Letters and possibly gear if the gadgetry in his trunk were anything to go by. Cas drove the man's car and kept him unconscious in the backseat.
They had to wait for nightfall since that would be the better ghost-hunting time, so Cas and Dean relaxed against a tree to wait and watch Sam, who had settled a bit closer to the barn.
Dean just felt tired. "Well, that's super creepy." He said.
"Look, Mick. We need to set some ground rules if there is going to be any sort of working together happening here, capiche?" Dean said. "We already know Ketch is your little assassin you send to mop up the mess, but that's not how things work around here."
It was not a short drive.
Cas just looked down at him. "Dean."
"Ah. I'm not sure how to feel about that. Pranks are good, I think. But I'm sad I don't know her favorite song. Also... I really like this song."
He spoke with his mouth deliberately full, "Jody, you watching some kind of chick flick here?"
Mary sighed at the other end of the phone. "
Mary sniffed and wiped at her eyes. "And you said we'd met before when you traveled through time."
- Sam: 4dr sedan. Dark grey. Chevy Malibu, probably
"Yeah," Bucky asked, "like what?"
She did so, and everyone waited for a moment. Nothing happened. Cas stared at her and then stared at the bible.
"Mom, he was a hunter," Dean said. "It changes everybody. He was just focused on hunting the monsters and avenging you, not-"
Magda and Dean took one room so that Cas could watch over them both since he was feeling very keyed up and Dean needed help sleeping again. Sam took the room next to theirs. Missouri and Charlie took one of the other cabin's bedrooms, and Rowena took the one next to them.
They all loaded into the car. Dean was actually considering getting a vehicle with more seating if this kept up. What had changed that made Baby into a soccer mom carpool instead of his badass hunting machine?
Dean had his parents' love story etched on his core. It was pulled together from the scraps his father would mutter into his whiskey over long nights and then told over and over again to himself and his brother. Their favorite bedtime story whispered back and forth in the dark in strange motel rooms.
"Got a match."
"I thought I had," Crowley grumbled. "These yoga types. Just when you think you've harshed their mellow..."
"What are
"It's vegetable water." Dean grouched. He flopped onto the couch next to Cas. "Hey. We should have switched up your duds there. Bit stiff for this town." Cas gave him a look.
Cas spun back around, his mouth open slightly. "Dean! I never asked you..."
"Do you hear me, Cas?" Dean shook him just a bit and waited for Cas to nod. "You have to survive this one, okay?"
"I wouldn't. Vince Vincente is dead." Sam said.
The swirling confusion was back. He stalked towards the kitchen. His brain had him keeping his gun ready. He waved Mary into a sheltered corner as he passed her.
"Oh my God," Hugo said fervently and crossed himself. He just breathed for a minute, and then, to everyone's surprise, he answered Dean's question.
"All right, let's get to work," Dean said.
As he headed down the hall, he could hear Crowley sing-song, "Well...together again."
"Jody!" Charlie shrieked, just now noticing the sheriff. She threw her arms around the other petite woman.
They waited until the next morning to start the plan because Missouri had insisted on another good night of sleep. Cas had made sure to remove Ketch's memories of their goals, and Magda and Missouri had impressed on him a desire to reform himself. Then they sent him off with a lighter trunk.
Dean stared at him when he came up to the car from the gas station bathroom, and Cas actually ducked his head to check himself in the mirror.
Sam probably wished he'd ridden in the other car. They were on hour two of The Movie Game. It started with one person naming an actor, and then the next had to say a movie that person was in, and then the following had to name an actor in that movie, and so on. Games like this were much more fun with a third party, so Sam was roped into playing.
Mary gave him a small smile in return but shook her head. "Not just with computers. You have people. A family of your own."
"Magda?" Sam asked. "Magda?"
"A woman? She was human? Not angel, not demon?" Dean questioned Cas further, and Mary's hand came up like she was in school.
Dean's calm had vanished already. "You ever stop and wonder what kind of sicko gets happy off of watching somebody melon ball their own flesh?"
"Jody?" Sam called and managed to get himself out of the couch while Dean covered the food and turned off the TV.
"You can huff and puff," Billie said, "but that house is on supernatural lockdown. They can't even hear you."
"Well, to be fair," Dean piped up, "so is teleporting. But...ta-da."
The doctor nodded. "She carved his name into her chest. 'Vince Vincente.' Didn't skip a letter. And she cut deep."
Sam nodded, "Yeah, no kidding."
Dean could only nod.
Mary leaned in the back window and spoke gently to the car. "Hi, sweetheart. Remember me?" Dean bent down as well to look at the car with her. She seemed lost in memories, gazing at the leather seats. Her smile twisted into a smirk of her own.
Jody swiveled around to look at Dean. "DEAN WINCHESTER. You kidnapped two children?"
"That's a lie." Jody just called him out on it.
Dean chuckled. "Sure, we'd love to come in." He gave her a hug and a peck on the cheek as he came in.
"Oh my god, they're trying to colonize the hunters!" Charlie exclaimed. "That's like the most classic of British moves."
"She's hurting her." Elijah seemed upset.
Cas grumbled, "You're an idiot." He sighed. "I'm glad you're home safe, Dean. And I'm glad Charlie was there to stop you from making stupid decisions. Why don't you go shower and we'll introduce her to the other troublemakers?"
"Don't tell her what?" Sam asked.
Dean was through the door in an instant. He patted Sam down for injuries, then looked Mary and Jody over. Everyone seemed battered but intact. Jody had a cut on her arm that seemed to be the worst injury on the survivors.
Dean was angry now. Not that there had been an accident, he had no room to judge someone for hurting a friend on accident. He had even hurt his friends on purpose on occasion. But to defile his friend's body like that was a step too far. And Dean had always claimed his own sins.
"And?" Dean pressed. Sam always did this, giving out information in little pieces.
Charlie stood and paced a little. Dean realized that her hands were shaking, and he wondered what else he'd been missing. She raked her fingers through her wavy hair.
The woods were quiet near the garden where Chuck and Amara had left. Night had fallen, and a woman stumbled over a sharp stick as it poked into her bare feet. A man was walking towards her, his slight missteps more the product of confusion and exhaustion than pain. There was a halt when they spotted each other and the man's confusion just increased.
"Let's go. Come on. Come on." Dean hustled the other two out of the house as quickly as he could.
"We won't. I'm going to keep us together this time. All of us." It felt like a vow.
"Dean?" Sam gasped, "You're alive?"
Then Dean took a look at Cas, who was getting up to sit in the other chair by Dean. It was harder to read how he was doing than it was Sam. Also, he was studying Dean right back.
"Again!" Bucky called, and Dean decided that maybe he didn't like this guy.
"No. No, no, you're- you're a badass sheriff chick. You're not a-a rom-com chick." He sat up. "Wait, are you a rom-com chick?"
He pulled out his phone and stared at it for a moment before getting a message typed out.
"We're not sure yet," Dean said.
"I'm very honored to meet you, though, Mary," Cas said quietly. "I'm so sorry Sam isn't here. I will find him."
Charlie and Cas were waiting when they got to the bunker. There was a hubbub of greetings and back-slaps. They were all tired, though, and began to wander through the map room towards the dorm rooms.
"Yeah, that's what I thought." Sam cleared his throat a third time, and Dean reached over and unplugged the headphone jack from his brother's phone.
"Unfortunately, I'm completely serious, and I need it fast. I got a teen psychic that we have to keep in our custody, and her little brother is under eighteen. So we have to make sure they don't get shipped off to their aunt in Nowheresville. And Cas gets to be Daddy Day Care because apparently, his brain is all Rainbow Connection instead of regular shitty thoughts like the rest of us mortals."
Dean leaned his head back and laughed. "Sorry, Cas, the gorilla is Chuck. Like he's this huge thing we just aren't talking about. If we're following some script it's gotta be his, right?"
Dean sighed. "You keep it for now. I'll be fine with apple juice." Cas nodded and put the key back into his pocket. "Sam, you find anything? Anyone powerful or respectable who suddenly changed. Or exploded?"
Charlie dissolved into giggles. Sam snorted and put his earbuds back in.
"Because I'd lost our food money in a fucking card game," Dean muttered.
Cas and Dean were staring at her with a different kind of shock now. They looked at Charlie, who stared back, wide-eyed and confused. Mary was pushing past Sam and Charlie to get to the door now.
"Alright, so what do we do next," Dean asked as he opened the weapons bed of the trunk. Sam immediately pulled out an EMF reader. "What's that for?"
"You said that God's...sister...Amara said she was going to give you what you needed. And you thought she brought me back? Do you think she brought Charlie too?"
Dean nodded. "Okay. Cas, can you clean up his blood completely from the area and his clothes?" When Cas nodded and got to work, he turned to the priest. "Is there a parishioner who either has a terrible memory or is completely loyal to you? We need to say you were visiting someone late and just came back to find this."
" Jody said, loudly now, "
"Swell." Dean pushed the word out.
"We need to go in, now," Missouri told them. She nodded to Cas, and he pushed past the brothers and shoved the door open, breaking the lock on the door. He started into the room first.
"Elijah?" Abraham called, and Dean realized the teen had followed his father to the barn. Dean pressed against a crack to hear better. "What's wrong?"
"Like it matters," Crowley said. "What Lucifer made that woman do has got nothing to do with music. It's about devotion."
"It hasn't been very long."
"Alright. Let's get this wheel on." Abraham said. "On three. One... two... three." Dean and Abraham held the rudimentary jack in place, so the buggy was lifted, and Elijah slid the wheel onto the axle. "Okay."
"I'm just saying-"
"Why didn't you just ask Cas to change their memories again?" Charlie cried. "Like on the road?"
"Crowley, still not helping," Sam scolded from his corner. He looked over at Kelly. "Listen, we know what we're talking about here. We have been on Lucifer's trail for a long time."
Charlie was squished into a corner of the backseat. She and Sam had tried the "lean on each other" method of sleeping that only worked with someone who wasn't three times your size. Sam was stretched across the backseat, snoring loudly. Charlie had decided her best method to get more room was to put her legs up over the front seat into Cas's space. Cas just ignored her and made Dean drink Sam's coffee, too.
They looked at each other, and Dean nodded and rose. Cas was stronger, but Dean knew more about mechanics and equipment, so he went out with the Petersons.
"Onwards and upwards." Crowley intoned. "He's gone big."
"They're a myth." Mary protested as Dean led the way down the steps to the map room's main level, his boots loud on the metal. "An old hunter's story."
All three interrupted him and then paused to look at each other. Cas gestured to Mary to lead the protest.
"Not since like the very beginning!" argued Dean as his phone chirped. Sam held up a hand before Dean could either get in the car or check his phone.
"Even if Crowley does bring in Rowena, the problem remains," Cas said. "Lucifer can't be returned to the cage inside his vessel. His essence has to be extracted."
They had a boisterous pizza dinner piled around one of the bedrooms. There was a semblance of a plan for the first time, and everyone was excited. Even the tension between Crowley and Cas was lower than usual. Everyone made stupid jokes about President Satan, and there were debates on whether Lucifer could have possessed Reagan as well.
" Sam said, confused. He put the phone on speaker.
"Well, not yet, but it kinda turns into soup in your belly." He replied.
Cas nodded seriously. "I'll see what's in the kitchen."
The tension in the bunker increased. Dean, Cas, and Sam still had no plan or means of fighting Lucifer, but he was just killing more people and using more influential people. Cas was withdrawing again, no matter how much Dean tried to tell him that this wasn't his fault.
He had Elijah working on building a new kitchen table that could seat everyone easily. It was using the old kitchen table's metal pieces, and he'd found similar fixings to extend the table. When finished, it would have eight swinging stools, four on each side.
"Why not?" Charlie asked. "He was in his vessel when Sam dropped him back down there."
"I understand, Dean. Childhood traumas can cause significant effects on the psyche, even when there are greater traumas later. I will refrain from giving my own opinions on John Winchester's parenting." Cas' hand tightened on Dean's ankle, then released. "I understand that he was confused and grieving at the time. You were frightened and worried about losing the little family you had left. That is a valid fear."
"That's fine, Cas," Dean said, then worried he sounded too abrupt and was thankful when Charlie backed him up.
"Oh." Dean was hit with extremely unwanted ideas of what his parents might have done in the backseat of his beloved Baby. He straightened up and caught Charlie's eyes. She seemed to have picked up the same vibes he was, but instead of feeling slightly queasy, she was holding both hands over her mouth to keep her giggles inside. He swallowed and broke eye contact, blushing out of prudish embarrassment he hadn't thought he possessed any more. "We should go."
Now Jody sat up with interest, her eyebrows raised. "Really?" But her tone was curious, not condemning and Dean was a bit surprised. She even sat forward, seeming eager to hear more, when the television interrupted this horrible conversation.
"Hey there," Sam said. He hugged her and kissed her cheek too, and they all made it into the living room. It was as comfortably plaid as any place the brothers had ever decorated, and Jody herself was wearing the flannel pajama pants. "Yeah, we just, uh, finished a hunt in Brookings," Sam said.
Cas ended up as the designated pie cutter since he could make the most precisely even slices. Dean and Charlie hovered nearby with their plates, but Dean watched as his brother and mother stared at each other.
"What?" Bucky choked out.
"Sam," Dean whispered, "that's not Jody, but you cannot hurt her. You know that right?"
"I can't believe I let you talk me into this."
Sam mostly ignored him. "So how well did you know Olivia?" He asked Beth.
The teens were loading up plates, and Dean went over to sit beside Cas. The angel was looking over the list Dean had made.
"I'm sorry I'm such a smartass," she said eventually. "Sometimes I just can't help the words that pop into my head."
"Lucifer doesn't like to get messed with," Sam nodded. Dean figured he would know. "I guess when the Archbishop's priests figured out he was possessed, they tried to keep it quiet, do an exorcism."
Elijah latched himself onto an emotional Cas. Dean pulled Magda into his arms, and she wrapped hers tightly around his waist. Sam lifted Missouri out of her chair to introduce her to Charlie and give her a massive squeeze. Eventually, they all swapped around and got a full set of hugs.
Charlie smiled at her. "No, but it doesn't always feel like you can see me. And I'm not sure we're the... best fit to travel together... I mean-" she took a deep breath and looked to Dean for reassurance. He nodded and she continued. "I like traveling with you, but I don't feel safe right now. The way I died... I was alone and running and I need some stability. I thought this was going to be a short trip, like with Cas. I need some stability now."
Dean looked back at Beth, who was giving him a look of dawning comprehension.
"Tell me I'm wrong," Billie said, not breaking eye contact with Mary.
"I don't think it's that, Cas. He seems out of it like he isn't even hearing us, or like he's hearing something else instead of us. We'd better stay close to him anyway."
Sam dropped Dean off at the bunker with takeout for the teens and then went to go get groceries for themselves and supplies for Mary's new apartment. The girls kept texting every couple of minutes as they thought of something new they needed.
"The what?"
"Charlie gave you WHAT for homework?" Dean screeched like a man. The teens were on Cas's phone on a video, and Dean had been watching over Cas's shoulder when he'd noticed what book Magda was reading.
"I need to leave this scintillating conversation," she said as she left.
"Hey," he answered. Dean couldn't tell who was on the other end and exchanged confused looks with Cas. "Listen, Magda is still alive... Yes, Magda's not dead." Dean and Cas were following quietly behind. "She's alive!"
God!" Charlie stepped between the two. "Hey, back up, lady. I don't know who the fuck you are, but you are not helping things here!" She turned back to Dean. "Hey, take a deep breath, ok. Mary, Sam, and Jody are all in there together. They'll take care of each other, alright!" Charlie pushed Dean to sit on the porch steps and forced his head down to his knees. "Just breathe while I talk to the scary bitch, ok?"
Dean paused at the end of the aisle to watch a woman helping a boy light one of the votive candles. Mary's expression from that last evening, grieving and guilty, ate at him. He wanted to be selfish and keep her with him, but he also wanted her to be happy.
- Charlie: wants a small cargo van to tech up. Looking at ram promaster city
"Okay."
Cas nodded. "Then I'll buy you three minutes."
"I'm guessing the reason it had such an effect, and it did have a powerful effect: making him burn through the Archbishop's skin and scream with rage and pain, is because of the rite we used. You may be thinking of a minor exorcism, which is a prayer or series of blessings designed to remove a demonic influence. A major exorcism is a special rite that must be approved by a bishop, and it includes much more elaborate planning. It should be performed on sacred ground and should not be handled alone. There are scriptures to read and prayers to say. The lead priest will then baptize the person with blessed, or holy, water and such.
"But who was she?" Dean was about to explode from the slow storytelling.
" said Sam, which was a ridiculously naive thing for a 33-year-old hunter to say, and Dean sort of wanted to slap him on the back of the head.
"Dean! Oh my god. What's going on? I was dead, like full-on murdered, and then I wasn't, and I'm here in the bunker, but no one else is here, and there's blood and a banishment sigil, and Sam and Cas aren't answering their phones, and I don't know if you're still going crazy, and who's that?"
Ketch stared at her in shock and tried to pull his hand away, but his bindings stopped him. "What are you? Another psychic?" He looked at Sam and Dean, confused. "There are more monsters in your group than hunters!"
"We really should go eat in the library," Dean mentioned, but no one left. Cas started handing out food, and Dean and Sam sat on the floor to eat. Charlie got up and got herself a beer, ignored the adults, and brought Magda and Elijah each a soda after a round of begging. Dean poked at Sam until he grumbled and got up to get beers for the other adults.
"Anyway," Billie brushed their confusion aside, "I'm not here for either of you tonight. I just finished inside. I was reaping a fresh soul."
"What did you do?" He accused Billie.
called." The man nodded towards Sam.
"John Winchester." She confirmed. This truth was clear in her mind, at least.
"Um..." Dean held his hand up.
Mary laughed and smacked Dean's fingers as he reached for the bag again. "We'll cut the pie."
"Yeah, or a dude by his, uh, rainbow wig and leopard prints." Dean laughed.
"Dude, we've spent the last few years fighting all of Heaven and Hell and primordial Darkness. And they're like, well, but we're British." Dean laughed at Sam's mocking accent. Sam seemed whole if still hurting. As he'd mentioned, he'd been tortured by far worse than an accent in a pantsuit, and he was rebounding well from the trauma.
! I keep getting stuck in these rules that I think are still true even though we threw away the fucking rule book years ago!"
"Mom, listen to me. Your name is Mary Sandra Campbell, okay?" He held his arms out, silently pleading. "you were born December fifth, 1954, to Samuel and Deanna Campbell." She couldn't even look at him at first, but he kept talking. "Your father, he bounced around a lot for, uh, work, and you bounced right along with him, and you ended up in Lawrence, Kansas."
Dean realized with a strange additional surprise that the two women were indeed very close to the same age. Charlie was a year older, since his mom had died at twenty-nine and Charlie had died at thirty.
Dean held up the phone and showed it to Sam. "You were saying? Anyway, most words don't change that much."
They burst through the adjoining doors. Lucifer's eyes were glowing a familiar red. Sam held the egg and put his hand on a sigil they painted on the inside of the door.
"Family home," Jody commented. Her voice was tight. "Asa was just a guy."
Mary looked at him closely. She seemed to see him for the first time, coming out of her confused fog. "Oh, Dean. I spent my life running from this, from hunting. And I got out. I never wanted this for you and Sam."
"Hey, that's what I asked," Dean protested absently. "And you're doing all this because of your accident?"
They brought the contents of the trunk inside so everyone could see in the light. Now that the group had made a truce with Ketch, Magda had badgered Cas into bringing her back to see the gun show.
"Wait, is that the one..."
"How did he die?"
"Do you have any idea how I'm... alive?" She asked hesitantly.
Dean forced a smile and joked, "Yeah, it uh, didn't take." He honestly would rather be in literal hell.
"Huh. Is that why you spent the entire ride up here telling me in extreme, excruciating detail how you killed Hitler, but, uh, you neglected to mention the fact that your best friend adopted two teenagers, your adopted sister or, oh yeah, your
"On a hunt." The brothers said simultaneously, with a shrug.
"And I need six grand by Saturday," said the man leading the other agents, "but that ain't happening either."
That made Dean a bit sad. "Huh." He said. "I may need to work on that. Anyway. The video is like a joke. People send links saying it's a link to something serious, but it's to this old video of Rick Astley singing 'Never Gonna Give You Up.' I think it's been around as long as there's been internet videos. But, yeah, Claire's been pranking you."
"Why do you keep asking like one will magically appear?" Dean asked. "We've gotta reenact National Treasure 2 and find Rosemary's Baby."
"Asa Fox. Why does that name sound so familiar?" He asked.
From there, their fake FBI badges got them through to a doctor. Charlie hung out in the waiting room with the wifi so she could try to get anything on the studio's incident report.
The flannel man looked shocked. "
"Mylings?" Dean questioned and then just closed the lid of his laptop. Honestly, research was not his greatest skill. He had been working as long as Sammy and had zero leads.
Dean laughed. "That's true."
"Who did you hurt?" Sam asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
She thought for a moment. "It's weird. On the one hand, I want to be like yeah, I'm fine! Totally good over here! I mean I'm not being hunted and I do feel weirdly freer than ever." She shook her head grimly. "But..."
"Uh... sorry?" Dean said, confused. "I'd rather not owe you anything though."
Dean spoke loudly enough to stop him, "you sure were chatty with the press and the cops. 'Priest Claims Demons Walk Among Us.' Boy, that's quite the headline grabber."
"Mom, where are you?" Sam had the call on speakerphone.
"I could..." Billie drawled.
Sam raced for the iron chain, but the ghost threw him into a wall. He used Mary's body, eyes leaking ectoplasm, to shove Dean into the wall and hold him up by the throat.
"Wow," Charlie said, nervously, "I didn't know he was dating."
how to look for Lucifer."
Dean took a swig and nodded. "That's good," he said appreciatively. "Uh, Dean Winchester."
"Thank you."
The meal was loud as everyone tried to explain the last forty-eight hours to each other. God and Amara just leaving, multiple resurrections, the chaos of finding Sam, and then his surprisingly easy rescue.
A priest lay on the floor, bloody and severely injured. Cas laid a few fingers on the man's forehead, and there was a flare of grace and light as the angel healed the priest. Dean crouched down and helped the man to sit up. He was staring at Cas with awe and started to make the sign of the cross.
"Mom, get away from the door!" The pounding on the other side stopped, and Dean wrenched the door from the frame.
" Mick insisted. "
"That's my fucking
"I'll take Lucifer," Cas announced. "He's my responsibility."
Jody started laughing weirdly on the other end of the phone call. "
be defined by its father?"
Castiel asked, "Okay, so this concert, all these people, what is – what is Lucifer planning to do?
"Yes, you did," Ketch agreed, "which made Mr. Davies think that you were in trouble, which you were. So he rings me—Bing, bang, boom. Meet Bob. He's your uncle. Oh, and, um, you're welcome. Hmm?"
Cas seemed overwhelmed by the choices since he didn't usually change clothes, so Dean just grabbed him a soft blue sweater-vest and let him keep his usual shirt-tie-pants combo. They argued about aliases in the car since Cas had apparently decided he had opinions about music now.
"It'll grow on ya," Sam said smugly.
Once they were driving, Hugo in the passenger seat to give directions, Dean asked the question that had been bugging him. "Why would an exorcism make Lucifer go crazy like that? It's not like it works on angels."
Everybody gets breakfast, and then Cas and Charlie team up to look for Lucifer while the Winchesters go on a family hunting trip.
After getting a shower and clean clothes, Dean decided to start on breakfast. His mom might not cook much, but Dean had a few dishes he felt solid with. Bacon, in this case. While he heated the oil, started the coffee, and laid out cereal and bread on the table. He wasn't sure what everyone would want to eat or how long they would sleep. Cold bacon still tasted good, though, and the other things would be fine whenever.
"Hey, Dean?" Charlie had come back without his noticing, tucking a gun into the back waistband of her jeans. "If you dare start thinking Mary and I can't keep up-"
Dean breathed a sigh of relief that he was awake. He nodded at Cas, who had just returned from the barn. "Hey," he whispered, "Can you watch the first-floor windows, and I'll watch the cellar windows?" Cas nodded in response and headed for the porch.
"Oh my god, this is agony," Billie muttered. "How do you all stand yourselves?"
With a small smile, Clotho nodded. She twisted and pulled on the bit of fluff, and it became just the slightest bit longer. Then she took a spindle from her pocket and some spare gold roving. She set the thread to the spindle with a practiced hand and began to spin it out as Lachesis kept a careful eye on the length.
Mary smiled at them, but it was still a quiet and reserved smile. Dean still felt afraid.
Jody held her hands up, "Hey, my house is angsty enough right now! I have my two teenagers. You can deal with your own. I'll give my advice and help, but you have custody."
"Just do what you can. You gotta let your manna recharge, dude."
The brothers looked at each other. They had tried to show their childhood through rose-tinted glasses for Mary. Neither brother wanted to say anything less than flattering about John Winchester.
father, and I am not defined by
"Mom and Jody ok?"
When they had their pizza and settled down in front of the TV, Jody already had a show or movie started. It opened with a purple beachy sunset thing and a couple kissing, and Dean just felt the urge to shove Sam out of the room and/or run out himself.
"Well, we didn't catch Lucifer," Dean summed up. "but we did save the crowd, so I'm gonna call that a win."
"Hyperbolic Pulse Generator. Exorcisms are unreliable. This device emits a force which drives the possessing demon from the vessel."
"I know, Dean," Charlie said softly. "They are all strong hunters. They all know their stuff." She went for the low blow, then. "Dean, you have to stay here with me. You can't leave me alone out here."
"You were going to shoot her." Sam protested.
"Excuse me, Dean Winchester!"
"Aww, that's fun." Joy smiled. "Unfortunately, the girls are in Omaha for the weekend, being angsty at a Radiohead concert." Dean nodded, feeling only slightly disappointed. He had been excited to see the girls and tell them about the latest Winchester chaos and the news about their sort-of foster-cousins. In the crazy way that none of them were actually related. Well, DNA-wise, Cas and Claire probably still were.
?" She stared into space, a few tears falling down her face. "I... I need a little bit. I want to know more, do you understand? But I need to process." They nodded, starting to learn that Mary couldn't talk through her feelings easily. She pulled each of them into a tight hug, her fingers clutching at their necks and shoulders as if she could hold them together years after the wounds had happened.
"Cool." Sam acknowledged.
"Okay," she said. "Ready to head out? Go knock on some doors?" At the boys' confused looks, she went on hesitantly. "Talk to the neighbors, hit up the Hall of Records, work the...case? We still do that, right?"
"Cas isn't even a human being? How does he have enough legal paperwork to be a legal foster parent?" Jody argued.
"Uh, podcast. Why?"
"So, what happens when stuff like this goes wrong, and no one's around to help you?" He asked.
"Am I dead, then? Dean, did we both die?"
Everyone settled around the dining table, though they had to drag in an extra chair or two.
Dean nodded. "Yeah, this thing sucks, but it works well enough. We should probably get something bigger with so many people here though."
"As a matter of fact…" Sam said and raised the volume. "Study up, Dean."
Interestingly, the lyric extension of the chapter title works for both the song Mamma Mia and Bohemian Rhapsody :)
"He's almost never joking," Dean assured her. "And when he is, he usually ruins it by immediately telling you that he just made a joke. We really do need to get moving, though. So this is Magda. Elijah is her younger brother. He's around here somewhere. He's fifteen, and Magda can take care of him if he needs anything," he met her eyes, and they nodded at each other. "Sam and Charlie and Cas and I are all going out. We don't have an extra car to leave you."
Sighing, Dean rubbed his forehead. "Why just them, though? Oh, we saw Billie, just so you know. she says Amara didn't bring Charlie back, so we got another player on the board."
Dean sighed. "I thought we were trying to talk about this stuff? As a family?"
"What?" Cas asked again.
The priest nodded slowly. "Um... no. No smoke."
"Oh, right. Yes, he is the obvious hand behind this."
Cas swallowed, staring deep into Dean's eyes. "Yes. I'm fighting for... our family." He said the words carefully and nodded as though they felt right. He put a hand over Dean's where it lay on his shoulder and squeezed. "I'll be careful."
"Oh my god." Jody took the phone away. "Hi Cas, how are you?"
Sam shrugged. "Worth a shot."
"Can't argue with that," the young man on the couch agreed. The girl sat next to him, and Dean guessed they were siblings, not a couple, by the identical head tilts and speculative looks they gave Jody.
"Yes." Crowley was matter-of-fact. "Vince Vincente is riding with the Devil."
"Hey, um..." He started. "Did you mean what you said back there?"
"Everyone. You don't make a lot of friends when sometimes what's best for a family is to split them up."
"Alright. Fine. Charlie and I will head for the breaker. Cas, I'll need you to make some kind of visual impact, so we know when to cut the power. Then we'll head inside, and you guys will have to deal with anyone that comes out."
"Yes, alright." Dean paused, "Oh, uh... since the last time we saw you?" He grinned. "I killed Hitler." Sam gave an exasperated gesture and headed for the pizza.
But Dean was still at this place in his mind where he didn't want to let anyone too far out of sight, especially when they weren't safely hidden in the bunker. He made up his mind and asked the desk manager for one room with two queens and an extra cot. But this time, Cas could have the cot since he didn't actually need it for sleeping, and of the two of them, only one was human enough to get backaches.
She stopped responding to them, and they left, telling a nurse that she was agitated. Back in the hallway with Crowley and Cas, Sam filled them in on the show she had mentioned.
Finally, the single string was unwound to the edge of the finished cloth. Clotho and Lachesis were finished and ready with their thread. They carefully added it back in and left it and the bright thread loose and untethered. As they looked at them lying on the crystalline floor, they noticed a third thread that was already loose. Not one of the golden human threads, but a thin, glittering rainbow of light. With a shrug at each other, they brought over small stools.
Her body grieved most for her baby, but her heart ached most for her small son.
" Jody said in shock. Honestly, Dean hadn't known that they had ever met, but apparently, he didn't know much about Jody's personal life. "But you were..."
"Exactly," Sam said, "And this morning, his office canceled all further public appearances without comment."
Cas just dropped them on the floor. Interesting. Charlie picked them up and slingshot them at Dean. He blushed and shoved them to the floor. Then he checked out a pizza box, but it was disappointingly empty.
Dean nodded, "Twice." He was aware that this was all insane. "Your memory got wiped, so..."
"The Omen," Dean returned.
Abraham chuckled as well. "We're not that kind of religious." The brothers nodded, and he led them into the house.
"If you think the stories about Asa are crazy," Bucky said, coming closer to Dean, "you should hear what they say about you."
"Mrs. Greenfield has lost a lot of blood, and there'll be no fixing those scars, but she's stable." The doctor told them.
For Magda, the sweet: "The one you are searching for is in the mirror."
Dean stepped back with his hands up in surrender. "Yes, ma'am, I promise, that was not at all what I was thinking!"
Crowley popped back in. "You are so dead, Squirrel. I suggest a whole mountain of roses and chocolates."
"Weird, creepy, off the grid, "Children of the Corn" people? Yeah, I'm in."
"Huh." Dean took a long drink of his coffee. "I didn't see that one coming. The wicked witch
Kelly nodded, and Missouri sat on the bed on the other side from Charlie. She reached out and touched the woman's belly. After a moment, her face turned to surprise and awe. Dean reached out to stop her, but she drew back after just a moment.
"What?" Dean was startled.
"You don't really seem like a more enlightened group," Charlie commented, "what with the torturing Sam and having a personal wetwork guy."
"Elijah, do you understand? Your parents were wrong." Elijah was crying, and he nodded, so Dean waved towards the door. "Can you and Cas bring your parents back in here? We should decide what we're going to do."
Cas raised an eyebrow. "Are you ready? Also, I'm perfectly able to entertain myself. I'm alone almost every night anyway." He shrugged like it was nothing, but Dean was reminded of Hugo's words.
Someone knocked on the door of Mary's assigned bedroom.
"Please tell me you see this, too?" Dean asked Cas.
"Mom?" Dean whispered past the inhumanly strong hand around his throat. There was a sharp sense of deja-vu. "You can fight this." The ice pressed closer into his heart.
The plan went beautifully. Cas must have thrown everything he had at the wards because they lit up, flaring brightly against the walls of the farmhouse. Charlie shut the power off, and the few small lights inside the house went out as the wards dimmed. There were footsteps and hushed voices in the house, but fewer than the group had expected.
For the first time in his life, everything went precisely as Dean had planned.
Cas nodded, "We can work with that."
"Dean,
She looked at him, unfazed. "Well, Dean, I'm a chick."
The wave was coming back. Sammy looked at Beth, innocently confused, "From who?"
"Well, this is my family. My family hunts, you know? It's what we do." He shrugged and seemed finished. Mary nodded and turned to set the journal on the desk when he spoke again. "Mom? For me, just um... having you here fills in the biggest blank."
The Impala was crowded again. Castiel sat in the backseat with Magda slumped into his side, sleeping. Elijah was next to her, sometimes sleeping, sometimes staring restlessly out the window. At the moment, he was asleep, his weight adding to his sister's. It was far from too much for Castiel to bear, and he found their gentle pressure and soft snores soothing.
did you meet with a reaper? What happened?"
"M-Mom," Sam stammered, "w-what are you trying to say."
"No." She sighed, "I'm not. I miss John. I miss my boys."
He laughed and reached out to grab the bag. "I mean..."
"I...uh, I've...heard bits of it, but I don't really know the words," Dean lied. He was just completely blowing smoke. He had every Queen song memorized, but they were on the John Winchester "Don't" list, so they weren't allowed to be part of the carefully constructed persona of Dean Winchester, All-American Man (TM).
"How fast do you think their buggy goes?" Dean asked, "Like, top speed?"
Randy and Bucky looked at each other conspiratorially.
"Oh, good. I'll leave you a credit card then, and you can help them get groceries if they need it?" Dean asked. Missouri nodded.
Here's a picture of Cas's new car! There are more pictures here: http://www.oldparkedcars.com/2011/11/1967-mercury-comet-voyager-4-door.html
"Did you see any black smoke?" Dean asked seriously. The priest looked confused.
There is some downtime in the bunker as everyone waits for Lucifer's next move. Then a bloody meeting with a priest, a birthday present, and Castiel punches someone, all before the big fight!
"Yeah, who? The Mansons?" Dean said bitterly.
"Do we have any idea why this British lady wanted Sam?"
"Yeah," Dean said warily, "thought you'd be, uh, you know, long beard, suspenders, big hat." He chuckled, and Sam glared at him.
Valdecantos nodded. "Yes. It sounded like Hebrew." He tilted his head thoughtfully. "
Yes, I skipped an episode, you didn't miss anything. Nothing happened in that episode! So yeah, they went and killed Hitler. It took like a day. I'm not gonna write 10,000 words about it.
"Do you think we're making the right call, taking her in?" Dean asked his brother.
"Of course, it's me." She shoved past Dean and talked while she walked. "And I'm here because of your 'weird time.' I got a vision about two weeks ago. Sorry, it's taken me a while to settle things up in Lawrence so I could get here."
There was a crash and a cry from Kelly. "I'm afraid I'll have to insist," Lucifer said.
Sam seemed to struggle to focus his eyes on Dean. "Um, just one other that I saw. Another British chick."
"Well," said Sam. It was his practical voice. "You know, sometimes families do better after a little time apart."
"Ohh, Sam," Dean complained.
Shopping
"Very wrong." Cas agreed. "I have that on the highest of authorities. Anyway, what should we do with these two?" He waved a disgusted hand at Gail and Abraham.
"We liked her better than the other one-" Gail spoke up, "that Beth."
Eventually, Cas dropped the quiet, guilty angel attitude he had been wearing like a second trench coat and began glaring back at Dean.
"Yeah, I'm ready," Dean said quietly. "Just... stay here." Cas touched his temple, and he fell asleep.
Cas sighed and leaned back in his chair. "I know you very well, Dean. You shouldn't be so surprised."
A lot of the spellwork had to be pre-prepared. Crowley grumbled about being an errand boy but happily flitted around to gather ingredients when he realized how jealous it made Cas. Missouri sat with Kelly to the side and had a counseling session to help her figure out how she would move forward after this new information. Rowena let Magda observe and even walked her through what she was doing with each step of the spell.
did."
"What the fuck?" Mary managed.
Sam stopped them. "Okay, guys, not helping."
"I cannot leave you two alone for one
"I wasn't- I mean, I thought I covered that."
"I thought you still sucked at knowing what humans needed," Dean said when Cas produced a bottle of beer from his trench coat pocket. It wasn't hard liquor, but it would keep off the worst of the cravings. Not that he was an alcoholic.
Dean and Cas looked at each other. It was a solid plan and better than the usual, "Let's go hit stuff" plan that they usually went with. It was still hard to let someone else take control, but Dean figured Mary was right. She was his mom, so he did have to listen to her.
"Sam, that's not the plan!" Dean grabbed his brother by the shoulder.
Sam shrugged his massive shoulders, squishing Missouri farther in the middle of the backseat. "I mean, we've fought him before and kind of won? We got him back into the cage that time at least."
And seeing Cas in different clothes when he wore the same thing every day was... strange.
"I know."
"Well," Dean said, "let's see what we can do. If it is Lucifer, we can call Crowley and Rowena."
Also... guys, the bunker is fucking insane. I know they have a budget. I know they have to reuse sets and stuff. But it makes mapping the things impossible. But I'm working on it. I actually have it half-finished. it will be my fudged version because obviously, NO version of the bunker is going to work because it's an impossible paradox with rooms on top of rooms and bedrooms that move.
They went out often to meet up with Mary. Sometimes it was just breakfast with one or other of the brothers. Sometimes they had picnics in the park with everyone so Elijah could run and Magda could lie in the grass and feel the sun.
"Cas, you'll last...three minutes tops," Sam argued.
They all survived.
There was an echo as Sam and Dean both asked in scoffing disbelief, "
"I have to go," Mary said again. She was getting agitated. "That's what happens next!"
"And, you know," Jody said, "I do have a life when you guys aren't around."
Missouri settled into one of the chairs. "I've been having strange visions for about a month now. Usually, my skills are clairsentience and some telepathy, though I have had a few precognitive visions before." She looked to Magda, who seemed confused. "My abilities are focused on reading energies surrounding an object or a place, but I can pick up some surface thoughts from other people, and occasionally I see the future. Psychics are not all the same. Your abilities seem focused on telepathy and telekinesis, reading thoughts, and moving objects with your mind. I also understand you can project your thoughts, too, but we will discuss that more later.
"No, she's struggling," Sam said. "I mean, she's trying to bury herself in hunting to avoid dealing."
"Then just have some simple activities they can do around the bunker. Laundry's not a bad thing. Letting them control their own things can be very freeing for some abused kids. Put out puzzles, let them wander outside. Just make sure the cars are well secured and they can't get to them or the keys.
Dean raised the corner of the sheet as the coroner stammered on. A purple handprint seemed burned onto the corpse's arm.
"We already talked about this," Dean muttered, stomping up the stairs. "I don't think it's a great idea for so many of us to be magically sleeping."
Magda's telekinesis work with Missouri in the warehouse came with explosions and crashes that would echo through the bunker. Her practice inside the bunker usually came with shouts of outrage from people realizing she was playing with their minds again. It was never malicious. They all knew she needed to practice and had given her permission as long as she was gentle and didn't pry into their secrets. The pranks were funny, though.
"Bucky, what did you do?" asked Loraine.
"Mom?"
Dean gave a lopsided grin. "I can barely keep up with the gadgets these days myself. They change so fast. Give me a cassette player and an EMF reader any day."
She stood at the balcony and looked over the main rooms of the bunker. "Well, it's strange, but I'm glad you boys finally found a home." She looked Dean firmly in the eye now. "Now, don't you go thinking I'm here to clean up after you? I'm no one's maid, is that clear?"
Dean felt like shock had settled in as his primary emotion. He couldn't even begin to process anything else. He and Mary barely even spoke on the drive, both reeling from the last few hours. They just sat quietly in the little sedan and listened to the radio. Dean made sure it was on an oldies station so that Mary wasn't bombarded with any of the horrible trash that millennials considered music. However, he had to admit a soft spot for Taylor Swift. The girl had a way with words.
Dean was reeling. He had actually forgotten Cas was there. It had felt like one of his and Sam's normal (probably not-actually-normal) emotional debates about the nature of family that seemed to happen at the weirdest times. And then Cas, just ripping through it with such clarity. He stared back at Cas, then nodded. "Yeah, Cas." His voice was tight.
"That's n—" Kelly protested.
Dean flinched a step back in response to the sudden noise in the room.
"I hate you so much right now." Dean glared at Sam and then yelped as a wet towel smacked him in the head.
There was a heartbeat of silence, and then Charlie and Cas rushed into the gaps between the three Winchesters before anything else could be said. Charlie wrapped one arm around Sam's waist and held onto Mary's shoulder with her other hand.
Dean gave Sam a concerned look himself, then read aloud. "She was found with deep cuts on her back as though she had been whipped. Holes punctured through her hands and her feet, and pinprick wounds around the top of her skull. What's that sound like to you?"
"Don't listen to him." Crowley sighed dramatically from behind Cas and Dean's couch. "Feathers and I are all but inseparable now."
"Hello, can I help you?" asked the farmer.
"Oh, you're a cold one, aren't you," Missouri murmured. "You let them point you where ever they need you because you can't live without the killing. It's the only thing that makes you feel alive."
Dean was gaping too much to answer. Sam, Charlie, and Magda were grinning. Elijah just got up to make another sandwich. He clearly didn't care.
He pulled out his phone while Sam got in the car, expecting an update from Cas. Instead, there was a message from Mary, replying to his text from a couple of days before.
"The house is warded. I can't go in there." He murmured.
There was a slamming sound, and Dean and Sam looked up.
Charlie grabbed the duffel that had never made it back to her bedroom and hurried up the stairs to catch up with Mary. The door slammed behind the girls, and Sam physically flinched from the sound.
"Wait, Mom..."
"She's right," he pointed his thumb at Charlie. "I hate it, but it's true."
"Ah," Charlie cackled, "I never got to meet her! I've heard things, but I have to meet this girl."
"I brought my car, honey, don't worry about that," Missouri assured him.
He waited a moment, and she just looked at him in shock. Her eyes were a bit teary, too, so he tried to talk about something else.
Cas thought hard. Altering time was hard but possible. He and another angel, Balthazar, had done it once before when they were trying to create souls for a heavenly civil war. Jack had the power, certainly. But what exactly to change, and when?
"I have another lead, too," Sam said quietly. "Mylings."
"I AM NOT A CHILD," Magda burst out, and they all turned to stare at her.
"I'll even out the back for you, Mary. A new 'do is a great way to start a new chapter, isn't it? I've been thinking about growing mine out, actually!"
"I'm not guessing."
"With her, we're outgunned." Crowley pointed out.
"Soup's on!" He called.
They had actually found a few excellent online school programs for both Magda and Elijah to catch them up on school. Their mother had half-heartedly attempted lessons with Elijah for the last five years, but she had barely done anything with Magda for the first two years. Since having her pronounced dead, Magda hadn't gotten anything but intense biblical studies.
" Elijah repeated. "
"Hi," Dean managed.
Abraham sighed. "Your mother's doing God's work."
"I'm not dead," Cas said and smiled.
"Quite," Ketch replied, pleased. He began to monologue again, proving his place as a villain. "Our engineers have spent years blending sorcery and technology. For instance, we don't always decapitate vampires. Inefficient, really, especially for large nests." He pulled out what looked like a sci-fi ray gun from one of the many locked cases the weapons had been stored and brought from the car in. "We irradiate them, reorder their DNA. Their own blood becomes lethal to them."
"Crowley, can we just get the damn news without the drama?" Sam asked.
," Magda said, making it worse. "
"All right, well… I need something to keep me awake, so crank it up."
"Do you know God, gentlemen?" asked Gail.
"Yeah, fine. I'm fine. I'm fine." She looked at them firmly. "I'm fine."
"Magda," Sam's words came through, "you're not the Devil; you're just psychic. There are others out there like you, like- like me. I have powers too."
"The rock star?" Sam asked eagerly. Mary looked over curiously.
"Nobody- nobody said you can't date, right?" Dean said, slightly defensive. He laughed uncomfortably.
"August nineteenth, 1975, you were married... in Reno. Your idea. A few years later, I came along, then Sammy."
"Oh, you thought that people would buy that Jael had killed him? So you hung your best friend to cover your own ass?" He had a flash of memory,
Ketch sighed. "I don't understand, per se, but I am under orders, and I'm willing to abide by that restriction, yes."
"Ah," Dean said eloquently.
"What?" Dean asked him straightfaced over a cup of cucumber water he had just gotten out of the dispenser. It actually did taste pretty good.
Dean smiled. "Hell, yeah, she is." He tossed a smirk at Cas, who rolled his eyes over the raised trunk lid.
Mary didn't need to understand programming or hacking, just user systems.
Dean gently pushed Charlie against the wall beside the door and gestured for her to wait and cover him. He couldn't see her expression in the dark, but she gave him a thumbs up and readied her gun.
He pulled his gun and called out for Sam and Cas. The pillar dividing the map room from the library was stained with a bloody angel banishment sigil, and it made his stomach drop. He was turning to grab a second gun for Mary when he heard a crash from the direction of the kitchen.
Crowley raised his hand. "And I'm the King of Hell."
"Hey, sorry for the rough treatment," Dean said cheerfully, "but you insulted a member of our family. And also, you tried to hunt her. We don't exactly look kindly upon that here."
" The last part seemed directed to someone else on the other end of the phone.
Dean, Cas, and Sam made a quick check of the rest of the Archdiocese. They found three dead bodies: a nun with a slit throat, a priest impaled to the wall, and the Archbishop with his eyes burned out. All the crosses hanging on the walls were upside down.
"What?"
"She accidentally killed two people trying to get someone to save her," Dean said quietly.
Dean looked around at the others, then looked at Sam. "We'll need to see if there's anything useful in there, but I think that seems fair," Sam told Mick. "And then we'll release Mr. Ketch, under the strict warning that he is not to hunt anyone even tangentially connected to us."
The nine-hour drive home was quiet. Mary told them how she had called the little boy's mother while they were burning the bodies. She had been sure, and rightly so, that the children were trapped souls.
"The old-fashioned kind," Dean said, and they made their goodbyes. As they walked back down the aisle between the pews, he began throwing out ideas at the other two. "So no sulfur means no demon. Do you think padre's right? We're talking about Lucifer here?"
"So, you survived yet again, Mr. Winchester?" An arrogant British voice called up from the darkness. Dean moved his light to see the woman they had been following, her gun held to Sam's temple as he sat on a rough chair in the center of the room.
It was time to organize themselves. Dean sat down at the kitchen table with a pad of paper and started a to-do list. It quickly expanded to need a bigger chart, so he sighed and made sections.
"Only one woman came out to confront us," Cas reported, one hand on Sam to assess his state. "Mary dispatched her quickly, and then we waited for you. We decided to wait a bit before splitting up and coming after you." His glare at Mary was familiar. Dean had seen it a million times and knew without asking that Cas had stopped her from coming into the farmhouse alone. He gave the angel a grateful look.
For Crowley, the sad: "You must let him go, sugar. You will find love again."
"He went to go look and see if anyone else was here."
Driving was indeed slow and confining. Like a long hug. With these children he had helped save, who trusted him enough to sleep against his shoulder. With the soft giant in the front seat, who was his brother in all ways but blood. With Dean, who should feel like a brother but didn't.
"No," Sam said, trying to explain, "he was still a person, and he meant something to a lot of people. And Lucifer just took all that and just twisted all that up and snuffed it out. Lucifer was bad enough when he had a plan, a motive. Now he's just having fun. I mean, how many people died tonight? Them, this, it's all on us. We let him out. We're not winning. We're just losing slow. And you heard what he said."
"Mom?" Dean called back, pulling out his crowbar to fend off any ghosts. He kicked himself for letting her go off alone.
That broke the dam for Charlie and she sobbed into his coat. "Please don't leave me alone this time."
"Okay!" Charlie took over. She sat on the bed next to Kelly. "So we're going to leave the big scary dudes over there. Yes, Crowley, that includes you. You're welcome. Cas, you are making scary faces, so you have to stay back, too." She turned to Kelly, who was relaxing a bit at Charlie's casual tone. "Honestly, that one is usually pretty nice.
Billie stepped up close to Mary, "I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to offer you mercy. A one-way ticket upstairs, away from all of this."
"No." Cas glared at everyone.
"Yes," Sam said. "We need to save the people inside, too."
The pain had a physical edge to it as well. Her breasts were swollen and painful from the unused milk. Amara or the Darkness or whoever had resurrected her exactly as she had been when she had died, which included being the nursing mother of a six-month-old. She had stuck sanitary pads, picked up with the clothes while Dean had been stealing a car, into her bra to keep the leaks from showing so the others wouldn't ask questions. But her body ached for a baby that she would never hold again.
Cas sighed. "Cleveland, Ohio."
"It was just a place I stayed for a while," Dean tried.
Charlie paused mid-cheer. "That sounds... less-great."
," she turned to yell towards the other people, "drunk, Hunters... and my son's dead body is in the parlor. But I haven't killed myself yet." She gave a wry smile and held up her whiskey glass in a toast. "Small victories."
Sam and Charlie came in with packed bags as well. Sam had Dean's bag packed, too. There was nothing else they needed to do. It was time to go.
I'm getting quite the ensemble cast now. It's a little hard to keep everyone in mind. But that probably won't stop me from adding in characters. I love them all too much, and I'm not fridging them or shoving them into a corner to wait for the main characters. They show up whenever they damn well please.
"Well, things change, don't they?" Dean looked around the group. Mary was still standing at the end of the table. Charlie and Sam had the stools on one side of the table, and Cas had joined Dean on the other. He would prefer they all stayed together and in this safe place, but that wasn't how the Winchesters worked. "Alright. Cas and Charlie are going to Ohio, and the three of us will go to Michigan. Family hunting trip?"
"Wait, so some British guy just came up to talk to you at Waffle House?" Dean asked.
"I remember you," Charlie said softly.
Magda seemed to shrink into herself, and Elijah did the same next to her. Dean recognized that reaction and glared at their parents. He wanted to rip out their guts.
"And he'll go bigger," Cas said ominously.
"Never mind, Cas." Dean was in a melancholy mood now and would have sat there for hours, but Cas huffed and dragged him over to the bed. "Hey! Fucking cheating angel strength." He sat on the edge of the bed. "She just left. Everyone leaves, Cas." Dean looked up at the angel, "You tried to leave, too."
Dean grinned, "Wow, we are so related."
Cas dropped to his knees beside the bed, but he didn't look at Dean. Instead, he worked at untying the other man's shoelaces. "I'm sorry, Dean. Sometimes people just feel like they need to figure things out alone. My thing was guilt. Hers was grief. I don't know if it helps, but it's really not about leaving you specifically." He pulled at the boots, and Dean just let him take them off and put them aside.
Cas met Dean's eyes as he came through the war room towards them. Dean gave him a smile and a small salute with the bag of takeout.
It was a relief to hear Sam's voice again. He had been silent and withdrawn since the other night. Charlie had let them know the girls were safe, but that was about all they knew. Mary still hadn't contacted anyone. A case would be a good thing, so Dean nodded. "What do you have?"
