“I’m going to relax. I’m feeling very lazy.” John gathered everything up on the tray and took it back into the kitchen.
“Sentiment,” Sherlock smiled at him and handed him another roll of film.
He sent his sister a text, letting her know he would finally be able to get the rest of his pre-war things from her garage. Hopefully, he wouldn't have to stay long and listen to her complain about her ex.
“Do you want a plate or is out of the container alright?” John collected forks and napkins, as well as their tea.
They had a routine now. John had lived at Baker Street for almost four months and during that time, Mycroft had kidnapped him twice, followed him three times, and on one random special occasion while John took crime scene pictures in the rain, had offered him his spare umbrella .
“You just missed him. He was looking rather sharp, too. None of those silly t-shirts he usually wears. He had on a lovely oatmeal jumper. And he didn’t smell like any of those chemicals.” She waved her hand as if to ward off the smell of developer, and began sweeping the steps again. “I think he must have a date.”
They both leant against the downstairs entryway wall. John’s tux had fared much better than Sherlock’s. The detective was missing his tie, the top two buttons, and was covered in enough fish scales that John thought perhaps he could be a merman.
“I have the equipment at my flat to view them. I can even print some.” The words were out of John’s mouth before he could stop them. He barely stopped from smacking himself in annoyance. “Or I could email them. I have a department email address.” A part of him didn’t want that option; he wanted to spend more time with Sherlock.
The tattooed man lay face down, but he was still breathing. Sherlock stumbled a bit, clutching his side, but made his way out of the ring under his own steam.
“Anderson is on call,” Greg answered, and thumbed a text on his phone. Sherlock could tell by the way Greg’s nose scrunched up that he was texting Donovan.
began. He took a deep breath and turned back to Sherlock.
“You’ll have to okay it with Greg. They like new memory cards and raw files.”
“Speak once more about John Watson in any capacity and I promise you will regret it.” Sherlock turned his silvery eyes towards Moran slowly, letting his words sink in.
“As I got older, I don’t know, it just changed. I had this teacher, and he was great, constantly giving me problems and praising how smart I was. It was the year my dad left, and it felt good to hear that I mattered. Then, in college, I found myself challenged and when I solved it, I got this rush. It was… arousing. It’s not something I have ever shared with anyone.”  He laughed softly, feeling a blush warm his cheeks.
John closed his eye and eased back against Sherlock. Behind him, Sherlock relaxed as well. For a moment John thought about turning this into something more, he felt Sherlock’s soft cock press against him, but he was exhausted. Right now he just wanted to be exactly where he was.
“Looking for some light reading, John?”  Sherlock was back, standing close. The man was a bloody ninja.
Again, he felt the urge to touch the other man, to smell his sweat and taste the trickle of blood that ran down across his clavicle. Sherlock usually smelled like Baker Street, expensive shampoo, tea, and rosin. Right now he smelt like London, of decay, dirt and sweat. He smelt like adrenaline and victory.
“He’ll probably buy her gallery and take it home tonight,” Greg said. “I’m going to tell him we own it already and save her.” He smiled quickly at John and went to Mycroft's side. Sarah made her escape and John watched as the two men looked at his picture together. Greg’s quiet laugh drifted over to him.
Sherlock looked at him; his eyebrows raised questioningly, and John tried to explain.
“Wait, you said you solved it. Why do you need to see—”
“Exactly, Watson. It’s nepotism in the workplace. It’s the only reason he brings this insufferable—”
Sherlock rolled his eyes at Lestrade. “As if I’d hide drugs there
John had gone to war and survived to come home; the sight and sounds of men fighting were not something new. The air was thick with sweat and hints of fear and excitement. John fought the urge to gag. His brain attempted to conjure up the smells of desert sand to lay over the faint coppery smell of blood. He shook his head, sweat beading across his brow. John navigated through the crowd, his short stature second to the air of command he projected.
The rumbling baritone voice in his right ear made John jump.
Greg and Moran sat against the back, while Sherlock and Mycroft took the seat across from them. They shared the seat but didn’t touch. They communicated with eye contact and barely perceivable body movements. Neither spoke another word but held an entire conversation.
Sherlock stalked off towards Baker Street without a word and John followed. The rain let up and back to a mere chilly mist.
One night, after a particularly horrible case, they came home exhausted. While the murderer was in custody, they hadn’t been able to save his final victim. John had done everything he could, but the young lady had slipped through his fingers.
Now he just needed to sneak the record player past John.
“Totally shagging.” John’s nose scrunched up in mock disgust. He felt the first few icy drops of water on the back of his neck, sliding down into his jumper.
The shooting stopped, was replaced by soothing music. It sounded like the first part of
“What’s up with the board Sherlock?”  Greg asked quietly.
He went into the kitchen and started the kettle.
His eyes travelled to one of Mrs Hudson, her head back in a laugh caught forever, her floral house dress filled with colour and her hand on Sherlock’s arm. He wasn’t in the picture, but John remembered that day so clearly. It was a few days after the fishmonger case and Sherlock had just given her a blow by trout blow of his narrow escape from bodily harm.
“No, this is a different kind of thing. It’s a surprise, okay? I wanted to surprise you.” John felt his nerves surge, his heart hammering in his throat. He’d said too much.
“I meant the whole fighting thing.” John’s leg ached and keeping up with the taller man’s strides made it worse than usual.
“I’m glad this is where we ended up, John.” Sherlock raised his hand and lightly traced over John’s eyes. He closed them and savoured the sensation of those calloused fingertips. “I value how you see things. You are now very much a part of My Work.”
“Sometimes I go into my darkroom for hours. I like to listen to vinyl records and not be bothered,” John replied with a slight smile of his own. He licked his lips. “Is it always like this for you? Tuxedos, foot chases across London. You hit a man with a red snapper.” John laughed. “You smell like a fish.” John wiped tears that had begun to collect at the corner of his eyes.
The next day, John wrote a blog about the moulding and how it was the landlord. He left out many of the grislier details, instead focusing on the brilliant deductions of the Consulting Detective.
Sherlock pushed his hand into a pocket of his coat and pulled out his phone. When he spoke, his tone was flat. “We really must leave. I need to be back in London to go to an auction for rare books. You can change before we go. I’m not sure...,” he looked John up and down, “London Calling?... is appropriate for where we’re going.”
John tossed his phone onto his bed and got dressed.
John ate the delicious, piping hot curry while Sherlock Holmes solved the case in five pictures.
“Thank you,” John ignored his developing blush. He went into the kitchen and turned the kettle on.
“You don’t even know what I wanted. And how did you know that I was a doctor and in the army? You spouted out all that at the crime scene. Has someone told you about me?”
A misunderstanding makes Sherlock want to destroy his flatmate's record collection, and John gets to go undercover to drag his consulting detective home again.
“No need. You’ve both been cleared on this since the moment we left the gallery. I’ll have everything sent over in the morning.”
As usual, John was a whirlwind of surprises. Sherlock smiled at the delightful paradox his flatmate had proven to be.
In the beginning, they arranged all the pictures he had taken while in Afghanistan. Sunsets, villages, children playing, and his friends. Those brave men who John never wanted to forget.
Sherlock looked around for John and hesitated a second.
“John Watson,”
The rain went from a light misting to an ugly downpour in a matter of moments. John debated wrapping it up and leaving.
“Why is it here?”  John sat the bags on the kitchen table; the marmalade jar clanked solidly protesting its rough treatment. John ignored it. He strode over to look at the markings that covered the blackboard. Sherlock observed how John’s face lit with exasperation and intense concentration. How his eyes danced over the blackboard taking in every detail. John’s mouth was a thin line, he licked his lips and bent forward to look closer. Sherlock noticed how serious John looked and went back to looking at the blackboard as well.
The back of the man’s head was caved in, what appeared to be two parallel concave wounds that matched the lamp base. John fought the urge to check for a pulse. He took several shots of the table, then close ups of disturbances in the dust.
Sherlock sounded wrecked, and that drove John to keep going. John wrapped his right hand around Sherlock’s thigh, his fingers digging in. With his other he ran his fingers through Sherlock's crisp pubic hair. He followed the trail of hair, letting his finger trace the outline of Sherlock's navel. He spread his hand wide and slid it up over his lower abs. He pressed as he bobbed his head, feeling a thrill run up his fingertips when he felt Sherlock’s muscles flex from the pleasure John was giving him.
Send police to the clinic. gunshots.
“This isn’t just concrete. It's part of the moulding around the windows of this building." Sherlock motioned to the wall in the picture. "We need to go back and look at them. Lestrade will meet us. Defenestration is the cause of death for this victim." He pointed to a body in another photo. "The second was staged to confuse us. That building is privately owned, and I suspect the building developer hired someone to scare the tenants.” Sherlock went to the door.
The warehouse was old, and all that remained of it was the foundation and a few walls. The ceiling was long gone, as were most of the upper floors. John could see the night sky from where he stood.
“Do you still have doubts?”  Sherlock knelt down and pulled off John’s shoes and socks, and then his trousers. He helped him into his pajama bottoms.
“Use the camera to look for the beauty, so it’s not always about war and blood.”
When it was perfect, he left the chalk on the coffee table and returned to his room, making sure he slammed the door so John would hear it. Then, quickly Sherlock quietly opened it a crack so he could watch John.
The gallery was filled with milling patrons. John found a quiet corner next to a few pictures of Sherlock. His eyes traced the fine lines of his subjects face. Those dark lashes fanned across his cheeks as he slept post case. He smiled at the memory. The air around John changed, he could hear the sound of fabric rustling as someone approached. He waited, hoping it would be Sherlock’s deep baritone that would fill the space between them.
“I know she had that tile hidden by her napkin the whole time!”
To Lymphadei, thank you for so many late night conversations that always seem to start with... "Ok, I think this fandom needs more..." or "Have you read this? Should I read this?" You totally are my AU Muse!
Next to it was a picture of Mycroft and Greg. They stood side by side, Mycroft's face serious, but Greg was smiling. They both watched the other out of the corner of their eye. Greg held his usual paper cup of bad coffee, and Mycroft had a hand on his brelly. John had caught them one night when Mycroft had come to check on his husband, who was working too many hours straight.
“That is just a bunch of concrete I found interesting. I took those to study the contrast. I like old buildings.” John felt silly saying that.
Sherlock just motioned with his hand, John’s phone in the other one texting.
Sherlock could hear the modulated sounds of the recording. It was professionally done, and he was sure it could stand in court as a confession. The idea of Mycroft having the kind of power to electronically manipulate someone’s voice like that made Sherlock feel a bit of awe. He quickly sniffed it and paid closer attention to the details unfolding before him.
His mind proceeded to the steps of the scientific method and formed his hypothesis. When he came to the hypothetical conclusion, he knew it would anger John. No longer could Sherlock use the scientific method without stopping at this step and determining if it was a bit not good, and whether John would deem it ill advised. John’s reactions were recorded in a special speed sheet he kept on his laptop. The amount of  profanity John used correlated directly to the danger to Sherlock’s person or the flat.
John took a step towards Sherlock and watched as he whirled around from the drying photographs to face him.  The red light was still on, washing out a lot of the colour in the room. It softened their features and deepened the shadows. John wished he could see the true color of Sherlock’s eyes. He stared into them and gently guided Sherlock to a bit of bare wall next to the bench he kept for dry prints.
“He’s with me. I’ll ask him.” John held the phone away from his mouth. “Greg says there’s been a murder and he needs you to look into it.”
“That would be lovely, Sherlock,”  Lestrade said. Sally just shot an ugly look in his direction.
The gallery was located on a corner of a small square. The building was rather old and the brick facade gave it a serious air that John liked. The entire bottom floor had large windows that allowed the perfect amount of fading sunlight in. Inside Sarah’s gallery was very neutral to keep the focus on the art and not the decor. Old fashioned bare light bulbs hung from cords, and they reminded John of something he had seen on a steampunk website once. Otherwise, the whole first floor was nothing but glass and wall space.
It turned out the Auctioneer had a partner who was 6’4”, incredibly ripped, and a fishmonger. He was in the process of preparing to gut Sherlock on a bed of crushed ice and fish when John shot the man to save Sherlock.
“Surprising as always, John. Do you also love chemistry?”  He held the book with the tips of his fingers and smiled slightly.
Although he had never worked with DI Lestrade before, John immediately found him to be a decent bloke who knew his rugby.
Anthea pulled out the chair across from him and sat. She crossed her legs and allowed her boot covered foot to bounce lightly. She threaded her hands over her knee, and waited.
“Hmmm? What? Oh no, I’m fine. These pictures are fantastic. You have an eye for photography.” He took the towel from John and went back to the wall, his eyes dancing over the prints as he towelled his hair.
The first floor of the building had almost no glass left in the windows. The white of the outer walls was grey-washed in the sunshine. The door, when he stepped through it, appeared to have been kicked off the hinges. There was spray paint all over the place. The usual ‘Little Roy loves Dick’, and other juvenile prose was scribbled about the walls from the floor to about 6 feet up. Above that, there were clean stretches of ornate wallpaper that stuck in lines of old glue but hung in tatters elsewhere. John made a mental note to come back and take pictures of this place another day, if he could get permission. He’d love to capture the dichotomy of the modern graffiti and 19th-century luxury. John looked through the lens of his camera and snapped a few practice pictures. The crumbling staircase, the rainbow of spray paint splashed about.
Sherlock saw the movement of John’s arm before he heard the sound of skin on skin. Before he could stop himself, the detective had his hand in his pajama bottoms, stroking his aching erection. He watched John, shocked by his movements. John stared at the solved problem, his whole body shaking. He moaned softly. Sherlock was so close, about to come harder than he ever had in his life when he heard John’s whisper.
Whatever was coming, John would do anything to protect this. He felt himself slipping into Captain Watson mode again, only this time he felt more focused. The war had been for a greater good, but this was for much more personal.
He hadn’t a case in over a week. Sherlock could feel his brain matter slowly atrophying. The fissures were becoming shallow, the gyri unfolding. Soon it would resemble Anderson’s, smooth with occasional sulci to break the monotony.
When he first moved into that grim bedsit, he’d hated it. But now he thought of it fondly, remembering how Sherlock filled up the small space with his limitless energy. “Think it’s too late to call for curry?” John turned his head and looked up at Sherlock.
“Anderson won’t work with me. He’s a blundering buffoon.” Sherlock uncurled his long legs and stretched. “I want John Watson. He’s not a complete idiot.”
The nondescript black limousine picked them up immediately upon exiting the gallery. Anthea appeared with black zip ties and secured Moran’s hands in front of them. She and Greg helped him into the back of the limo. Then she went back to her blackberry and slipped into the front passenger seat.
John lost track of time. His body slowly relaxed, and he hummed along with the music.
“I enjoyed your photographs.” Sherlock’s tickling breath made the small hairs on John’s neck stand up.
“Yeah, you should’ve invited me. I hate gate crashing.” He tried to keep his tone light. Sherlock nodded at another man, who handed him an oversized hoodie and trainers. John looked down and saw that his friend’s feet were bare.
John stared at the way the falling rain was highlighted by the streetlamp. He pulled out his camera, his body’s response second nature. He tried to capture the way the rain glimmered in the light. Holding the camera helped soothe him a bit.
Sherlock moved smoothly but slower than usual, and John caught up with him easily.
“Have anything, Sherlock?” Lestrade pulled out his notebook and flipped it open. He hunched over it a bit to keep it as dry as possible.
“Coming?” John asked he motioned to his car.
“Sherlock, you will stop this right now. I am helping you with these, and we’re leaving together. No way you’re walking across London barefoot. Not adding gangrene on top of your injuries is high on our list of priorities tonight. God knows what you’ll step on just in here.” He used his Captain Watson voice and, to his amusement, Sherlock stopped and allowed him to help with his shoes. He didn’t say another word.
I sincerely hope that all of you subscribe to this series! I have so much more planned. I have three one-shots written, and I've started "Take Another Shot" already. It has been my story for NaNoWriMo and I hope to get it finished and ready for my beta's to pick apart as soon as possible.
“Oi, over here mate!” DI Lestrade motioned him over. “Sorry for calling you in, I need you to photograph the scene. Sherlock insists you’re the only one who’s capable of doing it.”
Greg and Mycroft walked towards him, more relaxed than he had ever seen either of them. John realized how much they sincerely complimented each other. Mycroft wore his usual bespoke, three piece, black pinstriped suit. His necktie was blue today instead of the usual red that John had noticed he favoured. Greg looked well rested and relaxed in a black polo shirt and khaki trousers. John noticed how easy and boyish Greg’s smiled looked when he wasn’t at work.
“Oi, Watson! We have a cuppa over here for you. It’s getting bloody colder by the minute.”
Sherlock pulled out his phone and thumbed what appeared to be a few texts.
“It’s yours. Do you understand about the maths?  It's just a small kink, but I meant what I said. I love you, Sherlock. I want you. I’m too tired to show you right now and if we keep dancing around it with hints and near misses we might miss out completely.”  John waited for the other man to speak. He watched as Sherlock stood at the foot of the bed, his back to him.
“It’s none of your business.” Sebastian’s eyes narrowed as he looked from John to Sherlock. John hurried to hide the raw lust he felt for Sherlock, but he wasn’t fast enough. Moran took a step closer invading John’s personal space. Menace vibrated off Sebastian in waves and John forced himself not to back down.
“He wasn’t the one licking his fingers after he touched the body and tossing evidence around as if the scene was cleared.”
“I’m so sorry.” John didn’t want to look around. He felt like an absolute spectacle.
“It was all Jim Moriarty. All of it. It was his idea. I’ll take you to where the major gun stash is located.”
Sherlock stilled and turned to look at John.
“Should take an hour to develop and then the usual drying time.” John pushed Sherlock’s tea towards him. Sherlock nodded and smiled, his eyes leaving the microscope for a moment. The beating he had taken earlier was showing. Circles had formed under his eyes, the bruising across his cheekbone was blossoming into a terrific puffy mess. After this case was finished, John resolved to turn both their phones off for at least two days.
“I thought you said I needed to change?”
“John, we go way back, you’re going to throw this away on, what? This young guy?” Sebastian motioned to a picture of Sherlock holding his mini magnifying glass, looking at bricks.
Perhaps there was an experiment to conduct there, but the record player reminded him he had other projects in the works. Sherlock glanced up and met her kind hazel eyes. He doubted he was fooling her. Still, he would continue, just in case she was having a slow day.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You are a cruel man, John.” He picked up his tea, blew across the top and took a sip. “Mmmm, a very horrible partner, who I will have to punish as soon as I solve this case.”
Sherlock decided on a deep blue silk shirt to go with his perfectly tailored black trousers. He didn’t stop to ponder why he put in so much effort.
He scanned the detective, looking at every mark and injury. Thankfully, nothing appeared to need immediate attention. His ribs would have to wait until they got back to Baker Street so John could wrap them.
“Right then. Here is the remote. The buttons let you go forward or back. Have at it.” John watched Sherlock as he took the small black remote. He paced closer to the white sheet, then back. He strode to the left of the sheet and then to the middle of the room, his body blocking the image from the projector. John realised Sherlock was studying every detail of the picture. From corner to corner.
Thank you DaringD! I'm throwing this out here because you supplied such a huge spark that gave me a key idea that will become "Take Another Shot." When I post that story, this will make so much more scene, but I think you already know what I mean! No one else knows at the moment! It's been fun keeping this bit a secret.. lol.
“Ta, Mrs H. I’m sorry you had to see that.”
He hit send and hoped Sherlock would hurry. He needed to make sure Lori was okay. He stood just as they kicked in his office door.
He barked a laugh as he realised he was holding a second Sade t-shirt.

“Oh, so this is your thing, Watson?  I figured this was some formula for drugs or something that freak was working on. Maybe a poison that kills without leaving a trace.”  She made a face at Sherlock. Lestrade looked uncomfortable, and Sherlock glared at her.
Please see chapter notes!
John turned over and gingerly knelt between Sherlock’s legs, his knees stinging a little. He leant forward and kissed Sherlock deeply. His mouth tasted of the beer and something else that was just all Sherlock. He moaned against Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock’s hands slowly stroked up the length of John’s back and John settled so he was laying against Sherlock’s chest. It wasn’t exactly comfortable, but he wanted it for however long he could stand it.
Mycroft pushed the button again and they listened to Moran moan into the metal table.
Greg uttered a noise from the back of this throat and ran a hand through his hair. He turned his attention to Anderson, pulling him by the paper encased arm to the side to talk in hushed but angry tones.
Footsteps slowly approached his door, then turned and quickly receded across the flat and up the stairs. Before John’s bedroom door closed, Sherlock pulled his pajamas pants off and wrapped his large hand around his shaft. His other hand cupped his testicles and pulled gently. Sherlock’s mind replayed the sound of his name escaping John’s mouth and he felt his orgasm rip through his whole body. He whole body tingled as he painted stripe after stripe of ejaculate across his chest, stroking himself through his orgasm. Sherlock’s mind went so quiet he laughed softly with surprised bliss. He could not remember ever feeling so satiated before.
.” He spoke it softly and meant it. Greg just nodded and looked over at Mycroft.
“I like to see them as large as I can to pick out details I want to work with when I print them. I can do this with the negatives too.”
John could count on both hands the times he’d been in this room. This was the first time since Sherlock had been back. The last time, he had written Sherlock a long letter and left it here, hidden. His therapist had suggested it. John started to laugh.
John finally took the head of Sherlock’s cock into his mouth and held it there for a moment. The crown was broad and the same thickness as the rest of his shaft. He needed time to adjust to the girth. He could feel his lips stretch to take it. He flicked his tongue to taste the salty pre-come that had collected while he explored. John wanted more. He slowly took more of Sherlock’s length into his mouth, groaning as his jaw strained. John sucked softly as he became accustomed to the thickness of Sherlock’s cock. Every moan, every noise that he coaxed out of Sherlock made his own cock harder. John ignored it. Everything he had was focused on bringing the other man pleasure.
London was sleeping and the regular noise of the city was muted as they left the abandoned warehouse. The only sounds were the occasional swish of a distant car and the muffled thud of their steps. John doubted they would find a cab, given the hour, and he resigned himself to walking all the way to Baker Street. The darkness felt thick and oppressive. Making John instinctively search for any sign of light. John looked at the streetlamp and wondered how the area would’ve looked under gaslight. He shuddered and rubbed his hands together briskly. The usual London mist turned into icy rain. John cursed under his breath and glanced at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye.
John spotted Mrs Hudson talking to Mycroft and Greg but he didn’t see Sherlock with them. He stood up straighter and searched the crowd for the tall detective’s Belstaff.
John turned the hot water back on for another moment. “Too hot?”
“Do I want to know how you were able to get me a fake ID that fast?” John looked at the plastic card. His name tonight was apparently Tobias Gregson. The picture was the same as the one on his passport.
The art in this chapter was comissioned from Camillo1978. She was absolutely amazing to work with and I think you should totally click this link:
“I won’t ride with you. I’ll follow behind in a cab. Text me the address.”
“You’re thinking of the night we met… I think I can arrange a delivery.” Sherlock’s hands slid up his sides and across his back.
“Colonel Moran. Nice of you to attend Doctor Watson’s art exhibit.” Mycroft’s words were polite, but his tone was icy. “Enjoying your stay at the Landmark? It’s a lovely hotel. I noticed that a few foreign gun buyers were also staying there. I imagine someone with bonafide credentials, say, like that of a photojournalist would be able to travel much easier than just a regular, ex-army mercenary who isn’t very good at his new job.” Mycroft looked down his nose at Moran, his face impassive.
“Yes, Mrs Hudson. I was just putting up my gear.”
He muttered the expletive under his breath. The ingrained habit of hitching his pack came next. He scanned the terrain, the sweeping landscape empty until he caught sight of a distant mountain. It was covered in blue wildflowers.
They ended up in the old Elektra Fish Market. John ran past stall after stall of dead eyed fish staring as he slipped and skipped in the expensive Oxfords that came with his tux. The concrete floors were slick with water and fish blood.  Rainbow coloured fish scales seemed to float in the briny scented air as the other workers cleaned their daily catches. John felt the icy chill of misted water several times as he dodged carts, trolleys, and handcarts.
Hi! *waves*
John pushed Sherlock’s trousers and pants slowly down to his thighs, watching as more skin was revealed. John gasped when he saw Sherlock’s cock. Even in the red light, Sherlock looked like something made of marble. His long body was perfectly proportioned, the embodiment of da Vinci’s ideal man. He had often wondered what Sherlock would look like naked; this surpassed his imagination.
John surveyed the room with a critical eye. A dead man sat at a table, books open and scattered around him. Anderson stood across from the body, clad in his ridiculous paper outfit holding a book, which he idly flipped through. John’s face gave an involuntary spasm of disgust as Anderson licked his finger and turned a page.
“Yes. I hate repeating myself.” Sherlock nodded toward the windscreen. “Watch the road, John.”
was written in gold script on a dark brown label. The effect was very Victorian, tastefully old-fashioned. Curiosity overrode his better judgment. He took the album with him to his room and shut the door, the hunt for his cigarettes forgotten.
John nudged Sherlock’s foot so he could stand between his legs. His hands fumbled with his jacket, pulling it around them both so he could feel closer as he leaned into Sherlock. He felt the whisper of a hiss against his ear as his touch put pressure on Sherlock’s ribs.
“Sebastian.” He turned sharply and glared at the owner of that voice. Moran wore a well-tailored suit, something that John had never seen the man wear. Even on leave, Moran had always favoured more casual clothes. The suit was beige, with a crisp white shirt, unbuttoned at the neck. His tan stood out against the starkness of the shirt.
John had three rolls of crime scene film in his pocket. Sherlock urged him to go back to Baker Street to start the developing process, which caused another round of muttering from Greg over procedure. The man had clearly given up for the night.
“I’m the Forensics on this scene. My name’s Philip Anderson.” His voice was nasally and he didn’t offer to shake hands. John watched Anderson give him a quick once over and determine that he wasn’t a person of importance.
“What? Why didn’t you take him to the Met?” John made a fist. Pain shot across his knuckles, travelled up his arm, and nestled into his shoulder. He narrowed his eyes at Sherlock. “What did Moran say?”
He ignored the feeling of sadness that crept in as he waited for her reply. Harry was the catalyst for all of this, each picture he took in a way he felt grateful to her. He remembered her that morning, before he left for training. Her blonde hair pulled into a braid. The sun had glinted on the crown of her head and John remembered squinting against the shine. She had insisted that he find the beauty in the world around him so he wouldn’t grow bitter. John had wanted to take a picture of her when she said that. He wanted to remember her forever that morning, with her good intentions, he had felt that maybe they both escaped their childhood. Even as children they were polar opposites. John had escaped their abusive alcoholic father by enlisting. She hadn’t escaped, she had followed in his footsteps.
“Simple. From the pictures on the wall, I can see you were in Afghanistan. I'd wondered. I knew it was a harsh desert climate because of your tan lines and the deep creases at the corners of your eyes. Your eyesight is fine, so it must be from squinting in the sun.” He nodded at John’s bare arms. “The brown line stops at your wrist, so your arms were covered. Determining you were a doctor was more difficult, and I admit I cheated. I overheard Mike Stamford at Bart’s talking about a friend recently back from the war who decided to be a photographer. That was unusual, so I didn’t delete it. I put two and two together.”
He pushed those feelings away; that would all unfold tomorrow when Mycroft came. Tonight all he wanted was Sherlock.
“It’s Greg, Sherlock. I've always been Greg. Remember, when your brother and I got married? It was Greg then, too.” Lestrade sighed and shook his head.
Almost a week of tedious boredom had left Sherlock exhausted and amped at the same time. The drive to the crime scene felt like pins and needles along the inside of Sherlock’s brain. This case had intrigued him from the moment he received Lestrade’s text.  His mind, now fixed on the details, stretched cautiously. Much like a professional athlete prepared for a game.
John pulled his camera out and snapped several pictures in quick succession. He could mask the horror of watching his friend take a beating on purpose. Holding his camera he was just observing. Without, he wanted to jump in and kill someone for landing a single punch on that exotic face.
Sally called after them.
“Good morning.” John called out and waited for a response. Sherlock continued to stare at the spinning black record. John went back to fixing tea and decided he needed toast as well.
“He’s at an abandoned warehouse near Whitehall. I’m taking you there.” Mycroft handed him a brown envelope.
“Fuck you, Watson. You’re useless, lost your fucking nerve.”
“I’m going to change and get started. It should only take me a minute to set up.”
“Did you see that game? Worcester was murdered, I felt like we should be investigating that pitch.” Lestrade gestured with his cup as he spoke.
“Morning.”  He glanced at the blackboard as he went into the kitchen. “Tea?” He spoke softly against Sherlock's shoulder. The detective pushed John’s favorite mug toward him; tea made exactly how John liked it.
John moaned loudly, flipped the board over, and wrote the answer down. He then stood still and studied it.
“It’s your false identification, wallet, and two thousand pounds.”
“Johnny.”
The last part of the collection was all Sherlock.
His brother’s warm arm wrapped around him, pulling him towards a black car.
“That is a lie, Mr Moran. However unimportant, we sampled your voice from your dealings at the Landmark and made our little recording.” Anthea tossed the useless paperwork onto the table and checked her nails.
“You left me a note?  When?”  Sherlock’s voice was soft and low, and it warmed John from the base of his spine.
“Oh you bloody bastard.”
John was currently on a date. A surge of irrational sentiment coursed through Sherlock. He had the sudden urge to head upstairs and start a detailed experiment on the corrosive effects of H2SO4 on vinyl.
Sherlock’s erection pressed against the fabric of his pajama bottoms, the intensity of his arousal surprised the detective. He heard the hiss that escaped John. The blond man was frustrated; this problem isn’t as easy as any of the others, not by a long shot.
His hand landed on soft cotton. It was his black, vintage David Bowie t-shirt.
We love it when people send us messages! Especially if they want to share fics!
John was always surprising him in such wonderful ways.
John put the sandwiches in the fridge and sent Greg a text asking him if he knew where Sherlock would go to fight.
His phone chimed, and he pulled it from his pocket once again. When he read the words, his stomach dropped. He dialed Mycroft as he raced from the flat.
“Good evening, Mr Moran. We need to have a little chat.” Her voice held a note of flirty menace. She wore black slacks and a black shirt tucked in. Her auburn hair was pulled back into a tight pony tail. When she had picked them up, it was down as she usually wore it. Sherlock smirked at the absent blackberry. He couldn’t remember the last time he saw her without it.
John  finished taking pictures of the scene. Since the rain would destroy evidence, he decided to keep going. He went over to the DI who stood just to the outside of the parameter, holding a cup of coffee. John could tell the man was overworked by the tiredness that surrounded his eyes. His grey hair stuck up in odd places.
“Oh hey, Virgin! Tell that cunt Watson that I owe him one. I’m going to collect it out of his arse. You don’t betray brothers in arms.” He laughed hard and started to cough. “He’ll be lucky if I get him before Jim though.” He tugged on his handcuffed wrists. The metal clanged against the table, loud over the speakers.
A humming, jittery feeling he could only call RMAC intuition settled along his shoulders.
At the sound of his name, Anderson strolled over with his shoulders back and head up and stood next to Lestrade. He narrowed his eyes at Sherlock, and John fought the urge to tell everyone present how careless the man had been with possible evidence.
John took a picture of the table and the book on the floor. Then, to annoy the man who tried to loom over him, John snapped a picture of Anderson. The paper clad man rolled his eyes and left the room with an over dramatic sigh.
“Waistcoat? You have me confused with my brother. Are the fumes getting to you down here? We can install a fume hood.” Sherlock glanced around, as if determining where such a thing should go. Flat C was much smaller than upstairs. It currently held two work benches and a few clothes lines pinned across one length of wall so that John could hang his prints to dry. John had hung a few posters to make it seem less drab.
Mycroft pressed the intercom button. “Anthea, we’re done here.”
“Excuse me?” John blinked for a moment, not understanding. His body automatically turned, and he limped slightly as he closed the distance between them. John stuck his camera into his jacket to give it more shelter.
“Later, after the showing you can punish me, yeah?”
“You’re just brilliant.” John picked up their joined hands and kissed Sherlock’s knuckles. “What kind of information will Mycroft drop off tomorrow? The arms dealing? I still can’t believe that wanker”
“DI Lestrade. It’s a murder investigation.” The woman sighed. “Will you make it?” He heard a small grunt of annoyance.
“What’s all this?” The envelope felt thick in his hand.
“Yes. You’ll do fine. Most of the time people want to do all the talking. Just nod your head and smile.” She took a sip of her drink and looked around the gallery. John had decided on simple black frames for all the pictures.
Sherlock stared at the blackboard and wondered if the spell was broken. He felt a flash of anger towards Sally. She could torment him with her silly names, but she had upset his John.
“Sherlock! You can’t just… oh, why do I bother? Hey WATSON! Just show him the pictures, don’t print anything and I want that memory card on my desk TOMORROW,” Lestrade said.
“He’s a friend, and I never have to pay for food from there. I did the owners a favour.”
“See, I told you he knew my name.”
“Oi, John!”
“Call it a hunch, Doctor Watson.” He smirked at John.
John can't seem to enjoy his day off.
“Hello dear, looking for John?” Mrs Hudson asked as Sherlock stepped out of the cab. She held a small broom and dustpan. Her hand rested on the doorknob.
“Doesn’t he need money? Who was that?” John brought the food with him.
He heard the gunfire. With instincts born in combat both in Afghanistan and the back alleys of London, he ducked down and grabbed his phone from his pocket.
“What is your opinion of cause of death, Doctor?” Sherlock tilted his head towards John.
9x-7i > 3(3x-7u)
He had turned his ridiculously large walk in linen closet into a dark room, and that is where he stored his projector. He pulled it out and set it on a small table.
Sherlock knew he’d be up soon to go to the clinic. When Lestrade sent him a text, he left without making a sound. He felt conflicting emotions, both relief, and disappointment. He wanted to see John's expression for his data collection, but at the same time, he didn't want John to see his expressions.
Greg nodded and left.
“Lestrade called him in, although we don’t need him. He’s a posh know-it-all. He does this trick where he can tell you what you had for lunch, that kind of  nonsense. Just wait until you meet him. You’ll see.”
He saw the new receptionist first, sitting on the edge of the nearest ambulance, wrapped in an orange blanket. Her face twisted with guilt as she glanced up at him. Paramedics loaded a sheet-covered body into the back of another. Deductions screamed inside his head, and he kept moving forward.
“Yeah, I mean, I took as many as I could. Who are you?” John was drenched, his clothing was icy cold and hanging on him. His jumper was no doubt permanently stretched out due to the weight of the water. He didn’t care; he was caught in the gravity of this man. It felt like a surge of adrenaline. He was lightheaded from it.
“You’re very tense, John.” Sherlock cupped water, brought it up to John’s bad shoulder, and poured it over his skin. The warmth of the water on his sore muscles made John moan.
Sherlock traced John’s scar gently. He placed a little kiss over a pinkish knot of scar tissue. Normally, John didn’t feel much there, but Sherlock’s lips pressing against it made heat rush to John’s groin.
He went into his dark room to drop off his film and gear. Sherlock never came in there anymore. John appreciated the space to work, but sometimes when he was holed up he missed the detective and the energy that radiated off of him. He often thought of their first case and how amazing it was to watch Sherlock figure everything out.
“Hello John, enjoy the fight?” Sherlock’s voice was raspy but calm.
“The song is called Shape Of My Heart, by Sting.” John took a drink and then held the beer out to Sherlock. “Put it on the counter for me, please.” He motioned towards the sink.
“Nude and in the bath?” John could feel Sherlock’s voice rumbling against his back.
Broken lamps and fish scales bring our guys together.
“I need all of the pictures you took of this area. Anderson missed that.” He pointed to a close-up of the hair and skin stuck to the bricks.
“I’ll take those for you, Mrs Hudson. And I think I’ll see what our detective is up to.” John grabbed his bag and the plate of sandwiches.
Lestrade held a cup that John recognised from the kiosk outside of New Scotland Yard. As he passed, the DI raised it in a mock toast, sending a wave of foul, strong coffee odour in his direction.
The gloomy clouds that had punctuated Sherlock's mood all day decided at that very moment to let go, unleashing a chilly deluge. The vibration of the brass door knocker clanking into the plate as he slammed the door set his teeth on edge.
“What is it, Lestrade? We’re busy.” Sherlock listened to the frustrated voice on the other end. “A locked door? We’re on our way. Text John the address. He has his camera.” Sherlock disconnected the call and slipped the phone back into John’s inner jacket pocket. The brush of his fingers was enough to raise goosebumps on John’s arms.
The first thing Sherlock noticed when he got home was that the blackboard was in his room, and it was clean. He felt a tendril of distress. Usually, John cleaned the board, but he never stored it in Sherlock's room. Their ritual had changed. Sherlock stood, still wearing his coat and scarf, his mind pondering what to expect when John returned home.
After John had known Sherlock had seen his work, he would clean the board, so both sides were pristine. When Sherlock went to bed that night, he found a piece of chalk on his pillow. He smiled briefly. It was time for much more advanced problems. He wanted to see how the complexity of the problems would affect John’s mood. The next night when John went upstairs to bed, Sherlock slipped back into the sitting room. He wrote in the darkness the light from the streetlights illuminating enough for him to see. The sound of the chalk sliding over the board comforting. He remembered ‘The Continuum Hypothesis’ from his time at Oxford because of its simplistic beauty and it exactly as he’d seen it on the board then. He knew the answer; it was part of ‘Hilbert’s Problems.’  Would John know it?
As John edged around the man, his shoes crunched on something and he looked down at the carpet. Scattered like jewels were fragments of glass all cut in different shapes. The skeletal lead shade of a Tiffany lamp lay on its side, and the base of the lamp was misshapen.
John came downstairs then.
A walk in the rain leads to a first kiss.
Sherlock knelt and picked up a piece of Tiffany glass. He examined it carefully, then looked up at John. He leapt to his feet. John noticed him pocketing the shard of glass.
“I’m looking for this book.”  He pulled it out and handed it to Sherlock. It was ‘The Sceptical Chymist.’
John laughed under his breath and threw a grey towel at Sherlock’s head and left the bathroom.
They were John’s favourites. Some of the prints were available for sale, but John wouldn’t sell these. Sherlock standing under the streetlight, his face still bloody from the fight, his eyes tired and looking up to see the rain. The next was his smile, as he pulled John in for their first kiss. The whole gallery was filled with pictures, but those were the best.
“I’m glad this is one of those old bathtubs with extra room.” Sherlock muttered under his breath.
“I need to see the photographs that Dr Watson obtained first.” He took two large steps towards John.
(See the end of the chapter for
A man made a rather high pitched scream as the two men rolled into him and knocked him down. Sebastian utilised John’s distraction and landed a punch to his ribs. The crowd scattered as the fight became dirtier. John felt a zing of pleasure as he landed a hit and felt Moran’s lip split against his teeth.
Sherlock sighed. It was too risky without more information. Perhaps John had a record he did not care for?
“You were not due to be into work today. I’m sorry they called you.” Sherlock’s lip curled up on one side. “Travel back to London with me. We can look at a flat. Central London, nice location.”
“I think you better leave.” Sherlock’s voice cut through John’s tirade, and John stepped back closer to him.
John felt more at home chasing Sherlock then at any time in the last few months. Whatever doubts he had, he decided to ignore them. He didn’t have a lease to worry about, so he could move out straight away.
“Shhh, John. It’s Sherlock. You’re in London, and you fell asleep in 221 C. Open your eyes and see for yourself.”
On the day that John left for basic training, his sister Harry had given him a digital camera; she muttered something about having a hobby besides shagging. She paused,swept her Watson golden blonde hair from her forehead, and dug for something more to say.
Hi! *waves* If you want to see a bunch of posts about Johnlock, Drarry, knitting and tombstones. Come by my Tumblr and check it out!
John couldn’t see his face, but he could smell the coppery tang of blood, almost taste it on the tip of his tongue. The blood bubbled up in great gouts and John couldn’t stop it. All he had was the film.
John opened his eyes and blinked them clear. Sherlock was looking at him so openly, his eyes and face relaxed, and John saw the unguarded happiness.
After a quick wash and rinse, John went back into Sherlock’s room wearing nothing but a towel around his waist. His phone beeped.
“I’m sure Watson takes it like a bitch so you can keep your honorary title. He was passed around in the army, nothing but a scared little shit. He was always looking for someone to protect him from the fight, nothing but a coward.” Moran spit the last word out with a hiss.
“Here John, I found you an ice pack in the freezer.” Sarah’s amused voice cut through the sounds of the crowd, who still chattered loudly. He cautiously opened his eye. The other was covered with the ice pack.
“When I was a kid, I never knew what I was going to go home to. Sometimes my parents would be happy and sometimes they wouldn’t. They would fight about stupid things, and I never knew…  In school, it was different. Maths were always constant. No matter how awful life was, no matter the mood when I got home, 2+2 would always equal 4.”
“You guessed,” John smiled.
“Sherlock!  No!”
“Goodnight, John. Tonight was lovely. Very exciting. I loved those pictures of Sherlock. So did he.” She gently touched his cheek. “He’ll be home soon.”
John kissed him softly on the mouth. He’d finally begun to slide back into sleep when his brain caught up with the other man’s sleep-mushed words. Sherlock was repeating the ‘John ellipsoid’ theorem. He smiled and drifted off.
John jumped, yanking the flannel from his face. He opened one eye slowly, the other was already swollen shut, and looked at the man who sat on the closed lid of the toilet.
John crept around the other man to capture a few more shots of the alleyway. He checked his camera and felt safe with the number of snaps he’d obtained of the victims. He started to take pictures of the buildings. He noticed a chunk of hair and skin on the brick about fifteen feet off the ground. He zoomed in and took shots of it from several angles. John opened his mouth to point it out to Anderson, but the tall man cut him off.
John looked up for a moment and smiled. He took a deep breath, picking Sherlock’s scent from  the chemicals around them, a mix of sweat, sandalwood, and citrus. Sometimes, while John showered, he would open Sherlock’s expensive body wash and smell it. It never smelt right. Something about the way it mixed with Sherlock’s own musk was different. Better.
Sherlock plucked John’s phone out of his hand and held it to his ear.
He tried to capture the calculating gleam in Sherlock’s eyes, the tilt of his head. Even after watching him and how his brain worked for the last several months, it still took John’s breath away. He resorted to the ‘spray and pray’ method of photography.
“Why are both you and Mrs. Hudson under the impression that I was on a date tonight?”
His flat was minuscule but tidy. John had covered a whole wall with photographs; prints of his time in the army and pictures of London. Sherlock shrugged off his wet coat, and John took it from him to hang up. Sherlock strode towards the wall of photos without a second glance.
“Your ribs still look like shite. How are they feeling?” John’s eye travelled along Sherlock’s bruised ribs. He could see where the stark hues were fading to a more sickly green.
Sherlock kept that bit of information stored away for later insults. Constance had been close enough to Mycroft that Greg knew her. That was very fascinating, his brother hardly ever missed things of importance.
Mycroft and Greg strode towards them and John felt the flair of pain in his shoulder, as he relaxed a little. It really paid to have friends and family in the British government. Sebastian started to look uncomfortable. He shifted his weight from foot to foot and crossed his arms.
John was useless; currently downstairs in C, developing film. Sherlock stood at the rail and glared down at the red handkerchief on the knob. John had taken to hanging it there after Sherlock barged in and ruined some prints once.
“Watson? Not a complete idiot? High praise indeed. I don’t know if he’s on today. He’s just pictures, Sherlock. It won’t change if Anderson is there or not.” Greg’s thumb swept across his phone, checking his duty roster. “He’s off today.”
John stared at that pale chest, the defined muscles and dusting of brown hair across Sherlock’s pecs. He found the small trail of hair that started below Sherlock’s belly-button to be one of the most erotic sights he had ever seen. A smoky curl of adrenaline mixed with lust twisted in his gut.
“I like this song. The words.”
Keeping their mouths locked together, John pushed Sherlock back into the mouth of the alley they had just passed. Sherlock pulled back, his eyes flickering the buildings for any CCTV cameras. With a low growl, Sherlock kissed him again. Their tongues met and danced around each other for a moment before John took Sherlock’s in his mouth and sucked on it. He ground his hips, looking for friction against Sherlock hard thigh. The taller man leaned back against the wall and pulled John into him.
Beneath the layers of his subconscious, John knew he was sleeping. That didn’t stop his heart from pounding when the shots began to fire.
The last six hours felt like a blur. They’d gone to the silent book auction and Sherlock had declared the Auctioneer a murderer. The man responded by throwing a book at him and taking off. They chased the man over rooftops and through the back alleys of London. John felt lost on several occasions, but he just followed the consulting detective in front of him.
“You look like I did the first time my work was shown.” Sarah handed him a glass of champagne and tilted her head, a little frown on her face. “Don’t worry; we pre-sold a lot of tickets. They did a write-up on us in the Style section of the Wednesday paper.”
She nodded.
A young man stood in the doorway; he had a shock of blue hair and a ring in his nose.
To my SL(SW) Morgan. You are the Alpha of Beta's lol. Thank you for taking the time to work on this. Without you, I wouldn't have posted it. Thank you for being the yin to Kara's yang. You're often the voice of reason. The "But why did he do this?" voice. You kept me from being lazy. Thank you for finding the good bits and telling me so. Those comments kept me going when I thought everything else was rubbish.
“Oh, we have a lot of information already.” She stood, grabbed the back of Moran’s head, and slammed it to the table. Her eyes cut to the mirror, and Sherlock saw her blink. Anthea pushed his head back against the metal table, his face pointed away from the door. In that moment Mycroft pushed a button, and the room was filled with Moran’s voice.
“Make sure you don’t touch anything. The Freak will be here in a mo, and he’ll know if you do,” Anderson informed him. He curled his lip back, as if he had stuck his nose into one of the overflowing skips.
“Where is your brother?” John narrowed his eyes at the other man.
He left the interview with a job that paid barely better than his pension, but the pain in his leg had dulled. He tempered the excitement he felt with a solemness that seemed appropriate for a Forensic Photographer.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment. Then a slow smile tipped his lips.
“How was your date? You’re home early.” She carried in a plate with several bacon sarnies on it. John could smell them and his stomach rumbled.
He closed his mouth and felt his lip curl into a small but genuine smile.
“The only problem I have currently is the fact that my bollocks are climbing back into my abdomen.” John’s phone rang. He fished it out of his pocket and shielded it from rain, but couldn’t see whose name flashed across the screen.
He went into is room and changed into dry denim and a Frazier's Chorus t-shirt. It was his favourite shirt, his first concert with his first girlfriend. He grabbed a towel for Sherlock.
Without looking up, Sherlock replied. “Obviously.”
Gregory Lestrade, one of the most easy going men that Sherlock had ever known, hitting a suspect… it was too much for Sherlock to take in at once. He glanced at his brother and saw the same shock on his face.
Sherlock watched the man at the table still chuckling and spitting blood onto the floor.
“We’ll go to your flat, straight away. Come on, John.” Sherlock grabbed John by the elbow and started to march down the alleyway, splashing water as he went. John just stumbled along beside him.
“You want to talk about this now? Because I had other plans.”
With a huge hug and lots of girlie squee's, I have to say thank you to lmirandas for commissioning this for me. I love it so much. Check out her stories!
Moran sat back in his seat, he tilted his head back. Sherlock could not deduce his thoughts from the angle. The man appeared to be contemplating the ceiling.
“I think they were shit.” Moran’s cheek was bruised, and his shirt was covered in blood.
Later, when he thought back on that day, he would remember that it started to rain. He felt each icy cold drop as it snaked beneath the collar of his overcoat when he jumped out of the cab, threw bills at the driver, and ran towards the ambulance lights. They washed the front of the clinic and the rain-drenched streets in a bloody red light.
“So, let me get this straight. This was all set up to catch a mole? You have evidence that Moran is dirty and dealing guns, you just brought him here to catch Anthea’s assistant?” Greg stood still, his usual over-caffeinated energy gone. His eyes were narrow and his hands clenched into fists.
“I need to go to the Met and research some old files pertaining to this case.” Sherlock switched the record player off and dropped the headphones onto the table next to it. He stood up, ran his hands through his hair.
The sun was officially up; it had taken an hour to convince Greg that Sherlock needed actual prints of the scene. It also took a huge sulk and Sherlock threatening to call his brother before Greg threw his arms into the air. He had greatly impressed John with the string of swear words he uttered under his breath as he walked away. Some were good enough that John saved them for the next time he lost a battle with the chip and pin machine.
Anderson was the first from the MET to comment. He asked what defenestration meant.
Out of the corner of his eye, he caught movement at the mouth of the alley and turned toward it. The silhouette of a man paused there; he wore a long overcoat and the collar was popped up to keep out the rain. John snapped a picture of him, then another as he came closer, struck by the man’s appearance. His hair hung in wet, limp curls, and he couldn't tell if they were black or dark brown. His pale features were made paler by the dark hair that framed it. John had just noticed this man’s unusual eyes when he spoke.
Sherlock sniffed the air. The assault on his olfactory senses caused his nose to wrinkle in disgruntlement.
Moran finally broke the stalemate, leaning in. He kept his voice low.
“Apparently you enjoy snapping when I’m asleep.” Another little bite, this one harder to show his mock annoyance.
He grabbed the rest of his clothes, jogged downstairs to use the bigger loo, and laid his clothes out carefully on Sherlock’s bed. He realised he was still gripping his phone in his sweaty hand.
