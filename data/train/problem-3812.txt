“What does that mean, Dean?” John made another effort to stand up, and Castiel adjusted himself, keeping pressure with his knee and holding his hands down away from Castiel’s throat. Was Dean really going to do this? He looked up and saw one tear on Dean’s face as he stared down at Castiel. “Dean. What does that mean?”
He went upstairs, not saying another word more to Gabriel, who hadn’t responded to his original statement, instead putting the headphones back on. He went to his room and grabbed his long knife, a gun, lighter fluid, and his lighter. Time to pay Celeste Middleton, aka Charlie Bradbury, a nice, violent visit.
“My family will be okay with Dean staying with us for a while, I hope. Then we’ll see,” Cas said.
since he first laid eyes on him."
So, I guess I should trigger warn for suicide?? I'm not sure what to do with that, so suggestions are welcome once you read the chapter. You'll see what I mean.
(See the end of the chapter for
He drew the knife across her upper throat and let her fall. She was still alive, still seeing what was happening as Lucifer covered both Charlie and herself with some sort of fluid (was that gasoline?) and lit a match.
, the little voice at the back of his head kept saying.
Dean's father was dead. He just had the dream in which he killed his mother...right after Cas had convinced him it wasn't his fault. He just told Sam what happened that night and Sam had left him. Probably angry and betrayed. Dean screwed everything up. If he hadn't run back into the damn house...if he hadn't failed so harshly...if he never existed in the first place, his mom would be alive. His dad would never have become the bastard he was before he died. Sammy would have led a normal life, with two loving parents.
Crowley smiled at him, and that, rather than his mother's scowl, was what Castiel chose to focus on. Michael placed a hand on Castiel's shoulder. "Are we dismissed, Mother? I believe Castiel has a phone call he would like to make."
"Stay where you are," Cas choked out. "Please, Dean, will you do that for me? We are about to leave to come get you."
“All right, Sam, then.” Azazel shot him a smile. “You know what Dean said?”
"Yes, but Lucifer found him. He invited us over for dinner. And he said I could bring you."
Dean felt his protective instincts rising. Lucifer had always given him a weird feeling, but he chalked it up to the name and answered, "He's fine."
“A Google search,” was the deliberate reply. “Just a Google search. Jeez, for a hacker you’re really off your game, aren’t you?”
"What did he say to you, Sammy?" Dean asked, sadness in his voice.
John didn’t care. “Not Dean. He isn’t my son. Sam. Where is he?” John felt panic welling up in him again. He couldn’t lose his son.
"No can do, Sammy. No can do. Too tired to turn around now." The enthusiasm Dean had been faking faded from his voice. Nothing left to do now but hang up.
Dean sighed. "All right, guys, I'll catch you later." It wasn't as though he had really been paying attention anyway.
........................................................................................................................................................................
With that, Azazel left, and Sam found himself dissolving into silent tears. He turned away from Dean so if his brother chose to look at him, he wouldn't see him cry. He couldn't let Dean see him cry.
Sam looked taken aback. "I was just trying to help," he said, as though that could possibly change anything.
Dean wasn't going to go to school the next day, but Sam expressed a wish to go, so Dean volunteered to drive. Why not stay and deal with school earlier than was the original plan? Not like that could hurt anything. So he put on his leather jacket and put on that mask that says "I'm just happy I'm alive."
......................................................................................................................................................................................
no, you know, you're right. but i'm in class so i have to go before brown takes my phone<<
How far they had come.
Dean sighed. Of course Sam was absolutely right. He couldn’t understand how Cas would choose him, much less put up with John to do so. “Sammy—”
Dean shook his head. There wasn't anything. He would never fight back against John. Never. He thoroughly deserved everything. It was his fault his mother died. This was nothing compared to that. But he didn't say any of this out loud, knowing Cas would try to convince him otherwise. "No. I can deal with it." He walked past Cas to the door, then paused when Cas spoke.
It rang. And rang. And rang. Sam was about to give up hope that Cas would be able to come to the phone when finally the familiar low voice said, “Hello?”
“Sam told you to call.” It wasn’t a question, which made Dean feel really bad. Cas knew Dean wouldn’t call to apologize without being told to.
"I left to find Gabriel," Lucifer said. "It is not my fault I couldn't find him."
He looked at the dark haired girl and back at Ms. Bradbury, who set a hand on his shoulder. This time, he didn't move away. "Remember to check in at lunch. Hey, why don't you bring your lunch in here?" She scribbled a note on a Post it and handed it to him. "This will get you out of the cafeteria. We can watch something while we eat."
was grinning on the left, and
Unfortunately, as he closed his eyes, he heard his door open unceremoniously. "Cassie! Rise and shine and face the day!"
Jess followed Bobby and Ellen out the door and loaded her bike into the back of Bobby’s truck. She hadn’t called her mom, so she used the time in the car to do so. Her mom picked up quickly, and said, “Jessica, where in God’s name are you? You were supposed to come right home after school.”
*****
Let me know what you thought of that!!
Dean braced himself as he heard the pounding steps of running feet. Sam rushed into the room and stopped abruptly in the doorway. He stared at Dean's face, then took a few cautious steps forward. Without a word, Sam pulled Dean into his arms. Only after their hug ended did he speak.
He was so afraid of being caught by Lucifer that he didn’t even confide to Gabriel what his plan was. Instead, he jogged down the road to school, backpack bouncing against him, and arrived with enough time to spare to find Jessica Moore.
Sorry this took so long...College is a bitch sometimes. Thank you for waiting and I hope you enjoy.
He drank until he forgot the pain of losing his son.
Sam leaned closer to his brother and stared directly into his eyes. "You remember every detail of that night except why you ran into a burning building? I'm sorry if I don't quite believe you. Why did you go back in?" He wouldn't have pressed the matter if Dean hadn't so obviously lied.
Their father and Michael left, and Gabriel heaved a great sigh of relief. He ran upstairs. Castiel laughed nervously, but understood immediately when Gabriel came downstairs bearing two large chocolate bars. "Want one?"
But of course the music wouldn't help anymore, so Dean picked up the phone and called Cas. No response. Dean thought it was because it was a Sunday morning, but that did not typically stop him from answering the call. The only thing Dean could think of that might cause this would be Cas's father coming for a visit, and that was a terrifying thought in and of itself. If Dean prayed, he would have prayed that night for Cas's father to in fact not be in town. But it wouldn't have worked anyway.
It was 4 in the afternoon, but Castiel had never felt more exhausted. He actually yawned. "Yes, Father," he said, then turned and walked out of the study and climbed the stairs to his room. Michael did not come in and bother him, and nor did Gabriel. Castiel just threw himself down on top of his covers and went to sleep, regardless of the sun streaming through his uncovered window.
The bell rang shortly after the episode ended, and Ms. Bradbury reminded Dean to check in with her right after school so she could make sure he was doing all right, then sent him on his merry way to Algebra class. He walked quicker, knowledge that he had a plan to deal with Cas lightening the load on him.
Lucifer grinned at his brother as the downstairs clock struck twelve. "Do you want to go out for lunch? I haven't had a sandwich from that cafe down by the bookshop in ages."
"She told me I was the only one. She said you trusted me. Do you trust me, Dean?" Ms. Bradbury smiled winningly at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ellen thought about this for a moment before breaking out into a smile. “They’re religious.”
Dean, there would be a steep price to pay.
He proceeded to explain the situation as briefly as he could, explained that the Singer-Harvelle’s had been threatened, Dean and Sam’s lives had both been threatened, and closed with, “and the police are in the palm of my brother’s hand, so we can’t call them.”
is way better than this." He opened up his tray and started in on the chili dog that rested therein.
They both got out of the car and went back inside. Their father was nowhere in sight, for which Castiel was relieved. He did not want to face him again so soon. He climbed the stairs quietly and went to his room. Grabbing his history textbook from the desk, he sprawled on his bed and started reading the chapter he assumed would be discussed the following day. Always better to keep up. If his father had not been home, he would have played music, but he knew his father would be unhappy with his musical taste, so he didn't.
But she also inspired confidence in him. If Ellen had called any of his teachers, he was glad it was Ms. Bradbury. He figured she could keep it a secret. "Yeah," he said. "I trust you."
Sam did as his brother said, then continued walking. Ellen and Bobby were waiting for them downstairs. “What’s going on?” Sam asked immediately.
“John’s dead.” Bobby sat down next to Ellen opposite Sam and Dean.
One footfall, and Lucifer groaned. "Castiel. Back to start." Dean started screaming.
"Cas, hey. I wanted to talk to you," Dean said. Anticipation was building in his stomach, and he felt sick.
>>Dean, I believe you may be classifying yourself incorrectly. If you were "well enough," you would never have said that to Sam.
"He is well. He has been in Michael's room practically since he got back. I suppose they have a lot to catch up on now that they are unsupervised." Cas almost sounded bitter, but the office people were looking at him impatiently.
Dean sighed. “Yeah, but she’s dead.” Sam was surprised he didn’t say he killed her (he usually did when Mom came up), but it was a pleasant surprise.
"Which means one-thirty, got it." Dean seemed hyper-focused, which was good. He wasn't thinking about the nightmare anymore, at least. "I got stuff for pie last night, but we need to make it now or we'll be late."
Triggers: self loathing, mentions of suicidal tendencies
Lucifer's eyes glittered. "You know, I heard that John Winchester committed suicide." Castiel shifted uncomfortably. "Could little Castiel perhaps have had something to do with that?"
“Sam, I know this isn’t something anyone wants to hear,” he heard Ellen say. “But it happened, and we need to pick up the pieces, all right? Dean is John’s next of kin, so he will inherit everything. He turns 18 and can inherit and take custody of you in a few months, if that’s what you want. Until then, we need to come up with something.”
"Yeah, I'll come sit with you at lunch," Jess responded, a twinkle in her eye. "Have fun." She smiled softly as she made her way around Dean, Crowley, and Meg and toward her class.
Two baked pies and unfortunately only one shower later, Dean and Cas were dressed and ready to go. They drove to Rail Pass, parking in Missouri's driveway. Cas had managed to grab what he needed and shove it into the pocket of his dress pants.
Becky smiled and held out her available hand to shake. "Hello, boys. This is Alfie, our son."
They were inside.
Ice dropped into Dean's belly. Alastair would torture Sam? Dean couldn't let that happen...but somehow he thought that if he tortured Sam, it would damage him worse than if Alastair did. There was no way he could get away with going easy on his little brother. Alastair would definitely not go easy on his brother. "Let me sleep on it," he said, shoving as much confidence as he could into his voice.
“I know, Mom, I’m sorry. I just,” Jess threw in a sniffle for effect, “I went to go see Bobby and Ellen.”
Castiel was up like a shot and breezed up the stairs, careening into his room and shutting the door. He dug his phone out of his pocket and scrolled through his contacts until he found the one he was looking for: Dean Winchester. He pressed the call button.
if you want...we can pretend we have a homework assignment already<<
With that, Gabriel fired off a shot, which hit Lucifer in the shoulder. “They don’t deserve this, Luci.” Another shot. The other shoulder. Gabriel knelt beside his brother where he had fallen and made to stab him or slit his throat or something of the sort, but Lucifer grabbed the knife from him.
"Sure." He shrugged. He had never talked to Meg, either. Well, except for the time he told her to stay away from his boyfriend, who she obviously had a major crush on. She kept calling him an angel. Or Clarence. Who, according to Sam, was the angel in some old movie.
The second they were released, it was all Castiel could do not to run outside and call Dean back right then, but he stood politely while his father introduced all of them to Becky Rosen, another writer who Castiel could easily see was trying and failing to flirt. She kept a smile on her face as she laughed and kept touching his father's arm. Castiel almost felt bad for her, watching his father's stoic face remain unchanged.
Gabriel was completely fixated on the chocolate he was consuming. So much so that he didn't notice the dejected expression on Castiel's face. It was not like Castiel was expecting him to notice, though. In fact, he would greatly prefer it if Gabriel did not notice.
Michael opened it and shook Dean's hand immediately. "Dean Winchester. I am glad to see you here. Castiel will be down in a moment. I believe our stepfather is talking to him upstairs." He stepped aside with a smile. "Why don't you come in and sit down?"
Sam's eyes widened a bit as he glanced around him. "Um, you want to sculpt my head?"
Dean slipped his phone back into his pocket and sighed. He probably wouldn't text Cas after class, if he was being honest with himself. But he wasn't going to tell his boyfriend that. Okay, so maybe he would. But he didn't know how that would go. It might be easier just to break up with him. He didn't deserve Cas anyway. And besides, he was still pretty shocked Cas hadn't left him completely after Dean told him he never loved him. He knew how messed up that was to do to the boy, and still hadn't forgiven himself. Maybe he should just finish the job.
Crowley shrugged. "It doesn't really matter. I'll just take the seat next to you." He motioned to Meg, who was watching the exchange with interest.
"No you do not. Dean Winchester, I love you, and I need you to be all right. Please can you do that for me?" Cas had won.
Jess sighed. “All right, Mom. I’ll be home by seven. Sorry I didn’t call.”
smiled out on the right. John wasn't there, the house wasn't there. It was empty space with just Sam and Dean. Dean's hand clasped the amulet around his neck and he smiled. He folded the old drawing up and tucked it into his jeans pocket next to his iPod.
Sam heard the crashing and went outside, but was not expecting what he saw. And as Dean hit the ground, he walked forward softly, so as not to disturb his older brother. He sat beside him and put an arm over his shoulder. Dean didn't move, just kept his head in his hands. When he finally looked up at Sam, Sam said, "Do you feel any better?"
Cas dropped his hand and stepped in front of him. "No, Dean." He looked at Sam, then back at Dean. "Let's go." He started walking.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I have to go, Dean. I think I hear my father calling." That was a blatant lie, and Dean could tell.
Lucifer laughed softly. "Well, I decided I was going to find Gabriel." When Castiel's eyes widened in disbelief, Lucifer shook his head sadly. "I did not find him. I went to some sort of convention in St. Louis for his favorite book series, hoping he might have been drawn there." Lucifer shrugged. "He was not there. So I thought, Oh well, I already bought the ticket. I might as well remain here. I went to a panel the next afternoon, one of those ‘meet the author' deals?"
Bobby walked into the room while Dean was worrying. "Cas left, thought you should know. Bringin' the car back to his dad."
Lucifer stood between Michael and their father, a smile on his face. He had Gabriel in an embrace, but his eyes locked with Castiel's the second he entered the room. "Hello, brother."
......................................................................................................................................................................
Dean breathed a single shaky breath before he responded. "I thought you were at the hospital with your brother."
“Yeah. Yeah it was. Jerk.”
Thanks for sticking with this, guys :) We are nearing the end.
Also, I'd love it if you guys would check out
Castiel nodded, reassured and in awe of the man. "All right." He smiled gently. "Thank you."
But sure enough, when hr knocked on the door to the study, Gabriel was standing behind him when the voice behind the door rang out. "Enter." Castiel turned the doorknob and stepped over the threshold.
*****
If you guys want a posting schedule, let me know. I can stick to one of those (hopefully) better than I can a vague notion of posting regularly.
He had read that he still needed to be careful with gloves on, so he acted as though he was not wearing them as he went downstairs to where John was still bound and gagged. Time to get to work.
“This isn’t your business, Sam.” The chill in John’s voice sent one down Sam’s spine. It was a drastic shift from the incoherent screaming, one that was utterly unfamiliar. His father had never spoken to him so coldly. John raised his hand and took another step toward Dean.
Sam submitted to her will, but wondered in silence what was going on until a snap and an agonized cry made him sit bolt upright. But it wasn’t Dean. Alistair lay on the ground, leg twisted at an unnatural angle. Cas stood above him, gun in hand. Sam watched in wordless horror and relief as Cas fired a single shot into Alistair’s forehead.
well enough. hows your brother?<<
Castiel rolled his eyes. “Sure, Michael. I am so sorry I took a shower before our brother came home.” He marched past Michael down the hallway into his own room, towel wrapped tightly around himself.
He squeezed Cas's hand. "I just couldn't deal with all of this anymore. I mean, what's left? If I stick around, it would just hurt you more. I don't want to do that to you."
"Don't cry, Cas. Please." Dean felt a sinking feeling as he began to hear real sobs coming over the line. "Cas, honey, it's all right."
Dean was going to live. He realized this. They were going to keep such a close eye on him as to render any attempt to the contrary useless. This was all he could do. He stepped up the the black beauty and weighed the crowbar in his hand.
Immediately berating himself for showing that much panic over a dinner, Dean schooled himself into a state of calm. He hugged Sam back and nodded. "Yeah. Everything will be fine."
Sam took the suitcase and left the room. John wasn’t in sight, but he moved carefully anyway, hoping John didn’t hear him. He packed up his clothes and brought his backpack with him into Dean’s room.
“Your computer teacher is an international criminal, wanted by Interpol, the FBI, and several other organizations. Oh, but she’s clever.” Ellen was impressed by the mastery behind the name change. “The only thing that is similar is the face. She cut her hair, dyed it red. Thank God for facial recognition.” Google wasn’t generally good at that, but if you scroll enough, you’ll find what you’re looking for.
"Well, yes. Dean and you are together, are you not?" Lucifer smiled, and Castiel's eyes widened.
Dean took a step forward and ruffled Sam's hair before turning around and walking right out of the office. He was slightly surprised to see Cas still standing there. Dean didn't know what to say to him. He felt bad about ranting on to him the night he found out about his father's death, especially because they had just gotten back together after Dean had been a complete and utter dick to him.
"The one and only. Been here for a while. Dad said it might not be the best idea to contact the rest of the family, but then Luci found him. So here we all are." Gabriel grinned. "Shall we go to dinner?"
"So you are leaving. Good." John got up and moved to stand in Dean's way. "You have no place here. Even if you realize that this shit you're doing is wrong, don't ever come back. Remember you aren't my son. You lost that right when you decided to be a faggot." John's voice was so calm, like what he was doing was absolutely nothing. Dean realized that for once he was sober, and that realization made what was happening so much worse.
"Sounds good. Let me know when later. I need to go. Sam's freaking out about some girl. Love you."
Lucifer sat silently for a good five minutes, lost in thought, but eventually he said, "Maybe he wants a fresh start. We are his children, after all." He put his arm around Castiel, who leaned into him. "God knows I would want one."
. He sighed and flipped it open. "Sammy!" he said, false enthusiasm dripping from his voice.
"He is back?" Castiel nodded. "Mother has him upstairs." Castiel nodded again. Michael practically ran past him and flew up the stairs, a frown deeply set on his face. "Mother?" he called as he went.
There was a pause on the other end of the line. “I forgive you,” was the cautious reply.
“Dean, what the hell did you just do?” Sam shouted from downstairs. Dean heard his footsteps climbing the stairs. “Answer me!” Sam’s angry face confronted him.
"Castiel, you really need to stop making noise," Lucifer said as Dean's screams echoed through the room, followed by Sam screaming his older brother's name. Some things never changed.
"Naomi told me you were bringing your boyfriend. It is a pleasure to meet you, Dean." Dean shook the proffered hand.
Sam took a step forward and placed a giant hand on Dean's shoulder. "Hey. You're going. If I have to drag you out to the Impala myself, you are going. You are going to pick up your boyfriend and take him to Easter dinner with his family." Dean started shaking, and Sam brought him in for a hug. "Everything's going to be fine."
Lucifer shrugged. “Personal reasons. Now, I will offer you a single chance to get the hell out of here.”
“What’s the matter?” Oh, there were a plethora of ways to respond to that, and Cas seemed to realize that. After a long silence, he almost murmured, “You don’t think you deserve to be saved.” Dean’s eyes widened as Cas continued. “But you do! I want you to be happy.”
All of this Jess knew, but she had no idea how she could possibly save the Winchester boys. It was lucky that she even knew how to get to the Singer-Harvelle house, honestly. She hopped on her bike once she left school and started riding. It was kind of a long ride, but saving Sam and Dean was worth it.
Castiel's situation had gotten slightly better when his mother had married his stepfather, who insisted the boys call him Crowley, rather than his real name. Sometimes (but he would never admit it to anyone), he was relieved that his father had vanished, because at least he knew his stepfather was on his side. He was unsure of how his true father would have reacted when he brought Dean home after about six months.
"I have already said this, but I feel that I must say it again." Cas turned around. "If this happens again...I won't ignore it. I love you, and I do not want to see you hurt like this." His eyes were full of tears.
Jess didn’t look like she was following at all, and Bobby took it upon himself to explain to her the blackmail Jody Mills might be under. “We think the Novaks have her husband and son. That would be how she is in their pocket deep enough to keep torture a secret.” Jess nodded, eyes widening, but said nothing. “Ellen, we need to get in touch with her.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas's hand slipped into his and gripped it tight. Sam shook his head. "This wasn't your fault. None of it was." He sighed. "Dean, please don't blame yourself for this, too. I can't lose you. Not now, not ever. Please don't ever think I wouldn't do anything for you." Sam's voice cracked, and with it, Dean's heart.
“Listen, I can’t really help,” Charlie said, frowning as she did. “Why don’t you call the police?”
*****
all day!"
What he didn't know was that right now, Jessica Moore was trying to call him. He didn't know John had locked himself in his bedroom and was crying, holding a picture of hia wife and children before the fire. He didn't know that John desperately wanted Dean to come back but couldn't admit it to himself. He didn't know he and his brother were the most important people in John's life. And he certainly didn't know that John would pick up Jessica's phone call and come up to get him.. He didn't know John would panic when he found Sam's room empty. He couldn't know what would happen after that.
Cas got into the driver's seat and started the car. "Don't try to talk me out of it, Dean," her said, as though he knew exactly what was about to come out of Dean's mouth. "He hurt you, and I will not just stand by."
Dean laughed. "All right, Sammy. I will."
“That place on Phillips…JL?”
“I didn’t know if calling you was appropriate. But Dean just went off on me about contacting Gabriel.” Sam shook his head. Maybe he shouldn’t have called Cas. This was probably a bad idea.
Jess pushed the button that would let her be heard by all of them and said, “We hear you. And we see the salvage yard. Are you about ready to move?”
As always, let me know what you think!
Gabriel laughed. "All right, Cassie. Breakfast is chocolate chip pancakes. I expect you downstairs soon. Michael's already gone. You know how he likes visiting our brother on his own before we go. And I'm not sure where Dad is." Gabriel shrugged. Dad being missing for weeks at a time was a normal occurrence. They were used to it by now. "Business, presumably. He didn't call to let us know.."
He picked up the phone again and called Bobby’s cell phone, but he was sent to voicemail almost immediately.
As he finished writing, Sam came upstairs and told him that Ellen had made pancakes. So Dean set his notebook aside and went downstairs. As he ate his pancakes, he pretended he had not just written the letter he had written. As soon as he had finished, he went upstairs and sank into his bed, notebook shoved under his pillow and plan turning in his brain.
"Dean said that he might torture you tomorrow. How does that sound?" Sam looked desperately at his brother, who was not looking at him at all. "Remember there's a way for you to avoid that?"
Thank you guys for reading! Comments are what keeps me going! ❤❤❤
Castiel packed his school bag that Thursday morning with a growing sense of trepidation. If this went wrong, it could hurt a lot more people than just the Winchesters. But wasn’t that his job? Protect the Winchesters? With that mission in mind, he slung his backpack over his shoulder and marched out the door, skipping breakfast. He wouldn’t need it. He knew full well the danger of what he was doing, and knew that if he got caught, food would be the last thing on his mind.
While the teacher droned on, Dean dug his phone out of his pocket and stared at it for a while. Should he text Cas? Probably not, he was most likely with his brother. And far be it from Dean to keep Cas from his brother after he hurt his own. And then it buzzed.
Ellen listened, enraptured, to Jess’s story. She didn’t interrupt, and neither did Bobby, no matter how much either of them may have wanted to. Jess finished with a desperate, “And we need to save them!”
.....................................................................................................
Dean spluttered. "Cas, didn't your dad, like, vanish?"
Dean was about to leave when he heard Sam say, in a small voice, "I know this sucks, Dean, but you need to talk about it to someone."
Michael came back down the stairs with a frown on his face. Lucifer followed close behind him, completely dressed in light jeans, a green t-shirt, and a blue jacket. Castiel noted his limp and the way he folded in on himself when he reached the couch. Castiel sat beside him and allowed his brother to rest his head on his shoulder. Michael sat next to Castiel and crossed his arms angrily.
Sam waited for Dean after school. He could easily just walk home alone, but he didn't want Dean to have to come into the house without him again. His presence usually stopped John from doing anything. He scanned the crowd for any sign of his brother, finding him relatively quickly. He was walking with Cas, their hands very nearly touching. He wished Dean would just hold Cas's hand, but Dean never did when leaving school...just in case John was waiting for him outside. The two had been together for a year, but Dean refused to come out to their father, no matter how often Sam tried to convince him to.
"Yeah. We're driving up together." Awkward, Dean. Come on. They know that...why else would you be here? He plastered a smile on his face, trying to cover up his obvious statement.
>>Good morning, Dean. I hope you will have a good day. If you need anything, let me know.
Ellen was digging deep into archives, looking for any record of who Miss Bradbury might be working for. She found information on one Dorothy Baum, her partner, and followed that trail. Dorothy’s apparent murder had never had an investigation come to fruition. But there was a common thread. Someone called Nick seemed to have been in charge of the crime that seemed to be Celeste and Dorothy’s last.
He looked around for a bit before he saw Jess, with an open seat next to her. He grinned and made his way over there, setting down his tray before asking, "Is this seat taken?"
"Dean, please! Come back. I can't lose you too."
Sam tilted his head, not trusting his mouth to say the right words.
“Well, right now I’m with the Singer-Harvelles at a restaurant. We could meet somewhere, because the two of them and maybe someone else are going to need communication things.” Charlie suppressed a chuckle at Jessica’s phrasing.
Dean stood, disbelieving, as Cas ran down the stairs. He instantly regretted what he had done, no matter the validity of the justification he assigned to it. He told himself he would never deserve Cas. And if John had been there when Cas kissed him...
“Let’s go,” Bobby said, leading the way to the old blue car. Dean had used this car while the Impala was being repaired, and the Singer-Harvelles had found it fitting to use it to rescue him. The car was common enough, if old, that it wouldn’t attract much attention going down the street.
Dean laughed at that. “Not in my experience.”
"Dean, I want to help you."
Jess laughed. "Yes?" She blushed red and started to turn around to put the camera back in her bag. "I shouldn't have asked, I'm sorry..."
She raised her gun and fired off a shot, but she missed. Lucifer had the gun trained on her head, but he wasn’t firing. “I don’t like unnecessary loss of life,” he said simply, “but I have no qualms about killing you.”
Dean didn't answer, instead turning his head to the side, confirming Sam's suspicions. Sam sobbed out loud. What the hell had happened to them?
Lucifer and Michael were having some sort of conference or something in Michael's bedroom, Castiel guessed. Why else would Lucifer have barely looked at him after the initial greeting? He had just gone upstairs with Michael and had not come out of Michael's room since. Occasionally, he could hear chuckles across the hall, but other than that, their voices were low whispers, as though what they were saying was a complete secret. That was weird. Father had taught them never to keep secrets from each other.
Dean obeyed, worried that Cas might actually try to do something about John and either get hurt or arrested. It was about a 50-50 shot which one happened. And Dean wasn't a fan of either option.
He swallowed. “Sam’s alive.” Her hands flew to her mouth for an instant before her eyes grew flinty and she grabbed Castiel by the shirt, dragging him to a corner of the hallway. Her mouth was tightened further than Castiel knew was possible. He opened his mouth to speak, but she held up a finger, effectively silencing him.
And just like that, her mother’s angry tone faded into an apologetic, careful one. “All right, then, I guess. Just be back by seven. And next time call me if you’re going to be somewhere. I was worried.”
Dean took a deep breath. "That's enough. You," he looked at Meg, "stay away from my boyfriend or so help me I will end you. And you," he looked at Crowley, "I'm flattered. But Cas would say the same thing to you that I just said to Meg." He chuckled. "Now that that is settled—"
Warning for abuse scene. Thank you guys for reading this and I am so sorry it is a little late. College got in my way.
Castiel sharply nodded again, but Sam was the one who answered. "We need to do something about Dad. Now."
"Oh, yeah, Cas, I had almost forgotten, honestly. How is your brother doing?" Lucifer had been in that hospital for months, but Sam wasn't entirely sure why. The Novak clan never talked about it.
“You did the right thing, Sam. I would have done the same. Where is Dean?”
Thank you guys for reading and commenting and being generally awesome! <3
The phrasing made Dean cringe. "I never want you gone again. But if you need to go, you can."
"Date with Cas." He grinned and kept walking.
Dean nodded along. She was awesome! How was he only finding this out now? "I'll definitely check in at lunch, Ms. Bradbury, you don't need to worry. Thank you."
"Love you too." Dean hung up, and Castiel sank down onto his bed, hoping this would go smoothly.
"Get in the car. I have to take you home before Sam has a panic attack." Dean made to get in the driver's seat, and Cas shook his head. "No. I am going to drive. Passenger seat."
Dean realized swiftly that the story was about Bobby himself, and was terrified of where this was going. He crossed his arms and leaned back against the couch cushion.
He reminded himself that it was his fault Sam had already lost both his parents. If he stayed...what if Sam lost Bobby and Ellen, too? That would be his fault. "I'm sorry, Sam. I just can't." Dean ended the call and kept driving. A few minutes later, the phone started ringing again, and he spared it a glance. Gabriel. He hadn't thought of that.
He's back!!! Let me know what you thinj?!
Cas scoffed. "You should do it anyway. I would greatly enjoy seeing John try to do anything about it." His eyes sparkled dangerously.
So this was longer than I expected. Warning for homophobic language. Thank you guys for reading and the comments and the kudos :) You guys keep me going.
Castiel studied him, and he smiled. "I couldn't just call the police. You guys would have been separated, and I didn't want to destroy your family. So I moved in. I married her. And since then, I have done my absolute best to protect all three of you from her. And I will do the same with your father, if he decides to be a raging homophobe, all right?"
“Miss Bradbury?” Jessica said, her voice crackling through the phone and snapping Charlie out of her thoughts and escape plans.
“What about Sam?” The sheriff sounded upset. Granted, anyone would be upset about something like this, but Sheriff Mills almost seemed upset with him that he did not report John. “Weren’t you concerned about his welfare?”
"That's pretty understandable. But I have to go. Class, and all that." Sam felt bad having to hang up, but he had to.
"How many other teachers did Ellen call?"
"Let me help with that," Sam said behind him. Castiel nodded, recognizing that Dean would never allow just one of them to carry everything inside. It was a gamble for even both of them to carry the bags without Dean trying to help, and right now he was in no condition to walk, really, let alone carry anything.
Dean was just hanging up the phone. “Thank you so much, Ellen. Yes, I know. Yeah. Okay. We’ll be over as soon as we can. See you.”
Castiel smiled, then, and simply relaxed against his brother, who stayed in his room for close to an hour. He was worried about Dean, who had not ended up texting him after his class, but his brother was a calming presence. They did not talk about anything, instead basically cuddling until it was time for lunch.
“Goodbye, Dean.”
"Are you breaking up with me, Dean?" There was a slight tremble in Cas's voice.
Jess nodded carefully. “I’ll go after school.” She turned and went into her English class, and Castiel looked after her, happy that he had finally been able to get help.
"No problem," he said. Soon after that, the bell rang, and he looked down at his half-eaten chili dog in dismay. Oh well, he thought. Those pictures were more important anyway.
Dean did just that, sinking into the couch. "So how are you? I don't think we've talked in ages." He took in the outfit Michael was wearing and was slightly relieved. He was wearing a black suit and necktie. But then again, this was Michael, and Dean remembered Cas telling him his oldest brother took things like this extremely seriously.
"I have to do this. I just have to." Dean felt his resolve crumbling. This would hurt Cas. Wouldn't staying hurt Cas? Dean was extremely conflicted. Why had he answered his damn phone?
pretending this is not happening, do you understand that?” Castiel glared down at John Winchester.
He frowned. “Yeah, he did, but—”
“Dean came in late.” Sam gave a shaky sigh. “Now he’s unconscious. I’m going to have to try to wake him up so I can clean up his face in a minute. I thought I should probably warn you before you saw him. It’s a mess.”
Sam lies in bed and thinks. Castiel gets some news. Dean panics Ellen.
“His name is Lucifer, Gabriel. And no. Michael and I will be going to pick him up as soon as we are finished eating.” With that, their father placed his last bite in his mouth, chewed, and swallowed slowly. He stood and took his bowl to the sink, rinsing it just as Gabriel had.
“You don’t need to do that, Dean. I’ll be fine.” Sam knew he’d be safer with Bobby and Ellen, but he wasn’t sure if he wanted to leave here.
Lucifer smiled. “Good. It’s time I paid her a visit. Too bad the girl will be in the way. I don’t like unnecessary loss of life.” If he left tonight, that would leave Gabriel, Michael, Alastair, and Azazel to guard the Winchesters. He’d have to get one of them to knock Castiel out and tie him up somewhere while he was gone.
Dean felt absolutely horrible for going off on Sam the way he had. What gave him the right to hurt his brother? He made his way to the biology room, sitting in the back, as usual, and buried his head in his hands. Sam had been about to cry. He had almost made his brother cry. If anyone else had done the same thing, Dean would have ripped his lungs out. Why should it be any different now that it was Dean doing that to his brother?
Bobby broke in here. “Ellen, just let the boy absorb the information. Sam, why don’t you head up to your room. This is a big deal that you just need to take in before we talk about legalities and whatnot.”
When they got to school, Sam insisted on walking him to his locker, and then to Ms. Bradbury's class. The redheaded woman stood up as Dean entered the room and waved him over.
Sam couldn't keep the choking lump out of his voice when he said, "Are you going to hurt me tomorrow?"
"Sit down." Bobby had a deep frown on his face. Both boys obeyed, sitting next to each other on the couch. Ellen sat down as well, followed by Bobby, who sat back in the recliner. "I'm going to tell you a story. There was a father whose little girl was the joy of his life."
Dean took a deep breath. “Meet my boyfriend, Dad.”
"I think I'm going to head up to my room," Dean said quickly, and ran up the stairs. He heard footsteps behind him and said, "I'm not going to do anything, I swear. I need sleep."
Castiel took a deep breath and nodded. "Dean's been in rough emotional shape lately, and I need to support him." He frowned. "And right now, I really need to get over there. He didn't pick up when I returned his call," he informed his brother.
Jess nodded, dialing the phone. “I have her number programmed. Assuming she’s still in her room, which is not really a valid assumption.” After a few moments, Jess’s eyes widened. “Miss Bradbury? Jessica Moore…from your computer class? I need your help. Can we meet tomorrow during lunch? Awesome, thank you. Bye.” Jess hung up the phone with a pointed stare at Ellen, then turned her eyes on Bobby. “I’m about to lie through my teeth to my computer teacher, so this had better work.”
Jess nodded at Bobby before turning to Ellen. “Lucifer is torturing Sam and Dean. He isn’t even the one doing it. And none of this is Castiel’s fault.” She seemed to be startled by her own vehemence. “He came to me with this because he had no idea what to do. So don’t put the blame on him.”
He gazed at the two boys for a moment longer before leaving the room and locking the door behind him. He practically ran back upstairs and tried to get some sleep. He tossed and turned and cried a little. In other words, his few attempts at sleep were piiful, but eventually he managed to stay asleep. He had no dreams that night, just the echoes of screams in his mind.
Azazel's face grew deadly serious. "Tomorrow, you get to torture Sam."
"Well still, thank you." Dean winced as Ellen pressesd ice to his rib.
Dean nodded absently. Hopefully Sam wasn't too upset.

Let me know what you think!
Castiel smiled at him. "Lucifer." He patted the space on the bed next to him. Lucifer walked over and sat where Castiel indicated. "How was your talk with Michael?"
.......................................................................................................
He pulled a notebook from his school bag and took a pen from the nightstand. He flipped to a blank page and started writing. The words flowed easily.
WARNING: Suicidal thoughts. Suicide notes. Homophobic slur. Mentions of past death.
“Not yet,” Castiel said, “but he might when I get home. Alastair finally gave Dean the offer to torture Sam in exchange for a day’s rest. If Dean doesn’t do it, Alastair will.”
Meg proved to be correct. Crowley approached Dean and Meg again after class. "Glad to see you two getting all buddy-buddy then." He looked Meg directly in the eye as he said to Dean, "Too bad she's aiming to steal your precious boyfriend."
Castiel was probably bruising Dean's fingers with how tightly he was squeezing them. "Yes, Father," he said uncertainly.
...........................................................................
Dean thought back through the past years. He had never been especially close to Ms. Bradbury. She was actually kind of intimidating, even though she was slight and nerdy. She had an air of mystery to her, and the entire class suspected she was really some kind of super hacker that used teaching as a cover.
Castiel laughed bitterly. “Only too aware. I would have turned John in for what he was doing to Dean, but Dean practically begged me not to. The man’s getting close to eighteen; I figured he could make his own decisions.”
With that, Castiel turned and left, not wanting to talk to them anymore, just in case he was arrested for assault or murder. Wouldn't want Bobby or Sam to get in trouble for what Castiel was doing by himself.
Warning for mentions of torture and death, traumatic flashbacks, and threats.
Someone tapped him on the shoulder right after the minute bell rang, and he flinched slightly as he turned around. The exchange student from...from...wherever in the British Isles he was from was standing behind him, scowling. Dean suddenly remembered his name. "What do you want, Crowley?"
He sighed, eating his dinner quickly, not listening to anything happening around him, then shoved his chair back and went up to his room. No one stopped him. Why would they? Training was over. Castiel waited until everyone was in bed before sneaking downstairs. He picked the lock on the basement door and went in, as he usually did at night anymore. He looked at Sam and Dean, who were sleeping, tied to the tables. They looked innocent when they slept, and generally didn't talk or move. Tonight, Sam was muttering in his sleep, saying the name 'Jess' over and over again.
Lucifer shrugged. "Has a significant other that he might like to bring." He cast a look toward Castiel.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ellen looked around quickly to make sure no one’s attention had been drawn to the nearly hysterical teenager in front of them. “You’re telling us,” she said in a low voice, “that the Novaks are torturing our kids?”
Sam's last class of the day was his chemistry class. He hadn't had a chemistry partner assigned yet, so the chair beside him was empty. Today, though, a dark haired girl who hadn't been in the class before waltzed through the door and handed a paper to the instructor. He looked at it, then back at her. "All right, Ruby, pick a seat."
Love all of you,
Dean stood leaning against the driver's door to the Impala, keys resting in his hand as he waited for his brother to come out of the building. He did so, alone, to Dean's surprise. He made his way down into the parking lot. As he reached the car, Dean asked, "No Jess?"
Dean stared at her for a moment before turning his eyes more critically toward the boy standing in front of him. Crowley had a deep flush on his face that he seemed to be struggling to control. Dean did not say a word. He decided it was a better idea to let Meg and Crowley have their little feud without him being involved.
Castiel thought for a moment, attaching the name to her face. Jessica Moore. And then an idea struck him. He needed to save Dean and Sam. Who better to help him than their loved ones? He hated dragging people into this,but what else was he supposed to do?
“I’ll see if my brother will let me borrow the car.” Cas started toward the door.
for helping me out with some details in here!!
“For now.” There was a click. Cas had hung up, leaving Sam staring at the phone in his hand.
He accepted the call and put the phone to his ear. "Yeah?"
Castiel nodded, not trusting his voice. His eyes welled up with tears. Father wanted them again. He took a moment to get his emotions under control before saying, "Perhaps you should go inside and change your clothing. Mother might have a heart attack if she sees you in those clothes."
I am writing a sequel to this, don't worry! Everything will end up resolved (eventually). Please let me know what you guys think!
"I'm not positive," panted Lucifer, his eyes sparkling. "You will never guess what happened."
Cas saw the honey-colored hair before anything else and made a beeline for Dean at his locker, dodging easily through the crowded hallway. He leaned against the locker next to his boyfriend and said, “Hello, Dean.”
Of course, it didn't work. "Gabriel has already traced the call. Why?"
Cas found himself wondering toward the end of the day whether Dean would decide to come over. He really wanted to see his boyfriend and make sure he was doing well. After lunch, he had simply gone back up to his room and plugged his earbuds in, doing the assignments his teachers had emailed him that morning. Lucifer had talked to Gabriel for a while, but he and Michael were back in Michael's room now.
"Yes, Dean," said Mr. Colt.
Cas kissed Dean awake on Thanksgiving morning. It wasn't like this was a strange thing for him to do, but Dean seemed startled today. "Cas?" Dean pushed away, eyes wide like a deer in headlights, and Cas understood.
Cas bent his neck to capture Dean's lips in a kiss. "I'm glad I woke you, then."
First Mom and Jo died, then Bobby and Ellen almost died, then Dad. And Dean thought it was an option? How dare he?
"She is upstairs." Michael nodded. Castiel continued, "With Lucifer."
Jess threw her arms around him with a soft cry. "Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry!" She pulled away and looked into his now wet eyes. "Sit with me today."
Castiel smiled. This was familiar ground. He looked up at the buzzing beehive hanging from the limb of the oak tree in the front yard. His brother was home, and they had been invited to Easter dinner by their father, and Mother was throwing a fit. All was as it should be. He relaxed for a few more moments before standing up and going in the house. The yelling seemed to have died down.
“Cas.” Dean’s voice shook slightly. Was he going to bring up the bruising himself?
Jody hung up the phone and turned to look at Ellen and Bobby. “I’m sorry,” she said, pulling her handgun out of her holster. Her eyes were rimmed in red, and there were tear tracks on her cheeks. “I’m so sorry.”
“A necessary skill, I assure you. Also, you never fail to jump.” Cas forced a smile as he examined Dean’s face. Sam was right. He looked a mess. If John was going to keep hurting
And with that, Castiel's heart snapped in half. "Dean, please."
Mother shook her head. "No. Absolutely not. If you think I will condone Castiel's boyfriend coming to Easter dinner, you are sorely mistaken."
Dean smiled. He might grow to like this girl. Maybe. If she would keep her roving eyes off his boyfriend.
“This isn’t your business, Sam.” The chill in John’s voice struck Sam. Usually when John was this drunk, he couldn’t be that cold. He must be really pissed. John raised a clenched and bloody fist. That was Sam’s cue. John always hesitated a moment. Sam used this time to grip his brother’s arm and drag him stumbling up the stairs.
“Your little group got pretty far. I hope you’re proud of them, since that’s as far as they’re going to get.”
Now her grieving was directed at the pain Sam was in. Though he hadn’t been hurt, physically, Jess knew how very attached to Dean he was, and seeing Dean get tortured every day was bound to take a toll on Sam’s mental health. Not to mention what would happen if Dean tortured him. Even if it was to save him from this Alastair guy, she knew Sam would not be able to handle it. He would handle Alastair better.
He checked the caller ID and picked up instantly. "Dean. What is it? Are you okay?" Gabriel paused with the key in the ignition and motioned for Castiel to put the call on speaker. Without thinking about it, Castiel obeyed. "Also, you're on speaker with Gabriel."
"I don't want your help. I don't need your help. I don't...need you."
Ms. Bradbury was unfazed. "I don't know you?" She laughed a little. "Dean, you have been in my class for four years. I know you."
I don't want to do this if no one wants it, and I know a lot of y'all cleaned out your subs a long time ago. But let me know.
That is, until another gunshot was fired and Ellen watched blood spray from her husband’s forehead as she held him. Another gunshot, and Jody screamed, a sound that was cut off by one more shot. Ellen looked behind her, where Lucifer was standing, gun in hand.
*****
by none other than Amahami. It's a wonderful story! I'd also like to thank Amahami for giving me that push to get this chapter done, and helping me with a couple details :-)
"Put your shoes on, Cassie. Let's go see Luci."
His dad cracked up, and as Dean practically fled out the door, he heard his mother call after him, "Have fun, dear!"
"What isn't working?"
Castiel glanced up at Dean, who stepped forward. “He has every place in this, sir.” Castiel was impressed by the respectful tone Dean could keep in his voice, even after his father had tried to hurt both of them and had been stopped. “If he’ll have me back.”
As they rounded the corner and came in view of the office, Dean saw Cas standing there. He was standing a little straighter than he usually did and Dean could have sworn he had a proud look on his face. But as Cas's eyes locked onto Dean's, the pride drained from them, instantly replaced with concern. Neither of them said a word. Dean marched right past him, followed closely by Sam, into the office.

I'm putting triggers in the end notes to avoid spoilers. If you need warnings, please check. Love you guys!

She crossed her arms and stared him down for a few moments before bursting out with , You cannot lock that door. Please leave it unlocked. I need to be able to get in, in case.." She trailed off, but Dean knew where that statement was leading. In case he attempted again. Not as though he even attempted the first time. Actually, he hadn't done a damn thing to hurt himself, so why was he here? Why was everybody stressed out about this?
In the back of Cas's car, practically forgotten, Sam worried. Technically Bobby and Ellen could be accused of kidnapping for taking Sam in. With Dean it was different, as John had straight-up kicked him out, but Sam was younger and had not been kicked out for falling in love with a boy. God, what was John's problem that he thought what he had done to his son was okay? That he thought that anything he had done was okay?
. He opened the message immediately.
Speaking of, Dean came down the stairs, a frown on his face. “I called him.”
The first thing he did after he shut his bedroom door was check his phone. Dean had sent a response about five minutes previously.
*****
. Sam probably wouldn't see it until it was too late. Dean pulled off his AC/DC tee and sweatpants, replacing them with jeans and a green flannel. He took the Impala's keys off his nightstand and left the room.
But Dean had this gut feeling it hadn't been suicide, and if he had learned one thing in the past several years, it was to trust his gut, even if all the evidence was against it. If his gut said John didn't kill himself, he was going to figure out who killed him.
Trigger warning for mentions of a suicide attempt, mentions of torture, and grieving.
The pair pulled on shorts and went out to what passed for a kitchen. Dean was used to making food in an only-partially-functioning kitchen, but Cas was still adapting. They were only going to make two pies, one pumpkin, as per tradition, and one apple, as per Dean's love of apple pie. They had to bake them separately, which was fine. Maybe Cas would be able to get Dean into two showers.
"Cas, please." When Dean opened his mouth, blood from his nose ran into it and he coughed a little, sending shooting agony through his already torturous ribs. "Just leave it alone. Sammy and I are getting out. Dad can just stay there without his sons."
Dean shrugged. “He’s not coming back tonight, but he told me he forgave me for what a jerk I was.”
“I don’t know. He got a phone call and said I needed to find you and that he needed to find Ellen and we all need to just sit down.” Sam’s voice rose with every word. He was in a full-blown panic, because this couldn’t be good. What could possibly be good about this situation?
When Dean and Cas approached Sam, he said, "No worries, guys. Dad's not around."
It seemed to be ages after Dean had told Castiel he was in class that Michael's door finally opened and Lucifer came out, followed by his brother. Michael went downstairs, but Lucifer simply crossed the hall and entered Castiel's room, knocking as he came in. "Hello, brother."
*****
Dean looked at him, and his eyes softened. “I’m sorry, Sammy. But I’m fine.”
Dean laughed internally at that, but some of it must have shown on his face, because Alastair studied him carefully. "You've never laughed at one of my jokes before." Alastair set down his knife on the table and left the room.
Michael raised an eyebrow. "Father has invited us for Easter dinner?" He looked across Castiel at Lucifer. "That is why you did this?"
So Sam didn’t think the name. Instead, he let Ellen minister to him, let himself be helped up, and hobbled his slow and painful way to the truck with her. He didn’t look at the bodies on the ground. He didn’t want to know. Hearing Dean wail in pain was enough for him. Whoever they were, they were people near and dear to their hearts. He wasn’t prepared to deal with that.
Dean turned to Cas in surprise. “What?”
Without a moment's hesitation, Dean hopped up and rummaged through his bag for his phone. It took him only a brief minute before he was on the bed, phone to his ear. It rang nine times and went to voicemail. Dean hung up, not bothering to leave a message.
Mother nodded. "Yes. You are dismissed," she said tonelessly.
He quickly showered and got dressed, pulling on his suit and tying his tie loosely around his neck. He grabbed his old beige trenchcoat from over the back of his desk chair and practically ran downstairs, where Michael was waiting with scrambled eggs and toast.
Lucifer proved her point by pulling a gun and pointing it at them. “Knife down.” Charlie’s eyes were steel. Jess’s legs were jelly. “Knife. Down.”
At least his brother was walking. They got loaded into the truck side by side. Sam instantly let himself fall on his brother, who tensed. Sam pulled himself up and leaned on the door instead, but then Dean leaned on him. He didn’t hit a sore spot, somehow, and they both fell asleep on the ride back to their house. They had survived. Cas had survived. Ellen was there to take care of them.
I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter. Unless I receive objections, I AM upping the rating to mature because my plan became a little darker.
The alarm woke Dean up, and he started to get out of bed before he realized it was Saturday. When that realization hit him, he turned off the alarm so it wouldn't go off again and flopped back into bed. He shut his eyes and saw flames. Looked like he wasn't going back to sleep. He crawled out of bed and pulled on his jeans. As he relaxed back in the bed and took
....................................................................................................................................................................................
Castiel and Michael did not exchange words as they shoveled breakfast into their mouths. (Well, Castiel shoveled. Michael ate with grace, though just as quickly as Castiel.) They were just rinsing the plates when their father came downstairs, fully dressed for church, followed by Gabriel, who was not dressed sloppily, but whose outfit was hardly formal.
He crossed the room swiftly after that thought and went downstairs. His father was nowhere in sight, and for a moment Dean thought he might be in the clear. But of course, Dean Winchester had no such luck. As he stepped into the living room, he noticed that unmistakable top of his father's head rising and turning to glare at him.
Cas could not mask the ice cold anger that coursed through his veins at that when he said, “This isn’t going to happen again. I
“I didn’t raise my son this way. I didn’t raise my son to be a faggot.” John’s voice was surprisingly steady. Castiel had been expecting yelling and probably an attack. But John hadn’t moved. He stood in front of the three of them, hands clenched at his sides. “Get out of my house. You have one hour to pack up and get out. You are not my son.”
“John never did more than yell at Sam. Sam was his favorite.” It was not entirely true, since the previous night, John had indeed thrown a glass at Sam, but it had not hit him.
The pair got up. Jess walked with Sam to dump his tray, and they exited the cafeteria together hand-in-hand. Sam walked Jess to her classroom and hugged her outside. "Have a good class," he said.
Obviously, something had happened between them today. Probably something to do with John, if Sam had to guess. But he wholeheartedly agreed with Cas. If John were to try to do anything about Cas and Dean being together, Sam would stand with Cas, whatever Dean did. John didn't get to hurt Dean anymore. Ever again.
It's been a while.
Gabriel nodded and sat next to Cas. The couch was becoming rather crowded. "Well, I'd recommend a course of grief counseling, myself. Professional counseling is important, especially through a time like this. If I felt it would help, I'd also say you need to go into therapy, Dean. We were lucky this time, and we can't let this slide."
“All right,” Azazel said with a sadistic grin adorning his face. “I look forward to your answer.” And with that response, he went back over to Sam.
Sam could tell he was about to place the blame on himself again. He had known for years that there had been a fire, and that Dean blamed himself for her death, but he had never known why. And Dean was obviously hiding something from him. "Why did you go back in?"
She could hear the hardening in the girl’s voice when she answered. “They are being tortured, and I know the Novaks are coming after you, too, so you might want to take this seriously, Miss Middleton.”
“When?” Charlie asked with a sigh. Jessica wasn’t going to take no for an answer, she realized, so she gave in.
John’s clumping footsteps followed them, but Sam managed to pull Dean into his room and put the desk chair under the doorknob. When he turned around. Dean was unconscious on the floor. Immediately, Sam knelt beside him and checked his pockets for a phone. Not finding it there, he waited until he could hear John snoring. By the alarm clock on the nightstand it was two in the morning. Dean was still unconscious.
Sam wasn’t going to go to sleep until he heard Dean come in. But that hadn’t happened yet, and it was the night before the first day of school. John was waiting for him downstairs in the living room. If Sam’s phone hadn’t been destroyed in the last rage, he would have texted Dean. Told him to climb in through the window and avoid their father. But his phone was gone and Sam knew there was no way in hell he would go to sleep.
Cas took Dean’s side, of course. “It is, actually. And he’ll go with you.”
Dean looked at Cas, eyes hardening. "Alastair."
Castiel was shaking as he hung up the phone. Dean seemed upset. And he didn't believe John had killed himself. Would Dean suspect something of him? Castiel did not think it was likely that Dean would actually think Castiel himself had done this, but the thought remained, like the seeds of panic in his head. But even if Dean suspected something, no police investigation would be able to pin this on Castiel. He had been too careful. Too conscientious about leaving no fingerprints and not being seen entering the house.
In this chapter you learn what happened to Mary. And there's some nightmares. Fair warning.
"And you made it look that professional?" Lucifer sounded genuinely impressed. "The police dropped the case as a suicide almost immediately. You've never done this before?"
>>Sam called me. Are you well?
She pulled the blindfold and earplugs off a shelf and put them onto the son. He didn’t need to know what was coming. Lilith had limits, after all. She went to the closet again and grabbed her ball gag…damn, she was going to have to disinfect all of this before Ruby came over again.
“Hell yes I did. Because it’s true.” Sam laughed, but he wasn’t sure why he did. “Mom wouldn’t have let him kick you out. She would have stood up for you and you know it.”
Dean…John wouldn’t last much longer.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Slow down, Castiel. One step at a time. First, we tell Mother this is happening." Lucifer smiled. "Then we figure out the rest." His smile widened into a grin. "We are going to Father's house for Easter dinner."
-----
Charlie shook her head. Lucifer shrugged and shifted his aim. Jess didn’t realize he had shot (silencer, the rational part of her brain informed her) until she felt a burning in her stomach. She screamed and crumpled. Through the haze of pain she watched as Charlie dropped the knife.
Jess hung up the phone after her mother said that and looked into the front seat, where Bobby and Ellen sat in silence, not questioning her for information she wasn’t yet able to share.
...........................................................................................................................................................
“Dad.” Sam grimaced and ran a hand through his hair. “Sorry to wake you, Cas.”
Dean nodded. "All right."
Only one way to find out. “Yes, Dean?”
Baby had been John's car. Sure, Dean had loved it, but as long as it sat there, John sat there, watching Dean just as much as he ever had.
For that reason, and that reason alone, Dean was glad he had been the one Alastair was assigned to. That way, Sam didn't have to go through Alastair's screwed up form of fun. Sure, Sammy had to hear Azazel's whispered words, and Dean could hear him crying himself to sleep at night, but at least Sam wasn't in danger of losing fingers. If that had to happen to anyone...it was going to happen to Dean, because if anything happened to Sam, everyone in the building would feel Dean's rage.
Bobby had a horrified look on his face. “What if they have Sean and Owen? Jody wouldn’t do anything to get those two hurt.”
After school, Castiel went home and dropped off his books, then went to the Winchester house. There was no crime tape anywhere, so he assumed Sheriff Mills had not actually come out to the house yet. This left him little to no time, so he put on his cotton gloves and climbed in through the window he had left unlocked in the back. No one was watching him.
"True that. Okay, I can pick you up for it. Where is it?"
Dean turned. Cas hadn't moved, hadn't even turned to face him. "What?"
His mom came out of the kitchen. "John, really? You leave Dean alone." She wrapped Dean in a hug and whispered in his ear, "Use protection."
Michael led the way through the house, the woman behind him following cautiously, but placing far more trust in him than Michael would have imagined being given to him in this circumstance. He knew what was to be found downstairs. Nothing but blood and agony and torture. He needed to get those two out.
Dean fiddled with his bow tie. "Are you sure this is good for dinner with Cas's dad? I don't want to seem like I think I'm better than them."
Castiel sighed in relief. "Thank you, Mother. Crowley."
“How?” was Dean’s response, voice unwavering.
.....................................................................................................
Michael soon followed, shooting a smile at Gabriel and Castiel as he tied his shoes. “I get my brother back today,” he said, and Castiel could not help but smile back at the absolute elation in Michael's voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Crowley clapped both boys on the shoulder. "We're going to head out. You take as long as you need."
Castiel could not help but feel relieved that Michael was home and still willing to protect the rest of the brothers. He had been distant since the disappearance of Gabriel. Mother had allowed him to do whatever he had to do to deal with the loss of his brother, but this meant she had cracked down on the rest of them, particularly Castiel.
"Becky, this is Castiel and Dean," Castiel's father said. "My son and his boyfriend."
John didn’t see him as he got out of the car, or if he did he ignored him. He looked sober, and he had been driving (but that meant absolutely nothing, Castiel reminded himself). Once he made his way inside, Castiel snuck over to the window, watching as best he could through the curtains and hoping no one saw him doing so.
Ellen nodded. “We really do. I’m sorry, but we really need her.”
“I do appreciate it. I won’t bring it up to Dean. For now.” There was a click at the other end of the line. Cas had hung up, leaving Sam to stare at the phone in his hand for a moment before bringing Dean back to consciousness, checking for a concussion, and going to sleep. Tomorrow would be a blast.
Soon, Castiel heard the door open downstairs, and Michael calling, "Castiel! Where are you?" Castiel ran down the stairs, at once terrified and excited to see his brother in this setting again. Last time...no, don't think about last time. His brother was back. His brother was home.
Sam rolled his eyes. "No, Dean, she had choir practice." The excuse seemed flimsy to Dean, but he ignored it, especially given the tired look in his brother's eyes and the way he held his hands in fists at his side. Dean didn't ask. If Sam needed help, he would ask for it.
Lucifer nudged Castiel and looked directly into his eyes. Castiel knew if he lied, Lucifer would know. He had always been excellent at detecting lies. "Yes," he said quietly. "I did."
Sam was sad, and Dean could dwell on that for years. He had caused Sam to be sad, and he knew how wrong that was. And Bobby and Ellen with that story. He had hurt so many people without doing a thing, so what would happen if he did something?
Dean could barely pay attention to any of his classes that day. He kept thinking back to what Ms. Milton said about being unfeeling. He wasn't unfeeling. He was being the strong older brother. Sam didn't need Dean's worries on top of his own. He was having a hard enough time with losing their father. So after making it through that exceptionally long day, Cas at his side, he was exhausted. He drove the three of them back to Bobby's house, and Bobby invited Cas to stay for dinner. Cas, of course, accepted, but asked Dean to drive him home soon after that, claiming Gabriel needed something. The night went fairly calmly after that, and Dean ignored his homework and went to bed early.
"The one and only." Lucifer nodded with a smug smile on his face. "I found Father. After his panel, I went up to him, said hi...he fainted. Not kidding, he fell into a dead faint." Lucifer stretched his arms above his head. "Naturally, when he came to, he had all sorts of questions. The usual, you know. How are you, what about your brothers, how did you find me. I said we were doing fine, and I had just happened to be in town." Again, Lucifer paused, and Castiel stared at him. "He invited us over for Easter dinner. And the best part? He lives in Kansas City."
Castiel felt a tear on his cheek, which he wiped away. "Turn off the car, we are not going."
Castiel was shaking hard by the time he got out the door. Dean blamed himself for his father being dead. He blamed himself and had tried to kill himself because of it. This was Castiel's fault and he knew it. If Sam hadn't found the note and called Gabriel, Dean would have died and Castiel would have been to blame.
"All right, son. Ellen wanted me to tell ya to lay down and stay down. She doesn't want you moving around for a while. You've got a couple bruised ribs and she just wants you to take it easy." Dean nodded and Bobby left the room.
.................................................................................................................................................................................
Her face went through several expressions before settling on resignation. "Fine." She crossed her arms. "Invite Dean."
Dean tried to step past him, and John moved aside, not saying another word. That was what Dean would remember the most. The quiet. Drunk, John was loud and full of rage. Sober, John wasn't violent. He was quiet and apathetic. Needless to say, he was typically drunk. As Dean moved past him, John shoved him in the small of his back. Dean fell, already burdened by the luggage he was carrying.
This isn't beta'd, so any mistakes are mine alone!
, it seemed he would have to. He wasn't insane, though, and he opened his mouth to say as much.
Cas looked at Dean. "Do you want me gone?"
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
Dean sighed. "Always."
The look on Dean's face almost made Sam regret asking the question. Almost. "I don't know, Sam, I was four!"
“He said it’s my fault he’s still alive. In our mess of a family. I did the right thing, though, didn’t I?” Yes, of course he did. He couldn’t just let his brother die. That wouldn’t make him much of a brother, now, would it?
“Not a chance in hell. Dean is showing bruises from yesterday. Now, I could report this.” Castiel spoke just as low as John did.
Triggers: Suicidal ideation. Self hatred. Repeating suicidal ideation because it's the whole focus of the chapter.
Gabriel, however, was the one who stepped up to fix Castiel's tie and whisper in his ear, "Luci gets out tomorrow."
"His name is Castiel, Gabriel, and why exactly is it so important for you to go? Castiel did not tell me last night what sort of problem Dean was having." Their father stood up and made his way across the room, coming to a halt when he reached the brothers. When neither of them responded right away, he asked, "Well?"
Dean wakes up with tears streaming down his face. He quashes the sadness the nightmare stirred in him. He shoves the thought that it was his fault deep down. Cas doesn't think it's his fault. But the feeling persists. If it weren't one in the morning Dean would call Cas, but he didn't want to wake his boyfriend up. He didn't want to bother him. So he got up and got a drink of water, hoping the dream wouldn't come back when he went back to sleep.
"No. This has gone on long enough. But I am going to drive you to Bobby's house now. Get in the car. I will put your things in the trunk."
Jess and Charlie shared a glance. “I’m not leaving her with you,” Jess said, voice slightly trembling.
Sam nodded and fled up to Dean’s room, where he found Dean on the phone. “Cas, he’s dead, didn’t you hear me? No it isn’t good. Cas, he killed himself, or so they think. No, of course I don’t. That isn’t him. All right. Yes, I love you too. Okay. Bye.”
"Come on, you let Deano call you Cas,
Sam and John were there too, unsurprisingly. Cas had been expecting it, though from the bright look in Dean's eye, he was startled and happy to see his brother there. He set the pie down carefully and ruffled Sam's long hair. "Hey, Sammy!" He looked at his father. "Hi, Dad." The time was far flatter, but Cas knew he was glad to see his father again, a fact which was proven by just how smoothly dinner went. Truth be told, Cas had been fearing a slight conflict. Dessert was looming close as Dean finally stopped staring longingly at the turkey scraps that were left.
Finally, she decided to put him out of his misery and slashed deep across his neck, hitting his windpipe. She spun around in the spraying blood, trying to get an even splatter, before the blood stopped spurting with his screams and he went limp.
"Why have you decided killing yourself is the better option?" Dean could hear a tremble in his stoic boyfriend's voice. "Why do you feel the need to do this? Please explain it to me because I do not understand. Please, Dean."

A nice family conversation.
(See the end of the chapter for
She looked around. Everyone had already been assigned their partner but Sam, so she made her way through the mess of tables to sit right next to him. "Name's Ruby," she said with a wolfish smile.
"Well, you did something." Castiel felt tears forming in his eyes, and his older brother put an arm around his shoulder and drew his head close. "Don't be sad, Castiel. Everything is going to be all right. No one is going to find out. Trust me, I saw the autopsy report. You did well."
"Every morning, he stared at that loaded gun, wondering if today would be the day. His wife talked him down. Sometimes he talked his wife down. But losing that girl had hurt both of them deeply. Neither could see much of a point in continuing to live without her. And then they realized that two boys needed them more than they thought they had. The father put away that gun. And he lived." Bobby took a deep breath as he finished his narrative.
Dean looked back and forth between Bobby and Ellen and nodded slowly. “All right.” Then he was up like a shot and ran upstairs.
Michael came back downstairs and handed the phone and the slip of paper to Lucifer, who dialed the number and waited. "Father. Yes, we can come. Hmmm? Yes, I believe one of us does. All right, I'll tell him. Yes, I'm excited to see you too. All right. Bye."
Dean's breath slowed to a normal pace and he sat up as well, wrapping his long arms around his knees. He was shirtless, and Cas could see his scars peeking out, white against his tan skin. "Sorry, Cas. Didn't mean to shove you away."
"Gabriel, you really should eat something substantial. It is breakfast, after all." Castiel smiled as Gabriel shook his head. "To each their own, then," he said before going upstairs and checking his phone. Dean still hadn't texted him, and it was close to eight. He pressed call, but hung up immediately. Dean had promised he would tell Castiel if he needed anything. If Castiel called now, it would be nagging, and Castiel really did not want to be that boyfriend, the one who would not stop calling and texting and being generally clingy.
“And?” Sam looked up at his brother, a hopeful smile on his face.
Sam placed his giant hand on Dean's shoulder. "If you need anything at all, you call me, understand?"
Sam couldn’t help but notice the suitcase Dean was giving him was larger than the one he himself was using, but by now he knew better than to comment on that. “Dean, I’m serious. This isn’t necessary.”
Ellen smiled apologetically. “I’m sorry, Jess. This is necessary. I’m going to meet with Jody for lunch tomorrow and confirm our suspicions. I hope she can join us…we could really use the extra person to help out.”

Triggers: mentions of suicidal ideation.
"St. Louis." Lucifer grinned as Castiel shot him a disapproving look. "I needed to clear my head, Castiel. Don't tell me you've never thought about running away."
This time it was Bradbury’s voice coming through.
I went back to Dean's perspective for this one! I hope you like it!
The next day was Friday, and Castiel got up, got dressed, and went to school, no trace of worry in his mind.
"Yes." Castiel crossed his arms.
"Ms. Milton is probably still talking to him. We have computer class now, though, and you know how Bradbury gets when students come in late."
When Ellen opened the door, she took in the sight of Jess’s teary face and pulled her into a crushing hug, during which Jess whispered, “I’m fine, but your house might be bugged and I need to talk to you.”
"Hey, little bro," Gabriel said, wrapping Castiel in a tight hug. "Sorry we haven't spoken lately."
Bobby and Ellen could be that for Sam. At least, Dean hoped they would be. They needed someone to take care of...ever since Jo, they had been depressed and unsure. They always did their best to hide it from the boys. Since the Singer-Harvelle household had always been a safe haven from their family problems, their two surrogate parents didn't want them exposed to problems there, too. But Dean had picked up on the constant tension and realized how sad they were all the time. Maybe with Sam there full-time, they would feel a little better. Sam was only a couple years older than Jo had been, after all.
“Bitch. How was school?”
Crowley had protected him. Would Father? Castiel suddenly decided he was going to test and see at Easter dinner. If Mother allowed them to go (and possibly if she did not, Castiel realized, thinking of Lucifer's determination), he was inviting Dean to meet his father.
The call shook him up pretty badly. He thought it would be better if he could talk to Dean, but instead, it just tore at his heart. After he hung up, he saw John’s car pull into their driveway. He weighed the possibilities for a moment before he sprang up and left his house, walking back to Dean’s. He wanted to make sure they both were safe.
It rang four times before a tired, low voice answered, “Why, in the name of all that is holy, are you awake?”
"Just go. I don't want you here. Leave me alone." Dean's voice, though hard, broke on the last word.
He lifted the luggage again and began to stumble down the street. As he went around the corner, he saw Sam and Cas standing next to Cas's brother's car. Both of them started running to him immediately, and he suddenly became conscious of the aching behind his eyes where he wasn't letting tears start to slip down his face. When Sam and Cas reached him, they took all the bags off him and studied him. Cas walked all the way around him before proclaiming, "He is dead. There is no longer any question whether you can prevent me from killing that man."
“A necessary skill, I assure you.” Cas forced a smile as he examined Dean’s face. “You never fail to jump.” Sam had understated the situation. Dean’s face was a swollen, multicolored mess. Cas meant what he had said last night. If John was going to keep attacking
Sam woke, shaking and sweating, but silent. Looking at the clock, he saw it was one in the morning. He decided he didn't need to wake Dean about this. Or Bobby or Ellen. He could handle it. He got up and walked around for a few minutes until he deemed himself calm enough to go back to sleep. But even when he got back in bed, he was sleepless. He tossed and turned, trying to find the best sleeping position, but it was no good. Dawn had broken by the time he fell back asleep.
He wished Lilith was around, but she was busy guarding their leverage over Sheriff Jody Mills, and the other girls were with her. He could bring them back here, but Sean was a capable guy, so he decided to leave the girls there. The four already there would do. His father, too, was gone. Business trip to Wyoming, of all places. Something to do with a security system.
Charlie didn’t even ask, though she thought Sam was already dead, considering how long ago he vanished. They had had grief counselors on campus and everything. “What kind of danger?” she asked, humoring the girl.
Castiel and Dean made it to the Shurley household about an hour later. The Novak car was already there. Dean got out and ran around the front of the car to open the door for his boyfriend. They strolled up the driveway, squeezing each other's hands for dear life.
Cas picked up immediately. "Hello, Dean," he said.
He and Sam, laden down with bags, made their way to the door, where Bobby waited for them. "He should probably go to the hospital, you know," said Bobby, by way of greeting.
Why did he have to say that? Why? Dean shook his head and sighed.
Or so Dean told himself.
“Dean came in late, and there isn’t a way to put it other than Dad beat the shit out of him.” Sam sighed, even his breath shaky. “He’s unconscious.”
"I'm sorry, Dean. Dad is in town and you know how he is about church. Speaking of, I can't come to school tomorrow. Lucifer is going to be back, and all of us have to be home for that." Castiel sent up a prayer that Dean would not be too upset.
Cas raised one eyebrow. "Do not lie to me, Dean. Please. Is there anything I can do to help?"
Well, well, well. Let me know what you think!!
If he hadn't killed John Winchester, none of this would have been set in motion, Dean would have turned 18, probably taken custody of Sam, and everything could have worked out. But no. Instead, Castiel had been rash and killed someone, and now everybody was suffering because of it. Castiel hated it.
"I think I'll be all right, Cas. Everything is going to be okay."
Dean nodded and let Cas lead him by the hand down the hall to the computer lab while Cas's mind raced. Why had he decided this was a good idea?
Castiel narrowed his eyes at his brother. "What is mine?"
Or, was sure of it until the basement door was kicked down. For the first time in a very long time, Dean and Sam broke eye contact and stared as Michael Novak, followed by Ellen and Cas, barged through the door.
Hey, y'all.
-----
After a rather long pause, Dean said, "All right, Cas. I'll be fine tomorrow. Don't worry."
Dean was sure John hadn't killed himself, but there was nothing he could do to actually convince everyone of this face. Cas thought he was just in denial,
"And apparently us as well," Naomi said with a snort. "As if we would ever-"
She was typing away, and, since class hadn't started, Dean looked curiously at her screen. He looked away quickly in embarrassment, but she didn't seem to have seen him looking, so he read the paragraph he was typing. He held back a chuckle as he said, "Though Captain Jack does have a thing for sleeping with anything that lets him, I doubt he would do so with Mussolini"
"All right, get out of here or you'll be late for Cas, jerk." Sam grinned and pushed his hair out of his face.
After a few minute ride into town, Bobby pulled into a local diner and they all got out of the truck. All three ordered hamburgers when the waitress came to serve them, and when she was gone, the older couple turned a questioning eye on Jess, who launched into her story, beginning with, “So apparently Sam is alive…and so is Dean.”
He climbed the stairs, digging his phone out of his jeans pocket as he went. He scrolled through his contacts until he found the one he was looking for, then pressed the call button.
do that." When Ms. Bradbury smiled back, he stood up, grabbing his backpack from the floor, and made his way to the seat next to Meg Masters.
The woman paused before speaking. He didn’t grudge her the hesitation. “Ellen,” she finally said. She didn’t acknowledge the presence of Castiel, who hadn’t said anything. They all three went down the stairs, and that was when all hell broke loose.
Thanks for reading, commenting, subscribing, bookmarking, and giving kudos!
Sam yawned and turned his attention to the teacher as he clenched his fists under the table, digging his nails into the flesh of his palm. He liked Jess, dammit. He liked Jess.
Jess laughed. "Oh, probably. That might actually be a good idea, Sam." The way she said his name made tingles run up Sam's spine. She reached out and took his hand, and for once since Dean had driven away, his head was silent.
The cameras followed their car ride and their walk. Jess and Charlie watched as the trio picked the lock on the Novak residence and went inside. They were walking down a hallway when a real voice sounded behind them.
There was a long pause on the other end of the line. “I never thought I would see the day. Huh. John Winchester abandoning his family. Go to hell.”
Azazel wasn't in the room. He never was, not during a training session. His job came later. Aftercare. He was the one who told Dean what would be done to him the next day. He was the one who whispered to Sam that one of these days he would take the instruments from Alastair and cut into his older brother.
Castiel wished Dean had not said that. He had started to feel a bit of guilt over what he had done, but he stowed that away without a second thought to it. Guilty Castiel is not who Dean needed right now. Dean needed someone stable who could be a constant through all of this. Not his father's murderer. Castiel was in trouble.
“When?” Lucifer demanded. Damn it, not tonight. This wasn’t the time for a rescue mission to happen.
"How did you know that?" Castiel began to panic. What if his father knew? His father was so against it. What if he knew?
My Always Keep Fighting shirt came in the mail a couple days ago, which inspired me to finish this chapter for you guys. Your comments and kudos are wonderfully motivating, too! Sorry I'm late with this installment!
Please let me know what you think of this, guys!
John needed a drink. Sam’s words still echoed in his mind.
“My name is Jody Mills.” Sheriff Mills walked around and sat behind the desk. “I got a call from Bobby Singer-Harvelle this morning about your friend Dean.”
Dean bit back his impulse to snap at the man. He was the one who Dean really never should snap at. Alastair was the crazyone, he had come to realize over the course of the past few weeks. Azazel...he was pretty scary, but everything he did had a carefully thought out purpose. Alastair just liked causing pain.
Castiel shook his head, trepidation rising. "I just got so angry. I knew I needed to do something."
“I will kill him.” The controlled anger in the voice sent shivers down Sam’s spine.
Dean let one tear fall before he composed himself again. "None of this was your fault, Cas. I'm glad I have you."
Dean collapsed to the ground and Ellen forced Sam to lie down once again. He wished he could speak. He wished he could call out to his brother who probably needed him to do just that. He tried, but only a hoarse whisper would come out of his mouth.
Upstairs, he heard a commotion. Dean paused in his work and flinched when Azazel snapped, “Keep going.”
She slipped her white and turquoise switchblade into the pocket Ruby had sown into her dress and went back downstairs. Sean Mills had indeed calmed down quite a bit. The son was crying still. Lilith made her way over to the closet and opened the door. The son could see every action she took.
Lucifer would brook no insubordination. He took long strides as he moved toward Castiel, and soon was able to grip his younger brother's shirt collar and shove him against the wall, pulling him away from Dean. "Listen closely to me, little brother. Next time you do that, Dean loses a finger. And you will be the one cutting it off and presenting it to me." Lucifer paused, pressing his lips firmly together and raising his eyebrows, waiting for an argument that didn't come. Instead, Castiel simply nodded. "Now, I think we're done for today. It is almost six, and we need to eat dinner."
“That’s a lie.” Jess looked at Ellen askance. “Do we really need her that badly?”
Ellen nodded thoughtfully. “We need help. Cas told you this so you could rally people, right?” When Jess nodded, Ellen continued, “I should call Jody.”
This chapter is potentially TRIGGERING.
Cas wrapped his strong arms around Dean and held him. "It's all right, baby. I'm here. I always will be." He kissed Dean on the cheek. "I love you."
Dean didn't allow her to get farther with her statement. "He didn't. That's not like him, not at all."
Usually there were no words that Lucifer could discern, but today he could hear one word. "Cas!" Over and over again, a broken record that stabbed Castiel right in the heart.
Thank you guys for your comments, your kudos, and your time.  <3
Jess bit her lip. “Honestly? Miss Bradbury. She’s smart and discreet.”
"Cas, honey, do you really think this is a good idea?" The concern in Dean's voice was palpable.
Castiel's house and some exploration of his background. Basically, Gabe wakes Cas up.
The shrug Bobby gave him was one of acknowledgement. "True. That idjit wouldn't do a damn thing about his injuries if we didn't help him out."
Dean shrugged. "Not really. It can get
Crowley tightened Castiel's tie and stepped back. "Because I fell in love with her before I found out how she treated her "little angels." And when I did, I decided I wasn't going to just let her get away with it."
Alastair wiped his knife on Dean's jeans and grinned. "I may be a psychology student, but taking someone apart is far more fun than putting him back together." He raised his eyebrows, and Dean shuddered. "Or her, I don't discriminate."
"I love you too," Dean whispered, melting into the hug. After a little while, Cas pulled him up.
He swallowed that back, however, and said, "I helped my friend get out of an abusive household."
