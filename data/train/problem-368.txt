Sherlock frowned, annoyed that Lestrade didn't sound any happier.
John had obviously taken advantage of one of the fairground’s water pumps to sluice cold water over his torso. Washing up, or overheated? Sherlock’s mind queried, before he abruptly dismissed that train of thought in sheer appreciation for the view presented.
Sherlock pulled himself up haughtily, forcing himself to concentrate.  "You’re all...glowy," he began, rolling his eyes at having to point out the obvious.  "No...perspire-ey.  Wet.  Sweating.  An automatic biological process regulated by the sympathetic nervous system designed to cool body temperature.  Your face and neck are flushed, positively gleaming.  Perspiration has soaked through at the armpits and waist of your shirt, causing said damp fabric to cling compellingly to the muscles of your shoulders and upper back.  A reaction to environmental stimulus?  Perhaps.  A more likely cause, however, is a flood of adrenaline and cortisol activating the apocrine and eccrine glands in your system.  Your mind—while keen—is considered average, leaving you susceptible to worries, feelings and other petty concerns, such as self-doubt.  You proudly wear a championship belt buckle as an obvious testament to your prowess in the saddle, yet your repeated ramblings about your riding strategy for tonight indicates extreme nervousness about the upcoming bronco-riding competition in a few hours.  My IQ, by comparison, is significantly higher than the quarter of the one percent of the population that is considered ‘genius’.  Because of this, I am perfectly capable of maintaining and regulating my transport in adverse conditions.  Walking around a Texas fairground is no hardship to me, considering that in the past I have traveled to Morocco to observe some of the equine races held in the Sahara desert with no adverse effects.  So, hypocrite," Sherlock concluded, trying not to stare at the tempting beads of sweat  that were rolling down John’s throat and vanishing into the unbuttoned vee of the shirt placket, leaving shiny trails that would no doubt taste like salt and dust and sun cream if he licked them…
"You really think those horses were drugged?"  Lestrade asked.
What has [John] got in its pocketses, precious?
The waitress returned with his beer and change and Sherlock remembered to thank her as he accepted his cup.  The information regarding Fizzy Simpson's reputation for gambling notwithstanding, the entire weekend thus far had proven to be a waste in terms of uncovering any new leads.  Sherlock sighed and took another half-hearted sip of his drink, his nose wrinkling in distaste.  He was missing something, something obvious, but what?  He longed for the quiet of his cabin and the company of his violin, elements that would let him focus and actually
"You sure?" John asked skeptically, his expression matching his tone.  "You don't have to if you don't want to…"
Donovan raised an eyebrow.  "Danegeld...as in Kipling's "Once you pay them the Danes' gold, you never get rid of the Dane"?"
"You sure?"
They spent long several minutes drinking in companionable silence.  John looked up from time to time, a happy little grin on his face.  Each time he did, Sherlock felt the pool of warmth in his belly grow.  It was nice to spend time with somebody who so visibly appreciated his company.  The lights began to dim, accompanied by the scuffling, dragging sound of something heavy being moved.  Sherlock turned to see several members of the waitstaff pulling tables and chairs back, clearing a large space in front of the bar's stage.  "John," Sherlock asked, his tone curious as he watched the majority of the bar's patrons move to the now-cleared space and spread out into lines.  "What's going on?"
"Yes?" Sherlock replied, feigning confusion.  "Do you know her?"
"Sorry, sorry," John said, holding up his hands apologetically.  "I know you take your Work very seriously...I'm just...you've seriously never gone dancing before?"
"Thank you."  Sherlock took a quick sip of his limeade to soothe his burning throat.  "That was...good."
“Please!”
Sherlock heard John blow out an exasperated huff of air.  "Jesus," John muttered, more to himself than to Sherlock.  "When I first suggested you get yourself a set of chaps, I didn't imagine I'd be dragged through twelve thousand different leatherworks before we finally found one that sold genuine chaps and not fetish wear and then have to cool my heels outside while you spent the next five hours trying stuff on—"
had been met with an equally indignant
"Frightened almost.  But I don't know why." Doctor Früh pursed her lips, before shaking her head and shrugging.  "He strikes me as very arrogant.  Perhaps he is the type of person that wants to take all the credit for a project.  I have encountered those types of men before."
"Why?"
Sherlock seized on the change of topic gratefully, deciding to ignore the obvious colloquialism.  He needed something, anything to divert his attention from John's distracting, (and possibly unintentional) pseudo-fellatio.  "It's actually where I got my start in studying the body language of feral horses.  I would spend hours just observing them in their natural environment, seeing how they interacted with each other and watching them to learn how herd leaders inspire trust and obedience.  It's proven invaluable in my work to rehabilitate abused animals, though I have yet to make any real progress with Devil's Blaze.  I'm beginning to wonder if there's something important that I've missed."
Sherlock held his breath, waiting until John’s breathing resumed its previous steady pattern before he looked at his phone, taking care to block the screen’s backlight with his body.
"Okay.  Call me when you get here.  I'm gonna go spell Greg for a bit so he can have a break."
"Herbal soothers," Sherlock replied, answering her question before he could think to censor himself.
I love incorporating other author's works into my headcanon.   Shoutout to
“ALLLLLLL RIGHTY, THEN!  DEPENDIN’ ON HOW WELL Y’ALL KNOW YOUR BRONC RIDES, YOU MAY NOTICE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE RULES!  THE PRCA—THAT’S THE PROFESSIONAL RODEO COWBOYS ASSOCIATION—REQUIRES BRONC RIDES TO LAST EIGHT SECONDS TO QUALIFY.  THE AGRA RULE FOR A QUALIFYING RIDE IS SIX SECONDS.  NOW, YOU MAY THINK THAT TWO SECONDS IS NOTHING, BUT LET ME TELL YOU, THOSE TWO SECONDS CAN BE THE LONGEST TWO SECONDS IN YOUR LIFE!  NOT LIKE BUSINESS TIME!”  The announcer hit some sort of a switch, and a male voice poured out from the loudspeakers crooning about making love; making love for two…making love for two minutes.
“Maybe, but I’m also damn good,” John returned with a wink.
"Nope," John demurred, slipping the phone back into its holster.  "Just Harry wanting me to do something for her.  Nothing major.  I'll call her later.  I've got more important things to focus on right now."
Hello there, and/or welcome back (whichever is appropriate).  To quote Ed Gruberman of 'Ti Kwan Leep fame, "finally, some action!"
"No.  Doctor Leon Sterndale—he's a performance animal vet—called me a couple of weeks ago, asking me to keep an eye out for any rodeo animals that were acting strangely."  Doctor Früh's mouth twisted in a moue of distaste.
Sherlock shook his head once to realign his focus and nodded.  "Yes.  Do you want to play to a hundred points, or a hundred and twenty-five?" Sherlock asked as he circled the table, calculating his initial shot.
"That," Sherlock repeated, jerking his chin in the direction Baz had gone.  "I haven't seen that much posturing since the last time I watched a colt attempt to challenge an experienced stallion for his harem and get his arse duly kicked."
“Jesus,” John whistled, reaching for a spare pair of exam gloves.
"Spoiled rotten, more like," a voice from behind Sherlock said.  "And laaaazy!" the voice's owner continued.  "Don't know why we haven't fired her yet, considering she doesn't do much more than bark an' eat."  The tone was affectionate, despite the less-than-flattering words.
"Ahhh...right," John said, blushing.  "Let's go to 'Sizzle N Spice'."
“ANNNNNNDDD LAST BUT NOT LEAST, STEERING HIS HORSE INTO THE BOX—WOAH NELLY!  SOMEBODY’S HORSE IS A LITTLE EXCITED!  IT’S A GOOD COWBOY WHO CAN KEEP HIS SEAT WHEN HIS HORSE TRIES TO REAR—OKAY, THEY’VE GOT HIM TURNED RIGHT WAY AROUND, NOW—WE’VE GOT JOHN JONES, FROM MIAMI, OKLAHOMA!  NOW, BEFORE ANYBODY FROM FLORIDA GETS TECHY WITH ME, IT IS PRONOUNCED ‘MY-AM-UH’ NOT ‘MY-AM-ME’.  JOHN JUST SIGNALLED…TAKEDOWN!  FIVE POINT TWO, FOLKS, FIVE POINT TWO ON THE FIELD—” a loud, obnoxious ‘boinging’ noise sounded, interrupting the applause and cheers.  “—UH OH, I GOT SOME BAD NEWS, FOLKS: THE BARRIER WAS BROKEN EARLY, SO THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO ADD TEN SECONDS.  THAT MOVES JOHN JONES DOWN TO SEVENTH PLACE WITH FIFTEEN POINT TWO SECONDS ON THE CLOCK.  SOMETIMES A GUY CAN’T HELP BUT START AND FINISH TOO EARLY.  AT LEAST JOHN JONES HAS ANOTHER CHANCE TOMORROW NIGHT!  MEANWHILE, LET’S GIVE HIM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE!!!!”
Sherlock glared at the screen, trying to ignore the unpleasant combination of anger, fear and frustration brewing in his throat.  He could almost see the half-teasing, half-defiant expression on John’s face.  John’s ‘Devil-May-Care cockyness wasn’t unfamiliar to him.  He’d encountered the same ballsy, fatalistic attitude in more than a few jockeys who believed that meeting and/or maintaining a specific weight by whatever means possible in order to race was worth the health risks that came with laxative abuse, bulimia, dehydration, and excessive exercise.
Sherlock shrugged.  "I've never seen a case of accidental pasture poisoning—the people that hire me are quite careful about their investments—but I have read enough to know of some of the more common plants to watch for.  Isn't red maple the one that causes red blood cells to break down, while yew contains taxine, an alkaloid that causes respiratory and cardiac collapse when consumed?"
"I make no promises…" Sherlock replied absently as he unzipped a small duffle bag.  Inside were two pairs of socks, (one which he immediately helped himself to), two pairs of spare jockey shorts, the jeans and shirt that John had been wearing earlier and...yes, a Ziplock bag holding several condoms and travel-sized packets of slick.
"Nah," John answered with a head-shake.  "Not on saddle broncs, at least.  It tends to happen mostly with rookies who haven’t developed the muscle memory to turn face-down if they get thrown, or if they don’t bother to wait for a pickup man.  Occasionally it’s because the horse falls and the rider gets trapped.  Hangups are more common with bareback riders because they have to wedge their hand into their rigging handle.  Still, it’s an easy safety precaution to take."
was an idiotic question, but unable to stop himself.
Simpson snorted his disgust.  "Come on.  Don't be stupid.  I'm talkin' about money.  Placing a bet or two's an easy way to make a hundred bucks.  You give me a tip.  I'll place the bet, we can split any prize.  Hell, I'll even give you fifty cash up front so you can see I'm an honest man."
Sherlock wrinkled his nose at the unhygienic mess she'd made of her desk, but resumed his lecture.  "The second is because of animal abuse.  Even though the majority of contractors and competitors take excellent care of their animals, a single clip of an animal being beaten is enough to shape public perception against rodeos, in some cases resulting in a total ban of rodeos altogether, the way they are in the UK."
Watson.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a daughter to feed."  Sterndale jerked his chin towards the door, making it clear that the statement was an order, not a request.
He’d anticipated that watching John ride in person would be no different…and he had not been disappointed.  It had been simultaneously the most exciting and stomach-clenching six seconds that Sherlock could ever remember experiencing.  Even the thrill of sneaking a ride on his mother's prize stallion didn't compare to seeing John compete.  John had been…magnificent.  There was no other word for it.  In a distant part of Sherlock's mind, he was aware that his observations sounded suspiciously like hyperbole, but it was unimportant.
"Yes, thank you," Sherlock repeated, filling a small bit of warmth return at John's casual use of the word 'friend' and his attention.
John unearthed himself from the blankets long enough to aim a bleary glare at Sherlock.  “If you plan on smoking, you’d better pick yourself up a bottle of mouthwash.  I don’t fancy my mouth tasting like I licked the bottom of an ashtray.  You might get some more lube, too.”
—Sherlock reminded himself, said after a few moments of listening to Molly.  She tilted her head to indicate the coffee maker and loaf of bread sitting out on the counter beside the stove.  "Por ahí. Ayúdate."  Over there, help yourself, Sherlock mentally translated.  He was careful to look at Molly for confirmation before walking over and fixing himself a plate.
, and asked me if I'd found an appropriate bedspread in my rodeo!lock research.  I can now say I have!
"Let's play to one-twenty-five.  Assuming you can last that long."
"Gloves," John explained, pulling a pair out and waving the items in question for emphasis.  "I don't mind if you do."
"Please," Sherlock gasped, trying unsuccessfully to thrust up against the palm that John was now ghosting across his fly.  "I would…oh God…hate to miss out on something so significant."
Sherlock found himself privately impressed.
"Okay," Molly said faintly, before looking away, her cheeks an even darker pink.
Bending forward, Mycroft retrieved several additional manila folders from the attaché case still by his feet and tossed the first two onto the coffee table, neatly missing the half-full cup of tea.  Several pages of a neatly typed police report slid out of the bottom folder.  The edges of several colour photographs slid out of the other, their glossy surfaces hinting at the folder's contents.
"Molly mentioned yesterday that you help run the 'Western Nights' events?" Sherlock commented  as they made their way to the house.   The collie alternated between walking beside them and dashing off ahead of them to sniff at things that caught her interest, her tail wagging like an oversized, furry, plume.
"Of course," Sherlock replied.  "He's quiet for the moment.  If you hand me some antiseptic wipes and fresh gloves, I can keep cleaning the worst of the blood off while I wait."
Giving it up as a mystery that idle speculation alone would not solve, Sherlock continued forward.  "John?  Are you alright?"
"It could be coincidence," Donovan pointed out in the tone of one long accustomed to playing the Devil's advocate.
"I said my feet are extremely sensitive to a light touch," Sherlock muttered, looking away in embarrassment.
The moment Speckled Band’s forefeet touched the ground, muscled hindquarters propelled both rear legs into a fully extended backward kick.  It put the gelding’s belly at an impressive forty degrees in relation to the parallel ground.  An eyeblink later, the incline had switched in the opposite direction, with the gelding practically rearing as he gathered his feet back underneath his body for another attempt.  With each bound, Speckled Band achieved a height that would make the owner of an equestrian show jumper envious.
Sherlock bent down to pick up another section of fescue, but as he did so, he became aware of a prickling feeling between his shoulderblades.  The average individual would describe it as the ESP-like sensation of being watched.  He didn't believe in ESP, but studies had shown the human eye was finely tuned to register potential threats and alert the subconscious mind accordingly.  It was likely some sort of evolutionary holdover from the wilds where a direct stare heralded an attack or threat.  Regardless, he was logical enough to recognize the fact that his subconscious had signaled something being out of place and investigate it accordingly.
"He's on the spectrum," Donovan explained euphemistically, leading them around another corner and down a short hallway, "so his social cues can be a little different.  Like I said, though, he is
"No sir," Brenda replied, shaking her head emphatically.  "I mean, any horse can get cranky, but she seemed almost afraid of going to the barn."
So the lovely
As they walked, Sherlock kept shooting Molly sideline glances, mentally deducing the circumstances responsible for her change in demeanor.  At the airport and during the drive, she'd reminded him of nothing so much as a mouse—timid, quiet, with the occasional dash of spunk.  Now, back at the ranch, she extruded quiet confidence, backed with competence as she led Sherlock down asphalt paths designed to making moving wheelbarrows and wagons easier to haul, and through different buildings.
"Go on then," John growled, folding his arms and glaring.
"Wait," Donovan interrupted, holding up a hand.  "I'm a detective, not a horse trainer, so cut me some slack if this sounds like a stupid question, but you just talked about somebody shooting an animal capable of winning almost a half million dollars?  In a single race?  Not to mention all those stud fees and whatnot the reporters at the Kentucky Derby talk about?  Couldn't they have...I dunno, done some sort of surgery or something to repair the broken leg?"
"What did you want to know what my plans for the day are," Sherlock clarified, barely managing to resist the urge to call Molly an idiot to her face.  Instead, he settled for tilting his head and giving her an inquisitive look.
Mindful of Donovan's warning, Sherlock managed to suppress the urge to roll his eyes.  It was a close thing.  "Because I am working on a case and it necessitates me being undercover."
Sherlock pursed his lips, trying to slot the terms John had used against his mental library of local colloquialisms and native botanical flora.  'Seeing daylight' was a rodeo slang term referring to a rider coming far enough off the horse that daylight was visible between the rider's posterior and horse's back, but the term 'Indian figs' was unknown.
“So, Dad...what do you think?” James asked Sherlock when John folded the pages and handed them back.  James' voice was level, containing no overt emotion, but Sherlock could still read the traces of apprehension in his eyes.
The mare had gone for the girl's neck and shoulder with her teeth, doing considerable damage to the sternomastoid muscle, external jugular vein, bone and skin.  Simpson said he'd used one of his scarves to try and stanch the bleeding while waiting for help to arrive.  Fortunately for Miss Tregennis, on-site paramedics and ambulances were standard safety precautions at rodeo events, which was likely the reason Miss Tregennis was still alive.
The hot wind gusted, bringing them Alice's good-natured jibe about her friend's preference for 'built blonds'.  Sherlock tried—and failed—to suppress a surge of envious bile at Edith's retort, which included a particularly lewd observation about John's stamina and his preference for brunettes.
Sherlock blinked, more than a little surprised by the casual display of athleticism.  He’d known that the role of rodeo clowns and American bullfighters (aka Rodeo Protection Athletes) had once been synonymous: the clown would distract the bull so the cowboy could flee to safety.  As the bulls became more dangerous, though, the roles had evolved into two distinct occupations.  Though there was sometimes overlap in smaller rodeos, the modern role of the clown was to entertain the crowd while bullfighters dressed as clowns risked their lives to keep the bull riders safe.  Seeing a man dressed as Buster Keaton performing stunts that would have done the original man proud was unexpected, to say the least.
"No.  I'm looking forward to it," Sherlock lied, wrenching his thoughts back to the matter at hand.  It was aggravating, really, how his libido kept distracting him.  He should be concentrating on the merits of the case, not on the merits of John Watson's excellent arse.  Sherlock turned to face Molly, subtly spreading his legs as he laid his left arm along the back of the seat.  "I also need to purchase a replacement for my broken phone," Sherlock added, his expression wry.
"That was amazing," John announced, applauding loudly from his station by the sink.
"You're from California—I mean Nevada?" Sherlock interrupted, trying to recall his vague memories of American geography and the corresponding rodeo circuits before John hauled off and punched his source.  "Isn't it a bit of trip to compete in a rodeo event that won't even count towards your requisite points?"
"A condom, Billy," John repeated patiently, the smile in his voice making it clear he found Sherlock's confusion endearing, rather than off-putting.  "We're not going any further without one...and I don't want to have to stop once I get started."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the curtain, there was a significant pause, followed by a skeptical, "You walk around naked in front of your housekeeper?"
horse that even tried to bite or kick me—even a cute foal."
Only to scratch as John stepped sideways.
.  Sherlock read it easily, despite it being upside down.  Donovan handed the phone back to Sherlock with a grimace, tapping the nib of her pen reflexively against the surface of her desk, the impact making soft, little ticking sounds.  "So tell me, Mr. Holmes…what are some of the ways a horse might be drugged?"
Sherlock turned to see John Watson running towards him, a brilliant smile on his face.
"My ex-sister-in-law.  She's also a criminal defense lawyer.  She's the one who pointed out that first, suing Riley would take a lot more money than I have to spend, and two, what good would it do?  If it wasn't Riley and her PRESS gang, it'd just be somebody else," John concluded as he straightened up and turned his attention back to the Humvee.
It's fun," John explained, his smile evident in his voice.  "'Course, it's a sport better slated for big guys.  Like Keshawn."
The extra thick socks he'd purchased were providing some protection to his feet, but it wasn't enough.  Soreness along his toes and the back of his heels where the leather was rubbing promised future blisters if he didn't change his footwear soon.
."  The sound of the zipper seemed abnormally loud in the quiet air, as did the rustle of fabric as John tugged Sherlock’s jeans and pants away, baring him to John’s appreciative gaze.
John gave him a sideways look, one eyebrow rising mischievously.  "Epiphany then?"
"Mostly," Lestrade replied with another grimace, "depending on each individual state and the event sanctions at play.  The PRCA officially opposes gambling, but since it's not an official rule, members often ignore it.  And if it was, well, there's always illegal gambling."
Sherlock looked down at his plate and began picking at one of the crusts of his sandwich.  "I...saw you in action at the fairgrounds the other day," Sherlock confessed in a low voice, feigning bashfulness.
In the improved light, it was easy to see the bloodstains on the horse's face and neck.  The dried, rust-red smears stood out in stark contrast to the stallion's copper-coloured coat.
Sherlock closed his eyes in disgust as the table full of inebriated Alpha Male idiots closest to him burst into whoops and cheers, the din punctuated by the sounds of shot glasses being slammed to the table top.  It was the third time in the last hour he'd been subjected to the display and he wasn't sure whether or not he should be grateful that the noise was loud enough to drown out the bar's sound system.
(better known as foxglove), hemlock, St. John's Wort and
"Mornin' Billy!" John chirped, tipping his hat with the hand that wasn't holding an oversized, aluminum travel mug.  The words 'Veterinary medicine: where every day you're reminded that you like animals better than people' were emblazoned on the side, which was a sentiment Sherlock could fully agree with.
"Who?  The woman who flagged me down?"
"Molly Hooper said something along those same lines.  That still doesn't explain your suspicions that somebody is deliberately targeting your business, however."
Tucking his hands into his pockets, Sherlock left the house and began to amble across the yard, nodding cordially when he saw an employee.  Most returned his nod with one of their own, except for the one or two that ignored him completely, being preoccupied with leading horses or shoveling manure.  They were clearly focused on their work.  Even when several staff were working in the same barn, idle chatter was kept to a minimum.  Whether that was because Candii Ross was visibly on hand as she made her rounds, or because it was the standard operating procedure, Sherlock couldn’t be certain, but the occasional eye flicks and blank expressions indicated it was the former, rather than the latter.
"Dull!" Sherlock huffed, not bothering to open his eyes.  "All horses are valuable to their owners at the circles you operate in.  Most don't sell for less than several hundred thousand pounds and some sell for considerably more."  He shifted slightly, his toes flexing and curling under the cover of the blanket.  "As for the claim of 'sudden, unprovoked aggression,'" Sherlock continued, his tone snide, "you and I are both aware that most cases of 'sudden, unprovoked aggression' are caused by one of two things: either somebody is guilty of animal abuse, or somebody is guilty of being unconscionably stupid by rewarding an animal for behavioral transgressions.  Tragic as it may be that a horse may be euthanized because some idiot died after being kicked or thrown by an eighty-five stone animal, it hardly justifies your presence in my flat.  If it's so important to your client, I suggest you contact The Woman and kindly piss off."
"So Mike has told me, yeah, starting with the Hippocratic Oath.  He's got some stories about the places he was stationed when he was working for Doctors Without Borders.  But those laws are intended for doctors treating human patients," John pointed out dryly as he re-buckled his own seat belt and tightened it across his chest.
" as Seb Wilkes had so gleefully pointed out the last time the two of them had crossed paths.  Here, in America, his connections were less readily available.  More importantly, he didn't want to depend on his brother to bail him out of prison again.  That one time in Belarus had been bad enough.  "What I have
"Well, you can't blame her or her husband for wanting the horses to be happy," John pointed out with a shrug.  "Or for wanting to save a bit of money.  Horses are herd animals...they need company.  Besides, sometimes a mare and a gelding can be turned out successfully."
"Negative," Sherlock reported Lestrade's response.
Sherlock blinked, realizing with some private chagrin that he'd apparently drunk a third of it.  Such actions didn't bode well for his intent to remain sober.  "Maybe in a bit," Sherlock demurred.  He studied the plate in front of him for a moment, noticing with no small amount of relief that the toppings were mostly clumped together on top.  The fries underneath were fairly plain.  Using his knife and fork, Sherlock began peeling the top layer of cheese back.
Sherlock tilted his head.  "However did Mike Stamford find out?"
"And how long do ya think that's gonna take?"
Oh.  Now that could be problematic.  Sherlock suppressed a reflexive grimace, wishing he'd somehow managed to secure the false license he'd wanted.  Sadly, even Mycroft's powers had limitations.  Following the officer's instructions, Sherlock reached into his back pocket and pulled his wallet free.  Still moving slowly, he opened the leather billfold and handed the plastic card over.  As he did so, the other man came close enough for Sherlock to see the rank pins he wore on his collar, as well as read the letters inscribed on the silver nametag the man wore clipped above the left front pocket of his uniform shirt.
"I'm not surprised," John replied, his tone chiding.  He reached out and picked up Sherlock's arm and palpated it gently, nodding matter-of-factly when Sherlock winced.  "It's swollen, which is to be expected, considering I just saw you scale a fence like an idiot.  Why aren't you wearing your splint, the way Mike advised?"
"Well, I can still kind of empathize with your brother." John replied, grinning.  "Most of us had that message drilled into our heads by our parents.  At least he got lucky and you grew up to be a functional adult," John continued, a faint trace of bitterness colouring his tone.  "Harry's only a few minutes younger than me, but the way she acts, it could be a decade.  She's always calling me up, asking me to bail her out of trouble and half the time it's because she's...well...never mind."  John gave a quick, tight smile.  "Let's not talk about that.  Changing the topic, do you play piano?"
John's hands were callused as well, but if he were anywhere near the level of sexual master that was implied by the remarks Molly Hooper, Candii Ross and others had made, there was no way he'd risk causing a partner discomfort with chafing.
Sherlock kept the pleasant smile fixed on his face while he waited, deducing the cook in the meantime.
"One point for caroming off of two balls, two points for three balls, and the face value of any balls pocketed...for a maximum of eleven possible points per shot...like so…" John said as he took his shot.  The cue ball rolled down the table and ricocheted off of the 3 ball, sending it neatly into a pocket.  "There.  That right there?  That's three points."
Sherlock swallowed hard, mesmerized by the glimpse of tanned skin revealed by the low-slung jeans and tight shirt.  "Uh...What do you have?" Sherlock asked, refocusing on the plates he was preparing in an effort to distract himself.
"Please."
"I was noticing your gait is off—I'm a vet, I'm trained to keep an eye out for these sorts of things," John pointed out in response to Sherlock's blink of surprise.  He tilted his head to one side and pursed his lips in consideration as he studied Sherlock's feet.  "Something wrong with your boots?  They don't look like they're new..."
“I take it you speak from experience?” Sherlock asked dryly, shifting his feet into a more comfortable position and taking a covert sniff of John’s scent. Sweat, cattle, sun-warmed cotton and saddle oil all mingling to create a smell that was uniquely
John winced.  "Oh Jesus.  What happened?"
"Equine rehabilitation expert, and you know Molly Hooper," John said slowly, clearly thinking as he steered his truck around a medium-sized pothole.  "Did Candii Ross hire you to work with that murderous stallion of hers?"
John turned his head to look over his shoulder.  "Look's like the line dancing's about to start," he replied with a shrug.
Baz laughed nastily, confirming Sherlock's hunch.  "Naw.  We were stationed together overseas a couple of times.  The pogues and REMFs always need somebody to watch their backs since they're too busy with sutures and critters to hold a gun."
A sudden gust of cold air rushed in, bringing with it the smell of diesel exhaust, livestock, and dust.  It tore across the dark parking lot, whipping up dust devils with dragging trash and the occasional tumbleweed in its wake.  The detritus skittered across the cracked asphalt.  The rattle and scrape of empty aluminum cans were joined by the irregular, bouncing thump of oversized Styrofoam cups that had previously contained sodas or other smuggled-in beverages.
It wasn't strictly an accurate statement.  He'd cheerfully allowed himself to be bribed into releasing false information in pursuit of an investigation before.  There had been a particularly lucrative (and challenging) case he'd become embroiled in several years ago involving three grooms, two jockeys, an out-of-work, drug-addicted graduate chemist, secretions from the backs of South American Waxy Monkey Tree Frogs and several members of the local high-ranking families.  The frogs naturally secreted a substance that contained hundreds of beneficial bioactive compounds, including analgesics that provided pain relief.  The chemist had figured out a way to derive a hitherto-unknown analgesic from his pets' skin that also produced incredible energy and stamina when injected subcutaneously.  One of the chemist's more enterprising customers had realized the drug's potential and had introduced it to one of the family's horse trainers under the reasoning that a horse that couldn't feel pain would naturally run faster.  The theory had born fruit.  More importantly, the standard drug tests used at the time hadn't been capable of detecting the compound.  It had taken him several months' worth of work in his laboratory to identify the chemicals involved and develop a new testing methodology to detect them, but he'd done it.
—we met during a class.  She was very interested in collecting and harvesting mushrooms and studying their different properties.  Particularly edible ones.  I have kept her books because I hope to give them to my daughter someday.  Her mother used to entertain herself by writing funny notes and observations in the margins of when she was bored.  She was always correcting the punctuation of the authors."
"Do you think this could be related to whatever made him act spooky a few months ago?" Lestrade asked suddenly, stepping forward so he could better watch what John was doing.
Candii Ross's claims that her horses were among the best available wasn't an idle boast.  The bucking strings from various contactors were mixed together for competitions, but it was easy identify the Triple C's horses by their distinctive coloration and the speed with which they dispatched their riders.  Some cowboys managed to stay on for the full eight seconds required to qualify, but the majority were thrown within the first four seconds.  And—as Candii Ross had bragged—a rider who qualified riding on a Triple C bronco tended to receive scores that were two to three points higher on average than a rider that hadn't been on a Triple C bronco.
"Whatever you want me to do, the answer's no," Sherlock growled at the besuited figure standing in the threshold of 221B.  He was bored but he wasn't bored enough to stoop to voluntarily taking one of Mycroft's cases without protesting loudly.  Standards had to be maintained after all.  With an angry sniff, Sherlock rolled over and presented his back to the room, radiating the air of a mortally-offended feline.  "Go away."
"Mmmm…nope.  My sole responsibility is to Devil's Blaze.  I just need to return at some point in the next few hours.  Why?"
Donovan acknowledged the barb with a sneer, but there was a healthy dose of curiosity intermixed with her skepticism.  "So how much are we talking about?" Donovan asked, tilting her head to one side.  "According to the fraud cases I read, Tommy 'The Sandman' Burns was paid between $5000 to $40,000 per horse he electrocuted."
"Oh, so now I'm finally allowed to look?" Sherlock heard John grumble from the front of the tent.  "Don't know what you need me for; it's not like you've been asking my opinion this whole time…"
"I said I'm
Sherlock checked his watch, blinking in surprise at the time displayed.  The entire division, from beginning to end had taken less than twenty minutes.
"That's fantastic!" John exclaimed.  "I can't believe you've gotten that far, this fast."
Donovan blinked and let out a silent whistle.
Catching Molly's gaze, Sherlock gave her a particularly soulful look through his long eyelashes, the one that worked quite well on men and women both.  "My apologies," Sherlock replied, his tone carefully contrite.  He adding the tiniest wobble possible to his bottom lip.  "I didn't mean to insult you.  I'm...not used to ranch hands with ambitions beyond drinking or getting laid."
Sherlock was fully aware that he was a somewhat intimidating sight from his perch on the top of the high fence.  Not that it could be helped; not as long as Devil's Blaze ran the risk of bolting.  Unfortunately, from the horse's viewpoint, Sherlock almost certainly resembled a predator, perhaps a mountain lion, seeking a higher vantage point in preparation for dropping down on its prey.  His current outfit probably didn't help either.
Sterndale tipped his head to one side and shrugged.  "There are dozens of possibilities.  Field Horsetail can result in a horse becoming abnormally calm.  Consumption of Jimson Weed can cause trembling.  Mountain Laurel can cause repeated swallowing and profuse salivation.  Colic can result in a horse acting out because it is in pain.  Both
"Noted," Donovan replied coolly before turning back to where Sherlock and Doctor Früh had been observing the exchange with interest.  "Sorry."
Sherlock cracked an eye open.  "Yes?" he slurred.
"Mmmm...yes.  Or no.  Maybe?"  Sherlock furrowed his brow, trying to articulate what he had noticed on the first day, but the idea flickering through his brain was too small and too quick for him to seize, like the minnows he and Redbeard used to chase when he was a small child.  "Perhaps?" Sherlock asked, scrunching up his nose as he tried to think.  "I don't know.  I can't be certain."
Sherlock looked up from his phone where he’d been typing a search for IBK.  “Pardon?”
Sherlock decided,
Bending down, Sherlock ran the torch's beam over the metal latch handle of the stall door.  He could see the faint smudges of black powder from where somebody had dusted for prints, though whether the forensics team had uncovered anything useful would be another question entirely.  Pulling a handkerchief out from his pocket, he used it to open the latch, before stepping back and allowing the door to swing open into the aisle.  The photographs of the scene that Mycroft had supplied had been useful, but he prefered to make his deductions in person.  Far too often, valuable data was overlooked because of a crime scene technician failing to view a scene in all three dimensions.  They tended to concentrate on the floor and walls, but ignored evidence on the ceiling.  When dealing with an animal that could rear to a height of ten feet, or more, it paid to look up.
I had been raising in that particular container...and then, to add insult to injury, she called in an exterminator to deal with the ones that had escaped from her cake bowl and the resultant fogging killed the rest of my crop!"
Molly shook her head.  "I grew up in Oklahoma.  On a cattle ranch.  With cows.  Um…not really with the cows.  I mean I grew up in a house...well, trailer actually.  Original country girl from the middle of nowhere, that's me."  She gave a self-conscious laugh, a flush darkening her fair skin.
“She did ask for a current photo of you,” Sherlock pointed out.  “It would be easy enough to find a nice frame in the shops that would suit one of your school pictures.  If you wanted, we could purchase it before we head to Sussex, or even afterwards, if you want more time to think on it.”
"You know what my point is, you just don't want to think about it, despite the fact that it is our
Unfortunately, it quickly became clear that the stallion wasn't inclined to listen, despite his body language.  Instead of looking at Sherlock and pricking his ears forward in a sign of respect, the stallion reared up and charged Sherlock in a display of fear-fueled aggression.
, Sherlock corrected--
It was on the tip of Sherlock's tongue to protest that Molly wasn't his date, but before he could, John tipped his hat and strode away, the slump of his shoulders almost imperceptible.
"Um, sure."
"It's a hybrid game," John explained.  "Do you know how to play thirty-eight?"
And rodeo animals hadn't always been well treated.
“But I’m aroused, John!” Sherlock complained, throwing up his arms and gesturing to emphasize his current, tumenscent state.
"Shut it.  Both of you," John ordered.  "I know you're both worried, but we'll know more once I get Scotty to the clinic and run some tests.  In the meantime," John began, taking his keys from his pocket, grabbing Sherlock's hand and slapping his keys into Sherlock's palm with enough force to sting, "you do me a favor and get a scotch hobble, a set of standard hobbles and a grazing muzzle from my truck, okay?  It's the large army footlocker on the left.  Thanks.  Greg," John continued, turning to face the other man, "fill a bucket with some cool water so I can clean off the worst of Scotty's injuries.  I need to know what I'm dealing with."
"What are 'Western Nights?" Sherlock asked, shifting to a slightly more comfortable position.  One of the seat's worn springs was starting to determinedly poke him in the arse.
He took a seat and leaned back against the tree trunk with a huff.  Bonnie welcomed his presence with a lazy wag of her tail and the canine equivalent of a grin.  Sherlock felt his lips quirk in an involuntary smile as he automatically reached over to rub the collie's ears.  It wasn't quite as soothing as playing his violin, but his violin wasn't here and Bonnie was.  The dog responded with a happy growl.  Bonnie’s non-judgemental company and unabashed joy in his touch was something of a mental and physical balm Sherlock mused as he gently worked a sand burr free of the silky hair.  Especially after the hours he’d spent struggling with Devil’s Blaze.  As if sensing Sherlock’s scrutiny, Devil’s Blaze raised his head and flehemed, no doubt honing in on the traces of Sherlock’s scent and his corresponding location based on the direction of the wind.
"Explain.  Why wouldn’t a rider wear a helmet during an event that’s
John gave him a disbelieving look.  "What?
Sherlock shook his head mutely, too shocked and hurt to immediately reply.  The idea of John, blond, fit, intelligent
"Cinnamon and spearmint," John read aloud.  "Any preference?"
Molly shook her head.  "Just buckle bunnies...um...women who really like rodeo cowboys," Molly added, slanting a quick, shamefaced look across to Sherlock.  "Um…as I said, Joe kind of kept to himself outside of work."
"While the many facets of barrel racing are no doubt fascinating for those involved, we do have a schedule to keep," Sherlock announced abruptly, ignoring the warning glare Donovan slanted at him.  "Moving on," Sherlock continued, fixing his gaze on Brenda, "what can you tell me about Cream Soda's diet?  Did she stay on the same feeding regimen year round, or did you compensate the protein/roughage ratio during the off season?"  It was unlikely that overfeeding was the issue, but he'd encountered more than once among inexperienced owners; it only made sense to eliminate all possible reasons for sudden behavioral changes.  He'd once overheard a livery-yard employee describe giving high-protein soybean meal to a pet horse as 'sticking high-octane dynamite up a thoroughbred's arse and lighting it'.  While high-octane dynamite didn't technically exist, he nevertheless understood the sentiment the handler was expressing.  Overfeeding and under-exercising could make even the most mild horse go stir-crazy with boredom.
There was a deadly silence.  Some of the more observant bar patrons began edging away and towards the exits while others began reaching for their mobile phones.
"They're all over the place.  Eye inflammation, increased aggression…it's almost like a bunch of different cattle got accidently poisoned by Jimson weed or Woolly locoweed, but I checked the pastures myself and didn't find anything."
"Anything else?"
"Aside from the fact that bulls are prey animals like moose are prey animals, that's...not a bad summarization," John replied, clearly trying not to grimace at Sherlock's answer.  "But not...strictly accurate."
"For the love of God, get up here so I can kiss you again!" Sherlock begged, grabbing desperately at John's biceps and tugging the other man up towards the head of the bed.  With a chuckle, John obliged, moving up and blanketing Sherlock with his body, before tilting his head down to reclaim Sherlock's mouth with a predatory purr.
"What happened?" John asked gently.  "You grew up on a ranch, right?  Did somebody shoot him?"
The ubiquitous rancher outfit of slightly worn, but mostly clean denim trousers, cowboy boots and a battered cowboy hat was present.  Incongruously enough, so was a plaid bow tie and traces of hot pink around the cuticles of the man's fingernails.  Sherlock's gaze flicked sideways.  There was no trace of a ring, and the man was at least seventy years old, if not more.  A grandchild was the most likely source of the fingernail polish, meaning that 'Old' Wayne Jones was an indulgent grandfather.  A trait that would mesh with his fond tone when describing the dog.
This one was prompted by FuckYeah Fight!lock's "Aww.  Look at my empty, smut-free Ask box.  I SAID LOOK AT IT.  I hope you're happy with what you've done."  And then she gave me permission to play.  So I did.
"What are you doing?"
Sherlock pulled open the aforementioned drawer and fumbled through the contents while John busied himself by undoing Sherlock's belt and zip and easing his jeans down his legs.  John's look of approval and husky "nice" as he caught sight of Sherlock's silk pants made Sherlock grateful that he'd opted for them.
Not that it was having any visible effect.  The horse was too busy panicking, despite the rider's efforts.
"I overheard that Candii Ross has agreed to keep Straker's cabin locked and untouched while the investigation is ongoing," Sherlock added.
"Nominally yes?"
"Yes.  She was a gift from my first teacher in honor of my twelfth birthday.  Receiving her was the only thing that made the day somewhat bearable."
"Dick," John said with a laugh, apparently oblivious to the interested looks the two women were giving him.  He leaned forward, the unbuttoned collar of his shirt revealing a tempting slice of golden-bronze skin.  "Or, since you're talking about bees, should that be 'prick'?"
"Well maybe she's trying to be clever," Lestrade pointed out.  "Throw you off the scent, or something."
John would probably have something pithy to say about 'Billy's' tendency to subsist on cat naps while working, Sherlock thought with a contemptuous sniff as he settled into a more comfortable slouch.  No doubt it would consist of a tedious lecture about the dangers of burning candles at two ends and in the middle or some other equally hyperbolic claim...not that it mattered since John was still off working as a rodeo veterinarian in Dakota...Des Moines...Delaware...Denver?  Whatever place it was that started with the letter 'D' that John had been gone to for the last week or so.
“Physical therapists are the worst,” another person piped up.  “The one I had after I broke my hip falling off Dumbass would’ve made a stereotypical drill-sergeant look like a cuddly bunny rabbit.”
"Good.  How about I follow you in my truck, park at your flat and then we can run to the shops together?  That way, if I stay late, only one of us has to make the forty-five-minute drive home."
Sherlock blinked in confusion, before his nose abruptly registered the foetid mess of excrement smeared down his back.  It was wet and cold as it oozed through his shirt, adding insult to injury.  Oh well.  It wasn't like he hadn't landed in worse before.  Mrs. Hudson could testify to that fact.  "Obviously," Sherlock replied after a moment, his tone dry.  John surprised him by bursting into a fit of giggles.
The elderly man laughed, a deep, rich, bubbling sound that would have reminded Sherlock of nothing so much as a fountain or a stream if he were inclined to metaphorical comparisons.  "And aren't you a fancy, well-mannered young feller?" Jones asked rhetorically.  "Why don't you call me Old Wayne?  Jes' the same as everybody else."  Old Wayne reached out and clapped Sherlock on his left shoulder, hard enough to make Sherlock stagger.  "Come on in, son," he said, chivving Sherlock along with a gentle shove.  "Let's get you inside and fed up…yer far too skinny."
arrest you."
There was a show of hands.  Herb nodded.  “Right, well, make sure you tell the floor manager about any bulls that seem extra-nasty during loading so they can alert the rodeo clowns ahead of time.”
"It helps facilitate venous return and restores blood flow to the brain."
The men's outfits had been equally ludicrous.  The majority of them had been wearing artificially-distressed designer denim jeans, accentuated with flashy, oversized belt buckles in a blatant attempt to advertise sexual prowess.  Some men had elected to wear flannel button-downs or cotton shirts adorned with horribly impractical fringe or embroidery.  Others had opted for skin-tight white or black cotton vests that left little to the imagination, no doubt hoping the virile displays would increase their probability of a successful sexual conquest.
Molly shook her head, her tongue flicking out to wet her lips.  "I know him professionally more than anything.  He's been involved on the rodeo circuit for a few years now.  A lot of us know each other to at least some extent.  It's a small world.  Even smaller if you work with animals."
"Ride 'em, cowboy," Sherlock mumbled, before dissolving into snickers.
When Sherlock finally stopped to take a rest after a good ninety minutes worth of work, both he and Devil’s Blaze were both doubly exhausted from their struggle for dominance and from the unrelenting glare from the harsh sun high overhead.  Sherlock walked the stallion out to cool him down and watered him, before picking up his own two bottles of lukewarm water and retreating to the shade of his (and Bonnie's) preferred tree so he could relax without unnecessarily exposing himself to even more UVA and UVB radiation.  The air under the shade was only marginally cooler, perhaps thirty-six degrees Celsius instead of thirty-seven, but there was a faint breeze, which helped.
"Lead on," Sherlock ordered, adjusting the angle of his hat before following John out the door and into the brilliantly hot sunshine.
"Uh huh," John retorted, his blue eyes narrowed with concern.  "That looked an awful lot like a potential syncope to me.  How's your head?" John asked, not releasing his grip on Sherlock's shoulder.  With his other hand, he reached up and tilted Sherlock's chin down so he could examine Sherlock's pupils.  Sherlock swallowed in reaction.  John's fingers were shockingly warm against his own cool skin.  John's eyes were narrowed in concentration, a little furrow appearing between his eyebrows.  "Did you hit it when you went down?" John demanded as he gently pushed on Sherlock's chin to turn his head from side to side, watching the way Sherlock's eyes moved in response to motion.
“Twinnings…English Breakfast…” Sherlock murmured, wrapping his tongue around the tip of of John’s left index finger and suckling it gently.
"I assume you mean explosion in the metaphorical sense, rather than the literal sense," Sherlock said dryly.
"What about?"
"Well, for starters gay rodeos...really aren't his scene.  Plus, I seem to remember Ned being more of a cattleman than a horseman, that's all."
"Ugh.  You talkin' 'bout the umbrella man?"  At Sherlock's nod, Candii snorted.  "Cora-René warned me 'bout him.  Said he's so high an' prissy, he could drown inna rainstorm, his nose is stuck so far in the air."  Candii leaned back and tucked her thumbs into her belt loops.  "Ya gotta quick mouth on you, Holmes.  Might want to watch that 'round here.  It'd be a shame if somebody decided to ruin those purty nose and teeth of yours."
"Did he now?" Donovan asked, blinking in apparent surprise.  Pursing her lips, she added "Captain Lestrade didn't inform me of that fact.  That his horse was acting up, or that Doctor Watson examined him."
John responded with a grin and a cheeky wink.  "Ah, now that's a treat for me."  He stepped forward and brushed a light kiss across Sherlock's pout.  "You look bloody fantastic in semi-formal dress," he murmured. "The monochrome colour scheme sets off your remarkable eyes.  Plus I want to be able to show off the gorgeous genius I married to some of my colleagues."
“…PROBABLY THE WORST IDEA YOU’VE EVER HAD!” the announcer retorted, responding to some unheard comment, and drawing Sherlock’s attention back to the arena.  “—NOT WHAT SHE SAID.  SERIOUSLY, WHO THINKS THAT TAKING SOMEBODY OUT AND ORDERING KATSU IKA ODORI-DON IS A GOOD IDEA FOR A FIRST DATE?  NOW LIGHTSABER DUELS, THAT’S A GOOD FIRST DATE—WHOOPS!  ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO!  OOOOH, HOPKINS GOT A RUN…OH NO, HE COMES UP EMPTY, FOLKS!” the announcer continued as the unfortunate Hopkins missed his grab and landed facedown in the dirt.  “SHAME!  THAT’S A GOOD COWBOY WHO JUST HAD SOME BACK LUCK IN THE DRAW.  WOULD Y’ALL MAKE HIM FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER WITH SOME KIND APPLAUSE?  THAT’S GOTTA TASTE NASTY…”
"Self-taught, mostly.  I can open a can, scramble eggs, boil water and fry stuff in a cast-iron skillet.  That's about it."  John took a sip of his ice water and shrugged.  "Neither my mother nor my grandmother thought men belonged in a kitchen—that was a woman's place, which pissed my sister Harry and me both right off."
There was a pause, followed by the sound of running boots doubling back.
"Hello?" Sherlock asked hesitantly as he answered, automatically shifting his voice upward into Billy's soft northern lilt.
"It depends on Devil's Blaze."
"Okay," Molly said, tucking a flyaway strand of hair behind her ear.  "No promises, but um...I'll see you in row B in a few minutes."
His stomach growled again, reminding him that the last thing he'd eaten had been a sickeningly-sweet, oversized sticky bun covered with a sticky white glaze. As much as he was loath to admit it, the demands of his transport for sustenance after his trip were overriding his normal reluctance to eat when on a case.
"Yeah, that's it...you're a natural!" John said, his grin growing wider as he watched Sherlock.
"Sorry?"
According to his research, John had earned almost twenty thousand pounds, or twenty-five thousand dollars from competitions the prior year.  It wasn't quite enough to put him in the top fifteen earners for a NFR invitation, but it was still a sizable amount of money.  The cash prize associated with John's All American Tour championship bronco buckle alone had been almost ten thousand pounds.  If the man's sandwich choice at the café and the state of his boots were any indication, then John clearly wasn't spending his earnings on the high life, which begged the question of what
Sherlock rubbed a hand over his face again, trying to think like 'Billy' over the clamor inside his skull.  "You're right," Sherlock agreed, giving Molly a rueful, self-depreciating smile as he sat back up.  "My head hurts and I'm in a bad mood, but I shouldn't be taking it out on you."
"Right," John confirmed with a firm nod.  "In that case, I know what we're doing next time we're someplace relatively private.  Meanwhile, here's the bull barn," John announced unnecessarily with an expansive gesture.
Donovan shrugged.  "Perfectly, though some family members might consider it a bit unethical to profit off of their loved one's death.  It costs a lot to replace an experienced or highly trained employee, you see.  Losing one can be a major financial blow.  It's not unusual for a small business—which is what Candii Ross technically qualifies as—to insure key employees to offset the potential damages, especially in a high-risk occupation.  The rate's often calculated at five years times the employee's salary."
Sterndale gave Sherlock an amused and slightly condescending smile.  "You aren't the first person to suggest such a thing, Mr. Scott, but it isn't currently feasible.  Cape buffalo belong to the
John's voice carried the crack of military command and Sherlock found himself straightening up involuntarily.  "What?" Sherlock snapped defensively, blinking rapidly as he tried to process what had gone wrong.  John had been kissing him back and the unexpected rejection felt like a shard of ice had suddenly settled in his belly, making him want to shiver despite the sweltering air.  "Did I misunderstand your intentions?" Sherlock demanded, pulling his pride about him like a metaphorical Belstaff.  "Do you not want me to kiss you?""
That rivalries and contests of horsemanship and cattle-wrangling skills would develop between different ranches was practically a given, considering human nature.  The Afghan people had Buzkashi—a rather violent game wherein a scrummage of mounted players armed with whips fought to steal a calf or goat carcass from each other and transport it across a field to a marker to score a goal.  Turkish Jereed players tried to hit each other with blunted javelins thrown from horseback.  The Medieval French had developed jousting, a competition that involved two riders, each armed with a six or seven foot wooden lance, riding towards each other with the goal of using the lance to unseat the opposing rider.  And then there was equestrian polo with its mallets.  Though American tourists often considered polo to be the quintessential British sport, it had actually originated in the Middle East sometime during the Achaemenid and Parthian Empires as a calvary training game.  Polo hadn’t been introduced in the UK until 1869.
The walls that Sherlock could see were painted in varying shades of pale yellow; they were marred with old nail holes, scuffs and one or two irregularly textured spots where somebody had obviously tried to patch a spot, given up halfway through and slapped some new paint on in a bid to make it halfway presentable.  Bulletin boards of varying sizes and styles crammed with papers added visual clutter.  Modular carpet tiles in light tan, interspersed with regular blocks of darker brown covered the floor.  Likely some idiot designer's attempt at making the dated building feel 'trendy'.  The use of modular tiles was logical; it was far more economical to replace individual tiles stained by the inevitable coffee accident, though their overall threadbare condition made it clear that aesthetics were not high on the priority list.  There were no cubicles.  Instead rows of desks lined the space and, despite the late hour, the room's inhabitants were moving in a state of subdued pandemonium.  Sherlock could see police officers filling out paperwork at their desks and answering phone calls.  One woman, a dispatcher judging by the headset she was wearing was hurrying down the bull pen's main aisle, clutching a large Styrofoam cup of coffee in her left hand.  An older man, probably close to retirement based on the size of his belly, Sherlock judged, was walking the other way, several cardboard boxes labeled 'The Donut Stop' carried in his arms.  Observation complete, Sherlock turned his attention to the detective he would be meeting shortly, determined to deduce what he could through the open doorway of her office.
"Oh…that's very sweet of you, actually," Molly commented, interrupting Sherlock's mental ramblings.  "What does she like?" Molly asked, tilting her head to the side in a move that she probably hoped came across as flirtatious, but instead put Sherlock in mind of the songbirds that used to flit around the gardens and feeder tables at the Holmes family estate.  A Chaffinch, perhaps, or maybe a wren: something small, brown and overly talkative, at least.
?" Brenda insisted, leaning forward as much as her healing injuries would allow.
“Shut up.  Do you want me to explain or not?” John asked, his voice taking on an edge of annoyance.
"Er…that's what we call it when somebody gets thrown over the front of a horse.  I'm always a little bit worried that they're going to get hurt, but it's...pretty fun to watch, and the smarter riders wear padded vests when competing.  Blaze seemed to treat it like a game.  Once he threw a rider, he'd prance around, his tail up in the air like he was gloating, if that makes sense," Molly replied, giving Sherlock a hesitant smile which he returned before allowing it to fall away.
Taking advantage of the welcome conversation lull, Sherlock turned his head to focus on the passing landscape.  It was still monotonously flat, except for...
"Let me see.  You decent?"
Sherlock nodded sagely, committing the relevant details of Candii Ross's tirade to memory for further investigation later.  "And you think somebody is deliberately targeting your business because of your successful bucking strings?"
Adopting an expression of interest, Sherlock reached down and pulled one of Molly's textbooks free from her bag.  It was a battered, but still serviceable copy of Beurgelt and Del Piero's
"Thank you.  I appreciate your cooperation.  If possible, I would also ask that you restrict Doctor Watson from having unsupervised access to New Scotland Yard, perhaps restrict access altogether.  The fewer details that are shared about New Scotland Yard's prognosis and diagnosis, the better."
"Oh my god…just look at you," John whispered, his tone unmistakably reverent.  He reached out and slowly smoothed his left hand over Sherlock's belly, his fingertips skimming lightly over the delineations of Sherlock's abdominal muscles.  "You are so goddamn gorgeous…You're a fucking work of art…like one of those Greek statues we studied in school…all perfect alabaster skin and godlike proportions."  John swallowed hard and leaned forward to claim Sherlock's lips in an unmistakably filthy kiss.  "The things I'm gonna do to you, you gorgeous man," John whispered as he shifted to kneel in the footwell and reached for Sherlock’s fly. "Just you
“Ask who what?” Sherlock asked, feigning ignorance as he carefully transferred freshly-baked peach scones to the nearly-empty trays filling the bakery case.  “Also, do we have any more kolache in the back?  The apple ones topped with posipka were popular, as were the farmer cheese ones.”  The morning’s business had been brisk, seriously depleting their stocks.  If the after-lunch rush was similar, they might well run out of baked goods before closing.
Regrettably, (despite what he'd implied to Candii Ross), he was still no closer to identifying the chemical agent used.  He'd been so busy between working with Devil's Blaze, arranging to get New Scotland Yard transferred and investigating John that he hadn't had time to get back to Anderson's lab and follow up on his latest test results, let alone start a new round of experiments.  At this rate, he was going to have to resort to finding some sort of assistant, Sherlock thought grouchily as he picked up his mug of quasi-coffee.
"Yeah.  Him.  How's he doing?"
"I see," Candii replied, countering with a sardonically-raised eyebrow.  "Why, exactly, do ya want to bring him here?  An' no cagey pussy-footing, Holmes.  I've been 'round long enough that I can spot it a mile away."
His vigilance was warranted.
Donovan waited until Sherlock had vacated her seat before setting both to-go cups down beside the monitor within easy reach of the keyboard.  The stack of files was dropped to land on the desk with a muffled thwap, while the attaché case was set on the floor.  "You didn't answer my question earlier," Donovan reminded Sherlock as she shrugged out of her suit jacket and turned to hang it and her purse from a convenient hook on the back of the door.  "How did you get in here?  This whole area is employees only, unless you have an escort."
"That it is," John agreed, raising his eyebrows meaningfully.  "Anything else?"
"I'm fine," Sherlock croaked, willing his transport to obedience.  He was grateful that the darkness and his tight jeans hid his burgeoning erection.  "I was just wondering if you ever wore the costume?"
Sherlock thought weakly, if it weren't for John.  He could feel the warmth of John's callused palms bleeding through the thin cotton of his shirt, holding him firmly upright even though the world was threatening to tip sideways.  As if sensing it, John moved closer, insinuating one firm leg between Sherlock's to hold him place and blanketing him against the wall with his entire chest.
"Do you feed your horse sweet feed often?" Sherlock asked, turning to look over his shoulder at where Mrs. Porter was patiently waiting.
There was a last minute shuffle near the bucking chutes and then somebody waved, clearly a signal of some type.
asked: "I wonder, have we considered John as a steer-roping rodeo rider? Hat real low, almost covering his eyes. Jeans that fit jayzis-hear-and-deliver-me perfectly. Neck kerchief? Scuffed cowboy boots with the metal toe and heel things..."
Their waitress returned with their drinks.  John took a quick, appreciative sip of his beer.  "Ah, that's good," he declared, setting it off to one side.  "So," John continued, folding his arms and leaning forward to lock gazes with Sherlock.  "How was your day?"  He raised both eyebrows encouragingly.
The thought drifted through John’s mind like a leaf on a gentle breeze.  A moment later, it was joined by its friend: ‘fucking’.  Followed shortly afterwards by ‘Christ’
"How's he doin,' Holmes?"
"Strange animals being shoved into an overcrowded pen and panicking and fighting as a result is hardly unusual." Sterndale eventually pointed out, his tone making his opinion of John's observations clear.  "And dogs often run the risk of being killed when their owners let them run free.  Once again, something that is hardly worth consulting me about."
Brenda shook her head again.  "No, not at all.  Not normally, I mean."
“GOOOOOD EVENING RODEO FANS!  WELCOME TO SUNNY AMARILLO TEXAS AND THE SEMI-FINALS PERFORMANCE OF THE ANNUAL AMERICAN GAY RODEO ASSOCIATION,  WHERE BIG DREAMS AND BIG HEARTS FACE OF AGAINST SOME OF THE BEST ANIMAL ATHLETES AROUND!”  The announcer waited for the cheering to die down and the lights to come back up before speaking again.  “NOW IT’S TIME FOR OUR GRRRRAAAAAANNNNND ENTRY.  OPEN THE GATES, GIRLFRIENDS!  FIRST THROUGH—CARRIED BY OUR CURRENT QUEEN OF THE RODEO, ROSE DONE-UP, AND RU PAUL’S CONTESTANT, LUCY L’AMOUR—ARE ‘OLD GLORY’ AND THE STATE FLAG OF OUR FANTASTIC HOST STATE THIS YEAR: TEXAS!  Y’ALL GIVE IT UP FOR THESE BEAUTIFUL LADIES AND THOSE RED, WHITE AND BLUE STARS AND STRIPES!  THE LUCKY COWBOY IN THE MIDDLE CARRYING THE PRIDE FLAG IS AGRA’S CURRENT PRESIDENT, JACK DEL MAR.  PLEASE FEEL FREE TO STAND AS THE AMERICAN FLAG PASSES BY, AND THEN SIT YERSELF BACK DOWN SO YOU CAN CONTINUE TO ENJOY THE PARADE FROM THE COMFORT OF YER SEAT…”
"Considering what you told me you keep in your flour jar, I'm not surprised," John muttered in an undertone.  "Right," he said, catching the pointed look Sherlock sent him and clearing his throat.  "So...bad.  Bad as in three seconds into his ride, Bill took a horn to the head and went flying.  Soon as he was on the ground, the bull started worrying at him with his horns.  It's a damn miracle the bullfighters managed to get Bill out alive."
He'd learned the hard way that there was nothing to be gained by jerking on the reins or shouting.  It only made the horse run faster and increased the risk to the rider.  An experienced horseman knew it was better to ride the horse until the horse calmed down somewhat and then concentrate on gently getting the horse to stop so that they could be redirected to the desired behavior.  Or, in this case, anticipate Donovan's arguments and preempt them by systematically laying out all of the reasons why John could not be the culprit and provide substantiated arguments as to who the real criminal was.  He'd spent the night re-reviewing the mess of data he'd copied from John's computer in an effort to explain the confusing muddle of innocent and incriminating documents and search history John's files contained, but so far, his efforts had been in vain.
"No," Sterndale replied immediately.  "I know of no plants that do that, at least not to the extent that you just described."  His gaze slid sideways to John, whose jaw was tightening ominously, obviously prepared to interrupt.  "Well, that is not strictly accurate," Sterndale corrected himself grudgingly with another sideways glare at John.  "It is true that there are some plants out there that can affect a horse's behavior, but in most cases, symptoms appear rapidly and the horse will die just a few hours of consumption."
Mrs. Hudson pursed her lips and spared a brief thought for her neighbors as she pushed her sleeves up, preparing to do battle.  She'd have to remember to pick up some more caster sugar and make biscuits for the tenants on either side to apologize for the noise.
before that's as...fascinating as you are."
"If you are inclined to feel sympathy for anybody, it should be me," Sherlock replied tartly.  "It was most inconsiderate of her; she utterly destroyed the colony of
"Who were you talking to?" Edith asked as she and Alice rounded the corner.
related then her testimony might prove vital to solving this bloody case, but you showing off and intimidating the witness is
"Mmmmm, boring." Sherlock announced dismissively as the screen finally resolved to show the search results.  Sherlock frowned.  There were thousands of clips available using the keywords 'barrel racer' and 'abuse,' each with a more sensationalized title and atrocious punctuation than the last.  He hissed in irritation.  Clearly it was going to take some time to locate the specific video in question.
"Pfft.  You're exaggerating," Alice laughed, checking to make sure the ramp for one of the trailers was firmly latched.
Donovan, meanwhile, continued to click her way through various websites and email messages in what was evidently an established morning routine.  Her expression switched between resigned, annoyed, and indifferent as she read.  Every so often, she'd pause long enough to take a sip from the coffee cup she still held in a death-grip in her right hand.  After approximately ten minutes, she pushed herself away from the keyboard and spun her chair to face Sherlock.  "Right," Donovan began without preamble, "now that I'm more-or-less awake—" she glanced sideways at the twenty-four hour, military-style clock mounted on the wall, "—what's this about me needing to add Sterndale to my pool of suspects?"
"Who found the body, and at what time?"
"Unlikely," Sherlock said dryly, raising and lowering both eyebrows, "considering winning is an abstract human construct outside of survival context.  Was Cream Soda particularly barn-sour, apprehensive about being placed in a unfamiliar stall, or difficult to lead?"
“Speed, strength, aggression...really just anything that’ll make a bull harder to ride.  There are whole databases that breeders comb through, trying to put together the perfect animal.”
"Come on," John hissed.  "Open your eyes, Billy.  We've got to go," he added, making Sherlock abruptly revise his prior estimation of John's intelligence.
"It is."
John pursed his lips and hummed.  "Sure...um...are you a sweet, sour or savory sort?"
John pursed his lips as he tried to decide how to frame his observations.  “It’s hard to describe, exactly...steers generally aren’t cooperative at the best of times but...something’s off.  Call it a gut feeling,” John said finally.  He reached up and removed his hat so he could run a frustrated hand through his hair.  “They’re steers, not bulls, so they aren’t as naturally aggressive, just ornery...but take a look at their tails and the way they’re turning their bodies...”
"The way breeders did by introducing Brahman bulls and Brahman crossbreeds to rodeos?"
had a police horse and a barrel racer’s mare been targeted after the fact?  What purpose did it accomplish except to draw attention?  And by whom?  There’d been no sign of Sterndale at either of the other events.
In his mind, John was stretched out the bed beside him, wearing nothing but a pair of those damnable jeans that exactly matched the blue of his eyes and highlighted the shape of his magnificent arse.  He was braced on his elbows, the pose emphasizing the strong planes of his chest and the musculature curves of his biceps and deltoids to Sherlock's appreciative gaze.  The moonlight falling through the window turned John's gold fringe to silver and painted shadows across his strong frame that gleamed faintly in the semi-darkness; hidden places just waiting to be explored by Sherlock's lips and fingers and tongue.
With a smile that he hoped looked natural, Sherlock did so.  It would take anywhere from fifteen to thirty minutes for the Rohypnol to take effect he calculated and he didn't want John to be suspicious in the meantime.
John paused, brow furrowed until he translated Sherlock's statement to mean the display of dreamcatchers and silver and turquoise jewelry he'd spotted on his way to the men's room.  "Sorry," John said to the annoyed looking gas station attendant.  He set the coffees and pastries down on the counter.  "I'll be back in a tic."
"I asked if wanted to pick a night when I get back, or if there was a day you knew would work," John repeated patiently.
"The mare broke the tie rope," Sherlock said slowly, "she also tried to rear, based on the scuffing.  That's...unusual.  And dangerous."  He tilted his head and flipped back to the image of the mare lying on her side.  "Hmm…"
"It's a statue of a giant mustang that stands outside of the Denver Airport," Mr. Tregennis explained.  "So named for its blue color and glowing red eyes.  We saw it on a vacation some years ago."
The fifth bulldogger’s horse was so excited it broke through the barrier before the steer had even been released.  The rider had to turn his sharply to get it to return to the starting box.  Ironically, the horse was then slow to start when the steer’s pen opened.  The bulldogger’s ending time put him in the bottom place.
“So…what transpired?” Sherlock pressed when no further information seemed to be forthcoming.
"Yes, I know," Mike said with a huff of laughter at Sherlock’s disgusted expression.  "It tastes awful, but it will help you feel better that much faster.  I can try mixing a packet in a bottle of diluted apple juice or strawberry kool aid if that would help.  It’s a trick riders sometimes use to get a reluctant horse to drink."
"Be my guest!" John drawled, stretching indolently across the bed and punctuating his statement with a cocky wink and a wicked grin.
"Because Straker had a flair for spotting sleepers—ordinary bulls with the potential to become rankers.  It was downright uncanny how he managed to horn in on the biggest upsets of a season."
"It's fine.  I've got him," Sherlock replied, taking a firmer stance.  "Do continue."
"Sure thing," the barista replied before ringing everything up and reading off the total sum.
Sherlock huffed, but complied.  Having Mrs. Hudson as his landlady had taught him the perils of ignoring That Look.  He stood up, meticulously straightening his suit jacket, but leaving the center button of his jacket undone to prevent creases, before moving around the desk with studied nonchalance.
"Don't mock me, John."
Undeterred, John turned his attention to Sherlock's neck, interspersing nuzzles with little nips and licks at Sherlock's skin, unashamedly tasting him and almost certainly leaving faint marks on Sherlock's throat like the blush of a sunrise on snow.  "You smell so good," John muttered against the soft skin just behind the hinge of Sherlock's jaw as Sherlock's lungs drew breath after a shuddering breath.  "I could spend hours here, just breathing you in."
...only to be rewarded with a smacked hand and a garbled “-uk off.  ‘Mm sleepin’!”
"That's hardly a crime," Sherlock observed.  "What about his trailer?  Did you investigate it for evidence of possible foul play?"
Sherlock's eyes narrowed in annoyance.  He seldom bothered to masturbate; it was messy, distracting and the resultant rush of serotonin, oxytocin, vasopressin and prolactin reminded him unpleasantly of his ultimately disastrous relationship with Victor.  When he did masturbate to ensure his prostate's continued health, he preferred to keep his movements perfunctory, getting the entire tedious process over with as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, this was clearly not going to be a situation where he could ignore his penis into quiescence.
Sherlock froze, blinking rapidly as he processed John's statement.  Did John mean for that to come out the way it had sounded?  Admittedly, he'd noticed John's unmistakable signals of sexual attraction and jealousy; he would have to be blind not to observe them...but he'd also observed that John flirted with—or at—every female in his proximity.  John had walked by dozens of conventionally—and not so conventionally—attractive women on his way to Sherlock's table.  Their sybaritic gazes had made no secret of their appreciation for John's denim-clad derriere as they watched him saunter past.  Was Mycroft right?  Was John's statement a ploy, like his mental copy of his brother suggested?  Was Sherlock allowing sentimental and sexual desire to cloud his judgement?  Or was John's interest genuine?  Was he even capable of making that determination?  He'd told Molly that he and John were friends...but he'd once made the mistake of believing that Sebastian Wilkes's offer of friendship had been sincere.  He'd learned the hard way that the other man's sole motivation had been cribbing off of Sherlock's papers during Uni and (unsuccessfully) passing them off as his own.  And that didn't even begin to touch on the Waterloo of his failed relationship with Victor.
"Billy Scott, that's
"Glue?"
“Harry Houdini, John.  You should study him.  Or if you want somebody more current, Tisha UnArmed.”
"Christmas?" John asked, tilting his head to one side.
Stamford’s smirk at their reactions was subtle, but unmistakable.  "My shift ends at six," he informed them, sounding quite pleased with himself.  "I’ll call and check in with you, John, before I leave.  As for you," Stamford continued, turning back to Sherlock and holding up a warming finger, "fluids, more fluids.  Save the tight leather for evening wear and try to eat something other than sugar for dinner tonight, okay?"
"Excellent,"  Mike said happily as he handed him his boots.  "There’s a bathroom just around the corner.
"Captain America.  You know...six foot two, really strong...running around with other superheroes, saving lives and fighting bad guys?"
Sherlock blinked, before recalling the short-lived white streaks he'd observed earlier.
“What, specifically, are the breeders looking for?”
"Shut it Holmes," Donovan ordered in an undertone replete with menace.  "This is your last warning.  I'm in charge of this case, not you, and this has gone on long enough.  Mr. Tregennis, Officer Gregory, I apologize for the conduct of my colleague," Donovan continued, raising her voice to address the other adults.  Her tone switched from 'threat' to 'supplicating' with a speed and skill that Sherlock couldn't help but grudgingly admire.  "The case we're investigating has us all stressed, but that's no excuse for Mr. Holmes making your daughter cry, Mr. Tregennis, or his unprofessional conduct."
"No problem.  What can I get you to drink?
"Hey Keshawn, how's it hanging?" John returned with a smile or the man who was clearly guarding the door.
"Mmm...maybe four ideas," Sherlock revised, shifting to keep a better eye on the stallion.  "Ask your client if Colonel is fed by weight or not."
"Right.  What should I do if they arrive before you get back?"
"The Melba Toastya case," Sherlock repeated.  "It was a suspicious equine death that happened in South Africa in 1986."  Donovan shook her head and Sherlock rolled his eyes.  "Melba Toastya was a champion South African-bred Thoroughbred, conservatively insured for ten million pound sterling, or fifteen million, two hundred twenty-eight thousand, two hundred eighty-six dollars," Sherlock informed her bruskly.  "He had already won the L'Ormarins Queen's Plate and the Tsogo Sun Spirit, and was the favorite slated to win the Durban July Handicap, the largest and most prestigious race on the African continent.  It's an annual event.  Betting can run into the hundreds of millions of South African rands.  The winning purse for that particular race was five hundred thousand rand." Sherlock glanced upward, performing a few quick calculations.  "Converted to American currency, that would have been approximately two hundred eighteen thousand, three hundred forty dollars in 1986.  Adjusted for inflation, that would be the modern day equivalent of a four hundred seventy four thousand, six hundred eighty-eight dollars and ninety-four cents prize purse, give or take several hundred dollars, depending on the exchange rate and inflation calculator used.  The current prize is considerably larger."
"No," Doctor Sterndale said bluntly, tilting his head and giving John a surprisingly intent look.  "Why do you ask?"
"—which would have resulted in a second-place placement for that particular competition, had her run not been disqualified due to your inability to maintain your seat."  Sherlock added mercilessly, ignoring Brenda's attempt at a protest.  "Rider size and weight are additional factors.  The racing industry utilizes the 'Weight for Age' or WFA scale to ensure that horses are not given unfair advantages or handicaps when racing by setting weight standards for jockeys and tack, but barrel racers are exempt from this practice.  You are much smaller than your mother was; the difference in weight on Cream Soda's back is appreciable and no doubt contributed to your success, since the lighter the rider the faster a horse can run.  Unfortunately, you have recently experienced a growth spurt.  Your increased mass, combined with Cream Soda's advancing age was beginning to become a problem.  You likely pressured your father for a new horse, but he refused.  Money troubles perhaps?  I'm given to understand that the ongoing drought has hit ranchers in the region hard.  Or perhaps he didn't see the need.  Your mother was the barrel racer, not him."
Fortunately, a waitress chose that moment to walk by.
"Jumentous?" John asked curiously as he raised the cup to his lips.  "Is that some sort of fancy wine connoisseur term you learned for oak-aged or acetic?"
"This is Nat Tsedaa'.  She's the foreman of the Triple C.  I'll leave you in her capable hands.  I want a report about your initial impressions regarding Blaze on my desk by 5:00 p.m., tomorrow."  Without bothering to give Sherlock a chance to respond, Candii left, heading back to the house.
"Indeed, my older brother does tend to drone on, doesn't he?" Sherlock retorted snidely.  Not that there was any chance of Mycroft lowering himself to sentimental, romantic entanglements; his brother was an avowed bachelor, despite the wedding ring he wore.  Still the look of disgust on Candii Ross's face was worth the jibe.
Sherlock felt his hackles rise at the women's casual discussion of John's sexual prowess.  Did they think John's only value lay in his genitals?  Did they not appreciate the veterinarian's beautiful, cornflower blue eyes or the way the sun turned his hair gold?  Were they so quick to pursue meaningless orgasms that they completely ignored John's steady nature and his unexpectedly wry sense of humor?  Some of his resentment must have shown on his face, because Molly stepped up beside him and laid a consolatory hand on his arm.
"Men?  Plural?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock froze in the act of reaching for his cup of tea, to shoot his brother an incredulous look  "What?  Rabies?  Under what reasoning?"
"Indeed."
"Because sometimes the animal would only be a real firebrand for one or two rides.  It was real inconsistent; not like some of the bulls that breeder Sterndale's produced."
"I am coming, I am coming," Doctor Sterndale announced unnecessarily as he came down the hallway and stepped into the light.  His voice was surprisingly deep and carried the faint, but unmistakable lilt of a native Afrikaans speaker.
"The face my brother does when he's figured something out.  Or when somebody drives by in a restored classic Bentley from the fifties.  The one that most people get when they've just had an orgasm.  Spill," Donovan ordered.
his pool cue, Sherlock thought firmly, in an effort to quell the salacious bent of his subconscious.  With effort, he dragged his focus back to the game.  "Nine ball, left kitchen corner pocket," Sherlock called out.  He took his shot.
With a soft grunt, John shifted and draped his muscular frame across Sherlock's legs, making Sherlock groan in pleasure at the weight.  John's body was satisfyingly heavy; he could feel it pushing him down into the bed, pinning him in place.  The pressure made him feel safe and sheltered, like one of Mrs. Hudson's good, thick quilts on a cold day or Redbeard's comforting weight on his bed during a thunderstorm when he was a small child.
“What are you thinking about?  The case?” John asked, his blue eyes warm with affection and the underlying hint of arousal as he gazed at the brunet sitting on the bar stool beside him.  Sherlock didn’t respond immediately but that was nothing new.  The genius did have a tendency to get lost inside his own head.  John smiled in patient amusement: Sherlock would respond when he was ready.
"Yes," Sherlock said shortly.  "Texas might be a more open-minded state"—John snorted at that, but didn't otherwise interrupt—"but I grew up in a rural area.  I was surrounded by ranchers with very set views on how boys and men should behave and dress.  There were dire consequences for those that didn't...blend in."  Not specifically true, but close enough.  England was notably ahead of the its former colony when it came to equality, but even it had prosecuted Alan Turing and Oscar Wilde for 'gross indecency'.  "The fact that I preferred to observe horses to learn their body language, study natural horsemanship and generally treat my animals with gentleness and respect instead of using a lasso or a whip indiscriminately led to more than a few...confrontations."  True, but they weren't exactly the types of confrontations John was probably assuming.  Sherlock's familiarity with normal horse body language meant that spotting subtle doping tells and behavioral issues was elementary, and quite often led to insults, tears, screaming, chases, fights and court hearings when he unmasked the culprits.  "Some idiots thought that my preference for relying on my mind, rather than brute strength made me a 'sissy,'" Sherlock concluded, with a subdued shrug.  The gender-based pejorative was fairly mild compared to some of the names he'd had hurled his direction, but it was sufficient for explanation purposes.
"I'll...uh, let you get back to it then," John said, shifting self-consciously from side to side.  "I don't want to monopolize your date."
Donovan shrugged, exchanging looks with Lestrade again.  "And you?  Any theories you care to share?"
"No," Sherlock shot back, with equal scorn as he returned his phone to his jacket pocket.  "It's supposed to widen your pool of suspects."
Sherlock gritted his teeth, making a mental note to investigate Johan Straker thoroughly once he had a secure internet connection.  Love and lust were ridiculously pedestrian, yet surprisingly vicious motivators for a host of reprehensible human behaviors.
short denim cutoffs and a plaid shirt tied up just underneath her ample breasts reached out and gave John's arse a mischievous smack.  Rather than be offended, John tilted his head back and laughed and then returned the favour.  The brunette squealed and leaned forward, whispering something in John's ear, her long, curly hair just brushing John's chest.  John shook his head and mimed drinking something, jerking his thumb in the direction of the bar.  The brunette's shoulders slumped in obvious disappointment but another comment from John had her grinning.  She gave him a playful kiss on the cheek and then turned away, hips swaying to the beat of the music while John watched with an appreciative smirk stamped on his handsome features.
"Nope," Sherlock replied, popping the ‘p’.
"Chomsky?" Sherlock asked, hazarding a guess.
“Dad?” James asked, addressing Sherlock this time.
"What about you?" Sherlock asked after a few moments of easy silence.  He turned his head to see John still watching him with a fond expression.
"I prefer to text," Sherlock replied, standing up and sliding the card into his wallet.  "But I will.  Coming, Captain?"  Ignoring the sour look Donovan aimed at his back, Sherlock hurried down the hallway.  Behind him, he heard Lestrade say his goodbyes before scrambling to catch up.
He did, tucking the unlit Marlboro between his lips for safekeeping before beginning to pat his pockets in a hunt for his lighter.  Even Maslow would agree that nicotine outranked seat belts.  "Do you have a match, or perhaps a spare Bic?" Sherlock mumbled around the cigarette clenched between his teeth.  "I seem to have misplaced my Zippo…Nevermind.  I found it."  Pulling it free, Sherlock flicked the wheel with his thumb, huffing in annoyance when it took him three tries before he managed to get it a steady flame.
Sherlock rubbed his forefinger across his bottom lip, absorbing Molly's words.  "In what way?"
"That's not the word I'd use for it," Candii snapped.
"All right, all right," Sherlock interrupted abruptly, raising his hands in a conciliatory gesture before the two men could come to blows.  John and Sterndale both started, clearly having forgotten his presence.  "Let's just calm down," Sherlock continued, giving each veterinarian a pacifying smile.  "Mistakes happen, yes?"
"Are you between deployments or reserve?" Sherlock asked, partially out of curiosity, partly to distract himself from the throbbing bursts of pain in his wrist caused by the vehicle's jostling over the bumpy pavement.
"Quit trying to distract me, young man," Mrs. Hudson snapped, easily shoving past him and into the kitchen.  She froze, taking in the sight that greeted her.  Sherlock had driven multiple hooks into the ceiling and cabinets, creating a crisscrossing mess of wires and clothesline over the stove.  On the burner an oversized and vaguely familiar looking pot was bubbling merrily.  It was evidently the source of the smell if the clouds of rank steam were any indication.  Suspended from the mess by several large clamps was a pair of size 11 cowboy boots.
John had made an offhand comment about the rodeo circuit being close-knit enough that most of the regulars knew each other by sight, if not by name.  It was also a well-established gospel that the speed of light had nothing on the speed of the information grapevine.  By now, the gossip about how the famous Leon Sternsdale had been fired from his lucrative position as the Triple C’s veterinarian and replaced by locum veterinarian John Watson had probably spread far and wide.  It was also likely common knowledge that Candii Ross had hired speciality trainer Billy Scott to work with one of the Triple C’s rising stars.
"Urine output colour?"
John leaned over him casting a shadow until Sherlock’s wordless growl warned him to step back.  “I’m assuming this is somehow related to the case?"  When Sherlock didn't bother to answer, John tried again.  "Seriously, Billy.  What are you expecting to find in a maintenance closet that justifies some light B&E?”
Taking his cue, Sherlock leaned against the opposite wall, arms and ankles both crossed as he waited.  Bored, he examined what he could see of his his environment from his vantage point.  More empty offices lay on either side of him, the insides obscured by blinds and darkened lights.  The end of the hallway, however, ended an enormous open work area, and was far more promising.
On the upside—for today's session, at least—he could report that Candii Ross that her prize stallion had consistently responded to Sherlock's desensitization methods by attempting to flee, rather than attacking.
as he tried to put his jumbled thoughts into words.  "I...never expected to attract the attention of somebody as perfect as you.  I'm not even sure it's real and not faked," he mumbled.
"TGRA...Texas Gay Rodeo Association?" Sherlock posited aloud.
A few moments later, his phone chimed with a return image of the rich, Art Deco interior of the P.G.C. Hajenius.  Sherlock glared, feeling a surge of envy that his brother was enjoying the culture and beauty of Amsterdam, while Sherlock was exiled to Texas.  P.G.C. Hajenius was arguably one of the best tobacconists in the world.  The shop contained a variety of pipes, several hundred different brands of tobacco and a fascinating museum of snuff boxes and other tobacco-related paraphernalia.  He'd long been interested in visiting, but had yet to find the time.  It galled him that Mycroft was almost certainly savoring the rich tastes of Honduran, Nicaraguan and Cuban tobacco while Sherlock was making do with the somewhat stale Marlboros he could purchase in local petrol stations.
"Read through that; get yourself acquainted with the facts.  I want to know what you think," Donovan continued in a more normal voice.  "I did a bit of digging while I was waiting for Officer Gregory to get back with me.  I managed to get my hands on a copy of the roster.  Watson's name isn't on the list and according to his boss, Doctor Sawyer, he was scheduled to be at a 4H event that day in another state.  Unless he's working as a vet under an assumed name or something, it's probably pretty safe to assume he didn't have anything to do with the mare freaking out.  As odd as I still think it is how fast he got Devil's Blaze sedated, he may have just be damn good at what he does, the way Greg mentioned."
The so-called peaceful countryside was surprisingly noisy; far noisier than London seemed to be.  The clicks and rasps of a multitude of insects filled the air, punctuated with the odd howl or screech from some other animal.  Breathing deeply, Sherlock sat down on the porch steps and looked up at the sky.
John licked his lips, then looked away, slightly shamefaced, before meeting Sherlock's eyes.  "Er...well, because of the pills."
"Yes?"  John gave Sherlock puzzled expression.  "Don't tell me they don't have iced tea up north?"
"Enough that nature starts calling you, at the minimum," Mike said cheerfully as he handed Sherlock another bottle.  "So down the hatch!"
Lowering his head, John wrapped his lips around Sherlock's right nipple and began gently worrying it with his teeth and tongue, adding just a hint of pain to the overwhelming pleasure.
Sherlock shook his head.  The last thing he wanted to do was compromise the functioning of his brain with alcohol.  "I'll have tea.  Please," he added as an afterthought.
"You're welcome."  John slid into the driver's seat and pulled the shoulder harness across his chest.  "Do you…" he gestured ineffectively, "need help with your belt?"  At Sherlock's nod, John braced himself against the seat and leaned over to grab the shoulder harness.  Sherlock could feel the warmth of John's body; the vet radiated heat like a personal furnace.  Up close, John smelled even better. Sherlock took a covert sniff, enjoying John's scent of clean sweat, spice and sun-warmed cotton.
Donovan tipped her head to one side, acknowledging Brenda's point.  "That makes sense.  Can you tell me what the reporter looked like?"  Donovan asked, pulling a pad of paper closer and uncapping her pen.  "A description might make it easier to track her down."
"If Sterndale's tax returns or bank records show substantial 'gifts,' it could be a strong indicator of his guilt. Likewise, if Candii Ross is replaced as a stock contractor to the PRCA, you should investigate her replacement and see if they have close ties to Sterndale."
"Hello," Sherlock offered, once again dropping his voice back to his character's soft Northern lilt.  He offered a hand to the ranch foreman.  "Billy Scott, pleasure to meet you."
"It's for my protection."
regret it."
.  Turning it rightside up, Sherlock punched in Molly's mobile number from memory.  It rang for several moments before Molly picked up.
"Christ.  You.  Are.
"You...tried them yourself?" John predictably asked after a long moment, one sandy eyebrow creeping up almost to his hairline.
Sherlock gave them both what he hoped was a convincing smile and turned back around as his phone buzzed in his hand.
"William 'Billy' Scott," Sherlock replied, observing with interest that John was an overwriter.  He didn't contort his hand into the hooked writing position common among left-handed individuals.  Instead, he held the pen approximately an inch away from the nib and his wrist was straight, resulting in legible, unsmudged letters.  Clearly somebody had cared enough to teach him the proper way to hold his pen…
John froze, his mouth opening and closing several times, before he shook his head slowly. "That…was amazing."
Sherlock set the quarter-full mug aside and crossed one arm across his torso in a stretch, a small smile of satisfaction creasing his lips as he did so.  Fortunately, for the Work he didn't just see, he
"Bad news?"  Molly asked hesitantly, interrupting his chain of thought.
Sherlock realised with a mental wince.  He should have anticipated that reaction.  "Nonsense, John," he tried in an effort to let John save face.  "It's only fair, considering you drove and you wouldn't let me buy your petrol.  Aren't friends supposed to share resources?"
"Nonsense John," Sherlock scolded, deliberately turning to give John a sultry look over his shoulder.  He decided to include a bit of innuendo of his own.  "Bees don't prick...to prick implies to 'pierce slightly'.  I prefer the term 'impale'." Sherlock didn't miss the way that John's pupils dilated in response to his statement, or the disappointed sighs from the two women.
"Well there you have it."
Sherlock nodded in silent approval at the stallion's obedience.  It had taken weeks of work to get the stallion to accept Sherlock's touch, much less tolerate having a halter being applied and removed.  The next step was desensitization, not in the sense of making the stallion anything other than what he was—an impossible-to-ride mount—but rehabituating Blaze to the common noises, scents and random objects he might encounter at rodeos so he wouldn't panic and bolt if a plastic bag blew past or a truck backfired.  To the average idiot, it seemed counterintuitive to deliberately frighten a horse, but Sherlock knew that the more the trainer tried to frighten a horse using proper training techniques, the more bomb-proof a horse eventually became because they learned that tarps or bridges or screaming children were harmless and consequently something that could be safely ignored.  It was the same type of training that police horses, cavalry mounts, and carnival pony strings were subjected to.
Fortunately, the refreshingly competent Doctor Früh had indeed kept her promise about keeping him apprised of New Scotland Yard's prognosis.  The good news was that the gelding was slowly being weaned off the tranquilizers.  The bad news was that the standardized tests the gelding had been subjected to still hadn't resulted in anything conclusive, and—thanks to the slow growth rate of Appaloosa hair—it would also be several more weeks before the follicles of either Scotty's mane or tail produced strands of hair that were long enough for drug testing.
"And why is that?" Donovan asked suspiciously.  When Sherlock didn't immediately answer, Donovan narrowed her eyes.  "Coffee's all well and good, Holmes," she said, tapping the cup meaningfully, "but you're on this at my sufferance.  Either keep me informed, or you're out.  Are we clear?"
