“May I ask where you are going? There is much to discuss!”
John nodded. Sherlock swallowed and stood up.
Sherlock frowned. He did not like upsetting John, but how could he tell him the reason for his melancholy if John would not understand?
“Calm yourself!” John shouted, running over to subdue the creation when his target seemed to be set upon Sherlock who would be powerless to stop the onslaught of such anger. John threw his arms around the naked man’s body, locking his hold by gripping his own wrists to keep the arms from lashing out and causing any more harm to the lab, and most importantly, to Sherlock.
Sherlock hesitated but accepted that he would only make the situation worse by withholding the information from John.
John laughed at that and looked at Sebastian, who visibly shrank in his seat at the mention of marriage. “No, nothing of the sort Mrs. Hudson. His name is Sebastian and he is very dear to us. Is that not right, Sebastian?”
“However, I am worried for the younger Holmes. I have had the fortune of running into the man after the incident. With him was a man, Mr. Watson if I remember correctly.”
Sebastian gulped as he heard the shoes move across the wooden floor.
“Now then, let us see this surprise you are going on about.”
“Do you mean to tell me that he will wake tonight, should this experiment of yours work?”
“I demand you tell me exactly how I came to be….the origin of my story, Sherlock. You understand what I ask of you, yet you dodge my questions. Now you must answer.”
Thomas pointed the gun at the two of them again. His face hardened. “
Slowly, John continued to push inside, stopping periodically to let Sherlock adjust. The moment he was seated inside Sherlock, John grabbed at his thighs to pull up those long legs over his hips. He breathed out hard before beginning to work his hips in and out.
“I do not deserve your love, John.”
“Let us drop this subject for now. We still have a man downstairs that requires our aid and we mustn't keep him waiting a moment longer.”
Sherlock chuckled and took out the paper he bought on the way to the flat. “You grow smarter every day.”
“I wish you would not speak of him this way. He is a man, just as I am. He is not a tool to be used by Moriarty, just as I am not a tool to be used by you.”
Not even waiting to hear a response from John, Sherlock shot up and walked into the bathroom. He closed the door behind him and nearly sank to the ground. John was quite the romantic. He no doubt learned the skill from all the poetry that he read. Sherlock turned off the taps and began to remove his clothing. He lifted one leg up and tested the temperature of the water with a dip of his toe. Considering it warmed to his liking, Sherlock slid in with a sigh of relief. It was exactly what he needed to soothe his aching limbs. He ignored the bruises littered all over his body and closed his eyes, lying back.
Welcome back to all previous readers, hello to the new ones and without further ado
It is not dull, like a bruise, nor tight like the injuries he sometimes get from rugby. It is raw, burning and breathtaking. The thin cane slapped his exposed skin with impeccable precision and if Mr. Stokes is treating him gently he does not even want to think about the pain produced on the sensitive areas.
A second later and he is rushing over the lawn with
“What now?” Sebastian turns the engine off and his voice replaces rumble of the machine with surprisingly similarity. “Forgot your beads?”
“Because of… things.” A flash of insecurity crosses the teen’s face and, suddenly feeling more confident, John smiles encouragingly.
He reaches the school, with its dark eyes staring at him, abandoned and forgotten until Monday arrives and it once again will come to life, and walks past it. Mr. Stokes' address is still in his pocket and if John concentrates on it he can feel the paper move with every step. The teacher can help with much, from reaction pathways to the conductivity of metals, but not with this. In this, the teacher is, just like everyone else, the enemy. One of those who will tear his and Sherlock's love apart.
John glances up at Sebastian's sharp face to see how he takes the reminder. Some people take a gentle reminder to be equivalent to being called stupid, something John with his top grades and benevolence knows only too well, but Sebastian does not seem to care where he drags his feet around the street corner. The teenager nods and they fall back into the state of silence only interrupted by the tapping of feet against the cobblestone. The rhythmic sound echoes in John's head and his own shoes become the sole focus of his attention until they round yet another corner and a realisation begins to grown inside his head.
,” Sherlock murmurs into the kiss as his hand protectively cups the backside of John's head. "
He cannot look Mr. Stokes in the eyes when the man returns to the desk and sits on top of it. He knows that he is blushing, still ashamed, still humiliated.
Sherlock lowers his gaze and slowly nods with the tip of his tongue flicking out to taste the remains of the peck they shared.
It is meant as a joke, to lighten the mood, but neither John nor the man laughs.
John sees his note disappear into a pocket of the leather jacket and his hand closes in a desperate but silent wish to take it back. Somehow, the Greaser’s muscles are defined even underneath the bulky jacket and once the teen straightens up to his full height and towers above John he is sure that even Sherlock would feel short in comparison.
A small smile decorates John's lips as he bows his head slightly, just enough to tuck it in under Sherlock's chin, and he exhales a single word with a soft and happy sigh.
John never thought a man would leave him heartbroken, but he feels tears burn behind his eyelids. He has to stay strong or Sebastian will know. A boy does not cry over another boy.
“The interpretation of the Bible varies and changes and as I understand it, you base your faith on the interpretation of somebody else’s. You are free to make your own interpretation and no one can ever claim his or her faith to be more valid than yours. There is just one thing I would like you to take into consideration, my golden boy.” Sherlock’s fingers stop on John’s lips where they draw a broken breath from him. “Would the god who made it possible for your body to tingle like this really punish you for savouring the feeling?”
It is still in his possession, still hidden in his wardrobe. He loves the scent and how heavy it feels over his shoulders, as if Sherlock's arm never leaves him, but he is already balancing on the edge and a single puff of air would be enough for him to tip over and fall back into being grounded. Luckily, being good allows him to be bad.
“There is nothing preventing you from doing both,” Sherlock says sagely and guides John's head down onto his muscular shoulder. “I, on the contrary, came here to cuddle, and it would be most rude of you to deny me that. Now eat your lunch, John. I would hate to see you go hungry.”
“And there seems to be little I can do to convince you otherwise. As I told you yesterday,” the teacher takes a step closer and places a, what could have been protective, hand on John's shoulder. “I am here to help. You have my address. As for what this Sherlock wants,” the hand is lifted off his shoulder and Mr. Stokes reaches for his briefcase. “You are a good boy, John. I can tell. Do not let him drag you into any mischief.”
He does not want his stomach to tingle and squirm, filled with hundreds and hundreds of colourful butterflies, every time his sense of smell is overwhelmed by the scent of Sherlock Holmes. He does not want to be able to tell Sherlock apart from the rest of the Greasers at school, as if the teen were special. He never meant to get so accustomed to Sherlock sneaking up behind him and petting his hair that he now easily distinguishes the scent of after shave which hides underneath the smell of cigarette smoke and is so vague that he doubts anyone else notices.
John sighs. He can not say no to Molly's thrilled face. “Sure, Molly.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes at John’s obvious attempt to move the conversation from what adjectives Sherlock prefers in connection to his backside, but lets himself be distracted nonetheless.
“J...aw…”
“Constantly.”
Thomas took a step back, as the stench of the hungover man’s breath overpowered his sense of smell.
“I’ve not done much of that, have I?”
When Sherlock returned to the moment, he ignored John’s inquiry of his well being and darted to the window, bringing it closed with a bang.
John patted Sebastian’s head. “And you will not miss Baker Street?”
“A thousand pardons, Sherlock.”
Sherlock did not miss the way Sebastian tugged at his sleeve. He was hiding marks, it was the same thing Sherlock used to do when he was a child. Surely Moriarty would not be so barbarous as to lay hands on Sebastian.
Sherlock could not go through with this alone. He needed John to be there with him. He grabbed both of John’s hands and stared directly into his steely eyes.
“I am John,” He put a hand to his own chest and repeated, “John.” Then he extended his hand behind him to gesture at Sherlock, “He is Sherlock. Sherlock.” Though introductions had already been made, he thought it best to repeat them once again now that the creature was in a much more relaxed state. “Sherlock means you no harm,” John added, trying to add appropriate gestures but not getting them quite right.
Sherlock laughed. He troubled himself with pointless thoughts. John was enamoured by the fire, that was his reason. Sherlock noticed the way John could barely keep his eyes off of the flames. Sherlock hoped that he would not hurt himself due to curiosity. He tried to push the thoughts of John being engulfed in the flames from being too close, or from a flammable object finding its way into the fireplace. He tossed and he turned but he could not relieve himself of the horrifying scenes that played in his mind. He had to return to John, he would not be able to sleep if he did, but John’s safety was his first priority. He flung the covers off of his body and flew to the living area. John was sat in front of the fireplace still, he did not stir even when Sherlock was standing a mere two feet away from him. Sherlock’s hands fumbled as he stared at the man below him. He felt guilty for what he was about to do.
“I find them interesting, and part of me thinks that, for events such as this, I will be able to help you. You will not need to send for any doctor as long as I am here, Sherlock.”
“I... I must be off now. I am so very sorry John, what I would not give to remain here with you and Sherlock, what I would not sacrifice to be back at Baker Street, basking in the quiet and the heat from the fire as we sit and chat. Or to watch you, Sherlock, work on your experiments or listen to you play again. But I cannot, I simply cannot.”
“Ah. Might I ask how this came about?”
“John, I am terribly sorry. I cannot bring myself to do this!”
(See the end of the chapter for
The ride to the location seemed longer than it actually was. All he could think of was John. Was he alright? What if they had killed him? How would he react to the sight of John’s corpse sprawled against the wet tiles of the bathhouse? Sherlock wished he had never imagined such grisly things. The carriage stopped, signalling their arrival. He rushed out of the coach and into the bathhouse. It was the one that Mycroft used to frequent when he needed to relax. He wanted Sherlock to join him on one occasion, but Sherlock turned him down and said that he did not find the thought of being trapped in a room with sweaty men his idea of a good time. Mycroft scoffed and muttered, “How would you know?” underneath his breath before he left.
Sherlock rolled over to find the sky a somber grey. This was the fourth consecutive day . The rows of buildings and flats within his view were blurred by the raindrops that had found their homes on his window. He watched as the they landed on the glass, sliding down ever so gently, absorbing and dividing. He had slept in again, a habit developed over the past two weeks, even prior to Mycroft’s funeral. He wondered what his brother would say regarding the foul weather.
“It fascinates me how a waterfall looks so gentle, so serene and so tranquil, yet should you get too close...I believe you know how it ends.”
Thomas watched as the two walked away, only moving after they were out of his field of vision. He walked into the station, which was busy to say the least, coppers running to and fro, doing their jobs. He scanned the area to find an officer that was not buried in paperwork of some kind or bringing in one of the various vagrants of London. His eyes landed on a man of silver hair, seated behind a desk. He was not only an officer, but one of higher-ranking. Thomas approached the man reading the inscription on the nameplate. He cleared his throat and spoke, “Inspector Lestrade?”
“So then why do you feel so reluctant?”
Thomas frowned. He made acquaintances with Sally and Anderson five years ago because his friend told him that they were useful for gathering information, even if they were a bit sloppy in manners. He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“The light from the fire does wonders to your appearance.”
“Tell our dear friend John how Scotland Yard came to the truth.”
He picked up the inebriated man and handcuffed him.
Sherlock was not imagining it, John’s cheeks were in fact crimson. He could scarcely believe it. John was blushing. What for? Sherlock had only wiped the excess food from his mouth, he had no reason to be bashful. Yet again, wasn’t Sherlock also the fool for stumbling upon himself whenever John was in the vicinity? John did not know what he was feeling, he had probably blushed at every item in the flat already, Sherlock concluded. He had the mindset of a child so had every right to be shy when Sherlock cleaned him up. Did John blush when Sherlock bathed him that first night? Did John grin like an idiot whenever Sherlock stalked about the flat?
Sherlock smiled and sat at the very edge of the bed. Without words, he bent down and kissed John, and to his delight, it was John that deepened the kiss. When they finally parted, John’s hand was now covering the one Sherlock had resting on his bare chest. Even in such poor lighting, John could always reduce Sherlock to nothing with a simple grin. He would have surely died if he did not have John’s face to remind him why staying was worth it.
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak but John had already predicted what he was going to say.
“I’ve watched you, from the living area, on some nights.”
“It is truly me, I promise. John had thought the same.”
He tossed the paper to the side of the door and took his coat off to hang on the rack before he joined John at the table. They shared a kiss before Sherlock took his seat adjacent and looked down at the food that John had cooked for him.
Sherlock’s lips curled into a smile at the sight of John. He placed a hand on John’s cheek and caressed it.
“We will go and we will begin anew.”
John looked down at his attire and looked back up at Sherlock.
“Hush, please, return to sleep. I apologize for waking you. I shall be downstairs when you are up.”
Sherlock pondered in his mind as he watched the blond sleep, mouth hung open slightly and the soft, almost quiet snores leaving his lips. His hand moved from John’s arm and rested on his face. He had done a good job, quite a good job.
He was not ready to stare into those beautiful eyes. John had given him no warning when he lifted his face. He felt John’s lips on his own, and it was heavenly. He melted into the kiss that John graced him with and found that he had been craving it. John pulled away from Sherlock and pushed him onto the couch. Before he could voice his objections, John was already down to his waistcoat and on top of Sherlock. He peppered kisses all over Sherlock’s long, slender neck. Sherlock tried to push him away. This was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
He finished with the arm and marveled at the sight in front of him. His eyes wandered from the scar to the legs. Sherlock did not realize until now that the man he took the legs from was no more than five feet and some inches. He wanted to be upset with himself for making such silly mistake, but he could not bring himself to do it. His hand splayed across the torso of his companion. The abdomen was not as trim and lean as Sherlock’s own was, which was rightly so as Sherlock maintained his shape in the poorest of manners. Sherlock’s hand squeezed the pudge of flesh that was the gut. His gaze trailed down to the lower part of the man’s body. Sherlock always tried to ignore its presence, even whilst he pieced the body together, he did not stare for long. His companion was certainly well-endowed,  an observation that stirred up the slightest hint of envy. Sherlock fought the urge to touch the man’s penis to satisfy the ever-present curiosity he felt as he worked. Half of it was covered by pubic hair and Sherlock had half a mind to cut it off so that he may get the whole picture. He shook his head. Vulgar thoughts, such inappropriate thoughts he had.
“Precisely!”
Sherlock had half a mind to start a fight but he could not help the smile at the comment and finally, with the work of John’s rhythmic breathing, lulled himself to sleep.
He didn’t bother to wipe the tears away, there were too many at this point. He released a soft whimper.
Please, continue to kudos, comment, subscribe and share and thank you all once again for being such amazing readers! We hope you like the ending!
They both smiled at her.
“My companion is in need of a new suit.”
“I’ll come for the dish twenty minutes from now, the plate shall be spotless upon my return, do you understand?”
John crossed his arms and furrowed his brows.
“Death should not bring about feelings of hunger, Mrs. Hudson.”
The man nodded.
“Do you wish to become intimate with me?”
Thank you all for your patience! We are trying as hard as we can to update the chapters within a reasonable time.
“Causing a public disturbance that’s what! Need I explain more to you?”
“Alright. In that case, I should prepare dinner, and I believe this is the perfect time to see how well the boy does.”
She looked confused, then dejected.
“How very proud you make me to be your lover,” John whispered. When John’s hand lingered to Sherlock’s neck, those pale eyelids fluttered to reveal the blue eyes that made him shiver. John sucked in his breath at the sheer beauty that Sherlock possessed. How could anyone lay eyes on such a wonderful man and think to treat him with cruelty and malice? The thought was simply unfathomable.
He couldn’t find the voice to say those words. If John wanted to help him cook eggs, although he would have to teach the man because John had never cooked a thing in his short life. He nodded and handed John the eggs. The time they spent cooking did wonders for them. They smiled more than they might have ever done in their time together. Sherlock laughed and teased more than John had ever seen him. He seemed softer, like the icy walls he built around his heart were finally melting and that John could finally see the Sherlock that was hidden away. Sherlock has never seen John so eager, so affectionate, sure there were the times where John has expressed the need to be intimate with Sherlock, but today, in this moment, Sherlock could not get enough of the sweet kisses that John showered upon him while he concentrated on not burning the food. By the end of it, their meals were left nearly untouched on their plates, but it was alright because neither of them felt hungry anymore. Sherlock wasn’t sure when he stopped caring for the food, but maybe it had something to do with the way John smiled when he made his plate effortlessly, or the kiss that Sherlock received soon after. It was probably the way John whispered, “I love you” in his ear before they took their seats.
“How does it taste?”
There were sniffles amongst the women that hid their faces behind black veils. Sherlock wondered if those tears were true. He tucked his hat underneath his arm and made slow strides to the casket. He placed his hand on the top and gave a small smile, pulling the flower from his coat pocket - a white lily. He did not normally partake in religious practices but for Mycroft he would make the exception just this once. He placed it on the coffin before the men were able to lower it beyond his reach. His lips twisted into a bitter smile as he whispered, “Farewell, Mycroft.”
“I’m afraid not. My mind is elsewhere.”
“I’m sure that you know my reason for being down here, Mrs. Hudson.”
John stepped out of the carriage with Sebastian and Sherlock. It had seemed like an eternity since he had been at the Holmes Manor. He wondered if Mrs. Hudson ever thought about writing them again. She had to miss Sherlock, regardless of how bad the terms his departure were. She raised him, that was practically his mother. Sherlock held John’s hand firmly and John smiled, pressing a kiss to his cheek.
“It is alright, Sherlock, I can do this.”
John shot up from the couch and grabbed Sherlock’s carefully sculpted face in his hands. He kissed him again and again, and Sherlock resisted his urges each time he did.
“What is it?” He spat. He was in a hurry to get back to his flat.
“They claim they attacked the poor sod under the assumption that he was a lover of corpses.”
“When did I ever say such a thing? I’ve settled down on this side for a reason, my dear John.”
----------
“I must go back to the manor, John. Come with me or stay, I do not mind. Either way, this is something of the highest importance.”
John pondered this for a moment and set the cup of tea he held down.
“I expect the plate to be spotless, Sherlock. The others have told me that you’ve not eaten since your brother’s funeral.”
It took a while, but John’s eyes finally landed on Sherlock’s book, and without even looking up at the man, Sherlock could tell that he was interested.
He was completely mesmerized by how Sherlock squirmed and bucked at the movements of his fingers, that expression going slack to show nothing but pleasure.
“Tell me how it was done.” His voice was harsh, cold, nothing at all like the voice Sherlock was accustomed to.
John hopped out of the carriage, paid the driver and stood. It was not near the falls, though he could see it. If they made haste they would reach them in time. “Quickly, Sebastian!”
------
“Where exactly were you this morning? It is unlike you to be away from the flat this early, save for when you go to the shops, but you’ve returned with naught but the morning paper. What is the matter?”
She stared at him for a moment, trying to get a sense of what it was like in that funny little head of his no doubt. She sniffed and held her shawl tighter to her body. With a pat on Anderson’s chest she motioned for them to leave. She helped the man walk seeing as how he was just coming off of his intoxication, and needed proper rest. Several times Anderson looked back and each time Sally directed his face forward and they bickered some more. An odd relationship, Sherlock thought, but they seemed to care for each other. He himself started his walk back to Baker Street. John would be up by now and was probably wondering where Sherlock had gone.
“You were unexpected since your parents only planned on having the one. Your coming into the world was not as laborious as your brother’s. You were so tiny, so...fragile. Your mum worried that she would break you.” She paused and chuckled under her breath. “But how she loved you, Sherlock. She would refuse to leave you alone, even only for a moment. She moved your crib to her room because the thought of being away from her precious babe brought her great distress.”
“I will not drag him down with me. If we are to be free, I must go this alone. Moriarty is my enemy and mine alone. If I do not return by tomorrow...tell John he is to seek passage out of Switzerland, and quite possibly Europe if he must. I will not see any harm come to him or you.”
“Are you well, Sherlock?”
“We shall go for a walk tomorrow, if the weather is pleasant enough.”
Thomas held the gun up to face the sky as he listened to John speak. He smirked, and said, “There is a different air about you, John. Does it have something to do with me?”
“I wondered how I would alleviate myself of the pain, John, how I would be able to have my brother back or at least someone to care for and to care about me. These thoughts plagued my mind and it was to expel them from my head that I began to study death and rebirth. I thought it was evil that, of all the stories I have read as a child - Snow White, Sleeping Beauty - they were all sent to their eternal rest but at the very end were revived and given the chance to start anew. It angered me to think of the unfairness of it all. How was it that they were able to come back while my brother rotted beneath the earth? It pained me that I would never see him again and so I devised a plan to create life from death.”
Despite his surprise, John does not question Sherlock when the Greaser prods his wet lips. He relaxes his jaw and lets three fingers slide inside, tentatively exploring them with his tongue as Sherlock encourages him to. They taste of nicotine, a far less flattering taste than the smell, and John feels his face scrunch up despite himself. Sherlock's thumb, which is safe from John's sweeping tongue, guides his chin up and the moment their eyes meet electricity is shot straight into John's very core. He moans around Sherlock's digits, willingly opening himself up until he is choking and Sherlock withdraws his hand. They lower their gazes together, looking down at the three shiny digits with strings of saliva binding them together.
“James Moriarty,” the man offers as an explanation that fails to erase the confusion behind John’s glasses. “It is most pleasant to finally say goodbye to Brian Stokes, he was so dull with his caring, benevolent personality. Of course, Sherlock never trusted him. Did he enjoy my little message? Oh, I’m sure he did.”
The note still pressed in his slightly sweaty hand is all but erased from his mind when Sherlock beckons him forward.
Sebastian shrugs and looks down at him.
They all warned him about Sherlock Holmes. Mr. M, Mr. Stokes, even Sherlock himself made it quite clear that a new world of unimaginable danger would surround him with its greedy, sin-dripping claws if he continued down the path that the Greaser showed him. John knew but was unable to resist the temptation of heavenly pleasure.
The way to Biology is rarely intimidating and has not been dangerous since the time someone accidentally produced a thick gas with a suspicious smell of burnt rubber, but it not until Greg joins him on a bench in front of the locked classroom that John becomes suspicious. He glances at the Greaser from the corner of his eye with the growing conviction that Sherlock not so much placed Greg there to protect him as he wished to make sure that the leather jacket stays on. His fingers tug gently at the sleeves and his gaze returns to the odd sight of leather against his tanned skin. What looks natural on Sherlock, Greg and all the other Greasers looks so very wrong on him, like a girl wearing the wrong shade of her lipstick.
A small circling motion has John tip his head down onto the desk and when Sherlock's fingertip breaches the tight rim he gasps. Sherlock's finger slowly works him open, careful not to cause any unnecessary pain as it pushes inside, bends, and is pulled back. Sherlock hovers above him like a predator, listening to John's gasps and whimpers as the first finger is followed by a second and he begins to scissor them, forcing the tight muscles to relax and expand the entrance with pain turning into pleasure and forcing a shudder through John's body.
John's breath is irregular and his heart is racing when he looks up at Sherlock with his lips parted, waiting for the demanding and yet perfect lips to press against his with unwavering strength as the Greaser claims what belongs to him.
“I will pick you up at 8.30 tomorrow morning.”
Sherlock makes him happy.
Written across his buttocks in thin welts given to him by an unforgiving rattan cane are two letters.
Someone like Mr. M.
"Not my problem, as far as I am aware."
Sherlock tilts his head up and kisses away tears that John was not aware of shedding.
“Shhh.” Sherlock silences him with another kiss, tying his tongue and stealing his breath. “You have not taken a break from your studies since this morning. It is about time your bed is used for its real purpose.”
He looks awfully pleased with himself and John's stomach turns. Sherlock is clever, but he appears to have walked straight into the man's claw-like fingers. The Greaser does not want another dose, he
The sheets in John's bed carry a vague scent of Sherlock even after dinner, when the Greaser since long has left and the Cadillac no longer is visible from his bedroom window. John has locked the door to ensure himself that his parents will remain safely in the rest of the house as he lifts the pillow to his face and inhales. The scent makes his head spin and like a drug he finds himself unable to put the pillow down. The knowledge that he tonight will sleep surrounded by Sherlock's scent is overwhelming, but behind the joy lures the dark guilt. Hell, prison, and public disgrace await the man whose stomach tingles at another man's touch. Sherlock is the devil in human form, deceiving him to taste the apple.
John could have sworn that a small smirk tugged at the corner of Sherlock’s lips, but when he looks again the smirk is gone and the mask of cold, impermeable indifference has returned.
“I want you to come for me, my Golden Boy,” Sherlock breathes against his skin. “I want you to stain that jumper of yours. Come for me, give me your first orgasm.”
“He won't,” he promises. “You are my boyfriend, silly. As long as Mr. Stokes doesn't find out that we are dating, he has no reason to punish me for simply spending time with you. Today was a misunderstanding.” He can see how reluctant Sherlock is to accept the comfort and John leans up to peck his lips. “Promise.”
“Get inside the car,” he mutters, already reaching for the key. “We need to get you out of those clothes. You are obviously in pain.”
“Careful,” Sherlock warns him and hooks the arm around John’s waist to pull him back. “You’ll fall in.”
Sherlock's possessiveness is taken to the extremes already the next day. Perhaps it is the fact that John ends up spending the night, sleeping peacefully in the Greaser's arms without a single thought of the scolding he will receive once he returns home, or maybe it is the way he wakes up with a gasp and rubs his aching backside. Regardless of the final trigger, John's heart sinks in his chest when realises that Sherlock was serious the previous night.
“Once you are in too deep it is hard to withdraw They know things about you. Call it playing or call it blackmailing, one thing is for sure. You will not be the one laughing.”
Sherlock pecks his lips and turns around, putting an effective end to the discussion as he disappears behind a door. “Take off your trousers and lay down on the bed, John. On your belly.”
Their eyes meet for a second before Sherlock guides John's head down and pulls him closer, and John has a feeling that Sherlock was not talking about the sin of the jeans-covered knee pressed between his two naked thighs.
“You really are jealous, aren't you?” Sherlock huffs, partly annoyed and partly pleased.
“You did well, John.” The teacher pats his back and goes to put the cane away. “The punishment is over, you may stand up and get dressed.”
Sherlock snorts as he reaches for the paper and flattens it with long fingers. "Law school is for squares like you." He taps John's shoulder to make more room for himself on the blue sheets and lays down with his head supported by a pale hand on the temple hidden underneath the dark hair.
"You were brilliant down there," he chuckles as he tosses his teacher's note onto his desk and folds his arms underneath his head. "Please tell me you're going to law school."
Underneath Ms. Carroll's informative words is an address written and next to it, in exactly the same thin, slanting handwriting as his teacher's, is another message.
The boy who John fell head over heels in love with and for whom he never stopped falling, plunging into the dark pit of his own demise.
“Hush, John,” Sherlock says and as expected hooks an arm around John's body to pull him in the last couple of inches until their sides touch. “Are you not more comfortable like this, my Golden Boy?”
“No, Mr. Watson.” Mr. Stokes' voice is stern and he puts the project away again. “Miss Hooper's testimony is not trustworthy in this situation.”
John cannot find it in himself to do so. His face is pale, his hands sweating. Darkness is ignorance, but John could have sworn that the darkness filling him with horrifying thickness derives from knowledge of the pain he soon will feel.
“The things you do to me, John,” Sherlock breathes. “Everything about you is simply too much. I can hardly contain myself.”
“Getting you warmed up and your blood flowing,” Mr. Stokes explains and delivers a couple of more pats before he withdraws the cane and swooshes it through the air. John can nearly see how the man rolls his wrist, getting himself warmed up for what he is about to do. “You should thank me.”
Thoughts that never should have crossed his mind.
John opens his mouth to protest and Sherlock gives him a reproachful look.
The leather jacket.
Johnny Cash is followed by Jackie Brenston & His Delta Cats, and before long the car comes to a stop. Apparently Sherlock knows where he lives, for he finds the correct street and even the correct house without uttering a single word.
“It hurts,” John whimpers, aghast at Sherlock's selfish deed.
To think that Sherlock would hesitate before redecorating his face is foolish. A small voice in the back of his head repeats Marilyn's warning words and he nearly groans to himself as he approaches the intimidating building with his back stiff. Leave the jacket and hurry home before his parents come back, that is all he has to do. A bold attack is half the battle and the knowledge of what would happen if his parents were to find the leather jacket in his room motivates him enough to push the door open.
“He is mine.”
“You are worried.”
The Greaser's long fingers trail down the black sleeve and manages to find enough of John's hand to liberate it. He laces their fingers together and John nervously licks his lips when he looks down at the natural arrangement of digits, fitting together as perfectly as puzzle pieces.
“Well,” he says slowly. “We don't even know if we will get a new teacher, right? It sounds like a rumour to me. Mr. Morgan has been working here for years, why would he quit?”
“It is surprisingly suitable, if you think about it,” Sherlock says with an amused twinkle dancing in his eyes. “The other members, the teachers, the students… People in general. They are all morons. They don’t even know that they are driving around with a logo on their leather jackets declaring them as idiots.”
John's gaze does not falter from the reflection of the man and he slips his hands inside his pockets as his head threatens to collapse under intense brain activity. He cannot stay there forever, but he is terrified of doing anything that will break the magic slumber and awaken the man. Even his breathing has slowed down to careful, withheld puffs of air.
He chuckles softly when he sees how reluctant John is to accept the note and leans back. “Do not worry, John, I am not suggesting anything inappropriate. A cup of tea, that's all. You need help with those Greasers and I am more than willing to offer it. There has only been a few years since I was in the same situation and nobody gave me a helping hand. I am your friend, not your enemy. Remember that.”
“Do not feel obliged to initiate a conversation, John.”
“You have got to be joking.”
John’s head snaps up so quickly that his neck hurts when someone calls for him and his hideout behind the corner turns out to be less protective that he had hoped it would be.
“John is still working with the moles. Tricky equations. But not to worry, Mrs. Watson. We have it under control.”
John does not know what Sherlock regards as later, but he does know that he is grateful for the Greaser's discretion. It is bad enough that muscles, of which existence he did not know until Sherlock forced his way inside the previous night, protest with each step he takes.
He adds the last declaration as if he could read John’s mind. Moriarty must climb the lowest hanging branches of the oak to reach and John seized the opportunity to look around, considering the probability of sliding around the corner of the school before Moriarty could return to the ground and reach for his gun. Not very probable, even without the threat that freezes the blood in John’s veins to ice. His parents, his caring, proper and innocent parents, must be saved at all cost. No one other John should be punished for his own mistakes.
John swallows. Although Sherlock’s stance is anything but threatening, he can see the seriousness in the Greaser’s eyes. Sherlock is prepared. John does not know what for, but he is prepared.
“What?”
”Is that understood, John?”
Sherlock, who clearly notices the difference, chuckles and gently rubs John's thigh.
Mr. Stokes chuckles and places a tray on the coffee table. “I apologise for bringing you back to reality, John. Dreams are usually more pleasant. Especially the dreams of a teenage boy.” He gives John a smile as he sits down at the other end of the sofa with his legs crossed, motioning towards the cup on the tray. “Please.”
The man finds him. In control of everything, he acts as though he expected John to walk past the grocery store at that exact moment. He looks pleased when he beckons John into the shadows behind the building, whereas John feels sick. His stomach is riding a roller-coaster and just came across a particularly vicious drop.
His mother still looks displeased and she stands with a disapproving shake of her head. "I will give the two of you five minutes alone," she declares as she flattens her skirt. "Clearly there are things that you are not willing to share with me, John. Five minutes, and when I come back you had better have a better excuse than 'it is ridiculous'. I am not the only one who is disappointed and shocked by your behaviour."
It is like Sherlock's arm once again collides with his ribs. John is fighting a war he cannot win. A two front war. In his attempt to buy the silence of the one man who knows about his and Sherlock's unusual intimacy he has revealed the secret to yet another man. The domino effect has begun, the tiles are falling.
What he regrets remains unsaid as Sebastian leaves a moment later, disappearing around the corner with an angry roar from the Bantam. What stays with John longer than the sight of the Greaser is the feeling of exhaustion. He feels like one of the washing machine's at Glenn's Self-Service Laundry, which spins and spins with its content centrifuged towards the edges. As if he will become the first known case of an exploded head due to an overload of thoughts.
John stands there with his head slightly bowed and takes it all, as surprised as he is terrified. His mother’s voice is still short and sharp when she eventually presses the piece of paper in his hand and looks him in the eyes.
“How are you, John?”
Sherlock's hand finds his cock and a smug grin appears on the Greaser's lips. John is hard, not as hard as Sherlock, but hard enough. The ultimate proof of his body's reluctant interest, something which he cannot control.
Ready to volunteer to said group, John slides down from the bike on shaky legs and pushes the glasses up on his helmet. He enjoyed sleeping in Sherlock's arms, far more than any boy should, but all the complications around the Greaser are getting on his nerves. Not to mention that men in suits telling him to stay away from Sherlock make him nervous.
“Beautiful, is it not? Mr. Morgan was never my favourite teacher, but I always did admire his desk. Curious how things turn out.”
He is just about to step over the threshold and into the weekend of freedom and ordinary, highly sinless plans when a voice, raised above the noise of moving feet and excited students, reaches him.
“Knew him,” Moriarty corrects him. “If only by name. Back when I was walking those hallways as a student.”
His silent joy does not falter until Sherlock drives through the school gates and John's heart drops together with the speed of the car until they are parked next to the other Greasers' vehicles. His posture immediately grows tenser and his tongue flicks out to, with a nervous motion, wet his lips.
“I like that reason better,” John admits and Sebastian gives another amused laugh.
It does not matter which part Sherlock is asking about, John can honestly and without hesitation give him a negative response. No one has touched him where Sherlock's knee is grinding him, no one has kissed his temple, ear and neck like Sherlock is doing and he has never been naked from the waist and down in anybody else's, boy's or girl's, bedroom. He has never been filled with the need and pleasure Sherlock fills him with, not even by his own hand.
The cane whips against his skin and John yelps, once again jerking forward and into the desk. It makes the pain double, sharp on his backside and dull on his front.
John's angry eyes relax and widen and Sebastian looks away with a shrug.
John is pushed behind Sherlock's tall back and Victor laughs at Sherlock's threatening growl.
It is Biology and it is Chemistry, his body's reaction to Sherlock's attention, an yet John cannot explain what is happening to him. He does not even want to explain. To feel is enough, to blink up at Sherlock's sharp jawline and high cheekbones and spread his legs when the Greaser's fingers encourage him to do so.
The humming has stopped on the other side of the door. In the eerie silence that follows he can hear Mr. Stokes’ steps get closer, the sound of fingers tapping against the wood forces John back to an unpleasant reality.
John never wants to stand up again, but the option would be to stay on the teacher's desk with his bottom naked and exposed. He slowly straightens his legs and feels his knees shake the moment before the pain hits him with new strength. Every movement, however small, irritates his glowing skin.
Mr. M.
Maybe Sebastian feels as suffocated by the house as John feels by Sebastian's presence. There is something wild about the teenager that makes him look as misplaced inside the Watson's neat home as a tiger in the middle of London. The Greaser's motorcycle is parked by the pavement and Sebastian begins to push it down the street with John traipsing a few feet away. Uncomfortable silence hangs over them and John nearly wishes that Sebastian would let the engine roar to life, until the Greaser finally speaks.
“Mr. Watson will join you shortly,” Mr. Stokes adds. “Now, Sebastian, if you will be so kind.”
Mr. Stokes' flat is merely five minutes away, but sweat darkens John's shirt when he knocks on the door and prays for the teacher to open. In the back of his mind he knows that he brought this mess upon himself. He kissed a boy and he skipped church, and now he presses his back against the wall as he terrified listens to the sound of Mr. M approaching. The moment of surprise and the time he spends running on the rugby field earned him a lead, but a lead is only valuable if it gets him to safety. He has nowhere else to go. He cannot allow Mr. M to follow him home, the police is more of a threat than a savour and B Street Bikers’ headquarters are too far away for his numb legs to reach. Even if he stumbled through the door into the dirty garage, drenched in sweat and gasping for breath, he cannot be sure that Sherlock would not simply throw him back to the wolves, cold-heartedly and without mercy.
He lifts his gaze to find comfort but is nearly relieved when Sherlock spins him around and he can look at something other than Sherlock's face. It is as beautiful as ever, shadows falling perfectly over his features. What make John feel at unease are the Greaser's eyes. Whereas they normally shift in colour, blue one day and green the next, there is nothing of Sherlock's colourful irises to be seen behind the black frontier. The pupils are abnormally big and give John the feeling of drowning for real, disappearing in the darkness in a far less poetic manner.
John sighs again, a sound of agreement. The salve numbs the pain enough for him to take his mind off it with the new sensation tickling his skin.
It is the first time since the incident at the warehouse he speaks directly to the Greaser and he nearly flinches when the teenager turns to look at him.
“You might as well give up, golden boy.”
The plea is left hanging in the air until Sherlock turns his hand and laces their fingers together. “I am relaxed.”
Sherlock entwines his fingers in John's hair, rubbing circles over his scalp, and John subconsciously lifts his arse higher.
joins John's collection of records after Sherlock explained that it contained the song playing on the radio the very first time John sat down in the red Cadillac. Sherlock also buys him a bracelet, a simple gold chain but with a price tag that makes John reconsider the rumours about Sherlock's hidden identity as a drug dealer and killer. John only agrees to wear the feminine accessory, under the sleeve of his jumper, once Sherlock agrees to do what John wants.
“I don't care about your family disputes.” The reply is as cold as Sherlock's voice and Victor starts walking again. He approaches them slowly and it is not until John can distinguish every crease in the man's shirt that Victor's gaze drops. “You know I don't require money.”
John's fingers close around something in his pocket and he pulls it out. The second he must take his gaze off the threat to read the writing on the piece of paper is nerve wrecking, dangerous in every sense of the words and purely idiotic, but necessary. A moment later he is running.
He knows what Sherlock will do long before it happens. It has been deeply programmed into his brain during two months’ time and John feels himself wait for it from the moment he timidly sits down in the Cadillac. He closes the door behind him and as if the consequent click were the alarm awakening Sherlock, the teen extends a hand and the long fingers finally brush through John’s hair.
Sherlock, leaning over John, their lips firmly pressed together and a big arm over John's small shoulders.
Sherlock touches his inner thighs until John's smaller body begins to tremble. The word Sin has disappeared from his vocabulary and left is only lust and desperation. The long fingers wander up and down, from knee and towards his crotch, but Sherlock keeps him breathlessly waiting as he delivers false hope after false hope, always swerving before he reaches John's expectant and swollen member.
“You hurt me.” He starts quietly, building strength as he stares at Sherlock with the emotions flooding through his body once again, as fresh and painful as when Sherlock left him that morning. “You hurt me today and you hurt me every day since we met. You manipulated me and you showed me sin. Leave me alone!”
“Dreams are more pleasant.” He is ready to agree without hesitation. “Dreams, fiction… Anything that will take you away from reality for a moment.”
John deeply regrets bringing his Chemistry book when beads of sweat form in his hairline. He could see Sherlock cast the thick book amused glances already in the car and he can only imagine what the Greaser will say once he realises that John has brought it with him into the deepest of forests. He runs his arm over his forehead and when he looks up again Sherlock is gone. The tall back he has used as a landmark since they first entered the forest is nowhere to be seen and John looks around with a confused frown before he cautiously continues forward. He pushes himself through a thick wall of bushes, that do their best to push him back again, and nearly jumps out of his skin when someone grabs his arm.
His feet leave the branch they have been balancing on. His body falls, his hands clasp the rope above his head and his toes just barely touch the ground, just enough to give him a second of false hope before he realises that he cannot give himself any proper support.
John opens his mouth to say something, licks his lips and closes it again.
He cares to the degree that he will decline a snogging session in the Greaser's car, including a demonstration of what Victor taught Sherlock, in order to retrieve the dangerous photograph.
"There is no darkness but ignorance." -
The man turns around and waves with his hand to make John follow him. Away from Sebastian and into the shadows.
John's body tenses and his head snaps back with a groan. His teeth alter between gritted and chattering when stars explode before his eyes, blinding and beautiful, and he presses himself tightly to Sherlock when he cannot take the overwhelming feeling any more. The explosion is expected, and yet it surprises him. John whimpers and moans, sobs and squirms, as pleasure wants to lift him from Sherlock's lap and the only thing tying him to Earth are the Greaser's steady hands.
John answers without hesitation. It is so obvious that his own ignorance almost hurts.
Sherlock overwhelms his senses and John can do little but let himself drown in the sensation.
“Sherlock, please.”
The fingers on Sherlock's other hand card through his hair.
“I do,” Sherlock confirms and places his palms on the ground behind himself and leans back. “Most of us do. Sebastian and Larry drive bikes and I am working on getting mine back on the roads, but most of the members have cars. Things don’t always go according to plan.”
Sherlock waits until the teen has disappeared inside the warehouse before he pulls John in towards his chest with a long arm and soothingly pets through his hair.
The photo booth.
“I just thought... he cared.” John's voice is small and he bites his bottom lip. Of all the people present in his life, he never thought Sebastian would be the one to comfort him. The Greaser is two years older, intimating and rough. He is the person who changes girls more often than he washes his greasy hair and who never gets attached enough to be left with the feeling of decay John is carrying inside.
They have been on John's mind for a couple of days, the small booth with a curtain protecting them from insight. Sherlock huffs annoyed when he is forced inside by John's eager hands and he gives the lens a look as though he hopes to burn it with his eyes. John ignores him as he puts the coins into the machine and smiles as brightly as the sun when the first photo is taken. He melts the Greaser's grumpy mood with a kiss on his cheek for the second photo and for the remaining two Sherlock leans down to kiss him on the lips with an arm around his shoulders.
“I know that it’s wrong,” John finally says, weakly. It is the first time he discusses it with someone, not even Sherlock has been entitled to a verbal version of the guilt, the shame, the disgust and the self-loathing. Sherlock always read it off him, no words were ever needed to convey his confusion and the need for those tender fingers to card through his hair and put his mind at ease.
The dull wall is the last thing John sees before he closes his eyes.
"Get down."
John is grateful for Mr. Stokes' decision to keep him after class when it is time to mount the bike. To John it is like climbing a mountain. When he finally is seated behind Sebastian, falling down feels like such a realistic threat that he immediately locks his arms around the Greaser's chest and prays to God that he will not end his days on a beast of metal. Sebastian kicks the vehicle to life and John suddenly feels like the milkshake machine at Red's Ice Cream. Everything shakes. His body, his teeth, the school, the man watching them.
John ends up bringing the jacket back home again. He hides it in his wardrobe, under neatly folded jumpers and shirts where the black creates a revealing contrast to all the soft and dim colours. His hands are trembling when he closes the door and he is left staring at them until he has to take a deep breath. The shock reaches him from nowhere, long after the menacing man left the warehouse and John numbly returned home. He stumbles backwards until the hollow of his knees collide with the bed and he limply falls down onto the mattress which offers his body a soft landing. The ceiling above looks the same as ever, but John hardly sees it. He is staring beyond it, into the mysterious space where tiny stars soon decorate his vision.
John chuckles with a shake of his head. “No, you're mistaken, Molly. Trust me, that's not true.”
“I came here to eat my lunch,” he points out and shows Sherlock the sandwich in his hand. “Not to... cuddle.”
John’s attention is once again drawn to the piece of paper in his hand and he unfolds it, looking down to for the first time read the message written with the thin handwriting of his teacher’s.
Sherlock grunts.
“See what I mean? Possessive.”
“If he is avoiding you it would probably be wisest to stay away,” John says quietly, but his words are ignored.
“Look at you,” Sherlock says quietly, and cold, emotionless eyes sweep across his face. “You want it so badly, don’t you? You long for it. It only takes two words, John.”
“B means… Boron?”
“What sort of things? Greaser things?”
Sherlock never speaks to him. Never. The deep baritone voice is carried with the wind and it reaches John together with another wave of smoke. It paralyses him, leaves him speechless. Nearly two months have passed since that Wednesday when Sherlock first placed a possessive hand on his head, petted through his hair, and walked away without a word. Every day this process is repeated, until John learnt not only to expect it but also to accept it, and not once has a word been spoken.
Sherlock’s deep voice echoes inside his head. It sounds annoyed, and John knows exactly why. He is being stupid, stubbornly denying the obvious because it is inconvenient.
Greg looks about as happy to guide John through the already familiar corridors of school as he was last time he executed Sherlock's request. He makes a small jerk with his head to show John that it is time to leave and then turns around with his hands in his pockets. John can feel heads turn in their direction as they cross the school yard and make it into the main building and the unwanted attention makes his ears glow. The leather jacket illuminates him like an actor on stage despite its black colour and John hurries his steps to walk next to Greg in the vain hope that it will camouflage him.
“What changed, my Golden Boy?”
“So does your own jacket.”
“I would rather not kidnap you at this point,” the man says seriously and turns around. “In fact, I would rather the police is not informed.”
John gives his head a light shake and the stupid grin on his face fades. “What?”
“John. I am waiting for an apology and an explanation, because this is not how I want you to behave.”
Sherlock's mess.
John blushes. “Well, I… B Street Bikers?”
“Cut the gas,” the Greaser mutters. “I never touched 'im. He looked like a punk who'd gotten lost from his keepers. Not my fault he refused to tune out even after I quoted. He even brought his mush.”
Just loud enough to block the sounds from downstairs it also envelops them in a sphere of privacy, a sphere which is needed once Sherlock returns to him. Whereas John normally would see a faint reflection of the Greaser in the window the empty frame offers nothing but a view of Mr. Davis' house. He waits, nervously, with his fingertips hugging the edge of the desk. Second after second passes, with nothing happening apart from the rising of hair on John's neck, until Sherlock ghosts his fingers along the line of sensitive skin where John's bottom meets thigh. The sensation is enough to make his heart leap if possible farther up his throat and his buttocks contract automatically with a wave of dull pain as muscles apply pressure to the welts. Sherlock does not let it fade before he angles his wrists and once again cups the backside with palms on his cheek and fingers still in the imaginary line underneath. He kneads the flesh, massages it gently at first to soon continue with a firmer treatment. Under the layer of stinging pain lies excitement, openly shown when a gasp breaks through the tones of
Molly giggles and takes a better grip around her books. “Nice to meet you, Sherlock.”
“Try to have a cuddle,” he suggests quietly. “With a baby sister or a pet.”
“So apologise.”
John knows already before he lifts his gaze what Mr. Stokes collected from the cupboard.
“John,” he says and takes John's head between his hands. “I have never lied to you. What your mother saw was merely an act, designed to make her like me. This is the real me, rude, annoying Greaser with a big ego and a rich family whose money is very useful when it comes to buying my Golden Boy golden gifts.”
, and John silently agrees.
“You replaced me, didn't you?” Sebastian shakes his head with a huff. “You're tiny. The biggest part of you are your binoculars.”
Sherlock's tongue pries John's lips apart and violates his mouth before John realises that the kiss is less innocent this time. He gasps and pulls away, but with the locker and Sherlock's hands behind his head there is nowhere for him to go. Sherlock rolls his hips as their tongues meet and skilfully draws an involuntary moan from John's lips.
“There is no one here, John.” Sherlock barely lets him finish before he continues with his bored voice. “The amount of grass between us is simply pointless, and by pointless I mean utterly ridiculous.”
If touching himself is a sin it is nothing compared to their current activity. John soon arches his back with a soft moan as his body demands more. More contact, more pleasure. More Sherlock. It abandons years and years of following the right path when one of the Greaser's hands settles in his hair.
“Everyone thinks Sherlock killed Carl. That rumour has followed him around for years. People fear him.”
Greg snorts with a shake of his head. “Believe it or not, but Sherlock is a genius.” He chuckles at John's expression of disbelief and Greg gently pats his arm. “I know, he doesn't look like one. But I'm telling you, he would be a nerd if he weren't such a flutter bum. And if he bothered to show up in class every now and then. He calls them a waste of time.”
John can barely contain the groan until the sharp sound of his mother's heels dies out. "Of course she brings God into the picture," he mutters. "As if he would care about a silly little note." He turns to Sherlock and in vain expects him to be compassionate, as Sherlock only shrugs and leans forward, not to take a biscuit, but to run his palm over a crease in the tablecloth. The silence and attempt to ignore him reminds John of a grumpy child and too tired to deal with an eighteen year old baby he pushes the now crumpled piece of paper into Sherlock's cold palm.
“Be so kind and explain this to me.” Her movements are controlled even as she angrily waves the piece of paper through the air, making it impossible for John to read as much as a word or even a letter no matter how much he squints behind his glasses.
With the sun keeping him warm the leather jacket remains thrown over his shoulder, where the skin underneath is boiling. He aimlessly walks through the town, up one street and down another. With no address, telephone number or even a name he can only hope that Mr. M will find him.
John stares at Sherlock for a moment before he flinches and quickly lifts his hands to do as he is told. The mess is harder to appreciate once the wind stops blowing through it.
“Good boy.”
“Here.” Sebastian must have guessed the answer. John blinks down at the offered cigarette and when he hesitates Sebastian pushes it closer. “Trust me.”
“Why would you need to gain my trust?” he asks as he slowly turns back to watch Moriarty try the knot by pulling decisively at the rope a few times. “Why me?”
“I spent the night at a friend's house. I know, it is irresponsible to have a sleepover on a school night, I should have called and I did deserve being sent to my room yesterday.”He ducks away from his mother's hand which still caresses the skin she the slapped a few hours earlier. “I'm sorry.”
Sherlock.
“Good morning.” His voice is nearly timid when he walks up to the sink to clean the plate before he takes his seat at the table. He knows that his entrance still is stretched and he knows what his mother will find if she lifts the blanket in his bed. Sherlock's cum, which seeped out through his arse during the night. He has lost his virginity and he lost it to a boy.
John is thoroughly scolded for the night's pleasure. His mother sends him to his room with a plate of sandwiches and a throbbing ear as he can do little but shrug when she demands to know why he never returned home the previous afternoon. Sherlock's leather jacket is an unfortunate clue and, although Mrs. Watson's fears are far from the truth, they are bad enough.
A smile that does not reach his eyes is playing on his lips when he turns around to beckon John, who follows on numb legs, through the open door.
They walk past each other during the short break between second and third period. John is hurrying to Maths and Sherlock looks like he has not yet decided where to go, to class or outside in the search for something more interesting. John turns his head, expecting eye contact and an acknowledgement of the kiss they shared, but Sherlock's attention is focused elsewhere with such determination that it cannot be anything other than intentional. Concern takes a tight grip around John's chest and the trigonometry does not make any sense to him during class. Despite his best attempts to discard the kiss as meaningless and a sinful mistake, he cannot lie to himself. The kiss meant something to him, his inside tingled and squirmed.
“I like that, kiddo. It's a date.”
“But it is,” Molly insists and nods at something behind John's shoulder. “And if there isn't anything going on between the two of you, why would he be here right now? I know Sherlock's timetable by heart, and he should be in Maths right now. In the opposite end of the school.”
Of Sherlock Holmes.
He holds his breath when the staining odour of cigarette smoke grows too strong to be ignored and his heart skips a beat. He knows what is to come and a moment later, as his eyelids fall down, he allows himself to enjoy the feeling of long, slender fingers running up his neck and through his hair. He does not question it; he does not even show a sign of noticing.
“Hey!”
He cannot look Mr. Stokes in the eye when he puts his plan into action. He keeps his head bowed, hoping to make it to the door and into freedom with minimal pleasantries exchanged between them, but it takes the man but a quick look for soft lips to pull into a smirk that is somehow conveyed in his voice as he speaks.
He turns his head to look at what John so eagerly points at and groans.
“No, it's... I appreciate the offer.” John pushes the milkshake closer to Sebastian to coax him out of the grumpy shield he quickly is assembling. “It would drive Sherlock mad. So let's do it.”
is not enough to make him feel comfortable. A part of him wants to add ‘If I am still allowed to speak’, but he quickly pushes the thought away.
“So... why did you quit?” John asks carefully with his forehead furrowing in a frown.
John regrets not calling for help when they cross the silent parking lot in front of the building with dark windows. Not even Mr. M, who so far has had an annoying habit of appearing in the shadows in moments when John feels most vulnerable, is anywhere to be seen.
John lifts his gaze from the soft ground underneath his feet to look out over a lake with water so calm that the foliage above is reflected with the perfection of a mirror. The lake is small enough to swim across without any effort and around it, standing firm and protective, is a natural barrier of trees and thicket so close to the lake that it on some places is impossible to tell where water ends and land begins. The scene is breathtaking and John is filled with a sudden gratitude towards Sherlock for sharing it with him.
John wants to tear Sherlock’s mask straight off his face and let his mother see what hides underneath, because the teen with the soft eyes and pleasant smile is not Sherlock. It is too perfect to be natural.
Or maybe, a part of him is simply jealous because Sherlock is smiling at his mother instead of him.
Sherlock does not have to take the punishment of homosexuality into consideration as the kiss grows hungrier. They are surrounded by dull industries and, much like B Street Biker's base, most of them seem to have been claimed by society's outcasts. Gaping holes stare at them where glass once used to protect the room inside from wind and rain and John doubts the police even bothers to investigate the car wreck left to decay in the far end. The part of town, hidden and forgotten by those who know to stay out of trouble, follows its own law of order.
Sherlock leans forward and presses a kiss to John's temple. The smell of cigarettes intensifies with Sherlock's face so close to his and John licks his dry lips. Sherlock has taken him on an inner journey, challenged him to do unthinkable things and enjoy sinful deeds. Sherlock has made him trust a Greaser, question his faith and fall in love.
“Wait, please. There is something I need to ask you.”
"Explain."
Sherlock pats the leather jacket which he has placed on the grass next to him, inviting John to join him.
His ears are ringing when John stumbles forwards. The trousers around his ankles limit his walk, he keeps stepping on the fabric and even the three steps up to the desk are challenging with the humiliation making him dizzy.
Sebastian is waiting for him outside the door, leaning against the wall with a grumpy pout that would have been cute on a child but looks directly fatal on a tall and strong teenager. John cannot remember misbehaving, but he cannot help but think that Sherlock gave him Sebastian as a horrifying punishment. Unless, of course, the Greaser is sent to him as a bodyguard with the purpose of intimidating Mr. Stokes. Regardless of Sherlock's true intentions, John disagrees.
John's attempts to explain turn into stuttering as Sherlock interrupts him time after time. The Greaser will not let him explain, will not understand that John denounced Victor for him.
John’s heart skips a beat. He never thought that he would be so genuinely happy to see the Greaser. It is difficult to think clearly with his body suddenly filled with adrenaline, with hope, but once John realises what he must do, he does so without hesitation. He walks around Moriarty, coaxes him to face him rather than Sebastian’s distant frame.
“I warned you about Sherlock Holmes,” he says quietly. “I told you to stay away from him.”
John's heart does a heavier beat and then seems to disappear from his body as it, instead of blood, pumps out a wave of freezing ice.
John clears his throat. It is not until Sebastian turns to him with hair ruffled by the wind and he takes the goggles off with one sweeping movement that John realises that his decision to turn to Sebastian for help was impulsive, and very much so.
. The increase of speed also means an increase of wind and when John for the fifth time lifts his hand in an unsuccessful attempt to flatten the mess his hair quickly turns into, Sherlock snorts.
John is happy for exactly one week and two days. One week and two days is how long it takes Mr. Stokes to mark their Chemistry projects and one week and two days is how long it takes John to receive a note instead of a grade identical to Molly's.
John freezes on the chair. He can vividly see his future shatter into tiny, unrepairable pieces, with scholarship, education and acknowledgement from his family being merely an unattainable dream.
He guides John's chin up and pecks his lips, a sign with many layers of inside meaning. Affection, loyalty and trust in all its glory, but what makes John's eyes warm with gratitude when they separate enough to press their foreheads together with Sherlock's hand slowly rubbing the back of his neck is the fact that it was not an act of forgiveness. A hand through his hair forgives, a peck without it tells there never was anything to forgive.
“Relax.”
“Mr. Watson. A word, please.”
It takes John a moment to realise that Sherlock is waiting for permission. The Greaser's fingers rest on the elastic, ready to pull the pants down. John nods slowly and Sherlock shifts on the bed, placing one knee on each side of John's thighs, and the long digits slowly, inch by inch, expose John's abused backside.
“Hands on the desk,” Sherlock orders him firmly and guides John up on his toes to have a better angle as he begins to thrust with earnest. “You're mine.”
It goes easily, just as easily as the Greaser with hair dark as the night and skin pale as the moon stole his heart.
Eventually, his finger will be back at the heart and he carefully takes it out.
He climbs the branches of the oak with Moriarty’s giggling ringing unpleasantly in his ears. He can understand the man’s inappropriate amusement, as the symbolism is so loud and clear that he cannot ignore it. He entered a road of self-destruction and now he is placing the noose around his own neck.
He stumbles to his feet and quickly places a hand on the rough bark of the old oak next to him when his head spins from the sudden movement. “Hello?” He bites his lip when the tall boy disappears around the corner of the school building. He does not want trouble, but nor does he want to return home without his school bag.
“Oi, you!”
“Don't worry, my Golden Boy,” he murmurs and kisses his way into John's mouth. “They know better than to touch what's mine.”
“I’m not happy,” John protests. “I was having lunch with my friends.”
John is back in his room before he knows it with both freedom and dignity intact and without a ringing ear and a burning cheek. He is so relieved that not even Sherlock's presence can dislodge the smile on his face when he drops down onto his bed and toes his shoes off.
“Everything.”
John looks down. He is too tired to deal with Sherlock's accusatory tone and attempts to intimidate him into getting what he wants.
A sinful temptation.
John tilts his head back until their gazes meet and he is looking into the depth of Sherlock’s eyes.
John has never felt more like one when he stands with the leather jacket in his hand outside the school gates on Monday morning. He cares too much about what people will think if he puts it on. The rumours will intensify and the connection between sharing a Greaser's jacket and sharing a bed is inevitable, a safe source of gossip about who is making out with whom. The headlines of the school.
“Tell him that you're here or you will get in trouble,” she whispers and yanks at his arm to get him to raise it before she quickly brushes her hand over her long braid. “Do it, John.”
Mr. Stokes' gentle hand massages his sore skin and John winces.
“I'm not interested in your excuses, John. I told you to wear the jacket and you didn't. It is as simple as that. I am deeply disappointed in you.”
“It does not mean Bible, that’s for sure,” Sherlock snorts before he taps his fingers against the cover of John’s Chemistry book. “You are holding the answer in your hands, golden boy.”
But he notices.
“Lestrade, make sure John gets to his class. I need to have a word or two with this moron here. John, do fix your hair.”
“SH could mean anything.”
The effect is immediate. A shiver runs down his spine, leaving a line of goose pimples underneath the perfectly smooth jumper of a colour which John calls blue but his mother insists is cobalt.
The soft hand squeezes John's shoulder and he slowly stands up. He is nearly surprised that his knees carry him as he fumbles with his belt and manages to get it open. The fabric of his trousers brushes his naked legs as they fall down to his ankles where they cover his shoes and a metallic sound is heard as the belt meets the floor. Hands that are not his own push the white briefs down and a tongue that does not belong to him nervously flicks out.
Dust has already formed white disruptions against the shiny black pair of shoes and the man has strategically positioned himself where he will not accidentally touch anything that could defile his suit, and yet he gives John a critical look and raises an eyebrow.
“People care until they don't have a reason to care any more,” Sebastian says, and John can tell by the unusual look of concentration on his features that he is choosing his words with great care. “Why would they care once they have what they came for? You're a rugby player. It gives ya a certain power over the Dollies, if ya know what I mean. It's the same. Once ya have what you came for, you cop a breeze.”
Sherlock faces no difficulty in getting the button open and he pushes John's trousers, along with his underwear, down to his ankles. John shivers, suddenly experiencing the breeze from the window as chilly, and he looks up at Sherlock with wide eyes.
Sherlock’s response is humiliating. He raises his eyebrows and a chuckle builds up deep down his throat until it reaches his lips.
Steps, a thud, and body falling to the ground, and then, at last, darkness.
The man's hand as he beckons John closer.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and sits up straighter. “Impress me. I know that you have figured it out.”
“I'm just asking for a name,” John says weakly, and when he looks up at Sebastian he is not the only one trying to catch his breath. “I don't want to try it. Please, Sebastian. I really need a name.”
“So... Have you heard about Mr. Morgan?” John turns to Greg, trying to start a conversation in order to distract himself from his staring audience. “It was rather pleasant to have a class less yesterday, wasn't it?”
John frowns and gives Molly a look of disbelief. Unless Mr. Morgan's absence was due to a journey back to the man's twenties, he cannot see how the teacher would be considered cute.
“Sir, it is not-”
“Let’s go, golden boy.”
“I'm just...” John swallows thickly and shrugs, before he gives up with a sigh. “You are intoxicated, aren't you?”
A decisive knock on the front door sends John to his feet and the photographs quickly disappear down his pocket as he guiltily looks up. He is not expecting visitors and anyone who knows his family knows that Sunday morning is spent in church. His brain jumps to the logical explanation and his heart skips a beat with the consequent happiness.
"I will see you tomorrow, John."
A groan from Sherlock and hands, clumsy with greed, assaulting his back tell him that Sherlock, despite John's pain, enjoys himself.
His gaze flickers over John's face before it zooms out and Sebastian's features, apart from the the concerned wrinkle between his eyebrows, smooths out. He does not seem to notice when John carefully wriggles out of his grip and nervously licks his lips, not sure what to do next.
”Is it that Holmes boy, John? Has he been dragging you into mischief? Were you drinking last night, is that why you feel nauseous today? You know what your father and I think of such behaviour.”
John is panting with his palm pressed over his side, and it takes him a moment to collect himself enough to stand up and repair the damage of his rude entrance. Mr. Stokes still looks puzzled when John pushes up and tries to pin his glasses to his sweaty nose.
“Please,” he whispers. “Sherlock, I-”
a proper meaning, and he sits down without his usual timidness and hesitation.
"I changed my mind."
The man’s tastes are as questionable as Sherlock’s.
“Goodbye, Victor.”
The word feels wrong on his tongue. Two boys cannot cuddle. Cuddle sounds intimate, romantic even. Something couples consisting of one boy and one girl do.
The position feels unnatural and John reluctantly spreads his legs a little wider when the cane gently pats the inside of his thighs. It might be for his own comfort and balance, but John would have preferred to keep his thighs tightly pressed together. His cock hangs flaccid and humiliated, framed by his legs, and he prays to God that the door behind them remains closed.
Immediately, John dashed over to the window and threw it open. The air and rain beat harshly upon his features as soon as the window was let open. He was drenched without even stepping outside. Sherlock flew over to the body and set the rods in place.
Sherlock’s mouth parted slightly but John, beating him to it, said, “Please.”
“Are you hurt, Sherlock?”
“The thought of leaving our bed upsets me, it is rare to see you in such a state of happiness, Sherlock.”
“He might require a demonstration, John.”
John smirked. He truly believed that. If he did, then that meant that Sherlock would have to as well.
“I suspect that they are homosexuals, degenerates to society. There was a moment during our conversation when the bloke laid his hands on Sherlock in places that should never meet his touch and to my dismay, Sherlock did not shy away from such unlawful conduct. Surely Mycroft must be rolling in his grave to be witness to such...depravity.”
The words are breathed into his mouth, each syllable sending a shiver down John's spine. He whimpers softly and Sherlock pulls back, examining John's flushed cheeks and insecure smile.
“Exactly. Boron.”
John forces himself to look up and meets Sherlock's eyes.
After a stressful pause Mrs. Watson sighs defeatedly.
Sherlock's fingers continue to roam his skin, nails scarping gently and fingertips drawing small circles, whilst John's jaw slowly is drawn towards the floor and his lips part to let out a soft sigh.
A moment later he tenses. The muscles in his gluteal region, with names that John knows by heart but cannot find in his memory, contract and Sherlock faces a natural barrier of defence. Being touched down there cannot be described as anything but unnatural.
“I was looking for you during lunch,” she says cheerfully and quickly brushes a curl of brown hair behind her ear that has managed to escape her long braid. “I assume that you haven't heard?”
“Sleeping?” He cannot find it in himself to believe his own innocence, not with Sherlock's hands disappearing into his back pockets.
“Listen,” John licks his lips and looks down to gather courage. “I don't know you. I hardly know Sherlock, we have only been spending time together for a few weeks, if even that. I am not going to spy on him.”
“It is beautiful,” John says and hesitantly sits down next to Sherlock once the Greaser places his leather jacket on the ground as a protection for John’s trousers. Sherlock seems amused by his decision to obey the request, but his hand immediately comes up to touch John’s hair in a silent praise.
Panting, needy and with a fine layer of sweat over his lower back he gives Sherlock access to his most precious place.
Long fingers dispose John of his bag and then gently guide his arms through the sleeves of the jacket. “I want you to wear it tomorrow, John. I have had enough of your little whims. An apology will not be enough next time.”
John leans forward to see and shrugs slightly. “It is my and Molly's Chemistry project, Sir.”
Sherlock does not have to raise his voice in order to convey the threat. He says the words calmly and quietly, but with each syllable cold as ice and dripping with poison. To defy him would be to press the button and unleash the missiles.
John’s fingers are as white as the porcelain they convulsively hug; the sink is the only thing keeping him standing as he stares into the mirror without seeing his own reflection.  “It could be a misunderstanding.”
Sherlock grunts disapprovingly and with a grind of hips against abdomen reveals a prominent erection.
On a second thought, with the immediate danger gone and with his pulse returning to normal, it was less wise to seek refuge in Mr. Stokes’ home. The man’s eyes are intelligent, like Sherlock’s, and John is reluctant to make eye contact in the fear of what his teacher might contract from him.
“I'm sorry.”
In practice, that would never work, and John is secretly pleased with that. The Greaser he is familiar with does not smile with horrifying perfection every time he enters a room nor speaks in a voice so pleasant that the words might as well come from Queen Elizabeth herself. The Greaser he is familiar with tosses cigarette butts on the ground, skips class and invites a reluctant John to what appears to be an abandoned warehouse.
“His what?” John, still shocked by the man's decision to describe him and Sherlock as close, frowns.
“Certainly, but not yet.” Sherlock mouths the words over John's neck and takes a firmer grip around the lower part of his backside. “Not yet...”
To spare his sore backside he positions himself on the bed, lying flat on his stomach with his neck in an uncomfortable angle and with his glasses continuously sliding down the bridge of his nose. Studying does not bring him the satisfaction he hoped for. X solves for 10 instead of 13, the chemical reactions remain unbalanced and the bracelet around his wrist turns into a distraction. Sherlock is once again on his mind.
“Well?”
“Sherlock would never hurt me,” John says, but he cannot put any real conviction behind his words. It is easy to ignore the rough touches next to the gentler ones, but the memories of strong fingers gripping his jaw and cold eyes meeting his are still there, somewhere deep, buried in the back of his mind. “He knows what he wants, that's all.”
“I told you to wear the jacket."
Sherlock's hands draw a shiver from him as they move down his sides and over his hips. Whereas they could rest there comfortably they do not, but continue along the leather of John's belt. How Sherlock manages to get it open with their bodies merged into one is a mystery and what happens next, however a natural proceeding action, makes John grab Sherlock's shirt.
Sherlock buys him gifts, just like John would have done if he had a girlfriend.
sounding from the radio as the wind plays in their hair. It gives peaceful a new meaning. People can stare and they will stare. Sherlock's jacket keeps him warm and the Greaser's thumb strokes soothingly over the back of John's hand.
John has never visited a teacher before, and he briefly wonders whether it is appropriate to do so as he looks around in the sitting room. The mental exercise as to why it would upset his mother, the headmaster and perhaps most of all Sherlock, helps him take his mind off other, graver matters and he leans against the backrest with two of the blanket’s corners gathered up in his hand, by his chest. Sherlock is the
Kissing feels good and no god would make it possible for his body to tingle that way and then punish him for savouring the feeling.
“Lesson two, John,” Sherlock says factually as he sits up and once again can tower over John. “I don’t appreciate it when people lie to me. You may apologise and it will be forgotten, but next time there won’t be any second chances.”
“So you're a rugby player too, yeah?”
The mask is gone. The devil has revealed his true form.
John shakes his head and, unable to meet his mother's concerned eyes, looks down at his own feet.
“You're walking to school tomorrow.”
Sherlock's sharp voice cuts through John's head and joins the countless other insults already thrown at him. He should be horrified but numbness fills his body. Sherlock's anger is directed directly at him this time, not luring behind mind games and manipulations.
“What's going on between you and Holmes anyway? I thought he cared a great deal about you.”
The house is as remarkable on the inside, with flights of stairs, soft carpets and old paintings in gold frames, some which John could have sworn have Sherlock's nose or Sherlock's eyes. He finds the house more frightening than the scene in the warehouse, it disconcerts his image of the Greaser and reinforces the fake Sherlock who visited his mother. The fake Sherlock who turned out to be the real.
“Oh, Johnny. Can you see how this is going to happen? You refused to give me the information I want, but luckily, for me at least, I happen to know also your pressure point. Tell me who his dealer is, or this highly inappropriate photograph will be seen by more eyes than mine.”
He can almost hear the Greaser sigh over the noise from the motorcycle before Sebastian turns it off. “Well?”
Silence follows, in which John forgets how to breathe. He sits there, in the green light with Sherlock’s hand resting dangerously around his neck, until the Greaser chuckles and gives John’s hair a ruffle.
John knows the moment Sherlock starts moving his hand, tugging his skin and revealing the swollen head, that he will not last long. A drop of pre-cum trickles out and Sherlock smirks.
The photo booths.
A shudder runs through John's tired body and he nods. He might be wearing rose-tinted glasses, but Sherlock has never looked more handsome with the curls pulled down by gravity and his eyes black and dilated.
John bites his lip, waiting with bated breath for Sherlock to continue.
“And what might be the reason for your late arrival, Mr. Watson?”
The man’s laughter only dies out when the shiny shoes are safely back on the grass and fingers with well-trimmed nails cup John’s chin.
Mr. Stokes has inherited Mr. Morgan's old office. John passes the door in dark wood everyday on his way to class until it turned into a solid part of the wall to which he never paid any attention. Until now. The yellowing name tag with the fading writing is replaced with a new, whiter piece of paper and the minor change is enough to turn the familiar door into black, unknown water.
“You have nothing to gain by remaining on that chair.” Mr. Stokes rounds the desk and places a gentle hand on John's shoulder. “Six strokes, that's all. Three on each side and I will avoid the most sensitive parts. I cannot let you leave this room without sending a message, so be a good boy and bend over the desk. Bare bottomed.”
“It is too big,” he mumbles and extends his arms in front of him to see the sleeves cover his hands and fingers. “It makes me feel like a toddler.”
His eyes are scared when he turns his head in the direction of the sound of feet landing on cobblestone, in rhythm with his rapid heartbeat, and he leaves the doorway to continue down the street like a frightened rabbit when the door suddenly opens and John looks up at the surprised Mr. Stokes. He all but dives inside, slams the door shut and collapses against the wall. The teacher looks down at him with his lips parted, as if what he was about to say evaporated somewhere on his tongue.
The sharp noise of a firing gun fails to distress him.
“No, John,” he replies with a softness in his voice, as if he suspects that the question originates in the turmoil of feelings inside John’s body. “I have experienced a wide range of emotions, but never love. Am I right in assuming that love is in on your mind?”
“What a moron,” Sherlock mutters, but John barely hears him. His cheek is pressed uncomfortably close to the cold leather jacket and the scent that suddenly surrounds him is even stronger than the hypnotising scent left by Sherlock in his pillow the previous night.
John is not aware of how long they remain in the shadows. He loses himself in Sherlock's embrace, who does not show any wish to move until John is ready. He can hear the rest of the rugby team leave the locker room, he can see the lights being put out one after one as the teachers retreat to their offices or to their waiting cars, and eventually he rubs his wet cheeks.
John repeats the name, his voice as weak as his knees. Sherlock's hands are keeping him standing, and also keeping him too close. Sherlock's eyes are too dilated, an endless sea of darkness, hungry and demanding.
"Tell her the truth."
John shrugs and makes an attempt to peel the leather jacket off when the car stops, but Sherlock places a hand on his shoulder.
Nervous seconds tick by before John can see a movement in the corner of his eye. A spark of hope lights in his chest as he, stupidly, hopes that a pale hand is about to put an end to all this silliness. A moment later he finds himself staring at Sherlock, long fingers holding his chin firmly in place.
Perhaps he is in too deep already.
The wind catches his hair, lifts it towards the sky. It reminds him of Sherlock’s gentle treatment, the only memory that can give him harmony. The beautiful boy with the beautiful eyes and the beautiful hair.
“Someone doesn't like having his lunch interrupted. A lesson to learn, John. Find the right spot from the beginning and you won’t have to move. Sit.”
John sighs. “Can you wait outside? Please.”
John has to blink a couple of times once Sherlock’s hand is removed from his throat and it is not until his ears are whizzing that he inhales. “What?”
. The gasp turns into a moan when Sherlock's thumb parts his arse cheeks and a single, precise fingertip traces the rim of muscles hidden inside.
Instead of telling him to step into a car, Sebastian gives him a helmet. He is one of the original members of B Street Bikers, one of those who everyday risk their lives on a bike. John licks his lips when he sees it. A BSA D1 Bantam, or as his father calls it, a motor-driven death-machine which takes corners too sharply and follow their own traffic rules of insanity.
Breakfast is already on the table when John reaches the bottom of the stairs and his stiff movements carry him into the kitchen. In his hand he holds the plate his mother had prepared his sandwiches on the evening before and he knows, from how many pages in the morning's paper his father has turned, that he is late.
”I'm feeling nauseous, Mummy. I... I don't think I will go to church today.”
“Would they?” Sherlock asks coldly and tilts his head slightly to the side. “Would they know that we, two boys, kissed, or would they assume that you stand under my protection?”
The deep voice, although rougher than usual, is genuine and it catches John off guard. He stares at Sherlock, with the warmth his chest reaching and surpassing the heat between them, and he does not struggle when their lips seal in another sloppy kiss.
“So…”
He licks his lips and looks up, just in time to see Mr. Stokes' gaze move from the leather jacket to his face, and he quickly opens the jacket enough to let the teacher see the clothes he is carrying underneath. Not white, not with stains of grease. A soft jumper over a checked shirt, respectable and proper.
Sherlock is waiting for him underneath the oak, lying on his back supported by his elbows and glancing out over the school from the same spot where John was studying the previous day. John cannot understand what was so obvious about the secluded part of the school area that Sherlock expected him to immediately know where to look. As if the tree were their special spot.
He looks up at his mother when he is done and subconsciously licks his lips. ”It's a medical fact, Mummy. I don't want to vomit in church.”
”Yes. Yes, I understand.”
The school operates like its own little society. The bulls and Greasers live side by side at the top, both groups convinced that they are the head of the self-invented government. They are followed by the cubes and at the bottom you find the nerds and the punks.
“I have to admit, Mrs. Watson, that although I came here to defend John and explain why he left Ms. Carroll’s note behind, I am starting to think that I might have been mistaken. I too would like to hear what John has to say for himself. For leaving me behind like that.”
“Stop staring,” the Greaser mutters grumpily. “I ain't a ghost, punk. Where's Holmes?”
“You are very responsive.” The deep voice is muttering in his ear as sharp but gentle teeth nibble on his earlobe. He should feel disgusted, push Sherlock away, but the feeling is breathtaking. His rear still stings under the contact with Sherlock's heavy palms, the stimulation of his earlobe makes his head spin and a firmer touch of jeans against his naked prick is what finally draws the first moan from him as Sherlock rolls his hips.
“Of what is to come.” The man's cold eyes change to something close to amusement when he realises that John straightens his back rather than buckling under the subtle threat. “Already defending him, how touching. Association with Sherlock Holmes is dangerous. Do you by any chance recall the incident with a boy named Carl Powers?”
John can only nod, out of breath and amazed by the feeling Sherlock gives him. It is better than good grades. It is better than rugby, television and books.
The kiss is graceless and John soon lowers himself back onto his heels, but Sherlock has never looked more satisfied as when he runs his fingers through John's hair.
“John? I am delighted to see that you accepted my invitation, but what in the name of God happened to you?”
“You should probably go, John,” David cuts him off, and Marilyn nods feverishly.
He sinks back into the sofa and hides his face in his palms to avoid Mr. Stokes’ examining gaze.
As if enjoying another man's touch is not enough to bear.
The Greaser must have realised his mistake.
. He knows just from the feeling of being dismantled like the anatomy model that Sherlock Holmes is standing behind him, tall, dangerous and perfect with cheekbones of which Montgomery Clift would be jealous.
John has no proper answer to that, nor does he dare to meet Sherlock’s eyes which he can feel bore into the side of his head like a pair of sharp scalpels used for frog dissection. Eventually he shrugs and, putting aside all precaution and thoughts about what Sherlock might want to hear and what could get him out of the bedroom and down the stairs in one piece, decides to tell the truth.
The phrase is repeated over and over in John's head to the point that it loses its meaning and the next day he can nearly roll his eyes at the unreasonable words. Someone like Sherlock Holmes does not have a pressure point, especially not a pressure point in the shape of a square.
“Two words, John.”
”Very well,” she says eventually and turns to pour John a glass of water. ”Let us get you hydrated. Drink this and then you are going to church with your family, young man.”
“I was told by one of my men that you were seen wandering around.”
Molly does a jerk with her head and John follows the movement with his gaze. The man standing with the back to them is as smartly dressed as Mr. Morgan, but his hair is not white and his posture is not sunken with age. He moves his arm swiftly and unhindered over the board, neither sweating from the effort nor groaning when his joints refuse to lift his arm high enough. A low buzz is filling the classroom as students exchange theories and with curious eyes follow every move of the white chalk over the black board until the name
John nods slowly and thoughtfully looks away. He has seen Sherlock exploit Molly and her unconditional love ever since the headmaster gave in and granted her and her self-invented Science club free access to the labs for harmless and by a teacher approved experiments. Molly's enthusiasm does not falter although she remains the only member of her club and she is still convinced that Sherlock will join her if she lets him access the labs just once more.
Mr. Stokes shifts on the floor, moving to John's other side to give him the last three strokes of the punishment, and John bends his left arm and brings it closer to his face. The golden bracelet is so close that he could kiss it and he presses his lips against the cold metal. It reminds him of Sherlock and it gives him strength, although he knows that Sherlock would not be happy with just comforting him in a moment like this. Sherlock would take the cane from Mr. Stokes, pry the teacher's lips apart and shove the piece of wood down the man's throat.
A moment later John wishes that he had enjoyed the peace with Sherlock instead of turning it into a war. Sherlock's face immediately darkens, quicker than day turns into night in late December, and the warmth which has filled John since the orgasm disappears.
“Drugs ain't nothing for a square like you. Your lil' body couldn't handle it.”
“Didn't I tell you you're merely an ankle-biter?” Sherlock hums and rewards John with a hand stroking through his hair a couple of times. “I happen to like this jacket on you, so you will wear it.”
“Fucking perfect. If it ain't Mr. M?” Sebastian's elbow gives John a push resulting in that he nearly does fall off the bike. “Just go. Some of us are bored of playing Holmes' stupid games.”
. You know, Johnny, I have been thinking about a way to get to Sherlock. Everyone would be happier if he just came out of the dark hole in which he is hiding like a frightened little rabbit. Miraculously, I just happen to stumble upon his new pressure point. Happily unknowing.”
He does not trust Mr. Stokes.
His voice reaches its climax. He is angry, hurt and desperate, but most of all he is tired. Tired of Sherlock’s games. Tired of the dangerous company of the Greaser.
To his surprise Sherlock chuckles, but as soon as the teen opens his mouth it is evident that the reason for his amusement is something different than John’s attempted joke. “Oh, I believe we are well past strangers by now, Johnny,” he murmurs. “I have kept your back safe for the past two months and we are at the moment engaging in a conversation. To call me a stranger is unexpectedly cruel to come from the Golden Boy.”
“I'm not... I'm...”
“Sherlock is not here,” he informs the man. “I have not seen him since he dropped me off this morning.”
Sherlock's bigger shoes steps into his field of vision and John feels how the jacket his draped over his shoulders.
“We're here. At ya keepers' place.”
John shrugs, giving her as little of an explanation as the previous afternoon. “I'm fine, Mummy.”
“Sir?”
“I am glad to see that you are feeling better.”
“John Watson.” The man nods at him when John stops, but the cold eyes look anything but friendly as they critically scan the helmet. “It pleases me to meet you out in the open, that warehouse is enough to make anyone look grey, don't you think?”
Sherlock doing things to John.
Their lips meet in a kiss, soft and affectionate, as if Sherlock is attempting to make up for the previous roughness, and when they part they prolong the moment of perfection by gazing into each other's eyes.
“You have been most useful to me, John.”
“Mine.”
, William Shakespeare
It happens again the following morning. John is waiting on the pavement already 8:20, ten minutes before Sherlock promised to be there. His father has already left for work, but his mother is still inside the house and over John hangs the fear of her walking past one of the windows with embroidered curtains when Sherlock arrives. He does not know how he would explain why her son gets into the car of a rock n’ roll loving, smoking and clearly older teen. He does not even know the reason himself.
“Yes. Yes, it is.”
Over Sherlock's shoulder, John can see the shadow of his mother fall over the sitting room floor and he turns to the Greaser in pure desperation and blurts out the first thing that comes to his mind. Two words.
“What do you like about it?”
“I'm not angry with you, John,” Sherlock repeats, in a deeper, softer voice than before. “You have been very good for me. I have no reason to be upset.”
“I heard what you said. I’m just…” John scratches his head and takes a deep breath in the vain hope that it will clear his mind. “I don’t understand.”
There is something ominous about the beauty before his eyes.
Fingers, as long as Sherlock's and with a slight tremble, stroke over John's shoulder. They are gentle but do not ask for permission as they reach John's neck and push his shirt collar down enough to reveal the purple mark left there by Sherlock's lips. John barely catches a glimpse of the smirk on Victor's lips before Sherlock's unforgiving arm sweeps through the air and hits John over his rib cage with enough force to give him a fearful moment of struggling for breath.
Sherlock's hands leave his body and John can feel a drop of saliva make its way out his open hole and down the path of skin to his balls. His heart keeps racing, wantonly expanding to occupy his entire chest, until it comes to a sudden stop and John's attempt to inhale is met by a firm wall where mouth turns into throat. The head of Sherlock's cock, swollen and with a pearl of pre-cum lingering on the slit, mercilessly ignores the restrictions of John's entrance as it pushes inside with a quiet but extended groan from the Greaser.
He understands a moment later that it hardly will be necessary. The sun is shining, not only encouraging the process of photosynthesis in an ever blooming nature but also enveloping him in pleasant warmth. It does not come as a surprise that the roof of the Cadillac is once again folded. A pair of dark shades protects Sherlock's eyes from the sun rays and his white t-shirt leaves no doubt as to why the Greaser has the reputation of being one of the best fighters at school. Sherlock leans over to open the door on the passenger side, the muscles in his arms flex and John's stomach tingles.
“Oh no you shouldn't,” John says quickly, not for a second doubting that the Greaser is serious, and then frowns as Sherlock huffs disapprovingly. “What? I need my jacket.”
“Wait! That’s my bag. Where are you going?”
“You certainly have a thing for men with dark hair, don't you?” John huffs and receives a sharp elbow in his side as Molly tries to look stern but cannot hide a small giggle.
“It was simply convenient, an alternative payment. Besides-” Sherlock's voice drops and the petting through John's hair stops as the Greaser moves his hand to instead touch John's thigh with a smirk appearing on the delicate lips as John automatically spreads them. “He taught me a thing or two.”
Sherlock chuckles and catches John's hand to press a soft kiss to his palm. “Oh, I've done a lot more than cuddling boys,” he says with his eyes moving across John's fingers and the well-trimmed nails. “Things your innocent mind can't even dream of.” He lifts his gaze and looks at John, whose cheeks gain an ever increasing pink shade. “Or maybe you can,” Sherlock adds with a smirk.
“John Hamish Watson.”
He follows the noise into the hallway, where his mere presence is enough to interrupt the chaos before him. Sherlock’s hand around Mr. Stokes’ neck, Mr. Stokes crouching in fear. Sherlock’s curls wild and his eyes dark until the moment they turn to look at John, who is struggling to keep the large trousers around his waist.
“B Street Bikers, yes.”
Sherlock grunts. ”You know your Shakespeare. Ms. Carroll would be pleased.”
”Good morning, Sherlock,” he greets and closes the door after him. “One moment, jacket...”
Sherlock looks down at him and eventually he sighs.
Sherlock was livid when he found out. Always protective. But he was also sweet, took his time with the marks on John’s buttocks. What followed was definitely worth the pain and humiliation in Mr. Stokes’ office.
Mr. Stokes moves closer on the sofa, takes the cup of tea from his trembling hands. He did not even notice that he was shaking. The burning sensation reaches him with an unnatural delay. He looks down and sees a dark stain grow bigger on his thigh as the fabric of his trousers soaks up the tea he spilled. Like a clumsy child.
“Last time we met you said I was happily unaware,” John remembers and takes a few steps back. Just in case the man would find a bag or a rope inside his suit jacket. “Apparently I am happily unaware of what is to come.”
Mr. Stokes sighs when John begins to stutter defensively and he walks up to a cupboard with heavy steps.
“All right,” he mutters and annoyed pushes Sherlock's hand away when the Greaser tries to force his head up. “Then why don't you pull down my trousers and spank me right here? I can bend over the car, if that would make things easier for you.”
“Nor do you-” He makes a short, dramatic pause before he continues. “Johnny.”
“What are you doing?” He squints down at Sherlock and at the same time listens for approaching footsteps. “My parents will see you, you can't be here.”
For them.
This is a different pain.
Sherlock takes his hand and leads him inside, over the cobblestone, up the steps and through the squeaky door. The dark hallway makes the hair on John's neck stand. It is dark despite the bright sun outside and he can see dust whirl in the few sun rays that manages to break through the layer of dirt on the windows. His heart beats faster when a pair of decisive steps joins the sound of theirs and Sherlock's hand leaves his. Swallowing thickly, John looks up at him, only to be completely ignored as Sherlock's gaze is drawn to and locked at the doorway where a lanky figure soon appears. He walks with confidence and, like Sherlock, does not seem to mind the obscurity. With soft curls in need of a proper wash and with shadows falling underneath his eyes on the pearly skin he looks like a blond Sherlock, cheekbones sharp and face emaciated.
“Yes, you. Boy with the binoculars. Did they send you as a spy? We’re still going to blow them off at the drag next Sunday, tell 'em that.”
“Hi, Molly. I was having my lunch under the... Heard what?”
“I know that I am allowed talk,” John tries again as his hands close the book in his lap. So far he has avoided Sherlock’s eyes, but with nothing left to distract himself with and with a growing concern of being rude, he lifts his gaze and bravely locks it with Sherlock’s.
"Not my problem."
“You are right, Johnny,” Moriarty murmurs, not at all bothered by confessing to murder. John can even distinguish highly inappropriate pride in his voice. “Perhaps you can even name one of them?”
Sebastian is silent for a moment before he replies, with a hint of hesitation in his deep voice.
Hiding his dilated pupils. Chewing on the inside of his lip.
Sherlock and a pair of lips that never should have touched his.
John looks from Sherlock to the book in his lap and up again. “Because my mother… Never mind. What are you talking about?”
Baffled, John gives Sherlock’s profile a glance and then looks out the windscreen with a frown. He can only interpret that as a no to his unspoken question.
John nearly jumps when the deep voice breaks the silence. “I always do.”
He pushes John outside with a slight tremble of repressed anger, forcing him to move with a hand on his neck as Victor's sounding laughter follows them through the hallway.
“Are you writing a book? Get out!” A big hand on John’s shoulder pushes him back with such power that he nearly falls over and the authoritative voice that reaches them from a short distance nearly makes him wish that he had.
The bed dips from Sherlock's weight when the Greaser joins him and a big hand strokes over John's thigh. The sensation makes him shiver as the soft fingers spread the pleasure over his skin, just like the cane earlier spread the heat.
“Yes. By five years. I met him when I was eighteen, the little brat used to sneak in to listen to our lectures. He would sit there in his shorts and ask questions as it were the most natural thing. Then Carl Powers drowned and the little brat was convinced that it wasn’t a tragic accident. He became rather obsessed with the whole affair; it was most amusing to watch him run around. Until his brother decided that his prying was inappropriate, and pulled him out of both the case and my classes. I missed him.”
Sebastian who was assigned as his bodyguard, very appropriately so considering his prominent muscles, and who volunteered to stay even after his boss disappeared off to God knows where. Who showed John that even one of the most intimidating Greasers could pull his lips into a smile and who, after all, turned out to be rather friendly in his own somewhat clumsy way. Not to mention that Sebastian would be able to expel the demon haunting John.
“That’s my bag.”
”Are you sure, John?” his mother asks and steps closer to place the back of her hand on John's forehead. ”You missed dinner last night, and now church... ”
Sherlock sighs heavily when John still does not show any sign of understanding and runs a hand through his dark curls.
“I’m giving you a ride home today.”
John turns to face her and blinks a couple of times to replace the mental image of Sherlock just before their lips met with the girl in front of him. Molly's obsession with Sherlock is one of the saddest things John has ever seen and he feels nearly guilty when he sheepishly returns her beaming smile.
John is close to changing his mind and turning back home a number of times as he walks down the pavement with the crumpled piece of paper in a tight grip. He decided to bring the note, even though he has read the address so many times during the morning that he can see the slanting handwriting on the inside of his eyelids, and it guides him through the streets to a part of town he only travels through by car when his family visits Aunty Margaret at her farm. The address itself tells him little of the location of their meeting. He is vaguely aware of the reputation of the adjacent streets and he had more than one reason to tell his mother a white lie regarding his plans that morning. He even brought his Chemistry book to ensure her that they are going to study.
The petting through his hair was a vital part of the process, Mr. Stokes tells him. By repeatedly touching one of the more innocent erogenous zones on John’s body, Sherlock could exploit his sensitivity and confuse pleasure with affection.
“Sherlock, I'm not dying. You could have taken me home, I don't want to be at some... royal hospital where someone like me does not belong.”
If only he had asked Sebastian to walk him home.
“So you finally decided that my jacket is good enough for your cute little bottom?”
If sin feels so good he never wants to be cured.
Sherlock chuckles and lets his hand brush through John’s hair as he pulls his arm back. “I found this place by accident,” he continues and sits down with his legs folded. “I come here when I need to think or get away from everything for a couple of hours. People can be so annoying. Sit.”
.” John pulls his hand away from the cold window and wraps Sherlock's jacket closer around himself. ”King Lear.”
Greg says it with such obviousness that John’s jaw drops, and a moment later he sees Greg’s face soften as the Greaser places a hand on his shoulder.
Due to the nature of their relationship the future is obscure, but life seems a little brighter when Sherlock, unwilling to part so soon, drops John off outside his house. Victor cannot turn them in without getting himself in trouble for the same deviation and John has successfully acquired the demanded information for Mr. M. His wet lips are a proof of Sherlock's feelings, which, if he ever doubted, finally have been spoken out loud.
The Greaser's name is once again leaving his tongue, a prayer and a desperate plea, calling out for help when his tingling stomach feels about ready to leave his body. Without hesitation Sherlock is there to hold him together, big hands on his flushed cheeks, fingers caressing his temples and rubbing circles over his scalp.
Sherlock opened his mouth wide and ate the piece of egg. John’s mouth moved as if he were eating as well. He was imitating Sherlock’s chewing. Sherlock swallowed and cut a piece of John’s egg.
“We will leave.” Sebastian whimpered. “We will go far from this place. Spin a globe and pick the spot it stops on.”
Sherlock attempted to free himself of John’s grip but his hold was firm, and that meant he would get him to lay back down.
Sherlock’s eyes nearly popped from his socket. Thomas Banville was here? What business could he possibly have at the yard? He was in cahoots with Moriarty, his presence on the day of Sebastian’s departure made that evident. Was this planned all along? Banville would report Sherlock to the police, and Moriarty would get the two of them to create Sebastian knowing that their doing so would do nothing to stop their punishment? What evil, evil men! He faked a report of theft to tell the Yard of why he was really there.
“Mrs. Hudson shall be delighted that I’ve arisen from my grave.”
“Mercutio.”
John didn’t respond. He only peppered kisses all over Sherlock’s shoulder and then his neck. As much as Sherlock wanted to be mad at him, he did not see reason and decided that John should be forgiven. He removed John’s hands from his waist and grabbed one as he led him to the dining room. He fully expected John to take his seat while he scrounged something up for the both of them to eat, but John followed him into the kitchen. Sherlock frowned, they would have to shop for groceries soon.
“I don’t quite know. He was Irish, God, can’t mistake that accent. He looked to be in his...I don’t know...early fifties?”
A moment of silence.
“Yes that’s it! John!”
His voice cracked, and Sherlock picked up the paper that he had bought at the station. John’s pleading voice wrenched at Sherlock’s soul and he never wished to hear that desperate tone or the soft crack of his voice. Sherlock had found a page in the crime section that interested him and began reading it. He had not reached the second paragraph of the story before John whispered, “What are you reading?”
Moriarty tapped the tip of Sherlock’s nose with approval and walked away.
He lied to Mycroft, it was not the last time he did it. He spoke to men and flirted with them but that was only the time he was struck by Mycroft for such a thing.
“He has a gun!” Sebastian whimpered behind him. John only squeezed his hand for comfort.
“No, of course not, forgive me. The thought of Moriarty leaves me beside myself.”
“You flatter me.”
John sat him down on the armchair in their living area and walked away. After finally being left alone, Sherlock decided to remove his coat and set it on top of the battered box that he was too ashamed to look at. He had only wanted to do something nice for John but he couldn’t even do that much. He pressed a finger to his lip and removed it. The skin had torn open, his finger coming away with blood. He did not want to see what he looked like, his face hurt, his ribs hurt, everything hurt. The only good thing to come out of it was the arrest of the two who initiated it. When he was younger, he had not been so lucky. The hardest part was creating a different lie each time. Mycroft knew, he always did. The way Sherlock’s head hung when his older brother approached him, the fact that Sherlock had always made it his mission to wear long-sleeved shirts to hide the bruises, the way he cried in his room every night as if Mycroft could not hear.
He walked towards the back, to his room, so that he could be left alone and safe, but he heard Moriarty’s voice beckoning him to sit with them. There was an armchair for each of them, he pushed his as far away as he could without much notice. He did not like Moriarty. The man  was wicked, he was evil, he was everything John and Sherlock were not. He did not like Thomas for staying quiet, even when Sebastian knew he disagreed, for being a coward, for watching as Moriarty destroyed the world around him.
“Nothing of consequence, have they hurt you?”
“Hamlet.”
Sherlock finished the last of his morsel.
“You are mad to think I will agree.”
“I do not enjoy this, nor do I ever want to do such a thing like this ever again! I have only done it the once so that I might finally have a companion, one that would present me with the undying affection of a friend, of a family member, I had not meant to fall so helplessly in love with you! We have little over a month to create this man, and when that time has run out, we shall hand him over to Moriarty so that we may live and love in secrecy. Don’t you see, my dear John, that there is little I would not do to ensure your safety? Our safety?”
They were born into nobility. The Holmes name was respected by the other members of England’s high society. Sherlock remembered how frustrated he became when their mother would stop and chat with a duke’s wife, or a lord’s fiance. So loved was she, that her funeral was attended by half of London’s upper-class. Their father was a kind man, if not distant at times. His parents loved each other, from what could be gathered through Mycroft’s accounts of their relationship. Few marriages between nobles were ever borne out of love.
“J…” The beginnings of his name. Sherlock felt a surge of excitement rush through him.
“You will in a moment.”
John wore a face of anger and, because Sherlock could not afford anything happening to their creation, not when Moriarty was expected to return soon, he gripped John’s upper arm and forced him to meet his eyes.
He had no experience with this whatsoever but John was a smart man. He shifted to situate himself between Sherlock’s legs to allow the man to spread his legs wide apart. John reached down in between them, fingers brushing past his erection and scrotum, down the line of his perineum, to rest at the pucker of his arse. His heart was racing and his body was tense with anticipation. He was not even sure how such a small space could accommodate John’s fairly large size but Sherlock was making no objections. In fact-
(See the end of the chapter for
“I am unsure. Why is it that he is friendlier with you than he is with me?”
“Peace. Be at peace. My friend only wishes to cover your body. You will not be harmed in anyway.”
“I’ve no quarrel with you, John. I want Sebastian and then I will be off.”
“Moriarty! You seek quarrel with me, you have it! Leave John out of this!”
Mrs. Hudson seemed to take the bait.
Sherlock nearly swooned when John took his hands in his own. He commanded Sherlock’s gaze meet his without uttering a word. Sherlock feared that he would never truly be able to stop falling for him no matter how hard he tried. He prayed that no one would enter the room and interrupt this moment.
Everything went black.
“John, it is imperative that you respond to me. Can you hear me?”
She smiled to herself as well. “How’ve you been? No more shagging corpses? That John fellow left you yet?”
“We’ve arrived, Sherlock.”
“I have no qualms about your reading with me. It shall prove fundamental to you, and entertaining to me.”
“It will be bearable come spring, but for now we must endure the frosty chill of winter.”
“Rubbish! You’ve not eaten in nearly a day, I shall not have the last brother dead as well, not if it can be helped!”
“It appears as though I already have.”
The man responded with a nod, eyes fixed on Sherlock’s before he claimed his lips once more, “You know I love you too.”
“John, wake up! I implore you!”
She nodded. “Yes, sir!”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Release us.”
Sherlock’s finger slid down and landed on the picture of the ocean, vast and calm, though darkened due to the quality of the picture. John squinted but gave his answer.
And then the fall.
John looked up and saw Moriarty’s mouth twisted into a sick grin.
John leaned in for another kiss. He puckered his lips and looked at Sherlock expectantly. Sherlock smirked and gave a brief, but passionate kiss and started to rummage through the bag. John rose from his kneeling position and joined Sherlock on the bed. He watched Sherlock pull out his confection and begin to eat it fussily.
John unfolded his arms and shrugged. “I suppose.”
“Come, let us be off.”
He rose from the bed and fetched John’s pajamas. He was careful when he slid the rest of John’s shirt off, letting it fall to the floor. He then unfolded John’s button up shirt and put it on him slowly and gently. John watched, completely smitten, as Sherlock wore a soft but straight face and changed him with the utmost care and efficiency. When he was finished, he gave John a smile. It was a small one, but in that smile held all the love and admiration that could not fit in his piercing eyes. John held his breath and found himself reduced to an ogling mess that could not help but touch Sherlock’s cheeks and marvel at the wonderful man that sat beside him.
No response. He had remembered when the same issue arose with John.
Sherlock scoured his mind to search for a rebuttal, any rebuttal at all would suffice. Upon realizing that he would not be able to find anything, he simply shut his eyes and permitted the tears to flow once more. He did not need vision to see John’s frown. He could feel it, and he was not sure if it was brought on by disgust for Sherlock’s lack of self-control, or pity for the grieving little brother. Sherlock hoped that it was the latter. While he did not approve of anyone pitying him, the thought of John finding his tears, his emotion, his pain disgusting would be too much to bear at the moment. He was granted his answer when he felt John’s pull and then the familiar warmth of his embrace.
Sherlock spun around to find a man standing in the entrance of the room. He was dressed in a gray suit, hair as black as the night, and eyes that were cold and reminded Sherlock of those of a  spider’s. His tone had an Irish lilt.
“You are correct in this, Mr. Watson and I hate you for it. I am pathetic, and I deserve no better than Moriarty. I would very much like to kill you, to kill Moriarty, but I am nothing more than a coward who does his beck and call. I cannot stand the sight of...of this...creature!” He points to Sebastian who retreats behind John. “I cannot bear to look into your eyes. So blue and so melancholic. I know that not a day goes by where you do not think about these two and it makes me furious. Why should someone so unnatural, so...freakish, be bestowed with those who care for him? Why am I doomed to be little more than a henchman? Is it fair? I should think not.”
------
Sherlock could not stand the awkward air that enveloped the three, he had to get away.
“What do you mean?”
“Would you care for new clothing? My robe hardly suffices as proper wardrobe.”
“Correct. Now, tell me what this is.”
Moriarty turned to Sherlock.
“Of course, I’ve to be off to the station as well to report this theft.”
John did not turn to face Sherlock, but he did respond with a grunt.
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock swallowed. “Such as?”
“Why would his belongings be retrieved?”
“John, I love you,” Sherlock breathed, forehead resting against John’s as they both managed their breathing.
John shook his head.
Sherlock braced himself for the words he knew that were coming. He did not want John to go, but he did not want him to suffer as he did. John was everything they expected a man to be out there. The world would love him.
John stroked Sherlock’s curls; Sherlock closed his eyes and attempted to stifle his tears as he felt John’s soft breath on his scalp.
“John…”
Sherlock scoffed. “So she thought to shield it from me forever? This is the last thing that my brother wrote, and to me no less. I am no longer a child, John, I have no need for her constant mothering.”
“You worry about my happiness, do you?”
“You are not anymore?” John asked, helping with his free hand to undo the last few buttons and then promptly getting out of the garment.
“You’ll find no answer from me. I cannot answer that for you.”
He could still see the way she stared at him. There was a light that dimmed in her eyes whenever she looked at Sherlock after their talk at breakfast. He had always thought that she was different, that she paid no mind to the more personal aspects of his life. Why did he think that of her? Mycroft told him to find a woman that would put up with him and last long enough to bear him children. Mrs. Hudson merely ignored that side of him and chose only to see the little boy she spent years caring for. Which one of them were worse? Sherlock could not help but wonder how she felt when she heard the argument between the two. Was she heart-broken? Did she want to defend him, but feared Mycroft’s response? No, the second choice was highly improbable. She stood there, in the shadows, and listened to every harmful word that Mycroft said to him, and she agreed, the woman that had always shielded him from Mycroft’s wrath, agreed. She had always felt the same way, but simply chose to push those thoughts aside and let Sherlock live in the illusion that he still had one person left at the manor who loved him.
More hesitation followed by yet another nod.
John rushes down the stairs and pulls the door open, ready to pull Sherlock inside with the same force and kiss him right there, but almost gasps as he slams into an invisible brick wall. Sebastian stands in front of him.
He follows John's gaze and gives the surface of the desk a small stroke with his hand.
“I don't think that would help.”
Sherlock's tongue does not force itself upon John. The Greaser waits with his lips ajar and with a gentle hand on the back of John's head guiding him, silently encouraging him to do what Sherlock already has shown.
“Everyone makes mistakes, John. What I cannot understand is why you tried to hide it from us. Your friend arrived with this note ten minutes ago and offered to explain. He is waiting for you upstairs.”
John nearly suffocates on his sandwich, and once he has managed to swallow the piece stuck in his throat he turns to Sherlock with disbelief written across his features.
The Bible is where to look when in doubt, his mother says. To John, the Bible only speaks of sin. He remembers asking God about it during his evening prayer once, a long time ago, and when he woke up the following morning Harriet had just drunk the last drop of juice and he was left to drink milk.
Sherlock is coaxed out of his shell with every touch of affection until John finds himself in the Greaser's arms.
In a way, it feels good to finally share his darkest secret. Mr. Stokes listens to him without neither interrupting nor pulling away in disgust as John lightens his heart. He tells his teacher about Sherlock’s careful approach months ago, about their lunches underneath the protective leaves of the oak, about the thrill of flying down empty roads in a red Cadillac and about the improbable friendship he found in the Greasers. Each syllable that leaves his lips makes it easier to breathe.
A shiver, which does not come from the rhythmical stimulation of his prostate, runs down John's spine. With his hands once again in front of his face and with Sherlock's unwavering hold of his hips, rocking them apart and then forcing skin to smack against skin, John has to settle with the occasional rubbing of his bobbing cock against his own thigh. The stimulus, however brief, add to the already growing pleasure in his body and John soon whimpers, cheek pressed against the desk with his lips parted and eyes black. His hips join the rhythm of Sherlock's as he fucks himself back on the Greaser's cock, looking for the final trigger to release him.
“I understand you met Lestrade.”
Sherlock cuts him off and a kick lands painfully on John’s shin.
"But-"
John reluctantly looks up at Sherlock, who brushes his blond hair back from his face.
“Yes.” A one syllable word, spoken often throughout the day and not rarely in response to questions like Sebastian's, comes out choked and hesitant. “I told you the first time we met.”
The window creeks as he pushes it open and John flinches. The sound is innocent, a fresh breeze of spring is needed after hours of studying, but his conscience is not clean.
“Hey. It’s alright. He tells the inconvenient truth, I know. I still don’t know why I put up with him.” Greg rolls his eyes. “But I meant what I said before. Find him unless you want trouble.”
John tugs the pants down to his thighs and stands on his toes to catch a glimpse of the faded bruising in the mirror. He frowns already before he sees it, prepared for six green lines across his skin.
For a moment John just sits there, staring dumbly after Sherlock, before he snaps back to reality.
How could he, the Golden Boy with straight As and a duteous member of society, become a target of drug dealers and the underworld's henchmen. John blames it all on Sherlock. Sherlock and his involvement in things which no one with a sense of morality should look at twice.
“Put the bloody helmet on, punk.” Sebastian is already straddling the bike, not wearing a helmet. “Holmes don't want ya head all smashed in.”
John is baffled, but since the familiar petting is indisputably to be preferred over blood and pain, he stays quiet.
A man in uniform comes towards them with hurried steps and he bows softly in front of Sherlock when he receives the key to the Cadillac and makes himself ready to park the car. John stares, eyes wide and lips parted. The golden chain was on the brink to too much, but this time Sherlock is clearly crossing the line of what is acceptable.
Sherlock’s car takes them through the town and out to the English countryside which turns more rural the further they travel. He manages to find a road so narrow that John completely overlooked it and after a couple of minutes on the bumpy gravel the Cadillac stops.
Moriarty’s laugh only fuels his rage.
Molly shakes her head and glances over John's shoulder before she looks at him with reproachful eyes. “Don't lie to me, John. He has not been able to take his eyes off you the whole day.”
“You had your chance to explain, young man. I will listen to you and your friend over a cup of tea later. Don’t make him wait, it is rude.”
“Thank you.” John gives him a small smile and pulls the glass close enough to drink from the straw. The cold drink freezes his inside and freezes his feelings and it is exactly what he needs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“John, answer your mother.” Mr. Watson's voice is heard through the newspaper, which John knows is hiding a cup of tea as spectacle-dressed eyes follow the rows of words.
“He did not kill Carl.” John says with a sigh, but stands and picks up the remains of his lunch nonetheless. “I’ll see you in class."
“I have never seen it before, Mummy. I was late for class, but-“ John looks up and meets his mother’s serious eyes. “But Ms. Carroll never gave me a note.”
“You didn't show up at rugby practise today, John. I was waiting for you outside the locker room.”
“No, you're not,” John protests. “You are upset. You have been staring at the windscreen as if it deserves to die for the last five minutes. The windscreen didn't bring you here, I did. You're angry with me.”
The chain reaction is triggered and John relaxes. He cannot help it, the digits carding through his blond curls and the nails scraping his scalp send a signal of pleasure to his brain, making him lean up further in a quiet demand for more. The times when he flinched at the touch are since long gone.
"Relax."
"We will practise, don't worry."
“I'm just-”
He heaves the school bag up on his shoulder and walks towards the building with a glance at Sherlock, trying but failing to prepare himself for the dreadful day ahead of him, but the Greaser calls him back.
“Sherlock Holmes has, during the last few months, developed what we could call a bad habit. A habit that makes him slow and generally uninterested in the world around him. Boring, if you will.” He makes a pause, as if considering his next words carefully, before his voice drop and he continues with a sentence that makes John shudder. “From what I have observed, the two of you appear to be... close. I need you to find out who he meets and where I can find this person. Hand me his dealer.”
"I believe there is."
The words are meant as comfort but bring nothing but panic to John’s eyes. He would pull back, stutter and deny the truth, if the fear had not paralysed him.
And John believes and he lives accordingly.
John turns around to see Sebastian, lingering behind the rows of desks with eyes ever narrowing. Mr. Stokes, whose neck is thin enough for Sebastian to crush with a single, gigantic hand, does not falter, but John feels the threat like a cold palm on chest.
“Sherlock did not kill Carl,” Moriarty murmurs. “I did. I never liked him, so he had to die. And now it is your turn, Johnny.”
“Trevor.” Sebastian says the name slowly, almost tentatively, and his grip around John's collar eases. “Victor Trevor. I know nothing 'bout him. Tried to sell to me once, but I get my stash from someone else.”
“Sherlock?” He whispers the name with his insecure eyes focusing on Sherlock's shoulder as he get a 'mh' in return. “Where were you today?”
“I don't know,” he says honestly. “He might want me to do his homework.”
A handwriting has never looked more intimidating, even the three dots look oddly vicious. John has never been summoned to a teacher's office before, but he cannot see how it would lead to anything good.
“There.” Sherlock fingers linger on John’s scalp, slowly moving down to brush over his forehead just below the hairline. “Much better.”
“But I work with Mol-“
“Keep those, kiddo. They're from Holmes. He says the helmet didn't come in gold, so blue had to do.”
John can feel the Greaser's warm breath on his skin when Sherlock carefully unites their foreheads. Sherlock fills a hole inside of him he never was aware of. Sherlock is the missing piece that makes him whole.
John's pink blush is still decorating his cheeks when it is time for last period. His fantasies about Sherlock are so distracting that he nearly hopes that Mr. Morgan will not be back so that he can take a moment to calm his nerves before rugby practise, but the door to Chemistry is unlocked and open. John sighs as he hurries inside and takes his usual place next to Molly, who turns to him with her forehead furrowed.
John swallows when fingers graze down his temple and Sherlock's big palm cups his cheek. Unlike last time Sherlock touched his face, he is now gentle and the deep, mesmerising eyes find John's as a thumb skims over John's dry lips with a tingling sensation. "Come with me tomorrow, golden boy."
Sherlock kicks his shoes off and joins John in the bed, immediately drawing the younger boy closer and giving the top of his head a kiss. John smiles, reluctant to break the magical moment with words, and places his arm over Sherlock's side.
“I would never let you go to prison, John.”
Mr. Stokes.
Good grades have never been more important. He has to prove to everyone, including himself, that he still is the perfect boy he was before Sherlock intruded on his life.
“Good boy.”
“You’ve come to the wrong place, fream. This ain’t the library.” The teen glances down at the Chemistry book in John’s hand and he exhales a puff of white smoke as his face turns smug. “Or the labs. Cut out and play scientist somewhere else.”
“I am actually a decent player,” John begins, but Sebastian is not interested in his opinion.
“He wants you back,” John points out, his voice quiet as Sherlock erases his will to do anything but relax under the tender fingers now carding through his hair. “If you can't-”
John looks up and a deep frown decorates his forehead. Sebastian looks nearly pained by the effort of initiating an everyday chat with someone wearing a slip-over over a neatly ironed shirt.
John looks up at Sherlock’s eyes, expecting eye contact, but the Greaser’s gaze is firmly fixed on John’s hair. The hands are gentle as they do what John failed to do while the car was moving, with his fingers combing through the mess of blonde hair until it falls as neatly as always.
It is Sunday, church day, but when John finally drags himself down the stairs he is not wearing his suit. His mother looks up from the saucepan on the stove to see her son still dressed in his pyjamas and with his face pale. Mrs. Watson's forehead furrows as she stops stirring the porridge and, out of habit, wipes her already clean hands on the rose-patterned apron around her neck.
Sherlock is still looking amused by the time they reach the school, the complete opposite to John who now pouts grumpily. He grabs his bag and makes himself ready to leave for first period when Sherlock’s fingers close around his arm.
Both John and the Greaser turn to look at Sherlock’s unmistakable silhouette where he stands half in shadow in the doorway to the warehouse. John bows his head in shame, for some reason feeling guilty for the incident, but Sherlock steers his steps towards the Greaser and without hesitation grabs his jacket to pin him to the rough wall.
John likes to think that he does not step on anybody's toes, but in the moment of silence when everyone is waiting with bated breath for the teacher to declare his decision, John has the feeling that at least some of his classmates wish for the Golden Boy to receive a punishment. It would be the first time, and Sherlock's words return to him when he feels the subtle malice.
John's legs function on their own as they carry him down the street. His mind is busy elsewhere, he neither sees nor hears until Sebastian's lips form the only name John wants to hear.
“Are ya slow?” Sebastian cuts him off and yanks him closer by his collar. “Stay away from that shit. There are two ways for people to control ya, do ya hear that? Love and drugs. Don't let Holmes or anyone else get that kind of power over ya.”
John shook his head. “It is not you, Sherlock, never. I am merely homesick, that is all.”
A dead man now and there was no grief among the dead. Perhaps, if he were alive still, the elder brother would no doubt hole himself in his study and blame himself for his younger sibling’s tragic demise. How the staff at the manor would try to lure him out, perhaps with the promise of pastries, or a reminder that he still had things to do, but none of them would succeed in their attempts. Would he waste away? Would he become the empty shell of himself, same as he did without the illness? Sherlock concluded that he would surely die of heartbreak.
“I...took him from the asylum that the Holmes brothers placed him in!”
Sebastian did not answer. John, too distracted in his worry, started pacing again. Sebastian fussed with his bandage. He hated himself, he was vile for treating John this way. How could he lie to him? The man he loved could very well be dead by now, and he would have died alone thanks to Sebastian. He was doing as Sherlock said, he was no good to Moriarty, but he would be good for Sherlock.
“Sherlock? Sherlock my boy!”
It was the address to a bathhouse. He did not waste a moment and tucked the card inside of his coat and set off.
John, however, looked confused and fearful.
“His diet was always poor, as well as his lifestyle. He worked himself to the point of exhaustion and would only recuperate enough to resume his duties. His way of life might have worked in his youth, but Mycroft grew older and his body was no longer as strong as it once was. He developed a cough, nothing serious, we had simply pegged it as a cold. His cough never subsided and it was upon my insistence that he sought medical attention at once. The doctor, the moronic quack, prescribed him tonics and other medicines in the hopes that they would cure his seasonal illness. He only grew worse, his cough became harsh and his body grew weaker. It was not until he coughed blood that he returned to the doctor. He had Consumption. It buggered his lungs, making it harder for him to breathe. He was bedridden until the time of his death, and due to the nature of the illness, I was not allowed to see him.”
John surprised him yet again, Sherlock did not know that John had grasped the English language so quickly. Had John spent his time simply watching, or did he lie to Sherlock and only wanted a reason to have him around? The latter seemed more probable, and it made Sherlock smile to think about such a thing.
“Whatever do you mean?”
“Your name is John.”
Sherlock was aware that he had spent many nights watching John, feeding John, and teaching John that he had not taken the proper time for himself. He had only slept for hours at a time, but now it had become harder for Sherlock to find the right time to have a rest. John had felt guilty about it and he wanted to help.
Sherlock smirked. Heroes did not exist, but if they did, John would be one of them. As John finished tending to Sherlock’s face. He placed the rag on the tray and gave a smile of reassurance to Sherlock.
Sherlock shut his eyes so that he might shut those thoughts out. John had every reason to hate him, he had every right to desire to leave the flat. What a hypocrite Sherlock was. Had he been in John’s place, to be confined to one area for an extended period of time, he would have thought the setting akin to a prison and done everything in his power to escape. Of course John loved him so dearly that he did not have the chance to fully experience the world, save for the trip to the manor and the attack in front of their flat. John was perfect in every aspect. He would be loved by all, desired by every noble woman, married or not.
“Months before we met, my brother he...he passed away.”
“He’s right knackered,” She whispered.

John shot up and grinned. He walked over to the door and opened it to reveal Sebastian standing there with the happiest expression a face could muster. He moved to hug Sherlock, leaving said man with a shocked look, at least, that was what John believed it was. Sebastian removed himself from Sherlock’s body and said, “Sherlock, how happy it makes me to see you!”
He set the papers down and shifted his attention to the lid that covered his breakfast. He lifted it up to see that there were only beans and toast. No tea. Sherlock took his seat and ate his food. It tasted better than the previous time he tried to eat it, but it was not much of an improvement. He was pleased when he took his last bite, Mrs. Hudson’s wrath safely evaded. He pushed the tray aside and made a few more edits on his notes. He wanted to make sure that everything was correct because he was Sherlock Holmes, and he rarely made mistakes.
“I assumed that Sir Mycroft preferred to be alone.”
John had expressed the need to retire to bed, and Sherlock was inclined to agree with him. When he moved to blow out the candle on his side of the bed, that’s when they both seen it. That flash of light that illuminated their entire room for not longer than a second before the darkness engulfed them both again.
With one last look of John’s tattered clothing, he turned to look out the window. He could have sworn that he saw John’s gaze linger on him in the reflection. Sherlock made the quick decision to not speak a word until after they’d reached Baker Street. Everything would be left just as it was before the attack, Sherlock would have to replace the china and the chair that sported the broken leg. He would also have to reveal that he had read John’s journal. Sherlock would tell him that it must’ve dropped when he was taken and that he hadn’t a clue before he read it that it belonged to him. It was very likely that John would become upset at hearing this, but he would rather John know than pretend that he did not invade his privacy. A habit that he tended to do often. And either way, John Watson was going to leave him, what did it matter to add fuel to the fire that would incinerate Sherlock’s heart?
Sherlock nodded.
“I am terribly sorry you had to undergo such misfortune, Lady Martin. My word he even looks odd - that mess of curls he wears on his head!”
“Rubbish, Sherlock. If you are not worthy of my love, then surely I am not worthy of yours.”
Thank you for all the kudos, thank you for all the comments, the bookmarks, the subscriptions, and thank you for all the reblogs on tumblr too! I think I speak for the both of us when we say that we did have a lot of fun writing this  and we are so happy and thrilled that you all enjoyed our twist on Frankenstein and Sherlock!
“As I said before it is quite alright.”
John looked shocked and possibly offended at Sherlock’s words.
“You’re headed to the station, no doubt.”
John wanted to ask him why, he saw the look in his eyes, but he could never bring himself to and only nodded. Mrs. Hudson returned with his food and wore her facade well.
“Macbeth.”
“No! I have done something terribly foolish and now you are cross with me and we shall never see Sherlock again. I am wrong, John. I am all wrong.” Sebastian’s eyes watered and John immediately began to stroke his hand to soothe him.
He was right, Sherlock was loathe to admit it but sleep did sound rather an attractive proposition, and the thought of sleeping with John made the proposal even more enticing.  He felt John pull him up and guide him to the bed. This is what he must have done after their visit to Mycroft’s grave. He laid Sherlock down first and then joined him. Sherlock wanted John to stay with him like that forever but they were not in the flat. They risked an intruder entering the room to find them in such a suggestive state. John noticed the apprehensive look on Sherlock’s tear-ridden face. He smiled and said, “Have no fear, Sherlock. I will not fall asleep, I will migrate to the floor after you have drifted to slumber.”
“Very good sir, now if you’ll follow me.”
He took a breath.
“Sherlock, please tell me what is wrong. I can not stand to see you cry.”
“I promise, if I am able - they go to and fro often - I will return here.”
“Up. Up, love,” John broke their kiss to breath the words against his lips, rising to his feet although still bent forward so they were not separated. “Up. The bedroom.” He clutched a hand around Sherlock’s elbow, urging him to stand so they could move.
“He is finally awake,” John muttered.
“You’re Mycroft’s sibling.”
John only smiled and placed a kiss to both of Sherlock’s cheeks. “Perhaps I am not the peace you crave now. Go for a walk outdoors, and then maybe, when your head is a bit clearer, you can return and we can resume our discussion.”
John’s expression turned soft before he pressed in close again, the kiss one of love and gratitude.
Sherlock scoffed.
Moriarty shoved his hands in his pockets.
“I do hope, Sherlock, that you are not inquiring on the state of our man upstairs.”
“Mrs. Hudson, I…”
John had never yelled at him before.
The man quirked his lips up, clearly mimicking Sherlock’s smile, and telling Sherlock that he did like the name. Sherlock nodded and closed the book.
Two knocks on the door followed by Mrs. Hudson’s entrance interrupted Sherlock’s thoughts. She swore a bright smile and closed the door behind her. She looked down at John sleeping on the floor and then back at Sherlock.
John’s eyes darted from side-to-side, trying to understand. “Right.”
“May I assist you, Sherlock?”
Before Sherlock could reply, one of Moriarty’s henchmen struck him from behind, leaving him dazed and confused on the slippery floor of the room. He was going to lose consciousness soon, could barely keep his eyes open. All he saw before everything darkened was John being dragged back to the chair and Moriarty’s polished black shoes directly in front of his face.
. Who would miss him? He had wondered. The skull that Mycroft obtained for him? The maids that came and went? Who in their right mind would spend days at a time mourning Sherlock Holmes?
“Who is there?” He asked before he swung open the door and found a man staring back at him with two younger men standing on both sides.
“How are we to get him to communicate?” John muttered to Sherlock.
“This is no good at all, the horses cannot travel in these conditions! I shall have to postpone the meeting, how delightful.”
John pointed to Sherlock, who cradled his injured wrist in his other hand and hoped that the man would not try to harm John.
He knows what danger follows him with expensive shoes and a rustle of clothes, but he does not know what danger lies ahead. Every corner, every change of direction, sends a new wave of nausea through him as his mind too lividly imagines strong hands of faceless men grabbing him by his arms and pulling him into the shadows.
“He said you’d know where to find ‘im,” Greg continues and when John’s confused frown only deepens, he sighs annoyed.
John does know, and the insight makes him feel even worse.
“What?” Sherlock immediately turns to him, gnawing his lower lip. “Don't you like it? I had some of these things bought especially for you. If you don't like it, we can change it.”
“How about giving me a treasure map with a big, red X next time, then?” John mutters, and Sherlock chuckles.
“Jacket stays on,” Sherlock orders as he turns the key and the engine dies. “They have already seen you. If they are like a pack of wolves in your eyes, do not let them see you frightened or ashamed.”
John freezes and slowly turns back to look at him.
John's fingers take a tighter grip around the jacket and the man follows the movement with his gaze. For a moment they simply observe each other, the man with an expression of indifference and John with his fight or flight response threatening to take control.
Sherlock could not help but feel guilt at the woman’s words. He had told her to not disturb him, but there had been times where he would wish that she were at Baker Street with him, singing lullabies from childhood, cooking him bountiful meals whether he cared to eat or not. Just as she had naught but him, she was all he had left of his family as well.  He turned to see John handing their baggage to Jeanette.
“He hurt you.”
“Are we ready to make a purchase?”
John looked like he so desperately wanted to say something but he could not find the words. Sherlock took a seat on the edge of the bed and waited patiently for John’s response. It took him nearly five minutes to finally ask.
Sherlock’s lips tightened and John fought the urge to embrace Sherlock once he saw the brunet’s pout.
“You do understand his reasons for his poor behavior?” He was not excusing the way Sherlock acted while Sebastian was at Baker Street. He could not bear the thought that the love of his life and his kin could not care for each other. To his relief, Sebastian nodded and smiled.
“I’ve got all night, Sherlock.”
“Thank you. I would like to sample your other dishes as well, I am sure they are delicious.”
“Why must you put yourself down?”
Sherlock smiled.
And lastly, thank you to my wonderful co-author Chanolay who is such a busy woman and I'm so glad she thought me and my little AU fic worth her time. She is great at capturing  Victorian speech, and she wrote John so beautifully, as well as the smut scene, I just couldn't stop rereading those chapters! Thank you so much and I wish you nothing but happiness in life!
