DEMONS? WHAT! LORE? WHAT!
Dean was heavy...heaving...just like earth. The perfect, intoxicating embodiment of God’s favorites. The blade buried deep into his vessel’s ribcage, and Dean’s clenched fist slid past the handle of it, pressing against his chest. The naivety of humans. Castiel smiled. There was purpose in Dean Winchester, and that was what he sought. His brothers
Dean looked at Cas like he was a fortress, and… well, it sunk under his skin. He was magnetic. Made Castiel realize he was still an angel standing in a hotel room with a man who had been touched by hell. The angel saw it in his eyes, just behind the sincerity was something deeply broken. Dean prayed a
Dean stepped back but Castiel’s wings shooed him in closer, guiding him until he was just inches away from the angel, close enough to feel his body heat acutely. Their warmth mingled in the air and he drew in a small, breathy gasp. Suddenly, he understood why angels were considered warriors of god.
Dean looked away, blood still on his lip. He swallowed, knee bouncing. “Yeah. I don’t trust you as far as I can throw you, but I don’t want Lucifer walking above ground, either. So the plan is still on.”
Castiel  was left with more questions than answers.
"I've been looking—  there's a small house by a lake, a state over. It's small, but I've been keeping tabs on it the past year. No one lives there. I think it's available."
"Of course." Dean stands and this is still new to him, foreign. But he wants to try. God damn him, he wants to try so badly his heart is fit to burst. "If," Dean takes a breath. Then another. His eyes close. He hopes Cas has opened his. "If you'll have me?"
Can anyone else smell the beginnings to a plot so insane.....
Cas's thumb rubs gently along the sharpness of his cheekbone, where it had used to be soft and he'd hated the roundness of his face. He's older now. So much older. But there's Cas, anyways. The god damn angel. The one who got away. Again and again. It's just his imagination but he can feel the hilt of that demon blade in his hand, where he'd buried it right into Castiel’s heart. He has the thought now, 12 years later, that he's so earnestly grateful that it hadn't killed him. Now his hands are for something else. He's learning that. He's a slow learner, but he is. He's gonna.
He chokes on an inhale. "You mean that?" He's pushing his luck. This is a dream. He's going to wake up.
The angel fluttered down into the chair. “Hello, Dean.”
"Never shoulda shown you that one."
"Apple."
I edited it for mistakes, and made one major change. Previous readers will know that Campbell is the other hunter in this chapter. He has been replaced for later plot reasons with the character Kubrick from the show. This shouldn't have any effect on the current plot of chapters 1-7. For obvious reasons later on, it felt weird to have the Campbells as characters unrelated to Dean.
"Thanks." Dean swallows a stone.
"Yes." Cas says, and Dean opens his eyes just to see the smile he can hear on Cas's voice. It's lopsided and toothy. "We need you."
One night, when he stood alone along a roadside after a night of gentle rain, wishing that the cars that sped by had the power to take his life like he was human, the gentle sound of wings fluttering closed startled him from his thoughts.
with him.
Cas exhales and looks away, pensive.
"She reminds me of someone very dear to me."
The first one he gave him was tiny, only three threads braided simply and the colors aren't really anything Dean would wear.
"Eileen and Sam, what they're doing here is good. It's needed. Turning it into a rehab for species capable of change. A hunter network. All the research they're doing. It's all I could've hoped for your brother after everything he's been through. But I worry that it won't be a good place to raise Jack."
If he was honest, he wasn’t sure he had a mind. For eons he had been empty, and surely there was no way things with minds could feel that way. Nothingness had dug a hole and grown somewhere inside.
(Taking a bit of a rest between chapters, because I'm also working on other projects... so this next one may come a bit later, but rest assured it is already well under way! I also want it to be longer and I think I need just a little more time for that.)
Cas builds a greenhouse in the bunker.
"Fine." Cas is only an inch shorter, so when Dean turns his head to look at him again he only has to angle his jaw down a centimeter before Cas's mouth is warm against his. It's soft, achingly sweet, and Dean melts into it, tumbling down and down and down and up and up and up. He always wants more. There's never enough. He pulls away.
Anna looked at him with pity. “Dean Winchester broke the first seal, Castiel. A righteous man shed blood in hell. And now he will help us stop it. There are forces at play that you do not yet understand. But you will.”
“Heya, Cas.” Dean rounds the corner with an awkward wave and stops dead in his tracks.
The longer he stood at the Winchesters’ side, the stranger and stranger he felt. He was as alien to them as they were to him. Everytime he spoke with the brothers it was like he took one step forward and three back to meet in the middle. To them, he was just another hunt waiting to happen, another monster under the bed. They just didn’t know what kind yet. Castiel didn’t know what he could do to guard them, what he could do to prevent the seals from being broken without a foundation of trust. Every command from heaven that he followed seemed to irritate both of the brothers. Castiel felt like he was grasping at straws.
He has no idea how, but somehow, somehow, he's kept his cool long enough to make breakfast without having a complete breakdown. Between his fingers he still feels the feathers and heat. The down near the skin. By his side he feels that same warmth, emulating off of him in comforting waves.
That's his husband.

"Yeah, Pumpkin?" He calls curious as to what caught his attention.
There’s something painfully domestic about it. The lazy afternoon light is lighting up the edges of his hair like a halo, sunlight sparkling through the mist from the pipes up above.
he could make it up anyways. Heaven and hell were not done with him just yet.
It's the first time they've broached the words said that day, that evil day seven months ago, when Dean's heart had shattered out of his chest onto the floor, and he'd dug his palms into his eyes so hard it bruised and his sobs hadn't been loud enough to pull Cas back. To bring him home. So he could hold him. So he could tell him- me too. With all his heart, the happiness was in the being.
(Apologies for the tense change, if you noticed. I promise to keep it consistent throughout each chapter but it appears I have no control over maintaining it throughout the fic as a whole.)
"I wouldn't ask you to leave here. I know this is the closest thing you've had to a home since you were four yourself but I hoped—  I hope you— "
Jack's four and a half now, and three of his teeth are missing. Dean eyes the peanut butter jar opened on the coffee table, and the spoon sitting right next to the coaster. Theres a patch trail of peanut butter where Jack has been setting the spoon down between bites. Jack slithers back over the couch and disappears. Sesame Street comes on and he loses all interest in the pie.
The moment his palm sealed against Dean's shoulder—  closed the final distance between him and humanity—  Castiel’s mouth fell agape. Dean was
“No, no.” Dean realizes he must look flabbergasted. He shakes his head, steps forward to run his hands through a particularly happy basil plant, brings his hand to his nose to smell it. “This is great, Cas.”
"Of course." Cas says, and he breaks the gaze and goes to sit back next to Jack, who's currently adding beads to one for Sam.
Dean glances in the side mirror and sees Cas showing him something technical and ducks his head smiling, finger rubbing over the new bracelet and he's lost in a thought, something about how home sits in the backseat of his baby.
"You and Dada are just like Bert and Ernie."
"Momma?" Jack's voice carries. He still stumbles every few syllables and frankly, a part of Dean hopes he never stops. He wishes he could keep him like this, just a while longer. Dean pulls his head away from Cas. Sesame Street is still playing and two familiar characters are on screen.
Dean pulled his hand back. “What are you doing here?” Cas felt it was less of a question and more of an accusation. “Do I have any privacy left, or do you feathered dicks have my location at all times?”
I think Cas would quietly, over time, build a green house in one of the hidden rooms of the bunker.
incomplete. That’s God’s will. Not mine, not heaven’s, not hell’s. That nothingness you feel will only grow. You’ll realize that before the end.”
Cas is standing in the middle of row after row of tables, all covered in plants and gardening tools. He’s wearing the old flannel Dean gave him. It’s thread bare, the pattern faded, and it’s covered in potting soil. He’s got a tomato vine in his hand, seemingly in the middle of transplanting it.
(See the end of the chapter for
He watched over the ancient city that would be dismantled by famine in only a matter of months, by God’s will. It was then that a first, diminutive seed of doubt planted itself in a dark place in his mind.
The man jerked upright, bringing the bottle in his hand down to the table so hard it broke. A stray piece of glass sliced into his palm and he winced, before his attention snapped to Castiel, eyes narrowed. He was upset. “Jesus,
It's a question with a thousand heavy answers. But he wants to hear them all the same.

Dean Winchester was calling out to him. He wasn’t sure if he had a mind, and
As clear as the sight of the galaxy from Heaven, a graveled voice prayed his name.

love him for this.
"Cas—"
EDITED: 9/19/21 for minor errors.
But they never did. Castiel was quick to realize it. They were enamored with Dean, and his brother Sam. These Winchesters were the toys, and Castiel was naught but the one who had brought them to the table to play with. In Heaven they spoke of the seals. Sixty-six of them. Cas wondered what could ever go so  wrong that they failed to stop sixty six attempts at releasing Lucifer. He said so.
Sparks flurried around him, catching and singeing the feathers of his ink-black wings. Hellfire stung, but he did not flinch—  if he misstepped here, everything he’d ever worked for would be gone. Castiel could not fathom what this human had done to earn the rack. He didn’t know why he was in charge of saving him, just that the order came from Father. This was Castiel’s moment to prove himself to the others. He would serve. He would become exalted in their eyes.
“There’re so many people who I thought I wouldn’t get to see again, not properly anyway, but nothin’ is gonna beat a hug from mom.” Dean sighed.
“What?” Dean looks up at the blue eyes, still bright even in the gloom of night.
“I knew getting you into pop culture was a bad move,” he grinned.
You can’t actually blame him for mom, he didn’t kill her, Dean.” Sam said, coming into Dean’s space and poking him in the chest. “You don’t get to decide what is and isn’t Cas’s fault. If Belphegor was really trying to absorb those souls he would have been unstoppable, remember when Cas was God? When he had that power? Right? You know… maybe, just maybe he was trying to stop that happening again? Maybe he’s the only one who has been as consistently on our freaking side in this messed up life we’ve had. Do you even want to think about what the dude has been through for us? He gave up an army for you. He’s died for us more than anyone should have had to. He took all my crazy after the cage, he took it all and suffered hell for it. He rebelled against
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean mutters, sinking into the cheap plastic leather seat of the car, “I’m never going to college anyway.”
“Dean Winchester?” A car pulls up beside him, “what’re you doing walking home in this? Couldn’t you get the bus?”
“That wasn’t the first time, Dean,” Cas frowned, “we first met when-“
, like that would be a weakness to him. Honestly, I think dad might have got violent. When he was alive. Not if he’d been around this whole time but you know. The early 2000s were a different time. He, dad, was the one who was teaching Dean how to be a man. And you know, he didn’t teach love or kindness. Dad had taught Dean with his fists, always fight first. Always finish the fight. That kind of stuff.”
Cas was sitting with a fishing rod hooked into the chair next to him; there was a cooler sat on his other side, and what might have been a book on top of it. Dean felt, all of a sudden, warm too warm. His jacket felt too tight, and his lungs felt as though they couldn’t quite take in enough air. The thing in his chest roared, as though it would climb out of him and make a terrible scene.
“I didn’t want to talk to him, Sam,” Dean sat down heavily on one of the chair, moving away from Sam. “I- I just… Part of me wanted to forgive him, you know? Tell him it was okay, that we’d work through whatever… that we’d deal with the hell Chuck’s gonna throw at us and we’d move on but… I- I- I just couldn’t. It was like my brain and my mouth weren’t connecting or something.”
“I wonder that even happened? Like for real happened?” Dean thought out loud, “I wonder when he started to Fall for real. D’you think he’ll be able to get any mojo back?”
“I.” Dean thought about going for a drive. He thought about taking the Impala (who looked so pretty in the golden sun) down long windy roads and never looking back. He itched with the feeling of it. “I think… I think I’m going to find Cas.”
Eventually, after what felt like hours of walking, Dean came to the edge of a small lake. The trees thinned and a sort of muddy beach started leading toward the shore. There were mountains surrounding the lake, gilded in soft sunlight. Water lapped at the edge of the lake a few meters ahead of him, there were boats out there in the centre, but they were too far away to be much but an afterthought. He looked slightly to his left. Sitting, on the edge of rickety looking jetty was a man in a trench coat. Dean stopped. Wondering if he should go and talk to the man, because obviously he knew who it was.
The path became more winding, twisting and lurching from left to right, but it didn’t feel like it was working against him. Dean felt more that this place was supposed to only be reached by people who really wanted to find it. He could hear the sounds of waves lapping against a shore far in the distance. The path continued on with the soft scent of pine accompanying him along the way.
“Uh, same,” Dean forgets to mention the fact that he’s likely not going to go back to school.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Definitely,” Dean nodded, “I didn’t
“Yeah, Sam, we both screwed up. But I was the one who told him he was dead to me. All I did was lose both my best friend, my mom, and my kid in one fell swoop; when it didn’t even have to be that way.” Dean said. “I told him he was dead to me. For a mistake that all of us made. I was around you when you were soulless, and I knew what Donatello was like; it wouldn’t have been much of leap. Sure, Cas should have told us, but… we should have known too.”
“Cas-“ Dean croaks, but he cannot turn his eyes away from Cas’s face, he is glued to the spot atop the bonnet.
“Well then.” Bobby made a gesture to the car, “go find him.”
“Dean,” Cas whispered, his eyes big and round and filled with love. And Dean was panicking slightly because every nerve in his body was screaming at him to kiss Cas, this was the moment right? The time was now, but Dean couldn’t move. He was trapped by Cas’s gaze. “You have to say it. I need to hear you say it.”
Dean walked towards the library, he hadn’t felt nervous going to talk to Cas for years, not like this. Palms sweaty, he wiped them on his jeans, hoping they would stop shaking; his heart was beating so fast he could see his shirt moving. That couldn’t be normal. His head felt like it was full of TV static, and his vision was greying, everything was becoming both pixelated and too in focus at once. He continued to walk to the library on legs that felt as stiff as room softened butter.

“Thank you,” he whispers.

he’s been keeping it, but it doesn’t matter. He’d brought it to Dean for maintenance every once in a while, so he knows it’s in good shape. Jack parks about halfway down the road from where the cabin is. He’s not surprised about that, either. Jack likes the walk. He’s surprised he drove the truck in the first place. Maybe he wants him to take another look at it. He returns his attention to the porch as he hears the car door slam and Scrapper comes charging back to the porch with the stick.
to do the right thing. I mean, hell, we’ve all done some bad shit, but you still just… believe so strongly that there’s a right thing. You throw yourself in the path of danger over and over for the right thing and don’t get me wrong, I don’t like that martyr bullshit in you any more than you like it in me, but the impulse is just. What makes you you. I think you’re good. I think you’re the best thing that ever happened to me, but I think you’re good on your own, too. You just… you just glow with it, you know? And I always wondered,
“He has a Prius. Dean thinks it’s ridiculous.” Jack nods sagely. “I’ll drive.”
It’s small. It’s enough.
One day, at some point (time is so hard to tell here), Dean tells him all he would have had to do is ask, and if he had a heart he would feel it in his throat, and if he had a body he would use it to crawl to the Empty that is wearing his friend’s face and he would beg to be allowed home.
“Yeah.” The road up to the house is long, just as he’d wanted it. The single story cabin made of wood with a long roof extending over a porch and propped up with wooden columns sits right next to the lake, a little dock extending out into the water. The cabin is surrounded by trees, nobody for miles. Dean remembers when Sam and Bobby helped him build the shed nearby to hold his fishing gear, lots of bitching back and forth about who was supposed to be holding what nails. Doesn’t look too bad, kinda surprisingly. “Me, too.”
“Yeah, I know. Thanks.”
“No. I built it. I’ve been thinking about building.” He sits next to Castiel, holding a chocolate ice cream of his own. “I’d like you to help me, if you wouldn’t mind.”
“Yeah, well. You know there’s good therapists up here?”
Dean grits his teeth and looks down at Cas. He always looks smaller, Dean thinks, when he’s been knocked out of commission. Something about him that just makes him want to curve over his body protectively so nobody can hurt him again.
Castiel sits on the bench and stares at the little town, eyes a little wet.

“Now what?”
“Oh, I’m
Except he can’t. He gets raised out of the River Lethe by one man, time and time again.
“You’ll know.”
But seconds pass and nothing happened, so Dean slowly lays down on the couch and closes his eyes, waiting slowly for sleep to come.
“Are you ‘Parent Trap’ing me and Dean?” he says without preamble.
. There’s a
“Hello, Sam.”
It flicks its pointer finger off its thumb and Castiel goes shooting backwards, only to land on the ground with a thump.
“Let’s go to the mall.”
Cas’s smile widens a little. “Me, too. I like my truck.” He looks around. “It’s nice here. I pictured it nice but it’s nicer.”
“We can
He smiles, looking out at the look.
“So Sam and Eileen have a dog?” Castiel asks eventually, feeling a little guilty he hasn’t asked after Sam earlier. He knows this. But he needs to ask something and he doesn’t know where to start.
Castiel drops the bags of clothes and strides forwards, colliding with Dean in a hug. Dean takes a few surprised steps back but then returns the hug just as warmly, squeezing Castiel tight. He presses his face into the juncture between Dean’s neck and his shoulder.

“The fuck is a
“Stay. If you wanted to stay, you could stay. I, um. I… want you to stay.”
“Charlie also says you’re both kind of emotionally constipated but that you’re trying.”
Dean turns to Jack. “Jack, can you get me in the door?” Jack hesitates. “If the answer’s no, it’s no, buddy, I’ll figure something out.”
“We will never discuss that statement again.”
Charlie stands and heads into the kitchen to grab a couple paper towels. She maneuvers around the dining room table, graciously not mentioning the stacks of books and meticulous notes that are there. “You seen

“What about you?”

Mostly Castiel works on building little cities, big cities, great expanses of woods. He and Jack work together sometimes, and sometimes he helps Meg inspect where the walls were, which is mostly an excuse to walk around with Meg. He keeps himself busy, tries not to think about anything, like the look on Dean’s face before he was pulled away, or the vulnerability of the confession he had left hanging out there. It’s better to build a skyscraper than it is to think too much about it.
“Shut up.”
“In one of the drawers in the kitchen.”
Castiel blinks, a little startled by his real name from Meg.
“Yeah, so. I’m working through it.” Dean grins. “Didn’t you once tell me
Cas considers, his smile becoming a little wryer.
“Cas, if it was the other way around, I’d be in the Impala halfway back by now.” He tilts his head back against the wall, unable to stop staring at the gentle white and yellow of the daffodils against his wall. “I’ll make sure to text you a couple times today, let you know I haven’t fallen and can’t get up.”
“Yeah.” Dean smiles faintly. “Yeah, me, too, Cas.”
“Is there something supernatural in town that requires our attention?”
Sam pulls it out along with a pen and pulls up one of the chairs. “So let’s get cracking.”
“You’ve worn flannel and band shirts from when I’ve known you into death, Dean.”
“Ooooh,” Charlie whispers. “We’ve got a badass over here.”
“It’s not rocket science to figure out that Labs aren’t that smart, Dean.” He slaps him on the back before he pulls back. “But it’s good to see you, too, Dean.”
“Hey, fuck you, Cas. I can run fun circles
“That was
“I… hadn’t really gotten that far.” This is something he should have thought of. Can he just build a closet for himself somewhere?
“Yes.”
“Next couple days,” he says. “I promise. I’ll talk to him in the next couple days.”
The position he’s in is currently pretty untenable as far as his body goes. “Alright, Cas, you gotta help me up here, this hurts and it sucks.”
“Yes. I’ve only driven a couple times before. This is nice.”
one more time.”
“Why?”
“Then we were,” Cas says. “And then we were married.”
” The words are ripped out of him. “Castiel, I can’t because it’s the
“Dean doesn’t even know I’m here. There’s precedence for angels visiting humans in their dreams. It’s the only way I was able to come.”
“That’d be good for him.” She stands up. “I’m getting a napkin, do you want one?”
” Dean rolls his eyes. “Sign of how much I like that kid that I’m willing to put a veggie burger on my grill.”
“We’re gonna start out at a community college and see how it goes.”
“Do you think I’m doing a good job?” he asks.
Dean snaps his fingers. “
One of Meg’s eyebrows arches and she takes one hand off her magazine (but not her eyes) to take the pretzel, sliding her hand so it rests on the spine and she can read and eat at the same time.
“I.” Dean clears his throat. “It’s, uh. It’s a little weird, Cas. But it’s... fine.” Cas gives him a suspicious look. “Look, am I a guy who beats around the bush? If I wasn’t fine with it, I’d tell you.”
“I required emphasis and attention.” Jack is scowling and it’s the most he’s ever reminded Castiel of a teenager.
Dean comes back to the Bunker to see Sam reading a book at the table.
“I think, perhaps,” he says, just a little bit too dry to be convincingly earnest. “It may be time for a wardrobe change.”
you and whatnot.”
“Yes.”
Dean sprawls out on the seat next to him in the bowling alley, legs outstretched. They’re both on one of three benches by their lane. “Nobody likes the shoes.”
“I’ll call.”
People are crowded around tables, some of them he recognizes and some of them he doesn’t. Bobby is in deep conversation with Ellen. Jo raises a beer in hello. Charlie is avidly discussing something with Kevin.
ideal heaven, Charlie.”
“They’ll like this change.” Jack pauses, lowering his ice cream. “Do you think it’s selfish of me to go and see my mother first?”
“I want to stay,” Cas whispers.
Castiel feels the tips of his ears redden somewhat. “Thank you.”
And even if he
And there he is, behind the bar.
“What were you going to do today?”
What if he sorta kinda maybe wants to tell Cas he doesn’t mind?
and your
“Doc Holliday was kickass, man, I don’t wanna hear it.”
“So,” Dean says eventually. “Are you… okay?”
“That is awful,” he mumbles.
Dean takes a breath.
” Dean scowls. “I’m gonna kick his ass.”
Castiel reaches over and sweeps his hand, and with the sweep the air shimmers and suddenly looks just like it had before.
“What would have happened,” Castiel asks, keeping his voice steady through sheer force of will. “If I had asked?”
“Cause it sure as shit wasn’t Sam, Sam’s whole deal is he likes to buy me vegetables cause he thinks one day I’m magically gonna eat them.”
“Yeah, in a little bit.”
Three days later, after slow and less slow kisses, linked hands as they drove on back roads, curling up in the same bed, exhausted from the road, Dean left to go get coffee for him and Cas when he stumbled across a pawnshop.
“I wish Sam had never introduced you to HGTV.”
“Got these,” Dean said, putting them on the little piece of furniture the TV rested on. This was a bad idea. He was already acutely aware of what a bad fucking idea this was. His stomach wouldn’t stop clenching. “Little sign in the window says it’s one of the best restaurant in the area according to the newspaper. Course, it could be a really shit newspaper, so-“
Jack would never. He won’t. He wouldn’t. Castiel can’t make that promise.
“My overeagerness,” Cas finishes, a little sourly.
Meg makes a
“Want me to show you the rest of the house?” Dean asks, and Castiel could have sagged with relief.
“He does,” Eileen confirms. “But he’s trying.”
. It’s not the same thing as anyone else doing it. So it’s fine.
Castiel can’t help the smile that flickers across his face, even with how generally unfunny he’s found it when Dean passes. “I thought you’d earned them.”
Cas looks amused as he opens up the shotgun door to the Impala. “You would think that it’s hilarious.”
Jack and Cas walk towards the cabin, Cas dressed just like he ever is. When Cas sees him, he falters.
Castiel swallows. All these little human tics he picked up on Earth to associate with emotions. The butterflies in his stomach. Ridiculous.
Dean gets up and grabs his ball, heading for his turn. Meg leans in.
“It’s, uh.” Dean looks down. “It’s a good job you’ve done here, Cas.”
“Will I see you again?”
“Unless he won’t.”
“You’re mad.”
“Take care, Sam,” he whispers.
“I… yes. I am.”
Sam doesn’t look up. “A book on the history of paper.”
Dean swallows, staring up at him, eyes wet.
Castiel glowers. “You vex me.”
Bowling is a curious team sport, Castiel thinks, in that there is nothing either person can particularly do to help the other when it’s their turn. There’s no communal strategy, really, nothing other than trusting the other person to do their best.
Cas sits at the dining room table, looking out the window while Dean gets him a glass of water. He gently puts it down next to him and sits in the chair next to him.
There’s a soft whooshing sound and Jack walks out from the hallway to where the bedrooms go, sitting in the armchair to Eileen’s right. She absently gives him a pat on the shoulder, eyes still on Dean.
“I’m trying a… hands-off approach. I’m restoring things to how they should have been and then I’m stepping back.”
“Yes,” Cas says dryly. “That does sound like me.”
It’s uh, what do you call it, blue resin! I always thought these things were
“Mistake,” Dean mumbles.
Jack looks up from his book.
“Oh. Well. I still might do the other thing.”
. Cas rarely gives gifts, although he seems endeared by the concept.
“Barf,” she whispers.
Normally, Castiel would be suspicious that this is a trick somehow brought on by Chuck but it is undeniably Jack. He knows it in his bones, in his Grace, is absolutely positive that this can be no one other than his son, and the relief of it makes him sag.
“Asters.”
Charlie looks, abruptly, like someone who has just remembered she was not supposed to tell someone something.
So Dean stops asking what’s going on with them, except to ask what kind of flowers they are. They flow in through his room, red camellias and red and yellow tulips and short little sunflowers. He keeps watering his ferns and he throws out the dead flowers and puts new ones in their place.
“I lived with my dad almost my whole young life,” he tells her. “Couple of times I went off on my own, but almost all Dad. Then almost all Sam. Even when Sam was gone, I was with Lisa. I think I gotta live on my own for a while, Charlie. It’s…” he struggles to find the words. He’s trying to do this, open up a little more, piece by piece, but it still feels like pulling teeth. “It’s good for me to have my own space. I like it. I like the feeling of nobody being around for miles but me and Scrapper.”
“Dean,” Sam says, sounding gentler than Dean has any patience for right now. “He’s-“
“Case in point.” Castiel puts a hand on his shoulder. “I would tell you if I saw signs of concern, Jack. But I don’t see anything. I see you, as you’ve always been.” Jack gives him a very quiet little look. “What?”
He looks up to see a triumphant Dean, grinning and looking entirely too pleased on his part. “Did you just kick me?”
fucked up-“

got thoughts.” Castiel can’t take a step these days without someone asking him about when he’s going to talk to Dean. It’s one of the reasons he likes cities, at this point- plenty of people don’t know that he knows Dean.
“I think new clothes are in order,” Castiel says decisively, and Jack brightens up, pausing on the trail and turning to him.
He looks around the antiseptic white room, all grays and flat opaque windows, and his stomach plummets.
done drinking,” he mumbles. “I just do it less.”
“No, me neither. Jack offered to remind me of it, but I declined.”
Jack looks immediately guilty, like he didn’t know he wasn’t supposed to say that. “Oh. Um. No?”
because ultimately, he’s gonna need it.
“Psychology,” Eileen answers. “I want to be a shrink for other hunters. God knows we need one.”
“You know,” she says, coming up to stand next to him. “The boys forgave John.”
“When you… yes. Yes.” Castiel looks around again. “Jack, what
After a little while he hears footsteps and he looks up to see Meg and Charlie approaching him. Charlie’s cheeks are wet and Meg’s face is motionless, which tells Castiel enough about what she’s feeling. They come walking up and stand next to him for a second before Charlie gives Meg a hand to help her ease into sitting on his right and Charlie sits on his left. Charlie scoots a little closer and rests her head against his shoulder.
, but it’s not the game plan. It’s not how he gets him back.
“We don’t have any need of money up here.”
“I have something of a soft spot for Castiel. He was so… funny. A funny little angel with a funny little human who didn’t know how to talk about their funny little lives.”
Castiel paces around Heaven a few more days.
“Meg seems like a smart lady.”
Cas smiles and reaches out to scratch the top of Scrapper’s head. Scrapper happily noses at his hand. “Hello, Scrapper.”
He supposes he’s never been anything other than obvious, it’s simply that Dean never noticed.
“Yeah, me, too.” Dean looks around, satisfied. “Nice little setup.” He leans against the back wall, arms folded. “Jack says you’ve been keeping an eye on where the walls are.”
She sniffs.
The thing he hadn’t thought about when he’d bought the flowers is that Cas would have to eventually wake up and see them.
The first thing Dean does when Charlie leaves is clean the kitchen, putting the plates in the small dishwasher. Then he throws all Scrapper’s toys back in the toy basket. One of these days he’s gonna figure out how to train him to put them back in there himself.
“Cas.”
“They’re cut and in water.”
He buys them anyway.
His knees buckle out from under him and his knees hit the dirt. Cas is jogging now and he skids along his knees to meet Dean on the ground. They collide with each other, chests bumping into each other as they hug tightly. He feels Cas bury his face in his shoulder and, a little dazedly, he puts a hand on the back of Cas’s head.
“Yeah. I know. Just thought I’d ask.”
Castiel closes the last few steps and pulls Jack in. Both of them go to the ground, Jack’s face buried in his shoulder as both of them cry.
Castiel blinks, looking up from his beer. Dean’s leaning against the back wall behind the bar at the Roadhouse, looking decisive.
“Sounds dumb.” He gestures. “Pass me the pizza box.”
“No. I don’t have any interest in using god magic for this.” Jack stretches a little. “I hope you enjoy the fish.”
“I believe in the end you may actually be good for one another.” He’s fairly certain it’s true and that he isn’t lying. “And whether or not I liked it wouldn’t matter anyway, as it is your happiness that is central to your wellbeing and not mine.”
“I’m sure he likes you, too, Charlie.”
“Heaven. Jack has asked me to help rebuild it. It was… less than ideal for its inhabitants previously. We’re… refurbishing.”
“No, Charlie, keep going.” Meg leans forwards. “Dig yourself out of this hole.”
Castiel appears in a rustle of wings to Jack, who’s sitting on the park bench reading a book that appears to be a
want to talk about it again, he won’t dump you on the curb.”
He looks out across the park. This day, it started raining, one of those thunderstorms that comes out of nowhere. They’d all run back to the overhang on the ice cream shop, Dean chanting “shit shit shit shit shit” as they went, everyone’s jackets pulled up over their heads. Even Castiel had done the same, unwilling to waste the energy on drying himself off once they reached a place with cover. Sam had told Dean to have the good sense to not shake himself like a dog once they reached the overhang. Dean had done so just to stick it to Sam and ruffled Jack’s hair, laughing when it stuck up all at ends.
“Hello, Dean,” he says, voice thin and sounding dangerously close to cracking.
Charlie grins. “Well, for one thing, there’s no avoiding or changing topics in
“Do you know what water looks like?”
“I’m going out,” he finally snaps, pushing back Sam. He stomps through the Bunker, stopping only to grab his keys and his wallet, and heads out the door.

wrong. Sometimes life just pulls some crap, alright? Sometimes it just screws you.” Dean turns to him. “Wasn’t your fault. And I’m gonna get him back. So quit beating up on yourself, sit your ass down, and eat some pancakes.” He points at him with the spatula. “I don’t give two shits about thwacking God with a spatula, Jack.”
The fuck is a
…didn’t Cas give him some red tulips?
Dean snorts, clearly amused. “Yeah, I bet you do.”
You’re not subtle. But neither is he, and he’s not subtle because it’s him, too, Cas.”
But that had gone… well. They hadn’t talked about it. But maybe Dean wasn’t ready to talk about it. Castiel isn’t sure he is, either. It had been good to simply… see Dean. To be standing there in his presence again, to joke with him. It had been enough. It’ll continue to be enough.
“Nothing is going on and everything is fine.”
“Okay, you get to carry the food.”
“Oh, yeah? How come?”
“Is this gonna be a thing with you?”
“Well. I think you’re probably bullshitting but whatever amount you’ve done, it’s good.”
Cas would beat you at air hockey.”
Meg cackles from the couch, turning her telenovela down and looking at them properly for the first time.
“Don’t tell me to buck up.”
“I’m sorry.”
“You really decided to use your one shot on me?” she asks. “Not Sam?”
“Right,” he says, a little unsteadily. “So it’s loud. If Cas comes with me, it stops being loud. And Cas, you know, he’s got an in with the man upstairs now, he ain’t ever coming back.” Even if Dean has to shake it into Jack. He doesn’t think he’ll have to. But he’s ready. “So if you let him come back, he’s gone from you, forever. And it’s quiet again. Forever.”
“That’s good to know,” he settles on.
“Alright then, was that so hard?”
“I didn’t linger, I was very respectful.”
When dinner’s done and it’s getting on near bedtime, Eileen announces she’s going to bed.
It’s a small room with
“I can do it on my own.” Jack gives him a half-hearted smile and then he’s gone. Castiel slowly gets to his feet and stands in the park for a second before he takes a step.
“No. I don’t know. Something… changed, after Samhain.”
“I’m gonna stay up for a while.” Dean puts away the controllers they were all using for Mariokart. “But you guys sleep well.”
“You knew?”
“You’re disappointed.”
“Thinking maybe working my way up to law school?” Sam shrugs. “Not sure yet.”
“We can cross that bridge when we come to it.”
He wants to go back to see Sam and Dean so badly it aches, but this isn’t several years ago anymore, when it was just the three of them, when it was just their lives.
Rowena blinks at him, part of her red hair piled on top of her head in an elegant bun. the rest cascading over her shoulder, wearing a long sleeved and long skirt black dress. “Since when do you wear those?” she asks, gesturing at
Dean snorts and puts his phone down just as Cecily says something along the lines of “and, well, you

Sam drops the book. It lands on the ground with a heavy
“He likes Meg. It’s kind of funny. She doesn’t know what to do with it.”
“Screw all of you.” Dean wipes his hands on a napkin after taking a bite of his BBQ wings. “You’re just jealous.”
“So I think we should rebuild. Give people the tools to make their heavens what they want them to be. Tear down the walls. It just requires… restructuring.” Jack looks at him. “I’d like you to stay.”
line. “Go for it.”
Cas reaches out and takes Dean’s hand. Dean tangles their fingers together. He passes Cas his beer with his free hand and Cas takes it, taking a sip.
Dean just sits there for a moment, eyes closed, and a part of him thinks that maybe it’s just what Cas was waiting for, maybe he’ll hear that soft whooshing of wings and the
“They’re
“…eventually, yes, I will.”
“I bet you think you’re real funny,” he says.
, wrapping around the house. He can see two chairs by the door to the house, as well as maybe a little end table between them.
Jack watches him.
Castiel takes a bite of his eggs. “
Dean scowls. “I liked you better when you hadn’t discovered your sense of humor.”
They must have lost. He wonders where Sam and Dean are, where Jack is, what Chuck could have possibly pulled him out of the Empty for-
” She stands on her tiptoes and gently brushes them with a finger. “Look at you.”
“You were never a Scout.”
“Yes. So were you.”
Castiel frowns. “It can wait.”
It’s something. “Thank you.”
“It’s not right,” Charlie mumbles.
Her voice gets smaller. “Dean didn’t want to come?”
Dean looks thrown and then gives him one of those grins so wide it baffles Castiel that it all fits on his face.
“I dunno what you’re hobnobbing about over there,” Dean says, facing the lane. “But you should all be watching me and my awesomeness.”
He’s tried on several outfits and something about them has always been off. He hasn’t been able to figure out what, but he’s looked in the mirror and known something wasn’t right. Perhaps this was a mistake. The previous outfit hadn’t felt right, either, but at least he knew why.
The Roadhouse is bustling. He can hear it from the outside, a bunch of cars pulled up and lingering in the parking lot. He takes a moment to steel himself before he lets himself in.
“Charlie seems like she’s doing well,” he says, rummaging around in his dresser for sweatpants and a tee shirt. “Lighter and happier than I’ve seen her for some time. Which is pretty cool.” He finds them and tugs his shirt off. “Nice to just hang out and shoot the shit with someone about TV, you know? I can’t remember such a long stretch of mostly being able to just shoot the shit with people. I never got you into
“And it wasn’t-“ He starts talking with his hands. “It wasn’t like I didn’t
“I, uh.” She takes a breath. “Kaia is… wonderful. And I’m so happy she’s back. And everybody else is… helping. Or trying to help. There’s not a lot that’s helping right now. But they’re trying. And I just… I want you to not… worry about me. Cause I know I’m gonna be alright. It just… feels like I’ll never be alright again right now.” She kicks at the floor again. “I’m running low on parental figures, Cas, losing two more isn’t helpful.”
“I’ll make us some dinner.” Dean disappears out the door and Castiel heads to the record player. He pulls out a copy of the Bleachers MTV Unplugged album, sets it up, and starts pulling his clothes out of his bags.
“Nobody’s killing anybody,” Castiel says flatly. “Everybody be nice to each other.”
“I think I knew you were here,” Claire says.
The three of them lean forwards as one.
“You’re probably not helping your mysterious image when you drive this thing around, you know.”
Dean grins and takes a picture of his foot, propped up on several pillows on his bed.
“I lied.”
“Doesn’t matter.” Dean squeezes his hand. “This is what I want to do now.”
“Yeah. Don’t see why not. I’m going to get a snack. You want anything?”
Dean gapes at him for another moment, then shakes himself out of it and sits down next to him with his notebook.
“Don’t tell me he’s fine, Sammy, I’ll lose my fucking mind.” Dean points at Cas, laying very still and unconscious on his bed, face pale. “He’s
“What do we need to do?” Sam asks.
“So you just convinced yourself that there was just, there was something you couldn’t have. And it never occurred to you to ask.”
” he mimics. “What, are you Sam now?”
Castiel is building a city. He likes building cities. He had always felt a certain sense of wonder being in them, the ability to watch humanity at its finest, simply… being humanity. He carefully lays sidewalks, builds house, places fire hydrants just so.
“I mean, it’s not
Jack kicks his feet a little against the ground.
Cas stared down at them, bewildered.
pinball intensely.
“No. I don’t, either.” He’ll only return once Dean’s time has come, if Dean will have him back. Home is, Castiel had learned quite some time ago, wherever Dean is, even when he has been forced to leave it. “But I suppose I’m going to figure it out.”
“The backup thing or the-“
“Smash Bros,” Sam adds.
told me that I should expand my palate. You did not say, specifically, that this would be good.”
“Of course.” He looks over at Dean. “I’d tell you if I’d heard anything.”
Castiel pokes another fry into his ketchup. “Have you… seen him?”
“Yeah, well.” Dean shoves his hands into his pockets. “Kinda nice to look at, huh.”
“Oh, boy,” she whispers.
Jack walks off and Castiel begins to wander through the store. He would have vaguely expected everything to be something that would specifically cater to him, but perhaps that would be boring. He picks up a few pairs of jeans and a few pairs of regular black pants. Jack returns with an armful of graphic tee shirts and pushes him towards a fitting room. He discards some things without trying them on, tries some things on and immediately discards them. The outfit he settles on is a pair of jeans that fit him nicely,
don’t be talking to-“
“And?” Sam asks.
“Yes. Well.” Cas sounds a little embarrassed.
“Well.” Castiel stretches his legs out. “People are happy, aren’t they? The people you’ve met here?”
Jack smiles. “I would love some pancakes.”
,” he’d said, and lunged in for a kiss.
“I like…” he thinks it over, what he most associates involving comfort and home. “I like what Sam and Dean wear. But I think something a little… different? I want less… flannel. Some flannel. But less flannel.”
He did, didn’t he?
“Everyone knows, genius,” Meg says. “You think Dean Winchester is just gonna die and everybody he ever knew won’t know it?”
“Wandering around the magnitude and majesty of creation.” Jack sits on a stool. “Beholding the wonder of the world.”
Castiel looks back at the ice cream parlor. He wants to know if Dean’s alright. Wants to know it like an ache in his chest. He wants to know every little thing about Dean, every little bit of the last three weeks of his life that he missed, how he’s doing now. But he’s not going to ask his son to play go-between. It’s not fair. “It looks good, Jack. It’s nice.”
“Just remnants.”
“Don’t feed my dog shit. He gets two meals every day.”
“Cas thinks you fell down some stairs.”
Castiel takes another bite of his ice cream.
“Thanks.”
Dean takes another deep breath. “Do we have to?”
The thing is, it
“I’m gonna stay here with Cas while he works on the walls.”
Dean swallowed.
This isn’t the whole truth, naturally.
fail.”
Castiel hesitates, then slowly puts his beer down on the little table in between them, stomach clenching.
Jack shrugs. “I need more help rebuilding Heaven. There’s not enough angels left. I brought some people back. I don’t.” He stops and starts again. “I would never tell you that you couldn’t go back, Castiel. I’m just asking you to… stay for a little while. Time moves different in Heaven. It wouldn’t be more than three weeks for them. Maybe a month, at most.”
“I was. In a manner of speaking. It’s complicated.” Hesitantly, he rests a hand against the back of her head, same as he might do for Jack. “I’m sorry.”
at you after Purgatory?”
Jack stops the car and they get out.
“It is.” Jack takes a turn up a long road. “I thought about asking them if they wished to accompany me at any point, but I travel in a different way than they would, and I think they’ve had enough of travel anyway. It’s time to put down real roots. Sam and Eileen are in a nice little house square in the middle of a town and Dean is out this way, and everyone in the towns that know them thinks they are a little strange but kind. It’s the sort of life they’ve earned.”
He’s landed in a cornfield. He doesn’t know where he is but knows it can’t be anything other than Earth. He makes his way to his feet and just starts stumbling in front of him, hoping that the end of the field is nearby somewhere. Eventually he can see blue sky and a road poking around the edges of the corn and makes his way out, coming to a stop abruptly at the edge.
When she does notice him, she doesn’t jump but instead blinks.
Jack smiles.
“I mean.” Dean drums his pen on the table. “Charlie’s kinda danced around it, Rowena’s asked a little about it, Bobby’s… flat out said it. But you haven’t said I’m crazy. Or that I’m gonna fail.”
Castiel slowly lowers his tea, staring at her.
Castiel can
“Hey,” Dean says as Castiel answers “untrue”.
Castiel surveys the menu. It seems to be pretty standard brunch fare. “What do you get?”
“Okay,” Eileen says. “Fuck it. Let’s go.”
“It was nice to meet you.”
“Sam is grieving. But it is not the first time he’s grieved a heavy loss. Or even Dean’s loss. You are… younger. You deserve a certain… modicum of comfort.”
“I don’t know what air hockey is.”
Dean feels his lips twitch as he looks to the right a little bit. “Sure does.”
Scrapper stares at him, his stick in his mouth. Dean grins and takes it, tossing it into the woods. Scrapper charges after it.
“Hey, that’s fantastic.” He inclines his Coke towards her. “Congratulations. Do I have to buy you a housewarming present or something?” He’s heard that’s something that people usually do.
Cas looks up with a smile. “I like who you are.”

“I think we’re low on options,” he says finally. “And I think it’s worth a try.”
“I.” He looks down at his hands. “I have all this
“The thing that pisses me off about you is that you are just so…
“Tell me,” Castiel says, summoning a reservoir of infinite patience. “About

the ones that have the most bacon and cheese on them.”
Dean blows all the air out of his cheeks.
“I- I-“
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Point is, if it was just this, I’d be more worried. But it’s not just this. You’re just… doing what I’d do. And living as close to how you’d want as you’d like.”
“Yeah,” he answers distantly. “Yeah.” He snaps the notebook shut and speaks more decisively. “Yeah.” He stands up. “Okay, we’re going into the living room.”
Dean blinks, a little thrown. “What?”
“Right, eventually, but.” He stares very hard at the wall. “Maybe, uh. Maybe one of us isn’t so good at… talking about feelings. And they need a little while to work up to it. So they need to take… small steps before they go around… verbally admitting to something.”
“Yeah, for
“…fair enough.”
Dean clears his throat, pushing the menu at him. “I’m serious, man, you should try something else. We’ll split the calamari. You get to broaden your tastes too, you know.”
“Meg says there’s no real work left to do and you’re just doing it because this whole concept stresses you out.”
Dean pulls him in for the hug he’s looking for. “Travel safe.” He can’t help but say it even though he knows Jack is pretty much incapable of
Dean coughed out a bark of laughter. “You first.”
The drive over is mostly spent quiet. Jack plays Carly Rae Jepsen over the radio. Castiel watches the landscape out the window buzz by.
and he keeps
“Not yet. Time is… fluid in Heaven. We’ll see each other again.” He keeps his voice firm. There’s no reason for Claire to know his doubts and anxieties on the subject of reuniting with Dean. Claire needs the image of a united front.
“I was… immediately sucked into the Empty on doing so.”
“It is
You both suck.”
“Of course.”
“Most everybody. Why?”

when you left!”
“Are these what I’m assuming they are?” he asked slowly.
“I don’t think I know how not to be anymore.”
“I’ve liked meeting their friends. I like Meg. She seems… sexy.”
It’s terrifying, and he tries to bury the thoughts as best he can while Dean mumbles about the benefits of fresh dill for the potato salad versus dried dill, weighing them each in his hands in the grocery store.
from Dean and a delighted cackle from Sam. It had been a normal moment in the middle of their chaotic lives, something soft that he’s always kept close to his heart. “This wasn’t here before.”
Jack leans back. “What if the angels are just
Castiel blinks, thrown. “What?”
“You don’t have to say yes.”
“How goes looking for schools?” he asks. “Did you guys figure out what you want to do?”
Castiel spins on his heel to see Jack standing, raising a hand with a smile on his face.
“Then I’ll help,” Castiel says, and Jack beams, looking relieved.
“You just keep pulling.”
“Jack, you don’t need to tell me-“
“Right. Back to Dean.” Charlie dips a French fry from the plate of them that’s suddenly appeared into her milkshake. “End of the world do anything to get one of you to talk about it?”
Cas doesn’t look up from one of those romance novels he enjoys for some reason. “You require more color in your room.”
“You could have asked, Cas,” he says, and for a second, he thinks he might leave it there.
The door opens and John comes jogging out of it. He smiles at Castiel, holding out a hand.
“I… uh…” Dean wasn’t looking at Sam anymore, he was back to staring at his hands, which still shook, tremors running through them from his wrists to the tips of his fingers. Sam hadn’t seen Dean look so distressed since Mary’s death, but the emotions his brother was fighting this time were different. “I don’t know.”
“Is it his rugged good looks or his wicked sense of humour?” Dean asked, wondering if they both knew that they weren’t really talking about Han Solo.
“Dean?” Nick touches him on the shoulder, Dean almost thinks that the heat of his touch is going to leave a handprint burned into his skin there. “We can just play Super Mario if that’s what you wanna do.” That’s not all Dean wants to do, but he nods and gets up anyway, throwing the t-shirt he brought with him over his shoulder.
“Hello, Dean,” there’s a knock at the door, Cas comes in, looking at little sheepish.
Can’t believe you’re in Auburn, come chill with me! ;-) I’ll be home at 5.
“I prayed too, not sure if you’d have got them, but…”
“I…” Dean realises that Cas is referring to his trip down memory lane, “You heard that.”
I have seen the truest evil of the human race, and it’s best creations, but none of that matters to me. None of it. Because you are sitting here in front of me,” Castiel stops, and it is just then that Dean realises how old and how very not human he is. “You turned me from the very purpose I was created for. You. Not Sam. Not my father. You. And I have been told all my life that falling is painful. That our wings burn and all we know is fire. Yet, I have not felt that. All I have felt is an all-encompassing love. Tell me, if you are so evil, how could that be the case?”
They were sitting opposite each other, the space between them too much and not enough all at once. It was like facing down a bear, Dean wanted to move but he also didn’t. He wanted to speak but also he didn’t.
“I need a little more time,” Cas said, “I need to figure myself out. It hasn’t been so long for me. Feeling these things. I am not so well versed in human feelings as I thought if I am just working these things out now.”
He’s setting up his room in the bunker, when he finds it, in the box that he keeps the more embarrassing things in. A polaroid, taken nearly twenty years ago, of a boy with gold hair hanging down around his face, like Brad Pitt. Dean stops. The world rocking around him into a standstill. His whole awareness zeroes in on this picture. Slowly, shakily he runs his fingertip down the boy’s face. Dean remembers the way Nick felt, the way he had been awakened to a part of him he’d never known existed. They’d stayed in touch. For a few years at least. Then Dean’s John had found the emails, and Dean remembers the shouting that had followed. John had kicked him out of the motel, had given him a case on the other side of the country and had told him to stay away until he was ‘in his right mind’.
“Hmm. Still can’t believe that happened.”
“I do not consider your attraction to men a surprise Dean,” Cas smiles, softly, the barest upturning of the corners of his mouth. Dean tries to stop himself from staring. “I have been watching over you since you were young. I know every aspect of what makes you, you. Remember I rebuilt you from the ground up.”
The reason Dean likes Waffle House so much is that no matter where he is, he can always count of Waffle House to look like Waffle House. He gets the corned beef hash, which is the same thing he always gets along with a black coffee. Then, he just sits and soaks up the linoleum covered atmosphere. It’s just after three in the afternoon, and hash soaks up the last of his funds, but Dean can’t really bring himself to care as he eats the oily fried potato and beef that gets set down in front of him by a waitress.
“Dean,” Sam says hovering in the doorway to the small study area in Bobby’s house.
“No problem,” Linda smiles, “you let me know if you need anythin’ else, sugar.”
“Dean. Come on. You know. That wasn’t you being angry at a friend or a brother. That was more like a break up.”
“Got here not long ago. I guess you three are kind ‘a package deal, right?” Ellen said, “we’ll go ahead, give you guys a bit.”
Finally, after a lot of pain and a glass of water, Dean can talk. He’s still not allowed to sit up though, and he can already feel the restlessness prickling under his skin.
“We thought people would be disconcerted if they didn’t have to breathe,” Cas chuckled.
“Do you?” Dean turned to look at him and found himself falling again for the lines on his face and the scruff round his cheeks.
“Thanks,” he said, “for the soup, man. And for everything. You never had to do what you’ve done for me. And… uh you always showed up, dude.”
“So what?” Dean took the soup, “he makes me soup but won’t come talk to me? Yeah that’s real adult.”
to see the signs… So I just didn’t. I let myself blame Cas, thinking that would… I dunno. Absolve me of the horrible guilt I’ve been feeling, but what I was really doing… shit… I was pushing away someone I… someone I, you know, care about, I suppose.”
“Often,” his father sighs, “fate changes her mind.”
“I dunno, Jody, that sounds pretty gay.”
“Yes, father,” and Castiel goes.
“Oh yeah?” Dean snorts, taking a sip of his warm beer.
“Bobby?” Dean looked at the busted-up chair in front of the Roadhouse.
Dean stayed in his room for two days. He knew it had been two days because Sam had asked if he wanted breakfast twice. Both times he’d grunted and rolled over, ignoring his brother because interaction was far beyond his mental capacity at the time. Led Zeppelin had been constantly pouring out of his headphones, and food had been scavenged from whatever Sam left out for him. Which actually, hadn’t been that bad, a departure from the swill Sam usually cooked. The clock by his bed read a healthy three pm, when he surfaced, a full day after Sam had last asked Dean to join him.
“Don’t think so black and white. I never said you were gay. Dean, the way you talk about him, it sounds like you’ve been married for years,” Jody said, smiling just a little bit, she spoke like she was trying comfort a scared animal.
He shrugged, “Had to get up sometime, Sammy.”
“You get to see them all again. All of them.”
There’s a guy by the pool, finishing a cigarette which he stubs out on the edge, not caring that the ash drops in the water. He has blond hair, grown out like Brad Pitt’s. And well, Dean has eyes. He can tell that this guy is hot. Suddenly Dean feels all awkward in his old faded swim trunks (he’d bought them from Walmart two years ago, and they’re definitely tight). The guy looks up as they approach, he smiles at Sam. And, fuck, he looks Dean up and down a few times, with eyes that are a honey kind of brown. Dean is definitely panicking now.
“And I kicked him out, and told him he was dead to me,” Dean wanted to slam his face on to the steering wheel. “You know, when Kevin died, he told me that he should have been there. Even after he was
“It’s just… I saw you,” Sam blurts, his eyes going wide as he slaps a hand over his mouth.
Dean sat there for a while digging his fingers into his temples, “Shit.” He sobbed, the word was torn from his throat. He’d never really stopped long enough to examine his own emotions, had never really allowed himself to, if he was being honest. Dean supposed he could blame it on his dad, but he wondered (as he sat with his head on the table) if that was giving himself a free pass to being lazy. Blaming everything on his dad would sort of ignore the fact that he’d been an adult man for a rather long time, that he should have really looked at his behaviour and his emotions long before that moment. He hadn’t though. Every time it had come up, he’d skipped over it, ignored it and buried it deep down. Dean wasn’t even sure if Sam knew the depth of how he felt, not just about Cas.
“I think… I think it was his inherent humanity,” Cas leaned in, closer. So close, Dean could feel the puffs of his breath on his face. “How he was so very human, and how I was fascinated, and then as I watched he became something more. Brave, and kind, and clever.”
“I- I-“ Dean can’t seem to work his brain. It has obviously suffered a major malfunction, and now no longer knows what words are. He is scrambling to reignite the guilt inside of him, to remember how the pain he had become so used to feels.
“Yes.”
“We should probably talk, right?”
“Yeah, well, I believe it’s time for me to make my exit so you can stew over what we just talked about. Good chat, Dean. Good luck.” At this, Jody stood, she wiped her hands on her jeans and smiled down at him. “I think I’ll take the girls and Sam on a little trip to the movies for, oh, I don’t know three to four hours.”
“Yeah, sure,” Sam nodded, “so get this, I think I found us a case.”
“So,” Cas smiled, inclining his head.
266 Mell Street.
“It did take a long time,” Cas nodded. “though, I do appreciate you asking for me.”
Dean’s not really sure what else he and Nick talk about, but the afternoon turns very quickly into evening. They’re still by the pool talking when the sun makes a last effort to stay above the horizon. Somehow, they’ve migrated closer to each other, and now Dean is pretty sure he can feel Nick’s shoulder brush against his. Nick is laughing at something Dean’s said, and Dean is damn captivated by this boy, he can’t even remember what he’s said. The way Nick comes alive when he laughs is crazy, his face lights up, and he looks like he’s shrouded with something that’s not quite human. It doesn’t make Dean feel like ganking him though, which is new.
“You’re family. It’s different.” Dean grunted,
“Dean.”
“I can’t-“
“Good.” Dean can only manage single syllables now because his brain is too focussed on how much it doesn’t want to be having this conversation.
“Yeah we met,” Jo smirked, “we heard all about what you’ve been up to. A rusty nail? Really? Didn’t you like, help kill God or something?”
Dean choked.
They got home to the bunker, it seemed like it was empty apart from Cas, who sitting reading on a chair at the farthest end of the room. He didn’t have the trench coat on, instead he was wearing a plaid shirt and Jimmy’s pants; it was a weird combination but Dean thought Cas wouldn’t want to hear that from him. Instead of making some stupid joke, Dean slung his duffle over his shoulder and walked towards his bedroom. He could hear Sam great Cas as he walked away, which honestly made him feel like a piece of crap. As he always did, Dean decided to torture himself a little, he paused in the hall to listen to what they said.
“Yes.” Cas said, “we have all been through a lot. But, you have never been cruel, Sam. You have never hurt someone. Not like that.”
“Are you seriously pulling a Han Solo on me right now?” Dean laughed.
He staggers to the bed, thinking. Dean doesn’t even know what happened to Nick after the last time they saw each other, all he has is an old email. Somehow, he thinks, it would be wrong to dredge up the past again. He’s quite content to let Nick live in his memories. Perhaps, it would be too painful to see what adulthood had done to the boy with gold hair. His thoughts drift. It has been years since he’s thought of men. Years. He’d gone back to John, and more importantly, to Sam and had tried not to look at other boys again. It has become a habit. Even when John Winchester is long dead, it is a habit of Dean’s to not look. To turn his head in the other direction. He wonders what Nick would think of him now. Whether he’d be disgusted. Dean’s not sure he wants to know.
I’ll wait outside
It’s raining in LaGrange, Georgia, as Dean walks back to the motel, His dad had actually picked Sam up from his school but of course he’d had to go hunting so Dean’s left to trudge back through the storm. The wire chainlink fence by the side of the road is rusting, and the litter on the other side of it rots quietly away as Dean does his best to avoid the foul smelling plastic bags. He’s soaked through, of course, and what little school work he’d actually bothered with will be ruined by the time he gets back to the motel. It doesn’t matter anyway, as soon as his dad is done with whatever it is he’s hunting, they’ll move and Dean will never have to see the shitty brick façade of Callaway Middle School ever again.
“I’m not gonna kick you out, and I won’t shout at you. Just, maybe think about how you were talking about Castiel, cause it sounded like you were telling me about a break up; a break up between two people who were romantically involved. And I’m not calling you gay, but maybe you feel Castiel is more than a friend?”
“Sure…” He turned away, going back to his room, “and Cas?”
“Alright,” Dean waves him off, “just stay in the room okay?”
“You can’t what? Dean, I know you think you don’t deserve happiness. But that’s not true. You deserve to be happy, and if Castiel is going to make you happy… then maybe that’s what he’s waiting for.” Jody put her hand on his shoulder, her eyes were wide and her face had changed from a smile to down-turned, but soft frown.
“I.” Castiel takes a breath, keeping his eyes in front of him. “I appreciate the sentiment.”
Dean stops at a sizable place that may be nicer than any of the eateries they’ve stopped at previously. Castiel wants to rib Dean somewhat over the fact that this may be the first time he’s seen a cloth napkin, but he lets it go at how pleased Dean looks.
“I dunno. Just am, I guess.” He gives him what he knows has to be a slightly dopey grin. Cas looks amused and returns his attention to the paper. Dean keeps watching him for another few moments.
He scowls. “Shut up. They’re fine.”
“I don’t,” Meg says, putting her magazine down on the ground.

“I like the stools.” Rowena’s stool grows a long and elegant back that she settles into comfortably. Dean narrows his eyes. “You’d better change that back when you go.”
It rolls its eyes. “I’m

is something. Castiel worries about how much Dean feels the need to self-isolate after something traumatic, how prone he is to pushing people away. If he’s reaching out to Charlie, that’s good news.
“Which books were you working on?” he asks.
The bottom drops out of Castiel’s stomach as he spins around.
“Then it’s settled.” He holds his hand up in his wave. “Goodbye!”
“I don’t blame you for me not figuring something out yet, kid. You’re not at fault, you know that, right?”
me to kill him. And maybe if I was a kid, you know, when Dad died, when I made the deal for Sam, maybe I would’ve. But I realized that I just… wasn’t that man. And that’s cause of you. You changed me, too, Cas, and I just-“ he looks down at his lap and squeezes his eyes closed. “You can have me.”
“I could’ve been. Isn’t knife skills a requirement? Anyway, I think this is gonna work.” Dean holds up

Dean blinks, a little taken aback. Eileen looks completely unsurprised.

A soft, almost bashful expression crept across Cas’s face, shrugging his shoulders.
“I think we’d like that.” She sticks her hands in her pockets. “This is the house where I died. I don’t really want to stay in it.”
“Look, I’ve done a
“These are awesome.” Dean leans over and sneaks a fry. “She just doesn’t understand us.”
“Yes,” Castiel finally allows to be pulled out of him. “I would like that very much. If Dean would like it.”
They’re quiet again.
There’s a pleasant little melody of a knock on his door. She could walk right in but he’s pretty sure she knocks just to fuck with him. Dean walks up to the door and opens it.
Castiel turns to her. “Did you come just to annoy me?”
Castiel narrows his eyes.
“Are you saying that just because I’m your son?”
“I’ve been trying to make eclairs.” Sam pulls a face. “I keep fucking it up.”
It’s not, it’s not
Dean got distracted just looking at his face for a few seconds, which had to be in the top ten dumbass Dean Winchester moments, but when Cas’s eyebrows went even further up his forehead he cleared his throat and started fumbling in his pockets.
of time to freak out before they get back. It’s fine. Totally fine.
He relaxes a little. “Oh, good. Come on. Let’s go for a walk.”
“He came to the Empty and asked.” Jack beams at the water as he arrives with their huge amount of food. “Thank you!”
“Scrapper is a
Sam has gone to bed and Dean is sitting in the main hall, beer in his hand, staring at the wall.
“I am almost always hungry.”
“I have no issues with certain technicalities,” he answers.
“I’m glad you’re out.” Jack pulls back, smiling. “Dean was very persistent.”
Dean holds up a hand. “Nope.”
“Are we going to discuss it?”
“Purgatory,” Dean answers instantly. “Thought I was going out of my mind. I was just…” he clears his throat. “Just needed you back. I knew we didn’t have much left time to live and I was just… was prepared to die out there so long as you were with me.”
“Heliotrope?” Dean demands after Cas tells him what the new one is, little purple flowers in a glass vase.
“It’s not
. Both? Weird. All sorts of weird. Can he keep a secret of not telling Cas he knows? He’s good at keeping secrets, right? Hell, he pretended to be emotionally stable for most of his life no problem, right?
“Nobody’s holding a
There’s silence on Dean’s end long enough that Castiel worries he’s overstepped when there’s a sharp shot to his ankle. “
“Don’t, don’t use your powers to win in that, Jack, Dean’s going to say that’s practically cheating.”
Cas resheathes a knife. “Yes.”
“Yeah, kid, I know.”
“I don’t… trust anyone up here, yet. Just you and Mom. And Mom can’t do it.”
Castiel, who has spent the day building a rather large bookstore and has been distracted by the Dewey Decimal System, is a little thrown. “What?”
“Gotta go back inside soon, buddy,” he says, and just hearing his voice in person feels like it would be enough to have helped Castiel survive the Empty for another year. He chucks the stick into the woods again and puts the broom against the wall. “Hope you brought pie again, dude, that stuff you brought last time was-“ He turns to face them, still grinning, and stops dead. His hand lunges out to grab at the column on the porch and when he does Castiel can feel himself slow down a little, thrown by the fact of their eyes meeting.
