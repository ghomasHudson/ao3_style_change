John was always getting a little hangry when he come home after a long day. „The fridge is completely empty. All stores are closed!“
„Do i also get some dessert?", Sherlock asked with a low voice still staring at his doctor, unable to take his eyes off. John reached for the marshmallows and took one in between his front teeth.
"I love you, Sherlock. I might just say it." Sherlock seemed stunned and didn’t really know what to say but then he found his language again and answered „I love you too, John Watson." His voice was raspy and shaky as if it took a lot to express what he actually felt. But it felt good. He had mostly recovered from what John had just done with him, so he come closer and breathed: „Let me see what we have here." Wanting to return the favor Sherlock sat up on his legs and reached out for John‘s cock that was already visitbly dripping inside his boxers. With a quick movement he flipped John over on his back and licked off the drops of pre-cum and then kissed John again who was leaning against the armrest of the sofa. Their tongues clashed and moved over eachother. They had their eyes closed and breathed heavily. Sherlock felt John‘s cock against his stomach; it was very hard.
„Wow, they only expired two years ago, that‘s a real lucky strike.“ Sherlock had spotted the date without moving even a bit. John reached out and took another one but instead of eating it himself he held it towards Sherlock and made an offering „Hm?“ sound. Sherlock opened wis mouth willingly and let John feed him.
„I want more.“, he whispered and pulled John into a soft kiss. Sweet like a dream and better than anything he had ever felt. John pressed his chest against Sherlock‘s, enjoying his firm grip. One hand held John’s back as to make sure he didn’t back off. Of course that was highly unnecessary; nothing in the world could make him move away from that perfect body, that was for sure. John climbed onto sherlock who was lying on his back and sat on him full weight. John sensed a twitch right beneath him and also felt heat filling up his own body in certain spaces. Sherlock breathed in sharply and took John’s hand, interlocking their fingers. With the other one he took hold of John‘s neck and pulled him down a second time with a longing John didn’t know rested inside his flatmate. Their lips met and it was a pure sensation of heat and tingling, and a bit of marshmallow. Then their tongues met. Their kiss was like electricity; the tension of years and years suddenly released. Sherlock couldnt get enough. They were hungry and starving for the body of the other.
„However, i‘m grateful that you do.“, Sherlock added quietly. Instead of an answer John started stroking over Sherlock’s knee and gave it a little grip. John knew it, he knew it for some time now. He was in love with this strange detective and there was nothing he could do about it. Every inch of that perfect pale elegant body of his just had an impact on John that he couldn’t resist. It attracted him like murder cases attracted Sherlock.
Sherlock sighed. "’m fine," he mumbled, shrugging off the blanket they kept putting on him – he was too warm for it.
Again, thank you for all of your patience, especially those who have been here from the beginning. See you on the flip side!
Sherlock hummed a little, settling a moment later, his breathing slowing down a bit. After a little while, he opened his eyes, coming to. He sniffed, seeing John there and realising he was in his bed. "Mmm... how'd I get here?" he asked, knowing John couldn't carry him. He heard noises in the living room and his eyes widened a little. "Someone's here," he said, trying to sit up.
John looked over at Sherlock, his eyes wide. He wanted to ask if he had aimed at Sebastian's leg, if he had meant to let him bleed to death. He wasn't sure what he would do if that was what Sherlock had meant to do. Because killing a man was one thing in the right situation, but he couldn't imagine much worse than slowly bleeding out, feeling your life slip through your fingers. He shuddered, the thought hitting too close to home.
Sherlock smiled against John's mouth and moved to get the supplies he would need to tend to Sherlock's neck, which was throbbing wonderfully. It hurt, but what hadn't in the last two years. He was there with John, and that mattered more than anything.
John pushed himself up into a sitting position, taking the glass from Sherlock and tipping back the water. "Thank you," he murmured, leaning back against the cushions. "I'll be fine, now. Probably just gunna sleep. You should go and get done what you need to." He reached out until he found Sherlock's hand, squeezing it gently. "I love you," he hummed.
Sherlock spat a string of names and curse words at Mycroft, throwing the phone against the wall where it shattered. He looked back in time to see John scoop up Katherine, rocking her gently. It broke his heart, and made him sick at the same time because this wasn't fair. "WHY BOTHER LYING?!" he said, storming out of the room and down the hall. He paced a little, tugging at his hair and opened up the cupboard above the stove, pulling out a bottle of liquor.
"I love you," John whispered, nuzzling against Sherlock's hair, lazily tracing patterns over his chest. "And that's not just the post-coital endorphins talking," he promised, a chuckle lifting his tone. "You're beautiful and intelligent and opinionated and I love you so much."
John nodded, eating more of his food. When he heard Katherine sniff again, he looked up at her, tilting his head curiously. "Sweetie, are your eyes itchy or watery, or is it just your nose?" he asked, taking a drink of the juice.
Mycroft tilted his head slightly, eyes fixed on Sherlock. “What I have done is a mercy, a kindness done to those I care for Sherlock,” Mycroft said. “Surely, you would not have wanted our mother to bury Father…and then die alone while her only son allows himself to be lost with the filth the streets, addling his gift of a mind with drugs?” he asked. “No, what I did was a kindness. They felt nothing…I made sure of it.”
Not that Sherlock particularly wanted to go on raids constantly. He didn’t want to become a policeman to his own kind. That was even more tedious than helping humans. At least humans changed over time, with each new generation and the discoveries they made the world moved. People grew, his kind just stayed the same and grew nothing but stagnant.
Sherlock heard another voice for a moment, warm air wrapping around him – inside somewhere, then. It was only after he was laid down again that he went completely limp once more, falling asleep all the way.
John looked up, watching Sherlock leave the room. He let out a small breath, setting Katty on the ground and telling her to go play. He excused himself and quickly trotted up the stairs, knocking on the bathroom door and pushing it slowly open. "Sherlock? What's wrong, love?"
John smacked him lightly in the shoulder, taking the phone from him and stuffing it between his back and the mattress. "Then he can piss off," he murmured.
John made a small noise as his knot receded and he slowly slipped out of Sherlock. "Hey," he whispered, nudging him gently. "Let's go get that shower in, yeah?" he asked, knowing he was stirring him from a half sleep.
"Don' apologise," Sherlock said, shaking his head once. "Came back... 'nd I'll come back too..." he said, half asleep still. "’m trying..." he dozed off again, his hand still covering John's, holding it gently to his cheek.
"Yes, Sherlock, alright. I'll sleep. Just... don't let me hurt her if I start having a nightmare." He looked up at Sherlock with pleading eyes, resting his hand over his chest, irritated that he couldn't feel his tags.
"Oh, no, you don't," John said, jumping from the bed and guiding Sherlock back into the room. "Every unbonded Alpha in the area would be on you in minutes. You're staying here. Call your brother if someone needs to go down there." He set his hands firmly on Sherlock's shoulders, stroking his thumbs along his skin.
Sherlock nodded quickly, rutting up against John's hand, trying for more friction. "John...please, anything...fuck all John, you know I don't like begging!" he said, eyes wide and locked onto his mate.
John panted, his head spinning, and tried to fight back, to do anything, but Lucian weighted more than he did, and he was all toned muscle. His heart was hammering, because he knew what was coming, why they were alone, and he didn't want it, his body didn't want it, his mind didn't want it.
John hummed quietly, nuzzling against the back of Sherlock's neck above the bite, trailing his nose up into his hair and just breathing for a moment. "I love you," he purred, nipping at Sherlock's –
John smiled softly and nodded, moving to set up. He pulled Sherlock against him, wrapping his arm around his waist and softly tracing his fingers along his side. "Love you," he murmured, kissing his temple and gently stroking a finger down the side of Kat's face.
"You picked me almost a year ago, only that isn't me anymore I –" Sherlock remembered hearing Mycroft mention it once in the last month. "I'm broken," he said quietly, curling tighter.
Sherlock hummed, closing his eyes a little. He sighed, rocking Katherine, who was bouncing on his stomach. He let out a breath, looking at John and knocking his forehead against John's. "Give us a minute," he said, getting up and taking Katherine with. He wandered downstairs and knocked on Mrs Hudson's door. After spinning a quick story about a case that both he and John were needed on and how if she could just watch Katherine for a few hours and that she was about to take a nap anyway...
Mindy looked at Sherlock, assessing before she said anything. "I was scared my first time too," she said quietly, not looking back down at the scarf she was knitting. "I knew what was happening, obviously, but everything that I tried to predict went another way." She glanced up at Sherlock, making eye contact for a second. "It's alright to be scared."
"Mm love you, Papa," Katherine beat Sherlock to it, and she rolled over looking at Sherlock. Sherlock sighed; she didn't look anywhere near falling asleep yet. They were silent for a little while before, "Where go?" she asked, speaking around her thumb and looking intently at Sherlock.
Sherlock sighed, wrapping one arm around John, the other keeping Katherine secured on the table so she didn't roll off. "I know... just hate seeing her hurt like that," he said quietly. He knew if it was an infection she would be given antibiotics of some sort and it would sort her out in a couple days, but still.
The human’s forehead creased a little in question, so Sherlock lifted his right hand, then dragged a nail across the base of his thumb, a dark line of scarlet appearing. It took a moment for the realization to come, and the man started to shake his head.
He couldn't shut it all off, he just couldn't, and for a week after finding out, he simply laid in the flat. The compound he'd made had worked, and his heat cycle never showed its face. Probably for the better; Sherlock probably would have offed himself – that would have made it so much worse. He felt... well he didn't want to feel, and he didn't want to think, so that was when he had the idea.
Sherlock leant over as John pulled him down more, and he rested his forehead against John's chest, clenching as his whole body tensed for a moment as John came, followed quickly by himself. The wave lasted longer than normal, and when it passed, Sherlock fell limp onto John's chest, not able to move, not even to tremble as he normally did. His chest was heaving, and he gulped breaths of John's scent, eyes rolled back in his head some, fluttering shut.
Sherlock glanced over at John and shook his head. "Nothing, something he owes me is all," he said, not wanting to promise John anything he couldn't keep. He slowed his pace down, tightening his hand around John's.
Sherlock was awake once more when John woke up, looking at him with a touch of concern. "Hey... what's wrong?” he asked, running a hand through his hair. "John?" he asked, scooting over on the bed and tugging on his arm. "Get up here, I miss you," he said.
She nodded and walked away. "Don't say anything... it's just a long day. I would have had one yesterday if I could," he murmured.
Sherlock nodded. "Yes, all of those things," he said. "Technically, John, you could request paternal leave, but I won't ask you to. I know you need your work. Mycroft can get your pills as I said, just to be certain. Whatever you think will work, and he'll get it. Hospital food is good, as long as you opt for anything that was made already that they would be serving for everyone. If it is him, he wouldn't draw attention to himself by doing this to all the hospital workers," he said, thinking.
"He looked like he had enough on his plate. Besides, I handed him your charts. If he had read the whole thing, he would have seen that PTSD symptoms were clearly marked on there." John nodded, closing his eyes and smirking. "That's illegal, you know." Dr. Chase laughed, adding a sleeping aid to John's IV. "Yes, well, I didn't see you complaining, and I have a feeling you would back me up."
John kept eating past when Sherlock stopped, finishing most of his food and then half of his wine before he pushed it away and leant over against Sherlock. "We can trade off nights, though. I don't expect you to do it all. I don't
"’m okay," Sherlock said in response to John’s other inquiry, looking over and seeing the cold tea, well warmer now since it was iced. He reached out carefully and took up the cup, draining it all the way, his mouth dry.
that as soon as Sherlock went into full heat, the pups would all but be abandoned. Still, he had never felt like such an animal before, had never taken his Alpha nature that far, and he felt wrong about it. "I'm so sorry, love," John whispered, sitting beside Sherlock on the sofa after he had shut and locked the door. "They'll be back, I promise," he murmured, reaching out to rest his hand on Sherlock's shoulder.
Taking Sherlock's hand, John led the way back to the main level and onto the street, raising his hand for a cab and holding the door for Sherlock when one pulled up.
"As for the Omega, Sherlock, as you listed him, my main concern with him was his obvious malnutrition and signs of abuse. You don't look the kind to treat an Omega like this, so what's the story?" the doctor asked, stopping outside of a hospital room door.
Sherlock didn't even remember making it back to the bed, the first thing he was aware of was John's arm wrapped around him, and that he felt cold. He sniffed a little, pulling his eyes open. He swallowed, rolling over carefully, feeling a bit stiff and sore. He settled, curling close to John. He coughed, humming softly. He still felt warm, but not as if from a heat, but a normal warmth from a fever maybe. He sighed, probably from his stint in the snow that he didn't even remember.
Sherlock smiled, leaning back more and lifting his head to kiss John again. "I said you can have it early," he said with a smile, nipping at John's chin. "Anything you want," he said, looking up at him.
"Leaving?" Mindy asked, walking up and pulling Sherlock into a hug, then giving a long, tight one to her son.
John looked at the boy for a moment longer, noting the tired lines around his eyes. "You can go back to sleep. I'll be in the living room, hopefully doing the same."
John had scrubbed his skin with soap until he felt raw, trying to take as much time as he could in the shower without just standing there. He jumped a little when he heard the door open, and again when Sherlock spoke from almost right outside of the shower. He pulled back the curtain, shampoo still in his hair, and stared at Sherlock, sitting on the toilet with the sheet still around his waist.
She felt the touch and turned her head to look up at Sherlock again. She sniffed again, wiping at her nose once more as she looked at him, some small spark of recognition in her eyes, but it was cautious, as if not sure if it was a memory or a dream that she could faintly remember. She leant more against John, snuggling close to her Papa, but her eyes stayed on Sherlock.
Sherlock looked at John's hand, then up at John with a nod. "Yes of course. Apart from my shoulder, I feel fine. Feel a bit out of sorts, but I probably just picked something up at the hospital. Possible of course, the nurses see so many people. Probably just a bug," he said with a small smile.
John chuckled, slipping out of Sherlock as soon as he felt his knot recede. He slowly stood, kissing Sherlock's forehead as he pulled him up with him. "Happy Christmas, love," he replied, leading Sherlock into the bathroom and starting the shower. "I'll take care of the stockings, but you have to participate with the shower."
John just nodded, not really knowing what to say. The cab pulled up outside of Bart's not long after and John paid, leaving a good tip as well as he hurried out after Sherlock. He led the way inside, telling a nurse behind the desk what was going on. She immediately picked up the phone and called up for a doctor, and they ended up lucking out, because Dr Maria was available. John thanked her over his shoulder as they made their way to her office as quickly as they dared.
Sherlock met John's gaze, feeling the tug in his chest when John glared at him sharply, one that told him to back down. He hummed, yipping a little as John bit down his body. On their own his fingers weaved into John's hair, tugging a little, forgetting John's warning. His personality and his Omega self butting heads, apparently.
John could feel himself trembling and he couldn't stop. The floor had just been ripped from underneath him, and he had nothing else to grab onto, not wanting to drag Sherlock down with him.
John stepped back from the bed, sweeping his gaze over the unconscious boy, checking for injuries. He had seen the wrists already, but he knew other wounds couldn’t be far behind with the treatment he had been getting.
John swore, his muscles tightening as he came, able to keep his knot down. He went boneless, making vague tugging motions in Sherlock's hair and on his arm to tell him to 'get up here; I want to kiss you,' but he was too breathless to actually say it.
Sherlock's mouth formed an 'O', and another noise escaped him as John resumed his movements. His eyes shut a little and he rested his forehead on the mattress, definitely more comfortable now. He leant back onto John's fingers a little, humming as he took them deeper.
Sherlock nodded a little. "I won't," he said, grabbing a scarf from his dresser and putting it around his neck. "And you're welcome," he said quietly, feeling the heavy metal in his pocket. He nodded again, sweeping out of the room and grabbing the head from the fridge, going downstairs and onto the street to flag down a cab.
John chuckled good-naturedly, letting Sherlock breathe in his scent, which was slowly starting to become a combination of both of their scents. John inhaled deeply at the juncture of Sherlock's neck and shoulder, shuddering at the delicious mixture of smells. Nothing short of death could separate them now, and John was not going to allow death to happen until they were both old and decrepit.
But you're not going to cover it," John replied, walking beside the Omega as they went to check out. "Save your money for something more important. I've got this." He paid for the clothes before Sherlock could argue again, handing half of the bags over to him and leading the way outside.
Sherlock's head tilted back into the bed more and he groaned. How could anyone be expected to focus under these conditions? He whimpered again, a moan of John's name on his lips. Still, he was a quick study, and he would prove to John just how hard it was to pay attention. He shivered, right on the edge. "J-John.... I can't...
of what he does?" He made a face, shaking his head and gently nudging Sherlock off of his lap, needing to move. He paced in circles around the room, stuffing his hand in his hair and clenching his fist for a moment before he let go with a sharp huff, pacing over to the window and glaring at the sky as if it had personally offended him.
John continued combing his hands through Sherlock's hair and kissing his neck and collarbone until he felt that the Omega had had enough. He then sat back on the couch, tugging Sherlock's hand in an invitation for him to scoot closer.
," he said with a smirk that John couldn't see. "Long drive and all that," he said softly. "Not to mention the emotional upheaval I seem to be going through... absolutely exhausting."
Sherlock looked down at John's hand on his stomach, letting out a breath. He knew what John was thinking about. "Someday," he said quietly, letting out a breath.
Sherlock whined, trying to dig his heels in to leave, but he couldn't, and he found himself following with John. He pulled out his phone, sending a quick message to Mycroft, or trying to, his hands shaking. He sent it, and then dropped his phone to the floor.
Sherlock pushed him gently to the bed, going to refill the glass and wet down a cloth with cool water. He set the cloth in John's hand for a moment, and the glass on the bedside table as he tugged John's jumper off. "You're warm, don't need it," Sherlock muttered, pressing the cloth to John's forehead after wiping down his face real quick.
Sherlock took Hamish from John, draping a cloth over his shoulder and started to burp the child. He reached over with one hand and smoothed down the dark ringlets, which had grown past her shoulders now. She sniffed a little and climbed up onto the chair, standing on it hesitantly before carefully perching on the edge of the bed. She fiddled with her hands in her lap, playing with the hem of her pleaded shirt, still wearing her uniform. "M-missed you Papa," she said quietly, looking up at him. She was almost afraid to hug him, not wanting to hurt him.
"I got bored," John replied easily, rolling his fingers into fists as he watched the man walk. He wanted to shoot him, and he would have, right then and there, if it wasn't for the five other men that walked through the doorway just then.
Sherlock knew part of him ached a little to have them, but he knew that was just biological, he knew he was at a prime age to have them. The abuse he'd suffered, though... it led him to wonder if he even
John laughed, walking up to Sherlock and standing on his toes for a kiss. "Look at you, so smug. As if you ever doubted how it would look," he teased, kissing Sherlock again before dropping back onto his heels. He led Sherlock back into the living room, leaning against the back of his chair as Katherine came bounding back down the stairs with her white stockings.
Sherlock smiled a little, squeezing John's hand. "We're fine," he murmured quietly, slowing his pace a little. It felt nice, stretching his legs. They finally came up to a park and Sherlock led John into it, looking at the playground which was empty this time of day, all the kids in school. He walked over to the swings, sitting on one of them. "Suppose we'll be here in a year or so," he murmured quietly, resting his feet.
Sherlock leant against John, picking Katherine up from John's legs so he could move more. He sighed, smiling softly as he rested his head against John's. "Mhm... always," he murmured quietly, looking down at Katherine.
Sherlock sat Hamish up again when he fell and nodded. "I know he is," He murmured, standing up and lifting Hamish. "Better bundle you up little ferret." He bounced the infant once as he walked down the hall. He tugged on Hamish's little winter coverall and tucked him in his car seat. His pram was folded up downstairs since they only used it when they went out. "Katherine!" he called up the stairs. "Time to go!" He heard a complaint that she wasn't done colouring, but soon enough he heard feet quickly descending the stairs.
Sherlock nodded a little, still flushed, though he refused to allow any tears to fall from his eyes. He let out a breath, then left the kitchen.
John folded the paper on his lap, laying it across one of his knees. "Well what am I supposed to say about it? You know it's bad, but you do it because you want to, so I don't comment." He shrugged, nearly given up on the paper anyway, and picked up his tea again. "There's not much I can do, and, yeah, it's better than smoking."
Sherlock hummed a little, smiling softly. "’m perfect," he said quietly, raising his eyes to look at John. "What about you?" he asked. He leant up and pressed a kiss to John's cheek, wanting to show affection while it was still so easy for him.
John gritted his teeth again, standing from the bed. "Hopefully this is the last one," he said as he departed for the bathroom.
"When are you going to tell Mycroft?" John asked, figuring he would have to tell Harry and Mum at some point too. "’Cause he'll find out on his own if you don't tell him, and that could get a bit... intrusive."
Sherlock watched the sutures get pulled out, and then covered again. Sitting up, he looked at John, and then nodded. "Breakfast," he echoed, standing up.
"Must've been a nightmare," he murmured, nuzzling against Sherlock's shoulder, "but I don't remember it. Just heard a scream and woke up." He leaned up, pressing a soft kiss under Sherlock's jaw. "I miss you too," he sighed softly, stroking his fingers along Sherlock's side.
"I just want to go home and sit in my chair with a fire going. I'd like to hold you, but I'm pretty sure you're going to go into your mind again here soon." John sighed lightly, thanking the waitress when she returned with the boxes and the tab.
"I wish we could just move there," John said wistfully, combing his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "It's too far away from any place with a decent school system, though. I already checked," he murmured, turning his head to kiss Sherlock's forehead. There was a soft knock at the door and Dr. Chase came in, giving them a soft smile.
Sherlock sighed, sealing up the letter and putting it in the outgoing mail. He was on his way home when he started to feel a little off. It was still winter, ice everywhere on the pavement, why was he so hot? It wasn't until he saw a few looks of people on the street he realised.
She settled a fraction, her hands moving to hold onto John's head, patting his face with her open palms, bending forward to gum his nose, getting more drool on him.
Sherlock held John close, not seeing himself letting go of him any time soon. He swallowed, enraged at the thought of someone doing that to John, and then also at the thought that someone might come back for him. Someone who had his scent, and his daughter's. "John...we're not letting him near you, or Katherine, or Hamish. I promise."
– that I have ever laid eyes on." He walked up to Sherlock, wrapping his arms around him and leaning up on his toes to kiss him. "And it's still infuriating that I have to do this when I want to kiss you," he mumbled against Sherlock's lips.
John pulled Katherine onto his lap, tilting her head up so that their eyes met. "Do you understand, baby?" he asked quietly. "If you don't look where you're going, bad things can happen, and Daddy and I don't want to see you get hurt, okay?" He leaned down and kissed her forehead, closing his eyes to banish that thought out of his mind.
John nodded, squeezing Sherlock's hand again as they crossed the street, making their way down the last block to the flat. He unlocked the door, stepping inside and holding it open for Sherlock. "Well, let's get inside and you can nap while I hold you, how bout?" he offered, locking the door behind them and starting up the stairs.
Sherlock couldn’t stop the small smile that pulled at his lips, adjusting the scarf on Katherine's neck. "Thank you, though I suppose we have our little colour coordinator here to thank for her excellent choice," he said with a smile as they were lead downstairs. He climbed into a cab when it was called settling Katherine over in John's lap this time, instead of his. Let him have her while he was here.
"So you're saying there won't be time tomorrow then," he said with a small smirk, looking at John. He took a larger sip of his wine. "For your other present," he said. "I thought you might like it, so... maybe you want it early?" he offered. It was something he normally didn't do but... his comfort zone was a bit larger these days. He had John back.
John pulled out, letting go of Sherlock's hands and rolling him over onto his chest before thrusting back in again. He lowered his head to Sherlock's neck, making his thrusts deep and fast.
Sherlock shook his head a little. "I don't... I don't know," he said honestly. "I don't know what's been going on with me, I've just been thinking things like that lately," he said. "Of course, I suppose it makes sense now, and how much fuss I was making about that interview, and how you looked. God, am I always going to be this annoying?" he asked.
Sherlock cut himself off, not talking to other people unless he absolutely needed to. Which he often didn't. He was getting used to alone, he worked better alone, and felt altogether better alone. Except when he thought about John again, which he tried not to, because he still hadn't heard from him.
John leant his shoulder against Sherlock's arm, linking their fingers together and lifting his hand to examine Sherlock’s wrist. "These are looking better," he commented, reaching for Sherlock’s other hand to examine the marks on that wrist as well. "How's your side?"
Sherlock sat down on the corner of the sofa, munching on the cold spring rolls. They weren't as good that way, but they were good enough for the purposes of a snack. He looked at John, smiling a little.
“Simba has a daddy…and a mummy,” she started, and Sherlock felt something in his stomach drop. No, far too early for such a question. John cast a sideways glance at Sherlock, which he met. “Why don’t have a papa? Mish and me don’have a mummy,” she added.  John started grinning once she reached the end of her inquiry, looking at Sherlock. He was planning on just letting him squirm unitl he saw the look of loss on his face and he took pity on him.
Sherlock let out a breath, getting up out of bed and shuffling down the hall. His unruly hair stuck out every which way as he stepped inside the kitchen, blinking a few times.
John rested his head back against the pillow, closing his eyes for a moment. He was content as he was, holding his daughter and with his bondmate at his side. "Doesn't get much better than this," he breathed, his lips curled into a smile.
John smiled down at the two of them. His two people. His. God, how he loved them both. "Really?" John asked, playing along, though it wasn't the first time he had heard it from her. "What do you remember?" He grinned when Sherlock caught his eye, and then he bent over to slip his shoes on, gesturing with a nod of his head that it was time for them to get going.
John was talking so easily with her, each discussing doctor things that Sherlock partially tuned out for. He wondered what she would ask, if she'd end up seeing his scars, asking about them.
John put his arms around Kat. "I'm just worried about him. I don't know if I can help him." He sighed lightly, kissing her forehead. "Do you want me to try?" When she nodded, John stood up, ushering her back towards her dolls and walking into the bedroom. He closed the door behind him, but didn't step any further inside. "Sherlock?" he whispered hesitantly.
He wasn't as good at this as Sherlock was, but he was damn close. He tickled his fingers along Katty's belly, delighting when she giggled and waved her fists. "Come on, let's go back downstairs." He picked her back up and returned to the living room, lowering himself into his chair and holding her on his lap, watching her as she looked around the room.
Sherlock hummed again, nodding as he tilted his head up to look at John. He smiled lazily up at the Alpha. "Taste amazing," he murmured quietly, dragging his nose back up to John's neck again, his hand moving over his chest, exploring a little. "Mm love you," he said.
John smiled at the lady behind the counter, who he was beginning to know very well. "Same thing?" she asked, knowing why John was there and what he was doing.
Sherlock followed along with John as they walked into the store, scanning his eyes over the crowd as John pulled out their list. He grabbed things from the shelf, tossing them into the cart, eyes still moving. He let out a breath, watching as a small child raced past them with a bag of sweets, proceeding to beg his parents for them.
"Fuck," he swore, tearing off down the street. He wasn't letting Sherlock get away, not this time. He pulled out his phone as he ran, hoping to hell that Lestrade could help him. "Lestrade! He's got Sherlock. The murderer, the one you guys have been chasing. Track Sherlock's phone; I need to know where he is. I'm getting my... I'm grabbing something at the flat." He hung up, focusing on where he was placing his feet.
John stiffened when he heard the female officer call Sherlock a freak, and he was about to turn around and yell at her when Sherlock gestured him forward. He gritted his teeth, following him into the house. "Instant distaste for her," John practically growled. "You're not a freak."
John stood up and shook the Omega's hand, looking him up and down. "Yeah, I do. Let's step outside. I don't..." He looked over at Sherlock, sleeping peacefully on the hospital bed. "I don't want him to wake up and hear. The look he gets when he talks about it..." He shook his head, leading the way into the hallway.
John chuckled at Sherlock's logic, though it made sound sense to him. "I love you," he murmured, gently lifting Sherlock's head so that he could kiss him slowly and languidly. "I didn't know what love really was until I met you," he said quietly, his lips moving against Sherlock's, breathing in his air and giving his own to Sherlock.
Pity ran through John, because he knew what that was like. It was hell, was what it was. "Come here," he said softly, holding open his arms for Sherlock to scoot into. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock's thin frame, tucking Sherlock’s head against his chest and pressing a kiss to his temple. "You're alright," he promised quietly. "No one's going to grab you in your sleep anymore except me."
Sherlock shivered again, letting out a breath, his fingers knotting in John's hair as John paid attention to each of the blemishes. "I love you... John, so much," he moaned quietly, pulling John up again for a kiss, nipping all the way down his jaw and neck.
"I know. You'll come back, you'll always come back, just like I did," he said softly, relaxing on top of John with a soft sigh. He murmured quietly, words not really making sense. "And it will just be the four of us," he said quietly with a small smile, trying to imagine what it would be like.
John moved into the bathroom, taking out the sleeping pills that he had written himself a prescription for. He'd been taking them for a while now, even though they didn't seem to be helping. He downed two of them in the bathroom, then walked into the bedroom, stripping down and pulling on some pyjamas. He crawled under the covers, passing out as soon as his head hit the pillow.
Katherine whined a little when she was picked up, sucking on her thumb again as she was carried into the bedroom. Sherlock followed, purple nightie in his hands. "Here," he said, handing it to John and walking around the other side of the bed. He supposed it was good that the stab was on his right side, facing away from where John and Katherine would be, and he could curl on his side.
God, love, that dream sounds like living hell. I'm so sorry, baby. I wish I could hold you and fix it. Tell Kat that I got her card and that it's beautiful. Actually, on second thought, don't tell her anything. We have a Skype date in two days, alright? 3 p.m. your time; I'm missing supper for it, but whatever. It'll be worth it to see you guys. I'll leave my Skype messenger open, so just dial me up when you're ready, alright?
Sherlock took John's entire length into his mouth, stroking him up and down quickly when he pulled up, only to push all the way down onto him, humming when he reached the bottom, knowing John could feel the vibrations. He smirked a little, pulling off and continuing to stroke John gently, leaning down and gently sucking one of his balls into his mouth, humming again.
John was walking – limping – now. He needed a cane, which pissed him off to no end. His right leg kept acting up and it hurt like a bitch, but neither the doctors nor his therapist believed him, calling it psychosomatic. Bastards, all of them, but John ignored it and them, knowing that the more he cooperated the faster he would get discharged and the sooner he could go home.
Small footsteps padded down the hall and Katherine walked down to the living room, rubbing one of her eyes. "Papa?" she asked sleepily. "Why go out here?" she asked quietly, her curls in a snarled messy poof on her head.
"Morning Papa!" she said, standing up on the bed and bouncing a little. "Daddy's birthday! Going to the park! And getting cake!" she said.
his Alpha. "But I'll never mention it again... please can I just... please hold me," he said quietly.
John sighed a bit sarcastically, poking Sherlock playfully as he passed him. He dumped out what was left of his tea in the sink, and then headed for the bathroom to relieve himself. He came back into the kitchen, fishing around in the fridge for the creamer, not wanting to use milk this time, only to find that they were out of it, along with eggs and butter... oh, and apples. He sighed, writing down a list that he could continue later.
Oh, Sherlock. I'm so sorry, love. I know you've got to be due soon, and I'm missing it, I'm missing all of it, and I don't think I'm making it home. Sherlock, please. Take care of the kids. Forgive me.
Sherlock pulled on some dry pyjamas as well, standing by the window and looking out it. He heard John call him, turning and looking at the bed. Once again they were giving them a week. One week...it wasn't fair. Their daughter was turning four next month, John's twenty-eighth birthday. He looked towards the door, Katherine was probably still asleep on the sofa. He wandered over to the bed and climbed into it, curling close to John.
"When was the last time he ate?" John asked, gently moving Hamish's fist out of his mouth so that he could fit the plastic nipple between his lips. "We need to work on your manners," he whispered to the pup, bending down to lightly kiss his forehead. He glanced up at the clock, furrowing his brow and trying to remember what time it had been when he had fallen asleep. "When's Kat coming?" he asked.
Sherlock looked up, seeing John, and placed his warm hand on his face. He realised that it was early morning now, officially Saturday, six days left. With any luck by the end of the day his heat would be over, and they would have their time.
A nurse came in a little while later with food for Sherlock, and an extra plate for John as well. "Now I want you eating all of that, you're still feeding her after all," the nurse said. Sherlock rolled his eyes, sitting up, though he didn't relinquish Katherine yet.
Sherlock huffed. "No, it's not okay. This whole pregnancy thing is throwing me off. I don't see as well as I should, and I can't think!" he snapped, shaking his head and pulling out his phone, arranging a few things. He sighed. "Come on. I want to be walking," he murmured.
"Here, go to your daddy, alright?" He handed her over to Sherlock, standing up and walking into the bathroom. He still had some medication that he took for when he felt his PTSD rearing up again, and he took down the bottle now, shaking out a couple of pills into his hand and popping them back, dry swallowing them with a small shake of his head.
John grinned, watching Sherlock's expressions as he settled himself and then raised up. John lined up, lifting his hips and slowly pushing Sherlock's down, meeting him halfway on the thrust. "Good?" he asked, rocking his hips a little to test it out.
John walked over to the pup, picking her up and rocking her gently, bouncing a little. She quieted down again, and John walked around, smiling down at her as she clutched his finger in her tiny fist, trying to fling it around. "See? Told you Daddy would be fine," he murmured, more to himself than anything. He paced the room slowly, watching her eyes darting around, her feet kicking every so often, but for the most part, she was still. "You're ridiculously adorable. A bit like your dad, to be honest. Nothing like me, thankfully," he teased, smiling, and leant down to bump noses with her, waiting for Sherlock to wake up.
John shifted his hold on Sherlock, climbing the stairs slowly and avoiding the ones that creaked as he made his way up to his flat. He set Sherlock gently down on the bed, pulling the sheets and duvet over him and stroking his knuckles softly across Sherlock’s cheek.
"I don't know," Sherlock murmured. "Harry's yet to have an existential crisis," he said, pressing a chaste kiss to John's lips. He traced his fingers down John's jaw, sighing a little. "We should... I don't know, go out or something. Apparently I have to get fat or something... and we've yet to celebrate. That's what normal people do right? Celebrate these kinds of things?" he asked, his hand going to his stomach a bit.
this. There was going to be no waiting involved. He dragged his teeth down gently the front of Sherlock's chest, his hands working at the button and zip of his trousers. He pulled them and his pants off, tossing them to the floor before he crawled back up Sherlock's body, biting at his sensitive spots and rolling his hot tongue over his nipples.
Sherlock stood up, setting Katherine down to pull on her coat and hat, as well as his coat and scarf before lifting her up again.
John's face broke out in a huge grin, and he reached over to set his hand on top of Sherlock's, knowing he wouldn't be able to feel anyway. "She's letting you know she's in there," he said with a smile, reaching up to comb through Sherlock's hair. "She's a little early for active kicking, so she's probably just going to keep on doing it. Which is fine, because the theory is that the more active they are in the womb, the quieter they are when they're born." He winked at Sherlock, leaning over to kiss his cheek.
John stirred when he heard the wheels of an IV drip turn, the sound unmistakable even when sleeping from his time in the hospital. He didn't move or get concerned, though, until Sherlock didn't come back for a while.
John hummed idly, smiling at Sherlock's returned sentiment. "Yes, and then you have the thrills of feeding her as well. Her appetite is not going to decrease by much," He sighed, turning over and resting his head in Sherlock's lap. "I can't wait to see her," he mumbled, falling asleep rather quickly.
One of the nurses ran off, two others pushing through the door with a gurney that John lowered Sherlock onto.
"Mhm... feels like," Sherlock mumbled quietly, tensing at another cramp. He let out a long, slow breath, willing himself to relax more. Eventually he started to drift off again, rubbing his nose a little.
Sherlock pulled on his coat, following John down the stairs. "But that was our time..." he said quietly as he reached the bottom.
John was numb. He kept thinking that he had a timeline, that there was still enough time to do everything he wanted to do before he was shipped away, and that reassurance was continuously ripped out from under him.
“Know your name? Simple enough given your various forms of identification more notably in your wallet which I’ve retrieved for you and around your neck. Not to mention your mobile. Though I didn’t go through the latter, no point really,” he said. “I also know that you’ve recently been invalided back from military service overseas, somewhere warm and arid. You took a bullet to your shoulder, through and through though you walk with a limp which your therapist believes to be psychosomatic, she’s quite correct I’m afraid. Now you’re living in London, though you’re not planning to for long, though not through any choice of your own,” he said, sitting back in the chair to watch John. See how he reacted.
pissed off Alpha on their hands." He squeezed Sherlock's hand one last time before he reached his boundary and could go no further.
When the notes ended, leaving the room still ringing with a memory of the song, John crawled forward and wrapped himself around Sherlock, burying his face in his shoulder. "That was lovely. Thank you," he whispered, squeezing his eyes tightly shut and swallowing thickly.
John smiled, running his hands over Sherlock's chest and stomach, turning his head to nuzzle Sherlock's neck. He pressed open mouthed kissed up under his jaw, running his tongue along the edge of it, scraping once with his teeth.
John moved back into the living room, walking over to stand near Sherlock. "You do smell different. Sweeter. Not much, but... it's there."
"Watch me," Sherlock murmured. It had been almost impossible during his heat, and he'd hated it, how small he felt, and he hoped that that wasn't going to be a common occurrence. He'd taken to being snappier, though, insistent on John recovering properly. He had to get better, then they could get better.
"Don't," John whispered, shaking his head and reaching up to weakly comb through Sherlock's hair. "Don't put this... on you," he begged, wishing he could kiss away all of Sherlock's self-hate. But he couldn't. He shifted a little on the bed and winced, setting a hand lightly over his stomach. "Text Mrs H on my phone. You're getting warm; someone needs to watch Katty."
John shuddered as they stepped outside, his eyes quickly falling on a black car with tinted windows. "Must be for us." He opened the door for Sherlock, sliding in behind him.
John dropped his head, kissing Sherlock properly, though gently, their lips moving softly together and going no further. "Why? I like this," he murmured teasingly, resting their foreheads together and brushing noses with Sherlock. "Just this, forever, would make me happy."
"Yes... like them," Sherlock breathed. "Not like... other Alphas," he mumbled, remembering being told not to expect better than he had already, and that the one difference would be that instead of being locked in a room alone through his heats he'd be taken during them.
John shuddered to think of himself doing that and firmly corrected his thoughts. He would be fine. Two years in the desert and then home to Sherlock, and nothing else would happen.
John had been snarling at the Alpha through the window until he felt Sherlock pull away from him. He turned around in time to see the Omega slide to the floor, Mycroft looking at him with worry and about to step forward, but John beat him to it.
"You're the first person I was close to, John, and the first I trusted outside my brother, who I don't even know anymore," Sherlock said, looking down. He sighed. "You leave... and that leaves just me. So don't stay gone," he said softly to the sleeping John. He sighed again and shut his eyes, though he didn't fall asleep for at least a couple hours.
When they got to the flat, Sherlock opened the case up, observing the contents before frowning, shifting through it a little. He strode over and tossed himself onto the sofa, thinking.
"Fuck," John whispered, pressing his forehead against Sherlock's shoulder, panting already but quickening the brutal pace. "God, I love you," he moaned, leaning up to kiss Sherlock, sucking and nipping on his bottom lip. He slammed hard into him, holding himself still for a moment before repeating the motion, swallowing up Sherlock's cries.
Sherlock's eyes slid shut as he felt John's fingers, one by one. He rocked back onto them, biting down on his lip as he did so.
Katherine was still bouncing a small bit, and she nodded quickly. "Yes!" she said. "And, and I can get my... my footies on... and... then I'll be ready!" she said, taking off like a bolt to the stairs and climbing up them using her arms as well.
John cast a sad look at Katherine, concerned about her as always. "We'll go see Gran tomorrow, alright?" he promised, reaching over the hold her hand, squeezing it gently. He caught her eyes and smiled at her, running his thumb gently over the back of her hand. "And then in a few days we can go see Daddy's parents and Stephen, right? And you can show them your tags, can't you?" He leaned over, kissing her forehead and nuzzling into her hair a little.
John rolled his eyes, smacking Sherlock lightly on the shoulder and capturing his lips in a swift kiss. "You're such a smartarse," he murmured, tugging at Sherlock's hair. "Let's get cleaned up, and then you can go answer that call and we can cuddle for a little while longer before we need to go get Katherine."
John nodded, combing his fingers through Sherlock's hair. After a few minutes, he caught himself tracing his mark at the back of Sherlock's neck, hidden under the collar of his coat. He smiled softly to himself, watching the city flash by.
John drew back, practically felt his eyes dilate as he stared at Sherlock. He wasn't sure he should give that a response, wanting to say
"Can't you go any faster?!" John yelled, but the cabbie ignored him completely, which only made John more pissed. "Just stop," he demanded, throwing some cash at the driver before jumping out. He ran down the pavement, which was mostly empty due to the late hour. He had a moment of thought where he was thankful for all of his training and his time served that had kept his stamina high, but then he cast aside all thought and just focused on getting to Sherlock.
John backed away when Harry asked about his scar, looking away towards the kettle. "I don't wanna talk about it, Harry," he murmured, not wanting to upset his sister.
that Mrs Hudson had given Katherine, and she had insisted they read it nearly every day, once a day minimum. "You read Papa.... your Santa voice is best," she said, holding the book up, looking excitedly towards the chimney.
“Your fiancée is not missing,” he said bluntly, fingers steepled under his chin. “I think you’ll find her just where you don’t want to think about her being, but you already know where she is. Her ex-girlfriend’s flat. You haven’t gone there because you know you’ll find her and then you’ll have to face the fact that she’s gone back to her despite the fact that you've been under the impression that the relationship was doing well. Quite mistaken though given the current circumstance you find yourself in. Good day, do try not to cry on anything on your way out.” He gestured to the door with his hand.
John pushed to his feet, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's waist and holding him. "See?" he whispered. "You're still you, buried somewhere under all of this." He reached up, running his fingers gently through the shorter strands of Sherlock's hair at the base of his skull.
John felt a shiver race down his spine, and he trailed his lips and grazed his teeth across Sherlock's jaw and down his neck. He bit lightly over the mark on the side of Sherlock's neck. "
Sherlock looked over at the new strings and sheet music John had got him for his birthday; he'd already started to polish off the final draft of the song he'd composed.
"Not possible with me doing it," Sherlock said, standing up. He'd heard Lestrade call him blunter than sledgehammer at times.
"I wasn't planning to," John murmured, nuzzling against Sherlock's neck. "She won't push, either, and she won't tell anyone if she does figure it out." He ran a hand down Sherlock's side, running his thumb over his hip. "I love you, Sherlock," he whispered, moving closer and hooking their ankles. "I will always love you, and don't ever doubt it."
Sherlock sighed. "John, you haven't gotten any proper sleep in days." He murmured, combing his fingers into John's hair. "You need sleep, good, long sleep," he whispered.
John shook his head. "Oh, yes, you're clever, and don't I know it." He poked the tip of her nose. "But you know what happens if you don't take medicine?" he asked, setting his feet on the floor and holding his hands out, brushing the dust off when she came closer. "You get sick. And trust me, being sick is worse than any medicine."
"He's new to it and young. Not to mention growing up an in un-ideal and unorthodox way." She smiled at him and cupped his cheek. "Better go be with him."
"Harry was caught by some traders when we were kids. They were going to take me, too, until they learnt that I was an Alpha. I tried to fight them, to get her back, but I was only ten, and they were huge Betas." John blinked, scrubbing a hand over his face. "She escaped when I was sixteen, and she came home. She refused to tell us how, to just be glad that she was back. She started drinking, badly. Two years later, a month after I started at university, all of them were taken."
Sherlock leant into the kiss a little, hands at the base of John's head. He pressed his forehead against John's, letting out a breath. "You're welcome, John," he said, shifting a small bit on his lap. "I already fixed your leg... just working on the rest," he said quietly, tugging John's jumper down a little to press another kiss to his scar.
Sherlock nodded a little, watching Katherine swing back and forth. "Look Papa!" she squealed. "Look at me! You're not watching!" she called over to them. Sherlock smirked.
It was a couple hours of tuning and playing before Sherlock felt he had a good first draft of a song, a nice slow one. He wasn't sure why it ended up being that way, it just did. He looked over at John when he set down his violin. "I'm sure you're bored by now... did you want to watch the telly at all?" he asked, meandering into the kitchen to fix a snack, already hungry again.
Sherlock's hand had moved from rocking Hamish gently to resting his hand on him protectively, opening his eyes and looking at Katherine. He let out a breath, feeling a bit of anxiety where the children were concerned, not sure where it came from.
I've brought out Katherine's old pram, doing it up in green. I don't like the 'blue for baby boys' nonsense. You wanted me to update you so...I don't want to mention all of it, I'm worried it will only make you feel you are missing more, but I want it to be like you were here as it was happening, getting a nursery made, the infant clothes that seem to be coming from the woodwork they're appearing so quickly.
Sherlock heard John's tone and sat bolt upright, John talking about the kids and how he'd missed them, he was right. He was nesting earlier that day, of course he missed them. John's words now on the phone though set his senses alight and he was already in a panic, following suit and pulling on clothes. "John? John what's wrong? Where are they? Where is Hamish and Katherine? Your mother? John!" he said, impatient, panicked.
Sherlock's face crumpled a bit and he shook his head quickly. He swallowed, pulling out of John's arms. He moved across the room and picked up the broom again. His breathing was a little irregular, and he tried to sweep again, but he just threw the broom at the already broken windows. "God damn it!" he swore, throwing himself down to the floor and knotting his fingers into his hair.
Sherlock smiled at the two of them, seeing Katherine's uncoordinated attempts to try and grab at John's fingers. "Soon enough," he murmured. "Holding up her head, then eventually sitting up. Though that's at about four months on average. Her vision apparently isn't so good right now also," he said, thinking about the book he'd read when he'd been bored.
Sherlock stiffened, his thoughts slamming to a halt as he tried to rationalise it. That wasn't possible. John was gone, dead. Mycroft would have told him.
Sherlock sat up, looking at John. "You didn't eat lunch, your exhaustion level says as much, plus the ink smudges along your left hand say you were writing a lot and quickly, pressing too hard and at an angle to drag your hand so much and to have that much ink, so you weren't watching what you were writing, so you were observing something that took a lot of attention. A surgery," Sherlock explained with a shrug.
Oh my god, Sherlock, you did it. A boy. Jesus. And you said he has blond hair. Does he have my mannerisms or yours? Your eyes or mine? I wish I could have been there, and I'm so sorry for not replying. I didn't mean to scare you--I only just got back. I'm alright, I can reply now so long as I keep my messages short. Doctor's orders.
Sherlock sighed. "I don't want to. It's not his business," he muttered, knowing he'd find out regardless. "And he'll know as soon as we go to the hospital, because he'll look up why we went, and then he'll know," he said, not sure he liked how John mentioned emotional swings. "I am not going to have anything swing," he murmured quietly.
Sherlock felt kicked again, and looked down with shame, of all the things he'd said that had hurt and belittled others, John was the only one that could do the same to him. He swallowed, feeling a lump try and form in his throat. "I...I won't," he said quietly. "I promise I won't...I'll take care of her, and...and myself," he said, taking a small step towards John, wanting to be close to him. "A-and the baby," he added, "I don't want to hurt them...or you." Though it was his fear of John never coming back that was harming him more than anything.
John smiled, leaning up to kiss Sherlock gently, stealing the adorable yawn from him. "Have I ever told you how adorable you are when you're sleepy?" he asked, kissing him again. He brushed the tips of their noses together, resting his forehead against Sherlock's. "I love you," he whispered, brushing his lips across the length of Sherlock's jaw.
"He took him away because you weren't caring for him or our daughter properly, Sherlock," John reprimanded calmly. He knew better than to snap back, and he had a lot of patience lately. "And you're getting one hundred percent better, or you're not getting out of there, and I won't be home until early March. Understood?" he asked, his voice solid.
Sherlock sighed, squeezing his fingers back. "Look, just stay up until seven at least, we'll eat dinner, and then we'll all go to sleep early. This little one needs it," he murmured, rubbing her stomach again. She stirred a little, face pinching in a disgruntled frown before she settled again.
John stirred a little when he felt the bed dip down. He rolled over unconsciously, spooning himself around Katherine and Sherlock, holding onto them protectively. He nuzzled against Sherlock's shoulder, his scent filling him up and inflating him until he drifted back into deeper sleep.
John finally, after five minutes of staring, just tossed the instructions to the doll house aside and let his hands do what seemed logical. "I figured, love," he said, glancing over at Sherlock and smiling. It didn't take him all that long to put the house together once he just started working on it, and he eventually pushed it – finished – over by the tree.
John smiled softly, pressing his lips to Sherlock's overly-warm forehead and keeping them there. Whenever he felt Sherlock stir, he would gently rub his back, murmuring soft words to him, telling him some of the more light-hearted stories from Afghanistan.
John ran his hand through his hair, ruffling it a little before he got started, fitting the pieces together the way he remembered them going. It was nearly like muscle memory, though not quite. He smiled when Sherlock came back in with the other pieces, taking them from him and putting them together with the rest. By the time he was done, he was ready to sleep again, wanting to just be curled up tight with his Omega. "Bed, now," John commanded, grabbing Sherlock's hand and pulling him to the bed.
Sherlock paced a little, running his fingers through his hair. He winced, another cramp hitting him as he started to feel almost sick. "I… I have to go... stop them," he panted, moving slowly towards the door. He had to have some of that compound left, though he hardly knew what it would do to him in the middle of a heat.
Sherlock pressed a kiss to Katherine's head, murmuring quietly to her that he would be back. He stood up, walking towards the woman, recognising her. "Tell me," he said, ignoring the fact that she was looking at him odd; yes he knew, he looked rather good for a dead man. "Please," he tacked on at the end.
Sherlock lowered his violin, looking over his shoulder at John. "I can't think of what to do next... about them, I mean. There isn't anything else to go on," he said softly.
John growled, wrapping both of his arms around Sherlock and pulling him close, bracing his feet farther apart on the bed and slamming up with more force. His knot was growing rapidly again, and it wasn't long before he slammed into Sherlock, sinking all the way inside before coming forcefully, crying out Sherlock's name as he held his Omega against him.
John wasn't entirely sure how he had gotten upstairs, but he was sitting on the floor cross-legged, the box of China to his left. He turned over a cup in his hand, looking intently at the cracks in its delicate surface before he threw it at the wall. The pull on his side was nice, and the twist in his shoulder was better. The shatter of the cup was satisfying.
John snapped his hips faster, tightening his hand around Sherlock's and running his free hand along his side, smoothing over his chest. He pressed Sherlock against himself, kissing and nuzzling the back of his neck, nipping and sucking on the spot that he would eventually mark.
Sherlock whined when John pulled out of him, and he sat up a little more to reach out for John frantically, as if he was about to disappear. "John!" he said, pressing his lips to his shoulder, and his scar. "God...please," he begged, his erection almost aching, he needed John.
“Get rid of you! My dear Watson, never. I’m simply saying you should never doubt the power of two.” He moved closer to me and brought his hand to the bruise that still throbbed from being thumped. I knew his aim was not to hurt me, but I flinched as a natural reflex. He pulled his hand away as if I had screamed out in pain.
A disgruntled Sherlock emerged from the kitchen, powdered sugar on his black jacket. The other conversations had resumed, but John was still focused on the kitchen and laughed as he locked eyes with the consulting detective defeated by a land lady with a spatula. His smile fell when the expression on Sherlock’s face filled with anger at the sight of the seat beside John being occupied.
“It only felt right to return it to Mrs. Hudson,” I said with a dry throat, careful to withhold the information about the pain endured when I would finger the key to 221B in the pocket of my trousers. During Holmes’s absence, the flat was as empty as the life I led.
The days following Christmas were filled with gifts a plenty for Sherlock. Bomb threats. Blackmailing. Bodies disappearing from the morgue. Oh, it was Christmas indeed.
His lips uplifted into a genial smile. I admired their tint in which I could only compare to the pink that blends a sunset. However, whereas a sunset represents the end, Holmes’s lips portray the beginning. As such, I find myself preferring to admire the latter.
Sherlock of course had a conflicting answer to every one of John’s suggestions. It would ruin the dusting, he said. The last thing we need is for clients to give more useless information, John. In the end, they got a tree.
Letting a sigh escape his lips, he began sorting through his clothes to find something appropriate for the night. He put on a shirt he had bought during a holiday sale and tried to pretend he wasn’t influenced by Sherlock’s compliment of the it a few days ago. His best pair of shoes were selected from the back of the closet and he dusted them with the t-shirt he had worn earlier.
Mrs. Hudson looked at me in the doorway, and I nodded to her in greeting. “Why don’t you ask him yourself?” She suggested and left with no more than a curt smirk.
Afterwards, they walked in a companionable silence, looking at the sidewalks where watchers of a Christmas parade had lunged for candy a few hours before. Occasionally, the two would bump shoulders or brush arms, but they mentally blamed it on their tired state rather than acknowledge the comfort they felt by the brief touches. The only time they separated fully was when they passed an unclaimed candy cane and Sherlock bowed to pick it up.
I thought back to the photograph Miss Wessington had shown us of her with her parents. He did tower over his wife and daughter who were of average height.
Sherlock rubbed his eyes, trying to refocus his vision on the people around him instead of on the lights. “I knew it was a bad idea to bring you here.”
John tried to play along. “I heard you weren’t exactly easy to work with when the paramedics arrived.”
In hearing Holmes’s sonorous voice, I found my body replenished with energy and sprung from my bed. It wasn’t until I began down the stairs that my injuries overtook me, and I half fell down the first flight. I struggled to regain my composition but managed at last to stand upright. When I turned to continue down the rest of the stairs, I was met by the scrutinizing eyes of Holmes which looked at my injuries rather than at me.
“The doctor should be by within the next half hour or so.” The nurse offered an apologetic smile. “Can I get you anything in the meantime?”
“Maybe we should put lights on the door of the flat,” John suggested, sitting beside Sherlock on a green metal park bench that insinuated the cold of the night.
“And this is my sister Marge and my niece Erika.” Mrs. Hudson was finishing introducing John and Sherlock to the rest of the party who had arrived last on account of Sherlock's tantrums.
“That’s Mister Holmes, ain’t it? The amateur boxer that did three rounds with McMurdo? Half the boxers in London want a rematch with him.”
We spent the day solving cases from the comfort of Baker Street as clients flowed in from all corners of the world. Their luggage contained problems that had long awaited the great mind of the recently returned detective. In these moments, Holmes seemed most relaxed and was even prone to outbursts of excitement if given a peculiar enough case.
“Oh!” Sherlock exclaimed, leaping from his perch in the chair. “I almost forgot. I have a last-minute present for you.” He disappeared from the living room and John grimaced as he heard a commotion coming from Sherlock’s room. He hoped the mess was contained, not something he would have to worry himself with later.
“Although it took me some time and caused us both immense turmoil, I did return to you. Despite your name being attached to another place of residence, I ask that you always return home to me.” I heard him take a wavering breath before pressing a kiss to the side of my neck. “I know that I have no right in making such a request, but I hope you will at least always wear this constant reminder of my plea.”
“Do release my good friend and colleague Dr. John Watson. I predict you could find nothing to link either of us to the crimes you’re investigating.”
“Just the one.” He leaned closer to John, his voice a near whisper. Outside, the voices of people in the streets increased in volume. The clock read 11:59.
Admittedly, the robber did not take much of value, and Sherlock normally would give it a 2, but the case had gone from “not Lestrade’s division” to “Lestrade’s division” when a few victims became hospitalized. Within minutes of looking at one of the houses, Sherlock cleared the scene of all remaining officers, knowing the vents had been rigged to emit toxic fumes. Bad news for the families, fantastic news for the gunshot ridden walls of 221B.
“Yes, but I also gave you a concussion, eight stitches and a most likely permanent scar,” Sherlock said when he joined John by the door.
“John,” Sherlock said when he heard his flatmate’s footsteps stop. He had his back turned and was emptying shopping bags full of junk food and alcohol and cheap paper hats with the upcoming year printed on them. He placed two bottles, one wine and one champagne, on the counter with an authoritative bang. John didn’t recognize the brand but assumed it was out of his price range.
A few hours later, John was nearly finished with the tree and moving to the last of the candy canes when he noticed the entire box was missing. He had never heard Sherlock move from the sofa, but when he turned around, Sherlock was lying on his back with five candy canes in his mouth at once.
Sherlock looked at the photo even though he was well aware of what it showed. With closed lips, he smiled at the boys he held in his hand. “Class A example.” He slung it forward and it fluttered to the ground between the two of them.
“Well, what is your blog lacking? Serial murderers? Stolen jewels?” He leaned forward towards John and brought his voice to a whisper. “Vampires?”
For hours, they sat on the floor in front of the fireplace while Sherlock would explain his prior cases and John would interject with questions and praises. The conversation only ceased when John went to get blankets and pillows to make the floor more comfortable.
When he opened the door, he found Sherlock sitting with legs curled into his chair, hands steepled under his chin and eyes locked on the laptop screen before him.
It was late, almost past midnight, but John and Sherlock were walking the streets that never tired. Fueled only by John’s “fantastics” and “brilliants,” Sherlock detailed the deductions he had made to conclude the murder of mall owner Regis Thompson was committed by the Santa who had just been hired to take photos with children in the food court. All Sherlock needed was record of the recent changes in personnel before he was forcing Santa (actually named Yusuf Tekin) to confess to being hired by the owner’s wife to stage her husband's death and collect the insurance money.
“I would have. I might still do so if he would be so inclined as to make an appearance, for it would surely be his undoing and my sweet revenge.” He smiled deviously at his last words which were taken from the worn sheet of paper he held against the light.
“Well, maybe he’d be a better fight than his biographer.” Dixie hypothesized, using his thumb and forefinger to flick the bruise that possessed most of the right side of my face.
John looked at his own hands, folded gently in his lap and back to the one jittering next to him. He reached out and covered Sherlock’s much colder hand with his own. Sherlock snapped his head forward to look at the hands on his knee.
Upon hearing this outburst, the other boxers in the gym began to swarm Holmes, herding us until we were side by side.
It was John who suggested they get a tree. He presented the reasons to Sherlock that went as follows: 1) It would liven up the place and make it feel warmer. 2) Some holiday spirit might even help clients open up while detailing their cases. 3) C'mon Sherlock, it's just a tree.
“Head wounds, you know what a mess they are,” Sherlock pretended to make light of the situation, but John could sense the unease in his tone.
“Actually, I was rather hoping-” Sherlock twirled towards John on the toe of his foot but stopped abruptly upon scanning John’s clothes. “Oh.”
“Alright, that’s enough.” John stepped away from Sherlock’s embrace and returned the violin to its master.
On the morning after, I would rise before daylight and leave the flat before I could be spotted. Other times, I would forget about our promise to Mycroft and stay until the first client arrived. Holmes and I would simply lie in his bed and watch the rising sun through the windows, ourselves immune to its call.
“‘We have much to hope from the flowers,’” I unknowingly mumbled. They were not words of my own, for I was simply repeating a line I had once heard Holmes say.
“But you love it when I read to you. C’mon, now. I can’t be late for London’s finest violin concerto.”
Finally, around 5 PM, John texted a simple “where are you” to Sherlock’s number. By 6:00, he hadn’t received an answer and became more frustrated every time he checked his phone.
His gaze fell from its fixation upon my own and his expression turned to shame. I moved to apologize but stopped myself, knowing I was not the one who needed forgiveness. Instead, I took one of the roses from the vase and turned it over in my hands, mindful of its fragility.
John moved on without comment. “The tree really did liven up the place. Lights at the entrance would too. And it would make it easier to get the key in the door late at night.”
“Of course he is, that captain of mine. Two broken ribs and he still carries a gun in his breast pocket.”
“That’s a good point. Do I need braces?” John showed her his teeth jokingly, earning a laugh from Erika.
“Watson, how can you forgive me? You have done nothing to deserve this, but it is yours to deal with.”
In actuality, there was no “they” to the ordeal. Sherlock rushed out on some lead one day, and John went to the store for groceries but ended up with a tree instead. He picked one of the smallest in the bunch, thin but tall, not wanting to crowd the living room or lug a massive tree back to the flat alone. After managing to make it up the stairs to the flat, he realized Sherlock was still away and took the opportunity to go to the store for ornaments and lights. As a result, he set the tree up in a hurry, leaving it leaning and skewed in its stand.
Therefore, when John stumbled to the kitchen the morning of December 31, he was not surprised to find Sherlock absent from the flat. He spent the day typing up the cases from the week and subconsciously glancing at the door.
Sherlock secretly chose to play his violin close to the tree. As a child, he always had fake trees as real ones leave firs on the carpet that his mother fussed about for an entire holiday season once before Sherlock was born. Mycroft told the story to him one Christmas Eve, about how he woke up one morning and the tree he had spent hours picking out had just disappeared. It was replaced by a brand new false pine and extra presents for little Mycroft.
Crimes were just as plentiful and malicious during the holidays but solving them was much more festive. On this night, the consulting detective and his doctor found themselves in an upper-class neighborhood where each house donned expensive light displays but were also the most likely place for their alleged robber to make his next move.
We walked the fields and trails as easily as we strolled along the city sidewalks of London. Holmes would lecture me on the different varieties of moss and their chemical compositions and perhaps even ask my professional opinion on its use in old medical remedies. I was satisfied in simply listening to my friend’s voice without interruption and helping the country-folk whose issues were often overlooked by London authorities.
It was unusual for Holmes to dismiss a case with peculiar facts such as these. I looked towards him, but his gaze remained fixed on the path that lay before us. As for myself, I was constricted only to his whim.
I attempted to reply but found that I did not possess an answer. Without looking in my direction, Holmes rose from his chair, put on his coat and was gone, leaving me with nothing but the order that I was to resume life as normal and limit my visits to Holmes. Indefinitely.
An expression overtook Holmes in which I had seen few times during our many years together. I was reminded of him by the fire, flames in his eyes. He turned to uppercut Dixie, but my hand was already around his wrist as I drug him towards the door.
John picked up the photo but knew the subject was closed. “So where should I start?” He asked, bringing the champagne glass to his lips.
John knew logically that the candy was uncontaminated but something about picking food off the streets of London made him uneasy. Nonetheless, Sherlock unwrapped the candy cane but left some plastic along the bottom to hold it without touching the candy. Starting near his fingers, he licked from the base up and followed the curve at the top. Either time slowed in John’s perception or Sherlock performed this act in slow motion.
“The paramedics said he fussed about you for ages. Nothing they did was right according to him.” She sort of laughed as she said this, and John laughed along, not sure what he was laughing at.
Sherlock reemerged with a black trunk adorned with a brass lock and decorative garnishes that caught the blaze of the fire in their shine. The lock hung open and Sherlock discarded it behind him. He paused for a moment, hand resting on the lid before tossing it back.
“You look great,” John said, handing Sherlock his suit jacket. “Like Christmas morning.” When Sherlock rolled his eyes, John could not help but grin in amusement.
John made a mental note to clean out his friends’ list. “Just come with me. Please? We can leave whenever you start feeling uncomfortable.”
We rode in silence for a ways until sentiment got the better of me, and I had to reapproach the matter. “I know I haven’t been of much use on this case, but if that’s some kind of attempt to get rid of me…”
Sherlock refrained from telling John that his inability to connect the key to the hole was not from the darkness but from his deteriorating eyesight in his older age. After all, Sherlock had no issues with unlocking the door. Instead, he replied, “The flat is where I run my business, not a suburban family home.”
worried when he said you were in the hospital. I told him he better start taking care of you because friends are all we have in the end, you know. Then he grabbed the lights and ran off before I could ask if you were okay.”
“Are these…” John trailed off, reading the words in a hurry and attempting to make sense of the context.
Sherlock stepped closer to John and put an arm around his shoulders to which John stiffened at the unnaturalness of the touch. “Mrs. Hudson, if you would excuse us, we have a concussion to attend to, and I’m sure John would like to get some rest.”
When the kisses grew sloppier and they had both had two more drinks, John fell asleep in the living room for the second time this week. The difference was that this instance was intentional, and he was awake to pull Sherlock closer when he shifted to rest his head on top of John’s chest. Sherlock lied there for quite some time, listening to the breath that filled the man he loved.
“You know better, old boy. One of us bruised up is enough. What good would two be?” I asked outside as Holmes loosened his tie.
Thanks to the experience of gained in other social situations, John had learned it is best to silence Sherlock and explain later at the risk of offending the third party. As such, John placed a sharp elbow in Sherlock’s ribs. Luckily, Marge and Erika seemed to not notice his comment.
For a while, the conversation looked to be civil. I allowed my focus to become lost in the trance of the boxer’s movements which was only broken by hearing Holmes’s voice commanding the attention of the room.
It was long after dinner before we were alone again. Holmes puffed on his pipe in a heroic fashion, having conquered even the most complicated of the day’s headaches. I sat opposite and looked over my notes until my eyes grew weary.
When he returned an hour later, he found Sherlock lying on the sofa and the tree immaculately placed near the fireplace. It was so straight, he swore Sherlock had to have used a level. A tape measure still sat on the mantle from when Sherlock measured the distance between the fireplace and the wall, making sure the tree sat exactly in the middle.
The matter of my lodgings was almost settled until I entered 221B one morning to find Holmes and his older brother waiting for me in the sitting room. Mycroft explained it would be in our best interest to postpone my move. With Sherlock’s name back in the papers, we were under constant scrutiny, and he feared what may happen if our true relations were discovered.
John began to turn around in confusion, but Sherlock rested his hands on his shoulders to keep John facing away from him. When John stilled, Sherlock put one hand over John’s where it rested on the neck of the violin and brought the body of it to John’s shoulder. Sherlock pressed his chest to the expanse of John’s back to better see the fingerboard.
John attempted to move the conversation back to the case and take his mind off his best friend’s tongue. “I can’t believe we arrested Santa. I take it we aren’t making the nice list this year?”
John looped his finger through the curve in the candy cane and pulled it from Sherlock’s lips. He slid his mouth along its entirety and pulled it out again, making sure to exaggerate the popping sound as he had seen Sherlock do so often. “What good would you be then?” he asked, passing the candy cane back to Sherlock.
John looked down at the hardwood beneath his feet. Marks and chips graced every square foot of the flooring. “A pity,” he said under his breath while unpacking the decorations he had bought for the tree.
“Your bag, Dr. Watson.” At the end of his extended arm, my surgery bag dangled from the tips of his fingers. I exchanged a kiss for the bag and left the room, our departures always quick in order to be as painless as possible.
Taking Sherlock’s glass and his own, John arose from his position on the floor and went to the kitchen to refill their drinks. “Let me hear it from you.”
Therefore, this tree brought a new aspect to the holidays. Although he wouldn’t admit it, even to himself, he loved the smell. The scent of pine took him back to the yard he played in as a child and filled him with warmth. For the first time, he realized John’s cologne had hints of pine.
On the other hand, John could not have been more intrigued with Erika. “Thank you. That means a lot.”
“I brought you these.” Sherlock placed a duffle at the foot of the bed and pulled out fresh clothes from John’s closet.
“We’ll rest here. We have just short of half an hour before Mrs. Wessington arrives and the advantage in height gives us a favorable view of both the stable house and the main entrance. You do have your revolver?”
I had often written of Holmes’s machinelike manner in dealing with others, but the disregard he showed for me hurt far worse than the injuries I sustained. It was true that he could disengage his emotions to better solve a case, but I found the times in which he worked with passion to be more of note. Therefore, you can imagine my disappointment to find I was just a weapon in Holmes’s artillery, nothing more.
Once inside the gym, Holmes made directly for Dixie who spotted me instantly upon entering the room. At first, I had planned to remain by Holmes’s side, but in seeing Dixie’s wicked smile, I opted to linger near the ring and keep watch of the others.
For a while, we stood awkwardly in our places. We were unaccustomed to gift-giving and neither of us wanted to be the first to engage.
John averted his eyes from the closing door to his phone that now lie on the table and felt a pang of guilt in his chest. He
The house functioned as normal, showing no sign of a fire or distress. No one came in or out. Holmes pushed out of my coat and pulled his own tighter around his body. I inhaled sharply in the absence of his heat. Subconsciously, I reached for him, but he was already descending upon the house. I followed, the blanket waving behind me.
On some nights, Sherlock would receive a lead and consider it necessary to investigate without delay. Rarely would Sherlock shake him awake as a result of a night when John was particularly exhausted and hit him so hard with a pillow upon entering his bedroom that Sherlock was knocked to the floor.
“If you’re feeling up to it, my dear Watson, I would be much obliged if you’d accompany me to further investigate some leads.”
He ascended the stairs without so much as a second glance towards me. After hearing the closing of Mrs. Maberley’s bedroom door, I allowed myself to slouch against the wall and slide to the floor. Dora rushed to my side, but I waved her away.
For a moment, Sherlock left John lying on their makeshift palate on the floor and moved without sound to the tree. He rustled in his pocket for his folding knife and cut off a small portion of a branch. From behind the tree, he took another black leather-bound journal from the bookshelf, this one empty except for the pages where he intended to write of the instances mostly recounted above. Between the front cover and the first page, he pressed the branch and returned the journal to the shelf.
Holmes leaned into me, resting the back of his head against my chest and letting his eyes flutter shut. His body blocked the wind and sent warmth through my chilled figure. I wrapped him in the excess of my coat, knowing he was prone to colds and appreciating the contact in which was normally absent on cases.
Mycroft left shortly after our resolve, but his brother continued to sit motionless until I placed a hand on his shoulder. He flinched at the contact before he realized to whom the hand belonged.
Sherlock felt John’s laughter resonate throughout his body and struggled to maintain concentration. No sound he could produce from this instrument could properly express how much he longed to hold John like this in a different context, without the guise of violin lessons.
With my walking stick in one hand and my other holding Holmes’s arm, we searched the fields overlooking the Wessington estate for any signs of footprints or other human life. Stopping within view of the front door, Holmes laid out the blanket he had wrapped around him and motioned for me to sit.
“Against a 6’5” trained boxer with equally impressive an arm span? That would take more than an army doctor and a detective to defeat.” The experiment on the table hissed as he added a reagent. “But I think if we could have taken the blows together, they would have hurt less. I say again that I should have been there.”
“That’s a good friend you have, aye?” She stressed the word “friend” as if she was unsure if it was the correct wordage.
For a small community, Harrow possessed a talented and able handed doctor. He wrapped my broken ribs and removed the glass from my face where it had almost nearly grazed my eye. After leaving me with some materials of my own to redress the wounds, he departed from the room where I lay, thinking of how I was to explain my failure in protecting The Three Gables to Holmes.
I moved with leaden steps around the flat, collecting my things from the places where I dropped them without thought, forgetting that I was only a guest to 221B.
“Oh, yes. Of course, dear.” She moved out of the doorway and the two began to climb the stairs to the flat when Mrs. Hudson took John’s arm. “Before you go. I’m having a little get together tomorrow with some of the ladies around town for Christmas, and I would love it if you'd come.”
“Good things, I hope,” Erika giggled in between words. “We’re big fans of the blog.” She smiled, flashing John teeth in a meticulously constructed organization.
Finally, in the afternoon of the next day, Holmes requested my assistance. I was sitting in what had become my chair by the fire of Baker Street while he examined the paper the burglar was evidently so interested in.
I heard him rise from his chair and walk towards where I was standing. I had my back turned, but I could feel his eyes scrutinizing every inch of my exposed skin.
“You did this?” John got out of the cab and stepped forward to better see the lights outlining the door. They were colored, almost perfectly matching the tree and stood out in a harsh contrast against the black lacquer of the front door. He thought of the way the lights of the tree shone off the silk of Sherlock’s hair and wished for the sound of a violin without the pain of a headache.
Once outside, I found our man in the gazebo, bent over the desk where Mrs. Maberley’s grandson had once sat writing his book. Upon noticing my presence, he straightened his spine to reveal the true marvel of his height. I recognized him at once to be Steve Dixie, the man who had threatened Holmes against meddling in Harrow’s business that very morning. The visit had been a short and unpleasant one, for he had lifted Holmes against the windowsill, and I had threatened him with the fire poker.
When John couldn't provide an answer, Sherlock stepped closer still and dramatized his height. John knew he was shorter, but he used every inch of his height with efficiency. He straightened his shoulders and lengthened his neck, looking up at Sherlock, but bringing him down to his level with the intensity in his eyes.
Giving up on the attempt to ignite a conversation, John turned to his own window when he saw 221B coming into view.
I only nodded. In his acknowledging of my injuries, I became aware of my ribs aching beneath their wrap for the first time in hours. “I’ll just be a moment,” I promised, rising from my seat to redress my wounds.
“Not if I can help it.” Sherlock smirked, sliding his lips along the candy cane and pulling it out again with a pop. John both hated and loved that noise.
, John.” The two of them had gone through this conversation twice already today. Sherlock would beg, John would insist upon going to Mrs. Hudson’s lunch and Sherlock would protest in silence. Now, Sherlock was lying on his back on the sofa with the Union Jack throw pillow covering his face.
“Shut up,” Sherlock ordered, ripping the suit jacket from John’s hands. He looked back into the mirror and tried to ignore the blush forming in his cheeks.
“Well, if you’re such the expert…” Sherlock waved his hand and put the candy cane back into his mouth.
After a moment of entangling limbs and trading places, they landed parallel to the fireplace, Sherlock behind John with his arm draped across the man’s waist.
Sometimes, John would forget the facts. After a particularly engaging case, he would rub Sherlock’s back, squeeze his shoulders or be too loose lipped in praise. John would dwell on these moments but decide they were probably just interpreted as brotherly gestures. He almost wished Sherlock knew the truth instead.
I turned to face him, and he examined me for some time, fingers hovering above my ribs and every bruise on my body. I did my best to explain how long each would take to heal to which he blankly nodded. When he reached the bruises and cuts on my face, he hesitated before instead placing his hands on my hips and pulling me in to place a kiss on my cheek, one so soft that I wondered if I had actually felt it or only wished to. As I looked up to meet his eyes, I again saw the flames, but this time they warmed without burning.
John chose another journal. When he opened it, a photo fell to the floor of a teenaged Sherlock with another boy of his age. “Who’s this?”
John shrugged away the thought. “None of that was your fault, but I really appreciate all of this anyway.” He gestured to his clothes and the lights.
John reminded himself to update his readers about Sherlock’s ever growing knowledge of the solar system. “What about you? Do you have any resolutions?”
I attempted to lighten the tone. “Gifts? On Valentine’s Day? Either our time apart has changed you or you have much to apologize for,” I teased.
He ignored my warning. “Betray me again and I’ll destroy you. Follow my exact directions, and we may make a deal. Hmm?”
“Its smell and colour are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it,” Holmes whispered, finishing his own quote. “However, I would argue that the embellishments of life are somewhat conditional,” he handled the conversation as gently as I held the rose, conscious of the possibility of it crumbling in his control.
But it was simply a necessity for my cover as a retired army doctor who could hardly live on his pension and therefore had to rely on extra income.
I walked beside him, feeling the fever pulsing through my veins. I, John Hamish Moriarty, would now finally face Sherlock Holmes. Me, his nemesis, his arch-rival, of whom he knew nothing yet, but soon would.
"On the other hand," Sherlock now mused, "such things should also be suitable as a kind of sexual foreplay. At the moment, it's impossible to think of anything like that. Even though when I cuddle, I begin to feel something that I can sort out as feelings of lust after extensive research. When you nibble my earlobe, my primary sexual organ responds by sending tingling signals through my body and it also begins to stiffen minimally. However, at the moment, harder sexual practices are not for me."
He was blushing now too. He, the great Sherlock Holmes. I can't even put into words how much I was enjoying the situation right now.
My mind raced and I searched for the best way to convince him of the non-dangerousness of the planned appearance.
It was the same old story as it always comes up. A young man with debts, a valuable object that is easy to steal, the stolen suspecting something, a heated argument and in the end someone is dead.
First, I wanted to let Sherlock believe, at least temporarily, that I had accepted the open relationship.
Of course, he had said nothing about "Sherlock's" presence. He had not only concealed this from Lestrade. Because it was clear that his mental... his mental shortcomings were not to be made public. Not now, anyway.
So it was anything but a miracle that John's grief was not ordinary, and that he had apparently not yet really come out of the phase of shock, even though Sherlock's jump had now been several months ago.
I coughed. He just told him... but that was Sherlock. If he thought it was the logical solution to a problem, he'd do it.
Sherlock was sitting on the floor in the back of one of the ambulances and had some ridiculous orange emergency blanket draped over his shoulders.
By now he was sure that not just an informant, but Moriarty himself must have been socialising in Sherlock's immediate vicinity.
"What are you talking about, Sherlock..." chirped Mrs Hudson, who was flitting through our flat with a tea tray.
"John, I just want you to be happy. I know that I can't give you everything that you need, at least not yet. So it's best for both of us if you take it somewhere else."
"I've been instructed to introduce you to him, as an old acquaintance of mine, and I don't understand why. And by whom."
Or, as Greg would probably say, who generally expressed himself in a much more down-to-earth way (heavens, it was still a mystery to me what the two found in each other): I had a murderous boner.
"There are four," Sherlock said, looking out the window. I could tell by the flickering light that there must be a police car down there.
Moriarty, this criminal, had not only committed countless crimes, had not only driven Sherlock to his death, no, now he was also beginning to poison John's mind with suspicion.
Meanwhile, Mycroft began bombarding his brother with penetrating text messages urging him to take care of the lost Bruce Partington plans.
I looked at his face, it was bright red, he was embarrassed, and yet he too seemed to enjoy the situation.
This morning Sherlock had been a figment of his imagination. A dead figment. Then he had learned that Sherlock had not died, as John had believed, and had hoped for a few seconds that he was still alive. Only to learn that he had died after all. Only to learn shortly afterwards that he was neither a figment of his imagination, nor dead, but alive and kicking and real ... and now this ... the man he loved and thought he had lost was sitting alive and kicking in front of him, telling him that he loved him too ...
He was clearly upset. Well, my mood was not the best either, especially as I still had an unpleasant headache.
I moaned, sweat ran down my naked skin while my fingers ran up and down my shaft; teasing my glans; my other hand stroking my testicles.
Punctually at the desired time, I stood in front of the given address. I had just pressed the door knocker when a taxi stopped and Sherlock Holmes got out with his coat flowing.
And yes, there were apparently, scientifically proven, such cases where the patient (John hated to think of himself as the patient, but it was probably time to face the facts.... ) got so carried away with the wish that the deceased was still alive that he himself performed acts that the loved one was supposed to have performed in order to delude himself that he was still there; and the fact that in such cases the patient himself did not remember committing the acts was probably not an uncommon phenomenon.
She did not regret a single thing she had done. Not a crime. Not an assault. No murder. No torture, no torment, no psychological terror, no attack.
'I hope I haven't taken on too much. I've stepped into shoes that are too big for me. I'll never be up to this task, I'm afraid I'll disappoint them all.'
His eyes were shining like feverish, his breath came in puffs and, well, on my thigh I felt that his penis had stiffened quite a bit.
"Well, John, would you do me the kindness of telling me what the state of things is between you and Sherlock?"
John asked them all to sit down, and when they did, he and Sherlock began to explain what they thought they had found out.
Mycroft made a sort of snort that, with a lot of good will, could have been interpreted as Mycroft giggling.
I wasn't on duty today, so I did the shopping, there was nothing in the house again, while Sherlock was doing some experiments at the kitchen table. You know, the usual.
"Listen, Richard. I can promise you that nothing will happen to you. Not by Moriarty. I know that because ..."
"I'm so sorry, John. I just thought you understood that I didn't want anyone but you to know about my survival. After all, you're the person I trust most in this world."
It was an adrenaline-fuelled situation and I enjoyed it deeply. But most of all I enjoyed the fact that all my planning seemed to lead exactly to the desired goal.
"Because I love him? Because I care about him more than anything? But damn it, you don't know these things!"
What the hell was going on here? John tried to grasp and sort out the situation somehow. But he simply did not know what was happening to him.
Vain little brat. But he did look adorable. And damn it, a little bit I envied him. I was just tired of jeans and knitted jumpers.
To be precise, he had received all the instructions by encrypted e-mail with self-deletion function from "Moriarty" and not from his beloved John.
I, however, was clingy that night. I wrapped my arms around him and tried to snuggle up. He took his fingers off the keyboard of my laptop and turned to me and looked at me. His eyes appeared inscrutably dark.
And then he pushed me onto the sofa before I could swallow my tongue in fright, and kissed me wildly and violently, so that I became quite dizzy.
They had started the initial rumours that had eventually led Sherlock to jump off the roof of St. Bart's.
And of course, that didn't go unnoticed. I sat on the sofa, Sherlock knelt over my lap and we kissed. Our middles touched. And that's when he felt it.
"Well jump already. Put an end to this Molly. You have my word that your reputation as the King of Criminals will be upheld. But now leave with decorum. Go!"
And then came the day when the police found out that the one who had shot himself on the roof of the Bart's had only been a petty actor and that Moriarty had fooled them all and was in fact still alive.
As the usual time approached, and I didn't bother to get ready to go out, I felt Sherlock's look on me again, this time a questioning look.
A waiter was immediately at our seat, and we both ordered a snack and jasmine tea. When the food was brought in, Mycroft closed the door.
An hour later I found myself at Sherlock's side in the Bart's laboratory. There he was examining the shoes to find out their secret.
"Well, and because I seek my more adventurous pleasure elsewhere, with his knowledge and consent, he has the right to find other partners for his nissionary sex. That's perfectly fine since we both want it and accept it."
"There are four and there must be something different about the last one. Otherwise Lestrade wouldn't come to me."
It's been a long time since I committed my first murder. I was still a "child" then, at least in terms of age. I killed a boy in a swimming pool and it was so easy. I acted like a normal teenager then, like everyone else my age. I had found that if you behave normally, adapted and inconspicuous and then have my intellect, then you can do anything. And get away with anything.
He actually thought about it in the following days. The calls had already stopped on the same day, and it was also possible to step outside the door again without being besieged by a mob. So Mycroft had kept his promise.
"And you, Mycroft, are yet to answer me how you dared to know about this and keep me in the dark. I watched you retreat even more than usual into your armour of ice, thinking it was out of grief for your brother. And so I held back ... oh damn."
And so it happened, which is completely normal when you are cuddling wildly on the sofa with your lover: My penis was in extreme erection, as Mycroft would have put it.
She widened her eyes, knowing that her big brown doe eyes were giving off that "Oh please, please don't hurt me, I'm so little!" look.
"John, I'm a thinker. My heart is only there to pump blood and supply oxygen to my brain to keep it so highly efficient. That's how I've always seen it, anyway ..."
As I was writing this, I had already thrown on my jacket, stormed past my boss' room and shouted something about "I have to go, it's an emergency!“ I could well imagine her rolling her eyes.
First, his mobile phone rang. He picked it up and had a completely distraught, sobbing Mrs. Hudson on the line.
"Are you sure Lestrade was here earlier? And that all this isn't just another figment of my imagination?"
They had believed the rumours. No, to say so was perhaps unfair, but they had investigated on the basis of the rumours. Believed false leads. Taken false assumptions at face value. And then it had got out of hand, because when the press had got word that Scotland Yard was investigating, there had been even more noise in the papers.
As he stood in front of the door, it went through his mind how reckless this had just been. He was alone in the house. Maybe he should have his gun with him next time ...
“So Erika,” John said louder than necessary while keeping eye contact with Sherlock, “I hear you’re a dentist?”
With no plan in mind, he descended the stairs from his room and tried to think of a bar that would not be entirely awkward to visit alone on New Year’s Eve.  He was mumbling out loud to himself about needing a girlfriend when a dark silhouette in the kitchen caused him to jump in alarm before realizing to whom it belonged.
Settling for the only chair left, Sherlock slouched slightly in his seat but pretended to be unbothered. Only John, hyperaware of Sherlock’s impeccable posture and manners could notice a difference.
“Sherlock, you know I am never truly home unless I am with you,” I turned to face Holmes and stroked his cheek with a wavering hand. “I spent years trying to find what only you could bring.”
He accepted his luck and the offer in regards to the other room at 221B. Since then, John has laid down his life for the detective and would again with no hesitation. He’d even follow him on a case and get his head smashed by a deranged criminal with a baseball bat which, as he now knew from experience, would lead to the hospital bed where he currently lay.
They moved without a destination in mind, inhaling each other with all their senses. They thought of no one else but knew this is how the act was supposed to feel.
Selecting one of the few candy canes left on the tree, Sherlock collapsed into his chair and lowered his eyebrows, struggling to remember the details of a case solved decades ago. “Mr. Ferguson had a son with his first wife and then remarried fifteen years later after her death. His second wife gave birth to another son to which the eldest was immensely jealous. Thanks to Mycroft, I had become rather an expert on recognizing sibling jealousy.” He had intended to complete the story but John interrupted with his own theory.
He placed his lips to John’s neck with gentle hesitation. “John, in the morning. Will you keep me? Or am I just a meaningless resolution?”
John crossed the room and picked up Sherlock’s violin. He took a moment to turn it over in his hands and felt strange holding something that he had considered an extension of Sherlock. He felt something within him similar to gratitude for the violin and what it had given him.
Sherlock did not reply for a moment, only smirked and traced the candy cane with his tongue. “Excellent, doctor. Perhaps I needed a medical man all along.”
“Ask me again next New Year’s.” John replied, turning on his other side to pull Sherlock into another kiss.
Letting out a shaky breath, John placed his chin on the chin rest before him. Sherlock brought the bow to the strings and demonstrated how to properly hold it and produce a sound. John giggled within learning two notes, realizing Sherlock was teaching him the chorus to Jingle Bells.
I stopped mid-step and turned to Holmes, asking through gritted teeth, “Are you suggesting I should have shot the man?”
“It wasn’t a joke to Robert Ferguson who found his son in the arms of his wife while she was sucking blood from the baby’s neck.”
“I was worried you might leave it the way it was. Bad enough that you put a scratch in the floor moving it in here.”
We spent the remainder of the day visiting those involved with the case. I believed us to be no closer to solving the problem than we were that morning, but Holmes insisted we were nearing the end. He promised we had only one stop left before we could return to Baker Street for dinner and rest the case until the morning.
When the food was set, John allowed himself to relax and be convinced that he was under no responsibility to Sherlock. At the present, his only concern was being involved in the conversation. He told himself it was Christmas spirit, not an attempt to better know Erika.
Sherlock sat in his chair without comment, his eyes fixated upon the floor in front of his feet. I noticed the lines above his brow which told a story much like the lines of book. He had aged beyond his years during our time apart, though I may never know the entirety of his trials. He said nothing, but I could hear him warning me against the dangers of putting my heart before logic. I relented.
I could not reply as my throat was in too dry of a state to permit words.  It was then that I noticed a glimmer from the flowers. Tucked within the blush-colored petals was a silver chain donning a matching key. Perhaps at another time and under different circumstances, Holmes would have commented on my shortcomings of observance. Instead, he took the necklace from my hands and stepped behind me to fasten it around my neck.
Sherlock waved his hand along the bottles and junk food like a magician revealing his final illusion. “I was rather hoping you would like to spend New Year’s here. With me.”
Before I could reply, my face was pressed into the side of the house and my hands were being held behind my back. I made no struggle against my restraint out of a mix of surprise in the situation and comfort in knowing that Holmes remained free and unfettered in case he needed to come to my aid.
John looked to Sherlock who had set his jaw and was tapping his foot against the hardwood floors. He tilted his head at John and tried to beg without looking too desperate.
I thought of the fire and our post-case relaxation that seemed so distant. The blanket did little to absorb the dampness of the ground or protect against the hardness of the earth. In this sea of grass animated by the chilled wind of the season, I longed for dryness and warmth. We want fires where they’re warranted and nature until it surrounds us. Everything in containment.
When Holmes returned from his supposed death, I immediately suggested I sell my practice and resume residence at 221 Baker Street. Although I was still bitter from Holmes’s betrayal, I clung to every moment with him, knowing the pain that came with the alternative. As such, I tried everything in my power to pick up our lives where they left off before that fateful day at the Reichenbach Falls.
For what felt more like an hour, we waited on the hill. I had shifted Holmes to where I could now rest my chin upon his hair. Eventually, a cart pulling Mrs. Wessington made its appearance, but we kept our position.
“I suppose it’s best I be off,” I decided at last. The cloud of smoke across the room hummed in agreement.
Before he could formulate a question, John was on his feet and chasing the alleged robber who threw up his hands in submission without a fight. Sherlock handed John the handcuffs he had taken from Anderson’s desk.
“Family?” Sherlock asked to no one in particular. He tried to define the word in the context of John’s life. No wife or children. No contact with his sister. Sherlock even noted that John had abandoned dating as he no longer shaved before going to the supermarket, a habit he engaged in subconsciously.
“You know what? I shouldn’t be surprised.” Violin still in hand, John turned to the window and watched the Christmas traffic in the streets. “How about this? As a Christmas present to each other, you play something for me and I’ll read some of
“Young man, you put that back!” Mrs. Hudson could not be seen from the dining room, only heard. “Eat the food first, then you can have as many sweets as your tiny body can hold.”
Disappointment flowed through him when their brief conversation had been interrupted by dishes being placed on the table and everyone taking their seats. John reached for a chair next to another empty seat, leaving a spot for Sherlock, but when he glanced around the room, the detective was nowhere to be found. Another well-manicured hand rested on the back of the chair beside him.
When Sherlock tired of playing, he joined John on the couch and took his laptop from where it sat on the coffee table. They sat in silence, Sherlock staring at the screen and John at the spot where Sherlock had stood in front of the tree.
At the sudden removal of the pressure against my back, I stumbled to regain my footing and turned to face my capturer. In fact, two men stood behind me, Mr. Wessington and a police officer.
John felt a firm but brief tap against his foot from under the table. He looked up from his mashed potatoes to Sherlock who raised his eyebrows and nudged his head towards the door.
“Although we could live without life’s few embellishments, would it all be worth it? For instance, you, my dear Watson, are an embellishment of my life. I proved recently that I could live and breathe without you, but did I want to?”
She continued, “They eventually had to ask him to leave. He came straight here, and demanded to see the doctor, but he left when he saw you. It’s lucky he was with you and kept you warm like he did. Otherwise, you might have-"
This case in particular had grabbed Holmes’s attention because of the Yard’s assurance that nothing was to be feared despite the citizens’ persistence that evil lurked among the townsfolk. The Yard was hardly to be blamed as the local authorities despised outside interference despite their incompetence. Legend told that the town was the most haunted in England. The lore originated with a fire that eradicated a wealthy family and their servants. Stories of their haunting over the town were told at every gathering and tavern. Thirty years later, isolated fires began occurring from seemingly no cause and killing or seriously disfiguring prominent individuals throughout the countryside. A letter was found at each scene, entirely blank except for the seal of the poor family who met the same fate so many years ago.
“You’re right, it is Christmas. That’s why we’re going to go downstairs and visit with others celebrating the holiday. Besides, we already promised Mrs. Hudson we would at least make an appearance.”
“Shouldn’t I? I send my most valuable resource to stay the night in a house where I was certain of danger, and I’m somehow surprised to receive a telegram saying he’s been brutally attacked with no word of his condition.”
John re-centered himself. Case. Running. Baseball bat. Hospital bed. Louder than normal heart monitor. No Sherlock. Nurse is back. Is this the same one? Very nice blue eyes.
John leaned forward with great caution. He half expected something to jump out of the trunk. Instead, he found stacks of paper and used journals. Grabbing a black leather-bound journal from the top, he opened it and recognized the handwriting in an instant. Except these words were written with a less confident hand and appeared younger than the letters he knew.
Eventually, I coaxed myself into reality. Although the violin playing had dissipated, I was soothed to hear the rumbling of familiar voices down the hall. Just as I was entering the consulting room, Mrs. Hudson was placing our breakfast around a bouquet of roses that were not present the night before. Between Holmes’s return and the defeat of Moran, I had understandably lost track of the days. From the pocket of my vest, I pulled my watch which read February 14th.
John couldn’t help but grin at the sound. Sherlock smiled back, the shy one he reserved only for John. The nurse left the room without further comment, but Sherlock glared at her anyway.
Later, John would write in his blog that the worst sound to hear upon waking up is a heart monitor. He won’t write about his disappointment upon finding his flatmate had went home a few hours ago or about the guilt he felt for being angry. After all, the case was far from finished, and Sherlock would never postpone investigating a lead to sit bedside with an unconscious John.
The two rearranged the living room to better suit their plans for the night. They played Cluedo and agreed that the loser had to wear the all paper hats at once for the entirety of the night. Sherlock did not play by the rules and eventually neither did John. In the end, they agreed to both wear one hat. The TV in the corner prevented any silence as it played reruns of the parade and showed coverage of the events happening around town. John praised himself for being absent to all of them.
He and the other boxer moved in front of us as to better examine Holmes who had stopped upon hearing his name resurface in the conversation. The boxer clasped his hands together in a sudden realization. “No, I remember it well now. It was a funny name like that.”
His sentence was cut short by the cab arriving at Baker Street to which my exhaustion greeted wearily. After entering the flat, we went our separate ways, him to his chemistry table and me to my medicine bag. I cautiously removed my shirt and the wrapping around my ribs, sensing Holmes’s eyes with every movement. I would have left the matter alone, but I could sense it lingering in his mind.
Of all the cases we had encountered throughout the years, perhaps my most preferred were the ones in which my companion and I took to the countryside. The slower pace allowed Holmes’s mind to relax, and he relished in predicting the habits of each innkeeper and farmer. We pretended to be inconvenienced by cases that required us to leave London, but the change in scenery was often welcomed among us.
They both fell asleep on the sofa that night, Sherlock after John. He studied John’s movements, the way his breath filled his chest and the way the lights from the tree made his skin glow. After much debate and with a few deliberate changes to their positioning, Sherlock finally fell asleep with his head on John’s chest and hoped he made it look like an accident.
During a summer night in 1896, Holmes and I found ourselves separated during one of the many cases which normally brought us together. However, in this instance, a little old lady found herself without protection during a time Holmes felt was to be filled with danger. As such, I volunteered myself to stay the night with the woman, Mrs. Maberley, in her house affectionately known as The Three Gables.
"Such as?" Sherlock said as he rose from the sofa and moved closer to John. He chose one of the five candy canes to continue sucking on and let it hang on the edge of his mouth like the experienced cigarette smoker he was at one time.
In the streets below, he could hear people making their way to New Year’s Eve parties. John longed to be a part of those people, to have a life that didn’t revolve around the man who wouldn’t answer his phone. He stood and went to his room, making the decision to become one of those people.
Behind him, Sherlock smirked and arose from his chair, crossing to John in one long stride. “No, you can’t be. Especially if you’re playing in it.”
So some time passed during which I made some preparations, some of them far-reaching. Some threads I had already tied up in the past were brought together and finally I was at the point where I decided that the time had finally come. Sherlock would meet "Moriarty".
"A shot from this distance ... by an experienced shooter ... who is no stranger to violence ... he only fired when I was in imminent danger ... moral principles ..."
"But, Sherlock, why the hell haven't you spoken to me in all these weeks? Bloody hell, that also contributed, crucially even, to my thinking you were a hallucination!"
We sat on the sofa, held each other arm in arm and simply enjoyed being so close to each other. Knowing what we mean to each other. That we are still best friends and colleagues, but also so much more.
"You're more than a friend to me John. I know you're not ... you've stressed often enough how straight you are ... but that doesn't change the fact that I love you. I didn't know I was capable of it, but I am, and even if nothing can ever come of it, I still want to please keep your friendship that has become so precious to me John. Please."
Sherlock's eyes snapped open and he looked around. Just a moment, the man had said, and somehow he seemed to expect that the real voice of the criminal would now actually speak to him from somewhere.
That played into my hands because I wanted that stick and was now planning to use it to lure Sherlock to a place I wanted.
"Mycroft, let's both not pretend I'm calling you out of friendship and that you don't know it. I still dislike you as much as I did last week, but I could use your help."
Something was going on. Watson, when spoken to, seemed strangely absent and highly focused at the same time. He seemed to be making real and genuine progress in the matter, however, and had gained insights that Moriarty did not like at all.
John called in sick the next day, both to his employer and to the Yard. He felt unable to do anything constructive. The encounter ... or whatever it had been ... last night had taken quite a lot out of him. He sat frozen in his chair for half the day.
He regularly had attacks of crying, especially when he did something that reminded him of Sherlock. He considered moving away from Baker Street precisely because of the many memories, but he couldn't manage it, the flat simply meant too much to him.
That was also the reason why I, Moriarty, let him handle me like that. It was fun to have him right where I wanted him.
"Oh, Mrs. Hudson, I would have liked to have had a domestic quarrel with him, because that would mean that he and I .... oh forget it."
"Friends. People who like them. People who don't like them so much. A girlfriend, a boyfriend maybe ..."
"It's okay," I said, "you don't have to explain the process so objectively... even though you make it sound sexy."
"Never mind, Mycroft. But answer me one question: did you at any time inform Molly Hooper of my second 'death' in Serbia?"
"Sherlock, you like cases to be as complicated and strange as possible, don't you? Well, you'll like this one then."
"Well, John, that you and I should have an... an open relationship. So you can get sex whenever you need it, and I can... and I can... feel my way into things at my own pace, very slowly. Also, it would be possible for us both to accept if I actually never get used to the idea of sex."
So John walked uncertainly over to the kitchen and took a cup from the cupboard and then, after a moment's hesitation, Sherlock's favourite cup. He took two tea bags from the drawer and, after the kettle had whistled on the cooker, poured them both.
And just when he had brought himself to tell "Sherlock" what was going on, he flinched violently because a loud knock sounded at the door of the flat.
Sherlock seemed relieved that I was laughing and began to grin. That was when it was over with me and I had to laugh out loud, so much that I almost couldn't breathe. Sherlock faltered for a moment in astonishment, then he joined in. And it took quite a while to catch our breath again.
