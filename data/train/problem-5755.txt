Steve consciously tries to increase both the speed and force of his thrusts, and the effect the change of pace has on the other man is palpable immediately. His scent spikes with a novel, vigorous intensity, telling of the fact that he's already treading the edge, and his eyes roll into the back of his head as he, maybe (not) unconsciously, bites down on Steve's digits still stuffed into his mouth.
He’s always believed this line of business would kill him before he’d retire. He even made his peace with it, somewhere down the road. That’s simply the price someone like him pays for redemption.
When they do, word gets around spreading like a bushfire. He's akin to the dirty secret whispered behind lockers in high school corridors and it gets increasingly difficult to ignore how everyone's trying with all their might not to notice when he slips past them in the hallways.
Positioning himself at the foot of the cot, he searched Anthony's eyes in silent question, the other nodding curtly and giving him permission to proceed.
His Highness' palace was great and the throne room lavish in equal measures. King Fury had not been the one to have it built; he had simply struck down the man who had sat on the throne before him. Alexander Pierce had been little more than a tyrant and the Kingdom including its people was gladdened to be rid of him.
“I will never have an heir, 'least not in the way dear old Howard intended, that is. Still, that does not mean I haven’t been looking tirelessly for one outside the Stark lineage. And, well…”
This winter is bound to be wonderful. If he doesn’t freeze to death, he’ll be guaranteed to have died of blue balls by the end of it.
The young Lord-to-be quickly realized that James was nowhere near convinced. He sighed and confessed, “My father might have found out, and you know how quickly his moods come and go. He would have made me listen to another one of his monologues. ‘We don’t work for the people, Anthony, the people work for
Anthony, for one, did not mind the days on the road quite as much as he usually would. Lord Rhodes was under no delusion as to why this was the case: his friend and Rogers had taken to one another like ducks to water.
Steve revels in the perverse pleasure that comes from watching Stark freeze in momentary shock at the promise. No, this isn't just a once-off encounter. Steve will see to it.
Steve mutters angrily underneath his breath as draws himself up tall to push through them. "Thank you, Donna," he tells her, smile grateful but strained, and then raises his voice to address the crowd.
Tony knows there's not one particular moment from which he’s done everything wrong there was to be done wrong. Habits and Just-This-Onces are accumulative, and these are the results of a long-term study. One he had no idea he was doing, but here he is anyway.
Arms wrap around him and settle at his hips, and Tony knows the shape of the man that presses up against his back maybe better than he knows his own (or knew, until just recently, and isn't everything so much more fun now that he does).
The last time he was referred to as such would have been in his late teens. Indeed, Tony Stark was jailbait once.
Steve lands on the cracked asphalt in the alley to its left–the one Stark has been showing up at every second Thursday for the last fourteen weeks at just this time. Seems his informant was telling the truth. It won’t help the fact that she’s dead now, but Steve appreciates the honesty nonetheless.
Tony locks his legs tighter around him and pulls himself up by his shoulders, lengthening his neck to bridge the last few inches and press an open-mouthed, breathy kiss to Steve's lips.
He’d happily spend a few restless nights if it was Tony’s sleeping form curled up right next to him. (Only that their time’s run out and they have no way of knowing if there’ll be any more nights to spend at all, after this is over.)
People like Steve are the root of their power. One of many individual cogs that can be used and replaced at will. Maintenance comes cheap with the business model they run. Desperate people will sell themselves short, and no one ever really makes it out once their debt is settled. Most remain indebted until death.
Maria comes into the room sliding over the floor on her socks. She only escapes an imminent collision with the coffee table by the skin of her teeth, breath a little labored as she comes to a standstill and looks at him questioningly.
This is a different kind of dullness than the one that accompanied his days in Red Rock, all thanks to the fact that he now doesn’t have the option of drinking the time away.
when they left them here with Tony's body. Nobody even stopped to think that their means to reverse this are right here at their disposal. Maybe--nobody dared to bring it up. Maybe they thought it best to not play with powers beyond their comprehension, and, well. Steve can get behind that. It is reasonable.
have a knack for the arts," he grins. "But, you know, I– don't think l'll be able to go with you next year."
much is solely responsible for it. He thinks he understands it better now, why, after the Decimation and everything that came with it, his
Stark makes a deliberate pause, dragging out the moment of silence. Steve rises both brows in clear displeasure and signals him to go on, impatient. This better be good.
at the demonstration, but doesn't look all too bothered by the news. Maybe he's even on the taller side here, considering his designation.
Tony cries out, then, in a bare-bone agony that is less figurative and more horrific for it. Even compared to all that lies in his past already, it might be the rawest expression of torment Steve’s ever witnessed, and with every tendon that gets severed there’s another layer of Tony peeled back, all of him stripped away until this is everything he is, a flesh-and-bone being suffering through something it has lost the words to describe.
Tony meets his next thrust with a hard shove and almost doubles over when Steve cock glides over his sweet spot all the way through. The sound that escapes him is half moan and half breathless laugh. This is filthy, and he’s into it so much he already knows there will be an epiphany or two waiting for him when they're done.
The last shreds of daylight vanish and the lake is a pitch-black pool of liquid below them when Tony’s sobs fade into silence, his breath hitching only occasionally once he's calmed down.
Still undecided, Steve puts his ear against the surface of the door, listening intently for a few beats. The house is quiet. He must’ve been asleep longer than he thought. When he’s convinced nobody’s up anymore, he straightens and, after a single moment’s hesitation, opens the door.
Rooting Stark out was a hassle. This final act of the play is not so much a climax as it is shooting fish in a barrell.
Tony regards his naked counterpart in the mirror with a disgruntled look as Steve mouths a sensitive spot at his throat, leaving wet patches where he's laved over the skin with his tongue.
The wet, gripping heat around him is a bliss that casts a pall over everything else, allows him to forget about both the place and time he's in for a spectacular moment. It’s quiet in his head, both outside and inside drowned out, finally
“These stay on,” Steve tells him, resolute. Stark is about to open his mouth – probably to argue that, well, he could blow them all up like this too, so what’s the difference anyway – but Steve doesn’t allow him to get a word in.
Rogers descends the stairs, rubbing the back of his neck with a somewhat contemplative frown gracing his features. It seems he has also discovered the latest problem they’re faced with: arrangements regarding sleeping spaces have to be made.
Steve thinks. Regret doesn't change anything, in the end. They've all had to learn that lesson the hard way.
Everything that keeps Tony away from his now hidden stash under the sofa is the thought that if he guzzles it all now, he won’t have any later, and there is no telling if he can even get his hands on more. They’ll meet one of Cannon’s men halfway down the mountain for supplies and feed for the animals every week, but Tony doubts any of them will be inclined to send more booze up there with him even if he asks nicely.
Remorse that shouldn’t be hers to feel. She’s done everything in her power. More than he ever expected from someone he shared nothing but trauma with–but then again, that’s what emotion will do to feeling beings. It interweaves them, the scars connecting in the negative. Minus into minus equals plus. Simple math. Tony’s known it since before he can remember.
Funnily, Lord Stark did not even want for his aunt’s famed ale – although the woman knight in his company did drink to cover both his and her own share – and instead asked for a blueberry pie, which was another specialty of the house in its own right.
“Here’s how this is going to go,” Ross says and takes a few purposeful steps in his direction. It’s supposed to rile him up; the bitter tang of Tony’s shame still hangs in the air and this asshole's having a field day over his slip-up.
Peter had. Although he had never pried, it had been quite hard to avoid. He had long decided that it did not change anything; Anthony Stark had seen his potential in disregard of everything that may have another of his status turn his back before he'd even taken a proper look at his true capabilities and qualities.
Steve pulls out with a wet squelch and hot, pulsing throb in his entrance that Tony can’t even conjure up the presence of mind to feel humiliated about. In its stead, he feels deeply sated and perfectly content–some overworked muscle groups definitely won’t be thanking him come tomorrow, but that’s nothing he can’t live with.
James was positive this was the first time Anthony had been caught quite so unawares by someone else’s words. It was amusing to witness.
"It seems our Man of Iron is ready and eager to continue," Thor commented through a low chuckle from where he sat cross-legged at Tony's right with enough distance to observe the other man's reactions. Apart from him and Steve, the demi-god was the only one in the room fully unclothed, fist around his impressive length and entirely unbothered as he stroked himself and enjoyed the show.
much better, because it causes Tony to moan and close his eyes at the feeling. Strangely, the way his eyelids flutter shut is what does it for Steve; for a moment, Tony is still, the fragility of his life captured in a timeless memory.
Tony leaves after he's finished cleaning up the kitchen, up the stairs and, probably, to sleep. Steve has an usually quiet breakfast all by himself and then takes his shower. The house is quiet again.
Steve looks at the shadows and deepening lines in Tony’s face and knows there’s no real choice to be made here. This situation might not be fair to either of them, but no sensible person would try to force themselves on someone who’s not even had proper time to grieve yet.
Tony’s face falls. He’s glaring at Steve, but he can see his own expression in the mirror regardless. The undiluted horror communicated by his widened eyes and gaping mouth would be comical to look at were the situation not so very dire.
When he gathers the strength to turn around, the kitchen is empty. Steve is gone like he said, has disappeared as quietly as he came.
They had a chance. Tony likes to think they could’ve made it, even if he can’t really tell wishful thinking and sound reasoning apart anymore. He wants to believe that it’s only the unfavorable circumstances and bad timing that made them crash and burn in the end–not that they were incompatible. No, they matched. They were synchronized, scarily so. Souls attuned to the same frequency, Tony didn't think, because he's never considered himself a true equal to Steve Rogers.
Tony doesn't break the silence again this time around, and since neither of them makes a move to bring some distance between their bodies, Steve becomes acutely aware of the lack of space. It's as if something in his brain refuses to give the command to make his legs move, because he seems to be stuck there, unable to get out of Tony's immediate vicinity or even look away from his dark eyes and blown pupils.
Steve realizes that's precisely what he might be, at least to this very much alive version of Tony Stark. He doesn't get the chance to finish the thought, because Tony has recovered from the initial shock and produces a gauntlet out of nowhere, his palm alight and pointing in Steve's direction.
A muted groan slipped past his lips and it took a worrying amount of self-restraint not to snap his hips forward as he came, coating Tony's insides. Steve'd been holding off for what felt like ages and was surprised by his own self-restraint; he expected to shoot his first load a lot sooner. The feeling of his release spilling inside Tony had the other man's eyes roll back and caused him to try and push himself further down on the cock in his ass, forcing Steve to tighten his grip and prevent himself from slipping in any deeper.
Believe him, don't believe him, it's all the same to Tony, but he actually does still have a moral compass. He knows this is all but right, invading another person’s privacy the way he's doing right now. And yet – even knowing better, Tony does it, like he has done so many things that came before it.
Steve slows; hIs movements are oddly calculated as he turns off the stove and adds the last pancake to his own stack. “Tony, what do you–” He cuts himself off and shoots Tony a stern look. “Did you pass out in the workshop and hurt yourself again?”
Steve draws in a shaking breath. If the deaths of two of the most valued people in his life could be considered a ‘hitch’, well. “Nat– Natasha didn’t come back from Vormir. You know how the Soul Stone–? You do. Clint– they fought, and she…won. Not in the long run. But she made the sacrifice.”
He gets a smirk in return. "Considering you jumped Fury on the grounds that his suspicion I might've gone coo-coo and stole you from another timeline upset you?"
From a purely unbiased perspective, Bruce shared Captain Rogers' opinion; often times Lord Stark would behave foolishy at best and recklessly at worst, and this appeared to be one of his most foolhardy endeavors yet.
Though the feast was being held in the great hall, the number of attendants in relation to the seats available was rather small. In the end, it came down to two dozen men and women; the host took his time to greet every one of them as they entered the hall with its tall ceiling and chandeliers glimmering in the candle light.
He had been aware Anthony liked him well enough – they had spent a considerable amount of time in one another's presence in these past months and found that they not only shared a passion for the new and uncharted, but shared also opinions on every aspect that mattered.
Steve's hand released the bruising grip on his hip to cover Tony's smaller one that was flattened to the table. He still wore the wedding ring on his fourth finger, titanium gleaming in the harsh light like a promise doomed to be broken. Tony had taken his own off days ago, a spur of the moment decision during a particularly vocal screaming match of theirs. A decision he came to regret but didn’t know how to undo.
It's been a slow-going process, and yet he's here, suddenly stripped of all his defenses and bare in a way that has nothing to do with his state of undress.
With a start, Tony realizes there's tears pricking in his eyes. His face is pulling a grimace, something pathetic and ugly that doesn't help his situation, and he's still standing there, bits of shaving cream framing his pinched expression, naked and frighteningly fragile–
Tony stares and stares, wordless, quick wit and brilliance gone. And then, with a last flicker of light in his eyes and his chest, his life is gone too.
One evening, they’re cuddled up on the couch together, watching–to Tony’s immense suffering–a rerun of
The main question they are left to deal with is how to proceed once they’re met with resistance from the opposing side: How many guards are there really? Have their ammunition reserves actually been depleted years ago or is there something left? Which amount of casualties can they bear? What if they take over the water supply and Stone still doesn’t want to negotiate?
And by these standards, Tony "Squishy, Sad and Saggy" Stark isn't cut out for the superhero gig. Not even by a long shot. Maybe Natasha should've put that in her evaluation of him instead. Tony scoffs. Well, back then, he'd have probably still passed the bar, so it's no use.
dick. Tony isn't a religious man, but sometimes he wants to send a prayer up there and thank whichever higher deity has gifted him with this flawless co-creation of nature and science.
It’s easy to tell when he gets close. He clenches and unclenches around him and Steve fucks him through it, amplifying the intensity of the sensation for both of them. There’s a tremble in his voice when he says Steve’s name, moaning the syllable through gritted teeth. And then again (and again). Combined with his erratic movements, it’s a warning – one that Steve wholeheartedly ignores, tightening his grip around Tony’s cock just enough so it’ll be bordering on too much.
For a few minutes, the world seems to come to a standstill in silent grief over the loss of its best defender. The noise of battle and bloodcurdling screams fade into somber tranquillity as the reality of Tony's sacrifice takes hold.
He trails off, breath hitching. Gratified, Tony watches the cocky expression give way to a stunned one. Steve's eyes widen a fraction and his tongue darts out to wet his lips in a subconscious reaction to his fingers coming in touch with the butt plug.
So instead, he continues to sit there as Tony cries beside him, the space between them made insurmountable by what feels like a year's but is only a month's worth of confusing, contradicting emotions.
He sits up, puts his book away and takes the offered pages from her hands. After he's skimmed through them, the thing he's feared from the get-go proves true: this goes over his head. Sure, he gets the baser concepts, but he doesn't know where he'd start to test these calculations for their mathematical accuracy.
And, well, he’ll admit he’s been playing with the thought; going back, leaving everything behind to live the simple life like Tony once told him to. It would’ve been easy. He was still on the fence about the issue when the Tesseract took the decision out of his hands. Steve doesn’t want to get hung up on the fateful nature of it all, but he can’t quite believe all of this to be sheer dumb (bad) luck.
“I think everything you said happened did happen," Steve says, voice firm and breath wisping over Tony's cheek. “Maybe something got in their way, or they know it won’t work. Could be there's more to come.”
For a moment, Steve dares to lean into the kiss, give it his everything as if he were somewhere else, sometime else, with another Tony altogether in front of him and the knowledge in mind that it'll be their last kiss in this lifetime.
In light of all this, the man's apparent inability to keep his Lord safe during such outings that barely passed as adventurous seemed rather strange.
Steve tries not to listen to the voice in his head that tells him Tony stripped the armor of possible life-saving functions because he never expected to make it out alive in the first place.
His stomach rumbles in protest as he makes his way down the painfully noisy stairs, reminding him just how long ago his last meal has been. His metabolism calls for a lot more than just three meals a day, and he hasn’t even gotten those in the last twenty-four hours. Steve tries to ignore the pangs in his empty stomach. He can hardly plunder Tony’s fridge, and it’s not like he hasn’t had to go without eating for much longer periods of time in the past.
The memories, on the other hand, are there among supplies and equipment in each of their backpacks, and they'll carry them every step of the way whether they'd like to or not.
Steve nips at the sensitive skin on the inside of his thigh, one of the spots that will unfailingly draw sounds from him every time. Tony gasps a little and spreads his legs wider on instinct, or in the hope that Steve will finally stop playing with him and go where his mouth is
"Oh, uh, we built a miniature speedboat together? Two, actually. And now she's very determined to take it for a spin every day because last time she raced her friend she lost," he answers, the memory causing a faint chuckle to escape him. Tony gathers a cup from one of the cupboards and proceeds to fill it to the brim, not noticing as Steve smiles quietly into his fifth omelet.
The book feels thicker in his hands than it looks, its many pages welling and making it appear broader. Flipping it open, Tony spotts the first couple of drawings. Human shapes, faces and portraits, most of them unfinished sketches. They could be anyone. On the sixth page is a single finished drawing of a woman, the big curls of her dark hair framing prominent facial features.
Tony can't say he minds the relative calm or the excuse to skip all those SI meetings and press conferences. He spends most days around the compound, in the workshop and in bed, which is all about him feeling dead on his feet a lot of the time and has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that he can still smell the faintest trace of Steve’s scent in the pillowcase.
The interior of the house doesn't differ much from the one he already knows, which makes this whole encounter even stranger. Tony, alive and breathing and alone with his daughter in an otherwise empty home. Christ, did something happen to
Stark is slippery. And he has all the quirks of a man constantly made to look over his own shoulder: he’s meticulous in the way he keeps to himself, pedantic in his sharing of information and his travels to and from places in the city. Even the way he moves is ever-calculated, every step one taken after an instance of consideration. If he were to guess, he'd say paranoia is the man's middle name.
As the noise died down, Stark began to speak, words carefully selected in a way that made clear he had practiced until he knew them by heart.
James only barely refrained from reminding him that the King was not a magical fae who would fulfill his wishes if he just asked nicely enough. Barely, but he did. His friend had stood on the brink of death just recently, and the knight felt it was right and just to allow some leniency.
He leans in for a kiss, winding his arms around Steve's neck as he does. It's slow and intimate but ultimately innocent, and he backs off a bit to see Steve look back at him with a fond little crook to his lips that makes his eyes crinkle.
Steve buries into Tony’s chest, his grip crushing. Tony lets it happen, disregards his own bewilderment to comfort Steve with slow, steady strokes up and down his trembling back.
He pulls his hand away. Steve's brows draw together in confusion and then in disappointment, but Tony doesn't leave him any more time to second-guess. Steve watches, motionless and blue eyes still watery, audibly drawing in air as Tony wraps his arms around his neck until they're pressed flush against one another. Disbelieving, the other man wordlessly observes Tony as he leans closer on the tips of his toes.
But Tony’s fears aren’t directed toward his own fate, which in turn makes Steve worry for him all the more. They all have their roles to play in this, except Tony in particular has a history of attempted self-sacrifice for the greater good, which Steve is positive won’t just end because they have a battle plan worked out this time around.
When he sees the arrangement of the six stones buried in Tony's armor, Steve realizes what he has to do.
The cube, previously only lit in a soft glow, is now beginning to radiate a blueish light so intense Steve reflexively closes his eyes against the burn. He'd drop it if he could, but his fingers stay locked around its edges like iron would stick to a magnet.
So maybe, he likes this a little more than he ever thought possible. It's not like his enjoyment is highly clandestine, considering just a couple of minutes ago he came so hard he
The cabin is, surprisingly, larger than it looks from the outside. There’s a reasonably sized oven with two hotplates sat on top, a square table with three chairs that squeak when sat on, a raggedy sofa in front of the fireplace and a narrow set of stairs crammed toward the back that leads up to small, second storey. It’s like an attic up there; the ceiling is low and slanted, and the entire space is occupied by the double-bed pushed away from the stairs and up to the tiny window overlooking the landscape outside.
When the barricades they've put up are to their satisfaction, Steve's gaze involuntarily travels to Tony, taking in his picture more closely than during the perfunctory once-over he allows himself to take immediately whenever they've entered a safe space. Tony's caked in blood just like he is, but that isn't a particularly disturbing sight anymore and he seems fine aside from it.
"I have some idea," Tony sneers, waving the journal in front of him demonstratively. The laugh that escapes him is sharp, and he can tell it leaves an incision from the way Steve takes a faltering, almost involuntary step back. "Am I supposed to be flattered by this? Do you think this is–"
When they have rounded up all the stray animals in the area, the sun has long taken its spot high up in the clear-blue sky. Tony hoped it would warm up a little, but the mountain air remains crisp and dry, and his throat becomes sore and swallowing is painful.
"Dreamed again," Tony says, confirming what Steve's already suspected. It doesn't explain why in the world they're so close Steve can feel his breath on his skin, though. The exact opposite should be the case: Tony should be all the way across the bed, far away from Steve.
Tony, too, has learned long ago not to bare thoughts the likes of these to the world and especially not the men they are aimed at. He thinks it must've been at the age of twelve when his father overheard him speaking too fondly of a boy in his class; Howard Stark beat that particular notion out of him with his belt and words that stung more than any beating ever could.
Steve gets the card from his nighstand; it's covered by three books, an unwrapped protein bar and a box of tissues.
When he buries his face back in the palms of his hands, there's silence. At first, Tony tries to suppress the noises and the shake of his body as he erratically sucks in air, but he soon gives up on hiding, too drained to even uphold any sort of pretense. Steve goes back and forth between wanting to hold him (knowing his comfort is unwanted) and wanting to leave him some privacy (knowing he'd seem cold if he left).
Tony's bottom lip wobbles. He sees it in the mirror. Yikes. What is it with the mood swings today? This is a bit much even for him, and he doesn't have the excuse of being pregnant nor a toddler.
"I promised myself when I walked out of that bunker–" He shakes his head, eyes hardening. "I keep breaking you but I'm the only one who can keep you from destroying yourself. Strange paradox, isn't it?"
"Oh, God." Tony pushes his chair away from the table and turns away, hunching over to bury his face in his hands. His stomach flips upside down. There's not enough air in the room.
Steve places himself there in the middle of the room, stretching out his arms in invitation. He looks so full of hopeful anticipation that Tony feels almost bad saying, "You're weird today."
Tony’s movements grow a little more frantic, back and forth and back again as if he can’t decide whether to seek the sweet friction of Steve’s hand around him or the slow drag of Steve’s cock over his crack. When Steve’s hold tightens and he twists his hand just so, Tony’s mouth falls open in a silent whimper, his head rolling back onto Steve’s shoulder.
"I'm not him, Steve," he says, gently, almost. Maybe Steve's imagining it, but there's the tinge of regret in his voice. "If you're staying? If I'm going to have to remind myself of that every time I look at you? You might as well do the both of us a favor and try too. Just, please– don't make it any more complicated than it has to be."
Steve could've broken free if he really wanted to, but he's aware he already caused more trouble for himself than what's warranted, given his situation and the fact that he's very much reliant on SHIELD should Tony get fed up with his presence eventually.
The man's eyes narrow and his upper lip twitches with anger. There's no answer, but Steve is known for his impeccable patience. He allows Stark to throw his little fit and lets his hand roam over the man's body. If he won't come out with it, Steve's going to find out on his own terms.
Or, as it was, Anthony had come to see him in the old castle, now made new by many long months of work. He demanded to be shown around the territory and appeared rather eager, so James humored him in his request.
His eyebrows furrowed in concentration as he spread Tony's cheek further apart and observed come and slick drip past his two fingers slipped in alongside Steve's already massive length. The puffy, reddened pucker of Tony's hole fluttered uselessly for a moment in a desperate attempt to keep the fluids from leaking out. It was of no avail, however, because they spilled anyway, a trail of white foam traveling past Tony's perineum and even further down until it reached his sac.
The palms of his hands are damp with sweat. There's footsteps emerging from inside, and Steve reflexively holds his breath until the door opens.
That's all there is. He doesn’t cry and doesn’t beg. Steve expected nothing less from someone of his caliber, but they’re far from done. There are a lot of opportunities left to coax noises out of the man.
Then, the latter pauses, replaced by shuffling steps on wooden flooring that decrease in volume. It takes a moment, and the music stops as well; for a second, there's nothing. After the brief silence, the music comes back on and the steps return, now approaching.
His body sinks against Steve with a soft thump, exhausted to the point he's slipped into a state between sleep and consciousness where their unspoken rules have no meaning. Steve's only a warm body Tony is instinctively leaning toward because keeling over the other side would mean ending up in the water.
got something to say I think you'll wanna hear," he says, the humor in his smirk lost in his dry voice. "Guy talks all day once he gets going."
Stark took this with a surprising amount of dignity. The wide smirk stretching his lips was immediate and genuine, his dark, pointy beard accentuating the angular shape of his face as if he considered her reaction intriguing and amusing rather than off-putting.
Bruce, Scott, Natasha and Clint are either people who’ll fit right into the scenery of Chitauri-infested New York City (Bruce, Nat, Clint) or are unobtrusive enough not to stand out at all (Scott, Nat, Clint). As a logical conclusion, Thor is revising Asgard with Rocket to keep him in check while Rhodey (air support) and Nebula (knows the place) went to Morag.
Maybe, he needs it to mean something. Like his going into the ice and waking up seventy years later needed to mean something. Like Tony's death needed to mean something.
It starts snowing. Flakes light as feathers, at first, and then the wind picks up and the crystals become pinpricks in Tony’s face. The rock and vegetation disappear, swallowed by swirling gusts of white, and with that his last points of orientation are gone.
being the keyword. Getting eaten alive isn’t how Steve wants to go if he has any say in it, but it isn’t himself he’s ultimately worried about–he has had zombies taking considerable chunks out of him before. Point being, despite the horrendousness and the agony of it, he has survived.
He doesn’t know it, can’t remember ever having smelled something like it and yet it’s… doing things to his hindbrain. Something in him shifts, coiling tight and urgent in his gut as he, almost subconsciously, opens his mouth a fraction to inhale more of the smell and pander that sudden need for it within him.
Steve rises to his feet and pauses, looking out over the city from the vantage point that is the rooftop they've found themselves on. He can make out sirens in one direction, gunshots and screams in the other. This city crawls with scum of the worst kind–be it Stark on one or Steve on the other side–smells of waste, piss and toxic fumes, and will either eat you alive or spit you back out worse than you were.
"Tell him what you told me," Bucky orders, arms crossed over his chest – and it is an order, no doubt about that. He’s cutting right to the chase, leaving no room for arguments in a way that reminds Steve just why he's not only his best friend but also most trusted enforcer at that.
The sudden, unbearable need is frightening. He isn't a stranger to this, touching himself with thoughts he shouldn't be having in the midst of the night, but he feels even more depraved for it – out here where there's nothing to shield him, nowhere to hide.
"Out. It will only be five days, you are going to be fine if you listen to Ms. Potts. She knows the ways of the castle better than I do, most days."
scarce, but Steve still has a certain authority, and even those that initially look like they'd love to take him in a fight slink away in the end. Nobody's questioned his position and then followed through with it so far – ultimately, his capabilities are accepted and respected for what they are.
"Why would they stop at one if they can have five? Ten? An army?" Steve #3 at his right smiles a shark's smile, and Tony is positive he hasn't spoken a word (because he won’t give them this too) but he's as much of an open book to them as he's ever been.
In a while, the mess between his legs will become too uncomfortable to ignore, and they’ll have to move. Steve will push the bed back to its initial place, they’ll change the covers, and the mirror will still be there, and Tony’s still going to pass it every once in a while and inevitably think about the various imperfections that will have caught his eye at a moment's notice.
Some of his inner devastation has obviously translated onto his face, because Steve crosses his arms over his chest and chuckles, a little sympathetic but mostly amused.
reverberating in the alarmingly empty space of his mind, presently focused on nothing but survival. Before, there was cold creeping into his every bone, but he doesn’t feel it anymore, as if his body has accepted it as his natural state of being. Tony knows that doesn't bode well for him; his core temperature might already be falling. Maybe his heartbeat has slowed, he isn’t sure.
Desire pools in his abdomen, red-hot and sticky sweet at the same time. He knew they wouldn’t be able to keep this up until the end, but Tony’s making self-restraint a lot more of a difficult task than it should be for Steve.
To most, there’s no answer to. Pondering them doesn’t serve any purpose but to spark doubt, and so Steve doesn’t. This revolution was always going to be concomitant with great risk and even greater loss. If they make it, it’ll be with more luck than brains, an act of pure serendipity.
Von Doom's expression was one of carefully crafted indifference, but there was a spark of interest glinting in his eyes that Natasha did not fail to notice.
Throughout it all, it’s always been him and Tony. Him and Tony throughout the heartbreak, the horror, the tragedy. Him and Tony and something warm between them that thrived and prospered in spite of it all. The both of them, together, proving that there could still be things in this world that are good and right.
Before Tony gets to argue his case, Rogers turns on his heel and stomps out into the night, the safety latch on the rifle clicking as it's released. The herd isn't far off; their bodies, pressed together, are a single dark splotch visible from camp. Still, the light doesn't reach out there. Rogers might know his way around a gun alright, but even he won't be able to hit any targets when he can't see them.
The drive to the facility at the outskirts of New York is long and tense. When they arrive, he's first sent to medical – that figures. Steve sighs and bows to his fate. Isn't his first rodeo, in any case.
His breath flows across Tony’s skin in gentle puffs as he whispers, almost inaudible, “Missed you so much, y’don’t even know.”
An overly optimistic part of him wants to take the card and rip it apart, but the more realistic one knows he can't take that chance. This is the only thing he has in this world if Tony ever wants him gone. Steve pockets the slip of paper and later puts it face down in the bottom drawer of his nightstand for safekeeping.
is here and the realization that he’s never had the power to stop it from coming, no matter how many hits (bites) he took in Tony’s stead, no matter how much he strategized and pushed and fought for the right to patrol the perimeter while Tony remained sheltered in their hideout.
As though his reflection could tell lies, he looks down to check whether the marks are there on his physical body as well–and feels all air escape his lungs when they match the image in the mirror.
Anthony’s voice carried both a playful and taunting undercurrent; the message in it could be interpreted in whichever way the listener chose to. This was how he would typically test the waters.
On the seventh, a knight of the King’s Guard requested to speak to him, a carrier pigeon with a gray coat perched on his shoulder. James led him into the tent and listened in from his spot next to Anthony’s cot as the man relaid his message.
Tony doesn’t finish the sentence, only hangs his head and huffs a long, rumbling breath. Before Steve gets to ask, he takes Steve’s hand and guides it down to his dick that’s straining helplessly against the sheets. Steve gets the message and starts pumping it in time with his thrusts, picking up speed as he finds himself dangerously close to tipping over the edge.
"You stay here," he says when he lays eyes on Tony appearing between the trees, in a tone that doesn't leave room for argument. Like Tony's a dog to be told when to go heel and when to sit.
Steve, having found yet another rule he determined fit to be broken, couldn’t keep up the pretense they had silently come into agreement about. In those moments before the final wave of pleasure swept them up in short-lived oblivion, the emotions they’d so expertly shoved aside returned with a vengeance.
They've made that observation many times before, bumping into strangers and other groups of survivors that turned from friend to foe at the drop of a hat. It's why it has been only the two of them, Tony and Steve against the living and the dead, for years on end now.
Her eyes are red, but she's stopped crying sometime ago. Instead, there's the hint of a smile on her face, even if it's crooked and wistful.
Not like this, though. Tony–despite all his learnt humility–did, in a way, expect to go out with a bang. He expected to die by Thanos’ hand, then and there. And that, he was ready for; he would’ve gone down fighting, at least.
Tony's glad about that particular development though -- he prefers dealing with Steve's momentary tunnel vision over any further unprompted acts of violence. He only barely managed to keep the man from acting on the initial knee-jerk reflex telling him to pounce on the ominous, floating figure as it stepped out of the shadows and revealed itself as the Red Skull.
Tony's throat constricts. He looks away–tries to, anyway, because Steve's hand that's been resting on his chest comes up to wrap around his jaw and turn him back to face the mirror.
He holds back, collects himself even as Tony throws his head back and scatters wet, desperate kisses under his chin and everywhere else he can reach.
As he arrived next to Hammer’s spot on the table, he drew himself up tall and looked down at the perplexed man. Around them, the Lord’s men tensed, hands searching the handles of their swords, not yet threatening but preparing for all possible outcomes.
He isn’t stupid, he brought a supply – Rogers shot him a glare that was in equal measures disappointed and disbelieving when he found that the space in Butterfingers’ saddlebags was almost entirely taken up by booze – but that doesn’t mean he can go and drink himself into a stupor for just the one magnificent, albeit blurry, night.
Steve adjusts his grip on the supersonic rifle. He'd be labeling it as excitement, but he knows it's adrenaline that's ramping up his pulse. This is the moment he’s waited for since he’s been handed his most recent assignment, and it is somewhat of a special occasion.
Tony, although wishing he could make himself avert his eyes, observes his debauched counterpart in the mirror with a bit of perverse fascination.
When he's finally finished and satisfied with the results in front of him, he puts the razor down with the towel (Steve's going to bite his head off later), moving to retreat into the bathroom – and catches a glance of himself in the mirror.
Steve's heard, though. Clear as day. And he's trying not to think about all the possible reasons why Tony would do such a thing when he seemed so adamant about wanting him out of the house as soon as possible.
has gotten into him when just yesterday, Steve asked "You ready?" and shot him a reproving look when Tony nodded eagerly, knowing he wasn't, and continued to stretch him without another word.
Steve likes to take his time and drag the main event out as much as he himself can bear it, but this time, his movements are hasty and a little jerky, as though he can’t stand to waste even one second. Tony hears him spit into his palm and then shove his hand back down again. His cock twitches in anticipation.
Thrown off by Rogers’ unfazed response, the Lord stuttered. “You– you have no right to– I am not under your orders! Nothing but a lucky peasant is what you are, and you
The floor disappears, and Tony goes with it, falls and falls. For a blissful moment, he floats somewhere far away where none of this has meaning and the whole world hasn't collapsed in on itself with none of the beauty and all the destructive force of a neutron star.
When they've, thankfully, made it out of the building without any major incidents (if one were to classify Tony physically
After a minute or so, a suspicious sizzling sound begins to drift over from the kitchen and Steve releases him to check on his (potentially burnt) dinner. Tony settles at the table, throwing his suit jacket and tie over an extra chair. By the time he pours both of them some wine, Steve is already serving dinner: something savory and smelling of curry, the recipe of which he most likely stole from Bruce sometime before big green's sudden disappearance.
Maybe Steve should schedule an appointment with Erica again; yeah, he should bring that up. Visiting a therapist on the regular can be help- and insightful even when you're currently feeling level. And then maybe Steve can discuss what underlying self-worth issues are making him sell himself short to the point of getting stuck with someone in Tony's ballpit of desirability. Because honestly, there's nothing much left of that
Steve's worry and unsolicited sympathy is all too evident when he looks at Tony and the mess he is: bags under his eyes, three days of grease and sweat stains on his shirt and possibly a manic glint in his gaze.
Steve's hands move over his stomach, and Tony's ears are burning because the other man's warm breath is grazing his skin and
"I can't do this to them, Steve," he says. It's supposed to be a simple statement, a matter of fact, but the words that leave his mouth sound like a plea. "It's not fair. Not like this."
His eyes close almost by themselves once he feels Tony's breath on his lips, every other part of him motionless. The shorter man lowers his hands onto Steve's chest to push himself up on his toes and finally press his lips down.
No single man wanted to be handed a poorly balanced sword and turned into laughing stock in front of the whole guard during a sword fight amongst the best of them.
In the corner of his eye, he spots a rider dismounting his horse outside the inn on the other side of the road. There's nothing special about the sight; travellers often arrive in the dead of night, but this man doesn't seem equipped for a longer journey. His only possessions appear to be the clothes he wears and whatever else might be stored on his mount. Tony watches him feed the strawberry roan a handful of oats and throw the saddlebags over his shoulder before he heads inside.
The man's tales were colorfully illustrated and never the same – once, the cinch had not been pulled tight enough and the saddle slipped out under him; on a different occasion, his horse had been spooked by a snake in the bushes, and during another time, the rocky terrain caused his mare to stumble and he fell, unprepared.
He pauses, regarding Tony with that one scowl he inevitably defaults to whenever they come face to face. Tony drops his arms to his sides, only now noticing he's been hugging himself, and sighs in exasperation. “Are we done?”
It's not like this is his first choice – he has brought the matter up with Rogers another three times, but received only curt comments along the lines of "it's not up for discussion" or was simply ignored and brushed off like an irritating horsefly.
Steve shakes his head to clear his thoughts, if only enough to focus on the task at hand. He exchanges a look with Rhodey, seeking permission to do what he’s planning to. The man’s jaw clenches at Steve’s silent question and he swallows roughly to keep the tears from welling up once more, but he approves with a tight nod. Steve turns back to Tony to reach up and gently close his eyes, their lively glow dead and gone.
Lord Stark bared a tight smile. "I am not my father," he returned sharply. "And I would like to offer you a place in the Iron Guard, as long as you promise to refrain from rendering them all useless to prove any future points you may see fit to prove, Miss…"
Tony narrows his eyes at himself and stares harder, like that might change what he's seeing entirely.
It's very different when he's there and has only his own thoughts to keep him company. The serenity becomes too loud, the loneliness crushing. He isn't used to being alone anymore – before, he's had the compound, and before that, there was the tower – and doesn't like it. It's a reminder of the time after they'd found him in the ice and he'd gotten the apartment in Brooklyn, thinking it'd do him well to be back there. Except, well, it wasn't anything like he imagined; he could spot enough things reminding of his time, but that wasn't it.
"Your daughter is something else, huh?" he hears himself say. When he sees Tony looking back at him with a guarded expression, Steve smiles carefully and adds, "I really do appreciate this."
He wouldn't, of course. Didn't matter whether parts of his brain were screaming with need, because there was a much greater part that would never allow Tony to be hurt that way (or any other way except those that Tony asked for, for that matter), not even for the fraction of a second.
Maria looks away. "When you're sad. About papa. You get really weird, and you think I don't know," she says, and the way her voice fades into a whisper at the end hurts something in his core.
As wasteful as Steve thinks it is–even with the natural spring they’ve discovered in the woods not far from the abandoned cul-de-sac they set up camp in–he has to admit he could do with washing away some of the grime. The gore does get bearable the longer you’re exposed to it, but it sure doesn’t get any prettier.
Steve lets him lead the way. They're escorted by a single agent who looks like he wishes he didn't have to be here; in fact, all the ones they encounter in the winding corridors give them a wide berth. First, Steve assumes it's thanks to him, but then he catches one big guy eyeing Tony warily as he walks by, and from then on reality becomes hard to miss.
Bruce raised an eyebrow but chose not to object, instead dragging a wheeled tray up to the cot before he returned to his workstation.
He rips the arc reactor off his chest and presses it into Steve's palm in a gesture that tells so much more than words ever will and causes Steve’s heart to shrivel and morph into something ugly inside his ribcage.
She had been given away at the age of five to be trained in the arts of swords, fists and shadows, as was customary in her culture. Life was cruel and the people who raised her unkind, and at the age of thirteen, she stole herself away to sneak upon a tradesman's ship that set sail for the largest haven of Mar'vill.
Steve moves his left eyebrow up in an unambiguous manner and says, “I’m sure they do when Captain America asks
They rode out early in the morning, only stopping for a brief rest, and had been trotting along a tranquil creek in comfortable silence for a while before Lord Rhodes found it in him to speak up again.
Hammer breezed right past this subtle reaction, his attention shifting inward as he circled the rim of his empty cup in thought.
would happen to Stark as he had him thrown to their feet to be taken apart and ravaged until not a scrap of his soul was left.
That and a lot more is stored here; whatever the hell the thing is Stark speaks of, he’s got no idea.
Doesn’t mean they shouldn’t try. Doesn’t mean they can’t not try. They have to, for the sake of the people and everything still right and just in the world. Even if that everything isn’t much, and the world has considerably shrunken in size.
Tony isn't in the mood to get beaten to a pulp when everything he's been looking forward to tonight was getting shitfaced and later stumble across the street to the small inn that accommodates his room. A man has to uphold his reputation as the town drunk, after all, and slacking off means people talk. Luckily, the guy loses interest in him immediately after Tony has crashed into a table and rolled onto the floor, so he uses everyone's momentary disinterest in his existence to escape the saloon.
And after that, the man suddenly pauses in thought and goes, “So, ah. Steve, is it? I think we haven’t been properly introduced.”
Steve would take time to marvel at the technology, were it not for Stark navigating them out of the alley and further down the avenue, where corporate headquarters make way for housing blocks. This is why they’re so adamant that he brings him in alive, then. Stark’s tech has been a threat to them. Naturally, making it theirs and becoming the threat would be the logical next step.
“It’s okay,” he croaks out, and Steve startles, breath stuttering off into nothingness as if he believed Tony had forgotten how to produce words the same way his legs had forgotten how to carry his weight.
Sir Steven was sitting on Bruce's stool on Anthony's side, his left hand still clasped tightly around the other man's while the right one was placed in his hair, stroking. Faintly, the physician was able to make out Lord Stark's slurred words, "You mad a'me?"
There's a certain wariness about the men when they first see him – their chatter ceases and one of them leans into the others' space to mutter something as they approach.
The Cilento Coast is a colorful dichotomy of rocky cliffs and endless cliffside beaches, with all the same charme of Amalfi but plagued by only a fraction of the tourists flocking to the more popular regions of Salerno.
It's painful and it hurts and it's–arousing in a way it's never been between the two of them. Steve has never been like this because he just
Yet, it was difficult to imagine that the man thought him capable to take his place one day. The prospect seemed otherworldly, almost.
It was during their journey that Anthony and the swordsman first made each other’s acquaintance. James was tending to the horses at the end of a long day of uninterrupted travel when he witnessed the incident.
“C’mon. Could’ve been worse,” Steve answers. (There is no such thing as a jinx, but later, he’ll think it anyway, that this passing remark is somehow the catalyst of a misfortune that has found them some long minutes prior.)
Steve doesn’t make any off-hand comments, doesn’t even shoot him a telling smirk or any of these other things Tony thought he would be on the receiving end of. Yet again, he defies expectations, and Tony–likes this pattern of not being able to predict what comes next.
Outside, people are already up and about when he wakes to find Stark rubbing off on his morning wood. Right. Last night was not, in fact, a very vivid sexual fantasy. Might’ve fooled him.
His words fade into quiet apprehension as muffled sounds and talking from upstairs cause both him and his small but fierce interrogator to direct their attention toward the source of noise. Moments later, the groaning stairs announce Tony’s imminent arrival, his quick, shuffling steps atop the wood unmistakable in their nature.
Still, after a few years of living, fighting and approaching one another in more ways than one, they had made it to a point where they at times were alike to the Asgardian soldiers in Thor's raunchy stories.
The light streaming in through the window takes on a golden hue in time and announces the day’s impending end by bathing the room in its warm colors. There’s no clock around and Steve hasn’t got a watch on him, so it’s hard to gauge how much time has really passed. He’s used to his circadian clock being dead on time just about always, but this unprompted weekend getaway through dimensions left his head spinning in more ways than one.
Because what Tony sees is– “I think you like how I fit, ah, into you, and how we look with each other because it looks like we belong. I remember you saying you love seeing the lines when I,
Despite the pain in her eyes, her words aren't full of pleas and regrets. Steve realizes the things he meant to say are
After another moment's silence, Tony clicks his tongue and brings the flat of his hand down on his thigh, signalling that they've lingered long enough. When he gets up, moving to go back upstairs and finally get some well-deserved rest, Steve follows suit without complaint.
Blindly, Steve presses his lips against his jaw in the ghost of a kiss, and one to his cheek and another behind his ear. If he were more attentive, he might notice the body next to him shift and then stiffen minimally, but the moment is slow and comfortable and it’s possible he just refuses to acknowledge the change.
And what breaks Steve's heart is what remains unsaid: if there was another option, Steve would not be the one he would choose. It hurts but he figures it’s fair. This pain is a price he'll gladly pay in exchange for the privilege to leave this town with Tony by his side. As long as they're together, in any capacity, Steve will make do.
She had joined to dine with the Lords and Ladies in the great hall of the Iron Castle upon request of Lord Rhodes.
They sit him down in a corner next to the makeshift medical station, tying him to the post on his left with a spare piece of rope. It's a little too thick for their purposes but it'll do; Nat knows her handiwork disturbingly well.
It would be even nicer if the pitch of it wasn’t so full of apprehension that gradually bleeds into suppressed panic as it becomes louder, almost… closer.
, laugh because that means you gotta have done something right. You love–my eyes because, it’s–I’m so, I know I’m transparent, that’s why I wear sunglasses indoors for fuck’s sake–”
She doesn't beat around the bush, only slips him a blank card with a number on it and says, "If you ever change your mind, we'll send someone. Director Fury would still like to see you with us, Captain Rogers."
And he’s right: in the kitchen is Steve, performing an artful dough-flip. He must’ve heard him approach, but seems to be too preoccupied to lift his head until Tony slips into his field of view. His subdued smile grows tenfold when he lays eyes on Tony. It’s an easy smile to return. Tony settles at the kitchen island, making grabby hands at the steaming jug already sitting by the coffee maker.
He frowns, freezing where he’s standing and reflexively bringing his hands up in defense. Sure, he can do well enough without it, but
go a little over her head still, Stark genes or no. Steve doesn't know how anyone could have a conversation like this in a way that'd make a kindergartener understand.
Indeed, when Tony rolls over and blinks at Steve, he rolls a condom off his soft cock. Hm. Tony made a mess anyway, so that hasn't helped much. With a content sigh, he lets Steve drag a blanket over them, the sweat cooling now. He rolls into the other man's chest with a happy hum.
Tony smiles in response, the smallest strain around the curve of his lips, and pushes past Steve to remain standing in the door frame for a moment before reaching for the handle.
Steve lets himself fall back into the leather cushions of the chair and clasps his hands on the table in front of him. For a few seconds, he breathes, lets the anger roll off his shoulders.
One evening, Tony's working and Steve's sketching on the couch close by. He’s done it dozens of times before, but it’s become a rare sight now. For once, they're not arguing, and Tony can’t keep it all to himself anymore.
"I feel like I'm talking to a wall," he croaks through a cough. "Steve. You came onto me, right here. Then you came
In a slow, calculated motion, Anthony passed the weapon to the knight, who had already stretched out his arms and turned his palms up in anticipation.
, and even the harsh words that accompanied the rejection came as anything but a surprise. They were both strung taut, restless energy thrumming under skin, anger and fear and helplessness making for an explosive cocktail.
Peter stared at the now empty space in front of him before he gathered his bearings and made his way down the left hallway that would eventually take him to the desired location.
For a moment just before he leaves, Steve hesitates. Tony stirs a bit and buries his nose deeper into the wall of fabrics surrounding him, seemingly instinctively. A majority of it isn't his wardrobe either, which becomes apparent when looking at all the plaid shirts and khakis included in the arrangement. Maybe Tony can tell they still smell like him, even after all these months that have passed.
When he arrives at their suite however, Steve's in the kitchen with an assortment of pans and pots scattered around the stove and something baking in the oven. Tony's eyes dart to the dinner table, which is already set. There's folded napkins, cloth ones, and a '78 Château, which gives him the impression that something’s to be celebrated.
Steve slides his fingers between Tony's, pressing their palms into his chest to wordlessly emphasize the statement. It’s a nice sentiment, so universal there’s no need for it to be spoken out loud.
Maria is the first to come bolting into the room, barely even taking note of him as she makes a beeline for the refrigerator. She now seems to have accepted his presence without so much as a moment's hesitation, which is a huge step forward from the distrust he's been faced yesterday. Steve files that away as a positive development for the moment.
“I recall you not caring in the slightest about that fact just a few hours ago,” Steve reminds him, not quite able to bite back the comment.
So, he's never actively, truly sought to escape the hold Steve had on him. Not even when he was in the thick of it, with searing rage and piercing betrayal feeding a bottomless pit in the depths of his stomach. Maybe that should be a worrying bout of self-reflection, but Tony really doesn't have the energy to worry about the deeper intricacies of their falling out or his own lack of self-preservation instincts. There's greater things on the line now. (He tries not to think about the possibility that their fight might very well have been the catalyst of their collective failure.)
When Steve doesn’t respond, Tony shakes his head and turns to move away, opening his mouth to maybe backpaddle or apologize or make a self-deprecating joke to strip the moment of its gravity.
It's Tony. Tony, whose mouth falls open and whose eyes widen comically when he catches his gaze. When their eyes lock, he stumbles backward, pushed by an invisible force. As if he's seen a ghost. Or a dead man walking.
Maybe the disgruntlement that's welling up inside him shows in his expression, because Steve breaks their eye-contact a moment later as he lowers his head to press a few pecks along his hairline.
Steve seems to melt at that, slows a little and averts his eyes, his throat working as he swallows. Tony gears up to ask if something happened while he was away, but then Steve squeezes his hand for a last time before letting go to stand up and look at the ceiling.
He wonders why the girl was so adamant about having him stay with the family when the fact seems to be of so little importance now, but tries not to give that notion all too much meaning. Albeit bright, she's still a kid, and all this… well, it's a lot, no less so for the adults involved.
Although he tries to hide it, he's still noticeably hurting–his body and mind don't quite agree about the state of the limb that isn't anymore, and Tony finds himself in the crossfire most days. He bears it like the rest, with steely resolution that hardens the lines in his skin, and Steve admires him more every day.
He doesn't wipe the tears away when they finally come, collecting where the cowl covers his face and dripping over his cheeks.
He doesn't elaborate. Steve can tell it's something he'd rather not address with the way his eyes flit from one point of the wall behind Steve's head to another, nervous and waiting for him to get the gist. He does have a pretty good guess, but he isn't going to go off something as fleeting as assumptions here.
Steve knows it long before Tony’s hand stops rubbing at his arm and the deep, reddened teeth marks are fully exposed. Steve knows it long before Tony starts to shake his head, a slow loop that goes left to right and left again in a disbelieving trance. Steve knows it long before Tony’s jaw falls open and he whispers a hoarse, desperate litany of, “No, no, no, no, no,” that drills into his brain and right through every rational thought he’s ever had.
It did, at times. But the good moments they shared, the memories Steve has of the time they had together – even now, with all of them tainted and bittersweet, he wouldn't trade them for the world.
Tony huffs in exasperation. "This is unreasonable. Nothing's happened yet, and nothing will happen this night. Just let me keep watch, and you–"
When Lord Anthony greeted her with a "My Lady," smiling still and somehow smelling of lavender, something within her bristled.
Tony likes to sit as far away from the broken window as possible. He hasn't grown accustomed to the temperatures and doubts he ever will. Really, he's positive nobody does; people just pretend to cope until eventually the cold seeps under their skin and into their bones and becomes bearable because it's part of them. Tony thinks there's a metaphor somewhere in there, but he's too far gone to think about it and come morning he won't remember, so why bother?
"Thank God," someone says, close by. Very close by, in fact– Tony feels a gust of warm air brush past his cheek, and whoever said it is right there, and that line of warmth pressed along his back isn't a blanket like he's assumed. It would've been a strange blanket, anyway, huddled against his skin hot like a furnance.
Maybe to someone else that would be frightening, carrying a love to this devastating extent, but Tony and he have always been more. And if there’s something Steve won’t ever come to regret, it’s loving wholly and truly.
No, Steve is, Steve is running his hands up, and then he's crossing them on Tony's chest, coming to lay over his only minimally (but
He goes to look for his phone and finds it on the coffee table in the living room, where he sits down on the couch. He fidgets, stalls, fists his hands in his hair in frustration and turns the small device over in his hands until he nearly drops it.
“Will he pull through?” the stranger inquired, gesturing toward the men that were carrying Anthony back to where they had set up camp the day prior.
It hurts to think about, those many little things Tony must desperately try to find comfort in in his grief, and Steve only manages to wrench his eyes away and leave the man after staring at him, lost in thought, for way too long. He leaves the room, chancing a look at Tony's curled-up form one more time before he pulls the door close gently.
Tony fights with everything he has, wounds a titan, and still loses. He takes a moon and the power of four Infinity Stones, but it's his own ingenuity that does him in.
Soon after learning of the man's impairment, Bruce was shown the system the castle's masters had worked out under Stark's command – a silent language, spoken through gestures and movements of a person's hands.
"So, let me get this straight one more time: You returned the Tesseract to where it belonged at the time, which, as you've established, was the bunker in Camp Leigh. And then," Fury chuckles, and Steve doesn't like where this is going. "And
,” he barks, dragging one of the alphas back by the shoulders while Bucky and, after a moment, Natasha dash out of the crowd to help. He growls at the assailant, daring him to challenge his position; as expected, the younger man backs away, albeit reluctantly. With the help of his second-in-command, the others settle down without much fuss.
Not at first, anyway. It’s not a nightmare (he stopped getting those a long time ago), and not somebody else shaking him awake. Most of the wagon he’s in is still asleep – even Bucky in the bunk under him.
What are the odds he slept through an unannounced, late-night call to assemble that left Steve looking like this? More importantly, if the situation was that dire, why wasn’t Tony invited?
Until the very moment she found herself at the full attention of the subject of her scrutiny, that was.
Ouch. Steve chuckles, but promptly swallows the noise when she shoots him a disgruntled look, eyes distinctly narrowed. Right, how dare him? This is a serious matter.
