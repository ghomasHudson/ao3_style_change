After the hushed breakfast, they went on with their morning routine. Brushing teeth, making beds, washing dishes, and heading towards the main library to look up cases. Dean sat down with the dog next to him and propped open his laptop. He traced his hand over the carvings under the lamp before turning his attention towards the screen in front of him. He noticed something that caught his eye while Sam sat down across from him.
Years. Sam and Eileen were married with a child, settling in a suburban area. Sam named the child after the man who had sacrificed a lot to protect him. The man who practically raised him, the one who died for him, the one who saved him, the one who was willing to go up against God for him. Dean. Sam promised to protect him as his older brother had protected Sam.
Sam placed his hand around Dean, feeling a very warm liquid. Pulling away, his hand was covered in blood.
You gave up grace so you could live life with Dean, and actually live it. You worked as a beekeeper, taking care of them with care. You spread words of kindness and spirit, despite all you know of the Universe. You helped people, and you did it all with love. Love for Dean, love for humanity, love for the world.
Castiel Winchester, as I go over your life, I have decided my ruling. Julie, take him to Heaven. There’s someone waiting for him up there.”
Accepting it all, the reality that what Chuck wanted came to him, regardless if he was still around or not. Sam looked his brother in the eyes for the last time, and placed their foreheads together.
They walked through the barn doors, machetes at the ready. It was dark, creaky, and quiet. Despite the seemingly absent vamps, they were still on high alert. The brothers made a rapid sweep of the place. A muffled sound emerged from behind two wooden doors. Keeping their blades high, they carefully opened the doors.
Dean woke up, greeted by Miracle licking him. He squeezed the dog and buried his head on their shoulder. He looked around the quiet room, as if he was expecting something there, but nothing was.
Jack seemed to be doing just fine as the new Almighty, while they hadn’t seen him since he took over, nothing had gone wrong, so they assumed he was managing. The Empty hadn’t come storming for Cas yet, so Dean took that as a good thing. A few cases came up, they took care of them. Dean was careful not to be pushed onto any rusty nails.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jack looked around; it was just as he had remembered. Nothingness was everywhere, yet he was still grounded in one spot. He knew the Empty would be furious knowing what he was about to do, and it was bad enough Jack had nearly killed it with the celestial bomb. But, he had to do this.
Cas thought for a moment, “In all honesty, I’m not really sure. I heard a voice, like the time before, but it didn’t sound like one I knew. It was...powerful, but it certainly wasn’t Chuck or Amara. More like a blend. Next thing I knew, I was back here, and I felt your soul fading. Followed it’s trace, and it led me to you, as I hoped it would,”
Cas smiled, and placed a tender kiss onto Dean’s lips. They shared it for what felt like forever, before pulling apart to breathe.
Sam let out a breath of exhaustion, and went to check on Dean, who didn’t look so good, himself. Dean was gasping a little, and seemed to be in pain. The younger Winchester laid a hand on his brother, and Dean winced.
Scanning the void around him, he looked for the presence of a certain angel. Picking up the grace, Jack followed its trail, all the way to a vessel he knew too well. Leaning over it, he reached out and grabbed its hand.
“Hello, Castiel. As you might have assumed, your time has come. For the last time, hopefully. Well, your life has been a long one, from the day you were created, to now. It’s going to be hard to judge your deeds with the amount you’ve seen and done. I’ll have to dial Death in order to form a proper ruling for you.” the reaper said a few words of a foreign language under her breath. Next to her, a figure in dark clothes appeared. Castiel did not recognize the new Death, but at least they weren’t Billie.
“You know, Cas, I never got to tell you, because you left so suddenly, but…” he brought his eyes back to the angel’s and placed their heads together, “but, I love you, too. Always have.”
“Hey, hey it’s okay, we’re here to get you out,” Dean whispered, as to not draw too much attention in case of a stalker. They hesitated before sneaking cautiously towards the men. Before they were able to run, a group of vamps creeped up behind them. Like the sketch, they were masked. They were seemingly built on upper body strength, and stood menacingly.
“Why spare him? Last I saw, you were furious, wishing to kill him at any moment, wanting to do anything you could to rid the world of him,”
Sam’s eyes started to fill with tears. He refused to accept it, not after all they’ve been through. He was not about to lose his brother, not here, not now. Dean placed a hand on Sam’s shoulder, telling him it was going to be okay. It would all be okay. (It’s not like ambulances existed or anything.)
After a swift flip through of John’s journal, they found out it was a nest of vamps, and were able to track them down. The trip to the barn wasn’t bad, and they opened the trunk to reveal their many weapons.
Decades. Both brothers had grown old, the angel had given up grace to grow old with his love. It wasn’t long before Dean had a heart attack (y’know, bacon) and passed, leaving Cas to mourn. Sam left soon after, his wife and son at his bedside.  Cas was the last to go. At Death’s door nine months after the love of his life had gone.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Actually, I found one thing,” Dean said, standing up to grab his coat. Sam followed behind, Miracle behind him. They gathered up everything and hopped into the Impala, heading out the door.
Weeks had passed, Dean and Cas had settled into one room together. The bunker wasn’t as quiet and glum as it used to be. Sam occasionally rolled his eyes at the PDA, but smiled on the inside. Eileen had also been in town, and she and Sam had gone on a few dates. She had been all caught up on the whole ‘disappearing humanity’ thing and was, unsurprisingly, shocked.
“Okay, okay. You can go now,” tears fell from both brothers’ eyes. Dean soon became limp, and Sam had to let go. Though, it wasn’t the last thing to occur here.
A familiar flutter came from behind Sam, and he turned around. The man moved towards Dean’s body, and placed a hand onto his forehead, a glow coming from it. Within seconds, Dean regained consciousness as quickly as he had gone. Both Winchesters were confused, but soon, Dean realized what was going on.
Following the footprints leading down to a beach, he saw two men in chairs, with one empty. He knew it was them. Cas headed down and stood next to Dean.
The older Winchester grudgingly got out of bed and made his way to the kitchen. Like many mornings since Jack left, it was very quiet. Sam was up and making breakfast, toast and eggs. Dean slumped into a chair and the two ate in silence. Miracle received a little piece of bacon, and begged for another chunk.
“Ah, yes. Castiel. You’re here for the ruling, aren’t you? Well, with all the bends in your life, I will judge you like every other human, by your mortal life. The one you’ve spent with Sam and Dean.
“Oh, God...Here, let’s see if I can get you off,” Sam said, hoping, praying it was just something small.
Inside, it was nothing like he had remembered from serving there. None of it was his memories, but it all seemed connected. He looked around and spotted an all too familiar car, which meant he couldn’t be far.
They arrived back at the bunker, with Miracle greeting them. Cas was surprised that Dean allowed a dog into the bunker, but it seemed to make him happy, so he didn’t question it. Interlocking hands, they headed towards the library to catch up.
Months went by. Dean had decided to take up a job as a mechanic, moving out of the bunker with Cas, who had taken the Winchester name. They moved into a nice, small home in Kansas, together. While he still hunted, he grew more and more close to a regular life. Sam and Eileen continued to hunt together, making jokes and just allowing themselves to enjoy the freedom.
Dean almost swung, but they were greeted with the two missing children, who looked scared out of their minds. Dean didn’t blame them, they were, after all, just kids.
Dean refused to let go of the angel. He didn’t want Cas to leave him again, especially not after what he said. He looked into Castiel’s very blue eyes, finally understanding why he was always….different around Cas. Twelve years of pushed away feelings came to him, and he let them stay. Finally, he knew, he understood, he accepted. Without hesitation, he pulled the angel into a soft kiss. (Sam is just squealing, for he always knew)
Dean nodded trying to ignore the disappointment. “You’re smart aren’t you?” A small blush rose to Castiel’s cheeks and he quickly looked away.
They didn’t even bother to ask why he was helping them, Anna just grabbed Dean’s hand and ran to the SoyBean Field.
“I do. I want to kill him if he’s not already dead.” And Lucifer was gone too. Just another parental figure in Castiel’s life who abandoned him.
Dean nodded, not questioning. “Alright then. Don’t worry I’ll take the lead. It’ll be fun.” Dean flashed a blinding grin before the bell wrung and was gone, leaving Cas looking out of sorts.
Uriel and Balthazar were playing with a little boy with shaggy hair when Castiel emerged from his last class. They were jumping around in the courtyard, throwing a ball back and forth with him.
“No, he’s not.” Sam interrupted. Jody and Dean both gave Sam a strange look. Sam simply shrugged, “This is his home too.” Jody and Dean both smiled, and Cas bowed his head, but a faint blush could be seen on his cheeks.
Dean wasn’t happy about it but agreed. He stayed with them for dinner, enjoying their strange little family. But he had difficulty taking his mind off Cas.
So Cas’s only friend left him. 8th grade was the worst year of his life. Anna was at another school, at another home. They weren’t allowed to see each other. And without his big sister to protect him, he was suddenly a target.
“I can’t. I can’t abandon my family.” Anna frowned, frustrated, “But it doesn't make sense. All I want is to go to college. If I went to college I could make more money for the family. But they won’t let me.”
“The problem is- that I don’t know what I am. And that night, I… well you were there and you were you and all warm and perfect and Cas.” Dean hugged him tighter. “But, I- I don’t want to- I can’t give what you need.” He heard Cas make a noise of disagreement but shushed him, “I, I don’t feel ready to be in a relationship. Not with you not with anyone. This sounds horrible but I can’t commit to you, and I can’t treat you the way you deserve to be treated. And I shouldn’t have done what I did last night, that wasn’t fair. But I was being selfish. I’m really sorry about that.”
Speaking of girls, a redheaded sophomore was walking towards them. She was pretty and looked serious. “Castiel.” She stopped in front of their table looking and Cas with a slight frown.
“I know John I’ve been where you are. I couldn’t afford to shut down like this and you sure as hell can’t.  you got two little boys that need raising. What would Mary want?”
But that Friday he was on the way to the gym when he heard yelling from the coach’s office. Dean, being the inquisitive soul he was, listened in at the door.
But closed their distance, kissing the corner of her mouth. This one was a little longer, and after he pulled back, a small smile could be seen tugging at the corners of her lips. Finally, she brought them back together, initiating a deeper kiss, square on his mouth. And for a few moments, he lost himself in her.
Cas smiled, “It was worth it.” Their faces were centimeters apart. Dean could feel Cas’s breath and their noses were practically touching. He partially wished it wasn’t so dark so he could properly see the blue in Cas’s eyes.
Dean fell back laughing, “C’mon! It’s about time! He’s in middle school now.” He wiggles his eyebrows at Sam who just laughs harder. Even Cas, who didn’t totally understand the joke, was laughing.
Dean laughed, “No. I mean, I wouldn’t be opposed to that, she’s amazing. I just don’t think she’s really big into the whole idea of dating. Especially not as a freshman. And you know what? I don’t think that’s such a bad thing. I’m glad she was my first date, first kiss. But I don’t need to marry her now?”
Castiel’s voice was lower than most boys their age. But it suited him well, despite being sort of scrawny.
“Don’t you want me to be happy Cassy?” He supposed he did want her to be happy. But that didn’t make it hurt any less. “You could come with me?” She suggested hopefully.
“Why should we have faith in Chuck? What has he done for us?” It was Lucifer’s voice. Castiel felt anger threaten to push through his ongoing numbness. Anna rested a comforting hand on his shoulder.
“Castiel. Do you know how to pray?” His older siblings all turned to him in shock. He was being addressed. By name.
Gabriel glanced over at Anna. A look of regret glanced over his face. And he didn’t seem like the regretful type.
Cassie was at practice almost every day for the next three weeks. In the fourth week, she stopped showing up. Dean didn’t think much of it.
“I agree.” Michael emerged from his room, sitting down at the head of the table. Everyone fell silent, even the youngest kids who were having their own conversation at their end of the table. “Ishim, we haven’t prayed yet.” Even though he wasn’t the one who did the wrong thing, Cas still felt his face heat up.
“Huh. Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask how many siblings does he have anyway? Cause I’ve counted like eight already.”
“Ok.” Bobby finally says, “That’s enough of the warm and fuzzy.” Jody smiles at him, and passes her gift to Cas. She got him an annotated copy of The Odyssey and Commedia. She gave Bobby an expensive bottle of whisky. They had a relatively strict rule against alcohol in the house, so Cas could tell this was a special gift. Bobby gave Dean a large box of school supplies, laughing at Dean's reaction. Despite the annoyance, Dean seemed to appreciate it. Bobby gave Jody what looked like a very warm jacket that had lots of pockets. Jody gave Dean a new video game for the switch, and Sam got a bunch of new clothes from Jody and a beginner’s auto mechanic kit from bobby. Dean mentioned getting something similar from bobby when he was Sam’s age and really enjoying it.
Blue eyes were sitting alone, so Dean walked over and sat across from him. The worst he could do was ignore him.
She shrugged, “Well, I lost friends for a while. And then Steve asked me out and I thought it was because he didn’t care about all that shit. But when he tried to do stuff to me it turned out that he was only going out with me cause Eldon told him I was loose.”
“That’s ok. I’ll think of something. But really, the best thing two dudes can do outside of school together is just hanging out. We can go to my place or your place or hang out at the mall or something.
Dean yanked his hand back, “I’m fine.” But Cas was persistent, getting into the driver's seat of the impala, “Hey! No one drives Baby but me!” Cas simply rolled his eyes and started her up.
Dean frowned, “I don’t think we have gray frosting.” A big glob of green landed in Dean’s hair. “Bobby!” Dean threw the red at Bobby and soon they and Sam were in a violent food fight as Cas and Jody contemplated their life choices.
“That’s why I’m not gonna be part of that,” Gabriel explained. “You and Anna are gonna bust Cassie out. And then the two of you are gonna make a break for it.”
“It’s sorta freaky. I mean the head. Not the fact that you wear a necklace. Although that’s sorta freaky too. What other jewelry d’you got?”
Dean looked up at his little brother. He thought for a moment, looking around at his stuff. He was trying to assess his feelings about the situation. If Mom was dead did he care about leaving this house? About leaving John? As long as he had Sammy, what else did he really need?
“You know I’m actually pretty good in school,” Cas said a few weeks later as Dean slaved over his geometry book.
“It’s gonna be ok,” Anna assured, more to herself than to Dean. But he took a breath at her words anyway.
“Hey, don’t get so worked up I’m just looking at it. Honestly, I think it’s kinda cool. I’d ask if it was valuable but,” He looked Dean up and down with a smirk, “we both know the answer to that.”
I guess their voices had gotten a little too high, cause the door flung open and the lights flicked on.  John scanned the room where Sam and Dean were sitting frozen like deers in a headlight.
Cassie crossed her arms, Dean could see tears swelling but she blinked them away. She opened her mouth, then closed it. Finally resolving to just nod. She cleared her throat after a minute. “Don’t you have practice?”
On the first day of school, Dean sat alone, not even bothering to make a friend. The second day Anna walked up and sat directly across from him.
“So when are we gonna do this?” Dean asked, taking a swig of his water, wishing it was much stronger.
“Alright, kiddos put your pens down that’s time.” Dean didn’t get to the conclusion of his final paragraph. He’d lose points for that and not restarting his thesis, but he did his best. He studied and everything. And a small part of him enjoyed it.
Dean helped Cas to bed after stripping himself, aggressively ignoring how turned on he was becoming and pulled the covers over both of them.
Cas did his own muted version of a shrug, “It was a long time ago. My older siblings raised me.” Dean nodded in understanding.
“I didn’t realize you were a Shurley,” Jody commented. Sam and Dean both glanced at her with mild surprise.
Cas smiled, “You only have to get to the end of this unit Friday, and then we have finals the next week and then it’s winter break.”
“Oh.” Jody frowned slightly. Lots of kids don’t have phones at 15. She didn’t when she was his age. But to be fair that was a different time. “You can borrow mine?”
After he was gone Cas turned to Dean, “Why would we have a pillow fight in our underwear?” Dean raised his eyebrows at Cas, trying not to let the image of Cas in his boxers seep into his mind.
“Alright, Sammy here you go.” Dean handed Sam his gift in a bag. Sam instantly started laughing his head off.
“Seriously? You want to try out for wrestling?” Dean wasn’t a small guy. He stood at 5’9” which was taller than the average guy in his grade. But he was scrawny. Especially compared to these seniors who were running tryouts. Cas was sitting on the bleachers for moral support.
Jody gave Cas an iPhone case, charger, and earbuds. That confused Cas, since he didn’t have a phone. But he accepted them graciously without saying anything. And then he opened Dean’s gift.
While the family had their eyes closed, Cas looked at Dean. Trailing the pattern of his freckles while thinking about the fact that from this point on, all things would be compared to Dean Winchester and his family.
“Thank you for tonight,” Lisa said, sitting next to Dean, leaning her head on his shoulder. He felt heat run up his chest neck and radiate off his cheeks.
“The first part of the plan,” Anna began looking anxious, “I gotta say it’s bad. It’s chaotic and vague but I don’t know what else to do.”
Gabriel slept in the little kids' rooms for the next three years. He was the nicest of the big brothers. He was fun and hopeful.
The first day back in school was awkward, but nothing changed. Cas and Dean ate lunch together, and since it was a Monday, Cas nodded goodbye to Dean across the gym while Dean was warming up for wrestling.
“They’re all bad.” Anna nervously wrung her hands on the table. “But Michael is the worst. He- he did this thing.”
“Ok, we owe him a tryout.” Another boy stepped onto the mat. The guy was about Dean’s height, but more buff.
But he pulled Dean’s head into the crook of his neck and wrapped his arms securely around the other boy. Dean was practically vibrating with warmth, gently kissing Cas’s neck until he fell asleep.
Cas nodded, “I think I respect them. They’re a large family. There’s no confusion or chaos. Just loyalty and purpose. And they die to save each other.”
And well poor Dean didn’t know what to say to that. So he just scoffed and muttered whatever, hoping Cas wouldn’t take offense. But Cas was already on another topic. “So. What do we do now?”
“So… this is an incredibly complicated situation Dean. I can’t expect you to understand. And I wouldn’t involve you at all but I believe you do care about Cas.”
Dean cut him off, sealing their lips together chastely. He didn’t know what he was thinking. All this would do was open up an ugly can of worms. Complicate whatever weird relationship they had. But he didn’t want to stop. He moved over slightly so he was kissing Cas into his pillow.
Anna was his only friend after that. She looked out for him all through school. She protected him from Raphael and Michael’s bad days. She taught him how to watch his mouth around Michael, and even their other siblings who quickly learned their lessons. Michael had ears in every Shurley except Anna. Castiel didn’t know how to survive without her. Unfortunately, four years later she was about to begin high school and realized just how miserable she was. Gabriel had just graduated and had a small apartment downtown. Without even telling Castiel, she went home on a different bus. There was a custody battle between Gabe and Michael. Gabe won. And Anna didn’t come home.
Cas shook his head, but smiled fondly at his sister, “I found it quite enjoyable. I think we’ll have some excellent teachers this year.”
Bobby nodded in approval, “You should bring a few over some time.” The idea of another person spending time with them, connecting with their family the way Cas had, sleeping in Deans bed. It put a bad taste in his mouth. It almost made him sick.
“Do you want to call your parents and ask if it’s ok for you to stay the night?” Jody asked as Dean and Sam did the dishes. She somewhat planned a situation where she could integrate Cas with minimum interruption from Dean. He could still hear them but what would he do about it?
“Dean! You wanna drive Sammy to school? Celebrate your license?” Dean nodded happily as Bobby tossed him the keys to the Impala.
“Wait what?” Dean glanced between Gabriel and Anna in disbelief. “The whole point is that we can’t do that because then Gabe could get in trouble for kidnapping and never get custody of Cas.
Anna shook her head, it was a small movement but on her usual stoic form it looked almost frantic. “No Dean, we don’t get pulled out until we graduate tenth grade. So there are no questions about ages.”
“Hey, baby it’s ok.” He pulled Cas towards him and slipped the trench coat and blazer off his shoulders as un-sexually as he could, then unbuttoned his shirt.
“C’mon man it’s the end of the day. Give me my necklace so we can all go home.” Dean was reaching his breaking point. This guy was only a sophomore. And he was the same size as Dean. He wasn’t in the mood but need be, Dean could bring him down.
“Yeah, Benny’s nice. That’s why he deals with freshmen. But like 95% of the jocks are still assholes.”
“Yeah, but he wasn’t trying all the way. It’s good sportsmanship to go easy on freshman.” A girl from the row in front of him said. “But Benny’s right. Dean’s really good.”
John opened the door and let Dean and Sam get out. He gave Sam a small hug and nodded at Dean. He then got into another one of Bobby’s cars and drove away.
“You know dumping me won’t make you any less of a slut.” Dean was about to throw open the door and beat the shit out of this guy, but the door opened before he could. Cassie stalked out, and Dean looked to see Steve cradling a bleeding nose. “The fuck are you looking at Winchester?” Dean said nothing but chased after Cassie.
An arm wrapped around Dean’s neck, Cas’s hand running through his hair, pulling Dean closer. Dean put an arm by Cas’s waist to steady himself, Nearly completely resting his chest on Cas’s.
She nodded, “Yeah. I mean, Steve, Reggie, and Tim are mean. Probably the worst bullies in the school. But I swear to god, Gordan Walker is a straight-up sociopath. He’s quieter but I know he can make people suffer.” Dean and Cas both glanced over at the boy in question, who happened to be eyeing them too.
“I’ve never had a slumber party before.” Cas mused casually. Dean choked and Sam started laughing historically. “What did I say?” Cas asked looking between the brothers, bewildered.
That night Cas and Dean were in bed. Cas was struggling to fall asleep, too excited for his first Christmas morning. Dean could tell by his breaths which were still too short and uneven.
“Mom bought us that game.” Dean bit his cheek as soon as the mention of mom slipped out. He should’ve known better.
“You know we were watching a documentary in Biology since we already took our final. We got to choose between tornadoes and Zombie Bees. I voted for tornadoes because I didn’t want to watch the bees get hurt. I had to leave class because it made me sad.”
“I can’t think of a sooner time. Michael Raphael and Zach and Naomi all go to those for the younger kids. Makes them seem less neglectful.” Anna explained.
“They don’t leave the farm often. It’d be best to plan for a time when as many are away as possible.”
Dean tried to enter 10th grade with a positive attitude. He knew this year wouldn’t be close to the same without Cas, but Cas had his own family. He wasn’t going to be the reason Cas lost them.
Cas was having difficulty not crying. For some reason, this was making him very emotional. The tie he wore had little significance. But this did. The fact that they accepted whatever quirks he had and were even willing to indulge in them.
Cas didn’t seem to mind though, “She was unhappy with the way our older brothers were raising her. So she moved in with our other older brother.”
They slept on opposite sides of the bed. Which was painful after getting to be so close last night. But Cas was right. He didn’t need Dean to feel the same way, to love him romantically. They were family, and that would have to be enough.
Cas turned to look at Dean assuredly. “You’re wrong. You contribute to how wonderful this house is.”
The elder boy grinned at Sam, ruffling his hair and getting into the driver's seat of an extremely old but well-maintained car. Sam hopped into the passenger's side and the two drove off.
“Sam. You should be asleep. Dean shut that thing off. I need to talk to you.” John jerked his head to the hall.
“Thank you for loving my brother.” She said once they had parted. If he wasn’t taken so off guard he would have denied his love for Cas. Love was for girls and girly things. But at that moment he was too vulnerable to lie.
Dean honestly didn’t even know why he was going to school. He was gonna be a mechanic. He was good at it and Bobby would give him a job. But Jody said that if he wanted a job at their shop, he had to at least get a high school diploma.
Dean nodded, “yeah sure.” They stood at the corner of the gym for a while. Dean did his best not to let his eyes linger on Lisa. Her dress was a neutral pink that made her skin look so inviting. Her hair fell in waves down her back and shoulders, clipped behind her ears. He wanted… something from her. He just didn’t know what. It seemed too early in the night to kiss her. Especially after that last conversation. But Dean wanted to be closer.
Sam got Cas a bracelet that was similar to Dean's necklace, and Cas tried not to think too hard about the symbolism in that. He could see on Dean’s face that he was having similar thoughts. Cas gave Bobby and Jody fancy coffee, which would go well with Dean’s mugs. He gave Dean a vinyl record player and Led Zeppelin to go with it.
“This one?” Dean slowed the car down, nodding to Cas’s house. Cas nodded. It was the only house in sight. Samandriel and Hael could be seen playing in the grass. Dean glanced at them as he pulled the car to a stop a few yards away. “How many siblings do you have anyway?”
Dean took the book out of Sam’s hands eyeing it skeptically. He looked like he was going to make some comment on Sam and Cas being nerds, but instead, he looked Cas dead in the eye and said, “This was really thoughtful Cas.” And handed the book back to Sam. Cas blushed but said nothing.
“That’s ok, you don’t have to,” Dean responded. So they just sat on the blacktop leaning against Baby in silence.
Cas flushed slightly at the bright grin Dean was sporting and refusing to look anywhere but directly at Cas. Cas found himself wanting Dean to smile like that every moment. “They’re letting me in! And that Benny guy seems pretty cool. Maybe this school doesn’t suck so bad.”
Cas felt a strange sense of fear as Sam unraveled his present, sure he would hate it. But Sam grinned brightly at the book, “Well, Dean told me you like that kind of thing. I know Christmas presents are supposed to be more fun but-” Sam interrupted Cas with a tight hug.
“Spent time with someone who wasn’t a sibling outside of school.” Dean tried not to let his reaction to that show on his face. He didn’t want to make Cas feel weird.
Dean could have guessed that Cas’s brothers crossed into abuse. But he wasn’t under the impression it was any worse than his own father, who teetered the line.
“No.” He said firmly. “This is my home. These people are my family and I’m loyal to them. I will not leave them.”
Dean was the one to break the contact and he found himself missing it instantly, “Alright get outta here.”
“Uh- no problem. I haven’t read it but it’s won some awards so you’ll have to tell me if it’s any good.”
John wasn’t able to keep his job after Mary died. His head just wasn’t straight. Dean tried to pick up his slack, but the shop just couldn’t keep John on.
“Speak for yourself. He abandoned us with these jerks.” Cas and Anna both threw her a look. “Not you.” Anael clarified, “Michael and Raphael.”
Hey Sammy. I’m not gonna be gone too long I hope. But Cas wasn’t doing so good and I had to help him. I know it’s hard to understand and I can’t really explain it all. It’s really complicated and I barely understand it myself. But stay away from the Shurley’s ok? They’re not good people. I promise I’ll be home soon and I’ll stay safe. But I gotta do this for Cas. You were right, we do anything for family.
After that dance was over they grabbed drinks and headed to the courtyard to cool off. The gym was loud and sweaty and they both needed air.
Cas smiled, “They are.” Dean and Cas looked at each other for a while. Neither of them wanted to look away, analyzing each other's subtle eye movements.
“Can you just sit with me for a bit?” She asked, looking incredibly vulnerable. Dean nodded, even scooching closer and wrapping an arm around her. She leaned her head on his shoulder.
“You better treat that angel real nice when you go back to school next week,” Bobby said, looking over all of Dean’s tests.
Cas laughed. Actually laughed, Dean wasn’t sure if he had heard that before, “Of course. It’ll be helpful for both of us. I’m more likely to actually work if I’m being useful to you. And it’ll be a good review for me. And hopefully, you’ll understand the material better. And it’s an excuse for us to hang out more outside of school.”
“I saw Sam playing with my little brothers at the blacktop where I picked them up after school yesterday,” Cas spoke shamelessly.
The next day something strange happened. Incredible really. When Castiel arrived home, Balthazar holding one of his hands and Hannah holding the other, the dinner table was set. Chuck was sitting at the head of the table, and the rest of them all filled into the seats. Even the babies were put into high chairs.
“I think father may have been evil,” Castiel said one day. Anna and Gabriel had been skipping stones with him at the creek.
“Yeah, that sounds good.” She grinned at him, pulling and walking onto the dance floor. She didn’t give him bedroom eyes, or smile shyly over her shoulder. She didn’t even take his hand. She just marched into the center of the room and started dancing, letting Dean do his part to keep up with her.
“Alright guys we have two more months of wrestling and then that’s it for this year. So let’s make it count ok? We have a competition in a few-”
John scoffed, shaking his head, “Really? You wanna use that move? You can't use her as a shield for the rest of your goddamn life Dean. She’s dead!” His voice strangled up to a shout, before reigning back in. Dean didn’t even wince.
Cas smiled brightly, finding a one with his name on it and delicately unraveling the paper. Inside was an extremely soft blue tie, similar to his own but with a nicer material and more attractive pattern.
“Y’know, it’s good of you to keep a brave face up for your brother, but I know you hate it here.” Bobby gruffed.
Cas rolled his eyes. Wow, he was more expressive today than usual, “You don’t need to pay me, Dean. We’re friends.” And then his smile faltered as if he was suddenly unsure, “We are friends right?”
Dean came back to school the Monday after homecoming practically glowing. Happiness looked good on him, so Cas barely minded.
“How was your first day of high school?” Naomi asked as she passed around the bowl of peas and macaroni.
That was the best summer Dean could remember. He missed his mom like crazy, but even when she was around things weren’t perfect. John and Mary loved each other, but they didn’t seem like each other very much.
Cas wrapped an arm around Dean’s shoulder, “I’m not sure you understand how much this means to me.” Cas then looked up at the rest of them, “You guys are my family and I love you. All of you.”
“I figure she’s your car now. John doesn’t seem to want any part of her. He got that car for Mary.” Bobby looked at Baby sadly, before helping Sam into the car with his books.
“He’s not coming back.” Anna’s voice made Castiel jump as she sat on the stairs next to him. He nodded in agreement.
Castiel doesn’t remember all of what Michael did to him. It was a long time ago now, and a traumatic memory he avoided like the plague. He remembered being hit repeatedly. And being hungry. Praying on his knees for hours until they were bruised. Asking God for forgiveness. He would never betray his brothers. He learned that his brothers took care of him. He would be weak without them. He could never leave.
On Friday Castiel simply didn’t meet his brothers at the bus stop. Naomi said it was fine as long as he found his own way home. Cas figured Dean could drop him off.
“Well, they aren’t treating this woman very respectfully. I mean, I haven’t seen many movies, but I was raised believing that things like sexual orientation, gender, and race were not relevant in the eyes of God. My older sister would be furious if she saw this kind of representation of women. She seems to only exist to provide motivation for the male hero.”
Cas shook his head. He didn’t seem upset. “All we know is that I was born on a Thursday. We don’t know which Thursday.”
“Look Cas, that guy doesn’t- he was just messing around. I mean we used to share a bed all the time this doesn’t mean we have to, you know- Cas?” Cas was standing at the door, tears falling from his eyes. Dean had never seen Cas cry before, so it was shocking at first, but then he sprung into action.
Dean paid his brother no mind. As soon as Cas galloped by, he flung himself in front of the Bull, hoping to somehow delay the beast. The Bull never saw Dean, but even if he had, he wouldn’t have slowed. The Bull ran right through Dean, oblivious to the human. Once the Bull passed, Dean fell to the ground with a single pain-filled cry. His body was mangled, limbs turned the wrong way, and burns covered every inch of skin that could be seen. He took a rattling breath before falling still; the life was gone from his body.
“I love you Dean; I hope you know how true that is.” Cas eyes danced with fiery passion as he gazed at the man beneath him.
Jack giggled; playing airplanes was one of his favorite games. He stretched his arms in front of him and made a clicking sound. “I’m buckled in, Daddy! Let’s fly!”
While Dean moved, Cas squirted some lube onto his fingers and rubbed it around on his hand to warm it up. He rubbed one lubed finger against Dean’s rim, smiling when he heard Dean’s moan echo in his head. He slipped just the tip of his finger inside, wanting to tease his boyfriend. He let the finger rest there, not moving it any further inside of Dean.
“He can transform in any water, but only salt-water can rejuvenate him. He’s not quite as bad today as he was the other day. Maybe the longer he stays on land, the longer he will be able to go without having to go back into the ocean,” Dean suggested.
He petted a hand down the top of Miracle’s head and whispered, “C’mon boy, let’s give the two love birds some peace and quiet.”
“Please, please, just bring them back. Bring everybody back, including Cas, and you can have me. It’s always been me you’ve wanted so here I am. Just bring them back, bring Cas back,” Dean said softly to the empty field, his voice full of emotion.
Cas swam to the edge of the pool so he could hoist his upper body out, his tail floating behind him. Dean walked over and kneeled in front of him.
Dean’s voice broke as a sob escaped him. “I’ve never felt like this before, and I was scared and confused. I couldn’t fathom the thought that you would feel the same way. I’m just a screwed up human who’s made tons of bad decisions. I fell in love with you years ago, but why would I ever think that an angel would fall in love with a demon like me? Of course I love you! How could I not? I love you Cas, more than I have words for,” Dean said, his voice dropping to a whisper. Tears were clouding his eyes, and his hands were shaking. His throat hurt from all the tears clogging it, and he clenched his jaw to keep another sob from being ripped from his body.
Cas was too exhausted to think about why the archangel had visited him. He set his alarm, turned off his light, and slipped into bed. He still hated the feeling of unconsciousness that sleep brought with it, but he welcomed it that night.
They spent the next half-hour building the perfect snowman. Cas let Jack help roll the snow into a ball that was bigger than him for the snowman’s bottom. Cas made sure the ball was as perfectly round as it could be before they worked on the snowman’s middle. Jack wanted to make that ball even bigger than the first, and Cas had to explain why it had to be smaller. Once they had the second ball made and packed tightly, Cas lifted it on top of the first ball. He then let Jack roll the snowman’s head all by himself before rounding it out and putting it on top of the other two balls of snow.
“Mhm, I might have to take you up on that offer sweetheart.” Cas ran his fingers through Dean’s dirty blonde hair.
Once the burgers were done, Dean grabbed silverware and plates. He cut a piece for Cas and slid the plate over to him. He then cut a piece for himself which was twice the size of Cas’. He shoved a forkful in his mouth and moaned. “This is delicious.”
Dean nodded his head. “You better.” Dean made sure to keep a smile on his face. He was excited for Garth and Bess, but deep down, he was a little envious. The loneliness Dean had felt that morning was hitting him full-force once more. Dean longed for children of his own, whether they be of his own blood or ones he adopted to give a better life to. Even though Dean had a well-paying job and was financially secure, he knew he couldn’t raise a child on his own. Just one more thing not having a soulmate was keeping him from experiencing.
Dean smiled as he walked onto the porch and took a seat in the rocking chair next to Bobby’s. “Hey, Bobby, So, this is Heaven? I don’t recall this memory.”
“Yes, just us,” Cas replied. “Could we have a booth, please? Jack says they are more comfortable than sitting at a table.”
Castiel took a step towards Dean, a frown on his perfect face. “Meg and Eileen are my companions, but I do not know if I consider them my friends anymore. They have done me a great evil, and I fear that they will never be able to undo it. You see me as a human, not as what I truly am.” Castiel’s voice was full of anger and also great sorrow.
“Well, we all knew dad wouldn’t be accepting of my deviance. That’s why Benny and I dated in secret for over two years,” Dean replied flatly.
He had wanted to kiss Cas, desperately so, but he couldn’t. For Cas, the kiss would have just been a silly joke, but for Dean, it would have been so much more. The minute Cas had walked into Dean’s life, he had tried to tamp down burgeoning feelings for the heavenly being. Every time he lost the angel, it had been a punch in the gut, and Dean had been forced to face his every growing affection towards Cas. After eleven long years, Dean was finally able to admit that what he felt towards the angel was more than just brotherly love, but he knew Cas didn’t feel the same way he did.
Cas buckled Jack in his booster seat and kissed his forehead. “Sure, monkey. I can check with Kevin and make sure everything is running smoothly and see if that shipment of new arrivals came in.”
In the next instant, Castiel was no longer standing in Michael’s office. Instead he was standing in the park he had left minutes ago. He hadn’t realized how much time had passed, the Sun long since set and the moon high in the sky. There were some things he needed to take care of before he tried to integrate into Dean’s life. It would require him to use his grace which would only cause it to deplete faster, but some things couldn’t be helped.
Meg dropped her eyes. Unwilling to answer the question, she switched topics. “Even if you manage to find your way to King Wincheter’s lands, who will help you free the rest of the unicorns? There are few people who will mean anything but evil to you. They will want to do the same thing Rowena did or worse. So, take me with you for help or for laughs. Just… please take me with you.”
Dean’s legs gave out beneath him and he crumpled to the ground. Immediately, a clawed foot was reaching out to help him back to his feet. Dean was still shaky and leaned against Cas’ foot for support. He continued to stare, not knowing what to say.
They swam together for the next couple hours before deciding to return to the boat. Dean crawled onto the deck and hurried to the crank to lower the sling into the water. It was usually used to move marine animals after they had been rescued. It had been Mary’s idea to use it instead to pull Cas from the ocean so the incident with the pool or the net wasn't repeated. Cas swam into the sling and Dean used the crank to lift him out of the ocean and onto the deck of the boat.
“That asshole! I can’t believe he beat you! Shit! Why didn’t you tell me cher?” Benny was equal parts furious and hurt.
“That’s because Jack has locked the angels in Heaven and the demons in Hell. Didn’t you idjits notice that you haven’t had to face a single demon since Jack became God? No matter how hard you prayed, Cas couldn’t come to you,” Bobby explained as he took another sip of his drink.
“Hello Dean,” Castiel said. “I assure you I’m no shapeshifter. I am human, but I’m still me. Give me a silver blade, holy water, and anything else to help prove that I’m not a monster.”
“I’m proud of you Dean. You’ve made a huge turn around in such a short time. You’re like an inspiration.” Sam grinned at his brother as he ate another bite of popcorn.
“Well, I helped Ellen with Sam when he was a baby, and I’d like to think I’m pretty good with kids,” Dean said, flashing a grin at his friend.
Dean looked into loving blue and gave a weak nod, too exhausted to do anything else. He moaned wantonly as Cas slowly started to push inside his body. He paused once the head was fully enclosed within Dean, giving him a chance to get used to the feeling of being full. Cas only started moving again with another nod from Dean. He didn’t stop this time until his dick was fully hilted inside of Dean’s hot body.
A ripple traipsed through the unicorn’s body as he listened to Meg’s words. His heart had grown heavier with every passing second, and the butterfly’s words suddenly passed through his head. “They passed down the roads long ago, and the Red Bull ran close behind them and covered their footprints.” He let out a sorrowful whinny before saying, “The Bull is real, that I know. I guess I will travel to this King Winchester. Meg, I owe you a debt for freeing me. Please tell me a way in which I can repay you.”
“That is why I returned.” The unicorn answered although Meg wasn’t sure what he was implying. The unicorn was silent for a moment before adding, “You’re a true magician now. Are you finally happy?”
Just as quickly as King Winchester’s castle disappeared, the sea washed away the cloven hoofprints of the unicorns. The only difference was that they remained in the minds of the humans who had watched them flee. Sam and the women were gathered around Dean’s body, scanning the area for just a single unicorn. There was none, not even the lone black one they all wished to see.
Dean didn’t have the words, instead he pulled his husband in for a kiss to the shouts and applause of the people around him. He would love Cas for the rest of his life.
“No. This is your home as much as it is mine. I need you, Cas, even if it is just as a friend. I just need some time to work through this is all.” Dean huffed. “For once, there’s a problem you can’t help me with.”
As he ran, the butterfly's words ran through his head. “They passed down the roads long ago, and the Red Bull ran close behind them and covered their footprints.” Had the Red Bull killed them? Was the Red Bull going to kill him as well?
The unicorn cut the magician off. “I do not care about the king, nor his castle. I only wanted to know where his kingdom lay? Is there anything you can tell me about the Red Bull?”
Castiel wished he could help them, but there was little he could do. He may have gone to land many times, but he had never stepped foot on a boat before. He continued to watch the scene in front of him. He was about to swim away when suddenly a body was thrown overboard and landed heavily in the raging waters.
It was late afternoon, and the sky was a medley of colors. Purples and yellows intersected blues while oranges and pinks swirled throughout. The setting sun cast golden rays over the land, giving everything a bright glow. A single road cut through a landscape of rolling fields of corn, oat, and wheat. The silence of the evening was pierced as a large black beast of a car drove down the road. There were only two passengers in the car, and even though they hardly looked at one another, their conjoined hands rested between them.
Cas shut the door and walked back to the kitchen to set his now empty coffee cup in the sink. “I’m sure that Jack will want to play in the snow, so we will probably do that for an hour or two. Then we will head into town so I can enroll Jack in school and then grab some lunch and do a little Christmas shopping. What’s on your agenda for the day.”
“Dean,” Sam and Cas called out together as they finally located the missing Winchester. Dean was hanging from the rafters in the middle of the room. His wrists were wrapped in chains and were pulled so far above his head that his feet barely touched the ground. There were multiple IV lines in his arms, each one full of blood being pumped into collecting bags. Dean’s head lolled on his shoulders, a small string of saliva hanging from his open mouth. His skin was deathly pale, and Sam prayed they weren’t too late.
Dean hurried to take a shower and get dressed. He managed to drink a couple cups of coffee before racing out the door. He was glad by the time he arrived at the park, the caffeine had kicked in and he finally felt awake. He looked around and spotted Cas sitting by the edge of the water. Even dressed in washed out jeans and a simple t-shirt, Dean thought Cas was stunning. He hurried over and was glad that Cas flashed him a smile as he walked up.
He grinned at her and took a bite of his now cold burger. “I swear you and Sam must have rehearsed this together since you guys pretty much said the exact same thing.”
Right now, he had to agree with his father. “Angels are watching over you,” Dean scoffed as he glared at the statue. “Yeah, well if that’s true, you’re doing a pretty shit job at it buddy. My life is falling apart, and I don’t see you helping.”
Just like in the cave, when Dean said the name, the unicorn became himself once again. He jerked his head from Dean’s hand, reared onto his hind legs, and then lept away. His hooves didn’t make a sound as he bounded across the sand and up the cliffs. At the very top, the unicorn stopped and looked back down at the humans. All four of them called out a name, something that no unicorn had ever had before. They watched the unicorn shiver as if their voices had stabbed him like daggers. With one last trumpeting call, he was gone.
A sob was torn from Dean’s throat as he slammed his mouth against Cas’. Castiel immediately slid his arms around Dean’s shoulders and pulled the hunter closer. He angled his head and slotted their lips even tighter against each other. Their lips moved against each other over and over as they held each other tightly. Cas slid his tongue against the seam of Dean’s lips and the other man gasped. Cas slipped his tongue inside the steamy cauldron of Dean’s mouth and explored every last inch he could reach. His tongue danced with Dean’s as they continued kissing.
Jack had brought Cas back from the Empty months ago, yet Dean was still plagued by nightmares, forced to watch Cas die over and over again. No matter what he did, go to bed early, drink less alcohol, go for a drive in Baby, he couldn’t get rid of the nightmares. All of his friends and family were worried about him, but he refused to let any of them help him.
“So do I Cas.” Sam stood from the table and walked away, the bottle hanging loosely from his fingers.
Cas continued to swim until a large cavern and the witch came into view. Rowena was unlike any siren he had ever seen. Her tail wasn’t that of a shark but of a betta fish that humans were so fond of. Her flaming red hair matched her short candy apple colored tail. She had two large caudal fins that were spread out like giant fans. From her shoulder blades all the way to her caudal fins ran a sail-like dorsal fin. She had a matching anal fin that ran from her waist to her caudal fins. All her fins were a scarlet red that faded to white.
He was pulled from his thoughts when a pair of strong arms slid around his waist. Dean was staring at him with concerned eyes. “Baby, are you ok? You’re looking at me like I’m a ghost or something.”
Nobody was sure what happened, but suddenly there was a shout of “NO” and then Dean was falling to the ground, his hands clutching at his stomach where a vamp had just stabbed him with a blade. The last vamp’s head went flying as everyone gathered around the fallen hunter. Sam was already cradling Dean’s head in his lap as he stared at his brother.
Dean adjusted his angle slightly and Castiel arched off the bed as his prostate was struck dead on. He thrust harder, the only sound in the room was skin slapping against skin. Cas’ nails were digging into his skin so deep, he thought they might draw blood. Dean could feel his orgasm fast approaching, his veins becoming molten as pleasure raced through him.
“I can’t believe you boy. I didn’t raise a faggot for a son! What’s worse, you were letting Benny fuck you! It’s bad enough you were with a guy, but you couldn’t be man enough to at least fuck him,” John shouted, each word a punch in the face to Dean.
Cas chuckled, nothing more than a soft sigh escaping him. “Dean, God is literally standing five feet away, and there are three powerful angels not that far behind him.”
“You just need to tell yourself that it’s not. I think, maybe, if you told Cas, he would be able to help you,” Sam suggested.
“I’m happy for you, cher. From what Cas has told me about you, you’ve done alright for yourself. You and Sam started your business like you wanted and it’s really successful. I’m opening up a restaurant soon, maybe I could get you to come take a look and come up with some ideas for the place.”
Within seconds, both men were fully erect and were grinding against one another. Cas used his grip on Dean’s asscheeks to force him forward, causing even greater friction to their dicks. Dean broke the kiss to catch his breath and Cas started trailing kisses down his throat to his shoulder.
Here is a new chapter! I'm so sorry it took so long but I got caught up writing fics for two bangs I'm participating in and I don't multitask fic writing very well apparently. I promise the next chapter won't take as long to be posted. Hope you guys enjoy this chapter.
Cas placed a soft kiss to Dean’s forehead and whispered, “Frontal bone.” He then kissed each of Dean’s cheeks while saying, “Zygomatic bone.” He then kissed Dean’s nose and along his lower jaw. He said softly, “Nasal bone” and “mandible” respectively.
Cas walked up to Meg, a small smile on his face. The two stared at each other before Cas finally said, “It’s good to see you, Meg. I’ve missed you.”
“GAH,” he screamed as he threw the phone and paper onto the table. He scrubbed at his face, muttering, “Why is this so hard?”
As the man and Meg galloped down the path, the magician hoped the unicorn wouldn’t leave her behind. They traveled until the moon was high in the sky, finally coming upon a small encampment at the edge of the woods. They rode to the center of the camp, where a large black pot sat over a burning fire.
“Moonshine, look at me,” Dean said in a voice rough from over a decade of being unused. When Cas locked eyes with him, he continued to speak. “How could you possibly think I would be upset with such a gift? You’ve given me my voice back, Cas, and I will never be able to repay you for that. I love you so much, moonshine.”
One morning, the unicorn was about to turn off the road to sleep when he caught sight of a man working in a garden. He knew he should hide, but his curiosity got the better of him, so he walked closer. When the man caught sight of the unicorn, his eyes lit up. He dropped his hoe and pulled his belt from around his waist.
He was startled when a little girl suddenly ran into the kitchen, screaming, “Papa, papa, pick me up! Save me from the evil monster!” She flung herself at Cas and he just managed to catch her. Her dark brown hair was askew, and her green eyes were alight with laughter as Cas lifted her up. She quickly wrapped her arms around Cas’ neck and her legs around his waist, giggling all the time. “Run papa or the evil monster will catch us,” she cried in between her laughter.
“Oh I don’t know. You were the one trying to wear me around for a meat suit so you could start the Apocalypse which would have destroyed the world. Not too sure if you can handle that much power,” Dean said angrily.
He shivered and shook his head as that thought crossed his mind. Guys were not cute and even if they were, Dean had no business thinking such things.
Meg took a deep breath and held her hands in front of her, searching deep inside her soul. She felt a tingling sensation somewhere buried deep. “Magic, do as you will. Magic, do as you will!” Meg felt the power rush through her and into the air, racing towards the unicorn. It was like waves, the power rippling through her, crashing against her until she fell to her knees.
The whole experience was even better when they realized the girl who was helping them knew sign language since her brother was deaf. She seemed to enjoy helping them as much as Cas was loving picking out clothes of his own. When they were finally ready for checkout, Dean made sure to leave her a huge tip. She thanked him profusely, but he just smiled and said she earned it. Cas was so excited to wear some of his new clothes that she offered him the changing room.
Dean pulled Cas forward. “Hey, Charlie. This is Cas, and the cute kid on my shoulder is Jack.” Dean glanced at Cas, happiness shining in his eyes. “Cas is my soulmate.”
“You know what, Cas, I don’t need this! I don’t need some friend of Dean’s judging me when he doesn’t know a damn thing about me! If Dean is hanging around people like you, I can’t imagine he’s much better. Goodbye, Cas,” Sam said before ending the call.
Cas took a seat next to Dean once again. “I don’t understand what you’re trying to say, Dean. I know you care about me. You’ve told me multiple times how I’m like a brother to you and Sam.”
“I can’t believe you’re my brother sometimes,” Sam grumbled. “Life would have been so much easier as an only child.”
They pulled into the parking lot of the Roadhouse and Dean put Baby in park. He turned to look at Cas and couldn’t help but reach out and stroke his cheek with his thumb. Cas looked at him softly. “I love you baby so freaking much. When I’m working or staying at the business late, just know that I only think of you and Jack and Claire. I promise once the school and the restaurants are done, things should slow back down for a little bit. When we go to Louisiana, I’m gonna meet with Benny for three days. The rest of the time will be spent with my wonderful little family who I love to pieces.”
Dean described as he grabbed the bottle of lube and squirted some on his palm. He waited for an answer from Cas.
That's a wrap! Hope you guys have enjoyed this little fic! Leave a comment and let me know what you thought!
They were broken out of their thoughts when Sam shouted, “Dammit Jo, look what you did! Cas could have been hurt!”
The two men scrambled to their rooms to get dressed before cramming themselves in the bathroom to brush their teeth. Cas looked at his watch and grit hit teeth. “Dammit, I’m gonna be late no matter what. It’s a fifteen-minute walk and I only have ten minutes to get there.”
Cas grinned at Dean’s enthusiasm. “It just so happens that Jack and I are free tomorrow. Besides the days I’m working at the store, we’re free. We don’t even have plans for Christmas until my brother comes up in January to celebrate a late holiday.”
Garth chuckled. “Yeah, I think you can safely say you’re good with kids, Dean. If Bess and I need anything, we’ll be sure to call you.”
“Here you go hon, if you need anything else, let me know,” she said as she set the food in front of him.
“Are you saying what I think you’re saying? Your dad beat your brother because he wasn’t straight,” Gabe questioned, his expression softening.
Cas was instantly concerned at Jack’s mention of being cold. “C’mon, monkey. Let’s go inside and get you warmed up, and then we can absolutely go do some shopping.” They headed back inside, taking off their jackets and boots so they didn’t track snow into the house.
“We need to prioritize our shopping. Food is important but there are other important necessities such as toilet paper and shampoo. Why don’t we see how much of that kind of stuff we have and then we will worry about food,” Castiel explained.
I didn’t believe him of course and asked him to show me, which he did, but we also discovered that if we’re touching, we can communicate telepathically. We had an instant bond between us and so Cas has been with me for the past few days. We are kind of, sort of…dating.” Dean blushed as he finished signing.
Just then, Baby walked up and sniffed at Dean. He reached out and touched her nose with his. “Hey, girl. I look a little different now.”
“What about the other unicorns, though? Surely, we can’t just leave them behind. Castiel has traveled so far; we can’t let his quest end in failure. And what about your quest? Are you going to quit searching for your magic? If you do that, you will still be immortal, he will die in human form, and you should have let the Red Bull have him anyway. Do not give up, Meg, for your sake and his.”
“Why don’t you go home and get some sleep if you’re tired. Not my fault you overloaded us with orders, and we had to work overtime almost every night this week to get everything out on time,” Dean argued as he downed another shot.
The king paused. “I will not touch you. I just want to know why you continue to look out the window.”
As the night drew on, the unicorn became more and more on edge, his eyes scanning the clearing as he paced his cage restlessly. “Where is that magician?” he muttered to himself. With every inch the moon dropped, the unicorn’s hope faded.
“I’m the one that got lucky, baby. You’ve turned my entire world upside down in so many ways. I didn’t know how much I was missing in my life until I met you. I love you more than I have words Cas.” Dean hid his face in Cas’ back, enjoying the feeling of holding the man in his arms.
“NO,” Dean hollered. Without any weapon to defend himself, he jumped in front of Cas, putting himself directly in front of the Bull.
“You watched him drive unicorns into the ocean,” Meg said. “They were not dreams, and you both know that. I’m sure as you grew older, those dreams became less frequent until they stopped altogether. That’s because the Bull had rounded up every last unicorn and herded them into the sea.” She was silent for a few seconds before adding, “All but one. And that one is Castiel.”
Dean grabbed Cas’ hand and started walking forward. “Well, we better get going then. If this is the Bull’s tunnel, I don’t want to be here when he wakes up.”
“Alright, Red, take it easy,” Dean said, dragging Charlie off of Cas. “Give Cas some space. He isn’t as fond of all the hugging like you and I are. You’re gonna give the poor guy a heart attack.”
Bobby wiped away the tears that were threatening to fall. “You two idjits deserve each other, and I’m glad that you boys finally got a happy ending.”
The following morning, Eileen showed up at eight o clock sharp. Cas had just finished his first cup of coffee when he answered the door to see her smiling face. He frowned at her. “You are far too cheery this early in the morning. I will need to consume at least one more cup of coffee before I am ready to begin the day.”
Cas easily recalled the age on the driver’s license Charlie had made for him. “Thirty-three but you were very close.”
“These forests had known time, but now so has mine,” he thought. It wouldn’t matter in the end because he would return to his forest, and it would never age again.
Cas broke the kiss and gasped when he felt his hardening cock brush against Dean’s. He bucked his hips, searching for more friction. Dean dropped his head to Cas’ shoulder as they continued to rut against each other. He traced his hand up from Dean’s hip to the buttons on the man’s jeans.
Cas gave him the directions and once Dean confirmed he knew how to get there, he started Baby up and drove out the parking lot and onto the road. They drove in silence for a few minutes, but it was too quiet for Dean and he didn’t want to miss an opportunity to talk to Cas.
“Sweetheart, look at me.” Cas’ voice was soft but left no room for argument. “I will be honest and say I am not as experienced as you. I’ve only had sex a few times before now, but it was just that, sex and nothing more. This between us is more than sex and I intend to make sure you know that. I want to ravish you, but I also want to cherish you and bring you as much pleasure as I am able.”
“That we will,” Meg agreed. For the next few minutes, she performed many of the tricks that she used to entertain the peasants at Rowena’s Midnight Carnival. Meg thought they would be enough to amaze the men, but she was wrong. While they clapped when appropriate, there was no wonder or awe in their eyes. In fact, they seemed downright bored by her parlor tricks. Some were lounging on the logs, their eyes closed and soft snores floating into the air. Meg knew she had lost their attention when one of her tricks failed, and the men clapped just like they had for all the other tricks.
Sam rushed forward and grabbed Cas’ shoulders in his hands. He shook the angel, fury pouring from his very pores. “What the hell does that mean? How do we save my brother?”
“No, don’t,” Dean barked out. He looked at the people gathered around him before focusing back on Sam. “Let me go, Sammy. I’ve tried these past years to move on without Cas, but I can’t. I just miss him too much. So, you guys gotta let me go. You and Eileen, you keep hunting and keep living life to the fullest. Make sure to tell my nephew all about me. And the rest of you guys need to keep living too. I love you guys. Enjoy your free will.”
Cas rolled his eyes as he righted himself, smoothing out the wrinkles to his white dress shirt. “Even after five years that line still makes my heart flutter. I will always fall for you Dean.”
Cas slid his phone back into his pocket with a sigh. He loved living in Montana and was glad his business was already booming, but he missed his older brother terribly. Gabe was the only family he had left and had been his rock ever since Ellie died. Without Gabe, Cas wasn’t sure where he and Jack would be.
“Dean, I know you’ve hid that part of yourself for so long, but nobody is going to care if you started…exploring that part of yourself again. I mean, Charlie is lesbian, and Jo is bi. Garth and Ash are pan. Jody and Donna are married, and Claire and Kaia are together. Ellen, Bobby, and the rest of our friends don’t care. The only person you think badly of… is yourself,” Sam finished softly.
Dean locked eyes with his brother and grinned. “Yeah, Eileen. We’ll be there in about two hours. Can’t wait to see you,” Dean replied before putting Baby in drive and heading home.
“Keep teasing me, and Eileen and I aren’t going to invite you over for Christmas dinner,” Sam threatened.
That night, once everyone had fallen asleep, a lone figure appeared. He was dark as night except for his blue eyes and the silver horn that protruded from his head. As he walked, his hooves made no sound, but Meg woke anyway. She stood to her feet and padded softly to the unicorn.
Cas stood up straighter as he held his hand out to John. “Hello, Mr. Winchester. It’s nice to be formally introduced.”
Dean leaned against the counter, a light chuckle escaping him. “As rowdy and energetic as any small child can be. I love ‘em but glad to be on break and have a few weeks off. How are you and Bess doing?”
“Miracle, Jack, Bones,” Sam called to the other three horses as they trotted towards him, Meg, and Eileen. Charlie, the ginger tabby, appeared out of nowhere, and Eileen gathered her into her arms.
“I apologize. You were right.” Alistair smiled but it didn’t reach his eyes and Dean could tell it was fake. “I came across some unusual tracks in the sand. I want to get a second opinion on them. If you have a moment, could you come look at them?”
Dean reached out and gently grasped Cas’ trembling shoulders. “No more, Cas, no more!” The dream was becoming dark, and Dean no longer wished to know what it was. “Come back to me, Cas, leave that place of shadows and fear.”
“Well, aren’t they? I mean they kill and plunder for fun! If that’s not a monster, I don’t know what is,” Dean growled as he crossed his arms.
All three men nodded as Jack held his hand out and blasted the front doors of the barn. They walked through the clearing dust to see Chuck standing in the middle of the barn, a condescending grin on his face. “Well, look who finally showed up. I guess now I know why I lost track of you two flannel clad idiots.” His gaze travelled to Michael. “You were supposed to be the loyal one, and yet, here you are. My own son is working against me.”
“Dean, I have already told you, it will not bother me. We can clean it up together.” Cas flashed him a reassuring smile.
Cas sat his beer down and tilted his head in confusion. “Yes, there’s a queen-sized bed in, uh, his room, but we figured you would prefer your own mattress.”
“Everything dies,” Cas cried. He leaned his forehead against Dean’s and looked into his eyes. “I want to have a life with you and die when you die. Do not let her turn me back. I don’t want to be a unicorn, to be magical and immortal. I’m human, and I love you.” Cas pressed his lips to Dean’s, pouring all of his emotions into the kiss.
As soon as his eyes shut, memories flooded his mind. They were all of one person: a blue-eyed angel in a trench coat. A sob was torn from Dean’s lips as the last memory he had of Cas floated into his subconscious. He watched as Cas whispered three little words before his entire body was encased in black ooze and disappeared.
Dean’s face turned red, and a blush spread across his cheeks. “Uh, yeah. He’s your son, and I wanted to make sure he thought I was good enough for you.”
Cas looked down, not wanting Dean to see the look in his eye. He knew of course what Dean was talking about. He had to stand by helplessly and watch that argument pan out between the brothers.
Dean tried not to chuckle at how adorable Cas looked all flustered. “Faggot,” a low voice growled in Dean’s mind.
The angel felt Dean’s breath ghost over his lips. Cas’ eyes flicked to Dean’s lips. How easy it would be to close the gap and press his mouth to Dean’s, to finally get what he had been craving for weeks now. He whimpered as he turned his head, his eyes shut to keep the pain hidden. “I can’t, Dean.”
Sam shook his head in disbelief. “Dad was the one who hurt you? Why would he do such a thing? Dean, you had to go to the hospital!” Tears were starting to fall down his cheeks as he spoke in a broken voice.
As they walked, the tunnel sloped uphill, and more light pierced through the blackness. Ahead of them, Dean and Castiel continued to march towards the awaiting disaster. Suddenly, the Bull let out a roar, and the rocks shook beneath their feet.
Dean shrugged. “About an hour ago. Benny told me to see how I feel tomorrow and if I’m hurting too badly to take the day off.”
“Thanks, Kev. Christmas definitely came early for me. I can’t wait to make it Facebook official. Hey, would you mind taking a picture of Cas and me and then one with Jack as well?” Dean asked excitedly.
Cas stroked Dean’s length in time to his thrusts, and Dean broke their kiss to beg, “Please, honeybee, please let me cum.”
Cas threw his head back, moaning as his flesh was kneaded. “Missed this so much Dean. Never thought I’d have this again.”
“I’ll ask her, but I’m sure she will say yes. I’ll give you my number so we can work something out.”
Dean’s lips spread in a small smile. “That’s pretty much what Jack said. Kid’s pretty smart for only being three years old.”
Dean looked over to see what he was drawing and gasped. “Dude, that’s amazing! How the heck can you draw that with just a pencil? Man, my stick figures are pathetic and here you are drawing a rendition of ‘A Starry Night.’”
Eileen chuckled. “You know nothing of unicorns, then. You may be older than me, magician, but you are still naive.”
He turned his attention to his beer bottle, picking at the label nervously. He had spent most of the day thinking about what he was going to do about Cas. He liked Cas… a lot and he wasn’t afraid to admit that. He was just afraid of how people would react about it. He knew Sam was right and that his family and friends wouldn’t care but no matter what, John’s voice always echoed in his head.
Dean walked to the fireplace in the living room and stared at the wall of picture frames. Dean grinned as his eyes flickered between all the images of him, Sam, Eileen, Cas, and Jack. There were quite a lot of pictures of Jody, Donna, and the girls and a few from Dean’s childhood with his mom and dad. Scattered throughout were pictures of Ellen, Jo, Bobby, Charlie, and all the other friends they had lost over the years. There was even one of Benny. Dean sniffled, not even bothering to keep the few tears from falling. “I wish you guys were here.” He wiped his eyes and turned when he heard the sound of the back door shutting.
The unicorn remained silent, but Meg spoke up, “He is the last. He is the last unicorn in the world.”
Dean sat on the loveseat and his boyfriend curled into his lap. He didn’t say anything, wrapping his arms tightly around the still shaking siren. He looked at Sam and raised an eyebrow, the universal sign of “What?”
A shiver traveled the length of Dean’s body. He felt his dick chubbing inside his boxers. He reached a hand behind him to grip at Cas’ thigh. He tilted his head back, baring his throat to his boyfriend. Cas didn’t pass up the opportunity to lick and nip at the exposed skin while one hand wandered down to palm at Dean’s hardening flesh.
Eileen laughed as she laid a hand over Dean’s. “And what about you? What are you going to do with your free will?”
Cas’ thighs were trembling, barely able to hold him up with the pleasure that was swamping his body. He had never felt anything like this, and Dean was only two fingers deep in him. Would he be able to hold out for the man’s cock?
Amara shrugged. “The pay is good and the job easy. How have you been since you left Gadreel and struck out on your own.”
A while later, Meg and Eileen had full bellies and a soft pile of hay for a bed. The only inn in the town had been full, but the owner had been willing to let them sleep in the stable in exchange for Meg entertaining the patrons. He had even let them use the washbasin, and they both felt better, finally able to scrub the dirt and sweat off their bodies. Eileen had softly asked the unicorn if he could freshen their clothes, and he had done so with a simple swipe of his horn.
He answered it without even looking at who was calling. “Hello,” he said, his voice heavy with sleep.
“You had me beat by two types of fish, Dean. I might have grown up in the sea but even I haven’t travelled in all of the world’s oceans.”
Cas shut the book and walked into the kitchen. Dean was staring at the new tiles. “Did I do something wrong?” Cas asked with uncertainty.
Tuesday night, he was a nervous wreck, and nothing was helping to calm him down. He pulled his phone out and pulled up his recorded messages. There was only one person’s voice he wanted to hear at the moment. When he found the message he was looking for, he tapped on the play button.
Dean was staring at his brother, his mouth hanging open and his cheeks a bright red. The bags he had been carrying along with the pillows had been dropped to the floor and Cas was wondering if he was even breathing at this point. Cas walked across the living room slowly, treating Dean as if he were a wild animal that would bolt in a second. “Dean, beloved, uh, Sam arrived early.”
Dean quickly poured coffee, cream, and sugar into the mug and then took a long gulp of the steaming hot liquid. He smiled in contentment as the coffee slid down his throat, the warmth spreading throughout his entire body. He took another sip before grabbing his toast and spreading butter and jelly on it. Dean had his mug in one hand and his plate in the other and walked to the living room. He took a seat in his recliner and turned the TV on for background noise.
Dean broke the kiss to drop his head back with a moan. “Holy shit that feels good! God I’ve missed you Cas.”
The man took a drag from the joint and slowly blew the smoke out of his mouth. “Don’t apologize; it’s a huge boost to my ego to know a man as good looking as you finds me so attractive.”
Dean dropped his eyes. “I don’t know. Sam has you now, and I’m happy for you guys. The two of you can finally settle down and have a life together. But… but that’s not in the cards for me. Cas is gone, and there’s nobody else I’d want to spend the rest of my years with.”
All three men went pale as the words that Bobby said sunk in. Castiel started trembling and Dean wrapped his arm around him and pulled him close into his side. Cas buried his face in the offered shoulder. Sam looked at Mary and Bobby, completely at a loss for words.
Dean set one palm against Cas’ thigh, the other sliding around his neck and pulling him forward to crash their lips together. This new angle prevented Cas from moving as much but it allowed Dean to plant his feet and thrust into Cas’ tight hole. Cas could do nothing but hold onto Dean’s shoulders as the man rutted into him. His cock was trapped between their bodies and the constant friction was shooting lightning through him.
“That’s awesome that I get to be Jack’s teacher! Eileen is such a sweetheart; my brother really lucked out when she was assigned as his soulmate,” Dean replied. “Speaking of Jack, should we go fetch him?”
She leaned down and peppered kisses on his chubby cheeks. “You were my sweet boy. The next day I found out I was going to be a mommy and seven months later, you came into this world. You were the best reward I could have been given.”
The group all took their seats. Cas sat between Dean and  Jo, while Sam and Ellen took a seat opposite them.
Cas returned the smile as he scooped his arms around Dean’s thighs and pulled him closer, pushing his cock deeper into Dean. He leaned over to place a tender kiss to his boyfriend’s lips. “Just lay back and enjoy the ride sweetheart. Let me take care of you for once.”
Eileen chuckled. “And just what will you do to me, great magician? I saw your tricks, and they are nothing to be afraid of.”
Meg rolled her eyes. “Yeah, yeah. You’re not half bad yourself, Winchester. You tell anybody I said that, and I’ll deny it.”
Castiel watched as Meg whispered spell after spell, the skull remaining as silent as him. He had barely spoken a word because he was furious at the magician. Meg was as mad as the king as far as Castiel was concerned. She had told Sam that he was a… a unicorn just minutes after the king had accused him of being the same thing. Why did they believe him to be some mythical creature when he was just a human? A human in love with a prince. He wished Dean was here so that they could go to his room and be with one another. He didn’t care about some riddle that involved a talking skull.
He grew concerned, pulling his arm away from Dean and bringing his knees to his chest. His thoughts were racing as he feared for the worse. He jumped when he felt Dean’s hand on him again.
The Bull turned in his sleep, and the castle shook. Castiel reached out for the railing to support himself while the king laughed mockingly. “The Bull, the Bull is the one you need.”
“STOP! You have nothing to apologize for. What’s done is done. Can’t we just put it behind us? Let’s just focus on right here, right now,” Dean said, looking Cas in the eyes.
“As I said, thank you for all this. I really appreciate it,” Cas said as he put his new documents in his wallet.
“Why have you woken me from my slumber,” a male voice hissed. “Now that the annoying angel is in eternal sleep, I should be too.”
Dean took another sip of his coffee and headed back to the living room. He took a seat in his recliner and set the phone on the table, making sure to put Sam on speaker. “More like boring. I make things interesting.”
“Oh no. That potion will siphon your magic and that magic will wind up back here with me. That is payment enough.”
Before he left, Ellen had told him about a new bookshop that opened up a couple of weeks ago. Dean figured he would check it out, hoping they would have the complete set of Harry Potter books for Charlie. The store was only a five-minute walk away, and despite the cold, Dean figured it wasn’t worth driving Baby such a short distance.
Cas was no longer the blushing virgin and came up with ideas that Dean had never imagined. Dean found he liked it when Cas got bossy and fucked him into the mattress just as much as he loved sliding his cock deep inside Cas’ willing body. Afterwards, they would lay curled in each other’s arms, trading kisses and sweet affections.
Michael gave a solemn nod. “To help the human in the way you’ve asked, you may interact with him, but it will cause you to Fall over the course of the next few months. Once you start Falling, there is no going back Castiel. Are you willing to do that?”
Mary placed a tender kiss to his forehead. “Night my sweet boy. I love you too. Remember, angels are watching over you.”
The two men turned around to see Kevin and his mom standing in front of them. They shared hugs between the four before Dean said, “Yeah, I did. It took me too long but hey, better late than never.”
“Yay, cupcakes, cupcakes,” Jack cried, quickly forgetting about what just happened. “Can you carry me, Papa?”
Cas clapped his hands again as he responded. “That sounds like a good idea.” He grabbed his list and started reading through it, never once looking at Dean.
“If someone only appreciated you for your looks, they wouldn’t deserve you baby. You should be with someone who loves your personality and sees your looks as a bonus,” Dean growled.
A brown-haired woman in a long black dress appeared next to the king. She glanced at the newcomers, and a smile spread across her face at seeing Meg. “Well, it’s been a long time since I’ve seen you, Meg.”
After Jody and Donna, Claire and Kaia were the next ones to hug the newlyweds. “Well, I guess I should tell you guys congrats. Dean, if you hurt Cas, I’ll kick your ass,” Claire warned, sliding her arms around Dean’s shoulders.
I love watching you work on Baby or one of your woodworking projects. Even at such a young age, the passion in your eyes is so visible. I hope you never lose that passion and you follow any and every one of your dreams.
After dinner, they had headed outside so Dean, Jack, and Sam could play in the snow while the rest of the adults relaxed on the porch. They were all amused watching the three build snowmen, make snow angels, and have a snowball fight that Dean and Jack ended up winning. By the time Dean, Cas, and Jack headed home, the little boy was sound asleep, and Cas had finally found a family who loved him.
How amazing is that wonderful artwork! If you like and want to see more, head over to tumblr and follow @notwithd!
What a life it was, filled with all the passion and love the both of them had always dreamed of but never thought they would find. Two lonely souls brought together by chance but stayed together by choice. It was a life neither of them ever regretted.
Meg snatched the bottle from Eileen’s hand. She rubbed at her chin and said. “I guess you’re right. I’ve turned plenty of things into other things.” She circled her hand over the top of the bottle, whispering words while she did so.
“I’m so sorry for how I treated you boys growing up, and I am so proud of everything you’ve accomplished.” His gaze flickered to Cas. “I’m glad you finally found someone to love.”
“Yeah, but why? You said it yourself, I’m doing a lot better. I could understand if it were a week ago, but why not now?” Dean pleaded with the man in front of him.
Cas sighed heavily. “Please Dean, don’t make this harder than what it already is. We both know this isn’t real! You were trapped by a djinn and this world is what your brain made up after being injected with their poison.”
The unicorn stared at the woman in front of him, finally taking in her appearance. The magician looked young, but her eyes told another story. They were cold and wary, having seen great horror and known tremendous loss. “Who are you, magician?”
Jack was silent, thinking hard. “Hmm, what if the people bagged them up and then you paid for the presents? That way, you wouldn’t see them, and when Uncle Gabe comes to visit, he can wrap them for me.”
Jack handed him the phone, and Cas went to his gallery and pulled up the latest picture. His lips curved up as he looked at the family photo they had just taken. “It’s perfect!”
The man shivered but did not wake. Eileen continued to stroke his hair. “You do have magic, but what you have done-”
Thus Dean finally got his happy ending. He spent the rest of eternity in Heaven with the angel he loved. Over the years, he was joined by more and more of his family. Miracle was the first to come along and Cas instantly fell in love with the dog. He had a permanent home with the couple. Then came Jody and Donna, followed a few years later by Eileen. Sadly, Claire and Kaia met an early fate, but Claire didn’t mind. She got to go out in an extremely badass way and was finally able to see her parents again. She and Kaia came over weekly to visit and trade hunting stories.
Garth and Bess had been ecstatic at the news and promised to be there, rain or shine. They had offered to let the boys use an old family farm as the venue. Dean and Cas had politely declined, a venue already in mind. Rowena, who had designed the boy’s tuxes, had also been invited. She insisted that they had to be appropriately dressed for such an occasion. The other guests were some of Cas’ friends: Balthazar, Hannah, and Gabriel. Most of the guests were from Dean’s side of the relationship, and Cas deserved to have a few of his friends in attendance. They had even invited Amara, but she had graciously declined the invitation, saying weddings weren’t really her thing. She did gift them the spot where they would be going for their honeymoon, so Dean and Cas couldn’t be too mad.
The unicorn didn’t feel any better after listening to the magician; in fact, he felt more trapped than ever, knowing the woman wouldn’t be aiding in his escape. He started to pace his cage once more, shuddering as the lock and the bars continued to howl at him. He barely paid any attention to Crowley leading the group to a wagon that contained a chimp but was supposedly the fabled bigfoot that haunted forests.
“I’m glad I was able to assist you. Is there anything else I can do for you?” Cas nuzzled into Dean’s throat.
“I already had the chocolate and lemon cupcakes, so we decorated them while Jack’s cupcakes cooked. I was talking about getting you guys something to celebrate you finding each other, and Jack wanted to get you something as well. He thought cupcakes would be a good gift,” Charlie explained.
The redhead seemed skeptical but did as asked, palpating in the seal’s mouth before letting out a gasp. She pulled back, “She has something embedded in her jaw between her teeth. It feels like an abscess has formed. No wonder she hasn’t been eating. We will need to sedate her so we can figure out what’s stuck in there. Dean, what made you think to check her mouth?”
A smile spread across Dean’s face. “Yes, yes, and I’m pretty sure he would say yes to both of them too.”
They finally pulled apart, wiping at the tears that were drying on their cheeks. “I swear, everyone wants to turn this into a damn chick flick moment,” Dean said.
Dean couldn’t repress the smile that spread across his face. “Thanks Cas. You know, you’re pretty wise for such a young age.”
“Hello Dean. Gabe told me he went to visit you this morning. I’m sorry for telling him about what happened last night. I was confused and hurt and needed to talk to someone. I didn’t imagine he would go to your place,” Cas said in a rush.
Dean glared at his father when he moved towards Castiel. He wanted to protect the man from John’s wrath but knew his father would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. His hand remained on his sword as the king drew closer to Castiel.
It became harder to swim as the water became shallower the closer he got to land. Finally, his tail could propel him no further. He let the human go and dug his fingers into the sand to pull him forward. He had to be entirely out the water before he was able to shift. Once he was completely on land, he allowed the change to overtake him. In seconds, he had two feet instead of a tail. He stood on shaky legs and walked back into the surf to grab the human and pulled him further onto the sand. He knelt and put his ear to the man’s chest listening for a heartbeat. He exhaled the breath he had been holding when he heard the faint beat underneath. He stood before bending over and gathering the shivering man in his arms.
The bell rang. And Cas stood up, packing his food away. He was about to walk to his next class when Dean asked him to wait.
Now that Tim was cornered, Dean was about to go in for another hit but a hand caught his. He looked around to see Cas, looking almost stern with him. Not disappointed, afraid, or angry. Just trying to communicate that Dean made his point and it was over. Cas put a steadying hand on Dean’s chest before stepping over the bench and snatching the amulet from Tim’s hand and helped him up. Cas then turned to Dean and gently put the necklace back around his neck. The action was strangely intimate, like something only they knew the full breadth of, but it was over as quickly as it came. He grabbed his things and herded Dean out the door.
“Hey,” Dean said cautiously. Only now processing that blue eyes was a boy. That made him halt only for a moment. Just cause he was drawn to this guy didn’t mean he was attracted to him. Right?
“Thought you might like another one to add to the mix,” Bobby said with a small smile, nodding to the extremely old one Cas was wearing.
“Our father cared about him. We should care about them too. They are our brothers and sisters.” Michael stated calmly.
“Hey.” Sam was quiet for a while. His presence instantly comforted Dean. He couldn’t protect his best friend, but at least his brother was safe. Safe and well-fed and far away from their dad. No fire was going to get him. He wasn’t gonna go hungry. He wasn’t going to get caught up in whatever bad situation John Winchester gets into. He was right here. That reminder brought Dean comfort.
“I am fine. I just wanted you to know that even after everything, I am happy to see you.” She gave him a soft smile. “If you need anything, please don’t hesitate to ask.” Anna turned and walked away gracefully.
“I guess we should go to bed.” Dean breathed, keeping his eyes closed. He felt Cas nod slightly, but ignored him and started trailing kisses down Dean’s neck and to his collarbone.
“Oh no.” Jody took the bag from Sam “Dean!” She held up a copy of something called Busty Asian Beauties. “Wow. You got him a gift that sexualizes women and Asians. Nice.”
Dean looked at Cassie and it occurred to Cas that he hadn’t even noticed her presence. After noticing her, he became visibly flustered, “Yeah?”
Dean considered for a moment telling Bobby that he was at Anna’s. But he knew Bobby would recognize Anna not only as a girl but as Cas’s sister. And that would just lead to more questions that he didn’t know how to answer.
“Where were you?” Bobby asked when he opened the screen door into the kitchen. It wasn’t in an accusatory voice. Simple curiosity.
Even though he was stoked about getting to hang out with an extremely attractive and smart girl who was actually interested in him, Dean felt overrode with disappointment when he looked around and realized that Cas wasn’t there.
She was staring at him, unapologetically, but patiently. It was a clear act; she wanted to kiss him, but he didn’t half. He could just smile and they could go back and nothing had to change.
At the same time, Dean said single and Cas said double. They exchanged looks. Cas then said single and Dean said double. The man rolled his eyes.
Bobby is quiet for a minute. A deep breath can be heard over the phone as he starts talking. “You can’t ask me to do that John. I’ll do it. Of course, I will. I love those boys and they always have a home with me. But you shouldn’t be asking what I think you’re asking.”
“I let Eldon Styne fuck me.” Cassie finally said after a while. Dean glanced over at her in mild surprise. Cassie shrugged, “I don’t know he seemed nice at the time. And he told me that we were 16 so there was nothing wrong with it.”
“Yep.” Cas smiled at Dean, who looked proud of himself, “Ok, the next few are similar to that one so work on those and if you run into a problem tell me.”
Sam nodded, “That’s actually a great idea! Since it’s so small I’m sure teachers will have time to listen to my ideas. As long as they aren’t too outlandish.”
Hester said it was because he refused to make any attempt to adjust to social norms. He acted as the child of a drunk, suicidal, philosopher. That didn’t sit well with most of the school. He spoke formally, with large vocab words. And often was too blunt, or made comments that were uncomfortable. Hester was in the same class, but she hardly ever did anything about the extreme bullying he faced. But he didn’t blame her. She had her own life to live.
Anna looked to Gabriel for help, “It’s a little more complicated than that, kids. Evil? No. Bad father? Definitely.”
“And kicked him,” Cas muttered returning from the fridge with ice wrapped in a piece of cloth. “Give me your hand.” He pressed the ice to Dean’s hand. Dean rolled his eyes heavily but didn’t put up a fight.
“Did you have a good day?” Dean asked once they were alone. Cas nodded, sensing something was wrong.
Dean shook his head, looking appalled, “I don’t hate here. Not even a bit. I love this house, my room, the garage, you guys. It’s just the school. It’s gonna take a bit of getting used to but I’ll be alright.”
Castiel tried not to be insulted at the comparison. Mostly, he was just curious if his father could really see souls or if he was just crazy. Lucifer said he was crazy and Lucifer was bad. So Chuck must be sane. Castiel made to leave but Chuck called him back.
Bobby and Jody seemed slightly surprised, but smiled and were happy to take him shopping for something to wear.
Dean opened his eyes and looked at his brother, slightly taken aback at how much wisdom and passion were in the kid’s words.
“Well. I don’t know the whole story. But I know you love Cas, we all do. He’s family. And we take care of our family.”
Lisa shrugged, “Only if you want.” Her words gave him a choice, but she didn’t hide in her voice and her eyes that she wanted him to stay with her.
The old-fashioned lock was easy to break. They didn’t run into a problem until they reached the creaky steps.
Dean swallowed and looked away dismissively, “It’s not really my home. I mean I live here but all of the good parts about it. That’s all Bobby and Jody and Sam.”
“I know that I initiated it but I know you and I know that-” Dean’s gaze dropped, “I know I can’t- we wouldn’t be good.” Cas’s heart dropped into his stomach. Was it something wrong with him? All day Dean and his family had done nothing but treat him like family. Maybe that was the problem? Maybe Dean kissed him and realized he thought of him as a brother. Maybe Cas was a horrible kisser.
Cas pulled away from Dean, trying to ignore the level of heartbreak he was feeling. “Ok.” He thought for a moment, basking in the proximity between him and Dean, but trying not to become accustomed to it. “I understand Dean.”
“Look I made Dean and Cas!” Sam said, holding up two men, one with black frosting and the other with yellow frosting hair. And exaggerated blue and green eyes.
“When we’re old enough we’ll leave too,” Cas said. He said it too loudly. At the wrong moment. Michael had found where the group had been hiding.
Gabriel looked down at his feet, “I have to believe some part of him still cares about all those kids. He wouldn’t have wanted this.”
“I can tell him, Anna.” Gabriel interrupted. She nodded, relieved, “He needs to keep the family together. No matter how long Dad stays gone, he stays loyal to every little thing dad ever said, digesting them and exaggerating them and using them as his weapons. And the most important thing… was that we were a family. And that the world was an evil place and that keeping everyone in our little closed-off space was the only way to keep them safe.”
“Hello.” He responded, not looking up from his book, but his eyes weren’t moving so he clearly wasn’t actually reading.
“Was it difficult to get your brothers to let you come?” Dean asked quietly. Cas’s eyes opened and met Dean’s. Cas nodded slightly. It was barely visible but Dean saw, “I’m sorry.” He whispered.
They barely touched during the fast songs, occasionally she’d stumble into him, or more likely he’d nearly topple her. She’d just grab his shoulder and laugh as they both regained balance. When a slow song came on, Dean expected she’d want a break. Her face was flushed and her shoes had been abandoned with their coats. He turned to head back to the table but she grabbed his arm.
It didn’t surprise him, it was pretty clear the night was going that way. But it still sent a shock of warmth through him.
Cas glanced at Dean with uncertainty. Dean cleared his throat, averting his eyes, “Yeah you can- you can stay as long as you like.”
Lisa nodded, “Yeah. I don’t know exactly how many. I wanna say at least ten. They’re not related though. They’re foster siblings.”
“No, it’s ok.” She waved him off before standing up. “The important thing is we get him the hell out of there.”
Dean nodded politely but didn’t internalize the complement. Arguing would just bring himself more attention.
Raphael emerged from the kitchen. “Hester. Please take what’s in the kitchen to your little siblings. Castiel. This is for Father.” Castiel gulped, taking the plate and the glass of water. “Go on.” Raphael turned around before Castiel could respond. Hester gave Cas a sympathetic look before leaving. Chuck had never laid a hand on Castiel. The only ones who ever really had to face his wrath were Lucifer and Gadreel. And even that was a rare occasion. The second-grader opened his father’s bedroom. Quietly walking to the bedside table.
When Jody found out Cas didn’t celebrate Christmas she respected it. When she found out he didn’t celebrate any holidays, she insisted he spend Christmas with them.
“Hello, Anna.” He said, meeting her eyes. The two had a short and extremely strange staring contest.
Jody smiled, “Youngest usually goes first, but Cas since this is your first Christmas, you can open one of yours first.”
“Alternatively,” Anna’s eyes narrowed on Dean, “We can let Cas rot in there until if and when we manage to gain custody of him.”
“No one told?” Cas was mildly suprised. That sort of gossip usually reached newcomers quickly. “My father left us.”
Cas receded into his pillow, “Dean we need to talk about this,” Dean rested their foreheads together, catching his breath.
This prayer was different. This family was not God-fearing, they were God adoring. They put their trust in a greater, indescribable being. That gave them guidance and comfort, but they didn’t expect it to solve their problems for them. They didn’t use it as a weapon or an excuse to be hateful.
Cas shook his head with a shrug, “The animated ones are good, but this is the classic. But never watch the live-action. It gave me nightmares for years.” Sam gave a shudder for effect. Cas appreciated how quickly Sam moved on from his shut-in childhood and didn’t make him feel like even more of an outsider by obsessing over it, as many other children have.
When blue eyes noticed Dean walking towards them, they quickly averted their glance towards their book. Effectively shutting out the world.
Dean buried his face in his arms as he watched their reactions. Quietly, Jody spoke up, “Thank you, Dean.” And in a second Dean was hugging both of them. Sam and Cas both smiled at the three of them and had their moment before Sam joined the group hug.
“CASTIEL!” The two screamed, running through the crops. They could hear a tractor a few leagues ahead and reached it just as they were running out of breath.
Jody nodded looking like she wanted to ask him a question, but refrained, “Alright you guys can go do whatever you guys do.
“I don’t mean defending your honor. I meant do you need a ride home? Or like a drink?” That got a small laugh out of her.
Castiel shared a room with his four older brothers, Gadreel, Joshua, Zachariah, and Ishim. He shared a bathroom with them, and five of his younger siblings, Hael, Samandriel, Duma, Uriel, and Balthazar. And across the hall his sisters, Naomi, Hester, Anael, and Hannah slept. Downstairs his caregivers Michael and Raphael resided. In a house filled with so many children, he was shockingly used to being alone. Castiel was prepared for high school to be more of the same.
Lisa shrugged, “I think their dad was a weird guy. He fudged something to get them all. Different people have different theories… I think he was just cripplingly lonely.” Lisa cut off, staring off into space for a minute. She then shook herself back to reality and looked up at Dean, “Hey, can we not talk about this anymore? I don’t have all the facts and this kinda feels like gossip. You should ask Castiel about this stuff.”
Castiel had no right to feel jealous. He barely spoke to Dean, and Lisa was a wonderful girl. He wouldn’t be going to homecoming anyway. But it caused a strange pit in his stomach when he thought about it. He was fairly aware of his attraction to men, but that was no excuse to be so hung up over one person who was basically a stranger.
“Dean, everyone knows you don’t kick in a school fight. You only kick if it’s life or death. Same with hair pulling bit-”
Two weeks into school, kids had started pairing up for homecoming. Dean hadn’t even been thinking about it when Lisa asked him. She was in his Bio class. She was the type of girl who wasn’t afraid to ask for what she wanted and stand up for herself, but she was still soft and warm. Dean said yes, happily.
“It’s ok, angel. I got you.” He pulled Cas’s head to rest under his chin and felt Cas’s breath on his chest.
“Ok get over here. But we have to keep the volume down.” Dean set up Mario Kart as Sam hopped excitedly over to Dean’s bed.
Dean only nodded and moved into her space, holding her back as she rested her arms around his neck. Slow dancing is barely dancing. Waltzing, sure. But what they were doing, was just hugging while swaying. And Dean was obsessed. Dammit, he really liked this girl.
“What did you just say?” A voice growled from behind them. Anna’s hand protectively clenched around Cas, but couldn’t stop Michael from pulling him from her.
To Cas, the phone symbolized freedom, humanity, inclusion, and individuality. It made him part of the family. All he felt was love.
Dean continued to mutter soothing words. Everything from praise to comfort, dancing around ‘I love you.’ That was hard for him, but Cas seemed to get the message.
“Not tonight. Please-” His voice broke and he inhaled shakily, “Please can we just enjoy this tonight?” Dean opened his eyes and met Cas’s which were hooded, looking up at him. He nodded, lifting his head up to capture Dean’s lips again.
Dean stopped listening, his eyes zeroing in on Cassie, who was once again on the bleachers. She didn’t go every day, but often enough that Dean figured she had a boyfriend that was on the team. She was pretty. Her curly hair framed her face really nicely, and she was thin but didn’t look like she’d get knocked over by a sudden gust of wind. His eyes raked over her shape but then darted away.
“Hey, I like this song.” Dean looked around to see other, mostly older, couples slow dancing. He looked down at her nervously.
“Right back at you.” He said awkwardly. She stifled a laugh into his shoulder. They were silent for a while, sipping punch. Until she sat up and pressed a soft kiss to his cheek.
“Anna?” A small voice came from behind them. Dean and Anna both spun around to find an eight year old boy standing behind them.
“If I don’t give you kids a room, you’re just gonna spend the night on the street aren’t ya?” It was a depressing motel in Salina.
Dean shook his head slightly in amazement. But he didn’t really care. If anything he was relieved. He couldn’t wait to get away from his dad. “Should I get Sammy packing?”
“Family cares about you, not what you can do for them the family's there; for the good, bad, all of it. They got your back, even when it hurts. This,” Dean gestured across the field and towards the house. “This isn’t family, Cas.”
Gabriel left a few months after that. He had applied to a local college without telling Michael or Raphael. And he left, giving Cas and Anna nothing but sad looks.
Cas furrowed his brow, “I wouldn’t know. I’ve lived in the same place my whole life. But you are welcome anyway Dean.”
“That's not my fault!’ Dean yelled back without missing a beat. John looked up at Dean like he had been slapped.
Cas opened his mouth to soothe Dean, also looking for it, but was interrupted, “Looking for this, Winchester?”
Bobby noticed the look on Dean’s face and sighed, “Look, I know it’s not gonna be the same as Cas. But Cas is living his own life, and you gotta respect that.”
It was true. Dean could see that Cas had become much skinnier since they had last seen each other. He was pale and had bruises on his forearms and neck. Dean couldn’t see but could’ve guessed those were all over.
“Cause you’re my baby brother. Also, you don’t need to turn your body that much, it doesn’t actually help you.”
So every Tuesday and Thursday, Dean and Cas would meet at the library after school and study together(Dean had Wrestling the other three days.) Both of them quickly discovered, even though they didn’t tell the other, that those study sessions were the highlight of their weeks.
Cas gave his friend a look, “Dean. There are sixteen people who live in my house. No, we don’t celebrate every individual child’s birthdays. Most of us don’t even know our birthdays.”
“Me!” Dean ran to the table, Sam quickly following. And the five of them decorated candy cane, stocking, little men, and snowflake-shaped sugar cookies.
“You’re wrong Raphael.” Castiel and Anna were both surprised to hear Gabriel defending their father. “He brought us together. All of us.”
“Hopefully you’ll be able to focus on school better and then you can spend more time researching stuff yourself. And you can join some clubs. Even make your own. There are benefits to being in a small school, even if the teachers are weird.” Jody reasoned.
Dean thought for a moment, recalling the names of the boys Sam was playing wall ball with. “Balth and Uriel?”
As it turned out, Cas had never played Mario Kart, which Dean found devastating. The two of them played for a while, and when Sam finished his homework he joined them.
He told Jody and Bobby nothing. He left Sammy a note under his pillow. He wouldn’t see it til he got home from school that day, and it’d be too late by then.
Dean laughed humorlessly, sagging back to his side of the bed. Cas followed him, “Yeah that’s uh- that’s a good point.” So they continued kissing for a few minutes until finally, Cas let up.
“What’s wrong Dean?” Cas had taken notice of his stress. If Dean wasn’t freaking out about the Amulet he’d be freaking out about the fact that cas’ shirt was unbuttoned and there were suddenly miles of incredibly soft skin that Dean hadn’t seen before.
Castiel eyes the tray with an unreadable expression, “No.” Dean didn’t bother trying to continue a conversation. It was obvious Cas wasn’t interested in talking to him. Which was fine. He didn’t need some dude’s attention. Girls were more important anyway.
“Cas seriously I would love to keep doing this but we uh… we’re-” Dean gets momentarily distracted as Cas sucks lightly on Dean’s chest. “Ok wow- no yeah that’s good but we- uh we have to be up kinda early tomorrow.”
Gabriel thought a moment before responding, “We can’t put her in that position. She has a responsibility to law.”
“I-” He thought for a moment as Dean evened his breathing. “I- am sorry that I have… made you feel like… like you…” John couldn’t quite get it out. Communication wasn’t the Winchester way. He looked down at his mug, taking a swig before speaking again, avoiding eye contact. “You’re gonna go stay with Uncle Bobby. You and Sam.”
The first day was uneventful. Except the Dean found himself regretting being right at how much this town’s education system would suck.
“I don’t mean he’s a dick like… Needy annoying controlling paranoid. The way normal dick parents are. I mean he’s… He’s real bad.”
“He’s a boy in my class,” Uriel explained bouncing the rubber ball more. “He and his brother moved here from Lawrence this year.” Castiel nodded watching the car disappear.
In the locker room, Dean noticed his amulet was gone. He swallowed panic as he started rummaging through his things. Once he had flipped his gym bag's contents onto the ground, sorted through them, and still couldn't find it, he freaked. Dean looked around frantically for one of the only things he owned he actually cared about.
Dean processed this for several minutes. Once it sunk in, waves of fear, fury, and despair flooded him. He stood up.
“You’re a guest. Guests sit in the front.” Dean said, waving him off. Castiel nodded and watched Sam run across the lot to their car, waving goodbye to a blonde girl who was playing with the other kids.
“Alright, that’s enough.” Jody held her hand up giving Bobby a look. He shrugged but looked apologetic.
Cas trained his eyes on his youngest siblings, “technically, 19 including myself. But only seventeen live with us.”  Dean’s jaw dropped slightly.
Michael then ate a few bites, and everyone was quiet until he turned to Raphael and the two of them began their own conversation. Everyone else began to chat quietly about their days and minor unimportant things, always careful not to be too loud or disturb Michael and Raphael.
Cas looked at the ceiling thoughtfully, as if considering God, “No. We acknowledge it, but we don’t buy any excess food or gifts. We’re not exactly Christian, we’re like a strange solemn mixture of Judaism Christianity, and Islam. My brothers don’t believe in using a religious day as an excuse to celebrate.”
“Of course not,” Dean said, looking like he didn’t mean it at all. Cas regarded him skeptically but didn’t say anything.
When Cas woke up the bed was cold. Dean didn’t keep a clock in his room so he couldn’t tell the time. Cas stumbled to his feet, the full wave of what happened last night hit him like a tidal wave. Knocking him over engulfing him, filling his lungs until he couldn’t breathe, pumping him with adrenaline. Cas sat down, taking a moment.
“Most of them are all right.” Ishim commented around a piece of toast, “But you gotta watch out for your English teacher. He’s nit-picky.” All of the elder siblings nodded in agreement.
“I’m sorry Dean,” Sam said as his eyes were fluttering shut. Dean didn’t bother to ask what for, they both knew. Sam was safe in his bed, while Dean had to go face their Dad.
“Our Father left us plenty of money. And he never intended us to go to college. We grow our food on the farm. We don't need the rest of the world.”
The next day Chuck was gone. He had left in the night. He didn’t come back the next day or the day after that. The fourth night he was gone, Cas was woken to the sound of breaking glass.
“You’re forgiven.” Michael held his hand out to Raphael and Gadreel. And the fifteen siblings joined hands in prayer. Just as their father taught them. The last thing their father taught them.
Pulling into the familiar house filled Dean with more hatred than fear. Everyone in there was a victim, he had to remember that.
“You and Dean are skipping town. You’ll stay gone for as long as it takes for Gabriel and me to gain custody over you. And,” Anna took a deep breath, “We’re hoping to inherit the house away from Michael. So we can raise the kids there properly.”
Anna regarded him sadly. “What happened to you Castiel?” and with that, she walked away from the Shurley’s for good.
“Guys not tonight I’m tired.” Duma and Samandriel looked sad, but it didn’t work, so they pushed Hael in front of them and she unleashed the puppy eyes.
Sam shook his head, “Aww man. You’re cool. Have fun with your slumber party Dean. Maybe you’ll uh, have a pillow fight in your underwear and bake some cookies.”
Cas met Dean’s eyes for a moment before they were ripped away from him. He and Dean could talk later, right now it was his first Christmas morning.
Naomi stood up instantly when Michael gave her a pleading look. “Anna, would you help me?” She said softly. Anna was assisting Castiel and Hester with their homework. But they had all stopped to observe the affair. She nodded and gave Cas a kiss on the head before following the elder girl.
Castiel didn’t bother to pick out a different book. If they wanted him to read to them, they’d have to read what he was reading.
“Ok. Here’s the plan.” Anna said after school. They were standing in her apartment, she was pacing and Gabriel was slouching, exhausted in a chair. Dean stood, running his hand over his chin patiently.
But the summer had to end. He half expected John to show up and drag them back to their old high school. But no, August came and Bobby enrolled them in the local public schools.
Dean felt awkward asking him, but Cas’s last class was P.E. anyway and he didn’t want to go alone. His only other pseudo friend was Lisa, and he didn’t feel comfortable embarrassing himself in front of her yet.
Anna’s head sunk into her hands, “I- I didn’t want to leave him. I did everything I could to get him to come with me. But Gabe and I had already made plans and he said no. It was a now or never sort of deal. By the time I got out, they put him on 24 7 watch. He was more of a flight risk than I was. I never got an opportunity to get him out. And he hated me so much that past that point he refused to leave.”
“Alright everyone we’re gonna pray,” Jody said, taking Sam and Bobby’s hands. Bobby was holding Jody’s, smiling at her. Dean was holding Bobby’s and made fake gagging noises at the eye sex his surrogate parents were having at the table. Sam took Cas’s hand without a pause. Dean eyed where their hands were resting next to each other at the table.
“Amen,” Jody said at the end of the prayer, and the other four echoed her. Dean opened his eyes and briefly caught Cas looking at him. A faint blush stirred under his skin, but he quickly averted his eyes.
“You wanna dance?” Lisa suggested, putting her cup down on one of the tables, using a sharpie to write her name on it. God, he even liked the way she wrote her name. Block, readable letters. Without any stupid frills or hearts over the I. That was a weird thing to get caught up on because he for some reason found it really attractive. Simply how practical and down to earth she was.
The other boy shook his head, “I mean, I’m pretty good at studying and am in a stable place since everyone's just studying for finals and no one assigning homework.”
“Hey! Cassie are you ok?” He caught up to her, and almost put a hand on her shoulder before retracting it, realizing that was a bad idea.
Cas’s eyes were still on Dean and they made him feel safe and fearless. He propped his head upon his hand and leaned forward a little bit, to where his nose did lightly brush Cas’s.
Downstairs the house was bustling with life. Bobby was watching TV with Sam, Dean and Jody were making plates of something that smelt absolutely wonderful. Light Christmas music was playing in the background.
Chuck grimaced but ignored his son, “Everyone takes each other's hands.” Anna, Joshua, and Gadreel each took one of the babies on their lap and everyone’s hands joined together.
Wrestling was canceled for finals week, so he went to pick Cas up from his last class, and then the two of them got Sammy from school and headed home.
“Anna? Dean? What are you doing here?” He asked, jumping to the ground. They didn’t have an automatic machine that harvested for them, but Cas seemed to be using the tractor to store the beans.
Dean nodded, “Yeah. It was fucking awesome dude. His lips were so soft.” Cas didn’t comment, but he did subconsciously wet his chapped lips.
“We have a plan for them,” Anna reassured, squeezing Cas’s hand. “It’s ok. Please come with us.” Anna pressed their foreheads together, and Dean suddenly felt like he was intruding on a moment. But Cas nodded after a minute, trusting his big sister like he always had.
Cas finally spoke up. “I have to say, Mrs. Mills, I don’t believe in violence,” Dean rolled his eyes, “but that boy was not being very nice. Personally, I think if Dean hadn’t hit him, he would’ve kept increasingly making life miserable. You know kids like that.” Dean was grateful that Cas was defending him, but he was annoyed by how diplomatic this conversation was.
Dean raised his eyebrows as he ripped it apart, “This must've been expensive.” Sam had gifted him an array of seasoning powder. “Taco, Barbeque, Smoked paprika, chili- The list goes on.” Dean was grinning. “Thank you, Sammy.” He pulled his brother into a hug.
“Present time!!!!” Sam yelled jumping around the tree. Cas could count eighteen of them under the tree. Sam had tried to buy presents but quickly realized he didn’t have money. Cas insisted he shouldn’t worry about it, but Jody and Bobby took him to the store to pick something out for Cas and Dean anyway.
“I’ll stay here, you get him,” Anna said, looking around. Dean nodded, carefully walking up the steps. He didn’t bother picking the lock. It was a wooden door. He just kicked it open.
And then with a far calmer voice, he concluded, “So you’re gonna get decent grades. You’re gonna work hard on some teams. You’re gonna be nice to your friend and you’re gonna keep your nose clean. You understand me?”
“And even if I did, we’ve tried for custody. Judges around here like those old-fashioned alpha male types like Michael. And none of the kids will testify against him.”
They only planned on staying like that for a bit, but in the end, they stayed for almost the entirety of practice. When Dean heard people leaving the gym, he roused her and walked her to her car.
The man sighed, “Well I don’t usually take unsupervised minors but I won’t let you sleep out there in the cold and yer paying customers. Just don’t make me regret it.”
Dean and Cas both turned around to see Tim, swinging the amulet on his finger. Dean wasn’t stupid. He knew Tim was fucking with him, but he tried to play nice. “Yeah, that’s it. Thanks, Timmy.” Dean held his hand out for the necklace.
“Hey. Um.” Dean looked towards the ground feeling his face heat up. “Thanks for letting me talk to you. New schools are tough y’know?”
“I don’t-” Dean covered whatever confusing emotion he was having with annoyance, “I don’t want to ruin today for you so just drop it ok?”
“Maybe. But I think it’s more likely that we’re all slaves to someone else's plan.” Castiel didn’t know what to say. So he just stood there until he heard his father’s soft snores. Chuck may eat when he wakes up, but that wasn’t Castiel’s responsibility. So he left as quietly as he could.
“I’ll pick you up after. Make some friends ok?” Sam nodded, smiling. Dean and Sam had two very opposing views on School. The Lawrence Middle school was overrun with kids who couldn’t care less. But Lebanon was somehow even smaller, which meant more individual attention. More uptight teachers and dutiful students. It wasn’t Dean’s vibe. But Sam seemed excited to get all the attention.
“And you left him with them?” Dean glared at Anna. He knew it wasn’t fair to be angry at her. She was a victim too. But he couldn’t help it.
“Sorry for the mess,” Dean mumbled self-consciously,  opening the door for Cas. Cas simply shook his head to mean that he didn’t mind, but was taken aback at how disorderly the house was. And it was perfect. It was the kind of messy where you could tell the inhabitants still knew where everything was. The walls were painted warm brown. It smelled like Beer and Gasoline. There were footprints on the floor and up the stairs. The window was open allowing a soft breeze in, letting the curtains sway ever so slightly. Sam ran off to his room with his backpack, leaving Dean and Cas alone.
But he had the feeling if the lights were on, he would’ve made a joke to relieve whatever tension was existing between them. He would’ve desperately pushed Cas and all feelings he had about him away. So for now, he accepted the dark as a blanket that allowed him to be a little braver than usual.
Anna nodded, “Most kids get the message after the first time. But it never stuck with Castiel. He was locked in there almost constantly.”
Cas shared a bed with his brother, so he didn’t understand why he felt so strange sharing with Dean. Not bad, strange, just strange. But Dean fell asleep quickly and Cas was left to ponder this in silence.
