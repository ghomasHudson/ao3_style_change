Dean, you’re not gonna find anything. Not this time. And I’m— (he pauses, smiling slightly. He looks calm, at peace.) I’m happy. And I can say that now, without fear. I can
A jolt of panic runs through his body and he gets up so fast that he nearly falls out of his chair. “Coming, Uncle!” he calls back, trying to steady his voice.
“Zachariah is
A line from a different world, one with color and light and love… I freeze to the spot, emotions flooding through me. Lisa's exact order, every time. It can’t be her… the world’s still black and white and it’s a male voice but still— I’m not able to move. A small noise escapes me.
I’ve wanted to say it back. For so long, Cas. But I— I didn’t think— I mean, you were an angel, and there was Lisa, then Purgatory, and the Mark, and Chuck, and everything against us— it was never right, and I never thought you felt— (he breaks off, swallowing.) I never thought you could. Love me, I mean.
Yes. I believe so.
“Oh! Jesus. Here, I’ll help you.” Cas grabs a wad of napkins and starts cleaning.
So? Where’s everyone else?
I didn’t wanna die. I didn’t. Promise me you know that.
(disbelieving)
“No shame.” Dean gives her the laptop. “I have worse on my—anyway. You were crying over Harry freakin’ Potter, Sam?”
(starting to panic)
(steadily, without hesitation)
Cas playing catch in the yard with Claire, who is clearly indulging him. His brow furrows as he drops the ball again and again, Dean laughing from the porch.
I don’t say anything. There’s nothing to say but, “I’m sorry.”
Dammit, Cas, let us help you. You saved my skin at the cost of your own for the hundredth time and— and I won’t let you do that.
‘Ha, this’ll get him.’ He thought victoriously.
“Hey Cas, it’s Dean, again.” He grinned softly at his reflection in the water. “‘M sorry I didn’t live my life the way you wanted me to. I was scared, I thought dying would be easier, and I had an easy way out. But I wanted to live, trust me. Cas, I wanted to do this in person but you’ve left me no choice. I love you. I think I always have.”
(Dean is secure enough now to say that he openly sobbed when Charlie wrapped herself around him, whispering reassurances in his ear. God, he missed his best friend.)
“Bobby,” he said, hands raised in a placating manner. “We don’t know how these guys normally act! All this… touchy feely stuff could be normal for him.” Bobby shook his head.
Who was he if not an Angel? Who was he without orders?
“I don’t think I was really ready to face what loving you meant, what my bisexuality meant before you. C’mon, my dad wasn’t the most openhearted soul. If he ever caught Lee and I… I don’t know what he’d do. Then it was like, I was sleeping with guys pretty openly, so I didn’t think I had to explain, but I wasn’t ‘out.’ Then there’s this legitimate angel of the Lord telling me that sexual orientation isn’t going to send a person to Hell and I just… Man you changed my life.”
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Looking back on all those memories, all those times they got close but Dean got scared, or Cas turned evil. He never knew angels could feel that way. Love. What an interesting feeling. Sure, he knew that Cas obviously felt emotions, but love? That was too much for him to hope for, and hope he did.
It wasn’t even physical reminders anymore. It was every time he thought about his past and Cas was there. All of their encounters and conversations he now had to question.
That you put between you and me
Silence.
Dean knew he was dying. He could feel the blood draining out of his body. Maybe if Sam called an ambulance he would be okay, but honestly? Dean was tired. He knew that Cas and Sam would want him to live, and he hated himself for making Cas’s sacrifice pointless. He wanted to live! He had a dog and was looking for jobs! This was supposed to be one of the last jobs they did, not The Last.
Mary blinked. Brother?
“Have you seen Cas yet?” Jack asked once he dislodged himself. “I brought him back as soon as I could!”
About two weeks post-Chuck, Dean finally ventured into Cas’s room, if you could call it that. Basically, it’s where he stored everything he bought while on the road. (The angel loved brochures and anything bee themed. Nerd.)
Cas immediately returned the hug with just as much fervor, burying his nose into the crook of Dean’s neck, savoring the feel of human touch after what felt like centuries of being alone in the empty. Jack, as “human” as he was, or used to be, was never one to initiate hugs the way people did.
“Well…” Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “He hasn’t exactly showed up to see me yet.”
Even his Relationships with a capital “R” seemed to come back to bite him in the ass. Whatever went on with Meg, while it wasn’t a relationship, per se, was still such an awkward position for an Angel of the Lord to be in with a demon. Well, was he an angel at that point? Debatable. But she died because of him, and he felt bad about it. Imagine that! An angel caring about a demon.
“I loved Cassie and Lee and Lisa and Benny but Cas, you are the love of my life. I will never and have never loved anyone the way I love you. I hope you know that. Every time you died it’s like a piece of me was lost until we were reunited. I need you to come back one last time, please. I’m begging here Cas.”
Dean raises his eyebrows at the twenty, huffing incredulously, but says nothing. Castiel pockets the change.
Dean smiles, as big as we’ve ever seen, like a kid on Christmas. Driving down an empty highway, with nothing to do, nowhere to go. His favorite.
Pause. Something catches Dean’s eye. PAN OUT to the road— to the IMPALA, shiny as the day she came off the line.
“I’m so sorry!” she exclaimed, hands flying up to cover her mouth.
She grins. “So you
I love you too, Cas. I always have— you’re family.

kid, awkward and stiff and antisocial.
“You know. It’s the
He presses his lips together. “Bad breakup?”
(gruffly)
Sammy— everything we’ve been through, everything we’ve lost— I’m glad it was with you.
Sam’s complaints fall on deaf ears, and she blithely decides on the most famous fic out there, one that will definitely either traumatize or intrigue Sam. Maybe a bit of both.
“Really?” Dean asks, curious, “What could you have read to make you cry that hard? You were nearly stoic at
Castiel swallows hard and grips his bag a little tighter.
“What?”
The next few days he walks home from practice, bag thumping against his hip as he slowly learns his way around Copper Beach. There are a lot of restaurants, ice-cream shops, and souvenir stands—for the tourists, of course. Castiel isn’t really a tourist, but he’s new, and the novelty of it all both excites and frightens him. Back home, he stayed in his room or ran the same familiar route around the neighborhood when he wasn’t at school. There were family trips to Italy, to France, to Tokyo, but all were strictly regimented and he had to stay with his brothers the whole time. In Castiel’s entire life, any element of freedom had been out of the question.
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
“Dean, you’re my big brother. I remember when we were younger and you had a friend, Lee. You always told me he was more than a best friend, but I never knew what you meant. One day, he stopped coming over and our families stopped going on hunts together. You never talked about him again.” He cleared his throat and looked at Dean, who was already starting to tear up at the thought of his first love.
“Hey,” said Dean, in a wrecked voice. “C’mere, let’s try something.”
“Castiel is an angel,” Castiel said. “Shield of God, it means. My family is religious.”
There was a filthy kiss in which Castiel could taste himself on Dean’s lips, and then in silence they put on their coats and straightened their clothes, not looking at one another. Walking to the door, Castiel pulled it open and turned to find that Dean hadn’t followed. He stood in the alleyway, flicking a lighter as he held a cigarette between his teeth.
“Dean?” he asked, looking up, his mouth hovering at Dean’s waistline.
“Please, let me.” And to make his assertion clearer, he closed the gap between them and waved the money in his hand.
The alleyway was quiet, save the muted sound of city life filtering in through the cracks. The two men in it now understood one another a bit more than before.
“Huh. Mysterious.”
Dean pushed the fabric away once again, this time making a conscious effort not to touch Cas.
And Castiel wanted him, but differently than how he had wanted him before.
Cas stopped to look up at Pamela. He squinted, puzzled.
Dean laughed. “Yeah, name’s Dean. I’m a hooker but I don’t do the name thing. Most John’s don’t give a fuck what my name is anyways.”
“Well,” and there was some hesitancy in Dean’s voice as he said it, “You think we could do somethin’ a little different?”
Maybe this morning, he’d try to make something more than toast.
So Dean took the money, and stared down at it with his brow furrowed. Just as he opened his mouth to say something, Castiel spoke again.
“Oh.” Cas began puzzling out how he’d missed such a significant attribute.
He rubbed his temples, giving the room a once-over. Looking at the angle of the light and the yellowness of the room, he realized it was more than obvious it was no longer early morning, and he wanted to kick himself. They could have been getting home about now.
Angry with himself, with this weakness, Castiel’s feet carried him after Dean, hovering a few paces back as Dean flagged down Roy and got them two more beers. Dean turned then, beers in hand, eyebrows raised and a playful grin lighting up his features. Any fight left in Castiel had been snuffed out minutes ago, quelled by the gentle curve of a collarbone catching the light or perhaps a flit of eyelashes, but Castiel refused to admit it to himself. Dean, with a nod of his head, pointed out an empty booth near where they had been standing. It, too, was in partial shadow.
The kiss was tender and caring, slow but lasting. Cas finally pulled away, shocked.
He pulled out of Dean, who was huffing and sighing, smiling again.
“Serious as a heart attack,” Dean confirmed.
“I-- what?” said Castiel, now feeling acutely wrongfooted, his two interactions of the night so far having been well beyond his ability to comprehend.
“I don’t know what your angle is here.”
” Castiel repeated, more loudly this time.
Dean’s skin was soft below the stubble, and Castiel’s mind wandered from what his lips were doing to his hands, which were passing up and down Dean’s back. On his next pass he brought them down to feel the hardness in Dean’s jeans. Dean made a surprised sound, his hold on Castiel tightening.
Cas shook his head. “I’ll be fine for now, Dean. Go take a shower.”
Dean felt his insides seize up, thrill flooding his senses. Cas had, without warning, resurfaced in his thoughts, and Dean felt himself thicken further in his grasp. Suddenly, he saw Cas, lit from behind as he stood in the doorway, sweatpants riding low on his hips, Dean’s shirt clinging to his wet skin. He saw Cas looking out from the shower, lips parted, his hair dark and wet and his gaze penetrating. Dean picked up his pace, breathing becoming shallow and fast as his other hand strayed, reaching aimlessly for another part of his body to touch. He settled for his chest, running his hand across the tight muscle that laid there.
“‘Cause.”
Dean exclaimed, sitting straight up in bed.
“You have a great ass, you know?” Castiel said to his back.
to look forward to.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mornin’ bud.” Dean answered. “So, you and me, huh?”
There was tension in Dean’s brow as he listened to Castiel.
“I don’t need to be saved, you know,” Dean said bitterly, an old shadow crossing his face. “I don’t want your pity.”
“You’re kidding.” Dean looked up from his burger. “You couldn’t heal your gaping wound, or clean us up, but you could microwave our dinner with your mind.”
He reviewed the brief time they had spent together, trying to understand how it hadn’t seemed to affect how she -- well, how she… functioned. The bartender’s joke came to mind.
“Missouri,” she said. “Oh, there’s no need.”
He did it slowly, so slowly that Castiel suspected it was less to give himself time to adjust and more to wind Castiel up further. If that was Dean’s intent, he’d succeeded-- with Dean taking every inch of his length, simply sitting on his lap, Castiel felt his last vestiges of sense and reality leave him. Castiel was no longer in command, and for the first time in his life he was okay with that. Dean took each of his hands and placed them on his hips, and Castiel opened his eyes to see his own fingers leaving an indent in the flesh there. Above him Dean was smirking, and Castiel made no attempt to wipe away the expression that was prompting it; he just tightened his grip on Dean as Dean began to ride him, hips moving in drawn out sweeping motions, throwing his head back as he used Castiel to pleasure himself. Enthusiastically Dean sank himself down on Castiel’s cock, lifting his hips, almost dismounting him, and slamming himself back down again, all the while stroking his own erection. Castiel was melting into the mattress.
“Yeah,” said Castiel. He didn’t want to talk; his mouth had better things to be doing.
Dean felt the bliss drain away just as quickly as it had come.
Dean felt heat rise in his cheeks. He had the impulse to elbow Castiel in the ribs, but that would just make it worse. The man behind the counter squinted at them.
Get over here! Kid wants a drink!”
“What’s the time?”
“You know,” said Dean, leaning closer to Castiel, “I came here for a drink too, though I’m not against getting something a little bit more.”
Times square, seedy and squalid in daylight, seemed to have been set on fire by the night. It glittered with neon signs and flashing letters that cast a red halo over bustling midnight crowds. But this was no fifth avenue. While the darkness disguised rundown buildings and general disrepair, it had since ushered out of hiding the various outcasts and nightcrawlers, who now ran about freely like wildlife in a bizarre, vulgar parade. The lights spelled out “
“Alright. Have a good night,” Castiel said. “ And thank you,” he added to Pamela, not entirely sure which kindness he was thanking her for. All of them, perhaps.
“That sounds wonderful.”
“Because he’s working,” Castiel supplied, rather stiffly. “I don’t understand.”
“Well-played, smartass,” Dean conceded. “Why don’t you magic us clean, and we can get a head-start home.”
he finished, in his mind.
“Ow,” Castiel grumbled. Dean just laughed.
“Yeah, yeah, I know, not the best example,” said Dean, gesturing to himself. “But do as I say, not as I do. Eat something. I’ll bandage you up once we finish.”
appreciated, so if you liked it, hit that button, baby. And if you didn't, let me know --- I'm always looking for ways to improve my work. Suggestions are not only accepted, but encouraged. Comment them and I'll do my best to incorporate them!
“I have an apartment west of here. It’s warm, safe. You can sleep the night there.”
it flew open to reveal a dark, empty apartment.
This, right here, was a big no-no and Dean knew it. He never had and never would actually feel this way about another man, because it was all in his head, or a moment of weakness, or the beer and the blood loss, or something like that. Dean just didn’t have the equipment to experience the things he was experiencing, and so therefore there must be another explanation ---  and in the meantime, all he needed to do was let go of Cas, toss him his shirt, and turn in for the night.
Castiel responded with a half shocked, half inquisitive stare, and once more, the man’s confidence faltered. He turned, presumably to hide the flush in his cheeks, and sauntered towards the bar. In a daze, Castiel watched his figure retreat, slim hips that swayed ever so slightly with his bowed legs. A flash of curiosity, of what those legs would look like straddling him, before he shook his head of the thought and felt a shiver of fear mingled with want trickle down his spine.
Pamela laughed: a deep, hearty laugh that creased her cheeks and rolled her shoulders. It wasn’t an unkind laugh, quite the opposite-- it was friendly amusement, simple and pure.
Dean had shifted up onto his elbows, and he was frowning at Castiel.
Could a person who drips with purity and kindness and strength really see past his flaws, and wait this long for him to come to himself? Peer into his soul and still find him worthy of such a deep, abiding … was it …
“I’m all good. Lord knows this ain’t my first rodeo,” said Dean with a shrug, but his smile faded at the look on Castiel’s face. “Forget I said that,” he whispered. “I’m askin’ for this, Cas. I want you. Want you inside of me. All you gotta do is let me.”
“I’ve got a roommate,” he said, deciding to give Dean warning, “but he’s probably not here right now. He goes to parties, and other things.”
“You and me.” Cas agreed.
Tentatively, Cas reached for the hem of his shirt, and lifted it partway up his ribcage. Dean gritted his teeth at the sight of his friend’s wound --- an angry gash cutting alarmingly deep into Cas’s side.
Dean sighed.
After pulling in, he and Cas crossed the parking lot into the lobby. Well, it wasn’t much of a lobby - it was about the size of a small bedroom, smelling of mildew and colored a shade of puce that Dean wasn’t sure was from the paint or layered dirt and stains.
Responding to the sudden vulnerability, Castiel rose and laid down by Dean’s side. He’d tucked his erection back in his boxers.
“Huh.” Dean traced the opening of the bottle with a finger. Castiel followed it. “Some name.”
Cas wasn’t amused.
The bartender --
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Yeah whatever, wise-guy. Now fire away.”
“No,” he said, his laugh fading into something more serious. “I’m a prostitute.”
“Takin’ good care of me, aren’t you,” Dean said weakly. “Why don’t you let me give a little back, huh?”
With that he tipped back one of the shot glasses that had been set in front of him, and did his best to suppress the grimace the bitter liquid inspired.
Dean had to get himself out of here,  he’d let this go on too long. They’d crossed the boundary between friend-to-friend intimacy and entered something more objectionable long before Cas had lost the shirt, and they were quickly approaching a level of closeness Dean wasn’t sure his brain was prepared for.
Castiel had been accused of many things, but never of having an overactive imagination.
A beat. They looked at one another, both a bit defiant, but with an unspoken confidence in the other.
Dean spoke up. “Long story. You got a room?”
“Hmm.” Dean answered, distracted his friend’s injury. Hesitantly, Dean pushed some of the fabric of Cas’s shirt away, finger tracing along the angel’s skin, which was pleasantly warm. Cas tensed at his touch, and Dean quickly pulled his hand away.
“Yeah, but, why? Is it an angel thing?”
“Just grabbing something,” Castiel responded, walking to his nightstand.
“Goodnight, Castiel,” her voice called behind him.
“Ass.” He said under his breath.
“Changed my mind.”
Dean looked positively mortified. “No, that’s-- last weekend wasn’t, wasn’t like that.” He took a step back, eyes still on the money, not seeming to want to look at Castiel’s face. “That was for fun. A good time.”
opposed to the prospect, making the situation all the more dangerous for him.
“Uh,” said Dean.
“And you smell wonderful, Dean.” Cas said, taking no trouble to disguise his sarcasm.
“What do you want?”
Carried on the coaxing perfume of red wine and in the inviting warmth of his guest, Castiel found himself speaking of his own life as well. He told Dean how he wanted to heal people, and how lucky he’d been that his dream lined up with his family’s expectations; but that he would have chased that future with or without their approval, because it is all he’d ever imagined himself doing. It was how he could help. He talked about living with Balthazar, someone with whom he couldn’t be any less alike and yet got along with wonderfully, and how classes were dull and his parents cold. Dean listened and laughed when Castiel told him about what Meg had once convinced him to do at a party, smiling with understanding when Castiel confessed his and Meg’s friendship to be a complicated one.
“No. I don’t. And I don’t appreciate you imply that I’m -- that I’d--”
“Will you let me?” he asked, in a whisper.
Shit.
Dean unwrapped his own burger, mouth watering at the sight of nearly an inch of bacon piled on top of the meat, which oozed melted cheese. He sunk in his teeth, pleasantly surprised to find it tasted just off the grill.
“You got the bed. I have blankets in the trunk, I’ll sleep on the floor.” Dean said, nodding at the carpeted space between the bed and couch.
Cas is practically family. And still,
Hours passed by uncommented upon, and above them the few stars bright enough to show through the city’s haze glittered like sparsely scattered diamonds. Neither said anything about parting. It was something like holding his breath, waiting for Dean to end their time together. If Dean were to dismiss him, Castiel could yet again quiet the want within him and choose to be content with what he’d gotten; but Dean said nothing, and soon the night became too heavy for either to speak. They walked on without destination, shoulders brushing every now and then, stealing glances at one another. And like the rising tide, or an earthquake shaking his foundations, Castiel felt the desire glow bright within him again-- like it had that evening in the park, like it had the night they had said goodbye at a bus stop. He wanted to kiss Dean. He felt the need ensnare his mind like hunger, like thirst, and he wanted Dean so badly it seemed to press upon his lungs.
Shrugging his way past a few drunk couples, Castiel squeezed through a tightly-packed group before taking an open seat at the bar. His stool felt less than reliable, so Castiel planted a foot firmly on the bar’s base molding and hoped it would keep him steady. He stuck out like a sore thumb in
“Have you … finished?”
not that watered-down 7-Eleven bullshit!”
name.”
The stranger took a few more steps back, deeper into shadow, and Castiel found himself following.
Phonetics: Ra i ta a    kua a ay el
“Stop worrying about me,” Dean continued.
“Sure,” Dean’s voice came from somewhere to his right.
“This is good,” he remarked, to no one in particular.
“The hell did you do that for?” Dean hissed, furiously.
“Not yet, please,” Castiel  implored, looking intently up at Dean. Dean licked his lips.
Cas blinked, taking a moment to register what Dean had said.
“You’re blind,” Castiel added, stupidly.
Just a second or so later, the bar door swung open. A full-figured black woman stepped in, draped in blue-purple fabrics and scarves, her neck, ears and wrists adorned with pendant jewelry. She walked with confidence towards the bar, and the crowd seemed to part to clear her path. It was no surprise to Castiel when she walked their way, as Castiel had already pegged her as the friend Pamela was waiting on. Strange characters usually came in pairs.
Castiel glanced to the window, confused. The bar’s windows were grimy, but he could see through them just fine; and if Pamela were to turn her head thirty degrees to her right, she’d be looking directly through one.
“Dean Winchester,” said Dean unexpectedly. “That’s my full name. Dean Winchester.”
He watched Missouri, not certain enough of himself to brush past without waiting for her reaction.
“Hmm,” Castiel answered. “I’ll open a tab, then.”
Dean threw his head back, letting the water hit his face, eyes closed. He slid his hands through his hair, and let them fall back down to his body. Dean’s fingertips met the center of his abdomen, and felt the familiar wave of sensation move across his skin. He traced his fingers down his middle, which pooled with yet more heat as his erection grew, and finally, his hand made contact with himself, causing Dean to inhale sharply. Slowly, Dean took his half-hard cock into his hand, stroking the length of it with the pad of his thumb, sending sparks through his body as he gently eased himself through the process, building up the intensity of his strokes as his shaft thickened rapidly. Soon, the rest of his hand moved in tandem with his thumb, establishing a steady rhythm Dean had perfected over years of practice. Thank God for masturbation - he would have gone crazy a long time ago if he didn’t have
Although, Dean hadn’t quite gotten used to his emotional advancements; namely, his new-found affinity for sarcasm, and wider range of moods. He
“What?” Cas defended, growing more exasperated.
He  wanted to ask how it was she knew that that was why he’d come, but to address that was to call more attention to it.
Cas looked uncertainly at Dean before grabbing the hem of his t-shirt and lifting it up. He raised his arms, shimmying his shoulders as the fabric worked its way up and off of his body, the muscles in his torso flexing as the shirt finally came over his head. This entire time, Cas has kept his eyes locked on Dean, innocent blue piercing his vivid green. Dean swallowed heavily as he studied his friend’s every move, watching as his eyes flicked away to toss the tee to the side before looking back at him, drawing Dean’s gaze back up and away from the surplus of warm olive-colored skin.
Cas let out an audible puff of air, as if he’d been holding his breath. Dean didn’t know angels did that.
he doing?
“Hey! What gives?” said Dean, indignantly.
“Fair enough.” Dean said, shrugging. “I’ll grab the whiskey, okay?”
“And don’t think I can’t feel you boring your eyes through the back of my head, neither,” she added, smiling.
The stranger laughed. A brief, huffy sort of laugh, but a laugh all the same.
Dean sucked a mark onto Castiel’s neck, and at the same time, brought a hand around to Castiel’s front, fondling the now painful erection in Castiel’s pants. He gasped in surprise.
“Hey, there’s a motel a minute off. Let’s wait, so we can enjoy it,” he said, surprising himself with his restraint.
Dean nodded, and swallowed. Castiel bit his lip.
“No, no,” she said. “Just an innocent question.”
“Nice meeting you,” Castiel said to Missouri, before being pulled into an unexpected hug. She released him after a moment, leaving a trace of earthy incense.
Castiel turned slowly, his head in the lead. He spotted the young man before having turned completely to face him. The stranger had never looked away.
“ ‘The
“Now, lift up your shirt.”
“I owe you,” Castiel answered, simply.
Weird name. You French or something?” Before Castiel had a chance to answer, Pamela went on.
“Hmm.”
“Yes,” said Castiel, again.
Just then they were walking along closed shop fronts, street lamps lighting their way. They hadn’t made any plans for that night, and had spent it wandering Morningside Heights, talking to one another. Castiel couldn’t ever remember talking so much in his life, but beside him Dean was listening interestedly and Castiel found himself telling old stories about his brothers, explaining what an echocardiogram was, complaining about the time he’d walked in on Balthazar and three other people in their living room.
“What?”
“Not the point,” Dean huffed. He then spotting the so-called ‘sofa’ shoved against the back wall of the room - it was barely a loveseat, colored an awful shade of orange and entirely threadbare, stuffing poking out of one of the armrests. “And, you are not sleeping on that,” he added.
Dean turned the knob and stepped in, met by a stifling cloud of humidity.
Thanks for reading! I will do my best to upload a chapter every week, so stay tuned. And if I take too long, feel free to yell at me. :)
I want to say another thank you to all of the people who cheered me on as I worked on completing this fic! It's the longest thing I've written to date, as well as the first bang I've ever participated in, and I couldn't have done it without the unwavering support of my friends. I hope you've enjoyed this story! Please leave a comment with your thoughts, I'd love to hear from my readers :)
about with whom they lay, so it can and does serve as a way in which souls connect to one another, even beyond the institute of holy matrimony.” Cas clasped his hands, and his voice grew more thoughtful. “Although, I have never factored grace into the equation. Whether any of the soul I possessed as a human still remains, I can’t be sure; but you know well as I that souls are one of the most powerful and valued commodities in the Universe, carrying immense potential, and existing independently of another guiding force. Grace, on the other hand, is a separate entity --- while a soul creates energy, grace conducts and retains it --- so its level of function depends on how much energy is allocated to it by heaven. The more I separate from heaven, the less power I receive and the more quickly it depletes. Therefore, it is uncertain how it would be affected by sex.”
“C’mon, man, it’s nothin’ personal.” Dean shoved the keys in the ignition.  “Just looking out for my baby.”
The only sound once they reached it was their own breathing. Above them, the hall light buzzed as Castiel unlocked the door and shoved it open in one smooth movement. And to Castiel’s complete surprise, sitting in his chair with his book and most definitely not out clubbing, was Balthazar. Balthazar glanced up from the page as the door creaked open, eyebrows raising at the sight of the two men silhouetted in the doorway. Seconds passed by as silently, they stared at one another, until, with decided nonchalance, Balthazar looked back down at the book, shifted comfortably in his seat, and went on reading.
And just as cockroaches roam freely in the dark, so did the people -- and
“You know what, Cas? You aren’t very funny.”
“It’s alright, Dean,” Cas murmured, head hung, neck craning to get a better look at his side. “Like I said, it’ll be healed tomorrow morning.”
Dean muttered, wrinkling his nose.
“Why me?” He asked Dean, hoping Dean would understand his meaning.
“But---” Cas continued, and Dean turned his head. “I truly do believe it was due to our activities --- er --- intimacy.”
“In so many words, yes.” Cas confirmed.
With that, Cas twisted his wrist lazily. Dean felt a tingling sensation run the length of his middle, and he was suddenly splatter-free.
Dean smiled, ripping open a bandage.
“Well, could you, maybe, come and stay with me?” he said, so shyly he was nearly mumbling.
Castiel didn't reply. Instead, he watched Dean take another sip from his drink, clearly putting on a show for Castiel’s benefit. Automatically, Castiel pulled his beer towards him, readjusting his grip on the body of the bottle, fingers feeling the shape as Dean gave a satisfied sigh upon swallowing. Without thought, Cas took a swig of his own beer, and his chest burned as he set it back down, watching Dean run a finger over his lip, where some moisture still clung.
“No, I don’t know man, you just use my name more than the average guy does in an average conversation.” Dean replied,feeling increasingly uncomfortable.
It was everything, Castiel thought privately. It had meant everything.
“So when he--” Castiel blurted, referencing Roy’s jab about ‘drinking yourself blind.’
“Dear god, Cas,” said Dean, “you can keep the smelly thing, just not in the front seat.”
of awkward. They were in a quiet, dimly-lit motel room, inches apart with no Sam to diffuse the tension. Not to mention, Cas had overheard him doing the five knuckle shuffle. Ugh.
“Thank you.”
It was then that the voice popped into his head. The voice was very familiar, as it was the same one that always managed to keep Dean from doing the things he tried so hard not to do --- such as openly enjoy chick flicks, talk about his feelings, ect. And thank God, too, because Dean was losing his damn mind.
BOBBY
He spins, almost losing his balance. “Yes,” he stammers. “Castiel.”
I smile ironically. “You could say that.”

“Shut up. I’m miserable.”
They’re brand-new Nikes, clean and sleek. In comparison, Dean’s shoes are scuffed, worn, generic store-brand. Castiel’s stomach churns uncomfortably, aware of something off-balance, unfair.
Charlie can’t help but groan, and even when Sam shoots her a warning look, she decides to barrel on.
“Lisa?” I opened the door, panic thrumming through me and making me lightheaded as my heart pumped, pumped, pumped…
, and this time Dean isn’t having it. He pushes ahead of Castiel, shooting him a stony glare. Castiel shakes his head, sweat dripping into his eyes, and runs harder, elbow brushing Dean’s bare back. They run like a pair of wild horses straining at the bit, feet pounding the cracked pavement. The sun beats down on their shoulders.
“A pack—a pack of gum,” Castiel stammers, inching closer to the register. “I need one.”
“So…Cas. What’s your favorite color?” Then I almost bang my head against the table.
She grinned, she couldn’t seem to stop doing it and I couldn’t stop staring at the dimple that creased her cheek.
“It’s, ah… you know how Chuck wrote those books about us?”
We sit there for a moment.
“Uh, some people in the fandom think you and Dean should, um, be, you know, together. In a romantic way.”
A week into cross-country practice, Castiel snaps.
“So… what’s your name?”
Sam laughs, feeling a little better by the appearance of actual Cas.
It seems like a cruel joke at this point. Names, peppermint tea and sitting in a shop… is this really happening?
Sam takes one look at him and starts to sob.
With a WIDE SHOT, we see that Dean is making eggs this time, with less spirit than the last morning. He slices peppers and onions with precision, but we can tell that he is worried, his brow furrowing as he sprinkles them in the pan.
, Castiel thinks resignedly, constantly pushing himself past Dean at practice so they don’t match pace.
He leaves, and Charlie and Sam grin happily at each other.
Cas and Dean washing dishes together, bumping shoulders and hands, smiling.
So, are you… human now? For real this time?
“Not the point! Anyway, lemme see.” Dean attempts to grab the computer from Sam, but Sam quickly closes the tab and deletes the history before Dean successfully wrests it from his grasp.
“What happened? If you don’t mind me asking.”
“Sam, man, what’s wrong with you? You cursed, or something? Damn witches again,” he mutters, setting down his coffee. “We’ll fix it.”
“Oh, God. You have got to be freaking KIDDING me."
An older Dean finally perfecting his pie recipe, passing the plate around the dinner table, looking pleased with himself. Contented.
Castiel looks up from his shoes to see Dean Winchester, head out the window of a beat-up red truck.
Miss me?
Cas doesn’t say anything, and Charlie peeks up at him, suddenly remembering how powerful he actually is.
(muttering sarcastically, as usual)
The color of Lisa's eyes.
“What the-”
Sam decides he doesn’t want to know. “Your point?”
Dean’s expression is so bewildered that Charlie has to laugh.
Around the circle they go. Castiel can barely keep up with all the names—most are easy, like Gordon, Sam, and Jo—but there’s just so
Castiel offers a hand, and Dean takes it, hopping on his left foot to stand.
“…Peppermint tea please, honey would be great, thank you.”
, he says to himself, and gets out of the car.
(gearing himself up to be angry, to find a solution)
Sam nods. He can’t speak. He wishes— he prays— but no one comes. Dean’s head goes slack in Sam’s hand. His eyes are empty. He’s dead. The camera PANS slowly to Sam’s stunned face.
Cas says nothing, but laces his fingers with Dean’s. Dean looks down, stunned, then back up at Castiel’s face.
Dean is there, messing around with his friends: a guy with brown skin and a nice smile (Castiel thinks his name was Victor), a skinny blonde girl (Jo?), and a beanpole with messy hair who Dean can’t stop elbowing in the ribs. The beanpole says something and they all fall over themselves laughing.
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
2. Claire + Jody
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Looking across the table during a game night he thought about his future, not for the first time. He didn’t want to be known as a soldier or a warrior. He didn’t want to be that anymore. There was finally something other than what he had known all of his billions of years alive. Freedom. Free will to do whatever pleased him.
Right down the rabbit hole
“You could say that again.” Cas narrowed his eyes slightly.
But was he just a friend? Cas didn’t think so. He fell for Dean in every single meaning of the word. And he would do it over and over again if it meant he could stay with him, in whatever capacity Dean allowed. If he could share some of his burden, even just for a moment.
“I’m not saying anything you two haven’t already told each other, but I am so proud of you, both of you. We beat Chuck and finally, finally get to make our own story, and you chose each other. Not violence or hunting, but love. I love you both and I can’t wait to be there to witness the rest of your lives together.”
I'd think you were still around
As horrible as it sounds, Cas tried to get a glimpse of the person that held so much of Dean’s attention, but all he could make out was a weirdly shaped hat. Similar to the one he was forced to wear on a hunt.
Dean’s breath stuttered, and he blinked rapidly at Cas before smothering his shock with a grin.
It didn’t matter to Cas if his plans were ruined, as long as Dean was still there, still talking to him.
“I’d rather have you” and "I knew you'd come back," what did that mean? Was it purely platonic, something you tell your best friend? Or did it mean more? Cas would never figure this man out.
Cas smiled and squeezed their conjoined hands. “I know, Dean.”
“So…” Mary started, sitting on the edge of Sam’s bed. Her son. Her adult son who was an infant when she died. Because she died and now she’s alive again because of something God’s sister did for Dean. What the hell.
If someone told twenty year old Dean Winchester, still going on hunts and following his father’s every order, that a little over a decade later he would find someone that would understand him, and stick with him. Through the good and bad, as long as he lived. And that this person would be not just an angel, but a man.
Dean's smile widened, brightening the room around him.
“Sam, are they not…” She trailed off, lost in thought. Sam squeezed the hand he was still holding to get her attention. She glanced up at him, still confused.
Hopefully, he would forget all about Castiel, all the pain he’s caused, just move on. Cas would become another person he lost, but with time he’d slowly forget about him and find someone that made him happy. Something Cas could never do.
Evermore
“You have done everything, and I mean everything for me. Never once thinking about yourself. It wasn’t until Cas showed up in that barn and forced you to accept yourself... and I am so grateful for him for doing that. Cas, you changed my brother. Sometimes I don’t even recognize him, in a good way of course.” He chuckled awkwardly and looked down at his hands clutching the thin stem of a champagne glass.
This pain wouldn't be for
Then Cas came into the picture. And fuck, what a picture he was. In all of his forty plus years, Dean had never met anyone who knew him that completely. Cas remade him, atom by atom. His fears, desires, memories-- Cas knew it all, and that was terrifying.
Ah yes, who could forget about the Djinn Queen! Nearly everyone, apparently. And for good reason.
“There’s a lot I’ve missed, huh.” She held her hand out for Sam to take, one thing that felt familiar, safe. They sat like that for a moment, mother and son, trying to get to know each other with a completely different dynamic, before Mary exhaled quickly.
In a faith forgotten land
All your closets of backlogged dreams
I should've asked you how to be
Takes one to know one
Nothing.
“Well,” Mary laughed a little, embarrassed. “I thought he and Dean were… you know.”
Cas helped. CAS HELPED? So Cas was alive. Great cool awesome, Dean was not at all freaking out about seeing the man he recently realized he was in love with, and who loved him back.
“I- You mean like....”
“Uh, yeah? What else would he be?”
His actions were childish and pathetic, Castiel knew. Confessing his love to Dean, his best friend, only when there was no chance for Dean to even process his words? Cas took the cowards way out, but he couldn’t bear to be there, listening to Dean let him down gently. Or rudely. Honestly he didn’t know what to expect.
made me watch them.”
“Unless it wasn’t a romantic confession?” Nada. “C’mon man, give me something!” Dean pressed the heels of his palms tightly against his eyes, relishing in the dull pain it brought.
But the look on his face when Cas said it was goodbye… That was enough to make a man change his mind, but it was too late for that. Before he could even think, the Empty was there, and he was gripping Dean’s shoulder, the place he first touched him all those years ago, shoving him across the floor.
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
He didn’t know what that was like, not until Dean.
But this time...
But nevertheless, it was too late to fix his mistake. From the moment he saw Dean in that barn he knew his life would never be the same. Castiel almost relished the look in Dean’s eyes when the demon blade didn’t affect the angel.
I know better
Pushed from the precipice
Dean was probably the only being in creation that could have gotten Cas to stop once he got started. Both so stubborn, but Cas would do anything for his human, so Dean would ultimately win.
Actually
Sitting at the edge of the dock, pants rolled up with socks and boots next to him, he began to pray. Again.
“I mean- Dean, he died for you! Again!” Sam roughly ran a hand through his hair. “And you’re not talking, you’re just drinking and it’s not healthy. I think you should talk to someone.”
Not even just the existence of angels and God, it was the way Cas changed him for the better. They changed together, they grew to want more out of life. Dean wanted to live for the first time in well, ever.
But Dean, Dean was beautiful. He always had been. Even covered in blood or sweat or tears, as a demon, dead, in purgatory. It didn’t matter. It never mattered to Cas. Still beautiful, still Dean Winchester.
“Another Easter egg from Jack I suppose.” It was almost like having Cas there. Almost.
Softly, Dean tilted his chin to brush his lips against Cas’s, before pulling away for good.
Still nothing.
‘God,’ Cas thought, ‘The look on his face when I said it was goodbye.’ Heart wrenching. If he traveled back in time, just fifteen years ago, and told his past self that he would sacrifice himself to the Empty to save Dean Winchester, Castiel, Angel of the Lord, would have stabbed him without so much as a second glance.
“I know you’re alive, Bobby told me. I can feel that you’re alive, I’m not sure how but I know you can hear me you son of a bitch!” He straightened up and slammed his left fist down on the door handle. “Whatever.”
Yeah right. “Exactly, Sammy. I’ve- we’ve lost Cas before. “He corrected himself quickly, but his slip-up didn’t escape Sam’s notice. “I coped fine every other time, right?”
“Brother?” She asked out loud. Sam squinted, eyebrows twitching a little.
He drifted a bit, the last thing he heard was Sam telling him that everything would be okay. His little brother had to reassure him that he was okay, everything was okay. He needed that, to hear that Sam would be alright, that Dean himself would be alright.
It was when she learned that Cas was dead that Claire prayed. She prayed to him to come back, because he was the closest thing she had to a father. Even if he was still wearing Jimmy’s face, she had grown to love the trenchcoat wearing angel.
Wherever you stray, I follow
Rummaging through the drawers (what an invasion of privacy, he thought briefly.) Dean found the mixtape, “Dean's top 13 Led Zepp Traxx,” placed carefully and deliberately in the middle drawer of a dusty nightstand. The mixtape, in contrast, was clean as a whistle.
And Jack, obviously.
“Do you think he loved Cas back?”
“I’ll go with you Dean.”
He wasn’t even allowed into Heaven without a chaperone. Was even kicked out of the Bunker. 'Dean had a decent reason,' he supposed.
“Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for love.”
Bobby Singer was a very intuitive person. He trusted his gut, and was almost always right, so when he got a feeling about that damn angel…
Castiel’s first mission down to Earth in years was rescuing Dean Winchester from Hell. A seemingly insignificant hunter, Castiel wondered what was so special about this man, why was he traveling to Hell, risking demons and ghosts to find one single human soul in an ocean of them. But Castiel was first and foremost a soldier. He followed his orders and found his human. Interesting.
It’s not to say he didn’t like Cas, nah he liked him as much as one can like a celestial being they didn’t know existed, who then knocked them out during their first encounter. He liked the guy. Trusted him, even. Trusted him to protect the boys.
He spent so long trying to understand how his human differed from the others. What made him special? His upbringing? His very soul? Was it God's doing? Soon enough it didn’t matter. Dean was the only human he knew that would willingly do half of what he had done. Save the world, not once, not twice, fuck even Cas has lost count. This human, who took on the Mark of Cain because it was the only way to defeat the big bad, knowing full well what it would do to him.
“I’m not really one to sugarcoat things.” He deadpanned while Dean laughed. “Anyway, I want you to know how loved you are.” Dean sobered up and reached out his hand for Cas to hold.
I guess I should'a known from the look on your face
“Of course I will Dean,” The angel said seriously, despite his joy. “I have loved you with my entire being for as long as I’ve known you. I’m not really one to sugarcoat things…” Dean cut him off with a small scoff.
He had a soft spot for his family of course, the people he had saved over the years, those who helped raise and care for him. Bobby, Ellen and Jo, Hell, even John on a good day.
Taking very timid, careful steps, Sam walked over to his brother and slid down the wall next to him, Jack did the same on the other side.
But you're still around
Dean was better off without him. Cas told him to live, and he knew he would follow his instructions. Maybe he’d meet another Lisa, have a few kids and work a normal, nine to five job until he passed away in his sleep.
That turned out to be false. Dean Winchester was one of a kind, and deep in Castiel’s very being, he knew that. As much as he pretended to be unaffected, continuing his work, he knew.
Ellen and Jo were another story entirely. Ellen yelled at him for dying so young, and Jo made fun of him for being old. Their hugs lasted years.
With both metaphorical and literal “lips” Cas oftentimes made the wrong decisions. Something Dean never failed to yell at him for.
4. Jack
So yeah, it's a war
Don't treat me like
“Dean!” Jack marched over to him after he had greeted his loved ones.
Anger was weird in Heaven. It was dull and fleeting, and left a bad taste in his mouth. Wasn’t Heaven supposed to be paradise? It still felt like there was something missing for Dean.
“A lot has changed, Mom.” Sam furrowed his eyebrows, in a way that is so familiar but so, so strange. Mary sighed.
“You know what I’m sayin,” She sighed. “He acts differently with Dean than with you or me. I thought they were together, like, romantically.” Sam’s eyes widened, his mouth dropping open a little bit, before breaking out into a wide smile.
Cas wasn't even fully convinced they cared about him beyond his powers.
Cas was Dean’s person. From the moment they met in that barn he knew that his life would never be the same, and it wasn’t. It couldn’t have been.
Jody didn’t know the seraph that well, but what she did know was that he had endless faith in the Winchesters, and put them (Dean) first. Always. He made Dean… happy, which didn’t happen all that often.
She has us now. Jody thought, watching as Claire straightened up on the edge of the bed, tears still falling down her face. They sat in silence for a while before either found their voices.
Left you out there standing
The handprint on the arm of Dean’s jacket, right where the scar was. All those years ago when Cas “gripped him tight and raised him from perdition.” It had since faded, but he couldn’t bring himself to wash it. It was folded in the bottom drawer, next to the picture of Cas taken sometime in the past couple years, and the mixtape he found in Cas's nearly empty room. Cas kept it, because of course he did.
And I fell from the pedestal
“How did he not know I was coming onto him what the hell.”
On begged and borrowed time
Ever since he began falling, probably even earlier than that-- the first time he felt something, and couldn’t stop since-- he began to wonder if he was enough. Sure, he was a seraph at the very least, and an Angel of the Lord at his peak, but who was he compared to Sam and Dean?
And then he woke up, anew.
And I couldn't give a reason
“Dean, Cas,” He began. “You two have known each other for years. And for years you remained completely oblivious to your feelings. Which is so annoying because literally anyone you’ve ever interacted with has known.” He paused as the crowd laughed a bit, Claire yelling ‘preach!’ from her seat next to Kaia.
Before Mary was brought back, after they returned from the past, Dean got drunk with Cas and told him everything that happened with his family. What his mom did, her deal, her death. His dad, his obsession, his abuse, drinking, and death. Tears welling in his eyes, he told the seraph how much his upbringing had hurt him. John ignoring his children for weeks on end, forcing Dean to steal or hustle or…
Only after she saw Dean and Cas interact did she begin to hope. Hope there was a way for her to have a family and still hunt, later, her hope was to keep Jody and Alex and still rip the heads off of monsters.
Eileen and Sam were there when Dean returned. His brother hugged him tight, complaining about all the years he was left alone with his codependency and nowhere to put it. Dean laughed, but it still felt hollow.
The first woman he slept with turned out to be a reaper intent on his destruction, so, that was an adventure.
“So tell me about Cas!”
Dean Winchester was a simple man, honestly. He liked women, beer, hookups, and his car, affectionately nicknamed “Baby.” It didn’t take much to please him. Dean Winchester was a soldier, he followed orders almost religiously, and even though they fought, he always returned to his dad.
After what happened to her father, Claire didn’t want anything to do with the supernatural, at first. Obviously she changed her mind and became a badass hunter with an awesome girlfriend, but she never thought that was even possible.
But it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary
“Knowing you has changed me. Because you cared, I cared. I cared about the whole world because of you.”
Sam told him all about their son, named Dean after his uncle, and how they quit active hunting to become a Bobby-esque team for the new generation of hunters. He told Dean about the giant memorial they had for him, with all of his family and friends, the way he would have wanted.
No more tug of war
That was enough for him. He didn’t need to settle down, white picket fence and a couple gross kids. Nah, he never pretended to think he could have that.
Clung to the nearest lips
Cas went from a loyal soldier who followed orders mindlessly, to the only being in the universe, in every universe, that had free will.
Dean had been driving around in the Impala for hours. Years? Bobby warned him that time was different in Heaven, what felt like minutes there would be decades on Earth. When he got back, Sam would probably be there too. Fuck, he did not want to think about Sammy dying.
Can't remember
He turned the volume up on the Zepp mixtape, the one he gave Cas. He made a mental note to thank Jack for that the next time he saw him.
“Why didn’t you tell him?” she asked, staring Benny in the eyes. He scoffed, swallowing the rest of his drink.
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Long story short, it was a bad time
Castiel, the angel of Thursday, would follow Dean anywhere. Hell. Purgatory. He didn’t even need to ask before,
“Yeah,” Jody replied, looking down at the blonde head that was pressing into her, like if she let go she would break.
The lake came into view, and he slowed to a stop on the side of the road, just before the trail down to the water. He got out and walked down the length of the dock, stumbling slightly as the wood creaked gently under his weight.
He still felt Cas’s grip on his shoulder, matching up exactly to the scar he gave him all those years ago. It felt like a lifetime had passed, looking back.
After some time had passed, Dean stood up and walked away, his footsteps breaking the silence. Sam and Jack stayed in their sitting position, holding onto each other tight.
You had some tricks up your sleeve
You're a cowboy like me
Tarnished but so grand
Crestfallen on the landing
Still spells out pain
“Didn’t know you were the founder of the religion, Bobby.”
Jody planted a soft kiss on the crown of Claire’s head, holding her tighter.
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
A distinct flutter of wings sounded just behind his left shoulder. Castiel.
He couldn’t help them hunt, he’d been told on multiple occasions that he just got in the way, he couldn’t protect them from the things that wanted to kill them, on a bad day he wasn’t even able to heal their wounds! And it wasn't like the Winchesters were known for their emotions.
What died didn’t stay dead
Even when he knew it was time to leave this world, protect Dean to the best of his abilities as he had been doing for the last decade, he needed to be happy. He needed Dean to shut up and listen to him for once, not saying “Cas, don’t do this.” Cas said, “Happiness is being” and he believed that, but it would put a damper on his joy if Dean was to stop him while he’s getting swallowed whole.
What I used to fight for
“They’re talking really good care of me, Mom.” Jack said, kneeling next to his bed with his elbows resting on the mattress, hands folded together. Ever since the Winchesters, his fathers, taught him what praying was, he prayed to his mother every night. Not God, his mom. The only constant he knew he had in his life.
He held up his glass and smiled, the rest of the party following suit. Dean and Cas looked at him, still softly crying.
“Like something, or someone, has changed him.” Rufus finishes, grabbing the flask out of Bobby’s hand, ignoring his grunt of protest.
Not wanting to be sappy or seem weak in front of anyone, Cas never talked about Dean’s soul. At least not in front of the other man. But by God was it something to talk about. It wasn’t the first thing he saw in Hell. His orders of, “Find and save Dean Winchester” were not very specific in terms of navigating the vast pit of despair and anguish. Castiel must have spent days going through every nook and cranny, sorting through billions upon billions of souls, trying to find Dean’s.
The angel avoided Dean’s eyes as he walked closer, gaze fixed to a point somewhere beyond the man’s left shoulder. That didn’t stop Dean though, from talking broad steps from the edge of his seat to where Cas stood. Fueled with momentum from his half run, he threw his arms around Cas-- one around his waist and the other around his neck-- and just breathed.
“That angel’s in love with my boy.” And that was that.
If I didn't know better
“Hey,
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
“Dean, what do you mean ‘heard’?”
“Hello, Dean.”
He ruminated on his memories with Cas. Maybe somehow he got the confession wrong? Maybe it was a “bro” moment, not an “I wanna kiss you” moment. Regardless, why wouldn’t Cas come to clear the air or at least let him know he was alive?
“Hello, Dean.”
“Claire…” Jody trailed off, rubbing her daughter’s back gently as she cried. They had just gotten a call from Sam. Castiel was dead. Killed by Lucifer in an alternate fucking world. Damn. First she loses her dad, then her mom, and now Castiel, the only link she had to her family.
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
Eventually, Dean detached his arms, but he didn’t move far. He cupped Cas’s face, hands holding his jaw, gently caressing the skin with his thumbs. Cas reached his own hands up to hold onto Dean’s wrists, as Dean touched their foreheads together; a slight pressure that made them both close their eyes.
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
A spare trench coat in the back of Baby. Cas would need a clean one when they got him back.
Dean looked around at the still-empty porch, the last rays of sunlight streaming over his face and hands. He sighed, looking out at the peaceful twilight beginning to set in.
Magnificently cursed
You had a speech, you're speechless
It wasn’t until Sam and Jack got back, his name echoing throughout the painfully empty bunker. Sam burst through the doorway, Dean’s name still on his lips, Jack right behind him. Sam took in the scene. The door, a complete mess, the bloodstains on the floor and the arm of Dean’s jacket, Dean. Alone. Dean couldn’t meet his eyes, a new wave of tears threatening to fall.
(Sam told Eileen he was like a widower, whose spouse died in childbirth and he resented the child she bore. All Dean saw when he looked at Jack was Lucifer. The devil who tried to kill him and his family and Cas. Numerous times.)
Now I just know there's more
It's been a long time
“Hey Cas,” Dean cleared his throat. Who knew you still had to do that in Heaven? “It’s me, again. Just wonderin’ when, or if, you can come down for a little visit. I think we should talk.”
Everywhere he looked, Cas was there. The jacket he couldn’t bring himself to wash. The spare trench-coat he had kept in the trunk of the Impala. The fucking ugly Continental still sitting in the garage, all of the trinkets and books Cas collected over the years growing a thin layer of dust as they went untouched.
Maybe Heaven wouldn’t be so bad… as long as Cas was there.
He tried the whole God thing, didn’t really work out. At least before that he was still able to talk to his siblings without them attacking him first. Then he was just a human, or “Steve.” No grace, no Garrison to back him up, no family, no home, no nothing.
Dean changed him. Castiel. Castiel, “of God” became Cas. Dean Winchester’s angel. (Or his bitch, if you asked Crowley.) He taught Cas to question authority, make his own decisions. He couldn’t stand with Heaven anymore, not after meeting Dean. His family, his brethren turned on him, tried to kill him for his betrayal, but Cas never regretted it for a moment. He was in danger constantly for ten years, but if it meant finding a new family in Dean, he would do anything.
Sam sits at the table, hands in his hair, still poring over the books. His plate is empty— Dean is a good cook. He is unaware of the conversation his brothers are having inside Castiel’s room.
I sit back down for the second time.
“Good to meet you, Mr. Singer,” Castiel says earnestly. “I’m excited for the season to begin.” He means it—Bobby seems strict, but the look in his eyes is steady. Bobby will be a fair coach, if nothing else.
There is a CRASH. Sam sits instantly alert— there are those killer instincts. He grabs a gun and creeps slowly towards the entrance, where he finds… EILEEN. She stands at the entrance, confused, looking around. Sam keeps the gun trained on her, grief and rage and confusion flitting across his face.
And then, as the song concludes, Dean pulls to a stop. At the end of the road is Cas, and Sam standing behind him, waiting. They stand on a bridge that stretches over a river. The sun is just beginning to set. Dean gets out of the car, closing Baby gently.
“You're gonna be insufferable now that you can say shit like that, aren’t you?” He shook his head slightly at the growing smile on Cas’s lips.
“Shut up.”)
All Dean could think about was Cas. The striking blue of his eyes. His dorky crooked smile when he tried to cheer people up. Saving Dean time and time again, always being there when he called.
“Cas, is that a Star Wars reference?”
Jack smiled, and closed his eyes, picturing the face of his mom, Kelly Kline. Jack Kline. Yeah that sounds right.
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
And seeing the shape of your name
“What about Cas?” Sam laughed slightly. “He’s an angel, which you know, he rebelled against Heaven for, well I guess technically for Dean, he’s saved us so many times. He’s one of our best friends, like our brother.”
Forever is the sweetest con
He believed it.
How incredible is it to find someone who knew you, inside and out, truly knew you, and have him ripped away in front of you? Without even getting to say goodbye. Cas didn’t even know he loved him back.
It didn’t matter now, Cas was gone. Well, not gone gone, but he wasn’t going back to Earth for as long as he possibly could.
The more that you say, the less I know
Dean- just barely out of his teen years, still trying to protect Sam from his dad’s wrath, terrified that John would find out about those weekends alone with Lee- would have shot you point blank in the face.
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And the skeletons in both our closets
He mentioned it to Rufus once. Bastard was as unhelpful as usual.
Grocery shopping. Beer runs. Going on drives in the impala for no reason other than “C’mon Cas, we don’t have anything to hurt and I’m bored! Let’s just go for a ride.” Cas secretly loved the moments he had alone with Dean, no Sam or Bobby or Kevin- just the two of them.
On thе very moment, all was lost
“I’ve noticed. Your dad,” At this, Sam looked away, hmm. “This bunker, angels!” She laughed softly.
Crowley. Metatron. Lucifer. Could he ever do anything right in Dean’s eyes?
“Was he in love with me here?”
It was like every decision he made was the absolute worst possible one to make. He used to be angry about it, sitting in the back of the Impala, fuming because he was set to a higher set of standards than his humans. When he fucked up he fucked up badly, usually ending in a yelling match between him and Dean, with Sam trying desperately to avoid taking a side, ignoring the icy glares directed toward him.
He still felt… empty. As soon as the thrill and joy from seeing his friends faded, he was just lonely. Sam had Eileen, Ellen had Bobby, Jo, Kevin and Charlie apparently were all close friends. Dean had people, but none of them were Cas.
“I mean, I think I coulda fallen for him.” He swished his drink around in the glass. “Even if I hadn’t, he was still the best goddamn friend I ever had.” The bartender looked up from the sink where she was drying glasses.
After his conversation with Sam the day prior, Dean decided to take Baby out for a much needed drive to clear his head. (The reason why he needed to clear his mind went unsaid and unthought.) It didn’t work. If anything he thought more without any annoying younger brothers and brothers’ girlfriends to annoy him into getting actual help.
Somehow after the third, he wound up at the main table, tracing the letters of Cas’s name.
“Sam is so kind and gentle, he’s teaching me a lot about the world and my feelings. I think he really believes in me. Dean is really strict, kinda cold. I think he’s warming up to me though! He taught me how to make burgers the other day. And Castiel…” Jack smiled, his heart warm.
“I’m also sorry for not telling you. I was scared you’d reject me and I’d lose my best friend along with the man I loved. In all honesty I thought angels weren’t capable of romantic love.” He paused. “Which, I guess isn’t fair to you. I mean, time and time again you have proven to be different from the rest of your kind, and I’m sorry I lumped you in with the rest of them because of my fears.”
Then there was Daphne Allen. ‘Technically, aren’t we still married?’ Cas thought one day. Was Emmanuel technically Castiel? Or Jimmy? Some weird mix of the two? How did that work with angels? 'Am I committing sacrilege of some sort by being married to two people at once?’
Other than the new music, Baby had remained the same as Dean last saw her, before, you know, being impaled and bleeding out. Ouch. Shit hurt. A trench-coat was folded up in the back seat, and a jacket with a distinctive blood stain had mysteriously ended up next to it.
“Bitch.”
“I know I am, Cas. Of course I know. You gave everything for me; your family, freedom, Hell, Cas you gave your life.” Cas made a motion to interrupt, but Dean shushed him.
“Dean, man,” Sam started, a few days after they defeated Chuck. “I think we need to talk about Cas.”
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Dean startled. “Talk to someone?” He scoffed. “Like grief counseling?”
Knowing Dean Winchester fundamentally changed him. That was a known fact, he would argue it every day of his life if he needed to. But it wasn’t just Dean.
The car ride back and up the stairs
Benny didn’t really have anyone to talk to other than Dean, which is why he found himself one night at a random, dumpy bar, spilling his feelings to the conventionally attractive bartender.
Some situation that needs to be handled
Before he knew it, the party was wrapping up and everyone was going home. Sam and Eileen found a nice little place down the street from this adorable old farmhouse Dean “claimed.” He no longer understood Heaven logic, but who was he to argue against a free, completely  furnished house? It had a wrap around porch and a rocking chair!

And when I was shipwrecked I thought of you
1. Bobby + Rufus
Dean sat down and cried for a while.
“You know Cas. He’s like me, we don’t really fit in here. He’s always there for me, believes in me constantly.” He sighed a little, lips pouting.
The color of Meg's eyes.
My girlfriend was lying in our bed
Black and white sorrow
Shoelaces are quite hard to tie with shaking hands, Castiel finds. He swallows and knots the laces hard, still kneeling on the sidewalk.
“Dean. Why is Sam crying?”
Hello, Dean.
The bell jangles cheerily as I push my way into the tiny pastry shop. The wind howls outside, snow whirling past in a chaotic tangle. I’m frozen to the bone and probably look like crap, so I brush the snow from my face and shake out my icy hands. People look at me sympathetically from their cozy booths as I take jerky steps up to the counter to order a coffee. There’s a line; it’s a terrible day to be outside.
“Novak?” a gruff voice inquires from behind him.
Dean throwing popcorn and Monopoly pieces at Sam, chasing him around the living room as Sam raises his arms in protest.
BOBBY
INT. BUNKER - KITCHEN - MORNING
Her eyes were open
I thought I’d never have anyone again. But Cas... he makes me happy, makes the world seem a little less colorless.
“Don’t let that dumb kid rattle ya, okay?” Bobby’s gruff voice says from above. “It’s growin’ pains; he’ll settle down and make nice soon enough.”
The weather is perfect, as usual; pillowy clouds roll gently across the bright blue summer sky. Seagulls squawk obnoxiously and pick at the french fries littered on the pavement. The air smells of fried food and lake-water, a strange yet surprisingly enticing aroma.
Two Years Later
INT. VAMP NEST BARN. NIGHT.
(brief confusion)
(fondly)
“Hey, careful with that!” Charlie says. “I helped take down Dick Roman with that laptop.”
Cas looks at me for a moment, his eyes unreadable. “You don’t have to leave,” he says quietly.
