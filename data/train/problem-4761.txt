A dark, dangerous voice in the back of his head whispered to him that maybe it wouldn't be so bad if Dean found it. But it was soon drowned out by Castiel's rational thinking. Nothing would happen if Dean found it, the love spell would take care of it. And the secrets and lies that Castiel had accepted to live with would remain.
"Kid, don't take it to heart," Gabriel said, when Castiel's fingers felt too stiff and clumsy to unlock his car on the first try. Castiel turned to look at him, finding Gabriel grinning. There were so many things he would have liked to say. That he couldn't help it. He used black magic to hurt someone else. That he didn't want to hurt Dean. That he had already opened himself up too much to Dean to disentangle himself. That he was just human and this hurt. But he said nothing, merely gazing at Gabriel in the hope that his expression wouldn't look too mournful. Something flickered past Gabriel's face, breaking through his grin. To avoid raising more suspicion Cas turned away from him, unlocking the car now. But it was as if Gabriel had read his mind:
"Yeah, we still have territories right there. The Winchester enclave Rooney… Pretty ballsy if you ask me," Dean muttered to which Castiel nodded.
"It's a daily menu. I already made sure it was something you liked," Castiel assured him and Dean decided to trust Cas. Castiel handed Jack a toy that rattled when Jack shook it, something the boy seemed to be particularly fascinated by. Dean didn't know much about kids, but it was clear to him that Jack developed much faster than human babies did. Dean wasn't sure how old Jack was, but he did look like a toddler, not a newborn. He studied the boy, how he squinted and pouted when Cas pulled the toy out of his mouth.
"I'm sorry for interrupting, Castiel, but… uh… your presence is required in the kitchen."
"How's Jack doing with his girlfriend?" Dean asked after a moment and Cas heaved a sigh.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Benny," Dean mumbled, unsure what to say but touched nevertheless. "I can't ask this of any of you."
"Angel customs," he eventually muttered and then they fell into silence, drinking their hot chocolate. After he was done, he handed Mary the cup.
"Dean… You really don't have to do this for me," Cas told him gently, standing so close that his chest was pressing against Dean's arm and Dean could feel his calm heartbeat thrum against his arm.
"You're not asking, Dean. I'll hand Bobby a list of everybody who's offering. Okay?" Benny gave Dean's shoulder a light shake. "Okay?"
"You kept a part of his Grace? That's not creepy at all, dude."
"No ifs and buts, Castiel," Gabriel told him cheerfully, but there was the usual gleam of danger in Gabriel's golden eyes, to warn him not to take this lightly. "You've put your initiation off for far too long already. And now's as good a time as any!" He stabbed the pancakes with his fork. "And it's not like you've got to go all Book of the Damned on us and slaughter fifty newborns to open a rift to limbo. A little havoc will do," Gabriel announced charitably and then continued eating his breakfast. Castiel withdrew behind the counter.
"I don't like it… This feels far too easy…" Dean said, raising his sword again.
"Come on, so you don't get to see Cas whenever you want to, what's the big deal?" Charlie asked, when Dean was moping. "Two weeks of regular fucking and now you're already addicted or what?" Charlie's playful expression turned somber. "This is just you being you, right? Not some "the weird soul bond made me do it" mojo?"
“Lots of deals,” Dean muttered, though he didn’t look as displeased as he sounded. If Jack gave up the divine power into Amara’s custody, then she would help him with the Empty. The Empty in turn was in such disarray and so flustered by the noise, that it happily agreed to relinquish its claim on Cas if Amara put everyone in there back to sleep.
Dean was restless. He had nothing particular to do and nowhere to be as the case continued to be stalled. Waiting around for the people to leave, only served to show Dean just how out of place he was in this town. He was just a visitor and the only thing that really held him here was Cas. In the last couple of weeks Dean's world had slowly narrowed down to him. And while he couldn't bring himself to be freaked out about it, it was… dissatisfying the way it was now.
"So you know that decorating your room is what you do when you have a room," Dean told him, slowly, like he was trying to get across a simple concept to a child. Which was how he usually talked to Jack and how he often talked to Cas. Cas knew not to be offended by it.
"Uh, I don't think so, but it's not like you're in my head." Dean looked up at Cas suspiciously. "Or are you?"
“Hello?!” Cas called and his voice bounced off the space oddly, the sounds stuttering around him before being swallowed up into the ground. He repeated his calling some more, but even though the commotion should have roused the Empty, considering its intense dislike of him and his noise, nothing happened.
“Uh… So… pretty rough weather outside, huh?” Dean said and wanted to hit himself in the face right afterwards. The man’s eyebrows lowered lightly and then he tilted his head. Stupidly, Dean lifted his hand towards his own hair, waving his fingers around. But he could stop himself from saying anything about the wild hair. Instead, he scratched his head. Nice safe!
"Rest for a moment, but not long, it's too dangerous," Castiel said as they had left the eerie village behind them. A dense forest was rising before him, the path dark and shrouded in fog. There were tingling noises coming from it, like little bells. Dean didn't even dare to ask about it. Dean took the time to drink some water and observe Castiel. Here in this realm it was clear as day that Castiel wasn't human. His eyes glowed blue as he turned his head around, listening to things Dean didn't hear, seeing a world that Dean didn't know existed. After a while, Castiel lifted his hand and a lantern materialized in his hand. It was big and looked heavy. Castiel lifted it to his face and blew into it. A green flame flickered to life.
"Come on, get in. We'll go home." Cas automatically mimicked the smile out of reflex, but his brain was painfully blank. And he was… exhausted all of a sudden.
The summer days got slightly less chilly as they travelled and by the time they crossed into Lucifer's dominion the days were long and hot. The landscape hadn't changed much, but was not as verdant and wild as it had been in Enoch. It also took little time for them to get to populated areas. Dean had passed smaller villages in Enoch, but here there were proper grand cities, with cultivated gardens and parks overflowing with beautiful roses.
"That's a shame," he said instead and Dean shrugged. "I'm sure you have lots of love to give." Dean was clearly taken aback by his comment and his face turned slightly red. Castiel watched him fumble with the napkin, snort a laugh and then drink another generous sip of his beer. "Did I say something wrong?"
Then Dean went back inside.
"You don't have to be ashamed," Dean told him carefully. "I've accepted my position here. I know you need me here."
"While his mother-in-law is here, he can't go
"Are you going to hunt?" Cas asked and Dean nodded. "Do you want me to come help?"
Castiel rounded the corner and immediately felt all eyes in the huge, white, empty living room focus on him. Gabriel was draped across the long white couch, raising his glass of champagne, but all the other members of the coven were standing around in a loose circle. Raphael was still glaring daggers at him and Hannah sent him the smallest of smiles, but the others didn't let any emotion show on their face, making it even harder for Cas to read the room.
"Oh shit," Ash said, then quickly handed Dean a shield and the training sword. Dean should be glad for his quick thinking because Uriel jumped the fence a second later and then he already swung his wooden sword in Dean's direction.
"Yes?"
," he said with distaste which made Dean snort a laugh. "What do you want to do, Dean?"
"I'd be happy to visit you, Grandma Millie," Jack announced, "you've been very kind to offer me pancakes and I'd love to see you again." Millie looked at him in surprise, but then she chuckled, reaching out to ruffle Jack's hair.
"Yeah, it's good," Dean said and looked at Cas. "It
Dean used his free hand to pinch the bridge of his nose. He let himself relax a bit, now that he knew that nothing bad had happened.
"You're not exactly creative with your wardrobe either, Dean," Castiel told him. Dean crossed his arms over his chest, looking defensive again. "I don't get tired of wearing this. It's… comfort to me, Dean. It's part of what I…" Castiel sighed and Dean's defensive stance eased up at once, a flicker of concern crossing his features. "When I possessed this body, the clothing was as much part of it as the hands, the hair, the eyes. As a habit, we don’t change anything about our vessel."
"What?"
"You're gonna hover?" Dean asked when he took his fork and Gabriel was still standing by their table, a big grin on his face. Since Gabriel wasn't going to move away, Dean seemed to resign himself to his fate and took a bite of his pie. And then another, before he took a sip of his coffee.
"I know," Jack said, "but that doesn’t mean you can't change your job and find one where you won't be so far away from your pack!"
He didn't want to think about the curse too much, or his father's ominous words. Thinking about Cas was safer and much more agreeable. To a degree. Dean had heard so many things about the banished witch, had read more into the void that had been left behind in the spaces the court witch had once inhabited. His name was no where to be found anymore, scratched out of any documents apart from the one of his banishment. His mother got upset when Dean asked about him and what he had done and his father shrouded himself in silence.
"It's the fraction of you that I can know," Dean answered, his voice low and comforting now. He reached out and put his hand on Castiel's shoulder, but then slowly slipped it down to caress his arm. "And you make a substantial effort to help Jack fit in among other people." When Cas opened his mouth, Dean gave his arm a bit of a squeeze. "Don't start. I've seen the contents of his wardrobe. And I've seen you browse the internet to find out what people his age wear to fit in." Castiel gave a minute nod, because yes of course he did that. He wanted Jack to not feel divided from humans any more than he already did. "But why don't you do this for yourself?"
"I disagree," Castiel told him and even though Lucifer's words did hurt some part of him, the anger at his husband trying to humiliate him still far outweighed the hurt. "Claire and Jack both liked it and I do too. You're not going to the beach with me, so you don't have to look at it." At this Luke's face changed to a sneer.
“I’m glad that you’re here before my father comes home,” Jack told him, waving him inside. “Hello, I’m Jack.”
"Do you want an umbrella?" Castiel asked as the man shrugged on his coat and then went to open the door. The bell chimed and a spray of rain hit the man in the face. He sputtered indignantly.
"Cas… we don't have to, just because I was a bit of a mess yesterday," Dean started cautiously. "I mean… I totally want us to move forwards but not at the expense of your comfort."
"He can deal with it," Emma muttered and then apparently her call was answered. "Hey, Dad!" Castiel couldn't hear the other end of the conversation but he watched Emma close her eyes and lift her free hand. "Everything's alright! Well, not everything. Because daycare sucks!" She put her hand into her hip, listening to her dad. "No! They suck." She rolled her eyes. "Yeah I know. Which is why I wanted to ask if I can stay with Cas." At the mention of his name Cas tensed. "He said I could. He has a spare room." There was a lengthy pause in Emma's conversation, then she rolled her eyes and all of a sudden Cas found himself staring down at the phone she held out to him.
"Is that what you think is going to happen?" she asked and Dean shrugged. "They've been locked up in those endless meetings for hours and hours. Maybe they should have spent a longer time discussing this in the first place, instead of just rushing to war on rumors alone."
"My name is Anna. I'm the General of the Army, here to represent Castiel, seraph of the First Choir," the angel called and judged from the surprised muttering around Dean, he wasn't the only one surprised that someone as young, especially a woman, would command the armies of Elysium. "I call upon Dean Winchester to present himself," she demanded. Dean shot his parents a look. Mary seemed unsure, but eventually she steeled herself and stepped forwards. Instantly, Anna's eyes darted towards her, icy and disapproving.
"Witch's robes mostly," Castiel replied simply. "People had to know who and what I was right away, as was the wish of the court I served."
In any case, Castiel wasn't elaborating and Dean didn't want to think about it any further.
existed. A different version of him that Castiel touched with gentle, careful hands.
Beverly was a ten hour drive away and he wasn't sure how Cas would react if Dean revealed that he'd be investigating in his old hometown. Dean looked at the laptop screen, his fingers hovering over the keyboard, his eyes tracing the headlines again.
"This is what you wear?", he asked, somewhat displeased.
"It's not what I want, Dean," Castiel answered promptly. "But I can't make this about what I want." Dean hesitated, his irritation fading quickly when he watched Castiel turn his face away. "I don't have the luxury."
"Of course, Cas… I'm kinda curious about your family." Castiel relaxed at that, then he took Dean's hand and pulled him towards the house. As they walked up Dean could see curious faces disappear behind curtains and he heard some giggling and shushing. Dean knew that his family would be exactly the same once he brought Cas over.
"You are done. I was in favor of crushing you like the vermin you are. Who are you to stand here before us with a crown on your head, with the luxury of having the spawn of your loins still breathing when others were slaughtered pointlessly on that field?!" To his credit, John didn't flinch but Mary winced and even Dean felt the angel's loud voice strike hard. "You call yourself a king?" he spat, pointing his finger at John. "You are on
(See the end of the chapter for
"Seeing as I apparently chased off your customer, sure," he said and got up.
"An Empusa? Outside of Greece?" Sam asked, his tone suggesting doubt.
At least they were still holding hands, so Sam assumed that Dean wouldn't go breaking up with Cas over this unfortunate adventure anytime soon.
"Really," he said, "I doubt he's a good one."
By the time Castiel was out with the man's breakfast, Gabriel must have gotten through some questions because the first thing he did was slap Castiel on the ass as he passed him.
"Excuse me?" Dean almost chocked on his beer, because that? That had been Cas' voice. Dean turned to the side and found an alpha with a moustache (a moustache! Were they in the 70s?) crowding against Cas.
"Well, I guess we've got to investigate if there have been other strange occurrences in this region, talk to the police and interrogate the witness," Sam said and looked around the table.
"Dean… I hardly leave the Bunker… And I don't think Sam needs to see me in some of the shorts you bought." Dean merely grinned innocently. "They only cover part of my ass, Dean." This only widened Dean's grin, so Castiel had to be stern: "I will not be wearing them when in company."
"When did you think that something was really off with her?" Dean wondered and Drought shrugged.
"Right, the case," Dean said and drummed his fingers against the chair's backrest. Sam shot him a look, but then the door opened and Mary came in, still dressed in her FBI get up.
"It's just like Dad to ask that… Does he think I'm a kid?" Emma muttered, then she bit into her slice of pizza. "Do your homework, Emma!" Castiel had to laugh at her imitation of her dad, both the grimace she made but also how she chose to pitch her voice up, instead of down.
"No problem," Gabriel said with a grin, then he turned towards the other pagan gods. "And you boys? Do you want a ride into the mystical land of an alternative future?"
While Castiel made his way to the omega shelter, he gave himself a little sniff, trying to figure out what his scent must be like. But he couldn't really smell much apart from the uncomfortable scent of his damp clothes that struggled to dry in the cold, but wet air. If that was his actual scent, the one he knew alphas and omegas could pick out easily, but betas rarely did, he considered that slightly unfortunate. But he guessed that maybe he would smell better once his clothes were dry.
"Why shouldn't I? Ash told me he's looking for a new head of marketing, so of course I was gonna put your name forwards. It's the duty of the Queen to look after her subjects!" Dean rolled his eyes, but Ash lifted his finger, pointing at her.
"But… This is a case," Jack insisted, not understanding the issue. Castiel stepped around to Jack's side of the table now, putting his hand on Jack's shoulder to get his attention.
"It's a manifestation of Grace rotting. A form of sepsis if you will. Castiel's Grace is trying to preserve itself but it's like poison to him in the long run. He might be able to survive it, but it is dangerous and maybe letting the Grace bleed out would be better for him…," Flagstaff explained, then she shook her head. "This isn't a good look for the leader of Enoch."
"I can assure you, I'm not aroused," Cas answered dryly. And maybe on any other day Dean would have let him handle himself. But Dean was sitting right next to Cas. Had the dude no eyes? Dean leant back, so he could look at moustache.
"Yes. I don't know how he pulled it off, but he found out about what I'd reported and that my parents and Bobby had been thinking about it. Mom doesn't think it's a good idea for Cas to be vulnerable and to push it further. And I think I do agree with her. If Gabriel hadn't intervened nothing even would have come out of it."
"Hello Jack. Where were you?" he asked, then looked at Cas. His eyes travelled down, zeroing in on the shopping bag. So far there was no particular judgement on his face. As an accountant, Cas was the one who was responsible for the household finances, but that didn't stop Luke from frequently second-guessing Cas' handle of money. Of course, Cas in turn wasn't allowed to ask why Luke spent 200$ in a fancy restaurant or dropped 1000$ at a high-class hotel (there was no point in asking questions you knew the answer to anyway).
"Fine. I'll get you a copy. We can schedule brood meetings in our free period," Castiel determined.
"That doesn't sound like fun," Dean said, pulling his shirt out of his pants, then started unbuttoning it. He had put on only the bare minimum of layers, since he had counted on having to get undressed anyway.
"But that's impossible," John said and Dean had to agree. He surely hadn't just imagined the pain. "Benny told us what happened. Pierced through the chest by a spear. Definitely fatal. Those had been his words!" The doctor could only shrug at the situation. He was allowed to finish his assessment, then he left the King and his son alone.
"Thank you," he said when he too received a cup of tea. He wasn't much of a tea drinker but it seemed rude to deny his mother-in-law.
"The spell wouldn't have worked if I hadn't opened up too… I love you, Dean."
"Totally. Now we eat! On me, friends!"
"Uh, can I help you?" Ambriel asked after Dean had walked past where she was working at a desk for the fifth time. She still seemed to be vaguely wary of him, but apparently he was hard to ignore when he was pacing.
"But that doesn't change the fact that I think you should switch it up from time to time." Not getting any further interruptions from Castiel's side, Dean went on in his normal tone. "You've been here on earth for so long, don't you get tired of wearing the same thing all the time?"
words because there was so much more that he should be telling Cas.
"Well, let's hope you will," Dean said with a wink that had Castiel blushing.
But as it turned out, it wasn’t John that would have to pay the price of Mary's choice.
"I do worry about you, Dean," Cas told him on Wednesday evening. Dean had his phone lying next to his plate, shoving around the broccoli with his fork.
"The kid leaving the house is a big deal, do you already know how you're going to spend your newly won freedom?" John asked. Since Cas was still looking at him, Dean got to see the flicker of upset on Cas' face before he schooled it and turned to look at John.
"Just a moment," he said. "I wanted to inquire if you're alright." Dean snorted.
"Oh, there was a time when it was actually a great sacrifice for humans to give up their first born. Humans are so barbaric nowadays, so careless. Giving up a child for a bit of magical corn-salad. Your father could have offered his life instead. Not that I would have taken it, a little baby usually fetches a better price," Rowena mused. Castiel decided to ignore her words and focus their conversation on what he had asked her to come for.
"The kid that survived… that was him?" Sam asked. Dean hummed in agreement. "Dean…" Dean put the charm back down and rubbed his eyes.
"You said Dean wouldn't steal from me," Castiel corrected her and looked up from his reading. Ellen was standing by the shelves, wiping her eyes. "And he didn't. My mother was broken without my father and she lost her home trying to follow him. The loss of her heart and roots made her wilt away… But I'm not leaving."
"The people here are as chilly as your mother, Flagstaff and Duma used to be," he said, then took a sip of the drink. It seemed to be sweetened cold tea, with ice cubes in it. Dean wasn't sure why he had expected to be served bad stuff, but this was quite good. He held it out to Cas in invitation but Cas merely shook his head, his gaze still alert. "Flagstaff and Duma are still standoffish though. Must be my personality."
"No, that won't work," Cas said, sitting up now. "It's not just a Winchester's life that Billie wanted. She wanted to toss them into the empty. It would effectively remove Dean's soul from this universe. My Grace can't compete with the power of Dean's soul. And neither does it come close in value."
“I don’t sleep much,” Jack said, stepping back into his room, letting Cas come in as well. “And I want to speak to you.”
It was frustrating. Especially since now Dean was once again put into a position to wait. If he would go back to Winchester, where he would have to eventually resume his life, then he'd make sure to get to know his allies better. He wouldn't work with people he couldn't trust. Tough it seemed like at the moment there were very few people Dean could trust outside of his closest friends and family.
"So?" the god asked, pulling Dean out of his weird, kinda embarrassing, emotional bubble. Dean looked at him blankly. "You have the powers of a god at your disposal. Are there any monsters that need slaying?"
“Half angel, half human,” Dean breathed, turning his head to the kitchen where Jack was happily eating a peanut butter sandwich, uninterested in what was going on between Dean and Cas. Then Dean turned his attention back to Cas. If Jack was half angel and this dude wasn’t human, that meant…
"It's the prince," it croaked and Castiel's heart seemed to skip a beat. Sam was down in the cottage, enjoying a cup of tea while doing his coursework, so there was only one other prince Gabriel could mean. Castiel patted down his hair nervously. "He'll be coming in through the back door again." Castiel flicked his hand, sending a blast of air at the crow, making it fly away with an indignant cry that echoed with Gabriel's laughter.
"I'm gonna go grab your hat!"
"Some dragons feel more comfortable in human family structures, though as far as I know human males tend to avoid parental duty to some degree…," his mother told him. "Besides, maybe your partner has an intellectual interest in participating in the project. You're no longer in high school. He might be as much of an academic as you are." Castiel heaved a sigh. "Who is your partner?"
"I feel you would only complicate the matter. I have it already planned out."
"I'm not worrying and everyone takes personal calls but you. Adler's on the phone almost all the time talking about golf and aqua jogging. You're fine," Tessa said with a laugh. "Actually, I think it's kinda cute that your boyfriend's kid calls you at work."
"I think there are things in this world that we don't understand. And that there are special people who might be more attuned to it. I wouldn't go play with an Ouija board for example, just in case." Dean chuckled at that.
"What? No-"
"What isn't gonna happen?" Dean asked him, slowly approaching the bed now that the seat next to it was empty again. Castiel turned his head on the pillow, looking at Dean, his eyes warm and shining, even though there wasn't quite a smile on his pale lips.
"First of all, being someone's rebound sex can be fun, but isn't generally a good idea," Dean said, which was followed by Jack humming. "Do you even want to have sex with her?"
“I’m not a-“
"And how long will you be staying here?" Castiel asked, redirecting his thoughts towards something less gloomy. He was fishing for information now that Dean had opened up about working a case.
"Well, it's been a great pleasure meeting you, Dean," Gabriel said and Castiel looked at the man. So his name was Dean, or at least it was his chosen alias. Castiel nodded at him when Gabriel put some bills on the table. "But now I've got some business to attend to!" He sent Castiel a look which he knew to interpret both as a warning and as a reminder to be at the gathering.
Dean watched his parents for a moment longer, unsure if he should actually talk to them when they were clearly past tipsy. But he didn't feel like he could wait one more night. He wanted to see Cas tonight!
"So… uh," Sam started, putting his gun away, "you came here from another dimension? Both of you?"
Even though Cas did his best to avoid his mother, he took a slow moment at work to call her. He had the egg on a little cushion under the counter, close enough to frequently check the temperature and cover it up with blankets if necessary.
"You seem to be doing well," Dean observed. Cas opened his eyes and squinted at Dean. "I still remember how haggard my parents were after Adam was born, even though they had nannies and nurses."
"You know her?" Sam asked and his brother pursed his lips but then shook his head. "What was in the blood pact?"
The reason Dean had told Cas to wait in a shelter in the nearest town was because he fell to earth a long journey away from the Bunker without any money on him. It was hard to exist as a human without any money at all, a lesson that took almost no time at all for Cas to learn.
"I thought so too, earlier. But now I'm not so sure anymore," he said with a gentle smile. Dean pulled down his eyebrows, giving his head a small shake. "The years I got to raise Sam were a blessing. And spending time with you…"
“Dude. Dean had no idea what to do when he showed up. I made him his character and while he regularly grumbles about it, he’s really into it. So whatever you will pick, the other players will make it fun for you. Don’t worry! 👍”
Dean shook his head. What a fucked-up situation.
"He was pretty cool," Sam agreed and then he looked to Dean, who was back to staring at Cas as if blinking might make him disappear too. "It's a shame that Dean's not a god in this world either." That got Dean's attention. He snorted.
“Cas!” Jack shouted and hurried over to hug him. “It worked! I wasn’t sure if Amara would do it, or if the Empty would uphold its end of the bargain!” Jack grinned widely. “But I’m glad!” He took a step back and looked him up and down, pretty much how Dean had, just without the blush. Now it was Sam’s turn to put down the bags on the table and grin at him, his expression fond and warm.
good at cooking and baking," she said and took her seat at the other table, happily eating her slice while she opened up the folders. Cas spent the rest of the afternoon fantasizing about wonderful Mr. Winchester. At least that chased away a bit of the cold. Meg would call him pathetic, but she didn't have to know.
"Well, I'm glad you took the initiative," Dean assured him and gave his hand a squeeze. "And I really like how you look tonight. I can't wait to get you out of your clothes."
"Will I see you for lunch?" Castiel asked, when he gathered his letter.
"No question who this guy likes better," Dean joked when he handed Jack over. The boy sighed in pleasure, burrowing closer into Cas, rubbing his little nose into his neck. For a moment Dean saw some golden glimmers around his back and he squinted at him a bit closer.
"The Lord's Suite has antechambers for your guards and your handmaiden, so they will always be close by," Castiel said and guided Dean to the rooms in question. It was pretty nicely furnished, in a style that Dean liked; not overly stuffy and decorated. Mostly functional and quite modern too. "I hope the amenities are acceptable."
He went to his bedroom, to get out of his suit jacket. He felt a bit weird to dress down when Emma was around. He was still her boss, no need for her to see him in his sleep wear. His phone pinged with a new message and he fished it out of his discarded jacket. He did a double take when he saw Mr. Winchester's text. Mr. Winchester! Texting him!
"He's not a princess!" Bobby interjected, more amused than in real protest.
"Cas." Dean commanded and Cas flinched. "Raphael's a witch. Did you know? Is that why you knew how to look for the hex bag and how to destroy it?" Castiel lowered his head. "Cas." Dean's voice was strained, silent. "Why are you protecting them?! Why are you protecting the coven that tried to get rid of me just now?!" Castiel blanched. So Dean did know about them. He had figured out far more than Cas had suspected.
"You have no idea," he muttered, then he typed it because, well, it was true.
“Hmm. Alright. Does that mean I have to deal with Stacy, Max and Eliot…? I do still feel kind of bad, even though I fixed it…”
"So both of them would actually profit, at least for the moment," Dean summarized.
"Oh, yeah. This universe does give off some weird vibes," he said and Dean turned around to find him standing there in regular, modern clothes. The god too was dressed in jeans and dark green flannel, and he was fingering sunglasses that Gabriel had apparently put onto his nose. Noticing Dean's look Gabriel shrugged.
"No," the witch answered and he sounded almost angry with Dean. "I've got no interest in harming the Prince of Winchester." Dean was pleasantly surprised to be recognized.
"You are to go to Winchester. Becoming Anael's assistant is of course a demotion for you, but you have to see this as a chance to learn from Anael. She will prepare you for a position in the High Council at a later point in your life, if you will still want it then. That is your best chance to counteract anti-human sentiments. It gives you more freedom than being general." Naomi looked from Cas to Dean. "I have sent ahead a messenger to Winchester with the gist of Michael's decision and a request to provide adequate quarters for Anael and Castiel." Naomi wrinkled her nose. "And your son. He will be growing up among humans, but I suppose that will not hurt him much in the long run. Michael has been most displeased when he was informed of Lucifer's transgressions with the human woman. He approves of his placement with you. And that is all I had to report." She folded her hands in front of herself, looking at them expectantly.
"Of course," Sam said and then he got out of the car once Dean had left for the reception. Cas hesitated but after a while he got out too. He breathed in a sigh of relief when he could smell something else for a change. But then he noticed the uncomfortable crick in his neck from keeping his nose buried into the leather seat.
"I can't," Castiel repeated. "It's far too powerful at this point. The only way it can fade is with time and distance. You have to leave and… just let it heal." Dean grit his teeth and the gun wavered, but eventually he put it away again. "I could make you forget, but I cannot undo the love…"
"Actually, he really does resemble you. The same eye color, the same squint, the same smile, even though the little dude misses his teeth. Are you and Lucifer related too by some chance?" Dean asked. Castiel chuckled.
"Proof enough for you?" Sam asked, but his tone wasn't mocking. It was soft, almost sad. He heaved a sigh into the silence and then he turned back to Castiel.
"I would like that too, thank you Dean. And I'm sorry… that I don't remember you from back then." Dean laughed at Sam's contrite expression.
figure something out," his mother vowed. "We just have to."
"It's still bad… You devote yourself to the first human you see," he said, his voice carrying a lighter tone and Castiel was glad for it. "I've got a feeling that this is going to be just as bad as Purgatory. Maybe you should have at least feigned interest in marrying Lucifer."
“Okay,” Jack agreed, not too worried about it. Knowing that Cas told him it was okay, was enough for now to quiet the unsettling feeling inside of him. “Thanks, Cas.”
"I love you, Dean. Drive safely," he said. A small smile, almost surprised, flickered over Dean's face, but it was soon weighed down with tension around the corners of Dean's mouth.
“Claire’s text suggested that you had succeeded in bringing the people back that Chuck made disappear,” he started. Dean huffed, shrugging like it was no big deal. Maybe Cas had been wrong to assume that this meant some sort of reprieve in their fight against Chuck. “Dean, what happened? Is Sam alright? What about Jack?” While Dean had remained somewhat relaxed when Cas mentioned Sam (which Cas hoped to be a good sign), he did tense at the mention of Jack. Cas’ heart sank.
“Relax. I’m sure we’ll figure it out. The house is great! So what if we’ve got some extra space! This is a good excuse to get everyone to come to us for family holidays,” Dean assured him, then he slapped Cas’ ass. “Come on! Let’s christen this place!”
"Cas…?"
"I think you handled my parents' nosy questions well," Dean told Cas after a while, pulling Cas closer into his side, rubbing his arm.
Bobby was still being an ass about Christian's black eye, but he did let Dean into his study.
. The cold, breathless absolute certainty of his death, the pain and the terror. His body was frozen, Dean unable to move, feeling the phantoms of death still stuck in his lungs, the blood slick in his throat, remembering the way the bright blue sky had grown paler and dimmer and he had been helpless.
"Not here," Dean said, when Cas stepped away from the counter, "maybe in my car?" The suggestion seemed to take Cas by surprise, but he agreed. Dean had been driving around a bit before he came to the café, so the car was parked in the otherwise deserted lot behind the café. While Cas wrapped up the closing of the café, Dean left the building and walked to his car. He sat down and turned the key in the ignition, hoping to warm the car up a bit.
"I admit, I didn't see that one coming. Thought you wanted to stake some claim on me." Cas shook his head, even though he didn't know how penetration would mean staking a claim on someone. "But I still don't want to do it. I don't want to have sex with you." Dean told him firmly. Castiel felt frustration build inside of him.
"Gabriel," he accurately guessed.
“Yes, he is right. I was afraid…,” Cas admitted with a smile.
"I can't fault the guy, food and physical affection are the best," Dean joked, then he turned around, rolling on top of Cas. "Don't you think?" Cas laughed, raising his hands to hold Dean's face.
"Jack? Dean's here!" Cas called. They all listened for a reaction, which followed a couple of seconds later. There was a thump from upstairs and then the sound of feet hurrying down the stairs. Jack showed up in the door to the kitchen with a smile. He held up his hand.
"Dumah, hello," he said and moved to the side to let her in. But Dumah didn't move from her spot, silently rejecting his invitation.
“Just have a look around, maybe you find the perfect ring right away. And just because you have the ring, doesn’t mean you’ll have to ask yet,” Sam said, which Dean supposed was a good enough argument, so he let himself be pulled into the store as well. Dean didn’t end up finding the perfect ring and had absolutely no idea what the perfect ring even was, but he knew, for sure, that he had to find it.
"Ah hell," he said, his voice coming out as a whine, when he sat down next to Cas, who was already looking out of the little window, even though there was nothing for him to see. Sam was in the row behind them, looking amused.
"You would be surprised," Castiel said, distractedly but he couldn't even enjoy Dean's baffled silence, because the magic reacted, the familiar feeling of Sam blooming across Castiel's awareness and tugging at him. "It is Sam's blood."
Knowing Dean firmly in the realm of sleep, Castiel got up. Something was on the periphery of his awareness, nothing evil, but the apprehension remained. He put on his cloak and stepped out of the hut. He and Dean were still on their journey to find Sam. They had made it past the mountain pass, a dangerous stretch of their path was behind them for the moment. In the valley they had crossed over the ancient border stones, back into a small pocket of Winchester land, nestled comfortably, sleepy and almost forgotten surrounded by magic. Soon they would go back into the wild, but tonight Castiel knew Dean to be safe.
He couldn’t ask Sam or Dean for advice, because he had lied to them. He had used his powers and he had told Sam that nothing had happened. Jack had fixed it, but now that he had thought about it some more, he was pretty sure that it still counted as “something” to Sam. No… he couldn’t talk to them about it.
Castiel however was smiling, his eyes wide, taking it all in with wonder and rare excitement. That at least made it a bit better. But only marginally, because then they were at their seats and Dean wondered how dreadful it would be if he turned around and ran for his life.
"Is she gone?"
"Charlie," Castiel said once he recognized her and smiled at her, the first smile Dean saw. He was too absorbed by it to notice that Charlie was swatting at his shoulder.
"What's so funny?" Cas wondered, his voice low, so as not to disturb the beautiful sound of Dean's laughter.
“Well, lets put them on. I smell take out so this seems like a good moment to relax and eat on the couch.” Dean really must be in a good mood to allow eating on the couch but Cas wasn’t going to ruin it with a comment about Dean’s usual no food on the couch rule. Dean dashed off to put away his suitcase and Cas took the moment to undress and put on the robe (it was very fluffy) before he prepared the food in the living room.
"What is it?" he asked, tilting his head. Dean shrugged, chuckling to himself.
"There."
"How did you find me?"
“Do you want to go in?” John asked, startling Dean. Of course, he wasn’t here alone and shouldn’t be spacing out like that but Sam was grinning at Dean and his dad wore a small smile too. And suddenly Dean felt himself blushing.
They stopped at a motel once it started getting dark.
"And miss one evening with you? No way," he said and wrapped his arms around Cas, kissing him again, but with big, noisy kisses all over his face. Cas had to laugh, half-heartedly pushing Dean away, but eventually he gave up and let himself be showered in kisses.
"Oh… That's nice," Cas said and even though he knew he should try harder, he had a hard time concealing his disappointment. He felt Dean's hand press against the small of his back, a comforting weight, that at least allowed him to smile at his son. Jack's bright smile dimmed however. A small frown appeared on his brow and he put down his phone.
"Alright," Dean said, reaching out with both arms to put his hands on Castiel's upper arms. It was such a comforting gesture to Cas by now, that he leant a bit forward instinctively, a clear invitation that Dean took. He pulled him close into a hug and kissed the side of his face. "I would like it if you wore something else from time to time, just to make you feel more… I don't know. Part of it all."
Then Cas was pressing close to him, crowding him against the door. It was unusual for Cas to take the initiative, but Dean didn't mind at all to have Cas' lips on him and his slightly chilled fingers framing his face.
It seemed careless for a hunter to leave all of his things out in the open. To the trained eye, it was obvious that Dean was a hunter. Though most people would only see strange symbols and weapons stuffed in a duffle bag.
"There's a reason why my family doesn't usually reside here," Castiel said from the bed, as Dean stood by the window, looking out into the dark sheets of rain coming down on the landscape. The wind made the rain hit the window heavily. No training today unless Dean wanted it to end up in another mud wrestling session. He turned away from the window with a sigh, watching Castiel sit up. He watched him lean forwards, bending close to his legs, while the shadows of his wings stretched wide. Dean had seen Cas wake up many times over the last weeks, but this view never ceased to amaze him.
"You know, if you make foreign dignitaries wait, you could at least offer them something to drink," he said loudly, catching the attention of at least some guards. They looked at each other, then finally he watched their eyes land on Castiel. Dean knew him well enough to see when he was sighing internally, but he did turn to the guards. He told them something in Enochian and one of them marched off after a beat.
Eventually their journey through the foggy hills came to a close. Dean saw the manor long before they reached the front gates. It looked big enough, a sturdy rectangular structure with many windows, but it certainly wasn't a prestige build. Nothing like the manor houses and castles Dean's family had all throughout the land. It looked rough and weathered, more like a building made to withstand the weather than one to showcase wealth and good artistic taste. The manor grounds didn't look all that spectacular either, though there was a small greenhouse and lots of vegetable plots, currently dormant due to the season. Clearly Castiel didn't care for a perfect representative lawn, fountains and sculptures to amble past on lazy, royal afternoons. What surprised Dean the most however, was the lack of spectators when they reached the manor.
Well, okay, he was very fond of and touchy about his space and his things, but anyone who had very little to their name would be that way. It had nothing to do with him being an alpha.
"But… this is the men's shelter, is it not?" The man shot him something of a distracted nod but the way he lifted his eyebrows at him seemed to suggest some form of complicated nonverbal communication. Cas had never been good at communication, even when he still had had all his angelic capacities.
It was tremendously stupid but at the same time it was the reason why he was such a great boyfriend.
"Castiel is on the list. He came to Raurica 15 years, so he's one of the earliest on my list. However, he is also one of the few that has a documented life before the move. It's actually pretty well documented the mid 80s, when his mother was murdered. Then a woman named Naomi Hawking became his legal guardian. It said in the records that she was Anna Novak's sister…"
"Well, other than you I
“I want to give you happiness, Cas. You deserve it. And I don’t know what exactly that happiness looks like… what it is that you thought you can’t have.”
"Contrary to what you must believe, I do have eyes. I know it doesn't look ridiculous," he told him. Luke chuckled some more, but then he looked at Cas with a pitying expression, still smiling at him.
Cas was human now and as he was sitting in a plastic chair of an appalling color (which was odd for him to even notice, Castiel had rarely had any kind of opinion on colors) he was disgruntled to learn that the way a human nervous system experienced pain wasn’t even the worst of it all.
“You defeated Chuck?” Cas asked incredulously.
"No, it doesn't. But depending on what kind of witch Anna was, he would have inherited her power… And think about it… You are in a town where you suspect witch activity."
"You could still just pretend that I knocked you up and then left you. Would make a tragic story about me being an utter bastard to you," Dean told him. Castiel narrowed his eyes at Dean, clearly disgruntled.
“Why?” Jack asked.
"You haven't been on a case with me for over a year, so how do you know what I do now?" Dean regretted his tone immediately. It was way too defensive and passive-aggressive. Unsurprisingly, Sam was silent for a beat.
"That dagger won't kill me," Cas said and the god nodded at this, but didn't take the blade when Cas held it out to him.
"Hey Jack," Dean called with a grin.
"You didn't have to be so rude to him, Sam," she admonished.
"What… just ripped off the body?" Dean asked, shuddering. "Supernatural creatures are just gross, man." Then he looked up at Cas who was buttoning the cuffs of his shirt. "No offense, babe."
"Are you just going to stare at each other?" Benny muttered next to Dean. Dean tore his eyes away from Cas, who looked as imposing as ever, sitting high up on his horse.
"And what if the shady politician was the target of the witch?"
Eventually, Gabriel took mercy on the humans, Dean especially. He turned to him, waving both of his hands at him.
"He can lick his damn wounds at home!" Dean hissed, then he pulled his phone out and frowned. "Or at least answer a text!"
"Back home I got out. I trained every day. Here I find it hard to even stay in shape," Dean complained without prompting. "I have far too much pent-up energy, man."
“That’s great news, Cas,” he said warmly and kissed Cas softly. “Are you relieved?”
I'm open for something new.
"Even grosser, but there's still no evidence that this is our kind of thing," Dean said. Sam lifted his hand towards Dean.
"Good, I'll have to start my day," Castiel said and rose from the table. The look he sent Dean was warm. "Thank you for having breakfast with me today. I hope to see you tomorrow?"
When the door to the Bunker opened with the loud shriek of hinges, it wasn't Cas who returned to him, but Sam and Mary.
"Wait… what?" was all he managed to say, even as he couldn't quite take his eyes off Cas' face, masochistically registering the downturn of his lips, the disappointment behind that frown.
"This is a sacrifice I would be willing to make if it meant that you and the children were safe," he promised. And he meant it. John lifted up Dean from where he was playing and brought him over to where Mary was still pacing. Mary looked at John and then at her children. It was this family that she chose all those years ago when the witch had asked her to choose. She would not allow anything to endanger it.
"Oh, good we don't need any introductions then! But I didn't expect less from a witch." Castiel didn't ever grace him with a smile.
"And like this you can tell us everything about how it was like to go to the beach without your trusty black trunks," Claire teased. Castiel rolled his eyes but it was mostly for show, since he was happy to be around his family and for them to be so supportive and loving.
"I'm a Seraph, a different kind of angel. We can also live thousands of years," he said which totally blew Dean's mind and he didn't even dare to ask him how long he'd been around. At least now it made sense that Anna held her position even though she hardly looked older than Sam. Dean's open-mouthed staring was cut short by Cas heaving a sigh. "But now I would just be glad to see this through…" Castiel wasn't looking at him, wistfully gazing out of the window instead. Dean felt a pang of regret and he wasn't sure if it was his own or if the Grace within him resonated with Cas' emotions. But no matter where it came from he actually did feel it too. This creature was meant to see Dean live and die, for him to become a figure in history books, then a legend, then a myth as Winchester eventually disappeared off the map and this time of humans on Elysium, that Cas had talked about, ended. It was a strange feeling, to consider his own history when confronted with a creature for whom 600 years were nothing. For whom maybe the 5 months they spent here would merely be insignificant, but Dean had cut into Cas' life, unknowingly.
“Fuller. Michael and I certainly have our work cut out for us for the next couple of centuries,” she said, but before Cas could ask what that meant she continued: “you’ve changed.” Naomi was almost squinting now as she looked at him though she clearly was trying to remain calm and collected.
"Alright. So if this is what Cas assumes it is, we should go interrogate the witness now," Dean said, nodding at Cas.
"The coffee is not sucky," he replied tersely. He was spared from saying more by Naomi focusing her eyes on Gabriel.
"Poor Clarence. All that angst for nothing," Meg said, then she turned to look at Dean. "He thought he couldn't please you if you were an omega as well. You know, the boy's got no imagination when it gets to sex."
"Yes, but I wanted to ask if it's okay if I bring Cas and maybe Jack? Cas said he'd like to meet you," he said. Mary, dramatic as she was, gasped.
"So… Milton, is that your last name?" Charlie wondered and now it was up to Dean to subtly reach out and pinch her side.
Dean kept sitting at his bedside, watching him sleep. Interestingly he snored softly. Eventually Dean put his hand on Cas' forehead, very mindful of the possibility that another zap of Grace would go through them both. But it didn't. Cas' forehead was cool to the touch, slightly clammy. Dean wiped his dark hair out of his face, studying Cas more closely.
Dean and Cas set out to establish a modified routine that gave them more time with each other. Both agreed that for the bond to work, they'd have to spend more time together. From the way Cas reacted, Dean got the impression that he wouldn't mind spending all day glued to Dean's side. But Cas still had to spend hours working and of course Dean was plenty busy himself (which wasn't entirely true, since he had none of his usual military or princely duties to attend to). So they had agreed to continue sharing breakfast and also meeting in the evenings for dinner and quite frequently also varying degrees of intimacy. Sex with Cas was, despite his initial misgivings, enjoyable. And easy enough. Most rewardingly though, Cas started to look way better in the mornings.
"Almost like he's going into battle," Hannah commented with a chuckle and Dean had to confess to himself it wasn't far off, at least it was how he felt. He looked at himself in the mirror, vaguely pleased with his reflection. Of course, his good mood only lasted for a moment, because when Hannah deemed him ready, he was led out of the room, Benny following diligently, to a waiting chariot. The last light of the day was fading as they were on the road towards Milton Heights, but he saw the cathedral up ahead, illuminated from within. There were some angels lingering outside, interested in seeing what was going on.
"Great!" Dean decided, gently slamming his hands onto the table before he got up to gather his papers.
"I don't think I understand. Do you need me to tutor him?" Zachariah shook his head.
"Yeah, we've dealt with cosmic balance before. Almost got all of creation snuffed out," Dean muttered and the god looked up at him, a hint of alarm on his face. Dean waved at him.
"The second question is easy to answer. What you do with Castiel's Grace will feed back into his. You using it automatically pulls on what is within Castiel to assist. If there were an even flow between you, this wouldn't harm him and it's common among angels in communion. The little pulse of Grace he got from your touch wasn't necessarily harmful either. It should have been good for him, but it irritated the remaining Grace's attempt at forming a barrier to block further draining. I must admit that it is a bit discouraging to see that you feeding back a tiny amount of Grace to him had a negative outcome. Maybe it's too late to hope to form a bond now," Flagstaff said. "In case you were considering it."
Cas made a little sound against Dean's lips when they touched.
"Can you be a bit more specific, here?" Bobby complained. "How many people are we talking?" Dean hoped he could bring some people with him, Benny and Garth, definitely. God, that would already make it so much better.
"Hm okay. So… consent is important," Jack summarized.
It lasted a minute, two, but then the spell broke and with it all the pent-up anger and frustration erupted.
"How?" he asked, opening his hand and holding it next to his head before he let it drop to his side as the obvious solution presented itself. "What about you?" he asked and Castiel lifted his eyebrow. "Can't you help?"
Claire had an idea. And she thought that while it was risky, it was actually a very good idea.
He had no idea where or when he was now, but he was unsettled by how quiet it was. Not a quiet that felt supernatural. He heard the wind, stirring the grass and swaying like dewy waves, and there was an occasional bird call, a flutter of wings accompanying a shadow passing over Dean's head. There was fog hanging over the fields, steaming up and blending into the pale sky that stretched, open and vast, all around Dean. This was the gentle quiet of empty landscapes that spoke of a total absence of people or streets with cars or even just planes flying overhead. Dean had a feeling why that was. Maybe he was wrong. He told himself that he could still be wrong, with each step that took him through the unpaved street with its gentle grooves that hinted at the occasional wagon passing through here. He passed a stone that lined the street, maybe a border stone. It had etchings not unlike the ones he had seen in the stone circle he had been transported to. He thought about sitting down on it for a second, to rest his feet, but something stopped him. It seemed almost… disrespectful to sit on it, which was ridiculous. It was just a stone. Dean had half a mind to spite that weird apprehension in his chest, eying the twigs and picked flowers that seemed to circle the stone, but then he looked up. The building he had seen was just up ahead, behind tilled but empty fields and a low stone wall. No need to sit down so close to his destination.
"Yeah, alright, just… think about doing some smiting and not just talking, alright?" Dean urged him, earning himself an eyeroll.
"Okay, it's on."
"What?" Cas asked, sounding disgruntled, when Dean couldn't hold back a chuckle. He turned his head to the side, frowning up at Dean.
"Good to see that a world outside of the mountain still exists," Benny joked, but after Dean shot him a little grin, his face became serious. "What's the plan? The army can go on, but we could use a breather once we're down this mountain. It would be bad to be locked into battle right at once." Dean nodded, his eyes trained on the village closest to them, probably not even a days' march ahead. From here on out their maps weren't very helpful. Even though Dean had decided on some potential places to set up camp, there was no telling how the terrain actually looked or how the kingdom here had changed in the last couple of centuries. It was more of a gamble than Dean was comfortable admitting. But he had had worse odds. Probably.
He unlocked his phone and his heart momentarily seized when he saw his chosen background, showing the Winchesters in the kitchen, eating. He breathed in evenly, trying to dispel the new wave of grief. He had to deal with that later, there was no sense in giving in to it now.
“Stop laughing, you dick,” he grumbled, putting away the groceries.
"I go where Naomi tells me to," Castiel answered with a frown which was met with Gabriel's dramatic groan. "In any case, it seems like they will arrange a mate for me so that I will be able to transfer." Gabriel choked on his bite of chocolate.
"Are you sure this is a good idea…?" Castiel asked, "maybe you should let it rest." Dean looked up at him, clearly surprised, but then he narrowed his eyes and Castiel could see the spark of suspicion in it. Castiel was too taken aback to push for it. Maybe a simple suggestion wasn't strong enough for the magic to force Dean to do Castiel's bidding.
"I don't want to get out of it," Cas admitted and looked up at Dean with that almost painful fondness. Instead of answering, Dean kissed Cas' forehead, then he kept his arm around him, sticking close to him. He didn't know how much time he still had with Cas, but he would try to make the most of it.
"While the spell I used on Dean was strong, it had no effect on Sam Winchester and he became suspicious and was able to sow seeds of doubt in Dean. I would have been able to handle the situation and keep my cover, but due to Raphael's interference I had to act."
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Winchester and Mr. Novak. I let you daughter go on ahead to get a first impression," she said. Dean and Cas exchanged a look. While Dean was puzzled, Cas had a good idea what was going on. His suspicions were confirmed when the real estate agent opened the door and Claire was there poking her head back into the foyer, grinning at them.
"Why are you here, Toni?" Dean finally asked. "The message came through Kendrick, but as far as I can tell this is not your fight." Lady Bevell raised her eyebrow at him for the informal address, though it wasn't like she was above forgoing his title. They were preparing to go into battle, an honorific was hardly the thing that mattered most if you were fighting for your life. "It's Winchester that borders on Enoch, we're the ones who are to be attacked."
"We grab beers together, we watch movies together, we make breakfast for each other! Whenever you're not currently in the wind because of… stuff, we even live together," he argued. "Everyone knows we're mates!"
"I want that too," he told him honestly. "More than anything." Castiel smiled at him with his usual adoring look when Dean released him. "Uhm. Yeah. Okay. I'll call my parents. But I must warn you; they've given up on pestering my brother and his girlfriend about grandkids. They might have abandoned all shame and ask you about it."
It had started with a cowboy hat, but actually, Cas only noticed that something had started at all, when a white bag was waiting for him on the middle of his unused bed. He had just left Dean's side after he had fallen asleep following their love making. Cas hadn't been home in a while, Jack's itching for hunting taking them further away from the bunker.
"Why is this a huge thing? Sex isn't a huge thing," he told her with a frown but Charlie rolled her eyes at him.
"Mom!"
"Is he going to be alright?" Dean finally dared to ask now that he no longer expected to be shushed instantly. Flagstaff turned towards him, studying him with her usual icy look.
"Hey, my car's here," he heard Dean call, when he walked towards the bus stop. He thought about being stubborn, but in the end he turned around and walked up to Dean, a glare on his face as he met Dean's eyes. Dean did look grim, but he also looked a bit uneasy. Good then.
"Can we have breakfast delivered to Cas' room?" he asked her and Hannah brought her hands together, far more delighted than she had any business being.
“Cat like reflexes!” he said, quite flustered, when Cas asked him if he was alright. But instead of going inside, he stalled, fiddling with the key. Castiel lifted his eyebrow at him. “The kid just took me by surprise!”
“You were?” Jack asked in surprise, momentarily distracted from eating his pancakes even though he really wanted to eat them. Castiel rolled his eyes at Dean, but then directed a smile at Jack.
When he watched the angels train now, it became easier to follow Uriel's moves. And then there were these… flickers. Like distortions in the air around the angels. It wasn't unlike how the air got in the heat of summer. Dean's brain couldn't make sense of it, but he still instinctively seemed to recognize it as the vague outlines of wings. Those flickers where big on some angels and smaller on others.
Dean smiled to himself when he thought of the man. It had been a while since Dean picked someone up during a case. It wasn't like he had spent the last couple of years in celibacy, but he had become weary. It was still fun to have one-night stands, but they no longer scratched the itch that he felt inside himself. He was tired of it, of the monotony, of loving them and leaving them. It was purely fun and Dean… well… What if there was more for him out there? What if he too could slowly move away from who he had been the last decades of his life? Sammy was untangling the net around him, casting off the past and the duty. And Dean? Why was he still doing this? Scanning the news for anything that sounded suspicious, driving across the country for nothing more than a headline, sleeping in crappy beds, eating bland food, digging up graves, bleeding, nursing it with alcohol and willing bodies, just to eventually die when he became too slow for the monsters?
"I don't know. I didn't really love him anymore… But I miss knowing that I will come back home from work to a family… Having to give up the house was a blow… Not having someone to help me through a heat is a nuisance…" Anna nodded sympathetically. "I suppose I'm just stressed."
"I can't… I can't believe that I'm reacting like this," he managed to say. "I can't control it. This is horrible…!" Dean couldn't even think what to say. He had done this, overcoming his paralyzing fear of flying, all so that Cas could see the sky again. Only for Cas to be just as terrified as him?!
"Eh, I think I'll pass," Dean decided and Castiel looked somewhat smug about it.
It wasn't like he wanted to be involved in endless and fruitless discussions anyway. But he was climbing the walls, the more days that passed. There was no way he could end up with some angel's twisted version of a trophy wife! He needed to find a way out of this.
"And then what?"
"Not family planning. We're not that far yet," Dean corrected but Ash shrugged.
"Yeah, whatever you have is fine!" Dean called distractedly, scribbling something on a notepad. Cas was a bit uneasy to have him at his back, but he filled the two glasses and took them to the couch. He didn't have a side table so he put a book on the couch and set the glasses down on it. It would do.
"I'm just saying, Cas! It's a curse! And no matter how hard you try, it's still there!"
"It was a set up… And someone wanted to get at Cas?"
"And they assume that angels did it?" Castiel wondered, but Mary shook her head.
"When I told father about you, he said that no self-respecting alpha would want dad now because he already had a kid. Apparently real alphas think that an omega loses appeal if they already had another alpha's child," Jack explained.
"Why?" Castiel asked.
Cas second alarm started ringing, letting him know that if he didn't get a move on, he'd have to go to work in his pajamas.
"Authorities shocked about the unexplained death of a young woman in her home in Beverly," Dean started reading. "Anna Novak (25) was found dead in her house after an anonymous tip alerted the local police. When they arrived at the scene, they found the woman dead in the living room, her throat slit. They also discovered her six-year-old son in the house, alive. He had survived an attempt on his life with injuries, but none of them life threatening. Police are investigating, but say that there is no apparent connection to the other unresolved deaths which had occurred during in the last couple of weeks. They are treating it as a robbery gone wrong and are looking for suspects."
"And uh… protection is also very important," Dean added, remembering Cas' text message. "Make sure to always use protection even if she says she doesn't want it. Believe me,
"No, I was made the old-fashioned way," the god told him with a wink. "And both of my parents are alive."
“Cas,” he started. “That’s just it. I’m ready for it to change.” Cas stared up at him, awed and unable to say anything. He took note of how slow Dean was when he leaned in closer, watching for Cas’ reaction but whatever he was looking for, he must have found it because he leaned in and then his lips covered Cas’. It was a soft touch and it almost sent Cas to his knees. Dean drew back and studied Cas. But then he grinned.
"I will be, Charlie. I promise," he assured her. She clearly hesitated to hang up, uncomfortable to leave Dean alone in what she must consider a dangerous situation. Eventually she wished him a good night and Dean was left to his own thoughts again.
? Do you
"Oh… Oh yes," Cas said and held out a hand to the table. He let Dean browse the selection and took the moment to watch the man. Cas himself didn't come in the typical omega packaging, too tall, too scruffy, but this man did look all alpha.
"That's no way to speak to your parents!" John bellowed, though despite his anger, Dean could see the shame, he could see it in his face, in how Bobby pulled the hat into his face, how Mary turned away when he looked at her.
"Yeah. I compared the list," Dean said and motioned to the pages Sam was leafing through. "We've got four items still missing." He pulled the sheets out of Sam's hands, his brother's protests ignored. "And I don't know if it's chance or if the Brits are just kinky motherfuckers. The items they got were all marked down as sex and love related."
"Maybe you've dealt with human sacrifices before, but Cas is an angel! What makes you think that you can even handle his Grace?" Dean challenged. To his surprise the god started laughing.
"Both of our boys got scholarships and went to Stanford," Mary said proudly. "Very far away but I think both of them enjoyed it."
"More human, you mean," Castiel added, resting his head on Dean's shoulder. How wonderful it was to be wrapped up in Dean's arms, how lovely he smelled.
The inn looked quite nice, especially for such a remote place that probably didn't have a lot of visitors. It wasn't very big, but it looked well-kept. And most importantly, Bobby was standing on the porch, drinking out of a bottle.
She'd say "Child, beware of the wanderers", in hushed tones, her scent cold but familiar, like the pine forest covered in snow. The other children in the square often shrieked the tunes of the Wanderer's Song to tease, when one of the men in heavy fur coats and with bulging bags that reeked of foul magic and blood, came through the village to stock up for their journeys.
“All that power, Dean,” he started and Dean shifted slightly on his knees. Castiel observed the movement, but there was still enough of that small mad spark in his eyes that kept Dean on the floor. “I’ve risked everything for it. I’ve risked everything for
"Then Tom… Tom took matters into his own hands. He got an axe and he…" Drought swallowed thickly. "She just kept on laughing as he chopped her apart. And there was no blood when Tom returned. She was really just… Something else. And we thought this spooky business was over but… Next thing we know she's at our table, getting into a pack of peanuts. We decided to leave together, but she wouldn't… She wouldn't let us go. It became clear that she wanted one of us to stay behind. And Tom, shit… No idea how he could stand it, but he had always been the brave one. We ran but once we put some distance between us, we turned around to look and Tom was just this… mass on the floor and she… She killed him! Fuck! That's just crazy!"
"It was cheese. Greasy cheese." Dean rubbed his palm over his face.
"You're not, Cas. You've been nothing but accommodating. And it's not like it was before. I know you now, I know that you care."
"And now you're no longer married but Cas is here. Sounds like a good situation to examine your feelings, right?" Dean sighed. "What is the problem?"
doing IT for a little bar, but now he runs an indie game company called the Roadhouse. They've continuously expanded and it's really taken off. I can vouch for them, Dean. They do great stuff. Diverse staff, super work environment, cool projects."
"Well then, I want to be returned home," he said, knowing fully well that he was playing a dangerous gamble. He had no idea how Anna would tolerate him talking back to her. Anna didn't seem to mind at all.
"Are you sure that you want this, Cas? He's an alpha. You probably won't just be a cheap housekeeper but might also be expected to perform… Well, sexual favors."
"You're looking for a kitsune by the way. I'm sure you'd figure it out, smart as you are, but I killed him for you. You're welcome."
"Cas. I love you. I want to be your alpha!" The words came out in an embarrassing rush and it was probably not very romantic to scream those things at Cas, but Cas… Cas seemed elated. At first he stared at him blankly, but then he started smiling brightly.
"Of course," Lucifer said with a grin. "It was a pleasure to have met you two." Dean could barely bring himself to put on a smile and incline his head into the hint of a bow, before Castiel turned around to leave.
"Why should there be complaints?" Cas asked, which had Dean halt his hand wringing.  He lifted his eyebrow at Cas, then he dropped his gaze down at their dicks.
"What? Good night? We were having a talk about babies and you just say good night?" Dean asked, wrapping his arms around Cas to pull him close. Cas started laughing once Dean kissed him all over his face. "This is a highly emotional moment for me!"
"For some people the relationships they make at work are all they have," Castiel admonished and Gabriel looked at him somewhat chastised.
"Sam, this doesn't prove anything," Dean grumbled and even though Castiel strained to see him, Sam was still firmly blocking sight of Dean.
"Yes, you were," Cas assured him contently, turning around to watch Dean rummage around his suitcase, still naked from his shower. Dean raised his head and winked at him.
"Fuck."
“Honey I’m home!” Dean called through the house, clearly in a very good mood. “And I’ve brought some goodies!” Cas met him in the hallway, finding Dean with his suitcase and a bag with the Roadhouse logo.
You must see, there is a very specific reason why Mary chose to seek his help. There were witches all throughout the lands, at least there were at the time. Good witches and bad witches and everything in between. Kingdoms of old chose to secure the services of a witch for a variety of benefits. Witches who you chose to affiliate yourself with as a king or a queen could make or break a kingdom.
"Dean told us you're starting college this fall. What college did you decide on?" John wanted to know.
"This is stupid and unwise. And not befitting a future king," Cas said harshly.
"Bye!" she called and the angels who were tasked with accompanying them over the Toes took this as their sign to start moving.
They arrived in front of big doors, which Uriel opened for them. They led into a light-flooded, wide corridor. The floors were polished woods, the walls paneled in white with golden trips, grander than the exterior and the entrance hall would have led Dean to believe.
"I haven't met this Naomi either, I think."
Dean watched them go with mixed feelings. He knew it was the right signal to Winchester, and maybe also to any angels who was watching, to send them ahead. But now Dean's days would narrow down considerably. He turned to look at Castiel, who was bouncing Jack slightly, but he was looking at Dean too. His expression was very soft, so Dean put his hand around his shoulder and pulled him close, kissing him.
"No, dumbass. I know you're good, but I don't have to come all the way here to get magic when my case is halfway across the country," he said, then he took a step closer, so he could kiss Castiel sweetly. "I never wanted to leave you. I wanted to stay right here…"
"John and Mary have been together since they were 17. Sam and his sweetheart Jess have been together since they were 19. Dean's merely the odd one out simply because he had shorter relationships."
"I doubt that," Cas answered with a snort, but he was intrigued.
"This is balm for my soul," the god said with a cheeky grin.
"Why don't you show me your new room?" Luke suggested to Jack, who was immediately on board. With Jack carrying his present and the rest of his luggage being spread between his parents and Dean, they got into the dorm building. It looked nice to Cas and even though it was very busy with parents and family helping their kids move in, it didn't feel too terribly crowded. According to the info Cas had, Jack would be in a male only dorm, with both alpha and beta students.
"I heard of the perfect job opening for you!" she said. Dean groaned. First Jack and now Charlie again?
"It's always good to have the opinion of a local if you're investigating in a small town. And you don't exactly seem like a chatterbox, so I trust that you keep the progress of the investigation to yourself," Dean said and Castiel tried for a smile. "Relax, babe!" Dean said with a laugh, "we're not talking about gruesome murders but possibly insurance fraud!" Castiel nodded, willing himself to relax.
"Well? Will you not introduce me to my first and potentially only grandchild?" she said. Cas still seemed stunned, but at this he jumped up and walked out of the room. The moment he was gone Dean could see the change in Naomi. Her shoulders slumped and she sighed, letting herself drop down into an armchair.
The building he had seen from the hill proved to be a church or a monastery. Up close it looked to be old, but not too worn. Well taken care of, almost like it had just been built despite it giving Dean an ancient vibe. The brass plate next to the gate identified it as St. Michael.
"Huh," Dean said. Cas' cheek felt warm and soft underneath his palm and some sort of pleasant thrum when through Dean, like a light tingling in his chest. Castiel's eyes were wide and expectant. Dean moved his thumb, brushing it softly over the corner of Castiel's lips. He kept his eyes on them now, tracing the movement of his thumb, across Cas' lower lip, wondering what it was like to kiss him.
Dean would love to punch that guy in the face.
"There is no court witch. This is a realm without magic," she said with contempt. At this point a friend of Lady Harvelle was wise and courageous enough to pull her back, so that she couldn't accidentally offend Gabriel enough to be turned into a frog.
"Why didn't you punish Raphael?" Castiel demanded to know.
He was glad that the people of Lebanon seemed to be alright and blissfully oblivious that the end of the world was threatening yet again. So whatever Chuck had been doing, it wasn’t apocalyptic yet.
"Working this issue from here is not doing nothing," Cas chastised him but Dean was definitely running out of patience for this.

"I wouldn't make my own brother kneel for me!" Sam frowned at him, the words registering slowly. His nose wrinkled, then he looked up at Cas for confirmation.
"Maybe we'll leave earlier, depends on what Jack's up to." Mary agreed easily and after saying their goody-byes Dean hung up the phone. Cas came back out onto the balcony not long after, looking at his phone, typing.
“My dad made it. When I told him that you were probably shivering down here without heat – and I was right – he made us a pie.”
"It was my mother's… She wore it every day," he said, confirming Dean's suspicions. "Why were you in my jewelry box?" Cas asked, reaching out but Dean instinctively pulled his hand away. A small frown creased Cas' forehead and Dean shook his head.
"You're just two people, why do you need a house?" Jimmy asked suspiciously, when he came around to help Cas pack up his apartment to put it into storage until the move. Castiel faltered in his cleaning out of his closet, unsure how to answer. He barely had any time to actually processed the fact that he and Dean decided to have children together. They had only talked about it a couple of days ago and neither of them had brought the topic back up since Thanksgiving.
"I suppose?" Castiel retorted which wasn't really helpful. What Cas said next made Dean suck in a sharp breath: "You're a god."
"Can you send me back?" he asked in probably not quite grammatically correct Latin. Chuck stopped his fidgeting and stared at Dean, at least this time not like Dean was a raving madman. "Come on, Chuck! What am I doing here?" The Latin didn't really seem to help, because Chuck continued to look bewildered by Dean's questions. His gaze dropped down to the many bottles of wine he carried, as if he was wondering if he was drunk and imagining this all. Dean wondered the same the longer this continued on. Time to change tracks.
"Okay, alright."
Despite Dean's refusal to consummate the marriage, Cas felt that he had gotten closer to Dean over the months. As he had told Gabriel, he had hoped for a friendship.
"What the hell happened out there, Dean?" John demanded and Dean pulled his shirt sleeve down over his weird burn again, biting back a hiss.
"What do you expect?" Dean asked tensely, finally looking up at Benny. "I have to figure out something, before I have to endure the wedding night, or the breeding, or whatever shit the angels are going to do with me!" Benny winced in sympathy. "Not with me, Benny, I'll make it hard for them!"
Cas was something different. When he first walked into the café, Cas hadn't really stood out to him all that much. Sure, he was cute, but not the type he usually went for when he was looking for an easy hook up. But then he came back and Cas was still cute and interested, so why not? Dean was glad that he'd have a sudden rush of optimism and courage, which made him push through his reservations and go for it. Being close to him felt… good. Comfortable, safe. Like he could finally rest and breathe and maybe open up a bit. And he saw that he had the same effect on Cas. They were good for each other and damn the bad bed and the wasted money on a dead-end case if it meant being close to him.
"Or maybe I just took a chance," he said. Dean grabbed Cas' waist, grinning up at him.

"I guess I'm not," he agreed and when Charlie held out two wooden training swords with a grin, he sighed and took one. "Have you ever trained before?"
“Sure. If you let me crash on your couch afterwards.” Jimmy promised that the couch was all his and then their plans were made.
"Can you be a bit more specific?" Dean asked, but he gave a sign to Benny to alert some of the other knights to accompany him. It would be too foolish to go in without his guard, even if Garth thought it was safe.
Dean was probably getting ahead of himself, checking his impulses to simply let go around him. It was dangerous. Dean had been two decades younger and far less experienced when he last was in a similar situation where he wanted to unload on someone. Cassie hadn't reacted well and there was no guarantee that Cas would be any different. You simply didn't tell civilians the truth - unless the truth found them first.
"I will let Metatron know so he can announce it formally to the kings," the woman said to Castiel, ignoring Dean completely. "The process will take time, hopefully enough for you to do whatever it is you think you have to do here."
not interested? He looked at Dean's face again. Ah, screw it. It couldn't hurt.
"You take great risks for this," Castiel said and then he looked at the child. "For Dean." Bobby shrugged, slightly jostling the boy, who didn't complain, having fallen back asleep.
"Not grocery shopping! Cas is gonna go on vacation soon, right? And I just think he should buy himself a nice new outfit for it! You know, to wear to the beach!" Castiel watched his son's carefree chewing slow down, as he mulled it over. He clearly was intrigued. "Do you remember when your dad last bought something nice for himself?"
"Lucifer will one day be High King," Uriel continued, calling Dean out of his thoughts. The angel eyed him. "And he showed some interest in Cas. It would have been better to go to his court and be open to the idea of communion and marriage to a High King. Instead he's shackled to an ungrateful worm like you." With that Uriel turned around and walked away briskly.
it. They meddled with the Balance and it blew up in their faces, didn’t it?” Cas glared at him. “Take it and leave. It’ll fall into place as soon as the undoing is… well… undone.”
"It's not my first cross universe journey. Though last time it's been pretty disturbing to meet my alternative self. I always thought it best that our worlds don't mix too much."
“Undress yourself,” Dean ordered and Castiel complied. There wasn’t much he was still wearing and in a matter of moments he was lying on the floor, naked. “Good. Undress me,” he continued and Castiel sat up. His hands were warm against Dean’s skin when he pulled his clothes off. Castiel wasn’t particularly gentle, tugging and pulling and fingers digging into exposed flesh, raising goosebumps and leaving behind imprints of heat that made the rest of Dean’s body long for more. Castiel pulled Dean’s underwear off, past Dean’s legs, and tossed it over his shoulder with an impatient expression. Then he sat on his hunches and just looked at Dean.
"Ready?" the god said and then nodded his head towards the flames.
The journey across Michael's Toes continued on. They found further towns, more watch towers, some ancient enough that there were only ruins left over to be worn away by time. They saw nothing of angels, only birds and bad weather, that made Dean want to get off the mountain even more. The calls of birds seemed to follow them wherever they went, eerie in the dense fog, as if they had stepped in as sentries of the Toes after the angels had disappeared.
"Guys, I'd love to hang out, but I really should get back to my own world," he said, causing the bickering to die down at once. His counterpart studied him, his eyes gleaming bright.
"Rogue soldiers maybe?" Dean suggested. Castiel pondered that, pressing his fingers to his mouth.
"I just told you?" Dean asked with a smile. "I'm paying a visit. Checking on you and the egg."
," Cas said, using finger quotes.
"Of course, Jack. I always will, no matter where you are or where I am," Cas promised. Jack smiled at him, happy and pleased. Cas was relieved to know that Jack would be alright, even though it still pained him to move away from him.
"And? You nervous, kid?" Dean asked.
"So… Your mom's gone," he started, then he pulled his hand up, fingers digging into the fabric of his shirt and pulling it out of his trousers.
"I couldn't control where we would pop up. I didn't want to startle people with this dude," Gabriel said then he lifted his hands. "So now you just have a weird twin brother, congratulations!" Gabriel clapped the god on the back. "Call me when you need me. I'm going to check out the sights and by that I mean pick up some ladies." With that he disappeared. The god finally pulled his glasses down, frowning at them. Then he looked down at himself, pulling at his shirt.
"Dean… please," Cas begged. Three fingers did go in with a little bit of resistance but Cas seemed loose and slick enough.
"We're ready to depart," Cas said, then he easily got on top of his horse, the shimmering shadow of his wings settling comfortably behind him.
." Dean merely shrugged. Anael looked at him for a while longer, but then she shrugged as well.
"Do you think I want that?" Dean asked but when he only got a blank look in return, he sighed. "I don't want that, Cas. I have been a hunter because I couldn't do anything else. I grew up wandering but I never loved it. Why do you think I kept coming back to you all the time?"
"None taken."
"Let's keep that for when we're actually coming face to face with those bastards," Dean said and Benny joined in his laughter. Dean heard a scoff from somewhere behind him and when both of them turned around they saw Lady Bevell and others from the Houses of Kendrick riding behind them, and more than one of them wore disturbed faces.
"This is Milton Manor," Castiel explained without looking at the building behind him. If he was proud of the place he certainly didn't plan on showing it.
Dean looked at Cas and found him looking up disquieted.
"You hold a unique position in your country. Not only are you the crown prince and your parents are adamant about it being you to sit on the throne eventually, but you are also an accomplished knight and the leader of the armies. If you died it would be a huge blow to your kingdom."
"You'd drive to Dayton?"
"Yes," Cas said, "but I think we should do that without our clothes on," he added. Dean chuckled, then he dipped back down, capturing Cas' lips again. Despite Cas' insistence that they should lose what little they still wore, he seemed to be in no hurry to actually do anything about it. Dean enjoyed grinding against him and feel Cas' hands on him. He didn't exactly let them stray much, but he was holding on to him firmly, pulling him closer, then almost digging his fingers in, then lightly rubbing circles into his shoulders. One of his hands eventually travelled up a bit, fitting his right hand over the handprint that had left a permanent mark on Dean. Castiel sighed, but then his hands started moving again to touch the side of his neck, then his fingers swept upwards into Dean's hair. Cas wasn't tugging, which was good because it wasn't exactly Dean's thing, but he was lightly dragging his nails through his roots. Dean's hair was definitely still too long, despite Charlie's attempts at cutting it, but he didn't mind it now that Cas was playing with it.
Dean sat back in his chair, knuckles pressed against his lips, thinking.
There was a knock on the door a moment later and Hannah came inside. She held a letter in her hand.
Work didn’t feel less tedious and gloomy as winter progressed. It got darker and darker, the light bulbs the only glimmer in the dark when the day was dull and over far too soon. It was also cold down here and the radiator almost drowned out Emma’s music with its clicking and puttering.
“Jack?”
"Yeah, but he has been skinned! And the skin was nailed to the cabin's outside wall. Like.., a warning!" Jack continued, his voice still holding that excited edge that he usually got when he was talking about hunting.
Over night, Castiel had plenty of time to think, but by the time Dean was ready to go, Castiel was still in the middle of a crisis. He had nothing packed at all, dressed in his robes and an apron he had used while preparing bread. It still was flour stained. He blinked out into the morning sun owlishly. Prince Dean was saddling his horse but when he noticed Castiel he tsked.
Cas had texted after Dean failed to pick up his phone.
“He took his time to do this?”
"Yeah! You reading alpha health magazines now, Cas?" Dean teased. "Luke didn't actually look like he would be into that stuff."
Dean was sitting in the driver's seat, one hand on the steering wheel, the other holding a phone to his ear. He was talking and only when Cas came closer, did he notice him from the corner of his eye. He seemed to be alright, though there was surprise written over his face. Castiel approached, but then suddenly a shiver ran down his spine as he got close enough for the magic to shine through the warding.
So, Dean didn't treat Cas like an alpha might treat his omega. Hell, other than the occasional staring at Cas for too long and emotional confessions wrangled out of them under threat of imminent death, he actually didn't treat him like
He followed the road, feeling the uneven pavement under his bare feet. It wasn’t exactly comfortable, but he had enough of his Grace that it didn’t really hurt. Cas couldn’t quite feel his Grace, but he had been mostly drained for years now, so he wasn’t too worried about it.
"Late night?" Anna asked, popping up next to him pretty much out of the blue. Dean must have been more out of it than he thought. Dean didn't reply at first but Anna seemed content to just ride next to him. She did seem kind and while it might all be an act to lure Dean in a false sense of security, he still had questions that he didn't trust any of the other angels with.
"I do talk to people! But last I heard Dr. Badass, or Ash whatever, was doing IT for a little bar in Nebraska," he said. "Besides, I'm not in the habit of talking about IRL background stuff when I'm LARPing. You know I stay in character!"
"No." Both brothers looked towards Cas even as he refused to meet their eyes. "If you tried to kill Raphael the entire coven would retaliate. You can't fight an entire coven. It's not safe for you. You should leave."
"Not particularly? I can tell you all about myself in 30 seconds if that makes you feel better," Dean told him.
"Whatever… Do you know anything a bit more personal about him? Like what his favorite food is? Or whether he'll want children?" Dean tensed at that. Children. There was no way that he had time for children. And since all of this happened so that Novak could work at HQ, it was unlikely that they wanted him to miss work because of a child.
“Of what it would do to us as a family if you really had no soul.”

"Fine, fine. I did my work. Now you can have your romantic alpha-omega meet cute moment," she said and then she winked at Cas. When she was gone, Castiel heaved a sigh.
"If I weren't worried, I'd say something about how romantic this is. A chase through the fields," Dean said, as he urged the horse out into the open space. He had easily found the hidden path through the high grass. "You and me, on a horse. Wind in our hair."
"Why? I'm eating my veggies. In fact, half my plate is veggies."
"Now it got just a bit weirder," Dean muttered to himself, looking at the god lifting his leg to study the soles of his boots. Dean shook his head, then he pulled his phone out of his pocket. Now that he had service again his screen lit up with a dozen missed calls from Sam and his mother. And Cas. He opened his texts.
But Dean did stir not long after.
"You said you didn't want this… I thought I'd respect your decision," Castiel told him, but handed Jack over to Dean.
"It's not about following you to the land of angels," Benny said, but when Dean walked on, he put his hand on his shoulder, stopping him. "Hey," he called, pulling at Dean so he turned around to face him. "It's about following you, Dean," he said earnestly. "It's about friendship and loyalty."
didn't want me to work anymore when I got pregnant. And to be honest, I didn't mind that much at first. Once Jack hit puberty my ex decided that our alpha son would be better off without being coddled by an omega parent all the time."
It was a universally acknowledged truth that dragons were not especially renowned for their hosting abilities or willingness to entertain guests in their dwellings. Apparently, Dean wasn't aware of this.
"Yeah… I mean I didn't have a good time back at work recently… But I think it was just all the driving… I'm sure I'd have a better time at work if I didn't have to worry about that," Dean said. Castiel studied him, a small frown on his face.
"Is it… customary to get down on my knees when giving you an answer?" Castiel asked, slowly bending his knees but Dean laughed, giving his hand a squeeze.
He had to take matters into his own hands.
"Don't worry. If Cas likes it, I'll be the one to take him sky-diving," Sam promised and Dean's stomach lurched at the very idea of getting into a plane just to jump out of it.
“No…” Dean agreed and bit back a groan when Castiel placed himself against the tip of Dean’s dick and pushed slightly, not enough for Dean to slip in, but enough for Dean to feel the resistance and tension of Castiel’s body. “Not now… But maybe later.” He kissed the hopeful look off Castiel’s face. “Get started. I want to see you fuck yourself on my dick.” Castiel screwed his eyes shut and Dean felt himself slip just a little bit into Cas.
"Yes," Cas moaned and Dean would be lying if that didn't go straight to his dick with a sort of intensity that he hadn't expected.
"Of course," Dean assured her.
birthday. I have failed Sam." He looked at Dean, then at the hospital corridor they were in. "I have failed the people in this city. All the good I'm trying to do… It's pointless…"
"No, I'm an angel," he said, leaving Drought staring after them with an open mouth.
"On a full stomach?"
Beloved…? Had Dean heard that right?
"You do know that omegas are perfectly capable of pleasuring other omegas. And they can get them through a heat comfortably," Meg told him and Cas' face heated up. "It's not rocket science, Clarence. If you don't want to use your dick there's plenty of toy options. All good sex needs communication and exploration of boundaries. Don't believe all that porn tells you."
"Maybe this is a good moment for you to get settled in your rooms? You will stay overnight, right?" John asked and Dean nodded.
"I'd like that. I'd like that a lot," Cas told him.
Dean gave up trying to do this with his mind first, letting his instincts take over. This was a bond seeking to be completed, so he just let it take over and guide him. He wasn't trying to hold back with caresses, and neither with the rough and quick pace that made him chase release. Cas seemed to be way beyond forming words and Dean at least had enough presence of mind to wrap his hand around Cas' dick and jerk him to a quick orgasm, no finesse, all intensity. Cas tensed under him, his fingers digging into Dean's back before he threw his head back to gasp soundlessly, shaking through his orgasm. Dean wasn't far behind, chasing it quickly. It took barely anything for him to push in deep and let his orgasm white out all thought and leave behind nothing but raw bliss. He felt energy course through him, like something inside of him just burst open and he heard whispers in the back of his head but everything was fuzzy and overwhelming, an intense weight pressing in on him, pressing against his mind with tiny tingling fingers of intent. He felt a rush of sadness and longing, with little glimmering bits of elation. And then it disappeared, like a window slamming shut, leaving the raging storm outside.
"That was the last item on the list of things those dicks stole," Dean said, taking a step back and admiring the high wooden shelves loaded with boxes. He was only human but he has enough instincts to feel the magic in the air.
birthday today? Someone called Samuel?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"This is a fricking stave church?!" Dean asked and looked at the wooden structure before him. "A pagan god lives in a church? Isn't that weird?"
Something in Dean seemed to settle.
“We should do our parenting together, which means that Sam and Dean can’t just leave you all alone without consulting with me first. I would have said no.” Jack shrugged, not really understanding the issue, but he had more important matters to attend to now; his pancakes.
"Yes I do," Cas said and with a heavy sigh, he finally let go of Jack, though the boy didn't really go far, happily remaining within Cas' personal space. "I know that is a very important part of your life, a start of something new, but it's hard to see this as anything but an ending for me."
"Of course. I can't let it be unsupervised." Dean lifted an eyebrow.
Secretly, Dean believed that the fact that Chuck had allowed it, or simply not cared enough about Cas to fix it, was what had made it worse.
"The thing is that this mountain range is called The Aeries, but actually Aeries is also the name of old angelic mountain towns. There's one just up," Garth said. And sure enough, once the road took a turn Dean found a little tower perched on the edge of an overhang. The ground beyond that was even as they had clearly reached a plateau. Built into the side of mountain were buildings with wooden shutters, and small balconies. Narrow stone steps led higher up were more houses were. It looked rather interesting, but it was clearly abandoned. Dean lifted his hand and the members of his guard fanned out, exploring. Dean approached the watch tower, his eyes alert and hand around the hilt of his sword. The door was of heavy wood and dark metal but when Dean pushed against it, it opened on silent hinges. He held his breath, but when nothing came at him, he grabbed a torch out of his pack, pressed the button to get the magic circuit running and shone the beam into the room. Light still came in from the narrow windows. It was chilly inside but relatively well protected from the wind. The watch tower was still furnished with a table and chairs and some benches that might have served as makeshift beds. A thick layer of dust and some stray, dry foliage was scattered on the ground and over the furniture, but it didn't look like this place had been abandoned because it had been under attack. He shone his torch at the ladder leading to the upper floor. He grabbed the wood with one hand and gave it a firm shake. He didn't know if it would hold his weight but it looked sturdy enough. He put the torch into his pocket and climbed up. The upper room was bare apart from a table and a chair that stood against the wall that had no windows, as it faced the mountain. There was one big window front showing towards Winchester and a telescope positioned there. Dean approached the window and looked out. He could see down the mountain, at the entire army that was waiting for a sign to move, totally unprotected from attack. Dean had a queasy feeling about that, but then he got to the telescope and looked through. He could see the low land and if he positioned the telescope just right, he could even see Eye Campbell that they had left almost a week ago now. Dean frowned. When had the angels given up this Aerie? Clearly, they had used it to keep an eye on the humans or else there would have been no need for a telescope that showed human fortresses.
"So you said, but surely such a bond doesn't come without difficulties. It sounds intense and at least one of the angels didn't have any say in the matter," Dean wondered. Naomi pondered that for a moment but then she nodded.
"I… suppose so," he said and then he straightened up. "My name is Cas. What is yours?"
While Castiel was cautious for a while, he soon relaxed as the man read a newspaper and had his pie and coffee. The storm was still going strong outside, howling and beating rain against the windows. It had dimmed down more and no new guests stumbled into the café, not that Castiel had expected any. Or wanted them, for that matter. The stranger seemed content to relax, getting more coffee, waiting out the rain. Once it was almost time for closing, he called for Castiel to pay.
“But you will?”
"The abbot does have some vices, but he is not a bad person," Castiel assured him. Dean had to remind himself that this was not his universe.
"Luke only approved of roses," Cas explained, as he trailed after them. "I like roses, but after 20 years you kind of wish you could see something else for once. Sunflowers maybe." Cas turned to Dean, who was still kind of taken aback by the easy way Jack was still holding on to him. Did 18-year-old alpha boys do that? He really couldn't remember him still holding hands with adults at that age. "Jack's very tactile. If you don't like it just let him know," Cas whispered. "He seems to be drawn to you especially."
"Cool! Thank you!" Jack announced, then he showed it to Cas. "Look, dad!"
"Yes," Castiel agreed and when Dean looked at him, Cas was smiling at him fondly. "This world needs you just the way you are," he said and it wasn't just Dean's imagination that Cas' cheeks were slightly rose tinted. Before Dean's face could get too embarrassingly dopey, Cas turned away to look at Sam and Mary. Dean felt somewhat drunk with feelings, so in a bout of madness he took a hold of Castiel's hand. Castiel gave it a squeeze. "All of you make it a better place."
"Anna does things how she feels they are needed to be done. I'm sure if she made a spectacle out of it, then it was for the benefit of your parents," Castiel answered promptly. "In any case, how to receive you is up to me. And my stance is that an actual war between our races should be avoided at all cost." Dean lifted his eyebrow.
He would be laughing if he weren't trapped in this plane.
"That's great, exactly what we need! And now, profile is done! We just have to wait and see!"
"I'm sorry to interrupt you, but this just came by messenger," she said and Castiel rose from his chair, somewhat alarmed by her expression. "It's from Lucifer."
"The son who is now your boyfriend and who you currently live with…" Charlie added tentatively. Dean rubbed his palm over his face. "Sam filled me in, sorry. Congrats on ditching heterosexuality though."
"Omega stipend…? You mean like payment for his household work?" Sam asked and Dean nodded. He had found out lots of omega related things he had never knew existed in the last week. Maybe it wasn't surprising since there never had been an omega in his family or group of acquaintances. He hoped Novak would take care of the majority of these things in the future, because Dean had slept maybe 4 hours a night in the last week with all the stuff he had to do before and after work.
"That's quite something," Benny said next to Dean, clearly skeptical of the situation. "I'm sure this tanked your sex life." Dean groaned, shoving at Benny. Jack didn't tank their sex life! At least not entirely. But he'd be glad if they could arrange a nursery for him now, so that Cas wouldn't carry him around constantly. Many people had nannies for their kids, right? Surely angels weren't too hands on. Unless of course giving their kids away for other families to raise was the angelic alternative to nannies.
"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow," Dean confirmed, then he stepped back out.
"If Dean dies here that will draw the attention of his brother Sam. We have gotten intel that Sam is withdrawing gradually from hunting, but Dean's disappearance would bring him down on us if there was even just a hint of it being caused by supernatural means," he explained.
! How the hell is that supposed to help me?! You knew and you didn't do anything! You what? Just hoped I would never find out?! That I would somehow tolerate this horrible town? Propose to you? Be a happy little househusband while you worked in your café and your coven continues to slaughter people?!"
"A closed door is not supposed to be opened even if it is unlocked," he said firmly. Bobby opened his mouth, but Cas interrupted him, his voice gruff:
"And you want something else?" Castiel asked, "is that why you asked me out instead of just picking someone up?" Dean looked back at him, his shoulders hunched slightly and his brow wrinkled. It made him look insecure, vulnerable almost.
"I will come straight to the point," she said without further pleasantries. She looked from Dean to Cas. "I have been informed that you two might have consummated your marriage at last. Is that correct?"
"Not everybody's got such a winning personality like you do, Dean. For some of us applying for jobs is hell," Cas said, well aware that he was being a bit too dramatic. It wasn't the worst thing. Other people had it harder on the job market. Dean blew him a kiss, then he served them both food.
"Poor Hatchiette," Dean said with a laugh and Cas refrained from telling him that a real egg would hardly be impacted by the current placement. "Can I see her?" Now that the surprise of Dean's visit was wearing off, Cas found it in himself to narrow his eyes at him.
"It's been less than a year after the invasion, clearly someone as long lived as you could have a bit more patience to see how it unfolds," Dean said with a sneer, though Lucifer merely smiled at him over his glass before taking a sip.
"That's hardly a juicy detail, that's pretty much the opposite of juicy," Dean complained. Charlie tilted her head at him. "And I usually drive up to see him. I haven't been in a while because of work. I was in Seattle the last two weekends."
"Your Majesty, I saw the attack. I saw the wound on General Dean. He should be dead. I don't know what the angel did, but the General's clearly alive because of his intervention," Benny explained, looking almost apologetical that he couldn't give his king a more favorable answer. "I saw the angelic medics move through the battle field on Sir Castiel's orders. They went straight to the wounded."
"Does that guy have wings?"
"What is it?" John wanted to know and the doctor shook his head. "There's not a scratch on his highness, not even a scar he got over the years. The only thing he has is that burn."
"Is this Cas' type?" she asked. Jimmy relaxed, then he heaved a sigh and approached enough to take the phone from her.
"That's impossible," Dean said, getting Gabriel's attention. "We're both guys!"
"Yes, sure. We can do that," Dean promised and Jack leaned back in his chair with a pleased smile.
"But what would that mean for him? To lose his Grace?" Dean asked.
In hind-sight, that had been his mistake. Because once everything was in storage and Cas was on the drive to Dayton, the messages started coming.
How Dean had missed it. To know that no matter what he demanded, Castiel would comply, maybe grumbling, maybe lashing out, but in the end, he’d follow his orders. It was invigorating, it was exhilarating and it was incredibly hot.
"I can help!" he shouted over the fire, his face already dirty with ash and sweat dripping from his brow.
He was a coward.
Once the rushing of Dean's blood faded and he sat back on his ass to catch his breath, Dean felt apprehension and distrust pooling uncomfortably in his stomach. Castiel was getting up from the floor and wordlessly put his clothing back on, item for item, covering the skin that Dean had tasted not too long before. Hiding away that unsettling heat simmering under the thin layer Castiel's human vessel provided. One thin wall between the sweltering nightmare of Purgatory and the human world.
"Don't mind Pillow, she respects no one in this house," the god commented, sending the so-called Pillow a sharp look. Dean eyed the cat, but truth to be told, he was more interested in the rest of this house. It was like walking through a Lord of the Rings set. Through high wooden doors, they reached a corridor, just as decorated as the hall before had been. They came to what Dean assumed might be an entrance hall, the high ceiling carried by wooden columns and the open door showing the landscape behind.
"I thought I'd wait here until you had readied your penis," Castiel told him. Dean snorted. Cas studied his face. "Why aren't you?"
"Is it customary to receive wedding gifts by kings?" Dean wondered as they approached.
"I don't want to show you the way to Sam," Castiel reminded him, somewhat contrite. "I just want to know that Sam's alright. He hasn't been back and I'm worried." Castiel breathed in deeply. This was it. He had to cross. A crow called right when Cas was about to go past the banishment line. Cas looked up, finding the crow sitting on the he very top of the tower. It called once again. That was not a good omen. But this wasn't about him. It was about Sam, so whatever might happen, he had to do it. He stepped over the boundary and walked up to Dean. Dean sent him an encouraging smile.
The cabin was small and the key was placed in a pot with fake flowers.
"I know I'm not your servant, but it seems like the law doesn't," Castiel added drily. Dean heaved a sigh at that. "I'm simply here to work."
"I have no idea! Dude killed Raphael and then he left the coven. He's free!" he announced and his next smile was surprisingly genuine. "And isn’t that nice?" Gabriel waved at him, then he walked away, leaving Dean stunned.
"I think we should start talking about a change to our living arrangements," Cas said, leaving Dean somewhat stunned. A heavy conversation like that this early in the morning? Was Dean's brain even online enough for that?
"You could have given us a warning. We checked every shelter and homeless camp twice!" Dean said by way of greeting but he was grinning now.
Dean didn't seem to be in any hurry to leave this morning, finding reasons enough to stay even though he must have been re-reading the same page of the newspaper for half an hour, waiting for Castiel to get through the morning rush. Castiel on his part tried to avoid him because he thought he could vomit at any time at how sick he felt to have cast this spell. It wasn't just the guilt, it was also the consequence of doing black magic. And maybe, Castiel told himself cowardly, if he kept away from Dean the magic might not settle completely. He knew it was futile. It would take a witch with abilities like Castiel's to undo the magic or a lot of time without Dean being in Castiel's company to let it fade over the years.
"You know?" Jo asked in disbelief and she tossed the towel down on the counter. "Then how come you're not mated already?"
"You know what your father thinks about flowers," Castiel said.
"It is an honor to have the General of the Armies present today and I thank you for delivering my husband to me," he said, sounding very formal, but Dean saw Anna shoot her brother an encouraging smile. "Thank you also to Naomi, Advisor to the High King, for taking time away from court, to advise and assist me." Dean was surprised to find out that this illustrious Naomi was in fact the mother-in-law he had seen at the church. "Hannah, your help in preparing this home for us is very appreciated." Castiel then stepped away from the table to grab a huge decanter, one of many lining the sideboard behind him and started pouring wine into people's chalices, starting with Dean. Dean did meet his eyes, but Castiel only studied him for a short moment, before he moved on to Anna. That the lord of the manor took it upon himself to serve everyone seemed odd to Dean, but what did he know of angelic customs? Eventually food was rolled in by the kitchen staff and they quickly loaded the tables with it. Then surprisingly the kitchen staff took a seat at the tables as well and Naomi got up instead, joining Cas in giving out food to everyone. They started with Dean, then moved on to the kitchens staff, before serving everyone else.
"And neither do I!"
"I hate that term.
For someone who carried their whole life on his person, this wanderer was lightly dressed, with only a cape covering his clothes and a bag slung over his chest. His hair was short, his face youthful and covered in freckles. His scent drifted towards Castiel like incense smoke lazily spiraling through the air, mingling with the scents in the cottage. It was pleasant. But Castiel knew not to be fooled, especially not by the longing he felt when he gazed upon this man.
