“No, of course not. But if it was a poetry, I would love to read it someday.”
Dean is looking at him. Not into eyes, Cas would prefer if he made with him eye contact. He always appreciates that, green color is so soothing, but instead, Dean is just studying his face. He's starting to wonder about something.
“Do you have anything?” he asks, hopefully.
They're going to the park because, surprise-surprise, a park is exactly twenty feet next to the coffee shop. Lucky them!
Dean found his favorite old jeans this morning, and he thought it was a good idea to check if they still fit. They did.
“Oh, it’s nothing important. Today, we have Valentine’s Day, and people give presents to each other when they’re in love,” he explained, and Cas nod in understanding.
“Dammit, Cas!”
“I'm not sure if he wanted to back here, Sammy. He was happy there… Let's go home!”
“Yes, Dean?”
(no, not broken, Cas has never seen him as broken) human. He wants to give him something more.
“Still, I'm sorry.”
“I understand.” Cas nodded and took a sip of his drink. Dean did the same, and after that, he put the bottle on the coffee table.
Dean found Cas in the bunker’s kitchen. Angel have never eaten, so probably he thought he could hide there because that was the last place where Dean could arrive.
“Come in.”
They pull away, resting their foreheads on each other, and Cas whispers: “You thought right.”
) bisexual witch, so more accurate is 'John Winchester is homophobic like the CW'. Actually, it's a big mess. Why is he so interested in somebody's else sexual life? It is kind of stupid, but it's John Winchester, so nobody is surprised.
“Yeah...”
“Thank you, Dean. And you… you look beautiful. The bow tie makes that your eyes are greener, like a grass at Saturday's morning…”
Dean gets up.
“You're doing great job with the kid.” It sounded honest, and Cas almost believed that. Dean was smiling, looking at the kid, and there was no disgusted. Cas was prepared that Dean saw in Jack only son of Satan, but to his surprise, he saw just the baby.
He saw an old lady on the street with bouquets of daisies. It was a windy day, and she wore only a sweater, and he just thought it would be nice to help her a little. Small bouquets cost three dollars, the big ones five. He took one of them and give the lady ten bucks.
“I want… if it's not too problematic for you. I slept with April because I was a lost human then, and it was something new for me. It was very educational, but I didn't have any feelings to her. She was my only one sexual partner. I think, it was nice, but I would prefer to do this again with someone who has a bond with me,” explains Cas. He almost used word 'profound', but he bit his tongue.

Dean changed him. He was changing him from the beginning. The love changed him. And when they’re together on the bunker’s basement, waiting for Death to take them away, he has the courage. He’s not afraid of how he feels anymore. And he doesn’t regret. He has never regretted falling… Falling in love with Dean Winchester.
“No, of course not,” he whispers, kissing Cas on the forehead.
“Umm, what? It doesn't sound... good,” he shared with his doubts. Lily was flower for chicks, he should be Venus Flytrap or some other badass shit (why it was Venus, actually? Mars Flytrap sounded better).
“And for you, sweetie?” she asks Cas, who gives desperately look at the menu.
“Okay, just listen to me. And don't dare you interrupt! Both of you!” she warns them. “I met Aphrodite a few weeks ago. She doesn't kill people, so we arrived at an agreement… And went on the date after that. It was awesome, by the way. The point is… She told me about her powers, so I had some idea. I called to Sam…”
on tumblr!
“So, should I do this?” asks Cas. He still isn't sure.
“And what about your vegetable’s crap? I’ll grab you some, all right?”
He takes down yellow curtains and rips them to wrap the body. It isn't even truly Cas, just a vessel and that thought hits Dean in the heart. Jimmy Novak has gone to the Heaven years ago, but where do angels go after they die? Cas has never told him, maybe he didn't know either?
“Hey, look at me,” says Dean, and Cas turns around. “Family don’t end with blood. You’re my family too. I should go with you. You didn’t do anything wrong, okay? It’s dad, he has tough character.”
gasps Jody.
“Yes.”
They finish a pie and drinks, Dean knows that he needs something more than coffee before he will kiss Cas. There’s no time to lose, so he thinks quickly how to extend this meeting.
“I don't have a cup anymore,” point Cas. Yeah, you don't say, you lil shit!
Cas nods. He doesn't understand why Dean is talking so much. Why does he even bother to explain him everything? Why does he waste his time just for the words of comfort? But he admits that it feels good. Dean's voice calms him down a little, he's not so much terrified anymore.

“Don't be mad? Charlie, you're like a sister to me, and I care about you very much, but the hell! I could die there! Did you even realize what…”
“Somebody has to. Look, I need to go. But say “hi” to girls. Bye!” he hangs up before Jody can say ‘goodbye’ to him.
Cas can't sleep immediately, he's hearing slow Dean's breath and feels some weird sensation in his stomach. It's something new to him. He closes his eyes, trying to think only about his best friend next to him.
Dean isn’t sure why he does it, or no, he knows why he does it - because he wants it, he’s just not sure if it’s a good idea, but after Cas is focused on the picture again, he slides his hand into his. Cas seems to be surprised, but he grips it without any word and any hesitation. Their hands connect with each other like they were created for this, all the time.
They're still riding. Still in silence. Sam tries to talk with Dean one more time after ten minutes: “And what about Jack?”
He hasn't seen him for two, the longest in his life, months. He made his choices when he decided to raise Kelly Kline's baby. For the first time he stopped being selfish, he didn't stay with Dean, he chose Jack. And now, Dean Winchester stood in front of him on the porch of his lake house.
“Of course, I do.”
“I made lots of mistakes, and sometimes I still make it. I've devastated Heaven, killed lots of beings. I didn't know what was good and bad. But when I met Dean... and Sam, I understood that there are things worth dying for.”
“Dean... What are you doing?” asked Cas, but he didn't open his eyes like promised.
“You're gonna leave me?” asks Dean, and Cas opens his mouth to say something, but nothing comes to his mind. He was sure Dean will be glad after he goes away. He wouldn't be a burden anymore.
“Yeah...”
Dean nods. “Yeah, but we’ll keep him safe. Always.”
They're cuddling for the next ten minutes until Dean's stomach grumbles.
“Thank you, Dean,” he whispers.
Dean raises his head and finds a pair of blue eyes. He smiles, the first time since Cas was gone.
He doesn’t look at John. Now, he wants to check on Cas who is his real heaven, not an abusive father.
“Where's Sam?” asked Cas, looking at the door like he just expected the other Winchester there.
“Undo your buttons. Two will be enough.” Cas does exactly what Balthazar said. “And now, take off that damn coat!”
“Jack. He looks like Cas. I know, it's weird 'cause Cas wasn't his real father, and I know it was just a vessel, but… Jack has his eyes, and I'm not talking about Jimmy's. It's the same gaze. Cas was staring at me like that all the time.”
Dean rolls up his sleeves and takes a sponge to clean Cas' body. He tries to be gently, but Cas hisses anyway every time the water runs down his wounds.
It isn’t helpful at all. John looks anger, and Cas wants to piss him off more, so he grabs Dean’s shirt and pulls him close, giving him a very passionate kiss with a tongue.
“My usually choices are as good as Freddie. And by the way, I didn't know you can appreciate a real music,” he teases.
The third time, he catches John in the Impala. It's funny that heaven has two versions of this car, one belongs to Dean.
Written on
Cas shook his head.
“Oh, somebody starts talking, huh?” Dean smiles, and maybe he just imagines that, but it looks like Jack smiles back.
Dean makes two pyres. They say goodbye to Kelly first, then it's time for Cas. Dean brings his body from the cabin. He is also the person who will set fire to the pyre. He holds the lighter in the hand already, but he doesn't move before both of them won’t say goodbye.
He’s still awake, the Shadow can’t sleep, and it makes them angry. But it still not easy to convinced them to release him. The Shadow can torture him for centuries before they’ll be bored. And Cas knows he doesn’t have so much time. He needs to come back.
“Should I go?” he asks.
They pull back, smiling to each other and staring into their eyes. Blue and green. Colors of their love.
“Sure,” says Sam with a smile. “And Dean... Thanks that you told me.”
for the beginning.
“And do you wanna my help?” asks Dean again to be sure about that.
Sam runs to the car, and Dean is still holding Cas' face, whispering that everything will be okay. Of course, ex-angel couldn't hear him, but to be honest he is talking to himself.
Did he just call Cas 'man' after he confesed him a love?
“Yes, I think. But Meg was my friend… Not then, later.”
Dean blinked twice in confusion.
Cas raises his eyes and nods: “Sure.”
“Umm, thanks, Cas. You didn't have to.”
Dean opens his mouth, but says nothing. So, he just walks to the bathroom and closes the door. A cold shower should help this warm feeling in his chest.
Dean sighs, but turns to Cas. “What's wrong, Cas?”
You can find me on
Great, he's still upset... And Dean holds out an olive branch here!
“You'll find out tonight,” says Dean, raising his eyebrows.
“Dean...”
“Yeah, I have to trust you, but you don't trust me enough to tell about some shit and instead you go straight to Sam with your concerns.”
“I’m glad to hear that.”
"Eyes open." Dean bit his lip as he keep his eyes on Cas' electric blue eyes. He felt his eyes flutter closed. And then a pinch at the base of his dick that made his eyelids fly open again. "I told you, eyes open. I need to see those green eyes."
"I killed a man Cas..."
Yes you read right...death. Calm down it's not Dean or Cas, or Charlie. Anywhore, hope you enjoy!
"Whatever." Cas winked at the other man. Dean laughed and closed the door behind him as he left the room.
"After everything you've been through, you deserve it." He smiled. "You're the amazing one."Dean pulled Cas close and took over his mouth. Cas opened up to the kiss and pulled at Dean's bottom lip. Dean let out a low moan.
John came home first. "Something smells good. Dean must be cooking." He teased. Mary pushed him playfully. "Very funny." She laughed. John went to the living room and sat in the chair. "What are you making Dean?"
Cas jumped onto the seat of the chair.
"But coming from a genius, it's a good idea."
"His name is Cas. And he's my best friend you asshat!"
burger for Cas. Cas looked around the restaurant. There were definitely a lot more people in the place now and the seats were pretty much full. Cas downed another shot and began to wonder how he could stir up some trouble. In between songs, Cas figured he'd introduce himself to the band. He got up and walked over to the lead singer.
Cas smiled. "You said you made up an excuse to go talk to me."
Dean turned around and in two steps he had reached Zachariah and decked him the face for the second time in two days. Naomi screamed. Dean looked at her. "That's twice now. One for each time he hit Cas that day your dick of a husband figured us out and decided he couldn't handle it."
"Excuse me? Did you not have everything you ever wanted?"
He grabbed a pair of kaki cargo pants out of his dresser and moved to his closet, finally settling on a black long sleeve Nirvana shirt.
“Yes, sir…” Dean lay down as he was asked, he’d never admit that Cas had ordered him to, and suddenly Cas was leaning over him, tying something around his wrists and… to the bedpost?
"Well, I guess you can have that. Twist my arm.." They started to head over to the couch in the corner when Cas stopped.
He turned and walked out, Dean right behind him.
Dean took off his jacket and pressed it against his back. Cas yelled out. "Now what?"
"And now, performing their new single 'Celebrity Status' with two awards under their belt, Join The Hunt!"
“Oh my God...Alec! He wasn't joking!” Then she ran off.
By the way...things are about to get rough so guard your feels.
About half an hour later, they sat down to eat the tacos. Dean snuck bits of taco meat under the table to Mystic.
“I'll be waiting!” Dean called after Cas. Dean finished his food and went back to work.
"I tested in."  "When did you do that?" "Before the break. Don't look so surprised you two."Cas ruffled Dean's hair. "Look at you, getting into all my classes so you can stare at my ass more."Cas just smiled. "I always knew you weren't just another dumb jock." He leaned across the table and grabbed his schedule. The bell rang and they got up and dumped the garbage off their trays and set them aside. Cas put messenger bag over his head on the opposite shoulder.
"Speaking."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know what I fucking saw Charlie. I'm not blind. I should have known better. I'm too screwed up for him and he found someone better."
"Charlie, I need you on this."
Dean shrugged. "Well, she was really worried, as we all were, and was relieved that you came out of it. But I won't lie; she's probably gonna pop you on the head."
"Dean Winchester in the flesh! Word has it that there's an offer on the take from a major NFL team. Care to spill?"
They were silent going to the airport. Cas had given him a picture to take with him a picture of them together that Sam had taken a few days prior. Ellen, Jo, Bobby, Sam, and Jess were all waiting to see him off. Dean tucked the picture in his pocket. After saying goodbye to everyone, the all started to head home. Cas stayed. Dean hugged him. "This isn't goodbye. This is see you soon." Cas nodded. "I promise I'll come back to you. You hear me?" Cas looked up at him. Dean looked around to make sure nobody was watching. He kissed him. He pulled back after a moment. "I love you." He whispered. Cas sniffed back tears. "I love you too."
"Hey there, rock star."
"Not one bit."
"When you're better."
Sam smiled at him. He wasn't lying. The world outside this place was horrible. The Betas have become exponentially worse than the Alphas. With the Alphas, they would rape Omegas that came into heat. It's well known that Alphas can hardly control themselves when they're around and Omega in heat. The Betas however, rapped Omegas just because they can.
"But, he's your teammate."
Cas put his hands on his head. "Babe, I don't think I will ever calm down from this. Ahhhhh so happy!"
“Oh, sorry.” He relaxed a little.
The reporter laughed. "Well thank you guys for the interview."
"Clever Charlie."
“So you're-”
"Dean."
"He's in Lawrence?"
Cas threw Dean a thumbs up. Dean laughed. "Smartass."
Dean slowly pushed his tongue past Cas' lips, exploring as he went. He pushed himself down on Cas, making Cas moan. Dean felt his thigh twitch as nimble fingers danced their way down his skin.
Dean was a little disgusted with how happy he was. Seeing Cas laughing and being with everyone was amazing, even more amazing was the fact that, at the end of night, Cas was his and the other way around. Dean walked behind Cas as Cas chalked his pool cue, giving his ass a light squeeze. Cas almost dropped the chalk.
"Michael."
"Died Cas. I'm aware."
"I can't have visitors, can I?"
As always ENJOY!!
“You’re just jealous because I’m more fabulous than you.” Cas winked at Dean as he walked out to the garage to get the bike.
As Cas and his mother and grandmother drive back to the ranch, Naomi started in again about her son finding a partner.
"Well, no."
"Yeah, I guess. I'm so fucking nervous!"He scrolled through all the songs. "I pretty much just made an entire album in three days. Who does that?" He stopped at one and just stared at the title. "Huh. I just decided which one I'll play. If we get to that is." "Really? What one?" "It's a surprise. You'll see tomorrow." He shut his computer off and spun the chair around. "Even if I don't get to play my song, I'll still get to be on stage with Josh fucking Ramsey. I've never been on stage with this many people watching." "You'll do awesome. The stage is where you belong." Dean got up and kissed him.Cas blushed. "Well, the stage and your arms."
"Close your mouth, you'll attract flies. And I told you being a rock star comes with its advantages." He smiled. "I can't believe I just met one of the best chefs in the world."
Dean sighed. "If you are absolutely not okay with me leaving, I'll stay."
His phone went off in his pocket.
"No. One other. In college. But I've kissed a few in high school." John's arms dropped.
So, what do you think? Leave a comment below!
Three months had passed. Dean was home in Lawrence for a week, which he welcomed. If he didn't have to deal with Jaxon eyeing him for any period of time, it was awesome.
"Cas, if you don't open the door, I'll break it down. Please! I'm sorry I yelled at you. I wasn't thinking...it just...happened."
"Actually, that's why I jumped first. So Cas would land on me and I would break his fall."
"Huh. I just remember going down, then I woke up to your loud ass snoring this morning."
“What?"
"Did they...?"
"Take care of yourself Cas. I'll always love you."
"Best prom ever." Dean smiled. "By the way, you should wear a tank top more often." Cas smiled and shook his head.   "You know what you should do? Make like a video diary for the fans. Life in the studio, life on tour, stuff like that." Charlie suggested.
Naomi waited a few seconds until she heard Cas' door shut. She opened the door and smiled at Dean.
"Depp, he has more experience."
"What do you mean leave?"
He pulled up in front of Cas dorm building and got out. They were in their third year of college. They both had one year left.
Dean didn't answer. He just looked at Cas.
Naomi turned the key and picked up her phone."Hey, Mary. It's me..."
Cas exhaled. He didn't even notice he had held his breath. "With this ring..."
The drive to the Novak's house was silent. Dean dropped Cas off without a word. As he went inside the house, Cas turned to see a cloud of dust at the end of their stone driveway.
"Sir, I understand"
“Let's go.”
“How bad is it Alec?”
"Tricky Winchester."
Charlie raised an eyebrow at her friend. “Why?”
"Alfie's better."
"I... I don't know what to say..."
“What? They found us?”
"This is like, the biggest moment of my life, marrying you aside. I'm fucking nervous."
“Beyond ready. I'm starving.”
"Everything? Clothes, deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, razors?"
"What?"
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
"Do you remember when we met? Outside the diner?"
He grabbed a chair and sat down, moving the mic so it was right in front of him. He took a breath.
************
Josh grabbed the mic. "Are you fuck... is this real life?! Dude! I don't have the words to explain how I feel right now. Let's let them do it for me." He held the mic out at the crowd again, who completely lost their minds. People were jumping and screaming for Join The Hunt. Both bands came together at the front of the stage. "One more time for Cas and Join The Hunt!" The crowd screamed some more, raising their hands up and cheering. A bra was tossed at Cas.
Benny nodded as he reached up into the locker he shared with Cas. “It goes. You know the drill.” As the boys gathered their things for their first class, Cas dropped a stack of papers.
"Depends. Get anything good in the mail lately?" Castiel dug through the papers on his desk, finding the mail. He found an envelope from his older brother and opened it. "You're joking right? You're getting married?"
"You're fucking evil you know that? Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to even look like I'm paying attention?"
He walked back over to the bed and laid down. "Wake me up when there's food."
Guard your feels...that is all.
Cas pulled them down to the water and got out.
Cas kissed him again and got up. "I guess I might as well give you your present." He walked over to the tree and grabbed a small box with a bow on it. He jumped over the couch and sat down, handing the gift to Dean.
him and took some pictures. After a while. He walked over to Dean, who handed him another coffee.
"Where the fuck are you?"
♡♡♡♡♡
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are those... reins?”
After he dropped everything off at the Roadhouse, he thanked Ellen and Bobby for helping. Exhausted, he called Charlie and told her he'd pick her up and take her home and he'd stay with Cas all night.
“It's like a community coming together, doing what the can.” Cas smiled.
Cas nodded again.
Dean smiled and hummed. "Yes. But at least we have the rest of our lives together." Kissing him again.
"Ahh, Kansas City. Such fond memories."
"Well then. Awkward. Ask another question."
“That's Bobby. He's an Alpha. Ellen is his mate.” Sam explained.
"You okay?"
"What?" Cas asked, looking back at Dean.
The music started and Cas sang into a hairbrush in nothing but a shirt and his underwear. He was wearing oversized aviators. Dean nodded as he watched; Cas did totally rock that song, even at ten years old. But it was also extremely adorable and Dean would be getting Charlie to make a copy.
He grabbed the keys. Dean turned around, grabbed something, and handed it to Cas. "It's not your original helmet. It was damn near cracked in half. So I got you a new one." Cas took the helmet and smiled. He handed Dean his crutches and swung his broken leg over the bike and started it up. She roared to life. Dean opened the garage door and Cas used his right foot to push it out. When he was out, Dean closed the door and walked to the Impala, putting Cas' crutches in the back seat then got in. Once Cas heard the Impala roar to life, he revved his bike, put it in gear and took off down the road. Dean was right behind him. Cas had to admit, he was a little nervous being back on his bike so soon after he wrecked it. He thought it was totaled. Thank goodness Dean was good at fixing cars. As soon as he was out of town, he hit the throttle. Going as fast as he possibly could. The bike topped out at 120. Dean was still right behind him. He weaved back and forth, checking the traction of the tires. Dean must have put new ones on. He slowed down and pulled into the Roadhouse, which had a few cars. Cas parked on the side and hopped off. Dean parked next to him. He got out and handed Cas his crutches. Cas grabbed them then took his helmet off with one hand. "Tell me you did not just drive that bike here Castiel James." Cas jumped and turned around to see Ellen with her arms folded.
"Well did you call an ambulance?"
Don’t you wanna love,
John or Sam would open his door and check on him just to make sure he was still alive. Worried he might try to end his life. And he did try.
"Well, you make a good muse." Cas pulled Dean in and kissed him. Carlie grabbed Cas by the collar. "Okay, okay... break it up. We all know what happens when you two suck face, and I don't think everyone else would enjoy that view."Cas sighed and rolled his eyes. "Spoil sport."
"I'm good. Thanks, though."
"God, somebody just kill me..."
"And why would you do that?"
As always ENJOY!
"Put him two liters of oxygen..."
"I'm gonna make myself look totally amazing. It doesn't take much work. I'm already pretty amazing." Charlie arrived in the auditorium.
But you di-disappear
He sighed. "What?" The door opened. "Hey, sweetie. Something wrong?" Cas looked toward the door. "No, mom. Whatever gave you that idea?"
Hola everyone! With out further ado...here is chapter 13!!! I apologize for the long chapters...
“No, don't be. You were just trying to help.”
"When we were kids, you were the only one that talked to me. I wish I could remember the day we met, but I'm pretty sure your mom has a video of it somewhere." Everyone laughed. Cas continued. "Every moment with you now is just like it was back then, only were taller." Sam nudged Dean. "Notice he didn't say smarter?" Cas looked up and smiled while Dean stifled a laugh. "I think even then I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you even if we weren't soul mates. I love you Dean Winchester. I'll always love you."
Cas' eyes flew open. "I highly doubt that."
Dean rubbed his face. "Oh yeah. The girls. I... forgot about them. I wonder if they called at all."
Better than
"You're kidding!"
"Are you going with them?"
"Are you trying to make me come in my pants?"
The next picture was of Dean's lower half covered with his cowboy hat. Cas was pretty sure that Dean was trying to kill him.

Hey everyone! just a quick update letting you know this story has not been abandoned! I'm just trying to finish The Collide Saga first before I finish everything else. I am going to try to slowly update as much as possible. I can't just leave my first ABO hanging, can I? Anyways! Thank you all for understanding! I love you all!
"You're welcome. And it's Naomi." She settled back into her seat. "I have always like you, you know? I'm glad it's you." Naomi patted Dean's hand. He started to speak when he was interrupted by Charlie squealing.
"Yeah. We've definitely been missing out."
You could be my ever after
He did.
"Wooo! This is what I needed," Dean said as he slammed his shot glass down. Cas raised his empty glass. "Another, bar wench!"
"Nothin." Dean smiled. Cas rolled his eyes. "You're such a dork." He pushed him away lightly.
"Fuck Cas!"
Dean smiled, looking out at the horizon. "Yeah, poor kid was never the same around clowns after that."
Dean grabbed the needle. "What was in this Cas? Meth? Cocaine? Heroin?"
“It would be fine with me if you wanted to, you know, sleep here tonight...”
"Not by yourself. Charlie is flying out in the morning and you have the band."
“Hey there, little brother! Guys, you remember Castiel?” The other men shook Cas’ hand and said hello. Then the seamstress brought out their items.
Cas looked back at Dean, who was walking away at a fast pace. “Don't… don't get me banned!” Cas patted RJ on the neck. “He's such a fucking hot head sometimes.”
The crowd screamed. Cas ran his fingers through his hair and pulled his guitar in front of him.
"So when are you gonna start making the new album?"
Dean readied the assault rifle he had taken from one of the injured soldiers, turning off the safety and chambering a round. He stepped out of the cover of the woods, Cas close behind. He took slow deep breaths as he aimed the weapon back and forth. After a few steps he lowered it.
“I know. I'm so sorry Cas. I couldn't protect you...”
Dean sat up. "Well when four people are standing around you talking..."
Cas thought for a moment. "What about Lucky's On Main? They have awesome burgers and usually they have a live band. I wanna eat grease and dance and cause a problem."
"And sex."
Cas turned to Josh. “Did I just…. Did I just randomly make a video with Marianas Trench?!”
He kicked off the song by playing his guitar before singing.
"Anytime. Now, I had debated cooking dinner for us tonight but since you're feeling up to par figured I'd let you pick. So, stay in and I make your favorite cheesy potatoes, or we go out somewhere. Your choice."
“Seriously man, if they wanna wait to mate, that's up to them.” Benny said. Benny and Dean had become fast friends, and Benny seemed to fit right in with the group. As did Andrea.
Castiel did as he was told. Dean grunted again.
Before Cas could protest, Dean walked away.
"No, the bar I got us into with the fake ID'S I made."
"Where are you?"
"Green."
"Cas, we can't let you go in there. Your yelling isn't going to help."
“Mom?”
Who cares baby
"Of course I kept it. I carried it with me every day."
"Relax love. We got all the time in the world." Dean whispered softly as he pushed against Cas' prostate again. Cas arched his back and moaned. Dean couldn't get enough of Cas being absolutely wrecked. He loved the sight of Cas under him, moaning, practically begging for release. Dean moaned against Cas' neck as he listened to his lover lose control, as Cas' chest rose and fell in shallow and erratic breaths.
“Cas?”
I'm outta here. See you at the party."
"I thought it was beautiful. Like you."
Cas looked at him then. "Why? What would it change Dean? What would telling you accomplish? And if you say 'it will help me feel better' so help me I will kick your ass."
Cas grabbed Dean's phone, typing in his number.
"Seriously?!"
Cas nodded. "Well, lunch is ready."
"Outside of work...right?" Sam grinned.
"You're late." Bobby grumbled.
"What did you just do?" Dean raised an eyebrow as the question rolled off of his tongue.
Cas looked from the Dean to the small black box in his hand. When Dean opened it, Cas gasped. "Will you be my sidekick?" Cas looked at him. Tears of joy forming in his eyes. He smiled. "Who else would I fight crime with?" Dean smiled and took Cas' left hand, sliding the ring on to his ring finger.
"Your shirt. Nirvana. I like them too."
Finally, mercifully, Dean bottomed out with a moan. He kept his pace slow, pulling Cas up so he was straddling him. Cas moaned and his head fell forward onto Dean's shoulder. Dean held Cas with one arm, the other arm bracing him on the bed.
Please sing to me,
"He saw me."
"Babe, you should go celebrate. You've earned it."
"Well play it then."
"Alright. See you there. Be careful."
"I'm doing you a favor. An athletic scholarship is the only way out of this town. Keep fucking with him, it's out the window."
"Oh you know, seemed like fun."
“Because I’m taking my pants off. They’re disgusting.” Dean shimmied out of the denim and left them there on the floor. He sniffed at his shirt as he took it off and made a face. “Damn, that is really nasty.” He dropped the shirt onto the jeans and stepped into the house. Cas looked up from his book he was reading and started to turn around.
“Dickwad." Dean threw the phone on the bedside table.
“So I've noticed something.” Charlie said as she and Cas were walking to The Drive.
Dean took Cas by the hand. "I'll tell you on the way."
Before getting in the shower, he deleted all the voicemails and texts Dean sent. He sent a quick text to Adam telling him where he was and he'd be back before going on tour.  He stripped and stepped in the shower, letting the water wash over him. He washed quickly, got out, and got dressed. He walked out to the living room. "Thanks for letting me crash here Charlie."
“You want me to make you come?”
He opened his eyes to see Charlie standing over him. The sheet was draped low around his hips, dangerously close to flashing her.
"Good point." Charlie said taking a drink of her punch. "And nobody even spiked the punch."
Dean read it over. “I'll take a small group tonight and get everything we need. Good job Chuck.” He patted Chuck on the shoulder.
Cas was very pale and there were dark circles around his eyes. Dean took in a breath. "I know you've been through hell and you probably feel like giving up, but please Cas. You can't die.' Dean reached out and took Cas' hand, holding it in both of his own for a few minutes, just staring at Cas' quiet self. Finally, Dean put his head down on the bed, letting sleep take him over for the first time in days.
Perfect by Marianas Trench  (written as JTH)
He linked arms with Dean and looked back at the camera and winked.
He almost jumped through the roof of the porch. Charlie had sneaked up on him. Damn, she was good at that.
Sam was basically falling off the couch with laughter at this point. Dean sighed. "I need more coffee." He stood up and walked to the kitchen. "I can buy you some condoms if you want."
Dean pulled out a sandwich and took a bite. He looked at Cas. “This is perfect. Thank you.”
The guys left and the housr was suddenly quiet. Cas ordered some Chinese and sat down at his computer. He put on his headphones and listened to background vocals layered on the newest track.
He played the keyboard
"It's a secret." He winked.
Dean stood up, turning to Alec. “And how exactly are you a fucking expert all the sudden? You've never had a mate either.”
John left for work, Sam for school. The neighbor was supposed to be in every so often through out the day to check on him. When the neighbor left for the last time that day, Dean got out of bed and went into the bathroom and grabbed the bottle of pain killers. Thinking about all the new comments that had popped up on his profile after he was raped saying he probably like it and he was nasty and should die. As he shoved a handful of pills in his mouth he thought about how it would all be over soon. That he wouldn't be suffering.
"You have got to stop doing that." He said taking another sip of coffee.
Somebodies got to tell me what to do.
Cas did as he was told, grabbing the things Ellen needed. “Wait, there's different colors...”
"We've got him breathing!"
Cas was sitting on the end of the bed. Dean smiled. “I see you've found my secret place.”
"Square root of one hundred forty-­four?"
Dean put up a hand. "Wait. Just... hold on a damn second. I'm right. Fuck it all, I'm right!"
The waitress came and took everyone's orders; pancakes for Charlie, waffles for Meg, a farmer's omelet for Dean, and Spanish scrambled eggs for Cas. Plates of bacon and sausage were shared.
“Why don't you boys show the Omega around?”
"May I present to you, Dean and Castiel Winchester. You may kiss your husband." Dean definitely didn't need to be told that twice. He pulled Cas close. Placing his hands on his hips. He smiled and kissed Cas' lips. Everyone was clapping. Dean smiled when he pulled away. "Welcome to the family." John said to Cas. "Even though you've been apart of the family since you were one." Mary interjected with a hug.
“Stay safe out there.” Dean said.
"Don't want you to meet my parents ever." It sounded a little more harsh than intended.
"Oh so this is who was in the shower with you!"
The lights cut out. His head shot up. Was this normal? He didn't know. He slowly stood up and even more slowly crept to the door, looking out the tiny window. The whole building was dark. He couldn't see a thing, save for flashes of light.
Cas was thankful that it was dark out and that there was very little traffic on the road, because Dean had somehow undone Cas' pants with one hand and was now gripping his erection at the base, squeezing lightly and barely stroking. Cas sped up the bike as he felt his neck get hot. Dean smiled when Cas shuttered again. Cas kept his eyes focused on the road. "Keep it up and I'm gonna pull over and take you on the side of the road."
"They'll have to stay in class I guess." He tapped the pencil on the notebook. "I'm gonna go ask the principal for permission so he can get the permissionslips ready." He stood up. "Wanna go?"   Dean nodded, standing up. Cas looked over at Crowley. "Gotta go ask the principal something." Crowley nodded. "Take the hall pass."
"I know the perfect place."
Dean rolled his eyes. "Of course." He smiled as he put the helmet on.
As usual, Benny, Bobby, Sam, And Cole were waiting on him.
"Oh my God, what happened?" Charlie almost yelled. Cas looked at her wide eyed in horror at her entrance, but relaxed. "Keep it down, we're in a hospital." He was holding a washcloth to his bottom lip.
Cas sighed and smiled. "Actually, everything's perfect. Just need a minute."
swerving back and forth down the road.
"It can't be that bad Cas."
Adam joined  Cas on his mic.
Dean pushed Cas back and pinned him to the floor, his lips grazing against Cas'. "Not today." He smiled.
"You can't just end your life when there are people who love you. Like your brother."
"Yes. Outside of work. Now go home and get some sleep. See you at work on Monday."
“He lets me ride him.”
Dean just kept looking into Cas’ eyes. “You still got a headache?”
"Please don't call me that..."
*******
He pounded on the door as hard as he could, yelling. Praying it could be heard. He kept hitting the door and jerking the handle, yelling as loud as he could. Someone had to notice, right?
What you want, what you need has been killing me.
"You should go home. You have Jess and the baby to look after. You shouldn't spent your time looking after your brothers widow."
"You're stealing my best line, Winchester."
"Uh, Dean is having a hard time adjusting. He hasn't spoken to anyone." Castiel answered for him. The group councilor, Naomi, looked at Castiel.
They had no idea he was coming home today. They thought he'd be home in two more weeks. He brought Adam home with him so he could meet everyone. Dean thought he was more exited about meeting Cas than anyone else. He asked Adam to walk around town to find everyone and report back. "Their at some diner." Dean smiled. His favorite diner. Perfect. He creeped around town so nobody saw him. He walked around back. He saw the waitress named Emily he went to school with. She was smoking a cigarette. "Hey. Emily." She turned.
Four...
"What do you want to eat Rookie?"
"This is nonsense. You are getting on the first plane back to Los Angeles and taking your company back."
"Yeah, well, I think I'll leave this profession to you."
"No. Not a damn word. I keep checking the hospitals and nothing. I've checked downtown and the drug areas. Nothing." He pinched the bridge of his nose.
He looked at the phone until the screen went dark, then hit the side button so he could see what time it was.
"You need to come home more often." She patted his back. "I'll try." He kissed her cheek and moved to the fridge. "Dean, nice to see you. How are tricks?" Dean smiled. "Pleasure as always Ms Novak. And tricks are good." Cas handed Dean a soda and leaned against the counter. "So I take it you two are back together." She eyed Dean.
"Dean!" He looked up to see Charlie waving frantically at him. "Dude let's go. Early day tomorrow!"
Dean took himself in his hand and stroked slowly, moaning into Cas. "Fuck Dean!" Cas bit his lip as the vibration traveled down his dick to the base. Dean slowed his head but moved his hand faster, moaning again.  Cas dug his nails into the shower wall and fucked himself into Dean's mouth. "Damn...feels so good Dean," He breathed. Dean used his free hand to stroke Cas in rhythm with his mouth.
Cas tilted his head back to look at Mary. "Hi Mrs Winchester."
"I wanna take Cas to the lake. I promised him when I was in Germany."
“What school is in Dallas?” Benny squinted at the envelope for a second before Cas grabbed it from him.
I’ll follow you like
Everyone stood up and started saying their goodbyes. Naomi was in tears naturally. Cas hugged her and kissed her on the forehead. Charlie got a quick picture of Dean and Cas showing of their shirts. Then Dean walked Cas as close to the gate as he could. "If I get a tour date anywhere close to Huston, I'll stop by." Cas smiled. Dean smiled back. "I'm sure we'll Skype and call and text between then."
Dean walked over to Dr Mills. "Will be be okay to tour and perform?"
Hey everyone! I still have quite a bit to do in this story and I well update as much as I can. anyways...
He took one of his shoes off and threw it at the door, connecting with a bang. He fell back on his pillow.
Cas turned to see Dean standing in the doorway. He looked at Cas and winked.
"I'm an hour ahead of you."
"It's so disgusting!"
“When it mattered. And now it matters.”
"He what?!"
"Ha ha, Cas. You're hilarious!"
Everyone sang
They set a date to start filming. The principal sent home permission slips. There were only a few parents in each grade that were still against it and didn't sign. March turned to April. Dean tried out for the soccer team and naturally made the team.
"Morning, master."
"Ummm.... did I just hear what I think I heard? They won't let you do it because you're gay?" Charlie stared at cas wide eyed. Cas paced the courtyard. "Well, because I'm gay and Dean's gay and were gay together and the video will be about me and him so.... that makes it a problem."
"Damn it's good to hear your voice son."
Before anyone could say anything the kid has his pants on and was out the door.
Cas smiled at him. Benny returned it. “Don’t worry, Cas. We’re good.”
Cas drove back to the studio to finish the album. He downloaded a rough cut of the album on Dean's phone so he could listen to it. He got out of the car and walked into the studio. The deadline was in twenty-four hours and they still had to finish two songs. He jumped right on the sound board and polished the unfinished tracks.
“You didn’t, did you?” Silence. Dean continued to avoid Benny’s gaze. Benny laughed and punched Dean in the arm. “Fuck, boy, you couldn’t make it happen!” Dean sighed as he tucked his head to his knees.
Cas took his aviators off. "Same. But with a shot of hazelnut." The barista looked back and forth from Dean to Cas.
*knock knock*
Dean pulled Cas closer then started to sing along.
Castiel looked down at his shirt, then back to Dean.
Again, nothing. Dean heard the door click when Castiel left.
"Do it again."
"It's okay Dean, really. I won't tell Lisa, if that's what you're worried about."
When the song ended and everyone started dancing again, Cas grabbed Dean's hand and pulled him out of the ballroom.
Cas threw himself back on the pillow with a sigh before prying himself out of bed.
“Thinking, huh? Does thinking smell like lilacs and baby farts?” Benny raised an eyebrow at Dean. “I needed to clear my head.” Benny put his hands in his pockets and looked up at the sky. “Uh-huh. Clear your head.” He looked at Dean. “All hooking up gets you is a boat load of problems and a dude who won’t stop calling you.” Dean laughed. “See, you’re not as smart as you think. It wasn’t a dude.”
"Do you even have to ask?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh you have got to be joking. You­ you think he's gonna die."
"Best make up sex ever."
He shrugged and threw some money in the air. People started scrambling for the money, pushing him out of
"Are you freaking kidding me right now?!"
Time slowed to a standstill. Their hearts beating in perfect harmony. Dean slowly removed the towel from around Cas' waist and ran his hand down Cas' leg, moving it so his foot was on the bed. He reached in his pocket and pulled out a condom and set it on the bed. He pulled away and got up, moving to his bag and grabbed a small bottle of lube. He walked back to the bed and took off his jeans and boxers then moved back on top of Cas.
"Did it work?"
"It's no big deal. My family thinks it is. Come eat. I'll point you in the direction of a hotel after."
School that day seemed to drag on for the trio. They were finally in advanced drama. They were supposed to be rehearsing a group project, but Dean had other plans. He remembered the lightsaber battle the three were having his first day and walked backstage. He grabbed four lightsabers and handed them out. "Boys vs girls?" Meg asked. Cas looked at Dean then back to Meg. "Oh we are gonna own you." With that, the battle was on. Dean and Cas stood side by side, lightsabers at the ready. Cas flicked his eyes to Dean, then to Meg. Dean smiled. As soon as the girls charged forward, Both Dean and Cas poked Meg with their lightsabers. Dean quickly avoided and attack from Charlie. "Well, Megs out." Cas smiled.
"Alright, asshats, gather 'round." Cas called to the guys. They all came over and stood in a circle. Cas looked at each of his friends.
Dean huffed a laugh. "Oh yeah?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whenever Dean couldn't sleep, he'd draw. Cas was not the least bit surprised that Dean couldn't sleep last night. He pushed the comforter off and got up. He walked over to the table and sat down. He looked at Dean who was still sound asleep. He then turned his attention to the sketch book and flipped it open. He found what Dean drew last night. It was Cas, fast asleep on the bed. Every little detail was perfect, as usual. From his eyelashes to the ruffled blankets tangled around his waist.
A short time later, they were in line to board the plane. They handed their tickets to the person at the gate and made their way on. Once seated, Cas leaned over and rested his head on Dean's shoulder.
Dean walked over to him slowly, Cas backed up til he was against the counter. Dean gently grabbed his hands and placed then on his chest. He was solid and warm, even had a heartbeat.
Cas pushed his tongue past Dean's lips and began exploring his mouth as his fingers made their way up Dean's shirt.
"First things first, I need a damn shower." Cas said. He stood up and looked at Dean. "Care to join me?" He extended a hand to Dean, wagging his eyebrows. Charlie was jumping up and down squealing.  Dean ignored her and stood up, taking Cas’ hand. "Right behind ya."
Castiel woke up and decided to shower. He grabbed some clothes and went into the bathroom. He stripped and stepped inside, letting the hot water wash over him. Being here, under the same roof as Dean for a week, had to be cruel and unusual punishment. He cleaned himself off and got out, grabbing a towel  and drying off. He ran the towel through his hair and got dressed. After, he headed downstairs to get some coffee.  He poured himself a cup and headed out to the front porch.
Dean looked around the stables, finding Crowley handing his horse over to a man. He walked over to him. "Hey," he spun Crowley around. "I saw what you did to my boyfriend. You have a blade in your whip. You hit my boyfriend with it. Let me tell you something, if he didn't tell me not to beat the living shit out of you trust me, you wouldn't be standing right now. If I ever see your face at another track, I will find you and you won't know what hit you." He patted Crowley roughly on the shoulder. "Good talk." Crowley turned as Dean walked away. "And uh, who exactly, are you?"
Cas pulled out of Dean and flipped him over, pulling him up at the same time so that he was flush against him. The glass table shattered as soon as Dean was off of it. Cas shrugged.
"Why? It's a natural human instinct."
"Nobody has called me that in a long time." Castiel said calmly.
For now, he was just gonna act like nothing was wrong and basically bury himself with work until he decided what to do. Stupid? Probably. Should he just call Dean? Yes. Was he going to? Fuck no. Why? He didn't even know the answer to that. Instead, he was gonna drive to the airport, get on a plane, go back to LA, and go on tour. Ignoring his problems instead of facing them...as usual.
"Shut up."
“Went through.” Dean said.
Dean looked at Cas, his noise maker hanging between his lips.
Cas was sitting on the floor in front of his locker playing with his class ring. He looked down the hallway. A group of girls were hugging and crying. "Oh please. You'll probably never speak to each other after a few months." He said to himself. He looked back at his ring. "You look like someone peed in your Cheerios." Charlie sat next to him. Cas let his head fall back to his locker. "It's just weird. This year went by so fast. Hell these last two weeks went by fast."
Taking that as a cue, Castiel changed the subject.
"So this chick gets a whole hair and make up team and what do we get? 'Wear your own clothes and go play in the abandoned haunted hotel. I can live with this."
"What do you mean?"
“Cas.” Dean corrected.
"Y'all stayin for supper?"
Cas whistled."Congratulations, Mr Winchester." Mr Surley shook Dean's hand. Dean flipped his tassel to the side and walked back to his seat. The rest of the students were called.
He put the keyboard in front of him. "Okay, so as some of you know, I kinda disappeared after my mom died a few months ago, and ended up in the hospital because I'm a dumb ass and overdosed. Anywhore, this song kinda reflects that."
Naomi lost it. She was doubled over in laughter. "Well that went like planned." Cas fixed his shirt and tie. Next to him, Dean was laughing too.
He grabbed his phone and pulled up Dean's Facebook.
“I know. Just...forget it. Come on, it's your turn.”
“Better?”
"Asshat, I'm not going to meet my brother's new bride in my wet boxers."
“Do you?”
So I decided to keep the going back and forth between past and present up until the wedding. Meaning next chapter as well. ENJOY!
His eyes shot open and he sat up. Sam was standing over him.
Dean cried out a loud moan.
"See, guys? He's more than just a spandex­ clad ass."
Cas stepped up to the mic. As soon as the music played, Cas sang into the microphone.
It seemed more and more he would think about Dean just as much as he thought about school or starting his business. Dean must hate him by now. It had been a year after all.
Dean smiled. There was the old Cas. One by one, the pool balls were sunk into various pockets. As Cas sank the eight ball, Dean smiled. "Nice to see you haven't lost your touch." Cas stood up from the table. "I'm actually surprised. It's been years since I've played."
The shot went to an extreme close up of Cas' face. His blue eyes looking at the camera.
“We leave in fifteen minutes. We take the Jeep. I wanna be there by nightfall.”
"But just imagine the look on the doc's face if she walked in and..."
"Hell yes, you did! Dude that rocked! I can't wait to see it! Charlie, I expect an email when it's ready!"
“Oh like you want me to.”
"Whoa, you have a dog." The German Shepherd puppy lifted her head and sniffed in Dean's direction. "Yeah. She won't bite. She's probably gotten your sent off me by now. That's why she's sniffing. To see if she knows you. Her name is Mystic by the way." Mystic laid her head back down on the couch.
Cas stepped out of the dorm building and slung his backpack over his shoulder. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and looked at the lock screen. It was a picture of him and his friends at the pool hall the night before he left. He often wondered how they were doing. He especially thought about Dean and the last night they were together, in his Impala out by the pond. He sighed and put his phone in his pocket and started walking. "Hey! Castiel!" He turned. Jimmy came running up behind him. Jimmy was from New York and was no stranger to the big city. Cas on the other hand, he had to drop his Texas accent just so people would take him seriously here.
“I'm coming in peace this time.
“Okay, and what about the rest? About Meg?” he asks, curious what Cas is going to say this time.
“Dammit, Cas, nobody invites you here!” yells Dean, but he still doesn’t turn his head around, so Cas sits next to him.
“Shh, everything will be okay. Stop crying. You're safe. We're gonna protect you.”
Dean is walking around the room until he's sure that Jack fell asleep. He puts him on the cradle and goes away, thinking about something stronger to drink. A beer isn't enough, not after all of this.
on tumblr!
Dean takes one of the papers, this one which is on top. He gives it to Cas, and next he sits next to him.
“He looks like him,” says Dean one morning. He flips a pancake on the other side, and tries to avoid Sam’s eyes. His brother gives him some time, but when Dean doesn’t elaborate, he pushes him a little.
“Yeah, it's no big deal.” Dean shrugs, and Sam smiles with gratitude.
“It's good to have you back, Cas. It's really good…” Dean says all of this with happy smile on his face, but also with a big relief. He knows everything will change, and he believes everything will be fine. With all of them, they can be a family again. And this time, he won't let anything bad happen to ones he cares about.
“Fuck off!” John yells at the start.
“Yeah, thanks. And Cas, just remember you're family,” says Sam and then his mouth moves silently
Pain isn’t the worst, not the physical one. Cas can handle that, but seeing all this stuff, all of his mistakes and biggest regrets, makes that he’s done. He doesn’t want to see this anymore, he would do everything to get just five minutes of peace, five minutes without nightmares.
“Yeah, sure. It's my job, right?”
John gasps and chocks own saliva, but Cas is gone already.
“Cas…” Dean runs his finger through Cas’ hair as gently as he can and kisses the top of his head.
Dean wakes up slowly, he opens his eyes and the first thing he does is looking at Cas and smiles.
“Are you?” he asks, but this time the answer doesn’t come. He takes it as a ‘yes’. “Dean, you know, he’s an angel. And the angels… they don’t see gender, just souls.”
“Than you should?” she repeated. “I think you should love whoever you want...”
Kelly's body is very light, Sam shudders to think that she was a living human just a half an hour ago. She took the last breath when her son was born, sacrificing herself for him.
Cas opens the door and walks into the room. Dean is in his pajama already, but he's checking something on his phone.
Cas is sitting in the kitchen. Alone. He tried to go to sleep, but after two hours he just gave up. He doesn't want to bother Dean again, that's why he decides to wait for the morning here. He knows as a human he should sleep every day, but it's not so easy, not when he risks having nightmares.
Dean wakes up first, Cas a few seconds later. He's a little weak, but stable.
“Jack. His name is Jack. Stop being a jerk!”
“I… I'm sorry Cas, I just wanna checked something,” he explains, but still stays close with a hand on Cas' neck.
Dean rocks a baby calmly, not shaking him to fast. He knows it’s not good for kids, but he’s not sure where he read about that, probably in some shitty magazine, accidentally for sure.
“It sounds poetic.”
Sam looks surprised, but he answers, scratching his head: “Yeah, of course, a few times. I think Jess was my first true love. Why are you asking?”
“Dean!” Cas sits and wraps his arms around him, gripping him tight. He buries his face in the crook of his neck, they have never been so close to each other.
Cas is surprised that it was so easy. Saying this. His heart is a lot of lighter now.
He didn't actually remember why he stopped wearing them. Maybe because he felt a little too old for ripped jeans? But it's not like he's going anywhere today, he can wear it in the bunker.
“Hello, Dean.”
“I noticed he's sneaking somewhere all the time,” explains Sam, and Cas frowns. It’s not true, he went once to the grocery store, but he was with Dean there.
“Goodbye,” says Jack and disappears. Whatever. Dean gets to the Impala, and everything is awesome. Oh, he has a dog, and it's almost like Cas. Because Cas is kinda like a talking dog. Peachy.
“Come on barbecue on next Sunday. I think Mary will find peanut butter and jam for you,” invites him John.
“A gift. For you,” he explains, and gives him a cup with a bottle of honey in it. “Cas, I'm sorry.”
From this moment, he uses a typewriter more often. He has no idea when he writes his first poem.
“That’s later.” Dean smirked and leaned for another kiss. Why? Because he could.
“No, it's delicious, but my throat…”
Dean looks at him, he sees a few ugly cuts, and one awful bruise on his ribs. He touches it, and Cas hisses.
Dean’s heart skipped a beat, and he held a breath.
“Thank you for everything, Cas… Forgive me,” whispers Dean, and comes closer to the pyre. He lights the torch and throws this. One minute later the black smoke floats up to the sky.
“I'm scared, Dean.”
“My body... It's different now. You did this to me, right?” asks Dean and clears his throat nervously.
So...
"Fuck!"
Gabriel drew a cross over his chest. "Cross my heart bro."
He turned to Dean. “What color do you want?”
The interview went on longer than expected. When Dean walked out of the office, Sam stood up. Dean stopped in front of him. "June. I leave for training in June. I'll come back in around mid November. Then I wait for my orders. If I make it through training." Sam smiled. "You'll make it. Dad did." Their dad was a WWI veteran. He didn't talk much about the war. Hell, he didn't talk much at all after he got home.
Just say I do
"When did you get here?"
Cas already knew what to say. "Make me come." Dean shuttered at the sound, the need in his voice. He tilted his head back and moaned. He trust into Cas hard and fast, hand still in rhythm. Cas moaned loudly as he came. Dean put his hand over the tip of Cas' dick, making sure none got on the couch. He wiped his hand on his shirt. Grabbing Cas' hips He moved him back and forth, slamming Cas on his dick. Cas continued to moan. "I'm gonna come inside you. Gonna come so hard." He moaned. He slowed himself for a moment, trying to make himself last just a bit longer. Then he couldn't help himself. Hearing Cas moaning sent him over the edge. He tilted his head back again, moaning as he came. He thrust a few more times then pulled out.
Dean looked at him. "What?" Cas grabbed his shirt off the floor. "Nothing. You just acted weird for a second." Cas tugged his shirt over his head. "I did? Well, I was wondering how they even got my number." He pushed his arm through the sleeves. "I should get going. Mom wants to do something to celebrate my new found sobriety. She also invited you to dinner tonight as part of the celebration." He smiled at him. "Yeah, sounds fun."
"Alright then. Welcome to the label boys." As soon as they got home, they freaked out."Oh my fucking God we just got fucking signed!!" High fives and hugs were shared. Tears threatened Cas' eyes. He had made it.As they guys celebrated, Cas walked into his room and pulled out his phone. He dialed it."Hey there, Perfect Disaster."
Cas pushed the rest of the way in slowly, taking time only to find the sweet spot. He thrust inside and pushed on the bundle of nerves. Dean cried out, grabbing a fist full of sheets. Cas moved his hips faster, hitting Dean's prostate every time. He took Dean in his hand and stroked, matching his rhythm. Dean was writhing beneath Cas. "Oh my God, Cas..."
Cas put his face in his hands and sobbed. "Oh! Oh, yikes. Castiel, what...?"
*****
Dean backed up and stared at the door. He took a deep breath. And then he ran full speed into the door, crashing through it. Dean realized he was in a side room off of the kitchen. He turned and headed toward Cas' room.
Inside the country club bathroom, Dean was trying to tie his tie. He wasn't succeeding. His fingers seemed to have forgotten how to do this.
Cas pushed his hand down on the wound, squeezing his eyes shut and grunting in pain. "It didn't hit any vitals. It did go all the way through though." Dean moved so he could see his back. "I see it. What do I do?"
Is it the look in your eyes?
I think I wanna marry you.
Sam grinned. “Uh-huh. Sure Dean. Anyway, time for breakfast.”
He slowly moved his hands down to the waistline of Dean's jeans, unbuttoning and unzipping them. As he push them down, Dean's boxer briefs went along for the ride. His hard dick springing out.
Twelve Years Ago
"Like you said. It's been awhile." Dean pulled Cas' shirt over his head and tossed it aside, then he took of his own. Cas ran his hands along Dean's torso. Dean was even more built than he was when they graduated. "College football has been good to you."
"Dean, your turn."
“The Betas just help where ever they're needed.” Sam said.
They broke into teams; Cas and Dean, Adam and Meg, Benny and Charlie. They rotated who played winner for most of the night.
"Oh yeah. It's four AM there right?"
"You're welcome."
Jo sighed. "Get a move on Winchester. You don't want to be alone forever do you?" Dean took a swig of his beer. "No, you know what happens to those people." Most of them committed suicide before the age of thirty. Jo shrugged and continued through the room.
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean. “Honey, please. I have been locked in this house for weeks. Yes. I’m driving.”
“Dunno, haven't been able to ask.” Alec replied.
"What the fuck are you talking about?"
Cas took a deep breath to calm himself down. "Okay. Let me make sure I got this right. You invited me to a fake wedding at my ex-whatever's family ranch in hopes that he and I would reconnect and make up because you were one hundred percent sure that we would work it out. Am I in the ballpark?"
He began to grind his hips against Dean's so that their elections were pressed together. Dean reached down and took Cas in his hand, stroking him roughly, twisting a little when he reached the head. Cas threw his head back and stifled a yell.
Cas jumped on beat, already a giant ball of energy. His classmates fed off it and started dancing around.
"Dean...collapsed lung...can't breath..."
The crowd cheered. Some headed to the bar, some continued eating. Cas jumped down and took another shot. Smiling at Dean.
"You have three seconds to tell me before I strip search you."
Thank you guys so much for the comments!!! They really keep me going so keep then coming!!!
Dean pulled back and looked at Cas, not knowing if he should be slightly worried about what might be in store for him or if he should just whisk his clothes off because this was pretty damned hot. Cas decided for him.
“I'm so happy, Dean,” he says. “And I love you too, of course.”
“You can go back to sleep, after you put me on the Earth,” he tries again, but the Empty doesn’t seem to be convinced.
“I know you're angry, but… I just wanted to help, and I think I did it.”
“Look, I don't know what they are teaching you about rescuing people from Hell at Angels Sunday school, but you changed some things in my appearance.”
Sam is waiting for them there already, he gives Cas a quick hug and pats his back a few times.
“Shh, Jack, it's okay.” Cas tried to calm the baby, after Jack was eating again, he looked at Dean. “I can't risk that one day you'll kick us out!”
He hesitated just a moment before he walked back in the library. Dean sat still there, but something on his face changed. He looked shocked, but also so soft. His fingers were touching his lips, the place when Cas kissed him a moment ago.
“Dean, you don't even have straight legs,” chuckles Sam. “And I still remember when I found you in the motel room with that twins before you went to hell. I'm pretty sure, one of them was a guy.”
“Dean, is it a real food?” asks Cas on the next day, after Dean gave him a bowl of gruel to eat.
He moves closer to Cas, and kisses him in the mouth. Cas freezes, and when they pull away, he gasps shocked.
Cas' hand finds Dean's left shoulder.
They sit at the counter and order two beers. While they're waiting for drinks, Dean is looking at some brunet from head to foot.
“What? Why do you think I could write poetry? And what is it? Interrogation?” he asks maybe a little too much nervously.
“Bitch.”
“You should to sleep. Sam looks like a piece of shit because of you, so what do you say about one full night's sleep, huh? You can do this for Sam, right?” Dean whispers to the baby words of comfort, and Jack looks like he's listening to him. He stops crying, and now he's just staring at Dean with his big blue eyes. That gaze breaks something in Dean's heart. He doesn't want to see Cas in him, but he can't pretend that he sees Lucifer, either. It would be a lie.
“I'm glad you like it. We could do this more often, you know, there's a lot of places which you should to know. Movie theater, bowling club, ice rink, zoo... I'm convinced you're gonna love the last one.”
Dean plans to kiss him hard, but when their lips connect, it becomes something soft and gently, full of affection.
“You look tired,” points Cas. “But I’m sure you’re still beautiful, Dean.”
Dean nodded as he downed his shot. "Yup. And now that's not a problem anymore."
"So, oh fearless one. Where to now?"
Dean snapped his head back, connecting with Alec's nose, hearing it break. Dean turned around. Grabbing Alec's shoulder, he swept his leg and hitting his foot, pushing him backwards. Alec's head bounced off the floor. Dean grabbed his hair and slammed Alec's head into the floor, snarling.
"What's the point in celebrating if I can't celebrate with the person I care about the most?"
"Son of a bitch." He muttered.
Cas beamed at Dean. Dean spoke to the fans.
“We're twenty-one now.” Alec added.
"I'm right here, ya know."
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
Dean nodded, flicking the ashes of his cigarette. He pulled the pack out and offered one to Cas. He took one and Dean lit it for him. "Thanks."
“I gave it to you because I could tell you wanted it. Sam and Alec made a huge deal out of it too. So did Charlie. She literally bounced around my cabin singing about me having a crush on you.” He smiled.
“Did you mean it?” asks Dean, finally. He knows they would have this conversation sooner, or later. And maybe sooner is better option. Cas came back only a few hours ago, and for the first time he is alone with Dean. “What you said before the Empty took you?”
Instead, he grips Cas tighter.
, he tried to keep himself from this hard, but Cas was making it so difficult.

“Yeah, of course.”
He doesn't know that. But there's one thing which he's certainly sure. They were family, and only it mattered.
“I'm here!” He hears Dean's voice from the kitchen. He comes storming there and exhales with relief. Dean is carrying Jack in his arms. He's got the sleeves rolled up, and on his left shoulder a terry nappy. There’s also the empty bottle on the worktop.
“Okay,” says Dean with a relief. And Cas is more confused than a moment earlier.
Dean doesn't understand at once. He blinks twice, and then he realizes what Sam is trying to tell him.
“What’s going on?”
“Yeah, I know…” he mumbles. “I meant… Never mind.”
“No, I wasn't,” denies Dean nervously, and takes a sip of a beer.
“Okay, I understand. I think it’s clear now,” he says, frowning like he is thinking about something really hard.
“What? No!”
on tumblr.
“What's wrong? I heard raised voices,” he says.
They pull away, and Cas can't stop staring at Dean. He doesn't say anything, too much overwhelmed by all of this.
“Sit here,” says Dean, pointing at the stool. “I need to dress your wound. It can be unpleasant, just hold on, okay? I'm gonna use a herb ointment and bandage. You'll be better tomorrow, I promise.”
“So what, you thought it would be a great idea? Trapping me in some shitty romcom? What was the point?” he asks, still not understanding anything of this.
“Should I bought something? Flowers?”
“Nothing,” he says and changes subject. “Aren't you tired too? I can finish research alone.”
“I just wanted to show you something… Don't be mad, Dean,” begs Charlie.
Dean goes outside with his new friend, and Cas knows why. They're going to have sex. In a hotel room? Or maybe at the backseat of the Impala? Is he likes that woman a little, or she's just pretty and attractive to him? If Dean will be enjoying this act? Maybe he needs to release a tension and that's all, but why he couldn't do this alone in his room without any stranger? Cas shouldn't think like this, it's selfish and unfair, but he can't stop it. He's really glad that Dean hits on the girls rarely recently. The hunter is much older now than that day when they met, so probably his libido decreased a little.

“So, I would love to go there with you.”
“I… Okay.” He didn't feel comfortable, hearing things like this. Fortunately, Cas changes subject.
“I've gotcha, I've gotcha…” whispers Dean, and he has, indeed, gotcha him. Cas feels safe for the first time since Metatron took him his grace away.
There’s 'Jeg elsker deg’ when they’re taking a shower together even if Cas doesn’t need showers.
Cas changed Jack's diaper, read him a story which a baby couldn't understand, and put him in the cradle where he could sleep. An hour later, he looked out the window and saw that Impala was still there. It was almost evening, and it was a long day for all of them. Cas went outside and knocked in the car's window. Dean opened a door, but didn't say anything.
thinks Cas.
“Hello, Dean,” he croaks before his legs refuse to carry him any longer. If Dean didn't catch him, he would’ve landed on his knees on the floor. Maybe it would've been better? He could've slept on that floor, it looks even comfy.
Sam frowns his eyebrows, confused even more than a few seconds ago. Dean with a Jack in his arms is a surprising view, and the fact that he wants to take care of a baby longer, giving him a time to take a shower, and also makes a breakfast, is something unexpected. What happened that Dean changed his attitude to their situation?
on tumblr.
He wants to take his pants off at once, but he realizes that actually he gotta pee. He goes to the dingy toilet and takes a deep breath before he removes his belt and lowers his trousers…
Human!Cas and what if Dean didn't kick him out from the bunker.
“Yes, Dean. Of course, I have a coffee.”
“The stuff. Reading, walking around, but mostly thinking.”
“Hi, sunshine.” He kisses him again, it still feels weird, kissing the love of his life and being kissed by him with the same fondness. Dean never dreamt about it, he thought an apple pie life isn't meant for him. There again, he could have it for years.
“Poetry?”
“No, Dean, I know this. Hunters don't have family… The point is, Jack is probably the best thing which happened to us. And I wanna be for him the same father as you were for me.”
He doesn’t feel a venom anymore. Because Dean’s lips taste like
Dean doesn’t answer at once, and Cas thinks he’s sipping his coffee right now.
“Of course!”
This Dean is nice, but Cas isn't sure if he's not
“No, no, Dean. You don’t understand. I don’t feel any effects of the poison, just a… taste. I think it’s a more mental thing,” explains Cas, calming Dean up.
Dean isn't sure what he's asking about. How long did he want to kiss him? Or how long does he love him?
“I’m not sure if it works like that…” Cas rolls his eyeballs and tries to kiss him, but Dean doesn’t finish this conversation yet, so he just gives him a little peck in the corner of his mouth.
Every time Cas is in Dean’s room, he looks at the typewriter. He’s always wondering when Dean used it last time…
“Whatcha doin', Sammy?”
“I won't stop you,” says another voice.
Dean Winchester is bisexual in every universe, so that fake version in Brazil falls in love with Cas at once. And they're kissing so bad...
Dressing wounds is unpleasant, but necessary, so Cas tries to handle this with dignity. The ointment stinks and is cold, even warm Dean's hand doesn't help with that. Cas breathes a huge sigh of relief after they finish.
“Yes, Sammy, but you, on the other hand, has some problem with ears. I'm not gonna talking with you about the son of Satan.”
Cas takes a few steps closer to him and puts his hand on Dean's arm. He tries to catch his eyes.
“Yes, Dean, of course,” says Cas calmly, understanding what Dean tries to say.
“Okay.”
Dean walks, looking for any sign of civilizations. After a few hours he finds some shitty Gas-N-Sip. He’s so thirsty that he drinks all bottle of water, then he notices a big mirror. He comes closer and stares at his reflection a long minute. Is he has more masculine jaw? Maybe it’s just a trick of lights. He pulls the shirt up to see his chest. There are no scars. Not only those which he earned on the hunting trips, but also
“I-I don't know.”
“Good things do happen, Dean,” he says.
This sentence changes everything. Dean doesn't expect coming out, so he turns red at once, and mumbles some 'Sorry', taking another sip of his beer. Cas feels relief, now everything should be better.
“What favor?” asks Dean. It's curious because Jody always calls him for help.
“Dean...” whispers Cas, gulping. He looks a little surprised, but also soft and lovely. His eyes are full of something strange and new for Dean, he has never seen it's before in these two sapphires.
each other,” he suggests.
“Oh, God, you're the best,” he said, taking the first sip. “I feel like a dumbass now.”
“Yes?”
“I would like to.”
“Good. I prefer blue the most… I think we can find you somebody, the bar is full today,” says Dean, looking around to find a target.
“And actually, I just wait for my dessert in my home!” he says a little too loud, looking in John’s eyes with a bitch face and grabbing Dean's arm gently.
“So, what is your type?”
Dean hesitates for the moment, before he adds: “And… I have also you, right?”
“Yeah, thanks…” says Dean, and the waitress walks away.
Cas. He could imagine a situation on the case where the angel makes up something like this. It's cute, and he can't help smile. Cas is talking all the time, and he looks so fascinated of this subject that watching him is all pleasure.
Something on fake Meg's face changes, she looks like she has fun. Cas needs just a short moment to realize who is that.
“Dean, you can't go alone on the hunting trip, it's reckless.”
“All right.”
Cas has no idea what woke him up. He also has no idea where he actually is. He can see only darkness and emptiness. Nobody's here…
New chapter, still a little angst!
“I ain’t exactly a role model,” says Dean, and grins. Cas tilts his head, and looks at him with a whole love and compassion to his person.
“Sorry 'bout what?” murmurs Dean, still reading something on his laptop. It's hard to resist to not look at Cas, but he's doing his best.
They're walking to the bed and sit there, Dean has his hand behind his back, it doesn't escape Cas' notice.
Jack yawns and rubs his eyes. He’s a nephil, and he doesn’t sleep a lot, but sometimes even he needs his “four hours”.
Dean takes two glasses and pours whiskey to them. Cas gets one glass, and they drink it down.
Is it some better place? Or a hell for the angels? Is he suffering now? Will he suffer forever? And maybe it's just darkness, emptiness... He doesn't want to know because the answer could be even more destructive to him...
“Yes,” agrees Cas, and then he adds quickly: “But it wasn’t pleasant. He was trying to kill me… And I wasn’t attracted to him at all.”
Dean hides it behind his back like some dirty secret.
“You're not broken, Dean. And you can love whoever you want.”
Dean comes closer to him and scratches his head nervously. He tries to smile, but it's not easy: “I didn't know that angels can feel that way… Um, I'm not good at talking about that stuff, but I like you, Cas. I mean, I like you more than friend.”
“It's not about him! But he was right, that I'm damaged!” he interrupts him a little too loud. He doesn’t want to fight, not now and not because of this.
… At least that’s what people say.
“What?” Cas blinked twice.
Cas puts his hand on Dean's shoulder, and he's trying to catch his eyes, but Dean just nods and moves to the car immediately. Castiel sits on the back seats.
“Stop being bitchy.”
“Is it.. Is it like in your dream?” he asks, caressing Cas' cheek.
Dean nods and opens a little in front of him. Cas always can make him to say about feelings.
“So, may I ask why you have never hooked up?”
Dean was washing dishes, and Cas came to help him. They were doing it in silence, feeling a tension in the air. Tomorrow everything will get back to normal. But Cas didn't want any normal. Not anymore.“
Sam wants to have a kid because 'Dean Albus Severus' sounds great! He fucks with some random woman who gives him a son later. Then he erases her from the existence and from all photos. Dean Jr. thinks he's an alien without a mother.
“Cas, it wasn’t my words. I didn’t write this song,” he says, and Cas is even more confused.
“What the hell are you talking about, you friggin fag?!” he yells furious.
“What happened there?” asks Sam who notices that something is wrong.
Cas nods. Of course, it's just repaid, when Dean pays off the debt, he won't be owed him anything, and Cas will need to leave. How much time he has? A few days? Weeks? Maybe months?
Dean closes the door with free hand, the other one is still grabbing Cas’ arm. He seats the angel on his bed, wondering how to start this conversation. Cas looks around, and his eyes stops for the moment on the typewriter. He sees only a few pieces of paper. Dean notices what Cas is staring at, and he thinks he knows what he should say first.
He closes his eyes and calms a breath down. Cas is a priority, he needs to take him to a real world. To home. Nothing else matters.
Sam pulls out his cell phone from the pocket.
“Dean?” It's not like Cas didn't expect to see Dean again, of course, he did, but not like this, not here and not so fast after their paths split apart.
“Dean, I don’t want it!” he yells, looking at him with anger. After a few seconds, his face softness, and he asks calmly: “Can we come back to the bunker, now?”
“Next week. And I wondered… Could you be my cover? If dad asks?”
thinks Mary. She isn't ready for this conversation yet, but here she is… She read once about talking with kids about
“And what do you think about it? Good?”
Dean takes the catalogue and opens it on the random page.
“What the hell are you talking about? You're leaving?” asks Dean, not believing in this. Cas couldn't just leave, right? But Cas nods to confirm his words. “And what about me?”
Sam takes a sip of his beer and waits, but nothing more comes from Cas' mouth.
“I'm gonna bath him now,” says Dean one evening. Another step, another task, another thing he should do to help his brother.
But he won't. Because on the next day, Mary Winchester is dead. And Castiel is dead too. Dead in Dean's eyes.
“Wait, I'll make you one, and you can sit there and drink a coffee. We have a full pot.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas didn’t look at him, and he didn’t answer, just started playing with one of his sleeve. He was really upset about the earlier situation, and also scared that Dean could be mad at him. He hadn’t words for that, so he chose silence.
Dean tries not to think about Cas, and the phone call helps him with that. He gives a quick look on the screen. It’s Jody. He picks up the phone and puts on speakerphone.
“Cas?” Dean is looking for him, but he’s not in the living room or bedroom. He finds him out in the kitchen. Is Cas baking? He has a flour, sugar and two bowls.
Dean stares at him, but says nothing, Cas huffs and asks him again.
There’s 'Ya tebe kahayu’ when they’re watching a movie.
Cas isn't a real angel anymore. He rebelled and ran away from Heaven. Now, the Earth and the Winchesters are his family. He needs them, maybe even more than they need him.
he begins.
“Dean, you should eat something. And don't you want to drink coffee too? I can do it for you,” offers Cas, and Dean grips him even tighter, burying his face in the crook of Cas' neck.
“Sammy, it's already over...” he says, walking to the baby.
“So what stop you?” she asked politely.
“Okay, as you wish,” says Dean eventually, it’s weird that he gives up so fast. When Cas relaxes a little bit, he grabs his shirt quickly and pulls it up.
Dean turns on music because he's not ready to talk with Cas, he doesn't even want to hear Cas' voice. After a few minutes, he catches himself at peeking in the rearview mirror.
“I don't know, but he's alive, I feel a pulse... Okay, I need to go into his head and pull him out.”
Sam shifts in his seat and huffs. Dean wants to say something, of course, but it’s not going to be easy to get information. Sam doesn’t want to push him too much.
“Keep the rest,” he said, but the lady shook his head.
“What?” he asks, frowning.
“Cas, you're gonna be tired tomorrow… Come to bed, buddy.”
“You think?” asks Dean, checking in the mirror how his butt looks in these trousers.
“Yes.”
Dean smiles for the first time since they started talking, and this gesture calms Cas down.
“What about him?”
“I'm not angry,” he repeats. “I just realized something today, and I need to think about it. That's all.”
“Dean,” he interrupted him. “Come with me, I want to show you something.”
“Did you mean it?” asks Dean, finally. Cas is back from the Empty and they need to have this conversation.
“It's okay, Sam. He's not mine… I think I'm going to find some liquor store.”
“Sometimes.”
Dean grabs his arm anyway, for the extra support. Cas hasn't been in the bunker many times earlier, so he's not sure where they're going. Dean guides him to the bathroom.
“No, it's okay Cas... To be honest I wish Jody would call to you more often.”
After that he just walked away like always. But in the corridor he reminded himself of what he wanted. He needed a book about witches, but instead... A real terror appeared across his face, and he took a sharp breath. He kissed Dean. HE KISSED DEAN! Okay, it wasn't his fault. Dean asked about it. Dean wanted to be kissed. By Cas... But no. Dean would've never wanted to be kissed by him. Never.
“After you.”
Cas stays in the garage for a moment longer. He raises his fingers to his mouth slowly, just to process what actually happened.
“The Shadow?”
Dean is patting Jack’s back gently until he burps. A baby possets some milk on the nappy: “That's it, buddy. You're doing great.”
Dean looked at Cas and later at the baggage. He couldn't help the big grin, it was the best news he could receive.
They’re riding in silence for a moment before Dean speaks again. He’s not sure how actually he should start this conversation. And if he should do this at all.
“I'm supposed.”
“You didn’t? I don’t understand, it was about you and Mary…”
“What? I didn’t say anything wrong!” he yells.
"Good. I'll be by to check on you all later. Bye."
“I don't really cook, so this is pretty fancy. Consider yourself high enough on the totem pole to get lunch meat on bread. Oh, and I got adventurous and put some mayo on it, too.”
The man gestured Cas into an alley. He looked around with his hands in his pockets.
******************************
“What Dean?” He pulled away just a fraction. Dean locked his eyes onto Cas', going from jade to emerald. Cas had almost forgotten that Dean's eye color changed with his mood. Even when he had just been admiring these eyes from afar he could almost tell by the color what mood Dean was in. Forest when he was happy or excited, juniper when he was mad or upset, and jade or emerald when he was passionate. Not just the sex kind of passionate, it was the same when he was on the field sometimes. Dean said nothing he grabbed the box and walked backward to his bed, setting the box on the floor next to it as he lay on top of it. Cas flipped the shoe box open and grabbed the bottle of lube and the dildo, squirting a couple drops on it then rubbing it around. “I want to try something, but if it's to much at any time, tell me and I'll stop.” Dean nodded and closed his eyes. Cas put the tip of the dildo on Dean's hole, with his free hand he slowly stroked Dean's dick. He slowly pushed the dildo inside Dean, working it in for a good few minutes. Cas grabbed the lube and squirted a few drops on his dick and worked it around for a few seconds the put the tip on Dean's hole, pulling the dildo out a little. “This might hurt or be uncomfortable but if you can ride it out, I promise you won't regret it.” Dean kept his eyes closed. He nodded, taking a deep breath. Cas very slowly and carefully pushed the tip in. Dean squeezed his eyes shut, confirming for Cas that he's never done this before. In a way, it both scared and excited him. He didn't want to hurt Dean, well, not much, only in a sexual way that he knows will feel good. That's what excited him. Dean trusted him enough to try new thing, explore and take time to appreciate sex, not just have sex to have sex. What really surprised Cas was that Dean trusted him this much in the few days that they have been talking. His slowly pushed in a little more, squeezing his own eyes shut at the feeling of Dean contracting around him. He heard Dean suck in a breath through his teeth and his eyes shot open. “Dean?”
"Please. Not in my nature. Next question."
"I don't know what to say." Cas finally said. He looked back down at it. It looked exactly like the pictures but with no color. "I love it."
Cas sighed. "Yeah... lunch and errands with my family. Joy." He took another sip.
“Get him in!” One yelled, clearly an Alpha.
Cause I'm barely here at all.
"Pssst, hey..."
Dean quietly unwrapped the present and opened the box. It was a sketch book and new pencils. The sketch book was bound in leather with gold embroidery. Also embroidered in gold, was his name in a beautiful cursive script. Dean looked up. "It's beautiful Cas."
"No dammit! Just...no! Just tell me what's going on with Cas."
Castiel has never been in love before, but he likes all of these warm feelings in his heart, even if he thinks he can’t have Dean ever. He likes to be close to him, and he takes every opportunity to spend time together. It's enough for him, it must be enough. He sometimes dreams about kissing Dean or maybe even about something more, but he knows it's not going to happen. And it's okay. The thing is, if Cas had to decide to some physical intimacy with somebody, it would be Dean. Nobody else, just Dean. And that's why he doesn't like when Dean flirts with waitresses or strange women in the bar for him.
Dean put the emergency button five times like it could speed up everything. Of course, nothing happened, so he did it a few more times. Cas gasped. Again. Dean smirked and started putting a button even harder, just to tease with Cas a little, but the angel didn’t react anymore to this. He stayed a very calm actually, and Dean was bored a minute later.
“He kissed you,” says Dean very casually, taking a bag from the trunk. His movements are slowly like he’s trying to buy some time to have this conversation.
“What thing?”
“You deserve to hear the truth. And that’s it. That’s my truth, Dean. I’ve never met someone like you, and I won’t for the rest of my life.” Cas leans to him, and kisses him softly. “I love you.”
Dean tenses up, feeling a lump in his throat.
Dean thinks it's over, but then Sam starts again: “So, have you ever...”
Cas felt excited, he signed a card carefully, and came to Dean’s room. The hunter was sitting on his bed, checking something on the phone.
“I see… But still, I’m sorry. You deserve for a happy life with family.”
“I love you, Dean,” said Cas softly with all feelings for this wonderful man.
“Love is a strong word, but yes, it’s one of the options.”
“Hello Mary. Hello Sam,” Cas greets when the door opens. He doesn't even look at John, just immediately goes to living room where are the rest of their friends: Eileen, Charlie, Jody, Donna, Bobby, Rufus…
Crowley is dead, Mom is gone and Cas… He can't say this loud, he can't even think about this because when he admits that Cas is dead, it becomes real, and he isn’t ready for this. He will never be ready for this.
“Do you have some fetish?” asks Dean, smirking.
“No, I had a nice dream, actually.”
“And what was that for?” asks Dean after.
“Because it was. It wasn't just pulling him out from hell, it was some... magnificent. Touching and rebuilding his soul, the brightest soul I've ever seen, the soul of the Righteous Man, I...” he stops, seeing Mary's smile. He doesn't want to say too much.
Dean has no idea what she said to him, but he knows it can't be a bad thing. It was Jody, the best badass he has ever met!
“No!” he answers a little too fast and too loud. That's strange.
You can find it
“It’s complicated. Technically, I can be attracted to anyone. It doesn’t matter to me how they look or what is their gender, but I need a deep psychic bond first. Then I can see somebody as attractive.”
“What do you mean, sweetie?” she asks with concern.
“Sam, why Dean is angry at me?” asks Cas. He knows something is wrong, but he doesn't understand what exactly.
“Sunflowers!” Cas grinned at him, and something shined in his eyes. He looked so happy like he just got some precious item, not just stupid flowers. Dean was surprised, not for the first time, that his angel can be so delighted because of so simple gift.
Memories come back to him fast: he rescued Cas from the Empty, he said the first 'I love you', they kissed and the rest of the day, they spent in each other's arms. None of them wanted to pull away first. And that's why they are here now, he and Cas, so close to each other that they take only a half of the bed. Dean's head is resting on Cas' chest, who would've thought that the angel can be so comfy pillow? He can also feel Cas' hands wrapped around him, touching his back, and a sweet scent of his body, Cas always smells like strawberries.
“I’d love to!” says Cas in enthusiasm. Of course, everything is so easy here.
“Oh, I know now. Could I borrow your Walkman?”
“Where’s Jack?” asks Cas, looking around like he hopes to see a baby, but nobody more is here.
“I'm sorry, Dean.” he started, putting the last plate on the dryer.
And then Dean kissed him. Slowly and gently with a little fear of rejection. But nothing bad happened. The kiss was short, subtle and innocent.
“Hello, Dean!”
“I found a case,” he says, clearing his throat.
“No, you didn't... I mean…”
Because he was a monster.
“I dunno. Life isn’t a romantic comedy, but with Cas… I think it could be something better.”
“No. You,” he says quickly, and when he realizes what he said, he makes red at once: “I mean, not you either… I…”
“About what?”
“What?” asks confused Cas, but before he says something more, Dean stands, knocking over the chair. He doesn’t even bother to lift it.
Dean grins, and Cas chuckles, but he's serious again a second later.
“Oh, okay. You mean… like a…”
“Okay, fuck this!” whispers Dean, standing and licking his lips a little.
“I... Yeah, a few times. But I won't tell you names!”
“Castiel,” he says, not looking at him this time, reading one of Bobby's books.
That is the point of this conversation. Probably Sammy called her after he drove away. Fantastic! And what should he say to her? That he has no idea if any ‘okay’ is still possible for him?
New chapter! Cas meets Jack for the first time <3
“No!” shouts Dean a little too loud. “I mean, only if you want.”
But at least, it makes atmosphere even more romantic.
“Run!” shouts Dean and grabs Cas' hand.
And yes, maybe it was going to be hard. He needed to learn how to be a good father, he knew he won't be like Cas, but maybe he could just try to be the best version of himself? Maybe he could love the kid like his own? And maybe, for the first time in their lives, everything will be fine?
Dean can't believe in his happiness, and he thinks he has to thank Sam for this. Maybe he'll even buy for him some veggie bacon?
“Dammit, Cas!” shouts Dean and puts his cup on the worktop that he spills his coffee. He walks away, and Cas is even more confused.
Dean’s heart was pounding like a jackhammer. He didn’t know, how angel reacts for this. Cas was still standing there with close eyes.
There is a silence, when they're just drink. Sam is waiting for Dean to open up. He doesn't push him too much. After a few minutes, Dean speaks: “It's not easy, Sammy. You know, I just push it away, and it's working somehow. I'm also into women, so I pretend only a little.”
He didn’t think about it like this, but Sam is right. And that gives him a hope, that maybe… just maybe, it’s not unrequited.
Singer and Kripke have a boner.
Cas took some book from a bookshelf in his room. He opened it and showed Dean what was hidden inside. There were dried flowers from earlier bouquets. One flower for each one.
, he tells to himself and laughs at loud.
“No, Dean, no ‘whatever’. Kelly named him like this, so if you want to tell something about Jack, use his name.”
Dean isn’t the biggest fan of walking, but he can do this if it keeps them close longer. He has no idea how much time he has. And what is happening with his body in the real world, right now. Is Aphrodite like a djinn? Is she feeding on him? No, probably not because Charlie and Cas killed her. Now, he just needs to be focused and escapes from this romcom.
“I… How you escaped?”
The image of Castiel’s wings, or rather of only a shadow alike to the trace after a nuclear bomb explosion, is the final proof that the angel is dead. Dean saw how Lucifer killed him, but he refuses believing in it first. It is easier, pretending that everything is fine and Cas is still alive.
“Hello, Dean,” he whispers, but he doesn’t turn around, continuing his work.
“Yeah...” Dean feels how his cheeks turn pink. “And if you want...”
“Thank you, Dean. And I'm sorry.”
They’re spending the rest of the night next to each other, brushing their arms and finally falling asleep. And even when they’re holding hands in the morning, none of them mentions it.
“Oh…” Cas looks ashamed and makes one step back. “My apologies, Dean.”
“All right, all right, just calm down…”
“Do you like them?”
“Sam prepared everything, you should be comfortable here. Don't sleep on your back for a couple of days, all right?”
And Cas really screams with pleasure. He also moans, gasps and makes so many other noises. And Dean does the same. Oh, of course John is staying at the door, and he hears everything.
“I just wonder.”
It was written on my milestone celebration on
“Okay, so you can't fulfil that promise, am I right?” asks Dean.
He opens the door and walks into the room. Dean is sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall, he doesn’t look at him.
“I can't. It would destroy our friendship, and maybe it's selfish, but I don't have anyone more… I don't wanna lose my family,” he whispers.
“I look like a shit,” says Dean, more to himself than Cas. They were on a hunting trip, and after killing three vampires, he feels exhausted. He just dreams about comfy bed in the bunker, but it needs to wait, this night he’s going to sleep on the motel room.
“You were talking with Dean about me and my feelings? Why?” he asks curious and feels something strange in his guts, or maybe Jimmy's guts.
“I'm glad I have him.”
“Of course,” he said, but he didn't go to the kitchen, still staring at Cas, and a few seconds later, he shorted the distance between them and gives him a deep kiss.
Dean asks Cas to buy some beers in the grocery. He wants to talk with Sam, so when door are closed, he starts: “What the hell is it supposed to mean? Why Cas…”
“No, Dean. That’s not why. I could find myself attracted to any gender,” explains Cas, and Dean turns to him for the first time.
“Tell me how it's going.”
“I what? It's not true,” he denies. He lies of course, but it's the easier way.
Dean takes his cup of coffee to keep his hands busy and avoid more embarrassment. Cas is staring at him for a moment longer, but eventually, he just sits next to them. Dean sips his coffee, and Cas looks at Sam nervously like he tries to communicate with him without words. It has to work somehow because Cas turns his head to Dean again and clears his throat before he speaks.
Dean can't sleep, and it has nothing to do with a weeping baby. He just has nightmares. Every night since May 18th when he's closing his eyes, he sees Cas' dead body and his devastated wings. Sometimes, he sees also Mary or even Crowley. All of them are dead. Because of him, and because of Jack… Now, he doesn't have an angel who is watching over him at nights, calming him down if he needs it. Not anymore.
Cas smiled. "I'll always love you."
He forgot how to breath. He was lost in thought. Only snapping to reality when Sam clapped him on the back. "Ready?" He asked. He looked at him for a second, then nodded. Pushing open the door of the recruitment office, he exhaled. There were different offices for every branch. Including the national guard. "I'll be waiting out here." Sam sat down in a chair and picked up a magazine. Dean walked in to the Army office. The recruiter looked up from his computer and stood up. Dean stood in the doorway for a moment. "We talked on the phone yesterday. My name is Dean Winchester."
"Cas..."
"I feel like I always get dinner duty." Dean laughed, grabbing his duffle bag out of the back seat.
She started recording. Right after she did, Cas started playing again. He stopped after a few seconds and took the pencil out of his mouth and played again.
Or is it these dancing juice?
Dean slowly made his way through the crowed room. Yet another soul mate party. The last one of the year. Now he would have to wait til march. The clock was ticking. If he didn't find his soul mate soon, he might be alone forever. His friend Jo handed him a beer. "Still nothing?" She asked. Dean shook his head. He never told anyone about Cas. Including his partents.
"Thanks babe. I'm going back to sleep now."
Cas shrugged. “It's probably just an Alpha thing. He's probably just upset that he doesn't have a mate.”
"Your phone. There's a text from him. Who wakes up at five?"
They said goodbye to Ellen and headed down the hall, but in the opposite direction of the exit.
"Let's go, Castiel!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Don't forget wrecking your bike. That was fun."
"Usually four hours a day. And yes, I forced him to eat by the way."
"Oh, not much. Just wondered if I could get your opinion on something?"
"You go." Charlie said. Dean looked at her. She half smiled then nodded. The doctor was already walking down the hall. Dean followed. The doctor pushed a button and the door opened. Dean continued to follow him. "Has he ever done drugs before?" Dean looked at him. "Why is everyone asking me that?" They both stopped. Dean was almost as tall as this man standing at five foot ten. "Because the toxicology report showed heroin in his system. He was high when he wrecked." Dean's heart stopped. There it was. His suspicions were confirmed. They drugged him for their own sick purpose. Again. But Cas left. He got away. This told Dean that Cas has had enough. He wanted out, he wanted to be free from them. "You don't have to answer right now." The doctor's words snapped Dean from his thoughts. They continued walking. They rounded a corner and stopped in front of a door. There was a name on it.
“I told you. I can't. Not now.”
Dean sat back. "Huh. I know something that even Charlie doesn't know. This is a weird feeling."
"Okay. Wait. How will it take you five hours?"
He could hear people speaking in German. He understood every word. "here's one!"
"Not until you're done with detox at least."
"Oh no." Cas began. He kissed Dean gently. "We still have twelve years to make up for."
“I'll be back in a bit. Gotta check on Dean and bring you your thing.”
“Okay, we stick to the woods and back roads til we get into Kansas City. When we get there, Sam, you'll get the medical supplies, Bobby, Benny, and I will handle the rest.”
“I’m gonna go see if she’ll jump that downed tree over there. I think she could be a jumper.” Dean looked out at the yard. Cas shrugged. “Go for it, dude.” Dean smiled and nodded at his friend as he heeled Whiskey into a canter toward the tree. Cas watched him.
He swung his leg over and leveled the bike out and handed Dean the spare helmet. Dean strapped the helmet on and took his place on the seat behind Cas. Cas turned the key, bringing the engine to life. He revved it a couple of times, turning to Dean and kissing the air at him.
Then it was time to open presents. John and Mary got Dean a book of famous artists. Sam got him a necklace that is said to be very special. Cas' other present was "History of Art" He loved all of his gifts. Sam and Dean worked together to make a collage of them through the years for John and Mary. Sam got Jess a cute sweater. Jess got Sam a watch. Dean handed Cas his present. When Cas opened it, his eyes widened. "Oh my God!" He took it out of the box. It was a framed drawing. A collage drawing of them as kids. "That took me a long time to draw. I wanted go give it to you if I ever saw you again. I started it when I was seventeen. I finished it the other day." Cas looked at him. Everyone gathered to see it. "It's beautiful Dean." Mary smiled.
He received more drawing supplies, a small sketch book and a coloring book with designs to test and challenge an artists skill. "You can never have too much art supplies." He smiled.
And here I thought I'd get something done for The Silence Of A Whisper...hehe oops! Anyway...
Cas rolled his eyes and continued putting the saddle and bridle away.
"Will you be my sidekick?"
Cas didn’t hear his father pull up to the house. He didn’t even see him. But Zachariah saw Castiel. He fumed as he realized what was happening. Not to his son. Not to his family. They had a reputation to keep, and this would bring it tumbling down.
"That I forgot about you?" His eyes flicked up to Cas. "I could never forget about you." He looked back at the paper and picked it up. Opening it, he examined the contents. It was a drawing. Not just any drawing, his drawing. "You kept it." He said quietly. The drawing was of two superheros with the same blue mark on their hands and said: "Secret superhero best friends forever" Dean looked up at Cas who was smiling.
She shook her head and made a face. "No. That's his job,” she said, nodding at Dean. “I wouldn't want to put him out of work.”
"Look at me." Dean whispered harshly at Cas. He wanted nothing more than to just let himself loose on Cas, but he was going to savor it as long as he could. Cas opened his eyes again and looked at Dean, smiling when he saw that his partner was just as wrecked as he was. Dean kept his eyes on the blue ones in front of him. He reached down and took his own hard cock in his hand and swiped the fluid that had leaked from the tip, lubing himself with it and then Cas' entrance. Dean then guided himself toward Cas, stopping just when he hit the skin. He bit his lip, then pushed in slowly. Cas' eyes fluttered shut and his head dropped back to the pillow. Dean took his time pushing himself in Cas. Cas bit his lip to stifle a moan.
Cas smiled, meaning he read about PTSD.
"You really don't want an answer to that question pal. My boyfriend was riding the Appaloosa you rammed into." Crowley grinned. "Huh. Makes sense now. Thought he seemed a little... Light on his feet. In any case, I don't know what you're talking about. Little Demon has perfect manners. Must have been someone else." Crowley and Dean stared at each other for a moment. Dean twitched with the need to knock Crowley to the floor, but he clenched his fist at his side.
Dean smiled. "Well, he has but sounds like he's been holding out on me. Guess I'll have to have him make something big one of these times."
"Guess they got out. Better help round 'em up. Especially River. Crazy ass horse." He got up, taking his beer with him.
"Yeah... they're downright adorable." Dean squared up to break the rack he had set up. Castiel leaned against the pool table. "This is awkward isn't it?"
Finally, around sunup, they reached a large field a few miles wide and long.
“Charlie told me.” He sighed, leaning against the door.
There were roses and candles on every table. The lights were dim. Slow jazz music was playing softly through the speakers. This was probably the most romantic  (and expensive) place in town.
"Red, I gotta go. I might have to bend my husband over."
"Whenever he's ready then."
It wasn't until after lunch they got a call for a vehicle accident. So they suited up and headed out.
After the took a shower and put on some clean clothes, Dean took Cas' hand and they walked slowly down to the lake. It was a nice, warm day. They sat on the dock with their feet in the water in silence. Just taking in the scenery. Dean broke the silence. "Cas, what I did yesterday, while stupid, I had a point to make." Cas looked at him. "What point?"
“Just hurry up. Don't wander too far.” Meg said.
"He called me a fag."
“Sorry, sorry…” She pulled back and looked her son over, meeting his eyes and smiling. “I’ve just really missed my boy.” Cas and his mother turned toward the car as the horn sounded abruptly.
"I lost track. But whenever I felt I was about to lose it, I'd leave the house. Told Dean to stay put with Sam. He never understood why. I never told him." Dean lifted his arms and wrapped them around Cas. He took the earplugs out. "Cas..." He looked at him.
They walked quickly and quietly, looking for a vacant room. It didn't take long. They picked one at a quiet end of the hall, ducking in a closing the door. Cas backed Dean up to the door as it shut behind them, making fast work of the buttons as his tongue invaded Dean's mouth.
"What did you study?"
"Yes Dean. It is. And I was sleeping because I have to be at the label first thing."
She sighed. "Fine. I swear." He grabbed her copy of the Lord of the rings trilogy, the one with all three books in one. It had become something of a bible for them. "Swear it on Tolkien." He held the thick book out. She put her right hand on top. "I swear on the precious."
"Now he's gonna go run his mouth to my dad." He ran his fingers through his hair.
Naomi looked like she might faint. Zachariah pointed a finger at Dean, getting in his face.
"I love you too, Dean."
"For being you. And for being here."
"Why on earth do you think that would make me behave? If anything I'll just cause more trouble if that's the punishment. Your taxi's here." Cas kissed Dean. "Until later today, master."
“Who in the hell…?” Charlie walked to the front door and opened it she was surprised to see Cas, who was supposed to be touring right then. He smiled at her.
“So, how was your night?” Charlie smiled brightly at Dean. Dean rolled his eyes and continued eating. Cas said nothing.
"Enchiladas and spanish rice." He called from the kitchen. He smiled. It was a running joke that Dean could cook better than Mary. Then Sam walked in. "Is Dean cooking?" Dean laughed to himself. "I don't cook better than mom!"
By the end of the second week, they took off the restraints (But he was on watch every second of the day) and allowed visitors again. Sam would come in every day after school and tell him everything that has been happening. He told Dean that their dad couldn't stand to see him like this and couldn't bring himself to visit. Dean was surprised that Sam even visited. After all, he did find Dean half dead on the bathroom floor. He couldn't bring himself to look at Sam, and still refused to talk. Sam told him Wyatt was arrested and his trial was to be determined. This held no comfort whatsoever.
But if you're young, it's new, I guess
"How do you know?"
Once they were finally able to stand, they washed off and got out of the shower. Dean tossed Cas a towel and both of them went to get dressed. Cas put on a faded pair of jeans and a black button up which he left open to show off his snug white tank top. He grabbed his aviators off the dresser and walked downstairs. As soon as Charlie saw him, she whistled. "Where were you hiding that outfit?" Cas just flipped her off and moved into the kitchen. Charlie smiled.
Okay guys...I started writing this chapter at around 3pm yesterday (8/14/15) and worked almost non-stop to finish it. (finishing around 9:50am 8/15/15) This is the longest chapter so far (with almost 5,000 words) Why did I do this? Because I love y'all. In a platonic way of course. So thank you guys! I hope you enjoy! Don't forget to comment!!
“As much as I hate to admit it, I think you're right.”
Cas thought for a second, then smiled that smile Dean knew so well that meant Cas had mischief on the brain.
Don't worry, I'm not done yet! STAY TUNED FOR MORE!!! DON'T FORGET TO COMMENT!!!
Cas pulled back. “Relax, babe. You’re okay. Just relax.” Dean put his head back again and closed his eyes, centering himself. He felt the finger again but let Cas do what he had set out to do. Before long, Cas had worked three fingers in and Dean was actually enjoying it. Suddenly, the fingers were gone and Cas’ mouth was off his cock. Dean felt something cold and wet where Cas’ finger’s had been. And then something large and solid, followed by a burn and stretch. Dean tensed up and moved his hips up. Cas pulled out and kissed Dean’s stomach. “Dean. Chill. It’s okay.” Dean nodded and relaxed. Cas went back to working his way into Dean.
Cas wants to avoid this subject. It's not good to reveals all of his secrets. And especially that one, which is hidden deep in his heart.
Dean feels Cas' eyes on him, so he turns his head and asks: “What's up? Jody said something interesting?”
“Okay, we'll take care of it. Now, I'll give you some space. Go to the bathtub and call me when you'll be ready.”
In the park is a parade with a few stands with cotton candy, pop-corn, and the other snacks. Dean buys for them a pink cotton candy to share. Lucky them!
“Hannah? You mean that angel?”
Sam sits with the kid on the back seats. Jack is sleeping in the carrycot. They are coming back to the bunker, it's the only way now. Dean doesn't look at them, he can't because it would break him apart. So, he just drives, staring at the road and not thinking about his losses.
Cas frowned.
“No, I don't think so. I'm far from okay.”
Dean looks into these blue eyes finally. His throat is dry, but he croaks: “You mentioned that you don’t like stranger, and I thought… I’m so sorry, Cas. I didn’t…”
AU!Dean is happy as fuck, and he doesn't say Cas anything.
“You… You were?”
He comes back to the bunker, eats the second breakfast, feeds Jack and takes him outside. For the first time. Sam used the baby trolley a few times, but walks was always no longer than ten minutes, and he kept close to the bunker. Outside world isn’t the safeties place for a nephil, they don’t know who is looking for Lucifer’s baby, probably the angels and maybe even some demons.
“Mary, that’s not my fault. It just… This friggin angel…” he starts, and Dean knows he must interfere with discussion.
“How old is a baby?”
on tumblr!
“It's cold here...”
I used here a few quotes from episode 13x03 Patience! Enjoy!
“Sad?” Dean looks at him finally, not understanding why Cas thinks it’s a sad song.
“That was a little more scary than I thought,” he says. And Dean just chuckles because somehow it's adorable.
Dean is standing over Cas’ body for a long minute before he uncovers a sheet to look at him one more time. The view is even more painful than earlier. Now when all emotions calm down a little, Dean realizes that it's over indeed. Everything, what he's going to do now, doesn't matter anymore.
“What does it look like I'm doin'?”
They're teasing with each other for the rest of the time on the car trace. Later, they play a few games, and Dean even wins a teddy bear for Cas.
Dean came back to the car, he had no idea what he was going to do with flowers, he just threw them on the back seat and drove to home.
“Dammit, Dean! You scared me,” shouts Cas and takes a cloth nervously to clean all mess.
“Can you do this again?” he asked, and he didn't need to tell this twice. The next kiss was even more passionate. Dean's lips found his immediately. They were kissing for a long time, and after they pulled away, they were still close to each other.
Dean huffs, and Cas can bet he also rolls his eyes.
He must stop doing this! What the hell happened? Why doesn't Cas have such an effect on Sam?
“About what?” says Dean.
“A monster. Where is a monster?” he asks again, more nervously this time.
“What's up, daddy?” asks Dean, teasingly.
“Stop, Sammy, just stop,” he begs, closing his eyes for the moment. When he looks at Sam again, his brother speaks.
“Okay, so kill him. Look at this baby and shoot it in its head,” says Sam slowly, seeing a hesitation in his brother’s behavior. He thinks it can be the best opportunity for them.
“I told you we should take the stairs,” complained Cas and sighed like it was at least the end of the world. They just stuck in a stupid elevator, no big deal, somebody was going to help them soon.
Cas understands what Dean has in his mind, when he feels his hand on his cheek. Fingertips touch his skin gently and a thumb rubs a little circle in the dimple in the corner of his mouth. Dean comes closer and finally presses his lips to Cas’. It’s a soft and subtle kiss, more like only brushing their lips. After first shock, Cas starts moving in the same rhythm, but before he can do something more, the kiss is over. They pull back and for a few seconds they are just staring into each other’s eyes. Dean takes his hand away, and turns head around. Then he stands up and clears his throat, not looking at Cas, he’s too embarrassed to catch his gaze.
A bunker which is so empty right now. That's when Dean realizes a home is a person, not a place.
The picture lands on the fridge’s door the same day, and in the evening Dean catches Cas there, who’s staring at it.
Dean is caressing Cas' cheeks. He doesn't like when his angel looks so sad.
You can also find me on
They’re staring at each other for a while, until Dean clears his throat once again.
“Dean!”
“I'm making this easier...”
, is he blushing? He's a grown man, not some teenager!
It was Dean’s idea, to get to that very small and very old elevator in that even older building. Why? Because ‘
“Yeah?”
Dean isn't happy like that often because almost all the time they need to fight with some Big Bad Wolf. Only sometimes, for example on the days when they’re watching some old western, Dean is relaxed and cheerful.
Dean scratches the back of his neck, trying to pretend that is just casual talk. Cas doesn’t seem to bother this at all.
“He's sleeping,” says Dean.
If Cas really said that? If Cas really thought that?!
“Yeah, okay, about that... We didn't kill him, actually.”
, the sound of music pisses him off even more. That song is the one of the songs which he put on
“So stay.”
“Risk what, Cas?” he repeated, a little to loud. Jack shifted in Cas arms.
Dean exhales with relief, but it still doesn't answer to his question.
“Since forever? Since I pulled you out from Hell, touching your soul... But I didn't know that then, I think, I realized this when I was a human.”
“Yes. He wanted to touch Sun, and he lost his wings. He fell.”
Dean didn't say anything, just shrugged his arms. He was cool with this, just dudes being dudes.
They're kissing again, but Cas doesn't pull away at once. First, he wants to mark Dean's neck as his territory, so he sucks his skin aggressively.
“No. It’s my private things.”
Nothing happens. None answer from Heaven. Everything is still quiet, and still dead…
“That’s not true.” It’s a simple phrase, not even a real compliment, but for Dean, it’s too much to handle. He feels something weird in his chest, a warmth, but also a guilt because he doesn’t deserve to hear these kind of things. He’s staring at Cas a second longer, the smile disappears. Dean turns his head and takes another crisp to keep his hands busy. Cas’ words are buzzing in his head for a long time after that.
The next time when they go together into the bar after a case, Cas notices there are lots of men, and he sees that some of them are kissing. He doesn't need to ask, he already knows they are in a gay bar.
“Actually, I have some gift for you. But you need to close your eyes and not open these, before I’ll let you,” he said, gulping and taking two steps toward him.
It was written on my milestone celebration on
“Cas, you should close your eyes if you want to fall asleep,” he tells him, and Cas shakes his head. He was tired, and he still is, but now he couldn't just fall asleep.
