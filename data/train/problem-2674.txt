Dean starts by curling his tongue around the head, making Cas whine and grip the cold metal arms of the chair. The demon pulls back, putting three fingers in his mouth and suckling as he stares at the angel. Once all fingers are coated, Dean goes right back to his work on Castiel, taking in the whole head. He brings his hand to his ass and enters the tip of his finger, hissing once the finger goes in fully.
“Yes, Dean,” he can feel the angel’s eyes burn through him. “I don’t want to see you again, I don’t want to speak to you again, I don’t want to hear your voice or even your stupid car ever again.” he pauses to let out an angry huff. “I hate you, Dean.” And that’s what does it.
Cas feels his heart break. “What..? Dean, no-“ he feels tears prick his eyes as he brings his forehead to Dean’s. “Dean, I’m never going to stop loving you. Ever. No matter what happens, I’m still going to always love you. That’s never going to change, okay?” Dean looks to their pillows. “If your hair turns grey and falls out, I won’t mind. Even if it means I won’t be able to play with it, I can wait until you make it to heaven. I don’t mind. I’ll still hold you, I’ll still take care of you, I’ll still kiss you and your lips and your hands and I’ll still, above all, love you.” He brings their lips together. “Walking cane and all. Okay?”
“Of course. Now, we need to get back there,” he pulls away from Dean. “I don’t want to have to deal with your brother and father at each other’s necks as well,”
He takes the time to focus on his breathing, and takes Dean’s words into consideration. Of course he’s still going to still love him, he will always love Dean. He wasn’t lying there. But what will he do? Eventually he’ll have to take care of Dean where he’s at a point of not being able to get out of bed. He’ll have to help him with his back pains, help him through coping with health problems, his hair falling out and losing it’s beautiful golden shine, when his skin becomes sensitive and near paper thin, more prone to bruises and cuts.
This is the last chance he gets to see him before he is locked away forever, at the bottom of the ocean with eternal unimaginable urges to spill blood. It’s a shame the last he sees of him is when he’s covered in blood after brutally murdering dozens of people.
“Shh, it’s okay Dean. You’re beautiful, every inch of you. More than anything,” Dean blushes a deep red at his words. The angel leans down and peppers kisses down his tanned chest, freckles littered. “Are you ready?” A warm hand lays on his thigh comfortingly.
“No, I already have what I’m getting for him,” Castiel feels his chest grow warm at the thought of his gift for Dean, hidden in a drawer in his old room. “but thank you, Sam. Though- some pie would be nice.” he finishes with a smile before walking out.
“Can you maybe try…” the human bites his lip. “On me..?” Cas’s head tilts as his mouth moves to pronounce a ‘W’. “I know, it’s weird, but with.. Michael in here.. I have his wings, right? I just think it’d be cool if I could see them and touch them, you know in person,”
The angel pulls out of Dean so he can lie on his back. The human’s eyes go wide at the sight of Cas towering over him, looking down at him, Dean in his submission. The face of surprise and pleasure he makes when he pushes back in is enough to make Cas go crazy.
On to the search… because I had a very specific fence in mind and didn’t have time to create one from scratch.  Well, the God’s smiled on me… and I found the perfect one!
Cas and Dean make caramel apples and carve pumpkins in this chapter.  What better way to introduce you to a bit
I'll try to come back and do a walk-through on this in the next week or so, but right now, I've got to do some writing
show you that... but the piece that I did use, had a lot of imperfections.  The entire area that I used to display the
I created the light beams by painting in several layers of gray in solid and diffused strokes.  Once that was completed, I adjusted the opacity level for the entire lot! I was really tickled  with the way the light beams came out… not having them just leaves the image quite flat.
This was the first time I've done a phone text image.  I've done other cell phone images but not a text one.
I snipped and clipped and distorted and bulged... and got pretty close to just what I wanted. Then I needed some more
You'll also see that I included two remote control.  They're not mentioned in the story, but who has a completely
Pie was a key for this chapter since Cas brings a home baked one to his dinner with Dean.  Plus I think when you first see the header, you might be thinking… what’s up with the pie?  So, pie… and a plate, of course!
Cassie and I talked about several larger scene supporting images for this story.  Of the three I wanted to do, I was able to do two of them.  Maybe I’ll come back and add the other sometime in the near future… but, we’ll see. I’ve got tons more art to do going forward!
I was lucky to find this one, although, I wanted something where 'Chuck' is in outerwear.  That wasn't working
To complete the image, it was run through two filters and resized overall to create the finished piece.
To keep the image cohesive with in this fic, I reused the chair that I have Cas sitting in on the cover and used the same balcony that appears in the thatched-roof bar.  Then, placing Sam into deep shadows was exactly what was needed for him to surprise Dean and Cas!
I fixed the horse... and now it's more in the proper scale!  Overall, I think this image evokes the right feeling for this scene in this story.  I hope you like it!
First… get rid of the background.  That took a little doing, because the light values were very low contrast.  But, I got it done and moved on to graphically repairing the box.  It took 15 layers of tiny pieces of wood and hand coloring to repair the box and get it looking as crisp as it should.
Then it was a simple matter of extending the counter/table the bowl is on and extending the spoon... and ... done!
I was lucky, too, that they allowed me to be further involved when I offered my expertise in Mob information and took on the job of beta'ing the story!
My task in supporting this part of the story was to find the screenshots that best fit the story.  I did a bit of playing with the light and enhancing some of the shadows with those but not to the extent of building in what wasn’t there.  Some judicious cropping and arranging, sometimes enhancing the lighting made all the difference!
You'll see from the images that I've created that there was a lot of discussion between me and Cassie before any artwork was started and put in place.  I hadn't planned on doing graphics for this story but when Cassie asked me, after working with her on her DCBB, I was more than happy to step in and work with her again.
Now, for chapter 2, Time was the important factor.  A pocket watch just seemed so perfect!  I could see Cas using one and it seemed like the perfect timepiece for Crowley as well! When I broached the idea to Cassie, she really liked it and went back into her text and made some judicious changes to some sections where Castiel consults a timepiece.  She gave him a pocket watch instead of the usual wrist watch!
When I first signed on, as is my habit, I asked Dani and Cassie if there was anything specific that they'd like to see depicted.  Both of them chimed in that there was a scene that takes place on the dock of the Krushnic family
Doing these types of Manips, good ones... take time, patience and perseverance. Creating them can be quite tedious, but... BUT... when it comes together it's a wonderful thing!
My first pass at this header was really simple and didn’t speak as well to the chapter as I really wanted.  Each chapter header, basically, foreshadows something that’s going to happen in the story.  On my second pass at this header I thought it would be really cool to use some of the items that you take to a Rocky Horror Live show.  I giggled at the thought.  So… I collected some images and showed my idea to Cassie. A fellow fan of the corseted transvestite – she loved it!
I couldn’t find quite the right pie at first, but finally hit on this one.  Then I went looking for a plate and fork, but ended up taking a plate, putting a fork on it and adding some crumbs!  Next I overlayed the images and added in some shadow, then the text … and done!
I didn't do very much to this.  I separated Baby from it's background and added a motion blur.  Then added the type and positioned it to
I wanted to create something for this small moment and I really wanted to use Jensen's and Misha's hands.  Finding the right images was a bear!
There’s a lot going on in this chapter!  Plus, we learn a bit more about Dean’s brother and his surrogate father in this chapter, too.
Cassondra had the wonderful photo of a club that was the inspiration for the one she describes in her story.  I tried to match
suffice it to say, it took quite a bit of time!  It was my first attempt at this type of intimate manip.
For this story Cassie and I kicked around many ideas for the separator/divider.  One of our first thoughts was a different one for each chapter, but that would be, in my opinion, a detractor.  We finally decided that it should be a single image, but then the quandary was what that image should be!
I used the same corridor that was used back in Chapter 9 since Cas's school didn't change.  And it gives us another insight into where Cas spends the majority of his day!
nice decorations... like a candelabra, and some table garland... you get the picture!  And if you don't, I made you one!
their rooms had.  We needed a different bed cover.  The one in the original room had a very sedate tan cover.
The final two steps included resizing my ‘movie’ and adding in the light beams that you could always see over the entire expanse of the drive in.
Here are some small versions of the original photos/images that were the basis of the final image above.
When creating these chapter headers I like to latch onto a key component of the chapter and produce artwork that reflects it. Cassie and I had decided not to use the cover on every chapter and so, the headers for subsequent chapters were a little more complex, some became very complex, but more on that later!  All the headers are done as PNG images which for the uninitiated are images on a transparent background.
And now it was time to split the image so that the line of text would be highlighted and the image would fit as seamlessly as possible into the story!  But first, I needed a shadow of Cas over the note and some background… so, first the shadow went in.
Then it was just a simple matter of adding in the chips and remote... and the image from New York's Times Square!
Once he was done and added into my new bar image which I extended further by mirroring it so that my image could be the size that
Putting in a new floor was not as easy as I'd hoped it would be.  Finding the right floor was another story.  I went through several.  Created three.  Tossed them all and went looking again.  I finally found the stone one that I used.  Getting it laid down took 22 layers in varying shades.  Plus, I wanted to it to look like it was in 2 layers so that Cas would appear to be a step down.
The sink area... adding in a ‘used’ towel onto the counter top as well as the toothbrushes that were added to the toiletry bag and left sticking out as if to dry.  The razor on the soap dish, the shaver next to the towel on the counter and the shaving cream tube peeks out from behind the toiletry bag. (Image 2 of the collage above).
Finally, since she's a nurse in this story, I thought it would be interesting to set her in her professional areana.
in the story, just floating there in a sea of white space.  Cassondra agreed and decided to set it on a table that would look like something you'd find
I feel strongly that a separator/divider should NOT detract from the actual story, but should be a small supporting element TO the story.
I added in the banners that Cassie and I found along with the class signs.  Then I did a bit of shadowing for the
I had culled a pic of children playing in the snow and it had similar trees to the background I was already using.
a photo of one of the vic's hands.  I thought this was a perfect spot to show the ID for the club in the fic.  Cassondra agreed!
The other gifts were from stock images that I just placed appropriately, added in shadows and reflections and it was a wrap!
For more discussion on these images, check them out in Chapter 3 which is a full walk-through of one of the images included in The Hotel Collage and there's more in Chapter 4.
I've had the photos from Jensen's photo shoot from the China Harper's Bazaar for a while now.  And while I love all of them, the image I used here is a particular fave.  And I thought it was perfect for this cover.  After isolating him several times I decided to keep some of the original background from the shoot, and take away the bits that I didn't want as well as building up some areas to fill out the image I wanted.
WHOOT!  OMG!  Mine!  WOW!  I was super excited and super nervous that I could do a 100K fic justice.  I don't do art the way I think of art.  I don't paint or draw.  I manip.  And there are limitations to that.  I do what I can to work around those, but...fingers crossed.
For the cover -- I wanted our two guys on there and I wanted a certain mood to it.  I think I got it.  And I wanted the image to make you want to read this fantastic fic.  I hope it works! More info on how this cover was created in Chapter 11!
And the last step was an overall Gaussian Blur and then feathering the final compiled graphic and overlaying it on a solid but also feathered background.
This image took a lot of layering and building.  I needed several elements to create it.  Of course, I started with Sam and isolating him from the backgound of the original.  Next, I needed a chair and a balcony and a night beach background.
This image is an Maniped Image based on a photo of a room of an historic motel on Route 66.  Cassondra and
Next… dress off the bottom of the trees and add more bushes in the back, note red circles, so that they blend into the landscape.  Then, add in highlights to the branches.  This is when I had to make a decision on which direction I wanted the moonlight to fall. This would affect both trees and the later images of Dean and Cas.  And it would affect my shadowing.
So, first I collected all the items I'd need that some of my party tables have had, but I also wanted
This was always the closing image Cassondra had in mind.  It's from a screen cap she gave to me, so I'm unsure of
Slotted that in and blended out the foreground trees with the far background ones.  This was all about perspective as well.  The trick was bending the foreground backdrop pic so that it was going in the direction I needed it to go.
was missing part of his lower half.  But it was perfect for the story… I was undeterred!  I rebuilt the part of the
The final image for this chapter was just too good to pass up!  Cassie had sent me the image of the two men spooning and we both loved it.  I reused the same window and night sky that I used in the image of Sam in the shadows.  Before layering in the new background, I also ran the original image through three different filters to achieve the nigh time look that I needed.
For some of these I changed the hue of the color.  For example there's a few ornaments in here that were quite large that I made very small.  They were red and white, but I wanted gold and wine.
Cassie and I thought it would be cool to display more of the kid's artwork!  Every elementary school proudly display's their student's handiwork and Lawrence Elementary wouldn't be any different!
I needed as well as providing the depth of field needed.  Once that was complete, I could bring back the hookah, add in some dragons (the same
I went looking for a retro type of cinema, that make me think of a smaller town theater.  I had one in mind from an art theater where I’d seen Rocky Horror more than a few times.  In a Google search, I found this…
This was tedious, but fun too…. Just to see if I could get it the way I wanted it even if you don’t see all the details in the finished graphic.  I know they’re there!
We wanted to show a scene of Dean and Cas just talking... so hard to find. *Sigh*  Especially one with the right feeling.
This closing scene with Cas and Dean is a really important one to the story.  After talking with Cassie about it
Melting the ice cream… I’m not going to show you all the layers that it took to do that.  Suffice it to say that it took 12 layer of cut and distorted images to create the ‘melted’ effect.
The image of sleeping Cas was created from these two images plus a bit of shading and color manipulation.
For the story, Cassie and I thought it would be neat to show the movie theater that they’re going to.
his hair color and he needed tattoos... lots of tattoos!  Plus, I needed to put him in an Incubus tee-shirt!
Because there's so much that happens at the cabin with our guys, I opted for a collage type approach.  Originally, the images would have been peppered throughout the chapter to follow the actions of our guys!  But, time constraints didn't allow it, and so, ultimately, I opted for a collage approach which is what's in the fic.  Here are the images as I would have liked to present them!  I hope you like!
So… I gathered a newspaper, a water gun, some rubber gloves, gotta have some TP, some toast… oh, and rice is a must.  Then I thought that a party hat would be good to have didn’t like the colors, so, I recolored the one I used.  But the one thing that Cassie and I really wanted was a noisemaker!  And we just could not find a good old fashioned noise maker that didn’t either have Halloween or New Years on it!  Grrr…
The scene divider for this was truly simple.  And it had to be something that would not be jarring to the reader, and still support the story.
Before running this image through several different filters, I needed to repair Dean's ear.  There's a green ooze that can be seen coming from Dean's right ear.  Once that was repaired, I isolated him from the background and isolated the gun so that it could be enhanced.
To create this Scene Separator/Divider, I followed the same steps as for the Drive-in Dinner.  This time, however, I kept the background of the lasagna image which was found with a Google search.  To create the size I needed, I added to the dishtowel that is to the right of the image thereby making the image longer and changing the perspective I could work with.  Then, I simply nested in the garlic bread and salad.  I added shadows to both and slightly altered the coloration of the salad for a deeper image.
Finding the right background to use that gave me that beach resort feel.  After going through tons of photos, I gathered about 12 and then wittled that down to three.  It was actually the third one that I tried that gave me the right feel and look that I wanted.
But for starters, first I needed to beat up Gabriel.  And break his leg. Then I needed his face to be swollen because he'd been beaten over days. It was quite a challenge, but I'm pleased with the result.
Cassondra wanted to include the Zeppelin tape that Dean makes for Castiel.  We see it's first appearance in
Enough about that… the first image is Dean and Cas leaving the hospital with a less than happy Dean!
To create the piece I took a couple of actual real time shots of a drive in and super-imposed them one over the other.
For this cover I wanted one of my own.  I created a background of blue and green in a nod to the color of Jensen's and Misha's eye color.
Now, I’m of the school of thought that hold with the tenant that to do that you don’t necessarily have to manip the images of Jensen Ackles and Misha Collins into the actual scene.
This is the first of two larger images for this chapter.  It’s a key scene where are guys are just enjoying their time together!
I found a stock photo and snagged it!  They were nearly perfect… just a tiny bit too light.  No prob… I could darken them just a bit!  But, first… there was background that had to come out and a couple other items needed to go as well.
Again, I didn't have the time to do a full walk-through on this piece.  I'll try to do one at a future date.
to me to find male bodies that came close to the musculature of Dean and Cas.  Once the 'bodies' were in place
Again, I layered age spots and crack lines over it, because the film is from 1978 and, hence, has definitely aged a bit.
In the second set of collages, the aisle carpet was completely changed and the silhouette added.  The rings were added to the box and then to the hands holding them.  Again, these were stock images that were then run through several filters after adding in shadows and shading on the hands and rings.  The final pic of the clasped hands required the least amount of playing.  This was a stock photo found in a search and the background, another stock image, was added in.
When I do one of these illustrations I like them to look as organic as I can possibly make them -- almost as if you were
for me.  But, I thought, if he just stepped out of his book store for a bit, he'd throw on a scarf... and so, he did!
When Cassie and I discussed the graphics for this story, one of the things she mentioned right away was having chapter headers.  She really liked what I’d done on the chapter headers for Poisk Istiny and wanted to have that on this story as well.
That was the easy part.  The more difficult was getting two sets of legs that I liked!  One set was already on a coffee table that I could use… oh, lucky me… the fates smiled.  However, the background of the original image was brick and that can be a real b*tch to cut away!
Now... before we got to the guys doing the horizontal samba on Cas's desk, we took a stroll through the school!
For the final image I added in a warm light off camera and from the left with a very gentle shadow of Dean over the blanket.
On the Mix Tape I sharpened up the label and added a small highlight.  Then I put the whole shebang on Baby's front seat!
I added the type in one of four fonts that were particularly gathered for this story.  This type was manipulated in a soft curve to mimic the roundness of the stack.
hospital drape.  The dragon stamp is one I created from a separate piece of vector art.  When it was complete, I didn't really like the way it looked
Chapter banners! The idea of them are near and dear to my heart!  And Cassie and Dani did such a great job naming each chapter and finding a quote to support their message
I'd love to be able to do walk-throughs on some of these compound images, but time is a wicked mistress... and work has to take the driver's seat!
Added in the type … And I was done!  Done, done, done!  I crossed my fingers and sent it over to Cassie and sent up a tiny prayer to all the Gods that she would like what I’d done.
I really did nothing to this image except slot in the name 'Lawrence Mall'.  It was shopping for the image that was the fun and grueling part!
The door was an absolute find!  It's metal, studded, gothic, perfect... except the first one Cassondra and I found were too small.
Now, when I found out who's story I chose, I was thrilled, but had to counsel Cassondra that I might not be able to do the same amount of graphics that I'd done for another DCBB several years ago... work has been busy for me!
The background is created from two different images and various tones of light and color manip completed it.
The FILE was created with images including the file folder, the police report, the clip.  I created the interior yellow page, and
On Dean's hand I had to bend his forefinger which I did with just two cuts and using the transforming tool to 'bend' the finger at the first and second knuckle.  Next, I had to bend his thumb a bit closer to Cas's hand.  Finally, I had to do a bit of cosmetic shading  to cover shadows on his thumb that could not be cut away without sacrificing the actual digit.
The date Dean and Cas go on to a Live version of the Rocky Horror Picture Show is a big deal for them.  It’s their first REAL date! Plus, Cassie and I are big fans of the show… so there is that.
These are cards, the Residence Cards, depict the homes of the main players of our story, including Dean, Sam and Bobby, Cas, Gabriel and others.
And Cassie got a kick at putting a ruler on the desk and they had to have a bit of lube too... so I included both!
I firmly believe that they should not interrupt the flow of the story.  IF used they should support the story in context.  If they are not going to be supportive then the scene separator/divider should be a gentle separation from scene to scene when needed.
I wrinkled my nose at that... and went to find reference pics so that I could paint in the missing parts of both men's arms.
This image is a tiny bit spoilerish, but Cassie and I thought it would work really nicely in this spot.  And it would give us the op to get an image of Sam in the fic!
I've been swamped with work, and really didn't have time to do a walk-through on this piece.  I'd like to
Finally, I found this great shot of Misha and Jensen together.  In black and white which wasn’t what I was planning to use, but… the pic was perfect, except for the fact that they were in the wrong positon.  And I needed to rebuild Jensen’s sleeve.  But, I got to work… split them.  Removed the background and filled in some areas on their faces that were not as desirable as I would like.  Fixed Jensen’s sleeve, which you end up not really seeing, but that doesn’t matter.  Overall it made the pics better!  I added in the back light that I wanted and ended up with this! Oh, and dropped Crowley in the far background.  I wanted it to look as though he was watching our two guys!
Titling is always super important to me.  For this cover I originally was going to use something that looked like a marker.  The type of marker that Castiel would use for drawing.  I downloaded several and tried the title in several different orientations.  Finally, I went back to the font, Goldeneye, that I used for the other parts of the cover.  However, this time I manipulated the spacing.
I thought I’d be smart and just go get lights off an existing house.  It was a good idea in theory, not so much in actuality.
I thought depicting these along with a set of chopsticks would be perfect for chapter 4’s header!  Finding the right
The changes I made including moving the chimney stack to the back of the roof and replacing the background.
Now, lest you think these can just be slapped onto the existing house, let me dissuade you from this thought!
To create the base image of the Drive-in Dinner I started by removing shadows and reflections that were in the original images since they did not correspond with what I needed.  Changes to the various elements sizing to scale, positions, and the perspectives on the fries and sandwich were needed to actually create the ‘Dinner’.  To finalize the base image, I put my three main elements into a nice tray box just like the ones I used to get at my local drive-in!  Then I added in appropriate shadowing for depth and perspective, and a special little touch… ketchup packets!  Can you have curly fries without?  I can’t!
I thought it was a perfect depiction of the rooms our guys spend their lives in... it just lacked that 'flair' that most of
This is one of the simplest images in the story.  It was the image that was inspired the description of the room in the fic.
This is my first Supernatural Reverse Bang!  When I made the piece I was just looking for something a little different for Dean and Cas.  I had this image of them in my head blowing bubbles… you know the kind that you do when you’re a kid?  It’s a big thing in the US… not sure about other parts of the world!  I can tell you that it’s great fun… I know whenever I see adults helping their kids blow bubbles it’s not long before they’re blowing more of them than their child!
"You can put your weapon down now Dean." I feel his arms move in a flourish before they hold me tightly. I peek out of his chest to see Sam and the witch talking animatedly to one another. I smile to myself, hiding it in Dean's shirt.
be overlaid onto the originals, and one original head had to be completely re-positioned.  To finish it off, I shaded in the color
After much discussion, Cassie and I decided to use the box that's buried at the crossroads to call forth the demon that could grant your wish.
On the Dean part of the image, I rebuilt Dean’s pant leg and shortened the cut.  And in Cassie’s story there’s no cast, but a wrap, so I needed to create an ‘Ace’-bandage type of wrapping.  It took 12 layers of ‘wrapping’ to create it and then two layers of that image.  Once that was applied I painted in some texturing and I think it came out fairly well.
Once I had the hands positioned correctly, I added in thumb shadows on where Cas is actually holding the note.
My views on art for fics is really quite simple.  As an author and a graphic artist, I believe strongly that any artwork used to illustrate a story should support it.  It’s a work of fiction that is including artwork, it is not a graphic display that has copy attached.
And this time around, since we had a little more time to do these particular images, I offered to reconfigure them.  These Residence and Location Cards are really tags that separate the various locations detailed in the story.  This time around I redesigned them to allow for the text that accompanies the image to be nested with the card in just text so that readers who do not recieve images would not lose that tag.  It's a bit hard to explain. You'll see what I mean with this posting.  I've put the 'card' images up with the accompanying text as they appear in the story.
So... on the hunt I went!  I found two great bed! One with fantastic pillows... and the other had a breat cotton comforter!
There was a huge problem with this fic to start with and now I had to address it.  What was the problem, you ask.
I finally found the right body.  Right size, right orientation, fit Misha's actual body fairly closely.  Maniping on the head shot was nearly seamless and I was quite happy with what I had.  One tiny problem... my body didn't have shoes.  So, I had to put some on him.  Not quite as easy as it sounds, but my Cas absolutely had to have shoes!
Here are thumbnails of the images that were used to create the briefcase image.  I also created another layer to the briefcase as described in the story.
Some of you may know my thoughts on art in fics from my other works or if you’ve visited my Live Journal page.  For those of you who don’t, you should know that I’m also a writer.  I’ve written professionally for business for more than 20 years and I’ve written fan fiction for almost 10 for another fandom and for two year for the Supernatural fandom, however, I write under a nom de plume.
collages by Cas's class and Gabe's had flaws that I just didn't like and so, I fixed them. Primarily I took out the
I was a bit stumped for a fun comic-book style separator for this section after Dean and Cas have some mind-blowing sex.  Cassie showed me a graphic that was a bit different from the others in the fic, but just perfect for this part.  I created my own.
Since I’m also editing (beta’ing) this story, when I hit on the note in Chapter 4, I thought it was the perfect little thing to highlight.  One of my reasons was that it gave a tiny bit more insight into Dean.
Now… I’d really love to do a full walk through on this piece but it would probably take me almost as much time as it did to create it.
The planted urn and side table to the right of Cas.  The planted urn was created from a single stone urn and two different tropical plants.  The table, I got lucky.  I found the one that would work, isolated it and dropped it in.
This has been resized for the purposes of this post.  But you’ll notice that some are not exactly round or that they’re cut off.  That’s because there was another object in the way of the actual wreath that required it be trimmed to fit into the existing image.
Castiel smirks and nods, diving down to leave deep red marks on his lover’s neck before bucking his hips.
Dean laughs heartily and looks to the floor, smile so wide he feels like his face is going to stay that way. Once he looks up he sees Cas staring back, smile warm and eyes bright. Dean’s heart beats hard, chest feeling warm, and suddenly he feels like the luckiest, and happiest man on the planet. The sound of his feet slam against the ground, muffled by his cheesy novelty socks.
“Oh..” Cas says, eyes dodging around in thought before getting snapped out, a bag of chocolate chips appearing before him. He looks up to see Jack wearing a gap-toothed smile.
“Was it some of the gifts? We can return them, I don’t mind. I kept the receipts in case you didn’t like them, and-“
Sam tries to hide a laugh. The amount of times they’ve failed that… “Uh, n-no, we haven’t. Except for, well, one…”
“Fine, have it your way,” Dean nearly scrambles his way to the angel desperately, praying he won’t leave him. Especially like this. His knees feel like fragile china as he crawls to him painfully. “What was that?”
“Dean, you made this again specifically to contain me, and I can feel myself losing control the more this goes on I.. I don’t want to hurt you.. not again..” He looks back to Dean. “Which reminds me...” He brings his hands to Dean’s face again, using his powers on him for the last time to heal him.
Castiel feels his heart break. He brings both of his hands to Dean’s cheeks, looking into his eyes deeply with intent and honesty. “Because it is
“Well, to be honest I think he had already hated me.” Cas says quietly against Dean’s jaw as he places another kiss. The human smiles as he rubs his chin against Cas’s, stubble scratching his face in a comforting way. He lets out a breath of relief.
“Sam’s out in town with your father, they’ve just left and will be out for some hours. The bunker is all ours,”
The hunter holds it with his fingers curiously, nervous from Cas’s last words. After a breath he opens the box, the creaking not helping his anticipation, before he lets out a sharp gasp.
Dean responds by tightening his legs, pushing Cas farther into him. He grabs onto Cas’s feathers and pulls, causing him to immediately release into Dean and moan his name. The human dwells in the feeling of warmth filling him as Cas rocks his hips slowly, nibbling and sucking on Dean’s neck hard enough to leave marks.
,” Dean gasps, the pain adding to the pleasure as Cas stretches him out completely. Once he bottoms out he grunts. “Okay go..”
Dean’s startled awake by the sound of his mother’s voice. The empty fireball and beer bottles clank together with the jolt, making his head pound from his hangover. Underneath the layer of bottles, a book of lore.
Castiel pulls away for a moment but keeps moving, speaking through gasps and fast breaths. “Please what..” he breaks out.
The memory rings like gunfire and burns like it’s paired wound throughout his mind. His ribs and stomach had bruised for a week and a half.
He stops for a minute to catch his breath, two sides of him fighting each other, one begging and crying to stop and the other screaming for more. He looks down at Dean, who has tears mixing with blood streaming down his swollen face. His pleading eyes meet Cas’s.
Dean feels himself get flipped around, Castiel holding him against the wall forcefully and holding his neck. His eyes glance over his blood dripping from the corners of Dean’s mouth and the lust dripping from Dean’s heavy gaze, stirring something in the angel.
The ex-angel shrugs softly. “Perhaps my vessel kept it’s muscle from all the fight’s I had. He’s not as heavy as you’d think, either.”
Jack finishes chopping strawberries, which he of course summons out of thin air — because when do the Winchesters ever have strawberries — and drops them into a small bowl. Cas then grabs syrup, whipped cream and chocolate sauce from the fridge and adds it all to the meal neatly (as well as a tiny little chocolate drizzled heart on the plate). He adds a cup of fresh black coffee and the plate to a tray and picks it up.
“Pay attention to the movie, Cas,” Dean whines with a slur in his words, looking up at the ex-angel with sly annoyance.
“I’m going to go bring this to Dean to eat, can you go grab a cake and some things he’d like? Gifts?”
..” the last word comes out as a moan. Before Cas could respond, Dean spills onto their stomachs with a loud moan, squeezing around the angel’s cock, which is enough to send Castiel over the edge.
“G-Goodbye, Cas..” he chokes back a sob as Sam helps him shove him into the water, sinking fast. The moment he can no longer see the edges of it is when he falls to his knees and breaks down sobbing.
“Oh- o-of course,” Cas turns away and tries focusing his grace on giving himself wings. It should be easier this time, now that he knows what to do for it.
The angel nuzzles their noses together. “I know, I love you too. I love you more than any other being could, I love you more than the moon loves the sun, the ocean craves land, life loves death, Adam loves Eve and more than God could even begin to love his own creation. I love you more than all the stars and the moons combined, Dean. I love you more than I can handle,” he ends with a quiet chuckle.
Dean grabs Cas’s neck and pulls him down for a sloppy kiss, bringing them to an angle that lands every hit at his prostate. He can’t even bring himself to kiss Cas with that much stimulation, all he can do is claw his back and wrap his leg’s around the angel harder.
Dean presses the angel blade against Castiel’s neck, not enough to kill him but enough to draw blood. The sight and smell of angel blood makes the demon in him roar.
“You’re so beautiful, Dean,” he breathes against Dean’s lips. “So beautiful, you’re so good for me..”
“I loved him, Sam. That’s why this is different. He was my fucking best friend, that’s why this is different. You know exactly how important he was to me and yet you’re still so fucking shocked at how much this ruined me. Every time I lose Cas you act like i’m fucking crazy for mourning,” Dean bites. “You’re still not over Jessica despite it having been fifteen fucking years since she’s died and you don’t see me telling you to suck it up and stop being a pussy and to just-“ Dean puts his fingers up in quotation marks. “‘-get over it.’ Good for you, you didn’t give a shit about him and don’t care that he’s gone. I dont fucking care. Get the fuck out of my room, Sam.”
After Sam and Dean defeated Chuck, they discovered that The Empty was full of loud, angry and awake angels and demons, which were stressing out the shadow. They, of course, made a deal with it saying they’d help get all the celestial beings to sleep as long as they could get Cas back, and they did. It took a few sleepless weeks of research but it was worth it.
Dean turns to the fridge, blood running to his cheeks and other places at Cas’s defensiveness of him. He grabs four beer’s from the fridge and hands two to Cas to hold. Cas walks up to John with confidence, handing him his beer. They both glare at each other.
Castiel works himself through the digits before pulling them out and lathering himself up. He’s about to ask if Dean’s ready until Dean answers by pushing himself impatiently, moaning in both pain and pleasure at the sting and full feeling of the angel being inside him. The angel has to catch himself on the seat so as to not fall onto Dean.
The sting of a punch rings throughout Dean’s head, brain feeling like it’s pounding. Somehow this punch feels more exciting than agonizing. Castiel grabs his chin, fresh blood staining his fingers red and smearing. The hunter lets out a sharp and pained gasp before looking into Cas’s eyes tirelessly, aflame with power and entertainment. He
” he moans onto Dean’s lips as he feels his lover slowly sink onto him, surrounding him with hot warmth that makes him feel so overwhelmed he could scream. And he thought the sex with April was good…
Castiel grits his teeth and punches him again. Blood is running out of Dean’s mouth and Cas can’t help the exciting adrenaline it gives him. Blood splatters across the floor with another punch.
John almost see’s through his mask. “Good, I don’t want any of you boys going soft on me,” he sits up from the chair. “Now, who’s going to grab me a beer?”
The warm fuzzy feeling of grace runs through him like water starting from the touch, making him feel comfortable and safe. After a few moments of nothing but the cool look of blue grace running up his hands and the nice feeling of it, Dean sighs.
The demon steps over Castiel and struggles to hold himself over the man. He leans forward and whispers into the angel’s ear, “Can’t wait to feel your cock buried deep inside me.”
Castiel doesn’t even notice that he’d spoken at first, for he’s busy looking over Dean and admiring his beauty at such a weak point. Once he registers that he’d spoken, he nods slowly.
Sam thinks. He turns to Eileen and kisses her cheek softly. He signs as he speaks, “Thanks for coming, Eileen,” Eileen smiles at him, nodding. “it means a lot to me, and I know Dean will appreciate it too.”
Castiel responds by tugging on one of the human’s feathers harshly, causing him to moan deeply. “Of course,” He pulls his fingers out and grabs the bottle of lube again, lathering up his dick before turning to Dean. “I have a request,”
As Kansas plays loudly throughout the place, Dean and Cas sit at the bar drinking whisky to catch up. Dean taps his fingers along the wood as they talk. “So how long have you been back? Like in your time.”
The hunter pulls off and licks his lips before wiping his mouth with his sleeve. Cas buckles his slacks back up again as Dean stands up, wobbly. Before the hunter knows what’s happening he’s back up against the wall, angel pressed up against him and mouthing at his neck as he rolls his hips once more. Dean whimpers.
A big part of Dean wants him to do it again, to touch his feathers. For him to run his fingers through them endlessly and overwhelm him with pleasure he’s never felt before.
Dean’s eyes roam the room, the floor especially. He feels the anxious white hot feeling in his stomach.
They’re stained with the blood and faded grace of others but don’t dare try and shed his, they’d never willingly hurt him or cause him pain. The feeling of his warm, calloused palms against his skin is always enough to make him shutter, close his eyes and embrace the touch with innocent and loving submission, always willing to accept him and whatever form of touch he wishes to bring with.
Dean bites his lip. “Uh.. it’s kinda hard to explain..” An invisible lightbulb lights above his head. “Hey do you have a radio?” Sam’s about to say something but Dean interrupts him and walks past him, mumbling “I’m sure dad has a radio somewhere..”
“Alright, rulers away,” Dean says after a cough. “We can’t leave Sammy alone for too long or he might make a bomb again,”
like a brother. He brings one of his hands to the angel’s, holding it softly as his rests on his face.
“Cas if you don’t stop right now I will pour this bowl of batter over your head,” he says playfully before bringing their lips together.
Sam intakes a sharp breath. “Cas isn’t very good with new people,” he says with a weak laugh. John gives him a blank reaction.
Cas looks to Dean and smiles. “I believe so, he rarely has nightmares anymore due to me sleeping with him now,”
His hands run smoothly along Dean’s biceps, finding their way to his neck and then his chest. They roam his torso, curl around his love handles and tickle his slightly-chubby stomach, making Dean giggle quietly, which in turn makes Cas smile. The angel keeps one hand on Dean’s hip and the other on his stomach.
The angel scoffs. “Many humans have the urge to kill, it can be in their nature at times. Your lust for violence and sex doesn’t make you inhuman, it‘s just an oversaturated part of being human.”
Cas sighs and looks to the Ma’lak box. He walks over to it, tracing the lining of it. Dean’s work. He squeezes his eyes shut and attempts to get in, causing Dean to grab his wrist.
Dean feels his heart skip a beat, heat rising to his cheeks and the uncontrollable curl of his lips. The look Castiel is giving him makes him feel oh so loved and he can barely contain it, something so abnormal and alien to him.
The angel falters for a moment, realizing what’s going on, what he’s doing, who he’s doing it too. He realizes that this is Dean, not a random person. He’s hurting Dean. The grip loosens, and Dean takes his chance to swing a punch.
“C-Cas-“ he makes a small sound of pain. “Cas please..” Dean tries prying his hand from his neck, tears filling his eyes, but he doesn’t have the strength. An angel with the power of the mark of cain? No human could beat that, no matter what weapon they have.
“Sam, I recommend you leave. I can do this on my own.” Cas states firmly, not taking his eyes off Dean.
“Okay, okay,” he says with a smile. “Fine, I do like it, but not around Sam, he gives us that big doofy smile of his that I hate.” he pulls away from his angel reluctantly and exits to the hall. “To the kitchen, angel,”
The human rests his head on Cas’s neck, swaying against him slightly before sighing and pulling away. “Can we please have a big cuddle session once we’re done with all this? All this.. dad coming back from the dead stuff is extremely exhausting..”
The walls grow longer, but closer. Dean suddenly feels like he’s being closed in, boxed up to be locked away forever. Lonesome and eternal punishment for not trying hard enough.
“Fucking get out, Sam! Now!” Dean orders, holding Cas in the strongest bearhug he can give. Sam finally leaves and shuts the door, hesitantly.
“Yeah well maybe it’s because you only sacrificed yourself for your own benifit, dad,” Dean barks out. Sam and Cas’s faces drop.
Dean chuckles softly. “Dude, no. I have lube in the glove compartment,” Cas blinks. “Here, I’ll-“ In an instant the bottle is in his hand. It’s Dean’s turn to blink. “Alright then.”
“Earlier, you-“ Dean grows harder from the sounds Cas is making, the whimpers into his ear as he rolls his hips, the little moans he lets out. “you said ple-“ He can’t even finish his sentence before he makes a low sound into Dean’s ear that nearly breaks him.
Castiel put his hands in his coat pockets with a brighter smile. “In case I ever somehow lose this one, I always end up doing that every so often. I’d like you to keep it until I inevitably lose this one.”
With each step he feels like the cold and lonely hall grows longer and longer, infinite and endless.
” The teen pleads, tears staining his cheeks, knees tucked into his chest in an attempt to protect himself.
The angel tilts his head with a small smile. He walks back up to Dean and joins their lips, sighing through his nose at the taste of chocolate and syrup on his tongue. After pulling away he rubs his thumb along Dean’s cheek bone, gazing into his jade eyes.
“I wanted to see what all the fun was about,” Dean shrugs. A blush reaches Cas’s cheeks. Realization hits Dean. “Wait…” He blushes harder. “Do you.. have a possession kink, Cas..” no response. “I’m not talking demon or angel possession, I mean marks, bruises, scratches, just any type go mark of possession,”
The angel huffs. “You and your brother.. you had so much on your shoulders, you know with Michael and everything, I didn’t want to make you guys more stressed. Plus, I didn’t think I’d ever get happy enough to be taken anyways.”
“I’m afraid you’re going to have to take this off. I’ve read about the physical manifestations of wings before in one of the books here, and I believe I have to touch your bare back to do so.”
“I dunno, he gives off that vibe. But you and your brother wouldn’t let a queer in here, would you?”
Suddenly his lips are on Dean’s, knee between the demon’s leg’s as he holds him against the wall. He can taste the coppery flavor of blood on his tongue and it only drives him more. He can feel Dean’s arms snake around his back, pulling him closer and deepening the kiss. The action also pushes the angel’s knee further between Dean’s legs, making him let out a sharp gasp that’s hot over Castiel’s lips.
“It- You-“ Dean rolls his eyes. “It’s peppermint bark. Trust me, it’s good,” he takes a seat next to Cas and takes a piece from the tray. “It’ll be a good snack for the movie, I made hot chocolate too,” he takes a bite of the bark. “Sammy and Jack made cookies as well.”
Sam races past him, not speaking to him knowing he’s in the certain mood, and opening the box. It was made by Dean, again. Made the same way but some additions to hold better. They know Cas is more unstable than Michael was.
die and grow old and sickly, while he remains young and pure forever, no health complications. He doesn’t say anything, he just holds Cas harder, suddenly interested in not taking his time with him for granted.
Soon enough they make it to the library, Dean talking about one of the times Sam made a bomb in science class and had to leave the school the whole way to try and brighten the mood. John was surprised to see Castiel smile and hear him laugh. The pit in his stomach grows.
Sam reluctantly leaves the room and closes the door behind him. Cas turns back once he hears a deep chuckle. Sat in the black leather chair is Dean, not the real Dean, but Dean. Possessed by The Mark of Cain, making him a demon. The angel walks over to the open book laid out on a table, skimming through the pages.
He tries warning Cas, but as soon as he speaks the angel grabs a handful of Dean’s feathers, immediately sending him over the edge and screaming Castiel’s name. White paints his and Cas’s chests as Dean squeezes down on the angel’s cock.
The action startles the tired boy. “Dean-“ he blurts. “What was that for?” He takes a look around the room and confusion paints his face. “What’s.. all this?”
The hunter takes a moment to catch his breath, not even caring about the wet lines racing down his cheeks right now. He just needs to calm down.
The human has to hold onto the headboard of their bed to keep steady as the angel rocks against him, tugging at the overly-sensitive wings on his back. He moans the angel’s name repeatedly.
“Oh my God you do,” Dean says in disbelief, an amused smile on his face. “That’s why you love marking me up, huh? Well, I hate to break it to ya Cas but I don’t expect anyone to be trying to flirt with me any time soon,”
After finishing the mixture, he pours some into a buttered pan and grabs a spatula. Jack comes up after the second pancake and asks if he can help out.
Dean tries saying his name, but nothing comes out, his voice is gone. He can’t speak. He’s too scared to. He chokes down a sob that resides in his throat once his eyes fall upon Sam’s lifeless body, which looks violently mauled.
Jack mentioned that he’s noticed plants dying around him, and that, since then, he’s had tiny bits of his power come back. I think he could be an energy syphon. Sort of like a...black hole? But on a smaller scale.
Sam begins to speak when the door to the basement opens and a pair of Death Eaters enter. They come towards me and I don't try to fight, though Sam is enraged. "Leave her alone!" He yells at them until one sends a spell to silence him. They bind my hands magically with  chains and tie me up beside Sam. He tries to kick at them, but his legs are tied down too. Soon mine are as well.
DEAN removes the blade from her neck and lowers CAS and himself to the ground, CAS laid across his lap, head supported by DEAN’S right hand.
"Dean! No!" Castiel takes away his magic and runs after Dean. He make it through the barrier, but just after he crosses the glyphs reform and the barrier is sealed. We are stuck out here.
Castiel sits cross-legged on the floor next to Dean, a little wary, watching him carefully. When Dean says his name, Castiel nods, and feels a pang as Dean stumbles backwards at the movement, stumbles back in
JACK uses his powers to zap electricity through himself to get THE EMPTY off of him. THE EMPTY jolts off of JACK but grabs his angel blade and stabs him. JACK falls backwards, motionless, and THE EMPTY retrieves the blade
CHUCK yells in rage, staggering to his feet again, and manages to get enough of a hold on his powers to throw MICHAEL and GABRIEL off and several feet backwards, MICHAEL landing in the OCEAN, and GABRIEL slamming into a PALM TREE.
"We don't know how to break the barrier 'Mione. We tried a combination of spells and powers but it doesn't seem to work," Harry admitted. I peek around the large boulder we stood behind. The wards confirmed what Harry said--they were very magic resistant and would repel basic non-magic.
Castiel calls. He dematerializes his angel blade and scans the room. Sam is still slumped against the wall with a gash on his head- unconscious, but not in immediate danger. Could the witch have transported Dean somewhere? He could be anywhere. There is some powder still on the ground. If Castiel gathers some he can study it and maybe tell-
The holy fire fizzles out, and Castiel surges toward the witch who notices Castiel too late- just as Castiel plunges his angel blade directly into his heart. Castiel barely notes the blood seeping onto his hand, his coat, and merely tosses the witch’s body aside in favor of looking over to Dean- who is gone.
I lean against the wall, trying to find the most comfort I can in the awkward position. Luna rips the bottom of her dress and places the scrap on her head, wiping away the blood to reveal a nasty gash across her pale forehead. She fastens it into a knot around her forehead. She sits down next to me.
But, let me take a moment and tell you about that!  I have, no exaggeration about a dozen shots of Misha and Jensen as themselves and in character that I played around with for this cover.  WOW… If they weren’t so good to look at, I think I might have lost my mind!
When I found the original photo upon which this image is based, I really liked it and thought it would fit the fic well.
If you’ve been reading this Graphics Masterpost or you’ve read any of my others then you know I have big rules on the scene separator/divider.
Each wreath and bow had to be put on separately!  Why, you ask?  Well, because the house is not a straight on shot.  It’s sitting at an angle which means part of it is going to look smaller.  For those of you who don’t understand art or the vanishing point, it’s about perspective.
Our two guys walking on the beach was another very simple image.  It was cropped from a larger image of two men walking on a beach.  I had to manipulate it very little.  I just needed to add to the background so that the image would be longer.
On the hunt, I went, for a new crossroad pic!  I found one… it wasn’t quite what I wanted, but it had potential!
Next step on Dean's hand was building out his sleeve.  That was a fairly simple matter of replicating the cuff and taking a base shirt sleeve and recoloring it to match what Dean had on.
This was a very difficult manipulation to accomplish.  I can't even tell you how many different layers are in here.  I can tell you that it took about 12 hours to accomplish!  I may do a walk through on this one.
Creating this piece was more fun than I thought it would be.  It was great fun to research and find drive-ins that were still open today.  There are only a little over 300 that still exist.
I really wanted to make a simple Cas sleeping image because when I read the story, I pictured Dean on the balcony talking to Sam about the op and watching Castiel sleeping peacefully.  I could not resist!  Hope you like it!
Unfortunately, I don’t have the time to do a walk-through on this piece.  I’ll try to come back and do one later.
To the left is the Original Phone Image and to the right is the table photo -- I had to extend the table to achieve the final image I wanted.
It was fairly simple, a black background, some dripping blood and some type that I layered in varying opacities and then off-set.  Finally, I ‘dirt’ spotted the entire image to give it a bit of age and I was done!
Deciding on the typefonts I use is as important to me as creating the images.  I consider typefonts as part and parcel of creating good graphics.  For this part I needed one that looked appropriate for a suspense romance. For the header and the credits I used one called Goldeneye.
JACK opens a rift and they rush through it. RUBY’S finger touches the rift after DEAN disappears & she’sucked through just before it closes.
"Goin' to be the hard way, eh? Alright then. Let's have some fun, mate." The wizard with the bad teeth grins again and they point a wand at each of us. Oh, I could use some Blibbering Humdingers right about now; daddy always said they were useful creatures in dire situations...
DEAN lunges and is able to grab the angel blade and get out of the goo, standing up just in time to come face to face with his doppelganger. We have a close up shot of them together, like a mirror reflection, noses inches apart.
DEAN is ecstatic until he notices RUBY and immediately pulls an angel blade and puts it to her throat, one arm still supporting CAS.
"No," I say, before I bend down and touch their foreheads, smiting them instantly. "I am an angel of the Lord."
"It's a spell, its casting the barrier. If we can alter the glyphs instead of trying to take down the barrier itself, we may be able to penetrate it. It will take all of us, though. They are powerfully made, with dark magic. You all ready?"
I hope you enjoyed this! Please let me know what you think, and thank you for sticking around for all these months!!
I stumble backwards and almost fall but Cas catches me by the arm. The two men hold up wands and step towards us. "Stop," Cas growls. He holds up his hand and I know he can blast them to smithereens with a snap.
The panning ends on JACK, who is the only one who hasn’t aged. He has a party crown on that says HAPPY NEW YEARS and is holding a cookie with a bite out of it, a smile on his face. The camera follows JACK across the room to where DEAN, SAM, CAS, and EILEEN are talking.
"You're a muggle; you can't see it, but it's covered in ancient runes. I told you it was a useful subject, Ronald," Hermione snaps at Ron, whose ears turn red.
We watch DEAN seeing his HANDPRINT SCAR in the mirror & immediately after we see DEAN against the DUNGEON wall with the BLOODY HANDPRINT on his arm.
Sam grabs a gun from under the map table and gets the demon knife from his boot, then walks towards the stairs to the door.
"Dean! Cas! There you are!" Sam comes running through the trees, holding Luna's hand. "Dean! You won't believe- the demon blood, it lets me do ma- Dean! You're arm!" Sam's face goes from radiant to horrified in a split second. A moment later and he's kneeling beside us, hand helplessly hovering over my shoulder. He looks back at Luna. "There's a spell, right? Something to fix it? Right?"
SAM and DEAN stumble back, shielding their eyes from the blinding light that grows brighter and brighter until…it suddenly stops, and we see CHUCK slumped on the ground, still bound, and AMARA lying next to him. JACK backs up, looking at something small glowing in his palm.
I watch as Sam and Luna vanish in a puff of smoke. I grab the unconscious hooded figures from off the ground and slouch them angrily across the nearest tree trunk. Cas calms the baby thestral crying for its missing mother. The remaining hooded figures must have taken them as well. Cas coaxes it out from the brush it was hiding in and begins to stroke it gently, murmuring quiet praises in its ear. I grab rope from the impala and remove the wooden wands from the Death Eaters before tying them up. Cas removes their masks with magic, the thestral trailing behind him on wobbly legs. I take a moment to appreciate the cuteness of the little horse nibbling on Cas's coat. One of the Death Eaters stirs awake on the far left and glances around.
“I can’t believe you’re making me wear these,” he mutters. “Like. In public, Cas. With people everywhere.”
Cas steps back, squeezing Dean’s wrists once in warning, and pulls Dean’s slacks and boxers off. Reaching out, Cas takes his tie and pulls him closer, kissing Dean within an inch of his life. Once the shirt is off, he gathers Daen’s wrists, the boy still distracted by Cas’s mouth. When Cas pulls back and Dean tries to follow him, Dean realizes his wrists are bound and he looks to Cas with betrayal in his eyes.
When he didn't answer, Cas had made his way up the stairs, fully ready to scold his bratty boy, but he wasn't in his room. He wasn't in Castiel's, either, but there was something sitting on the bed. And it’s Dean’s. His sweet boy’s collar, broken to pieces with a note attached to it. with shaking hands, Castiel tries to control his rage as he picks up the note.
Of course, Dean is still a person, and that’s not always how it is. They’re just a normal couple outside of all of the shit. Dean has a job. He goes to work, running his and Bobby’s business. Dean had put himself through college working as a mechanic, and finally graduated with his degree in automotive engineering.
“You want to make a deal, this is what I’m offering,” Cas said, his tone clear and firm, leveled with power he had mastered over the past five years of practically running New York City. “You’re a very attractive young man, Dean. Has anyone ever told you that?”
Out of nowhere, Cas shoves something inside of Dean’s mouth, and he chokes as the silicone pushes all the way into his throat.
yikes. so, i wrote a part 2. this might become an entire story, lol. comments, kudos, reads appreciated :) thank you for reading!
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Cas says. “You’re going to be the star of the party, pup. The main attraction.”
Panicking, Dean pulls away, trying to pry Castiel’s fingers off of his collar. He can’t do this. No matter how good this guy is, he can’t talk about that.
“You feel so good,” Castiel says, reaching around and stroking Dean’s cock, already drooling precome, slow and firm.
The longest Cas has ever left Dean in the cage was two weeks. Dean hadn't been eating consistently and kept 'forgetting' to do homework. Cas put an end to that as soon as he found out, and he thoroughly enjoyed frustrating him every day, making sure he was aching and needy so that he would ‘learn.’
“You’ll stay with me,” Cas says. “In my home, as my own personal… assistant. And as long as you’re good for me, and as long as you listen, I won’t touch a hair on your brother’s head.”
They were too gone on each other. Castiel met Dean, found this beautiful person in him, and he was lost.
“When you’re Michael’s, I bet he’ll keep you naked,” Alastair says, grinning. “Maybe with a nice plug in that little boycunt of yours, and a nice cage keeping your clit all soft and pretty. He’ll beat the brat right out of you, slut, I know he will."
Dean's eyes fly back to meet his own in the mirror again, and he pants around the gag, tears blurring his vision when he realizes that this was the punishment.
“You finished?” Cas says, coming to stand between his legs, wearing nothing but sweatpants, straight out of the shower. There’s still a gentle glisten of water on his shoulders, and Dean almost swallows his entire tongue.
“No more work,” Cas says, voice firm and unmoving. “You haven’t gotten up in twelve hours, Dean. You need to take a break.”
Alastair had wanted his hands on Dean since the second he saw him, and Alastair saw his opportunity.
"In a couple of hours," she says. "If you want, you can eat now. I know you probably want to go and study, but Dean, don't kill yourself studying. Go out every once in a while. Invite friends over. I haven't seen Charlie in weeks."
Moaning, Dean throws his head back, trying to push into the touch that’s so much better because it’s Sir.
Dean almost jumps at the sound of his teacher's voice way closer than her desk at the front of the classroom. Ms. Milton looks at him reproachfully, thinly veiled concern in her gaze.
“Well, yeah,” Dean says sheepishly. “But like I said, I’m fine, Cas. I go down enough to keep my head on straight every few months. I… Uh, the people who reported me were probably just worried cause I had a crazy week. High school sucks.”
“Then watch yourself,” Cas says, barely a whisper. “I want you to be good for me, okay? I know you can be such a good boy."
"When you're being punished, sub, you don't speak unless I give you permission," Castiel says. "I'll give you more of your rules and time to understand them once we get settled, but the number one rule you will be expected to comply with is respect, Dean. Both for me and for yourself."
“You’re so desperate, boy,” Cas says, right into Dean’s ear. “Desperate, needy little whore with such a desperate, needly little cock. Someone could walk in at any moment, and you’re still here. Hard and needy.”
After Dean hung up on Sam, he shared the location with trembling fingers and then searched desperately for a place to hide the phone.
“You don’t tell Daddy to stop,” Cas says, finally pulling away once it's gone completely down. Shaking with tears, Dean is so numb he barely registers that he’s putting the cage on until he can see it in the mirror. Dean shakes his head weakly, but it's pretty clear Cas is doing what he wants. Untying his legs, he pulls him up and out of the chair, bending him over the bed instead. Kicking them apart, Dean lays there on his stomach, hands still bound, head turned to the side.
“Wait,” he says quietly, Dean's chin in his hand, jacking himself off. Dean has to cut off a whine, wanting to do it himself, but he can't. Not until Cas lets him.
“Mm,” Cas says, voice frustratingly bored. If it weren’t for the bulge in his pants, Dean would think he’s completely unaffected. “I’m not sure yet."
The soft words, the easy acceptance calms Dean down enough to nod and let Castiel finish asking questions.
The sound that Dean makes is unrecognizable. It’s somewhere between a sob and a moan, between pain and pleasure, and he was wrong before.
“Today, sweet boy, we’re going to work on your attitude,” Cas says casually. “Alpha has some friends over later today, and it’s time for you to accept your place.”
Stepping into the room, Castiel locks the door behind him, gently pulling out the still vibrating plug Alastair left inside of Dean, who lets out a broken whine once it’s finally out. Castiel breathes a sigh of relief when he realizes there’s no come inside of Dean’s hole.
Cas kisses down his neck, sucking and biting and making Dean squirm. Dean tries to turn, to get more of those perfect, addictive kisses, but Cas growls out a warning.
“Pull yourself together,” Cas says again, voice low. Dean hangs on to every word. “And if you’re good, and you make it through the rest of tonight, I’ll take it off early.”
“Good boy,” Cas says, his voice barely above a whisper. Dean hears the click of a keyboard and Cas’s business voice for a few phone calls, and that included with the weight of his cock and the pull of the ropes lull him into a soft drift. Doesn’t have to worry about why he likes this, or why he needs Cas. Almost dozing, Dean finally relaxes knowing he’s being good for Cas. Is that all he’s ever going to be good for? And why doesn’t that bother him more? Dean doesn’t know how long he’s kneeling there, doing nothing but serving his master, but it’s been altogether too short a period of time when he feels Cas start to pull out.
Dean doesn't have enough time to process his words before Cas's belt comes down on his ass. Dean yelps, but Cas apparently isn't expecting him to answer because then there's another one.
Finally, Castiel levels a gaze towards the beautiful boy sitting in the chair across from him, and he knew he would do anything to have him.
Dean follows Castiel inside and up to the master bedroom, where he's informed Dean they'll both be sleeping. Dean tries to ignore how comforted he is at the fact that he won't need to be sleeping alone, and even more so that Castiel will be with him, because he finds the man's steady presence comforting, even if he'd never admit to it. Once they've dropped his things off, Castiel takes him to an office, sitting down in the chair behind the desk.
"What do you mean gone?" The shorter man frowned at me as he sheaths his blade. The unshaven man places a hand on his shoulder and the shorter man visibly relaxes from his tensed posture. The giant takes a curious step closer to the thestrals.
DEAN pushes the blade closer to RUBY’S neck, making her and JACK stumble into the devils trap on the floor.
CAS closes his eyes as unconsciousness takes over him. DEAN shakes CAS’S shoulder, brow furrowed in frustration and worry.
“Dean, it’s alright-” Castiel begins, raising a hand to attempt to comfort the hunter, but Dean shouts, still a tiny noise, and covers his ears as he sinks to the ground.
"Dublin, Toronto, Las Vegas," the wand whispered into my mind. I squeeze my eyes tight and send a surge of power into the wand and it begins to spark. Dark clouds begin to roll and a cold wind blows in. I can feel Dean press his warm, solid body to my back. The wand continues to sputter and I can feel myself forcing more raw magic into the trembling stick.
CASTIEL’S eyes full with guilt, something that even DEAN can see as he makes it halfway towards CASTIEL.
"Masked?" Sam asks. Instead of arguing, I push my whole arm into the void. I blindly wave my arm around, trying to find the object that holds the mask in place. My fingers grasp a cool metal and I wrap my hand around it. I bite my lip from crying out as it cuts into my palm. I pull with all my strength and fall backwards. The black darkness is sucked back into the knife and I shield my eyes from the sunlight that streams in through the tiny barred window. An otter squirms through the window and opens its mouth.
"Over here. Dead Deatheaters!" Harry comes over, wand raised. Inspecting the bodies we see that three have been shot.
The music starts to fade, and through all this we hear voices and laughter. We don’t see anyone else until a small child, around 3 or 4 years old, runs behind  DEAN and CAS, a YORKIE chasing her and barking. DEAN and CAS smile at the girl and dog, and the camera pans to SAM and EILEEN.
I'm thankful for the time I spent in the Malfoy Manor. Although the Cruciatus curse knocked the wind out of me, my body had suffered much worse in that basement. I'm also grateful that when they took my wand, they failed to check for other... magical items. I still have my wood and daisies headband in my hair. I strain against the magical chains, my fingers desperate to reach the center daisy. I bang the sides of my head against my restrained arms, hoping to wake the bowtruckle sleeping in the headband.
We see a CASSEROLE being placed on the TABLE- one hand has a WEDDING RING on. The camera pans up to show DEAN placing it there, temples a little grey, a few more laugh lines, a full beard, hair a little longer, and a smile on his face. Castiel comes up behind him, wearing glasses and an open flannel shirt over a t-shirt that says SAVE THE BEES. CAS wraps his arms around DEAN’s waist and kisses DEAN’s neck.
The camera pans across the MAIN ROOM to the LIBRARY TABLE with the initials DW, SW, and MW, along with the names CAS (next to DW) and JACK. It stays there for a moment before it shifts, showing more names being added.
The Death Eaters look at one another for a moment, then back at me, lips tight. "Alright." I raise my hand and tilt it in the air. The wizard on the right howls in pain; I am currently twisting his intestines.
DEAN (carrying CASTIEL bridal style) and JACK quickly move further from the crowd and we get shots of RUBY fighting her way tooth and nail towards them in slow motion.
SAM seems concerned at first, opens his mouth, then closes it. Then something hits him, and he scrambles to find another book, looks through it, finds a spot, and looks up at JACK.
They are around the area where we tracked a nest of vamps, so there must be some sort of connection. I tell this to Sam, and we agree to go and check it out. Running through the woods, I can hear the snuffling of horses around me, and see yellow eyes in the dark. We slow to a walk and I pull out my blade; the vamp nest is just ahead. I motion to Sam and he moves to the left. We creep toward the nest, but the smell of rotten meat hits us. As we get closer I see a pile of bodies, and there are half a dozen of those creepy ass horses chowing down on them. I recognize the two vamps we were trailing; this must be the whole nest.
"What are you doing?" Sam's voice cut across the room. I can feel his curious gaze sharpen as I bump into the corner of the room.
"You shouldn't be here," the tall man with shaggy hair spoke. The shorter man kept his blade out, the unshaven man hidden behind his muscular body.
