He had no clue what this place was, but snatched the vial of liquid without much thought or further protest, because he figured the sooner he could get out the better. And apparently drinking mystery liquids and eating suspicious cakes was the way to that.
Pushing aside his flaring flight reflexes, he followed the sound curiously. He placed his hand firmly on the base of a giant mushroom and peeked around the corner, letting out a small audible gasp at what he found.
With a growl he broke out into a run, as fast as the unknown terrain and black patent leather dress shoes would allow, and attempted to follow the rabbit. And it was attempt, because as soon as he rounded the turn—the same corner the rabbit turned to only a mere seconds ago—he was gone.
John did everything he could to suppress the incoming facepalm, seeing that if this conversation continued the way it was currently going, it would be ‘going’ absolutely nowhere. A little like himself at the moment.
“Eat me? Well not for nothing, and correct me if I’m wrong, but somehow I don’t really feel safe following the directions printed on a bloody cake. Especially a cake I got from a fucking chest that I’m certain wasn’t here before.”
John buried his face in his hands and dragged them down, letting his body slump in defeat. Though lucky for him the rock was just that, a rock.
He watched the breeze pass to distract himself, listening to it whisper sweet nothings to the surrounding nature, until it’s final breath. He hoped another would replace it’s absence soon; he hate for the plants to get lonely. He wasn’t sure when wind started to giggle though. Or why it sounded feminine and plenty.
“You didn’t ask me my name. I barely get any visitors anymore, and nobody spares a little old lady doorknob a second glance.”
“No,” He denied, “I’m a doctor. I’m supposed to be helping the mad, not...falling into madness myself.”
“Yoo-hoo, down here you darlin’ boy.” He looked down, startled to see the doorknob to the door nearest to him had a face.
John frowned, actually feeling a bit guilty at that, so he sighed and gave in. “Alright, well then, what’s your name?”
“No! Wait...please.” John begged, calling after him. The rabbit gave him a sympathetic smile, and hopped away hastily.
John swallowed, and quickly packed that thought away for never. He would steer clear of opening that can of worms, not that there was really any need. There wouldn’t be anything to find down that train of thought, he was certain. Just to be extra careful though, he pushed it even farther away; repression and suppression instead of depression he always says (he’s never said that). Definitely healthy (no it’s not). He would know he’s a doctor (that one’s true, but not the kind of doctor that helps psychologically—don’t go to him for help).
Birds somehow both common and prehistoric in species flew overhead, and critters that varied from bugs to shit he had never seen before scampered about, all larger than John himself. It was all a little breathtaking, in fact he could hardly believe his eyes, though he’d definitely appreciate it a lot more under different circumstances.
“No, just a doorknob. Though, you do flatter me. And so handsome too. If I wasn’t made of brass I’d be blushing.”
John turned himself around and looked up. Having his thoughts confirmed wasn’t nearly as satisfying as it should have been, since the thought actually being confirmed was how impossible getting the key would be. The only key, to the only working door, to his only way out, by the way. The blonde let out a groan.
John stared at the doorknob incredulously, baffled by the lack of further explanation. Shouldn’t that have been implied?
He shook his head, and snatched the brass key, noticing it had the same swirl designs as Mrs. Hudson’s door did, and crouched down, ready to insert the key in the keyhole.
“I’m...really talking to a doorknob. I’m farther off my rocker than I thought. This is...very worrying.”
With a deep breath John raised the offending key to the door’s keyhole, Mrs. Hudson mouth open wide. The corner of her eyes were crinkled in a smile, welcoming him to continue. So he put it in and twisted, sucking in a breath this time at the resulting click. Holding it, he slowly reached out and grasped the knob, or Mrs. Hudson’s nose oddly enough, and turned it.
Sherlock turned around to face him. “It does,” he said without an explanation. “Thanks for…” He looked down at his hand and nodded at it. “This.”

“Good, I’ll have it worked on. Now would you play the interrogation interview? It hasn’t been long since it took place, so I can say it hasn’t been tampered with.”
“Um, he just went into surgery. He will be done in about five to seven hours, maybe longer, depending on how things go.”
“You didn’t kill her,” he blurted out, louder than he intended. He bowed his head and fell silent. He’d do anything for a response; he would rather have Sherlock tell him that it was okay, that it wasn’t okay, that he would rather seen anybody but John—anything, just to hear his voice.
“The man in charge.” Kingston swallowed and straightened up in his chair. “I asked why, and all he said was to continue the story. I didn’t know what he was talking about, but he seemed a bit daft anyway, so I just followed directions.”
John heard him, but it took him a few seconds to understand. He continued to furrow his eyebrows, in which Sherlock took as a sign to continue to speak.
Sherlock furrowed his brows for a moment, and then he swiftly stood up and headed to the door. John started to feel nervous; he wasn’t sure what he wanted at the moment, but he wasn’t feeling very sexy, or even turned on, and was surprised Sherlock was even initiating anything at all.
“Thank you,” he murmured. Sherlock nodded once, and then started to get into his chair. He showered first, and then let John quickly wash up, before going downstairs for lunch.
Sherlock blinked and focused on John’s face more intently. John squirmed underneath his gaze, feeling his arousal increase again. He wasn’t sure just how long it would take to have a second round, but the feeling wasn’t unwarranted. Sherlock licked his lips, lowered himself over John’s body, and then slowly made his way down—not kissing but merely grazing his skin. He came to a pause by John’s leg, and then wrapped his hand around John’s stump. John felt a pang of nervousness, but he allowed Sherlock to life his leg up and placed it over his shoulder.
But then Sherlock spun on his heel and stormed down the hallway, and then slammed the door. John swayed by the silent outburst, and then hoped forward. His crutches were still upstairs though, so he hopped down the hall as carefully as he could, holding onto passing furniture and the wall to keep his balance and catch his breath.
John watched him go, and didn’t call after him, or even follow him. He physically couldn’t, even if he wanted to, which he didn’t really. There wasn’t a point. He stiffly entered their bedroom and sat on the bed.
“Yeah, I just started today. Couldn’t figure that out?” John teased, shuffling his feet yet keeping his eyes on Sherlock. He licked his lips and leaned closer, as if about to ask…
“Nah…I think I’ll have you right here.” John said, deepening his voice, resembling what Sherlock could only imagine was his captain commanding voice. The army doctor didn’t give the detective a chance to respond; he leaned all the way forward, pressing his chest against Sherlock’s as he captured his lips in an immediate passionate kiss.
John walked to the edge, placed the crutches one step lower, and then slowly lowered himself to the step. His arms shook a little, but he still had his balance. He exhaled slowly, and then took another step down, rearranging his sweaty grasp on the handles.
“Right, of course, how convenient.” John said sarcastically, because sure enough there suddenly it was, just like the chest, a vial of liquid conveniently appearing in time for him to shrink.
The brass lady hummed in thought, before shifting her face side to side, which he was sure would’ve been the equivalent to someone shaking their head for a doorknob. “No, you’re all set dear.”
Wait, smaller? John looked to his side as the thought breezed past, and noticed the table was indeed much smaller...but no, he was actually much bigger, wasn’t he? Hence the difference in the room’s proportions. After all,
He glanced at Mrs. Hudson before inhaling sharply, and reached out, slowly opening the lid the rest of the way.
“Are you...laughing? Why in the hell would you be laughing? What’s so funny?” If looks could kill, his glare would easily have murdered that rabbit and used its pelt as a nice coat for his fiancé.
He cursed when the nerves sent the response of pain in the area, and he removed his fingers, dropping them to his side. His suit suddenly felt too tight, and he gave the collar of the blue, black trimmed fabric of the suit jacket a tug, though it was a useless gesture.
“Chest? What chest? There wasn’t a...” he trailed off, as sure enough there it was: an ornate wooden chest right under the large table, that had to have appeared right behind him, because it wasn’t there before. He bit back and suppressed the urge to retort how useful that would’ve been earlier.
A soft breeze blew by as he sat there, rustling through the overgrown grass, and making the large plant life sway. It carried along the sigh that escaped his lips, and took it away, unfortunately leaving his disappointment behind. He was more angry at himself now, for bringing about this colossal mistake. After all, no one forced him to follow that damn white rabbit. (There it was).
He let out the breath, eyes wide in shock when at last the door opened, ignoring the strange fact that it wasn’t the whole door, but in fact a smaller portion of the bottom of the actual door. It didn’t matter anyways, because it was
Mrs. Hudson was silent, but staring at him pointedly. From the expression alone he knew it was either eat the the cake or kiss salvation goodbye.
“Oh don’t do that dearie, we’re all a little mad, after all. Don’t you think?” She chuckled, looking at the blonde man earnestly.
In fact, John wasn’t even sure why he did. When he looked back on it, he couldn’t recall what possessed him to ever do something so stupid. He just did it without a second thought. Sure, he was known for making crazy decisions that made people unhappy. For example, joining the army so that it could pay for his medical school. Mary had been less than enthused when he had told her he was doing it, no matter what anyone said otherwise. She was even less supportive when he claimed it was his calling, where he belonged. That it was a step he needed to take to progress in life. And it was. He loved it, the adrenaline, saving his comrades when all hope was lost, getting them home to their partners and friends and families. No one understood how worth it was, not Mary, not his mother, no one; they still didn’t. She just wanted him there with her, safe and normal.
“Oh it’s nothing, you just reminded me of someone then. Believe it or not, you’re not the first person to tell me that.” The rabbit had the audacity to smile at that, which John thought was more irritating than Mrs. Hudson’s roundabout answers and ‘more than lacking’ directions.
“Why are there so many goddamn rules?! All I want to do is go home. And to do that, I’ve got to go through this door, but every time I make progress it’s either this or that.”
John’s nostrils flared, and his jaw clenched, muscles rippling against his jawbone as he tried to keep his calm. With clenched fists, he took a deep breath and count backwards from ten. The brass woman seemed to be smiling, as if she didn’t have care at all against his rising anger.
Watson looked over at Mrs. Hudson and thanked her, before stepping through. But of course this place was absolutely backwards, allowing John no bit of relief, and when he went to turn back around towards his brass friend to express his surprise, the door slammed shut, causing him to jump, and then disappeared as if it was never there in the first place.
“You got to be fucking kidding me!” John yelled, threading his fingers through his blonde hair and pulling at it frustratedly.
He swallowed and looked around, afraid that if he pondered the question too hard he just might find out.
The rabbit then chuckled, snapping John’s attention away from his rant, and causing his pacing—he didn’t even realize he started—to stop.
“Of course not. Well, bottoms up.” John popped open the cork and tipped his head back, letting the cool blue liquid flow down his throat.
So yeah, sure what he’s currently got up there isn’t what he wanted exactly, but how could anyone ever be sure what it is they want from life? Certainly not to be trapped in an underground world with funky magic and things that shouldn’t be alive—or talking—that’s for sure. What was even the point of this anyways?
Talking doorknobs? Man-sized rabbit holes? Magical underground worlds with cakes and drinks that made people shrink and grow? It’s was like the plot of some wild children’s book. Not his reality.
Oh right. So what if making brash, hasty decisions is actually what John does best? Doesn’t mean he would rather be here! It’s not like he wants to get away from the woman he loves, they’re getting married. And he wants that...kind of. And he certainly can’t forget about his family...who consists of a deceased drunken bum of a father, an overbearing mother, and an estranged sister—not to mention the high class no face relatives (including Mary’s own family) that his mother has tried to emulate her entire life. Yeah leaving them behind would be...just awful. It’s definitely not that this world is somehow subconsciously manifested to give him an out.
John stared after him, eyes wide in shock at being denied what he wanted yet again. His jaw snapped shut as he continued to watch the rabbit’s retreating form, his eyes narrowing moments later, an idea popping into his mind. If he wasn’t going to get what he asked for, then he’d take it.
The glass tabletop came up to about his hip now, much like the rest of the room which had evened out in proportion, making its contents, previously impossible, possible to reach out and touch. He couldn’t say that he ever consumed a cake that made him to grow—whether it was normal or larger than normal size, he did not know—but he still couldn’t help but think fleetingly for a moment how convenient that would’ve been in his childhood. Not the point, however.
The slightest narrowing of his gaze and a flicker of trepidation passed over Sherlock's face, eyes skating between John's mottled-blue stare and the lips he was supposed to be kissing before he gave a small nod, pushing himself up (John found he rather liked being the taller one) and hovering a few centimetres from John's lips as he allowed his gaze to flit one more time to meet John's – the effect hadn't changed. The intensity was so thick that John was almost certain that the oxygen in the room was depleting, so ridiculous though it was that a single stare could cause such ramifications; it was almost painful in its own way, the knowledge that he couldn't simply stare into those pools of verdigris for the rest of the evening – but oh, no, it wasn't so terrible when instead Sherlock was pressing forward and brushing his lips carefully, intently against John's and was letting those eyes flutter closed so as to truly allow himself to lose his way and fall into the moment. It was actually the very
John groaned again and forced the images out of his head of the faceless Katie and her busy hands, his mind racing as he attempted to remember what the possible motivation of calling his sister could have been -
"Neither do I," Harry admitted, a first – Harry always knew what to say, even if it wasn't particularly appropriate. "John... bloody hell, John."
"That's hardly relevant," Sherlock snapped, whirling away from the useless cups of tea and striding over to the coat rack in the corner of the room, grabbing his long coat from its place and swinging it over his shoulder, slipping his arms in with one, seamless move. "Right, come on then, because either way we need to go to the bloody supermarket."
Sherlock's patience was clearly wearing thin. "Stop telling me I'm fine, John, I know very well what I am." The man took a deep breath, the half of his face that John could see momentarily becoming a mask of calmness. "Perhaps this isn't the time to be having this conversation. You're tired."
"Do you understand what I mean?" John's head was tilted to the side, his eyes narrowed in concern. "I mean, can you see what I'm trying to get at? Because if you really think this is about me saying I didn't want to kiss you then I... well. I don't really know what to say other than my acting must be far better than I thought it was."
"Nonsense, Gregory, I'm sure Sherlock considers you the very best of chums," Mycroft said, clearly amused at the idea. "Or at the very least he puts up with you and doesn't complain about it too often. I'd say that's friendship, or the closest approximation of it – well, as you say. Until John."
"John." Sherlock came out of the building he had been about to burst into, holding the door open for him and nodding briefly. "You're three minutes late. I've been waiting."
"He's the best friend I've ever had," he said honestly, shrugging as if it was of little consequence. "I'm lucky to know him."
Neil took one final step back, looking quite as much a chastised child as a 47-year-old alcohol could when faced with a son who was finally telling him exactly what he should have heard fifteen years ago. It would, perhaps, have been funny if it hadn't been for the damning reality of the situation.
John nodded, though he found it difficult to put the two scenarios side by side. "Probably. But this isn't exactly a normal situation, for so many reasons, probably more than my head is able to string together... and I don't want to bugger it up by doing the wrong thing. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before," he admitted with a hopeless raising of his palms to the air, "not with a girl
The rabbit thankfully didn’t move as he made his way out from behind the mushroom to him face to face, or whatever was equivalent to that when referring to a rabbit. At the closer distance, now with time to look instead of chase, he noticed the creature was wearing...clothes? A trench coat, a suede dark grey suit jacket, and a small checkered patterned collar shirt underneath, along with a striped tri-coloured tie, all fit to size, in fact. He was still wearing the spectacles John noticed earlier as well, though he found it odd that he was wearing all that at all.
He coughed and sputtered a bit, slamming the empty glass back on the tabletop. He grimaced, and waited, and soon enough the room began to get bigger. On the way down, he snatched the key in his decent, and slipped it into his jacket pocket. When shrunken, he walked over to the door and pulled out the key.
“That I did.” John agreed in absentminded thought, the reminder of his predicament all too vivid. “Speaking of, where did that pesky rabbit get off too? Did you see him?”
John whirled around, blonde brows furrowed, looking for the culprit who had spoken to him. But no one was there?
Now John Watson might of been a short man to begin with, but this was ridiculous. The table stretched far above his head, and yet, wasn’t even close to touching the vast, caved ceiling. He didn’t even need to try all the doors to know they wouldn’t work, and it would be just with his luck that the only way of attempting to open the doors was impossible.
“You called?” The other said suddenly, reaching up to adjust his glasses. “And please do make it quick, I’m already late, and I’ve got errands to run.”
“Pastries? You’ve got to be kidding me. How in the bloody hell is a chest full of cakes and cookies going to help me get the key?”
Sure enough, more giggles were heard within yonder thicket. He bolted up, and followed the noise, praying that this wasn’t another trap. Though anything, he thought to himself, was better than sitting on that rock alone, his only company his own self-doubt.
It was noon, when John’s phone rang. Sherlock hadn’t move one bit, but the second John hung up, he looked over his shoulder, slightly raising an eyebrow.
“Well, I like to think you’ll take care of me, no matter how endlessly exhausting,” John pointed out lightly.
John’s face transformed from utter loss to a canvas of sentiment Sherlock could not, for the first time, fathom into a word.
John laughed softly and shook his head. “I should, but I think I’ll pass out from starvation first before exhaustion. Lead the way.”
“Come one John don’t do this…” Sherlock huffed out as he continued with compressions. The doctor stood on the other side of the bed and tried to gently take hold of Sherlock’s arms.
John nodded once. “Please—.” His voice broke and he swallowed. “Earlier I…felt like I was losing myself. I knew you were there but I couldn’t see past it…”
Trying not the panic, Sherlock looked around for anything he could throw against the window. There was nothing, and the smoke was already stinging his throat and his eyes. He coughed roughly, and leaned forward against the wall. He stood up, leaned his weight against the window, and reached up for the lock. His hand throbbed, and attempted to shift his body to use his other hand, but lost contact with the wall, and fell onto his side, hitting his head against the chair, succumbing to darkness.
Before John could finish his question, footsteps entered the room, and the two looked in that direction.
John sighed tiredly. “That was Doctor Shepherd; he wants me to come back in and run a MRI scan. There’s indication of something on the CT but it’s not clear enough…so he wants me to go back in.”
Sherlock clenched his jaw and took the bucket and cloth from Regina. He set the bucket on the edge of the bed, and dipped the cloth into it. He squeezed the excess water out and then gently wiped John’s forehead, keeping the cloth pressed against his skin for a few seconds before going down to his neck.
John tapped the armrest of the chair. It was comfier than the plastic one he had sat in before. He was in the same room though, as he was every other day, sitting in front of Dr. Smith, not talking.
Sherlock remained silent and didn’t move. John didn’t either. Several moments passed before a sniffle interrupted it, followed but a suck of air and then another sniffle.
John haggardly stood up and faced the delusion. “Then you’re just the tumor. You’re not a ghost, Sherlock’s alive.”
to do this. We don’t have time to exchange plans and I can’t tell you what’s going to happen as a result because I don’t even know!”
“We figured you wouldn’t want that. We’re keeping an eye on your monitors, and suggest light physical activity. There may be seizures or hallucinations, or just nightmares, or even nothing.”
“Victor?” John’s voice was a hoarse whisper, and his heart only continued to beat rapidly as he watched Sherlock’s expression carefully become cautious.
John parted his mouth and let out a sigh. Everything hurt, especially his chest and shoulder. His throat was dry and he coughed as he tried to speak. He glanced around Sherlock, noticing he was still in the hospital. He swallowed dryly; Sherlock placed a cup by his mouth with a straw, and he gratefully took a sip. It helped a little.
John showered thoroughly and slowly, taking his time and making sure he didn’t fall. He didn’t want his next encounter with his lover to be because he had fallen again. He carefully dried himself off and dressed, and then entered the kitchen hesitantly.
Sherlock straightened up and looked at the first one. “The one on the left doesn’t have a scar on his shoulder. The vest would cover it, but the edges sprawl outwards to his shoulder and arm, and it would show. That man’s arm doesn’t have scar, clear as day.”
"You were going on an undercover mission to the arse-end of Europe and yet somehow you couldn't find it within your unimaginably intelligent head to tell me?" John is smiling, he is smiling but he is not happy. He is not enjoying this. It is not even slightly funny. "Because we had that moment, Sherlock. In front of that plane. You sent your brother away and you invited me into your little semi-circle of personal space and
Sherlock grimaced as he leaned back and stretched a long leg out to get a firm stance onto the next rock. "We didn't exactly spend much time climbing on rocks when we were children, Mycroft and I. We spent most of our time playing instruments or reading books. Or... well. I played on my own sometimes."
Their roles had been reversed. Sherlock had divulged. John had been in the room with his counsellor for less than ten minutes.
"My right hand man?" The words were practically a murmur, Sherlock's icy eyes glancing out to sea before returning to meet John's – Jonathan's – steady gaze. "Well. It's a truth that I've been needing a replacement for Redbeard the Hairy..."
Sherlock's eyebrow raised of its own accord as he pulled two glasses from the top shelf. "Wild? That's a bit of an exaggeration for just one glass of wine."
John waited for a moment to see if there was anything more to come but, after a few seconds of quiet and tapping, he moved the cursor over the little flashing microphone icon and clicked it, ending the voice call. Slowly and carefully he moved his now rather warm laptop onto the desk chair, standing and walking lightly over to the sink and mirror, plucking his toothbrush from beside his flannel and glancing up to meet his own gaze in the mirror.
The pressure of fingertips against the button of John's shirt was still surprising even though he was expecting it, his head laughing cruelly at him as it reminded him that it was Sherlock who was now beginning to deftly release them from their confines; it was impossible to forget this detail as the hands trailed down, little brushes of air against John's increasingly bared skin making him want to react with movement but his resolution to not allow this situation to become something awkward keeping him still. Traitorously his mind reminded him that he hadn't been undressed in months by any hand other than his own.
Instantly John was wrapped up in the memory of the night before – the realisation, the kiss, the second kiss, the moment Sherlock had lightly grasped his hips, the bed, the taste, the heat... the confession. A flush worked its way up to his cheeks, his hand become a soft mush of uselessness as he remembered everything in almost severe clarity; he put the knife down, placing both hands on the edge of the counter and taking in a few breaths. When he finally glanced up at his best friend, feeling the warmth from his cheeks spreading rapidly to his ears, he saw that Sherlock was watching his reaction with intent fascination.
too many eggs into the pan and throwing him a smile. "Do you want to get settled at the table, dear? Breakfast shouldn't be too long."
He had never felt so under-qualified to be sitting at a table in all his life. "Er, no. No, I'm not even slightly musical -"
"I was," Sherlock admitted with a roll of his eyes, "I was shifting and fidgeting and staring so intently at the screen that my eyes were blurred…" He trailed off, breaking eye-contact with John and looking out to the blaze of the setting sun, momentarily lost in a train of thought. "It's funny, looking back. A little shameful."
John blinked. "Yeah, but… that was for studying. That was all in the name of academia. You said so yourself, multiple times!"
"We're not in a relationship," John intercepted shortly, keeping his voice as calm as possible as the man advanced upon him. "We're just friends."
"Absolutely no need to apologise, I should have introduced myself: Dr. James Moriarty. But please," his smile widened slightly, fingers squeezing his before letting go, gesturing towards the chair opposite the desk, "call me Jim."
A quiet laugh came from his side. Lewis looked between the two of them for a moment. "Awright. Well, you two take care gettin' back to town, yeah? Bad time of year to be 'anging around 'ere."
The table watched as he wedged himself between the two girls sitting opposite Sherlock and John and leaned forward, sliding a card out from the fan around the pint glass. He pulled it out with a flourish, turning it slowly to face him.
"It's difficult, but you can get through anything with a good support network." John wasn't just trying to reassure the woman; he was directing his words very much towards the man on the opposite side of the table to him. "That's what family and friends are for."
"Doesn't answer my question..." John muttered, lifting the glass to his nose and giving it a sniff; good god, it was definitely at least a quarter full of alcohol. There was quarter of a pint of sambuca in this glass. Greg was trying to kill him. "Sherlock, I apologise in advance because I'm going to be absolutely hamm-" He turned, words trailing as he watched Sherlock drain his entire glass. "Sherlock, what the hell are you doing?!"
A little sigh came from behind him; the man who was now directly in front of him stared openly into his face. "Yeah. Yeah. Didn't fink you were gay, Shez. Sorry if I offended ya."
By the time they'd started on a second movie, Greg very gallantly offering to do the washing up (a groan emitting from the kitchen upon his actually going out there and seeing the mess they'd left behind), John was slumped low on the sofa with his favourite grey blanket over him, eyes sleepy but a small content smile on his lips as his eyes followed the movements on the television screen; Sherlock was staring at the screen too, but his eyes were clearly unfocused, not at all into the film. They sat together alone for about ten minutes before Sherlock spoke, interrupting John's concentration of the film.
Forcing himself to drag his lips away from Sherlock's and take a moment to control himself, John pulled into his lungs three staggered breaths which he ardently needed and took the smallest of steps back, gratified as he felt Sherlock's fingertips press harder into his hip to keep him from moving too far from his own breathless body.
It was clearly a hint. Sherlock reached into the inside-pocket of his coat and pulled out a brown envelope, extending it out. "As ever I hope that this token of my gratitude will cover any pains you went to get it, Lewis. You know I appreciate what you do for me."
Still, he had an entire night’s sleep to toss and turn to. Maybe his dreams would help him figure it out.
His startling talented memory began to work overtime, bringing back to him every memory of that night, every sound that had escaped John's lips and every brush of his own fingertips light on John's skin.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed slightly, the slight and subconscious change of his demeanour – stiffening, chin tilting upwards – indicating that he was attempting to make sense of this request. “I'm not sure you'd understand it even if I tried to explain, considering I'm still in the midst of coming to terms with all of this myself. And I'm still unsure of why you're pressing the matter with such... persistence.”
John found himself surprised at the question. "No. No! Of course it doesn't, it doesn't make a damned bit of difference to me."
"I don't expect you to understand when I don't even understand it myself. I suppose the easiest way to simplify it would be to say that even if something did change and we were suddenly labelling our relationship differently the actual thing itself wouldn't change. We'd still be like we are. Because I can't see how it could possibly become
John rolled his eyes, grabbing his laptop from the table and shoving it under his arm. "I'm just asking you to be bloody
"Don't worry," John said with a small laugh as he opened up his e-mails and set out to compose a new message, "you should hear some of the things I hear out of Greg's mouth."
He let the silence go on for a bit, letting William get this thoughts in order. "So. Are you okay with all this?"
John's tongue darted out to rid his lips of excess moisture, letting his head sink back down into the pillows beneath him. A cloud of Sherlock's scent washed up and over him – so they were Sherlock's pillows. Sherlock had gone upstairs and got him his own pillows. He pushed out sound from the recesses of his throat and winced slightly at the weak, gravelly tone which escaped from between his lips. "Been better."
"It's been out of your system for three hours now, you've just been too distracted to notice," his friend said, infinitely distracted himself. "Come on, a nice jaunty walk up to the park, break into the observatory, have a bit of a wander and then we can make our way back down! We can even get coffee on the way home if you'd like," he offered in apparent generosity, opening his hands wide to signify his genuine intent to provide hot drinks."I'll pay. I'll pay for your cab back too, if you come with me now."
Tim dropped himself gently into the conversation. "Well, he never put a name to you, just referred to you as 'exhibit A'." When John didn't laugh, he smiled apologetically. "Sorry, I'm not a man of humour, Wanda will tell you. He didn't give you a name, just mentioned a friend who was keeping an eye on him."
John had nodded, a small smile forming on his lips at the memory of their getting-to-know-you day. "Yeah, a little bit. He told me he used to pretend to be the captain of a pirate ship with his faithful first mate, Redheard the Hairy."
closed unless he's sleeping," he stressed, fingers splayed out as he made his point, "and I guess my instincts just kicked in. I opened the door and he was just sitting against the wall, all the stuff around him and he was just staring in front of him. At nothing." Greg turned away again, looking at Mycroft. "I swear, there were no warning signs this time. If there had been -"
He turned to continue walking, but John reached out with his uninjured hand and grabbed Sherlock's sleeve tightly within his fingers – it was highly reminiscent of the last time they had done something whilst fuelled with adrenaline and the irony of his lack of inhibitions coming hand in hand with the rush that only Sherlock seemed to be able to provide these days was not lost on him. "Don't say that."
"HARRY!" He was shouting; he didn't care. He heard the moment of almost offended silence before she finally responded.
"You make sure you look after 'im as well, awright?" Lewis was talking to John now, another grin creasing the corners of his eyes as he jerked his head towards Sherlock. "Always getting 'imself into trouble. He could do with a pal to look out for 'im."
John glanced up at him and saw the man staring at him – yep, there was the bewilderment. And concern. Definitely concern. He had to force himself to speak, to smooth the situation... but what situation was that? What the hell had just happened? "No, it's fine, we were just..." His eyes betrayed him, flickering to look at Sherlock; the genius was looking at neither of them, staring instead at the clock in the dining room. "...talking."
He continued to mutter like this for a few minutes, fingers starting to drum faster and faster on the desk as he considered what an utter arsehole this William Holmes was. He re-read the email, laughing without humour and shaking his head several times before he finally stood up and turned away from the laptop. Falling backwards onto the bed, John stared up at the ceiling and felt the last remaining dregs of frustration begin to ebb from his system, an almost physical sensation of it leaving his body tingling through his fingertips until he was once again left with the nothingness.
"Just stop questioning me, all right?" Quiet again, the edge subtle. "I can barely focus on keeping my body upright let alone have to deal with you constantly doubting and questioning me... my head
"Good. Wonderful." Sherlock shifted slightly underneath the covers, practically trying to bury himself beneath them. "Now go away."
"Oh." John's eyes cast themselves down to gaze at the instrument again, his eyes taking on that same burning interest as before. Sherlock rather enjoyed it. "Yes. Is it yours?"
! Are you listening to me? Are you even aware of how serious I am?" John takes the step this time, no hesitation required, instinctual as muscles shifted and his foot moved forward. "Stop it, stop this, stop thinking that you care more about me than I do for you -"
He was brought back to the moment by her pulling away, the big smile still pasted upon on her face; he knew her too well, her tics, saw things that others wouldn't see - he saw the signs, the slight tremor, the effort it took to give him such a welcome. He felt the familiar ball of iron start to form in the pit of his stomach, the pressure that came with keeping up with her own obscenely convincing show of normality. It felt so unnatural after months away, felt as if he were forcing himself into a skin that no longer belonged to him... and all within the first few minutes of his visit.
“Ah.” Sherlock nodded slowly, fingers steepling underneath his chin as he threw his gaze back to John who was seemingly even more distracted than he was. “Well, that’s really up to John.”
The man was gone in an instant, not stopping his purposeful stride to the kitchen; John shut his eyes momentarily, his head a mass of pain and bewilderment as he tried to make sense of everything. In the end it was easier to just focus on the pulsing ache in his hand and ignore the rest of it, allowing himself a moment to mentally prepare himself for the strength he would need to get up in order to take off his bloodstained shirt – christ, that really
"Oh, be away with you. Look at how the silver brings out your eyes. You'll devastate some hearts tonight, that's for certain!"
She blinked too quickly as she perched on the edge of the three-seater along the wall. "Well, you know. Nothing really changes around here! Harriet called yesterday for the first time in about a month, says that she's thinking of coming to visit. That will be... nice."
Greg was completely ignorant, grinning at John. "John, this is my housemate, Sherlock Holmes. Bit of a bastard but at least he went out and got us alcohol."
He took the forms meekly, nodding and turning without meeting her gaze even once. He clutched the clipboard in hands as he propelled himself forward towards the corridor she had pointed at, palms starting to sweat rather rapidly as he got closer and closer to room A2, the door with the little glass partition and the dark blue plaque announcing the room's title coming further and further into view until finally stood in front of it, heart pumping, dread weighing like a concrete boulder in his stomach as he stared at the plaque and waited for his body to unlock itself so that he could reach forward and knock.
They allowed themselves perhaps a few moments of silence as they both mulled their options over, John turning his head though not his body to face the sea again and squinting his eyes at the sun that was starting to set; it was beautiful, there was no denying it, the perfect setting for such an in-depth conversation. He found himself feeling only slightly uncomfortable, the very tiniest bit, and all of that he knew was rooted in his narrow-minded upbringing by parents who genuinely thought they were teaching him right. If he ignored those, if he ignored the memory of his sobbing sister and shouting mother, he had no qualms whatsoever about what they were considering. It was just... complicated. It would always be a little more complicated, if only because they were complicated people at that moment in time.
John kept his eyes studiously trained on Greg as he nodded, trying his best to appear nonchalant. "Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Back to normal, better than ever."
“Regardless.” Mycroft’s tone quickly became sharper, focused; Sherlock had no need to look at him to deduce that his brother had enjoyed quite enough chitchat and was impatient to get down to the crux of the matter. “Let’s not waste any more time on this old argument when you clearly have something on your mind which apparently only I can unravel. I must say that I’m surprised.”
Half of his current mouthful sprayed out of his lips onto the cards and people in front of him before he could even process what had happened; he heard a vocalisation escape from his throat, something of a protest and a swearword, almost 'fuck, Sherlock' but closer to just wordless noise. The people in front of John shrieked and shielded themselves, shock and amusement travelling around the circle in a sort of Mexican wave as everyone started putting down their drinks and wiping their mouths, relief and mirth echoed in their laughter – John slammed the glass down on the table, hand flying up to cover his mouth as he started to cough, eyes watering as the sambuca lodged itself into every crevice in this throat and burning.
"John got hurt on account of me. Injured his hand. As he stood there, pale and bleeding, I felt a surge of it, a rush, almost an ache – I cared. I cared that he was hurt. I wasn't just concerned, I was… horrified. The guilt was like I've never felt before, it tore at me and made me feel as if the pain he was feeling in his hand was resting now within myself." He laughed again at himself. "How whimsical. How ridiculous. But accurate. Very accurate." Sherlock trailed off, thinking for a moment. "He asked me to take him home, to my home, and I did. I took him home with the promise that I would take care of him. I had never been asked to do anything of the sort for anybody, yet a single request from him and I was completely unable to refuse."
John quickly typed in the code and felt a small measure of satisfaction as it successfully connected. "Cheers for that."
"Fucking hell," Greg muttered, walking out of sight. "You got the JD though, right? And the sambuca?"
Sherlock followed, letting the door swing closed behind him. "I was passing. I thought you might appreciate the distraction."
He didn't realise he hadn't responded until Sherlock took yet another step forward; his whole face was in lacklustre viewing now, revealing the half-smile and the odd glitter in his eyes that made John suddenly feel as if he were hunted and Sherlock the hunter, a mask of pure intent set against Sherlock's long, curved face. John decided that there was no time like the present to take the first step – so he did, a foot shuffling back on the hard floor beneath him and carrying him the smallest step back and away from the man who was suddenly disturbingly unfamiliar.
Things had deteriorated very quickly. Neil looked genuinely taken-aback. John couldn't feel his lips.
“Go to bed, Gregory,” Mycroft said wearily, stepping out into the hallway and waving his umbrella in the direction of the stairs, “you’re just paranoid from lack of sleep. I mean, really,” he muttered, seemingly speaking to his younger brother, “it’s like looking after a child. Or a dog.”
He threw his awkward drunken thoughts away from him as far as possible and concentrated as much as possible on the game instead, and god knew it was necessary – Sherlock had finally pulled a
Wanda chuckled quietly ahead of John. John glanced at the back of her head before allowing himself to look at Sherlock again, still grinning. "Call me a name, then we'll be even."
"Greg didn't mean anything by telling me, he wasn't trying to piss you off or upset you... he just wanted to clear things up for me."
The house looked no different to how it had just a few months ago. The white paint on the outside of the 1930's semi-detached home was still peeling, looking far better from across the road than up-close and personal; the window frame – supposedly painted to look mahogany – was chipped, though clearly Sharon Watson had attempted to cover this by lining the frame with a smattering of pansies of arraying colours. John supposed that, if you weren't already aware of the external flaws, they actually weren't so awful and were easily distracted from by the flowers. It was a speciality of his mother's, using distraction-tactics to avoid dealing with a bigger issue; it felt a little harsh to make such a conclusion but the fact was that for a very long time it had actually worked. John knew that his childhood had been a complicated one, what with his father being a full-time mechanic, a part-time alcoholic and generally a rare presence within their home, but Sharon had plundered on with filling her children's days with activities and distractions to the point of running herself to a state of exhaustion. By age ten he had seen his mother break down in private more than five times and already had a lingering sense that her ever-cheerful attitude with them was nothing more than a practised facade.
Slowly her arms found their way around him as she returned his hug tighter than he had prepared for, sniffing again. "Sometimes it's better not to say anything, I think."
"Really?" Brooke's eyebrows were raised, looking quite genuinely surprised. "How delightful. You've never heard anything quite like it."
Well, all right. He supposed it was now or never – quite literally. He knew himself too well. If he woke up the next day without having brought it up, they'd never talk about it and it would always be a source of oddness between them. Maybe it would just be better to clear the air. He took a deep breath.
Because of course he would go on his own. Of course Sherlock would not accompany him. Of course Sherlock was right.
. Ah. That made sense. Sherlock's voice, Sherlock's scent, Sherlock's hands. He suddenly wanted to open his eyes again. He tried. A flicker of movement to his left, a blurred figure. It was dark, though. That was a relief. His head was hurting. Was it possible for his hand to hurt at the same time as his head? He was sure that was impossible, you could only focus on one pain at a time – then again, maybe the figure who he remembered now was Sherlock was dealing with the pain in his hand for him. That didn't make sense. His hand still hurt. The pain wasn't going away. But his head hurt too.
“Oh.” One slow blink later and John was concerned he may have fallen asleep for a few moments. “No. No, you wanted to talk to me. I’m awake.” He shook himself a little, widening his eyes and forcing himself to meet Sherlock’s stare. “I’m fine, I’m awake.”
Just over an hour later he found his eyelids beginning to droop, eyes feeling a little itchy and the words on the page in front of him getting a little blurry; he shuffled all of the papers together and shoved them messily into the large blue ring-binder at the end of his bed, pushing the folder onto the floor and pretty much forcing himself to stand up and walk over to the sink. After brushing his teeth, stripping off his clothes and giving himself a quick wash, he pulled on a clean t-shirt and a clean pair of boxers, walking over to the bed, switching off the light and allowing his body to collapse onto the fresh sheets (one good thing about not being at Well Place was being able to get his washing done). He practically rolled under the duvet-cover, snuggling into his pillow and rubbing his cheek lightly against the soft, fresh-smelling material.
It wasn't intentional, the words, he had not meant to say them but they had slipped out like embers needing air and, in this case, Sherlock was the oxygen: his words were nothing more than potential and they could only be real and true and blazing if Sherlock was willing to breathe life into them and make them more than just
"Absolutely," she agreed, nodding even more enthusiastically than before. "They're exactly my feelings too, John. No parent should judge their child for their choice in love, if only because it's not really a choice at all. Is it?"
What was most odd was that, with the inclusion of William's notes, John actually found himself drawn into what he was reading. Instead of finding himself faced with the usual drone of facts and statistics, he had the added amusement of a running commentary along with some very clever and unexpected analysis that he never in a million years would have considered himself. Rather than lying on his bed and finding himself waking up with a sheet of paper stuck to his lips as he had done the last time he had attempted to read anything course-relevant, he was sitting up with a notebook at his side, bullet-points being jotted down every time he found himself intrigued by something new. Every now and then he would find himself making his own comments in response to William's notes, though whether he would include those on his typed-up notes he wasn't sure. William, despite the odd humour John was finding between the lines of the more sarcastic commentary, seemed the type of person to take learning very seriously and John assumed that he wouldn't find it altogether amusing to see the things that John was responding with.
Images of Sherlock holding his violin in the dining room flooded his mind. "No. No, he hasn't. I didn't even know he played until last week."
He realised with a start that she'd misunderstood him – that he hadn't even thought of it that way. He'd forgotten that he was talking about the possibility of falling in love with another man. He didn't think of Sherlock like that. When had he stopped being so hung up on the fact that a man was in love with him and instead was focused on the fact that his
Another sigh, deeper this time. "I assume telling you to walk away from the situation and starting life anew would be a waste of both of our time?"
make you uncomfortable." He leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowing infinitesimally. "We need to change that."
The passion in her voice was a little embarrassing, but he didn't want her to stop talking. "Did you dance, just like Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth?"
It wasn’t quite the ‘me too’ that John had been going for, but he hoped that Sherlock would know what he had meant… and if anyone could hazard a guess and be spot-on, it would be him. “Do you know how long you intend to stay there?”
Greg waved his arms. "Um, hello? I'm actually standing right he- wait, what do you mean 'above my station'? What's my station?"
that had breathed out a sigh that sounded so very much like the name of the man he did not know until that night that he needed so very much... needed, and adored, and perhaps even loved.
He watched through the archway of the door which opened up to the kitchen as his mother bustled around the cluttered space, opening cupboards and throwing teabags and sugar into two cups like a perfectly choreographed dance; the contrast to watching Wanda Holmes do the exact same thing was almost startling. Wanda would no doubt be flapping her hands as she tried to catch up to her own train of thought, trying to remember who she had already put sugar in for and who she'd forgotten, little murmurs of 'now then' and 'let's see' as she made her way around the kitchen as if it were a foreign space and hadn't been living there for over ten years; though Wanda was graceful in her own way, his own mother was so precise, so perfect in every movement that you'd think she was working on autopilot, trained professionally in the art of making a cup of tea. His eyes travelled over the form of her as she moved about, her perfectly-ironed jeans and crisp blouse simply highlighting the equally flawless make-up and hair – had it not been for the years of difficulty having been etched upon her once-youthful face he would have thought her to be ten years younger, at a distance easily fooling him into seeing the mother he had grown up with as a teenager.
him of anything," Wanda blustered, suddenly looking rather lost, "I most certainly wasn't saying it was a
A piece of information he had forgotten suddenly came trickling back into his head – Sherlock at Greg's party, wryly informing Greg that as he lived rent-free in their home that he would definitely have to pay him back every single penny for the alcohol he had just fetched. John slowly nodded to himself. "Right, so that's why." He turned to Greg. "You get to live here rent free and in exchange you keep an eye on Sherlock?"
"When you're the one he's having these feelings for? Don't think so. You know him better than that. He must be going fucking mad with all these thoughts shooting around his head, you know how much he thinks and how fast his mind works. It must be crazy in there right now."
"Can I come in, John?" His voice seemed no different, perhaps a little slower, softer; the man looked so unwell that John stepped aside instantly, gesturing for him to come in, eyes following his movements as concern rested heavily on his shoulders.
John put down his fork and dragged his palm over his face roughly. They were really having this completely unnecessary conversation. In a dimly lit restaurant. With a bloody candle in the middle of the table (because apparently even if John and Sherlock
John turned on the spot, not quite meeting the gaze of the receptionist as he shuffled his feet awkwardly. "Yes, er... yes, that'd be me. Sorry I'm late."
"Fine, FINE." Reluctantly and full of a muted weariness he forced himself to sit up, pulling the laptop off of the chair and leaning his back up against the headboard as he rested the thing in his lap and moved the cursor until his screen powered back into life. What he saw, of course, wasn't exactly what he had been expecting and was possibly even more unwelcome than nagging emails from his tutors.
Sherlock put his hand out, silencing him. “I’ll get the blankets and make us a cup of tea. Then you can ask your questions. All right?”
John's hands were beginning to shake; the vulnerability was back, revelations bringing about the same old reactions. "No."
Hesitating for a few moments, trying to force himself to remember how to communicate without simply repeating 'I know' and 'I'm sorry' over and over, he hit the reply button with perhaps a little more force than necessary and slowly started typing out a response to the unwelcome stranger.
He could barely type the four letters, hands shaking so hard he had to type them with a single finger.
"Then work with me. I'll smile, I'll talk, I'll act as if the last fifteen years never happened. You do the same." He could barely believe it was his own voice coming out into the room, strong and authoritarian; it was like hearing someone else entirely speak for him. "She's going to need the lie more than the truth right now, especially with Harry coming over tomorrow."
A door slamming, a bounding of light feet up the stairs; another pair, heavier, making their way to the living room as Greg –
"When we're old and grey and our sons have disappeared off to live their own lives, Timothy, photographs are all we'll have to remember then by. MYCROFT!"
Suddenly something struck John, a truth that he hadn't actually considered until that moment – his brow creased, his head turning to face Sherlock properly as his mind started to clunk slowly. "Hang on, that's a point..."
Sherlock wrinkled his nose, taking the mugs from John's hands and placing them on the counter, reaching over for the tea bags. "But it's Thursday. It's Thai night."
She was like a child. Another reversal, just like his dad all over again only, when it came to Sharon, it wasn't pathetic. Just sad. Just terribly, awfully sad. Still the smile, still the amazing capability she had to falsify her own emotions, but he could hear it. He could always hear it. Better than anyone else, he could hear when his mother was losing her resolve. He walked, tentatively, with care, around to her side of the table and reached out with a gentle hand – foreign, really, as physical affection wasn't exactly considered the normal way of things in their family. He could see, within the seconds it took to gently take her hand in his, her body tense at the mere anticipation of the action.
Instantly Mycroft's tone changed, an authority and edge to it which hadn't been there before. "I don't think that you will, John."
They didn't bother with the the salt or lime; they never did. They necked the Tequila, slamming the shot glasses down and bringing the last shot up to their lips, Sambuca – the only one that John could personally stomach without wanting to throw up – and throwing it down after the others. The three of them stood in a row, shuddering, grinning, the burning sensation leading a streak of heat down John's chest and making him feel a little better, a little more confident. When was the last time he'd had a drink? And why oh why hadn't he eaten anything of substance today?!
It was a harsh end, but perhaps the harshness was necessary; John could feel his head starting to spin, flashing over images of Sherlock holding him so close, of Sherlock's hand on his leg under the table, of Sherlock constant, intense gaze, of Sherlock... so much Sherlock, his life had revolved around Sherlock and of course that could mean that Sherlock's life had revolved around
He took them to help him study. He barely slept – he was quite proud of this – and relied heavily on these prescription meds to get him through each day. He found boundless energy with them, finding that with 23 hours a day at his disposal he could practice with his sports teams and study in the library whilst soaring through his assignments with top marks and accolades aplenty – oh, it was music to my ears. At first I was dismissive, uninterested, but as he started to eclipse me in everything and I steadily became his arrogant friend – whereas before he had been
John's lips separated for a moment, seemingly considering his answer – alas, another humourless smile twitched at the corners of his mouth; he shook his head slowly, placing his palms flat on the desk as he pushed himself up. “No, y'know... I don't think I want to have this conversation.”
This, at least, seemed to have been offered in all its genuinely good intentions rather than to sneakily suggest anything; John appreciated it. "Thank you. I feel the same way about him."
"Be quiet and go and stand with your brother," Wanda ordered, brushing past John and spreading a cloud of delicate perfume in her wake. "Such beautiful natural light coming in, it'd be a shame to waste it -"
"Boys, stop your bickering," Wanda hissed as she and Tim moved in front of them in order to follow the small line of people entering the house, frowning at Sherlock's little smile of pleasure for getting the last word, "or at least save it for after the ball."
Finally scrubbing the lingering smell of earth from his skin feels good. Sherlock’s wash is cedar and sandalwood with an edge of something sweet, and it lathers much better than John’s cheap
Which is true. John once tried to convince a doorman that they were there to do an audit, gave up halfway through his speech and knocked the brute out with the hilt of his gun instead. Impressive, but not a great testimonial to his theatre skills. This would require something more than acting, a suspension of disbelief, a brutally realistic trick.
but no one actually does, no one possibly can and it makes John want hit something. But he breathes, steadies himself by counting his pulse against strong fingers and reminding the monster inside his chest that even Sherlock hurts sometimes. That maybe he hurts most of all, now.
Patience pays off, and John moves his hand around to undo Sherlock’s trousers. They shift awkwardly, John anchoring Sherlock’s hips up so he can ease them down his legs. Water sloshes over the edge of the bath, but neither give it any attention. His feet are now trapped in tangled cotton. All at once he feels embarrassingly exposed, naked and obviously wanting between John’s legs.
A strong hand grips Sherlock’s waist and John pulls him down a little as he scoots up again, trying to gain the height advantage. It works to disrupt the slow grinding Sherlock had managed to build up between John’s legs, and he’s momentarily disappointed. Then there are fingers working open his sodden shirt, see through against his chest as it’s peeled apart, and John grazes his nipples with the pad of his thumb.
February is all round just shit. It rains almost every day, and though the melancholy is comfortable, the tide of boring cases brings with it a restlessness that sets Sherlock’s patience on edge. Either way, the weather does nothing to improve his mood when he leaves the therapist’s office.
Whatever mess was about to come next is silenced by Sherlock’s mouth again. Slower, claiming each word and folding them away back into the recesses of John’s mind, where they can take care of them another time. Not now, while there’s just the right cocktail of agony and need to keep going, and exhaustion enough to let them both relent to something that’s always been there.
It doesn’t feel like make believe though, as Sherlock nods once and John crowds in closer, slipping a hand around the back of his neck and resting the other delicately on his knee.
“…so this scorpion comes along, and Orion plays with it because he fears nothing, absolutely nothing, until it kills him, beats him at his own game -“
Hurriedly John turns onto his back again, struggles in the lack of light and space to take his own shirt off. Eventually he manages, bundling it into a tight ball before turning back over to Sherlock again. Not ideal but it’ll do, will at least be more effective than the flat of Sherlock’s weakening palm.
The periods of silence are almost creepier than the slight rustling he can hear. Almost. For a moment John regrets getting out of the habit of taking his gun everywhere, just the weight of it would be comforting. As that thought occurs to him, the ominous noise gets louder and closer, the direction indeterminable in the acoustic oddness of tightly packed trees.
A lot of things had apparently happened that way. Like his lips finding Sherlock’s, his palm aching to slide further up his thigh.
If Sherlock feels the same, he doesn’t show it. Turns on the shower faucet and steps back towards him, smooths hands up and along John’s biceps and to his face again. Then they’re kissing. John is melting, quickly disintegrating into Sherlock’s touch. The sure placement of his palms and the meeting of their hips as closeness becomes inevitable, the ease at which Sherlock moulds into him like he isn’t fearful at all. As if he has been the rock all this time, and John has just been clinging on like wave battered seaweed, nothing without the strength of the man pressed against him.
The scratchy emergency blankets they were both wrapped in six hours ago were not nearly enough to remove the chill of well water entirely. John shivers, standing there in the quiet living room. Watches without comment, as Sherlock begins to light a fire, still wearing his coat.
Morning blue eyes never leave his own, as John finishes what he started on Sherlock’s shirt buttons. They are prised from their holes one by one, slowly enough that Sherlock has to clench his jaw to stop himself from letting out a groan of frustration. Mercifully, John doesn’t wait much longer to touch him, mapping the contours of his chest and waist with his lips, tongue circling his navel and sucking at the hollow above his hip bone. Sherlock pulls painfully against his bound wrists, as John presses an open mouth to his clothed cock, hard beneath his trousers.
It’s relatively easy to navigate through the next couple of rooms, tracing their path back to the central staircase. The furniture is sparse and Sherlock’s iPhone beam is unnecessarily bright, but John stays glued to him regardless. Smoke clings to the threads of Sherlock’s coat and John can’t complain at the comforting smell of it, uses most of his effort to refrain from burying his nose in the lapels. Really he should be more shocked by that desire, yet in the darkness with the slight blurriness of whisky running through his blood, John finds that he isn’t at all.
