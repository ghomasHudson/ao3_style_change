OLD WOMAN
I’m glad you said that! Because guess what?
ROWENA
WIDE SHOT of Dean, sprawled on the table-- Sam yells out and runs from the library, but Jack is closer-- he gets to Dean’s side and leans over him.
, dude. For years. I mean I didn’t know for sure. Kind of thought it was funny, really. Then I just got annoyed with both of you.
You have had
Jack did not see the need for Hell. Or Purgatory. He found it-- what was the phrase. “Needlessly punishing”. He said that not everyone was lucky enough to be raised by the Winchesters, and grow up surrounded by love.
You’ve finished the big patch, then?

CASTIEL
Well, mayyyybe. But it sure isn’t going to be today.
EXT. MILTON HOUSE – NIGHT
The scenery shifts around them into--
THE EMPTY
Back to Jack, approaching the table full of shots.
END OF ACT ONE
Some miscellaneous hunters trying to wave around the displayed swords from the library, and Eileen LOSING HER SHIT at them. The hunters guiltily lower the swords--
No. The amount of grace it would take to rival Him is inconceivable. Even myself and Lucifer combined would not be enough.

Dean enters the kitchen first, switching on the light. Michael and Jack enter after him. Dean turns back to Michael, scowling slightly. He points at him, and then indicates the fridge.
INT. THE IN-BETWEEN – DAY
AZAZEL
(embarrassed for him)
No, it’s-- fine.
Back to the infirmary, where Castiel has resumed his solemn vigil at Jack’s bedside. Sam is sitting next to Jack in a chair, scrolling on his laptop. Searching his databases for anything that might help. Rowena hangs back, and peers over the balcony. She looks skittish.
WIDE SHOT as the forces of The Darkness and The Light fight for balance (very

I was there. Where were you?
You were always jealous of her, weren’t you? A
What’s wrong?
So, hate to break it to you, but you’re not top dog anymore.
MUSIC CUE: “
The boys are inside a grocery store aisle-- empty of other people, but fully stocked with breakfast goods. Sam throws various items haphazardly into a shopping cart. Dean raises his eyebrows at Jack when Sam isn’t looking, and throws in a SUGARY COOKIE CEREAL.
AMARA
MICHAEL
He’ll get bored. And then he’ll have to change it up.
On Castiel, left behind-- still struggling to reckon with their generosity.
Speaking.
I didn’t find anything in the lore about it either.
CHUCK (CONT’D)
CASTIEL’S GRACE finishes leaving the Empty through Dean, momentarily lighting his chest up with a particularly vibrant glow.
Rowena scowls and starts an incantation, but—
After a moment, Dean seems to find the words.
Claire grins despite herself. Looks away, hiding how fond her reaction is. Starts idly swinging her legs against the car.
Slow zoom on the back of Dean, Sam, Cas and Jack in low-lying beach chairs. Toes in the sand. Nothing in front of them but the wide, endless ocean.
I like her already.

Yeah. I s’pose.

You should really use the gym more, Dean.
BOBBY
CASTIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)
You did well. I am glad that acting as the weapon of my will was enough to allow a human to kill an archangel. I was not certain you would succeed, but old magic like that is almost always metaphorical.
CASTIEL
BOBBY
might know one. But...
Oh, it was nothing. Piece of pie.
I see you’ve redecorated.
CASTIEL
(trailing off)
Two weeks ago, the entire afterlife system was altered. We’re not, uh, completely sure how--
Then Michael starts laughing.
Back to Dean, now TOTALLY PERPLEXED.
Really, Dean. This early?
I just keep thinking about Mary, and all the people from the Apocalypse World, and--
ROWENA
CHUCK
What if normal’s not what I want, Dean?
I can stay awake and keep watch. I’d rather be useful than sit here bingeing ‘Star Trek’.
Crap. Men of Letters couldn’t give us more interchangeable globes, huh?
CASTIEL
The woman gets on her hands, and stands up. Squints at the sky. Clearly disorientated.
WIDE HIGH ANGLE SHOT on the road. We see THE TRUCK start up again, and drive away into the distance...
What I want...
The Empty TWISTS THE KNIFE, and Dean SCREAMS.
Castiel nods, and tears begin to track down his cheek as he smiles-- no, LAUGHS-- shaking his head in disbelief. Dizzy with happiness. Entirely, overwhelmingly human.
WIDE SHOT of the motel room-- it’s a memory we haven’t seen before. From before Sam left for Stanford.
. If I could, I’d do it myself. Could really use the peace and quiet.
I’m sorry, Dean.
CLAIRE
ON DEAN, taking a moment to close his eyes, as though in silent prayer. He braces himself, steps out of the car, and--

ELLEN
Dean remembers that Castiel is human now, and opens his eyes again. Frustrated.
Thank you for everything you did.
Let’s uh, give him a minute. I’d rather avoid the nuclear fallout zone.
Dean, could you give him a second?
Michael turns aside to Rowena, allowing her to fill in the other side of the story.
YOUNGER DEAN (CONT’D)
MICHAEL
Fixing Heaven. How long--?
He regards the shelf critically, and then sweeps several globes into the trolley without much thought.

Speaking of which should we--

You want us to team up? I always thought you’d look good in a Blue Power Ranger suit.

She rolls up her sleeves, and fluffs out her hair on either side of her head.

EXT. KELLY’S CABIN/LAKE – EARLY MORNING LIGHT
Sam blushes. Rubs the back of his head, flustered.
METATRON is being CHOKED BY JANE-- but then, the younger Castiel STABS HER IN THE NECK. Jane groans as the angel blade goes through her.
Dean looks away, unable to face him.
I mean you just started doing whatever I told you to. No excitement, no intrigue...
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – CORRIDORS – NIGHT
Jack?
Castiel looks contrite. Dean keeps walking towards them as they talk--
Cas once said that being a part of this family was finding happiness in the small things. Because there was always going to be another fight, there was always going to be something tearing us apart, but if-- if I focused on the moments in between those conflicts, I would see the love that was there.
Werewolf.
Both of them walk towards the Bunker’s entrance. Sam puts a hand up to cover his mouth as he yawns.
I suppose he’s... older. Uglier. Blindingly white.

A KNOCK at the door interrupts his thoughts, and he quickly lowers his arm.
I vastly prefer the dinners with less murder too.
JACK (CONT’D)
And Jack-- Jack is--
Sam looks to Dean and gestures towards the war room.
MICHAEL
MICHAEL
But... isn’t being the son of Lucifer what makes me ‘special’?
He turns his head back towards Jack. Frowning. Piecing it together.
OFF DEAN-- a little taken aback by the open affection. Then he relaxes back into a softened smile.
That story will always be a part of us.
It doesn’t matter, anyway. I don’t do it anymore.
You know, Leonardo, Michelangelo... Never mind. Fine, I’ll come down in a bit. Just need to finish this first.
How do we fix it?
So if we do this... it’ll be over?
Dean and Castiel stare back. Painfully aware they don’t have Jack around to protect them.
CUT TO:
Name one.
Off Castiel. Visibly terrified now he has to face the music.
I think if I could remake Heaven, it would be like this.
(newly determined)
MICHAEL
And as Dean speaks, we get a montage of different scenes--
Why won’t anyone on TV explain
CROWLEY (O.C.)

Oh, nothing. But, uh.
ACT TWO
On Patience, Alex and Kaia in the car, Alex silently yelling at the others (‘hurry up!’).
Sheriff Ken?
They’re not that bad!
You said the sheriff’s office was in Cheyenne?
Please, Castiel. Me, just take me. Take me, please.
Alright.
Footage used from 10.09 THE THINGS WE LEFT BEHIND, in which Dean is slaughtering the loan shark gang.
(grinning)
BACK ON the younger Castiel, recovering from having the whole world ripped away from him.
Aw, don’t look at me like that. I mean, huntin’ ain’t bad, either.
Dean opens the door to his room-- it’s dark inside. As he crosses the space, we see his bedroom also now has a paned window. He closes the curtains on either side of it, shutting out the night sky.
BLACKOUT.

It’s certainly done wonders, I think you’ll agree.
CASTIEL
WOMAN
CLOSE ON YOUNGER DEAN-- seriously beaten and bloody. One eye swollen shut.
ROWENA
(eyeing Dean)
You guys really did all this in one afternoon?
Dean is horrified, and yells out--
Hello?
You first.
A good strategist knows how best to win others to their cause.
Maybe this time, finally-- things can be different. Maybe we can rest.
Actually, I’m not an angel anymore.
We’re not here to fight you.
Jack, I wish you wouldn’t use the power acquired from thousands of dead angels and demons to embarrass me in front of my friends.
Everyone in? Okay, now smile and pretend you’re having fun.
And as a consequence, the souls have no power with which to influence or damage him.
As Jack talks, we get a short montage of OBJECTS in the Bunker.
Castiel momentarily looks down at his fuzzy cardigan, confused. It’s an insult to fashion?
Dean and Sam look back and forth between them.
We see the younger Dean smile and joke with Lisa, as our Dean stares on, lost. Convinced he’s back in a loop of his own regrets.
SAM (O.C.)
He looks up, with a bitter smile.
DEATH
Wait-- wait, what?

Dean rolls his eyes, but grins as he finishes the mix. He digs out a whiskey tumbler from under the counter, and pours out the drink.

(tight)
The Empty.
Panning through the gathered hunters, we see some familiar faces: JODY MILLS and DONNA HANSCUM chatting with GARTH AND BESS FITZGERALD. KRISSY CHAMBERS talking to CLAIRE NOVAK and KAIA NIEVES. ALEX JONES and PATIENCE TURNER talking to AIDAN and JOSEPHINE BARNES. JACK KLINE talking to MAX BANES in a corner. Most people are holding bottles of alcohol, a couple are holding plates of pizza.
I think that blood acted a bit like Miracle-Gro on a sapling. And, well... Fergus always was soft, even as a demon.
Off Castiel, looking uncertain.
Dean sees Castiel and cries out--
The ex-and-current cosmic entities turn to Eileen, mostly forgotten until this moment.
CHUCK
ROWENA (CONT’D)
Yeah? Well maybe this new Imperfect Heaven is givin’ me phantom pains, because I sure as hell
In the SIDE MIRROR, we (and Jack) see a crashed vehicle-- ON FIRE-- behind Eileen’s car.
CHUCK
The crowd murmurs, their reaction still mixed.
Sam grimaces at that metaphor. He turns back to Rowena with a melancholy smile.
What?
He reappears back where he was standing before.
(turning back to Castiel)
Jack frowns, and starts to walk away-- then DOUBLES BACK. Stands in front of Sam. Looks straight at him.
(a beat)
(a benediction)
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – STUDY – DAY
The younger Castiel’s eyes snap back towards the younger Dean. There’s a pronounced moment of sexual tension. The younger Dean’s eyes glance down briefly at newly human lips. The younger Castiel stops breathing. And then...
Not on your own. Tapping into the power to reach me nearly killed you.
YOUNGER CASTIEL
(pointedly)
I don’t want to go home to find them-- or, have them find me--

Stupider than monsters, yeah.
You need us, you just give us a call, Sam. Wyoming isn’t too far. We can make a detour on our way back to Sioux Falls.
You’re going to pump
I appreciate the help, Eileen. Really.
(mysterious)
On Ash, who’s fiddling with an old camera phone. He gets it propped up against two beer bottles. Slowly backs away.
Sam still hesitates, looking to Dean for guidance. Dean tips back a mouthful of his drink and takes over.
Sam looks at Dean, who subtly gives him a ‘go on’ tilt of his head. While Sam is talking, Dean takes the folder from the sheriff and flicks through it.
MICHAEL
Hello? Sir?
SHERIFF KEN
ROWENA
Horrified, Dean SLAMS the BUNKER DOOR in Lucifer’s face. Too late-- Lucifer’s reappeared behind Dean.
Cas said that, huh? Well, he was right. You’re
Yeah.

She puts it on the top of the chest of drawers, and we see her leave.
Oh, yes, in all the usual senses.

Jack suddenly scrambles to his feet, as a CRACK OF LIGHT begins to SPLIT the air in the middle of the room.
(in shock)
END OF ACT ONE
Oh, yeah. Come on in, cowboys.
CASTIEL
Huh. And I suppose you’ll fix any errors that pop up? Magic away any viruses, so to speak?

I’d still take immortality.
We’ll talk to Jack about it. Kid can fix it, right?

CASTIEL
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. No more o’ this Heavenly shopping list tripe. Cas, tell us about Sam and Dean.

Theoretically?!

KEVIN
Well,
S’okay, Sammy. Don’t give him the-- the satisfaction. I wanna... I wanna be at peace.
BECKY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Sam is caught off-guard by this-- by Jack’s change in countenance and sudden vulnerability. He walks over to Jack, and sits down in a chair next to him.
First Sam and Dean, and now this. I’m doing my best in impossible circumstances. My friends, they abandon me, plot against me. It’s difficult to understand.
MUSIC (V.O.) (CONT’D)
(taken out of his own thoughts)
YOUNGER CASTIEL and YOUNGER DEAN watch on as YOUNGER SAM lies in bed, incapacitated. Set, make-up and costume to match 7.17 THE BORN-AGAIN IDENTITY. Castiel is stroking Sam’s forehead, looking miserable. Our Dean twists his head around-- disoriented again.
He’s dead. Finally.
Death DISAPPEARS and REAPPEARS right IN FRONT OF DEAN’S FACE. Dean FLINCHES, but maintains eye contact.
You’d find a way to break free.
There was... a deal, he made, to bring back Jack. He never told us about it, until... it doesn’t matter. He made a deal, Sam. I don’t think the Empty is going to let go that easily this time.
CASTIEL
SAM (CONT’D)
MICHAEL
Charlie grins and dives down to lean over at the empty end of the table between Castiel and Bobby, chin in her hands. She looks eagerly up at Castiel.
I’m sorry if I was intruding.
CASTIEL
Sam finally looks away from the road to Jack-- but suddenly, a ROCK SONG RINGTONE plays out loudly and breaks the moment. Both of them look down to--
CLOSE ON a RED BUZZER, that Ash WHACKS.
WIDE SHOT of the highway. As the instrumental outro plays, we see the Impala driving into the distance.
Dean pauses at the entrance door. He throws a teasing, Dean-Winchester-Trademarked smile back at Sam.
Sam and Jack breathe deeply, staring at the shitstorm in front of them. Only now fully grasping the extent of what Chuck has done.
Weakly, he reaches towards the younger Castiel.
Like a cork has just been released, all of the coiled emotion and energy in Dean suddenly springs loose.
(also intermittently signing in ASL)
I don’t know. Still in the garage, I think. He doesn’t seem to be dealing well with...
It’s about the principle--
Off Sam, grinning like a madman in love. Happy his brother has given his blessing.
...And?
Ash stumbles back, his sunglasses slipping off his face.

THE EMPTY
BLACKOUT.
brought us back, did he? I’ve heard all about your new pet project. Well, dare I say, since I bloody well died as a member of his defense squad, it’s the least I’m owed. And he gave me my original body back, in the bargain. Have to admit, I’m a fan.
(closing his eyes and seeking strength)
(pensive again)
Chuck, Dean and Castiel look towards the corridors and hear scuffling--
YOUNGER DEAN
(chuckling)
(simply)
It was tonight or never. We can’t stay another day away from home. And ya know, Sam and Dean can have the leftovers.
Castiel follows Dean into...
THE END.
There’s nothing to talk about.

Off Castiel, looking on. Overwhelmed by this small act of paternal love and forgiveness.

CLOSE ON THE PLASTIC PLAYERS, and THE BALL being knocked back and forth as Michael and Jack twirl the handles around.

Some footage used from 7.01 MEET THE NEW BOSS. A younger Castiel is looking around a bright meadow.

Dean shakes his head and passes over his phone, still grinning.
The Empty looks down in bewilderment at the blade through its chest. Michael removes the blade, but there’s no tell-tale glow--
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – CROW’S NEST/LIBRARY – DAY
Dean grits his teeth, and slams on the breaks. The tires somehow don’t make a sound, ever as the car shudders to a halt.
Advice? I thought that was why you were here. Who else could give us advice on rebuilding Heaven?
Google Maps says it’s an old motel.
--appears at the place where Jack was born. The location looks much the same, (using the cabin model from 12.23 ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER as a reference). At some point it seems the tree has been hit by a storm; it lies broken in half, the severed top of the tree sticking out of the lake. It’s a beautiful evening. The sun has set, but the sky is still light enough to be streaked with vibrant colors.
Right. And the other?

CLOSE ON DEAN, tense. Unreadable. Then suddenly, something starts buzzing.

Castiel closes his eyes briefly-- his face lit up by the light of the escaping angels and demons-- and opens his mouth. His own GRACE spirals out and joins the rest.

Dean notices that Death disapproves, even though his tone is as dry as ever.
Yes. I know.
The headlights of a passing vehicle flicker over Dean’s face, illuminating it completely for a moment and he smiles. He tightens his grip on the wheel, looks forward and drives on.
I admit, I am struggling to deal with the limits of human perception.
ACT THREE
ROWENA

Well, to tell you the truth, guys, the Empty has been a total bitch recently.

They both walk around either side of the car and open the doors of the Impala.
(to Jack)
Castiel smiles at Jack-- a smile filled with every ounce of love and gratitude in his soul. Then he looks out at the horizon.
A couple of glances are exchanged around the room-- some people clearly don’t like this idea, but others are more enthusiastic.
Dean grits his teeth. Annoyed by Michael’s consistent violations of his thoughts and feelings.
Billie was coming after us, and Cas summoned the Empty. It took her... and it took him. Cas is gone.
WIDE HIGH ANGLE shot that TILTS UP as the Impala drives towards the distance. Shot rests on the STARRY SKY as we hear a repeated instrumental outro for the song.

So he dragged
Dean walks down the corridors of the Bunker, dragging a hand absently along the walls. The camera lingers as Dean’s hand passes and we see a SCRATCH in the walls where Billie dragged her scythe in 15.18 DESPAIR.
Dean’s just a dick.
I can’t believe that worked.
Jack! You coming?
Well, we should-- I mean, Sam and Dean--
Eileen looks up at Sam, who’s half-amused and half-exasperated by his brother.
And AMARA RE-FORMS behind the Winchesters, looking
I-- you can’t just do that. Don’t you
She gets up to leave, following Castiel back out of the room. We’re left with Dean and Michael, simmering in silence. Michael watching Dean with vague curiosity. Dean pacing up and down the floor, restless. Barely stopping himself from punching something.
LUCIFER (AS CASTIEL)
Dean...
Physically, yes. Metaphorically... I know I am filled with regret, and anger. At what my Father deprived us of. At my brothers and sisters, lost before most of them could understand free will. Before they could understand the truth of our Father, and find themselves without Him. I am even angry for the other worlds, and all those beings wiped from existence.
CHUCK
Hm. Not really in the habit of sleeping with my leading men, but I admit the thought is--
WIDEN TO REVEAL CLAIRE, sitting in the back seat. She leans over into the gap between the driver and passenger seats.
Azazel steps forward, and tips Sam’s head up so that he can look directly down into his eyes.
A pause, as Jack remembers the act, and the consequences. His next words come slowly, a half-whisper of self-flagellation--
Meanwhile Claire drags out a chair for Castiel, looking at him expectantly, and Castiel goes over towards it--
TORTURER 2

On the other hand, it’s a bit ‘Twilight’ isn’t it? Angels

Way to insult a guy.
HIGH ANGLE ON DEAN, looking up at her...
. The second we feel the Empty open, we’ll come get you.
Uh so, Cas, you and Jack, good to uh--
Dean JERKS OUT with his foot, and sends TORTURER 2 CRASHING TO THE GROUND. Dean FIRES clumsily from his gun, and the bullet hits at POINT BLANK RANGE.
There. No escape now.
SHERIFF KEN
Footage used from 4.16 ON THE HEAD OF A PIN, in which Dean tortures Alastair.
Another sad smile from Castiel. Then, meeting her eyes, a HUSHED, half-apologetic CONFESSION--
We see an elderly woman frowning at someone, an old-fashioned corded telephone at her ear.
Oh, finally! I was worried you guys weren’t gonna show. Always awkward when you send out those Facebook invites and you never know if people are really coming.

LUCIFER, wearing his old meat suit NICK. He’s leaning casually against the entrance alcove, looking amused.
And I tried, Dean! When you were in Purgatory, I tried to be good with Amelia, but it was only because you
I know what I’m doing, and how much to take. The only risk will be to me.
Max doesn’t look placated by this at all, but he doesn’t say anything else.
The rest goes unsaid, but Sam knows what she means.
EXT. HEAVEN – DAY
It’s a complicated mess in there. And I don’t rightly know how the boy is holding it together. But I think he’s managed by-- compartmentalizing.
Back on Jack, talking to the TELESCOPE. A wistful smile on his face.
Well, you tell those kids if they’re not careful they’ll end up like me-- over forty, and can’t do my own taxes.
Drop them, you son of a bitch!
ROWENA (CONT’D)
Dean blinks, taken aback.
Rowena?!
On Castiel, who pauses and looks back at the Bunker.
AMARA (CONT’D)
Dean sits down in his chair. He feigns a look of great offense at Sam’s statement.
What?
Which is now OVERFLOWING WITH PEOPLE.
There’s nobody more worthy of being an angel than you, Cas. As for your grace... Maybe you were falling, or maybe Chuck had something to do with it. Maybe Heaven’s collapse was affecting all of the angels that remained. But...
these places anyway? They got a TripAdvisor for creepiest stays in rural America? Four stars, found a dead woman in the shower but the blood stains on the walls didn’t seem very authen--
DEAN (CONT’D)
The Empty’s space is all but Swiss cheese, beams of light streaming through the darkness and more appearing every second. Michael circles The Empty, and they scuffle desperately. Michael wields an ARCHANGEL BLADE while The Empty works with its BLACK, OOZING KNIFE.
TORTURE VICTIM
I gave your brother the archangel blade, and told him to kill Lucifer when the time was right. Obviously, I had to be invisible, or Lucifer would see me.
OFF JACK-- grinning as he looks from one to the other.
(embarrassed, looking away again)
Dean looks at Sam again.
(to Dean)
Claire looks like Christmas has come early.
do you mean, little sphinx?
No. No deals, no alliances. I know you’re too far gone for that. First chance you get, you’ll stab us in the back.
Look at me!
Alright,

Look, I’m uh, sorry. About Nora.
Word of advice, kid-- don’t listen to a single thing that comes outta Ash’s mouth.

CLOSE ON SAM, blinking awake. Completely disoriented. He looks to the side and sees--
Well, I, for one, am perfectly happy with my own bed. This one is appallingly lumpy. You need new mattresses for this whole place, since these are clearly leftover clearance stock from the mid-1920s.

No buts, kid. Come on, let’s go make sure Sam hasn’t accidentally set the library on fire.
It feels selfish to enjoy life, when so many others couldn’t.
Dean is visibly struck by the sight of Castiel in the glowing light. AT PEACE. Dean swallows nervously. There’s a stretched silence between them, and then--

They roll the trolley along a little further, and pass by an ELDERLY LEBANON WOMAN, who waves.

EXT. ROCKY’S BAR – DRIVEWAY – TWILIGHT
Sounds good. I’m in.
Jack, Amara and Castiel consider this.
Inside we see TWO MEN standing over a BONFIRE. On a TORTURE RACK placed over the fire is A YOUNG MALE TORTURE VICTIM, whimpering. The shorter torturer is pacing up and down the room, anxious. In contrast, the taller one is perfectly still-- other than his fingers, which keep running over a lever placed next to the torture rack.

Humans aren’t well equipped to handle knowledge like that. They’re used to the divine being-- an uncertainty. Inaccessible. Terrifying. Not a person just as fallible as them. And certainly not a child.

Two abandoned warehouses, two break-and-enters, one hospital ward, one morgue, a church crypt, and bizarrely, a Biggerson’s kitchen down on Avery Street.

In what, God? In case you haven’t noticed, God’s gone full-on Thanos.

Well, yes, but... we had to complete the warding.

He’s better off here, Dean. And, frankly, so are you. You can’t hurt anyone anymore.
Have we?! Dean, you could end up trapped in the Empty right alongside Cas!
ON SAM, looking to Rowena for answers-- and ROWENA, scandalized.
Like dominos falling over.
She looks around, frantic, and her husband sits up behind her.

You can’t have him.
Sam finishes tying the bandage, and steps back. They both walk out of the motel grounds and across the street.
A beat of silence, where Dean picks up on the song being played over the speakers.

We can do this the easy way, or the hard way.

He looks at Eileen, who smiles back, and there’s a clear ‘that’s my girlfriend!’ vibe going on--
Yeah, well. That makes two of us.
TO BE CONTINUED...

Should-- I mean, should Sam and Cas stay in this room? What if something goes wrong?
MAMMON
Meanwhile, Chuck continues monologuing.

She looks back to Dean as he interrupts her thoughts. She is exasperated, but still rather fond.
Just Heaven. And a long line of souls in here, waiting to be reincarnated.

Oh, he did, huh? Well, I guess Cas is wiser than I give him credit for.

Anything else you can think of that’s happened recently that’s odd? Out of place?

Well, first, I imagine we should burn this vessel.

What if we bring him back wrong, and the boss gets mad.

Let’s just say whatever was left of my soul needed some filling in. And, of course, you know all about the revitalizing properties of demon blood.
Jack knows better than to ask why Dean might not be picking up.
I-- okay, I’ll pretend to get what that means. But if bodies don’t matter, why did you need me?

The music track is a little more distinct now there’s no dialogue running over it.
DEAN (CONT’D)
A tense beat. Dean runs his left hand over the perfectly made coverlet. Tightens his grip into a fist that clenches the material under his hand.
Just as long as everyone else got to live.
Well, that’s a relief. You could help me with the pie, if you like. I’ve just started on the pastry.
Dean, what did you say about Dr. Sexy season ten?
Jack said he was... ‘connected’ when he was God, because Amara was helping him. But now...
But I have to be ready for when they come back!

If it works, you’ll be God.
On Amara, standing back from the group, looking a little lost. Pensive. Thinking about her brother.
Now, mother, the day is young, and we’ve only just dropped in on the Winchesters. Rude of us to not give warning. They didn’t have time to get their swords ready, and we have nothing to throw ourselves upon.

Thousands of years of the same stock standard implements of torture, and suddenly the youngsters are dragging machines into the Pit, putting souls on assembly lines. Electricity and automation. The way you youngsters can find uses for technology-- well, that’s something else.
SAM (CONT’D)
Sam was eager to see the place. I mean, we’ve been blue-ballin’ him for months.
I don’t--
He conjures an ORANGE COCKTAIL out nowhere, and begins sipping on it. Flips his sunglasses back up, lies down and goes back to sunbathing. COMPLETELY UNBOTHERED.
Should we lower it?
MICHAEL
Unbalanced.
We took Jack in.
YOUNGER SAM
I want to be without anyone imposing their ideas on to me!
Eileen, this is Rowena and Crowley. They’re, um... old friends.
Why the glum faces?
TORTURER 2
Oh, Sam. Did you really use one of the most powerful resurrection spells ever made on someone other than Dean? That’s certainly character development.
The Empty starts stroking the BOUND BODY OF CASTIEL possessively with one hand.
BACK ON DEAN, in the present, looking forward to the road. Then he looks sideways...
Alright, I was going to humor your dream of defeating me for a bit longer. I might have even let you watch the end of the show. But now you’re just getting on my nerves.
MICHAEL (O.C.)
Dean isn’t going to be happy with us for leaving like that.
I always thought Heaven kind of sucked, anyway.
Sam rolls his eyes, both of them easing back to the comfort zone of brotherly teasing.
Dean turns back to look at his YOUNGER SELF in the distance. A car goes past, and the younger Dean starts stalking away.

MICHAEL
I don’t want to be selfish. I don’t want to be Chuck. But if I could make everyone happy-- shouldn’t I? I feel like I’m letting everyone down.

Dean grumbles something unfavorable under his breath. Turns around to busy himself with the task.
Sam exhales, wondering how to explain it to Jack in a way that doesn’t sound callous.
Jack smiles-- but it’s a delicate, muted thing. Nothing like the typical Jack smile we have come to know and love.
Um. Am I missing something--?
Get in the car.
Sam laughs... and pours Rowena a drink.
Castiel smiles. Fond. And now, openly allowed to be.

WIDE SHOT: A bustling cineplex. There’s people lining up for movie tickets. A college-aged woman in a scarf passes by the queue. The camera tracks her movement. She walks to a derelict bookstore, and enters. A shop bell rings as she does.
How can you guarantee that?

Well, sorry to say, pal, but I didn’t miss you at all.
This is nice.
Sure, great. Many hands, and all.
CLOSE ON DEAN, a complicated look on his face. Not a happy expression at all.

So... you want to make a deal?

INT. THE EMPTY – TOTAL DARKNESS
We see Sam’s face go through a complex series of emotions. First relief, then fear, then a thin veneer of composure.
Uh... yeah, not so much. See, after Pop snapped everyone away, things got real boring on His favorite show. No fighting, no melodrama...
Sam turns suddenly to Castiel--

A quick montage of every single scene where Castiel has killed an angel--
Dean has been watching this exchange, while the other two ignore his presence-- but on this news, he breaks in, voice still hoarse--
MICHAEL

A TEAR OF LIGHT opens up right beside Dean.
Sam SNATCHES it out of Jack’s lap, and slams the receive call button immediately. He holds it up to his ear.

Chuck reaches out and waves a hand at Rowena-- who doubles over, in shock and pain, as her PURPLE MAGIC starts swirling around her chest-- and then Jack, too, sinks to his knees with a scream--

You’re alive?
Dean gets himself off the table, advancing towards Lucifer. Still holding his injured shoulder with one hand.
Please, Cas. Please.
I couldn’t say for sure. But there seem to be more than just angels and demons contained in the Empty. Powerful creatures, of an earthly origin. If I had to guess, I’d say they were monstrous in nature.
My spell was the one that

Something successful happens on stage. Those backstage turn to each other with glee. High-fives, hugs, and silent celebrations.

I imagine Naomi was making Castiel kill copies of you over and over again, until he was ready to do the same to the real you.
EXT. HIGHWAY – SUNSET
Lovely to meet you both.
Sam looks away. Smiling-- it’s a fond smile, but tinged with melancholy. The weight of knowing the privilege of Dean’s love... and the costs Dean has paid for that love.
ROWENA
Their faces get bloodier and bloodier as hit after hit comes--
You ever see that show about the two brothers? One of them trying to free the other from jail? What was it called?

Jack’s happy expression falters.

Sam grins. Triumphant that he’s found freedom from Chuck’s characterization.

Dean gets into the car. He reaches over into the backseat, and rifles through a BOX OF CASSETTE TAPES. Picks one out from the others.
Wait, who’s
Yeah, and?

Dean lets go, and starts walking back to his chair.

Dean and Jack each take up a side of the foosball table-- Dean GRINS, clearly excited for the match.
My mind is beyond your comprehension. A moment after possessing you, I had experienced every second of your life to that point.
I wanted to thank you for what you did before.

Well, they’re not proper human souls. More like prototypes. The difference between an old man and a newborn-- an average angelic or demonic soul is less developed than that contained in a human fetus. Like a seed to an oak tree.

What??
15.22 – For this title, I thought about using ‘End in Blood’ (referring to, of course, the famous found family line from the show). But I didn’t think that made as much sense out of context as ‘In the Blood’, a slightly more subtle reference to the same idea. Mostly refers to the idea of something running in the family, or ‘in the blood’. Also happens to be the title of this John Mayer
And what about the Empty? When Cas dies, he has to just relive his regrets over and over? If anyone deserves to be in Heaven--
We get a POV of Jack’s back-- camera crests up and over the hill to reveal CASTIEL, curled up near the shoreline. Knees tucked into his chest. Staring vacantly out to the distant mountains.

DEAN (CONT’D)
Castiel was meant to die in the attempt to save you from Hell. He was meant to die in a barn soon after. He was meant to die again, and again, and again, and yet it never stuck. I always wondered why-- why he was the exception to the rule. No matter what I did, my subordinates could never pin him down long enough to squash him.
Rowena shoots a triumphant look towards Jack. But Jack is frowning up at the ceiling.
BLACKOUT.
Ellen whacks her arm.

Meanwhile, Ellen leans over her daughter and peels Jo’s hand away from the INJURY; it spurts BLOOD. Not looking good. In fact, looking FATAL.

Slow zoom on Jack as he walks up the stairs of the raised platform to the TELESCOPE. Meanwhile, off-camera, we hear scuffling and muffled laughter-- sounds like both Eileen and Dean have found something extremely funny.
Everyone in the crowd mutters to each other. An old woman shakes her head. Her elderly husband watches on.

Dean stares down at him. QUIETLY TRIUMPHANT. Meanwhile, Sam is holding his phone to his ear.
A BUZZING from Dean’s pocket. Dean exchanges a look of surprise with Jack, and whips out his phone.
His voice breaks for the first time, and the Winchesters realize that this loss has affected Jack far more deeply than he’s let on.
--do you even know who he is?
You don’t need to tell us. We’ve been running so flat-out on this damn Fall stuff I’ve barely slept. Every damn day since the clock reset, I’ve been driving over the map trying to sort out something that doesn’t fall into the category of ‘supernatural’ so much as it does regular people crazy. And even when it’s definitely demons, I can’t even exorcise them. I gotta kill ’em or report ’em to the cops.

Dean flicks on a side light, and makes his way to his bed, stripping off his outer layers of clothing as he goes and tossing them to the floor.

Hey. You’ll work it out. But you’ve gotta have faith in yourself. You have faith in Cas, right?
Chuck shakes his head, almost fond. Mostly condescending.
I didn’t even know angels
Okay, okay. Confessions. Um, Sam-- Sammy. Did I ever tell you... Did I ever tell you that night that, uh... that I came for you when you were at school? You know, when dad hadn’t come back from his hunting trip? Yeah, um... Uh...
A brief pause, as Dean looks for a change of topic.
ANGLE ON ROWENA, lips sealed shut by magic.
What, playing the ‘best of’ compilation on repeat? What good is that crap?
I’m so sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
THE EMPTY
PAN ACROSS to reveal CHUCK SHURLEY behind her, looking apologetic.
Of course things have been busy, with the fallout of Jack’s changes. I don’t really blame Dean for-- it’s not his burden to bear.

Dean and Michael reappear, and Dean cries out in alarm.

But you’ll never be able to. Not like this. Something will keep waking you up.
But as the story grew, we made it our own.

Azazel stands up again, and paces towards Sam-- and now, he walks with controlled purpose. No trace of his previous laziness. But Sam isn’t intimidated at all.
REVERSE ANGLE to reveal POV-- OUR CASTIEL. Older. Wiser. Regretful.

Then Dean looks down at his bottle and gives voice to his remaining doubts.
You’re drunk.

You should have gotten a happy life, Sam. A normal life. A dog, a wife... a kid. M’sorry I took you away from that.
(sincere)
Ugh. Couples.
Dean’s head, turning back around and grinning. WIDEN to reveal Dean with a FRYING PAN full of pancakes. He flips them on to Sam and Jack’s plates with a spatula.

If it’s our only chance to stop him--
I really appreciate that.
How can we know Chuck didn’t send you too? Write you into this story? How can

What could something like
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – GALLEY – NIGHT
Okay, Dean.
Look, I think we can handle things. We’re not dead, and we’re not under Chuck’s control. And that’s a pretty good start from where I’m standing.
Things start out small, and then they grow.
Wait, what about all of the other worlds Chuck destroyed?
CHARLIE
What, you want us to bore Chuck so much he stops paying attention?
It’s not just that. I feel like I owe them so much more. And Sam and Dean keep lying to people for me, just to protect me from their questions.

Back on MICHAEL, watching impassively as The Empty (as Alternate Michael) circles him.

WIDE AERIAL of a BEAUTIFUL BLUE SKY. CRANE DOWN to reveal HARVELLE’S ROADHOUSE, as it originally stood-- but now placed within a GREEN FIELD full of bushes and flowers.
Don’t know what you’re talkin’ about.
(also signing ‘hunting’ in ASL)
You bastard.
Very well. What questions do you have for me?
I will
Yeah, yeah.
The Empty DISAPPEARS and REAPPEARS right in front of Dean’s FACE, noses less than an inch apart, and--
I think the souls inside me will help. But I... I’ve been holding back from touching them.
So the universe will still be...
Did your father hate your powers?
Because there is no more Hell. No more demons.
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – DEAN’S ROOM – DAY
Don’t try anything else. We’ll get Rowena to look at you.

What, in a bar you own?
AMARA
CASTIEL
(confused, still unsure where this is leading)
It’s insulting, is what it is. All this time running errands for the Winchesters and they don’t even call once we’re topside.

INT. BASEMENT CRYPT – NIGHT
I have spent enough time in Adam’s mind to qualify John Winchester as ‘disappointing’.

ON DEAN, in his car--
Well, guess who stabbed the new Lucifer through the heart?
Mm-hmm. Let’s see how you fare against your own house of mirrors, shall we?
You could call it that. A place of temporary sleep, removed from time itself. Where souls await their next destination.
I’m sorry. But I’m not going to let you hurt me, or anyone else, ever again.
No. There won’t be time.

CASTIEL
Chuck looks annoyed. Sits up, leans over and cuts off Dean’s prayer, tuning the dial to another station.

CHUCK
Does the ending of a story define its meaning?
Max and Eileen comparing the weight of two of the Bunker’s HISTORIC GUNS--
Yes. I feel fine.
Yeah, I’ll... I’ll do that. Call me if you need anything.

INT. MEN OF LETTERS – CROW’S NEST – DAY
You know, I’ve been thinking. We should have been the ones taking Jack cross-country.
The Bunker stops shaking, and Jack, Rowena and Sam (holding Adam’s body) are left behind.
(bitterly)
Some footage used from 7.17 THE BORN-AGAIN IDENTITY, as a YOUNGER DEAN WINCHESTER confronts YOUNGER CASTIEL and DAPHNE ALLEN. A typical couple, in a typical suburban home-- normalcy utterly disrupted by the presence of this interloper.
(furious)
Well, alrighty then. Girls, you wanna help me take this to the kitchen?
For you, because of you... as Adam would say, “whatever helps you sleep at night”. I, of course, found this statement ludicrous whenever he said it, since neither of us could sleep in the Cage.

Michael talks frantically in Dean’s ear--

Oh for-- what now?
Sam trails off, looking back towards the bedrooms.
CASTIEL
Jack holds up his hand, examining it curiously. A single spark of YELLOW MAGIC flies out-- the others FLINCH. But nothing else happens.
Even if we can get the portal open--
Castiel steps in front of Jack. He kneels down on the floor, so that he is looking up at his son.

But it was ours.
Well, I never. Young Sammy grew up to be a scoundrel.

The Winchesters rebelled against angels, demons, Destiny, and even the Word of God itself.

But Sam has already walked off towards the war room. Dean follows. Behind them, Castiel notices the movement and murmurs an apology to Charlie and Stevie.

We’re not talkin’ about this. Get out of my car.
EXT. AKOBEL AND LILY’S HOUSE – DAY
Jack...
Aw, don’t say that. You’ll scare off my best customers.
And THE DARKNESS finally overcomes The Light. All of CHUCK’S LIGHT flickers out at the point of his hand, and he sinks to his knees. Cradling his SMOKING, SINGED PALM to his chest.
But I imagine Dad is listening in right now, so there’s no point contemplating it.
Michael gestures to the space around them. Barren, dark-- utterly devoid of life.

Dean turns the keys in the ignition of the IMPALA, and slowly follows behind them.

He flicks his index finger, and Dean levitates over the balcony-- his body hovers for a moment, then goes CRASHING DOWN INTO THE WAR TABLE below.
Sam is almost clinically detached as he speaks.
And Jack? He’ll be back on time?
Still. I’m sure I can make do.
Dean is thrown by this sincerity, and has to gather his thoughts again. He chuckles, trying to break the moment.
So all the other people, all the other lives, they just get erased? Because what, they were

Time has clearly passed since we were last here; the study is even messier than before. DIRTY PLATES are scattered around, along with few candy wrappers and discarded soft drink cans. Rowena is lying passed out in a SLUMP, on a make-shift bean bag of several blankets and plaid jackets. Sam is staring at a book in front of him. Jack is playing on a NINTENDO SWITCH.

Stop bringing everything back to sex!
Huh. Yeah, I’m sorry we weren’t here.
IT’S SUNDAY AGAIN, ROD.
(taken aback, but delighted at the prospect of gossip)
(unimpressed)
We’re not?
Castiel is agonized. He looks away from Dean’s face. Doesn’t want to see the answer he thinks is there.
(looking at Dean)
On Dean, seat empty beside him. Smiling, but looking down... some melancholy there. His chair squeaks against the floor as he stands up.
Ah, whatever. What’s that saying about a bird and a fish falling in love?
WIDE SHOT. TWO ANGELS appear on either side of Anna. WHITE GRACE-LIGHT illuminates the scene; when it is gone, so is everyone but the younger Castiel-- who once again is looking out at the ocean.

Castiel smiles back at her in acknowledgement... but it’s tinged with sadness. He turns back to the dishes.
Technically I have several hands.

On Dean, looking over the Impala roof at them. Fond. Smiling softly.
You know, last time someone tried to absorb a bunch of souls and become God, it didn’t end so well. Why would this be any different?
On Sam, listening to the phone for a beat. Jack looks on from beside him, wide-eyed and desperate for information.
Well, I ain’t gonna make him work the bar. He’s worse with alcohol than he is with food.

Kevin stares at her, incensed that he’s no longer being backed up. Charlie shrugs.
Michael scores again. Jack smiles at him, and lets go of the handles-- he has finished the game. Michael mimics his actions. Following Jack’s lead.
It’s likely you did it subconsciously. Something like an automatic defense mechanism, a magical immune system response. Whatever the cause, the result is that you’ve filtered the souls and separated them from the grace and miasma. The power inside you right now is almost completely pure.
And Rowena WAKES UP-- confused, gasping for air--
CUT TO:
CHUCK (CONT’D)
JUMP CUT. Jack, Dean and Sam in front of the television-- the latter two are sitting in the armchairs on each side of the couch. Jack knocks over his POPCORN AND COKE when something on screen happens-- food and drink spills across the couch and floor. He looks up, mortified, but Sam just laughs and Dean smiles.
CLOSE ON DEAN’S STOMACH, as The Empty STABS HIM with AN OOZING BLACK KNIFE.
However much you can give.
CAMERA PANS OUT as music ends and the Impala drives off, TO REVEAL--

And now?
Dean draws up his gun to shoot, but the man hurls a METAL BALL towards him-- it EXPLODES WITH SPARKS, sending Dean, SHAKING, ELECTROCUTED, PARALYSED-- to the ground.
Yeah, I took a version of you at his word before, and you know how that ended up? It ended up with my s-- with Jack soulless, and a bunch of people I cared about lying dead in my living room. So forgive me if I don’t fall for the same trick twice.
BIRD’S EYE SHOT of the three in bed-- mattresses arranged in a triangle, so their heads meet in the middle. A moment passes as the three stare up at the ceiling.

God’s weakness. The thing He never counted on. Don’t make me say it; I have a reputation to maintain. Still, I can hardly blame Him.

You might say God was finally killed through pure, obnoxious,
The room dissolves into chaos as most react to this with laughter and some with exclamations of various kinds.
You’re w-wrong...
Giving himself permission to enter, Dean closes the door gently shut behind him. Sits down on the bed beside Jack. Hands clasped together. A long moment stretches out, and then Dean speaks.
It’s not your fault.

She dissolves into a BURST OF DEMONIC SMOKE-- and other demons and angels around her begin to turn into SWIRLING ANGEL GRACE and DEMONIC MIASMA with a GREAT RUSHING SOUND-- they INTERTWINE INTO A SINGLE STRAND OF LIGHT, and are all SUCKED INTO DEAN’S CHEST-- and then, straight out into the PORTAL.
Amara looks down at her brother, unflinching. The light fades, and--
He knows what he signed up for!
Oh, don’t struggle, now. Those handcuffs will just sap more of your strength.

FADE IN:
ANGLE ON CROWLEY. Looking pointedly between Dean and the wasted booze. Disapproving.
EXT. ROCKY’S BAR – NIGHT
Bobby stands, and walks towards Jack. For a moment, Jack looks apprehensive. Bobby looks like he’s going to tell Jack off. Then--
Oh. Well, you can build your own dispensary, now. You can build anything.
Was wonderin’ when you two would be in.
CLOSE ON OUR CASTIEL. Tears now spilling down his cheeks.

Ordinarily I’d suggest finding a way to juice him up... If there were angels around, we could drain them, but if Lucifer’s grace wasn’t enough to charge up the battery--

Sam and Dean in the Bunker in Season 15, Sam and Dean right back in the beginning of 1.01 PILOT. Sam and Dean clinking beers while leaning on the Impala. Sam and Dean hugging over and over again. Then, finally, the Sam and Dean clip from 5.22 SWAN SONG, sitting on the Impala and watching the stars.
Sam CUTS THROUGH the last of the monsters, and rushes to Dean’s side--
Dean shares a look with Sam. Calculating how much they share.
I made all these decisions, but I don’t know if they’re the right ones. What-- what if I... should’ve brought people back? I heard Bobby say that I should have brought back Mary, and--
He swings back around to Jack, pointing at him.

CLOSE ON OUR DEAN, turning away, and we begin a dreamily cut montage between different scenes as Dean walks from memory to memory--
And where are Michael and Jack now? You send them to bed?

Jack looks to Rowena for help... but Rowena simply looks away innocently. Not this kid’s parent. Not getting involved.
Meanwhile the younger Dean finds a WAD OF CASH, and shoves it towards the younger Castiel.

Dean ignores him. Walks down the stairs to the infirmary beds. Wastes no time getting down to business.
I don’t think life should be perfect, or that we should all be immortal. Maybe it’s okay to just-- appreciate the time we have.
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – STUDY – NIGHT
I don’t want this. I don’t want to sit here letting people suffer, while doing nothing to stop it.

Crap. I took Eileen’s phone when she disappeared.

What do you mean?
Castiel turns to see her. Pleasantly surprised.

His face is tense, and he looks down in shame.
Younger Dean’s voice breaks, pleading--

CLOSE ON OUR DEAN, on his knees. SILENTLY WEEPING. No single man tears this time-- he’s a mess.
On Sam-- speaking up for the first time in a while. Frustrated.
Younger Dean goes back to unpacking his bag. The younger Castiel watches him cautiously from his carefully distanced perch alongside a motel room wall.
NEIGHBOR
Dean narrows his eyes, and gives Sam a thin, sarcastic smile.
He nods at Dean.
All good things take time to mature. And you, Dean, you were a vintage I didn’t see coming. Of course, I do take credit for that as well. Who knew that burning Mary on that ceiling forty years ago would lead to such a delicious result?
Man, he was fun for a while, but I shouldn’t have brought him back after the Apocalypse. Tried killing him again, of course. Remember the Leviathan thing? The drama, the buildup, the lake exit, I thought I was being nice. More than he deserved, really. But things got kinda boring without him--
Quick cuts as Sam slices a few open with his knife. BLOOD SPURTS from decaying flesh. Then Sam gets off some more shots with his gun...
Dean and Sam look at each other. A beat... and then they grin. It’s no question at all.
Amara extends a hand to each of them, and Sam and Dean trade a glance.
Oh, you want help? If it’s our way, we could head back earlier than we planned--
Good. Man, I can’t wait for Azazel to rule this place and make us feel like something again. I had to dumpster dive for food the past week. Like some sort of savage.
DEAN (CONT’D)
BLACKOUT.
I don’t understand. What does Cas have to do with this?
YOUNGER DEAN and LISA kiss chastely in farewell, as Lisa leads Ben away. In the background we see Dean, watching them.
I have faith. Cas taught me faith.
But right from the beginning you vouched for me, even though you had no reason to. You convinced Dean to let me stay. You’re the reason I had a home.
CLAIRE (CONT’D)
Come on, Eileen, sit down. We’ve gotta start eating before this food gets cold.

Suddenly, A HUGE BLACK TEAR opens in the study in front of them-- the walls of the Bunker SHAKE-- they’ve torn a hole in reality that should not be opened.
EILEEN

If-- if that’s all. Then, I also just wanted to say thank you. For being our allies, and our friends. And just for this night, let’s celebrate. Tomorrow we’ll drift off to different places again, but... This life, I think sometimes we don’t get enough chances to sit around with our friends, our chosen family. So I hope tonight you-- get a chance to do that.

Damn straight.

Castiel sighs, and starts draining the dirty water out of the sink. As he does, Eileen picks up another plate and starts drying again.

WIDE on Sam, Castiel, Jody and Jack standing at the war table. Sam has a duffle bag slung over his shoulder. A LOUD CLANGING SOUND rings out from the direction of the garage... like, for example, a shelving unit holding a lot of paint cans has been tipped over.
Dean and Michael hear the sounds of footsteps, and turn to see Castiel race back into the room.

Several shots in quick succession showing Sam and Eileen moving tables and furniture around. Dean attempting to move something-- wincing.

Maybe if--
Jack frowns. Not sure what she’s getting at himself.

Uh, thanks.
Aren’t you?
On Castiel and Sam, who have a quiet conversation behind her-- neither looking away from Jack, even as they talk--
Selfishness
Uh, thanks.
I-- alright.
MICHAEL
EXT. EILEEN’S CAR – HIGHWAY – DAY
Great.
Seriously? Thanks. I mean, I was gonna offer. Moving things can’t be comfortable with your shoulder.
The Empty VIOLENTLY FLICKS its hand OUTWARDS.
Dean lowers the shirt in his hand back into the basket. Slowly, he turns to look at Sam... almost expressionless. Uncharacteristically still. Hiding any possible reaction.
Okay.
LUCIFER
(resolved)
ARGH!
RUFUS
I’m proud of you, Sam. The thing you’re doing with this Hunters Association it’s-- I think it’s going to make a real difference.
(half-agony, half-astonishment)
And I never wanted to feel like this, because you’re always walkin’ out on us for some reason. Heaven always needs fixing. Even now.
Sam grins, flexing his hands-- he’s FREE OF THE CUFFS! One of his hands is holding a WITCH’S HEX BAG. Now
THE EMPTY
We see ROCKY’S BAR-- similar to how we saw it in Dean’s mind in 14.10 NIHILISM. However, there are some differences... A little less extravagant. A little more homely. More hunter paraphernalia hanging up on different walls. Empty shelves and half-open cardboard boxes. Things are clearly still being arranged and unpacked.
So-- stay with me?
Jack, no--
Castiel flinches. A beat.
No, Cas, shut up for a moment. Let me talk, because I have to-- Cas, you gotta know.
Eileen puts down her plate, and takes Castiel’s suds-soaked hand in between two of her own.
I suppose so.
(thrown)
He starts shaking the cocktail mixer.
Right-- we were always on the move. Always something to fight, or--
...I didn’t want to say it when the boy was here but-- I’m worried about him.
Cool trick. But whatever it was didn’t work. I’m still just as powerful as ever.
And raises THE BLACK KNIFE--
He raises his beer bottle.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Stop it. Just-- stop it.
Some footage used from 10.05 FAN FICTION in addition to new footage. Camera moves across side stage. We see the front of the stage with SIOBHAN (playing Dean) and MARIE (playing Sam) performing--

QUICK CUT MONTAGE of previous footage--
THE EMPTY
Jack looks between them, amused.
MID SHOT of the MOTEL ROOM-- John and the younger Sam are barely holding themselves back from a brawl, while a YOUNGER DEAN stands across the room holding his hands out between them. Desperately trying to keep the peace.
Jack said there would be an ‘adjustment period’.
Then we find a way to break the deal. When we made a deal with Billie to break out of that facility in Colorado, Cas broke the deal for us. We’re just returning the favor.
THE EMPTY
Castiel huffs an almost-laugh.
PATIENCE
I think so.
Claire walks over to Castiel. Swings herself up onto the trunk of Eileen’s car.
Everything. He’s why you’re still with us-- and why you have a chance to win.

CHUCK
But Dean--

She moves away, humming to herself.
This is somethin’ I gotta do.
Sam takes a deep breath, and then--
Chuck always thought endings were hard.
I hope you’re not just angling to get back in here, because it ain’t happening.
Claire shrugs. Embarrassed, and hiding it in prickliness.
Turns out you were right. But not for the right reasons.
Jack, looking forward, suddenly turns to Sam with alarm. Sam hangs up, THROWS THE PHONE INTO THE BACK SEAT, and abruptly HARD TURNS THE WHEEL--
CASTIEL
YOUNGER CASTIEL
Where are you, Cas?!
(pointedly)
Shut up.
And Mammon’s eyes go wide in HORROR--
Is he... he really dead? Is Jack God now?

--I’m finally happy, you know, and then this whole spree of murders happens, and the things they do to those victims--
(quiet again, withdrawn)
Oh yeah? Who, huh? The demons that don’t have powers anymore? Queen of Hell, maybe? If Rowena’s back, we sure haven’t heard from her. Maybe she’s gone dark side again.
--but our Castiel doesn’t hear him, caught up in the scene playing out, in which--

Still better than most of the beds we slept in growing up.
On Jack, and Castiel supporting him from his right side. The light has faded from Jack’s eyes, and he looks puzzled.
Dean. Way too much information.
CASTIEL
Yeah, he did.
CASTIEL
Demonic beings gain power from Hell, just as angels gain power from Heaven. It is a parasitic haze that consumes a soul-- a perverse reflection of angelic grace.
Amara pushes past Castiel, impatient and wrathful.
WIDE ON AMARA, who is looking up at the sky. Contemplative.
They say you should kill your darlings.
MUSIC CUE: “
Dean leaves, and Rowena and Sam exchange a glance as soon as he’s gone.
Thanks. Uh...
Sam and Dean aren’t dead, are they?
Dean barely has the energy for a reply, but he gives Sam a look. Huh?
But Castiel isn’t looking at him-- he THROWS DEAN ASIDE and puts himself between Dean and--
CLOSE ON DEAN. Slumped asleep. He blinks awake, and scrambles to sit up. Looks around, bewildered.

Who cares what Jack said? We don’t know what happened! But I swear, if he did something to her, if she is--

Dean turns back to his Castiel, and shakes him gently.

Castiel’s voice is breaking too now. He reaches his arms around Jack and HUGS HIM TIGHT--
ROWENA
This stuff’ll get yeh. First priority we had once we were free of our personal cages was making moonshine that tastes real and sticks on your soul.
Camera tracks Sam and Dean as Torturer 1 takes them through the room. Then, on the other side of the lobby, we see A MAN in a janitor’s overalls, stained through with blood and grime. Azazel, although Sam and Dean don’t know that yet. He’s reading a newspaper dispassionately, but looks up with interest at the newcomers.
I understand you mean it as a compliment.
It’s Dean, right?
CASTIEL
Yeah, that’s God’s sister. What, you haven’t met?
I haven’t found anything either, Dean. I’m sorry. And while Chuck’s at full power--
REVERSE ANGLE ON BOTH. Father and son staring out at the water. Pensive. We’ve interrupted them mid-conversation.
Unless-- Cas, monsters can die in Purgatory right? What if the monsters that die there get sent to the Empty?
(to Dean)
And finally, Michael gives voice to what he’s been hinting at all episode--
Sam looks down at Adam’s face... then back at the portal. Tense.
He trails off, unable to say more. Swallowing his grief.
DEAN (CONT’D)
No, Cas. I wouldn’t change anything. I love them. I love

Anyway, to make things more interesting, and make you all more tolerable, nobody will be allowed to speak except Eileen. To that end, God-- run us through the signs for each different character role.
Promises, promises. Then again, I shouldn’t underestimate you. I mean I knew you were special, but boy! Tricking Lucifer himself!

You and Dean... I used to sense things. Like, your souls.

Jack stares. Not so much horrified as openly perplexed.
I used to be a lot more murderous.
CLOSE ON AMARA. Hesitating. Nose flaring slightly as she notices something.
Back on Dean, bloodied and sporting a cut under his eye. Hands bound with cable ties to one of the bed frames upturned against the wall.
You’re not supposed to be here.
Yeah, you could say that.

Oh, yeah? And Sam is a good strategist according to you, huh?

Yeah, we got an old file pulled up that had your number attached to it. Said to call if we ever heard any funny gang activity that mentioned a particular code name.
Do you really think the boy can take it?
I’ll go with you.
A few years ago I would have struck you down for such an insult.
Dean smirks. Lascivious.
Still. I was afraid you’d turn on us.
TORTURER 1 (V.O.)
Didn’t he... just annoy his way out, last time?
END MUSIC CUE.
ROWENA
We can’t all pony up for stained glass and Teenage Mutant Ninja paintings.
Castiel watches him. Angry with rejection he’s perceiving in Dean’s words.
Dean grins at him-- also slightly teary-eyed. He nods, and then huffs a laugh. Speechless.
I mean. He started it.
Dean continues to stare at the phone in shock as Castiel’s voice plays out. Shares a brief look of astonishment with Jack. Then--
So? What did those idjits get up to, apart from the God-son? They still huntin’?
He bolts from his chair, and is out of the room in a flash.

(almost to himself, with an edge of frustration)
(as sardonically as possible)
There a reason you’re so keen to get home?
Yes, she is. I told you it wasn’t gonna be easy. But if you want to do this, Castiel, if you really want to do this, you got to ask yourself what’s more important-- her life or your family?
And I’d say the Winchesters would have made the same choice they always have.
The hell is this place?
WOMAN
Sam blushes, and runs a hand over the back of his head. VERY EMBARRASSED.
No, He isn’t. He has a limited attention span. And why would He look for something He didn’t expect to be there? Especially if something else was commanding His full attention. For example, if I was loudly discussing what a bad father He had been.
We see the back of A TALL MAN, who brings two cups of coffee out of the café. He places them both down at the small table in front of Adam. We don’t see his face.
Where’s Dean?
If more demons work out how to use demon blood like that--
A short series of JUMP CUTS show time is passing, as piles of books appear and disappear around him at the table. Sam’s posture gets worse and worse as the night goes on, and he looks like he might nod off once or twice. But he forces himself to stay awake and keep searching for anything that could help.

We see Jack looking at THE HANDPRINT on Dean’s jacket.
However, I could be amenable to viewing recorded entertainment features. Adam told me about a movie with a talking polar bear he said reminded him of me. I’d like to watch that one, if you have it.

The man LUNGES, and with the element of surprise catches Sam unaware. He jabs him with a TASER-- with a SPARK OF ELECTRICITY and a ZAPPING NOISE, Sam’s immediately ELECTROCUTED. He falls over. KNOCKED OUT.

No, actually, it’s not, and you know that. Why else would you keep this whole thing a secret, huh, unless you knew that it was wrong? When crap like this comes around, we deal with it... Like we always have. What we don’t do is we don’t go out and make another deal with the Devil!

No, I realized that much when I saw you blunder in here with your brother.

Mid shot of Dean and Cas, left alone in the driveway. A formidable silence hangs between them. The elephant in the room louder than ever.
MID SHOT closing in on Ellen, Bobby and Rufus-- Ellen says something snarky to Bobby, and Rufus laughs--
Apparently, they “don’t need sleep”. Jack wanted to show Michael ‘The Office’, so I imagine they’ll be occupied for a while.
Look, our dad was-- complicated. So maybe don’t bring that stuff up to Dean.
What?
A beat, as various players absorb the gravity and confidence of Michael’s statement.
He looks at them-- and the scene flashes BRIGHT WHITE.

The woman walks away from the crowd, smirking.

I tell you what, he’s much more manageable as a human. Honestly, I wouldn’t have kept him around, but... well, I have the magic teleportation, and he has the secret locations filled with valuables that nobody else knows about. It’s mutually beneficial.
Our Dean reaches out and grasps at the lapels of YOUNGER CASTIEL’s trenchcoat--
Did you know Ash speaks Enochian? The way he’s broken through the encryptions here-- it’s incredible. You wouldn’t happen to have time to look through some code we’ve been translating--
He looks back at Dean, thinks ‘fuck it’, and grabs him again in a brief, tight hug.
But she didn’t choose to be a Nephilim, so she’s innocent.

Transition down to the Bunker below, beginning a single shot that pans through different rooms in the Bunker--

YOUNGER DEAN
I’m good, I’m good.
Dean stares at him. Incredulous.
Jack looks up from the laptop to Sam-- he can tell by Sam’s expression that it isn’t time just yet.
Dean clutches CASTIEL’S BODY closer to his chest.
Sam and Dean make grossed out faces. Michael, however, doesn’t react-- he doesn’t get the reference (or chooses not to).
Tragically, yes. You have no idea what a downgrade that is. Who wants to be a stupid, stinking, emotional pile of meat?
I thought he wasn’t going to interfere anymore.
Castiel gives him a small smile.
To the Winchesters!
I thought even Chuck couldn’t touch the Empty.

He swivels the computer monitor around to face them.
Sam turns to Dean, amazed.

Eileen is carrying three opaque bags full of what looks like books and hunting equipment. She walks down the stairs, smiling disbelievingly.
You know I didn’t appreciate you enough, Dean. I heard all about your work on the Rack. True artistry, I’m told. A once-in-a-generation talent.

The Empty SHIFTS-- and we see it take on the form of ALTERNATE UNIVERSE MICHAEL.
WIDE SHOT, as the last of the GRACE AND MIASMA exits out behind them and channels straight into JACK-- who is LIT UP with it, ABSORBING IT ALL-- chaotic winds are blowing through the room as energy swirls everywhere--
Whenever I lose my powers, I’m always so afraid for them. When I realized Lucifer could be brought back from the Empty... I’ve always felt like I’m looking over my shoulder, waiting for him to show up.
A beat as Dean pauses, and restrains himself from an outburst.
Thank you so much to everyone who read this – and a very special thanks to the people who commented or messaged me about it and cheer-led me through to the end.
(still robotic)
So, there’s no way you can trap him, or-- bring people back using Jack’s power?
The boys are watching movies again. Jack and Sam share the couch, and Dean and Michael are in the armchairs on either side. Michael is next to Jack, and keeps looking at him rather than the film. Sam is reading a book of lore, and seems relatively content.

Business casual, activewear, mothers with prams. All of them stopped still. Looking at the FLICKERING TELEVISION SCREENS within.

When I gave up the grace, I didn’t intend on keeping any. Even whatever remained of my grace-- the other Michael’s grace, whatever it was-- seeped into the fabric of Heaven. But your grace... Cas, your grace was so strong that it stuck to me and refused to let go. I could feel its love, you know. I... I think you gave it its own free will.

The Empty looks down fondly-- disturbingly fondly-- at Castiel’s unconscious form.
I don’t sound like-- you know, I don’t gotta answer to you.
ANOTHER spike goes through Dean’s RIGHT HAND-- RAISING it outwards from his chest--Then his LEFT HAND and RIGHT LEG, and now he’s fully CRUCIFIED--
Oh, you’re
Patience.
Stay here and watch him.
I thought the answer was free will. But I understand now. You need a firm hand. You need a father. And I am your father now. Be obedient, children. Or this will be your fate.
(a horrified realization)
INT. BOOKSTORE – DAY – FLASHBACK – 2005
They spiked his drink, Dad! It wasn’t his fault!
Jack will hold true. I have faith.
--nothing bad! Like... when someone is longing for the person they are in love with. When you were going on that date with Eileen, it was-- very bright.
Oh yeah?
DEAN (CONT’D)
Footage from 9.10 ROAD TRIP, in which YOUNGER SAM AND DEAN burn KEVIN TRAN--

The brothers get out of the Impala, and make their way towards the bar.

Amara, I know you can hear me. You gotta fight him.
I’m--

Very well.

CASTIEL
CASTIEL
A pause. Chuck squints, looking almost intrigued. Then Michael’s voice again, with less certainty than his usual commanding, regal tone.
WIDEN to reveal The Empty, standing beside him. Insidiously evil.
Meanwhile, Rowena is RIGID-- STARING up at the ceiling, unmoving even as Sam shakes her--
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – THE DEAN CAVE – DAY
If by ‘with’, you mean romantically and sexually intimate--

A quick cut montage of hunter funerals--

On Michael, surveying Dean. Considering him.
Not killing you when I had the chance.
So...

You lack faith.
Come on. Cas, Castiel. Please.

Then how come you’re both unaffected?
Castiel pauses, closing his eyes. A father’s request for forgiveness.

Yeah, I’ll bet.
We should make breakfast for the others. It’s what Cas would do.
CLOSE ON DEAN’S PHONE, with the words ‘CAS CALLING’ on screen.
If you’re... if you’re out there, Cas... if you can hear me. I’m coming. I swear, I’ll find you, and I--

ROWENA
No, no, Amara’s locked up. Sorry.
I’m... I’m ready.
I was so scared, Cas. Knowing what the Purgatory souls did to you-- knowing what I could become. Knowing last time, I killed Mary... I put everything into making sure they couldn’t control me.
I still don’t know if I can allow myself to submit to them. It’s like standing at the edge of the ocean, and knowing you have to jump in, but being so afraid of how cold it is...
CHUCK
MICHAEL
Sam tilts his head down in anguish, unable to look at what remains of his brother... but Dean calls him back, through his dying breaths--
You shouldn’t.
(inconsolable)
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
OUR DEAN is clutching the trenchcoat in a mirror of the scene from 7.17 THE BORN-AGAIN IDENTITY. He thrusts it towards OUR CASTIEL, now dressed as he was in that episode.
(under his breath)
Why do I get the feeling there’s a ‘but’?
No. The wee boy’s powerful, but he’s no God.
We’re not gonna need the Colt to kill you this time.
Now spill. What’s the gossip?
(a beat)
Son of a bitch.
ALASTAIR
Let’s just say even the savants of the Rack could learn some things from her methods.
CASTIEL
Peace. For eternity. You will never be disturbed again.
ON THE WINDOW. Mammon is looking down at the car park through the broken glass, carefully hidden to the side of the window frame.
your love. I just didn’t realize until...
So did you.
AZAZEL
SHERIFF KEN
--or, almost exactly. I believe my great-nephew and I love this world more than Chuck ever did. So we will assemble it with love, instead of egotism.
ANGLE ON CHUCK. He’s in a tropical t-shirt, sunglasses resting on his head. Tan lines around where the sunglasses have been on his face. Snacks and drinks scattered all around him. Chuck frowns at the screen. He stands up, crumbs falling to the floor-- and with a SNAP of one hand, he changes into a BURGUNDY SUIT. Tan lines and sunglasses gone. His other hand now holding a REMOTE CONTROL.
Monsters, demons-- they are born of The Darkness. My... legacy, to Chuck’s creation. My aberration.
JACK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
(strangled)
know?
EILEEN
Jack sighs, and puts down the handheld console.
I’m in your mind, Dean. I see every part of you, every part of your heart. So let me ask you one question:
CASTIEL
(slowly)
Huh. It is. I mean, I wouldn’t trade anything for having my own room now, but... sometimes I almost miss Dean’s snoring.
Jack grins. Mostly just delighted by Castiel’s obvious happiness.
INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT
Dean.
MICHAEL
MICHAEL
But the Winchesters lost so many people they loved. I could have brought them back. I still can, if Amara--
Deal with him.
Hey, Jack.
Black goo begins to spill forth from the hole, as it gets wider--
WIDER out reveals the shop name on the window (still barely legible) BEN’S BOOKENDS. Nobody who passes by is paying it much attention.
Cas, is it... really you? Because I’m gonna tell you right now, I don’t wanna start punching holes in Baby.
I enjoyed it.
This is all-- overwhelming.
Uh. I’ll have... a beer?
I’m glad. But, I’m sorry you missed quite the party.
But this Castiel can’t hear him.
ROWENA
(getting more upset)
Your wife. Right.
Come on. You can help me with the mattresses.
(confused)
Both. Michael said Jack was theoretically capable of containing the forces from the Empty, but whether he can control all those entities inside him jostling for power--
ELLEN
But Dean, now that we know about Jack, now that Rowena can use Jack against him-- he can’t do anything to stop us. There will be a way. We’ll find one.
He’s right, Dean. We’ve taken on bad guys before.
ELLEN
See, you only saw one side of me.
Sam knows what he means, but doesn’t want to engage. He doesn’t take his eyes off the book.
Suddenly, a HUGE FLAME erupts out of Sam, blasting Azazel over into the corner. He yells out as he CRASHES into the desk, sending the chair and table toppling over, and splintering some of the wood.
He kicks the glovebox gently in emphasis, and Dean glares at him.
Half of God.
CHUCK (CONT’D)
Claire retreats back to the Bunker entrance. We hear the Bunker door creak shut behind her.
(singsong)
Yeah.
(certain)
But how many of them were spent being
Right. For me and Rowena, then. But you could rest too, if you wanted.
CLOSE ON the woman’s hands, skimming over a shelf. Her fingers pass over dusty titles such as ‘GODS OF AMERICA’, ‘VAMPIRE KILLER’, ‘FORBIDDEN FILES’, ‘ON THE ROAD’. She reaches the end of the shelf, and finds a book tucked away at the corner. She digs it out.
Alright, here we go--
Back to Jack and Sam. Jack seems to debate internally before--
(also signing in ASL)
I suppose he realized the Winchesters won’t be around to save the world forever.
YOUNGER SAM
Time to give Chuck what he’s got coming.
Nice try dollface, but nobody can handle that much power.
Oh, the angels won’t bother you anymore.
Right, and who even decides that? Anubis? What if people can change for the better? Or the worse? What if his system is wrong?
I don’t remember anything from when I was dead. But Sam told me Heaven is a loop of your best memories. And maybe Heaven shouldn’t be like that. Maybe it should be... more like Earth.
AMARA
...no sexual tension-- what’s the point if there’s no fun?
And how is it that
PASSERBY 2
Yeah, and the minute I start moving in those things I sweat like Patrick Bateman.
have time for this.
But you didn’t.
Three to go.
Um, Dean? When were you gonna tell me you got yourself a girlfriend in town?
Dean watches his younger self struggle to process this. He’s struggling to process it himself.
CLOSE ON A RECORD NEEDLE, and Sam’s hand-- he is putting a record on an old, expensive-looking record player.
YOUNGER DEAN
ELLEN
ON DEAN-- grinning widely.
Then you’re dead to me.
But-- these aren’t even the real me. He didn’t even kill the real me. Why does he regret
I thought you were-- I mean. We didn’t know if you were alive. Jack has no memory of who he brought back to life when he was God.
(still processing)
Both of us? This isn’t Dean’s fault.
CLAIRE
A pause, as Sam clasps Jack on the forearm. A brief touch of comfort.
You’re going to
Jack doesn’t have enough power to beat my Father, and there isn’t enough power on Earth for him to absorb that could possibly make a difference.
I’m not--
Footage used from 15.17 UNITY, where a (slightly) younger Dean is talking to a (slightly) younger Sam.
Wait, what?
AMARA
All eyes turn to Michael. Rowena’s fork hovers in the air, stilled. Jack stops eating mid-chew.
CLOSE ON SAM, going through a complicated series of emotions.
Dean stands to his feet abruptly, and in that same instant Sam has CROSSED THE ROOM. He HUGS DEAN TIGHT, putting the phone down for a moment to do so. Then Sam draws back. Looks at the phone screen again.
Well, come say your farewells to the girls, at least. They’ve really taken a shine to you, Jack.
--but now it seems like Heaven is the only post-death realm left standing. And with all these dead angels and demons popping up, most people are starting to believe in the existence of the supernatural. We’ve got CNN doing lead stories on angels, and people coming out of the woodwork to talk to the New York Times about their encounters with wendigos. Since people are asking more and more questions, we think it’s-- time to be more open about what it is we do.

Then, a banging noise from upstairs as the MAIN BUNKER DOOR opens--
Thank you.
Hope nobody else out there is wearing a me-suit.

MID SHOT OF THE THREE-- Dean and Castiel still holding their phones up to their ears. Staring at each other.
Dean is the one to violently try to break free this time, but he gives out a CRY OF PAIN-- the handcuffs have zapped him. Azazel flicks the knife blade up so as not to impale him as he struggles.
You know, you don’t have to be useful for us to need you.
Well, yeah, but. How else is he meant to contact us?
(to Castiel)
You don’t need to canonize us or anything. We’re the ones who are going to be doing most of the eating.
Ah, yes. I had noticed everyone’s favorite canary was missing from the coal mine.

CLOSE ON SAM, cradling his brother’s body in a mirrored shot to the end of 3.16 NO REST FOR THE WICKED.

Uh. Thanks, Donna. Um, we’re just talking about a case.

CUT TO:
MID SHOT on the gathering. Most of the feast has now been cleared off the table. All that remains are scattered dessert bowls in various states of cleanliness. They’re all looking at Claire as she speaks.
Face it, you little worm.
Honestly, it’s more fun this way. Really forces me to get my creative juices flowing. They say you should write with restrictions, and I guess Jack here is the writing constraint I have to work around.
Jack is clearly displeased by this order, but marches off obediently.
