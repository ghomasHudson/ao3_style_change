John was slowly pulled from his deep slumber to the sound of a soft melody playing from beyond his door. It confused him at first, being in that almost-awake-almost-asleep state, but it didn't take long for him to fully regain consciousness. Normally John would be annoyed, but he is use to Sherlock playing his violin at all hours of the night, and often enough that John could fall back asleep. But this wasn't a violin, this was something more gentle, more subtle. A piano.
“You were awake- never mind. Yes, yes it was.” John answered. He didn't even pay close attention to her appearance. However, he now realizes she was attractive with long red hair and green eyes. He probably would have hit on her if he ran into her at the Tesco.
“What?” Sherlock asked.
This is his flatmate, his best friend, his partner in crime (literally), and now his lover.
Sherlock paced his bedroom, his mind replaying the scene in Chemistry and his conversation with John. What is he playing at? Why is he so kind? He thought it was just John Watsons nature. Is he wrong?
“Well it stops him. He doesn’t swing your way, love.” Greg said, all seriousness in his tone.
Ah, now he is asking the right questions. Back to a bit intelligent then. "You don't."
"I didn't think it would be that easy." He said, searching through the rusty keys for the correct one.
Since the first grade, Sherlock enjoyed Valentines Day. He aways received a Valentine from someone in his class, though they never signed their name and Sherlock slowly grew to accept that, though the mystery is damning and his curiosity was killing him. He didn't want to do anything to jeopardize this one-way relationship.
Sherlock opened the note and immediately smiled.
“Not hungry.” Sherlock grumbled lowly.
“What do you think you’re doing?” One man asked John as he tried climbing in after Sherlock.
“Watch where you’re going!” Sherlock demanded angrily turning to the brown haired man that bumped into him and trying to compose himself by fixing his glasses and picking his phone up from the ground.
They didn’t speak until they were in the comfort of their flat.
John sighed. “It’s not your fault Sherlock.”
“Reckless bastard.” He whispered fondly and laid his head on the mattress beside their hands.
“Mrs. Hudson-” John tried to question.
“About your relationship of course! Honestly John I would think you would’ve told your sister first. Though I guess I always knew.” She shrugged like it’s no big deal. “Hey, we can double date! I promise to withhold all the homosexual jokes too. Like the ‘two gay couples walk into a bar’ ha, ha!” She laughed happily and glanced around the kitchen. “Gosh what happened in here?”
“Well, I am.” Irene smirked. “Look at us both.”
“Out. Don't wait up.” And Sherlock was gone.
"So," John came up beside me. "What now?"
The room grew so tense that John thought he could pick up his butter knife and cut clean through it. He could see Earnest with her mouth agape and Eugene eating ferociously and watching the scene intently. John was out of view of Frederick and Violet but he could definitely see Siger who is practically fuming.
John, who has just about had it with everyone today, replied “Yes.”
like me?”
Let's hope my crew can handle it.
It wasn't until the sky was black that he heard the sirens of the police and ambulance. John rushed towards the sound and discovered Lestrade arresting the man that John had shot. A few moments later, John heard rustling by the barn and discovered, to his relief, Sherlock. Although, to Johns dismay, he is fighting hand-on-hand with the second culprit.
John scrubbed his hands over his face and through his hair. They are past that now, Sherlock knows what he did, John knows why he had to do it, and they both know it will take a lot of time to heal that. It’s only been 6 months since his return, a month for John to finally talk to Sherlock again, and two weeks for him to convince John to live with him once more.
As if being gay is a disease. Is this what would happen to John if he were gay and came out? Is this something Sherlock had to go through (if he is gay)? Do people really have to endure such hateful words? From parents, no less. Johns not sure he likes the answer.
“Fine.” He sighed. “Let’s go.”
Suddenly, Johns mouth was moving without his consent. “You’re tranquil when you play. I’ve never seen you so calm before, not even when you're asleep. It’s wonderful.” John didn't realize that he was looking down at Sherlock with pure admiration and affection. Sherlock took notice, he takes notice to everything, especially when it comes to John Watson. Sherlock looked away, and John could've sworn he saw a shade of pink ignite his cheeks. John bit his lip to keep from smiling. Sherlock Holmes is blushing.
Sherlock took her hand and smiled kindly while John fully grasped her words. “What exactly has she been telling you?”
"Oh bugger," he grumbles before downing the rest of his beer.
“Yes.”
Daniel laughed hearty. “Why yes, I truly do. You should see what she does with her tea.”
“You and ‘Lockie!” She exclaims. “When did you two first start dating? Was it love at first sight? Or did it take some time? I imagine the latter given ‘Lockies tendencies to be,” She pondered a moment. “Psychotic.”
"It's wrong," John states.
Lestrade scratched at his stubbly beard. "That is strange, even for him."
stare. “You’re being dramatic.”
“Sherlock.” John scolded in his authoritative voice that he uses only on Sherlock.
"It's been done before." I'm still walking away,
We wave goodbye at Angelo as we exit.
John locked eyes with him and Sherlock smirked. “I-I told chuu, ever-r-ryone just assumesss.” He slurred, remembering to when Johns sister showed up.
"The escape or gallows?" I narrowed my eyes.
Thank you all so much for reading and your support through the story. I'm happy you all enjoyed it!
The second letter was a bit more explanatory:
Sherlock is like a rubix cude, complex and difficult to figure out and once you think you have the image correct, there is another side that throws him completely. Sherlock is never going to be figured out because there is always something more, something John is missing. He will never know if Sherlock is even capable of intimate feelings like those experienced in a relationship. Is he even capable of feelings in a
John had just started his sprint over there when he saw it. The knife. By the time John shouted Sherlocks name to warn him, it was too late. John watched as the knife sank into Sherlocks abdomen, forcing him convulsing to the ground.
We eat in companionable silence. I only make it halfway through my food before I feel the fullness in my stomach.
“Yes.” John answered. These are all standard questions that he has asked before.
“Don’t start. We will never speak of this meal again.” Sherlock angrily whispers back and then turns his attention to his cousin. “They’re slow coming but going as expected. If you have been on the blog recently you will see the case we wrapped up yesterday.” Sherlock kindly glared at her.
John smirked “Unfortunately, I think you may be right.”
“Sherlock.” John spoke warningly.
“Do not disturb me, John!” Sherlock growled in frustration. John, confused, turned the corner and saw Sherlock with his hands on his hips staring at the counter top where a gooey black substance could be found, covering the entirety of the counter and some of the floor and even parts of Sherlock himself.
“A man? I thought you were above this?” Siger demands of Mycroft. Mycroft stays quiet.
John and Sherlock are led through the archway and into a massive kitchen where a group of rushing butlers, dressed in black and white, are cooking and preparing their meal. Past that and through a large door, they enter the dining room which seems to be where the hosts are seated. Sherlock slows his pace slightly, so slightly that John wouldn't have noticed if he hadn't been walking so close to him. He is out of his element here, that much is obvious, but so is John. Without thinking, John takes Sherlocks wrist and gives him a reassuring squeeze and releases, quick enough so no one would notice, not that anyone was paying much attention anyway.
John leaned over and whispered. “You will eat more than that, wont you?”
"Sherlock?" John frowned at me with concern. Apparently, I've been staring.
John broke through the cornfields and ran. He didn't stop until he was deep within the field. He looked around, down the rows of corn and found nothing. He listened intently for any kind of sound. Nothing.
A noise filled the air just then, a sound that has, unfortunately, become familiar in recent days. A breathy sigh, like a moan. Irenes moan.
John stared. “I- you what?”
After a moment of waiting and listening for signs of life inside, John spoke again. “Maybe no one is home.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Oh please John, everyone assumes anyway, might as well have some fun.”
John scowled. He tried to think of a good response but came up short. Sherlock is not wrong, in the mix of him denying his sexuality, John was jealous that Irene got Sherlocks attention. John was suppose to be the one who kept Sherlocks mind interested, not her.
My eyes land on Angelo when I enter the pub, but only because he sees me first and exclaims my name before my eyes can adjust to the darkened lighting.
“I understand, dear, I've got a hip.” Mrs. Hudson soothed.
“Do what?” John played ignorance.
“Can we move on to the next please?” John rested his elbow on Sherlocks bed and placed his head in his hand. He can feel the stirrings of a headache starting.
And for the first time in months, John slept peacefully.
"John," I call over the roar of everything. He looks up at me just as lightning strikes, his features highlight in the pale flash. It's the briefest moment, but I can see the wild blue that are his eyes and just how adrenaline-filled they are. He's
"Step off the ship." Stamford said again. I stare at him but do as I'm told. I would not be able to have this ship ready and sailing before a bunch of angry Navy sailors climbed on board and attacked me, not to mention the guns shooting at me.
"We will see." John said finally.
“You alright there, Sherlock?” Greg asked in slight concern.
Sherlock looked at him like he is genuinely offended. “I think it looks good.”
“Obviously.” John repeated, never ceasing to be amazed by Sherlocks deductions.
“But it’s true.” Harry exclaimed in amusement.
John tried, he really did, but in the end he started to giggle. That finally got Sherlocks attention. At first he seemed rather confused which only made John laugh more, his whole body shook from the rumbles of laughter and soon enough, Sherlock was joining him. They both continued laughing together until a nearby younger student told them to be quiet a few bookcases over. John and Sherlock repressed their laughs but continued to chuckle with smiles on their faces.
…Oh God. John’s eyes widened as it dawned on him.
? John sometimes thinks he knows, then other times not so much.
“Well, I appreciate the hospitality regardless.” Sherlock stated, taking a sip of the lemonade. “My, this is remarkable. How did you manage this?” Sherlock asked in amazement.
"What happened that you didn't have a crew or ship when you left England?"
I didn't respond. No, I obviously
And it was then John realized Sherlock hadn't let go of his hand until they were inside their flat.
“Let me tell you this, all of you, this man right here is the most intelligent man I have ever come to meet. Rude, sure. Mostly because all of you are too small-minded to even appreciate such a talent.”
For the first time, John realizes he is not alone. He doesn’t have to go through this alone and he may not deserve this kind of attention from someone but by god it feels so damn good and he would be damned if he will ever let go of this feeling; comfort and affection, and from Sherlock of all people. His pale hand is rubbing gently up and down Johns back and his other hand rested on Johns thigh, running a thumb in soothing circles as he cooed and shushed John and kept whispering-
John examined his chicken scratch handwriting and smiled in satisfaction. Yes, that is perfect!
"They wouldn't be on your military maps considering this island doesn't exist."
"You still want those answers?" John asked.
New plan needed.
Sherlock waved him off like it’s no big deal. “Nothing of significance.”
“Goodnight John.” Sherlock responded, staring after him until he disappeared in the hallway.
When he pulls away and holds me at arms length, he looks me over once before peering over my shoulder at John who I can imagine is frowning at the scene.
"That's not a no. Good, I can work with that. I will need you to follow my lead."
John never found out why the letters stopped, why that day, and why that message. All he knew was that he was relieved, and he smiled at his and Sherlocks photos the following night.
I try not to grin at his obvious distaste at the words and decide to have a little fun. "While I'm flattered by your interest, John, relationships aren't really my area."
The rest of the year continued the same way. John and Sherlock met in the library every lunch hour and slowly began to talk together in Chemistry. At some point, John couldn't recollect when exactly, they exchanged phone numbers. Come the end of the school year, the two of them promised to keep in touch and continue their get-togethers, even if it wasn't in a library or a classroom.
John’s heart leapt out of his chest. He stared at Sherlock, his hair is rumpled all over from being in the hospital, his skin more pale than usual, eyes heavy from the effort of staying awake to talk to John. The Doctor inside of him said he needs to rest, but the best friend in him said he needs to do what he told him to do.
"Yes," John confirms. "Although, I didn't know that at the time. No one really knows what happened after he left port. Some say his ship sunk, that he was ambushed, or shipwrecked. Whatever it was, it meant he wasn't coming back. That's when I finally understood what he meant: 'take care of your sister because I can't.'"
“Easy John. It’s what I do for a living.” Sherlock leaned back against his pillow and sighed.
John peeked up through his eyelashes at Sherlock and noticed a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, or perhaps John is seeing things because in the next instant Sherlock is speaking with a neutral expression.
he is, just where I expected to find him. "Well clearly not John, and frankly if you did then pirates wouldn't have a place to go would they?"
“I think we're alright, tha-” John was refusing politely, but his mother had already went to the fridge and pulled out a pitcher of yellow liquid, ignoring his protests. John sighed and glanced at Sherlock, who was looking about the room curiously, with no hint that he was even paying attention.
This letter wasn't words typed on paper, this time, they were photos. The first photo was of him and Sherlock smiling together at a crime scene, both of them locked eyes with one another. Which means nothing. John was confused, maybe it was Moriartys way of saying he was watching them from the beginning. A form of power-play to let John know that no matter what he did, he wouldn't beat Moriarty.
John formulated a plan. He needed to know if that was his card Sherlock was holding dearly to himself. So, as nonchalant as possible, John was able to get into the lunch line behind Sherlock and gaze over his shoulder casually, as if seeing if the line were speeding up. He glanced down and saw Sherlock still inspecting it, that was when John noticed his own handwriting, and to his dismay, no name in the
"So, are you...?" John trails off with a scowl and nervous hand gestures.
John awoke to a noise that sounded suspiciously like a bomb going off, followed by the familiar groan of Sherlock filling the air.
For everyone that is not John, this is probably the most amusing; hell, John would find it amusing, if it weren’t him.
John hesitated, it is always difficult to walk in a hospital room to see Sherlock attached to the monitors and IV bags. But he needed to do this, for him. He put on his best indifferent doctors face and went in.
And sleep he did.
Sherlock didn't answer, instead he asked, “Another?”
With that, John turned in his seat and faced the front of the room, just as the teacher decided to join them. John felt relieved, he wasn't sure if he could handle Sherlock or the rest of the class responding with some snarky remark to him. News about this outburst is probably already spreading throughout the school. God, what has he done?
John shook his head. That is not the topic right now. Right now, John had something else on his mind. “Okay,” John sighed, looking Sherlock in the eye. “Now what?” He questioned him.
“John!” Sherlock exclaimed, pushing his way through to stand directly in front of him. “You wont believe this!”
“Do you have feelings for me?”
A rope snaps near the mass but I see John run to it and hold it down before the sail can get away from him. He barks out orders that I can't hear over a rumble of thunder and three men rush to his side to help. He tells them what to do, and then moves on to another group. Hmm. Where is Lestrade?
"I mean this island isn't written on your maps which is why people like
"Still don't trust me then." I commented.
Sherlock looked up and glared at the teacher, clearly about to speak some snide remark but John cut in before he had the chance.
“I’M NOT GAY!” John exclaimed.
John didn't want to think about it.
“A guest?” John and Sherlock spoke at the same time. John looked at Sherlock accusingly for eavesdropping but Sherlock was looking at Mrs. Hudson with his curious frown.
"Shut up," I muttered loudly enough for John to hear.
there.
He didn't respond. John turned and walked to the door, then stopped in the frame as another thought occurred to him, “Who is William?”
As I walked I let my fingers card through the fabrics hanging in the shop stalls we pass, and then let them dance over the wind chimes in the following stall. I stop at the next one that has books for sale and observe them until one catches my eye about chemistry. I pocket the hand-held size book and drop two silver coins on the table for the vendor.
an advantage. Look at what it is doing to you. Your judgement is clouded, you have eliminated the people that seem completely unlikely.” He paused, as if debating how to word his next sentence. “When we lose something, it is always the most unlikely place we find it.”
“How could you know that I know something you buried so deep that even
“I’ll leave you to it then.” Mrs. Hudson spoke and made her leave down the stairs. John, finally, turned to look at the girl. She smiled widely at him, exposing gleaming teeth.
I smile kindly, my suspicions correct. "When have you ever known me to suffer the fate of the gallows?"
“The second is Mycroft and Craig,”
John looks up when I put the fork down. "You're not already finished?"
“Honestly John, are you really so obtuse?” Sherlock looked at him with his blank stare.
, I think to myself, but John has proven time and time again that he is different from the average idiot so it shouldn't be much of a surprise.
"Who do you think I was with, John? You said you knew. How do you know?" My voice grew gravely. I moved to get closer to John, to intimidate him, but the helm held me back. My glare will have to do.
I would not have expected to have gotten out of here so easily. There are usually guards by the docks and given that two pirates were already seen there, more guards should be at the designated posting sites. But as I approached a ship and crossed onto it, John just behind me, I am finding the area abandoned yet again. Either these people are more idiotic than I anticipated or they will come at me again just as I am setting sail. The former is much more appreciated.
“John, don’t be so obtuse. Yes, people are idiots. So I hit one of them.”
John looked inside one of the house windows. Still no signs of life. Just an empty kitchen with a dry sink a stove turned off and a kettle sitting on top of it. Little puffs of steam coming out of it. The counter is clear except for a toaster and an almost full knife set. John sighed, they will get nowhere with this.
play, not that I couldn't.” Sherlock stated in the same tone of voice, but not without his usual hint of annoyance for John not being clever enough to catch on. John ignored it.
“There’s another bedroom upstairs, if you’ll be needing two bedrooms.”
“This entire time?” Sherlock whispered so only the two of them could hear.
“You’re easily irritated and uncomfortable with the two of them in the same room as us. Separately you’re perfectly alright, but together… Well, let’s just say you see them like a reflection of us.” John gaped at him and Sherlock cringed. “Not that I approve of you seeing Mycroft as my reflection, but given the circumstances I’ll forgive you.”
"You're still alive and I haven't run away. What do you think?" I responded sharply.
"How did you know he was housebreaking if you couldn't be in England?" John wonders.
I call over my shoulder, "watch me."
John opens his mouth to reply but stops short. He breaks eye contact, obviously not expecting such a brazen question.
Of all the times John has been accused of being gay with Sherlock, never has someone argued with such confidence and conviction. John refuses to count his sister because she lives to terrorize John, and she never says it in a serious tone (even though she is being serious). But this, this is so convincing even John isn't sure how to respond. It’s like she knows something that he doesn't. Those eyes are boring into him as if she is reading his very soul. But she is wrong, because if she could see so deep into John then she would know that he and Sherlock are not together, and never will be.
“How is he?” He asked.
Greg sighed and dropped the subject. He turned and looked at John and began talking about his latest problem with his soon-to-be-ex-wife.
“Well I’m flattered, sunshine-”
Sherlock turned to the keys and began another melody that John is not familiar with. But all the same, it is wonderful.
But soon enough, John was able to get Sherlock to dress himself and walk out the door.
“Why?” Sherlock asked.
“Stupid!” Sherlock suddenly scolded himself, his face set in a frown. “I should’ve known someone that fat would take their time walking this far into the park.”
“What? Who is it John?” Sherlock came around the counter, feet padding in the goo that is now covering the floor, and examined Johns face trying to deduce who this woman could be.
They stared down each other for a couple moments before Mycroft spoke in a surprisingly gentle voice.
Johns' eyebrows shot up, and he glances over at me. "Oh?"
is completely inadequate. But then he started speaking about you and that’s when I hit him.” Sherlock was out of breath when he stopped speaking and still wouldn't look at John.
“Right. Sorry just a bit surprised.” John said as she pulled away.
“It is not a scheme, Sherlock. It is, in some form, the truth. I thought it best if the family knew-”
John stared wide-eyed at his sister while Sherlock was smirking at the entire exchange. “Harry, I’m not gay. Sherlock and I are not together.”
“They also knew you were gay. There is nothing more telling than your family knowing something about you, even when you don’t. Consciously anyway. They did raise you.”
The last letter came on day one-hundred and three:
“I’ll make you that cuppa, you rest your leg.”
"It's
This was nowhere near the time Sherlock was hit on. John had convinced Sherlock to go to the pub with he and Greg after a long day, and finally closing a case that had taken them weeks. The three of them sat together in a corner booth and the bartender brought them beers. Sherlock, shockingly enough, downed his to less than half a glass while Greg and John sipped theirs and watched in surprise.
. But he didn’t expect it to be so traumatizing and painful. So damn painful. The guilt and loneliness ate away at him like a parasite. The, what John wants to label it as depression, made him careless and got him injured in battle; shot in the shoulder and for some reason made him limp. John never felt more useless and idiotic in all his life. How damaged he must be to come up with an injury in his mind and make it feel so real. Pathetic.
On the outside of course, he expresses nothing, like Sherlock. Although John knows Sherlock can feel, just like Sherlock knows the same of him. But John has reason for not expressing himself. Sherlock may have his reasons, or perhaps he just can’t help the way he is, but either way this is perhaps the first time Sherlock has ever seen John in such a state. John can see the shock and worry in his silver-blue eyes; he probably looks completely emotionless to anyone that isn’t John, or maybe Mycroft.
his friend.
A moment later a man in a lab coat walked in, the Doctor.
Sherlock stared at him with deducing and unreadable eyes for a long while. The silence expanding throughout the room and speaking volumes in Johns ears, Sherlock is starting to understand.
“I’m so sorry.” He said in a very masculine voice, and then looked up and suddenly froze, blue eyes growing wide. John stared at the guy and wondered if he knew Sherlock, but Sherlock looked completely confused and stared at him until the man spoke again, this time his features changed to something predatory. “Well, hello beautiful.”
“Dinner plans.” Sherlock stated, and got up from his chair to walk into the main room and put on his coat. “And now I am going out. It is really quite obvious, John.” Sherlock started wrapping the scarf around his neck.
The class got to talking enthusiastically to one another and John sat awkwardly while Sherlock appeared to be ignoring him. Then the worst had to happen, their teacher approached.
"Yeah," he says and stands with me to leave.
“Yes.” John said, almost going to ignore the nickname. Almost. “Don't call yourself that. You're not a freak.”
There was a beep and the gates rattled open. Sherlock led the way up the large driveway. It looked like walking through a path in a forest. Large oak trees lined the drive all the way up, and stopped once they reached the clearing where the driveway circled around a median of grass and grand water fountain. Beyond that they reached the steps of the extravagant white mansion.
"We got here on a stolen Navy ship," I tell him. "So unless you want-"
So when John started filling out his Valentines Day cards, it was no surprise that an idea came to mind regarding an intelligent, and incredibly rude, classmate of his. John subconsciously thought to give another act of his impetuous kindness, not to satisfy his mother or even himself; just because he can and would like very much to make the grumpy, young boy smile.
Now here is something worth my efforts: running for my life--though I'm always on the run for my life, this is a bit more literal.
Mycroft sighs but doesn't stand up, John is staring at him still confused about what is actually happening.
"We don't have time to waste. Have you met John?" I gestured to John beside me and then walked the gangplank up to the ship to let them get acquainted.
John scoffed. “Good deduction, that.”
Harry rolled her eyes. “And neither am I.” She smirked and held up her left hand exposing her wedding ring. “Clara kept saying the same, even after we were engaged.”
“I’m sure they know we’re here now.” John stated.
The detective lay flat on his back, hands on his chest and eyes staring at his tea mug. “I did expect it to turn out horribly, but I didn't expect that.”
No that won’t work. Perhaps a word or a phrase they both know? But what?
"Where are we?" John asks closely behind me, I can feel his body heat from his proximity and try not to get distracted. "I don't remember ever seeing this island on the military maps."
"He cleared my name!" Angelo exclaims with the most admiring expression on his face.
John reached into his pocket and withdrew a bundle of keys. "You don't know where Mycroft is then fine. Help me find him."
Sherlock frowned at the inquiry. “It’s quite obvious, John.” Sherlock stated to him.
"He was saying goodbye," I deduce easily.
John wandered through the towers of bookshelves to the far back corner where no one could see him. He found himself at a table in a corner between the floor-to-ceiling window and two mountainous bookshelves. John didn't notice the backpack leaning against the opposite chair until the owner came out, nose deep in a book. The man looked up suddenly when realizing someone had taken his place.
me down the street.”
“Something wrong?” The woman asked innocently and flipped her silky hair behind her shoulder.
John stiffened. His sister and this topic have always been a bit of a sore spot, especially after the few times she and Sherlock have met.
“Oh, John where ever did you find this one?” She looked at John giddily and John just smiled awkwardly, not quite sure what is happening. She turned back to Sherlock. “I made it myself, I’ll show you if you’d like?”
John didn't realize he was running to Sherlock until he was on the ground beside his friend, holding the bloody wound. He was vaguely aware of the Yard cuffing the man that stabbed his best friend, but he was too busy repeating his mantra of
“Okay you’ve made your point, Sherlock. Now what do you propose we do? Sneak in through a window? Kick in the barn door?”
John frowned. “What do you mean?”
It shouldn't have been a problem. John is always by Sherlocks side when these sorts of things arise. The medics in London don't mind when one of them rides in the ambulance together. Typically they don't allow it when the victim is not breathing, but Sherlock was breathing, John made sure of that.
John and Irene stared at each other wide-eyed. There is only one place John has ever heard that moan.
Then John had come to the realization that this must be what it’s like to truly like someone. The problem is, Sherlock never gave the slightest hint of being interested.
John froze packing up mid-way, and watched as Sherlock sat down across from him. John finally gained his sense of self. “What are you doing?”
Sherlocks chest did something he has only experienced a couple times before: John shirtless at the lake, their hands accidentally brushing together while they walk, John showing any sort of sadness and need to talk with someone. All of the feelings were different and this time is no exception. Sherlocks heart started beating rapidly and felt as though it beat up into his throat and down to his stomach. A smile spread on his lips. At first Sherlock never liked to feel any sort of feelings, but he found that feeling for John is okay.
I led John down the dock and over to another, his hands behind his back and my gun aimed at his head.
It stared in the first grade. Their teacher had assigned them a project that involved giving Valentines to each student in the classroom.
"I can get you out of here." He said.
this. I smile despite myself, and John, just for the briefest moment, smiles back.
John led Sherlock up to the front door and turned to him. “You ready?” Sherlock gave him a
“How did you know I’d come out?”
Every year on Valentines Day since the first grade, John has been giving Sherlock special Valentines he wrote, they weren't anything phenomenal but they were compliments that eventually started to put a noticeable smile on the boys face.
“Then there is your parents.” Sherlock smirked at this.
No positive answer. Need more data.
John nodded once. “Right then.” He crossed his arms over his chest and looked to his feet, contemplating his next words cautiously. “Would you, um, continue playing, for awhile?”
John struggled not to roll his eyes, and got out to follow Sherlock up to the farmhouse door.
John looked out at the ocean behind me. "I followed you."
I walk in the opposite direction, careful to keep to the shadows and keep my face to my feet. The last thing I need is a 'noble' civilian to recognize me and try to do the 'right thing'. I roll my eyes, that's happened more times than I care to admit but I'm rather proud to say that those wonderful civilians have made me better in the act of backhanding and I recently learned how to knock the person unconscious from it.
“Don’t be embarrassed, John. I rather like your family.”
Girls fell all over him, and though his hormone infected body was screaming to go for them, his mind and heart were not in it. They were focused elsewhere, especially come February fourteenth.
But if being selfish means he gets Sherlock, the man he is absolutely certain he loves, then so be it. John has always been selfless, thinking of others and taking care of them and curing them. But who has ever been there for
John follows, of course, with his exasperation evident, and more than likely suspecting he may not get his answer.
Johns' voice is low and serious. "I keep my word. Can you keep yours?"
It’s amazing really, the way Sherlock works, and the way John can work with him. Like magnets, the two of them move with each other, one moves and so does the other. Never drifting apart but never coming completely together.
I felt my eyebrows raise high enough that they could've touched my hairline, if that were even possible. Fascinating. This man is rather interesting. His determination, his fearless attitude. No, that look in his eye, he is a bit fearful. Fearful of me and my answer but confident and strong nonetheless, he needs to be strong for his sister. Being in armed forces teaches one to not show anything that can be used against you, in case one came across an enemy such as a pirate. Such as me. But little do they understand how much I can see and how little able they are to really mask how they feel. But this one, this John, does so well. It is more difficult to tell how he is feeling on the inside; I've never come across another person capable of masking their feelings so well. That is fascinating indeed.
John smiled again, I was tempted to smile back. What an odd sensation, I have no reason to smile at this man and here I am finding a strong desire to do so. Luckily I have self-control and remained scowling. After all, this man has found a way around my perfect eyesight and followed me to the one place no one should ever know about. That is very much worth being perturbed about.
John cleared his throat to get his mothers attention. She turned around and a large smile lit up her gentle face.
"So you followed me, and then what?" Another ridiculous question. He followed me and found my secrets.
She handed them both glasses of lemonade, breaking Sherlock from his thoughts to take it and thank her. Johns mother beamed, much like John did. Sherlock doesn't thank anyone.
Anywho, have a great night everyone! xo
“Speaking of,” Daniel smiled fondly. “Best get up there.”
“You’re not straight.” Sherlock deduced.
The cab pulled up to Baker Street and the two climbed the stairs silently. Sherlock went and laid down on the couch while John went and made tea, it was a habit the two of them picked up on almost every time they got back to the flat. This time though, it feels different. Both John and Sherlock feel utterly defeated in their own thoughts.
Harry lent her hand for Sherlock to shake. “It’s such a pleasure to finally meet you! I’ve been reading the blog, and Mrs. Hudson had been telling me all about you two.” She grinned.
John clenched his teeth and fisted his hand under the table.
“Sherlock-”
“‘Don’t do use anything that can contaminate the food, keep all body parts labeled and on their designated shelf in the fridge, never use the microwave under any circumstances, and, for the love of god Sherlock, do not use fire or make anything explode.’ Yes John, I remember your set rules about experiments.” Sherlock recounted the list exactly as John had recited them for the first time, but in a voice John would argue he sounds nothing like. Sherlock may beg to differ.
“John.” John said with a smile. “May I buy you a drink?”
Angelo leads us through the mellow restaurant to the corner booth against the windows. We sat, and he hands me a menu. I look up at him quizzically, I never need a menu.
Like hell if Sherlock is going to wake up with only Mycroft.
“Smells delicious, love.” Daniel said and kissed his wife on the cheek.
"So, you became a doctor because you want to heal people in a way you couldn't with your mother, but your father wanted you to watch after Harry, so what better way than to have all your currency sent to her by the military?"
"This man saved me from the gallows," Angelo informed John as he hands him his parchment menu.
Sherlock glared at him.
If seeing Sherlock Holmes attacked by his sister for a hug wasn't the funniest damn thing he has ever seen then he is a duck and Harry is straight. Sherlock tensed-up, frozen, and his facial features changed from shock to complete horror as he realized what is happening. Sherlock looked over to John pleadingly and John couldn't help the laugh that bubbled up from the pit of his stomach. John missed the glare that Sherlock shot him, though it was a bit half-hearted.
"Yes, John. You crave far too much adventure and danger for you to live a mundane life in
"What do you want?" One of the crewmen called out.
-navy and injured so I doubt you want to try to play intimidation with me. Now what do you want?"
He also tried his best to examine the handwriting of his classmates but to no avail, he eliminated females keeping in mind the handwriting looks a bit sloppier and smaller than a girls would. Though he still couldn't find this mystery man.
one of the hunts."
Eventually John found himself in front of the schools library and sighed. He supposes he can get some of his homework done, and if he finds a secluded enough corner, he can eat as well.
John didn't come up to me until our ship is surrounded by water and England is just a land mass behind us.
"You hungry?" I ignore his inquiry and start walking further into the dank town.
Sharp left turn and I'm crossing the street. Nobody gives me a second glance, just another lad making his way home for the night. Just a short walk down a dark alley and I'm at the docks. I can see it from here; all the beautiful ships and the reflection of the moon off the water. There's my home.
“HA! I KNEW IT!” Harry jumped up and down. “Oh the sexual tension between the two of you. Clara and I were the same way, still are actually.” Harry looked off in deep dramatic thought of her and Clara.
"And how's that?"
“You should get some rest-”
It took John all of 30 seconds to shake his confused thoughts. Sherlock is never nice, it is so out of character that John had to just shake his head and move on, he can question his flatmate later.
“Kiss me,” He said. “Kiss me now, John Watson.” He demanded.
Sherlock could never have been more appalled in his life. He actually had to go out and retrieve little candies and cards for each idiotic kid in his class and be kind about it. He nearly gaged, how tedious.
John is standing beside me again and looking at me strangely. "Why are you grinning?" He asks, unable to keep a smile off his own face.
“Why did you do that?”
"You're just now figuring that out?" John chuckles and pulls me with all his might back over the edge of the ship.
Sherlock frowned. “John.” He stated his name, much like he does when Sherlock is not quite following what John is saying or doing.
“Bees John!” Sherlock said excitedly, eyes positively glowing.
So the more John thinks about it, the more it makes sense that Sherlock agreed to come to the pub and is now finishing off his first beer.
At that, Sherlock smiled. "A topic for another day."
“Fine.” She turns to Sherlock. “How are the cases going ‘lockie?” She asks him.
Next thing I know, I'm back in a prison cell staring at the ceiling. Dull.
Sherlock ruffled his curls. Need more data.
John nods, obviously trying to work out how that case went down. Really, it was simple. The incompetent police didn't bother to check for reports of robberies in neighboring villages, so I send in a tip that perhaps they should, and therefore informed Angelo to confess to his real crime.
Lestrade sighed. "I'm afraid of what happened the last time we dealt with one of your
Lestrade scoffs, "famous last words," he mumbles.
“That’s correct.” John confirmed without a flinch.
John nodded right along with the Doctor as he explained Sherlocks predicament. He listened as he explained the medicines that he could have for pain, that he will need his rest and proper nutrients, and that he should be free to go by tomorrow morning.
"I said that I need your help." John spoke a bit more clearly and slightly more confidently but he wouldn't meet my gaze.
“Right. Well when was the last time you ate?” John tried again.
. "Now!" I hollered, and slowly all the men moved off of the ship and onto the dock. "Form a line in front of me." They did as they were told. I counted each of them to the number I had counted before approaching. They are all there. I mentally scoffed. This could not be any easier.
“You’re leaving?”
man came onto me,” Sherlock didn't bother to hide his cringe. “I simply stated we were sleeping together and whisked you down the street-”
“Who the hell knows about Sherlock Holmes,” John found himself saying, almost answering his own thoughts. And then as a side note, “But for the record, if any one out there still cares, I’m not actually gay.”
People are idiots, they deserve criticism.
Day seven:
“I already do.” Sherlock retorted.
. John thought to himself.
It wasn't until I was walking on the nearest dock that I noticed the people at the end of it. I froze and examined a bit closer, they're not Navy, they're regular people- tied up and in a line being led onto a ship. I walked a bit closer, keeping near the docks ledge and ducked under the gangplank of a ship next to the occupied one. Upon closer examination, I noticed Mycrofts first mate, Victor, leading the weeping and crying prisoners onto the ship, gun drawn and ready to fire if necessary. What could Mycroft possibly want such dull humans for?
John laid in his bed wide awake. It’s two in the morning and he is still stressing over what he did in Chemistry. He can’t help but feel that he has made a terrible mistake, granted Sherlock did need someone to stick up for him, but John knows the repercussions are going to be worse than the deed itself. The looks he started receiving after the event were horrendous, like he had turned into Sherlock Holmes himself. John also received text messages after school from some of his rugby friends asking things like
I blinked away from the horizon and into equally as stormy depths. Johns eyes are blue like the sea but hold as much ferocity as the oncoming storm and I know instantly that I would let Johns storm take me without a fight.
I look at him with a knowing glint in my eye. "The thrill of the chase, John! The game is
Lestrade meets my gaze warily. His pupils are blown wide from the rum consumption making them look darker than normal. "This better not be another one of your silly hunts-"
look, and as John stared at the photo, he felt three very distinct emotions. Pain, because this bastard is not only sending photos of his dead best friend, but also of better times. Anger, because this man is playing their friendship like it is some kind of joke. And sadness, because he has never longed for something so much in his life. He wanted nothing more than to go back in time and relive those moments again.
Harry turned around and gave him her ‘don’t lie to me’ stare that she had always given them since they were little. John almost backed away like he was a kid again, almost. “No point in hiding it now, Johnny. I know you better.”
"New crew. The old one is gone,"
He did as John told and took small drinks of the water. Once he was finished, he spoke. “Why?”
“Of course. Why wouldn’t I be?” Sherlock frowned at him, his eyes screaming that Greg is an idiot for asking such a thing. John shook his head and looked away; he’s long given up on properly communicating with Sherlock during this case. He has been more difficult than usual, probably because of the time it’s taken to find this killer; and that is not to mention that the killer was the most obvious and pulled a fast one on the yard and Sherlock. Neither parties were too thrilled about that, Sherlock appearing the most angry.
A large smile played on the man’s lips, revealing shining, white teeth.
"No you're right. Though, I'm surprised it took you so long to escape." Mycroft smiled in that condescending 'I'm much smarter than you' smile. I hate it.
Mrs. Hudson was so thrilled to see that Sherlock had found someone to move in with him, although John guessed it’s more that Sherlock found a friend than a flatmate. The woman is a sweetheart so it was difficult for John to be all that angry at her for mistaking them as a couple; but perhaps he was more surprised that someone even thought such a thing because he has never been seen as gay before.
"Funny time to suddenly not care about something." Mycroft called. I didn't respond and made my way onto the dock opposite, looking about for a ship reasonable enough to take with only one person manning it. Yes, it is very difficult and bordering impossible to sail your own ship, but there are rumors of another pirate, Moriarty, doing it when he needed to make a swift escape off an island, similar to what I'm doing now.
I stop walking in front of the pub I was looking for and turn to John who stares curiously up at me expecting an answer. I ignored his question again and instead look towards the entrance of the pub and say, "this should do," before walking inside.
"Keeps me swift."
It took John all of ten seconds after she was gone for him to actually process what had just happened.
“Hungry?” John asked and suddenly felt stupid for doing so, Sherlock is never hungry.
“He said ‘go run along to your pathetic rugby boyfriend and have yourself a nice shag. If you’re capable that is.’”
John leaned back with a quiet huff and focused on cutting into his chicken.
John looked from her to Sherlock and back again. “Uh- er- No. Just stop. Both of you. I don’t need to hear about yours and Claras sexual relationship and I most certainly don’t need to hear about mine and Sherlocks.” John grimaced at the thought of his sister sexually active. Eek.
John, on the other hand, is leaning against the window with the same words echoing in his head.
Come Valentines Day, Sherlock and John sat in Language Arts as the Valentines were passed out. Sherlock received his usual, John didn't get any this year, not a surprise considering his recent social status. Sherlock opened his eagerly, and read what was inside:
She cocked her head to one side and John would be damned if that wasn’t the most adorable thing he has ever seen. “Oh?” She says looking at Greg for the first time. “Hasn’t stopped anyone before.” She smirked mischievously.
Yes, an accomplishment indeed.
“Care to share more juicy details?” She pushes.
The most important one is Sherlock. John thought he was dead for years and it nearly ended John. He sat in the flat without moving for days on end and when he actually left the flat, it was to speak to a grave stone. To say John was broken is an understatement. He couldn't function, couldn't work, couldn't eat or sleep, sometimes he had to consciously remind himself to breathe. Sherlock had become his everything, and John was livid that he let himself grow so attached to the point where his life revolved around the man.
Once Sherlock, well, went away, Moriarty was gone as well but he left behind a trail that endlessly tormented John.
“So Mikey, how is work?” Earnest begins when she takes a sip of wine.
“What the hell happened? Who did this?” John is furious, it’s one thing to call them names but this is a whole other ballgame if it is becoming physical.
Twenty minutes in a silent cab later, they are parked outside a small and quaint looking home in a suburban neighborhood. John paid the cab fair and followed out Sherlock who started taking in his surroundings:
“Oh nonsense.” His mother commented and squeezed Sherlocks arm. “Would either of you like some lemonade? I’ve just about finished up lunch.”
The door swung open and there stood Mycroft, hands behind his back and no umbrella. “Brother, Doctor Watson, both right on time.” Mycroft gave a fake smile and turned to let them inside. Suddenly, John came to the realization that he too was requested to be here. How could Sherlocks parents know about him? Unless they are some part of the government like Mycroft? Or the blog. John would like to think it’s the latter.
“Wha- what the hell?” John looked at Greg. “I. Am. Not. Gay. Greg.” John enunciated each word sharply to him. “You just ruined what could have been a very satisfying and memorable night for me.”
“You’re smart, figure it out.” John countered and looked directly into his icy blue eyes.
A jolt of the ship breaks my gaze from John, making me slip and fall to the deck. A massive wave washes up on deck and I splutter for air against the water that is now dragging me to the edge. The ship tilts just enough for my body to slip over the edge with the current.
“You don't know?” John teased.
It is clear now that Moriarty went out of his way to make sure John knew that.
“Look at him dashing about.” She said and then looked at John with a knowing smile. “My husband was just the same, but you’re more the sitting down type, I can tell.”
I casually stroll down the alley, no pedestrians pay any attention and I smirk at their ignorance. What it must be like in their tiny little brains.
I lean over the table with my arms crossed on top of the counter and speak low. "John, it is important for you to remember that you are surrounded by pirates. Don't think for a second they won't spot an outsider if you give them a reason to."
John stared at me with calculating eyes. Probably trying to figure out the hell I know what I know but small minded people don't realize it is the simple act of observing that gives me everything I need. "How did you-"
It took a bit of effort, but eventually John made it further into the hospital without being detected. He took the elevator to the third floor, and searched the signs for which direction the rooms went. He found Sherlocks room soon enough, just before the nurses station.
John looked down and began to eat silently while working on some algebra homework.
Then my left wrist is caught by something. I look up and I'm lost in a pair of round blue eyes.
John knew with the first letter who they were coming from. He also knew Moriarty was dead. That left John to wonder what games have been played behind his back, and what game he was involved in with the letters.
“Is not!” John found his voice and glared heavily at his sister. “I’m. Not. Gay.”
“Sherlock-” John began.
"Are you still a pirate?"
"Then I still don't trust you." He continued, and I scowled then turned to pull my belt, holding my gun and sword, from the wall.
Like the first time, whenever they walk through the door, Angelo’s face lights up and he seats them at the table near the window (if it is open at that time) and insists on getting a candle because ‘it’s more romantic’.
“Why have I disappointed you? You had higher expectations of the Freak?” Sherlock questioned and actually looked confused.
“John I am perfectly capab-” Sherlock was cut off as the cup pressed to his lips.
Sherlock opened all his cards that were left on his desk, along with little pieces of candy, just as the rest of the class were doing. All of them said
). The man stared at John as he took the seat Mycroft pulled out for him, luckily or unluckily, it is in between Sherlock and Mycroft. Across from the three of them are people John doesn't recognize, distant relatives?
"I cleared it a bit."
During the rest of the class hour, John was wondering why he ever bothered all these years. Was he really putting his effort towards someone so cold and so bitter? He will accept compliments from the notes, but he won’t accept them from the source? John weighed his options now, he needs to stop, move on. Sherlock Holmes is a lost cause.
"Hang on, how do I know you won't run away once I open this door?"
Once the song ended, Sherlock was the first to speak. “You enjoy watching me.” It was a statement, like it usually is with Sherlock. He never has to question, he just knows.
“Yes.”
“Get. Out. Mycroft.” Sherlock doesn't even doubt that his fat brother already knows who it is. Sherlock needs to figure this out himself, even if he is pissed his brother figured it out first. Then again, he didn't use his mind to do so, just a couple clicks on his phone to get the information.
"John, will you give us a moment?" I don't turn around to see if he will agree, already knowing he will. It took a moment before I felt Johns presence move away, and that's when I checked behind me to see he's relocated to the bar.
Sherlock frowned. “I would think that would be obvious.”
"How did you know the reason I came to England?"
“I don’t understand.” Sherlock frowned, and John raised his eyebrows. It’s a rare occurrence when Sherlock doesn't understand something.
If John ever said this was similar to the time when he met Sherlocks family, that would mean he is either lying or being extremely subtle. The overall experience was the same, but with a few minor differences.
an argument with Sherlock.
“You as well.” Earnest says in a soft voice that sent shivers down Johns neck, definitely not in the way the woman seemed to intend.
"I didn't say I wasn't in England, just that I couldn't show my face."
"Mycroft is onto something this time. He took multiple civilians from England and is taking them to the caves right now." My patience is wearing thin, I need Lestrade to agree to sail with me again. He is the best first mate I've ever had and can gather a crew faster than I have ever seen before. I need him, or else there is little hope of catching up to Mycroft and more for the Navy to catch up to
figure out her math homework because she was ‘sick’. In which, Sherlock just couldn't resist stepping in with
“I could always test them for you.” Sherlock heard an annoying voice from his bedroom doorway. “I can also pull security cameras from the school to see who was at your locker.”
Perhaps he is telling the truth and thinks Sherlock is intelligent. There is only one other person in the school that thinks so…
Sherlock stared down at his Valentine. He seemed to have gotten the lottery this year. On his desk now sat a red rose and a small stuffed bear holding a heart. Beside it was a large chocolate bar with a note:
look.
Sorry for the lateness! I was focusing on school, but now I'm out so don't let me give you anymore excuses ;) The next one should be up shortly, hope you all enjoy!
"Thirty-one in total, not bad at all," I muttered more to myself than to the others.
John gaped at the man.
Outside, John watched Clara and Harry spin around on the swing, and found his father raking the falling leaves into a large orange and brown pile.
"That is rather exciting, isn't it?" I grinned manically. John stared and shook his head. He found the correct key and was about to insert it before he stopped.
“Don’t be ridiculous John.” Sherlock scoffed. “It’s not called a ‘mental trash bin’. Obviously, it is a recycle bin.”
"Judgment call? You held a gun to my head!" John exclaimed angrily.
locked.
John followed Sherlock down the dirt path towards the barn. It was a bit of a walk, but gave John the time to take-in his surroundings. He noticed the sun was starting to set, he noticed the maize held an orange-like glow to them, he noticed Sherlocks shadow turning from long to nothing as the sun disappeared below the horizon, he felt the light breeze on his skin and watched it ruffle the cornstalks. Given any other situation it may have been a lovely sight, but they are on a case, and the only thing he can focus on now is his partner before him and the barn they are quickly approaching.
“Of course not.” Sherlock scoffed. “We knock.” He stated simply and got out of the car.
It was sixth grade when things started to change. John discovered his passion for rugby and played for the school team. Luckily, that was when he hit puberty and was actually physically able to go after his passion. His height grew a bit taller than most of his peers, his body became more toned and strong, though that could be because of his rugby practices and working out frequently, his jaw sharpened and his blond hair grew long enough to flip out of the way. Least to say, John became the most popular and attractive kid in the school.
A moment later we order our food and wait for it to arrive.
“No visitors but close family at this time.” She said dully, like she is bored with constantly saying those words. John is certainly bored of hearing those words. If it were up to him, he would take those words and shove them right up-
John raised his eyebrows, waiting for Sherlock to share ‘the obvious’ with him.
"Why did you become a doctor?" I find myself asking, surprising myself more than John with the question.
“Is the happy couple bickering again?” Came another voice behind John, this time a few feet away. John turned around and saw Mycroft, Sherlock looked just as surprised to see him, as seeing he was too distracted by the grass under his feet. (That reaction alone is a surprise. Sherlock is always aware of what is happening around him). John’s sudden desire to draw Sherlock disappeared as he began to process what both Greg and Mycroft had said.
The two never actually spoke and in fact, they didn't even sit near each other. But John heard enough stories from his friends about the way this Sherlock Holmes treats the people around him, like they are utter idiots. This is not to mention the way he almost always ends up teaching the class. Sherlock tends to get ahead of the teacher in the lesson, answering questions before they're finished, jumping steps, and even lessons, ahead of everyone else.
He paid for a large heart-shaped peanut butter cup (hoping Sherlock likes Reese’s) and wrote a personal message on one of the plain paper cards, keeping sure to not write his name:
“Right then, lunch it is.” John waved a cab and the two of them got in, luckily Sherlock didn’t argue.
He dumped all his Valentines in his backpack but kept his special Valentine with him as they were dismissed for lunch.
That is until a very attractive woman around John’s age approached the table. She has dark hair, blue eyes and fair skin; it is an interesting combination that feels familiar to John. Maybe he knows her? Or not, perhaps John has had a bit too much to drink, then again he has only had two beers so that couldn’t be it—despite John beginning to feel the warm stirrings of tipsiness.
“Sorry?” John speaks first. He swore he could see Mycroft restrain a chuckle.
John smiles sadly. "My parents. My father was a Navy sergeant so he wasn't around much, but when he was, he was a perfect father to me and Harry, and perfect husband to my mum.
Come lunch, John went to his usual table to find it completely full. All conversation stopped and eyes focused on him. In Johns usual seat is a girl, Mary, Sebastians new found girlfriend who pointedly ignored him. John is best friends with the majority of this table, or so he thought, especially Mike who is giving him an apologetic look. John scowled at the table. “Alright fine I get it, I defend one person and suddenly I’m no longer aloud. I expected better of all of you.” John didn't bother to sound angry, just disappointed in them. It goes to show who his real friends are, he thought he knew them, he thought they knew
play, you didn't think it was me, so you came out.”
When the school day started to come to a close, John thought that maybe it’s for the best that Sherlock doesn't know who wrote it. For all John knows, it could result with him being at the end of one of Sherlocks rude rants about stupid people, and his observations about where said people came from and are going.
“Yes, I know that John.” Sherlock said, and looked away to play with his blanket like he is bored.
“Yes you do.” Sherlock argued.
He leaves us, and when he is out of hearing range John looks up at me.
Sherlock frowned. “Why?”
John stares at me, and then finally gives in and laughs. Confused, I watch him in his fit of giggles. His whole face is lit up with the action and he covers his mouth to keep from laughing too loudly. I find it oddly enduring, as it makes John look much younger and more relaxed, and I find myself unable to hold back a smile and chuckling along with him.
“Ten?”
John was at the corner in three steps and peered into the living space. Johns eyes widened at the man sitting at the piano playing the gentle music. Surely John should know better than to be surprised. But with all the surprises from the Holmes’ family, it wouldn't be shocking that some other relative is sitting up playing music in the middle of the night.
Sherlock turned and looked at him for the first time. His icy eyes raked over Johns body, deducing him. Finally Sherlock scoffed. “Right. A jock trying to compliment the school joke. Nice try, Watson.” Sherlock glared and turned away.
“But with who? And where are you going?” John was half tempted to get up and follow Sherlock, if only to get some sort of answer out of him. But this is Sherlock, John knows better than to expect answers.
Mycroft sighed and turned to face Sherlock, leaning on his umbrella heavily. “We have been summoned.” He states to Sherlock. “All…
John turned around to find Mycroft, and Greg closely behind.
John looked at him in pure shock. Leave it to Sherlock to not only get stabbed, but to also question it to be a ‘bit not good’.
tell you Captain Watson of the Royal Navy dedicated to slaughtering pirates and those associated with them.
I crinkle my nose at the image of John becoming a blacksmith, that's just so... normal. He would have never lasted.
"Is he gathering your old crew?"
frequent it often."
John was on it right away, saving the rope and sail from drawing us off course. Without any issues, John tied the rope back in place and went about double-checking the rest of the sails to ensure nothing else was going to break.
“Do you want to hear it or not?” Sherlock snapped. John shut his mouth. “Your utter need to repeatedly deny her comments about our relationship and your sexual orientation said it all. Any straight man would be comfortable enough with his sexuality that he could laugh it off. You, however, look like a teenage girl whose diary was stolen and read to the entire study body.”
The third photo is of John looking up at Sherlock. He is clearly lost in thought, mouth agape like he is in the process of giving a deduction. What really caught Johns eye, though, is himself. Much like photo two, he is giving Sherlock
“Er, yes Harry this is Sherlock. Sherlock, my sister Harry.” John introduced them, a bit awkwardly if he had to say so himself.
It was a murder of someone in the British Government, it is meant to remain ‘hush-hush’ but the Yard is having trouble finding the culprit, ‘as usual’, though Greg blames it on not being able to inform his entire team.
Angelo comes back and lights the candle for us. It's not necessary as we are against the window but if it appeases the man then so be it.
Sherlock then came up with an idea in that moment and thought that it was completely
John will fix this.
“Obviously.” Sherlock stated, annoyed. “But usually you deny having any sort of romantic relationship with me.”
“Actually there is no difference.” Sherlock started. John held his breath. “Something you talk about with a stranger can easily be the same thing you talk about with someone you know.”
“No, Mrs. Hudson did. I simply went along.”
That got Sherlock’s attention, Johns as well, both for two different reasons. “What?” John breaks the silence with a frown at Mycroft, and suddenly he is watching a stare down between both brothers. Sherlock’s features are unwavering, and so are Mycroft’s. It's almost as if they are having a conversation in their minds, John wouldn’t be surprised if they were. Sherlock’s features started to morph into something else, something looking along the lines of pleading, and then defeat. Sherlock slumped in his seat and looked away. Mycroft stood proudly and flicked his umbrella up and onto his shoulder. “I’ll see you both at the Manor tomorrow night, six o’clock sharp. Do not be late,” Mycroft dropped his voice low and ominous, “You know how she gets.” And with that Mycroft left. Sherlock and John said nothing until the front door opened and closed.
“Why?” John questioned him.
lovely-"
“Sweetie, what on earth do you mean?” Johns mom spoke gently beside him.
“Small sips.” He instructed as he brought the cup to his mouth.
“Harry-”
He notices this and frowns at me with a slight amusement. "What is it?"
"Feel what?" He finally asks.
Sherlock’s glare deepened. “And he is the best fuck I have ever had.” Johns eyes widened in shock, and Sherlock smiled deviously.
Stamford stared at me. "You're lying."
“I wasn’t talking about you.” Sherlock turned to him and glared, making a show of taking Johns hand in the process.
John chokes on air, and I wave over the barkeep to bring water. John takes a drink the moment the glass is placed in front of him.
“Sherlock-”
“Er, sorry?” John questioned, clearly confused.
A few snickers filled the classroom. It is just before class and their teacher is running late. Sally was going
“What isn't there to understand? I told a little lie to get in here.” John tried to shrug it off.
"Sherlock!" Someone yells, it's hard to tell who. I manage to grab hold of the ship's railing but it's slippery and I feel my fingers sliding against the wood.
“Sherlock-”
“Are you going to sleep?” John wondered and immediately scolded himself for asking such question.
He hardly heard her as she spoke. “There. ‘I’m not dead. Let’s have dinner.’” She made an act of pushing send. John pressed his lips into a fine line, still bent out of shape over her conviction of his sexuality, and utter inability to care about Sherlocks feelings for her. How could she even do this to him? John knows Sherlock, he will act his part of indifference but it is so clear he is anything but. If her ‘death’ didn't crush him enough, this certainly will. She is not playing fair, it is one thing to mess with Sherlocks mind, but his heart?
The night goes as it normally does. Sherlock and John talk about everything there is to know and absolutely nothing all at once, because this is Sherlock and he can tell you about the world or simply say nothing, and John will know he is just deducing the couple next to their table.
John would never think of the two of them in this way, John sees them as close friends and nothing more. Close friends who happen to live together, bicker like a married couple, have joint bank accounts, work together, and save each other in more ways than one.
"Who I suspect is
"What do you mean it doesn't exist?"
“J-John.” Sherlock tried to speak. John suddenly realized he was screaming for a medic, and noticed some were running towards him with a gurney. Sherlock grabbed at Johns red soaked hands to get his full attention. “Bit n-not good?” He asked, a drop of blood spilled from the side of his lip.
"You could've clued me in," John stated with a scowl.
It's dark; the moon is shining full in the clear night sky, casting shadows off the stone buildings and igniting the air with enough light to see but little enough to be able to hide within the shadows. I stopped in a narrow and dark alley, watching as a group of navy soldiers run past it, commanding orders to split up and call for back up.
Oh Watson, ever the mindlessly curious one.
Once everyone was seated, Harry was the first to grab at food, followed steadily by the rest of the table. Everyones plates held hefty amounts of food except for Sherlocks, which held a roll and some green beans.
John stared at her for a long moment trying to put her words together and figure out what women he has been in contact with recently that is stubbornly pushy… when it suddenly clicked. Johns face turned gravely. “Oh no.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Please John, don’t be like them, I know you're smarter than that.”
It started out as a normal day, well as normal as it can be when living with Sherlock Holmes.
John jumped a bit in place and looked over his shoulder at me. "I didn't say anything."
"Your brother took my sister and I need to get her back." He said smoothly.
"Onto land John," I say and begin disembarking the ship. I can feel John follow closely, and almost hear his concerned thoughts wanting to ask if I'm alright, but my swift movements must be enough for him to let the question die on his tongue for he never asks.
“So is this the famous Sherlock Holmes?” Harry turned to Sherlock who had been watching the two intently.
John smirked playfully. “Who says I'm not going to tell you to shut it?”
“Pleasure to meet you all.” John smiles kindly at them, Earnest looks at him with a cock of her head, brown hair falling around her face and a grin exposing straight teeth. She isn't dressed as nearly as pristine as the Holmes elders, and neither is her brother Eugene who only glares at John, their hair seems to be the only resemblance of the two. Uncle Frederick examines him like Sherlock does a bacteria, his eyes are scrutinizing and his lips in a firm line.
“That’s my Lydia, she makes only the best in the kitchen with the most pure ingredients.” Johns father said, taking Sherlocks intense attention from John to his father. “I’m Daniel, by the way. You must be the famous Sherlock Holmes.” Daniel extended his hand to Sherlock who took it and smiled politely.
“Dad?” John called, walking down the steps to his father. The older man looked up and grinned.
"Really, brother dear, you're just going to stroll out like this?" I stopped in my tracks, I'm halfway down the alley and that voice, oh that voice, stops me. I'm
John debated how to respond to Sherlocks deduction. He could just walk away, go back to his bedroom and forget about the entire evening; he could make something up, like his secret ambition to learn the piano. Or he could go for the truth.
John looked away and quickly wiped his wet cheeks. “Sorry.” He mumbled and slumped down further in his seat. There is no way he can stand looking at Sherlock right now; he doesn’t deserve even the slightest hint of sympathy, especially from someone as amazing as Sherlock.
Then it hit him like a truck going sixty-five. John grinned. This will work perfectly.
Sherlock searched for a name on the card, and then grew frantic… Why can’t he find it? Why is it not written?
, someone has been slumming it.
“Why would it be a bad time?” John shifted uncomfortably, knowing what he will answer but not going to stand down from this oncoming argument.
“In front of Sherlock?” Greg scolded John, and John only began to grow even more confused. Greg sighed in exasperation and turned to the woman. “Sorry sweetheart he is taken.”
"Obviously. And you are?"
John greeted Clara with a much more tame hug and a moment later, John introduced the woman to Sherlock as Clara, Harrys wife.
"Shut up." I snapped as I led him down the dock and pulled out my pistol, John tried to stop walking at the sight of it. "Interlace your fingers behind your back," I demanded in his ear. John tried to protest but I tightened my hold on him and snapped, "just
By the time Lestrade noticed me I was standing at the table before him. He held a pint in one hand and had another discarded on the dirty table. He looked up at me, tipsy as all hell, but still able to recognize me nonetheless.
February fifteenth, Sherlock walked the halls to his locker. He is late to his first class, but what else is expected of him right now? Something happened to his admirer and there is nothing he can do about it.
“I said out!” Sherlock nearly yelled and looked at his nuisance of a brother. Mycroft looked unfazed, which is no surprise.
“Mr. Watson and Mr. Holmes, a problem?”
Yes, Sherlock definitely deduced John but it’s not like this side of him was being kept much of a secret anyway. Even if he wanted to hide it he couldn’t. Sherlock is usually the one waking him from his nightmares, and he uses his laptop which is where John keeps all his personal word documents that his current therapist makes him write regarding his
John put his face into his hands. He is never going to win this battle. At this point, John is wondering if there is something about his physical appearance that screams gay because this is just getting absolutely ridiculous.
“You don't need to explain that one.” John said, looking uncomfortable. Sherlock watched him with his calculating eyes and then nodded. John relaxed. It has been hard enough constantly denying it with his sister, to hear it said out loud now that he was wrong each time she's announced it to the world, to know that his sister knew something about himself that John didn't even know… well it is a bit troublesome.
John settled on being blunt, considering he can’t think properly for this, and there is a minor amount of space available.
His father pulled away and gave him a good slap to the shoulder. “How have you been, son?”
“Geez, don’t get too excited to see me.” She said and walked over to hug him.
“How?”
John was about to defend himself. He was going to tell Sherlock he had no idea his parents were such uptight assholes, that he didn't know Sherlocks sexuality, and that his parents made it clear that he needs to marry a woman.
“John.” That is one voice that John could recognize anywhere, and he couldn't help but freeze in place on the sidewalk. His heart doing the exact opposite by leaping in his chest. “John.” Sherlock said again when he didn't turn around.
I turned to the voice that had said my name. On the other side of the cell bars, stood a man, average height, blond hair, wide blue eyes. He holds himself strong and steady, shoulders back, and hands firmly at their sides. Military, and judging by the tan he is with the Royal Navy, but no, not anymore, he is dressed too casually. Injury perhaps, but nothing visible. He still has all his limbs attached so it had to be a gunshot somewhere on his torso.
“Well of course we’ll be needing two.” John said with a confused frown.
"Have to?" John scoffed.
John wasn't sure how much time had passed, he didn't care, he was kissing Sherlock Holmes. A man that tastes of cinnamon and vanilla, a smell that is so very posh and so very Sherlock all at once. John felt like he was soaring.
Sherlock says nothing and takes a large gulp of his wine. John can’t help but notice that Sherlock hasn't even touched his food, not that Sherlock ever does. Although every meal that seems to pass, John can’t help his concern for his flatmate.
“How about you tell them about you and Lestrade.” Sherlock says and the room goes quiet once more, Mycroft paled immediately.
"How badly so you want to save your sister, John?" I cocked my head to one side and read the features on his face. Apprehension, anxious, desperate, curious.
"We are indebted to each other and he doesn't know where we are. He is not a threat to us." Even as I say it I know it's true despite the terms we met on and reluctantly agreed to trust each other with. "And it's not like you weren't once apart of the Navy," I remind him pointedly.
“It is all perfectly under control.” Sherlock cut off John.
"Quiet. Timing is everything." I muttered and continued to watch the process on the ship two down from us.
Obviously new, and completely terrified. "The rest of you, if I see any movement before we are out of eyeshot, Watson dies. Understood?"
"Oh now you're just trying to make me look more impressive." I smirked, picturing the guards' faces as they come to retrieve me and find the cell empty
Now, anything in regards to Moriarty John noticeably dismisses the subject altogether for more than just one reason.
“Sherlock Hol-”
John bit his lip, as much as he would like to be here with Sherlock, he really shouldn't risk being seen with him right now. He can’t ruin his life more so than he already has.
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson. You may leave now.” Sherlock spoke in annoyance, waving her off, and went about searching for something in the black goo.
John dropped back down to his normal size and scowled at his idiocy. How could he forget to sign his name on the most important card he gave?
"And how do you propose to do that with no crew?"
“How is that the truth?” John buts in. “I’m not gay.” John states with anger, standing up himself.
“No problem, sir.” John smiled. “We- uh- already know each other.” He supposes that’s true. He could see Sherlock look at him from the corner of his eye.
The three men ran off the ship with statements that the preparations are made and the ship is ready to go.
John was at my side when the sun had fully risen from its hibernation. He looked over the edge at the water, his face set in a frown, eyes distant. Lost in deep thought then.
"I wasn't-"
Suddenly John is hit with the revelation that this is where Sherlock had disappeared to yesterday. Somehow he is not surprised that Sherlock knows his sizes, because this is Sherlock and he can deduce your clothing size from just one glance. John is more surprised, however, that Sherlock had given in to his brother to attend this event.
Greg eyed him nervously like he crossed a line, Mycroft on the other hand couldn’t give two damns. “You two seem like you’ve already broken up.” He stated smugly.
John looked away, feeling like he may have made a mistake bringing it up. He could only imagine what it was like for Sherlock and Mycroft growing up. He saw two children surrounded by everything they ever wanted… except their parents. John imagined they had a different nanny every week, that their parents promised to be home occasionally but ‘something came up’. He could picture them growing colder as the years went on, and more intelligent based on all the home schooling and tutors they had.
