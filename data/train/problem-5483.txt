“Oh,” she says with a soft smile that Sam wants to kiss into oblivion.
He stumbles back into the motel and finds it dimly lit. A familiar face looks up at him from a magazine, from the single bed in the room.
“What if you carried me to the garage. Put me under the car. I could keep working on her and wouldn’t need to move,” Dean reasons. It’s the perfect ploy.
Dean frowns. He doesn’t know what to say to that.
He takes a look back at the neon lights that flash through the windows and then down at the number he’s typed into the cell phone in his hands. He hesitates for a moment, but he looks next to him, at the empty space that should be occupied. The phone rings as he brings it up to his ear, looking away.
They walk down the side of the road together. She talks to him about her family, her real family, not the vampire nest that was going to kill her. And Dean listens. She already knows he isn’t one for words, so she’s happy to fill the silence. She is, after all, a child. Dean is grateful for the timbre of her voice. It’s enough of a distraction from the thoughts he holds at bay that he can focus on how, yes, her real mother was an absolute bitch. Why shouldn’t Emily have gone out with her friends on her birthday?
“Sorry, chica,” Dean cuts in from behind, “promise I’ll take care of him. Bring him back safe by the end of the week.”
has to be on Dean’s side.
Dean’s body relaxes. And his breathing is shallow, but, through what Castiel can only call a miracle, Dean’s eyes flutter open. He doesn’t speak, but his eyes are his own. It fuels the sliver of hope that Castiel had been holding onto.
baby. Sam doesn’t have the same attachments.
dean actually cries, but he turns around so that sam can’t see it. he composes himself in a second and turns back. he doesn’t have it in him to fight sam on the emotional distress this is causing him. instead he says, “thanks, sam. i’m glad i got to be your big brother, too.”
Dean picks up his bag from the ground beside the desk he sits at and makes a beeline for the door. The professor doesn’t say a thing, nobody does. He loves college sometimes.
“Dean Winchester,” comes an icy voice from behind him.
“Take care of your brother,” he says, “there’s something in him. Something I should have been able to catch. You might have to kill him,” John says as if it were the simplest thing in the world.
“Winchester!” his coach, a middle aged man who Dean has never seen outside of the field, screams from across the field. The man has a voice that shouldn’t be that loud, Dean thinks.
Their father was a monster. There really was no sugar coating that, not anymore. Dean loved the man more than he’d ever loved anything. But, that didn’t change the reality of it. Sam has no memories of going without eating, because Dean never allowed it. Sam has no recollection of the time Dean tried standing up to their father. Sam had been at school, 17 at the time, and Dean had had enough of their father’s patronizing. It was the most scared Dean has ever felt in his life, and he’s had his soul scraped raw by demons in hell.
The machete comes from its holster in a flash and Dean buries it into the man’s torso through brute force. The girl screams and the man staggers back before Dean gets a chance to pull it out of him. Dean watches the man fall onto his back, convulsing slightly from the damage a blade that large has done to his insides. Dean pulls it out and jams it through once more for good measure and reholsters it bloody. He takes a look around, expecting the girl to come and collect what he promised her. He gives it a moment, but when she’s nowhere to be seen. He looks up.
Sam’s observation sends a chill up and down Dean’s spine. But, still he can’t really dwell on that right now. He steps into Cas’ room and finds the guy sitting at the desk, his face buried in some textbook.
He reaches halfway down the alley and frowns. The girl just disappeared. When he turns around, he nearly bumps into her.
Dean doesn’t respond to him. His glare remains intense.
His coach nods understandingly. He reaches over and pats Dean on the back and says, “if you miss next week your ass is on the curb.”
And Dean doesn’t feel a thing.
He snaps the phone shut and looks up at the stars, there are none. He’s too close to the city. There’s a pang in his heart. He knows what it is, it’s grief. The loss of his mother, his brother, and his father. But, he’s not going to think about that right now. Not unless he—
“On it, boss,” Dean says with another grin that’s meant to be inciting. It doesn’t get anything out of Cas. Dean looks back at the pink box he’d brought with him and adds, “you can keep those.”
He also goes to prison. That’s fun. No, really. It is. He goes to a
Castiel blinks and misses the quirking up of Dean’s mouth in between bites.
after a few moments of getting caught up with everyone, sam sits him down at the table where the cake is. dean rubs his hands, ready to light the candle in it when sam makes this “uh-uh” sound. dean looks up at him in confusion when eileen brings over a pie with those large novelty number candles set into it. 42 sure was a year.
“No mames, Dea-” the knee presses further into Sam’s gut before he can finish. He groans and she climbs off of him.
Sam wants answers, Mary wants answers, Castiel wants answers, but Dean was essentially comatose. He had been for the past two weeks, since the moment he stopped screaming. They had no idea if and when he was ever going to wake up.
“Okay,” Jack says with a little nod, “I’ll see you later, Mister Dean!”
And he tenses, because it’s out of his mouth already. He could double down or he could ask Bobby to forget it ever happened, but that would ensue weird looks. He can’t handle that. He has to know if Bobby would still care for him. He lived in the doubt long enough. If Bobby hates him for this, then Bobby hates him for this.
they sit in silence for a while. and sam’s phone vibrates. dean watches him check it and not respond. trouble in paradise? he doubts it, but he doesn’t really know every single thing about sam anymore.
“I’m not gonna hurt you, darlin’. I just wanna meet your boss,” Dean feels her tugging get frantic when he finishes.
“Here,” Sam fishes out the key by the little Mexican hat keychain that John put on it. “Take it. I know you love her more than I do.”
Sam says with a disappointed breath. And yes, Dean is the worst. Sam hopes he knows this. “It never occurred to you to maybe, I don’t know,
Cas nods, walking towards the other end of the alley. They shouldn’t hang out in the area, obviously. Dean was just a little rusty.
Of course things went to shit, Sam figured that much. Sam’s expression softens as he watches Dean look down and his jaw tighten. Sam waits, he knows how this story ends. A long moment later, Dean looks up, his eyes glossy.
“You’ve been gone for almost two weeks, Dean,” Mary adds. She steps over, so she’s standing beside Sam rather than behind him. Her face mirrors Sam’s concern. “We’re worried.”
After he slips it on, he steps outside and wordlessly finds his boots. He grabs the set of keys, rather the weird plastic square needed to turn the car he had outside on, and he’s out the door.
he sees jody, donna, alex, claire and kaia. sam and bobby among several other hunters dean had come to know. it’s a full house, yet dean notices the lack of jack and cas. there’s a stack of presents in a corner behind the kitchen, a cake with a single candle on the table. claire is approaching him with a party hat in her hands and an evil look on her face. dean glances over at eileen, who’s beaming at him. she knows what she did. led zeppelin comes through a little speaker in the corner, not too loud, but loud enough that its ambiance music now.
Behind him, Sam laughs.
Dean sighs, “alright. Well, you left, and we kept looking for the thing that killed mom. Turns out, it’s a yellow eyed demon. We caught up with it and… we had it on the ropes. We were so fucking close…
A shock goes up his spine at the question and his answer slips out of his mouth before he can stop it, “
When he makes it there. Mary is the one that gives him a warm look. She’s trying to mother both him and Sam. Her expression is confused for a moment before she reaches and pulls Castiel’s phone from his pocket, pausing the music for him. Castiel takes the phone back from her and takes a seat at the table across from her. Jack is very focused colouring in a book beside her.
dean lets himself get wrapped in a hug from claire and then lets her put the hat on him before sam approaches him.
“Dean?” Sam asks after a few seconds. His tone is soft. The digital watch on Dean’s arm reads 3:57 AM and the road is pitch black around them.
It’s all sensations, all instinctive motions where Dean’s too busy trying to catch up with the feeling of euphoria that seeps through every inch of his body that he doesn’t notice when he’s put onto his back. He arches enough for the demon to slide his jeans off from under him and Dean makes a sound of pleasure when he feels hot skin on his own. A hot mouth presses down to kiss him and Dean graciously kisses back.
“No empieces,” Dean says, annoyance in his tone.
“I’m in love,” Dean breathes out again, forgetting that he’d already answered.
and that’s what he thinks about when he’s sitting across from cas at the baskin robbins. that they’re safe. that things are okay. because they are, dean’s earned that much through his own tears and blood.
The vast nothing of the empty was something that continued to haunt Castiel. It appears around him when he least expects it. He could be sitting down with Sam for a conversation about Sam’s interest in helping people and Castiel will see the edges of the room sink into black. He’ll step through the door of the bunker and he’ll step into the pitch black. A laugh using his own voice will ring through his head and Castiel has to reconcile the fact that everything has been a hallucination and he’s never really left the empty. And then it’ll all come back.
Dean turns around to look at Him, eyes blackened over and wide. There’s no emotion in them, no heart. But, he feels it, he feels the desire, the want. He watches as God steps forward, a grin of excitement on his face as He reaches forward to take Dean’s face into His hands. God’s grin gets bigger and He brings Dean’s head down so He can press His forehead against Dean’s. Dean’s breathing quickens.
He comes to a final stop at an empty gas station. He doesn’t need gas, but he doesn’t know where else to go. He goes around to the backside, where there are two doors leading to restrooms, but he doesn’t go inside either. He steps closer to the doors and jerks away, back to the car.
It makes him laugh, kind of, at the childhood he’s had. He’s into cars, is decent with a wrench, listens to 70’s metal exclusively, and his favourite pastime, currently, is slicing into an oncoming ghost with an iron crowbar. John’s proud. John’s said as much.
He’s young, very young, but he’s working a graveyard shift, so he has to be at least eighteen. He leans over the correct door and gestures to the other.
and dean thinks, as he drives over. that it’s his birthday tomorrow. well- he checks his phone, it’s basically his birthday. sunday january 24th, 2021. he didn’t think he’d live this long. he was the answer to the universe now, technically. 42. he looks down at his hands on the wheel. they’re worn. they’re the hands of a tired man who fought multiple apocalypses, multiple archangels, god himself. and won.
“That is not an option either?” Castiel turns to look over at Dean. Dean can only look up at him with his apologetic sunken eyes.
“I get that, I really do, but could you do me this really really big solid. Man, I’d owe you one,” Dean leans forward a bit, giving the guy a better look at his eyes, the freckles that dot his face.
When he brushes his teeth in the morning, he focuses on the edges of his face, they’re not delicate anymore. When he finally begins to feel comfortable enough to exist in his own skin, he takes to wearing his father’s leather jacket. It’s the only thing, besides the impala, that Dean has to remember him by. His childhood haunts him, but, doesn’t hate his father, although sometimes Dean thinks he should. He doesn’t think about John often. Not unless he has to.
Dean looks up at Castiel. He makes eye contact with Dean for several seconds before Dean looks back at Sam and his hands give them the answers they’ve been looking for.
When Dean is ready, he continues, “he sold his soul for me. Got dragged down to hell and so, I’m here. Sano y salvo.”
When Dean feels a slick hand trace a pattern up his thigh, he goes slack against the pressures that follow. His mouth hangs open and he finds peace in the patterns his exalted vision creates in the ceiling as the demon rocks against him. The warmth that pools in Dean’s stomach threatens to burn his insides. The excess warmth spreads through his entire body, making Dean’s vision blackout in waves. He pants, unaware of the soft noises coming from his throat.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” she stammers. “I- I told him to let me go.”
“You want a handjob?” she asks, eyebrows raised in a question. Dean’s lips twitch down in an exaggerated expression, implying he’s game.
“Oh,” she says, looking back at the screen, “
“I love you,” Dean responds, opening his eyes. He drinks in the sight of his angel. Castiel watches him, a glint in his eyes that makes Dean’s heart swell and a smile on his face that makes Dean want to kiss him.
He drives back to the house he’d seen the blue Nissan park at and parks a ways away down the street. From there it’s managing to sneak around the house and put himself in a position where he can hear what’s going on inside the house. He doesn’t need to do much. His head rests besides the windowsill and he overhears enough.
Castiel moves to sit where Sam had been and moves in even closer. Dean stares at him, pain in his eyes that Castiel knows is tearing him apart from the inside. Castiel reaches forward and attempts to take the side of Dean’s face in his hands. Dean flinches at the touch and Castiel jerks back. He’s unsure of what to do.
He wakes up at dawn. Emily is motionless on her bed, fast asleep as Dean steps into the bathroom for a quick final shower. He towels his hair and gets dressed just as quickly. He ties the shoelaces of his boots and looks over to the lump in her bed. Something twitches inside of him and he’s not entirely sure he recognizes the feeling anymore.
Sam spins around, then. Dean goes off— when Sam had left he wasn’t even
Dean shuffles around, realizing he’s cornered himself and he sighs. He confesses, “my brother would have been eighteen yesterday. I had to have a drink for him.”
Dean smiles up at him. It’s warm, but doesn’t reach his eyes.
Dean makes a noise loud enough to count as a response. He runs a disgustingly sensitive, pruny hand over his face. He’s still tired, very tired, but not as debilitated as he had been when he woke up. He grips the side of the tub and with a lot more valor than he had the first time, he hoists himself into a sitting position. He grabs the bottle of shampoo he’d been using and gives himself an awkward wash. It stings to touch his own skin, but he’s already in the fucking water. He may as well go through with it all.
They’ve been exchanging that smile for months and it’s mostly for fun, Dean thinks. He’s never seen Anna really smile at anyone that wasn’t another woman. She smiles at Dean in the way he’d want to be smiled at, he’s pretty sure. He’d never make a move on her anyway. She was too close to him. He’d hate to lose a shoulder to lean on during linguistics tests.
Her expression brightens and she slips her gloves off, wiping sweat from her forehead as she says, “that’s good. I can’t even imagine—” she stops herself. Her expression reveals she is unsure of how to finish that sentence.
He’s not dressed and has no intent to play today, but he’d like to see the guys. And girl. They had a girl on the team.
Castiel stands there, feeling the way he did when he’d stood at the doorway of the motel. He feels the same distant feeling, except this time it doesn’t come from the whiplash of not understanding he wasn’t in the empty anymore. This time it comes from the understanding of everything. Dean did everything he did for love. And not just the love that Castiel knows that Dean carries with him like a badge of honour. He did it for love of
dean huffs a laugh and nods, “go fix that.”
Dean doesn’t respond to them. He stares forward at Castiel. His expression is unreadable and there’s a sadness in his eyes that Castiel only ever recalls seeing in the aftermath of Dean losing his brother.
“eileen? is everything-” dean starts to ask when the lights flick on, blinding dean for a second before it clicks that it’s a party. it’s a party at midnight for him.
Sam had more of a childhood than Dean ever did and Sam hardly had a childhood at all. Dean watches as two little girls chase each other. One is taller, probably older and Dean can tell that she’s purposefully only swiping at the younger one’s back, not quite grabbing her, just to get a giggle and a reaction out of the littler one. It’s the kind of thing older siblings did. Only, in Dean’s case, it was taking the brunt of, well, everything Dean possibly could.
“no, actually. i wanted to do it tomorrow morning. show up at the bunker with everyone, but, i know someone with worse intentions than me who said that tricking you into coming here at the moment of your birthday would be something you couldn’t see coming,” sam opens his arms and dean lets himself fall in. he hugs his little brother back and the emotions from earlier come back. he and sam were alive. dean’s greatest achievement in life was keeping sam alive and now here he was, reaping the benefits.
“Why was there a demon at UC Riverside?” Dean says with a frown. What the hell could a demon do for college kids?
“Okay, alright,” the demon holds up his hands, “I get it. No-talk-me I’m Dean Winchester. I get it. I just wanted to see what the word was on your whole deal. Clearly, there isn’t one.”
“Dean,” Sam says, getting his brother’s attention. Dean’s eyes dart over to both him and Castiel. He gives them a curious expression as he sits up. Castiel notes the effort Dean puts into sitting up. He’s still so weak. Dean has slowly been putting on weight, but he remains frail.
“Dean!” calls Sam Winchester. He looks gargantuan in the doorway of the motel and somehow the expression on his face makes him the smallest man in the room.
So that’s… her name?”
Dean’s eyebrows raise up and he gives Cas an impressed look. He says as much, “wow. Good for you, man. My brother would have loved you.”
“Just because you both know my Spanish is shit doesn’t mean you can throw it around like I don’t know when you’re insulting each other,” he scolds.
“Only ‘cause you’re handsome,” she says with a laugh, reaching out to grab at Dean’s wrist. She leads him down the sidewalk and into a different alley a few buildings down. This one, Dean notes, is the car’s direct line of sight. He hands her the bills he’d pulled from his wallet and she gives him an expression that would have broken his heart at any other point in time.
They’d spoken English with John inside their house, but he’d been so used to hearing the general public speak Spanish and having everything be in Spanish, that having to be forced to learn to properly read English was jarring for the first few years. He’s nearly twenty two and only certain words are spoken with an accent now. His hunting notes are still written in Spanish. He can read English fine, but it takes his mind a few extra seconds to process the words. Sam picked up English better. His notes are in English, despite his fluency in Spanish.
“You can keep the impala,” Sam says as he digs through his pockets for the keys.
“Frank Belham was a man on probation in the Business programme, he has stock in a fortune five hundred company now. Nancy Reeler was run over by a golf cart driving full speed on campus and not only survived completely unscathed, but now has a million dollar lawsuit on her hands,” Cas says.
“From the alley?!” Another voice from behind Cas calls as Cas steps away to open the door more fully. Dean’s smile falters a little bit. Cas had a roommate.
“I’ve known you for almost a year now and I don’t remember you mentioning a birthday,” she says, looking over at the equipment Dean’s brought out.
“With an angel,” Dean confesses, his vision refocusing as the tears welling in his eyes pour out freely. He claws at Castiel’s back, his rational thought long gone. He’s seen the face of Heaven incarnate and he’s overcome with raw want. His hands grasp at Castiel, attempting to make up for all this lost time. Castiel is warm above him, all encompassing and overwhelming.
“I suppose what’s done is done,” Castiel adds. “Jack is fond of you.”
When Sam comes to get him so they can burn the body, Dean gets up of his own accord. Sam watches him wordlessly step out of the house and walk over to the pyre. He stands in front of the wrapped corpse. This isn’t how his angel deserved to die.
The door clicks and he doesn’t bother looking for who it may be. If it’s an enemy he’s made, they better make his death quick.
for now, he’s content to stand there with his angel, looking out at the other backyards, at the stars while their respective kids sleep in the house.
it's roughly 11 PM on january 23rd when dean gets a call from eileen. he'd been out of the bunker with jack and cas for nearly three days; they'd taken jack to an amusement park. something about never seeing one before which reminded dean the last time he'd ever been to one, he was three years old and didn't remember a thing. which was fine, except that jack had wanted to go to
Sam’s hands go up in front of him. His fingers move and ask:
dean’s heart sinks a little as cas continues.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says. He doesn’t look up immediately. His fingers scratch at the tape grip of the fishing rod as a warmth comes through his chest. He missed Castiel, he missed him so much.
“You can’t even be a straight man in America no more! You got all these faggots depraving shit everywhe—”
John had never really raised a hand to them, not in a way that counts, he thinks. Not the way he remembers seeing kids his age treated in the time they lived in Mexico. Hell, he remembers being there to help one of his friends get her father off of her mother. John never treated him or Sam like that. He’d been smacked around as had Sam, but it was never that bad.
“Hey, Cas. Is that short for something?” Dean asks, realizing that Cas is probably a nickname.
“Demons can do many things. They make deals with students down on their luck, for love, for anything.”
He cries when Sam hugs him goodbye, but he doesn’t respond to Sam’s hug. Sam’s nose is bleeding from where John had hit him.
By the sixth he’s close to begging. He won’t. He won’t beg.
“Have you talked to them yet?” Dean asks. Cas shakes his head.
He sits with him instead.
“Well, good luck with that,” Anna gives him a curious look as they turn back to their table. Dean gives her a grin as he watches her take a bite of her sandwich. He looks off in the distance at the line. People who showed up after him already have their stuff.
“I’m at a party. Whatever I drink, I take a sip and spill some for him. I’m top of my class, dad. Professor told me I’d make a hell of an archaeologist one day. If I can’t make you proud, I sure as hell can make Sam proud. Don’t call me back.”
to be calm? Dean continues, “nomas es un viajecito. De volada. Vamos, que tío Bobby te explique que onda y te traigo de vuelta.”
And sometimes Sam wishes his family problems were reduced to having illegitimate siblings. It’s always some supernatural adventure that usually leaves him with more questions than answers. This was the case when John would come home covered in something’s guts and is absolutely the case now.
“You see what I mean! Okay, okay, I’ll give you this one, but any more won’t count. You’re at 267, Dean. And it’s always a pleasure to see you, Emily. You take care now.”
Dean doesn’t respond. His eyes are closing in on themselves as he collapses onto the bed. The worn cushion feels like heaven on his back. His eyes betray him and fall shut when he feels a hand get into his hair.
responds, “yeah, well. I’m kinda the black sheep of the family. Ol’ girl was too rowdy for her own good. Had to bury her myself.”
He hears her bless a child and he thinks back to the child in the bunker. A little boy who can’t be older than six, raised by Sam and Mary Winchester. The little boy who’d asked Castiel what his name was and who’s eyes brightened when Sam introduced him. He thinks of the way the little boy wrapped himself around Castiel’s side, his little arms only barely coming around Castiel’s middle.
to ask about this later.
he pulls into the driveway of sam’s cookie cutter house. he’s in the middle of the driveway but dean doesn’t care and he knows neither sam nor eileen would care either. besides, the impala outshines the two normal cars they drive. he grabs the duffel bag and heads for the door, waiting for a second before the door clicks and he sees eileen in a crack in the door. he smiles at her.
It hurts significantly less than what Dean remembers. Logan rocks against him and Dean holds his breath until he feels something else pool in his stomach with the existing feelings that are tearing him apart. He gasps out loud. Dean hears a name fall from his own lips, the angel’s. His angel’s. Castiel. Dean shuts his eyes and the feeling swells in his chest. He breathes the name with every jolt he feels. His angel. His angel. His angel.
Dean could handle the pressured research needed to track and hunt a monster. A vampire? No problem. A werewolf? Forget about it. But, this? Sitting in a classroom and slowly being fed information about how probability works? It was so difficult getting used to that. Take the general education classes first they said, it’ll get it out of the way, they said. He finds himself zoning out. This wasn’t even part of his programme.
And neither of them know any better.
Dean’s body is a cocktail of the emotions he’s let himself carry these past few years and the emotions he’s denied himself his entire life. He turns his head back, his mouth falling open when Logan’s dick brushes the spot inside of him that makes him see stars.
“Dad?!” there’s a plea in his voice that doesn’t get answered.
“No,” Logan says, crossing his arms. And that’s all Dean needs to hear. He crosses the distance in a second and the demon is pressed against the wall under threat of one of Dean’s knives.
Dean looks up at the ceiling, the math he’s doing in his head is nearly visible on his face. He looks back down after a moment and says, “nearly a year.”
“Yeah,” God says. “I think this’ll do. Good job, Dean. You’re at kill number one.”
Cas gives him a curious look. Dean takes it as a win.
Anna, a very pretty girl with red hair, looks back at him from where she’s untying her shoes. She likes to walk in the grass barefoot. It’d have been endearing if Dean didn’t know the grass was frequented by people walking their dogs.
She pulls away, calming herself down as she wipes the blood from her mouth with the back of her shirt. The man staggers away, but Dean has already broken the distance. He’s quick enough that his knife goes in and out of the man’s gut cleanly. Now it’s the girl who watches from a distance as Dean holds the man against the side of the semi and plunges his knife in again. The lights go out in the man’s eyes and Dean looks up at the heavens.
“this what kept you?” dean asks cas as jack lets go and says he’s heading inside.
Sam is practically begging.
Dean shakes his head, “‘fraid not. We gotta go right now. My aunt Betty, nightmare of a woman, thinks we’re going to keep all of ‘dad’s gold’ or whatever. I just want the pictures of my mom. But, I gotta beat her to them.”
Dean’s mouth opens, but he can’t get any words out. Instead, he nods. It’s slow at first, but it becomes a quicker, desperate gesture.
He ends up in the stands of the field, taking slow and heavy steps up and down the bleachers. There’s a feeling of peace that floats in the air that generally makes him feel uneasy. He’s hunted ghosts long enough that he knows there’s no peace in a life like his, and yet, here it is.
“It’s really you?” Dean asks, still not entirely believing what he’s seeing.
Sam, as Castiel has learned, has mostly stopped hunting altogether. He and Mary had spent most of their time trying to track Dean down. Eileen had come up on a hunt that Sam and Mary had stumbled into and by pure happenstance she happened to be the woman of the younger Winchester’s dreams. Through the lessons and the time she spends in the bunker, she becomes a very good friend of Dean’s very quickly.
A person looms over him. Sam’s vision refocuses and he realizes he has no idea who this man is. It’s… his facial features seem familiar, but he’d remember John having introduced them to family. He’s got short brown hair, bright green eyes on tan skin, and a grin that irritates Sam at his core.
Mary gives him a smile, then. “Good.”
Sam takes a deep shaky breath.
“Dee, look at me,” John says. When his order is complied with, John asks, “when have I ever let anything bad happen to you?”
?” Dean finishes his awkwardly worded question.
, who says that you’ve got to kill a thousand evil men to bring back the one you love. So, whoever you are, is this like, your penance?” she asks. She turns to him and gives him another curious look.
Dean flinches at Sam’s words. Still, he refuses to back down. “You wouldn’t have come to the funeral anyway,” he says.
“Nick!” the barista yells. They all look over, Dean’s still waiting on his panini.
“You’re doing so good, Dean. You’re making me so proud,” He says in a soft voice. Dean’s expression shifts into one of reverence. His eyes flutter shut and he revels in God’s touch before it disappears completely, leaving him feeling hollow and cold. His face tilts forward a fruitless attempt to chase the divine, but God has already left him.
The next few months go off in a blur. He goes from place to place, not really hunting anything, but just trying to find a semblance of normalcy. Because this is the second time that his entire world is shaken and ripped from beneath him. He buys cassette tapes and takes to drinking.
“Well, um,” she fidgets with her fingers and she looks away for a second before she finds a starting point, “you’re an angel, right?”
“You gotta be careful with them, though,” Zach says with a grin, “they’ll kill you if they find out you’re there and not in the frat.”
He watches from a distance as John steps into another hospital room. When he finally reaches it, he screams. It’s high pitched and out of character. A nurse rushes over to him and follows his gaze into the room John had stepped into.
And Dean sighs. He was never good at this kind of thing. He decides to sign off.
“More of the same,” Mary responds. Her expression attempts to stay warm, but Castiel notes the stiffening of her lip. An action he’d seen on Dean thousands of times. Castiel looks down at the table.
“Sorry,” he says, looking at Dean with a set of blue eyes that seem almost.. unnatural.
dean sits there in the obligatory hot seat as everyone gathers around and sings him happy birthday. it’s awkward, it makes him blush and tears well up in his eyes, although nobody can really see it through the dimmed lights. and he looks around and his smile saddens a bit. he should have told cas to come with him. did sam not think to text jack?
It’s the first sound Dean has made in the nearly year-long recovery journey he’s had. Castiel watches Dean, Castiel’s chest filling with nothing but love, as Dean throws his head back slightly and laughs. Eileen’s grin gets bigger and she laughs with him while Castiel’s body feels as if it might melt entirely. It has to be the most beautiful thing Castiel has heard since he got back. And Castiel has been giving the golden age of music a run for its money lately.
“Dean,” Sam tries again. Dean still doesn’t respond. The angel. He’s looking at the angel. He’s got the angel’s face in his hand. Dean keeps looking at the angel. He has to keep looking at the angel. If Dean were to look away from the angel, he would lose him. Dean won’t lose the angel. Dean’s focus is on the angel, even if it feels like he’s staring into nothing and everything all at once.
“Anna,” Dean says with a smile that doesn’t reflect the emotions raging in his head and heart.
Dean looks up at him, the shame back on his face. Castiel tilts his head at him sadly. Dean shouldn’t feel shame, not for that. Never for that.
“Swimming in… who?” Cas squints as his voice raises an octave in surprise.
“Wait,” he says. “Where do you want it?”
“You know, uh, are you uh,
Castiel’s heart sinks and he watches Sam’s eyes widen for a second, the control of his emotions immediate. They stay there in silence for nearly ten minutes before Sam speaks again.
“Good morning, my king,” Logan says from his spot on the bed. He’s lying upside down in only a grey T-shirt and a pair of black boxer shorts. He’s got a phone in his hands that pings with a new message when he looks over at Dean. “How was work?” he asks.
“You’ve been working a case… That’s why you were at the other party. Why I’ve seen you around,” Dean says, pocketing his knife.
“What about me?” It comes out broken, his voice is higher than he’d like it to be.
Dean eats in relative peace after that. The diner is mostly empty, what with the holiday giving people a reason to be with one another or alone in their homes. The people that tend to flock to places like this at these times are people who have reached rock bottom or people like John Winchester.
“No thanks to you, Zach,” Dean says with a laugh in response, “you practically threw her in my lap.”
That’s gotta be where the new identity comes from. Sam waits again, the sinking feeling in his chest not getting any better, but not worsening.
He turns away, walking quickly and breaking into a sprint when he hears the car doors open. His breathing is frantic and he turns to shine the light at the chest of one. A silver bullet pierces the guy’s chest. He goes down. The other two break into a sprint.
“Aw, Latin not cutting it for you?” she asks, adding, “I’m doing Latin. I think everyone is doing Latin.”
Sam rounds the corner in the dim light, arms out to grab at the burglar, but there’s nobody there. Sam turns around, prepared to go back the way he came when he feels his feet get snuck out from under him and he lands flat on his back with a knee pressed into his stomach.
Dean jerks awake, looking around at the people sitting beside him. They’re too busy doing anything but pay attention. And he sighs, rubbing at his eyes. He’d already mourned. He didn’t need this.
“Dean,” she says, sitting beside him. She puts her hand on his face. Her eyes plead with him, shedding concern. He hears her, but he can’t answer her.
Sam frowns and gives him a long, tired look.
The words sucker punch Sam, enough that he staggers back, hand out to hold himself up against Jess’ car. Jess is at his side in a second. His world is out of focus for a second and he takes a deep breath. He grounds himself to the moment, just the way he would if he was hunting a monster, and he asks, “what was it?”
Dean’s head snaps around violently. His eyes are wide and his expression is that of rage. He hadn’t heard that name in nearly two years now.
“It’s not a bad thing, you know,” Sam says out loud. Castiel’s eyes flicker up to Sam and then back to Dean. Dean doesn’t look up at Sam.
The impala, performing spectacularly on her debut run since Dean had begun to repair her, comes to a slow stop in front of the address they’d found registered to a Samuel Winchester and someone named Jessica Moore. It’s a neat little house on the edge of the suburbs that’s nothing like the shitty apartment Dean had decided not to break into a little over two years ago, quiet in the dead of night that Dean’s arrived in. Close enough to the downtown area, but far out enough that rent wouldn’t be so ridiculous. It’s safe, Dean thinks.
asked for this, boy. Don’t whine to me about how badly your boo boos hurt,” Bobby says with no venom in his tone. He brings Dean a cup of tea. Dean is in bed, effectively covered in blankets to combat the winter in Sioux Falls.
Dean looks over at Sam, his expression curious when he says, “no, Sam. I’m still me.”
Dean doesn’t move from the awkward position he falls in until she lets him go. When she does, he falls onto his side. His face presses onto the bottom of the couch where Mary had sat and he stares forward at the side of the wall. His mind is tired, he’s not thinking of anything.
Dean’s heart begins pounding in his ears loudly enough that Dean misses the amused, “fitting,” that comes from above him.
Sam’s seventeenth birthday comes and with it a celebration. Sam, however, is less enthused. He seems to have a good enough time during the party, which is thrown at a restaurant that’s a little finer than the usual diners they eat at, but later that night when John’s gone out again and it’s just them two, Sam stands at the door, fidgeting with his fingers. He’s got something on his mind.
Humourless laughter wracks through him uncontrollably, enough that Dean has to reach forward and put his hands on Castiel’s shoulders. Because he’s drowning, suddenly, in nothingness. A wave of nausea comes over him and he leans his head to rest it on Castiel’s shoulder. Dean’s laughs turn into dry, emotionless sobs.
But, for whatever reason, this clinic he sits awkwardly at, decides to mess with his head.
He hears a cough and snaps back into reality, making eye contact with Zach and tapping his right thigh and signing a one, a two, a three and a one again. Zach gives him the slightest nod and the ball goes off a second later. Dean watches the bat hit the ball, he watches Anna scramble past second to grab the ball, tossing it to Isaac on third, too late. Isaac flings it in Dean’s direction. Dean’s already up to catch it. A perfect play.
He gets word of another party after his next practise. He and Zach are headed out of the lockers when Zach mentions a rager going down next weekend. Alpha Sigma Cappa Pi or whatever.
His face contorts in pain as his entire body shakes as the words ring in his heart. He’s alone, he’s scared. His mom was taken from him, his brother left him, his dad is gone.
a venir a mi casa después de siete pinches años, a meterte como un criminal, decirme que ya tiene un año que papá murió y luego todavía, para acabarla de chingar, me pides que me vaya al medio del pinche país contigo?”
Castiel nods, “I’m sure one day he’ll be able to tell us the extent of what happened. Sam mentioned a demon, the blood, and Dean told us about the deal with Chuck, however, I suspect there’s a lot more to it than just that.”
Dean feels lighter than he had when Bobby had first brought up going to get Sam. He nods, “yes, sir.”
“Dean?” comes a voice through the bathroom door that makes Dean jerk awake. He’d fallen asleep. In the bathtub. Fuck.
“Right, okay. Then, I’m still completely in the fucking dark as to why you were a girl the last time I saw you?”
“Easy, angel,” Logan says, breathy, wanting. His hands come to rest at Dean’s hips, “you’re damaging the merchandise.” When Dean’s grip loosens in the slightest, Logan leans in and kisses Dean proper. Dean is all teeth and experience.
Bobby. It’s been…
The remainder of the night passes with tense silences and John telling him to, “man up,” when he overhears his eldest crying in the bathroom.
“Dad,” he pleads, “what’s going on?”
“Not bait, honey. I’ll be right there with you. You know my shot’s unmatched,” John explains. It’s really that simple.
“Exactly. And this is no different. The wolves hunt down this road. They either run another car off or they pick someone off and that person disappears,” John gives him a smile that’s meant to inspire confidence.
He opens the door to darkness.
when he pulls back, cas keeps the little smile on his face and hands dean the book. it’s a photo album, he realizes, once he takes it and opens it. there’s- there’s baby pictures of him there. things that were surely lost in the fire in lawrence. as he flips through the album, he finds pictures of him and sam growing up. things nobody had ever photographed before, he’s pretty sure. at one point he finds a picture of him at age twelve, lying on roof of the impala.
“I’ve been… looking into stuff, since dad died—” Dean doesn’t get to finish his thought because Sam cuts him off.
“Te me cuidas, carnala,” Sam says, his own tears making his voice break. It’s ironic, that Sam asks him to take care of himself, when it’s Sam he should be looking out for.
“happy birthday, dad,” jack says. and he tenses against dean.
She spends hours with Dean for several days. Castiel will sometimes stand at the doorway for short moments, watching her gesture with one hand as she points to something in a book she’s brought. He watches Dean lift his hand and clumsily try and mimic her movements.
“I’ve been out here for an hour. Are you good? Did you fall in?”
“Dean, don’t ask him that,” Sam says, appearing beside Cas.
“Wait, dad didn’t
Once they’re in the bedroom and Sam is stuffing things into a duffel bag, Jess approaches him at a more intimate level.
That night, when she’s walked out of the bathroom and has clambered into the bed she’s designated for herself, Dean answers her. He doesn’t look up from the book he’s reading on his own bed, but he figures, if they’re going to part ways soon enough, she has a right to know at least some of the things going on.
“Yes?” he says, turning back.
“Oh, we found the entire fucking nest,” Dean says, recalling the memory, “but, that was it, Sam. I couldn’t be there anymore. I couldn’t… keep going, keep hunting, knowing that you—  we talked about you leaving. You said the vampires would be your last.”
“We just need your dad’s phone number, honey,” the woman says with a smile. He nods and takes the pen she hands him, writing down one of John’s burner phone numbers.
Castiel’s eyes flicker for a moment over to the Winchester that’s watching him. Sam raises his eyebrows curiously from behind his laptop. Castiel blushes and turns away, continuing one of his many walks around the bunker. The warmth hasn’t vanished from his face when he comes up on the large room they’ve reworked to be a gym. He hears the sound of grunts and peers inside to watch Mary punch and kick at a punching bag. She notices him immediately.
As he approaches the counter, he’s met with a familiar set of eyes. It’s the guy from the party.
“I have the car we took from the vamps. And you think I give a shit what dad wants?” Sam snaps, patting himself down when he can’t find the key in one of his pockets. His words make his brother flinch.
“There hasn’t been any real demonic activity, not outside of that woman who I traced to having made a few deals at that party,” Cas says, picking up a sticky note with two names written down.
“Cool,” Dean says with a grin, “I’ll catch up with you soon. I live on, uh, Washington and Avenue fifty three.”
His eyes flick up from the article he’s looking through on his phone at the sound of a yelp. He’s sitting in a little 24 hour diner in the middle of New Hampshire. It’s nearly two in the morning and Dean hasn’t caught sight of anything. And now, Dean watches as a man, a few years older than he is, tug at the skirt of the waitress that’s walking away from his table. Her awkward vocal reaction is what drags Dean’s attention from the article on a suspicious death.
“I’m so sorry,” she says, her expression as broken as he feels. And she brings him close. He’s loose in her grip, so his head falls against her shoulder and she wraps her arms around him. She presses a kiss against the top of his head. He doesn’t really feel it. He’s not sure how long she holds him.
“I’ll give it some thought,” Dean responds, slipping his shirt back on and buckling his belt.
He sits on an empty park bench and stares out over the field of grass as the earbuds Sam let him borrow play him tracks from the 1940’s. It’s a curated mix Castiel found on a music application. It helps with Castiel’s newly found aversion to silence.
“You know, uh, I think there’s a town nearby. I might just walk there instead,” his words are nervous, not because he’s playing the part, but because he’s terrified out of his mind. The three heads in the car frown at him.
“You can’t stay in there forever, you know!” Sam yells.
sam nods and gets up. dean hears the door that leads back into the house slide open and then slide shut. and dean is left with himself at the end of it all. he sighs. he’s happy, he thinks.
” Sam jerks back instinctively. He cannot believe this is something Dean would sit on. “How long ago did he die?”
Tania? That was the fifth hunter this year. Still, the way John had just replaced him bothered him more than it should have. It was logical and he knew this, but, it didn’t stop him from using it as the jumping off point of anger as he heard the message end and the final beep.
And there it is. His family has driven through different parts of the United States, some primarily Spanish speaking, some not, and he’s gotten used to the different ways people treat his name. Spanish speakers get the pronunciation, but will write his name down as
dean’s face goes completely red. the warmth is different from the warmth of the next kiss that cas places against his cheek again.
Sam frowns again. He knows as much as Dean does. He says simply, “I don’t know.”
Dean stays on the bed, his mind going through the catalogue of things he’s killed in his life. Sure, some of them were preying on innocent people that didn’t deserve to die, and thus deserved the silver bullet, machete, or what have you. But, others? He thinks of all the lives his father took, that his mother took. Was Dean a killer? Was he a killer descended from killers? It doesn’t feel like he’s done anything different. And he leaves it at that. Had Dean not interfered with the waitress, who else would that man have gone on to rape?
The person Sam has brought is a woman. Her name is Eileen and Sam explains that she is Deaf and can offer them help with Dean. Sam also neglects to mention that he is seeing this woman, but Castiel notices the way his hand slips into hers as they walk down the hall.
es que—” Dean stops himself. He knows Bobby’s Spanish is decent, but he won’t say what he wants to say in Spanish. “He’s not gonna know who I am.”
Sam would have liked to know.
No response. He frowns. He grips at the thin little slab of silver that he has dangling around his neck, the one that’s sawed down ever so slightly at the bottom, as he walks over toward the entrance.
The car comes to a stop at a side street off of the main highway in what’s nearly pitch black darkness.
“Give me back what I gave you,” Dean says. He watches her reach into her shirt and she fishes out the few hundreds he had given her. Dean glances off to the side in a quick glance. He’s only able to make out a large shape lumbering towards them. There it is.
“How long you been tracking this… whatever this is?” Dean asks.
“I do,” Castiel says. A small smile rests on his face as he says again, “I love you, Dean.”
He steps through more blood, coming to the door that led to the alley. He reaches down to loosen his shoelaces, opens the door, and steps out of his shoes. He reaches back to pick them up and heads down the alley.
His seventeenth birthday is a screaming match with their father. John promises Sam the impala for
The words feel like poison coming out of his mouth, but it’s what has to be said. He learned to drive in that car, he calls that car
“Look, my love, I know you want to keep going, but it’s not a good idea. Not logically,” Logan responds, unfazed by Dean’s expression.
“I don’t know what you did, but we’ve put together that whatever it was, it is what brought me back. And I will always be grateful, but Dean, nothing is worth losing yourself,” Castiel says softly. His hand goes to rest on Dean’s knee.
Dean looks up at him from the tray. Castiel reads a response on his face, but he chooses not to acknowledge it. Dean continues eating.
Dean makes a sharp right, away from the demon. The demon follows still. Dean takes a long deep breath.
He pulls the pocketknife out from his pocket and flicks it open. He stares down at the blade for a moment, before his eyes flick back to his reflection in the mirror. Dean’s torso is a homage to the things he’s done in the past several years. There are deep lacerations from struggles, from fights, and from Dean himself among the explicitly telling entry points of all the syringes he’s gone through. He drags the dull end of the blade down a piece of skin near his stomach that’s healed over a shade lighter than the rest of his skin. He breathes in deep as he flips the blade and runs it across perpendicular. He goes for as long as he inhales. The shiver that goes up his spine pushes the tension in his chest out with the blood. He exhales as he watches the red begin to drip down his own torso.
“Dean Winchester?”
After an ultrasound he mostly zones out for, he’s dressed and sitting with the doctor, looking at the anomalies in his body that give him the excess pain. No tumours, just the nature of things. He gets given a list of things he’s going to beg John to buy that will help with the pain as well as some painkillers.
if anyone didn't fully catch that last thing dean said to sam in spanish and didn't put it into google translate, the phrase essentially means, "
The doctor sees him soon enough. He feels very small waiting in the room in a gown, but the worst of his fears pass when it’s a woman that steps through the door. He gives her an awkward smile and explains the circumstances behind his visit. The monthly, uh, tax, as he refers to it, is painful to an extent where John’s sure there might be a tumour involved.
It got the best of them, ultimately, despite their best efforts. And when he’d been driving away, battered and bruised with John who’d been in a similar condition, they’d had the accident. A semi-truck had slammed directly into the impala. And he died.
And it becomes
She’s got light brown hair and a set of legs Dean’s almost jealous of. When he approaches her, she turns to him with a smile and a set of green eyes almost as deep as his own. She has to be at least half his age. He gives her a smile that he remembers having won people over.
“Do you have any new information?” Cas asks. Brass tacks.
“Okay, well. I— I know about… Dean,” she says, trailing off for a moment long enough to make Castiel question what she’s trying to say, but he has his guess. A guess that she confirms when she says, “I love Dean. I’ll always love him, no matter who he chooses to love.”
“You’ve been
“Because I’m a
need to see him to get a textbook of mine back before I go into my next class right now and—”
to go back to sleep.
Their lives, living in a place where they’re considered strangers, and are by definition “illegal,” is what should drive Sam to wanting to kill the monster that killed their mom. If they kill that, they can go home.
“Fine,” Dean says with a pout. Sam would have carried him and set him underneath the impala.
“You’re not fine,” Sam says, all knowing, as always. “You’re mourning. I’m just worried you’re not grieving in a healthy way. I know C—”
“Dad?” he calls after John.
mom, I don’t know anything about her!” Sam responds. He takes a deep breath and adds, “I talked to a counselor, I can get scholarships. I just have to apply for them. Dad’ll be fine, he’s
He gets to the room, tossing his duffel bag onto a coffee table and he takes a seat on the bed. It should feel different, shouldn’t it? Dean looks at his hands. He wonders how much blood they’d be drenched in if he were to begin to recount all of the lives, albeit monster lives, he’s taken. And even then, as he’s slowly coming to learn, not all supernatural creature lives were exactly monster lives. He wonders how much of that blood is innocent.
Time has passed since Dean confessed in the middle of an already tense conversation from behind his brother’s back, his hand coming up to say, very simply with three fingers: I love you. It’s been months now, that Dean will stand in the doorway of Castiel’s room, looking smaller than he is and ask Castiel to sit with him as he falls asleep. It’s time enough that Castiel has all but memorized the pattern in which Dean inhales and exhales when he’s asleep. He’s also noted that Dean’s head seems to fit perfectly in the crook of Castiel’s shoulder.
“That’s not—” Cas stops and sighs, “will you tell me if you hear of any fraternal parties?”
“You got a name, then?” Bobby asks in response. “Cindy’d been born somethin’ other than Cindy, I reckon.”
“you ever think we’d live this long?” sam asks.
He lets her go, then. She turns to watch the lumbering man approach them. Her face goes pale as she backs up.
“Have a smoke, I know. I’m just busting your balls, man,” Dean says with a grin. The guy’s expression shifts to one of curiosity in the same way that Anna’s does sometimes.
The light goes on another and he goes down as well, silver bullet in his chest. The third, however, the third is quicker than he seemed.
The newest responsibility that comes with turning seventeen, outside of being Sam’s mother and John’s maid, is that he gets to go on more hunts. He helps John take a tulpa and it becomes his favourite hunt to date. The next time they’re out, he’s excited. He’s helped gank several ghosts, helped John find a vampire den, and he heard John muttering something about werewolves to himself earlier.
“dean!” he hears jack yell. it’s louder given it’s three in the morning and most people in this neighbourhood are asleep.
name,” she says, answering her own question. Dean looks down.
Dean grins.
remember that the mark of Cain had made managing those feelings easier when it was about sating his need for violence.
Dean slumps on it beside him, leaning over to rest himself against Castiel with his head over where Castiel’s heart beats. There are enough not-beans in the chair that they sit at an angle, looking up at a constellation Castiel knows can’t help with the hunt for the supernatural, who’s name escapes him for the moment because he’s focused on the fact that Dean is listening to his heartbeat.
“Right,” is the curt answer he gets. The waiter boy isn’t even pretty. He’s not worth the effort.
“Okay,” God says, from behind him, “you know, you really walk the line between playing fair and cheating with this, Dean. I don’t know if any more of these’ll cut it.”
thank you again for reading!
Dean purses his lips together in a tight line. He takes a second, reasoning it with himself, and then nods at the ground. Sam watches all of this and is about to rush him when he looks up at Sam and with a special Winchester-brand intensity says, “dad’s dead.”
He receives a breathy laugh by his ear as fingers reach up his shirt to tap at the skin closest to his waistband. Logan’s hands go further down again, tugging at the waistband of his jeans again. The backs of his fingers tickle the skin. Dean exhales in response.
No, not really.
Cas frowns, eyes still squinting, trying to read Dean, “am I involved? With my roommate? As in do I… perceive him?”
The door shuts quietly behind him and he looks over at one of the two beds where John Winchester is loudly snoring.
Castiel tilts his head curiously, “of course.”
dean turns back and pulls jack forward to pull him into a better hug as he laughs. that’s somehow the craziest thing he’s ever heard.
It doesn’t take Dean long to pick up the pace. On his own, without a child to lookout for, he’s mostly unstoppable. It becomes a clinical routine. He wakes up, showers, gets dressed, goes out, finds a mark, and the rest is second nature. Dean stopped accounting for time long ago. The only things that give him an idea of what month it may be is when the decor and waitresses at diners greet him with holidays. He cycles through them and on a Christmas, he finds himself at yet another diner in the middle of nowhere.
“Let go of me, you freak! What the fuck is wrong with you!?” she yells, trying to pull away still. Dean hopes it's enough of a show.
die?” Now Sam feels bad about
He walks away from the pyre. Sam calls out after him, but Dean can’t answer him.
“I can’t fucking believe you,” he says, heading out the door. Sam calls for him, but that’s the end of the discussion.
The sound of a loud metal door screeches in their vicinity. In the distance, a drunk is shoved out of the doorway and the metal door screeches again, likely being shut. The drunk staggers away, yelling obscenities toward the door. Dean pays him no mind. The obscenities sound distant, until they aren’t. The drunk stands less than a few inches away.
“You’re just gonna throw it in the trash?” Dean says incredulously. Really?
The bandages go on quickly enough and his shirt is back on him when he opens the door, but a voice stops him in his tracks.
“Wait, I’m
“You weren’t named after Butch Cassidy, were you?” Dean asks, the idea coming into his head with an incredibly wide grin that gets wider when Cas doesn’t answer him.
Dean ignores the response. He’s already fished the kit out of his duffel bag and is moving over to take a seat against the bed’s headboard. The process is nearly second nature by now. He’s put another dose in himself as quickly as he ever has. It no longer gives him the euphoric rush, but more so puts air in his lungs.
The seventh comes around and he’s sitting outside of a laundromat by himself at a bus stop. He’s not waiting for a bus, but he’d needed to be outside. The desert is cold this time of year. It roars around him with a silence that rings in Dean’s ears. He takes several controlled breaths. He’s not going to beg.
cas squints. dean laughs some more and gets himself out of bed. he’s gotta find the little duffel bag that they’d dedicated to tools that didn’t include weapons of mass destruction. it shouldn’t be too hard to find. the last time they’d used it was when sam actually broke a door off its hinges.
