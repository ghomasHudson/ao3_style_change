“Oh, finally!” exclaimed Vernet and hopped down from the wagon like an unruly goat-kid. “We will wait here for a while, while Pierre takes my luggage to my place. Follow me, gentlemen!”
Sherlock stood by the parked police-van, disinterested in the proceedings and busily browsed the net, his eyes fixated on the screen of his smartphone.
Sherlock drew forward to the podium standing in the middle of the room and reached out for the statue of Dionysus. After a minute of careful manoeuvring, he succeeded in taking god’s thyrsus out of his plaster hand. He then put this decorative metal rod on the long bench placed by the wall of the room, pulled some black plastic wrapping from the sack visible under the bench and neatly wrapped the object into it. When he was finished, he beckoned to me and we finally left but not before we switched off the lights and locked the warehouse behind us.
When Vernet and Didier re-emerged from inside, carrying two big bags with them, I barely recognised them through the water that got stuck in my eyes. I retreated further into shadows and breathed heavily, trying to calm myself. Thankfully, I managed to somehow mask my disconcertedness in time to see Didier locking the door and handling the keys to the old guy who shuffled deeper into the court with them, leaving us to our own devices. I was therefore able to follow the others in quite a peaceful manner while we returned to the cab.
“Cathar bonhommes only abstain from procreative sex. Our coitus could not be procreative, therefore it did not break the rules of conduct which Julian had to follow as one of them. Our coupling was not something filthy. It was more like joining of souls, in fact.”
“What…?” He stammered after a while. “What does that mean? What exactly do you insinuate right now?”
Then, while he was slowly recovering, I shed off my own garments and joined him on the bed. I cuddled with him for a while and claimed him again after that.
She was crying and sobbing into the carpet; clawing at her panties and dress trying to cover herself up again; become somewhat decent. All the while internally cursing herself for showing him her tears…
Not satisfied with what he found, though, he got up; closing the laptop.
“Coming? What? Where?” He looked to Holmes confused. The detective had a habit of forgetting John couldn’t read his mind.
Coming back he was confused; so he pushed John away from him. Acting as if his life was still threatened.
The pale man sighed loudly. His eyes were now open wide; most of all he wanted to run. Every signal in his body screamed at him to run and hide.
Sherlock had begged, almost clawing at John’s knees to allow him to go full cold turkey: despite John’s better knowledge as a healthcare professional.
I hesitantly drew closer to him.
“How is Sally?” I asked quietly while we were sipping the sweet, refreshing brew.
Sherlock slipped out, stiffly holding a violin-case under his arm.
“Deduce what it is!” He challenged Sherlock, a secretive smile dallying with the corners of his mouth.
I opened my mouth in astonishment.
The kidnapper put a slim hand on the arm of the gorilla: “Release him.”
The tension in the room was unbearable. Two gorillas guarding Sherlock whooped in excitement a bit. Strange premonition whispered into my ear that all this proceeds too smoothly for it to be real. Ands so I was not even surprised when the pale face of the leading kidnapper turned absolutely stony after he looked into the severed grip.
“Suicide, John?” Sherlock smiled contemptuously. “This was anything but. The guy was already dead before he was thrown out of the cubicle.”
Sherlock smiled sardonically when we were finished and he remarked: “If I knew what effect the revelation of my past would have on you, I would have told you about Julian much sooner.”
“Yes, she was the one who took away the weapon. Some old, unused chimney must be located behind the heating stove in Arnaud's drawing room, with a hole cut into it at the level of the floor, entirely masked by the body of the stove standing in front of it. Arnaud probably fastened a cord to a revolver and as he hid the revolver under the stove, he pushed the end of the cord into the hole in the chimney, so that it reached the ground level. I bet the chimney still has its wicket there, so the cord was practically invisible to the prying eyes of the uninitiated.
“Finished? How?” Ganimard dropped his hand and clenched the handkerchief in his fist in visible anger. “Lupin is still at large together with his booty!”
I cringed when I heard his bold words. I stared at the masked up guy nervously. But he didn’t protest, just stated dryly: “I agree. It’s a deal.”
The driver assumed his perch after that, spurred the horse on and we were off to the town, moving through the streets in a snail's pace.
He sprang like a lightning flash from his seat straight away and he hollered at me: “John, get dressed, quickly! It's the old chimney, of course! Oh, what an idiot I was! Come on, we must run! Come, lest it'll be too late!”
He turned to me sharply, his gaze meeting mine for the first time since our visit in Authié's flat: “Don't call him a pervert! What he did was not proper, I admit, but he didn't abuse me. I had my say in the matter and I allowed it to proceed. Julian taught me many things about my body and I learnt much about myself while we were together. I later split up with him, but I don't think the experience harmed me in any way.”
The rock of the size of Gibraltar fell from my heart when the sliding doors to Greg’s division opened slowly and revealed Philip Anderson sitting lonely inside the bureau.
Sherlock threw a frowning glance at the packet and pressed his lips together.
“Marcel…” Sherlock whispered, visibly shaken. “Marcel Vernet!”
Things went smoothly thus far and yet I cringed in torturous fear inwardly. The idea of Sally Donovan possibly having a night duty in Greg’s office scared me to no end. I knew I would be forced to deal with it if it came to that - but this certainty didn’t ease my worry in the least. The thought of encountering a woman whom my wife has left with crippling injury was terrifying still.
Shit! I really managed to anger him this time…
Philip shrugged his shoulders and sighed: “She acts like the old Sally we knew. Outwardly, you wouldn’t say anything is amiss. But her hand ….the hand is almost completely useless and it gets no better… you know?”
Vivien Mycroft Holmes! Now, that's some news! Could it get any crazier by the minute?
“You know what, Detective? I forgive you. I am not a vengeful kind of guy, you see? I’ll set you and the police officer free, safe and sound, without as much as lifting a finger on you... but only if you comply with another request from me. The last one, I assure you.”
”John, did you know they have shop in Brighton that makes clothes from road-kill animals?”
The men surrounding us laughed uproariously. Our main torturer took stand by the counter to enjoy the show and his gorillas resumed the place at their seats in the open area to my left with similar intent.
As we walked away from the edge of the swiftly flowing water, a young man – probably the owner of the jetboat we “borrowed” – flew out of maintenance barrack and looked as if he wanted to yell at us… but one glimpse of our gloomy, awful countenance sufficed to stop him. He chickened out, shrunk back and only stared at us with an open mouth. I gave him a wide innocent grin but he didn’t seem to appreciate it. So I shrugged my shoulders and banished him from my thoughts easily.
John stilled his hand for a while and relished the sight, thoroughly satisfied with the result. Two strong thighs, pale like alabaster pillars, were adorned with a tuft of wild, jet black curls. Heavy, dark red member grew from the forest of soft curly hair, resembling some exotic plant or a bizarre mer-creature, slick with glossy coating of the smeared precum.
“May I ask you one last personal question, Sherlock? I will stop bothering you with them after that, I promise.”
Sherlock mumbled something under his nose, rambling back and forth on the trottoir next to the bistro, his head bowed to his chest in thought, his hands clasped behind his back. No one dared to approach him, people kept their distance seeing how absent-minded and out of it he is.
“No! Wait…” Sherlock caught my other wrist too, forcing me to stop. He held me in this bizarre clinch for a second to make a point. After that he released me and turning his back on me, started to slowly walk towards the other room.
“Where to? Shall we go to Scotland Yard right away? Or would we stop at Baker Street first? I’d like to change into something dry before we appear at Greg’s office, to be honest…”
Sherlock blushes, frowns and proudly returns to his pasta, mumbling something like “damn, there's always something” under his nose.
Because in the next second, the door to the bistro flew open and a heavy-set elderly woman staggered in, her hand pressed tightly to her heaving breasts.
“Take it and leave us alone. I don’t care for any of your shit so I won’t raise an alarm. I will free the policeman only after you are safely away. Now go!”
“Well, Guillaume's grand-mère was a great admirer of Guillaume d'Orange called Fièrebras, Count of Toulouse, that famous Aquitanian knight who fought Saracens and ogres in the vicinity and was sainted for it. She had this grand tome full of Chansons de Geste in her library and La Chanson de Guillaume happened to be her most favourite one. She arranged her second grandson to be named after him.”
Sherlock didn’t move a muscle nor spoke, but only acknowledged the fact with the subtle nod.
With my head spinning from all that Daily Mail rubbish, I turned quizzically to Sherlock again, only to find him missing. He stood with his back turned to me, partly hidden in the shadow of the trees of Jubilee Garden and smoked a cigarette without an undue interruption now, lost deep in thought.
xxxxxxxx
Man lifted the fallen object with caution, something akin to suspicion evident in his body language.
I floored him fair and square. Sherlock was speechless for a while. Still, he noticed my shameless grin and came to his senses just as quickly.
“For SOME time? How long a time do you have in mind?”
Bele amie, si est de nus,
The cold hand of fear seized my breast in a tight grip. I shuddered and emitted a sharp breath.
The sudden hoot startled me from further reverie.
But now that I looked closer at the area lying behind that door, thinly lit by the lamplight burning in the drawing room, I realised that the outlines of an actual, living human face are discernible in the door-gap. The slight luminescence betrayed the position of the eye gaping at us dispassionately, the greyish spot among the dark shadows seemed to indicate the white hair. In the total silence that ensued in the room after Sherlock grabbed me by the hand I was finally able to hear the almost inaudible droning of someone's breath.
“I was thinking that the cubicle was most likely private. As is the case, in fact.” My friend retorted defiantly, crossing the arms over his chest. “And the man in question can’t pose any danger to his surroundings anymore, I’m afraid. From the looks of it, he is deceased too.”
Sherlock rose out of his seat and casually walked to the wrapped up thyrsus recumbent in the corner of the room. He slowly took the plastic cover off it and lifted it carefully, weighing it in his hand. He then seized the artificial pine-cone placed at the top of the slim metal rod and screwed it off with ease.
“I don’t merely think so, it’s the promise. The one I definitely intend to keep.” I swore with solemn air and ruffled his dark curls playfully. “But I’ll leave that for later. I think we should speak about some serious matter for a change. So… what about some ice-cream?”
We climbed out of the car and set out to the dark hall. Sherlock held the crutch in front of his chest reverently as if it was some bizarre relic to worship.
The youth laughed, seized by such mirth that his molars were showing.
John wakes up early.
And suddenly... it was as if a Gorgon cast her terrifying glance at him in turn. He blanched, all the way up to his lips and grew absolutely still and rigid as if he was transformed into the statue in this very moment.
I cursed and heard my sentiments being echoed in off-colour French by Inspecteur Ganimard who peeked into the coupé from the corridor.
The man jumps out as if his knickers were on fire and is out of the door as quickly as a breeze. John washes his hands in a sink and returns upstairs to his table, taking his place once again.
Bonhomme? A Good Man? I felt as if I was drifting farther and farther to the sea, loosing even the slightest connection with the land.
I looked there and got his point. The sleek boat of the kidnappers just burst out of ship-lock of the South Dock Marina which was the only way out of the Greenland Dock too. We managed to intercept them.
Sherlock did not respond nor changed his stiff posture, he merely stared into space blankly, clutching the aluminium rod in a white-grip.
We ordered the cabbie to wait and hurried through the badly-lit archway to the small court lined with entrances to the individual flats on all sides.
Cold all over, John undressed wearily and numbly blinked at the total darkness for hours, until the sleep claimed him.
They make it to the beach without further accident.
In that instant, that chaotic, surreal feeling of being thrown into a grotesque illusion resurfaced with incredible force.
I closed my eyes tightly and tried to concentrate on the shaky rhythm of my breath.
John eyes twinkled. After that, he uttered the phrase, carefully pronouncing the half-forgotten dialect. It was a bit risky, but he knew Sherlock would understand – the knowledge of such trivia was his thing, anyway:
There was another entrance there indeed. But it was secured with a trellis composed of firm steel bars on which a heavy patent lock glittered. It seemed downright impossible to pass through it. I gnashed my teeth in helpless ire at the sight and when we came nearer, I grasped the bars with both hands. I tried to wrest them from the hinges, but they were a bit too solid for that.
My tactic was successful. Before the kiss could reach his mouth, the man turned his head to me in surprise, eyeing me with bewilderment as if he only noticed me right now.
His profile, sharper and more defined in the twilight, gave him his usual self-possessed and unemotional look. Yet the wild gleam in his pale eyes betrayed the hunting instinct of the bloodhound pulsing powerfully through his body. Even his garments reflected his change into a hunter chasing a game now, his favourite frock-coat and top-hat being replaced by a deerstalker cap and the Ulster coat. Observing him in his element, I almost became flustered, for something in his aggressive vigour made him irresistible in my eyes. He looked like Mars personified.
Their craft quickly reached the hypothetical middle of the river and headed south-east, trying to sail around the Isle of Dogs. Lestrade’s compact figure was distinctly visible in it, more so because exactly at that very moment a black-clad gorilla sitting next to Lestrade slapped him viciously. My blood boiled at the sight and I leaned forward, determinedly gluing myself to Sherlock.
Lestrade cursed under his breath and turned around, marching to his unit in haste.
“Fuck rational!” I hissed.
De Vries’s enterprise was located in the building to our right which was placed at the edge of one row, just next to the little bridge. The massive structure contained a large basement serving as a warehouse where De Vries stored his articles of stock.
Like Niobe and Marsyas. They dealt with their god too arrogantly – and it was their hubris that killed them, just like it would kill me in a little while. And I would deserve every bit of it, since he pointedly asked me not to come – and I did not listen.
John drinks a large amount of his ale in one gulp and tries to tend to his baked beans and scrambled eggs again when Sherlock lightly touches his wrist with the mere tips of his fingers.
“Oh, everything is fine, Greg. I had fantastic time in there. I love the smell of semtex in the morning and these guys offered me aplenty. Probably not English, but ideal hosts anyway….”
“Uh?” Anderson raised his head and blinked at me blearily. I pointed at his half-drunk cup with question in my eyes.
Sherlock's inclined his head, put his mouth near John's ear and breathed few low, throaty words into it: “You are a tease, do you know that?”
“Oh, I only met him a few days ago, at this very bistro! I didn't even know he moved here, to Rue de l'Orb, because he inhabited a nice little villa near Les Halles previously. He told me he had to give up his work for the church because of an illness and that he needed some change of the environment… I wanted to pay him a visit and to bring him some wine from our vineyard soon… and now I'm annoyed with myself it never came to that. If I only knew…”
She blinked again and then she blew her nose into Sherlock's handkerchief thoroughly.
Lestrade, visibly stressed and weary, finished his report to the media.
“All right,” Sherlock capitulated. “We will try it the other way around. Have you ever heard of Cathars, John?”
The letter was battered and badly creased but still nicely readable. It was written in the heavy masculine hand and it depicted the plan of Arnaud's suicide to the minute detail, leaving no doubt about the true course of events in our minds. It figures that Arnaud had still a modicum of conscience in him – he gave Rosalie the letter in case she would be caught with the revolver in her hands to protect her from the possible accusation of murder. Thankfully, he never mentioned the fact that Authié is a Cathar in it. In his dementia he only referred to Authié as “the hell spawn” and so the letter could be later used to acquit Authié of the crime.
“Oh, you cunning Devil,” I growled and swiftly joined him outside, seized equally by thrill and by frustration.
“No, no, messieurs! These men are innocent! My cousin and his friend just entered this place after the crime was already discovered by Marie! They were just trying to help! The real perpetrator must be still….”
Unwilling to be left out of the case, I hurried to them and got behind their backs right on time to hear the DI say: “Nothing more can be done here, I’m afraid. Let’s wrap it. Come on, I’ll give you and John a lift home.”
And a pale, cultured hand adorned with long fingers palmed me through my trousers and fondled me in the darkness of a small carriage vestibule with abandon.
So I just decided to persevere. I continued to appear in Sherlock’s room and showered him with affection. I hoped that in time he will deduce the true nature of my feelings from these acts.
Our trip down the river was quite trying. Waves were rough and the jetboat led by Sherlock’s inexperienced hand leaped through them awkwardly, rattling us like marionettes with every impact against the water.
Sherlock straightens out and screws up his mouth in annoyance: “Spoilsport!”
Glimpsing this unexpected sight, it started to dawn on me what Sherlock had in mind and I scanned the area of the embankment hungrily. The pier itself didn’t seem to be in use presently, for its mooring-bollards stood empty. But next to it, right by the small maintenance barrack, the safety metal fence gaped open and thus kept clear the way to the small staircase which led into the waves of the Thames. Blue, aerodynamically shaped jetboat rocked on the water where stairs met the water-level.
Typical Sherlock. Always wants to have the last word on things. But I won’t let myself be beaten on the concept of Greek mythology by a guy who deleted the Solar System, for God’s sake!
"I didn't propose to her if that's what you mean." His lips twist into half a smile, half a frown as he continues to stare at the table. He glances at you fleetingly from under his brows. There's a glint in that gaze, something you can't really decipher. He ruffles his hair, muffling a nervous laugh. "Fuck. Why am I even telling you this? You're not really a heart counselor, are you, Sherlock?"
He nods sharply to Lestrade and moves to the exit with his usual lack of grace, his back straight as a line and the air full of his self-given victory.
you bite the inside
You feel rush of warmth fill you as the idiot freezes, documents nearly falling from his hands. Lestrade is folding his arms, looking at the ceiling and there's a wide smile playing on your lips. Maybe you're really having a bad influence on the good doctor after all and it feels just heavenly to see the look of incredulousness and vulnerability on that ugly ditz's face even if it's not achieved with your own words.
"Sherl... up... finally-" The sound seems disjointed, flowing like water all around you. Is someone trying to talk to you? It's a pleasant, familiar voice and in the right circumstances it could be welcome but now it feels as if a fly was buzzing in your ear. "We have- talk, Sher-"
John groans finally, the heaviness of sleep still clouding his eyes when you throw his coat on him, quickly buttoning it lopsidedly across his trembling arms. The two of you ran down the stairs the next moment, your flatmate's elbow clasped tightly between your fingers.
and then you still
you cannot comprehend still after
until the whole
Sarah Sawyer is fidgeting nervously on the doorstep, her woolen sweater draped tightly along every curve. She hasn't been sleeping well for the past few nights for her eyes aren't as bright as they were the first day you met her and her cheeks are just as pale as yours. Her hair is tousled, a few strands going loose down her shoulders from her high pined up bun. Her skittish smile vanishes at the sight of you, disorientation finding its soft place in her eyes, her whole silhouette suddenly straightening up. You aren't surprised, not with the way the whole fiasco of your involvement in their last date turned out to be. It's quite a surprise to you, still, that she hasn't broken up with John yet. You frown at her, leaning onto the door-frame nonchalantly, sweeping your eyes over her. She might be an intelligent and observant girl but she does have much left to learn. She must've left her house in a hurry, her coat's belt caught up within its folds. Her jaw line is proud and she stares at you defiantly back, inching closer towards the doorstep. You try not to wince too much but in the end it's your arms and hips that currently stand in her way into the flat. There's that remote ache in your chest but you nod at her swiftly, sipping your tea, steam going up your face like a small cloud.
a meeting, let's meet
He tries to focus, one- two- three- looking around in a circle, scanning the walls for any vulnerability, any way forward.
"Neither are you, John." Your tone is much harsher than you wanted it to be but what has been said, has been said. John glances sharply at you, his face twisting slightly. You can't really fathom what this look in his eyes, as he averts his gaze from you suddenly, can mean. It seems that once again you said much too much, using just a few words.
an hour
"Let me in." She grits her teeth, glaring at you fully now, her fingers growing white on the door-frame. You observe her forehead crease and smooth itself every couple of seconds, fascinated.
“Ah, so nervous. So much anger in that body!” He swaggers up to Sherlock, his smile only growing wider. “Really, dear, you should've already learnt that acting out on emotions is a bad thing, especially for people like us.”
I didn't hear the silence rip my heart out
a hollow scream
To tell the truth and to irritate Lestrade a bit, you're sure they'll sooner destroy everything themselves and the rain would be just an excuse. Lestrade just sighs in answer, telling you to bring your lazy ass there better sooner than later.
meet me fuck with my brain
You turn on your heel and start walking away, never hearing the other's footsteps accompany yours.
I didn't hear my mind breaking
He hates the way he stutters out, hates the way words tumble out, “W-what did you say?”
all over again
The door is partly closed, not too well and before you can abandon the idea completely, a moan erupts from within once again. Your worry, no matter how grudgingly you might want to shush it, wins against the hesitation and so you make the door ajar.
"Who the hell do you think you are, John?"
You wink innocently at the man, pretending to start flipping through one of the older gardening magazines Mrs. Hudson left you a couple of years ago. If you remember correctly, there is an article on bees keeping somewhere in the middle of it that caught your attention some time ago. You're trying to find the right page while John is muttering under his breath and shooting daggers at your back. Before he can ask you, you pull an envelope with some of the shots you found lastly from your pocket. You toss it at him, neither turning around, nor caring where it would fall. As easy to predict as it is, a good dozen of the photographs slip and fall straight into the jam puddle, spluttering it onto John's trousers as far as the sound can be trusted.
“What do you want?" Sherlock asks, facing him. The blade of the knife digs into his side but it’s bearable. He grimaces at the blue mask, focusing solely on Moriarty. “Where's John?”
You stare at him with a bored expression fixed upon your face. "Are you quite finished contemplating the meaningless of your life?" He glances at you, tension slowly wearing off, a scandalized look entering his eyes. He opens his mouth to say something but you cut in, waving your hand dismissively, as if riding yourself of pesky insects, "Don't bother. We need to do some research that idiot didn't bother recommending."
his smile like honey and almond onto
your stale walls break
coats are heavy on our frames
You don't answer back. The two of you go cross the last few metres, light a bit better in this area. She is not looking at you with anticipation and something akin to guilt starts simmering deep within the layers. You are far more judgemental than it is either advisable or simply practical. Feelings should not cloud vision, never, ever. "When?"
He unzips his jeans and you stare in fascination as he begin to slide them off blindly, as if too accustomed to the routine to care anymore. The laptop bounces on his knees as the trousers roll down his hips and thighs. They aren't marvelous, aren't even half-attractive but the view of naked skin strikes you like lightning. Not the hoarse whisper, not the act but the milky, hairy tissue alarms you enough to realize just what exactly you are doing.
We found ourselves under the saddle-roof of a large, open station canopy with one edge affixed to the wall of a station building. Sherlock lit his pipe and gently inhaling the smoke, he slowly walked towards the friendly looking premises, surveying the place in his careful, but unobtrusive way. I followed suit, furtively looking around me. However, the place was positively depopulated. Only a train dispatcher yawned in ennui beside the locomotive and some wild-haired artsy type was busy unloading his luggage out of the second class carriage at the other end of the platform.
“I understand why you are obsessed,” he continued with his soliloquy as if I didn’t utter a word. “But don’t succumb to him, Dr. Watson. He’s a cruel god.”
“Do you know who did it?” His eyes were slightly damp as he looked directly into hers.
“Maybe later” he let her know and he was already on his way out. Molly swallowed.
Now she remembered the reason she had withstood this for so long…
Wait. William. Oh.
“You’re early, Pet. Eager are we?” the man chuckled at her as he ushered her inside; not wanting to linger too long in the hall.
This one as well.
John withdrew the head and Sherlock felt the dread. No. Don’t stop… please! He was begging internally.
Her teeth pinned her bottom lip in a vice grip.
“You are the one leaving me…” John seemed to regret his words the second they trailed off his blushing lips.
“It’s not my case Sherlock” he lowered his voice “And DI Yellow doesn’t want your help; trust me Sherlock I’ve been trying to warm her to the idea but she’s not buying” He tried to explain. Sherlock grunted frustrated.
“I think I need some real expert advice” his upper lip lifted in disgust at his own words.
“Trying to get me drunk?” she laughed nervously. He laughed with her.
Another deep sigh emanated from the broken one; his muscles finally gave in… slowly but surely. He relaxed.
She forced herself to look at the young girl’s face once more before she started giving out orders as to who was going to do what. She was personally trotting around the place hoping the killer had left something behind. She heard the beeping of a phone.
“Come here” he cooed, gently and reached out for her; pulling her towards him in a hug.
“John” Sherlock verbally tried to pad out what he was going to say next. He braced for the impact. “I was looking for the last remaining cocaine bottle”. He confessed; emotionless.
This could only come back to bite her… And she did consider leading him to a false address; but wouldn’t that become awkward if he did stalk her? Oh. She never could win.
“I’m sure something will turn up, but why not distract yourself in the mean time?” Watson put his paper down and found his phone and scrolled through the emails.
Every cupboard was flung open and every single item had been turned inside out; papers scattered, glasses thrown and broken, drawers emptied right on the floor, cutlery sprayed like landmines with the shards of glass.
Sherlock nodded eagerly.
John smirked. He knew the erogenous zones well and he was close to knowing the ones to work on Sherlock to get him all hot and bothered; taking him over that edge.
“Here, I put some cash in here too; be safe. I love you” She got to look into her daughters grey eyes surrounded by thick layers of black makeup. Lucy shook her head and off she was.
“I… I’m sorry” minutes later he broke the painful silence.
“I misplaced an important sample from an experiment” The curly haired man looked into John’s eyes and smiled; almost childishly as he got on his feet.
He barely noticed that the other one entered the living room. Sherlock didn’t even notice him sitting himself on the table; facing him… He was far too busy ignoring the persistent prickling of his own skin.
She dialled Kelly’s number. They never called each other but Lucy was getting cold and the streets were getting darker.
Awfully quiet.
“Sherlock…” John weighed his words; his brain running a marathon trying to find the right to approach this unfamiliar situation.
“Where are you going?” She sniffled; desperately trying to supress her emotions that had overwhelmed her.
”Have you lived in London long?” ‘William’ inquired as they slowly made their way. She figured he could tell by her accent.
This had not been part of Sherlock’s calculations! The silence was loud, so loud it hurt his eardrums.
“The tattoo, could you describe it?” Her mouth was dry and it was a struggle to at least look professional. She almost regretted the question. But she knew this was not how she wanted to see Lucy.
“I miss you” he softened “Mind coming tomorrow night? I need you” he pretended like she had a choice. She nodded even if he couldn’t see her.
It took inhuman strength for Sherlock to not make a sound and cry out as his body literally exploded in a sea of pleasure. He pressed his mouth hard into the sheet and rode out the pleasure; his entire body bucking and John let him ride out the pleasure; softly working him still.
“It was dark…”
Oh John. You’ve much to learn still.
“They were friends of mine, a while back, yes” he reached for his tea and took a large gulp and seemed to struggle to swallow.
“I know!” she replied. “But unlike me you have made a life for yourself. Don’t spoil it now!” To her own surprised her voice raised and she tried to school him. “Besides, you’re an idiot for leaving your kit with a fucked up crack whore” She barked.
Oh, If only she had been wiser…
First. What? He caught her off guard. Carefully he took hold of her wrist and brushed his thumb gently over the tattoo there. “The rose or your love of the drink?” he looked into her eyes and read her ink with his digit.
She was aware what strength it took for him to form an apology. Even when it didn’t sound all too sincere.
And Sherlock was falling apart on the bed in front of him. His fingers twitched and his cock was now wet with precum.
He was trying again; the fair-haired man.
She closed her door to her darkened and empty flat behind her; locking it and checked the handle just to be certain. She would check it again later to be sure it really was secure… that she really was safe…
Sherlock’s knees buckled softly.
Did you try to tell me it was all right? Did you try to save me some of the pain? But you didn’t… John… you failed.
“I blew it. Leila. I blew it” those clear eyes turned wet… and one tear after the next rolled down his cheeks.
Holmes and Watson were standing in the shadows watching the police do their work closely. Not a word was uttered between them but John couldn’t help but worry for his friend. It obviously pained him not to be involved.
Had someone broken in? Moriarty’s clan?
As the unwelcome thoughts overwhelmed her she couldn’t hold the nausea back. Frantically reaching for the toilet she couldn’t stop it.
Admitting defeat, she braided her hair, wringing more water from it and after a last check of the front door she crawled into bed; closing her eyes… hoping she could sleep. If anything she needed the mental robustness for the next night.
“And the S?” Molly was scared to ask. She had a feeling the answer was going to hurt her. Damned feelings. She had spent so long trying to get over her feelings and longing for the consulting detective.
He cared so much. Too much.
She was though somehow and in a forlorn way happy that this girl had no family she would have to contact. It was a horrible thought though. For some reason she caught herself gently striking her pale cheek before they closed the body bag. Possibly her mother instinct kicking in.
“I want a full report of the stomach content” he straightened up again, never taking her eyes off Mira, but speaking to Molly who nodded. Still trying to put a finger on this whole thing. John kept to his usual place when they were at the morgue, in the back simply observing , this time more than ever observing his friend. Worryingly.
“You had feelings for her” Sherlock tilted his head.
His hands moved upwards towards her hips, as he continued to rasp his tongue over the wound. Cat tried to scream but no sound came from her lips either. She was at the mercy of this shadow-man.
Was that a ghost? The sound of a ghost that should have been long gone…
John couldn’t wipe the grin off of his face; he was beyond pleased that Sherlock was playing along.
“You’re a doctor. She was anorexic” Sherlock kept observing the group as long as he could as the cab took them through London.
Not that. Not now!
“I was hoping you could help me on that one” Celia pushed the box of tissues closer to him.
“And your friends can confirm this?” She was studying his face looking for clues. He nodded.
Kelly was praying for death, never had she wanted it more than now and that was saying a lot. Where was the man now? How long could he take?
“Me, how?” his bottom lip was quivering.
“I’m not leaving you, mate” John’s voice bore clear signs of being overwhelmed by those pesky emotions, too…
She tried to crawl back to bed; she had nowhere to be… not before tonight any way. But she was wide awake by now. Her mind kept re-reading that message and what had happened the previous evening.
“Places” she chirped; holding her glass in her hand; changing her position on the couch to relieve her poor bottom and hip.
DI Yellow had just been informed that a staff member at a cinema had found yet another victim and before she rushed out of there she called Sherlock Holmes to give him the address.
Something better.
And he seemed to be in that particular mood…
But… why wasn’t he reacting? It simply didn’t make sense to Sherlock.
“Please don’t, I… Please!” she sobbed as he was struggling with unhooking her corset. She froze completely as his hands worked on removing her skirt and then her underwear leaving her naked on the clammy and grimy floor. She was shaking violently as he bound her hands.
Sherlock Holmes, who lazily lied on the couch, sighed deeply; his redundant comment on this fact.
“So he’s seeing her tonight then” the tall one spoke out loud; but it only made sense to himself.
Briskly she put it on the counter and went to the bathroom and changed out of her clothes; taking a hot shower and scrubbed down every inch of skin on her body. She removed her makeup by rubbing her eyes with her hands and rinsed with the hot water streaming down over her body.
“Well…” John had a feeling Sherlock had found evidence of the contrary
Enjoy.
John had gone to bed, and the flat had fallen silent; safe for Sherlock who was tapping away on a laptop. He was reading up on the recent online gossip about his main target. Not Cat… but the man who caused that bruise to her unnaturally pale face.
It all hurt him far too much.
How. How could he always do that to her? She was putty in his hands… quite literally.
“Accident?“ his eyes widened.
“No, no… Sherlock no!” John gasped; his eyes widening in horror. “You are not bringing Molly into this!!”
“I think it was a bit deeper than that” John was treading the ground carefully
“Listen, if you want I can get you my best man for that job” Greg lowered his voice.
Goodbye
Had she not been rendered frozen by being confronted by him so suddenly she would have rolled her eyes at him; perhaps she had even come back with a catty remark.
It was as if she forgot the bruise she had purposely tried to cover up with her hairstyle. Strange; he thought.
“Sherlock… shhh” she continued to coo. His hands clawed at her; holding on for dear life. He didn’t know his own strength… oh he never had.
As a gentleman he took it; leaning in to gently kiss it.
His fingers moved in circles registering every bump and unevenness; like a blind man reading braille.
“Leila” he moaned her name; just before his lips met with hers; claiming her mouth; pushing her back onto the floor
Remembering her desperate attempts to sleep times before… when she would do anything to get her body to rest before she lost what had been left of her mind; as if causing herself pain just to catch some sleep wasn’t a madness in itself…
“I need some air” the man didn’t even turn around or stop. He honestly feared what he might have done if he stayed too long.
Brilliant. This was the perfect chance! He could get her on her home-turf and he could find invaluable information about her.
“She is?” DI Yellow wasn’t surprised when the school called her to inform her that her daughter had left class. It wasn’t new… “Things aren’t easy for her, her best friend just died, yes… Kelly Middleton” she informed the school secretary. “Thank you though”. Upon hanging up another pain killer was swallowed.
“She was sure we would never meet again…” Sherlock spoke, mostly to himself and his own mental notes as he examined her naked cold torso. He was tracing a newly formed scar in the shape of an S on her breast, now a matching pair to the A on her other.
Passing her he brushed against her shoulder and it made her jump; as if every fibre in her being shied away from the human contact.
John’s fingers moved slower; achingly slow.
The young woman stumbled into her shower; clawing at her clothes and was biting back on a scream of desperation as her shoes clung to her feet… but finally she got her way. And once naked she turned on the water; and that moment the tears stared to run down her cheeks freely; mixing with the hot water hiding their presence.
He was shivering heavily. The memories that overtook him made him nauseous. He physically felt each and every rough touch, heard every word, he relived every emotion…
“Can I have your number at least? I’d like to talk to you again” he changed strategy on the spot. The second she was about to run.
“Shut up” Her eyes burned into his. He had taken a step too far. This was low. Even for him!
“Bedroom now.” He ordered; but not roughly this time. With his breathlessness it was closer to begging than it was commanding.
“They are on their way already. I figured you’d want them…” she stood next to him and looked at the pins as well. “Mr Holmes?” she looked at him instead. He didn’t take his eyes off of the map. He seemed so lost inside his own mind. “Promise me you can catch him” it was a moment of weakness and she wanted to take it back badly.
Perhaps she shouldn’t have been so afraid. Wasn’t that the point of that whole ‘Just say yes’ thing she had started on New Year’s Eve… thinking she needed to make some drastic changes to her life.
Before she knew it he had her on the cold and dirty floor… him sitting on top of her; pinning her hips down with his legs… and she didn’t fight him.
He needed to go just a bit deeper than that… the true gems were most likely hidden in John’s phone.
“Sure, whatever”. And she hung up again.
“I need to speak to a woman I think. She’s a bit more tough skinned than what I had calculated” he sat up in that moment.
Carefully she opened the door and gave him a brave smile in return as he entered.
Awkwardly she climbed back on the bed and mechanically opened her bare legs. With only a brief moment of hesitation she put the metal tool against the skin of her inner thigh.
“I’m fine John” Sherlock growled and walked over to the young woman. He moved her hair out of the way and looked at her neck. He moved his face close to her skin and sniffed.
Sherlock’s muscles ached tiredly from tensing; still somewhat prepared for what he saw coming.
Sherlock…
“Of course… can… can I help?”
“Who’s that?” the other one wondered; trying desperately to follow suit.
John’s chest rose and fell rapidly. He was huffing and puffing.
Now she could be the smart-ass.
She could still feel his soft lips on her cheek. That short exchange. What little moisture that had been on his lips had left a mark on her skin and the cool air was catching it.
“What’s going on?” The young girl on the other end sounded more confused than feisty.
And there it was; staring back at her.
‘It is literally just a room. Four walls’ he chanted to himself inwardly. It even sounded ridiculously dumb to his own ears.
It should have been me. It should always have been me.
“I’ll allow you to live on one condition” he took hold of her face and looked directly into her eyes. She looked back at him, taking shallow breaths.
“They would, if your mother cared to take you to a doctor” She put the glass down. Once again it was only ice that remained.
“She’s not answered my texts for a while” Lucy had barely chewed her food before she spoke.
“No problem ma’am”.
She went straight to her desk and continued her search for Annie Jackson’s boyfriend, Billy Clarke.  Her fingers were twitching. She was making a difficult decision.
He simply had his charms with him.
“That’s not your safe-word”
“I honestly don’t know” she got on her feet and took another good look at the info wall. “Turns out he knew the latest victim” she was looking at the picture of the young woman; her head tilted to the side and her pale face looking somewhat peaceful.
“I believe he is, he is not like other people” She began trembling now. Her hand formed a fist as she tried to keep herself under control.
Or maybe she really was too easy.
So, John continued to push his finger out and in to the second joint; rhythmically slow… until; again without warning he quickly pushed in to the knuckle. The result was another hip buck. John made sure to keep his finger away from Sherlock’s prostate. Not yet… not yet!
As soon as she emptied the glass he took it from her and put it back on the table.
The woman jumped.
John had gone to the kitchen to put the kettle on.
DI Yellow’s fingernails were tapping impatiently against her coffee cup as she was waiting for Molly Hooper to phone in with her views of the latest dead body. Her eyes were scanning the latest surveillance reports from the church and she nearly spilled the coffee as a kind hand rubbed her tense shoulder.
She reached for her makeup purse on the windowsill and at the bottom found a flattened box and prying it open the secret content fell on the table making a sound that to her sounded so incredibly loud.
“What is it with those X’s and O’s?” the detective pondered
She was barely thinking when she grabbed her whiskey bottle from the cupboard in the kitchen by the neck and drank from it; in a desperate attempt to soothe her nerves. Her eyes located her phone on the table and it was an almost less conscious act…
John made his way to the bedroom and Sherlock followed a few steps behind.
“I don’t believe you” John rubbed his jaw. All the tooth-grinding he had done to bite back his anger seemed to have made his jaw muscles cramp.
“Shut up John!”
The woman flinched again. Her eyes widened.
John coughed loudly; making his presence known.
He moved now, sliding his cold body against hers that was on fire and every inch he moved more of her skin was ripped from her bones. He rose up only to throw himself down on her; slamming his full body weight against her; putting his lips over hers and forcing his sandpapered tongue into her mouth; destroying her lips and tearing apart her tongue and the roof of her mouth.
Sherlock returned his full attention back to his frozen friend.
- That was what she convinced herself of. It made it easier to bear when he treated her like crap. Her of all people…
“In your medical opinion, how old is that bruise?” Sherlock held the phone in John’s face. John swallowed and looked at the picture of the young woman; that Sherlock had snapped in a moments unawareness on her part. A rare thing.
John was pissed.
Oh Sherlock, what have the world done to you? John heard himself sigh inwardly.
His mouth opened and he pretended this was the first time he noticed it.
“Was he inappropriate with the body?” The DI continued her interview.
(My updates might become slower, I have a few chapters written up but the meds I am on are meddling with my mind)
She was finishing her drink too fast. She needed it. Her entire body was trembling by now.
“Fuck you!” Lucy spat and ran out of there. Celia wanted to run after her. Catch her and hug her tight. Make her believe everything would be all right.
John had agreed; adding to the terms that Sherlock was not to be left alone at any point of his recovery. Which accounted for their change in sleeping arrangement… or rather, had created a good excuse to make a sporadic thing permanent if only for a while.
For some reason she felt a need to remember him.
“Gah!” the tall one groaned loudly. John found himself jumping surprised by the sudden outburst. “… fine” the pale face now turned towards him.
John let his hands speak… holding his partner; not willing to let go… rubbing him, trying to warm him up… he seemed so very cold! Feeling him… like he never had before… skin to skin.
He gave no answer though. He knew too well he was in an irritable mood today… sometimes silence was simply the best solution; with him being in this annoying state.
Everything hurt now; a million times worse than it had just five minutes before and it overwhelmed her. Not having to fake her strength for anyone gave way for the weakness she had expertly hidden away since she left the hotel.
Ah… yes… Sherlock’s bedroom!
Paul Stulte. The minister of foreign affairs.
But John was in charge of the nights… and he had accounted for his eagerness by stating that he would not be getting much sleep at home either way with the new born screaming bloody murder when she woke up hungry; a situation he had guessed his wife Mary would be more suited to handle.
In truth, it was in her pocket. She would never dream of using or selling his gear; no matter how desperate she had been. It was the last of him she owned…
“I know, I saw you” he whispered to her and she closed her eyes.
To his own frustration his bottom lip quivered ever so slightly. Unwelcome images of well tucked away memories popped up and flashed before his eyes.
Holmes was pacing the floor in small, fast paced circles; his lips moving mumbling inaudibly. Watson stood in the corner observing his friends eccentric behaviour rubbing his chin. It was nothing new for him to be like this; but this time it worried the good doctor. Sherlock hadn’t been quite the same since he met the young woman many months ago.
“Fuck. you’re hard” John groaned right into his ear and let his fingers trail all the way from thigh; over scrotum and over the string on the back of Sherlock’s cock all the way to the tip that was already oozing precum.
“You have to sleep sometime” John was propped up on his elbows; halfway under the covers. He was drowsily watching his best friend go through hell.
“She would have reported it?” Watson tried his best to come with an answer. Sherlock shook his curly head.
Was he honestly hoping to hide behind his ‘Only lies have detail’ line from that day John more than all wished he could erase from his memory?
“So, where are you from?”. He didn’t have to ask; he knew as much having indeed stalked her recently.
Sliding in on the tips of his toes he snatched John’s phone from the bedside table and once back in the safety of the hall he started reading. He caught himself biting his lip not to snicker out loud at some of what he found.
Sherlock heard what happened behind him; and he felt it difficult to catch his breath. Oh fuck. He wanted it. He needed to feel John inside him…
“Come here, you machine” John had used that word before but this time it was a soft, caring chuckle from him as he opened his arms. Sherlock looked at him confused. “I know I need a hug after today, it’s going to help stop the tears” John was careful as he said this. He understood Sherlock’s reservations and boundaries but he also knew he needed a friend right now.
Molly’s ears were perked trying to listen in on their conversation before they barged through the door. Sherlock first and John right behind.
The glass breaking!? John’s heart rate raised again, thumping hard against his chest.
“Sherlock” he shrugged his shoulder and let go of the pale skin and continued his thorough search of every inch of Mira Jensen’s body.
John pushed one finger in and found the prostate and Sherlock gave a hard jolt. His other hand moved over Sherlock’s thigh and grabbed his cock. And in a hard simultaneous pump John worked both erogenous zones hard. He jerked Sherlock’s cock forward; slipping the pad of his thumb over the tip as his finger inside teased the prostate until Sherlock couldn’t hold back anymore.
Suddenly, then, John’s face lit up; though he seemed to try to hide the excitement he had caused himself.
“Because it’s quite enough that you are toying with one woman’s feelings!” the fair-haired man raised his voice; putting down his mug.
He was used to the insults and the smirks, trying to read through the lines… this was uncharted territory; for the both of them it seemed.
But knowing they had lived alongside two bottles of the horrible stuff; that was too much.
“I do not need your help; we’ve got this covered” she held her stance. Holmes rolled his eyes at her.
He softly swirled the tip of his finger around the sensitive puckering outside. And Sherlock’s hands started kneading softly; letting John know he was causing him pleasure.
“You wouldn’t want to send it yet… you’d seem too eager” John warned. “Might scare her off”
Sherlock was running to the fresh crime scene, it wasn’t far from the church and he had an almost goofy grin on his face. Finally a crime scene and not just the sorry leftovers after all the officers had left. This was his chance!  Watson followed after, his shorter legs kept him a few steps behind the taller consulting detective.
“What are we looking for?” he spoke in a low voice.
“Yes” his curly head came into view now. This did not help her shivering; in fact it had the opposite effect.
You closed your eyes; sparing yourself what I was forced to watch.
“Gothic clothing found”. All these girls had been ‘Goth Girls’ as Lucy, her 17 year old daughter had informed her it was called apparently. Punk chicks, cyber… something? Was a completely different group of people all together. She shook her head and reached for her phone once more.
She heard the door creak and the man returned. His footsteps were slow and poised.
It happened so fast; one minute she was texting a friend of hers and the next she was shoved in a van and driven off. She hit her head as landed inside the vehicle and was knocked unconscious. She didn’t even get the chance to cry out.
Holmes had something to prove; to himself most of all.
“Homeless network John, they’re truly indispensable” Sherlock smiled. “If we’re quick we can make it there before Scotland Yard!” and the two men were soon out of the door.
Who had been holding him then?
“Yes DI Yellow?” she asked carefully.
“… yes” the shiver in Sherlock’s voice as he replied told John he didn’t really believe his own words… even with his inferior deduction skill he could tell that much.
“You don’t have to be alone…” she whispered. Her wide eyes met with his.
“I haven’t seen you in years” she pretended to overhear his observation.
When John decided there was room enough he decided to take mercy on poor Sherlock; whose hips were grinding back at him. His pale ass was trying to push back against John’s fingers to give him what he needed.
“Hey, hey… it’s okay” John continued to try to wrap his arms around his friend.
With his finger still on the book he twirled on his heels and faced the detective inspector; Lestrade and his own assistant; Doctor John Watson.
The woman fumbled to grab her morning pills and washed them down with the last swallow of the magical liquid.
“I was right about the telephone cord” he mumbled “And…” he was gently touching her pale hand. “A metal chain; thin but strong enough to support the weight of the body. It cut through the skin while she was still alive; waiting for him to kill her”. He was looking at the dried blood on her wrist.
“No?” Sherlock questioned baffled.
“That took a bit. Is everything all right?” Most of all she just wanted to get home… home to her shower.
“I was here. I was right here!” He pointed towards the bedroom. “All you had to do was tell me“ John’s anger was burning white hot.
“I am aware of your connection to the victim, but did you see it? Our killer needs them to stay awake; he has a message for those girls. My bet is a religious fanatic; often girls like these are unfairly mistaken for Satanists” he was talking fast and she swallowed.
“Might I help you?” the elderly man wondered. Sherlock took a good look at him before he answered.
“Mira is dead, Sherlock, you’re having an emotion” John told him walking over to him “This is normal, it’s part of the grieving process” he now stood right next to the world famous consulting detective who was shuddering, cringing and still had tears in his eyes.
Realizing there was not much more he could do until Cat at least answered his text Sherlock went to work on answering some of the backed up emails from people begging for his help to solve their mysteries…
She turned away; feeling conscious and fearing she looked as the fool she felt she was being and started fiddling with the front door to her building.
“I have seen you” her blood turned to ice in her veins. It physically hurt.
Suddenly he bolted towards the steps, crouched down and took a good look, his fingers carefully touching the dust.
And there stood a woman in the middle of the room… chewing the knuckle on her thumb.
“Are you getting any warmer??” She giggled dumbly towards the man on his knees.
“What’s that?” a sergeant had heard her gasp. She looked at him softly.
How she wished she actually did have that dog. She would bury her nose in the fur, hug it tightly… and someone would be glad to see her; without the prospect of her being able to offer more than her company.
She gave him a toothy grin.
“This lady says her furniture has been moved every night the past few months” The army doctor was desperately trying to distract the consulting detective who was bored out of his wits.
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes.
Who did she even have to call? She couldn’t exactly call Paul… that was not how it worked.
John had. Happily even. There was nothing John wouldn’t have been prepared to do to help him through it. And he had been so proud of Sherlock too; going full cold turkey took an inhuman amount of willpower.
He was right. As always.
“I need a real case!” Holmes was resembling a bratty four year old. A tall one though.
His long body felt heavy; and he relished that feeling. It allowed him to stay where he was; it slowed down his ability to act on the urges… the very urges that were always there in the background; no matter how hard he had tried to deny their existence.
The minute John returned Sherlock was on his way out and the two collided at the door.
He couldn’t risk the girl finding out he was a detective… it would put the entire case at jeopardy.
He had always had such a responsive and sensitive sphincter.
“I’m going to stop this no matter what it takes” DI Yellow turned stern and clinched her fist.
Ha. Now there was the butt of a cosmic joke.
His hands grabbed at her legs, digging his nails into her flesh.
Her brain did little to stop her from making the decision though… in fact it only supported her.
“The cocaine bottle was not meant for me” He decided he could just as well continue talking; perhaps that was the only way to get him unstuck.
Holmes groaned, rolled his eyes demonstratively but decided to comply.
He just looked at her; his face bearing an expression of both hate but also a hint of pity. The pity made her sick to her stomach.
Fuck you. Holmes. Fuck you.
“Sherlock do… do you need a break?” Watson was shivering slightly; not only over seeing that particular woman in that state but most of all to see Sherlock react this way. It was almost as if he cared.
“Lie down” John instructed the shivering figure huddled at the end of the bed.
She put her hair in the usual side-braid and left a strand of it to fall down over the side of her face; hoping it would hide that mark she was already all too tired of looking at.
It wasn’t impossible; but it was downright silly to have Sherlock struggle to strip out of them while being bound. John chewed his lip and without warning put his hands on Sherlock’s hips. Sherlock’s lips parted and he felt a tug in the lowest pit of his abdomen; his cock twitched.
“Thank you Donovan”. She couldn’t handle his methods right now and she knew it too.
“Because he undresses them?” Watson tried. Sherlock shook his head.
Her phone rang from her purse and with jittery fingers she searched for it in a panic. She picked up and didn’t even have to look at the caller ID to know…
He signalled the bartender who lazily scuttled over to their end of the bar. It being a weeknight meant the bar was near empty…
And suddenly it was over. She could move, she could fight… but the figure was gone.
“Daddy, please”.
“Just try it, please?” John managed to say before an unwanted yawn took hold of his jaw.
“Yes” Sherlock repeated his previous answer in the exact same tone. “You seem to care an awful lot though” his greenish eyes looked up at his friend, again making his deductions “You’re the one who’s been crying so I suppose I should be asking you?” there was a spite and a distance in his voice.
“Strong!” Holmes retorted, almost childlike.
“You are compensating… again” she looked into his eyes.
“You failed” he chuckled as he pulled his lips from Sherlock’s who was reluctantly letting him go.
“Such a shame, and she seemed so fond of you too” She knew when to leave him alone and dashed off. Sherlock was re-entering his mind palace but couldn’t find Mira anywhere. He was searching high and low.
“Is that John?” she called out to Sherlock who was still searching for God knows what. Oh, who even wanted to know…
He panicked the second he made the sound. No. Don’t stop now… please, please… not now. Damnit.
“Sherlock she is obviously high as a kite! You should not even be near something like that in your state! Why? Sherlock. Why?” John’s anger slowly turned to regret.
“Sherlock” John gasped. He was not in the mood for jokes. But it was true. She had already been pronounced dead once to the press; the illegitimate daughter of late media mogul Charles Augustus Magnussen.
Sherlock Holmes was far from perfect; but that was the point… and how he ended up in this situation… he was human. So very human. No matter how he tried to deny it.
John’s fists clenched.
His companion was reading a book in his usual chair. The fair-haired man looked up from a page and placed a finger to remember where he got to.
He breathed through his nose; she had managed to hit the nail on the head and he did not appreciate it.
And now Cat was shivering hard; the tears were pressing to fall. This was not what she ever signed up for.
He was digging his long nails in on the side where Paul had hit her; ripping through her skin, pulling it off in long shreds.
“Are you okay?” John stepped closer and put the glass down.
“You don’t think he…” The sister’s bloodshot eyes were wide.
The inspector entered the chamber just then, his eyes wide. He had seen Sherlock Holmes in many situations… but never this way.
“Just paying a visit to a very old friend” he gave her his best forced smile. It made him show his teeth; which always had reminded her of a dog… giving a final warning before he pounced.
There were things he never could fully delete; despite his skilled attempt of creating and maintaining the well-oiled machine that was his brain.
This whole thing was getting out of hand. But she just couldn’t say no. She couldn’t risk it… Maybe it was better to live with the pain she knew rather than face the unknown consequences…
“Where did you sleep last night, you did sleep?” She was scanning her own daughter; unsure what she was looking for. She couldn’t remember the last time she saw her smile.
Sorry for the hiatus. I haven't been doing too well lately. Things have been going on in my life recently, one of them being that not only was I finally officially diagnosed with PTSD (what I always knew I had...) I've been diagnosed with severe PTSD from chronic and repeated trauma; which in short means even with years and years worth of treatment I will never get much better no matter how hard I fight it.
This really was a ghost standing before her and he seemed to shrink before her…
“Mira Jensen, she’s been murdered. If you’ll excuse me!” he pointed at the door, wanting to be left alone. The elderly, kind lady turned white as a sheet.
How romantic.
You have to…
“Lucy?” she asked softly “I made breakfast” she heard a groan from within and five minutes later her daughter emerged fully dressed. Once again the girl went straight for the pancakes and emptied what she had left of the syrup.
Sherlock could not stop his brow from once again furrowing. All hearts are broken…
“Sherlock, I’m here?”
He didn’t want to remember more, but his head had another agenda… and back under he was dragged.
She was that easy to impress.
“One for me too. I’ll handle her tab” he turned to the bartender. internally he hated that he was forced to slur any bit of his brain with alcohol. But it was all for the good of the case.
She opened it with shaking hands; her finger twitching even worse than before.
“Yes” she swallowed “-Master” the word made her throat close. It was nauseating to her. Everything about it was.
Sherlock’s heart was racing already… the sweet anticipation of what John would do to him… and the danger of not knowing exactly what.
“Okay… fine then” the woman sighed, defeated.
“I have her in here” Sherlock pointed to his temple and stepped out of the cab that had come to a halt. Expecting his ‘assistant’; John Watson to pay the fare.
“So what came first?” he asked.
Sherlock and John were forced to return to Baker Street empty handed. DI Yellow was not ready to admit that she needed their help just yet. And Sherlock Holmes was not at all pleased.
He chuckled. This was her version of making up a boyfriend to get out of the situation.
The taller of them seemed to tiny. He was shuddering; his long fingers cramped and fiddled… seeming to grasp at something that wasn’t there.
She swallowed uncomfortably. There was another way to silence those thoughts… but it came with consequences and the breaking of a promise to herself.
She felt the urge to wrap her arms tightly around his lean form; press his head down against her chest and gently rock him back and forth while her fingers tangled in his curls... Just like she had done those nights so many years ago. Trying her best to comfort him…
“I…” she stuttered slightly and didn’t get further before he cut her off.
The light caught the wet film that laid over Sherlock’s eyes. And Watson’s sore jaw felt like it let go of its hinges.
“I thought you said she was strong” John bit the inside of his cheek. He knew what he had started. Molly was looking curiously at the two men.
“Off with your shirt” John stopped once the two of them stood in front of the bed. It was another breathy; begging order.
“Why did you need to know her stomach content?” Watson enquired in the cab. Sherlock was correcting his black leather gloves. His eyes spying a group of gothic clad young people; all smoking and having a laugh.
The girl with long black hair and purple highlights held her phone in her hand and bit into her bottom lip that had been painted black to match her hair and tightfitting dress. She rolled her eyes as she dialled her mother’s number.
Sherlock!
She nearly fainted when the door opened. The man smiled widely at her; hungrily… and oh he was.
The barman placed the drinks in front of them and she quickly grabbed hers and took a pensive sip. As if she was testing it for poison or worse.
“W-William?” she stuttered; her voice barely audible. She still hadn’t fully re-mastered it.
I tried to tell you. I let you in on my plan. Why. Why didn’t you see? Why didn’t you listen?
He was already wrapping his blue scarf around his neck and looked to his coat. John sighed and grabbed his own jacket.
After an arduous fight he shed the blanket and got up; wide awake.
“Oh” he looked at her with open mouth. He had apparently angered her. Perhaps he had dug too deep too soon. He still hadn’t gotten anywhere near what he really wanted from her.
“Last time I checked you didn’t do crack” he growled. Was that all he had to say? “Oh. You’ve been touch with daddy have you?” his eyes narrowed in on her.
“Careful!” John stopped Sherlock in his tracks. He didn’t seem to mind that he was walking on broken glass.
It wasn’t her naked skin he was sniffing…
She found the latest victim and carefully laid her on the slab, preparing her for the examination. Molly found herself procrastinating and taking her time with the external investigations. She was hoping Sherlock would burst through the doors and take over soon. Oh how she longed for company. His company to be precise.
“Kelly Middleton” she let him know as she finished opening the bag and positioned the body on the slab. Holmes was putting on his gloves and getting his magnifier out; ready to have a look.
Drip.
Like I said my updates might become slower and I'm sorry, firstly the medicine I take for my pain makes it harder to concentrate and then soon I have to work for the Eurovision Song Contest for 14 days, which is going to be insanely busy! Please bear with me!
“Thank you; I think we better stop here” Celia smiled kindly at the grieving sister and clicked the button that stopped the recording. “We’ll catch him I promise” She vowed as she showed her out.
“Hurt!?” Sherlock flinched. He surely meant angry, pissed, ticked off??
“I want you, Sherlock” She confessed; her body trembled and her hands reached for him; clawing at him; untrained even… She was grasping for more. Almost as if this was the first time…
“Don’t” Lucy stopped him and took a long puff on the cigarette. She knew who he was going to bring up. He had always liked Kelly; everyone but Kelly knew that.
“She’s already died once though…” the DI’s eyes widened “And I even spoke to her… She was Sherlock’s uh… how do I put this delicately, she worked for him” he coughed as he tried to explain their connection, the way he knew it at least.
Sherlock seemed so unaccustomed to the gentle touch; a thought that troubled the good doctor deeply.
Again…
Her lips curled into something that could be interpreted as a shy smile.
She spent the hours grooming and re-grooming herself. She plucked and removed hairs from places, re-did her makeup enough times… every time having a sinking feeling that if she made the smallest mistake she would pay for it.
“Again, who are you?” she was fuming. He winked at her.
She rolled his eyes at him… oh for fuck’s sake.
Cat had no idea how long she had been in the shower; how many times she had scrubbed herself and lathered herself in the rosy soap again… but in the end she gave up. She had to accept that she could never actually wash away what happened… nothing would take away the way she felt… she knew that all too well. It was a bitter pill she had swallowed before and that did not make this any easier for her.
And there he was sure he saw the walls of the imaginary structure crumble and waste away before him; as it had stood unused for far too long now.
“Sure” her smile was too kind. She grabbed a napkin and jotted it down. For a second she thought about adding a fake number… but she couldn’t even think of one. So it happened… the man got his way.
She staggered out of the booth and washed her hands thoroughly. And then once more before taking her medicine.
“That’s how boys play it, I believe” he winked his eye. He reached for her wrist and she immediately moved away; flinching.
“I’m… fine” she finally managed a small sentence without a stutter; unless you counted the pause.
“Why?” John heard the slight passive aggression in his own voice ”Why would you?” he took a step closer. Needing to see the picture in question.
It would be so much easier if we never met. If I had stayed alone. You weren’t happy when I told you this the last time; that alone protects me.
Holmes was now holding a few strands of her hair between his fingers before he took a stroll around her body. He went to the pile of clothes; the first thing he noticed was her black faux fur coat. He was nodding and obviously talking to himself inside of his own head. To the outside world he was almost painfully silent.
“Billy was good news for her; I’ve never seen her as happy as when she was with him. They split as friends though” She was drying her eyes.
John could count his ribs as well as he could read the scars; way too many for the average man his age.
Finally he got the words out. Finally he said what needed to be said.
A vein on John’s forehead was about to pop as well.
So he found a blanket and carefully laid it over him before going to bed himself.
“The woman didn’t even sniffle when I called her after that. So I wouldn’t bother” he looked at them and then at the dead woman. “Why her though?” his eyes narrowed.
Holmes didn’t even try to rectify the situation…
“Is something wrong?” ‘William’ sounded alarmed. “Are you safe?”
“She followed him down the stairs, he had a grip in her arm but she wasn’t struggling. Then again it wouldn’t be her style… he sat her down on the floor here” he was taking the same steps; pretending to be holding onto her.
Finding what he was looking for he drew a sharp breath. His entire body struggled against his will.
“And do you know why I’m hurt?” The shorter man crossed his arms over his naked chest.
“Sorry… Master” this time the word made a tear roll down her cheek.
“Sweep for witnesses; someone must have seen something!” she instructed. “Bag all of the evidence” she told continued. “We have to stop this” she was fired up.
Please take this away from me.
“Do you know her family, we will need to contact them” the DI whispered to Watson trying to give Sherlock Holmes peace to work.
In an effort to soothe him; and himself; John allowed his roughened fingertips glide over Sherlock’s white back.
John was filling him so deliciously… and when he pushed the deepest he was hitting the prostate.
“You’re a saint, John!“ he put the tea cup down.
She always got so fiddly in Sherlock’s presence no matter how hard she tried to ignore it. Dammit.
The woman was still holding her hands firmly to her ears. She looked absolutely frightened.
She heard the front door open and knew Jack was home. She put her phone away and stiffened her emotions.
Her eyes were dark; she was chewing her lip. It was clear as day she had been frightened out of her wits by this dream.
Trigger warning; if you struggle with SI I ask you to proceed with caution and stay safe!
And I saw it. John… The betrayal in your eyes when you realized what I had done. Did… did you think it was a trick? John… oh John. This wasn’t my plan. It shouldn’t have been like this at all.
Sherlock was sobbing helplessly and threw the letter opener away from him in disgust. He was covered in a cold sweat.
“I can have you taken off the case if it bothers you; last night I had to inform the parents of my daughters closest friend that they lost their daughter and I know my own daughter won’t be safe until the killer is brought to justice. Are we clear on that?” Her own stern stand against Donovan surprised herself. The sergeant was blinking. Nodded and walked off. Clearly not happy with the arrangement.
She gave a weak laugh as reply. Hoping her humours would soothe his moods…
He pulled awkwardly at the still open jacket, feeling it against his naked skin. He was just about to close the door behind him; headed for the stairs, for freedom.
Sherlock’s cock twitched and grew even harder; his back started to sway in the rhythm that John moved in as John was playing him like a string instrument.
“I meant to observe Ida using, as an experiment. I wanted to test how far I could go without succumbing to the temptation”. Holmes continued explaining calmly.
“What happened?” she tried to turn the tables; buying herself some dignity.
This might get a bit 'Johnlocky'
Jack was at work and she should have been in school. She hated school and especially all of the idiots there and right now that was the last place she felt she needed to be.
“What will it be? Tick tock; Mr Holmes”
Ida was a prime example… Once upon a time she had been a bright young woman with a future ahead of her… until a man she honestly thought loved her got her hooked on cocaine and morphine… all for his own pleasure. The drugs had slowly but surely fried her brain and only once in a blue moon did ghosts of her old self resurface.
“I love that song” she tried to compensate for her social anxiety by being the first to speak. Trying to persuade herself that it gave her some small advantage. An inch of control over the situation.
”I never did understand that” the voice continued ”All your scars; you never hide those from the world… but you can’t handle people seeing the rings under your eyes or thickened skin on your thumb” The voice became increasingly obnoxious to her.
But why she kept coming back he did not know… so… he took the case. What kind of hold did he have on her?
Sherlock nodded; wordlessly.
Her eyes grew wet as she sat there; alone with her useless thoughts.
He licked his teeth hungrily.
“You need to distance yourself from… that” John gestured towards her as discretely as he could. He could not deny he wasn’t exactly pleased about her presence for quite a few reasons.
Please. Please. I don’t want this. Stop this. End this!
“Maybe” he returned the banter.
What was left of him at all?
“Leila” he answered. Leaning in to get the rest of the line… this time his nose and lips travelled down towards her navel. She wriggled; his touch tickled.
“She was an asset” he let him know dryly.
“Why did he choose you?” he helped her on.
“Sherlock?” John tried to bring him back to the present. He carefully put his hands on his shoulders and kneeled down to his level.
“Don’t wait up.” Sherlock replied, though not to John’s observation.
“Does any of the regular churchgoers seem a bit on edge?” Sherlock was struggling not to let his annoyance show. Why didn’t people think?
His head was inside a cupboard; throwing out the interior not caring where it landed.
“We’re going home. Doctor’s orders. There’s more important things in this world” the soldier said bravely. Sherlock was still struggling with the words. He was still under the haze.
He bit his tongue. He did not like to admit his brain hadn’t been completely focussed.
While eating her breakfast she fidgeted with her phone and re-read that message again. She should probably reply to it… but what? How…
He finished himself and instantly got off her; standing himself up to close his pants. He ruffled his hair.
“Now it’s my turn, too” John reached for the lube and squirted some into his hand; lubricating his cock… making the next part of the game a little easier.
“You borrowed my aftershave again, did you?” John mused with a laugh. Ah, he was in a good mood was he? He must have seen that woman again. What was her name? The redhead! That was quite clear from the strand of hair on his coat.
“I’m off out. I’ll ask Mrs. Hudson if she’ll sort some lunch for you”
“Who cares what you think anyway?” She spat at him and out of the door she was, slamming it behind her.
“I’m sorry” Celia said carefully. “Do you think we could talk to him perhaps?” She coughed.
“My spine and hip happened” she took another swallow of the Rose. Drowning her useless bitterness.
Maybe sleep would take away the constant snigger of his needs… mocking him.
Her red lips surrounded the black straw and she emptied the liquid contents of the glass; not knowing how to react. She never did.
His finger that was still pressing against her clavicle bone made a film of tears cloud her eyes as her chest moved.
Sitting herself on her bed; the telly already running the tears clouded her vision again. She could feel his hands… she could feel him inside her…
Nearly dropping the keys to her little home she felt the tears begin to burn again. Her hands were shaking so hard she struggled to unlock the door.
John’s hands stayed on his hips; giving himself support behind his hard thrusts.
Who on the other hand hadn’t even flinched at the noise.
He pointed upwards… and with that he turned around.
She hadn’t even believed him when he warned her all those months ago. When he pinched her cheek and whispered to her that he was dangerous, and she probably couldn’t handle him. That she had no idea what she was getting herself into…
In the middle of it all; on the floor; sat Sherlock Holmes only wearing his pants.
“Are you sure about this?”
The truth is… it would have protected you. It would… It could.
The sting from the cut was pulsing. Spreading. Burning…
“It’s okay” she cooed at him. She reached out for the boy. Her arms embraced him hard; not wanting to let him go… not again.
“I should get home… it’s been a long day. Thank you for the drinks” she faked a smile that made her twitching lip strain.
“God no” John gasped. He was fighting with his own emotions; feeling everything at once. Pity, sorrow, anger and confusion.
“Don’t” he repeated. She took a step closer.
… and it broke her heart.
“Sherlock?” she gasped. It was always difficult to see him weak. He was Mr Smart-ass, always having a comeback remark…
“Haven’t you got anything?” John Watson was on his phone. “Sherlock seems convinced there’s a serial killer about”. He spoke in a hushed voice “No, no I understand”.
He was nodding off. As soothing as it was to Sherlock it was to him and far too soon for Sherlock’s liking he fell asleep.
“Thank you!” she cried as she was riding out the last of the cramps. Her body was aflame.
She wanted to scream at her own head to shut up with all that useless babble. Her eyes darted towards the window… and towards the kitchen that held the pill bottles…
Sherlock’s eyes widened; his own body reacted to what he had been proposed. His body temperature rose, as did every hair on his body; especially those on the nape of his neck. It was an interesting study in chemicals and hormones that played out within him.
There had even been a bit of a fight earlier… John; the eternally brave protector of human decency.
Damn it. This vow of silence would not be as easy as he had hoped…
Lucy scrambled out of the bed and decided to get dressed for school. She checked her phone just before she left her boyfriend’s flat. Her boyfriend was still fast asleep in the bedroom. No messages. Odd. She always woke up to several messages. But most of those had always been from Kelly.
“Do you live far from here? Maybe I should walk you home?” he stood up as she did.
I have several more chapters typed up, but I am attempting to post one per week (mostly on Thursdays) to assume a more steady posting schedule.
I keep seeing you. I see it over and over and over again. Your pupils dilating. You holding your breath; setting your shoulders… ever the soldier. Ever the soldier you were.
He looked longingly towards the exit of the hidden chamber.
Why did it have to happen this way. Why did it have to be you? And why did it have to be me?
If only there was a quick way to fix Holmes’ misery.
Lucy couldn’t fall asleep that night, she was lying in Jack’s arms but her head was full of way too many thoughts. Had she been at fault somehow? What did her mother mean exactly that they ‘found’ Kelly? She did know what her mother did for a living… her best friend had not only died. She had been murdered…
John seemed to bite back on a complaint… but he knew better by now. This behaviour was too imbedded in his friend.
That room.
The man growled as he kissed her again, this time with even more force. His hands hurriedly yet skilfully undid her jeans.
“Th-thank you” she stuttered and curiously put her hand over the point of contact.
“I’m afraid you have to leave now“ he let her know; with a calm force to his voice.
“He could have killed them right away, but he let them wait. He’s on a mission and killing them is only the last resort”. Sherlock was removing his gloves again and Molly looked up at him, slightly flustered.
She broke apart then; crying and sobbing loudly; her chest heaving as she struggled to breathe.
“This is me… thank you, William” she stopped abruptly and so did he.
He began beating her the best he knew how. She smiled even wider at each hit that landed on her pale skin.
You braced for the impact… you knew what to prepare for. And I saw you tried to be brave.
“I bloody miss her” he kicked the brick wall they were leaning against and growled irritably.
‘I couldn’t stop thinking about you. I really would love another chance to see you.
“What’s your name Miss, if I may?” The young redhead in uniform standing in the reception wondered ever so politely from behind her screen.
“My wall!” She shrieked and Sherlock groaned. He had her on a semi-permanent mute. Why could her silly attachment to the bloody walls take him right out of it? Not like this particular wall was even in a good state… bullet holes, spray paint and what not had damaged it over the years.
“Hills was gay, she had a girlfriend. Oh God. Don’t tell her parents!” his eyes widened. “I promised her I wouldn’t tell…”
But suddenly as he started he stopped… taking half a step back; locking eyes with a confounded Sherlock.
Oh thank goodness. He knew his patience was wearing thin for him tonight… this went much easier than he thought possible.
She had no idea how long she had been standing there.
“So a man, and he’d have to be quite strong?” Watson offered.
He ran his fingers over his arm, pressing his thumb hard into one of the track marks; one of the oldest ones. A sinister smile crept upon his plump lips; a smug smile he couldn’t wipe off.
Sherlock found himself at the boarding school, searching the den once more; his eyes half closed as he let his index and middle finger run over the leather bound books on the shelves… feeling for one that felt marginally different. Looking for the one that opened up to the secret chamber that he despite his best efforts remembered from his own time at this very institution.
“I’ll be there in 20 minutes, okay?” his voice sounded determined. He hung up before she ever got to say another word.
Baker Street had fallen silent; you could practically hear a pin drop. But the silence was soon interrupted.
And that was her problem… The same old problem.
“Please, don’t do this” she begged. Her wet eyes seemed to grow; perhaps in a subconscious attempt at persuading him to listen to her. “What about M-Mycroft?” The stutter made a reappearance.
“Also, I had an old debt to settle with her…” Sherlock’s voice trailed off.
He hardly looked at her as he began to move. Strong, long movements; knocking the air out of her. She was building fast, and so was he.
“A sample for an experiment” Holmes’ eyes burned into his. He was so matter-of-factly about it that it hurt.
“And you are?” She glared back at him. She did know who Sherlock Holmes was; but this was absurd.
“It’s just Lucy; she’s so angry with me like it’s my fault” she quickly took a sip of the magic black liquid trying to supress her emotions.
“You’re a sore advocate of sobriety!” he snapped cruelly.
“Listen” she looked back at him. “I have a dog” she blurted out. “He doesn’t like men… he’d bite you…” she stumbled over the words; shaking heavily by now.
I need to run errands kill the time
Moriarty takes out a silver cigarette case out of his suit pocket. It shimmers in the rainbow afterglow of the lamp. He takes his time to fish out a long thin slim.
and the calls and the posters and the theater the tickets the snow the show I'm currently writing something on
The cough is sickly dry and painful, coming from the depth of your chest. You feel like dying.
You're a freak and the watery trails taste of salt and lemon.
my cold skin
Another sneeze that leaves you dazed for a moment.
a spell a letter the pitter-patter of laughter breath enclosed in the other's breath
I don't really know what I need
John rolls his eyes at you but there is defensiveness in the gesture you don't usually see in him these days. You can see his fingers curl slightly underneath the plain material, his facial muscles tightening. "You're not the only one living there, you know. I have every right to-"
