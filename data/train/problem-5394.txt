. Zemo.” Tony shifts to lean back on his elbows. “I went to see him on my extended Christmas vacation.”
It took him too long to realize that about Tony, it occurs to him that maybe Tony doesn’t know that about him.
Steve can see the evidence of their (his) failure shining out of Stark’s eyes and Stark huffs out a laugh of victory when Steve has to violently wrench his gaze away. He finds himself staring at the shield lying on the couch. This morning he found it bundled in a burlap bag and resting against his door. It used to be Captain America’s shield. It’s corrupted now; dark flecks of long-dried blood spill across the white star and scorch marks from repulsors have obliterated the paint in places. The scour marks from T’challa’s claws mar the perfect geometry, throwing off its balance. There’s a shallow dent in the rim where vibranium met starkium and won.
Steve's fists clenched. “I’m not following you into that swamp if your plan is to just wander around and hope to bump into the exit by accident!”
Steve walked on ahead along the spine, his voice floating downwards. “Because they’re not trenches.”
Steve had rasped. He was never good with words and putting them to paper twice had been like getting blood from a stone.
“An angry AI gave me your name and I trust her judgement.” He looks up and Francesca doesn’t bat an eye. “I don’t really know how this is supposed to work.”
There’s an amber bottle nestled underneath a lawn chair stationed to the right. It’s only been an hour at most and Steve tries to calculate the damage Tony’s done to it in that time. He tries to rein in the ball of regret/anger/disappointment that threatens to consume him. He must not be doing a very good job. Tony’s fingers twitch like he wants to hide the glass in his hand before he redirects the impulse.
“We expect continued deterioration until the 16th, that’s the anniversary. Knowing Tony Stark’s in the building can’t help, but it is what it is…”
It’s not a voice Steve wants to hear. He leans his forehead against the bag and relishes the sound of his own heavy breathing. He doesn’t dare look up. “Did you come down here to enforce it?”
Steve has no idea what it is. There’s truth in it though: knowing is the first step. He stokes all his courage for one more question:
The session room reasserts itself. His mother dissolves last, lingering. It could drive a man mad to see his life through these glasses. Steve could replay every instant of his life. Every poor decision, every regret. He can go dancing with Peggy and catch Bucky from falling but it won’t be worth the tradeoff of seeing the truth laid bare in his own memories. Of having the nostalgia peeled off his childhood and opening the endless doors of paths not taken.
Natasha comes back with the jet, alone and a little worse for wear. She gives Steve a slight nod but marches straight down to Tony’s workshop. The metal doors slide open and poised at the threshold, she hesitates (and the Black Widow never hesitates) before she disappears inside. Steve never learns more and neither deign to tell him.
He had expected the lab to be deserted. It wasn't. Bucky was busy checking his knives, Logan was replacing his cowl, Bruce, Strange and Richards were working fast and silently. All of them turned when Steve entered.
"Is it Betty?" Steve asked, aware as he said it that the question was too invasive for a man as private as Bruce. “Is there anything the Avengers can do? I can do?”
the problem?” Stark asks, somewhat incredulous. “I could give Barnes the comfiest, spiffiest arm in the known universe and he’d still occasionally forget who you are.”
Tony figures out what they are easily enough. “No.” He tosses them both toward the hole and they flutter down into the gym where they started.
“You’ll what?” Stark tilts his chin up defiantly. There's a burning gleam in his eyes and it could be a scene from six months ago, six years ago, when they were nothing but their worst qualities.
“No." Tony's breath hitched. "Barnes and Logan know, obviously. Bruce and Stephen, for medical reasons. Reed because he was excited to take his family exploring through the veil and I kind of… lost it at him.” Tony’s smile was plastic. “I’m aware that sounds like the Jeopardy answer to
“I can’t sleep in this place,” Steve confessed. The hushed words rustled past Tony’s ear and he wasn’t sure if he was meant to hear them or if they were meant for a dead man.
Steve can’t think of a good enough reason to deny him. The man moves the kettle off the burner and Steve tenses, anticipating an attack that never comes. The stranger just pours the hot water into the waiting cup.
Suddenly the session room is flooded with holographic light, engulfing them both. The images shimmer, semi-transparent and fragile. It’s a scene from a Christmas long ago: the dining room of the old house in Brooklyn with the slanted floors and thin windows that let the cold creep in. The table before them is set for a festive dinner, the rug at their feet is threadbare and faded.
In the morning Tony was gone and there was blood on the sheets. His wound had reopened sometime during the night.
The string at Steve’s core tightens and he doesn’t know why. He’d never begrudge Tony his own reconciliation. “Tony must be happy.”
Steve stared at his own hands gripping the steering wheel at ten-and-two and resisted the urge to hide them. There was no way to win. He wasn’t the one playing.
Steve didn’t recognize his own voice, distorted by the primitive force of his nature. All the Avengers took a half-step back. All except Tony.
“You offered whatever I wanted,” Steve reminds him mildly as he tries to clear the remaining bedsheets out of the way.
They went back. Steve had braced himself for a trial or a fight or forgiveness. He meticulously planned what he’d do if he got each one. He’d stepped off the plane onto US soil and surrendered himself, literally and metaphorically, to the powers that be.
“Everything’s going to be alright,” Tony said with perfect sincerity. Then he stepped over the edge into the heart of the fire as Steve screamed.
Tony comes with his eyes closed, breath stuttering. Steve studies his face. There should be revelation. Instead he learns nothing.
Stark leans himself back on his heels and for the first time Steve thinks of the discomfort kneeling might bring. Tony just bows his head, pink tongue flicking out as his lips twitch into a half-smile. Steve smiles softly back. The moment should be massively awkward but it’s not. It’s nice. This place between them that doesn’t exist in anger or suspicion.
Steve looks out over Francesca’s garden at the colours exploding in sequence. Green, blue, purple, violet, magenta, black, orange, yellow, red, pink, white, teal -
“Turn it off.” Steve’s voice rings out, clear and strong, and for an instant it’s like the past six months never happened. The agents leap into action, scurrying to unplug the set instead of wasting time trying to find the remote. The news anchor blinks out of existence. The chastised agents turn to face them and Steve can still taste the threat of bile at the back of his throat. “I’m sure you all have better things to be doing.”
Tony slid into the booth opposite. “If you’re avoiding coming back to the Mansion because you’re still pissed at me, we should trade places. I’ll take the sad road trip. I’m on medical leave anyway.”
He turns and gives Steve the same small utterly insane grin he sometimes got when he said yes to Steve’s riskier plans. The truth of it shines, bright and pure; all he has to do is say the word and Bucky’s all in. He’d forgotten that loyalty like that existed.
“I just - They’re out there. All of them. The people I hurt.” Bucky pulls himself inward. “There’s no coming back from that but I thought: if just one of them could forgive me it’d be enough. And if Tony could, then anyone could right?”
“Steve,” Tony rasped. His lip was red where he’d bit it and there was a smattering of deep angry scratches around his mark, some of them still bleeding sluggishly. Heats weren’t painful in and of themselves but someone could hurt themselves trying to fight one.
She doesn’t answer but Steve is already up and moving. The stranger startles, his cane slipping to the wayside as he trips backwards, and Steve’s muscle memory causes him to reach out and catch him before he hits the tile floor. Up close the stranger looks just as old and ill-prepared for a fight as he did from a distance.
“What? You expect me to believe you’re on my side again?” Tony says snidely as Natasha draws her hand back.
Steve wants to know when Tony started experimenting on himself. When he decided to double down on the machine over the man to make up for the flaws he sees in his own humanity. How long he's been this in disguise: a man who cannot afford to trust and so made himself into someone who never had to.
The non-answer floats in the silence between them. Bucky's recently started wearing his prosthetic again. He picks up the basketball and sinks a shot from the three point line. It’s an easier feat with two arms.
It was the silence that woke Steve. Tony’s footprints weren’t hard to track in the light dusting of snow and Steve found him standing in front of the large stone church. From inside the candlelight and dulcet tones of a service escaped. Tony seemed hypnotized, breath rising like smoke.
“Tony?” Steve tried gently as he turned off the cold spray. He could tell the exact moment the scent of encroaching alpha reached Tony because his head snapped back and hit the tile. The spike of terror was immediate and Steve could see him valiantly battle it back down as reality imposed itself.
“You owe me a shirt, Rogers,” Tony’s hand relinquishes its grip as he slumps to the floor in a heap, “and a fucking
For a moment Tony’s expression is openly miserable before it slides into resignation. “Finally he admits it.”
He grabs the sketchbook and wanders the halls until he finds himself in front of the guest room at the top of Tony’s workshop. He pushes open the door and finds Tony slumped inelegantly at the foot of the bed. Steve’s gaze immediately searches for the liquor bottle but it’s much worse than that. Tony’s staring off into space wearing the black BARF frames, fingers rubbing worriedly at his temple. He opens a pill bottle one-handedly and dry swallows two small white capsules.
know.” She looks every inch as exhausted as three bullets to the abdomen will make you. “Tony very rarely seeks out help but miracles happen and the only thing I had to do was prevent you from sticking your nose where it didn’t belong. And I failed.” She tucks her tongue behind her teeth. "I thought even if you didn’t trust Tony, you’d trust me.”
Steve’s fists clench in automatic reflex because it’s not like that and how dare Stark suggest it is.
The scene is glitchy in addition to impossible. The glasses aren’t meant to splice together so many individual memories. Limbs pass through each other, feet don’t touch the floor, but it almost doesn’t matter because the feeling is there.
Tony halts and grinds his teeth. Steve can hear it from here. “Fan-fucking-tastic,” he mutters as he finally comes to a stop in front of Steve, nearly chest-to-chest as if their height differential means nothing.
Steve couldn’t argue with that but he hated the helplessness. “Shouldn’t you be in there in case something goes wrong?”
“Fine. Have it your way,” Tony growls irritably. He untucks the tail of his shirt and starts undoing buttons, right there in the corridor in the world’s most impersonal striptease.
The exhaustion they felt was purely psychological when they stopped to rest in a section of what Tony supposed had once been a mausoleum and was now more ruins. Slabs of marble and limestone had been pried off tombs and strewn about. Some were inscribed with a script Tony couldn’t decipher, others were burnt and covered in ash as if lightning or fire had erased them.
It's quick escalation, even for them, and Steve gentles Tony with a hand on either side of his face until he loses that edge of manic desperation. This close Steve can smell Stark's cologne, spicy and earthy, strange on his skin. Tony always wore clean, breezy scents because Pepper preferred them and Tony preferred Pepper. The change isn't good or bad just disquieting. Tony pulls Steve’s T-shirt off him but when Steve moves to reciprocate Tony sidesteps out of the way. That's not unusual either, there are days when one or the other can't deal with added vulnerability. Steve draws back until he can see what the dim lights of the workshop hid: the dark circles under Tony’s eyes, the gelled hair, the red mark -
Steve wants to feel an ache, a yearning, even anger at the thought that the council think they can take that from him. Instead he feels… nothing. No relief, no stress, no indignation. No happiness either, but Steve never had a lock on America and would never claim to.
Steve has no power here - the shine came off Captain America long ago - but for a single instant when he’s faced with a sea of shocked faces he thinks,
In a daze Steve prints off everything he needs. FRIDAY has to direct him into the basement to find a printer because such a process is considered antiquated. He wants there to be reams of information but instead everything he finds fits comfortably in a small folder. He doesn’t know what to do with it. Natasha is his best bet but both her and Tony must already know and neither will take well to Steve's investigation. Grzegorz Kowalczyk is not yet on the official list of the Winter Soldier’s victims which means Bucky might not even know. Cataloguing the Soldier’s assassinations is a process and it’s lower in priority to stabilizing his mental state.
“Which time?” Steve asked. He knelt at the edge of the crevasse and even this close to the heat he felt only ice. He was so tired. “I have so many to choose from.”
Tony catches him. “I swear to God, if my AI is turning into an evil Mexican supervillain and you don’t tell me - “
. It was melting, trickling down the back of his undersuit. He’d landed in a snow bank. He greedily stuffed a handful into his mouth and relished the refreshing cool water. It felt amazing against his sore, burned feet and down his abused throat.
He didn’t hang up. With Tony’s voice in his ear Steve could pretend Tony was here with him. He could pretend he wasn’t alone in this new crowded Hell they just called life.
The stench of decomposition hit Tony at once as he sank into the putrid soil. They weren’t trenches, they were graves.
“Do you remember how to leave yet?” Steve asked and there was a word floating at the edge of Tony’s periphery, that magic key that would unlock the Ether and send them home. Steve looked at him. “You do, don’t you.”
The undersuit stuck to Tony’s wet skin as he wrestled it on. The material was a thin black blend shot through with electric blue but it felt as good as armour - bare feet be damned.
The sarcasm lacks bite, it sounds more lightly deprecating than anything else. Steve wonders how much of that shift is in tone and how much is in interpretation. If the flaw exists in the object or in the eye of the beholder.
There is no plan, no mission. He leaves with the clothes on his back and nothing more. He runs for hours and it feels like the freedom he chases in his dreams. He picks the most scenic routes, Ross be damned. Eventually he slows, revelling in the soreness of tired legs as he walks along the gravel shoulder, aimless except for the mantra of
“I told Lewis I was playing with the GPS responder in the suit and it didn’t quite pinpoint my location as precisely as it should have.” Tony gives a small smile. “Good thing no one’s in the North Wing gym at one in the morning. No harm, no foul.”
There’s a split second of silence before blue screens light up the nearest platform. Pictures and articles about the nineteenth annual Founder’s Gala held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, including several photos of Tony arriving solo.
Rock salt crunched under their tires as they approached the city in bumper-to-bumper traffic. It was snowing but the white flakes were swallowed by asphalt. The Mansion fared no better; icicles hanging like daggers, footprints tracking dirt in worn paths. It was beautiful in the way only reality could be: in the eye of the beholder who knew it as Home.
She lets go of his arm and backs away to plant herself between them and Tony. Steve doesn’t move. His limbs feel like lead and his head is swimming.
Every bit of Steve comes alive at once, his muscles tense. “What kind of doctor did you say you were?”
Second chapter up and done. Weekly updates until it's finished. This is the longest thing I've ever written but I want to actually share it so it 'counts'. I feel like this story could be called
“Rogers nearly took my head off in Siberia.” Tony knuckles are white around the handle of his coffee mug. “He beat me so hard my helmet cracked open, aimed for my head and then drove my father’s last gift to him an inch and a half deep into the arc reactor because your shared secret blew up in everyone’s faces.” His left hand is shaking uncontrollably. “
The swamp arose out of the barren flats like a stinking oasis, the stench permeating the stagnant air only when they were nearly upon it. The surface was opaque and gave the impression of being nearly solid due to the decaying layers of floating peat. Thin browning grasses that may have once been reeds were petrified at the edges in clusters. It extended as far as the eye could see.
“That’s not enough and whoever taught you it was was an asshole.” Tony stands abruptly and his left hand is shaking. “Don’t come back this time, Rogers. Don’t send me a letter or a goddamn flip phone. Just find yourself a nice block of ice and bury yourself at sea.”
It all comes spilling out on Tuesday because Bucky can tell something’s wrong. “What do you think he wants?”
“Well it’s a good thing neither of us break promises,” Tony says, words dripping in sarcasm. “So it’s definitely not because you’re convinced I’ve turned myself into an abomination and you can’t stand to touch me.”
The Belgians have the civilian population of Antwerp to worry about and Steve understands that - he does - but it means they’d rather to let Reslen slip away rather than risk casualties. It’s an easy decision to make. They don’t know Bucky. They know of him and they don’t care and if no one else is in Bucky’s corner then it’ll be Steve alone because Bucky deserves at least that.
There’s a moment of silence and then the aggression bleeds out of Stark until he just looks exhausted. They don’t need this: the argument or anything more but Tony is clearly gunning for both. He might get his wish: Steve can't bring himself to look at Stark for long, at his body littered with reminders that Tony let himself be touch and marked and used by a stranger. Steve's not so far gone that he'll begrudge Tony his freedom but he resents it just the same.
“Reed’s right, it’s not your call.” Stephen’s voice was resigned. “It’s Tony’s choice. He deserves those.”
Steve curls his hand lightly around the left side of Tony’s neck to hide the red from view. The other finishes unbuttoning the dress shirt and underneath he finds another bite high on Tony’s abdomen and light bruising around his left nipple. That's all. Steve’s left him in worse shape accidentally and he fights the urge to do so again on purpose. To lay his own marks overtop existing ones until pink deepens to purple, to black, until Tony is marked so far under the skin he remembers even once the bruises fade. If Steve can’t ever forget how Tony looks/sounds/feels, then Tony doesn’t get to forget the reverse, not even for a night -
, for all the good it did me.” The words hit Steve like a punch to the gut but Tony just drew himself taller. “So where does that leave me? Any other words I’m not allowed to use? I begged him to stop a lot, maybe that word should be stricken from - ”
There were no bodies, nothing to indicate the Iron Knights had been anything but hollow from the start. The trees had eaten their fill and were wearing their trophies: a feast for flora in the absence of sunlight.
It’s no reprieve that the man’s scarcely around to rub it in. Even in his absence Steve can feel the spectre of Tony Stark looming over him. It’s baked into the clean lines of the Compound’s design and the array of takeout menus on the fridge. In the inexhaustible supply of food and heat and creature comforts that serve as markers of his omnipresence. It shouldn’t matter: Stark’s housed, clothed, deployed and paid Steve to varying degrees since he woke. Only now is it oppressive, knowing how little Stark thinks of him. It exceeds common decency in sinister ways.
Steve surveyed the crowded whiteboards, the running clocks, and came to the one conclusion he could. “How long has this been going on?”
Steve watched the armour articulate as Iron Man continued to blast their foes left and right, protecting them both. A whirligig of red and gold, of blood and money, of wrath and pride. The robot swarm closed in.
Steve catalogues all the differences between the Tony of his memories and the one standing in front of him. The laugh lines around still wary eyes, the pressure point at his temples that relaxes the tension through his jaw. He has a handful of grey hairs that look silver surrounded by a sea of dark brown. He studies every aspect closely; the sharp lines, the textures, the colours. He needs the memory of
Tony’s lips quirked, mind decidedly unchanged. “Maybe. But we’ll never find out.” He got to his feet. “You’re not going to Hell, Steve, and I don’t believe in the afterlife. We settle our scores here or not at all.”
He can tell from the glassy look in Tony’s eyes that he doesn’t believe him and Steve can’t do anything about it. He can’t point to his track record or his good word. He can’t lie and say he’s happy, or that everything’s working. He just has to wake up every morning and stay. And day by day he does.
Steve tucks the blank envelopes next to his heart. One for each of the deaths that left Tony an orphan at seventeen. Howard and Maria are dead ends; left to linger in the written words of their killer and the complicated brilliance of their son.
” The curse was the barest whisper, like Tony hoped not to be heard. Steve supposed in the Dark Ages such caution was warranted.
With Natasha still off active duty they’re forced to call in reinforcements and Steve’s nervous. Beyond Fury’s initial meddling, the Avengers have always had pretty much carte blanche when it comes to field personnel. They adopted Natasha and Clint from SHIELD, they were there for Wanda, for Vision. It’s not like Steve made those decisions alone but as Field Leader he always got a vote.
“On my way.” Tony punctuates that statement with a swallow from his glass. “FRIDAY already notified Natasha and I’m shut out of the workshop ’til I’m sober.”
“That makes it better? You not being as irresponsible as you could be? You’re an Avenger. You don’t get to opt out and break all your promises because you can’t handle the world sober. You need to be better than that.”
Steve avoided sleep. In the Ether it had been all he’d wished for and now it tempted him with its ease. Beckoned him to abandon the waking world for a dreamscape made of nightmares. He walked the city at night instead. The looming buildings hemmed him in on all sides and the air was filled with the rumbling noise of a dormant civilization awaiting the bugle call of the Reveille. The modern artifice of glass architecture reminded him not one whit of the infinite, open landscapes of Hell.
Tony throws him a look. “There’s a decent chance we’ll never see her again. She might be on a beach with Barton, or Bruce. Or Fury. I’m more upset she’s stolen my 100 million dollar jet. For peace-of-mind reasons I don’t like to be missing more than one of those at a time.”
“All I can do is be here for him if that changes.” He’s been waiting for Bucky’s treatment to fall through since they arrived. It’s exhausting, being on alert for so long.
“Please,” he pleads softly and Stark’s head jerks up like he’s been slapped. “You're angry. Don’t take it out on him.”
The first night he can’t sleep he doesn’t try to find Tony. He doesn’t end up uninvited in the North Wing either. He wanders through the very back of the living quarters until he finds himself knocking on an unfamiliar door.
Steve hasn’t called him by his last name in months. Tony’s eyes narrow and he drops the act pretty damn quick. “Of course you can, Rogers. I bought you.”
Tony smiles and it’s utterly empty. “If only there was someone here who could step up in my absence,” his head lolls toward Steve, “but he won’t. He’s too much of an asshole and that’s coming from
Steve felt a gauntleted hand grab his drawn-back fist. The Iron Man armour managed to shine through the layer of guts and blood overtop. “She’s down. You don’t do this, Steve.”
Steve doesn’t know if he’d have preferred someone random or someone better. Either would be an improvement over knowing Tony chose his married, ex-childhood friend to fool around with at the Founder’s Gala. It feels like regression, like everything Tony learned after Afghanistan, after Pepper, is coming undone and leaving the alcoholic homewrecker behind.
Steve says brokenly, breath fogging in the cold. He’s clutching a bouquet tight to his chest, an offering to lay at the graves of those he has trespassed.
Clint looked up. “It’s spooky when you do that. It’s not mine. With that bruise you’re sporting you sure it’s not yours?”
He was still a liar. He’d lied to Steve before about greater things. So Tony had taken this secret and buried it deep while on the surface he remained more or less functional. Steve had seen the ragged edges of the wound and dug his thumbs in. He’d thought he was being kind.
He points. “First percentage is the naked probability the Avengers will be granted permission to enter.” The boldest one over Maldecia reads 8.08%. “The second is the probability they will treat us as hostile in the future if we violate Maldecian sovereignty.” Those numbers range wide, from near certainties on either extreme. The US, Steve learns, won’t really care but most of South America will turn on a dime.
“You tend to get bad around here,” someone said sympathetically as Tony reached out to stabilize himself.
“Hands,” Tony bites out when they break for air which isn’t the order Steve thought was coming next.
It’s a wonder Stark’s lies fool anyone. Steve doesn’t really want to hurt him, he just wants to prove his point so he reaches across the gulf between them and presses two finger to the blue of Stark’s ribs -
“You’re too late, Avengers!” Sin crowed from the balcony above the melee. “In a few minutes I’ll have freed my father and you will all pay!”
“You’re not subtle. I only got bruises on the days after you visited Barnes because I’m still good enough for sex but you can’t stand to look at me. I voice an opinion you don’t like, you crowd me against a wall and choke me on your dick. When you can’t sleep, or when Natasha ignores you, or when you’re just bored, you come around and pick fights. When I actually manage to do something
There’s a hesitation in Tony’s shoulders before he shrugs which Steve knows that means Tony’s allowed himself to hope. “Natasha’s clearly already in contact with Clint.”
“Don’t leave me,” he rasped. Tony was always leaving him: slipping from innocence into remembrance and then into half-death once more. Steve was the one who stayed and counted cycles and retrieved bodies and built cairns. “You promised you wouldn’t leave me!”
It was slow going at Steve’s pace but eventually Tony’s words proved prophetic and the marsh underneath them solidified into solid ground once more. The crumbling remnants of a red stone wall marked the edge of the bog and beyond that was the downslope of a large escarpment running all the way from East to West if cardinality could be forgiven. The gradual downward tilt made the walking easier and the funneling escarpment gave at least the illusion of marked progress.
That was why Tony came: to pay his dues for his final sin. For leaving Steve behind and saving his life because for all of Tony’s talk of the randomness of the universe he believes in justice. Tony had been Steve’s keeper in the Ether but Steve had been Tony’s too.
Bucky visits Steve now instead of the other way around. Twice a week he has meetings with his lawyers at the Compound. He never brings up Steve’s feelings and he never acts any differently. They soldier on.
“I can’t control the fucking weather!” Stark takes a step closer, ignoring the warning etched in Steve’s hunched shoulders. “I’m not the Typhoon-whisperer, you need Thor for that!”
Tony tears his eyes away to look at Steve and for once his gaze is unguarded. He looks broken; like Steve’s buried his shield into Tony’s heart and started to dig. Ages ago Steve would have said it was a fitting reply to a damaged shield left outside a door. Now that he actually sees the pain writ large he wants nothing to do with it. He doesn’t know beyond begging for a time machine how to make things better. He needs to say something but it feels like there’s a lead anvil sitting on his chest.
He stops at a tiny roadside diner because he’s hungry and because he can. He has his pick of empty tables and slides into a cheap plastic booth. The lone waitress doesn’t recognize him: he’s nobody without his shield and cowl, just another bearded tourist passing through. He orders a single coffee with his only cash and watches a baseball game on the TV mounted in the corner. The coffee is watery and burnt but the free cherry pie the waitress brings him is sweet enough for both.
Steve’s chest seizes. Holograms are just light; there’s no way Steve can smell the smoke from rendered fat burning, or feel the vibrations through the floorboards from the wheeze of the radio below. He doesn’t need to look to know that around the corner will be the kitchen with the single basin sink and immaculate dishes. Upstairs will be Steve’s room with his mother’s just down the hall...
Steve weighed what Tony’s word was worth in this empty place, then he nodded reluctantly. Tony turned in the anointed direction and the two of them struck out across the muddy flats towards an as yet invisible exit. Tony walked just far enough ahead to maintain the careful charade that he knew where he was going. Steve stood just far enough away to be out of Tony’s reach. They trudged for hours in silence. Every time Tony opened his mouth the tension in Steve’s shoulders warned him off. If Steve had indeed met a tree in this place it was no longer to be found on the horizon.
That’s not what it is. For so long none of it was real. Steve had carried the past with him like a scar nobody could see. He’d begun to think he’d imagined it: all the good parts and all the bad; like it was a particularly vivid story written down in a book, like it wasn’t his life.
“Happy now?” Tony asks. The answer is obviously no and it’s little relief Stark isn’t happy about it either. “Am I at least allowed coffee?”
Then he sleeps like the dead. Twelve hours, thirteen. Another two of just staring at the white ceiling wondering how much longer he can do this. Everyone’s alive, life spins on. All Steve has to do to preserve this truce between himself, Tony, and the world is
Tony closed his eyes and consciously relaxed. “I trust you. I know that wasn’t enough for you before.” His lips twitched in a defeated half-smile. “I’m sorry. For all of this.”
“Seattle. Business. He said you could use a break from him.” Sam raised an eyebrow. “He didn’t mention it?”
It’s a portrait of a moment that doesn’t deserve to be memorialized: Tony in a badly lit Siberian bunker in the instant after he learned everything, the instant before everything went to hell. (Steve remembers raising his shield, falling a half-step back, anchoring his boots.) It’s only now once Tony’s staring back at him from the paper that Steve can tell what he’s thinking.
“You called, I came,” Tony says casually like he’s unaware of the significance of that. He looks around at the decor; the wicker furniture and portraits of flowers. “You going to tell me why I’m rescuing you from what are clearly the clutches of a little, old lady?”
It’s a repeat of an expose from four years ago that the news cycle has dragged back into relevance. It casts her as little red riding hood and the hungry wolf alike, complete with speculative commentary and interviews from those few who have claimed to have survived her. The names of her alleged victims scrawl across the bottom of the screen like ticker tape. It makes the list seem endless.
He says it like Steve’s the problem. He’s not worried at the appearance of the Winter Soldier or whatever is controlling his suit. He’s scared of Steve which means -
The artist in Steve had thought seeing Tony in the present would help. To see him without that expression of terrifying nihilism mixed with heartbreak that Steve can draw from memory alone. Instead it hurts in an entirely different way.
He sounded so miserable, eyes squeezed shut and teeth clenched. He hadn’t let himself relax at all. They were trapped in a nightmare and while Tony could rest if not sleep, Steve was denied any such comfort. Tony’s guilt felt like slick tar clawing its way up his esophagus, bubbling up from the infinite pit in his stomach. It would be unfair not to ease the frustrations of the man Tony had dragged into this place with him.
It shouldn’t be Tony but goddamn it if Steve won’t finish the job. He’s nowhere near as experienced as Stark so he just jerks Tony off, scraping his own fluids off Stark’s abdomen to use as lubrication. Tony lets his head fall backward against the wall and finally stops talking but the sharp breaths he takes are still too loud for Steve’s comfort. He knows it’s not the forties but anything not furtive and quick still seems decadent and inefficient. It’s not Stark’s fault he grew up in different time but it’s yet another incompatibility. When Steve did this last it was with -
“I believe you,” Steve said. The lingering effects of the bondshock Tony was still clearly in denial about more than explained the nausea. The lack of sleep couldn’t help.
There’s not another soul in the kitchen. It’s empty, but not quite. There’s a slight hum and the screen behind Steve lights up in blue. It’s a list of names, all with the prefix Doctor and with their SHIELD background checks attached. Steve has been trapped under FRIDAY’s watchful eye for an entire year and even if she wasn’t speaking to him she saw all of it and she never got to turn away. It’s no mystery why she hasn’t forgiven Steve.
Steve tries not to think about his loss of restraint in Stark’s office. It’s an aberration, a mistake, and not even the most significant one in his relationship with Tony. Steve hasn’t been avoiding him but their routines have always carried them in different circles and while in the past that had worried Steve, now he’s grateful for it. Because while he may have told Stark to forget it Steve finds that he cannot. He fixates like he used to do with the Avengers’ battles; replaying it in his mind, picking apart what missteps were made and how best to correct them.
“Stark’ll do it.” It’s the only answer Steve can think of off the top of his head. “He’s good at it.”
Steve could give a man time to grieve. He changed the subject. “What was it like on the other side?”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. No need to work yourself into a twist. It just chafes a bit.” The new arm is fiberglass and plastic and silicone, built for comfort and designed by doctors. That doesn’t make it faultless.
He ran and as he ran the stars started falling. Bright flaming meteorites emerged from the grey cloud cover and rained down unhurriedly. Each ball of cold flame traveled along its personal trajectory slowly enough you could step between them before they hit the ground and fizzled out. Lit by the falling flares the forest shadows waxed and waned as the embedded pieces of armour glittered like jewellery hung about a lady’s throat.
The awful truths he learns about Stark are second only to those he learns about himself. It feels like everything good in him is becoming corrupted. When Tony’s snide remarks hit too far below the belt he can’t stop himself from asking
Stark smiles, properly bitter, but at least he still sounds like Tony. “What you told me to. I made myself
It’s easy after that to fall into old patterns, worn over but not forgotten. They migrate to the kitchen and miracle of miracles no one follows them.
“Tony didn’t tell you,” his voice cracks. Maybe this is his punishment for getting it wrong the first time. He has to break the news to another son about the death of his father.
That’s when he saw the bite: the blush pink of a bondmark at the crux of neck and shoulder, years old. Tony’s throat had been bare when he left.
“I didn’t guilt trip them. I told them the truth.” Steve leans his forearms on the railing safely separating his level from Stark’s. “If they feel guilty that’s because they’re good people.”
Tony hears a rebuke where there isn’t any. “Look Rogers, I don’t care. I like it even,” he adds with a wolfish grin but Steve doesn’t know if he can afford to believe it. “AIM just has shitty timing and got in a lucky shot. Medical won’t miss me.”
Strange’s eyes narrowed and Steve bristled. He felt his grip on himself loosen against his will. He loomed over the sorcerer, voice harsh. “Where’s Tony?”
The question was worrisome in its seriousness. Bucky needed the answer and he needed the answer to be good.
Steve had tried in the beginning. The Accords could wait for the more personal matters. He’d gone to Stark with a carefully planned explanation and a list of regrets written on Wakandan stationary. An accounting of whys that he’d convinced himself Tony would understand. A plea on behalf of Bucky and everything he’d been through.
“Fifteen years ago I revolutionized surface-to-air missiles using better fuel-payload ratios. No one told me to, heaven knows I didn’t need the money.” Tony exhales and the condensation rises like smoke. “But it never occurred to me to keep them to myself.”
The Avengers’ most sophisticated lead on HYDRA is the work of one Dr. Carl Relsen and the doctors in the North Wing haven’t been able to hide their interest well enough. They think Relsen’s work will help fade the last of the control triggers and bring Bucky out of his plateau. They Avengers have tracked the splinter group to Antwerp but there’s a problem: the Belgians absolutely refuse to allow any subset of the team to cross their border. Their reasoning basically amounts to
He’s still Tony. A whirling mess of brilliance and catastrophe. He hasn’t changed and even knowing Tony would take that as an insult, Steve is relieved.
“No, they’re not. They’re your friends.” Steve could see the weight in Tony’s tired eyes, the anxious set of his shoulders. “Peter?”
“You’re still pissed, message received,” Tony’s disembodied voice broke in. “Stephen just texted me your refusal along with an
Tony gives a barking laugh, more hyena than human. “I can’t believe I used to think you knew what you were doing. I literally followed you into the jaws of death and despite constantly yelling at me for making shit up on the fly you’ve been doing the same goddamn thing.” He runs a hand over his face. “God you were such a hypocrite.”
“Please, Tony,” Steve tries one last time. “The arm might mean nothing or it might mean everything. No one can make you do this but I’m asking you to try." He tries to project his sincerity.
The words don’t seem to register. Stark stares at them, standing shoulder to shoulder, and shakes his head.
Steve doesn’t know how to make this better but he knows how to avoid making it worse. “I know what I want." He scratches his fingers across Tony’s scalp and relishes the pleased response. "Bed,” he orders.
aren’t authorized to be in the kitchen at 3 am either, Captain Asshole. Secondly, I didn’t get a Code White because FRIDAY’s not ignoring you, I turned her off. And lastly, I own the goddamn building I can show up whenever I damn well please.”
And then Tony had transported them here, to the Celestials own Ether-World, the raw foodstuff of galaxies. A place where Sleep did not exist but where Death couldn’t find them either. A pocket of suspended time to save a dying man.
“Yeah,” Tony says with contempt as he turns and walks away, “and what the hell would you know about that?”
“Captain,” Kovalchyk’s voice is soft but unwavering, “I understand what you are saying. I’m telling you, you are incorrect.” He turns toward the kitchen. “Come now, this story requires tea.”
Steve nearly jumps out of his skin at the petulant Irish lilt coming from the ceiling. He’d forgotten how human Stark’s AIs can be. She seems to have inherited Stark’s pettiness as well:
Strange left without another word and Steve drew out his phone with furious, shaking hands and dialed. He hadn’t spoken with Tony in fifty-six days. The phone picked up on the first ring and it angered Steve that his call was expected. “Did you really think I’d say
“I will.” He pretends to smile back. He shouldn’t be able to fool a spy of Natasha’s caliber but maybe she's tired or maybe the fake smile he’s practiced for weeks doesn’t look fake to anyone but himself anymore. Natasha says nothing as she exits.
“The second time I was smarter about it so he boarded up the doors of the local tavern and set it on fire. He caught me when I showed up to try and help. Told me it was the only way I’d learn. He let them burn.” Tony’s mouth was set in a grim line. “There wasn’t a third time, I only had to be taught that particular lesson twice.”
Steve had taken his uniform off and was washing it in the water. His shield lay at his side, shiny and new looking, just like it had been when they had pulled him from the ice that first time. The awful gash across his pale chest was an angry inflamed red made all the more loathsome for the sin of ruining perfection. Naked and lit by the white glow of the water he held a terrible beauty all his own.
Somewhere in the back of his mind Tony had already known it wasn’t just lack of sleep that had worn Steve down.
Every feral instinct in Steve was screaming to continue the fight. Strange was an uninvited alpha in his space while Tony was hurt, while his omega -
Grinning. Like a madman, or at the very least like a man content to be exactly where he is; stuck between his best friend’s drunk ranting and the sleeping form of the woman he loves. Tony was never Steve’s. Tony was his own, and Pepper’s, and Rhodey’s, and -
“Stop what I’m doing to him?” Stark shakes his head. “Because I’m corrupting him, right? I’m trying to get him to come to the dark side for the orgasms. Couldn’t just be that Rogers needs to bleed off some aggression every once in awhile.”
Tony’s right hand dropped, his left was all that remained. “I don’t understand!” he screamed. “What did I do?!“
The Soldier capitalizes on the distraction. He bucks Steve off and flips them in one smooth move. His weight keeps Steve down but leaves the assassin’s back exposed to Stark and that’s not a good thing either because even if the Winter Soldier has taken over Steve can’t let Iron Man take that shot.
Rhodes spins a set of keys around his finger. “Tony lent me his new Maserati on the condition I use it to ‘have no fun whatsoever’ and say something nice at his funeral if Pepper kills him.”
Sam’s scrutinizing him intently and all of a sudden the warm feeling of reunion fades and Steve feels exposed. “Fine.”
“I know better than most.” Steve is hyperaware that Stark’s less than five feet from him. “I know that if you don’t do something it’s not because you can’t. It’s because you won’t.”
He throws an arm over Bucky's shoulder and tucks himself closer. It reminds him of years ago in Sarah Rogers’s old drafty house when Bucky used to do the same for him when Steve was the one who was sick. It’s not a pleasant memory but it is an important one. Steve was a born fighter but everything he ever learned about caring is owed to one James Buchanan Barnes. There is nothing Steve can do to pay him back for those nights where Bucky did nothing more than believe Steve would wake the next morning. He wonders if Bucky always felt this helpless.
“No. It’s because I hurt you and you let me hurt you. I won’t do that again. I don’t trust myself to deal with you and I don’t trust you to stop me.” Steve leans back against the wall. “The whole time I thought we were
Her name is Dr. Francesca Blancard. She’s a Professor Emeritus at Pennsylvania State and did a bunch of pioneering work in veteran reintegration and the lack thereof after the Vietnam war. More to the point, she’s lovely. Seventy-two and spry, gardening away in her retirement and widowhood in a small cottage just north of Martha’s vineyard.
“I need help.” He only says it when he’s alone and it can do no harm. “I can’t… I don’t know what to do.” His reflection in the new coffee pot says nothing back. “I don’t know how to fix this.”
Steve spares a glance for the dented steel. “Tell FRIDAY to open the doors and you’ll never see me again.”
His doctors have never seen anyone survive advanced Hanahaki. They debate if it was the acute trauma to his chest or the prolonged exposure to the cold Siberian air that turned it around. Tony doesn’t tell them what he suspects is the truth: that he may still feel pangs for the man who was his husband but their relationship is dead and the blooms know the season’s turning. The frost in Tony’s heart is growing steadily, settling into his bones. He hasn’t been cured by the warmth of love but by the cold harsh truth: Steve doesn’t love him. He stopped awhile ago. If the lie was a forerunner or a consequence is moot.
“Yes.” He doesn’t make the mistake of phrasing it like a promise. He doesn’t guess how she knows he ran.
Things shift or maybe it’s Steve who gradually falls back into phase with the world. He sits in the map room with its rotating holographic globe and stares at the bright band of Accords blue. He feels a twinge of guilt as Maldecia spins by, ten months removed from the typhoon and recovering slowly. If Steve is still bound to the Compound by legalities then he has to figure out how to reintegrate in other ways.
Steve’s hand shoots out to enmesh itself in damp hair before Tony can do anything more. Forward moment halted, Tony’s arms relax against Steve’s outer legs to rub soothing circles. He smells clean; no lingering trace of a stranger’s cologne and his hair looks black where it’s sticking up between Steve’s fingers. He gently tugs Tony’s head back to expose the red bite still not quite faded on his throat. Steve has no right to be jealous. They’re nothing to each other - not even friends. It’s just harder to believe that sometimes.
Stark’s voice is too loud even though Steve knows it’s barely above a whisper. The last time Steve did this was in the back of a bombed-out finishing school in Belgium. Her name was Alice and Steve doesn’t know whether she lived or died.
The others fare better and worse. Natasha was already back by the time Steve returned. He wants to thank her for everything she’s done but the walls have ears and he doesn’t want Natasha to take any more hits on his behalf. Sam comes back with him and unlike Steve he has enough bite left to call a spade a spade. He rejects Stark’s offer outright and takes the plea deal his lawyers get him. He’s serving out his probation in DC and Steve tries not to feel like he let Sam down by not being Captain America but by being Steve Rogers instead.
Steve wishes he and Tony were the type of friends who could scream obscenities at each other and then sift through the ashes later for the good-hearted meaning buried below but they’re not. He doesn’t know if they ever were. Steve never chanced it and then they broke under the weight of things unsaid.
Tony wondered if the castle-dwellers had found the way out or if they too were wandering this seemingly endless place.
Stark’s babbling. Steve may not be a genius but he isn’t stupid. He scans the globe, watching the numbers flex and settle as the typhoon lurches closer. He can see the flawed conclusion Stark’s come to and the absolution he must want if he’s sharing it with Steve. “You’re going to let the storm hit.”
as he runs through the alleys of his mind that the Avengers have his back, or the Howling Commandos do, or SHIELD. He knows too, with the certainty of dream logic, that people are hunting him. It should be scary but it isn’t.
“I know.” In the dead of night when Steve had thought himself alone, Vision was awake just down the hall. He holds up a battered box. “I brought Scrabble.”
Steve tells himself he wants to be an honest man but if this is truth then he doesn’t want it. The paints leech through the fibres of the paper, carrying colour deeper and deeper; ruining all the sheets below. It’s Steve’s fault; the paper is too thin, the colours applied too heavily but it still feels like Stark should share the blame for forcing his way onto the page. Tony staining everything.
Steve stops drawing figures after that; sticks to wooden soldiers, dancing monkeys, wind-up ballerinas, tin men.
Steve automatically falls back to keep both Stark and the stranger in sight. “Tony, you know who this is?”
“Lang was before Christmas. I don’t know for sure if it was Clint but someone kept following me to meetings and shooting at me with the arrows I designed for him. Anyway, Natasha didn’t seem concerned when I told her someone was taking pot shots at me, so either she hates my guts or it was Clint.”
The nickname sparks something nearly dead in Steve’s heart. “Because it clearly hasn’t sunk in yet. Go to Medical.”
“You don’t get to be disappointed, Cap,” Tony rasps, “you gave up on me first." He downs a shot of whisky straight from the bottle and flicks the AA chip over the edge of the roof.
Tony’s mouth twitched at the waste. He would always be greedy for whatever Steve Rogers would give him. He’d long since resigned himself to a life spent at the beck and call of that particular addiction. He was achingly hard in his undersuit but the prospect of jerking off with a sprained wrist was as unpleasant as it was inevitable. He pressed against his clothed erection before Steve was yanking Tony’s hand away and replacing it with his own.
Steve’s throat tightens. The agreement for Bucky’s care isn’t contingent on Steve’s presence. In fact it’s deliberately extricable from it but just as Steve can’t bear to stay, he can’t bring himself to leave either.
Steve knows he’s hit a nerve. He doesn’t know how to take it back, he doesn’t know if he wants to. What he said is true even if it isn’t fair. Everyone makes mistakes, it’s the consequences that rain unevenly.
Steve’s momentarily taken aback. FRIDAY runs much of the automated functions in the Compound. She’s Tony’s constant companion. “You turned her off?”
Steve lets go before he can do more damage. Tony stumbles at the unexpected withdrawal before finding his footing and Steve expects an angry outburst that never comes. Tony’s still not looking at him, he’s half-curled over himself trying to breathe through clenched teeth and around bruised ribs. A tear track runs from the edge of his left eye downward. The hand not clutched to his ribcage is tangled in Steve’s T-shirt in a fist.
“Yeah,” Sam says without remorse, “and I don’t even particularly like the guy.” He takes a slow draw from his lemonade. “But believe it or not I didn’t actually drop in to talk about your bestie and frenemy. How are you doing, man?”
“You could - ” Tony stopped to fortify himself. “I’d be okay with it, if you still wanted to.” He didn’t strip down like Steve feared, instead he tilted his head slightly to the right, exposing the bloody column of his throat like he’d let Steve bite -
“It’s not my decision,” Steve says as he carefully unbuttons Tony’s collar. “It’s not yours either.”
“Time dilation and spacial displacement,” Reed tried to explain. “Spacetime is stretching at different rates along different axes. We don’t have enough data, all our monitoring equipment disintegrated across the membrane. Maybe if we…”
“No.” Steve hadn’t wanted to see him but instead of relief all he felt was old familiar anger. It was just one more decision Tony had taken out of Steve’s hands and had made unilaterally for them both. “Probably a good idea.”
“Can’t really feel it most of the time.” To prove his point Steve ran his finger along the sewn gash leaving a smear of blood behind before pulling on his uniform. “But sometimes... sometimes I can feel it killing me. Slowly. Then the pain fades, flattens out.”
His gaze flicks open at the same time as Steve’s hand leaves his hair. Behind them the blue hologram of the world shows the spinning typhoon obscuring the Eastern edge of Maldecia. The percentages in the simulations jump wildly for an instant before stabilizing. Landfall means that so far the Accords have kept the Avengers back, so far they’ve kept their word. The mission’s gone from preventative to active.
“That’s probably one good thing about this place.” Tony suspected the pain would be agony if it wasn’t deadened. Steve’s body was fighting the infection but his mind was feeling the strain. When Steve got back someone more qualified than Tony would have to get a look at it.
Tony dragged himself up to look over the lip expecting some new unseemly horror. Except the well wasn’t filled with anything. It was bottomless, the blackness so black it played tricks on Tony’s mind and conjured images of all the monsters that lived inside. It was the perfect lair for a malevolent beast that guarded the key that would let them leave. Tony just had to trick him into giving it up.
“Please don’t joke.” That was the cruellest irony of them all: Tony was dying of a bond Steve had so desperately wanted and that Tony never did.
Tony is staring at him with uncertainty, eyes tracking Steve’s every movement like he doesn’t quite understand this game. Then he nods sharply.
Tony was soaked through in minutes. He sat next to Steve and resisted the urge to nestle closer. Steve might have well been a statue. The kevlar of his uniform conducted no heat and underneath it the hard planes of muscle were locked tight. Tony closed his eyes, taking advantage of his false sleep to steal comfort as he rested his head on Steve’s shoulder. He didn’t sleep per se but he let the rise and fall of the storm’s violent melody lull him into a trance.
The files she’s opened censor themselves. There are still pictures though. The man is Tony’s age: dark blond, smaller than Steve but most men are these days. In the most prominent photo he’s wearing a wedding ring and standing next to his blonde wife and two blond children. The president of some media conglomerate based out of the Midwest.
He only catches fragments of phrases. How Rhodes isn’t smart enough to build his own suit. How Tony’s not deserving of one. Arrogance, volatility, alcoholism. Stark brings up someone named Nadia and Rhodes shouts a very distinct
“Yes,” he says automatically before correcting himself. “No. I don’t know.” He deflates. “You have to hate this, Nat. You’re a spy, you can’t like your name all over the news.”
It’d be easier to trust Tony if he wasn’t like this: unpredictable and independent. Operating on knowledge you don’t have and that he won’t deign to tell you. (It’d be easier to trust Tony if Steve thought Tony trusted him back.)
Steve slowly takes the glasses from Bucky’s loose grip and fits them over his face. Interfacing with machines has never come naturally to him in the way it does to Stark or was foisted on Bucky. Suddenly there’s a cool hand on his temple and Steve freezes as Bucky adjusts the sensors. The same Christmas scene reveals itself, taken this time from Steve’s memories. It’s incomplete, the holograms catch. The figures and solids bleed into each other.
Steve’s grip tightened until the screen of his phone broke, breaks running from corner to corner like cracks through ice. “Yes.”
“What?” Tony’s near panicking now as he squirms under where Steve is leaning over his back, partially pinning him. “No. Non-negotiable,
Steve knows he is not forgiven just as he knows there is no version of the Accords he will sign his name to and believe in. He spends his days on house arrest interspersed with legal meetings and workouts. He watches as Bucky is set up in the fortified North Wing with a team of doctors and fails, and fails, and fails. He tries not to feel like he has bartered himself away for nothing.
“Yours maybe,” Stark mumbles and Steve hates that the future seems to be built on easy relativism. It only makes him grasp his absolutes harder.
There was a pause and then Tony threw the rum at the wall. It was too small to shatter. “Fuck, fuck, fuck…” He buried his head in his hands.
The words come easily because he believes in her. He doesn’t know all the pieces of herself she keeps buried but he believes in her; her ability to overcome, to conquer. He slides his hand across the railing, palm up in silent offering. When her hands remain clasped around the metal he tries to hide his disappointment. He aches for the connection Tony threw away without thought.
Tony’s charm flips like a switch and he gives her his most dazzling smile. “Hello there, we’ll take a spinach omelette, the French toast, and a BLT. We could use some privacy too if you could swing it.”
“You and what evidence?” comes Tony’s reply. “You can’t be here because you’re confined to your room after dark. Doc can’t be here, he doesn’t have access. FRIDAY’s down due to a scheduled maintenance blackout. I'm safely locked away in my workshop downstairs. You want to take this to the council be my guest.”
and a repulsor was pressed against his ribcage, gauntleted fingers digging into Steve’s fresh wound, tearing the new stitches. The pain was real and the Ether wouldn’t save either of them from their mistakes this time.
He finds Tony on the roof of the Compound. FRIDAY lets him up without incident and that should have been his first warning. It’s still dark and the only illumination is the halogen light shining through the ripped hole in the North Wing roof and the glow of the arc reactor in the Iron Man armor that hovers nearby. Tony’s surveying the damage, standing too close to the crumbling edges, and Steve can see his face momentarily catch the light as he walks the circumference of the hole.
“Ah.” Stark leans back against the hood of the Ferrari nearest to him. “It’s the best they could do but you think I could do better.”
Flesh hits drywall hard enough to clack and Stark stops grinning. Steve shouldn’t be angry but it shouldn’t be Stark, so somehow that all balances out.
brought the tablets down from the mountain.” His gaze was a million miles away. “Noah built the ark.”
Tony kissed him. When Steve’s lips remained unmoving Tony bit down until he drew blood and Steve jolted back into life, pinning Tony to the ground at the base of the twisted tree. The vee between Steve’s fingers and thumb slotted snugly around the base of Tony’s throat. His other hand was splayed across Tony’s chest right over his heart. Tony swallowed, his heart jumped, his groin throbbed. Steve felt everything. Even if there was no reprieve in sleep or dreams, there was still this. An hour of not caring about exits or injuries, where frustrations found a different outlet.
The soft click of the conference doors locking is the only warning Steve gets before he’s pushed up against the railing behind him. It’s only surprise that gets Stark that far, Steve rights himself ready to push him right back before -
He wanders the Compound, unable to reorient himself. The stretches between visits to Bucky or Natasha lengthen and neither calls him on it. Sam seeks him out for coffee but as good as it feels in the moment it only leaves Steve emptier when he leaves. The only person whose presence he can handle is Vision who doesn’t have that sixth sense for human distress that leaves him so vulnerable around the others. Tony fades into the background and Steve doesn’t miss him.
“I told him not to come,” Bucky says in own defense. Steve abruptly remembers a request for a night alone. Or rather, apparently, for a night with Tony.
Five years ago Bucky was still at the mercy of HYDRA but without hope of rescue. Scott was in prison, Sam was in mourning. Thor had lost his brother to madness, Wanda was at war. Clint was leading a secret life because he didn’t trust any of them with his family. SHIELD was infiltrated by HYDRA, Natasha couldn’t believe she’d ever have anything beyond the life of a spy. Tony was falling apart for all to see and no one bothered to look, and Bruce hadn’t yet remembered he was more than a monster. And Steve had hated the future with it’s loud, bright, fast colours because he had no idea how much worse it could get.
Steve says ferociously because he loves like that. Violently and only after people he’s already lost.
Tony ignores him but makes no move forward, just shucks his shirt to the floor and kicks off his trousers. His fingers hook under the waistband of his underwear and before long those join the rest of his clothes on the linoleum. He leans against the back wall, pupils too large in the darkness, swallowing the irises whole. The eyes of a man who has gazed for too long into the abyss and has begun to carry it around with him.
Tony is opening his own belt one-handedly with impressive dexterity but Steve can’t wait. The few experiences he’s had with men were in places and times where speed was a necessity. He knocks Tony’s hand out of the way and undoes the man’s trousers himself before shoving his own sweatpants and boxers down around his thighs. He lines their lengths up as best he can and strokes.
Sometimes when Steve gets up for his early morning run he finds Kovalchyk in the kitchen rummaging around for tea. He plays Scrabble with Vision over dinner these days because with Steve’s schedule filling up he sleeps through the night. He watches as Tony goes to galas with Pepper and comes back from galas with Pepper. His Spanish is still atrocious. It’s driving FRIDAY insane.
Tony snarled without making a sound and shoved Steve away from the bar. His usually nimble fingers struggled for a moment before the bottle opened and the scent of cheap vodka flooded the air. Tony eyed him deliberately before swallowing a mouthful without tasting.
Bucky says nothing, just stares at the white wall. The silence is the start of the spiral. The spark in his eyes is replaced by a flat expression of disinterest. Steve silently starts gathering the box of crackers and the garbage. This isn’t how he wanted the night to end.
Bucky hit him outside of a bar in Montana. The punch only landed because Steve wasn't expecting it but he could feel the bruise bloom across his cheek.
Tony tilted his head slightly to the side and Steve saw through the layer of makeup to the tired blue underneath his eyes. The illusion of perfection slipping away. “You don’t remember how we were rescued do you?”
