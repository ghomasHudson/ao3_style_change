That seemed to calm him down somewhat, although his hands were still in fists.  I looked away, remembering the last time he was so angry.  It seemed he remembered too.  With some effort he opened his hands and took a cleansing breath.  “No.  I’m sorry.  It just hurt to be reminded that I’m capable of doing that.  I won’t.  And you shouldn’t pretend you like it in order to keep me satisfied.”
After John’s shift is Molly and then Mrs. Hudson.  They passed through my door like a parade to watch over me.  The shift I despise the most is Mycroft’s.  At least Lestrade brings me cold cases when he comes.  Mycroft only brings be snide comments.  But I know I deserve it.  I have shown I can no longer be trusted to take care of myself.  It was an intervention.
Ever write something and then lose track of what you were thinking when you started?  What were they arguing about?  Why did I write that?  Where was I going with this?  (scratches head)  I think I got it figured out.
John Watson raised a pint with his mates.  As they cheered the lights for the club dimmed and the curtains rose on stage.  It was John’s birthday and several of his friends dragged him out to a drag show.  The night was filled with female impersonators wearing sparkly outfits and lip syncing to powerful female singers.
I showed John my text history.  John fell asleep with a content smile on his face, muttering about ropes and handcuffs.  Maybe someday…
“Do I look at you in pity?”  Sherlock demanded, rocking his hips as if to remind John of where he was perched.
“What do you want, Sherlock?” John asked, very much aware that the man below him was gently humping the bed.
John straddled the human and sat down, impaling himself on Sherlock’s cock.  Squeezing it a moment with his internal muscles that made Sherlock’s toes curl he began a familiar rhythm seen in the video.
Sherlock pulled John further away from the others into a side room that was rarely used.  “What would you have me do?”
John froze as the Lestrade’s words registered.  Dark curls and pale eyes… Why hadn’t he noticed it before?  And even after Sherlock asked him about the tournament… Meeting King William when he was still a boy…
Quickly I entered the bathroom and removed my clothes, tossing them in the hamper.  I dug through the cabinet until I found the petroleum jelly.  With one foot on the toilet I reached back and hastily prepared myself.
Molly looked to Sherlock before returning her focus to John.  “I don’t know.  A pub?  Tea?  Someplace you can interact with other adults?”
“I’m…”  Sherlock cleared his throat and looked down at his hands.  “John lost his wife.  He lives with me and I’m an active participant in helping him raise his daughter.”  His voice broke at the end.
“I heard what Eurus said when you were alone with her.”  John hinted.  “Are you sure there isn’t something you want to tell me?”
“I mean… you were in the military but you held rank… so you were already a freedman.  What was your… skill?  I don’t believe it was blood sports.  You’re a crack shot but a gladiator has more scars.”
“I’ve read about going out… To pubs.  Meeting people.” Sherlock admitted.  “But you aren’t ready and I’m hopeless in that regard.”
Sherlock paused as he stood up from his chair.  “Assistance tonight in falling asleep?  I might as well.”
John’s fingers tangled themselves in my hair.  Quickly he was writhing in his chair, fingers attempting to pull me closer.  I sucked and licked, my hand soaked from my own saliva.
Sherlock stared back at him, willing the blond to understand his need for more, but terrified to say it.
“Sebastian Moran.  He was retired July 2009 after his pack was ambushed in a brutal attack overseas back in April 2009.  When his last pack member died from their wounds he was set free to find a feral pack.  Whereabouts are currently unknown.”
Watson reacted poorly.  With a cry of surprise he stood up and took a step away from the bed.  “What do you think you are doing?” Watson demanded.
My body ached for his.  People often mistake me for someone not interested in sex.  Of course I’m interested.  The thought of John rubbing his penis against my own had often been the fodder for masturbation over the past few years.  I kissed him hungrily.
“As far as I like?”  Sherlock stopped moving.  Looking around them he realized their position.  “We’re in a sexual position.”
Sherlock frowned and looked away.  “I had a boyfriend… when I was much younger.  He wanted to… to sleep with me.  But… I don’t know.  It just didn’t feel… right.  He tried to wank me off to get me in the mood… and he forced his cock down my throat.   We broke up after that.  I felt horrible… I never wanted anyone else to touch me again.  All I could think about was him pulling my hair as he… and I coughed so hard afterwards.  He thought it was funny… that it went down my trachea instead of my esophagus.  I was just… a warm body to him.  I wasn’t anything special or someone to love.  And I came to the conclusion that love doesn’t exist.”
John surrendered to the sensation, feeling his body change even as Sherlock made sounds of encouragement.  His body felt like it could continue forever and spend all of eternity in Sherlock’s arms.  How long could they go on like that?  They were in a world where time felt different.  For all he knew they had already been fucking for a week.
“Silence.”  John sighed and left Lestrade’s cell.  Further into the dungeon he came to Molly’s cell.  “I know who Sherlock is.  Why was I lied to?”
“You married… A woman.”  Sherlock was having trouble concentrating on his words with John sucking on him.
Watson bit his lip in a way that Sherlock found endearing… Even with the mustache.  Watson’s hand reached out to touch Sherlock’s cock, giving it a gentle squeeze.
“Anal lubrication…”  John replied with a grin, wrapping his legs around Sherlock’s body and holding him close.  “You feel… so good.”
“John…” Sherlock took several more shuddering breaths.  “I will survive as a cold, dry husk… But it will be as if my heart had been burned from me.  You are my heart.”
There was always a celebration in the Holmes manor when one of their indentured servants was able to pay back their debts and be granted freedom.  Sherlock wondered what John’s celebration had been like.
John’s fingers clutched at Sherlock’s buttock, squeezing it.  Sherlock hadn’t prepared him completely but he welcomed the stretch, burn and fullness of his lover inside of him.  His legs pulled Sherlock closer.  “You like having my legs wrapped around you?”
I didn’t answer.  The sweat on his back was cooling as evidence of what we had done began to fade.  My scent was no longer pungent.  With a grunt John pulled out and waddled off to the bathroom to deal with the condom, leaving me alone on the bed that still smelled of us.  The tears came again.
“It’s more what isn’t there, actually… And he was pushed!”  Sherlock waved his hands at the body and looked up at the battlement above them.  “From there.”
“It is what it is…” I murmured, looking down at the child on my lap.  “Are you going to text Mycroft next?”
John raised his hands in surrender.  “I have no plans of ever being in a position to have more children.”
“I’m fine, Sherlock.  He didn’t touch me.”  John caught Sherlock mid-pace and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist, resting his head on the detective’s shoulder.
It was supposed to be the worst room of them all.  I had to either kill my brother or my Alpha.  It was simple, easy.  It was estrus poisoning and the ODs all over again.  The answer was to kill myself.  They would live on without me.  And then everything went black.
The slave slowly sat up and flicked his ice blue eyes to meet Watson’s which caused Watson to shiver.  His skin was pale and his torso thin.  Like Lestrade his genitals were decorated with jewelry.
Sherlock bit his lips and stepped in close to John’s space, trying to get the lord to meet his gaze.  “John?”
John couldn’t help but notice that Sherlock didn’t deny it.  “What if I had said that I wanted more children?”
“London… last full moon.”  Sherlock replied.  “John identified him as the killer.  Victim was stabbed and had their throat ripped out by a transforming warg.”
John made a little moan and opened his own mouth and for a few minutes we were messy tongues and teeth.
Sherlock sat down on the bed and was immediately his thigh was commandeered by the werewolf to be used as a pillow.  “I don’t know anything about werewolves.”
Sherlock frowned a bit but kissed John anyway, shifting to press his cock against John’s tight opening.  And then for a breathless moment he was pushing himself into John for the first time.  The way John opened to him and engulfed him made him hold his breath until he was fully sheathed.  “Oh… Gods… John.”
Nothing much changed for us by becoming married.  The only difference was that Rosie took John’s old room while her father shared my bed.  It was merely used for sleeping.  John was shy around the bed, wearing as much clothing as he could put on without suffering from heat stroke.  I had never even seen my groom naked, although I know he’d caught glimpses of me.  He never expressed his sexual attraction to me.  And that bothered me.
At least Rosie was requesting something real.  The previous day her request had been for a unicorn.  John was amused at watching the two interact.  Sherlock was good with children.  It was a shame that he never wanted to father any of his own.  Luckily Sherlock had Rosie.
And so began the wild, adrenalin pumping life for John that centered around Sherlock Holmes.  Within a day he was invited to live with the sometimes drag queen and solve cases with him.
“You have no idea, do you?  You honestly have no idea what sort of appeal you have for people.  There’s Molly, the Woman…”
“Come here.”  Casually he patted the edge of the bed, so I dutifully sat where he placed me.  “There’s something I have to show you.”  As he spoke he lifted the hem of his vest.  As he tossed his vest aside, he bowed his head in shame.
Sherlock rested his head on John’s shoulder.  “Let me keep you.”  Absently he traced one of John’s nipples.  “Let me keep you forever.”
John found he could not speak.  Watching his king swallow him with no regard to station or propriety.  And when Sherlock looked at him there was so much desire within his eyes.  John remembered Sherlock had always looked at him like that… Even when he was pretending to be a bed slave.  There was always that need and devotion.  John reached down and lightly touched the curls atop Sherlock’s head.  “Come up here.”
“Look what they did to you!” Sherlock gesticulated at John.  “And that was only because they weren’t sure if I had affection for you.  Now they know… Or they suspect.  Next time they won’t wait for me to rescue you.”
John pulled away enough to take a good look at the faun.  “You said you’ve been holding back your nature.  What did you mean?”
When John regained consciousness he told us that the person he thought was his psychiatrist was actually someone claiming to be my sister, Eurus.  This brought Mycroft, John and I to Sherrinford where we played her sick game.  It was there I found out that my whole life had been a lie.
“I said, ‘stop!’” John turned to glare at his partner.  Sherlock seemed to shrink back into the door of the cab, causing John to soften.  “I’m not ready.”  Pulling his hands out from under his thighs, he clutched them together.  “Besides… It’s not about me anymore.  I have Rosie to think about.  It would be unfair of me.  It’s all about her now.”
I smirked, half amused.  It had been more like a full minute.  But he was my quickest.  Perhaps it was because I actually wanted him.
“Sherlock…” Lestrade gave a heavy sigh and there was a squeak of wood as if he was leaning heavily on his desk.  “Remember what I told you about TMI?”
Sherlock found it very difficult to fall asleep that night.  Whether it was because Watson was cross with him or that he had become used to their nightly activities, he was not sure.  But he vowed that the next time Watson approached him he would not try and reciprocate.
“It had nothing to do with what you did.  It’s often like that.”  Sherlock admitted.  “That’s why I don’t do it very often.  If I’m too exhausted it can put me to sleep for the rest of the night.  It’s inconvenient.”
Sherlock walked back and forth across the bedchamber floor, a crying baby in his arms.  Softly he murmured platitudes such as “there, there Rosie,” and “it’s alright, my darling.”
“You need a knot.  This heat will end if you have a knot.” John informed me as he opened the package and rolled the large condom over his length.  It was made to catch the impressive amount of semen an Alpha produced.  His half knot kept it in place.  “What position do you prefer?”
John rested against Sherlock’s warmth, feeling a little drowsy in their afterglow.  “Now… About my chamber in the south tower…”
John pulled away from the corpse to stare at Lestrade.  “No… Alex is the name of his alpha brother who was in my pack.  Alex’s mother’s name was… umm… Daisy?  So you’re looking for the surviving warg Daisy Beta Red Sigma.  I don’t know his name but that’s his ID.  Daisy Beta Red Sigma.”
“Yes.” I answered, kissing him softly on the lips.  “But I’ll settle for you just moving in for now.”
John rolled onto his stomach and pressed his face into the pillow.  Beneath him his cock hardened with interest.  Prima Nocta was meant to deflower the bride so that the groom would not be burdened with “original sin” of a bride’s first blood.  Did Sherlock really believe all that nonsense?
It was on his first night back from the future when he finally went to bed.  Watson entered the bedroom and looked Sherlock over from head to foot as he stood in his night shirt.  “Do you again need assistance tonight?”
John moaned and rubbed his face with his hand.  Opening his eyes, he stared at the patterns of light from the window on the ceiling.  “There’s sex without love… And sex with love.  And love without sex.”
Sherlock sighed.  “Mycroft thought I might want to give my condolences in person.  I was very close to Victor’s family before I forced myself to forget about him.”
She said it before time was called.  But then it turned out that neither of us had to go through that at all.  I was so angry, so disgusted, I smashed the casket.  I knew I could never have John.  Never!  It wasn’t fair!
They lay there for a long time, Sherlock holding his lover close as they both recovered.  John was the first to move.  “I’m sticky… And so are you.”
Mary wrapped her arms around his waist and soothed him.  “Maybe he’s giving us time to get to know each other.  Maybe he’s waiting for signs that I’m with child.  Maybe he doesn’t want the rest of the court to know that you’re his paramour.  You can’t know what he’s thinking.”
Too soon the time Sherlock had at the safe house was over.  The next day he expected the car that would take him back to the city.  It was time to say goodbye.  “I wish you could come with me back to the city.  But I know you’ll hate it.”
I gave a helpless laugh at the irony.  The same man that beat the shit out of me not even a few days ago asked me if he hurt me during intercourse.  “No…”
Sherlock sat up and managed to pull up the blankets to cover them both, guiding John to lay against him.  The detective turned off the bedside light.
Eudora picked up the girl and kissed the side of her head.  “I baked biscuits for you.  Come inside.”
With some difficulty John managed to get out of the tub without injuring either of them in the process.  And then he reached back to help Sherlock up and out, draping him with towel before finding one for himself.
Sherlock stood up and approached the bars, still naked and beautiful even in the dungeon.  “My lord, John.  I give you my word.  I have no intention of harming you.  I am here for Moriarty.  I am willing to serve your bed if it will keep my identity a secret until I can find my prey.”
“I’ve lived at the government facility that housed our project… most of that was underground except the training grounds.”  John continued to turn, staring at marvels.  “I’ve seen pictures, of course.  We were schooled.”
John released his hold and wearily wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s body to complete the hug.  “Told you I was close.”
“Yes.  Thank you for understanding.”  John beamed at the older woman.  “I can take my other form if it will be easier for you.”
John went for his trousers before realizing he was wearing a belt.  The belt was unbuckled and pulled off.  “Why do you want to take me to the fairy realm?”
“I’m sorry!  But the thought of you being pregnant nearly broke me.”  John took a deep breath to calm his breathing.
I swallowed what was in my mouth and pulled away from him.  Hastily I wiped my hand on my trousers as I went back to my chair.  Why would he call her name?  I was confused and a little hurt by what he moaned in his moment of passion.
John’s ears flicked back, hearing his mate’s voice.  The growling stopped but there was still a lip curl and the fur on the back of his neck bristled.
“I’m just there for pleasure.  You need the pleasure.  I can give you that if that’s all you want from me.”
Mycroft glanced at John a moment before pursing his lips.  “You are aware that I’m not involved in EVERY project… right?”
Molly got up and crossed to take Rosie.  “I was just leaving.”  Bringing the child to me, she allowed me to touch her cheek before whisking her away.  “I think you should tell him.”  Quickly she left, leaving that suggestion behind.
“Yes… For instance I can breathe underwater and lure mortals with the sound of my voice.  Those are the physical changes I received.  My Glamour makes me look like what mortals call a mermaid.  It’s not real.  I can remove it.”
Lord John tried desperately not to look at Sherlock’s bare ass.  It was difficult not to.  And in the chill of the spring day it was covered in goose flesh.  It served the man right for dressing as a sex slave.  The clothing choice was appropriate for a warm bed chamber and not the outdoors.
John ran his hands through his hair before reaching into his pocket to pull out a foil wrapped Alpha-sized condom.  Tossing it on the bed, he began to undress.  “You could have gotten pregnant… Studies show that the treatment for estrus poisoning has a high percentage of pregnancies even if the Alpha doesn’t bite.”
Sherlock kissed John’s lips, breaking into the doctor’s thoughts.  “I love you.”  It was a simple, soft declaration.
Sherlock’s hands explored the sides and dick of the one he fucked.  When his hand made contact with John’s stiff member the reality of what he was doing overwhelmed him and his rhythm slipped.  “Oh god…”  Holding John’s hips he held on for dear life as his body made it clear it was time to finish.
John held up the lube and squeezed a generous portion on his fingers.  Getting up onto his knees, he reached back and began to hastily push fingers into himself.  First one and then two.  A soft grunt escaped him as he stretched the tight orifice.
I wondered if John had been placed in my path so I would fall for him.  I wouldn’t put it past Eurus to have John shot so he would fall into my path and appeal to my fondness for men in uniform.  Of course… She also placed a lesbian dominatrix in my path so it’s unlikely she knew what my preferences were.
“I don’t… Hate you.  I’m just…”  John sighed and relaxed against me, making me aware that he had been full of tension.
“Sherlock asked me to live with him.”  John blinked a few times at Lestrade and then looked up at Sherlock.
John bit his lips and slipped his hand under the waistband of the pajamas.  His hand closed around Sherlock’s length.
“Because it’s true.” John turned away, remembering Molly’s breathed words on that terrible day.  “It’s true.”
At the end of her shift she gave me a quick peck on the cheek and it hurt… These casual friendly things I can do with a female colleague, but not the man I’m desperately in love with.  John may allow fellatio, but he would never kiss me.
The hum found its way to John’s spine and he bucked, fingers tangled in Sherlock’s curls to pull his head down to meet him.  Wrapping one leg around Sherlock’s shoulders he pulled the other man closer, arching into him and cursing with each thrust until finally he burst.  For several long moments he gasped for air, only vaguely aware of the scratchy nature of the hay under his sweaty back… Or the tightness of Sherlock’s curls in his fingers.  Gentling his fingers he released the other lord’s hair, surprised when a few strands were caught between his fingers.
“Irene is a fairy.”  The faun informed John from where he sat beside him.  “What do you want?”  That was directed at the fairy and held more than a little contempt.
“Rosie will stay in Sherlock’s room.  You two will be in the guest room.” Siger informed them as he led them upstairs to the bedrooms.  When they returned downstairs to the kitchen they found Rosie at the table, sans mask, happily eating biscuits.  Sherlock and John removed their masks.
I desperately needed to ejaculate.  I pondered the etiquette of releasing on John’s stomach the way he did mine.
Sherlock closed his eyes and felt his body fall over the edge.  For a brief, breathless moment he was highly aware of Watson’s hand squeezing him while his other hand caught Sherlock’s semen in the handkerchief.
I realized I didn’t know if I could trust him not to hurt me.  But my body reacted to the stimulation anyway.  “John… I’m about to… To…” I was helpless and completely under his power.  I ejaculated and John stilled.  As I finished I watched him get up from the bed and go into the bathroom.  There was a sound of him spitting, followed by the sink turning on.  I turned my head to look at the time, surprised to find that it was past time for my alarm to go off.  I checked the alarm and found that it was to go off at the time I set but hadn’t.
“With words… Or actions.  Just make it clear what it is you want.  If it shows you how much I care about you I won’t deny you anything… Except sending me away.  I won’t go away.  And you probably shouldn’t ask that Mary go away.  She is the mother of my child.”
“A please this time?  You must be in a state…” With a judgmental tut she was finally gone, leaving me in peace.
“That’s Bill.”  John smiled, inching closer.  “Oh… there’s Alex!  And Arthur!  Martin loved it when Arthur knotted him.”  The orgy ended with the howl as all the males again relaxed onto the floor and the females picked themselves up.  “There’s Sarah… the doctor who serviced me.  Molly… Mary… Jenny… the one holding the camera is named Katie… she was already pregnant with Bill’s cub from our previous bonding.  They all got pregnant that day.  And the group after them too when we were in wolf form… our fertility success was really high.”
I nodded in response and followed her suggestion.  I did not ask her how long she had been listening through the door.
“A little.”  John sighed and rested his head on Sherlock’s shoulder.  “But I know you’re just a Pup…”
Mycroft stepped forward and raised his hand.  Immediately four of his personal guards yanked on Moriarty’s chains to flatten him face down upon the floor.  “I think that’s enough of that.”
Sherlock pulled back and then pushed in again… And again!  Really he could not help himself as he repeatedly pushed into John over and over.  “John…”
To be honest I had no time to even think about my pregnancy until I stood in front of my sister, playing her violin.  “You’re pregnant.”
“Royal bastard, at your service.” Mycroft grinned and bowed before John.  “My mother was a common maid, unworthy of my royal father’s marriage bond.  A more delicate flower was chosen to be his queen, mother of my dear brother, his majesty William Sherlock Scott Holmes.  My royal father saw fit to keep me and bestow me with honors he couldn’t give my mother.”
“He’s a gorgon.  I don’t know how much of you is still mortal.  But if you are a tiny bit he can turn you to stone.  Keep your eyes shut!”
“When did you arrange this?”  John asked, looking at all the detail with awe.  It was clear no thought was given to expense.
John grunted and clenched his eyes shut.  Suddenly something grabbed him from behind and pulled him physically away from Sherlock’s warmth.  “Sherlock?”  His arms reached to empty air and a sense of panic overwhelmed him.
“Trouble in paradise?” Lestrade asked Sherlock.  For the first time since Detective Inspector met John, the army doctor was not giggling with Sherlock at a crime scene.  In fact the army doctor stood a fair distance away, seeming to be unconcerned by the case.
“Because I want you.”  John answered.  An oily hand slathered Sherlock’s cock and John straddled and sat, easily taking Sherlock into his body.  “It’s been a while since I’ve done this.  But you feel so good.”  Rocking his hips, he gave an internal squeeze.
The next day we were pulled into a case.  John entitled it “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.”  Our young client was a fan of our work and followed our blog since the Baskerville case.  There was a poodle named Wellington that had been murdered.  That case took several days to resolve.  Solving it was easy.  The fallout from that resolution was difficult.
To the left the mist cleared and revealed the place they had just been.  But now it was day.  John stopped, noticing a young boy playing in the stream.  The boy was naked.  His brown curls made him look familiar.  Under the tree a woman wearing a long dress and an apron was slumbering.  There was a flash of light and the fairy Sherlock called Irene appeared beside the stream, clad in a gown.
For weeks I forgot.  It was only after I returned from hospital that I remembered.  I felt increasingly distracted as John spent the afternoon with me.  I wanted him to bend me over the table and take me.  Wild fantasies filled my brain.  It was my brain’s reaction to his Alpha scent.  I was only half aware of his admission to cheating on Mary.  My Alpha started to cry and I moved to wrap my arms around him to comfort him.
John watched Sherlock as he lounged in his chair, head back, hands clasped in his lap as if he was listening to the story.  John paid very little attention to the story.  Instead he watched Sherlock, his fingers idly playing with his wedding ring.  His thoughts drifted, imagining Sherlock attempting to flirt with some random bloke and getting punched in the face for his efforts.
John tried his very best to ignore the voice beside him in the dark.  Instead he kept his eyes closed, feigning sleep.
“My brother has certain… Needs.” Mycroft answered.  “He meets those that might satisfy his needs and takes them in.  Of course they ultimately cannot handle him and they leave.  It’s been six days and you have not yet packed up.  I wonder why.  What do you hope to get out of him?”
John fought off the urge to wrap his arms around her.  “If you’re a mermaid where is your fish tail?”
My preparations done, I washed my hands and checked my hair before exiting the bathroom to the bedroom.  The light was on and John sat at the edge of the bed wearing a vest and his pants.  His eyes opened wide when he saw me.  “What are you doing?”
“No, it’s not.” John answered.  “First I blamed you even though Greg told me you were the one with the gun aimed at you.  Mary got in the way.  Then I beat you to the point of putting you in the hospital.  And then… Then I force you into a sexual relationship.”
“Fatherhood worries.  What if I’m a horrible father?  What if I neglect my family?  What if I die…?  What if I disappoint you?”
“Of course not.  I never touched her.”  Sherlock managed to pull off the shirt and toss it away to lick John’s nipple.
I smiled at that, encouraged to continue.  It was easy to tug at the waistband of is pants until only the head appeared.  Leaning in, I licked him, savoring his salty pre-cum on my tongue.  I carefully catalogued his reactions to my mind palace for future analysis.  When I looked up to gauge his reaction, I saw him staring back at me, his mouth open and his brows knit together.  Feeling a little cheeky, I opened my mouth wider and took him in, rolling my tongue around the glans.
Rosie slipped off the couch, crossed the room and climbed into Sherlock’s lap to curl up there, her head on his shoulder and her fingers teasing his buttons.
“Especially peacocks.” John stood on his toes and pushed a kiss into Sherlock’s lips.  They kissed for a moment before John pulled away to look up at Sherlock.  “Tell me one of your needs.”
Sherlock leaned in and kissed John’s lips.  His tongue traced the lord’s lower lip before he sucked on it.
Sherlock’s eyes took in details of the room.  Obviously the large mirror was a one way mirror for someone on the other side to observe them.  There was a drain in the middle of the floor for liquids and quick cleaning.  Along the wall was a tap with a threaded faucet for a hose.  “What about that?”  Sherlock pointed to it.
I slipped out of my chair and crossed the short distance between us.  I could do this for him.  I could give him comfort and release.  I leaned in, obedient to his silent plea and wrapped my hand around his growing erection.  With my hand in place I licked the tip, finding it to be a length I could easily manage.
“Right… Like how you thought I would leave you a couple of weeks ago?  What if I can’t protect you?  I’m a soldier… A knight.  Someday there may be someone younger and stronger that challenges me on the battlefield.”
“How are things done in a feral werewolf pack?”  Sherlock couldn’t take his eyes from John, the naked soul clinging to his leg as if it was a lifeline.  The more he heard about the experiments the less he liked.
There was a brief knock at the door before John walked in, holding Rosie.  Quickly he took in Molly’s and my position.  “Sorry… I’m interrupting something.”
The uncertainty in Sherlock’s posture made John sit up, legs still open and surrounding his mate.  “Sherlock… you don’t have to.  I was just offering more if you wanted it.  You don’t have to… I just wanted you to know that I’m willing.”
“Sherlock…” His moan of my name brought my focus back in him.  His eyes were closed and his breath kept catching.  I could feel his hips attempting to counter mine.
I lay back on the bed, my feet on the mattress so I could lift my hips.  If John was to take me, I would have him face to face or not at all.  A part of me wanted to roll over onto my hands and knees and take the more traditional breeding position… But if this was to be my one and only experience with my Alpha, then I wanted to remember what he looked like when he filled me.
“Is there something you want to tell me?” John asked as he sat on my new couch.  It wasn’t as good as my old couch.  Rosie sat on the floor at his feet, playing with her toys.
Magnussen ran a hand up John’s arm, leaving a trail of oily sweat and his pungent body odor behind.  “Strong.  I suppose if you like that sort of thing.  He’s good for standing on all fours like the animals he’s surrounded by…  A little tumble in the straw in his stall.”
“Why do you keep doing this to me?”  John whispered, aware of Sherlock’s erection against his hip.  “You don’t need to seduce me… Really… You have run of my castle.  You don’t need to do anything for me.”
We closed escrow on a new house!  Yay!  But that means I've been packing boxes instead of writing.  Boo!  I bring you a short chapter.  Yay!  This week I fly out to visit family in Hawaii and my not have time to write.  Boo!
It pleased Sherlock to hear Watson say such things.  That night he went to sleep, relaxed from his treatment.  Sherlock fell asleep in 1895 and woke up in 2019.
“They had nothing to do with this!”  Sherlock insisted.  “They were genuine gifts from my brother, Mycroft.”
“Besides breeding an army of powerful warriors the program was used to breed desirable traits into werewolves.  They breed.  You mentioned that this particular warg was drooling on your trouser leg.  They were bred to bond together as a pack to every pack member.  They eat together, sleep together and fuck together.  Yes, I said it… there’s no other way to describe it.  I’ll send you some video footage that will make your skin crawl.  What will you do when he wants to become pack to you in all ways of that word?  In his experience… that means mounting you.”
“No!” John answered.  There were plenty of women in his past to attest to that.  Of course there were plenty of men who thought otherwise.
Sherlock took pity on his partner and leaned against the table.  “You had a mother, Rosie.  Remember we told you about your mother, Mary?”
John rolled his eyes and looked to my mobile.  “How does she know your birthday and I don’t?”  There was jealousy in his voice.  I could imagine him rolling that thought around while he used my mouth.
John sat up and ran his palms down Sherlock’s back, feeling the scars against his hands from shoulders down to waist.  For a moment he regretted not being able to experience the smooth skin it had once been.  “They aren’t hideous… And they should fade with time.”  His hands massaged the tight muscles, kneading them.  “You’re tense.”
John grunted and pulled the blankets over them.  “I’m not going anywhere.  I’m your paramour, remember?  My place is here with you.”
“Not important?”  John stared at Sherlock a long moment before his eyes went wide.  “It’s a trick!  This whole thing was a trick!  You’re here to kill me!”  Quickly he went for the door.  “Help!  Help, guards!”
“I didn’t… She didn’t really touch me.  Have you been here this whole time?”  John looked around the grey clearing.
John whimpered and pressed his face against Sherlock’s thigh, rolling over to wedge his nose into the human’s hip.  “You smell like me.  You haven’t cleaned yourself.”
“So kill me.”  John challenged as he kissed again, his hands tugging at Sherlock’s tunic to find his warm skin underneath.  “Kill me for disobeying you… I don’t care.” Kneeling down, he nipped at the exposed skin.  His fingers found the lacings for Sherlock’s trousers and undid them to expose him.  “Go ahead and call your guards in here to execute me.”  His mouth swallowed Sherlock’s cock down to the root.
Rosie slid off of Sherlock’s lap and returned to the couch, taking her place between Molly and her father.
“I’m… I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean…”  John sighed.  “Yes, of course I’ll be your lover.  For as long as you want me.”
“I’m sure Molly will be thrilled.” John rolled onto his side, away from Sherlock.  A hand reached out and caught his shoulder, pulling him onto his back again.  “What are you…?”
It was around that time that rumors began to circulate around court about Mary’s pedigree.  And one day she packed up and left in the dead of night, leaving her husband in the arms of his lover, and their child in the care of the wet nurse.
“I was never forced.  I wanted him and he wanted me.  I didn’t know he was my king… All I knew when I met him was that he wasn’t a bed slave.”
“I wouldn’t interfere.”  Sherlock answered, rubbing John’s back.  “I know there’s a difference between sex and love.”
John pulled off the still soft prick and looked up at Sherlock.  “You could be… with a little more attention…”
On the third night Sherlock took off his clothes and lay sprawled on the bed when there was a tentative knock at the door.  “Come in.”
“I thought my king wanted to keep me.”  John whispered.  “I thought he loved me… That he would always love me and protect me.”
I dropped my mobile onto the side table, aware that John stood in the doorway to the hall.  He had heard her text alerts.  With a frown he went into the kitchen and started to look through the cabinets.  Finally he couldn’t pretend he was unaffected, and stood behind his chair.  “What did she want?”
Sherlock set the wine down before slouching in bed.  “None.  Deep down there will always be doubt that this is some sort of duty to me.  Perhaps you feel it’s your duty to please me.  I will wonder if I’m being selfish and should let you go back to your lands.”
“Have you ever considered that it’s not your fault?  You take the blame.  Why?  Because he’s the one that blames you?”  Molly shook her head.  “It’s not right.”
And then Sherlock made a frustrated noise in his throat and changed the channel.  The channel they landed on was completely random.  Sometimes Sherlock became bored with telly and expressed that boredom by changing the channel.  It just so happened that the channel they landed on depicted two men kissing.
“I suppose those who are privileged to live in the keep need some open spaces.”  John remarked as he looked about.  “Take it in… This is the last time we’ll be allowed here since we are no longer favored of the king.”
“I am a man of many talents.”  Sherlock answered, entering the hall to cue everyone that they should do the same.  There was a chaos of people as they came in and found their names at various tables around the room.  At the head table sat John, Mary and Sherlock.  Sherlock took a place to the side with John beside him and Mary on the other side.  “Are you pleased?”
Sherlock led the werewolf through the city until they came to the hospital.  Pulling John down into the morgue he smiled at Molly Hooper.  “I’m here for Lestrade’s case.”
“He’s dead.  They are all dead.  The only reason I’m alive is because I went out for a piss.  They didn’t see me.”
John concentrated and immediately felt himself shift from bipedal to quadruped.  “Would you like to come with me?  Could I carry you?”
Lord John followed King William into the court, pleased at the way lords and ladies scrambled to get out of their king’s way lest they be punished.
“Thank you for coming to see me.”  Scott Trevor stated.  His hands were carefully threaded together on his desk blotter, his emotions barely in control.  Years had not been kind to the older gentleman.  There was deep pain in his lined face.
“It’s too much, Sherlock.”  John breathed so none of the guests could hear his familiarity with their king.
“Not that it matters… you’re just an… an ANIMAL!  Animals are often motivated by just their mating drive.”
Sherlock pulled back and gave a wicked grin before pushing John back towards the bed.  His nimble fingers undid John’s trousers and pushed them down his thighs before knocking the lord onto his back and crawling on top of him.  “How long has it been, my lord John Watson?  How long has it been since you’ve shared your bed?”  His hips gave a little thrust, sliding his hardened cock against John’s.
They watched two episodes together before Rosie rolled off the couch and onto the floor to play with her toys.  By the time the third episode ended she was ready for dinner.
“I am not a blushing maiden.”  Irene mused as her fingers undid the lacing for John’s trousers.  Her hand reached in and took his cock, squeezing it gently.  “I do not fear the marriage bed.”
Sherlock shook his head and pulled off the condom, tossing it into the wastebasket beside his bed.  Reaching out, he pulled John into his embrace, “Don’t.”
Sherlock woke, cold and sore.  The cold was full body and bone deep.  There was a shifting movement at his side and he managed to open one eye to catch of glimpse of John sitting up.
“Are you alright?  Did he hurt you?” Sherlock caught John’s face in his hands and turned him this way and that.  “John?”
It wasn’t fair, but as many a tutor pointed out, “Life is rarely fair.”  If life was fair he could claim John as his husband… If John wished it.
It was a small ceremony with Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, my parents, Mycroft, and Rosie in attendance.  We invited Molly, but she declined, telling us it was “too much.”
A fresh wave of slick filled the room with the pungent aroma of Omega in heat.  “Do we have to talk about that right now?”
Bet you thought I forgot about this one, huh?  It's been sitting on my hard drive with a half written second chapter for years.  I suppose I should finish it.  Here's chapter 2!  I should finish up with a chapter 3 in the near future.
“Goodnight.”  John smiled and him and went upstairs to his own room, leaving Sherlock alone and painfully erect.
“I was sixteen.  My father was still alive.  He died later in the war… But at the time we were at peace.  The king called for a tourney to celebrate the prince’s tenth birthday.  I was the youngest to win a tournament.”  John answered.  “The prince awarded me with a token of valor.”
“It’s what I want.”  Sherlock answered and stepped in closer for a kiss.  “I would have you in my bed every night for the rest of my days…”  His arms wrapped around the lord’s waist, pulling him tightly against him.  “You are mine.  I plan to keep you.”  With a nip to John’s lips he pulled away with a smile.  “I will take Moriarty to his punishment… And within the year I will call you to court.  I will never let you leave my side.”  And with that the king grinned like a mischievous child and walked away.  At the door he looked back.  “You will protect him with your life, Lestrade… Or I shall have your head.”
“I do.”  John followed Sherlock to the local inn, conscious of the curious looks he was receiving.  But as far as anyone knew he was just a normal human, right?  The room was small but the bed was big enough for two people.  “Are you sure?”
I changed focus from John to the year old child he had placed in my lap.  “Hello, darling.”  I smiled at her.
“You lay with traitors!  You are weak!”  Magnussen snarled and took a swift step towards Mary, his dagger held before him.  Suddenly he gave a pained groan and fell.  A knife quivered, embedded in his back.
Lestrade chose to ignore Sherlock’s outburst.  “Will Sherlock be in contact with you?  In case we need more information…”
John took a deep breath and spun around, catching the suspect’s hand and forcing him to aim at the ground.  The gun went off, causing many outside the club to scream.  They struggled together and John managed to make the suspect drop his weapon before dropping him to the ground and holding him there.
“M’lord!”  Lestrade looked in.  Realizing what position they were in he cast his eyes to the floor.  “M’lord Sherlock… There is news.”
Watson looked up from his newspaper and caught Sherlock in his sight.  Then his eyes went to the clock on the mantel.  “It is getting late.”
“Well… That is appropriate since you are my first.”  Sherlock chuckled and moved himself between John’s thighs.  In the dim light of the candle Sherlock stared down at John.  “You are mine.  Always… Mine.”
It was in those woods that Sherlock lost his sense of direction while chasing a man with horns on his head.  Said man had been peeping into the windows of the house, causing Sherlock quite the shock to see another living soul.  The horns gave him pause.  But he was lured out of the house and searching the woods before he even thought to put on his coat or scarf.
It was something that made him feel ill sitting in his chambers, waiting for his John to impregnate his new bride, Mary.  What if she managed to get him to fall in love with her?
But John made no move to get up or clean himself.  We lay with him resting a leg on my thighs.  “What brought this on?”
“And you should wear less.  Show me.”  Sherlock replied as he pulled off John’s tunic.  His eyes caught on the twisted scar tissue on John’s shoulder.
“No clue?  No clue why?  Oh why, our king has his eye on you?  You his champion and his knight in shining armor, valiant and brave… More than any other knight?  You don’t know?” Moriarty grinned like a mad man, a flicker of glee in his brown eyes.  “Don’t know why you of all are gifted with his highness, lord of the bed chamber?  To take him deep… Deeper than anyone?  You think you know him?  Know our king because he’s had you?”
“He may not have the length but he has the stamina.”  The man grinned at Watson before tapping the female to sit up.  “This one we call Molly.”
“Look!”  John pointed down to the juncture of his legs.  His genitals were gigantic!  They were too long and dipped towards the ground under their own weight.  “Holy…”
I had often wondered what it would be like to be with John as a lover.  I imagined his cock would be perfect in my hand or in my mouth.  I could make him gasp and whimper like my chips vendor.  I would let him have anything he wanted of me.  It was merely transport after all.  And sometimes when I was alone in my bed it was John I would think about when I took myself in hand.  I longed to hear him breathlessly call my name in a moment of pleasure.
“I brought him home with me because he had no place to go and he was alone… and he’s good with cases.  It helps that he finds my companionship tolerable.”
“Dungeon… Execution.”  Sherlock stated waving his hand as if to dismiss John’s question.  “Lestrade will stay with you for the time being until I summon you.”
Sherlock reached out and lightly traced the scar on John’s shoulder… The one that had ended his military career, ending the only life he had ever felt comfortable in.  His friends never understood.  They attempted to cheer him but he was jealous they still had something that he didn’t.  Sherlock moved in closer and kissed the scar.  The way Sherlock caressed it sent shivers down John’s spine that had nothing to do with the chill of the room.  Sherlock kissed his lips carefully, wrapping his arm around John’s shoulder.  “Can I fuck you?”
“You can never disappoint me.”  Sherlock murmured, wrapping his arm around John’s waist and pulling him back against his bare chest.
John’s hands worked their way down Sherlock’s back, shifting further down with each command of “lower” until he got to the man’s waist.
“I’m being moved outside of the keep.”  John answered.  “That’s just a little farther outside the keep.”
“I’ll send you the footage.  Don’t make any plans until you see it.  I know you… Good day.”  Mycroft hung up and Sherlock ended his side of the call.
“I did no such thing.”  Sherlock remarked and rolled over onto his hands and knees to crawl down to the edge of the bed, closer to John.  “A lord should have his advisers write for him so he can attend to other things.”
Everything John had done… The abuse and the sex had all been Eurus’ doing.  She had known how much John meant to me and used that to harm us both.
Sherlock gave a soft grunt and a sigh as he shifted his knees to open himself wider and allow the soldier room to work.  Eventually Sherlock grew impatient and pushed John’s hand away.  Taking position on top, he slowly easing down.  It was a tight fit and he moaned at the stretch.
“’S good to be king…” Sherlock answered, pushing his tongue into John’s mouth and pulling the other man on top of him.
“He didn’t know how to be a slave.”  John finally looked up at Sherlock’s face.  “You were horrible at it.”
“Good.”  With some effort John managed to get to his feet and held out his hand to help Sherlock up.
“I didn’t penetrate you.”  Sherlock answered as he pressed someplace within John that made the lord cry out and squirm.
“I didn’t realize…  I mean I’ve had sex with humans before and I didn’t think…”  Biting his lips, John nodded to himself.  Idly his hand reached up and touched the bite Sherlock had given him on his trapeziod muscle.  “I’ve never asked to be bitten before.”
“Boring!” Rosie announced to the room, breaking the tension.  In some ways even though she was not Sherlock’s blood, she was his daughter.
The rest of the ride was quiet as both men fell into their own thoughts.  Fifteen minutes before their arrival John woke Rosie so she wouldn’t be groggy when she got out of the car.  As they arrived, Rosie was alert and excited.  The car stopped in front of the house.  The door opened and Sherlock’s parents waved from the porch.
Sherlock quickly gained the upper hand and John allowed him to do as he pleased.  As it happened, that meant straddling John’s hips and pressing lube into John’s hand.  “Prepare me.”
Sherlock released both hands and dismounted before rolling onto his back.  “Come here.  I want to feel you…  Feel you take me.”
I'm still unsure how this will end.  I've written about 2000 words (two chapters) past this point with no end in sight.  If you were to plot me using the series as a guide we're somewhere between Sign of the Three and His Last Vow if that's any indication.
“I can’t change into a wolf several hours before moonrise.  I’m stuck in my human form right now and I will be until it happens.”
Sherlock managed to pull his gaze from the floor to rest on John’s face, more than a little afraid at what he would see there.  Biting his lips, he took a quick breath and held it.
John looked at Sherlock as the detective pretended the entire conversation was completely below him by collapsing in his seat.
“Either way is fine.”  John rolled away and reached into the nightstand to find a tube of lube and a half empty box of condoms.  “Face to face is more intimate… But there’s something rather primal about going at it like animals.”  Checking the expiration date, he found they were still good.  The box told him a couple of things.  Sherlock had sex recently if the number of condoms and the expiration date were anything to go by.  John rolled back over, depositing his finds between them.  Taking a single condom from the box, he dropped the rest behind himself.
“I could have lived without hearing my sister asking you to touch yourself.” I admitted.  “And then she asked why it bothered me… It was just sex.”  I looked away, unable to meet his eyes.  “It was sex with you.”  I gave a helpless laugh and set the child down on the floor.  Immediately she crossed to John’s empty chair and attempted to climb onto it.  I helped her up and she proudly sat there.  “I became aware of something.”
John gave a small shrug.  “What do you want from me, Sherlock?  I’ll give you anything all you have to do is ask for it.”
“These are the Mists of Time.  They separate the mortal world from the Fairy Realm.”  Sherlock answered.  “We have to pass through to reach my world.”  Sherlock took John’s hand and tugged at him.  The soldier followed.
“No, Holmes.  I am sorry.”  Watson sat on the edge of the bed.  “If it will help you, you may touch me.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “Notice his helm is gone… As is his sword.  They were taken from him before he was pushed.  The person who took them needed a guard’s helm and sword to pass for a guard.”
John followed Sherlock back up the stairs to 221B and into the flat.  When Sherlock sat on the couch he hesitated and cocked his head to the side, watching the human pick up the computer.  Without a word the detective started the disc and placed it on the coffee table for John to watch himself holding Ian.
“Do you want to get out of here?  Maybe find a place to get to know each other.”  The young man was handsome, a little too young and handsome for a middle aged man at a gay club.
“They do have names, don’t they?  Most people do.  We can’t go around calling each other ‘you,’ can we?”
Mary sobered and lightly touched John’s hand.  “The one who brought you here… Were you to be their mate?”
“That’s perfect then… we’ll be in touch.  By the way I am Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade.”  Holding out his hand John just stared at it.  “Shake hands?”
“Sit… Sit here…” Vaguely Sherlock patted the grass his face and shoulders had been rubbing against.  “Sit here and let me… I think if I taste you I can slow these enough to get back.”
“No.  I’ll still be here, awaiting my punishment.  I attacked the king.  I took liberties with his person.  My life is forfeit.”
Mary approached Lestrade and gave him a strained smile.  “South tower is fine.  We’ll require servants to move our things.”
“Then do as I ask.”  The voice replied.  “You have two hours.”  The gun pulled back and the flap squeaked shut.
Watson entered the room, keeping his eyes on the floor.  “I am sorry, Holmes.  I did not mean to snap at you like that.  Your hysteria has gotten worse, has it not?”
Meanwhile back in 221B Sherlock watched the disc he had been given.  There were several video files burned onto the disc and he watched them all.  Some showed the pack in wolf form hunting together as a team with a female doctor giving commentary and pointing out various pack members.  Another video showed John holding a newborn cub… cub was the correct word for the child wasn’t human.  It looked like a wolf cub and it was much smaller than a human child.  “Born gestation week eight, day two… This is Ian Sawyer-Watson with his sire, John Watson.”  John glanced at the camera and smiled, holding the cub closer and whispering soft words into the little wolf ears.  Yet another video showed Bill cuddling John, both dressed in loose slacks and plain shirts.  Both were barefooted and looked happy to be together.  In the background other members of the pack were curled up together in pairs.  The same woman who spoke in previous videos informed the viewer that due to only 40% participation in the breeding program that Orange Beta Pack would be sent to another project in a combat unit.  It seemed Sherlock was seeing the pack shortly before it had been sent to war… their leaving the breeding program ensuring their death.
“Do it!” Sherlock commanded.  Another finger slipped in to join the first.  The sensation was filling and Sherlock fought hard not to orgasm on the spot.  There had to be more.  But John spent the next few minutes stretching him and spitting onto his own fingers to loosen him up.  It was frustrating.  Didn’t John know the sooner he used his penis, the sooner Sherlock would ejaculate?  The sooner Sherlock ejaculated, the sooner they would be released?  Then they could go home and forget about Kylo Ren and his Dances with Star Search.
“Yes… keep doing that… and whatever else your body demands.  I’ll let you take it as far as you like.”
“Shower is quickest.”  John answered as he tossed aside his button down and pulled off his vest.  “Do you need help out of the tub?”
“No time for sexual release?”  Sherlock cocked his head to the side.  “Even though you desperately crave it?  But you won’t touch the village whores.  Why not?”
“It’s always about their pleasure… Not mine.  If they immediately make a move for my arse I suck them off and send them on their way.”
“I nearly died.  It grew infected.  Puss and… And it wasn’t pleasant.  You’re lucky… You’re beautiful.  Anyone would want you in their bed.  I’m… I’m no longer whole.”
John wasn’t sure what to expect.  The man who stood before him, bundled up against the cool day, had some of the grace of the drag queen who had given him a phone number.  The eyes were the same.  “So… You’re the peacock.”
It had been foolish to think that John could live happily ever after with Sherlock.  Sherlock had enemies… Mary had enemies.  Those enemies would have made a move eventually.  And it was Sherlock’s fault that John had been dragged into a place of intrigue.
“Please don’t…” I whispered.  There was a bite mark on my upper thigh with a little blood oozing from where he bit me.
John tried not to think about how Sherlock just pushed a wedding ring onto his finger like it was no big deal.  But it was Mary’s wedding ring, not Sherlock’s.  Carefully he positioned it where it belonged.  Would Sherlock give him a ring one day?  If he were to remove Mary’s ring would Sherlock replace it with his own?  Did Sherlock even want that?
John got up from his chair and paced the room.  “That’s not fair!  I didn’t know who she was!  I ended it before I found out who she was!”
Their first night together passed uneventfully.  Greg slept in the old nest while Sherlock and John inhabited their hut.  As John fell asleep he wondered if they should build a second hut for Greg.
Sherlock bit his lips and shifted a bit in the bed so they were face to face.  “You will remain my lover?”
John Watson woke just after dawn, sore and chilled from lying on the ground in just his skin.  Rolling onto his back he stretched and felt something slide off his side.  The scent told him it belonged to a human male.  Carefully he sat up and stared at the coat that lay beside him.  The owner of the coat sat a short distance away watching him.  “Hello?”
“God, yes…” Sherlock moaned, eagerly undoing his flies and allowing the faun to push down his trousers and pants.  His cock was hard and ready for anything the faun had in mind.
John leaned in and glanced at the marks.  “Parabolic dental… prominent canines upper… Transforming werewolf.”
By this time the grass was a mess.  It was alarming the amount.  But John was more concerned for Sherlock’s health.  “What do you need?”
John stood in the bedroom doorway, watching Sherlock nervously unbutton and unzip.  Casually he closed the door in case Rosie wandered downstairs to use the toilet.
Sherlock grinned and lightly kissed John’s cheek.  “Where would I hide my weapon?”  Throwing his leg over John’s thighs he pushed his erection against John’s knee.  “Oh… There it is.”
John stared at me.  His eyes glanced down at my half erect penis.  Licking his lips, he looked me in the eye.  “Do you mean it?”
The man, Sherlock, raised his eyebrows and smiled.  “Funny thing about peacocks… And birds in general… The male is the one with all the bright feathers.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows.  There was plenty he didn’t know about werewolves.  Transforming outside of the full moon was one such thing he didn’t know.  “It’s fine.”
A shadow was thrown over the rock and everyone looked up to see a scowling faun staring down at them in his full Glamour.  Molly’s eyes were wide as she stared at his impressive cock.  Mary smiled, keeping her gaze to the faun’s face.  John looked up and frowned at his partner’s scowl.  “Mary and Molly came for a visit.”
“My lord, we can’t do that!”  Mary protested and turned to Lestrade.  “He didn’t mean it.  Don’t tell his highness he said that. You’re going to get us killed!”  The last phrase was directed at her husband.
Sherlock’s words were a stab at John’s heart and he struggled against his bonds, not wanting to hear anymore.
Watson shut his eyes and turned his head away from Sherlock as if he anticipated what the detective wanted to do to him.
Suddenly there was a rush of grey fur and muscle.  Sharp teeth bit into the gorgon’s arm causing him to cry out.  Moriarty was not prepared for the full grown werewolf that savaged his arm as if it was nothing.
“Don’t worry about it.  I’ll take care of it.”  Really I had no intention of doing anything to the wound, aside from blotting up the blood.  But I didn’t want her assistance in such a delicate area.
John looked down at Sherlock’s erection.  His cock was long and thin.  It was pink on his belly, rooting in a nest of dark pubic hair.  John leaned down and licked along the shaft to the tip.
“Perhaps it’s for the best…” John whispered, holding Rosie tightly.  “A child needs their mother.”  A warm arm wrapped around his waist and a kiss was placed on the back of his head.  “But what if they harm her?”
“It’s NOT a trick!”  Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “I deduce!  I notice little details that the rest of you take for granted or ignore.”
Something cold scratched at John’s skin under his scapula.  His eyes focused on her.  And then he was aware of a presence beside them.
John picked up Rosie and set her on his lap.  “Did you hear that, Rosie?  You might have a little brother or sister.”
“His skin is sensitive due to the impending full moon.”  Sherlock self-consciously closed his own robe tighter as if that made up for John’s state of undress.
“Not you, him!”  Sherlock pointed an accusing finger at Moriarty who had the audacity to look shocked.
John leaned on Sherlock’s leg, watching conflicting emotions run through his human pack mate.  “Sherlock?”
For weeks I forgot.  It was only after I returned from hospital that I remembered.  I felt increasingly distracted as John spent the afternoon with me.  I wanted him to bend me over the table and take me.  Wild fantasies filled my brain.  It was my brain’s reaction to his Alpha scent.  I was only half aware of his admission to cheating on Mary.  My Alpha started to cry and I moved to wrap my arms around him to comfort him.
Sherlock closed his eyes and tried desperately to forget what he had seen.  The unnatural monstrosity that shouldn’t exist… The hound.  And yet as his heart raced his trousers tightened.  It was just as distracting as the obvious hallucination.  Absently he reached down to rub the heel of his hand against his erection, desperately trying to will it away.  The counterpoint of panic and need weren’t helping his frame of mind.
“It’s Sherlock.”  Sherlock answered as he reached out to touch John’s face and kiss him breathless.  “I will always be your Sherlock.”
“Well… I was thinking… you might like some company.  I have a flat… and I can share.  There’s extra room for you and even another flat for you to have privacy during full moon.”
John made some attempt to get him to open the door, knocking and calling through the door.  But Sherlock ignored him.  His fragile heart wasn’t ready to encounter the former bed slave who rejected him.  More than once he nearly tripped over trays of cold tea and stale toast on his way to the bathroom.  The only time he got any peace was when John returned to work.
There was a sound of rustling.  Something or someone stepped out of the bushes and John scrambled for his torch to shine on the bushes.  At first he thought that it was a man for he stood upright.  But then he moved and John dropped his torch in horror.  The man’s legs moved backwards!  With a cry of surprise he desperately tried to move away from the fire even as the man with backwards legs approached.  “What are you?  What are you?”  John cried out as his hand went for his pack to find his gun.
“Fuck… Wait… No…”  Desperately he pulled away and collapsed before me, head bowed and breathing hard.
John followed him up, catching the flashes of the sequined gown Sherlock wore under his coat.  In his hands he held the mask and the rest of Sherlock’s masculine clothes.  It was late and the detective hadn’t bothered to change out of his costume for the ride home.
John lightly kissed his left buttock as he took in Sherlock’s vulnerable position. Between his legs hung his scrotum and his fully erect cock.  “Sherlock?”
Mary gave John a nervous glance before taking a step back for her skirts to reveal that she had been standing over a fallen dagger.  “Your highness… My lord husband…”
“I’m… Honored.”  John managed, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath so he wouldn’t cum too quickly.  Lips kissed him and he kissed back.  Too soon they were probing tongues and clashing teeth as Sherlock continued to roll and grind.  “Fuck…” John gasped when he was finally allowed to breathe.  Sherlock was very much in control.  “Let me touch you.”  His wrists were caught in Sherlock’s grasp.
