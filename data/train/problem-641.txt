“I’m not sure,” John said. None of this made any sense. Outside, the street was quiet and empty, devoid of any signs of life. He could see the yellow glow of the streetlamp, faintly, through the tree branches, and above, the silver glow of the moon. “What are you doing here?” he repeated the question, since Sherlock hadn’t answered it the first time.
“Look, do you even know any Slytherins, or is this just from the stories you’ve heard?” John asked him. “Maybe, if you tried, you’d...oh, I don’t know, make friends?”
“No, not like you two are,” the Head Boy said blandly, and John was trying to decide if he was being mocked. It was very hard to tell. “How many friends do you imagine he has? I am the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.”
In the centre of the crowd, Sherlock was on the floor, and Carl Powers had somehow managed to acquire his books and his homework and he now stood above him, taunting him.
He shouldn’t have come back here. It’s too soon. Sherlock haunts the flat; if he turns, he can see him sitting in his chair. If he listens he can hear the strains of violin playing over the noise of city traffic. Any moment now he’s going to hear the urgent pounding of steps running up the stairs, the banging of a door flung open on its hinges, an imperious voice exclaiming, “
Victor shakes his head. “It wasn’t his fault. He was an addict. I mean, so was I. It was just by pure chance and sheer pigheaded stubbornness that I managed to walk away from my addiction. And I thought about it all the time, and every night I thought about his stupid cyanotic face, and I wondered if tonight would be the night that he’d OD for good, and I thought about what if, over and over and drove myself batty with it and eventually I just had to stop thinking. I found other ways to occupy my time.”
“Then an extra tart for the big fat owl with the sweet beak,” John said, handing Sherlock two tarts. Sherlock laughed at his stupid joke, and John felt like he’d just scored a goal in rugby.
But when he got down the hall, the shower was already running, the bathroom door locked, and Harry’s voice clearly heard singing, “
“Very well, now that we’re not strangers.” He winked at John, and John felt his face burn hot despite the chill of the night air.
Still, he found Sherlock’s absolute confidence reassuring. The Slytherin boy was holding pressure onto the dressing, and he lifted up an edge of it to look at the cut.
“You have a terrible bedside manner,” Sherlock decided, letting his hand drop heavily, resigned to John’s utter heartlessness.
So Sherlock took a step back, and then another, until he had retreated back into his own little comfortable fortress of blankets plus one very heavy Restricted illicit textbook.
It was a Friday when John went over to Jeanette’s house. Her mother was a homemaker and her father worked for Chrysler.
The streets around Baker Street are busy, traffic flowing, people going about with their lives, a world that continues on and on. John sets out with no particular route or destination in mind.
Sherlock came over after a while, the way he usually did, when he was bored of pretending not to know that John was there. His white shirt was marked up with dark streaks of grease, and there was a smudge of it across on sharp cheekbone. His styled hair was tousled and his skin shone with the light sweat of exertion.   Something about the way he moved always set a fire going underneath John’s skin; all sinew and animal grace that John didn’t have and probably wouldn’t know what to do with if he did. The way he looked at John was something else - he had eyes the color of the Potomac in midwinter but his gaze was pure heat, so hot that John thought he might sizzle underneath it. Three years of being pinned underneath that look and it was a wonder he hadn’t completely gone to ash and dust.
He was wound up tighter than he had ever been before, like his insides were all twisted round and round. He felt full of fizz and pressure, like a bottle rocket waiting to go off, and no one could see it.
“That’s all right,” Sherlock’s voice was soothing, low. He leaned in, so close that John thought he might feel his breath through the window. “I keep thinking about you, too.”
“I’ll be careful not to ruin anything,” Victor says as he sets his bag down in the far corner of Sherlock’s room.
Sherlock had graduated school already, with no real prospects and a whole lot of money. He of course did what only the rich and disillusioned could afford to do, which was pretty much nothing. Nothing interested him; everything interested him. One week he would run through a variety of potential professions: privateer, pioneer, engineer, spy; researching each one voraciously. The next week he would want to do nothing other than tinker with his cars and tinker with John, respectively. He was frustrating and incorrigible, utterly spoiled, and mostly he made John laugh.
for posterity… “But it can’t be any wonder to you why I’d want a photo of us together.” One long finger slipped under John’s chin to tilt his face up. “Surely I’ve made it clear to you by now that no matter what you think of them, I see much more in any photo of you than you do?”
He had done the right thing. It would have never worked out. People like John were not friends with people like Sherlock, they were friends with other normal people who wanted to do normal, boring things and he was just saving them both from the inevitable. It was better this way.
Sherlock wants to rub out all those old scars and marks. He wants to cover them with his own. He would rub them out with hands and fingers, with mouth and tongue. With teeth. He would rub and rub at the skin until John forgot them, until all John would remember was Sherlock's touch on him.
“What do you want, John?” Victor asks him. There’s no judgment in his tone. It would be so much easier if there were.
on John’s lips. He kissed him with bruising force, pushing him down onto the bed. With both hands he grabbed John’s wrists, the way he had wanted to, and John arched beneath him, making a little sound into the kiss. Sherlock rubbed his still mostly-clothed body against John’s naked one, earning him a gasp from the rush of friction against a now-eager erection.
“I...ah!” John arched his chest out more in response to the firm squeeze Sherlock gave his nipple on that side. Pain, pleasure and uncertainty melded together beautifully in his expression. He could claim he didn’t like this--and Sherlock wouldn’t argue with him just yet, if John needed time to get used to the idea--but his body told Sherlock the truth.
there, right out in the bloody sitting room, never mind that anyone could walk in at any time!” Victor finishes. “It’s like, look, mate, I didn’t sign up to be part of this one-person nudist colony.”
John shrugged, obviously unable to counter that argument. “I honestly thought you were bored, and it’s all been a sort of experiment.”
He looked anxiously at Sherlock, as if expecting mockery. Sherlock simply nodded in agreement, and decided not to tell John about the monster that he’d kept in his closet for the better part of three years.
John slammed the car door behind him, one arm clutching his bookbag. He started up the path to his house, his own house - real, familiar - bright light spilling out from every window.
Madam Pomfrey sighed, the long-suffering sigh of a much-beleaguered woman who knew when to cut her losses. She cast a quick
goody-two-shoes - that wasn’t who he was. He reached up with a hand and tousled it quickly, before finger-combing it back into place. There. Much better.
John is described by his mother to be a polite, rule-abiding boy. A good student, with healthy interest in sports.
“Be right there, Clara!” Harry called back. She turned to John. “Actually, you know what? We should practise starting now. You must keep my identity a secret, young Watson.”
“I better not catch anything,” Carl muttered, as he and Sherlock were forced to clasp their hands together.
Sherlock let him sit in silence for a while, John determinedly not-squirming, as they sped through through the darkened streets. “I quite like mysteries and crime stories myself,” Sherlock finally confided, and John looked over in shock. In spite of himself, he'd wanted this cool stranger's approval, and found himself basking in this shared, secret interest.
“Because I can’t unhinge my jaw and eat half my body weight in one sitting,” Sherlock drawls. "I’d rather not eyeball him, if it’s all the same to you.”
John never had to do anything alone. There was always Mike and Bill and sometimes Sarah even though she was a girl. He was getting to know some of the other people in his house, too, like Greg, who always smiled at him. He always had someone to save him a seat somewhere.
Victor cocks his head at him curiously, dark eyes glittering with amusement. He lets his lashes drop, hooded gaze for a moment, regarding John. John feels a hot sensation, tingling just underneath his collarbones. “Oh, yes,” Victor says, “Before it got bad, it was so, so
Sherlock shrugged his jacket off with brisk efficiency. His hands went to the buttons of his collared shirt, popping open the first two in a matter of seconds before John placed his hands on top of Sherlock’s and stopped him.
Skin stretched tight over bone, faceless thing with a black hole for an open mouth and dripping teeth
“I told you not to worry about expulsion,” Sherlock said impatiently. He pressed on the dressing a little harder than necessary for emphasis on each syllable of
“They say owls have wisdom, but that’s erroneous,” Sherlock continued. “They’re not any wiser than any other type of bird or creature with similar brain size, which of course is miniscule. They have great big bodies but these puny little brains. Crows are actually the smartest bird.”
Sherlock’s tongue, his cock, plunging into him at the same time. His tongue was sliding in, slippery, caressing the soft pink velvet of John’s tongue, exploring his mouth. And then more of it, and still more, it was completely filling up his mouth, it seemed to lick the back of his throat. It slithered in like a    black     serpent, it seemed to push in, all the way down his throat, sliding down,   down,    to his insides, to lap at his organs, and John couldn’t breathe,     he couldn’t breathe
There was something in the water with him, a thing of pallor and shadow. Its sleek dark head was small like a child’s, although Hazel knew that it was not a child. It was not human. Its skin was pale and milky, wet and gleaming in the moonlight -
“Well, I never!” Madam Pomfrey declared. “Mr. Holmes, control yourself! That’s ten points from Slytherin for misconduct-”
John’s huff was a little breathless. “Fine. Fine, but if you ever show it to anybody else, I’ll tell Mrs Hudson what
“What have I told you about swimming where Mummy can’t see you?” Hazel scolded. “You’ve frightened me and Daddy and a whole heap of other people!”
They climbed into the cab together, with a little struggle and some interesting choreography, because John had somehow forgotten how to work his limbs. As they sat down John lay his head back, closing his eyes.
Momma quietly, gracefully bore the heat as if it were her penance; one would never know she was suffering just to look at her. It was important, she always stressed to John and Harry, that they put on their best face for Sunday service. And so he and Harry always showed up with their faces scrubbed bright and clean, their clothes in order, pants pressed, ironed dress, shoes shining, and although Harry sometimes whined that it was her God-given right to have a little dirt on her knees, John rather suspected that a pristine appearance was more for the benefit of their earth-bound neighbors than any heavenly eyes.
“Sherlock, don’t,” John protests, and pushes at his shoulders, but not hard. Definitely not hard enough for him to actually mean it, or for Sherlock to take him seriously. When Sherlock catches his wrists and pins them, easily, John only moans softly.
“What?” asked Sherlock, confused, because he thought he’d just started to get a grasp on this whole bat-man thing. Apparently not.
His bike chain had snapped. The bike lay useless on the ground, like a downed animal, with its wheels hissing, still spinning in helpless rotations.
, the lights turning off from the back, moving to the front, the darkness moving forward.  John felt a spike of panic stab through his heart as he lept to his feet, snatching up his bookbag with one hand. The library was closing now. That meant curfew was soon.
“Don’t be sad,” Sherlock cooed. He rubbed at John’s chest, right over his heart. “We’ll be best friends, and play all day. No one would ever tell you ‘no’ or ‘don’t’ or yell at you. You’d never get in trouble. Doesn’t that sound nice?”
What he does know is that some indiscernible amount of time later (and some indiscernible racket later), Victor is placing a hot cup of tea in his hands. John takes a sip. It is the worst cup of tea he has ever had: too bitter, too milky, and far, far too sweet, all at the same time.
Eyes squeezed shut. He could barely open them. When he did, looking at Sherlock was too much, made him feel even more; the dark blue intensity of his   (
A breach.  Something firmer, slender - fingers. At first just one, slippery with something, pushing into him, inside of him, entering him, opening a place that John didn’t think could open, he didn’t know you could enter.
He did not look so powerful, on his knees and cradling his stomach with the red seeping out between his fingers, begging for his life. He did not look so dangerous, with the tears, and the saliva, and the mucus, all of it dripping down his face, with a mouth that could only say, “Please, let me live,” and “Please, God, let me live” and “Jesus,” over and over again.
“He didn’t even need to be in the flat,” John says. “You read the one where we were in Buckingham Palace…?”
“Maybe they were baby teeth?” John offered. “I once bit an apple and two teeth came out at the same time.”
Although his prayers had been answered, although he’d been strong, he couldn’t help thinking that this relief felt awfully similar to disappointment.
In a paper published this year, David Ritz Finkelstein, P.h.D., discusses regions out in space where the gravitational fields are so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.
“I could try and get you some bubble wrap,” said John. “It’s exactly like popping these things...except without the pus and the wriggling and the petrol farts. They don’t explode, though.”
Sherlock’s body twisted and he moved towards the water, and then, with one, two leaps he was in the water, disappearing quickly into the waves that lapped against the rocks.
“Sherlock,” the boy replied, and he held out his other hand expectantly, for John to take. It wasn’t a name like any John had ever heard before, although he’d only just started school and certainly hadn’t heard all the names there ever were.
“Why don’t you go find a seat at the Slytherin table?” hissed Athelney Jones, a dark-skinned fifth year boy with green eyes; the only thing John knew about him was that he was on the Quidditch team. And that he now hated John, apparently. “I’m sure you’d be welcome there.”
The shells and stones in his pail were dry now, and they revealed themselves to be such dull shades of brown and grey, no longer the gleaming jewels they’d seemed when he had first picked them up from where they had been embedded in the wet sand. That was exactly what had happened to his whole afternoon, his whole day, his whole life. The water had all dried up from it, leaving behind only dullness and salt.
“Shh, John,” said Sherlock. He bent down, closer, until John could feel the whisper of his breath over his face. “Don’t worry. There is only me.”
“I saw something, Tom,” she said, after a moment. She shuddered to remember it. “There was...something in the water with him.”
Over on the sofa, John looked up from his work applying leather conditioner into his best boots, favourite belt and pocket holster. “You what.”
“Your Mummy’s not here, John,” Sherlock said, soft little voice going low for a second. The way  Sherlock said his name was funny, with a little musical hum to it. It made a hum vibrate through John's body as well, as if he were a string on a guitar or a harp being gently plucked. Sherlock's tail swished back and forth, the water curving out in tranquil waves around him. “Just a little look?”
“No,” John told him, kissed both his hands, “No,” kissed his face, “No, I couldn’t,” cupped Sherlock’s face with both hands trembling and kissed his mouth. “Just you, only you.”
Potions class had officially started about ten minutes ago, but in truth it started about four minutes and thirty seconds ago, because the interim was how long it took to get both the Gryffindor and Slytherin classes to settle down.
“I wasn’t going to,” said Sherlock. “But then I remembered something we could do.”  He tapped his fingertips, three times, against John’s closed fist.
"You don't seem very afraid," the Slytherin boy remarked, with barely-suppressed amusement. He stepped in closer, polished shoes tapping on the flagstone, forcing John to tilt his head back to make eye contact.
She had gotten solidly reprimanded for that, of course. There was nothing wrong with being a Muggle, as their father was, and so were most of their friends. John admired his father very much, who was a strong, brave man, and very smart besides, and in any other instance, he would have been proud to be compared to Dad. In this instance, however, Harry drove him to near tears.
,” even though it wasn’t the least bit true, Sherlock rather thought that his life choices were not half bad.
“You love playing on the beach so much, don’t you?” she said, needing the sound of a human voice in the eerie stillness.
Towards the front of the Church, above the altar, hung a giant crucifix. The Son of God sculpted in exquisite, loving detail; from the soft curls of his brown hair to every straining muscle, long lashes resting gently upon his cheeks, serene and beautiful in his suffering.
The shame and the guilt came crashing down on him only seconds afterwards, as he lay panting in the dark, confronted with the warm, wet mess of his own sin all over his hand. But it would not stop him from repeating the experience the next night, nor from nodding yes when Sherlock asked him, the next day, whether he wanted a ride home from school.
“But why, Mummy?” John asked, blinking away the drops of water from his dark gold lashes. “I was only swimming.”
John was glad his head was down so Sherlock couldn’t see and deduce him.  He had to gather his thoughts before he could handle that.  Oh GOD he wished he wasn’t so wrecked this morning.
John knew when Sherlock was frantic for a case.  When he barely restrained his energy and begged for work, for cigarettes, for distraction.  John imagined that’s what Sherlock would look like on the edge of losing control, and wondered if he’d ever shown that look to another person.
Just over 2 hours from London via train and ferry, the Isle of Wight was far enough and DIFFERENT enough from London to feel like an exotic vacation.  John had booked a room in a B&B in Shanklin, overlooking the Channel.  If the weather was clear, they could go to Queen Victoria’s summer palace and private bathing beach.  Once again, John was hoping for the worst- a rainstorm, perhaps a hurricane.  Anything to keep Sarah inside their comfy looking room instead of tramping all around the island.
The pressing stopped and Sherlock nodded, deep in thought.  “Alright then.  Let me take care of you for a moment.”  He slid back, putting his face in John’s crotch.  He looked up and winked again and John could have sworn that every drop of blood in his body rushed to his cock.
By the time Lestrade returned, panting and bruised, John was standing calmly by the trussed thug, rubbing his knuckles and thinking.  The criminal was out cold, bleeding from his nose, his lip, and a cut on the right side of his face.  Lestrade raised his eyebrows.
As much as he enjoyed having his fingers in her pussy and her hands around his cock, John realized he’d much rather have his cock in her pussy and her pussy around his cock.  He pulled his fingers out and began to move, starting to slide over her to get between her legs.  She released him, her hands running up his sides.  He reached for the condom he’d put on the bedside table and put it on, then slicked it just a bit.  He raised up and felt his cock brush against her as he got into position.  She reached down to take a hold of him and guide him into position.  Almost there…his tip touching her lips.  She pushed back a little, and he stopped- allowing her to guide their actions.  She moved him up and down a bit, rubbing the head of his cock along her slit.  She was so wet, and John couldn’t remember when he’d been as hard.
“No, I’m none of those things, but mostly, I’m not HIM.”  Sarah shook her head.  “Go on.  Keep in touch and let me know you’re ok.  This discussion isn’t finished, but we can’t continue it now.”
“I feel… painful.  My ribs, my ankle, my chest, my back.  Everything hurts, John.  What happened?  What day is it?  When do I go home?”
So, John went to church.  Not on Sundays, not when there were people.  But he’d slip in on Tuesday mornings, when the old women were cleaning, or the Saturday afternoons when the choir practiced.  It didn’t matter if it was Catholic, or Methodist, Lutheran, or Synagogue.  One time he even went to a Sikh Temple.  He wallowed in his depression, feeling a little better each time he made himself feel a little worse.
“Mycroft tells me you were injured abroad.”  It was a question in the form of a statement.  Like the Holmes brothers, Mummy expected people to answer even the unasked.
He slowly ran his hands under the elastic of her hips, keeping his mouth on her stomach.  Might as well go all out, he tugged a little and she lifted her ass to make it easier.  Now she was completely naked, and he sat for a moment admiring her.  She was gorgeous.  His glance was interrupted by an outstretched arm tugging on him.
John grinned, knowing that once again, Sherlock had missed one key point with his initial deduction.
“Molly.  Please.  We both know I was right about that.  Your work needs, DEMANDS a better song.  It will be the final piece.  The hypotenuse that completes the triangle of the performance.  My dancing, and, well, your architecture, require a song that will hold its own, or why bother at all?  You need something to withstand the passion.”
John nodded again, having already slipped his pistol out of the back of his jeans.  He still hadn’t spoken a word, his mouth tight and his eyes hard.
As he showered, Anthea slipped in to the flat and left a sandwich, then slipped out again.  John didn’t question who left it, just ate it, and collapsed onto the sofa.
Holmes Manor? Semi-Formal? Black Lounge? John blinked slowly. He was sure these were all proper English words, but he was having a difficult time assigning meaning to them.
Quite simply, A. Rhys Jones was stunning.  Tall, pale but not sallow, with auburn curls and green eyes that belied Irish ancestry instead of Welsh as his name suggested.  He wore a black tuxedo, but instead of the traditional white shirt, his was midnight blue with sparkling studs.  His smile was easy, and his dimples…  well, John always appreciated dimples on a woman, and was surprised to learn he felt the same way about them on a man.
As quickly as he could, he disentangled himself from the still-sleeping detective and slid from the bed.
“What?  Your mum?  You mean I…”  John didn’t finish his sentence either.  In a rare moment of deduction, he understood by the murderous look in Sherlock’s eyes that saying “I had a chance with her?” would have been more than a bit not good.  He kept it to himself, and instead said “You’re over exaggerating, Sherlock.  She’s not interested in me, why would she be?  I’m ordinary.”  He rubbed his hands and turned to the food.  “Now- tell me what all this stuff is.  Is that blackberry jam?”
Sherlock snorted.  “He’s had hangovers before, and if anything, he should be embarrassed about his behavior.  Honestly, he YELLED and recited bad movie poetry.”
has thrown him for a loop!  I don’t know how else to put it, because I don’t know how much of it he actually sees it himself.  But Sherlock, if you two don’t pull your heads out of your own arses and realize that you’re mad for each other, you’ll both lose it all.  And then what will you do?”
John’s mind was reeling.  He’d been in similar situations dozens of times.  He knew how it could end up and it terrified him.  There was no doubt in his mind that he wanted this woman, there were just a few doubts that she wanted him in return.  But could he?  With Sherlock’s mother?
John waited for Sherlock to get out of surgery.  He dozed in the uncomfortable hospital waiting room chair, watched TV with no sound, drank innumerable cups of watery hospital coffee.  By midnight he was exhausted and wired, starving and queasy.  Had it only been that morning when he’d woken up with Sarah?
Shit.  Was that last one out loud?  Did he care?  Not really, but he needed the job, so he hoped it wasn’t out loud.  The lady didn’t seem offended, so maybe it was just in his head.
“I know where we are, I know how many steps there are to my own FLAT.  Stop treating me like an invalid.”  Sherlock was fuming.  His chest was wrapped tightly to ease the pain in his ribs,  he was using crutches to keep off his ankle, the incision in his left side itched and his head was pounding.   All he wanted was to stop feeling terrible.
John didn’t open his eyes.  “Hmmm?”  He snuggled his face onto Sherlock’s thighs as he lay across the couch, dozing while Sherlock wandered his Mind Palace.
She screwed her eyes shut and hissed her breath and inhaled, and he felt her brace her thigh muscles.  For a moment, there was nothing, then there was everything.  She released her breath with a cry and nearly bucked him off with the strength of her orgasm.  She continued to rub her pussy as she shattered against him, and he was still restrained from pounding as he wanted.  But she quickly moved her hand and grabbed at his hips.  “Harder, John.  Fuck me harder. Ungh…harder!”
Sherlock felt John relax more, and spread his fingers out through John’s short hair.  John made a happy noise in the back of his throat, but suddenly tensed and pulled back.
Sherlock was sprawled on the couch, one arm flung up covering his eyes.  His knees were drawn up, and John could see his pale toes scrunched into the cushions.  He looked comfortable, but cold to John’s eye.
“But it’s a beautiful hymn!  It conveys exactly what I want it to!  That God’s love revives us every day and that’s why I built this building like this!  Listen!”
John knew that RSVP meant that he should let someone know that he would be attending the recital. But there was no number to call, no email, and not enough time to send a response via post. He didn’t attend many posh parties, ok- ANY posh parties to be truthful, and didn’t want to mess this one up right out of the gate.
Once John was again comfortable, Sherlock increased the pressure of his caresses.  A little lower, a little closer to John’s nipples… enough to hint, but not enough to distress.  He needed to know what John would accept.  But he was patient, surprisingly so.  He took his time, knowing that this was too important to rush, knowing that he was forming their future with his hands.
“What you need, Molly, is a song that tears you open.  That lets everything out, empties you, so that whatever is waiting to come in, can.  You’ve built this chapel, a symbol of hope, but it’s not finished.  It’s not complete.  You need a song that says that- and not in a ‘Woe is me’ kind of way, but in a ‘I am missing a vital part of myself and if I don’t find out what it is I’m going to die’ kind of way.  Your church is missing vital parts, and I can dance them, but you need to find the right song.”
accusation to call anyone a Dark Wizard, and if you seriously believe that someone is one, then that is a case for Ministry Investigation by the Auror Department. A false accusation, of course, is equivalent to fraud, and can result in a hefty fine at very least, and a short period of imprisonment at the most.”
Victor shakes his head. “I’m shocked that he never told me about you. I mean, we didn’t talk much, anymore, and it wasn’t as if I expected an official announcement, but a text would have been nice.”
He’d been so grateful, then, for the secrecy of their room in the dark. But now, able to see Sherlock’s breathtaking face in the light of their living room, he wondered how much he’d missed. The way Sherlock’s mouth went slack with pleasure at the sight of his own fingers moving in and out of John, the flare of his fine nostrils at the scent of musk and sweat that suffused the air around them, the raw intensity of having
He found the dog underneath the leafy shadows of some ferns. Being a boy of strong constitution, he did not yell or scream, although he did let out a singular gasp. He could taste the forest air in his mouth, the loamy scent of earth and rich pine.
“We move around a lot,” Sherlock told him. “Never stay in one place for too long. I bet you’ve lived here your entire life, haven’t you?”
There was no time for hesitation. He forced himself back up, bookbag on his shoulder, pulling his bicycle back up onto its wheels despite the stinging in his palms and the soreness in his knees, and the pain in his leg that made him limp, just a little.
John slid his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, leaning back as Sherlock supported him. Sherlock held him there for a moment, eyes searching John’s face for something undefinable. He was so close. John found himself, once again, captivated by the flecks of green in his eyes, lost in the icy pallor of them. He could see every individual eyelash, the thin shadows they cast over Sherlock’s cheeks. He felt his breath and pulse quicken on primal instinct, blood stirred by the danger of what he wanted.
to. But all the stories that Victor told him are coloured with it now - the time they broke into the university pool and went skinny dipping together takes on an entirely different context. (How “It’s not as fun as you think it’s going to be, but, you know, we managed,” was about more than just
“Isn’t around anymore,” John finished for him. Sherlock kept looking at him, expectantly, and if John weren’t careful he would spill all his secrets to those moon-pale eyes.
There was a yawning pit in his stomach that would swallow him if he let it. He could not let it. Instead he pedalled his bike over to Sherlock’s house. Sherlock lived in one of those neighborhoods where the houses were big and white, with the lawns rolling out in front of them in thick carpets, lush and green. They had pools in the backyard, fountains or animal statues in front. On the side of the house, the Holmeses had a separate three car garage that Sherlock had taken over with his engines and experiments.
And lower still - Sherlock’s hands spreading his thighs open, John spreading for him as if on instinct, so easily. A gasp - then almost a shout - when Sherlock’s tongue lapped at the head of his... his cock - that sensitive and wet place. John clapped a hand to his own mouth, mortified but unable to stop the sounds otherwise - the whole neighborhood would hear him.
The night air rushed into the room, autumn’s chilling breath upon John’s face, slipping in between his pajama shirt and his skin. He shivered. John looked down at his hands, remembered the ice-like smoothness of the windowpane beneath his fingertips. He gave himself a sharp pinch to his own arm, and was rewarded with a bloom of pain.
There was a rack of potions next to the bed, gleaming in their peculiar bottles: reds and blues, greens and golds. John wanted to touch them all; or, even better, try them, to see what they
“Who was it?” John asked, reaching out to smooth a hand over the cranium. It was so surreal, so disturbing and yet so cool at the same time that it was a real human skull.
There had to be some explanation. There was always some explanation. Hazel wrapped her arms around herself.
“Hmph!” said Sherlock, who felt a need to express his general displeasure. His fingers gently probed John’s swelling left eye; John winced but did not flinch away. “I don’t think anything’s broken. Do you think you can make it to the Infirmary, or do I need to carry you?”
John Watson, clean-cut with his cardigans and glasses, hair like corn silk bronzing in the sun. White bread wholesome. The creases in his trousers starched stiff, ironed rigid and neat, straight as a knife’s edge. Clean pressed shirt and shoes spit-shined bright as new pennies.
over it, barely grazing it with his teeth. John felt like whining already and fought to keep it in. It was amazing how quickly Sherlock got him hot, as if he had been trained into erotic reflex over years of conditioning.
If he closes his eyes and listens, there it is - next to the beat of his heart. He can feel it like a pulse, often unnoticed,  always present. Melancholy is the melody, and how it haunts him. It slithers into all the dark crevices of his mind, curls up like a snake in the hollow.
He drew himself up and looked in the mirror.  He was Captain John Watson, M.D. dammit.  And he could do this.
“John, that was amazing.  You’ve made a beautiful thing, I can’t even imagine how you must be feeling right now.”
“Oh no need, John. I’ve already taken the liberty to mark both of you down as attending. Your invite was just a courtesy. I assumed you would be Sherlock‘s plus one, and he is, after all, a required guest.”
He flipped to the second photo.  “Nothing here.  John’s back is turned, how am I supposed to work with that?  He’s thoroughly engrossed in the buffet.  Fish-berry jam.”  Sherlock smiled a little at that.  “That woman behind me is looking at John with interest, the man next to her is looking at his watch with impatience.  I am looking…”  He stopped.  “I am looking at John.  Why am I looking like that?”  He thought back to their conversation.
Sherlock put the photos down and listened for any movement in the flat.  Nothing from upstairs, nothing from his room.  He needed… he really needed John to make some tea.  He sighed.  He supposed he could make his own tea.
John started, and stepped back.  The spell was broken, and both men flushed.  “Um.  Feeling a bit better?”  John sputtered.  “Let’s get you into the shower then.”
Sherlock looked surprised at John’s voice.  “What?  No.  Not you, John.  I was talking to Rhys.  Please stop interrupting our conversation.”
“Rhys?  Rhys wake up.  You have to leave.  Now.”  Sherlock put the photo down and strode into his room.
Dinner was simple, some cheeses, crackers, wine and fruit they’d picked up at the market.  Neither of them was eager to interact with a whole lot of people, and both were eager to get back to the room.
Sherlock groaned and nodded.  Days of torture, plus days of hospitalization had left him fairly rank, even though the nurses had cleaned him up some.  He could barely stand himself.
He bustled around, getting the kettle ready.  He absently pulled down two mugs, then a third, then stopped when the music did.  “Rhys?  Would you like a cuppa?”
“I’d have tea.  And I’d have John.”  Sherlock smiled.  He looked at Rhys and felt a twinge.  He wasn’t such a bad man, he just wasn’t John.  “You have to go, Rhys.  I can have Mycroft send a car to take you to Holmes Manor.  Mummy will continue to sponsor you, and I do hope to be invited to future concerts.  But this… relationship we’ve been having is over.”
Sherlock’s suit was dark gunmetal grey, with a windowpane check in silver. No tie or waistcoat, of course, with a deep aubergine shirt and matching square. If John thought HE looked like a movie star, he couldn’t imagine what galaxy Sherlock belonged to. He swallowed and looked away while Sherlock harangued the tailor and made arrangements to have everything delivered to Baker Street.
After the first verse though, Sherlock danced off behind a wall of umbrellas.  “Primark” John’s brain helpfully supplied.  Other dancers slid in from the wings, all holding umbrellas and dressed in black.  The music changed and the lighting rig lowered while the backdrop was raised.
They pulled back and looked at each other.  John was completely frozen, his eyes wide open, his jaw dropped.  Sherlock frowned and leaned in again, putting his hand gently on the back of John’s head.
“Drink your tea.  I made yours fairly weak.”  Sherlock pressed John’s mug into his hands.  It felt warm, familiar.  John closed his eyes as he raised it to his lips.  He relaxed as he sipped.
Sherlock‘s eyes were hard.  “John.  I need you to tell me what you know about what happened to me, then I need you to get the police reports from Lestrade.  I don’t want anything held back.  I’m missing time.  I need it back.  It’s MINE.”
As John heaved and moaned in the loo, Sherlock sat quietly, thinking back to his conversation with Lestrade earlier that morning.
John’s days blurred.  It didn’t even bother him anymore, that he wasn’t onstage.  At least, that’s what he told himself every time he clocked in for another shift at “Regular Chemist.”  Christ.  Even the name of the place was boring.
As the applause died down, the next piece started, again- John was mesmerized and Sherlock entranced.  By the end of the concert (6 pieces in all) Sherlock looked positively undone, flushed and breathing hard, his pupils dilated to a point John had never seen before.  He grinned at the thought.  His stoic flat mate, aloof and above, wrecked.
“I’m fine, Molly.  Do you happen to have a bottle of water?  I left my flat in such a hurry, I didn’t bring one.”
John’s smile faded and he sighed again.  He clenched his jaw and swallowed again.  Instead of looking at the ceiling, he looked at his hands as he spoke quietly.  “I was holding your hands, talking to you.  Telling you how confused I was, and how tired, and how I didn’t know what to do.  You woke up and told me to get in bed and sleep, that we’d talk later.”  He looked up at Sherlock.  “Guess we finally got to that part, eh?”
Mummy has a protégé, a dashing, talented, posh young cellist. She holds a salon concert for him, which Sherlock and John attend.
John’s eyebrow raised again, and Sherlock could see him swallow nervously.  “Trust me, John.  Please.”
Once down in the reeking arches, John looked for anyone familiar.  A tall, pale, dark haired detective would be the best, but he’d settle for the mousy woman in the dingy parka they’d once talked to.  It took about 10 minutes, but he found her, back against the wall as she sat warming her hands by a fire kindled in a can.
“A higher power that loves unconditionally?  Let me tell you a story.  I have a sister, Harriett.  Everybody calls her Harry, and she was always encouraged to be a tomboy.  Played footie with the boys, went fishing with our dad, always in jeans, always a bit rough around the edges.  So, one day she shows up at the house with a girl on her arm.  Says she has a girlfriend now.  Never saw her smile so hard in my life.  Well, my parents grabbed her and marched her right upstairs.  Threw her in the shower, cleaned her up, put her in a dress and drove immediately to the church.  D’you know what happened there?  The priest listened to her ‘confession’ and made her kneel for two hours with her arms outstretched, praying and begging God’s forgiveness for her unholy and unnatural ways.  Then, on Sunday, he called her out during Mass, and told the whole congregation that my sister, my darling Harry, was a sinner, and no amount of our prayers would save her from Hell.  That God had already judged her for her depravity, and there was nothing more that any of us could do.  Harry ran right out of church and right into a bottle.  She believed that son of a bitch and there’s not a damn thing I can do to help her.  So no.  I don’t really believe in a higher power that loves unconditionally.  I just like to pretend sometimes that there is.  Because what else is the point?  Why do we live, if there’s no all-powerful love?”
What on EARTH could MUMMY be apologizing to John for?  Mummy never apologized for anything.  No one in the Holmes family apologizes.
He went into the flat through the kitchen door, that was the closest to the bins.  No sense in dragging junk mail into the house any further than he had to.  Bills went on the sideboard, and he turned the large envelope over in his hands.
Sherlock had been without a case for over 24 hours, and hated the world and everything in it, particularly a smug John.
There were many things that John envied about Sherlock, but at this moment, the Mind Palace was at the top of the list.  To be able to compartmentalize, to put something away and think about it later.  John’s mind wasn’t nearly as dull as Sherlock thought, he was a doctor after all.  He was a crack shot and a good officer and a smart man.  But he could not turn his thoughts on and off without distractions.
Sarah spread her legs a little wider, and John moved to put his mouth on her ass.  He loved, LOVED tasting his partners, he loved running his tongue over skin and feeling muscles beneath his teeth.  He nipped and licked at Sarah’s ass cheeks until she began to moan and roll her hips.
The third photo made Sherlock understand Lestrade’s compliment.  He and John did look quite good.  John, over his initial discomfort was smiling his real smile, full of genuine emotion.  John smiled a lot, but this particular KIND of smile didn’t come out very often.  But it did that night, and it was aimed full force at Sherlock.  Interesting.
He went to sit in the last chair of the last row, but felt a hand at his elbow.  “You are NOT leaving me to sit up there alone,”  Sherlock whispered, as he steered John to the front of the room.  “Mummy insists I sit up there, since I’m the musician in the family.”  John found himself in the front row, sitting between Sherlock and an ancient relative introduced as “Auntie Vera.”  “LOVELY TO MEET YOU!” she boomed, obviously deaf as a post.  “IT’S BEEN TOO LONG SINCE SHERLOCK BROUGHT ANYONE SPECIAL HOME.”  John tried to explain that they were just friends, but was cut short by Mummy’s arrival.
“NO.  I’m going to the sofa.  If you are all to be believed, I’ve been in bed for days already.  I do not wish to spend any more time there.”  Sherlock knew the hospital staff was right, logically, but he couldn’t trust it yet.  His brain was still fuzzy around the edges, and he couldn’t trust it either.  Until he could, he had to treat everything with skepticism.
John’s mouth moved to her nipple, his tongue slipping out to run a tight circle around it.  It was so stiff and inviting that he closed his mouth around it, sucking and pulling on it a bit as his hand found the other and began to rub and squeeze.  Sarah moaned and arched against him, her hands running through his hair as she rolled her head back and forth.
Sherlock nodded, sliding one arm behind John to pull him in closer.  John’s head fell back and he held his breath.  One more thrust and he was lost.  Over the edge, gasping and moaning Sherlock’s name, his body jerking with each pulse into the soft mouth.
The scene in front of him was eerily familiar, but at the same time all wrong.  Sherlock was in his chair with his laptop, dressing gown and pajamas on.  Rhys was in John’s chair, reading, also in pajamas.
John swallowed and nodded.  The week’s traumas had robbed Sherlock of what little extra body fat he’d had stored up.  He looked… fragile.
After a brief moment’s silence, the auditorium erupted in a roar.  The emcee tried to corral the proceedings, but the hooting, screaming, clapping, and whistling went on for several minutes as Sherlock and the dancers stood smiling and dripping onstage.  The noise drove the meter off the charts, with nobody sure of exactly how much money was raised from Sherlock’s blockbuster performance.
John worked at the clinic on Sunday, went to the pub with Lestrade Sunday night, and worked again on Monday.
“Right then.  Greg- the cold cases are on the desk by the window, Mycroft- check the kitchen for any experiments.  Last I knew it was something with acid and fingertips.  I’ll look in his room to start.”
“Shhh… you don’t want to draw attention to yourself, do you?“  John was well aware that while Sarah was visible to any passers-by, he was not, and took great delight in the knowledge.
When the nurse checked in hours later, she found the doctor and the detective curled together in the narrow bed.  She turned out the light, backed out, and called Mycroft.
Twisted fortune shone on him though, and Lestrade called Friday afternoon.  Double murder.  The bodies were found in the Thames, headless, naked.  When John got Sherlock’s text he grinned and thanked… well.  He grinned.  He and Sarah were on their way.
When he got downstairs, the parlor was empty, the cello case gone.  He relaxed, not even realizing he’d tensed up in the first place.
As he pondered his options over a fresh cup of tea, he heard steps on the stairs, and a knock at the open parlor door.
The next morning, John checked his messages on  his newly-revived mobile.  Two missed calls from Lestrade, one from Mycroft.  He looked at Sarah’s phone- also a missed call from Mycroft’s number.  John had never given anyone Sarah’s number.
“Well, that’s nice of you to say, and I really hope so, but…” John trailed off, wondering if this boy somehow had the power to read his mind.
Sherlock fucked him ruthlessly, voraciously. He wanted to consume him. His thrusts were brutal; as if he could tattoo his ownership onto John with every smack of skin upon skin.  John gave himself over so willingly. He allowed himself to be used, an eager little fucktoy, an instrument for pleasure. He let himself be consumed.
It felt warm and nice where his wrist touched Sherlock’s, almost a glowy sort of feeling, John thought, and it didn’t hurt.
John was so sensitive. He was wonderfully responsive. He made Sherlock want to lay him down on an examination table and figure him out. Surely he couldn’t have been like this with his girlfriends. But then again he’d never had a girlfriend who wanted to investigate him the way that Sherlock did, to unravel him and explore him and make a discovery of him. He’d never had a girlfriend who had heard him beg, who could make him cry and beg and come all in the span of sixty seconds. He had never had a girlfriend who had owned him.
. His hot little body shudders underneath Sherlock’s, his fingers curling into the styled strands at the nape of Sherlock’s neck, arching up into the press of lips, of tongue, of teeth.
Sherlock put one hand on John’s wrist to stop him. John hadn’t realized that he had instinctively made an attempt to preserve his modesty until Sherlock prevented it. Sherlock’s hand was warm on his, fingers circling his wrist. Sherlock’s eyes were on his face, reading everything; the false bravado, the flicker of nervousness, the intense arousal. John shivered, feeling totally bare.
They make quick work of his shirt, joining the suit jacket and Sherlock's leather jacket on the floor. John’s eyes upon him, on the long, lean lines of his body; the dizzying rush of being the singular point of John Watson’s attention. Sherlock cups John’s face on either side with both hands, blocking out peripheral vision, until all John can see is him.
He wanted to turn away but he couldn’t. He wanted to hear what else Sherlock had to say, but he knew he shouldn’t.
Mrs. Donovan had heard from Mrs. Hooper who’d heard from Mr. Wilkes who had heard from the milkman that the Sheriff’s cruiser had been seen outside of the Watsons’ house last night.
“Come on,” John breathed. The line of his throat was tense with want. “Hurry up already,” he said, his turn to be impatient.
“It’s a shame when people are Sorted wrong, isn’t it?” said Violet Smith, who John had thought was rather pretty until she said that. She tossed her long blonde hair. “Maybe we can petition to have traitors transferred.”
Sherlock would be kicked out of home. And what university would take John, if they knew? How could he ever become a doctor? No one wanted to be touched by a
things that I could be doing. Yeah, lots of things. Productive things. Good luck, John! I’ll be praying for you.”
” Mike hissed. John turned to see Sherlock walking down the hall, gripping his small stack of books tightly to his chest, head held high.
There was a tightness in Sherlock’s eyes, a flare of need, but his voice was gentle. “All right, all right,” he said. He pulled back, rolled over onto the bed, and took John into his arms.
He thought he ought to apologise, because surely stalking was a rude thing to do. He thought he ought to explain himself, because it was Sherlock’s character and reputation and possibly immortal soul that were at stake.
Professor Binns cleared his throat, a ghostly sound that was like the scrape of a wooden spoon rattling about in an empty bucket.
“Completely ruined Eunice Beckett’s beautiful tulips, he did. Stomped right through them. You remember the Becketts, don’t you Hazel? Oh, sure you do. That boy of theirs? Anyway, I digress. That goat was a menace. He ate people’s post and bit the milkman. Can you imagine? A goat rampaging through town! Have you ever heard of a wilder thing?”
It was a fascinating thought for the whole minute that John forgot what Madam Pomfrey had said. When he remembered, he shook his head. “Well, even if they do, I’m sure we’d get in trouble for something like that. Or...or...expelled.”
And then Sherlock’s hand tightens even further, completely compressing his arteries - his carotid and his jugular - a light pressure on his trachea, cutting off his air supply.
John comes down afterwards, shivering and trembling, lost to himself, still gasping for breath. Sherlock shakes a little too, post-coital tremors of pleasure. He places kisses upon John’s throat, soft and soothing, arms tight around his body. John arches back against him, relaxing into his embrace.
“Home, obviously,” Sherlock replied. “Mummy said she would miss me terribly when I went to school. Now she won’t have to.”
“You’d have to entice it with food or something. Most slugs eat leaves and detritus. Sometimes flowers. Fortunately for us, we are in a greenhouse,” Sherlock said, and plucked a leaf from some nearby wild daisies.
“You are a very confusing boy, John Watson,” Bill said. “You make me very emotionally conflicted. On one hand, I am very
But in the first week of their cohabitation, something happened. Sherlock, playing the first movement of Bach’s
Mummy said that the ocean was vast and wide and full of danger, but so far all that John had seen of it was some shells, a lot of sand, and a little crab that scuttled away when he attempted to scoop it up with his shovel.
He pressed their mouths together and they were both clumsy in passion - as if flush with youth all over again, as if they were running high on hormones and no experience. Their teeth knocked together for a moment, Sherlock’s hands grabbing at bare skin, John tugging at his suit. He was fully clothed and John fully naked, but when John pulled back to look at him, hissing out a ragged breath between his teeth, his mouth reddened from kisses, Sherlock felt completely laid bare.
House points...” The last few words were a struggle, and Bill courageously fought back a little sob. He then joined John in the face-in-hands movement, as he shook and whimpered to himself.
Mycroft is an Ivy Leaguer in every sense of the term, all rules and regulation and the perfectly-straight tie done up like a noose around his neck. Mycroft has always been taller than Sherlock, even after his growth spurt, and he has a way of looking down like you’re still that six year old child come crawling in from outdoors tracking mud on polished white tile and nothing Sherlock does will ever be good enough.
“The first lady who wanted to make a baby with another lady was called Liz," he continued, as if this were all very common knowledge. "I think. That
“Pose nude for me, John.” Sherlock rolled his head in John’s direction. “It’ll be good for you! Freeing.” He leered at the way John tugged at his shirt collar, as if he could wrap himself up anymore than he already was in his layers of cotton and wool. “It’s not as though I haven’t seen it all before.”
She will be placing her hand on his shoulder at first; later, right there is where she will rest her head. She will wrap her other arm around him; shelter the two of them in embrace.
was meant to happen. What happened after kissing?  Sex Ed had been woefully insufficient for...this.  He felt vastly unprepared, and incredibly uncool. Perhaps Sherlock was moving so quickly because he had certain
"Sherlock," John says, voice desperate, full of sex and as much begging as it is cruel and teasing, "Make me come."
“Don’t make me do that again,” said John, burying his face into Sherlock’s neck. He hugged back, holding on as hard as he dared. “I felt so awful. And it wasn’t right.”
The tapping sound was only the tree against the window, the banging only a loose shutter against the house. A steady
Quick look around the corner - in a manner that was not unlike playing secret agent spy - still no sign of Sherlock. Where could he be? It wasn’t like him to be late.
The Fall Ball had the school gymnasium decked out in autumnal colors, red and orange and yellow. Brown paper trees lined the walls, each of them decorated with taped-on white Christmas lights. Sarah looked girlishly beautiful; her dress was a salmon pink affair with a burst of flowers on the shoulder that she kept fussing with.  She wore a matching flower in her carefully curled hair that she did not dare touch, for fear of mussing it up. John wore a pink carnation in his rented suit to match that.
There was an awful racket coming from the room, vibrating through the glass window.  Sherlock had not one, but two, record players going at full volume, one of them propped up precariously on a tower of books. He couldn’t have been asleep; he never liked to sleep that much anyway, and who could sleep with all that noise? He had a lit cigarette in one hand. Clearly, if the self-asphyxiation didn’t work, he was planning to burn the house down with everybody in it.
“Blank walls, few items of interest, the standard crucifix on the wall -” This last item noted with a wry smile - “This is the bedroom of a boring goody-two shoes,”  Sherlock said. “Someone ordinary. You’re very neat. I bet you even have your mother fooled. But you keep your real interests hidden away - there’s a stash of horrific tales right underneath your bed, isn’t there?”
“Jiss put it under Sheridan Hope,” Sherlock drawled, trying out a Midwestern twang. “And this here’s mah colleague, Ormond Sacker.”
He opened his mouth again, but nothing came out. He probably looked like an idiot, damn it all to hell.
Sherlock watched John sit down, laughing again now, cheerful again, and he knew that he was right. He should have felt very happy and pleased with himself.
John’s hands were so steady, the way they were in times of war and danger. He looked natural with a gun in his hand. Only his insides ever shook. His outsides were so neat. His mind was a mess. Sherlock thought of the barrel of the gun pressed to John’s temple again, the way that it had threatened to make a mess of them both. He reached out and stroked his fingers over the vulnerable spot of the temple, pressed in and took John’s pulse from his temporal artery. 30 beats in fifteen seconds. 120 beats per minute.
“Pleasure to meet you,” Victor says, genuine and warm. “Sherlock and I went to school together.” He shakes her hand and does not embarrass himself by pretending to be French or calling her a radiant beauty or any of those sleazy clichés that people somehow think is charming for older women, but is actually uncomfortable and mildly insulting for all involved.
Two thoughts occur simultaneously: one, that John Watson, for all of a little idiot that he is, can have brilliant illuminations sometimes, can have the ability to see deep down to the cut to the quick, and two, that he must be shamefully, painfully obvious if he is so plainly read. Then there is no room for thoughts at all because he is pulling John towards him and kissing him on his sweet, promising mouth.
Head shyly down, enchanting embarrassment on his features, John treated Sherlock to a slow strip-tease, revealing the strong, weathered beauty of his body inch by inch as he pulled his shirt off. Soft and rounded in some places, functionally muscular in others, he wasn’t the artistic ideal of a well-sculpted man, but a life’s worth of chances taken and hardships endured were carved into his body, and they made him a masterwork. Sherlock wanted to drop the camera and gather him up in handfuls.
The children were delighted by the cows, and, later on, the chickens and sheep that they passed. Tom sang along to the radio, only slightly off-key, but with all the wrong words (
She brushes up against John as she passes him, as if she means to smear him with her Chanel no. 5. “Three States Watson,” she says, teasingly, her eyes on a fading bruise at his throat.
muttered happily under his breath. And now it seemed the ask system was another thing to add to the list. The moment John had returned from Tesco’s and unpacked groceries, he’d planted himself in his armchair and checked his blog.
“How did you get stuck?” John asked, watching Sherlock’s tail wave lazily from side to side, making smooth curves in the sand.
John closes his eyes and lets Sherlock debase the sanctity of his mouth, wet little tongue eradicating the sinful evidence of desire.
The straps that they used were affixed to the chains fastened to the legs of the bed. Sherlock tugged one of them out from the space between the mattress and the headboard and shoved John’s wrist into the soft red leather, strapped it in tight with expert ease - quickly and forcefully, as if he had to subdue him. Sometimes John struggled, to make the game more interesting. Tonight he barely even put up a fight.
“Nothing explicit or intense,” Sherlock assured him. “I just need you to see yourself. Really see yourself.” He pointedly ran his eyes over John’s form, with a smirk for the tightness that was quickly developing in John’s jeans. “You’re extraordinary, John, and you still have no idea what you look like.”
Sherlock’s words filled John with a sudden rush of feeling, like the night wind that rose to the window to greet him. His pulse quickened with excitement. He’d never dared give voice to his questions before, and to hear the words from someone else and not just in his own head made them more real, dangerous. He wanted to keep talking, Sherlock seemed like he was full of stories, maybe he’d even have answers. It would be so easy to open the window. An invitation. Down the tree branches, and then onto the street below. On that silent street Sherlock’s car would be waiting. He’d drive faster than anyone John ever knew, they’d could go faster than John had ever dreamed of, he’d
His hands on John’s back, stroking over his skin. Long, broad strokes of comfort, touches that warmed John despite the coolness of Sherlock’s hands.
to live with. Every holiday she’d come home with stories of school and of all the spells she’d learned, all the tricks and magic and new inventive ways with which she could torture her little brother. Even without her wand she could still wreak mischief; once she had turned John’s hair the colour and texture of candyfloss for two weeks. (It hadn’t tasted like candyfloss, both a tragedy and a godsend; it would be hard to explain to Mum that he’d eaten himself bald, even if it was Harry’s fault.)
Jeanette guided his hand to the soft, supple curve of her breast and took his other hand and led him up her skirt. The forbidden territory, that unknown land.  Her tongue pushed into his mouth and he could feel the slick wet woman-ness of her in that sacred place between her legs,  and she pulled away to whisper “Yes, just like that, baby,” and he thought of Sherlock’s voice in his ear whispering just that, “
They lie in the field together, the air rising with the sound of crickets and their own panting breath. Looking up at the stars, Sherlock says it’s beautiful.
He peeked over John’s shoulder again. “Hmmm.” As he’d thought: the default theme. John hadn’t even changed the colours. He was scrolling through files on his computer, clearly looking for an icon photo. Oh, anything but that horrible, vacuously smiling blog photo.
“What?” Greg said, confused. Apparently he had not heard of Liz-Beans either, and John felt better that he knew something that a fifth-year Prefect didn’t. “No, no. What I mean is, you have an excellent build for a Seeker. Ever play Quidditch?”
John's eyes are so dark and so wide they could swallow up a person's whole being. The type of gaze that absorbs a person. He looks dazed, barely able to focus, breathy little sounds of pain/pleasure spilling out from his parted mouth. How to love that look. A million ways to love that look.
his finger pushed inside, gliding easily on lube. John keened with the feel of it; no relief, just a tease. Just one finger and it wasn’t nearly enough.
“Sweet dreams, John,” Bill whispered, after the lights went out in the Gryffindor dormitories. “But I
John lands on his bottom with a thud, calls Sherlock a jerk, rolls them over in the same breath; Sherlock is laughing, not caring about the dirt on his precious jacket, rubbing onto the seat of his jeans. His hands are on John, palms open and fingers squeezing, rubbing hot on his shoulders, his spine, the small of his back, burning through the thin fabric of John’s plaid shirt.
“You know,” Victor says, when John’s regained his breath, “He looked surprisingly good ginger. But the blond wasn’t bad either.”
“Oh man, this is a great way to get out of service, Johnny boy, if only you could have done it before that ghastly sermon!” Harry said.
“You are going to die tonight,” he told Kamanev - not meant to be threatening, simply stating a fact. Judging from the point of entry, the little piece of lead had tunnelled through his liver and perforated his stomach; the former being the more serious injury. The liver being a highly vascularised solid organ, it was likely to bleed out, Kamanev first going into hypovolemic shock, and then traumatic arrest. Chances for survival were slim, although not entirely nonexistent, supposing that he managed to get himself to an operating room in time.
“Something bad? Like what?” Sherlock’s tone was curious, but there was a silkiness to it, as if he were touched by John’s concern.
"No brothers, no sisters, no other humans," Sherlock sing-songed, "no one else, just you, only you."
The first time Sherlock kisses him, it’s up against the lockers in warm, hazy afternoon and John watches it happen in slow motion, the way they say that your life slows before your eyes right when you’re about to die.
“If you’re going to delete photos, you could start by taking your finger off the shutter.” Sherlock slipped his hands behind his head, looking heartlessly amused with John’s frustrated attempts to work the piece of technology.
John and Sarah dated for seven months, a small eternity in high school time. Everybody considered her jacketed even if John never actually gave her his jacket, even after he made Varsity. He planned on giving her his class ring, though, because that was the thing to do when you’d been together for an eternity. He took her out to dinner at a nice restaurant in town - Angelo’s - and sat her down across from the table where he and Sherlock often sat.  She was a decent girl, so patient with him, so kind. All understanding like; she never asked for too much or demanded answers John couldn’t give.  So he looked into her eyes over candlelight and took her hand in one of his, reached into his pocket with the other, said, “Sarah, I have something for you…”
"I’m not…We weren’t…" John stumbles over the words. "We weren’t a couple. No. I’m not…it wasn’t like that. No."
John’s voice wove comfortably around him in the dark, every now and again pitched with excitement, hushed when he talked about something he found frightening or delightfully
John and Carl shook hands, reluctant but obliging, although it wasn’t so much a shaking as it was part arm-wrestling and part attempting to squeeze one another’s fingers off.
John looks at him, pinned by his gaze as much as he’d been pinned by Sherlock’s body against the lockers. His own breath is hot in his chest, still trying to catch up. Wants to press his fingers to his mouth to see if he can still feel the kiss there, body tingling all over in all the places they’d touched, pressed together.
“That’s nice of you,” he decided. Even if the Slytherin Head Boy was intimidating, overbearing, and frankly quite frightening, perhaps it was nice to see that the older students in this school took an interest in the younger ones.
, Sherlock corrected himself - and he smiled a lot, at everybody and everything and at nothing and people like that made friends very easily, because people were idiots.  People like that generally did not like to be friends with Sherlock, because they were scared that he would Curse them or something.
“He needed me, and I left. He had a problem and I was 21 and helpless and tired and terrified, so I up and abandoned him when he needed me most.”
He pulled his hand away so that he could use both hands to release the latches, and then he was pushing up the screen. The black night seemed to roll in, cool breeze over his bared skin, his heated face, and now there was no more barrier between them.
“Don’t be silly,” said John. “We’re partners. That means we help each other and we do everything together. We’re a team. Isn’t that right?”
John is woken up by the cold in the motel room. He’s shivering, naked, wrapped in only a sheet.  The bed is empty.
“You’re such a slut for me,” Sherlock said, rolling his hips as John arched, whimpered and clenched around his dick. “Only me, only me.”
“A friend?!” Sherlock asked, unable to hide his shock. He hadn’t had someone call themselves his friend since he was eight years old, and that relationship had been tragically short-lived. An experimental oversight, on his part.
Relationships, Sherlock thought, as he reached for the zip on John’s jeans - contrary to long-held beliefs - were actually rather nice.
Her parents were both practical people who did not believe in uncertain things like nighttime nightmare creatures or psychiatry. This year they were trying their hand at gardening vegetables - and roses, her father always chimed in.
“What’s this?” Jeanette asked. She had pulled the collar of his shirt open for her next kiss, only to find a fading bruise on his shoulder.
Nothing had slithered up her garden path. Nothing was scaling up the walls of her house. Nothing pressed a small white face against the window, peering in at her children while they slept, nothing was staring at them with its large, lambent eyes, glowing and hollow…
Of course there were always exceptions. It was the first solved case since Sherlock’s return, and Lestrade had invited them out to the pub afterwards with the rest of the Yarders to celebrate. Sherlock could not imagine anything more interminably dull, but he took one look at John’s face, flushed and happy and alive, and the next thing he knew he was sitting on a stool, hand clenched tightly around a glass full of scotch.  John was laughing at something Lestrade had said, the sight of him brilliant in the dim, dirty crowd.
“So do you want to know the creepiest part?” Bill said, lowering his voice to a hush. Of course John and Mike nodded, intrigued. “Sherlock
But it felt good; deliriously good. The scrape of his teeth, followed by the wet, soothing touch of his tongue on the smooth sensitive skin of John’s inner thigh.
“Yeah,” John says, scrambling up to his feet. He is suddenly very sober. “I’m just going to...ah...go back to my bed and, um, sleep.”
“Wait, no…” John starts, “I think it’s my buy to turn. I mean.” He squints at his empty glass. There was something not right about the last sentence but he’s not quite sure what, and his glass is not giving him any answers at all.
“You’ve...you’ve been imagining my bedroom?” John stammered, again. Twice now he'd been caught off guard by Sherlock's words, couldn't even imagine his intent. John's cheeks flushed, heat creeping up his body despite the chill.
The good Reverend continued: “The Lord gave us the Ten Commandments so that we would know how to best live our lives. Young ones, listen to me: Honor thy father and mother.  Rules exist for a reason. Rules keep us safe. Curfew keeps us safe.
“Would you let James Dean get to second base with you?” Sherlock snipes. He means it a lot more scathingly and a little less catty than it actually sounds.
; rub out the old scars and start all over again. John has to be quiet, remember; maybe not so much with his mother home and sodden down with drink, but when Harry’s home they turn up the record player loud  so that rock and roll drowns out the sounds of whimpers and moans, and John’s mouth is covered with Sherlock’s hand, his palm, sometimes sucking wetly on the fingers pushed inside - for comfort. Or he muffles himself with his own hand, the sheet, a balled up tie once, satin pushed against the back of his teeth, soaking up saliva on his tongue. The sound of a moan is a precious thing. When it flutters out of John’s mouth from the way Sherlock rubs inside his body, Sherlock wants to take that sound and pin it like a specimen. What a luxury it is to waste it, then, force it out with thrusts of his hips and to hear it mangled by the wet sounds made from fingers rubbing against a dripping tongue.
His legs pumping. He had to keep running. He had to. He was dodging amongst the trees. But not once did it occur to him to hide. There was no time. There was no place to hide. He would surely be found out.
There was a sudden loud splashing sound coming from inside the cave where it got all dark, echoing off the walls.
But when Madam Pomfrey poured the healing potion directly into his wound, it was John’s turn to do an impression of a tea kettle, except the sound that he made was more towards the high-pitched whining end of the spectrum.
“You could borrow it after I’m done,” Sherlock said generously. And then, with a hint of pride, he told John, “It is
"Just...don’t wander off on your own again. And stay away from the water, all right? It’s dangerous!” Harry chided him, giving his hand a little shake.
Immediately then, he moves his hands down to the waistband of John’s trousers, fingers hooked. John’s hands come to rest on top of his for a moment. “You’re taking these off," Sherlock says, fact, not a question; order, not a request. John's breathing quickens, and he only gives Sherlock's hand a squeeze. John’s chest is gently marked with various bruises in the shape of Sherlock's mouth, his nipples erect with the night air and his arousal, his erection flushed and needy, particularly exposed against his best suit trousers.
He wants to be the one to pull all of John’s sounds out of him, to tease them out with twists of his fingers on John’s nipples and his cock rubbing against John, rubbing inside him. He wants to be, and he will be, and he is, the first to hear the different types of sounds that John Watson can make.
John nods, relieved. He hadn’t wanted to come back here, but now that he’s back, the thought of leaving seems just as abominable.
He told himself he was very pleased with being right, as he thought up new and innovative ways for people to die.
He dropped her off at home afterwards, walked her up to the front door. They stood on her doorstep, the porchlight left on for her although the house was dark and quiet.
. John couldn’t even comprehend what it would take to make up that vast amount. Slytherin would probably win the House Cup this year! It was a thought that admittedly would have been a lot more devastating if not for the fact that at least it was Sherlock’s House, and then he wondered if he really was a House traitor for thinking like that.
“Okay,” said John, with a nice, warm feeling in his chest. He’d ask for them in his first letter home. He’d write it tonight.
John, ever full of surprises, reaches out and rubs his fingers over the head of his dick. It causes Sherlock to curse softly and precum to spurt over John's fingertips, dirtying the cleanliness of his sweet hand with clear slick. John pushes himself up a little , and Sherlock shows him, how to wrap his hand around him, how to rub and stroke just the way he likes. John's small hand in his, their fingers intertwined, both of them working to bring him off.
“May I?” Sherlock said, while John stared at him around his thumb, hovering somewhere around baffled and sidling toward furious.
” that weird pull when Sherlock said his name, the way his world narrowed to just Sherlock’s arms and his touches, and darkness all around them - “I want to be with you. I want to be so close to you. You smell so good. You feel so good. I’ll make you feel so good.”
Sherlock spent the next couple of days on cloud nine. When Lestrade called him to a crime scene, he was so persistently unantagonistic to Donovan and so agreeable to Lestrade’s requests for explanations that Lestrade followed him the entire time he was on site, under the assumption that he
"Why would I want to be a bat-man? I don't want to eat insects," Sherlock said, making a little face of distaste. That had been determined by an ill-advised experiment four years ago. Moths were dusty and awful. Mosquitoes didn’t taste all that much like blood. And ‘butterfly” was
He catapulted himself to his feet and strode over to sit on the coffee table, only a foot or two from John. With a glance up through his eyelashes, he ran fingertips up the inner seam of John’s jeans. “It’s worked out for you so far, hasn’t it?”
Mr. Benson, who was on John's paper route, managed the local theater and slipped him an extra dime, sometimes, in exchange for errands and small favors: sweeping up the theater lobby, or sorting new popcorn bags, or wiping down the framed glass of the pictures that were
Sherlock moans, unabashed in his pleasure, hips pushing up into the warmth and grip of his own hand. He feels John's gaze like a caress over the arch of his own throat, the smooth, flat planes of his chest, the tightening of his abdominal muscles as he rolls his hips and thrusts up, rocking them both. The sight of John beneath him as he's rocked, the flush still in his cheeks and the panting rush of breath still in his chest, the mouth-shaped bruises forming on the skin of his chest and his nipples still swollen and rigid from Sherlock's manipulations.
“All the more reason to go to a malt shop,” Sherlock replied. He was putting on the tilt sign and absolutely shameless about it.
He opened his eyes and saw John looking at him, the knowledge of what could have happened reflected back at him in dark blue eyes. The whirr of it was loud in their brains, the threat of it racing in their pulses.
“I shall transfer, then! This is a terrible school, Mycroft. They don’t even offer a course in Piracy. Durmstrang offers a course in Piracy, don’t they? That’s where the Viking wizards came from.”
In short, Sherlock Holmes had been too distracted by all the pretty, shiny things floating around that he had somehow missed the very obvious truth about the whole place. For shame.
Sherlock shuddered and pressed his growing erection against John’s thigh. John made another small sound and rubbed himself against the evidence of desire, inciting a harsh growl and Sherlock’s hand scratching possessively down his back.
"I told you already, you're not going to be expelled," Sherlock said to John, rolling his eyes. "So stop that."
“Ah,” says John, a rugby man himself, “Now all that’s left is the corset and you’re well on your way.”
John smiled. Hazel took his hand to lead him into the kitchen, deeper into the safety of the house, away from the windows with their view of the angry sea.
Father Pike stood at the pulpit, arms wide as if to embrace his parishioners. His voice resonated through the church, filling the cavernous space.
The pressure on his throat then isn’t pain, isn’t anything anymore really, the world fading mutely from around him. His vision goes blurry and then small spots of colour appear, vibrant inky splotches of black. He’s literally breathless, lips parted and attempting to gasp, no air in, no air out. His lungs burn with the need for air, the desperation to inhale, exhale, and his heart pounds a quickening, thundering beat in his chest, racing with his spiking adrenaline.
Sherlock’s eyes seemed hooded, dark as the woods that surrounded them. But in his eyes, there was the paleness of the winter sky. John looked down to his mouth, strangely full lips, pink - and once again felt that warm heat pooling low in his belly, warmer now for the feeling of Sherlock on top of him, for his larger hands gently encircling John’s wrists, holding them down with just enough pressure to let John know he wasn’t going anywhere.
“All right,” John said. He looked out to the sea. He watched the waves rise and fall, the ocean pushing steadily towards the shore, encroaching upon the land.
“Hey! Only part of that phrase is true,” Victor says. He pauses meaningfully. “We were over 18, so legally we weren’t juvenile anymore.”
Victor tugs restlessly at the duvet. “I tried to get him to give it up. You can imagine how well that went, getting Sherlock Holmes to do something he doesn’t want to.
“Nah,” said John, and averted his eyes. He reached for Jeanette’s hand and gave it a squeeze, hoping she would take credit for the brightness in his cheeks.
Three fingers next, the stretch of it obvious, the tightening of skin around his knuckles and John’s body tight around them. Sherlock knew just where to rub, his fingers naturally long and his knowledge carefully expert by now - how easily he stimulated John, pushed against his prostate and made the moans spill out from his throat, easy and needy. He licked the skin of the sensitive rim, pulled taut around fingers, wriggled and twisted his fingers ‘round and ‘round, listened to the almost-sob that choked John when he rubbed that spot inside of him particularly hard.
John adamantly shakes his head. "No, no, you misunderstand the lingo," he says. "Bad means good, remember?"
It wasn’t scary the way that monsters were scary, it was more…that word, intimi-dating. Like people could be, and as Mum had said, you musn’t be intimidated. It always made John think of some sort of bizarre ritual of dating, which made perfect sense to him, since all dating was weird and foreign.
The Head Boy looked down his nose at him. “If you do intend to remain friends with Sherlock Holmes, I’d be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way.”
Oh God. She ran down towards the beach, screaming John’s name. The wind whipped her hair into a sandy cloud around her face, her robe and nightgown flapping against her legs. “John!” she cried. The wind carried his name away.
In the school gymnasium, they have dimmed the lights and strewn up pink and purple streamers of cheap crepe paper. They are playing saccharine Top 40 tunes.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows, and lifted one hand away to start unbuttoning his shirt. Yeah, all right, hesitation could sod off. John reached greedily for that creamy white skin and let Sherlock do whatever the hell he had in mind.
feeling that seemed to buzz underneath John’s skin, the voice in his head that told him to drop everything and
Never kissed in a bed before and they revel in the luxury of it, soft surface beneath them and Sherlock lets John strip him of his shirt the way he can tell he’s always wanted to, slow and careful. Not like Sherlock, who wants to rip and tear, who’s delicate with his violin and his experiments but not the things he really, truly owns. John doesn’t know. John runs his hands over Sherlock’s shoulders and over his chest like the whole of him is a marvel. With his touch he strips Sherlock of other things, slow and careful, and John doesn’t know.
“Oh.” The corners of Sherlock’s lips twitched. Manipulation, then. The dirty sod was enjoying himself. He was probably gauging how much he had to pout before John would start singing his praises. “I can think of many ways.”
“He called me an idiot,” Victor says. “For about half an hour. 45 minutes. I’m not sure. I zoned out somewhere after the insulting inferences to inbreeding on my father’s side.”
A loud, urgent banging came from outside the bathroom door. “Hazel, what’s wrong? Open the door! I heard you screaming. Is everything all right?”
been mindful to choose a pair of casual slacks, however, now that he knew that was a point of judgment.
“Oh gosh, I just don’t know,” John said, all big baby blues and innocence. “Somebody must be setting a bad example.” He slid his hand down between them and cupped Sherlock through his jeans.
“The best time of my life,” John replies, and is surprised at how easily the answer comes to him, and how true it is.
Sherlock’s lips were cool, again, from the autumn night. The kiss was as gentle as before, but it was more real, dangerous, now that he could feel the strength of Sherlock’s arms around him, feel the cool leather of his jacket, smell it, feel Sherlock’s chest hard and solid against his. John’s belly swooped with the sensation of falling and this time there was no way out.
She’d gotten more incensed, more animated as she spoke, words coming quicker and faster. Finally, in one sharp, angry motion, she lifted up her thick hair to reveal a thin white scar along her ear that ran down the edge of it, all the way to the lobe.
Next he has a small glass jar of Vaseline in his hands; he's always kept one in his glove compartment and he'd slipped it into his jacket pocket earlier, his intentions clear, unclean.  It had been inevitable from the moment that John had left the dance with him. It had been inevitable from the moment John had kissed him and asked for it again. It had been inevitable from the moment he'd first laid eyes upon John Watson on the first day of school. Sherlock had taken a long drag of his cigarette as he watched John walked by, smacked Vic on the arm, and said, right then and there, “Dibs.”
” his mouth was forming the words, or at least attempting to form the words, the shape of his name, like some kind of prayer or begging, it was impossible to tell which, praying or begging or pleading or maybe just crying. Sounds stuttering.   “
When the three boys drifted off to sleep that night, none of them had bad dreams, and they did not worry about a thing.
a female voice whispered loudly - as loudly as possible, really, for it to still be a whisper. It was loud enough for John to look around fearfully; they were all very mindful of the wrath of Madam Pince. Legend had it that Madame Pince had once had a mouse thrown out of the library for sneezing too disruptively.
It was not that John had a good ear for music - he completely missed the out-of-tune note that slipped out in Sherlock’s surprise, which he had been forced to disguise with amateurish vibrato. John could not tell when the pitch was perfect, he could not appreciate a beautifully executed bariolage. But his expression in that moment was something Sherlock had never seen on another person’s face before.
“Must be nice to be rich,” John says. The milky liquid ripples. Slight rattle of the spoon on the plate. John holds his left hand still with his right and sets the cup of tea down.
"Should have been paying attention to where you were walking instead of harassing me," said an upside-down John, standing over him. “Nothing’s broken. Stop being so dramatic.”
John didn’t resist when Sherlock pushed up to roll them over, arms wrapping around John in a possessive embrace. The weight of Sherlock’s body upon him, pressing him into the carpet, the heat and bulge of his hardening cock rubbing sweet friction against John’s own. A moan escaped John, slipping out from deep within, a sort of release of the hot desire that was quickly building up inside of him. Sherlock muffled the sound with his tongue, long fingers slipping up to tug at the short strands of John’s hair. His whole body rolled with one sinuous, smooth motion, rocking the two of them together. John clutched at his shoulders and drew his knees up to make room for Sherlock between his legs, wanting the heat and weight and scent of him to stay right where it was.
“Was it the kind of dating where everybody thinks you’re on a date but you’re not actually, or was it the kind of dating where you intentionally go on dates?”
“If it’s going to have a name, then it should be a halfway decent name at least. Like, say...Rachmaninoff.”
Kissing Sherlock for a picture, though? He wrinkled up his nose. That was so… He was still adjusting to kissing Sherlock without pictures.
sort of help, ta.” John poked at buttons and fumbled through the resulting menus, feeling a bit like a rat in a maze.
John’s Sherlock faced down a madman with a gun in his hand, ruthless for a moment before he was caught off-guard by sentiment.
“Just give it time,” Bill said. “Eventually, one day, in the far-away future, everybody will forget all about the-” his voice caught in his throat - “
naked.) The sleepovers that were more than that, two of them entwined on a tiny twin bed; what a flatshare actually meant. Victor and Sherlock, laughing together. Hugging each other. Touching. Kissing. Fucking.
bedroom - John was standing there, half-undressed, shoes kicked off and his hands working at his own belt.
Sherlock nodded. He knew what it felt like, sometimes, to be the only one in the world of something.
A tree grew along the west side of the house, wrapping it up in a leafy embrace. The wind was knocking the branches against the windowpane. That was the source of the sound. It had to be, Hazel told herself, and she tried not to think about small, wet fingers with skin so pale it was like the water had leeched all the colour out.
“God! If you’re going to do that-” He reached down to yank at his own pants, but Sherlock was in the way, between his legs.
He found a seat by himself in a bench near the front, because he wanted to be up close for the lesson. Immediately he opened up
Spreading ginger and scallions over soy sauce chicken and rice, Victor says, “We used to raid Professor Blackington’s office for his alcohol stash. He had his suspicions but he could never garner enough evidence to prove it was either of us. We were always each other’s alibi. In fact, Sherlock was the one who taught me how to pick a lock.”
California. All the way across the country. Away from home, away from his mother and his sister, away from Sherlock. 2,700 miles between here and there.
“Jaaaawwwwnnnn, come aaaaawwwwnnnnn,”  whined another boy, dark-skinned with black hair and currently pawing at the table. (Comes from old Wizarding family, but not affluent, middle child, Cannons fan.) “You’re supposed to be my partner. I even gave you my pumpkin pasty as insurance!”
There was only one person, really, who often found himself in the unenviable position of being Sherlock’s part-time nemesis. “Did he offer you money to spy on me?” Sherlock asked.
The radiator was hissing while Father Pike spoke, soft and serpentine at first, and then louder and louder, like a kettle whistling as water came to a boil. There was something moving down Jesus’ foot. A crawling black fly, perhaps. John couldn’t help but look at it. No, it was a trickle. A trickle of something...something red? It looked like…
“You can live out your whole life and die here, in a little town like this - or in a suburb that’s identical to this one.”
“John?” Sherlock smoothed down a patch of blond hair sticking out at angles from when John had run his fingers through his hair, muttering something about an octopussy. For a man modest and conservative in public displays of his sexuality, he had an odd fascination with octopus genitalia.
Every time he was on screen, there was a thumping in John’s heart he had never been aware of before. His skin was prickling all over while he sat there in the dark. When Jim Stark raced Buzz Gunderson to the edge of Millerton Bluff in a chickie run, John’s stomach flipped as if he were the one about to go over the cliff instead.
John made a small noise in the back of his throat and shifted his hips, the tip of his tongue already peeking out. Sherlock held himself in his hand and rubbed the head of his dick against the softness of John’s cheek. John closed his eyes, as if in bliss or supplication. A drop of clear precum beaded at the tip of Sherlock’s dick at the sight. He rubbed his dick over both of John’s cheeks, over the lushness of his mouth, painting sticky trails over John’s face with the clear wetness of his arousal, desecrating the goodness of him. He thought about John’s face dripping with his semen, bodily essence of desire; thought about how beautiful it was, the sight of John’s mouth anointed with his come. Consecration, in a way.
“Whatever it is, I want nothing to do with it,” Bill said, ducking behind John as Sherlock approached.
On Monday, Sherlock ate alone at the Slytherin table. There were other students at the Slytherin table, of course, but they all seemed absorbed in talking to each other. Sherlock sat surrounded by people, and no one talked to him or even seemed to see him.
Apparently Jeanette was in and out of detention at least once a month. If a permanent record did exist, no school was ever going to accept her.
John was not a particularly cultured man. Musically speaking, he was completely ignorant. He couldn’t tell Tchaikovsky from Chopin or Beethoven from Brahms, and Sherlock sometimes caught him singing along to Top 40 on the radio. The one time John had gone to see the London Symphony Orchestra he had fallen asleep, a sin so grievous that Sherlock had been treated to a delightful 50 minutes of Jeanette’s righteous fury, as she bore down upon a helplessly trapped John in the entryway of 221B.
“Don’t need to pout,” John says, voice warm even as he stubs out the cigarette against a ceramic pencil holder; he does it carefully, the way he does everything.
John’s mouth goes tight, but instead he says, “No shoes on the bed,” sternly, and pushes Sherlock’s feet off. “And no smoking in my bedroom.”
“Oh, god.” John’s nose wrinkled up at the sight of the photo. “What’re you doing with that? You said the angle was wrong to see anything useful.”
“Hey,” said Sherlock, amused. He peered past John, looking at his carefully rearranged room: the straightened bookcase, the slightly-disturbed records laid out next to the record player showing off his taste in music, the neatly-made bed. John felt himself exposed, his room so methodically examined - as if Sherlock were picking him apart piece by piece. Sherlock’s eyes lingered upon the empty space where the crucifix used to hang, and his smile grew.
He snapped the laptop closed and just barely missed sandwiching John’s fingers in the process. It was the fastest John’s hands had ever moved over the keyboard.
Sherlock stood over the man with the certainty that his chances for survival would be reduced to none.
He continues, “He was so good at impressions. To this day my sister still calls me after she talks to our father to make sure she was really having a conversation with Dad and not Sherlock pretending to be Dad. And then I have to answer three test questions before she can be sure she’s speaking to me.”
And then, suddenly - a little blond head popped through the crest of a wave, breaking through seafoam.
“But I can’t fuck you over the workbench, John,” Sherlock said, and lapped at John’s nipple with just the tip of his tongue. “You said you wanted the hood of my car.” He was tickling his fingertips over the head of John’s erection again, feather-light pressure through his trousers.
There were so many things to worry about. Would the other kids like him? Would he make any friends? What if he was rubbish at magic? And oh god, where was he going to be Sorted? If he got Slytherin mum would kill him! Or at least, Harry would. And she’d said if he was a Hufflepuff (as she was sure he was, because he was so clumsy and daft) he was stuck doing her chores for eternity, because Hufflepuffs were industrious and loved working hard. Either way it was terrible, and once it happened it couldn’t be undone; mum had been a Gryffindor as well, and they’d been so proud of Harry, he’d hate to disappoint them…
He didn’t have on any House colours, so he was a first-year, then. He was slight, scrawny, even, with a wild mop of dark curls atop his head. He sat oddly, with his knees drawn up to his chest on the seat, and his fingers steepled together underneath his chin, as if in prayer. He was bundled up in a long dark blue scarf - maybe he wanted to be in Ravenclaw? He appeared to be asleep. A large owl in a cage dozed next to him. It
John yelped as he was knocked down to the ground; he struggled and kicked, but to no effect. In less than a second he was pinned, with Sherlock sitting on his hips.
“You’re not much good at Potions either,” said Sherlock, who was clearly on a streak at pointing out all of John’s deficiencies.
John woke gasping, in tremors, shuddering with pleasure. It rolled through him in little waves, one after another, his stomach clenching, and he whimpered with his own release.
While he fumbled and searched for it, checking first one pocket and then the other, standing up in the middle of the restaurant and then getting onto his knees, looking underneath his chair, and then the table, Sarah said, “John, John, wait, get up...we need to talk.”
“Don’t say I never warned you,” she said darkly. She turned on her heel and left, leaving all John alone in the stacks. Her footsteps were loud in the forced quiet, until they, too, faded away.
Sherlock chose his position behind John, John leaned his head back and settled in with a pleased sigh. Sherlock wrapped him in his arms, one hand working into his pants to knead at his cock while the other stroked up John’s stomach to catch his nipple. The little nub hardened quickly under the coy brush of a thumb, as if John’s body was asking for more of Sherlock’s touch. Sherlock pressed his nose into John’s neck, pleased.
“Sherlock didn’t do anything,” said John defensively. “Carl was picking on him, and that’s not right.”
But now, as he found himself reading over the page for Venomous Tentacula for the third time, he suspected that perhaps his concentration was elsewhere - despite the beautifully horrifying story on that page concerning a wizard and his unorthodox usage for Tentacula, and the resulting damage to his body parts.
He worked John’s body, rolling and pinching, squeezing and stroking, till he had John squirming in his lap, caught pleasantly between the hand at his nipple and the one in his pants. A lapful of John was a very nice thing to have, Sherlock reflected as that sweet arse rubbed thoughtlessly against his erection. It was impossible to resist grinding up against it, rutting against that lovely firm curve while John wriggled for him, sinking deeper and deeper into the flood of pleasure Sherlock gave him. .
“It’s no use heading back to our places for the night,” Victor says, quite reasonably. “Rather silly when there’s a perfectly good bed and sofa here.”
The padded muscle of his belly tightened and flexed when he stretched, and Sherlock had had enough of this all-looking-but-no-touching business. He tossed the camera on the bed and followed after, the two of them rolling together over the sheets while John laughed at Sherlock’s eagerness.
He looks at John abruptly, hissing with desire. John licks his lips, tongue pink and gesture obscene on sweet, innocent face. "You said I could," he says, "with you inside me."
white teeth. Something about his expression made John want to cover his eyes, but he didn’t, because Sherlock was already tugging his wrist away, saying, “John, look at me, I want to see your face,” and he had his cock in his hand and then he was re-entering, no pretense, no warning, shoving inside, making John shout, eyes flying open with the shock. Crying out with panting breath.
“So he still does these funny experiments,” Victor says, poking at an old agar plate streaked with neon.
“Oh, by Merlin’s eyebrows, child, do watch where you’re going,” said Nearly-Headless Nick as he floated by behind them.
“That's strange,” Harry murmured. “There’s no cut or anything.” John looked down at his wrist, and saw only smooth flesh, lightly tanned from playing in the sun. “You must have just scraped it against something. I don't know how you managed that. That was a lot of blood.”
John whimpered as he felt Sherlock’s fingers pull back, and then thrust in again, sending an electric shock of stimulation through his whole body. Fluid spurted from his dick in response, hard and completely untouched.
The air was crisp that bright Thursday morning, and the birds were singing from the telephone wires, and John was muttering to himself like someone gone mad.
“Some,” Sherlock amended. He wanted to hear all the different cadences in John’s voice when he tried to be witty while he was being pleasured.
John isn’t attracted to men, but there are certain men who sometimes make you wonder, a little. Make your eyes wander, a little. And if he can admit that, maybe now he can say that, Sherlock was very unconventionally attractive. And Sherlock was the kind of man who took up all your attention and left no room for anything else.
But the first night they stopped at a motel John felt like something between a newlywed and a man on death row. They’d never been alone before, no listening for the sound of the key in the lock, no turning up the music so that no one downstairs would hear. No tensing at the sound of a car pulling into the driveway, parents coming home.
Sherlock found his hips thrusting, himself moaning, panting with excitement. He let out a low, soft grunt, surprised - John was dangerously good at sucking. If he wasn’t careful he’d come down his throat in no time at all, and with a deep shudder and a low moan, he pushed John off.
“Yeah!” Bill said, stepping forward, hands held out placatingly. “I mean, it’s cause I like you, and you’re my friend, and you’re so much better than…than
John Watson, who’d been sitting in the row directly behind them, looked up from pretending to read his history book. “Why am I being dragged into this?”
Hazel got up out of bed, feet in her slippers and her robe clutched tightly around herself. The rain drummed down upon the windows. It was impossible to see the ocean now but she knew that it was close. She could feel the ebb and tug of it in her stomach.
Sherlock felt this was all a bit unfair. So many unknown people and a website were hoarding John’s attention while his flatmate and
“You have to ask her. Everybody knows you’re an item now. It’s your social obligation. I can’t believe you haven’t asked her yet.”
Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath. A cold, heavy weight settled into his stomach, the same sharp realisation he’d had when he had seen John’s expression the moment he had Sorted Slytherin. He’d known that look of instinctive fear, the flare of alarm in the unevolved sectors of primitive brains; reactions ranging from fear to repulsion to disgust. The unspoken
"That makes terrible sense," he said, awed and a little terrified, but mostly impressed, all at once.
“You can’t have him!” she screamed out into the night. The wind stung her eyes with its harshness. “You can’t! You can’t!”
What matters is the sweet sight of her in her pink or powder blue or lilac dress, the soft curves of her body as she presses it against John. Her breath will be fragrant against his skin. Her hands are small, and soft, and clean.  She will wear a ring on her right hand and yearn for one on her left. She excels at Home Ec. The kind of girl who knows what that word
It is to John’s credit that he waits a whole five minutes before he says, “Toto, I’ve a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore.”
A documentary on cliff divers is running on BBC One, something that is far more amusing than it ought to be after half a bottle of scotch - Victor’s choice - shared between them. John finds himself comfortably leaned over, shoulder against Victor’s arm. Sometime during one of the commercial breaks, he looks up in the middle of an offhand comment about Pepsi versus Coke to find Victor watching him, eyes dark with an intent that tugs at something deep in his stomach. Unthinkingly, John licks his lips.
And the prickling fear that crawled up the back of his neck, the sensation of being watched? That had to be his imagination.
“You’d let me do anything to you,” Sherlock murmurs, words only barely comprehensible in the humming sensation that fills John’s brain, the pleasure that sweeps through his body.
He takes the lowball glass of Remy Martin and pours it out, fine cognac splashing onto an already-sticky pub floor.
, over and over, the sound of a small body thumping against the door. Sometimes it happened in short bursts, 15 or 20 or 30 minutes, maybe an hour. Afterwards she assumed that John went back to bed, properly - and sometimes he wouldn’t make it there - she would find him curled up in a heap on the floor when she went to check on him.
“Okay, no more looking,” John said quickly, pushing Sherlock away. He eyed him funnily. “Don’t you have one?” He looked down at Sherlock’s tail. Maybe he didn’t.
Those August nights were like dark velvet on the skin; summer smell of sweet grass in the air.  It was late enough that the heat was just starting to lift, night breeze blowing like God’s green breath cooling off the earth.
“I know!” Victor laughs. “For a whole week that dickhead had me believing he was an American student from L.A., right up until I heard him talk to the professor after our Biology class.”
- but then there was talk of guns, and trapping people in cars, of leaving the stove on to suffocate people in their sleep and people putting their heads in ovens and causing explosions. Sherlock, in turn, told him a particularly fantastic story about how a man had been found dead in his cottage ripped open, and everybody thought it had been his wife, only it had turned out to be his goat, and then the goat turned out to be his wife, and his wife had turned out to actually be a goat. In turn, John shared his theory about how if he had to dispose of a body, he would chop it up and put it in a blender and make a human slurry - and then he’d spent another fifteen minutes explaining blenders to an especially inquisitive Sherlock.
Something was playing there. Somehow, John didn’t quite want to watch it, he felt the urge to cover his eyes, and, as he might when he was younger, peep only from the safety of between his fingers.
heat that flooded his blood and made his blood flood his face - it all made sense, then, with Sherlock’s chest against his and the curl of Sherlock’s fingers on his shoulders, burning,
John rose from bed automatically. The movements were easy, thoughtless - push back the covers, swing his feet onto the ground, the same way he got out of bed for school each morning. By the time it occurred to him that he shouldn’t, he was already at the window.
John followed him, his little pail in hand, rattling gently with the shovel and the shells and stones he’d collected earlier that day. Sherlock stopped near the entrance of the cave, where the sunlight still spilled in, and laid back on the warm sand and shallow water, sunning himself.
“Well...” said Bill. “He could have both. Head injury and then evil spell on top of it. Wait, do head injuries mess with evil spells?”
It’s all wrong. He’s not as tall as Sherlock, only almost. His ink-black hair is silky and straight.
H was before W, of course, so John would have to wait. “Sherlock Holmes!” they called out, and if Sherlock felt anything - nervousness, excitement - he didn’t show it. John held his breath as Sherlock walked up and took a seat on the stool, glancing up at the hat with interest. Meanwhile, John’s heart was doing its best imitation of a little toy drum, the kind with a monkey doll attached to it, banging away.
It started with a group of Ravenclaw girls who giggled and pointed as John walked by on his way to his first class. They immediately shushed when he turned around to look at them suspiciously, and then resumed once he’d turned his back to them again. This continued with a group of Hufflepuff students he’d passed next, and then there was snickering from a bunch of Slytherins, and he was sure that some of his fellow Housemates would have laughed at him too, if it weren’t for the fact that the majority of his House was currently giving him the silent treatment.
A bat-man thing was the solution. John got all excited when he talked about that; it was an easy distraction.
Sherlock stalked down the hall with long, purposeful strides, his black robes billowing out behind him. He looked like thunderclouds could form beneath his feet. He looked like the sky should darken behind him, and perhaps dramatically flash with lightning every other step. A Hufflepuff first year scrambled to get out of Sherlock’s way and nearly entangled himself with an unhappy suit of armour in the process.
“It’s all right, John,” Mike said, and patted his shoulder to comfort him. “Manly women are to be admired.”
Through the stalks of corn, this far from the road, they are completely hidden from view. With only the eyes of God upon them, Sherlock presses John down into the dirt. The sky is orange and purple and red above them, burning.
” said the petty underlings of the crime syndicate, whispering it amongst each other in hushed voices.
Mrs. Hudson greets him with a tight hug and an exuberant kiss on the cheek. John hugs her back, noticing for the first time how small her waist is; has she lost weight? Although her grip on him is iron-strong.
“I...I don’t know how to say this,” John began. He couldn’t find the words. His head was swimming; it was all happening too quickly and he didn’t know
“Oh,” Mrs. Hudson says, the suspicion melting away. She wraps Victor up in a hug as well. “Why didn’t you say so? Any friend of Sherlock’s is a good boy.”
Every compartment John looked in seemed full of people by now; either with older kids who knew each other or new first-years chatting amiably, making friends. Already twice John had had his life threatened, almost getting run over by a girl chasing a cat down the hall, shouting, “Toby, Toby, you get back here this instant!” as if it would make a difference. The second time he’d almost gotten squashed by a Hufflepuff boy’s runaway trunk as it barrelled down the hall, having somehow sprouted legs. There was an older Slytherin boy who smiled at him and offered to help him with his trunk, but Harry had always said Slytherins were cheaters and liars and just the worst, so John politely told him thank you but no thank you, he could manage. Besides, while that boy had seemed nice enough, the large, silent company he kept terrified John, and he was all too happy to be on his way.
” said Bill. “They’re just going to keep on saying it, and the more you’re seen together, the worse it’s going to get, because nobody really likes him. I don’t think even his own Housemates like him.”
“Wait,” Sherlock might say. “Is she the one with the dog? Are you still seeing her? I was certain you broke up with her ages ago.”
“Your robes come from Madame Malkin’s; standard issue, medium weight fabric, moderate pricing, made even more affordable by the fact that they are last season’s designs, leftover stock on sale for 50% off. If you had an older brother rather than a sister you’d be wearing secondhand robes. Your books are handed down from your sister. Your family isn’t wealthy. Comfortable, perhaps, but not enough to be able to afford you any luxury. I am certain you don’t get an allowance. Imagine what you could buy with the extra money, John. Wonders beyond your little Muggle-raised imagination.”
Hazel could see the ocean from the sitting room window. She could see the ocean from the kitchen window. She could see the ocean from John’s window, from the toilet window, from her bedroom window, and she hated it, hated it greatly and irrationally and with a deep and unforgiving passion.
The fins on Sherlock’s ears reminded John a bit of butterfly wings, the way they were so pretty and delicate, and especially the way they flickered under his fingers. The action sprinkled John with droplets of water, making them both giggle as Sherlock shook his head.
Sherlock opened his eyes and saw John. He watched him breathe, the miracle of breathing, the rise and fall of his chest, inhale and exhale. John was breathing, the internal processes of his body functioning, heart pumping, lungs inflating and deflating, mouth parted just slightly the way it did with the adrenaline of the case still coursing through his veins. Sherlock thought about the way John’s breath looked in the winter, curling out in a soft cloud of smoke in the frigid air. He thought about John’s breath against his own mouth. He felt only hollowness with spilled blood. Expiration. He watched John breathe and revelled in the joy of respiration.
Sherlock had leaned in, had brushed their lips together, and whispered a soft "No," breath hot and pressed right up against the younger boy's mouth. He'd pushed himself back just long enough to enjoy the look of hurt, of shock and confusion, before he amended his statement. There had been fire in those midnight eyes. Fire, fire burning bright. "Not here, where anyone can cast an eyeball at you."
, glanced up to find John looking at him. John had previously been looking at the telly. He was mindlessly fixated upon some crime drama about a fairly competent DCI named Luther, who actually managed to solve his cases on his own. It was such an obvious fiction that it was painful. John was likely going to complain about the violin interfering with his vapid telly programme, and so Sherlock played with even greater determination. He had warned John about his worst habits, after all.
“Better Holmes than gardens,” John said, half to himself, and laughed.  He was hopeless, they both were - no hope for either of them, getting out of this, but John didn’t think he could try anymore, when the trying was killing him worse than the having. For now he could pretend that he would never need anything more than this, Sherlock’s arms tight around him and the heat of his skin and the warmth of his bed and the sweaty smell of him and his kisses on John’s face and throat, mouthing
“I am allowed to go to the malt shop whether or not you are there,” said Sherlock. “I like milkshakes.”
Sherlock’s eyes went wide with wonder. He was looking at John as if it had just been revealed that he was actually one of the co-authors of
Inside his room, John stared at the mirror, and ran the comb through his hair once again. He couldn’t get his hair to settle down, and he’d changed his shirt three times already. He
At this moment, John will pull back to look at her, and she will part  her lips in unconscious invitation.
John’s face was smooth against him and smelled strongly of cheap aftershave and honey. John’s skin, fresh from the shower, was warm and clean against his tongue, sweetened by the golden glaze. It was everywhere, a sticky film on everything it touched, much like John.
Sherlock pulled back, panting lightly, sitting up. In one fluid motion, he shrugged off his leather jacket, dropping it onto the floor. In the yellow light of the bedroom, John could see the flex of Sherlock’s muscles underneath the thin cotton tee shirt, the peak of his nipples, hard. John swallowed, mouth dry as the Sahara. When Sherlock looked down at him, he was mesmerized by the look in his eyes.  The way that a bird must feel, when it is confronted with the hypnotic gaze of a cobra. Pinned down. Trapped. He felt his own pulse as a fluttering of wings, beating against the bone cage of his ribs.
It isn’t that John is homophobic. He has no problems with The Gays. His sister, in fact, is gay. His best mate - apparently - was gay (or at the very least bisexual). His very good friend - apparently - is also gay (or at the very least bisexual). It’s fine. It’s all fine.
Downstairs, right now, Mrs. Watson will be making herself a coffee that is four parts Irish whiskey.
He resisted the urge to turn around and look. What would he see if he looked? There was nothing there. He was giving himself the heebie-jeebies, that was all. The house was too quiet, since Harry was at Clara’s for the night and his mother working a double shift. But it wasn’t like he’d never been home alone before.
Later, John would hear the whining as if it were coming from somewhere else. It was be too embarrassing to associate those desperate, undignified noises with himself.
Saturday night. John lay in bed, eyes squeezed shut, muscles tense and trembling. Like every part of him was a glass bottle with a bluebottle fly trapped inside, buzzing, buzzing about.
Sherlock looked down at him, sharp pale eyes scanning John’s face, as if he could read every lipsticked kiss that had ever been pressed to John’s mouth, every mascara’d eyelash that had every fluttered against John’s cheek, every rouged cheek that had ever rubbed against his. In moments like this the spectres of girlfriends past hung around John like a cloud of fading perfume. Sherlock hated it. John wasn’t sure whether that was more the reminder that somebody else had got to John first, or resentment at something holding John back from him.
“Have you ever tried asking an adult about curfew before? I bet you have. And I bet they told you to wait until you were older. That you knew all that you needed to know. But that's not enough for someone like you. So you pore over books and stories, you read the hidden stories in the back of the paper, about the mysteries, the disappearances. You comb through the obituaries for anything out of the ordinary.
The look in Sherlock’s eyes was glittering, triumphant. John’s skin flushed all over, he could feel the hot rush of blood throughout his body, arteries to veins to capillaries, hear each pulse of own pounding heart. He was barely breathing.
John does. Well, as much as he can disclose that’s not classified. He starts with the helicopter ride, and then Buckingham Palace, and then talks a bit about Irene Adler, swallows down the burn in his throat with wine, wishes he had something a bit stronger.
Sherlock was happy to oblige. He grabbed John firmly by the hips and turned him over. There was a certain amount of force but no violence in Sherlock's touch. John thought that he might not have minded if there had been.
John pushes Sherlock's hands away whenever they wander too far down south, and more's the pity. "Just kissing," he'll say again, with his mouth red and softly swollen from hard kisses, blue eyes nearly black with arousal, skin flushed and a boner tenting his pants that could clearly be seen from the next county over. "
“But we could try. I haven’t run an experiment like that before,” Sherlock added thoughtfully, looking at John and then back to the slug again. “Yes. I think that might be an area worthy of study.”
thanks to PrettyArbitrary  and angelblack3 for their help, support, and encouragement on this chapter!! Pretty helped me choose the car and brainstormed with me on lots of car-words. Thank you to my love, Archia, for being a strict editor ahaha
"Like me," Sherlock said, and smiled his bright little smile. "Come with me, and I'll show you everything."
John and Harriet were arguing over the correct identification of a bird that they had seen. They had been playing a game that involved shouting out the different things they spotted along the road, but currently just seemed to involve a lot of shouting.
Back at the motel, afterwards, Sherlock has his hands all over John before the door is even fully closed, tugging at his clothes and ordering him to strip, saying that he has to check him for ticks. He’s utterly disappointed with John’s lack of reaction when he pretends to find one at the base of his spine; John laughs, no stranger to walking through fields and forests. But they both yelp when they actually find one in Sherlock’s hair and John howls with laughter at Sherlock messing up his perfect hair with both hands scratching, cursing and yelling fit to beat the band even after he’s removed the goddamn bloodsucker - “Are there any more? Are you
John looked to Mike to see if he could make heads or tail - or sprout or root - of the matter. Mike only shrugged.
She made her way down the hall, stopping briefly to peek in on Harriet. Harry was asleep, curled around the cat, who was also asleep on her bed.
With his other hand Sherlock reached down and rubbed John through his white briefs, watching first John’s face (the sharp intake of breath, the way blue eyes darkened to almost-black, teeth catching at his lip ) and then his own hand, forming the shape of John’s erection through the thin material. John didn’t want to look and then he did. The sight of it was obscene, Sherlock’s long fingers splayed against him, touching him so knowingly, intimately, how his underwear so obviously tented. It made John’s face flame. Made him want  to take off his glasses so that he wouldn’t have to see it in such sharp acuity.
Sherlock ducked his head, licked a wet stripe over the exposed V of skin on John’s chest. One hand dropped between them, with his nails gently scratching over the shape of John’s erection, tracing it, lining it, paying attention to the head of it. John let out the moan that had been building up in the bottom of his throat, head dropping back, eyes closing. The overhead light burned bright through his eyelids, so that all he could see was white/glowing red. That was how he felt; burned through with light, filled with the color of heat.
“It isn’t the same.  Your life isn’t in danger, you’re not missing.  You’re not possibly…”  John couldn’t finish.
“No, I don’t need to.  It’s written all over you.  You hold your left shoulder and arm more stiffly than your right, you have marks on your fingers from guitar strings, but they’re too fresh to be there if you played often, but you’re here, so you’re the mysterious song writer.  Since the recording is rough, it’s you playing guitar in it, you’ve obviously played a lot in the past, but your fingers tell a different story.  So, former musician, you hold your arm awkwardly and have tender fingers- you had to stop playing because of something- probably an injury.  Something that would have stopped someone as passionate about music as you would have been traumatic, hence the therapist.  Now, passion.  This song is full of it, but it wasn’t about music it was about something deeply emotional, there is a lot of anger there.  It wells up and spills out, like you want to scream it, but you don’t want to share it.  Speaking about it with a therapist would have diluted the feelings, and they’re obviously still strong, so there you have it.  You’ve had a traumatic experience, stopped playing music, your therapist couldn’t get you to open up, but you’ve spilled your passion into a song.”
What was it that Harry told him about Clara before everything went to shit?  “She’s so funny, Johnny.  She could make a widow laugh at a funeral.  And she’s so strong- like- she knows people don’t approve of her being gay, but she doesn’t care.  I wish I’d met her sooner.”  He wondered if he’d ever find someone that made him feel that way.
“I had two bodies come in, both with very strange fingertips- they looked… dissolved.  But not like from strong acid like sulfuric, and not like you’d see from hard work.  These were recently damaged, and not very thorough.  It seemed… deliberate, so I asked Sherlock what would have done it.  He was helping me.   I also found traces of methamphetamine on the bodies, but not as though they’d been taking it.  More like they were making it.”
Saturday morning dawned grey and damp, much to John’s glee.  He rolled over and stretched, then nuzzled Sarah’s neck.  He loved morning sex, when everyone was muzzy and soft and bleary.  No rush, no urgency, just heat and the slow burn.  Fortunately Sarah did too, and they passed the time in the soft bed.
“I mean it.  Even if we never progress beyond this, you’re still the sexiest, most captivating person I’ve ever met.  I want you to be happy.  I want to make you happy.  I want you make you feel good.  I want to make you feel good like THIS, but I’ll only continue if it’s what you really want.  May I?”
When the song faded, and Sherlock slumped onto the floor, they looked at each other in amazement.  In the darkness, it was difficult to tell whose eyes had more tears glistening.
They paused and John raised up a bit to look at Sarah’s face.  Their eyes met, and there was a spark there, a mutual understanding.  They could both certainly see themselves ravishing each other- hot fast hard fucking.  Maybe that would happen later, but right now felt a little more passionate than that.  John had waited so long, he wanted to fuck her slowly, thoroughly, as if they were the only people left on earth, and the look on Sarah’s face told him she was thinking the same thing.
“John.  Go home.  Take a shower, get some rest.  Sherlock is in a medically-induced coma, and they’re keeping him that way until at earliest tonight.”  Greg put his hand on John’s shoulder.  “You’re going to need your strength when they bring him out.  You’ll be useless then if you stay here now.”
He felt her hands scrabbling at his hips, pushing him away and he stopped.  She gasped “No- just… move!”  He backed up enough to let her slip a hand in between them.  She flattened her palm against her mound and slipped one finger down to touch herself.  Rolling her head back she let out a moan that shot straight to his cock.
Sherlock got up and pulled John up after him.  Once they were both standing, he walked John to the center of the room.
John groaned and Sherlock pulled him closer and they toppled backwards along the length of the couch.  “I sent him away because he ISN’T you.  I sent him away because I don’t want him like that.  I want YOU like that, if you’ll have me,” he mouthed into John’s hair and stroked John’s back.
They approached the first door.  John stood to one side and the DI slipped in, then followed hot on his heels.  The room was big, square, and full of drug-making equipment.  It looked like they got there just as it was being packed up, it was partially dismantled, some was in boxes.  There were two men inside, with their backs to the door.
John sniffed, more irritated than angry.  “Fine.  But don’t forget to lock up when you leave, I’m taking Mrs. Hudson with me.”  Silent Minion #4 had delivered two tickets the day before, with express written instructions from Mycroft that Mrs. Hudson was to be John’s “plus one.”
“No- that’s not what I mean.  I mean that I would have stayed with her, and I would have gone through the motions of being in a happy relationship.  I might have even meant it.  But it wouldn’t have been what I deep down NEEDED.  All the way back from Wight I thought about how I’d feel if I lost you, and then I thought about how I’d feel if I lost Sarah.  There’s no comparison.  I’d feel sad about her but… well, if I lost you I’d be lost myself.  So.  There you have it.  You’re the greatest relationship of my life, Sherlock Holmes.  And I have no idea what to do.”
During the times when they didn’t have cases, John made sure to involve Sherlock in news from the clinic.  Not enough personal information to violate anyone’s privacy, or the law, but enough to keep Sherlock occupied, if even for a short time.  After the clinic’s cases were deduced, John turned to friends for help.  Molly provided interesting dead bodies, and Lestrade supplied cold cases.
At the theatre, John was pleased to see that Molly, Lestrade, and Angelo had also received tickets, and that their seats were excellent, front and center.  Catching a glimpse of Mycroft in one of the side boxes, he nodded and tipped his imaginary hat.  He received a smug grin in return.
Somedays John wished he hadn’t.  The physical therapy drained him, the mental therapy drained him, he couldn’t play his guitar for months because he couldn’t move right, the band replaced him.   He took a job at a pharmacy to pay the bills, stocking shelves and ringing up customers.
“Wednesday?  You’re joking.  That would mean I was out for four days.  Ring for the nurse.  I’m in no mood for jokes.”
Sherlock sighed and flopped onto the sofa. “Not us this time, John. Just me. This is yet another instance in the long line of Mycroft’s attempts to humiliate me.  He has
John pondered that.  She had a point.  Greg Lestrade was the best detective he knew after Sherlock, and Mycroft was downright terrifying when he wanted to be.  What on earth could John add?
Mycroft sighed at hearing Sherlock’s gibberish.  He hoped John would stay asleep for a little while longer, it was imperative that he speak to Sherlock before the doctor got back.
“Then the feeding, the prodding to sleep?  Is it because you think I’m not capable?”  It could have been a barbed question, full of scorn, but Sherlock was genuinely curious.
John walked to the door, but was stopped by an elderly gentleman in a butler’s uniform.  “And you are….?”  John blinked.  “John Watson, why?”  “My apologies sir, but no one is permitted entry without an invitation.”  John looked around quickly, mentally cursing himself for leaving his invite at home, stabbed to the mantle with Sherlock’s.
